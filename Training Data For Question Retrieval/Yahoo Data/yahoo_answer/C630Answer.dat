Who told you that you couldn't?|`|DtUpcdXwaa	When my sister tried to change her name with that they told her that one is just for show & most people frame them & the actual marriage certificate was the legally binding document .<br>  <br>  I don't get it either . Should be able to use either one .<br>  <br>  At the time my sisters work had changed her name on their system but because her bank account was in a different name her pay was in limbo for ages . The celebrant lost their form for the certificate that they already paid for & she didn't get her certificate for about 10 weeks she didn't get paid that entire time & her work stupidly said " your only limited to one name change a year " & wouldn't change her name on file until it was changed at the banks .<br>  Idiots .
2vaGZ4eDaa	No, I was floored when my wife cheated about twelve years ago.  She was always so proper, such a clean, straight laced girl.  She had a platonic friend that...well, one thing led to another, right?  Nope, I was in total denial.  Yes, we had sex, but she left and moved out quickly to be with him...and their relationship fell apart right away.<br>  <br>  I agree with shy....I now believe we all have the capability to do that.  Life lasts a long time, and when we are down, we need love and affection like we need air.|`|4POGapREaa	Yes I thought he was capable of it.  And yes he did.  Thankfully I have better taste in men now.  Yuck.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	I never thought that my ex would ever cheat on me. It wasn't bad enough that he had cheated but he had got the other woman pregnant as well. Yes, we were having sex while he was sleeping with the other woman. I had no idea what was going on and thought that he had more sense than to get another woman pregnant. We had three grown children also.|`|iD4ejChZaa	Good question, a couple of months ago he admitted to cheating last year. No, I din't think he was capable of cheating on me, married 24 years. I love and forgive him [because of Jesus] but naturally he lost my trust and respect. No, not loving & sweet to me, he was and is in the mideast.|`|AA11225089	It was a total shock to be honest, but I guess looking back I knew things were great between us. You just don't ever think it will happen to you. Yes we were still in a physical relationship at the time, and now the affair is over and I have forgiven, we are stronger than ever.|`|n8lXItGraa	Sometimes people find themselves in a position, and then in retrospect wonder what brought them to that point.  Everyone has the capacity to do things that they swear they would never do.  No ones immune to mistakes...no one.|`|W4vEwsrGaa	Well my husband and i are soon to be getting a divorce because of his cheating. No i never thought he would do this to me because hes so good to me in every way i just didn't see it coming but now that i know about it he tells me that he cant stop cheating because it gives him a high. so that's y were divorcing.|`|iJAa5rDyaa	.. I thought that it was possible but i was naive and thought that he wouldn't do that to me, ha!<br>  <br>  The weird thing was when he did it, i knew he did it - he was on holiday at the time and i was looking after his cat... the annoying thing is i had to force a confession out of him.. <br>  <br>  It made me have some trust issues, but that gut instinct i had was correct and now i have no realise when im being paranoid, or if im correct which i hope im just paranoid... as my boyfriend at the moment we have been living together for about 4 years on and off and seeing each other for 5 years .......|`|wohGR1Nkaa	I wasn't married to them but he was my boyfriend who decided to start ummm fondling with his ex and kiss her..<br>  I got back with him because I couldn't be apart from him. <br>  I never thought it was a possibility until my friend whom I used to trust told me it was true.<br>  The girl had said things to everyone and it got back to me.<br>  And yes we were having sex during the time he cheated. <br>  But he only did things once to my knowledge.<br>  And they were.. When I confronted him about this he told me honestly and he was sweet and loving to me.. And he said he was going to tell me... <br>  Ah well..|`|0KLu4hRaaa	I think that we tend to overlook or miss tiny hints along the way and once free from the relationship (after closure) then we can look back and see the clues we missed. Some times we are blinded by love, sometimes we are too busy to pay much attention, and sometimes we just convince ourselves that it isn't so. Lines of communication go down on one side or the other...One person is dishonest and manipulative, etc.|`|nmo7NSj1aa	oh yeah. they all have the capacity to cheat. some will, some wont. sometimes it's you that does. in my experience thats life. it's human nature. doesnt mean you'll do it again either. lifes just complicated and lust is a very strong emotion|`|WAgeAuvbaa	After answering several of your other questions lady I have been putting two and two together and so feel that I should be putting you over my knee for a spanking.<br>  Speak with your husband woman!!|`|Fc0ZR1hnaa	Yes, I think you just know these things.|`|Zca1PGERaa	had to cos they didnt lol kept lying about it|`|osZ5zVEDaa	I was cheated on once by someone I was in Love with. I never in a million years thought it could have happened. When we spoke of the idea we both agreed that neither of us would ever steep so low and if things had really gotten so bad that we would have broken it off first. Well she didn't. She tried to have her Cake and eat it too. We broke up, but I have remained friends with her ever since. <br>  <br>  Now we are both in healthy relationships. You never know, but you can't be in a relationship and not have trust. If you get burned then you get burned. Love is an all or nothing thing.|`|539b498d1aab682bbcf577c4ef9fd7c1aa	I felt it but still was shocked when he told me.  It broke all my trust and respect for him.  I have this sixth sense about it but still i couldn't believe, couldn't believe he would really do this to me.  He was sort of distant and not communicating but couldn't keep his hand off me.  <br>  <br>  It took me years to forgive him.|`|c369c7306456f90492efcd3202572c4caa	yes i knew something wasnt right, hiding mobile or putting on silent or turning it off.  Staying out later or going out more, taking more care in apperance and wearing aftershave more often.  Little changes <br>  <br>  yes the guilt kicks in and they then love you more and even have sex while cheating to ease their guilt.|`|SOv6I9Wfaa	Yes, I always knew he was capable of it.<br>  Yes, he was having sex with me at the same time, but otherwise was his usual bullying fault-finding unhelpful self.|`|3bf6bf2fa95deff37a266b5813651ca7aa	I never thought in a billion years that my husband would cheat on me, especially the way he did it!!!!!!!!|`|cNPDpCgpaa	it  was kind of like all the signs were there but i was to blind to see, and yes still having sex.|`|ddMlbXdAaa	i think you always know right.
wtPYkznQaa	For things being tough, I think that talking to God should defiantly help you out because he's always there for you. If I were you i think that going to church and just being in safe places such as that should really help out. Now a days it's defiantly harder to trust people out there because you don't know what there capable of doing. Well I'm not sure if I helped or not but I wish you the best of luck and hope that everything going to be alright. Take care.*|`|XeLmi1JSaa	I'm returning the favors and tell ur family and I'm a christion also infact I go to a christain school|`|mC1MMximaa	im sorry that u hav had to go through all that.<br>  It's hard. I don't really know what to say other than that, well you can trust jesus. You said that you were a Christian, so I can not believe that you forgot that. When ever you think of starting drugs, just imagine the look on Jesus face. Would you really want to disapoint him that way?<br>  I really doubt it. You seem like a good guy from the fact that you are trying to stay off that path. Believe in yourself, love your  life. When you think that life is bad, take a minute and look at the good things in your life. You most likely have a roof over your head, and food and a little more money than the people out on the streets.(Im just guessing from the fact that you have access to a computer).<br>  If you really need someone to trust, maybe you should spend more time at a church or with other christians.|`|WWnkeaIAaa	never cry wolf whatever you decide from here on|`|csFp83i1aa	talk to someone hun... you need help... if you cant turn to any adult turn to a christian friend you have because i know they will help yoiu and if all else fails just turn to OUR God and let him know whats up and ask him for strength and be patient...|`|a1c47082c5350245c9dbdf316c0424c1aa	I am a christian aswell... I would say start going to a church and make friends there they are great for support and encouragement..you could always read your bible too!|`|kDab6zpTaa	you should go live with your parents for a while if you dont already im sure itd fix things up a bit.|`|924ac5179093b3eda5b29740960670eeaa	one way forsure to stay on top is to talk to your friends about how your doing the ones that you feel a strong connection with. ther are also hotlines and websites that have to do with encouragement. and your church is a great place for support after the sermen you could talk to the minister and he/she could refer you to someone that you could talk to. even strangers could help bc they wouldn't be bias and judge you at least i wouldn't/couldn't my brother is going through the same thing he's in rehab right now so if you need someone to talk to i'm here for you|`|VVqGQfJYaa	before you put ur complete faith in god (im also frm a monotheistic faith btw)<br>  u have to first work things out for urself.<br>  (i would give some analogy here buut itll take ages)<br>  i learnt a little while back that the way to love life is to think that day of every hr or every min of every sec is your choice!<br>  u have a decision to spend that second however u want, u mite be limited about what decisions u make but u still have a choice! i dnt even mean regarding sin and good, but i mean small stuff like what music u want to listen to at a certain time<br>  <br>  freedom and choice is an incredible gift :)
zanZC8t6aa	um he sounds like a jerk! and i really don't get your question... but i would just try to ignore him and don't like him|`|prllht3vaa	say that again, makes NO SENSE WHATSOEVER|`|hpEtO45vaa	I think it might have been a dare by one of his friends to go out with you ( not saying that your ugly or such).

2OqA5Fi2aa	your waisting time girl, there's lots of guys that very attracted to shy girls. I don't think you have a problem just smile to the guys you like so they're not afraid to approach you... and go along with it.|`|ngevf3V1aa	To be honest i dont think you should start one....maybe getting used to have friends first would be better. cuz if you break up with that someone you won't have a shoulder to lay on...(well your family) <br>  <br>  but the point is you should learn more from friends that already had a boyfriend and then you should be more friendly and will be ready for a serious relationship.<br>  <br>  But always be yourself and trust yourself and if you think you are gonna do something you are gonna regret,thent don't do it.<br>  <br>  Im 14 years old and ive never had a relationship before so you might have to talk to other people. God bless you and help you with this.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	Maybe a relationship with one person that you have to talk to and interact with on a regular basis would help you. Just make sure you find someone who is not outrageous. It won't last.|`|KVNM4Bsdaa	i dont think a relationship would be out of the question for anyone.  you could probably find a guy who is just as quiet as you are and you two could have each other :)|`|X05GAaLeaa	If you made some friends you would be more outgoing.<br>  Work on getting some friends and your personality first.|`|WONQSuNNaa	Go to a party and get to know some people. Start talking to a girl who catches your eye. Just make casual conversation with her such as, if you've seen her before, talk about that time. As the time passes you'll get to know her better and before you know it, you'll be on your first date. Every girl wants to be swept off their feet, all you need is the right broom. Go buy the movie "Hitch" and watch it. Your definately ready to date, your in the prime, you just need confidence.|`|pFjgBBUZaa	bro dont worry about it your prob not the only guy like that. i would say get the girl if you can because she'll more like force you to be more social and make you chance a bit for good. But your personility is what makes you YOU, so dont give all of that and someone will reconize that :).|`|Z8Prgkl6aa	i think you should be patient. there are def. guys out there who like the shy/quiet type, and with time, you'll find that guy. i mean, don't be a pushover, but at the same time, just be yourself! :) you're ready when you feel like you're ready.|`|rCqcF75faa	You should make some friends first, and then when you are confident with them, start doing things you like, and get to know someone, then you might want to ask someone out|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Be patient my friend, your day will come when you least expect it.
1XcTZRemaa	You should probably wait it out, and just text him when you can. You could also ask him to do something, but more as a friend - or with a group of friends - like, go to the movies, or to a coffee shop. Spend some time with him, and get to know him. :] Maybe make an effort to see him during the day. <br>  It's important, though, that before things get too serious, he sorts out his feelings.

ClK9W8THaa	Well, i think that you are a good friend to her.  You are there to listen and you want to help her.  That is what good friends are for.  Now as far as dating her boyfriend, sharing personal things with her boyfriend and possibly sleeping with  her boyfriend is out of the question.  I'm sure that you know that is not the thing to do.  You've done what a friend should do already and that is listen to her.  Your friend is in need of someone to listen to her, and you have done that.   What your friend needs is to listen to her heart.  If her heart is telling her that he is doing something that isn't right behind her back..then she needs to seek those answers from him.  If he isn't being truthful about it then she needs to ask herself.. is it worth the time to be with someone who is lieing to her and sneaking around with others behind her back.  She has to decide if she really wants to stay with a person like that.  Often we listen through our ears, to what people say.  But what we really need to be listening to is our hearts.  Just continue to be a friend to her. She really needs that right now... And be there for her when she does make those decisions about him... She'll be fine in the long run... Everything heals in time.  And as far as her bing a virgin, congrat's to her.  If she isn't ready then so be it.. Waiting is the best thing in the world that she can do. it makes he a better and smarter person than he is. I hope that she and others who have  chosen to wait to have adult relations, continue to wait....it's a great thing ! Good luck to the both of you|`|OvuMI50Maa	but she's asking yopu to do this, you're not doing this because u want to b with him secretly. if u do this and it  turns out he would go with u , u would be helping ur friend, by her breaking up with a guy that doesnt care about her at all.|`|U1cTKnjDaa	fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffddddddddddd...

qpmGLd7laa	Man, that really gets on my nerves.  My mother never really abused me, but I went to juvy when I was 10 because my mother is a dishonest imbecile.  You should press charges.  Get some kind of proof of what she does to you...  if you have a friend over or something, when she has a fit, have your friend call the police or something.  Your case will be harder to prove if you don't have a witness or something because you've gotten in trouble for allegedly abusing her...<br>  <br>  Ugh, now I'm in a bad mood.

Well, when she hits you again you say "I will call police!" and she will go to court.|`|1VMeKHojaa	Yep, your mom's a jerk.<br>  <br>  Do something funny to the computer to mess it up - because moms can't do shitake mushrooms when the computer's being stupid.|`|VPksp6SQaa	WOW! First of all, what does your dad think of all this? Have u discussed it with him at all?<br>  Second, there is a slight chance she might be addicted to the computer, which is a whole other problem that you're going to have to deal with.<br>  As for her being like that, I guess try to stay calm and respect your elders....you look better that way!<br>  IF she pisses you off, leave for a while.

So hold it in till a few months have passed.|`|Bnl7z8pBaa	WHAT?<br>  <br>  You've been dating 2 days?<br>  <br>  You might want to wait a little bit, bro.  <br>  <br>  Maybe closer to 2 months.|`|z3QsWmzpaa	wait a couple of months if you tell her that you love her so soon in the relationship you will scare her off <br>  good luck =]|`|LFE878Osaa	awww thats awesome!<br>  i would wait for like a week but if you think she loves you to them tell her.<br>  trust me girls like it when you guys say that you love us!|`|6ADAAt6gaa	i think you should wait bcuz she should say it first|`|aeWy3eu7aa	who who whow who who!<br>  dude slow down! you've been dating 2 days?!?! fisrt of all i no that i don't like when a guy tells me he loves me and doesn't mean it in a sincere i love you way. second of all if its been only two days i would wait a bit and see if she feels the same way about you. now don't get me wrong you could be the type thats all love-at-first-sight and all but i still think you should let it play out of a week or two see how she feels for you. don't seem to eager or pushy, because if you say i love you now and she doesn't feel the same that will only hurt you in the end and if you say i love you and she doesn't no how she feels then you could just scare her off but on the off chance she feels the same, i'd say still wait and see if she feels the same. if she does she will wait, and if she ditchs you then obviously she didnt and it spares you from having to be embarassed if she doesnt say it back..|`|CQ6fbQ11aa	just tell her. maybe like if you guys are like hanging out and when you have to go or she has to go, just say something like "okay, i'll see you later, love you bye" or if you guys are texting or talking on aim or something like that, before you leave just say like "bye i love you" don't make it seem like something that you're uncomfortable with even if you are. just make it casual.|`|64bTqqfCaa	if u really and for sure love her theres no speacific time..just wait till u guys are alone and haveing a really sweet moment and say"i love you"my boyfriend told me after 4 days and me and him are still together 4 months later and we both adore eachother..so if u love her u do have to tell her but only if ur sure if ur just saying it to be saying it then dnt.=]]]]-goood luck|`|AIv0Fu8Xaa	WOW, well wat u should iz wait and spend sum more time with her.<br>  really be confident that you love her cause if it turns out to be a flop, your heart will break, and that not a good feeling not at all.<br>  plus i think ur moving to fast, you should get on pace with how fast she wants to continue the relationship. If you tell her u love her now she might be like 'wow" but she wouldnt know wat to do. Make sure its love and not infactuation. Look for signs that might give a hint of how she feels about you.<br>  <br>  Hope this was helpful good luck, just know having a broken heart is the worst feeling in the world.|`|Y63zyLZyaa	Act cool. Tell her you like her a lot and would like to get to know her better. Telling a girl you LOVE her after two days is a little stalker-ish and she'll probably think your a total freak (no offense). Now if she LOVES you back the way you LOVE her, then I say go for it. If not, proceed with cation, cause it's not hard to get the wrong idea.|`|AYrS226Iaa	well, thats not up 2 us. its up 2 u guyz. does she show strong feelings 4 ya? if u say i really really really really like u does she say the same thing bak? its really up 2 u. if u think u love her, then say so. who knows whether or not she will sya the same bak, but if she doesnt hten u no its not meant 2 be and if she does then u can last at leats a few more days/weeks!<br>  GOOD LUK!|`|KOzC3ZYwaa	Hi dude, i think you should wait for at lest a month. you think you might love her but it can all change in a couple of days. Telling her you lover her might scare her and it might lead to something you don't want. It depends how long you knew this girl too. so i would say wait at lest a month or so.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck man|`|o9Y7zuWGaa	Call her sometime and tell her so you can privatley. DO NOT TEXT! To me, I would hate that! So just call her and start a conversation and get her into a romantic mood. Eventually tell her you kinda like her and then once she says something say: "I LUV YOU!!!!!" I am a girl and I would love that!|`|iTjZMSukaa	r u sure u love her? think about it. give it some time, and especially give HER some time. girls like to think through things...so be patient. breathe. when ur sure the time is right, let the words i love u slip into a convo sometime.|`|xKgZAp1Oaa	First of all, learn to spell. Second, you have been dating for two days.. that is not love that's infatuation. If you tell her you love her now you will most likely scare her off because that is freaky as heck.|`|ZQZf1iINaa	only 2 days?!?!? youll come off as a stalking creep. wait for a month or 2.|`|A8S10nGBaa	LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 2 days and IN LOVE!!!!

Other ways are fine, but don't tell her until at least six months.  If she says it to you, kinda say it back but other than that keep your emotions inside.  And 2 days? and you love her already?....Maybe you should think about that for a sec.|`|B7caOcCxaa	umm... you should NOT tell her you love her right now, but depending on what she feels about you, you should probably wait a while before you tell her, and dont be too forward since you have just been datin for two days, you dont want to scare her off!!!|`|ZNXOhCQbaa	omg not yet! u've only been dating her 2 days?! no way shell think u r crazy!-no offense- but after a few dates just tell her u really like her-but in some really cute and romantic way- then just go wit the flow lolz but seriosly do not tell her yet|`|awdV68dXaa	1.

Lmao.<br>  Andd I've noticed you're questions have been about stuff like thiss.<br>  I'm guessing there's this guy you like and aren't sure aboutt?<br>  Well, here's my advice :<br>  Stop asking questions on YA about itt.<br>  I've done that in the past and it never helps you figure anything out about it. All it lets you do is rant and worry and overthink it more.<br>  Just go with the flow and see what happens.<br>  If you get the feeling he likes or might like you than talk to him about it!  If you're too nervous then I guess don't..<br>  If he likes you he'll eventually tell you.<br>  Flirt back with him. Give him hints. But don't seem desperate. :p|`|9bM3qdTiaa	a real guy would tell the girl|`|JlSc8q6zaa	Interesting questions.<br>  Guys get nervous around you way to fast. <br>  They seem to stutter and when they ask you what they said, the reply by saying "i said nothing". <br>  Guys will say almost YES to anything you ask for. For example<br>  If you ask a guy that if you could borrow your pencil. After your done using the pencil, he will say that you could have the pencil. <br>  <br>  Most guys will have a hard time starting a conversation probably because they are afraid that they might say something wrong. If a guy is your friend he might act differently then he usually does. <br>  Hope these helps.|`|hH76CdQ1aa	flirt..<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219171315AAcqSxc">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>  help me!!!|`|WLLqdPXeaa	Don't know about others but I will really like to have sex with the girl to her satisfaction.|`|lMV9oANDaa	oh my god ive been asking that question forever cause see theres this guy anddd yea.<br>  but i have no idea i just wanted to tell you thanks for asking(: cauuuse the answers u get will help me too.<br>  <br>  <br>  (:|`|dYhlebH8aa	they put on an astrounut suit to impress u, and they cant help but too fart alot

Second of all there is a way for her to stop bugging you. If she starts telling you what to do just go to another room or ignore her.Maybe she is jealous of you and wants to be like you. If she thinks she knows more but doesn't and you know that just let her think she s right i know she is frustrating and all but some times we just have to grin and bare it. <br>  Good luck*|`|3xohBcdoaa	make her do something else and make her stay that way<br>  tell her that u r older than her and she needs to respect u.<br>  make her take care of the baby her self first, then after she does something, tell her how shes doing it wrong like if it isnt perfect|`|NvOro0igaa	give her something to do, like bring your I pod and have her listen to music all night. That way you won't have to deal with her.|`|kCdISEGqaa	Kind of like how you think you know more about tattoos than I do, works both ways!!!|`|T55YPfXUaa	if she is annoying to be around, just tell her how you feel. tell her what she is doing is not fair and tell her you know as much as she knows about babies. she is not so perfect. don't let her take control of everything. i don't think that you are paralized; so i believe you should stand up to her or if you want make an excuse so that she wouldn't come over. tell her to respect you like she would want to be treated. <br>  <br>  good luck!!!

You are no more special that an ATM, unless this is in a personal matter then obviously she is attracted to you.<br>  <br>  Not really rocket science genius.
xmDxtcvaaa	No, you're most definitely not a bad boyfriend. Sometimes the best gift to a friend (or girlfriend in your case) can be a lesson learned rather than a car you're lending her. Don't lend her the car, what's wrong with getting a buss pass? Perhaps you should offer her to help her with that though she sounds too glamourous for public transportation. No good can come of it and if you were to let her borrow your car, you're only making the problem worse by enabling her. Good luck and I hope things go well between you two.|`|cPTB57WMaa	No man! Seems like you have a lot of hassle already to take care off. I know these nuts girls (one of them being my ex). Yours sounds similar to the crazy ones as well. Let her drive her mom's effing car. You are just her bf, not her husband or sth. By the way, it sure seems she would not be a good driver either, so why risking your car + adding 80 miles to it's mileage daily? Believe me, she is not gonna leave you if you say no. Ever heard that a lil bit of shovenism is good? If you keep saying "yes, yes, yes", she won't be that intersted in you. Don't make yourself a tool. Good luck. Seems like you are already on the right track, but I just wanted to remind you a few things.|`|MdUUGUPCaa	You shouldn't.<br>  <br>  Tell her ur point of view and if she doesn't like ur way of thinking then she ain't a good gf at all!<br>  <br>  SHE"S A ***** (no offense) FOR WASTING MONEY JUST LIKE THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|e124e8765c4b0ed9c4d1ca5f0af5f848aa	Yes do it so the both of you can get in ****!|`|pkja3qteaa	NO!!!!|`|G0U2ExOSaa	heck no. women cannot drive|`|XoxWrE2uaa	NO! Don't let her borrow it. Something might happen, and if it did she wouldn't be able to pay for it. <br>  Plus that would be stacking the miles on your car and you would probably be the one paying for the gas. <br>  She needs to learn from her mistakes, and somehow find out how to stop spending.<br>  And no, that doesn't make you a bad boyfriend. She might be mad at first, but in the long run, it really should turn out good and learn she will learn something from it.|`|oC8Ul5H6aa	No i dont think you are a bad boyfriend. just trying to help out your girlfriend. she needs someone to help her and that would be you. i think you are doing the right thing. i dont think you should let her borrow your car. that my opion. i would never ask my bf for his car though.|`|1J7rpwEdaa	You're certainly not a bad boyfriend. You obviously care! I think you've already decided that you don't want to give her the car.. but don't tell her that it's because you want to teach her a lesson. Just say its inconvenient for you if she has the car most days.|`|B4nujMnlaa	You are not a bad boyfriend. Trust me. I'm a girl and I would want my boyfriend to tell me I have to learn from my mistakes. She might get mad at you but you'd be doing her a favor.|`|6kAtYLAdaa	NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! have you never learned anything from court tv?  thats whats going to break you guys up.  she'll either wreck it or impound that one.  just say no!!!!! i mean you've said so yourself shes finacially retarded.|`|yTc3Hfybaa	NOPE<br>  lol<br>  i read the first and last questions &<br>  NO . don't let her borrow it and your not a bad boyfriend . . .<br>  <br>  <br>  : )|`|Bnl7z8pBaa	Better to be a bad boyfriend than a sucker.  If she's not responsible enough to take care of HER stuff, what makes you think she'll be responsible with YOUR stuff?|`|n336SjRiaa	never let your woman borrow your baby.|`|X5s6rjXQaa	No, you are not a bad boyfriend you just think about things before you do them. I would say that if you let her use the car, she has to supply her own gas money, don't give it to her that easily. Just leave enough gas in it to make it to the gas station.|`|EE0PY9K1aa	well that sucks.<br>  ummm<br>  tell her<br>  if your gonna use my car <br>  you'll havve to PAY for<br>  the gas prices<br>  and then youll see if <br>  she just wants the car <br>  to go out and stuff<br>  or you'll see that she<br>  will be responsible[:|`|y16e3fnkaa	dont let her borrow your car, through teaching her this lesson it makes you a good boyfriend. dont worry things always get a little bit wore before the get better. and in the long run this is the best way to go|`|V201Rrgnaa	no man. soooo many bad things can happen from that.  and she'll think she can use it whenever she want|`|PCb44JoWaa	No you are a good boyfriend.

aTBCXt8Taa	hey really good question and i can relate!<br>  <br>  I was the same way and it was really tough for me to actually get better and stop blushing completely. <br>  <br>  It wasn't until someone read me the following 8 steps that i actually became confident and it really helped me improve.<br>  <br>  I share these steps with you now. =)<br>  <br>  1) Relax. Tension increases blushing The moment you feel yourself start to blush, instantly relax every muscle in your body. You can't completely control your face from going all tomato's, but relaxing will help reduce it.<br>  <br>  2) Accept it. While some conversation is going on, you blush, make little of it, if any at all. Simply say "I blush easily" and brush it off and the likelihood of anyone teasing you about it will be very less.<br>  <br>  3) Don't feel embarrassed about blushing, there's no need to be. Admit it to yourself and let it pass. Develop confidence and tell yourself it's no big deal, and the chances are, it won't be.<br>  <br>  4) If public speaking makes you blush, think how other people see you. The probability is they see you as a courageous and confident person, just because you stood up to speak. So, there's nothing embarrassing about that, is there? There's really nothing to blush about.<br>  <br>  5) Apply a thin film of oil-free moisturizer on your face. They'll keep the skin cool if your skin burns when you blush. Don't try to cover the blushing with make-up, that just doesn't work. To cover the reddening, you'll probably need half a rouge container, which will be grossly overdoing it.<br>  <br>  6) Try to stay near an air-conditioner when you are at social gatherings. The cooling air tends to lessen the reddening. Also, if you keep a damp cloth (even baby wipes will work) you can wipe your face with it as soon as you feel a blush coming.<br>  <br>  7) Interact with people more often. Since blushing is a sure sign of less confidence, improving your self-confidence will take you a long way towards developing an immunity to blushing.<br>  <br>  8) Don't be a quitter, keep practicing. Nothing comes easy and quitting because you can't do it will never solve your problem. Stop being too hard on yourself, because quitting habits is not an easy thing to do.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|wMxJDXcRaa	I've always hated the spotlight and having to give speeches at work or family-sponsored functions. My paternal gran soon sorted that out for me by getting me to stand in for her regularly (on the eleventh hour, so to speak). Even though it mean't just reading out her written speech, my knees shook so much that I would have trouble standing. The room is usually so hushed that at times, I could hear my own heart beat. I began focusing on the people at the back of the room and a few minutes into the speech, I would be fine. Don't worry about blushing though, people won't notice that as much as you do.|`|4FR9d17Xaa	same thing happened to me. I started blushing when speaking in public. I tend to ignore it now, but I have no idea how it started happening.|`|aez3cIkvaa	Picture the audience naked or as something that makes you feel more confident, like picturing them all as little kids who have to listen to you.|`|mwWnrMJSaa	that happens to me too! i have no clue why it has never happened to me either till like this year....|`|sPDOMTTjaa	-You may have developed 'social anxiety disorder'. If you're not against the idea, you can go to your MD to get diagnosed & he/she will put you on a medication for this. I've known people with similar issues; they took the medicine and got better. <br>  <br>  -Also, when you feel a 'blushing' coming on, try to immediately stop thinking about it so much. This will make the blushing a lot worse if you start worrying about it.<br>  <br>  -Use a green concealer under your make-up & foundation everyday. I know you're probably saying "green?", but trust me, it works. Just be sure to blend the green concealer into your face really well. The color green camouflages red(the color of blushing). I have naturally 'rosy' cheeks, and have been using the green concealer trick ever since I started wearing make-up in 6th grade or so; and that should tell you a lot about it's effectiveness!|`|8ilHQMq5aa	im the same way. but i am not shy in the least. i just blush and/or get blotchy when im in social situations.
lAZWTLtRaa	Well, if you're hanging with him in your spare periods and after school instead of being with your own friends, that does make you a little bit clingy. Make sure you aren't annoying (usually clingy people are needy as well and are just really really annoying). Give him space and time. Make him miss you. If you don't talk to him, I'm sure he'll miss talking to you.<br>  If he starts up convos and hangs out with you too, it's not your fault that you guys spend every minute of your free time together. That's what friends do, after all. If I could I'd be with my friends 24/7 (well ok not really but you get my point =])<br>  Just distance yourself from him for a little while. Focus on your friends and your school work.<br>  When you pass by him in the halls (when with friends) look like youre having a blast (talking, laughing, waving to friends you see going to classes or at lockers, etc).<br>  When he does start talking to you just act like a friend. Talk to him in class and after school if you see him, but spend your free periods/lunches with your friends.|`|eO4y3m1maa	Give him the space he needs, let him miss you..dont text him write him..or msn him. let him write you......<br>  <br>  then when you do get him back..dont spend every breakwith him ..go with your friends...so he will go to his...he will see you arent too clingy!|`|NSwkUNb1aa	bad, you probably show have at least made the effort to talk a little bit, at least if I were him I would have been a little pissed off, he did say he still wanted to be friends.  oh, and don't tell a guy you had a dream about him breaking up with you.....It just makes us think your crazy and we should get away|`|8PkEkTcZaa	well you can be clingy when you don't realize it. so... just let it go.|`|1J7rpwEdaa	Say hi when you see him, and flash him a smile.. but just keep walking. Pretend you can be grown up about the whole situation.. he did say be friends after all... so there's no point hurting yourself by just ignoring him completely. Chances are if you were together so often he's missing you already. So by breaking the ice and saying hello, it might mean that he'l initiate more conversation! But don't leave it too long to speak, because then you might never!|`|7OTJW7fAaa	He probably has his eye on another girl that he would like to get to know better, but the fact that he hangs out with you so much is interfering with that.  It sounds to me like you two were mutually interested but he has lost interest and now wants to label you clingy so you won't want to hang around him anymore.  <br>  <br>  You can't win him back and you don't want to win back a guy who doesn't want to be with you.  He explored what he could have with you and discovered he wasn't interested in taking it any further.  If you want to continue to be his friend, just keep talking to him when he wants to, but don't initiate any contact.  In the meantime, look at all the other guys around you.  There is at least one that has been hoping you would notice him noticing you.  This is the guy you want to be with; the one that would be thrilled to be with you.|`|bexmfHv0aa	find a new man and move on.<br>  or forgive him and move on.|`|UNhYZMoWaa	To make a relationship work you need to give some space.  It seems that every free minute you have you are spending with your boy.<br>  <br>  Firstly talk with him about it.   Don't get upset or turn on tears, you are trying to be mature.    If he tells you that he feels clasturphobic, then tell him it's okay that you will go and do your own thing.    Maybe give him a day or two   alone. So he can hang out with his friends, or do his own hobbies.   <br>  <br>  During the mean time, go and enjoy yourself, get into contact with your own friends or do a hobby.    <br>  <br>  Trust me being with someone 24 hours a day might not seem bad at first but after a while it does it get boring as you both don't have anything more to discuss and then you would start to irratate each other.  Which I am assuming your boy is starting to feel that way.   <br>  <br>  Summery chat, work it out.    He isn't going to cheat on you, just going to hang out with his buddies.|`|k1cBi5o8aa	When you really like someone I guess its hard to realize how clingy you are being because you want to be with them all the time.Guys like challenges .If you are up in his face 24-7 there is no mystery he already got you and some dudes get bored with that. I agree that you should give him his space and lety him come come to YOU. He will miss you and start wondering why you don't talk to him any more and maybe try to flirt with other boys in front of his face, it will make him jealous.....
0jmVA50Jaa	Sounds like a Mother-in-Law from hell.  But the thing that is sad about your story is your Husband.    He Loves both of you and it is so hard for him to treat one badly.     Evidently your Husband feels sorry for  his Mother and continues to try to help her.    Life sometimes is not fair.    Evidently your Mother-in-Law is very hard .       Depending how old she is, and if she can't support herself, probably you and your husband should place her in a home.       Mothers like her , is awful.  No child deserves to be treated like she has done to her children.   I am sure your husband is ashamed of her, but yet what can he do ?    Try to endure and help your husband.  He is like all men, they struggle silently.    In the Holy Bible it says:   And this too shall pass.     He doesn't give you anymore than you can handle.     One of these days the old biddy will kick the bucket . The sooner the better, until then hang in there.      Good Luck.|`|5bYpbodUaa	OMG...I had the same ordeal with my Mother In Law. I hate her. I do not like that woman. She raised her kids to be companions for her and take care of her. My husband, at 36 years old only had one other girlfriend besides me. Seriously...that's how bad she manipulated him and she destroyed anything he tried to do for himself. She convinced him to have her live with him too. He paid for EVERYTHING. Even $6000 for two sets of dentures (because she didn't like the first set). She NEVER paid him back. She wasted her money on cigarettes and Bingo. When I came into his life, I could not stand the was she was being. My husband was so vulnerable, and he allowed her to manipulate him and dominate him so much. I finally had to give him an ultimatum (I hated doing that but it was necessary). I told him he can be his mothers companion for the rest of his life, or get a life of his own with me. She was more than capable of living on her own. And I had one battle on my hands. But, the more strength I showed, the more strength my husband acquired. She tried to break us up, discredit me, and after we moved her into her own place, she still tried. My husband knew what he had to do. We finally had to tell her that she could not be in our life with her attitude. She never knew about her grandson until he was 2 1/2 years old. And she knew why too. We still keep her at a distance, and she has still tried to dominate my family, and I will not have it. My husband back when we were dating had to choose to either be his mothers pon/minion, or be my husband and have a life with me. He chose me. Thank God. I was getting tired of fighting for him. <br>  With your situation, you all need to just cut her out of your life for a while. You all don't need the added stress nor aggrevation. You all deserve a loving atmosphere/environment without her upsetting you all. Your husband needs to gather that strength in him and protect his family (meaning you and your kids). You all come first. Your family comes first...not his mother. <br>  (and my husband didn't have his dad past age 16. He had passed away, so his mother, instead of encouraging him to go to College, said that it was up to him to support the family....so he thought he needed to. He missed out on so much for so many years).

You did all you could do to make amends.  There is no more that can be done.  I know thats easier said than done, but you really have no choice.  Move on, and if your friend see that your moving on and he/she want to reach out to you, they will, if not, they were not really a friend in the 1st place.<br>  <br>  You are giving the situation too much power and control, let it go!

xOYGzkSxaa	I can relate a lot to your problem. I think one of my main reasons for being so coy around strangers was that I felt inadequate and unworthy of their time, I felt this way because I thought myself as ugly. This was all during Middle School as I jokingly like to call them my "awkward years." LOL All it took for me is to realize that I am beautiful in my own way and once I learned and accepted myself for who I am I began to value myself and started a beautification process. I felt worthy of change and of the chance to feel beautiful. I'm not sure if the reason why you're so shy is because of your perception of yourself but whatever it is I'm almost positive that it's all in your head. You need to talk to your classmates with confidence, smile, do not put hair in your face, don't shrug or slouch because your body language is letting everyone else know that you're uncomfortable and people take notice of this especially in high school, girls can be vicious. Talk clearly, demand attention with your eyes...and I don't mean  like a crazed stare more like giving eye contact to people that talk to you. I'm sure you'll feel so self-conscious when doing these things because you'll feel like you're putting up a facade that this confident person isn't you but it is and you have to start believing that you are. Your mom can be great help with all this or an older sister.|`|k4gXIxJNaa	When i was about 3 to about 12 I probably had about 10 friends in the 9 or so years. I am 16 now and am very happy with my social life. So I know what I'm talkin about. =). <br>  I am assuming you are in high school.<br>  First, you need to take a risk. For example, last spring I joined a lacrosse team in the middle of the season only sorta knowing one person. That way I made more friends. <br>  If you arent ready for that then I would suggest going up to some one that looks friendly at lunch or something and ask to sit with them. (not preppy that doesn't go over well, from exprience) . Someone that doesn't have a lot of friends either so it isn't so intimidating. <br>  Also, you don't need to join a team that was just an idea. There are plenty of clubs and classes in most communities that you can meet people at.<br>  I think that if you make more friends then that will increase your confidence since it goes hand in hand. <br>  Its scary at first but in order to make change something has to change in you or your enviorment. Try to let you guard down and you should succeed. <br>  Post back. Can't wait to hear what happens.<br>  Hope this helps!<br>  =D|`|qUHhBzOyaa	i myself am a very outgoing kind of guy. and the only thing you need to remember is to be yourself. your friends will accept you for who you are and there is times when you just act on random impulses and it turns out to be really funny. don't be afraid to randomly dance around the room or act how you would any other time.|`|BQP4Vtgmaa	start out just pretending...you can freak out inside but just try and stay cool if you feel uncomfortable talking to someone...ill tell you what really helps....everyone you walk by, smile and say hi walk tall and keep your head up...i promise it will work...eventually people will start talking to you!|`|YwagvE5saa	LIFE IS TOOO SHORT!!!!!!!<br>  BE WHO YOU WANT TO BE<br>  AND DON'T TAKE ****<br>  <br>  <br>  HAVE FUN WITH YOUR LIFE!!!!|`|o1rzGR8kaa	I get cab job, I people person|`|LpXQgOjCaa	I have the exact same problem!<br>  At my school u just have to be really random, theres this random popular girl rebecca that will randomly say: "OMG a fish!!" and also u need to bring colorful straws to lunch. do not ask why but ppl love those things! =D<br>  You also need to crack alot of jokes.|`|924ac5179093b3eda5b29740960670eeaa	i DEFFINETLY! know what your talkin about! when i was a fresmen i cared about what people thought of me so i faked it i hated myself i had alot of friends but i didn't like them bc i wasnt myself. after telling myself how amazing i was in the mirror even if i felt ugly ther is more then looks! and accepting that i was different and after i let go of " no one likes me i'm ugly" i started to love myself and my difference and i found people who liked the same things i like. not being shy goes in the same boat you have to feel comfortable w/ your self if you have ne other questions on how ask k!|`|3kCQDUUGaa	NOT EASY TO DO :(|`|MNqwUHypaa	naw, you just need your own pet chimpanzee. adopt a chimp and live a little. ziiwaaaaa yiiiiiiiiiii!!!!!|`|xHO5yihjaa	walk up to them and talk to them and ask them if you want to hang out|`|AR5Q5jk6aa	Every day for a week write down five things you like about yourself physically and mentally on a peice of paper.

UV27AyIPaa	I talk to everybody about it, but I do prefer to talk to people in my same situation, because they seem to actually get it, rather than just empathize.

I don't have a problem telling friends and family how I'm feeling.  They don't have to have been there to get it, and the more I talk about it, the more they seem to understand.  It helps that we've been through 3 deployments, so they learn a little more about what it's like each time.<br>  <br>  I remember one Easter.  It was the Easter before my daughter was born, so that would have been OIF III, back in 2005 and my husband's second tour over there.  One of my Aunts got mad because I walked out of church when he called, and then she asked me afterwards "Couldn't you have just called him back?"  I just laughed and told her that he doesn't have a phone number and he stood in line for 3 hours to talk to me, so I answered the phone so we could get our 10 minutes.<br>  <br>  This last tour, no one ever said a word when I would jump up and answer my phone when it rang, no matter WHAT was going on.<br>  <br>  And a lot of them really have been there.  My grandma during WWII didn't see grandpa for 4 years. (And I thought 15 months was bad).  My aunt went through 2 tours of Vietnam with my uncle.  My other aunt went through 3.  My cousin's husband is in the Marines and deployed came home and deployed again, all while my husband was serving one 15 month tour.  <br>  <br>  One of my best friends is a former military spouse, her husband got out years ago, but she went through one deployment to Kosovo and one to Iraq before he got out.  Another of my best friends is in the National Guard herself.<br>  <br>  So I have a lot of real support within my circle of family and friends.

But if u find someone that wants different things that you it could really would you back|`|0OT4i7Dsaa	it might hold you back from moving to another country and sleeping around!|`|odOsEXn6aa	It depends on what you want in life.|`|ce8kACW4aa	no i dont think it does and if so dont get married
EG23NoiDaa	Personally, when i want a guy to kiss me i kinda smile and <br>  let it fade, and briefly look at his lips. But i like when he just <br>  kisses me outta no where. it makes me feel like not only does he want to kiss me, but he isn't afraid to and he thinks about me. its really sweet. :] && when it comes to mature people i really understand about that to. I wanna know everything about my man. But he has told me that he has a trust wall that he has built, not to keep people out but to keep him safe. so im ready to know all his problems and we have been together for a month. when she hints that you can tell her anything, trust her and tell her when your comfortable with it.<br>  Hope i helped. :]|`|AA10119162	If she talks close to your face when she's being romantic she might be wanting to kiss you. <br>  If she tells you something personal about her she will most likely be willing to listen and keep something of yours private.  If you know that you can trust her to keep it between the two of you, start with something small. <br>  good luck!|`|NNNfXUebaa	aRE THESE TWO SEPERATE QUESTIONS? WELL YOU KNOW WHEN A FEMALE IS READY TO KISS WHEN ITS JUST YOU TWO ALONE AND SHE JUST STARES @ WAITING ON YOU TO MAKE THAT MOVE, AND ONLY YOU CAN TELL WHEN ITS TIME TO TELL HER ABOUT YOUR PASS SOMETHING THAT IMPORTANT YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU TRUST HER ALSO MAKE SURE SHE IS READY FOR WHATEVER YOUR SITUATION IS.. OH PS.. WHEN YOU DO TELL HER MAKE SURE SHE IS THERE FOR YOU IN ALL WAYS POSSIBLE|`|TDfuhLPQaa	well...if the relationship is between two mature people who are planning to marry....then what are you waiting for?  you need to know if she will be able to support you and if she loves you as much as you say...she will.|`|sLwmzvi8aa	well if your getting married then you should have already kissed her... but any way she usually will not move and stare at you... then she will look at your lips but only for a second... <br>  <br>  you will know when the time is right... it will just be right
YsiJiOqXaa	Well you obviously got the tattoo because you liked it. You shouldn't change yourself to please anyone else on your day. I have one on my back of a heart with my grandpa's name in it and I'm not covering it up. and my fiance has full sleeve tattoos. We are getting married on the beach and he will have his sleeves rolled up. 2 of my bridesmaids also have them and I'm not making them cover them up. It seems silly to do that. Why try to be someone you aren't. If you want to show it then show it. Don't listen to people that make comments like the ones above about it being tacky or trashy or anything like that. If they don't want to look at it then they can turn their head or not come to YOUR wedding! Simple as that!|`|M7CdgSNSaa	I don't think so at all. I have a tribal butterfly on my back with my brothers initials in it ( he was murdered in '99) and I will be wearing a strapless dress. I also have one on my wrist that i don't think I will cover up. My tattoos have special meanings to me and I would cover that up.|`|E2X6B1Iaaa	It is not ugly and not inappropriate. Who makes up these rules anyway, stating their opinions as if they're fact? I love all my tattoos and between my guy and I we have 10 very visible pieces. They are a part of us. We are both professionals and not "low-lifes" or "tacky." <br>  <br>  Why would you want to cover up who you are?|`|YZokRYWcaa	if you like it, who cares? as long as its not Satan's head or a naked lady or something. someone will always complain, but hey, its not them in the dress, so their opinion shouldn't matter. your FH loves you AND your tattoo. so more power to you.|`|iB27Flhvaa	No, i dont think it will look ugly.<br>  <br>  You just need to make sure that the dress goes with the tattoo..... and either have it fully on display (strapless), or if you dont want to, cover it with your hair.|`|9lH1Y3Nzaa	To some it might,But who cares! A tattoo does not make you any less classier.|`|MxJhDrmXaa	if it fits[as in looks good on] you and its a cross whats the problem<br>  i think it will look magnificent :D|`|wXyoo8mNaa	it depends on the ink and who's opinion  it is i like them i have 2.|`|aipChC3haa	You can wear your hair down, but if you posted a picture it might help us understand the situation a little bit more.<br>  But, are you ashamed of the tatoo?<br>  Because it might not actually be super horrible, we just have to see it first.|`|sLwmzvi8aa	if its you then no... but if you dont like it then just get a jacket or some thing to cover the small part of your back that is showing... but i personally would not like it... but my step mom has a tat on her neck and wanted her hair up... so she just got a little cute jacket and all was fixed|`|Siv0DwQKaa	No your tattoo won't look ugly. I personally don't have any my self but I have lots of friends that do. If it is something you love don't worry about it until the big day comes and you change your mind. It is your choice not anyone elses.|`|9bOADMiraa	Yes it's not Approriate to do so use something to cover it they have something special but i don't know the name in my head|`|ElhtzPqEaa	absolute terrible...sickening|`|4POGapREaa	If you love it, then of course it's fine.  At least it's not bad artwork that's all faded or something you regret & don't want to show.  My husband is a tattoo artist so maybe I'm more open than some people would be about it, but if that's you & you like it then show it.|`|6dIJ8sUkaa	Absolutely not. I have a tattoo of my son's name on the back of my shoulder and by no means will i try to hide it on the day of my wedding. I am really proud of my tattoo and it's part of who I am. In my eyes anybody that is embarrassed of showing their tattoos on their wedding day or any day for that matter then got the tattoo for the wrong reasons. You should never be ashamed of showing your tattoos anyday even on your wedding day.|`|7OXC0VqQaa	i think they can look really pretty if the tattoo is pretty, if you wore one of those backless dresses like this <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7WcNt9ajb0w/RehT9mIcOpI/AAAAAAAAAY8/Ye6qMzUjVoc/s400/blue.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7WcNt9ajb0w/Re...</a> and did your hair like in waves kinda like you see in those greek paintings it would look very nice.<br>  <br>  if anyone says anything about your tattoo then who cares? this is your day not theirs. There is a youth minister at my church who is covered in tattoos so i really just don't think its weird or ugly at all!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	No. Tons of brides at www.offbeatbride.com have tattoos and they don't look trashy at all. Your tattoo is obviously part of who you are so why cover it up just to fit a certain image?|`|UoexcWYSaa	well i have roses down my spin and it looks great on my weddin pics every ones loves it and now photographers can remove them i had some of mine removed on my rist|`|2aLb2ipWaa	im got one on my back as well,<br>  if you dont want to show it off at the wedding, wear your hair down :D
u9IMNd7Iaa	It would really help if you told us what she's like or what she's into.<br>  But how here's some ideas...<br>  <br>  body lotion/body spray<br>  cute little earrings<br>  a CD of her favourite artist<br>  a poster of a band she likes<br>  a gift card for a cute store in the mall<br>   a gift certifiquete for a mani/pedi (get one for you too, so you can go together)<br>  a friendship necklace/bracelet<br>  A cute photo fram with a picture of you guys together<br>  Lipgloss/other makeup|`|uwsO5XMYaa	well, get her something that u think that she will like or get her something from hottopic (there r some really cute things in there if u look for them), or a shirt from her fav. store.  or something really cute. it doesnt matter as long as u tried to make it something special then it should pay off and she will b happy!|`|LCZFM29Oaa	I agree, gift certificates for mani/pedis, spa treatments, etc. are the best because its not really like a gift certificate, its like youre treating them to a special thing. you guys could go together also!|`|RBVq4SZLaa	you should get a fish bowl and a betta fish it's a cute gift, and as long as it doesn't die it'd be a great pet|`|Cpp1LddVaa	That depends on your budget and what dollar amount is most "comfortable" for all concerned.<br>  <br>  The best birthday present I ever got my wife was a gift certificate for a massage at the local YMCA.  That and "spa treatments" are good for their self esteem and make them feel pampered and fussed over.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes.
XoxWrE2uaa	She's probably just trying to make you jealous with the whole ex boyfriend thing because you didn't notice how she felt. That and some fear of you saying no/ not liking her back ect. <br>  Talk to her about it.

If she has been honest with you in the past, she's probably telling the truth now.|`|SsB7aRExaa	Yep.  Move on.  People who play these games are a waste of time.

Tell her how you feel.. you already know that she likes you!!|`|MAloAT8jaa	ill say one thing. they always want what they can't have. so make yourself unattainable. when your with her ignore her when your not with her avoid her when she talks to you give her a pitiful response.|`|XtbO9XR0aa	Ask her and if she refuses move on|`|iTjZMSukaa	whats her problem? i think u deserve a better girl.|`|CXT1SecRaa	i would keep being her friend, but show her im interested in other girls and want a relationship, if shes still acting uninterested at that point just move on....<br>  <br>  or i mean you could just ask her why shes talking about her ex's and acting uninterested if she really likes you.|`|2VYqxF9baa	She's afraid of rejection. Call her. Make a romantic gesture. Send her flowers.  Or you could take her somewhere romantic and tell her.

1VkTI70Caa	It is a very pretty dress. Personally I think it's beautiful! But in the end it really all depends how she looks in the dress and how she feels in it. Does she feel beautiful in it? Does she love it? If she does, then great! <br>  If not, or if she isn't quite sure, asking some opinions, (like you are) and perhaps trying some other dresses to be sure might be helpful.<br>  <br>  Unless you are positive of the dress you've chosen, sometimes trying on other dress can help you feel more sure in your decision. Or perhaps you'll find the perfect dress you didn't realize you wanted.  Either way it can be fun trying on dresses. That's the best opinion I have without seeing her in the dress.|`|H3ktCe3Eaa	I think it's pretty, but I personally would want something more long, and poofy, and fairy-taleish.  But I guess it would depend on her age, and body type.  If it looks good then, go for it!  But it does look like it would be more attracted to the older couples, who aren't getting married for the first time.  (which could be your sister in law's case)<br>  Well, good luck!|`|7wQ5t5Psaa	it's not my style, but it is a pretty dress.  It all depends on how it looks on your sister-in-law.

3vnAdO5Iaa	You have described ANY 6 month high school relationship! <br>   People need to grow up before getting married, otherwise they WILL grow up but may grow apart. Marriage complicates that process. In-laws further complicate things. <br>  <br>  Consider nothing unless both are over 21 with a rather substantial savings in case you both lose your jobs.|`|tVqLmImUaa	Talk to any relationship councilor and they will tell you that six months is still the "honeymoon phase" of a relationship. Without going into depth about the scientific reasoning behind this (chemical levels in the brain, etc), this basically means that reality hasn't fully set in yet.<br>  <br>  It is too soon. Why rush things? WAIT.|`|HM1jdFeWaa	If you both feel ready to go for it, then go ahead! It always depends on the individuals involved some people date for years and they get married but still divorce a year later, and then there are those who got engaged after just two months and are still madly in love! Don't worry too much about your parents, they'll come around. Good luck :)|`|sLwmzvi8aa	i think you should wait another 6 months before you pop the question... i know it sounds like a long time but if you really love each other then it should not matter how long you wait... <br>  <br>  plus i was going out with my BF for a year and we finally found out that it was not going to work out... so just wait a little...  and wedding planning can be the best but worst time... so be sure before you go through the drama|`|doVbqo3iaa	depending on your age, you should wait longer. if you're so in love, you have the rest of your lives to get married, why rush it?

So I don't regret getting divorced. I truly tried to make things work out. I can live with myself because of this fact.

Please, ...at that age, we know nothing, though we think we know everything. so no, i dont regret the divorce....|`|sVdQSMvJaa	I have never been divorced as I am the wife of one man and will be for the rest of my life.  Divorce is not an option.    I can tell you honestly that if my husband wanted to change and did for the sake of saving our marriage and I just walked away, I would feel horribly guilty and I would be racked with guilt for the rest of my life.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	No, I never regretted it.  He was verbally abusive, and on the day it turned physical, I left.  He promised he'd change, but I knew he could not.  He was a "mental cripple" who used everything and everyone as an excuse for his life.  He wouldn't work, nothing.  It's been 10 years that I've been away from him... the first two years he stalked me....he then took his life 2 years ago.  Very sad... but, if I had of stayed with him, it's possible I too would be dead.
YQxI6gu5aa	forget her. if she would shut you out because some loser boyfriend broke his loser leg then she isn't worth it. she owes you more than just money, she owes you an apology and clearly you aren't gonna get one. she sounds like a total *****. don't fill your life with bad people(meaning her) but continue to fill them with good people(meaning your boyfriend, who had no wrong doings in this situation) i hope this helped. do not go to lunch with her!|`|AA10952386	Ok, it seems that, knowing what you tell us about this friend of yours, it's not just about having lunch. Is there any indication that she wants to patch things up? Does she want to start some kind of payment plan with you and try to make peace? The only way to find that out is to get together with her and find out what her motive is. If she has bad-mouthed your relationship and decided to hate you because of YOUR choice of lifestyle, than maybe she feels bad or guilty that she judged you after all that time. I personally wouldn't have responded to her invitation, but then again, I have a friend from high school that hated me because she thought I disapproved of her boyfriend, so she cut me from her life. But, we have been talking for the past few years and we are supposed to get together this Saturday like old times and have lunch together.  But you and your friend have money coming between you - and that is the toughest part. Once money comes into the equation, the friendship isn't just about who disapproved of who, it is about your friend not being loyal to you when you bent over backwards for her!!!  If you haven't gone to lunch yet, keep in mind that you can always treat it like a business transaction - because unless she is going to apologize and regain your friendship, it sounds like she is coming out of left field after making it clear she wants to be a part from your life.  When you do see her, keep your cool and do not lash out at her. Find out what her reason was for getting together. Most likely it's not just to share a meal. With that much tension in a friendship, both of you have to start over or agree to disagree and go your separate ways.   Good luck!  Hope it goes well!|`|z1RmCqBbaa	it sounds like they took advantage of you helping them out. at first, i understood why you wanted to help them, and i don't blame you for being a good friend. that's ok, but what isn't ok is that they're taking advantage like that. you helped them out and you need to get it through their heads that you can easily not help them anymore and show them that what they're doing is wrong. thnx for ur answer and hopefully things will work out for the best. :-)|`|7J1ub9Yraa	I know im only 15 so you might not think my advice matters...but im going to try because you seem like a very nice person and this situation is very screwed up for you.     So....i think that you should talk to her and tell her whats going on in your mind. Because you guys are supposed to be best friends. And true friends don't shut each other off after any situation no matter how small or big. Especially since you guys have been friends since before the boyfriends. Remember...boys will come and go but friends are forever. Tell her how you feel that the situation is screwed up because after all you did for her she changes on you just because of her boyfriend. That's bull. And if she doesn't get it then you should drop her. As much as it hurts...you should. Because if she was a true friend se wouldn't have gotten mad in the first place and she would listen to you. She really should apologize too. Because you guys didn't have to loan her $1000 bucks in the first place and then on top of that pay their rent. You guys should renew your friendship first. Then over time....ask her to pay you back. Maybe not all at once but slowly. Because she really does need to pay you back. And if she doesn't listen or blows up at you...then you really need to re-evaluate her and look inside yourself and see if she really is the type of person you need in your life right now. See if shes a true friend. And if she's not...let her go.|`|USn04b4Paa	Friends need to be honest with each other ,forget write know about the thousand ,but it seems you all need your own space.I think the best thing for you guys to do is to move out and try to put this behind you ,in relationships there will always be ups and downs but not being friends anymore over money and stuff is a wast.Forgiveness is key to a long relationship|`|WGebRhqyaa	first off. not many people answered my problem question so when you get a chance can you read & give me advice.  second if it were me i'd look at it as me & my bf are a team. so i would go to lunch w/my friend because she was my best friend & i'd imagine you'd still have love for her. i'd see why she wanted to meet up w/you see what she says. then bring up your feelings on the whole matter. i say be honest but first see why SHE wanted to meet w/you. maybe she realized how they mistreated you guys & how it was not fair for her & you to be put into what happened with ya boyfriends.|`|TPPJEHjsaa	Don't go to lunch with her. What are you thinking?    Did they sign anything saying that they would pay you back, or did they tell you they would pay you back? Take them both to small claims court.
naequcqlaa	I would say it's his self esteem that's what's doing this to him.  He knows you're younger, do have a few more things going for you that he doesn't, but I'd say his self esteem is about zilch & that's the problem.  The only thing you can do is just assure him he has nothing to worry about BUT that his acusations are causing bad problems between the two of you.  I can imagine just how things are tho.  There's nothing that's worse than having a very jealous mate, believe me, I too well know the feeling.  All the bad vibes are actually coming from him, he is the one creating his own problems.  There IS quite a BIG age gap between the two of you, which I believe is the true problem.  There's not a thing you can do about that tho, you knew this when you married one another.  It had to surface at some point in time tho.  I truly don't foresee it getting any better either the older you both get.  In time, he's not even going to be able to get around as well as you.  That's when the BIG problems are really going to start.  You've just got to take everything into consideration, & I definitely believe age is playing the biggest factor in your relationship.  How long you can take it or put up w/it is going to have to be up to you.  After awhile, it's going to get mighty old in more ways than one.  In all honesty, I really don't think things are going to get much better either.  Maybe you just could mention that if he'd at least make an effort to do his best to try to make things better between the two of you, at least that would be an improvement.  I just don't think you're going to be able to take this kind of situation for the rest of your life w/him.  Something or someone has got to give...I DO wish you all the best...:)|`|3iNobwVraa	He is jealous OF you (as in a competition between you two) or he is jealous over you?<br>  <br>  I d/k if mine is jealous of me...never thought about that.  He is definitely, ridiculously, getting way out of hand jealous over me, and it's stupid and mean.  It is unattractive and upsetting, but it has not decreased his sex drive.  Hate sex is awesome, until it's all you have.<br>  <br>  Every marriage has difficulty, but if you think he is competing with you, in an unhealthy way, speak up.  Things have to get better at some point.  Don't they?|`|cxXp1qdQaa	If he can't take the fact that you are more successful then it really won't work....|`|Q6usQV1zaa	HE'S JEALOUS BECAUSE HE CAN'T SATISFIED YOU IN BED|`|ddMlbXdAaa	Nah|`|ce8kACW4aa	I agree with ASD F|`|AA11208683	are you sure he is jealous of you, because in my experience the man is usually just stressed and frusturated that he can't be the one to support you. i would suggest just talking to him and make sure that you let him know that you love him no matter what! kiss him and hug him and tell him that he is your man. he needs the support from you even if you are making more than him, he still wants to feel like a man. i really hope things get better!! GOOD LUCK!
Ki90Irkcaa	Well as long as you have more important things going on I guess not. I mean if you have commitment issues, then that needs to be worked out. But there are some people out there just don't want to be in a relationship and that's fine to. But if you feel deep down inside that you might want to be with someone, and you just have issues with trusting, or there is something from the past or present that may be the reason you don't want to be with anyone; then maybe you should look into dealing with those issues. If not, then F*** it, guys do that sh* all the time. Do you have fun and like you said you are protecting yourself (using condoms and all) so do what makes you happy. No one can determine if you are happy, only yourself.|`|48xxYQsaaa	There really is nothing wrong with not wanting a relationship, if the only thing that your really interested in is sex than that's your deal and people who tell you that it is wrong..well their wrong! No one should ever tell you what is right or wrong when it comes to that kind of stuff.|`|EHVGbev6aa	Its not wrong but one day you will find a guy who you will want to be committed to and it will be for the best!|`|2tn8EALqaa	..."wrong" to who....??|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	It's not wrong at all honey, and in many respects I have similar views as you.

No one says you HAVE TO be in a relationship.  It's all a preference.  Once I too made that decision but after 12 years I got back with a woman I dated in college and that ended my single life.  Chances are it will happen to you too.    Hope this helps.|`|oRr9SOIqaa	Not wrong...but lonely.|`|x02jsjg6aa	No one wants to commit to a person that makes them feel tied down.  When/IF (I do acknowledge that it does not happen for everyone) you meet the right person, it will not feel like you are tied down.  You will in fact feel that they enhance your life and make it more interesting and worthwhile.  You will both support each others' dreams and desires, and enjoy life together.  Relationships don't mean that your life is over- they mean it is just beginning.    Whatever you do is fine, however, you sound unsure about it.  Otherwise, why else would you ask this question?|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Something is wrong with your brain chemestry. See a doctor. Humans are wired to love and if you don't then something is worng.|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	Sure it is okay not to want a long term relationship.  There are people who feel extremely comfortable being by themselves and when they want some attention, they go out and get it.  So, don't worry about what others think, worry about what makes you happy and enjoy life.|`|9ae557afae8c72a2f03fc0f5b4f78564aa	Everyone is different. What is right for one person isn't right for another. There is nothing wrong with playing the field, men have been doing it for years. Just be safe (as you have already said you are) and have fun. I suspect that if the right person comes along, you'll change your mind. Even if it doesn't, there's no law saying that you must get married. People will try and tell you that you should and they will make you feel bad for it, but don't listen. You be YOU, live your life however you want. Just be safe and happy!|`|UHc3Nvaqaa	Sorry to say this cause you seem nice but babe youre headed for the life of a street walker.

WfHfIOSAaa	I have the same exact problem, only my dad never paid child support. Until about six months ago, I hadn't talked to him for eleven years. He wrote me a letter and it kind of snow balled from there. We talk only through letter, mostly because he is temporarily in jail for not paying child support (can you say karma?) I suggest writing him. It's easier to get your true feelings out when no one can interrupt you. Tell him how you feel about him not being in your life and how you feel about wanting to get close to him again. I wish you the best of luck, hon.|`|F47MyGDSaa	If he told you to call, and if you feel okay with the idea of calling, then you should call. I know it might feel awkward, but it might be a great opportunity to talk to your dad again. And how would your mom be setting you/him up? You're the one talking to him, not her, so it's all you. And you should be able to express your feelings for him, whether that's anger, or happiness, and if you'd rather write it in a letter, then go ahead!|`|RDgyb7W8aa	Call him, tell all that has happened throughout the past years.

Raising children is not easy Im guessing you are a teenager believe me if your stepfather was your biological father you guys would be having the same conflicts you do now about adopting you let him and your mother work that out that is adult nonsense you don't need to worry about.  besides you don't need anyone to adopt you this is just temporary when you grow up get your college degree and get married have your own family this won't matter to you remember don't sweat the small stuff. concentrate on school and be your age for a while quit worrying about all of the problems adults get themselves into you can't fix that

h6AH6Biyaa	Can you all move to a place where she'd have a mother-in-law suite, or a small apartment of her own in the same building?    It's common in Costa Rica to create a hedge fence just by poking branches into the ground.  They grow.  In tropical countries they worry about insect damage -- maybe that's the reason for the plastic bags.  In some cultures it's not done to wear shoes in the house -- does she do so?  The shoe thing would drive me nuts.    It's nice of you to let her cook food for herself, and your wife if she'll eat it also.  Perhaps if you got mingy and limited the amount of "ingredients" you had on hand, that would control it a little.  The main thing to worry about, as you note, is spoilage and sanitation.     The only practical suggestion I can think of is to search for any other Indonesian people in your area.  If there are any, they could give your mother-in-law some social life from her own culture, and perhaps clue her in to American ways of doing things.      I see just below on this web page a whole bunch of Answers International sites.  Indonesia is one of them.  Perhaps your wife can help you find some resources there.|`|AA12396274	well i laughed when i read this even though i know it isn't funny to you,but it may be if you read it like it came from someone else.the first thing you should do is tell your wife you can't afford all this wasted food, then help your mother in law find some other hobby,maybe buy her a sewing machine,or make her a little garden space in the yard for herself,she probably knows she is in the way and Cooks to keep herself busy.or just let on like you really love having her there ,you may surprise your self and really like her if you learn a little of her language.|`|lGS1zOd6aa	order a pizza when she is finish cooking|`|djhCah5Maa	That is so funny, but it probably isn't funny for you.

SOv6I9Wfaa	Hi there  The lady who told you to keep your nose out of their separation is wrong. It is your business. Families do not live their lives in boxes: we are all intertwined, and when one members of a family hurts and betrays another, all suffer; and that is how it should be. In betraying your mother he has betrayed all your family bonds. He, perhaps, would like to think that what happens between him and your mother is nothing to do with you; that he can go on being your father as if nothing has happened. Why do we live these days as if we were all so very tenuously connected to one another? I'll come clean: my husband did to me what your dad has done to your mother, and to this day my biggest grief is how my children have, to all intents and purposes, lost the father they loved and respected and thought they knew. The man they now call Dad is someone they love, but no longer trust or believe in. That's a terrible thing to do to your kids.     That said, I have worked hard to keep a positive light shining on my kids' father. Kids need their Dads. You need yours. Yes, it will never be the same, but you'll never have another father, either. If you cut him off now you will regret it; believe me. See him, talk to him, say what you need to say, but keep the lines of communication open. You never know what the future will bring. How would you feel if he got hit by a bus tomorrow? He is your father. Find a way to build a meaningful relationship with him.    I really wish you all the best of luck. You sound like a strong young woman.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Your parent's separation is between them and has nothing to do with you.      It is not your place, nor do you have the right to yell at him about anything relating to the marriage.    If you are upset with him over how he's treated you, talk to him about that.   But keep your nose out of the separation.  It is between him and your mom, not him and you.|`|3Yn5Y03Xaa	Think before you speak to him; how has he treated you over the past five years? does he love you? Then tell him how you feel about everything. Just say it. You shouldn't think to much about what you are going to say.

He made his decision and now you have made one of your own.  Then get up and leave.  Anything else will get too emotional for you.  It won't change the way he feels about your mom or take back any of the hurt but at least he will know why you don't return his calls or answer his letters in the future.  He may realize a little better what he lost to have this relationship.  Best wishes to you.|`|PrqCDZ7raa	sheloves is right.  it is really between him and your mother.

Try to still have a relationship with him.|`|lzooHi0Baa	You should not see your dad until you are good and ready.   Do not expose yourself to pain and be in a position where you do not know what to say and might even say things you'll regret.   Postpone the date for another time.   Your time.   I know it can be very painful.   His love for you is not like his love for your mom.   He loves you regardless and that love remains, take that into consideration.  Do not torture yourself by forcing to see him.    He cannot just come back and demand to see you in your condition at this time.    Tell him you will see him when you are ready.   Good luck

Depending on how good of friends they are then he needs to get his "blessing".|`|FfVipq3Aaa	no not breaking guy code. thou shall not date the ex till 6 months is up. its been a year so shes free game. happy hunting lol
S7iQ9FkGaa	You're in your right to feel this way because you know there's something wrong with that picture, but there's only so much you can do, the rest is up to her (your mother). All you can do for now is to express your concern(s) and let her take it from there.     Best of luck to you!|`|WcIeLbQ1aa	Just tell her everything you wrote., Tell her you're glad that shes smiling again and because you dont want to see that smile ever fading away again you want to let her know how you feel - you dont think her bf is the right one for her.|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Talk to her about trust, feelings and commitment. Then mention his commitment to his wife. I wonder if she trusts him.   Then tell her why your not comfortable with him ..... be censurer and open.      Reassure her you want her to be happy and you just don't wanna see her get hurt.|`|79F1VhEJaa	just talk to her, tell her how you feel about this guy, and  tell her it might not work out. :) good luck.
AAlB49iraa	Sounds like he's an immature loser. Ignore him and see if he he stops pestering you.But if he doesn't.... i hate to say, but sometimes you have to give them some of their own medicince. talk back. tell him to shut his mouth. most of the time people who try to walk all over you and make you miserable do it because you are letting them. Don't take it anymore!!  good luck!|`|K5IOSGXAaa	He is a very immature little boy and you need to just ignore him and his nasty ways. I'm sorry that you have to be in the same vicinity as him and have to put up with his crap. If he ever gets in your face call the cops on him, that will put an end to his nonsense.|`|aIHSmRYwaa	Just ignore him and he will go away.
1Nd4XrjVaa	tell your friends, you woulld rather wait for someone you actually like instead of getting a taste of everyones mouth.    its just slaggyness anyway.      tell them :]  if they think your rare, tell them to deal with it.    have a bit of self confidence .    (: best wishes|`|lHCZUPm2aa	There is nothing wrong with you! It's such a pity that these days it's considered a flaw NOT to be a ****. And if your friends are that narrow minded, trampy, and judgmental, I think it's time to find new friends.|`|509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	don't worry about it.  if they are your real friends, they shouldn't and wouldn't be b----ing about who you go out with, a guy or a girl.  and you shouldn't go out with someone just because your friends say so.  many people have regretted to listen to their "friends."|`|8wU9D1P7aa	Just be who you are...  There is nothing wrong to you... Life is a constant change.  If you think you are straight... then you are.  Never mind them.

Now just relax.. everything's gonna be alright  Everyone experience that...even I.    :D|`|W6zLJ96eaa	you sound like a VERY wise person!   who cares what they think of you. just laugh it off if they ask you about it. it doesnt matter what others think, if you're happy with your sexuality, then that sall that matters.  It's good that you dont snog every guy around, it just means that you have respect for yourself.   if they ask you about being gay, just tell then you're straight, and you dont find that you need to snog around to have a good night out! it'll be fine!|`|brxAJmg5aa	im 15 and my class thinks im a lesbian becuase i was sitting in careers and keith and jason sat behind me and loulou and jason said she had a bf so she was straight nd i didnt have one so i was a lesbian then he told the whole class nd now every1 finx im lesbian.keith then started takin **** n sayin im so into loulou i cant talk to her with out blushing.    blabla bla    basically wa im tryen to say is ur not alone loads of ppl think the same about me.|`|nnqcYoNwaa	ask them what they think you are and if they say that than reassure them that you are not and that you just don't get off on snogging in and everybody.|`|auUeI2Vnaa	If they think you're a lesbian because you aren't as slutty as them, then you need new friends.  Besides, if they would stop being your friend because they aren't tolerant of you sexual preferance, then are they really your friends to begin with?|`|YLgdMXiQaa	There is nothing wrong with being a lesbian. Tell them your not if they ask.|`|lkNJNnlSaa	Not being a sl-ut doesn't make you a lesbo.    Good luck, ignore your mates.|`|cZrrOQyCaa	I feel exactly the same way, except I don't go out clubbing or anyhtig. Never been a girly girl and I think this has a part in it.

They might not understand but it'll clear things up!!!  Well done for being a mature caring person....

As long as you know who you are and are happy, forget gossipy little teeny bopper tramps.|`|mqbrbnCyaa	Well, your icon suggests that you are gay. :)    It's okay, if you know that you are not, then that's all that matters.|`|JNcbYYoraa	Don't make out with people you aren't comfortable making out with just because of what your friends think. If your "friends" are going to talk about you behind your back, they are a bunch of meany-butts.|`|gXt0wdLuaa	no offence but you have wierd friends if they cant be friends with people that are gay. maybe you should tell them what you are tthinking and 'clear the air' a little.|`|cJPOs7Tsaa	Yeah, well snogging is a new one to me.... (you young whippersnappers with your fancy new fandangled words).    Well, don't worry too much. Unless they see you snogging some other female, they have no real reason to believe you're gay. Real friends wont jeapordize a friendship based on presumtions.|`|ZWzj8NbRaa	Dont be scared that your friends think your a lesbian. You know your not and thats fine.  You shouldnt just snog any guy you see. You are more caring than them! So what if they snog 10 boys in one night, doesnt mean you have to be like them. You be who you want to be and they will soon see that once you get a boyfriend, you will then do more snogging. Dont worry about it. Your fine :D|`|ARmhMq5laa	okay so they think lezbos are weird and you think snogging is weird,maybe they are the lezbo's and trying to hide it. anyways, just tell them you're not into that and it's kinda weird for you.  if they can't deal they need to grow up,not everyone is like them and it's prob best you move on you're only 17.|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	And those are excellant friends because?|`|tq6fCjy1aa	Well you are what you want to be. Nobody knows if you are but you and if you are scared to be one you probably aren't one.|`|yvhMspYBaa	confront them, they shouldn't assume your gay coz you don't get off with any randomer you meet  they should look up to you for it:)  x|`|BcSZ4Jidaa	sooooo...you are not a **** and it sounds like your friends are. I am sure they know you are not a lesbian, they just know that they are sluts, so they prolly dont want to hang out with you because they feel crappy about themselves. Good riddens, find some new friends who dont just go clubbing to make out with guys.|`|ZqhaMRFqaa	hey you know things happen people will think what they will   im touchy italian  and alot people think im  gay  and you know what i really dont care anymore   its better now to care because alot people will make up there mind even if they known you for longtime|`|GKINbVhsaa	sounds like you need some new friends. I wouldn't worry about it. And if they really all think that, then they will eventually get over it and forget about it.|`|c5I8JHXgaa	If your friends would drop the title "lesbian" so quick on you because they are easy and you aren't say something about their personalities. They could just be distancing themselves because you aren't the "party type" they could into trouble with. Don't worry about it.|`|490f7ca9675261420e05c48cca7e960baa	Because you don't go "snogging" with everyone around means you have dignity and pride for yourself. and that is something EXTREMELY respectful.  if they think you are a lesbian for this then I don't personally think they are true friends.  I respect you.|`|2c26d8fc94ce0e90f359f38553c9f608aa	I wouldn't be concerned that your friends think you're gay. There is nothing wrong with being gay. Unless you're Christian, in which case, my understanding is you rot in hell. (You may want to consider leaving any faith that tells you this.)    But really, that's not what should concern you.    What should concern you is your inability to use capital letters or punctuation properly.|`|GaLw1qMwaa	so why would you want to be friends with such shallow people?  that means they arent your true friends.    dont worry about what they think. its good that you dont want to "snog"    worry about your education and good luck.|`|5391432c598af97eb451cfd80531a5e3aa	Sounds like you have good morals.  You don't need to get physical with any and everyone to find a guy.  Maybe you need to find a new group of friends if this is what they expect of you.
8XKmMBU7aa	hahah What's your week point ?  I think your week point is main reason for that which you are hiding from us, moreover   I don't find any Joke on this beautiful question.

Have a nice day and nice dream.|`|17aab5400531185eeea85ec13e69a65eaa	It sounds like she's playing up to other people who she thinks will respect her for putting someone else down. I once had a 'friend' who used to do that to me, she would be a nice person when it was just us or on the phone, but then would say sarcastic things about me in front of others.   I decided I was not going to be treated like that anymore and the next time she made a remark I just replied in front of everyone, "does it make you feel clever being a two faced bully? Because you're making yourself look really stupid by making these comments." She never did it again after that.   Showing off by putting others down is a sign of insecurity. This is what she is doing, and the moment you answer her back she will shut her mouth immediately and realise she cannot use you for her own social status.   Be strong and tell her exactly where to go...in front of those who she thinks like her.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	Real friends don't treat their 'friends' that way.  Lose the loser and find real friends.|`|0e33e812d76b8f8fe9810d0893f6e0b7aa	That's not a friend - that's a bi*ch. Cut her out of your life.

k73IxCHaaa	Just remember that boys are just as shy and scared as girls are. He obviously likes you if he's opening doors for you. He's a gentlemen and its my experience that the gentlemen types always need a little prodding.     Use your feminine charms to get his attention, sweet smile and eye contact will enable him to see you from the inside out. While I'm not an expert at this type of thing I'm the oldest of 6 kids all of which were girls. I've dealt with a lot of relationship issues over the years with my sisters.|`|KTB5jwpQaa	next time he opens the door for u, say to him cheekily " thanks, maybe one day ill get to hold a door open for u "  ice is then broke and u can go from there and also see his reaction to it|`|9nTrd7Tnaa	If you're not confident enough in yourself to start a conversation, try something simple like giving him a quick wave on the bus when you think he's looking at you. With any luck, he'll see that you're interested in communicating, and come over. I'm not sure if he likes you or not, he could just be very polite. I think you've got a shot though!|`|uw0Gx8m2aa	U think too much,,,if u like him then talk to him ...He will definitely talk to u !!    Good Luck
AA10942089	Certainly staring out the window won't help matters.    I think it's best to start out talking to him about his interests. Most guys love to talk about themselves. Just ask him what he likes to do or what music he listens to. Get that foot in the door.    As for the nervousness, just take some time by yourself to practice some hypothetical conversations.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	odds are if you sit around waiting, then in a couple months, your going to be on here saying "he asked some other girl out!"      so just muster up all your courage and say "hi, i like you" and let it go from there.     life is too short to spend the rest of your days wondering what if.  if you really want a convo to start, then be the one to start it.  a lot of guys wont cause they are afraid of getting shot down.  he may not even actually be AWARE that you like him, so he definatly isnt going to start a convo with you if he is afraid of getting shot down.  so be brave girl! start the convo yourself!|`|ky3vTCTmaa	Well you could start off my saying hello or a good morning to him when you see him since you seem to see him everyday. and if you are the one starting it, it will be putting the ball in his court so to speak to be the next one to do something or say something.|`|nukcYkR9aa	you are one lucky girl! i think he does!!!!!!!!!|`|aGno0HAwaa	Just keep your target and hit the arrow one day. I will teach you to do that, I did the same. Well look more attractive one day. Put more make-up, like foundation and lipstick, not all over the face powders, it makes us look like clowns. Then talk to your friends different in front of him and show signs you have him in your heart, like drop something in front of him, like near him and wait and see if he picks it up for you. If he does then touch his finger and make your face like your shy and whenever you look at him or find him looking at you, just look down as if your shy not angry. Guys are guys, they will get the target point you hit for them. Good luck to you.    Please answer my recent question on singles and dating.  Q: Why hasn't my dream guy asked me about it? Please answer.|`|KFUsmwItaa	If you really like him talk to him. The worst that could is he doesn't like you. Most likely he does and is probably just shy, just start a normal conversation with him.|`|FyhzmgRUaa	Next time you are on the bus and he is sitting in the next seat right next to you, here are two techniques you can try. 1. write a little note to him thanking him for always holding the door for you. or 2. while writing your note try intentionally dropping your pen or pencil in front of him, making him pick it up and there you go a conversation starter.|`|VWDYRlV0aa	defo|`|xqan4ChSaa	maybe hes trying 2 be nice 2 you as a friend but dont give up just yet keep trying girl be brave!|`|4ZGCGibJaa	Try talking to him a bit more, but he sounds like a sweetheart! Best of luck, girl!|`|vS4LzNPFaa	well its very hard to know because we dont knw u or him  nd theres not dat much detail 2 work with  but theres no way ul eva hav a chnce with him or even knwin the answer unless u talk 2 him  start a random convo...say hi ur near each other on da bus almost evryday.....it wont be awkwrd  its betta not 2 w8 4 him 2 say anythin...he mite be even more shy nd it mite end up being 2 late  gud luck|`|TpK2RHVnaa	I'd talk to him on the bus if I were you.  Ask him about something really broad that is totally easy to talk about (a new movie, something that's going on at school, who he thinks will win an upcoming game or something).    Right now you just sound nervous, but don't worry about it.  Crushes come and go, and if it's meant to be then you'll find out sooner or later.  Just smile and be yourself.|`|TiOsIfi7aa	start talking to him, he sounds like he like you and respect you, so start talking to and tell him you like him cuse if you don't someone else will trust me :))
UHc3Nvaqaa	Honestly babe I hate when girls cake on makeup, for me its the biggest turnoff ever.  For me as little as possible, natural glow.  I dont know anything much about the makeup world but if a girls wearing alot of makeup its a complete turnoff.|`|xEJm0NCiaa	red lips are really hot, not too bright and highy contrasted, otherwise it would look overdone and not good.|`|aIHSmRYwaa	eye liner, a hint of blush, dark eye shadow.|`|JjU6IdnDaa	There are many females who are extremely attractive with natural features who require no makeup to look stunning.  Of course she must be comfortable and confident with her beautiful presence.    It is always best to get to know female without makeup.  This eliminates aesthetic surprises.|`|aZsyxJ5Gaa	well, i think eye makeup is really important...some eyeliner n mascara will make u look great...  n yeah dont forget the lipgloss :)|`|CU7yipOuaa	Eyes!     Depending on how your dressed (i.e. colors) smokey eyes will do the trick- but lips are equally as important.|`|4EJ3Z3hSaa	YES smokey eyes are so hot.  It gives them a mix of cute/sexy and it's just awesome.|`|iufAPDeWaa	Most guys like it natural. Eyeliner and a shiny gloss with or without a hint of color. Thats all I do. Why where alot and then when he sees you without it he may not find you as attractive. Even if he says he does. When you pile on makeup you look pale and weird when its off.|`|tpG1KBj4aa	alot of people tell me i look good when my eyes are like more noticable so like certain types of eyeliner and mascara|`|oOyXJtNvaa	Natural i think.  Abit of foundation, mascara, brown eyeshadow and a SMALL bit of eye liner :)|`|qpt51YeAaa	it depends on the guy and you.  boys are weird with what they like.  ill be like "im putting makeup on" and he'll be like   "Oh, you dont need makeup, you're beautiful anyways"  but then other times, ill get all done up (i have REAL dark eyeshadow and my eyes are huge) and he'll be like "you look pretty today"    i dont think it reaaaally matters though  if he really likes you, he'll think you're pretty regardless.  just like we'd like him whether or not his hair is 'done' or not  hahaha|`|rEBdSRrHaa	Most the guys I know like their girls natural|`|rnqgiRkWaa	the smokey eyes!  of course b.f are going to say to your girl your sexy w.o makeup lol come on   but studies show guys who see girls with smokey eyes makes them more intrigued|`|dduBFkLkaa	well im not  guy...but my boyfriend thinks i look the sexiest without any makeup.....some guys dont like to have their gfs flaws covered up.....hope i helped
CWgJ7Yyxaa	Each relationship is different. Some people can trust again after they were cheated on...but some cannot, no matter how hard they try!    Do what is right for YOU. You are the one who knows how you felt when he left; and you are the one who knows him..We at YA don't.    Personally, I think cheating is terrible. And I would never forgive a cheating husband. (But that is just me. I'm middle-aged and much more self-assured than I was when I was in my 20's.)    Just remember that we should love ourselves first...If we want others to respect and accept us, we have to do that first. If we do not respect or love ourselves, how can we expect others to do so?    Cheaters, liars and abusive men don't change.|`|AA11826328	There are a lot of ways you could look at this, 1st of all if you wanted your child to have a two parent home with the love and everything else what you should have done was wait til you were married and ready to have a child, now let's get back to reality because this happens every day all over the world more than we really know.  As for the relationship part, you & him that is not too easy because you must first learn that there is a difference between forgiving  and forgetting and you have to decide what it is you want from this young man, I mean just because you & he are not in a love affair do that mean that he can not be apart of the baby's life?  what you are feeling for this guy is indeed very confusing for you because you are full of emotions right now and yes they are all connected to this young man. A lot of times young men do go through things when a young lady gets pregnant to they are afraid as well, I am not saying this to make an excuse for his cheating but, it is something heavy for him as well and they sometimes run and do dumb things, So as for the part of forgiving him of the cheating it's up to you, do you think that you will ever trust him again? has he always been the type who cheats? has he always found ways to hurt you even before you got with baby? those are some of the things you need to think about.    But then there is the situation with the baby, he is the father which means he to have to help in the taking care of this child, he needs to be a part of the baby's life as well, regardless if you two work out as a coulpe or not. you did not get pregnant by yourself so it's not right that you have to try to be a father and a mother to this child, I do not know what the future holds nor do you but, what I do know is that you will not be happy if you don't even give this guy a chance at being a parent and then you will have to explain to your child when they ask where daddy is and why YOU kept them a way from each other....  Food for thought.....Good Luck....LIL Angel|`|vV77Pv1vaa	you dont, PERIOD, you're a damn fool if you forgive anyone for cheating , EVEN ONCE, if you do, then dont complain of your miserable relationship and life with that person, cus you'll only have YOURSELF to blame,....period, end of story!!!|`|byBY2vpGaa	I think you answered your own question in the last line - you can't trust him.   For that alone you should move on.  You are not your parents so forget that.  You will bring up your child as best as you can like they did but under different circumstances.  Eventually you will find a man that will love you and your baby and you can trust him.   Liars and cheaters rarely reform, don't look back.|`|21Wk2mu5aa	Well you have to make a choice and stick to it. If you decide to give him another chance then you will have to choose to trust him and not throw this up in face all the time. Maybe he just got scared with the baby and all and it will not happen again now that he is ready to accept you and the baby.     But if you are done, then you are done. Don't stay because people say you should or for the baby's sake.     Just don't deny him and the baby a relationship if you decide you don't want one yourself.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Easy and logical answer don't take him back you deserve better. And not that he knows what he did in the past and you two got back together its just a matter of time that he'll do it again and he will just a matter of when. Why would you even consider taking him back at all, you think that he is the best you can do then take him and his girlfriends back and the future ones that are coming. Its sad to say you need to be strong especially for your baby its not all about you anymore.|`|M4X3HOV5aa	It will take a long time for you to be able to trust him. You should definately let him be a part of your life for the sake of supporting you and your child, but it doesn't mean you have to have a romantic relationship with him. You need to make him earn your trust and the right to be in a relationship with you.|`|L38M9lrLaa	im going thru the exact same thing right now...give him another chance so atleast you can say you tried...trust takes time|`|PyUDK9IGaa	follow your hearts you will do whats write|`|OBCvewW2aa	I don't see what the tragedy is in being a single mother.  I'm a single mother and I seem to be a lot happier than these married bozos around me.  I'm a product of a single mother and so is our president.  It's no great tragedy, believe me.  In fact, there's a certain freedom in it.    I hope you can make your decision with that in mind.|`|uetenAeRaa	only if you can live with his cheating.  you can be co-parents and not  be together.      good luck.|`|GzL8X6vTaa	If you wanted your child to have a family then you should have knew the man a little better before you let him knock you up.    Or you should have done the right thing and got married first instead of reproducing out of wed lock.    Leave him alone and play the best role. Mom and dad all in one.|`|ltw2rfwnaa	You'll eventually forgive, but you will never forget.|`|uGFzzLYWaa	Maybe you can forgive him, but WHY would you ever trust him again?     He's a cheater, and that's what they do. Your life will be filled with sadness and stress if you take him back. You do not need a man like this in your life.   Dump the prick and raise your child. There is no shame in being a single mother, and  your child will not miss having a father as long as you are strong enough to be both.|`|AA11328507	If you can not forgive him..do NOT take him back.  He cheated so there is no need for you to feel guilty.  If the only way he can be a decent father is if your his galfriend then I say do not take him back.      Your child can and should be able to benefit from both parents even if they are not a couple.  Do not take him back for ANY other reason other than YOU want to be with him.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Only God can truly forgive. The best we can hope for is the ability to live with a mistake and very few can do that. Staying together for the babys sake is only a disaster waiting to happen. From what youve written, its time for you to move on from him. Sue him for child support but let him go. You will never fully really trust him, which will only lead to more fights and problems in the future which wont be good for you or your baby. Dont worry so much about what others say as youre the one who has to live with him otherwise if hes so good let them have him. You now have to do whats in the best interest of your baby and then you and this guy has no ones best interest at heart. So time has come for a serious decision but personally feel that you need to move on here. Congrats on your baby and good luck

Maybe getting out would do you some good, hanging with a good friend. I'm sure it will get better once you a bit older.|`|zlQo7WMoaa	Life is what you make it, lots of people have strict fathers. Talk to him and tell him he needs to stop being so strict. Everyone has worries and problems, but you should try and be optimistic and life will become more enjoyable. If you are actually depressed you should see a doctor, and hopefully he/she will be able to help. Good luck.|`|79F1VhEJaa	you should take some pills for depression, they might help, or just hang out with your friends lol|`|ZaMzRSrraa	WHEEEEEEEN YOU MOVE OUT AND GET YOUR OWN LIFE!    IT WILL BE LIKE A BREATH OF FRESH AIR!        look for a job/save money/get a roomate if you have to/ move out!!|`|ejJD6BBXaa	hey i kn how u feel if u want u can call or txt me @ 727-798-6076 and i can try an help i have the same thing ok so call or txt
KILFoc6kaa	Once again GROW UP and make up your own stuff, Trolls who are lazy are not funny.|`|29hcn9JRaa	To put it bluntly, as a woman ages her fertility begins to decrease, basically the older the woman becomes the more prone she is to a high risk pregnancy, many women in their late 30's also find it more difficult to conceive, for her to even claim that she can become a mother at 60 or 70 is flat out foolish, and a far cry from realistic. Myself personally would never even consider having a child at 40, which is my age right now, but my god, look at the risks, the risk for downs-syndrome sky rockets as you age, to be honest it really sounds like your wife has no desire to have children, and if she waits any longer it will be quite risky, my opinion is if you don't have a child with her within the next year, forget it. If your desire to have a child out weighs your love for your wife, then maybe you may want to consider finding someone who A- wants children, B- is not to old to have children and enjoy them, these are two huge things you should have considered prior to getting married, don't ya agree?|`|vV77Pv1vaa	you' shouldve had this worked out BEFORE you got married.    if its that important, divorce her, there are PLENTY of women out there ready for families,.|`|1hsOl8Idaa	Sorry to say but, I think you are better off not having children with her.   A woman who says "someday" has no intentions or desire to have kids. And having them because you want them is not the kind of mother any kid deserves. To be a mom takes, devotion, selflessness and passion... its not like agreeing to a puppy just to shut someone up!     10 years? She will be 47! Hello Menopause! And do you want to spend $$ on repo docs and invitro?     It was a mistake not to clarify your plans for a family with each other. Couples should be clear on their 5 year, 10year plans.     You should move on and persue your family! Life is too short to wait!|`|ylDHOIp1aa	look have u ever watched a movie in this same situation she is in her prime at work life a kid will stop and halt every bit of that for her . she might want kids in her later future but more than likely it is just a way to prospone haveing any kids at all . i know u might love her but i would  find a girl with the same life out looks as me your age dont help u much. remember one person in the world loves work 1st family last and one person familys 1st  work second (me im a family man)|`|bQR2Ld7Eaa	SHE WAS LYING!!! You either want kids or you don't! EVERY WOMEN and most men know, that after age 30 it becomes harder to have healthy children and by the age 35, it becomes risky for women to have kids!    Your wife DOESN'T WANT KIDS!!! She is just putting the issue off until it is completely IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE CHILDREN! Your wife only wants her career, she NEVER actually planned on having kids with you. By the time your wife reaches the age of 47 she will most likely BE UNABLE TO HAVE CHILDREN. Most likely she will be going through menopause by age 45.    If you want to have children, your going to have to find someone else... Brad Pitt had to and look how he and Angie have turned out.|`|96HWpdkFaa	Waiting that long is not to healthy...alot of women who wait till they are around 40 have alot of problems. Older men don't have this issue as much as women do. Their egg quality gets worse and the chance of having a child with problems is more likely. Not always but also she may have problems and need medication and you may end up having to spend alot of money on it. Ask her if she really even want's kids....tell her you want a family before 10 years. If she doesn't theres nothing you can really do. But it's proven that women have a harder time the older they get.|`|PyUDK9IGaa	some people poke a whole in the condom dont do this. follow your hearts you will do whats write|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	Waiting another 10 years will bring her to 47 yrs old.  Her chances of conceiving then are very slim... not unheard of, but slim.  I have to wonder that deep down, she really does not want to have children, and she wants her career to be first....and yes, it is possible that she has lied to you about this.  It's your decision about what action you want to take as a result of her not wanting children.  I guess you both need to sit down and lay your cards out on the table.  If she really does not want children, and you do....then..... you have your answer.
2JJLYSAKaa	Altruism is the selfless concern for the welfare of others.  What does this have to do with dumping these acquaintances?      I think this is self preservation.  You have your reasons for ending these relationships that you thought were intrusive and don't have any reason to feel any remorse.  Why would these acquaintenances be hurt?  I don't understand.
uBssj3Znaa	it is very rude to text on your date. You are basically showing him you are not interested in him and would rather be talking to whoever is texting you.|`|iufAPDeWaa	Yes. Don't text anyone you can tell her after the date. Otherwise you'll just be telling her how you text her the entire time and your date got annoyed. Now, thats not an interesting story is it? And its a BIG turn off.|`|zQQd2wPRaa	Clearly you don't need to be dating someone that acts rudely. Yes it is rude.|`|6xHOa3tJaa	its very very rude to text  well on a date|`|8pw8qDjPaa	well all attention should be focused on your date. and i might make if feel uncomfortable as if you're texting someone about your date (which you are!) or you're texting another guy. just tell him its only your sister and keep it minimal (when he goes to the bathroom or when you do or something)|`|oOyXJtNvaa	Your sister needs a social life.  And you need to stop being rude!|`|HJrTuihcaa	its VERY rude! wait until your home!|`|dduBFkLkaa	it kinda is....it makes them think ur not intersted!!!!    try to save the finger typing till AFTER the date|`|AA11083274	It's one thing to send a text or 2, but something totally different to just keep texting someone.  Especially early on a lot of girls have an arrangement with a family member or friend that they will text an hour into the date to let them know everything's ok.|`|xEJm0NCiaa	ofcourse it is, err, i bet you feel kinda guilty.|`|AldevmIhaa	yeah its rude,, thats like txtn at the dinner table, that shows that you have no manners and alot of ppl tend to find it very disrespectful|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	Yes it's rude. I doubt that he will be taking you out much more. You should know this with out even asking.|`|AdIrjmV7aa	I'd dump you in a minute if you did texting when we were out together. You are crude and rude.  Maybe you should date your sister.|`|Ki90Irkcaa	If its about business (with me it usually is), then you excuse yourself and ask to take the call or text. When its your little sister calling you to get details on your date, then its immature, and its going to turn your date off. When two adults go on date, there is just a silent agreement and both parties just know not to answer the phones. That's just common courtesy.|`|GjBRwZsEaa	Yes, very. Unless it's extremely important.|`|evpqG9gnaa	Yes!  Extremely rude.  If you need to update your sister do it in the bathroom.  Texting in front of him looks like you are bored and not interested.  Think of how you would feel.|`|63W7noRpaa	It's SO rude, yeah.|`|HiNswxALaa	It's really rude. It makes your date think you not that into them. Wait until after the date to text.|`|H9ojBtl9aa	Yes!!|`|1kfKiw1Jaa	It is very rude.  Almost as bad as taking calls.  Tell your friend to wait until you get home from the date to hear all the juicy details.  If you two keep this texting during your dates up, you won't have many more dates to text during!
Uib2Lmywaa	I know exactly what you are going through. I used to get very nervous and stutter also. My face didn't turn red though. It took me forever to grow out of it. <br>  <br>  Practice reading out loud. Also, when called on to read out loud, say something like.. "Please bear with me, I get nervous reading out loud and stutter, and my face turns red"  Laugh it out and others won't laugh at you, they'll laugh with you. It might make you feel less nervous.
ysDzTEwAaa	It's fine, a little short but still fine.  Add in a reason and I think It'll be great..|`|Kx2P8Hikaa	To be honest, this letter sounds like it is only talking about sex. And you sound pretty desperate while your at it. Perhaps you should include more of your true emotional feelings and somehow imply (in a nice way) that you don't want him to see anyone else. Maybe it will help if you tell him you won't be seeing anyone else either. And maybe if you write grammatically correct he will take you a bit more seriously. For example, don't use words like "cuz" or "hookup". Trust me, men wont take you seriously when you talk like that.|`|kp0QYdb9aa	tell him how you feel and that you prefir him not to, say im not ganna hook up with anyone and i also hope you dont. i really like you and hope that can think about it, well have fun anyway..ilove you and be carefull    say something like. its pretty good|`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	you really need a spell check, that's all I'm saying|`|Ke7eHQTRaa	whats your question|`|QE2GKQWkaa	He is not your hubby, don't tell him to not hook up with anyone. If he really likes you, then he won't and he will save himself for you and only you.|`|7ES4xMloaa	ok that whole thing was you telling him not to do it despite you saying in the letter that you are not. i suggest you tell him that you will be waiting faithfully for his return and you hope he will do the same. you dont need to elaborate that point more then just once. he may find you clingy if you send this in its current form.|`|aIHSmRYwaa	if he isn't your boyfriend, then he isn't your boyfriend. End of story.|`|ufsUDN8Naa	add in the note what u feel about him e.g. if you love him tell him you do and that mite be the biggest reason u dont want him to go off with some one else|`|RncUc0traa	it sound childish|`|2wBuWSFoaa	add more to it  tell him y u wouldnt want  him to hook up with another girl  tell him that u still like him and if he feels the same about u then he should wait for u     wait.....  if he isnt ur bf, then what is he??|`|nWGgaQdhaa	seriously... are you guys just play partners??? you need to add a reason, and tell him why you feel that way...|`|JH2GqpA2aa	I think many things of it, it looks as though you really care and are sweet, but if he's loyal he should stick with you and if he wants to love you.|`|aGno0HAwaa	I like the way you wrote the letter. If I were you, I would write the same. It shows you love and care for him a lot. If he really is a nice guy then he will sure keep it in his mind and listen to you. Send him letters like thrice in a week, so you come to know he is not hooked up with anyone and if he responses you only. Good luck.    Please answer mine, the recent question on singles and dating.  Question: Why hasn't my dream guy asked me about it? Please answer|`|EHVGbev6aa	He aint your bf and he used you for your benefits! HA HA sucks for you. He is gonna hook up with any girl he can. HA HA your a sucker!!|`|15b982f321a32c684f16cd6a17832f31aa	well, if he's not "technically" your boyfriend, then don't worry about it.  The note you've started will make him feel like you're trying to control him, and guys hate that.  But, if he feels the same way for you, you shouldn't have to ask him.  He should do it without you telling him to.  If he does hook up with someone while he's gone, then he's not worth it.|`|hxhZez7caa	thats the worst letter i have ever seen..make it more caring and sweet...be like...    i know that your going to school pretty far away and i will really miss you. I really hope you dont find somebody because i have feelings for you, i not trying to tell you not to but im jut asking you from my heart not to.     idk if you like it or not?     (:|`|vf26zg01aa	I really think this is a conversation you should have in person...  Not a letter.|`|lPvJI2mNaa	nooo don't send that! Talk to him, call him at least. Letters are for writing good things, sweet things! If you guys aren't dating, then you have no right to tell him not too hook up with any girls. If he really likes you, you'll just have to trust him not to. Even if he does, just look past it. If he really likes you, he won't get into anything serious. Yeah, if your really really worried, talk to him, don't send it in a letter, cause he'll take it all wrong. Just trust me on that one.|`|DBjpDffHaa	if u really lik eand  dont want him to go out with other girl then become his girl. tell him in the letter how u really feel about him and hopefully he does two.
ejJD6BBXaa	idk but the only one i can talk to wen i need help is the LORD mb u should pray ab ur problem good luck and god bless there is alot of what these ppl dont kn ok i wish u wouldcall so i can explain plz 727-798-6076|`|k73IxCHaaa	Actually you can still talk to her, she just won't be able to talk to you. Start a "Dear Mom", dairy and tell  her your thoughts. Sometimes when we put things in writing they gave us an opportunity to really think about them. I'm sorry your Mom is no longer here, but your life must go on, she would want it that way.|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	You can still talk to her. Just because she's dead doesn't mean she left you. Talk to her when your alone talk to her and let her know. She can't really respond but she can hear you out and you've gotten advice for so long now that you should be able ot hear what she'd be wanting to tell you, you just have to listen.|`|6uRYYQz6aa	You can still talk to your mom, i know it sounds crazy.  But shes still in your heart, mind and soul. And your in hers eternally, you can talk to her openly and think about what she would say or/and do.     good luck to you, and sorry for your great loss  x|`|DGgVNycgaa	You can still talk to her - You can talk to her every night, or every morning, or whenever you have a free 5 minutes. She is still with you - She just isn't in her physical body anymore.    I think it gets easier, I hope it gets easier.|`|S7iQ9FkGaa	Wow! That is indeed a tough question to answer. First of all, my condolences. No rush, take your time (time heals all wounds).     Take care.|`|ivsYJPx3aa	I'm so sorry ...go to a aunt or to a trusted friend and make sure she knows how you feel about that.|`|sEq75g5Zaa	Sorry, your gonna have to find someone else. I can relate to you. My Dad passed away back in June. There really isn't a replacement...it's not the same.|`|tzNqAWhdaa	Ok my mom died also, and about the only thing you can do that might could do that would be comforting is to go to her grave and just talk to her like she was sitting right there now you know of course she won't talk back but it might be comforting just sitting there and you talking about whats been going on in your life you know she is probably up there listening to you and watching over you. I hope this helps, try it you won't know if it helps or not until you try it. Good Luck and my prayers are with you|`|uw0Gx8m2aa	Everybody passes away wen time comes,,,it will be difficult for some months or years then u will be normal again ...    stay cool|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	How about a long time friend of your mother ... a stand in.. so to speak.  A grief counselor may help.|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	Talk to her anyway. I still talk to my partner who died October 2007. Don't get answers but makes me feel better.|`|ZOakpNy7aa	Talk To Her. She is There She Will Hear You.  as your talking remember similar conversations that the 2 of you shared in the past. Remember the advice she gave,  Or the look on her face. And when you have told her what you needed to. you will know what to do. You will know your Mom guided you through it. And you will know she was there and she heard you. It took me along time and alot of feeling like I was all alone, Before I relized My Dad was still there- Is still there for me.
YVVK3ELTaa	I advise you to talk to your brother. it is not in in order for him to be doing this to you. I suggest you change your email, and don't tell him the address, he clearly can't be trusted. It's quite sad that you have to do all of this, considering it's your brother :(.  Also, don't let him get away with it, tell him how you feel, he has put your relationship at stake. Get him to talk to your girlfriend, if he doesn't, the only thing you could possibly do is gain her trust again. Do something really nice, something extremely romantic, not necessarily out on a date, you can bring it home too. The cheapest things can be the most romantic.  Besides, if your partner has no reasons to be 'snooping' i think she ought to question herself and her trust in you in the first place.  Good luck, and PLEASE don't let your brother get away with this, he could do worse damage in the future, talk to him rationally. xx|`|qK8wcP2Aaa	ok first & most importantly, CHANGE your email acct. PASSWORD.    then, talk to your brother, ask him to stop messing around.    GF: try to explain once more. ask your brother to explain too.|`|Ypgmrrsaaa	I think you should ask your brother to explain o her that this is a joke between you guys and that you have nothing to do about it...And about her opening your mail without your permission is a matter of curiosity she just wants to know what is going on with you and i believe that this is a sign she didn't trust you in the first place..im sorry to say this..but ask your brother to explain everything to her and you can change your passwords and stuff and give them to her so you can prove to her that you are trust worthy and that she is the only one with your password...Good Luck|`|A7lghafHaa	dump her  AND  dump your brother    there are plenty of fish in the sea|`|GbDAfs5Yaa	Ask your brother to talk to her if in fact it really is your brother that is doing this and not you looking for an out.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	There is nothing you can do, if your brother cant behave himself he deserves some aggro from you.  He needs to confess to your gf that he is the one that is doing all of this and not you, of course if will take some convincing and if she does not believe him what can you do ?  I would just love a brother like that, he is so so jealous of you.|`|58WCrqe1aa	Kill your brother. Sever his head. Take it to your girlfriend and show her and then she'll see how pissed you are at him and she'll think that you must have been telling the truth.|`|T4wiqMRWaa	if she dont trust u she shuldnt be wiv u and u shuldnt be wiv her.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Make your brother confess to her, even if you have to beat his *** to get him to do so. He sounds like he needs an *** beating anyways, tell your parents and get him in trouble if you have to. As for your girlfriend, well, she has issues. If she says she doesn't trust you, then tell her you don't trust her either and see what happens - she may be hiding something from you and is getting on you because she actually feels guilty about something she did wrong. Dude, you wouldn't believe how often this happens.|`|4YPseFSIaa	she should trust you i mean big deal, your girlfriend needs to grow up.  if she dont stop acting like this she'll lose you.  and plus its not like you subscribed to it and all guys look at porn even if you werent she needs to understand that.|`|GKINbVhsaa	its her own problem if she doesn't trust you. Maybe she was lied to by someone in the past and she's afraid you will be that same way. Tell her if she can't learn to trust you then you don't think it will work, cause it wont.    sorry to break it to you.|`|kItRaRmlaa	talk to her    my bf and i hv high standards and agree porn iS UNFAITHFUL and disrespectful..    she respects herself, good for her|`|Zn7NNavKaa	looks like your snooping girlfriend is the one that can't be trusted(unless you have been caught cheating on her before?) if not tell her one more time it wasnt you(i have no porn accounts and still get porn emails) if she cant believe you and move on you should move on
vf26zg01aa	Ah, to be 17 again... I would say if you can email him, just be honest.  Tell the him deal about being in trouble and let him know that you aren't avoiding him.  If he really likes you he'll understand.  And if he doesn't understand he's not worth the trouble.  Simple as that.

UHc3Nvaqaa	Ok, that sounded like I was reading erotica.  Anyway unless he "came" on you theres only one answer, its your breast milk.  Remember your "bodacious bahama mamas" dont have a security system to know whether or not a baby or a grown man is sucking on those.  So basically your dude (husband? boyfriend?

KTB5jwpQaa	its like a vicious cirlce, the more u love them the more ur scared to lose them, but the being scared part is the part that may cause u 2 lose them eventually. Just relax, have as much fun as u can together and be the best girl u can possibly be, then even if eventually u did split, u can be sure he will be back fairly sharpish when he realises the grass is no greener on the other side.|`|k73IxCHaaa	I'm sorry, did you say "you were not insecure". This guy hasn't done anything to cause this and you're having these thoughts. If this is not insecurity I don't know what is. You're fooling yourself and really need to get realistic about what is and what is not insecure behavior.    I kind of feel sorry for this guy, if he even looks at another women, you're going to go crazy. And trust me if something does happen you'll get over it. I realize that at 22 years old love is pretty strong. I cried for three days after my 1st love left me, and to be honest it took me over 2 years to get over her, but I did get over her. So be confident in your love for this man, give him an opportunity to love you for who you are and get on with your life.|`|TaJWZ96paa	Go throw some cold water on your face and get a hold of your self.

YYvPR9pFaa	Well little lady, the first thing I need to tell you is the fact, that he IS TOO OLD! I know, that age doesn'tt matter if you fall in love, but it does, when you're a teenager under 15 and he's an adult, 8 years older that you.     Probably will suprise you, but I think he didnt want you in the first place. He sees you as a friend, maybe a flirting object. I mean, he's a man, and every man wants to feel, that he's atracttive in some way.     You should act your age and find a nice, 13-15 years old boy, 'cuz -as many girls can never understand- as much as you want the older ones, the older ones only care about the older, that they are. For example, you wanna date a 16 year old, but he wants to date a 17 year old. It's a  difficult matter, that can never be solved. Anyway, I think you should stop worrying about him and start worrying about yourself. Find a boyfriend, live your life and maybe, when you're 22, you'll understand what I'm saying here|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Can you spell F-E-L-O-N-Y.   Do you understand the concept of ten years in prison, and a lifetime registration as a child molester?    Under all the states laws, you are a minor, therefore a child protected by law, and a twenty-two year old male who gets involved with a minor is really risking his entire life and career.    If you really care about him, and I think you do, stay away from him and don't tempt him.  This is the greatest form of love at your age you can show him.  Protect him.|`|7tLDdtqGaa	he will use you for sex if you let him, then you'll never hear from him again. seriously. 22 year old guys are not interested in 14 year old girls for anything other than sex.|`|OcISFpRdaa	he wants you for one thing and one thing only... sex|`|5G7YWzTGaa	Just 4get him he is to old 4 you|`|vRImZ32Maa	Sorry, but it seems like he doesn't seem interest in you that way, and you shouldn't be for goodness sake you are 14, what the hell do you know about Love?  The way he is also acting means that he knows that he gave you a wrong impression, he doesn't want to be with you like that...|`|KTB5jwpQaa	its honestly your age and inexperiences that are making u feel u like him, its totally normal but u cant be with someone of that age and even more so, he cant be with someone of ur age! stay friends and leave it there :)|`|zswnT2ovaa	I'm not sure that you're feeling in love if you've only spoken to him once or twice. You're probably just very attracted to him.    I'm sure he's not delibarately ignoring you, but if he's got cancer he's got a lot in his mind and might not be thinking about a relationship with anyone. Try just being a friend and supportive of him,a dn see what happens.
WAktMXaVaa	First, it doesn't matter who the kids live with.  The government looks at who spent the most money on them during the year.   You can ALWAYS claim your kids on your income tax.  All you have to do is KEEP RECEIPTS for all you spend on them....that includes proof that you gave her/them money.  (LIke cancelled checks.).  If you give her cash, get a receipt ! !   The person who can prove that they contributed MORE than anyone other individual always gets to claim them on their income tax.  (Note:  other people can not "get together" and add  all their expenses together to total up  more than you spent during the calendar year)  THE INDIVIDUAL WHO SPENDS MORE ON THE KIDS EACH YEAR IS LEGALLY ALLOWED TO CLAIM THEM ON THEIR INCOME TAX.  THAT'S THE LAW REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE KIDS LIVE.  Hope that helps.  Make sure  you keep receipts every year.  Even if TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE both  claim the kids on their taxes, the person who has receipts that they spent the most is always honored by the IRS as the legal claimant.  Remember  another thing, when she adds up her yearly income, she can only claim 2/3 of that for the kids.  One third has to be claimed for herself.  But that's her problem not yours.  The person who contributes LESS and includes the kids on their tax return will get nailed for filing a false return.  If you do claim your kids, KEEP AND SAVE THOSE RECEIPTS for at least several years in case you have to prove it at a later date.|`|dGM6JGqdaa	She is doing something illegal to collect more money on earned income so she can get money back, but you can do the same thing legally if you worked, but only one person can claim the children !|`|1hciyvKdaa	The law states who the child lives with more than half the year is the person who can legally claim. She must pay taxes on all the money you paid her child support with. You must claim all monies given to her for the record but you will not be taxed on that money, as your payroll taxes were already taken. No matter what happend between you two in the past, start fresh and legal this year. You can call the IRS and ask about this or use the free file to see what I am talking about.|`|sDHxandWaa	OMG. Learn punctuation and spelling, rewrite this question, and maybe you'll get some answers. Jeez.|`|uetenAeRaa	i'm sorry but what?|`|Bc4udMhUaa	Call the IRS immediately. You can only claim your child if you have had physical custody and the child staying with you at least 50% of the time. If you don't meet that criteria you can do nothing about your wife's father's claim.    good luck|`|svzGz9STaa	If you are legally divorced, the divorce papers should say who has primary custody. The IRS considers the person with primary physical custody to be the one who can claim the child. So unless your divorce papers say that you can claim the child, you cannot.|`|3KyVMVncaa	what?? If im understanding this correctly, you want to claim your two kids for 2008 taxes, but they were living with their mom in 2008? I dont think you can claim them if they weren't living with you. If they are this year, then next year when you do your 2009 taxes you can claim them. Good luck and try to learn how to type better.|`|A8k9NHigaa	You could file a claim with the IRS, but that of course could get her father in a lot of trouble with them. But my question is are you filing your income taxes with your ssn or with a tax pin number? If you are filing it with the pin number then you will not get near as much money back.|`|TawyLobZaa	This may not have been a marriage situation, but if so, this should have been worked out during the divorce, and whatever the divorce/custody papers say about who claims the children are what you have to do, regardless of who is working when.  If there was never a marriage, then legally for the IRS, the child or children have to live with you for at least 6 months out of the year for which you are claiming them, so if they live with their mom, you cannot claim. Of course, your ex's father is not supposed to claim them either, if they do not live under his roof for 6 months of the year.
PyUDK9IGaa	yes they will but follow your hearts you will do whats write|`|21Wk2mu5aa	Yes they can, so you should be up front about your debt. If you are working on paying it off, the collection agencies shouldn't come after either of you.|`|M4X3HOV5aa	they can only go after you if they are joint accounts. if they are not in your name then they cannot.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	They will go after the persons whos name appears on the bill. So no they won't.|`|Bc4udMhUaa	yes, they can go after your spouse. But they won't if you are always paying your bills on time and the requested amount. If you go delinquent then they will do whatever they need to get paid.|`|svzGz9STaa	They can only go after the person who's name is on the debt. Unless he's listed, they can't go after him.|`|YyVGXt83aa	Yep, my ex owed for student loans and food stamps and I ended up paying from the refund from the taxes I paid.|`|uetenAeRaa	depending if the state that you live in is community property or not.
5uFXCBpraa	Find another man.  This will result in nothing but heartbreak.|`|k73IxCHaaa	No, the real question is "what the hell's wrong with Jill and why is she doing this to herself". Ok, so there's three reasons why he doing this to you. 1) He's not into you 2) He has someone else and you're his insurance policy or 3) He's not into you.     Ok an insurance policy is when a guy is with someone but he's not totally sure that the relationship will eventually work out. He has another women on the side (nothing physical), that he can use as insurance in the event the relationship that he is in doesn't work out.    This guy has been pretty honest with you and told you that he's no good for you (get a clue), at least he's better than most and has warned you. Now I know if a women told me that, yes, I would still pursue her, but I'm a guy, you know the old hunter instincts surface. To me its just a game of getting what I can't get. I'm only going to get emotionally involved up to a point. But I'm certainly not going to get my heart broken and I'm certainly not going to let her used and abuse me.    Jack may or may not be messing with your head (and your heart as far as that goes), but you need to put this entire thing in perspective before you go down the path of heartbreak and abuse.    Good Luck|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	Obviously Jack is leading you on. It's been 6 years and he doesn't try to come see you. Uh.... no. Break it off. I'm sorry, but seriously I don't know of a guy that is willing to be with a girl for 6 years and not see her, unless she is the "other" woman that he has on the side.    Sounds like your being played. He even told you that he doesn't want a serious relationship "don't fall in love withe me", "I'm a mess and no good for you". Translates to "I don't want you to get attached to me, just be dirty with me and we'll go our own ways".|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	So .. if I understand this ...your upset because Jack got off, before you could respond ....?    Guys are like that, take the goodies and run.    Really talk to him, people have good and bad days.|`|bYjercAqaa	He's married, and his wife either almost, or did, catch him.|`|NEazdZWwaa	This guy is hiding something from you, be it his age, relationship status, etc.  You are his "cybersex" toy, and unfortunately, that is all you can or will be to him. He is not going to dump his wife, or gf ort whoever for you, and if he does, do you think he can and will remain faithful to you.  The best thing you can do is to dump him now, before you get hurt even more, and tell him to take a flying leap.|`|KTB5jwpQaa	if u have never met jack and its a phone/net relationship then jack has someone else in his life|`|uw0Gx8m2aa	EASY.....    He's busy and don't have enough courage to love u..    look at the stars wonder well...the light goes on he will see u soon with a good mind..!
TaJWZ96paa	You need to stop and smell the roses before they die.  Nothing is worth more than your family and if you're losing it in your mind then you can't share the good times with them so stop, look and listen before you end up crossing the road (so to speak). Seek the Lord. He is waiting for you to talk to Him.|`|8056ecfab04b38bab36a2a73cb0e65fdaa	sounds like my situation..got a daughter whose 24 and no job..try to help her in every way i can ..my husband(step-dad) thinks shes taking me for a ride....shes an alcoholic too...and loves to be hurt by her friends but goes right back to them..having difficulty making him understand that she needs help and i cant throw her out of the only place she feels secure,but I CANT handle it anymore and don't know what to do..my husband and i r having problems with this only and thats the only thing we fight about...if you get any answers please notify me or answers...they can help us both..just be strong for your self and understand the meaning of love|`|90oDPtNzaa	You sound like you are too focused around everyone but...YOU! You definitely need some time out for yourself and in a good way..make a list of things you would like to do whether it be a pamper for yourself ..or a shopping trip but get into a healthy mode of thinking for You...Everyone around you has to respect you for that much...You have forgotten yourself through everyone...The most important piece of the pie will always be you and never ever forget that!|`|FIV3ClQsaa	you are not losing your mind but i think you are trying to do too much on your own and you feel like noone can do the jobs that you do any better.in the end you are overwhelmed and its too much for you.you are also not giving yourself time at all -in other words you are burning out.Learn to let go and trust your husband to do some of the things around the home-allow him to make mistakes as well its ok.Give yourself time to do the things that you want in life-if you are happy everyone will be happy.

vI8u9bDXaa	i personally think she doesnt really care but she also may have some feelings toward you... have fun... breast... touching... o.o|`|sDHxandWaa	I dunno what she feels, but if I were her I would have smacked the **** out of you by now. Just because she has boobs doesn't mean you gotta rub all over em like a pervert you sick freak.|`|r3jfodBUaa	if she let you touch them she likes you ask her out sometimes|`|maH06XLNaa	She probably likes it, which is why she isn't saying anything.|`|6rOJZxxSaa	she probably doesnt care... what were you doing for a half hour?|`|dQCZDAqgaa	that is extremely perverted.|`|hW9PPCBbaa	I'd think it was outright disgusting and inappropriate, seriously, who wants some dirty, (probaly old) peodfile of a man touching them in place noone but their husband/boyfried would touch. And if this is true its an utter disgrace and I would give you one hell of a kick in the balls.|`|gXldpzCFaa	ok she probably likes you go for it|`|4ab39422c7923ec245fd8bc42df199c9aa	Just motorboat those puppies.  Go big or go home|`|uulh9ov1aa	she is probably aroused but too shy to act on it.|`|5MkwIq6Jaa	first of all, you are a pervert.    second of all, she probably feels disgusted and she should know you are doing it intentionally. if I were her i'd report you.|`|vRImZ32Maa	Seriously dude, ask her out. If a girl lets your touch her breasts it is big... (No not as in her breasts, but as in feelings...)    Oh yea a comment to some of the people here, what is wrong with you? Touching someones breasts when they let you is not disgusting, even when you have sex we touch your breasts is it then disgusting?|`|0L3tqpEVaa	I see a large sexual harassment case coming you way soon.|`|hxhZez7caa	ya..y r u touching her boobs..ok well just tell her how u feel because u cant just keep touching her boobs...that is sexual harassment i mean im a girl and i wouldnt want a pervertd guy coming up to me and grabbing my boobs..well i would actually take a stand for myself but still..STOP TOUCHING GIRLS BOOBS!|`|gPrSklCQaa	ask her out or leave her alone freak|`|Shp5riE6aa	Make sure a lady is ok with it, don't harass her.|`|VELnLnIKaa	i smell a sexual harassment suit coming she will tell you how it felt in court lol|`|qg11igznaa	Not okay, man.

Are you her superior? cause thats bogus... using power positions to get what you want...    Either way its not good dude...|`|2tn8EALqaa	some of these answers are downright sick.  The ONLY right answer is that you need to stop and you are a sick pervert!!|`|z8O3HxZaaa	that is sexuall harrassment!    just get a girlfriend and stop perveing on the poor woman|`|8HDQMkSBaa	dude....STOP DOING THAT!!!!|`|50245e5074843d3b781e05bd05ac05baaa	get a girlfriend|`|LV9l8EFkaa	jus put your face in there and give them a good flapping|`|FmEsMOKVaa	well....two things ...she thinks you accidentally bumped her or....she suspects and it bothers her but she is not sure if you did it on purpose.    I hope you are just joking. Show some class.|`|wS9TkFcvaa	Well she might like it, but chances are she knows you're doing it intentionally she just chooses not to say anything or maybe she's afraid to. I'd lay off or if you're actually interested in her and not just her breasts then flirt a little and see if you get anything in return. Like I said she might be interested in you and enjoys the attention.|`|rDLTnjRyaa	If you don't have permission to touch her breasts then you shouldn't be. She probably doesn't know what to say to you without causing offense. I would be furious if I was her and I would put a stop to it. You are lucky she hasn't pressed charges against you. Some kids who are being abused won't say anything because they are afraid and don't like the way the abuser has made them feel. I know how it is because I was sexually abused when I was a child. Stop what you are doing and ask her for permission to touch her breasts. See what she says. If she tells you no and how it has made her feel, respect that and back away. Don't overstep your boundary with her anymore. If she likes to be touched there, she will tell you she has no problem with it and she will let you know if you can continue doing so.|`|hcc8fq7jaa	What, are you 12? Grow up.|`|zswnT2ovaa	She proabably finds it too awkward to say anything...
AA10351134	This is more general than what you're asking but might be helpful anyway. It's from CostHelper.com.    ---        The cost of a wedding cake varies by type of cake, the kind of baker and geographic region.        Typical costs:    The average cost of a wedding cake is $543, according to The Bridal Association of America.     For wedding cakes, most bakeries and pastry chefs charge by the slice. A low-end option would be a smaller tiered cake in chocolate or vanilla paired with a sheet cake for cutting for around $1.50 a slice.     A mid-range two- or three-tiered cake in a standard flavor such as chocolate, vanilla, carrot cake or lemon poppy seed with buttercream icing and minimal fondant decorations can run $5 or $6 a slice.    A high-end multi-tiered gourmet cake with flavored fillings, fondant icing and elaborate fondant, gum paste and sugar decorations can run $10 or more per slice. FYI I have read that Sylvia Weinstock charges about $17 to $20 per slice, so that's close to the high end.|`|03rOCajTaa	Everyone I have talked to that has ate the very expensive wedding cakes say they don't taste good. I'm wondering if it b/c of the stuff they roll out to put on the cake to make it look nice. Maybe try Walmart, Publix, Bi Low, something along those lines. Those cost about $150.00 to maybe $400.00. Bakeries are very expensive, but I'm sure more work goes into it to fit your needs.|`|sGP6s7uraa	This is just one place in OKC.  I just googled Oklahoma city bakeries.  Good luck!  http://www.labaguettebistro.com/bakery.p...    Depending on your number of guests, you'll need a 6" for the top (for you and your husband to cut) an 8" and a 12".  This is what we're doing for approx 110 guests.|`|2kl0vQjVaa	Your best bet is to speak directly to a baker and give them an idea of what you want.  There are too many variables for pricing.  For example, a cake iced and filled with plain buttercream and decorated with a Swiss dot pattern with a couple of roses is going to be a LOT cheaper than a genoise soaked with chambord, filled with vanilla bean mousse and covered in fondant and sugar flowers.  In addition, because every geographic area is different, if you do find a website that shows prices, those prices may very well not apply in OKC.  Good luck!|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	every bakery charges something differant. there are other things besides designs that change the cost of the cake, such as flavors, fillings, adding or subtracting detail, and so on.     plus what you see pictures of on the internet could be done at a fraction of the cost somewhere else simply by changing the kind of icing or flowers or whatever on it.  prices change just that quickly, that anything you get on the internet will probably be null and void by the time you go talk to an actual bakery.    also, most bakerys will give you the price per slice, not the whole cake.  so some places may tell you two dollars per slice, others may say up to 8.  thats why you have to actually GO to the bakerys, and ask them    take the designs to the bakerys in your area and ask them for a qoute. its the only way your going to get a ballpark number in your area.|`|AA10975867	You can't expect to get a price for a wedding cake on the internet that reflects your city. Food prices vary, rents that the bakery pays vary, salaries vary. You may like the way a cake looks but the price could vary by $150 depending on the filling. eg: if they use fruit, if they use liquers. In our city in BC, for example, we took the basic design of the 4 layer cake we wanted to 3 bakeries and the prices varied from $399 to $700 just based on the appearance. Then when we talked about type of cake and filling available and preferred by us, and if delivery and setup was included, etc. the prices varied from $ 459 to $925. at the same bakeries. The difference in sales taxes even differ from state to state, province to province. What you need to do is have 3 or 4 pictures from magazines of cake designs you like and a definite price you can afford to pay. Then you go personally to bakeries closeby and talk to them. If your dream cake is more than you can afford, you see what they can offer you within that budget and choose the best one for you wishes.
63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	well tell them its time to pay up or move out...  remember what the told you when you was a kid..its my house my rules.. either start paying or move out|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Sit them both down and calmly explain that they need to get moving with their lives and cannot live on your "island" forever. You need to have this as a monologue and not back-track one bit from your decision for your home...but provide a grace period for them to move.|`|0rpN2419aa	maybe say, "You know I love you, mom, having you here has been nice, but the kids are getting older and we really need the room.  Would you like me to help you find a place nearby?"  With the economy the way it is, there are more family members who are returning home because they have lost their home to foreclosure.  I don't know if this is your situation.  They, being the parents, should know that you need help with the bills, food, electicity, water, etc.  Sit down with the bills in hand and show them.

Simple as that.|`|TaJWZ96paa	Has she helped you with babysitting so that you could go to work? That's pay enough considering what it cost in a day care.    Just tell her ; Mom I think it's time .

fb6e01bd10dce5212a34b8e493ff20a8aa	Tell the teen to tell her Dad the truth or you will.  A child shouldn't be raised in a lie and the father of the baby needs to man up and take responsibility.

Not only is she lying and abusing your father's kindness, she is lying and taking that child's father out of their life. Imagine that child growing up to think that they were the result of "rape", an unwanted child. That's horrible. The father of this child needs to take some responsibility, although he is a married man, he made the choice to sleep with this girl and he needs to accept the consequences. I would send him a letter, even if it tears his family apart, he needs to be in this situation and deal with it. I would suggest child support, if he wants no other part of this child's life, he should at least pay child support. You may also suggest a DNA test to determine who the father is correctly, because he could deny it and you may not get any help from him. I am pretty sure you can get a court order to do this.   It's a shame is is lying about rape, so many innocent young woman are raped and have to deal with it their entire life. It's nothing to joke about, to take so lightly.  I would tell your parent's and have them help you out. If she doesn't want to tell the truth about this boyfriend, or even confront him...try the letter. If nothing else comes of this, then your parents should make her provide for her self. I wouldn't let her live in my house, but if your parents do allow her, i would not pay a penny towards her life or that child.    best of luck.|`|DenLZAL1aa	You said,"She is 17, 16 at the time, the man is 21. and of course he has nothing more to do with her."    That is rape, she is not lying. Now what she should do is sue for child support. A DNA can prove who is the father. Talk to her father.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Ordinarily, I would say no don't interfere. But this scum bag raped her and he needs to be prosecuted, so I would spill the beans. Good luck.|`|oojO4WAraa	Yes, tell everyone that will listen.  Go directly to her father and tell him.  Then he needs to get an attorney and demand a paternity test on the baby so that the father of the baby is forced to support the child he created.  And perhaps he could go to jail, depending on his age and the girls age.  I would definitely tell someone.|`|t4F59gf2aa	That is a shame, and you feel bad fr her father well HE did raise her.  DId I?  no but bet my tax money is going to pay for this womans baby, she is stealing from me and all other tax paying Americans and people ae starving to death intheir homes because she screwed a married man , what a disgrace.  What a human monster.|`|m4nDQcWQaa	There may be a right time for her father to know. The girl will probably start feeling the guilt and tell her father the truth. It'd be fine if you told, but think about what the consequences for you would be. Personally, I'd wait and just hope and pray the girl will come clean.|`|RIZpDdNgaa	I think that this girl needs serious psychological help first of all and i don't think you can do anything because it is not your place to tell the father that, he will find out eventually don't worry about that.  I feel so bad for the poor father, but you are a good person for trying to help but i think you can't do anything about it.|`|V4iZcrVmaa	one word wowwwwwwwwwwww|`|hcc8fq7jaa	She's a jerk for doing that to her poor father. First, I wonder if she has any idea of how devastating it is to a father to think his daughter was raped. A man wants to protect his children, and certainly wants to see the culprit punished. Second, the poor father is paying her way, and that of the illegitimate child. That isn't fair to him at all. Third, if she was under 18, the married man is a criminal, in addition to being a worthless P.O.S. She, or SOMEONE, needs to tell Dad ASAP so the predator can be locked up before he does this to another, empty-headed girl like your friend. BTW, she told her own grandmother? Then grandma should have said something right away. That isn't something you just keep secret.|`|AA11502346	You should just stand by and let everything come into place naturally.  If you say something, you could be getting yourself into a lot of trouble.|`|2h913O0Saa	What a *****!|`|j7l9gavRaa	tell him or tell her you know and try to talk her into letting the truth out|`|FmEsMOKVaa	well its tough....she should come clean wit her dad. Talk to her and see if you can get her to come clean.|`|8d87fe8a8d0a0fb67336e3e06085d424aa	You should say something.|`|YgPYv4OPaa	in some way , you have to let this person know .   trust me , she will thank you for it , even if she does get mad .. shes eventually going to notice that it was the right thing :]|`|2si53dCRaa	That's a toughie, you could tell someone and have her not trust you or you can tell her and have justice served.  I think it's awful that she lied to her father, but tells her grandmother.  You could think of it this way, since she did tell SOMEONE in the family, that means she's got a secret she can't keep and now she's placing the burden on others that know the real truth.  Also, this could be an eye awkakener to her baby's father's spouse.  She deserves to know about his double life.|`|3fWygAb9aa	You should do your best to convince her to be honest with her father, and if she still refuses tell her that the family members who know will get together and tell her father themselves. I think a non-hostile ultimatum might get her to tell him, but it's important to be supportive and not accusatory, or you might scare her off.|`|dFWzf6aaaa	listen you mean well but your family member should tell him it not you place to tell but talk to  girl and tell her what she is  doing is wrong|`|968KfJjqaa	Wow, I wouldn't be able to carry that lie on my shoulders.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	Your mom, not you, should tell this family member who confided in her that she needs to tell her father the truth or your mom will tell. It is not your place to get involved. You do not have the first-hand information.|`|aSjdL4heaa	The father should not be shouldering the burden.  The family member and her boyfriend should each be told (anonymously if you like) that they have 1 day to spill the beans themselves or the beans will be spilled for them.|`|NAkQdoYlaa	She might cave herself and end up telling them the truth. I feel sorry for her family, it must be awful for them to think that really happened to her and not to mention how someone who had really been attacked would feel about silly girls lying about it.    It's hard to say what you should do, you could write an anonymous letter but on the other hand nobody else should have to get involved as she brought it on herself. It should be her who tells her family.    Whatever you decide to do good luck.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	no you shoul tell her father your friend is no friend imagine if she is doing that to her father what shell do to you. but she's probably mean manipulated by that child molester who got her pregnant cause thats what he is this will not only help your friend and her family but will stop this man from doing thins to other young girls not to mention hims wife should know who she's living with.  Please don't let him get away with this|`|46HhlH2Kaa	I think the father of this girl feels it is his responsibility to take care of this baby, perhaps he feels he didn't protect her enough to keep her from getting (raped) which she didn't get raped.  I am sure this father feels he is part to blame for what, he thinks,  happened to his daughter ( unless he is told the truth, he will continue to think this).  Now, this man that cheated on his wife and family and got this girl pregnant, I would not worry if he is married or not, he needs to pay for what he has done.  He needs to support this baby.  If it breaks up his marriage, so be it, he knew better when he took his pants down.  So if I were you, I would personally call his wife and tell her, imagine what he would feel like coming home from a day at the office and having his wife waiting for him, this is what needs to happen to him.  This baby shouldn't have to do without because some man is horny and wants to test the water.  The grass isn't always greener on the other side.|`|NrbLdZzOaa	She didnt lie about the rape part..    If he is 21 and she was 16, that is rape.|`|rYpin5zBaa	i think you should send an anonymous note and then she will not know who it was. it is bad because she could have told the truth at the beginging and taken all of the  stuff there but now her dad probable does not want her around any guys. he could make her life a living hell. so tell her dad. and he don't believe you have your mom tell her dad .|`|l7T0Ac3faa	the anonymous note sounds like a good idea|`|6rOJZxxSaa	that is messed up on her part! she needs to get child support from that cheating bastard!!! shoot i would tell the father for sure! how sad for him! she should get a paternity test with that man|`|AA12396274	you could talk to your own mom and ask her what she thinks,or to your Preacher,as this married man may do this to someone else also.|`|4dAgFaHGaa	That's a tough question to answer.    On the one hand you have the trust issue of your family member (probably a cousin) who told something in confidence to both your mother and her grandmother. On the other hand you have the family values of not lying to one another... I would strongly suggest you have a heart-to-heart talk with her and get her to try to understand her dad's point of view.    This adulterer should be the one to pay the child support, not her father - of that there is no doubt.|`|SDxI3YgXaa	TELL HER FATHER!!!!!! its really hard decision but you should tell the father... nobody should lie about getting raped!|`|racnq84Vaa	No need to be the bearer of bad news.  It will all come out in the wash.  Stay out of it.  Whoever spills the beans ends up being the hated one, despite their innocence.  No point in telling what he will either find out or already knows.  Parents know their children better than you think and they know when they lie.  Sometimes they choose to ignore it because they think it is best.  Just stay out of it.|`|HbCWNCQzaa	i was never the type to snitch or anything but this is pretty serious.....put yourself in the dads shoes and then you may have your answer.....would you want to know the truth if it was your daughter or would you rather believe she was raped!!! hope i helped|`|6YtTnJzFaa	From a legal standpoint; if the person in question has already gone to the police and filed rape charges you should get advise from an attorney before continuing.  Even statutory rape is still rape.  This older married person has made his bed, now he needs to sleep in it.  She had better be telling the truth because there will most likely be a DNA test, and even though she is a minor (or I'm assuming from the description), accusing a person of rape, or failing to do this both have serious consequences.  The fathers need to know, both of them, the dirtbag who got your family member pregnant, and the poor soul who is trying to provide for the new baby.  Truth is always the best way, especially in this case, where the adult who impregnated your teen family member has a good chance of doing the same thing to another person.  Go forward, but be smart.|`|LzPOzoJVaa	It doesn't matter what the emotions are in this.  Emotions prevent justice from happening.  If you were to use logic, and realize the facts WITHOUT all the emotions tied into it all also, then your answer would be simple. For example:  FACTS:  Father is suffering  a) to support a daughter who is lying to him  b)to support a grandbaby who is unaware of his/her father    The Daughter is trying to cover up a secret, one that is going to come out sooner or later anyways, but with everyday that passes, it is going to hurt all the more.      With all the gathered facts, you should tell her dad.  He might be angry at you.  So will the daughter, but it is the RIGHT thing to do.    I strongly suggest NOT giving an anonymous note, for he will disregard it.  You need to talk to him face to face|`|qc8O6VaWaa	i can see her point in why she wouldn't say anything ...because she is scaried. but scaried or not. it is not right to do as she is doing. first off that is considered statortory rape. sex with a minor. that child needs the best it can get. the father isn't learning or doing anything he got off free and easy. i bet u he isn't seeing her anymore, is he? i think all that know about this need to come clean and let the father know. if u can't come face to face with him about it, send the letter, but make sure he gets it, and let him know this letter is from multiple family members that she confused too. it may cause drama, but in the long run it'll help. i'll pray for u and ur family!|`|9d1117d6d6807deaf354236fab0b8dd9aa	Stay out of it.  What difference would it make???  Her father needs to support her and deal with it either way.  The girl obviously got into some trouble... but it's none of your business to get involved.  She probably lied to you for all we know, and is embarrased to accept the fact.  If the father of the baby is a grown married or unmarried man... then yes that counts as statutory rape.  So that would mean the girl didn't technically lie.  The fact that this adult man took advantage of the girl is considered to be against the law.  Even if he was her "boyfriend" he is still guilty as charged.  Sorry but your the wrong one here!  BTW don't feel sorry for her father... it's his daughter and he is doing the right thing by being supportive when she most needs it.  Wouldn't you do the same????  I know that I would.  :)|`|TpcrI3rKaa	omg! with this economy her father should be saving for retirement....but this is for u let ur heart answer this one cuz u don't wan  to be bother the rest of ur life with this good luck hope u make the best decision...

USn04b4Paa	i don't think your gay i think you wish in away that you and your wife could have things in common and be best buds like this.You probably never had a best friend and it just seems so odd to you that you can enjoy another person within the same sex .It is called being best friends ,once you realize it's ok to love and enjoy a persons company in a healthy way you won't think anything of it.Girls have best friends like this all the time i see it allot|`|8uNLDeLQaa	ur so gay|`|WTf0caplaa	I think you're gay.|`|cobGkGC7aa	dump the husband...get with the friend|`|0AjyzHUHaa	Maybe it was the only time you could have "male bonding".  Doesn't mean your gay, but everyone needs to get away, and he was probably just a good guy to hang out with.  If you think of it as an obsession, then it could turn into one, so be careful. BUT like I said, maybe you just needed to hang out with someone, and he just so happened to be the only one you hang out with?!?!?!|`|cmDV4TJTaa	Listen boo boo you are gay.  Leave your wife you are so confused especially if you love to spend time with him and your thinking about him and it affects everything around you..!    You need some time alone to gather your thoughts..!!    Good luck!|`|1oAOrpVzaa	GAY!|`|Qv2bUOqaaa	I think you're definitely confused about your sexuality. Personally, I believe you're homosexual and have feelings for this man. Good luck!
a29e7TkGaa	kiss him!! just you will not be the first or the last one in his life!!!|`|HEb9nQeFaa	Well if he likes you he shouldn't be going around getting with his ex. Talk to him. Say something like "I like you but I heard you had a thing with your ex, I didn't want to do anything just in case you two were going to get back together." If he's worth it he will say it's nothing and he likes you back, or he will tell you if something's going on. Good luck x.x|`|qdmi87Cgaa	KISS HIM!!
Ki90Irkcaa	Dont get her back. If she dumped you it was for a reason, whether it be you or her, she felt she had to end it for a reason. So let her go. If she comes back on her own, then that may be a different story depending on the circumstances.|`|KFUsmwItaa	Sorry dude I don't think you get her back, but idk try making her jealous.|`|DybOqfGpaa	plz explain the whole sitaution first|`|212FfV3faa	**** happen, you know  just talk to her
itbkP9HGaa	What does she want you to wear?  Are you a part of the wedding at all?  If you're doing a reading, or have some other role, I can see how a tux would be appropriate.  However if you have no role whatsoever, it might be odd for you to be the only person wearing a tux besides the groomsmen.  However, i'm assuming the father of the bride might be wearing a tux?  You might be okay wearing one if he is, too.  Check with your mom on what she wants.|`|7VzbVzBnaa	You wear whatever is appropriate for the formalness of the wedding.      In general, it's safe for you to be in similar attire as the groomsmen or ushers.  Base your attire on this.     I'g assuming that you mean that you shouldN'T try to upstage the groom.  And this is correct.|`|R2WxQ1cCaa	First ask your mom what she would prefer.|`|5BV5vLRFaa	I would tux it up.  It's a big deal and anyone close to the bride (like siblings not in the wedding or parents, etc) dress up fancy.  If it's a casual wedding, then I'd go for a suit.|`|2cb46ea6e0285a7d419967ceaef6f993aa	My sons, aged 20 and 22, wore suits. But they were there to escort me down the aisle.  Are you part of the wedding party? If so, then wear what she wants you to wear. If it's a formal wedding, you should wear a suit. Don't try to upstage the groom.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	you love to stunt?  what does that mean?  stunt is not a verb last time I checked.  ask your mom if you should rent a tux, then you can go to the same place the rest of the groomsmen are going and get measured.  it's gonna cost you like $100+ prolly.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	TUXEDO.. all the way...    Classy, sophisticated look...  Doo iittt... :)|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Well my son is 28 and he is the one thats giving me away so he is hiring a suit to match the bestman and the two ushers.  I would ask your mum what she wants you to wear a tux may be a little OTT and up against the man your mum is marrying.  Good luck.|`|55zWUXcUaa	I would ask your mom what she wants.  If her fiance is the only person in a tux she may want you to wear a suit but if there is a few special people in tuxes she may want you to wear a tux.  Just be cooperative with her wants adn you'll be good.    EDIT: If you are walking your mom down the aisle and the husband is wearing a cream tux, why not wear a standard basic black tux vest & tie with the white shirt?  I think that would look classy|`|tsPGVVWcaa	You should wear a tux!|`|76nTvO4iaa	Ask your mom what she wants you to wear.
racnq84Vaa	If I thought they were being abused, I would call CPS and speak with them.  I would detail my own childhood with her during the call and offer to take the children.    Other than that, I would just be a shining example of how to live morally and work hard and would spend as much time with them doing positive things as possible.  Such as church, volunteer work, museums and other activities.|`|R2WxQ1cCaa	It sounds like a nutso family I know who live high on the hog while crap just rains on me.|`|YHfsTdLKaa	if it was my sibling i would ask them if they are ok and explain to them that what they are going thru is not normal. i would definitly offer my help and do whatever i can to get them out of that situation. if they did not want my help then i would call CPS.|`|niyESblhaa	people like that shouldn't be allowed to multiply|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	Jerry Spinger show today? That mother should be stripped of her rights to raise kids now and forever|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	yes, i would be concerned...this woman has no business raising kids|`|03rOCajTaa	Oh my goodness the whole story is sad. I understand stuff happens but for a mom/step mom to push that kind of stuff onto someone. Sounds like the step mom is looking for attention.Yes I would be concerned for the siblings.
vwcDdNfcaa	if the mother is willing she can sign away her rights to you if she feels she is not able to take care of a child at the time and your the one she wants to step up and raise her contact a lawyer|`|oOqSpBmbaa	You can't claim her as yours. but if you managed to convince her mother you could adopt her.. But then again, I don't think the mother would leave her daughter in a different country with her ex-fiance to be honest|`|1k6UUC8qaa	well you can marry and adopt the kid but if her mother doesn't want you too im pretty sure you are out of luck you are not he biological father and with a dna test can  proof it why doesn't she want to marry you?  I don't think i would leave my teenage daughter with anyone either
WwCBomTMaa	It can cause problems later on down the road. If the father is a jerk (which he probably is if I'm reading this correctly) he can get a court order forcing her to come back with the child for a custody hearing, which will probably happen soon if she is filing for a divorce. However, the judge may not look fondly on the mother for taking off with the child. And if the father gets any sort of custody he could claim that she kidnapped the child. I know nothing about the state laws, but if she is being abused and needs to leave in a hurry she should go immediately!! Just try and help her to obtain as much proof as you can before she goes so that when the day does come that she is forced back for a custody hearing the judge will be more understanding.|`|d20mM90uaa	yes, she can legally take the child anywhere she wants unless she is some freak with warrants for arrests or there is already a court order on her to stay put.... yes she can|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	What a cop-out.  Instead of doing the right thing, she's going to leave the state and drop a divorce on him.  What a winner she is.    EDIT:  If there is more to the story, it's interesting that you didn't feel the need to share it.  If she's being abused, she should be at a women's shelter.      Don't you get it?  She can do this if she wants, and it's legal, but it's a shitty thing to do and I have the right to my opinion about people who **** on other people.|`|701bbe1c569791c58e8a627b54425b08aa	She can take her child with her anywhere.|`|OBCvewW2aa	Legally, she can get on a plane and fly intrastate without anyone bothering them.|`|d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	no|`|DIx2ZD4Faa	she is legal to take the kid anywhere but once she files for divorce she most likely will have to share some of the burden of travel for visitation when the custody schedule is set up.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	I don't know the laws for the State of Ohio but it is generally against the law for one parent to deprive the other parent of their rights (access to their children) with-out just cause.  In such a case the parent can go to the police (doesn't even have to go thru a lawyer / Judge) to force the return of the children.    If your spouse takes your children out of the state, your attorney goes directly to the district attorney for nationwide assistance. The federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act applies to all interstate custody disputes, not only child snatching.

Hek7MUNYaa	FEEL SUPER-SEXY IN YOUR SKIN<br>  Electrify your erogenous zones and boost your naked body confidence by performing a post shower towel tease.<br>  Do-it directions: While the bathroom's steamy, ask your partner to come in. Then begin to dry off, rubbing the towel across your breasts, back and butt, revealing one body part while concealing another. Look in the mirror and keep an eye on his face. Then ask him to rub your skin with baby oil.<br>  Passion payoff: You can ease into being bare in front of him. “Most couples don't take the time to get comfortable with each other naked unless the lights are off,” says Lou Paget, author of The Big O. Here, you can play exhibitionist and explore your sensual side.” And by seeing him watching you in the mirror, you'll be able to see what he does: a woman he can't resist<br>  <br>  HAVE SOLO SEX WITH AN AUDIENCE<br>  Show him your masturbation moves first-hand: he'll get to see how you touch yourself and why it turns you on.<br>  Do-it directions: As your boyfriend reaches for your nether region, gently push his hand away and ask if he'd like to watch you do it instead. “Whisper something like, 'Want to see what I do when you're not around?'” suggests Brame. When he nods (and he will!), part your legs slightly, stroke your breasts and belly, then move your hand down your body. As you begin to touch yourself, open your legs wider so he gets a more explicit view. Bonus: place his hand over yours, then pull yours away so you can climax via his moves alone.<br>  Passion payoff: A slam-dunk orgasm, plus a grateful guy who now knows how to push your pleasure buttons. “Men are incredibly visual and crave erotic instruction,” says Brame. Another bedroom benefit: treating him to such an intimate display will bring you closer by opening the lines of carnal communication. Once you grant him a front-row view, he'll be ready to show you how he likes to be manhandled.<br>  <br>  GIVE UP CARNAL CONTROL<br>  Putting him in charge of all the dirty details means you can completely surrender to your new-found pleasure.<br>  Do-it directions: Straddle your partner while he's on his back and stretch his arms over his head. Pretend to pin him to the bed, then smile and say, “This is what I'd like you to do to me.” He can hold or tie your wrists, while you lie back and be ravished.<br>  Passion payoff: Giving up control allows you to focus on your own gratification. So while your partner gets to work, you're able to relax and relish the sensations of his every kiss, touch and lick. “With your hands secured, you can't cover up a body part you're shy about and you can't hold back when sensations become overwhelming,” says Brame. “And being 'helpless' allows you to concentrate on how good your body feels, so orgasms are easier to come by.”<br>  <br>  TRY THIS SEX-POSITION SPIN<br>  The Swivel is a position for the lovemaker who craves sensual stimulation and doesn't like to stay still in bed.<br>  Do-it directions: Assume the on-top position, facing him as he lies on his back. While squeezing his penis, lift your leg over his body and swivel around, never letting him slip out of you. Squeeze three to five times, keeping close to his base. Then turn again so you're facing his feet. Move in small circles rather than up and down and swivel around until you're back at the start. “Three 360-degree turns is respectable,” says Tracey Cox, author of Supersex. “Five is Olympian!”<br>  Passion payoff: The corkscrew-like motion will bring him to the brink. Then, give him time to catch his breath while you pause to rotate again. It'll also gaunt him a revolving view of your body. “Plus, when you're on top, his penis rubs the sensitive front wall of your vagina, grazing your G-spot for an extra-intense orgasm,” says Cox.<br>  <br>  MAGNIFY YOUR TOUCH<br>  Ever notice when one of your senses is blocked, the others get stronger? The same thing happens during sex.<br>  Do-it directions: Lead your partner into the bedroom. Take off your clothes, then blindfold each other – covering your ears too – and agree to be silent for an erotic encounter. “Communicate with gestures – the pressure of a hand, arch of a back, or stiffening of a nipple,” advises Cox.<br>  Passion payoff: Removing sight and sound magnifies the experience, says Cox. “With just touch to guide you, you're forced to use your hands and mouth all over your bodies, awakening erogenous zones you may not have been aware of,” she adds. Since you can't see each other, you're compelled to find new ways to wow your partner. Perhaps, some of those moves will even become staples of your pleasure list.<br>  <br>  MAKE A FANTASY A HOT REALITY<br>  Don't restrict naughty thoughts to your mind. Let 'em loose in the bedroom.<br>  Do-it directions: Write out a searing scenario, something you've had daydreams about, but have never acted on. Then, while on the couch, or in bed, make your move. “Ask him suggestively, 'Want to hear my story?'” suggests Paget. Get him to test-drive your script by stroking his ego. “Tell him you've been thinking about it and want to share it|`|i9421OOYaa	Get on top of him and bounce up and down

You could start a conversation by saying in a funny voice: "Wonderful weather we're having." and grin silly. That always works for me. You could see a therapist about your shyness.

a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Wedding announcements are a great way of spreading the word, in fact we got one this summer from a cousin. It was a surprise but a nice one ( = Do it!<br>  <br>  You invite the people you are closest to but be careful of stepping on toes. Make your lists and see who you are missing/forgetting and discuss the outcome of their being left out with each other to ensure there will be no hard feelings.<br>  <br>  As for the kids, you can say "adults only reception to follow" or you could go so far as to hire a babysitter for the event to keep the kids in a seperate area with coloring books, toys, etc so they won't disturb your wedding. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kUE3Ddktaa	1. Send wedding announcements AFTER the wedding takes place to any family/friends who weren't invited - that way, no one mistakes your announcement for an invitation. You don't need to say why they weren't invited - that's no one business. It can say something like:<br>  <br>  "Susan Smith and John Jones were married in a private ceremony on January 30, 2009. Mr. and Mrs. Jones reside at..." and give contact info, etc.<br>  <br>  2. If you invite one aunt, you do NOT have to invite all the aunts. You should invite the people you are closest to. Although I would feel awkward about inviting one of my cousins and then not inviting his/her siblings, unless the siblings lived way out of town or were much older/younger. That's just me - it's not a rule.<br>  <br>  3. Address the invitation (outer and inner envelopes) only to the people you are inviting - if that's just the parents, ONLY write the parents' names on the envelope. On the RSVP card, make sure that they have a space to write down how many will be attending. If you send an invite for 2 parents and get an RSVP back with 6 guests attending, you can make a polite phone call and let them know that, as much as you love their children, you simply can't accommodate them.<br>  <br>  <br>  Karin C gave you some fantastic advice about not trying to explain too much. You never need to say, "Oh, well, I'm just a lot closer to aunt Carol" or anything like that. You always, always say, "We kept to a pretty strict budget and had to keep the invite list small. We wish we could have invited everyone."|`|0Id85yiYaa	i'm having a destination wedding with just our immediate family. we're keeping it to just parents and siblings, so no one gets their feelings hurt. however, we're having a reception for everyone. on the invites, we put:<br>  ____ & ______ we wed in a private ceremony. please join them to celebrate their marriage. <br>  <br>  something to that extent.|`|AA11380378	Word the invites:<br>  <br>  "Adult reception to follow" and spread it by word or mouth to reassure it.<br>  <br>  Do not sent announcements. People will assume that an invitation will follow and then show up after asking a cousin/uncle.<br>  <br>  Send the invites only to those that will be there and as far of the rest they will hear it from the gravevine that you are having an intimate small affair with immediate family members only.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|8bTder08aa	With regards to limiting the size of your wedding, practice these words over and over again:<br>  <br>  "We wish we could have invited everyone we wanted to, but we had a very small budget to work with and so we could only invite a few people.  I know we disappointed a lot of people but we just couldn't afford a bigger wedding."  Say it with a nice smile.<br>  <br>  This is what you are going to say to everyone who expresses disappointment or resentment at not being invited.  DO NOT ELABORATE ON THIS EXPLANATION.  Do not go into explanations about why you chose the people you chose and didn't choose other people.  Don't explain, don't make excuses, stick to the theme:  you had a small budget, you couldn't invite everyone you wanted to, you're sorry about the disappointments but it wasn't possible to invite everyone you wanted.<br>  <br>  In my experience, it's when you try to explain why you invited some people or didn't invite someone that gets you into trouble.  <br>  <br>  Invite who you really want, accept that some people will be upset, stick to your explanation of a limited budget for the wedding, and don't explain/apologize.  Reasonable people will understand.  Unreasonable people don't count.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	1. Mention it is an adult reception in the invite.  Don't name the kids on the front of the invite and they should get the point. However, if you do this you have to do it across the board.  You really can't say (and you don't want to explain after) that your sister's kids are allowed to come but his cousin isn't allowed to bring theirs.<br>  2. If they aren't  engaged or married they don't get to bring their boyfriends/girlfriends. (There is room for exceptions here.  For example: If you spend a lot of time with your sister's boyfriend of 2 years then of course he would be an exception).<br>  3.  Make a clear cut line when it comes to inviting family: aunts uncles and first cousins are coming, no great aunts, no second cousins etc. No exceptions (unless of course you and your second cousin are best friends lol)  Of course if you talk to one cousin and only see his/her siblings at family reunions I think they'd understand.<br>  <br>  If you follow that then when people ask you can honestly say "I'm sorry it's a small wedding and we aren't having any kids/boyfriends etc"<br>  As for announcements: Send out wedding announcements after the wedding to everyone. Any announcements before hand may be taken as an invite.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	1.  only address the invitations to the people you will be inviting.  If you don't want children to attend then you put:  Mr and Mrs John Smith.  NOT Mr and Mrs. John Smith and family.<br>  <br>  2.  "adult reception to follow"  is perfectly acceptable in the invitation.  also if possible plan your reception for a time where children would most likely not be able to attend.<br>  <br>  3.  I'd make sure your parents and siblings (& siblings' spouses or long term SOs) were invited and then after that any family and friends you absolutely want there.  Don't worry about inviting an auntie you haven't seen since  you were 12 or the great aunt or cousin you never met.<br>  <br>  4.  AFTER the wedding send out wedding announcements to the family and friends who you want to know about your marriage.<br>  <br>  "Mary Sue Davis and Joseph Smith were married in a private (or intimate--something to indicate it was small) ceremony on date, time at place."|`|LxvA4vGpaa	Well, when addressing the envelopes for the invites, if you state just "Mr & Mrs Smith", it should be assumed by the smiths that no children are allowed.  Now if you dont mind children, you would address it to "Mr & Mrs Smith & family" or "The Smith Family".<br>  <br>  And just to drive the point home, on the invitation itself, clearly state "Adults only" or "Adult reception to follow".|`|71eb194551f71e5eb573dce622125c6eaa	On invite <br>  state:  Adult reception<br>  <br>  forget the announcement <br>  w/that big of a family <br>  word will spread like<br>  wildfires|`|8f233cd7a98def4e68276c32767e5dadaa	We too are having a very small wedding only 100 people. We invited only our parents brothers and sisters we didn't go as far as to invite all the second cousins, second aunts and all that! We wanted to make sure there was room for our friends! So we also just put on the invites, the names of the people invited. Since some of our cousins we weren't inviting since we don't speak to them regularly. We just went with our close relatives. Your family should understand that you had to draw the limit since it is small. If they have something negative to say, don't worry its only there opinion and its your day!
0TXaPJDoaa	Okay I know i'm younger than you but both my parents are in the medical profession. I'm told that it really doesn't hurt that much. You shouldn't be scared of anything but don't rush into it. If your scared it probably means your not ready for it yet. It may or may not still hurt if you masturbate so if your not comfortable doing that, don't.And if your boyfriend's pressuring you about it tell him to piss off and respect your rights (you might want to be a little more subtle).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :D|`|ebHcrGdpaa	Please please please slow down and dont think so much about sex if you can help it.  Its totally ok to be curious, everyone is at your age, but if you are so curious educate yourself about it, and by that I do not mean watch porn.  If you have a parent or older sibling ( I mean adult) or even a counselor (seriously they are good people to talk to) they would be a good place to go, you dont want regrets in life do you?<br>  <br>  Dont give yourself away at such a young age, or even delve into sex...you will regret it later if you do.  Hope this helps!! <br>  <br>  And stay away from icky boys who pressure you!|`|EZsVuLV7aa	hey dont be worried bout it it dont hurt at all and im younger dan u it reali doesnt hurt and no da masturbating thing is defo not true...wat happened ta me was i was with a guy for 9 months and eventually we had sex and it didnt hurt and its da most amazin feelin in da world da only thing u look out for is dat wen its ur first time its with da right person ur first time is special so do it wit someone specail....dont be worried at all i promise u it doesnt hurt....|`|FHm7LGPSaa	just make sure its with someone you truly love, who cares about how you feel, comforts you, and use protection|`|VMUwtGCuaa	your teffified about sex cause u think it was not meant for your pleasure but for the guys.It is best to be in love and then u wont have much fear.

CkN4pgpCaa	I've been there before too, where my life completely revolved around my boyfriend.. and when I didn't work out it was like- 'now what?'  Be proactive with your friends.. don't wait for them to call you... call them and come up with fun get togethers- happy hours, girls night out/in, etc.  You said that you are in college, so maybe you should try to get together with some classmates and study.   Building up your friendships and relationships with other people will make you less dependent on your boyfriend because they will help you feel good about yourself.  Try out some new activities... you may just find one that you love and it can help fill the lonelier times.  <br>  <br>  You may be feeling needy because being with him makes you feel fulfilled... maybe you feel smart, fun, pretty, etc. around him and you like that feeling (and who wouldn't?) so you try to have that as much as possible.  People who can get some of that fulfillment from other sources are less needy. It's much healthier!   <br>  <br>  Hope this helps:)|`|UHWPNLOzaa	Everyone reacts to relationships differently. You are just very attached when it comes to one and there are others that are not.  Either way if your boyfriend really cares for you then he should not be bothered by this but feel honored that you feel that way about him.  Maybe you personal life is pleasing and taking care or spending time with your mate. Maybe you just need to find someone more like you. Be yourself don't change how you r for anyone.|`|2tBJT53Kaa	If you can afford it, I would say:  See a psychiatrist.<br>  You can put more effort into you relationship with your friends.<br>  Take up an hobby or exercises.

Your husband needs to put an end to this.  How did she get his number to text him in the first place?  He is encouraging this.  Tell him he either puts an end to this or he is out the door.  He needs to fix this now.|`|0213a878584dfe668851e9dfd2d6a2e0aa	You need to talk to your husband and tell him that you feel that his behavior is inappropriate. The girl is not really the problem, but it is your husband that you should trust. If he loves and respects your feelings he will listen to you and not give this woman so much attention.|`|7cjqT33Baa	Your husband wants all the contact from her, or he'd stop it.  He likes it, he encourages it.  That's your real problem, not the girl.  It could be any girl, she's irrelevant.  The problem is your husband.|`|YRUf6BoWaa	just talk to her about it and tell your husband taht if the situation continues there will be bad consequences <br>  you could also tell your husband that you want to have some kind of vacation go to a far place with him i dont know it doesnt have to be europe but spend some time alone with him|`|j8aCEtg8aa	That he doesn't work would be enough for me to boot him to the curb, let alone flirting with his little married harlot.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	I'd be threatened by her too.

But if he hasn't, I would ask him to stop talking to her so much.|`|71b5d9acd0e084b723a6c805c9cfd85daa	Women cheat with their heads, men cheat with their little head.<br>  <br>  That said, she is likely not getting what she needs at home - she doesn't feel like she is special and her mental needs aren't been met.<br>  <br>  Men, however, are pretty loyal to their wives as long as their physical needs are being taken care of.  So, while he might have a good time talking - if you and he are physical at home, he has no need to stray.<br>  <br>  I think calling her or texting her is a bad idea.  Utilimately, you will never be able to stop your husband from cheating by "scaring the other girl off".  He has to want to be loyal to you.|`|9fmkCRifaa	I'm sorry. If put in your position, my husband would be given an ultimatum. I am anything but jealous. I've never been the jealous type. But, my husband has a hell of a lot more respect for me than yours seems to have for you. My husband is EXTREMELY jealous, and he asked me to stop hanging out with an ex of mine (with whom I have been friends for years) because it made him uncomfortable. The 'friend' still show interest in me after my husband & I began dating...so his feelings were more than justified. I haven't spoken to that friend since my husband told me he was uncomfortable with it...because I have respect for my husband<br>  I believe, in your case, it seems your feelings are justified. Your husband should show you some respect. It's not like this girl is a lifelong friend. If she were, I'd feel differently. But, she seems to be a school acquaintance only. If he respects you at all, he should tell her to back off. It's HIS responsibility to do that. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11208683	no you are not making a big deal about this at all. she should be respectful to you and she is not at all!!! you need to let your husband know that it is hurting you. specially to see them together that close, if he doesn't understand that then he is a SH** head big time. he needs to get his priorities straight big time!!!! shute give me her number ill give her a piece of my mind. she sounds like someone who needs to be put in her place BIG TIME!!! gurl i wish you the best of luck on this.... it sounds hard to deal with!|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Yes, call her and tell her he is married so she may as well forget about him.Tell her this :<br>  Why go out for spam sandwiches when he has a steak at home?" then hang up.<br>  Tell him you trust him,but if he ever cheats it is over and then give him a reason to WANT to come home to you hon.Do what you did to get him to marry you.You know what to do!|`|eR5kvqI3aa	wtf... he doesn't have a job? ugh... that's break up reason alone. and damn that is terrible what he is doing to you. you're his wife and he shouldn't talk to her at all if it makes you uncomfortable and that is a good enough reason. but that is effed up and what is even more so is that when you went to go take him over there and she said that about coming over i would have cussed that ***** out and asked her who the eff does she think she's talking to and just because her man is probably cheating on her doesn't mean she needs to start wreaking other peoples relationships and i damn sure wouldn't have dropped him off!! give me her # i'll cuss her out for you. i'd also tell her husband that he needs to put his wife on a leash because she's messing with your man.|`|slJWqCI5aa	I would feel threatened by this too - but then again I am very territorial and if she had asked my hubby in front of me to "come over"..I would have made my presence and status known and hubby and I would have had a major fight and make-up session right there and then. You need to put your foot down. You are paying the bills...block his texting capabilities and make him aware that you do not approve of this girl and he needs to stop contact, if he chooses not too - send him on his way a packin. Maybe she can support him from now on!

I'm not guaranteeing anything but from what you've said I think she likes you.
7cjqT33Baa	Nope.  My husband and I are best friends and we have a lot of fun together.  It's nice to have someone to go through life with and someone that I'm so close to and that is there for me through everything.  We can think back together and say "remember when" and we have all those shared memories.  I think it's pretty incredible when you meet the right person.  If you think you are missing out on things because you are married, then you aren't married to the right person.|`|AA10248966	Once I got married,. my sanity WAS being challenged daily by someone I did not now WAS a paranoid delusional. I now have a different 12 year Full time  partner who I get along with. I Miss nothing about being single, because she is not lazy and gives a crap about me.|`|1k7LIZVWaa	Not at all.  I did the first time I got married, then I got divorced and did things I missed out on.  Now I am married again but much happier the 2nd time.|`|YrqMrVfOaa	No I've not.. I'm one of those who has enjoyed life before marriage and am still enjoying life, now with my hubby, after marriage..|`|RtkB46peaa	Yep, I've missed out on STD's, dating shallow women, and those fun lonely nights alone.|`|LVrqRCh8aa	Nopee.

I lived the single life before I was married, I lived on my own and paid my own bills, etc.  I dated a few guys, hung out with my friends, and figured out who I was.<br>  <br>  Then I found the love of my life,  got married, and had a child.<br>  <br>  Then I figured out what I wanted to do with my life.  I found my life's passion.  And now I have two children, an amazing husband and a blossoming career.|`|7DoR1QKuaa	...not really.  Most people make the mistakes of looking for time to do things they love to do instead of making time.  If you always look for time, you'll never find it, but make time and you'll have it.  Marriage is an adjustment and compromise, but you don't have to compromise everything.  There is a way to be married and still be an individual.  <br>  <br>  Be Blessed!|`|EKDv7HS8aa	Like what kinds of things? I wish you gave more info about what your looking for. Obviously you miss out on dating lol, but no I dont think I am missing out. I like being married. I got married when I was 18 and I'm 22 now. Sometimes I feel like I missed out on some stuff like being on my own but I'm ok with it now. I'm glad I'm married.|`|71b5d9acd0e084b723a6c805c9cfd85daa	The first time, yes.  I  was 22 years old and hand't lived at all.  So, I knew that I hand not done enough.<br>  <br>  However, 10 years later, I married again.  I knew that he was the one and that he was the one.  We have now been married for 10 years and I've never been happier.|`|iaXpHkBvaa	i think your life definitely changes, you lose doing whatever you want whenever you want but you gain a person  who is always there for you who always thinks about what you want and if you're happy or not but that's only if you marry the right person|`|j8aCEtg8aa	Yeah, a lot of microwave dinners and cold lonely nights.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	I do feel like I've missed out on traveling the world, and being able to go on road trips with friends, but one day we'll be able to travel together so I'm not sweating it.|`|dTEbLgvEaa	Only men who played me and moved on.

But I don't mind, we're both homebodies.|`|QCfOUgxnaa	It's definitely different from single life.  But no, I don't feel like I'm missing out.  I kind of feel like my single friends are missing out.  They spend all their nights at bars and clubs, and have no idea how wonderful it is to have a family.   I wouldn't trade my husband or daughter for anything!!|`|7royFhIgaa	Not at all,If anything I have gained my things since getting married. A best friend and loving partner for starters.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Yes.|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	yes I seem to not have as many friends around
LOKvEpzuaa	People do this to me too. I've always been shy, but I try to talk to everyone. People think that since you're so nice and pretty that they can walk all over you. You just have to kill them with kindness, make them like you. Be friendly with everyone and things will slowly get better. If something happens just hold you head up and keep trying.|`|qPTEmrMpaa	dont be stuck up or get a big head cuz people tell you your pretty. and personally im shy to but ive learn that if you be outgoing adn just walk up to people randomly and say hi to them first there more likely to talk to you and be firends with you. and with the whole guy thing just start talking small talk with some guy just say hey when you walk pased them in the hall then in the classes that you have with them make small talk just try talking to the first and when your with one of your friend try to be the convo starter|`|KrFQ1gcraa	i dont think you're intimidated, but guys, even though they dont admit it, can be nervous or whatever<br>  idonno i'd say just put yourself out there and flirt so they know you're interested.|`|6GUARqpCaa	Maybe your friends just complement you about how hott you are because their your Friends... no offence in any way.|`|wmoKm4jHaa	Nah, maybe they're not intimidated. Maybe its how you appear. Like the pretty girls seem popular or whatever; maybe you seen mean, shy, etc. maybe u should open up and show your personality, makin someone laugh, or even smile will get u far!!

nhgQKvwEaa	Obviously the porn is effecting you, seems you have an additicon to porn. You need to stop with that. no one wants a fake tanned whore. Give your gf a break, why are you even with her? Sounds like all you need is your porn and your hand... that's sad, you need help.|`|eGPZpfr5aa	real women do not look like porn star, and those useless sluts are ALL fake, i hope your girlfriend dumps you for a better looking man because that is what you deserve|`|AA11375099	It sounds like you should not be in any relationship now except with your hands.<br>  <br>  No girl can live up to those expectations, not even a porn queen.  I know, I've dated one before.<br>  <br>  It is only a role they are playing.  They do it well, but it is work.  Usually they walk around in jeans and a t shirt.  No high heels, fish net stockings , and thongs.  That is for the camera.|`|AEAxZEveaa	I think the problem in this is that you are looking at her as an object and not a person. You're never going to be happy in a relationship if you are so focused on what she looks like. What are you going to do when your future wife gets older? Trade her in for a younger one? The porn issue doesn't bother me, the fact that you think the point of a relationship is sex instead of an emotional connection does.|`|6N7eF9tBaa	I understand where you coming from you don;t watch the same porn twice unless it's the good stuff. The same I suppose would happen to your girl. if you don;t have sex and don't watch porn. You'll find her attractive sooner than you think.|`|Sl0UPcheaa	I blame the porn. I have the same problem. After watching so much porn your girlfriend can never live up to it.|`|oXRZfAWaaa	No way dude - it's not the porn.  Doing the same person gets old.  It's just the way it is.  Try to find ways to spice it up, break up (not that it will be different with the next chick after six months), embrace the porn, have threesomes, cheat, or stay with her and use the porn when she is / is not around.  I don't think there are any other options.<br>  <br>  Either way, figure out your coping mechanism now - cuz you'll need it once you get married.|`|RzdQmrV1aa	Yea, I think so. Stop watching it or atleast limit yourself. Also you might wanna spruce up the love life a little. Try new things. Be extra-romantic and see how it goes. Another important thing is to keep up your communication. <br>  <br>  If she knows the difference of what you like and what you "absolutely love" than things will start getting alot more fun and she can tease you a little. Try a few fanatsies that you've had. But keep in mind that if you have sex really often than its bound to get a little routine.|`|FOUCV6Cmaa	I think it could be a little but of everything.  The porn could play a major role in this relationship, but like someone mentioned in an earlier answer, try some extra romantic things.  Find the things in your relationship that made you excited to be with her.  After these things you may have a better sense of knowing if it is time to move on or stay with your gal!  Good Luck|`|x02jsjg6aa	The problem is you're not very interested in your girlfriend- who she is.  If you were, the more you got to know her the more attractive you'd find her.  It is clearly just about appearance.  If she's ugly and disgusting then I understand that you're less attracted.  But if she's not...you're just not that into her.  It's not about the porn.|`|HV1UIaSQaa	No porn isn't effecting your view on here. Maybe you're just getting bored of having the same sex. Try new positions or it could be that your feelings for here have lessened. Porn would not 'cause you to find her less attractive. Has she done anything lately thats different? Or you might have learned something about her that kind of grossed you out.<br>  <br>  for more counseling send questions to:<br>  goodnewsforpeoplewholovebadnews@live.c...|`|bZA3TntMaa	its a little of both, the porn has made you want more of a porn type babe, but being in a relationship that long you tend to lose attraction to your partner.
pOTigVYPaa	Love is fundamental in everyone's life but it doesn't have to be love in a relationship.? It can be love of family, friends,? and even pets.? Many people are happiest living alone.? You're just you and there are many more like you.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	I believe so, yes.<br>  <br>  Love, whether it be romantic love or love from close friends and family, is so important for happiness.<br>  <br>  The real problem is that you don't feel worthy of like, let alone love.  <br>  <br>  Maybe some counseling or therapy would help you figure out what's so special about you and why you are worthy of love.  Then again, you are SO young, and most young people don't really know who they are until they are about 25.|`|hNSZlSMPaa	Loving yourself is essential for a healthy life. I don't mean thinking that you are the greatest person alive but understanding that you have value and worth.  Sometimes one or two good friends is all a person needs. Some need more. Work on that self esteem and maybe you will be able to open up to someone else when you feel better about yourself.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	If you don't have a passion for life, you're missing out.  Doesn't matter who or what you love, just as long as you have something to put your soul into.|`|FOUCV6Cmaa	You don't have to have someone in your life to make you happy.  Do what makes you happy:)  Go out have fun make friends and feel good about yourself!|`|iD4ejChZaa	no, life is about God. not us, there have been plenty of people who have gone out into the world as missionaries, giving up their life for sharing God's love and preaching also helping the less fortunate, they were more than happy----|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	You are only missing out if you are unhappy with your life or if YOU feel you are missing out.<br>  <br>  People's need for relationships differ.  I have lots of friends and acquaintances and my husband has basically none.  He is happy with that and for me that would be hard.<br>  <br>  Now, the low self esteem needs to change.
q0FspEiOaa	Wait till you're both single, then you should go for it. Is the friend that important to you both?|`|gjMJzfoeaa	If this guy doesn't dump the other girl to be with you, then he's not a keeper. <br>  <br>  The issue with his best friend is for neither of you. If you don't return the feelings for his best friend, then that's the BF's issue, not yours and not T's. If you two keep using that as an excuse, then you two might as well walk away from the notion.|`|fFCNZrLKaa	if you like him and he likes you then go for it. heres my opinion, if you live life worrying about other peoples feelings, then you might as well forget about yours. i know that the other guy that likes you is T's best friend, but sometimes its better to think about what you want other than thinking about what other people want.|`|5JDiXuXBaa	if your gut and your heart says that your meant to be with him dont give up never give up. if his friend gets mad, thats his friends problem not yours or your guys. he will get over it in time. you dont want to miss out on someone you really like jsut because someone you have no feeling for is standing in the way. if you want to be together, just be togehter/ good luck. :]|`|h9fKoHGyaa	I think you two should date. Don't worry about what other people think, if he's really a true friend, he will accept the fact that the two of you like each other a lot.|`|b32kWO7Xaa	I think you should ask him if he would ever go out with you.<br>  If he says no because of his friend, then get rid of him!|`|FIXQXwtXaa	if you like him.wait.dont listen to the jerks who think no one can be happy.just wait it out|`|sUc1jUHhaa	i spose if you dont like T's friend who likes you, you shouldnt really have to suffer because of him. just tell him you dont think it would work out and you like T.<br>  if he likes you enough , he will probably accept that you dont like him in that way and hopefully get over you. then you and T can be together ! :D<br>  <br>  hope yous are together sometime soon ! :D<br>  good luck <br>  xx|`|tuendbBeaa	I'm going to side with the "wait" crowd. This is my reasoning. <br>  <br>  Say you guys decide to do a little secret thingimajigger while he's with his current girlfriend...<br>  <br>  Basically... if he can talk to you behind his girlfriend's back, what makes you think he won't talk to someone else behind yours?..<br>  <br>  If it's meant to be, it will be.... in time.|`|2EobcGqqaa	If he'll see you behind all the other girls backs, then don't think he won't do it to you.  He probably sweet talks all the girls like he does you cause he's a PLAYA!|`|5737f0111f183aa3e07767b0362ccc9caa	Children worry about what other people think.  People who are ready for love go ahead.  There's nothing wrong with being a child.  But monogomous unions take place when both people are strong enough to live and die by their own choices..|`|27ylepZLaa	You are not married, so get with the guy you like - ask him to tell his bro to stay outa this.|`|iNBte8Xoaa	I think that you gotta do what you want, do no give fake hopes to anyone!!!|`|gbYBkNpCaa	tell him to bug off|`|nStTaNPwaa	hes just not into you|`|wjmuzlbCaa	Honestly he doesn't seem as into you as you think or talk about. If he was with a girl for two year, but secrectly liked you, but then went out with someone else other then you when his two year relationship got messed up then something isn't working. I understand his best friend may or may not like you and he doesn't want to upset him, but if the feelings you're telling my you guys have for each other are mutual then it really shouldn't matter what the people around you are feeling.|`|JmXs9g3Yaa	both of u just come clean to ur friends like for T. say to his best friend and maybe say,"dude im going to go out with _____ hope ur not mad and i still wnt to be friends". Hope u 2 will get things right! GOOD LUCK!|`|bNnlYyCdaa	Drop him. If he's waffling around this much, he's clearly not in a position to commit emotionally to a real relationship.|`|6Na1PWM3aa	go for it.<br>  better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.<br>  life is life. so what if someone gets made.<br>  do what makes you guys happy.|`|Oj1SnKOWaa	if you want to be together, be together. if the best friend can't be supportive what kind of friend is he really?<br>  <br>  i think you two should try it out :)|`|YbsW5aKGaa	Date someone else, or better yet, don't date anyone.  No need to complicate that situation any more.|`|Ufeqm78naa	i wouldnt because when ur dating him for  2 years he might be secertly likeing another girl|`|OorrU9FVaa	if he liked u enough he wouldnt care about all that junk and he would ask u out, end of story|`|Qm2jRRWSaa	get rid of him! he has a girl :(|`|3sPnI4Skaa	wow girl u r in a tough position! but.......this is what u need  do.. u need to go out and get your man because who knows! he might b your true love or something, and so what if the friend gets mad?!?!? he'll get over it someday, but its your life and live it by u and not off of others! cuz love only comes once in a lifetime (well a good one of course) so go and get yours and skip the best friend, because its not your fault u dont like him!!!!! so GET YOUR MAN GIRLFRIEND!!!!!!!! :] HOPE THINGS WORK OUT 4 U!|`|7BI5xhf3aa	I think the best thing to do here is let the guy go.  You would have too much drama.  Also, he might be setting a trap for you, too.  Many guys tend to have a gf and then have a another girl on the side, enjoying the fact that he has two girls that like him and another okay with the idea that he has a gf.  And if he really liked you, he would've already made you his girlfriend. I don't know, it's a real complicated situation. Wish you the best!|`|Qb1P7DCQaa	god get over your petty problems. i know it sounds harsh but it a few years none of it will matter. your like.... what? 15. youve got like 60 more years of your life ahead of u and honestly by the time your an adult when you look back on your petty high school relationships all you'll see is drama. <br>  <br>  so if hes ur friend be friends have amazing times and memories why ruin it by going out? if u really like him and something happens let it. but when people go searching for a fairtale ending the magic dies. why do you HAVE to go out.... do you always have to have a boyfriend... can't you just have memorable people in your life who you love.|`|xv63biFiaa	I think you two need to try it out.  So what if his friend used to have a thing for you; don't let that stop something that could be really special in the future.  I'm sure his best friend will get over it sometime, you need to follow your heart.  Which is telling you to give this guy a chance! Tell him how you feel so you can see if you can get something worked out.  I have been in a situation like this once.  This guy named Tim liked me, and i liked him, but when he asked me to be his gf i said i didn't want a bf right then.  So then he got a girlfriend 2 months later, and i then DID want to date him.  But I never told him my feelings had changed and so he fell in love with his new gf and totally forgot about me.  it hurts when i see his face, and so i do think you need to give it a chance.  Don't be afraid; go for it!<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)<br>  <br>  ~oxox
N1qKXDs2aa	yea, hasnt everyone. i never cheated though|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	I'm a girl- but I have a boyfriend and I like 2 boys :)  They're so god damn cute!|`|Cr4lmfIxaa	Honestly, yes I have. However, at that point I wasn't completely happy in my current relationship. I wanted more and I found it in the woman I liked. I know my girlfriend at the time did the best she could, but I was not content with the situation. <br>  <br>  Am I happier with the woman I am with now? Truth be told, yes. My current girlfriend satisfies me intellectually more so than my previous girlfriend. She and I are also more compatible on a personality level. I really believe that people should go for the things they truly desire in life as well as the things that are better for themselves.|`|ff545BLyaa	Yes, and I cheated....  Sorry :)|`|TPud8FMFaa	nope|`|xuYIkfEsaa	ya|`|ce1cb786eea06a723de252998d40455baa	Figure out who you care about more.   The double life could kill ya ;-)|`|gAGID8kRaa	girls do too

That's a subtle first move and it'll get a lot accomplished.
1nN3v4foaa	So so many things, ask them out, can't look them in the eye, ignore them, can't talk to them.  The best thing to do is have eye contact and you can learn a lot from the look.|`|c282b658121c083eb61a50380f3c922daa	- we will always like to be with the girl most of the times.
AA00000203	If a man has converted to Islam, then he is a Muslim under Islamic law, and not haram for a Muslim woman to marry.|`|YrqMrVfOaa	no it's not haram... becoz once he's converted, he's considered a muslim and thus a marriage between a muslim and another muslim is halal (permitted)|`|8o7s9tynaa	I believe so.

I think he always secretly did, which is why it hurt him so much when he thought you were offering some sort of relationship, then he realized you didn't want him.<br>  He's acting like an *** because that's how guys act when they're hurt. They're trained not to show weakness like we do, so in order to avoid looking like a p*ssy, he avoided talking to you.<br>  It hurt him to hear that you thought he was trying to use you for sex, because in his mind, all he's ever done is try to make you feel safe and loved.|`|kdksssi4aa	yes after 6 to 8 months and than acts like that,   wants one thing.

Try to not make it totally random, because then it looks prepared and kinda dorky.  Just laugh at her jokes, and make an extra effort to talk to her.  She'll get the message.

It doesn't refer to Madonna the singer BTW.<br>  <br>  I hear so many people rationalize their 'mans' behavour this way, they are 'wired that way' or it's hormones'... as if they have no 'moral compass'. If that was true, we'd have a society full of sociopaths, rapists and perverts.<br>  <br>  People are pleasure seeking creatures, thats just as much a rationalization as any.<br>  <br>  With all of the above in mind, I did not have strippers at my stag, I would not allow it.

He use to be really really into me, then he really just kinda lost interest. idk i think its a guy thing. Just give it a little more time. But you need to show him that you are not going to wait around 4ever, even if you will, make him jealous in other words.

HKkbqlIuaa	Actually, I don't think it's right of you to expect your friend to change who she is or who she's become. It's her life, and these are her choices. If you want to stay friends with her, you need to accept her for who and what she is. If not, then just leave her be. You should either just go your own way or deal with it. Asking someone to change like that is just peer pressure. I'm not trying to be rude, but when you think about it's almost like you're telling your friend: "Hey, I really liked who you were before. It would make my life a lot more pleasant if you could change again. I don't really care about your feelings or anything, but I would appreciate if you could be who I want you to be instead of who you want to be yourself." If you're truly her friend, you shouldn't expect this from her.|`|WOd9zBOjaa	Hmm.<br>  I have this same problem too. What I do is just try to avoid her..

yNYZdlwkaa	Several years I was in a similar situation to what you are describing.  I really wanted to talk to my parents about what was going in my life.  But I didnt want to get in trouble for things that I had done in the past.  I just want to have their helping in getting my life back in order.<br>  <br>  What I did is this, personally at the time I talked to my mom a little better than my dad, so i went up to her and said mom I am having some problems at school and with life.  And I would really like your and dads help with them. The only thing is that by sharing this stuff with you I am afraid that I will be getting myself in trouble with you.  <br>  Is there anyway that I can talk to you guys, and be honest with you about what is going on without getting in trouble.  <br>  <br>  I actually asked my mom for an hour of immunity.  And it was probably the best thing that I could have done.  I got everything out there, I got help with what I needed and my life got easier because my parents appreciated that I was willing to come to them for help and be honest about it.. Parents apprecaite honesty.<br>  <br>  So my advice is ask your parents for your hour of immunity!  You will find that your parents want to help you more than they want to punish you!  Parents are there to help you learn and grow.  So give your parents a chance to help you!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Easy, don't make mistakes. Don't do anything you wouldn't want your parents to know about.|`|fBdtvrWdaa	Just tell them and tell them that you want help. They will probably respect you for recognizing that you need their help and coming to them before it gets too bad. You might get in a little bit of trouble but at least you will be getting help and you will know that you aren't in it alone. I had a situation that I kept to myself and when it came to light, at first it sucked but now I realize how lucky I was to have my parents there to help me. Good luck :)|`|hvcjyEmDaa	just be brave, take a deep breath, and tell them what is happening and that you need help. If you trust your parents, that they want the best for you and will help you, then go ahead and talk to them, even if it is painful. If you feel you can't talk to them because they may react violently, then talk to a school counselor, pastor, or other trusted adult. Best of luck.|`|ijmcG1ziaa	You can always tell your parents.  You're probably uncertain if you want to because they will always be there to judge you.  At the same time, they are the only ones that will forgive you regardless of anything.  They are your parents, and they love you, and they will respect you a lot if you show maturity, and tell them how you feel.  They may get upset right now, though they will help you through your toughest times.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	I don't know what your relationship is with you parents is.

You have to tell him how you really feel, it is the only way to have an honest, open, mature relationship.  If he really loves you, he should be willing to wait for you.  IMO, you can still move in with him because that will be a true test of how strong your relationship actually is.  I can guarantee it will be a huge eye opener for you both.  If you can stand each other after six or so months of co-habitating, then think about getting engaged.

M7NFiBBBaa	Go over to her house all weekend long with a box of tissues. A good friend is there through the good and they bad and this is deffinitly the bad. Everyone makes mistakes and you need to be by her side although everyone else is talking behind her back. Talk to her about what you've noticed and how you feel about it and how you're worried. Don't make it to harsh because she might have understood already what she did and how terrible it was. Give her your advise about her boyfriend. And don't leave her side, she will be forever greatful and you will be saving her future! <br>  Good Luck <br>  You're doing the right thing!|`|o80aAQV2aa	What you have to do is first talk to her. Maybe she is going through something hard right now. Do not make assumptions! Remember to tell her how you feel without being rude or mean. Maybe tell her why you think her boyfriend is doing this to her or ask her why she is acting like that. As for the pictures, that's just something that people at school have to get bored with. I hope you get your normal friend back!|`|u9IMNd7Iaa	That's seriously not good. Did she purposely send naked pictures to everyone, or did someone else send them to be mean? LOL.<br>  <br>  A lot of girls are slutty for different reasons. She might just be craving attention, or maybe she doesn't have high self esteem. You need to talk to her about it, tell her that she's being different, not respecting herself, and that you CARE about her. Let her know that she's better than how she's acting.<br>  <br>  You seem like a good friend.

Also doing squats ^-^|`|JofcuUQ8aa	From a former personal fitness trainer,  lunges and squats.  Good form is very important, not only for safety, but to get the best results!  If you need to see a demonstration,  just google it.  If you are already working out, you may incorporate these exercises into your routine.  Personally, I recommend a "leg day", which would be the day you do these exercises and only focus on legs.  2 or 3 different exercises, and 3 sets each, with 10-15 repetitions per set, rest 2-3 minutes between your sets.  Start out light until you've conditioned yourself to add weight.  You want your last rep of each set to be almost failure.  You will be sore the next day, and some times even more so, the day after that.  If you are so sore you are almost crippled, cut back on the weight.  Feed your muscles with a good protein source within 2 hours after your work out for best results.  If you do not feed your muscle, it will begin to eat itself, for lack of a better analogy, so don't skip your protein, or you will end up with no butt at all, lol.   Give it a good couple of months of consistency and you will begin to see a beautiful behind.  Trust me!  <br>  Also, if you aren't into weights, sprinting is the next best thing.  Just look at Carl Lewis's butt.|`|pLnCUaF1aa	get one of those pumps they use to inflate basketballs ;) ahah jk, do squats, and also push stuff, i used to push carriages and you feel the burn in your bum after a while.|`|BNrlqFOhaa	Try clenching your butt cheeks together as you walk.

Be aware though that this method will put weight on every part of your body - not just your butt.<br>  If you want a more toned butt, then Google 'butt exercises'. Sounds weird, but it'll work xD
sr4BAblpaa	Deffinetly let him know how you feel-don't allow him to walk all over you.  This is not one of those situations where you can just be like "OH...he's still got feelings for someone else.  I'm just gonna turn the other cheek."  This sounds like a mind over matter situation to me...and in my mind, I think the matter is you should tell him exactly how you feel and what you've been noticing about his odd behavior (i.e. not wearing his engagement ring).  Ask him why he hasn't been wearing it-but don't make it look like you've been snooping because then he may not trust you-he has a right to his own life, too (yadda-yadda)...and that may lead to him snooping into your life, thinking YOU'RE the one who's insecure, or making it seem that way.  You need to let him know that he has to take full responsibility for his actions and that you won't stand for it if he doesn't.  Make him wear that engagement ring with pride.  Also, if this continues, I would go to a marraige counselor.  That can also help in this situation, I think.  I hope I helped you a little (:|`|k4aXr7Nyaa	Dear Stella,<br>  <br>  If I were you I would leave well enough alone, and not worry about it too much, lest you come home one day and find your pet rabbit in a pot of boiling water.

I would rather date a man who has an addiction to hard drugs or painkillers, or who can't help but steal from me to support a severe gambling habit.  better yet, find yourself a nice gentleman who is a control freak with an anger management problem and a nasty jealous streak, who takes his frustrations out with his fists.  at least when he's hitting you, you'll know it's because he loves you and you won't have to worry about what he's doing every Sunday morning.<br>  <br>  2.  never trust a woman named Sue.  when I was a child, that damn ghost on pac-man always caused me to lose the game.  so as a general rule, I stay away from all Sues.  When I do see a Sue, I generally run away or look for large power pellets that will give me the power to eat them.<br>  <br>  3.  One night while he's asleep, just glue that darn ring right onto his finger.  Use an industrial grade adhesive that will really bind the ring to his skin.  if he sleeps thru that, this is a good sign- you can use that heavy sleeping to your advantage later on when you discover he's been cheating on you and you are forced to chop his penis off with a kitchen knife.<br>  <br>  4. Systematically cut him off from others.  First, make sure he never talks to another woman again.  Then forbid him from spending time with his male friends and associates, because you know they're just out to help him cheat.  And finally, insist that his mother has ruined him and cut him off from his family.  That might seem extreme, but you don't want his family convincing him that you're a controlling psycho who is has no self-esteem.  When you've successfully cut him off from everyone else, than he will have no choice but to look to you for everything.<br>  <br>  5. finally, the ace up the sleeve-- fake a life threatening illness, or even better- a pregnancy.  It will fill him with guilt and cause him to refocus his commitment towards you.<br>  <br>  Follow these simple instructions and you will be guaranteed a lifetime of happiness.|`|k9RNH7Weaa	Let's call this "Sue", "trampy whore" for the sake of my argument. Next, we'll call your fiancee "douche" to make this easier for everyone to follow.<br>  <br>  I think that you should first find out where "trampy whore" lives and pay her a visit. Bring her flowers and cookies to make her think that you are making friends. Hint: you really aren't. Invite her to go out with you and "douche". Maybe eat some ice cream, play some miniature golf. No one can resist ice cream and miniature golf, if she does, you know that there's something wrong. It's probably deeper than her being in love with "douche" she's probably a Communist. Only Communists don't like ice cream and miniature golf. They also like bears and hate crunchy peanut butter, but I digress.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, let "douche" do his own thing, just keep an eye on him. By keep an eye on him I really mean, stalk him. Do it inconspicuously. Hide in the bushes, check to see if he smells like "trampy whore" when he comes home at 3AM. Actually, if he comes home at 3AM and you aren't out with him, do you really think you need to smell him? Plus, if he isn't with "trampy whore" he's probably out at a strip club getting pleasure from them.<br>  <br>  Back to "trampy whore" once you have her reeled in and you two are best friends, considering she isn't a Commy, that's when you attack. Convince her to go fetch water from the well. When she asks why you still "fetch" water from an actual well, tell her that only Communists question your water retrieval methods. When she does go to the "well" which is really just a deep pit that you dug while "douche" was out getting a lamp dance from a one armed stripper named "Lefty", push her in. Giver her some food and a straw and start covering her with dirt, now it's up to "trampy whore" to fight her way out, hopefully she watched McGuiver when she was a kid.<br>  <br>  Then, just wait. Either "douche" will start wearing his ring again, and fall in love with you all over again or he'll still not wear his ring and still smell like a one armed stripper. In that case, you probably pushed the wrong person in the hole. Ooops.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped.|`|9yIX1F3xaa	If it is really bothering you then you have to say something to him.  I had a similar issue with my now husband.  His ex was calling him for a long time when we were dating.  I know that he never cheated but he would talk to her once in a while when she called because he didn't want to hurt her feelings.  She then decided she would try to get him back and started to try to cause issues between us.  It was rough for a while ( a couple months) but I knew how much I loved him and that he loved me and I wasn't going to let her ruin that.  We had a serious talk I told him that I didn't want him even talking to her anymore he understood my reasons were not that I was jealous of her because I knew he would never go back to her but that she was hurting our relationship.  He stopped answering her calls and after about a month she stopped calling at all.  We are now happily married and expecting our first child.  You need to talk to him and explain how you are feeling.  If he is willing to work it out then he is  "keeper" if not then better to find out now before you get married.
JPBh5WT3aa	I think your wife talked to strange men to try to get a closer understanding of what you might be going through.  Perhaps you aren't sharing that part of you with her.  <br>  <br>  Your wife talking to male strangers in a chat about the miscarriage is forgivable.  You talking to an ex is not.  These are two entirely different things.....and I think you know that.  Do the right thing and don't bring your ex into your life.  Your wife has feelings and they should matter.|`|a66nvk0taa	Adam you need to stop helping this ex and give comfort to your wife. She still has problems coming to terms about this miscarriage. Seem that there is no communication between both of you. You got sit down and talk this out. Strange she has to talk about this to men in chat rooms. She should be talking to you.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	I think she shouldn't have talked to strange men about it.  I think there are plenty of legitimate websites and forums to get support from losing a baby without "chatting" with strange men.  I think it was a form of emotional cheating, and I think she should have came to you and made it clear that she needed emotional support from you.<br>  <br>  I think that you shouldn't be spending ANY time alone with another woman, let alone someone you used to be intimate with.  Why not invite the ex over and help her at the kitchen table while your wife is there?  Why do you need to be alone with her?|`|3iNobwVraa	Weird.  I can't imagine random men being interested in that kind of thing.  And why would anyone want to discuss this with anyone other than a very close friend.  That's odd.  No judgments, I just can't relate, at all.<br>  <br>  But, yeah, she has a double standard.  It's awesome yeah?  Don't know about you, but I'm WAY the h*ll over it!!|`|bQpIctgPaa	I think as long as she is sharing with you as much as ever, then she's probably not seeking out attention from others by being forthcoming.  Did you see what was written, or did she tell you about the conversations?|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Its called her having a double standard. You shouldn;t be meeting with an ex and she needs to purge her freinds list.|`|cDC1FHTDaa	I think your wife is still hurting about the miscarriage, and for some reason she feels she can not talk to you. I don't know how you feel about a miscarriage. But I have a good friend who was like a little sister to me and she had a miscarriage. Me being the guy who know nothing about a women feeling I told her "why are you upset? It is not like the baby was born." I will NEVER forget the hurt she felt right at that moment. It took her over a hour to just stop crying. I was not trying to hurt her feeling, I thought I was saying some right. I could have been more wrong in my life. After about 2 hours we sat and talk. I did not think of a baby that was not born as a baby. But sometimes that is what some people think. Maybe she thinks that you don't have her back. Maybe she feel you think that she "just needs to move on." Trust me she will.. when she is ready. What she needs is time, and you do need to talk and support her.<br>  This is just a side thought, you might also look into getting her some medical help..|`|VygBNA0Waa	she spoke to strangers on the chat site she doesn't know them so it was like a counseling session <br>  your ex is a person that you see touch talk to  and you use to date <br>  that's a real person in her eyes <br>  on the chat site in her eyes its not real people she doesn't have to see them or speak to them any more|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Sometimes you want to talk to people anonymously - just like you're doing right now.  You rarely get an honest answer from the people who love you.  <br>  <br>  As for the friend and the paper, she's probably just a little jealous because you've had sex with them before.|`|H6Lc79EOaa	1st, she just needed some guy opinions, just like you are looking for opinions from strangers right now.
54042690d0ee8dda741121976af71b28aa	What the hell is wrong with all these people attacking you?! Also, the information that no reputable doctor would perform it is absolute crap. It's true these days that a doctor will insist you watch a video and take some time to think about it but you're still of legal age to make the choice. <br>  <br>  I personally would have waited but it's your decision, your body and your life. On the bright side, no woman will ever be able to get child support from you while attempting to keep your child away from you. Just be honest with any woman you meet and you won't have a problem. Last time I checked, there are women that also prefer not to have children.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You know it's funny that anyone would give me a thumbs down.  If this was a young woman saying "I got my tubes tied today. What do you think?" I seriously doubt people would be calling her stupid and put her down so harshly. I personally don't care what an adult does with their body but apparently some of you do. Unbelievable!|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Congrats - but a warning (hubby did this).  Do NOT tell the girls you are dating that you have a V.  Because you can use it for insurance - if she ever says to you "guess what?  I'm pregnant" - you KNOW you are not the father.<br>  <br>  But if you are serious about marrying someone, they need to know that you can't have kids before you marry them.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	I felt the same way at 23 (didn't get clipped...but I was considering it).<br>  <br>  Now I'm 29 and very motivated to have a family, settle down, and raise some good looking boys and girls.<br>  <br>  I think you've made a mistake. You'll regret it later down the road.<br>  <br>  I hope you keep some in deep freeze. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	It's personal choice. why do you care what we think?<br>  <br>  But since you asked. I think you have acted in haste. What happens when you 'grow up' and fall inlove, get married, and your wife wants children? <br>  <br>  Vasectomy reversals are not always successful.|`|fMEypXDYaa	No child support in the future for you then, still use protection for a few days as you still have a few left in there.|`|I814g6ZBaa	Congrats, Guy!!<br>  Keep it wrapped up for a while yet... there's still bullets in that gun!!!|`|oeEsnwSMaa	I don't think a doctor would do this at a young age,without children..So why are you telling us this???????|`|jLYTKr33aa	Yeah, and you say you also performed one 15 minutes ago.  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Av2zDoUcUOoD29R4t1OcyCDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219145318AAGutoy">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  What do I think?

I ask because the only other person I know who had the big V so young had been horribly abused by his father and wanted to break the cycle of violence.|`|jBigEy0Caa	No reputable doctor would have done that.

Here is the reference:<br>  <br>  OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent of scrotal pain in men before and after vasectomy, to produce accurate data for the benefit of men considering this procedure, and hence improved informed consent about the outcomes, as chronic scrotal pain after vasectomy is a poorly quantified clinical problem. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between November 2004 and January 2006 nine surgeons carried out vasectomies in 625 men (mean age 39.9 years, sd 5.6) under local anaesthesia. A questionnaire was devised to establish the presence of any scrotal or testicular pain, and to characterize this discomfort; 6 months after the procedure a modified version of the same questionnaire was administered. RESULTS: In all, 593 (94.7%) men returned the preoperative questionnaires and were entered into the study; 488 (82.2%) of these completed the follow-up questionnaire, giving a mean (sd) follow-up of 6.8 (1.6) months. In all, 65 men reported new-onset scrotal pain at 7 months (14.7%). The mean visual analogue score for this pain was 3.4/10. Four men (0.9%) in the responding group described pain after vasectomy as 'quite severe and noticeably affecting their quality of life'. CONCLUSION: At 7 months after vasectomy about 15% of previously asymptomatic men have some degree of scrotal discomfort. These early data indicate that chronic scrotal pain after vasectomy is a genuine entity, but a longer-term follow-up in this group will be important to allow further evaluation of how this pain develops with time. Leslie et al, BJU Int. 2007 Dec;100(6):1330-3.<br>  <br>  This risk makes vasectomy a poor choice. The incidence of regret and a fifty percent divorce rate make the permanence of vasectomy a drawback also.<br>  <br>  In addition, vasectomy causes testicular damage and fibrosis over time and this has been biopsy proven (irrefutable) in at least five medical studies since 1985:<br>  RESULTS: A significant increase in interstitial fibrosis was observed along with the obstructive interval (p < 0.001). Johnsen's mean score count did not associate with the obstructive interval. CONCLUSION: Interstitial lesions of testicular physiology and pathophysiology can be evaluated using the NIH-Image. Interstitial fibrosis, but not the intraseminiferous status, reflects the irreversible damage of vasectomized testes. Aktuelle Urol. 2003 Jul;34(4):262-4.<br>  <br>  Here is another reference: CONCLUSION(S): Vasal obstruction results in significant reductions in germ cells in the later stages of spermatogenesis and increases in testicular fibrosis, both worsening with an increasing obstructive interval. Testicular damage after vasectomy might impact upon the prospects for reversal. Fertil Steril. 2004 Jun;81(6):1595-603.<br>  <br>  You see, these results are irrefutable, biopsy proven, but you never see them on vasectomy consent forms. This is unethical and should be illegal. The current vasectomy consent process is flawed. The current acceptance of vasectomy as completely safe is a cultivated myth and men should not have to do their own research to have this information before the procedure. After you read some of this stuff, you will feel duped by the brochures that advertise vasectomy.<br>  <br>  Hey, don't take my word for it. Search the pubmed database yourself as noted below.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  The pubmed database: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/</a> - You can go there and use any search term you want for vasectomy.

No one deserves to be teased! And don't let it make you feel bad i know it's hard but know that you are wonderful and beautiful just the way you are and these kids have to make fun of you to feel better about themselves that is what teasing is about. Stay strong because they want it to make you feel bad! Also let your parents know what is going on so they can talk to the school and possibly get there parents involved.|`|4CsGde1qaa	If you are a much older person than those kids, then normally I would suggest to ignore them.

If that is the case you should tell an adult, maybe a parent.  If not, lots of people have been teased when they were younger.  My advice would be to make close friends that you can talk to and have fun with.  You will focus less on bullies if you have people to laugh with.  I think if you are feeling trapped you can talk to a school counselor or a brother, sister, parent, or anyone that is supportive.|`|W46PN3eUaa	If they tease you, laugh at them. For they are insecure, obnoxious and likely not very bright. If they hit you, hit them back or tell someone else who can deal with them.<br>  <br>  "If evil is spoken of you and it is true, correct yourself, if it is false, laugh." -Epictetus|`|cWh9z8Bjaa	Remember that what you think of yourself is more important than what they think.

Good luck.|`|c1uqy4akaa	wow... that really is jacked up.. dont let them get to u... and what do they make fun of u about.. dont let them say crap to u that isnt true stand up for ur self cuz if u dont there gonna keep saying ****. so tell them to Fu** off and get a life because they obviously have nothing better to do.|`|DPkE9ho3aa	honestly if you don`t pay any attention to them they will eventually stop...and as far as hitting you..tell a teacher if they hit because no one should be hitting you for any reason whatsoever|`|aez3cIkvaa	Ignore them.|`|b6cuytMyaa	point out something bad about them.<br>  but don't make it sound stupid.|`|akMm8PnIaa	Confront them without becoming a bully or a jerk like them.  Preferably if you're with a few friends.  Tell those who bully you to stop; otherwise they'll feel as though they have power over you and can do anything they want.  Also, since this is already in the hitting stages, please tell a trusted teacher, tell your parents or other trusted adult, and go to the dean or principal with the situation.  Also, when you tell them to leave you alone, don't fall into the trap of telling them just how bad it makes you feel, but also let them know that it isn't fun or funny at all.|`|2VYqxF9baa	Ignore those kids. Laugh along with them when they make fun of you (even if you feel HORRIBLE inside) They won't know why your laughing and if you just laugh every time they make fun of you eventually they'll back off because they enjoy it when you get your feelings hurt but if you act like your feelings aren't hurt then that'll suck all the fun out of it for them and they'll stop!! And as for the hitting, if it's really bad you need to report them because it can be really dangerous!! Good luck!!!!!|`|FnScvcEaaa	there has to be something that you excel at, work at it.

You are indeed an original.  <br>  <br>  2)  Only those with low self-esteem will say the things like that to you.  It is wrong.  But that shows you he is in a good deal of internal pain.  What would you do if you saw a dog that was hit limping around?   If you tried to pick it up, it will bite.  See?   Just try to see that the adult in this situation is a human who has been injured but might not even know it. <br>  <br>  3)  Do your best at school - but not for others.  Do it for YOU.  Education is the one thing no one can take away from you.  Figure out what YOU like to study... and then find out how the subjects relate to what you like.  You don't even have to like the other subjects that way!<br>  <br>  I hope you read this and know that I am not answering just to answer.  got it?  ;-)|`|SrMw9ij3aa	being a virgin is something to be proud of,imagine how special the person you lose it to will feel when you find the right person that is. as for your father he might be embarressed to talk properly because you are a young lady and he probably wont understand some of your feelings.as for min wage etc it is just your fathers way of trying to encourage you although it might seem like criticism he wants and always will want the best for you.same with school they know what you are capable of and are just trying to push you on a bit further.sometimes families take each other for granted and dont realise how much they can get on your nerves and make you upset,this is just familiarisation and it happens in every family.it has got nothing to do with you you are still young and will make lots of mistakes as does everyone.one more thing NEVER GIVE UP NEVER EVER!|`|inCByaonaa	Ur Dad is the waster, not u.

7PDJFv0kaa	you aren't a bad person, you just don't know what you want. it sounds like you really want to be with your best friend, so I think you should go for that. if aren't completely committed with A then you shouldn't be with him. if you love B and you just like A, which should you be with??? B!!! :) good luck<br>  <br>  and btw, you know and care about B more.....|`|jY7lt3jkaa	you're not a bad person..you  just made a bad choice in boyfriends. maybe you should've been absolutely sure that you wanted to go out with A before you did. Since you starting liking B so soon after, maybe it wasnt the right choice.<br>  i suggest breaking up with A and seeing if you still like B. this could just be the rebellious side of you coming out & wanting a change in things. if you don't like B anymore after you broke up with A, don't go back to A. going back would be pointless and immature.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|JNCpyyYZaa	nah your not a bad person. your man should listen to that song by biz markee "you say he's just a friend" <br>  <br>  help <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219185344AARAR4B">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|F3o3EVtFaa	no youre not. i used to like 3 girls at once... i am now going out with the one i didnt like as much as the other 2 but i now i love her more than anything in the world. i am not saying you should definitely keep going out with the one you dont like, though. break up with A, and try to hook up with B. if that doesnt work, give A another try. but im sure it will work out great. good luck!|`|8QO17Xw1aa	if you love your best friend, go for it. you'll only make yourself sad if you dont and youre just leading your boyfriend on|`|OHeFwstVaa	do what makes you happy.|`|AMhUz87baa	Listen to your heart, it always knows the right choice....|`|XW38OlQwaa	what?|`|15a781a97ff5a5a5c3b8cb8d0530d63caa	Love is stronger that like.

Tell him that you are glad that it happened before you got a new place, because now you can save some money.  Tell him that when you care about someone, you care about them for better or worse, and you know that he wouldn't think worse of you if the tables were turned - and together, you will get through this slump.  (but make sure your mom is still okay with his staying there - she may think twice about it, so you need to get your signals straight with her, or maybe he'd better go back to his parents.  it wouldn't be the end of the world or your relationship if he did...)|`|pkja3qteaa	Help him build up his confidence.|`|U1BHQYngaa	first off, don't listen to the a-ss-holes who are going to say "dump his a*ss" cuz, they are so wrong, i have to say...<br>  <br>  he's going through a hard time right now, and you need to constantly remind him that it will get better, it just takes time. tell him that a lot of people are losing their jobs to the poor economy, and it's not his fault. remind him again and again how much you love him, and he will eventually come around.

fc5KHr6aaa	They could read a poem or scripture. We had our sister-in-laws read letters that we wrote to each other. (We didn't want to write our own vows but still wanted something personal.) You could have them seat the parents and/or grandparents instead of using the groomsmen. If any of them are good singers, they could sing a song. There's also the guest book attendant, but that's not part of the ceremony I guess. Some people say that being a server or cake cutter at the reception is an honor. However, I hate getting this job...it means I have to stand there the whole time instead of spending time with my husband and friends.|`|a94f95d3f6f56d95bbd9f49f3ff665a4aa	yeah a bridesmaid. its usually an honor|`|E2X6B1Iaaa	They could read a poem you pick out or sing a song for you guys.

QODJNf1oaa	I would give yourself some time because you don't want him to end up being a rebound relationship. If you want to give something new a fair chance then you have to wait until you fully get over your ex-boyfriend. And also, has your friend moved on?

I'm sure she'll be fine with it but she will respect you so much more for coming to her and letting her know before anything started.|`|PogMq7Pcaa	keep doing what you're doing. its not wrong or anything. its ok. if someone wants to show u affection in a time of your loss of a guy let them|`|Dj5f1SRfaa	tell him you are not interested in pursuing any sort of romantic relationship right now.  its simple, and best of all, its the TRUTH!|`|RvSHQtrXaa	Love is a dangerous thing.

That's all he wants. To bust a nut and then once he has tired of your body he is going to leave you. A Man serious about a relationship NEVER EVER goes after a girl who has just ended a relationship.

Make sure she knows that he is comming on to you and not the other way around.<br>  <br>  If she is ok with it, then its time for a little soul testing. How do you feel about your recent break up? Are you bouncing back? What are you doing to fill the voids left by the routine you had with your ex? Give yourself a good look and study your situation. <br>  <br>  What you dont want to do is start to fill the "blanks" left by your ex  with this new guy. That would be tricking yourself into not really growing out of your previous relationship. <br>  <br>  My suggestion is, take time to be by your own. Take on your hobbies, projects, contact old friends, enjoy having a nice time without anything from the dating deal going round your head. <br>  <br>  And in the end, if you really like your "best guy friend" you'll be able to give him the space he deserves in your life instead of just replacing the void of your ex with him (it all goes down on a subconcious level, its very sutle, so be careful). And, if he likes you back as well, he′ll be willing to hang around until you're ready to move onto another relationship.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope it helps.|`|d1146505ab631a2048838c8d6c4bf901aa	Sounds like he's more into you than you're into him. Best friends don't become lovers by default. From your description I see this going south fast.  He's interpreted your existing friendship as a sign that you're into him.  A common misconception. Situations like this often don't end well.  Be up front.  If you like him that way, let him know, but tell him if he needs to chill till you're ready. If you like him only as a friend tell him that.  If he can't take that for an answer, he really wasn't much of a friend to begin with and let it go.  You'll be better of in the long run.|`|yo9TVOFPaa	First of all, obviously he likes you, and hes touching you and being flirty with you all of a sudden because you are single now.<br>  If you are sure you don't want a relationship with him, I'd say let it be.  Don't mention anything, just in case, y'know, what if he didn't even like you that way anyways, which I doubt, but if you bring the relationship thing up and be like "oh hey, i like u but im not ready for a relationship.." or whatever that alone will make things awkward and could ruin a friendship.  If you think its too early for a relationship just wait it out, until you feel you are ready and if he is still there and sending those signals, first talk to your best friend, since that is her ex, even if it was years ago, you know how us girls are!  You don;t want any bullshit to happen...and if everything is a go, then maybe start talking to him about your feelings, and even bring up when you first broke up with whomever you sensed he had feelings for you and what not...do you get what I am saying?  Try that...|`|qpqxxEb1aa	see if he likes you first so you dont get the wrong message and ask your friend if she still likes him or not and if you do like him then go for it or wait until its the right time|`|IAocmfWvaa	He's coming on a little strong?<br>  Just see how it goes|`|EiRlMr6aaa	Well, <br>  <br>  You only get to live this life once. Many friends end up dating and they stay together longer. He knows who you are as a person and visa vera. Though, it is usually not healthy to get out of one realationship and jump to the next; live a little. Just make sure you are over your ex and your friend is not the "rebound guy"(this will surely end your friendship). <br>  <br>  Oh, then he is your bestfriend's ex. Wow. I don't know. How long have ya''ll been friends. Would she do this to you? Will this hurt her? Is she over him? Do you really want left overs? Do you yearn for him the way he does for you? Ask yourself these questions. Only then will you make the right decision.|`|vAN97azHaa	I think that you are right, it is much to early to be getting back into things with a new guy. Give yourself sometime to be single and enjoy life! Don't let this be a rebound.<br>   Secondly you need to ask yourself if you want to be in a relationship with your best guy friend. Sure he's great, that's why you're friends with him, but is he your type? <br>  As for whether or not it is worth the friendship I'd say it go for it. Relationships are great when they start as friendships, it gives you a great base to start from. And if you are truly great friends if things don't work out it shouldn't make to much of a difference.<br>  But first give yourself time to get over this last relationship! <br>  Good Luck!

u9IMNd7Iaa	Haha, well do you want her to strip for you in person? Or maybe she'll feel more comfortable stripping for you on webcam. I know you said you're friends, but are you possibly more than friends? If you want her to strip for you, I'm guessing that you are.<br>  <br>  You need to compliment her, and tell her how sexy of a body she has so that she feels comfortable flaunting it around you . You can even slip in a little hint that you love when girls strip for you. Put on sexxy music when you two hang out, see what happens.|`|Mih6UP5Faa	Okay so if you like someone a lot you wouldn't go out and ask her to strip for you. that isn't a good thing. Don't you want her to notice you? don't you want her as your girlfriend? If so then why are you asking her to strip? do you like her in her body only or do you like her as a personality?? It just doesn't go well if you just ask her to strip. she might think that you like her for her body and she might not like that and not talk to you anymore. I have to say if you are going to ask her to strip you might want to know her very very well and really like her. I mean as a boyfriend and girlfriend thing it is fine to ask but if you aren't a couple then she might think that you are a total jerk.|`|aCUTP68xaa	most are self conscious and don't feel right she may not|`|aXqi9lYJaa	You don't lol.<br>  <br>  Go to a strip club|`|HKkbqlIuaa	I wouldn't say offer to pay for pole dancing classes, but you could tell her you are going to take lessons and ask her to join you. Tell her it's just something you're doing for fun, and you'd be willing to pay for her lessons because you don't want to go alone. This is the deceptive way, lol. Depending on how comfortable you guys are with one another, you could just ask her to. If you aren't that comfortable with another, and she's not a stripper, I don't you're going to see her strip anytime soon though.|`|4Tioqd7jaa	MONEY !!!|`|jBigEy0Caa	Offer to pay for pole dancing lessons.|`|phznG0mnaa	Well marry her and then ask your wife .|`|aez3cIkvaa	Money you dolt.

cGbTJobeaa	It's odd that she isn't seating you together.  It sounds like the bride has this fairy tale image in her mind of one big happy family in which the divorce never existed.  The daughter should not be splitting up couples regardless if the couple is dad and future step-mom. Mom and dad are no longer a couple...no matter how much she wishes they were.<br>  <br>  DO NOT turn this into a war of wills or a major catastrophe.  Act like it is no big deal.<br>  <br>  However, your fiance should talk to his daughter and casually see if the seating cannot be rearranged to allow you to sit together.  Failing that, he should not make a big deal out of it and just nonchalantly move his chair to the table where you are seated.  No big deal....I'm just going to sit over here with my fiance.<br>  <br>  Otherwise...just suck it up and deal with it for a day.  Remember, you have to have a relationship with this girl for the rest of your life. Big picture; you're the adult. Big smile! Be gracious.|`|b6LcC0CEaa	It seems really tacky and kind of rude to have you seated separate from him, at a wedding where you don't really know anyone else. Personally, if your husband can't do anything about the seating arrangement (and he should be the one to talk to his daughter about it), I would politely decline.|`|WF8J4Yczaa	I was wondering the same thing|`|typarmrzaa	how does your fiance feel about it? maybe he could bring it to her attention that it is not an ideal seating arrangement.|`|cYa5blUJaa	i dont think thats really fair, does your fiancee and his ex get along at all?|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Nope you are wrong.  The parents bury the hatchet on this day and sit together.  You keep your mouth shut and smile.  It is the daughter's day and her decisions.  Do not make a scene.  If this is too uncomfortable for you then you should stay home.|`|DCXss6Odaa	What a nasty girl, unfortunately you have to suck it up! Act like it doesn't bother you, its only for one night. It's for your Fiance. Not for her, be the better person.<br>  Yes its wrong, but its called Karma. She will get her own back one day, and I am sure will apologise, maybe when she grows up and has a child of her own.<br>  My parents are divorced, if my parents got along, which they don't I would still sit them next to their new partners, I wouldn't seperate any other guests, so why should I seperate my parents.<br>  <br>  On the evening, you will probably still be able to sit together, and if not, make it a good point to get to know other family members. Look at the positives that can come out of the evening.<br>  <br>  Good luck
KWeU8LJtaa	Your mom is right, it's completely your choice. However, if I were in your shoes, I'd choose your step-dad.<br>  <br>  My "dad" was never around,and isn't invited to my wedding (neither is anyone from his side of the family).My uncle is going to walk me down the aisle. He has been more of a father to me than anyone else, and that's all that matters to me. <br>  <br>  So if you don't want him or his family there, don't invite them. Simple as that. But, don't keep them away because of a family issue that might be worked out in the future. If you think there's a chance that you and your father/that side of the family will be able to work things out later on in life..invite them. <br>  <br>  In my case, I know there's no chance of that happening.<br>  <br>  You can still have your step-dad walk you down the aisle, just make sure you aren't going to regret not having your biological father and his family there at all.|`|xHKRGEg4aa	If your father gets upset, tell him that your step dad has acted more as a father to you than he has thats why you want your real dad to walk you down the aisle, the man who's been there for you. It would be awkward not to invite your dad at all, but thats your choice.|`|kHEFi3ttaa	Maybe just having him there but not walking you. I understand wanting your step dad to do it, he's more of a father now then your bio dad. But not including him all together (as in not inviting him) seems well petty. Like you're getting back at him for being an a$$ all these years. Be the bigger person and send him an invite.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and congratulations|`|cWl5pJ01aa	You should have whom you want at your wedding. Just because someone is blood doesn't mean that they're really family. Let me explain, being family is more than just about bloodlines. Its about being there for someone. If it were me I'd pick my stepdad. Yes it is the right thing.|`|CwLjUPebaa	The man who loves you and treats you like a daughter, the man who acts like a father, is the man who deserves the honor of walking you down the aisle. Looks like step dad is THE MAN. <br>  You are making the right decisions.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	well then do what makes you happy. Have your step dad walk you down the aile and invite who you want. it is your wedding so make the most of your day.|`|xoIc4C6Eaa	When I was married 12 years ago, both my dad and step-dad walked me down the aisle. I don't think that is really an option for you because it sounds like you don't really want your biological father there at all. So my advice, make you decision and stick to it but be willing to accept the consequences of your decision.|`|aipChC3haa	It says your "father" walks you down the aisle.<br>  In your case, the real father is your step-dad.<br>  He is the one who raised you, loved you, dealt with you and cared about you.<br>  Your real father didn't do any of these things, so your step-father should DEFIANTLY walk you down the aisle.|`|AgpthVMcaa	I think that this is completely your choice. If your real father questions this, just say that your step father and you have a very special bond and you cannot help the way you feel in terms of who you are closer to. You could explain to him that it is no one's fault and this is simply a matter of who has played a larger role in your life. Good luck|`|sLwmzvi8aa	i have the same thing going on... except im not getting married... my dad has not been there for me... so i would say that if you invite your grandmother then you should invite your dad too... its only fair to him...<br>  <br>  if you invite him then he does not feel left out... and if he does not show up then its his fault, not yours... i hope all goes well (congrats)|`|15c8ad2687584eea83444b4419958919aa	Its your wedding and its your day, you do what you feel in your heart is the best. There is no write or wrong way to do anything at your wedding. <br>  <br>  If you biological father doesn't understand, sit him down and explain it to him.|`|wmoKm4jHaa	hmm. i would think that'd be a good idea, after all, it is YOUR day!! and its supposed to be the best day of your life. do it how u wanna!! and yeah, have u tried talkin to ur dad?|`|wocysvHIaa	I'm not sure if you can, but have both of them walk you|`|ALQFHnHTaa	There are a lot of unanswered questions here. Why were you not allowed around his place? Who made that decision? Are you blaming your father when it might not be his fault? Will his mother come if you shun her son? Are you willing to take the consequences of your actions. Might you want your father in your life for your children's sake? These are questions for you to sort out and come up with answers to. <br>  <br>  I understand why you would want your stepfather to escort you down the aisle and I think that is not a bad idea. What I think may be a bad idea is to not invite your father and his family to your wedding. If for no other reason than to not ever have it said that "you didn't  even invite your father."  You then become the bad guy. It's always a nice gesture to invite people you have to and perhaps they will not come or perhaps they will. Either way, you're better than they are.|`|61ebb98dbcf0e5b37666270ad52df781aa	my step-dad is walking me down the aisle and i have not invited my biological father, but my situation is different than yours. i never had a good relationship with my father to begin with. in your situation, i would choose who you really want (step-father) to walk you down the aisle. then explain to your father your reasons. depending on his reaction, choose whether or not to invite him. no doubt he'll be hurt, but maybe it'll be a wake up call and make him think about the way he's treated you the past few years. if he freaks, i would consider not inviting him. you don't need to add anymore stress to your busy day.|`|WKYqqZDFaa	i know exactly how you feel!! im having my 15th birthday party, and well my mom and dad divorced when i was like 6 and well my dad was never (hes still isn't) there for me, i don't have a step dad or anything, but i don't want my dad to go my quinceanera! i told my mom that i don't want him to go. but my mom does. well to answer your question:) i don't think it's wrong, because i mean instead of him looking for you and caring for you all he did was leave you basically. and remember A FATHER IS THE ONE WHO RAISES NOT WHO CONCEIVES !!! <br>  hope it helped.
loqsl5xXaa	ask him about movies he likes/dislikes, music, tv shows. ask him if he likes animals, what kind if he has any, or what kind he wants to get. ask him if he likes or has gone camping, ask hims about his outdoor side. lol, as a joke as if he is a shower or bath kind of guy, ask him what was the strangest thing he has done or wants to do. ask him if he is a more jean and t-shirt guy or a dress shirt and slacks kind of person. (those can tell a lot of about he guy).. ask him what he was like in college/ HS (depending on how old you are of course). If you are out of college then maybe what kind of field is he wanting to work in or what did he major in. what kind of sports does he play/watch.. if he has great hair ask what he uses. you can talk about politics...<br>  <br>  have fun!!|`|RvSHQtrXaa	First please encourage a social setting before asking a guy questions.  The situation might not be right, and also the moment not conducive for social interactions.<br>  <br>  If you have a date, and perhaps you are in a park on a park bench, watching the birds or pigeons perching, you can begin asking him questions and have confidence in asking.  <br>  <br>  I ask ladies questions like this and I have 100% response.<br>  <br>  "Boy, Mr. He must be lucky to have a pretty lady like".  That starts a conversation so easy.  If that lady has dimples, and you are fund of dimples, tell her about them.  Simple things can trigger the best from a woman.  You may be surprised.|`|eNfTWtDHaa	what he likes to do, plans for the future, fav types of movies, fav color, fav animal, fav book/author...|`|hDPtaQwWaa	Ask about his favorites... favorite movie, band, food, holiday...|`|YvRfCSxiaa	some quetions i would ask would be wat type of gurls he likes and maybe what he wants for his future..dont be shy to ask questions.|`|Y6jOPMboaa	Ask him if he likes  a .45 or a 92|`|nOezzy5caa	ask him about things you like to do and see if he has them in common?
f61c6ad75081d1de726d4e9737429211aa	Someone who can only feel comfortable around you if you "shut up" isn't a good friend choice.  Mind you, she SHOULD be able to get a word in edgewise, but it could be many things...<br>  She's the only child at home<br>  She's the oldest child at home<br>  This is how SHE is treated at home<br>  She needs you to set boundaries for her<br>  <br>  You need to learn (young) to kindly tell people when what they are saying or doing-offends.  It gets easier with practice.  Don't be like me, passing up all the best opportunities to learn.  I have had many, but usually am not quick enough with my reply...if I do.  It is a goal of mine to change this.  <br>  <br>  So, if you really value her friendship, start telling her "my friends don't always tell me to 'shut up', so I guess you aren't my friend:-).<br>  It will probably go over like a lead balloon, but stick to your point.  Real friends don't treat their friends like that.  Just don't hang with her.|`|jUgiyJe9aa	talk to the others ... and tell her all together that you like her ... but not the way she is with you guys... maybe she has problems at home ... try to talk to her alone ask her if she has something on her heart and needs a real friend.... but do confront her tell her she will loose every friend she has if she keeps acting like that... and if this is what she wants|`|u9IMNd7Iaa	Ew, she does sound really annoying. Well hun, do you guys EVER have fun together? Is it worth sticking around and being her friend? If she's treating you badly and you don't like her there's no point in hanging out at lunch. You deserve better. Try to talk it out and makeup, though :)|`|Rih79dHNaa	ok well i would say get a new friend. friends are some one who can take a joke and if you are not having fun with her that should have been your first clue.<br>  <br>  <br>  ps  what school do u go to i might know her/him|`|sFASHCNRaa	wow.....do your other friends feel the same way as you? if so talk to them about her...and like...confront her about it.<br>  <br>  you guys don't deserve to be treated like crap, especially if she's only nice half the time.<br>  <br>  -___________-<br>  <br>  if she thinks shes so much better than you guys, she can find OTHER FRIENDS.<br>  <br>  and wow i'm still sorta shocked this is happening at age 11..

It could be tied with pink and white ribbon, or black ribbon to use all three colors.<br>  <333|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Gawd, what a rotten color scheme!  Please don't invite me to your wedding if that's your plan!|`|JtEBaOdjaa	My colours are black and hot pink. I LOVE IT!  The bridesmaid dresses are actually a hot pink with a sheer black fabric over top. (it's nicer than it sounds hahaha).  Oddly enough the colour scheme was picked by my fiance as I normally HATE pink lol.  When he picked it I looked it up and thought it'd be cool.<br>  I am carrying lilies, the ones with the pink centres. (and my wedding is in August..also summer)<br>  <br>  I think yours will be awesome!  The girls should probably carry white flowers.  If you are wearing white and carrying pink, they'll be wearing pink and carrying white...it'll look so cool!|`|19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	I think it's bold and daring.  I love it.  Roses can get kind of pricey so how about having the girls carry bougets w/ a few white roses and mostly pink gerber daisies.  You could use those flowers for your centerpieces.  Best of luck.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	I'd call it a black/white/ and hot pink wedding and they should probably carry white roses.|`|sLwmzvi8aa	my step mom had those colors... it was really nice...  the girls should be carrying the same color roses but in a smaller arrangement.. like less roses then you...|`|ALQFHnHTaa	I'm sorry but I have to disagree with most of the replies you have gotten. No, they should not carry white roses. No, they should not carry hot pink flowers. White is bridal. Hot pink, first of all, you will never match the dress color exactly.  Second, you don't want the flowers to be the same color of the dresses. You need a contrasting color. You don't wear the same color scarf as the dress you are accessorizing. <br>  <br>  Go visit several florists with the color of the gowns. If you can't get a piece of fabric that is the same color, get some ribbon that is. Try a craft store. Then, ask the florists what they  think will go with the hot pink. She can show you different flowers in different colors and you can decide what you think looks good. The florist can spray the flowers any colors that you want.|`|EGao9rQKaa	ummm i've seen a wedding with  a lot of hot pink. it really does not look very good..specially when looking back...at pictures. i mean, i love the color scheme and i love hot pink but not really for a wedding...not as one of the main colors. only in accents. maybe consider black/white with soft pink or black/white with plum. OR you could do just black/white with small accents of hot pink....like, the girls could wear little black dresses and carry hot pink gerber daisies and you could have just hot pink centerpieces. just keep the hot pink to a  minimum and it will stand out in a good way.|`|FkYEEOzoaa	Hello, I am a wedding videographer and I have a video online of the exact color scheme you are describing!  Everything looked incredible and I totally reccommend it!  Check out my video, and you'll see why I think you're on to something with the hot pink!

8vcU9F2Jaa	Bad place to ask kiddo
yo9TVOFPaa	Did he actually tell you straight up that he didn't like you?<br>  I've had this problem before, the guy would say he never liked me, but he sent totally different signals, it turns out he was acting like that because he's not that type of guy to share his feelings and whatever, hes not "mushy" he said.<br>  But if he is extremely shy, he might just not have the nerve to actually say yes I do like you, he could be afraid of rejection.  My fiance and I always talk about past relationships and stuff like that, and he missed out on SOOO many chance with girls because he was REALLY REALLY shy.  When we first dated he was sooo shy with me, but I am very outgoing especially if I like a guy.  Anyways he always told me that he would be really nice to a girl he liked, but he couldn't tell her that he liked her, so she would move on.  I think you just have to ask him about it, but try to make it easy.  Say something like...well start off telling him how you feel, and tell him that you've been sensing this connection between the two and ask how he feels, and just say I wanna know if I am trying to make something out of nothing, almost like you wanna know if hes wasting your time, but dont say it like that.  I cant think of a way to ask him right now, but say it like that in different words.  Hope this helped, let me know if I am confusing you, I jump all over when I am answering these questions.|`|8QO17Xw1aa	he likes you. he's just really shy like you said. he's not going to be the one doing the asking, so i think it's up to you to ask him out. i say go for it|`|GqL8VD9aaa	If he's only TALKING to u, then maybe, tiny maybe, that he likes u...if he makes a physical contact touch, maybe he does like u.<br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219183250AADRqWX&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|wpd56qtEaa	maybe you should admit to him you like him first so hell feel more comfortable to admit himself.

Just wait it out.|`|YBvOE1IFaa	he likes you talk to him and straight up ask him|`|Xokco4E1aa	With guys, it seems to always be confusing for girls. From my experience, I've learned that some guys act like that because:<br>  <br>  A) They actually do like you, but they are afraid of rejection and getting hurt. <br>  B) He might like you, he's not quite sure. So he flirts with you a lot to try and see if there's chemistry. But since he's not sure if he likes you he won't say if he likes you or not.<br>  C) He's one of those jerkish guys who just like to flirt with as many girls as possible to say "Yeah, she likes me. Haha" or to show his friends that he's a 'ladies man' and can get whoever he wants.

This guy is a waste of your time. Seriously.... I know your heart prob still likes him but listen to your brain about this one. He is using you..... if he only wants to text you and not see you in person it sounds like he just wants someone to text when he is bored while he has someone else there with him while your text him. Don't waste your energy with this *** and start looking for someone else you wants to see you and hang out with you.... you know ! What a boyfriend is supposed to do.|`|gRA0Jm2Naa	There are guys with the "female a switch- o- rama" disease. They will constantly flirt with girls but they don't really mean it. This here, is an example of a playboy. He will ask you out then forget about it, Then he will get pissed because he remember, but you didn't remind him. I would be majorly unhappy with that guy. He is insecure.<br>  <br>  BUT<br>  <br>  there are some boys who are naturally like this. They are very shy. They tend to say "your annoying" so that you will get mad, and possibly like them even more helplessly even more. There are many types of boys. I don't know what category that this boy falls underneath, but why don't you try to see what kind he is?|`|H3ktCe3Eaa	Next time he says "So I'm guessing you don't like me anymore?", just be like "Not if you're going to act like such an ***."<br>  It will get his attention and tell him that you're not going to put up with his crap.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Atmg.YYXO7xcawGvFUc3cHXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219184021AAa5lg4">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|eVLUIvDjaa	this kid sounds like a waste of seaman.<br>  <br>  move on, the kids a tool, you can do better.<br>  <br>  and i would never ask a girl out in texts or on aim or anything, it really does make a huge difference. <br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|oFKHFc7Naa	He wants to mess with your feelings.

If he can't care for you and he doesn't understand how you feel, he is not a fit. Just move on, a similar thing's happened to me with girls. I understand how you are. Just search for the right guy with both looks and a good personality who understands you.|`|Lc2pYDycaa	Ok well it probably took a lot of nerve for him to ask you out in the first place so maybe he was a little hurt when you didn't immediately say yes. so now he probably thinks he might embarrass himself again. if you still like him just explain to him you didn't mean anything by it and you wanna go out =)|`|dPKkjK8iaa	If he is mean to you and is not man enough to ask you out in person than there is not a reason to date him anyways!

But calling you annoyingg and not answering your textss after he like asked you outtt, that means he liked you then and not anymore, which is plain stupidd. Thats what i hate about some guys that say they like a girl and then just get over them just like thatt... but anyways, if he keeps on ignoring you and stuff dont give in to him, dont go out with him, you can forgive him i guess and be friends with him but hes not worth the pain if you guys go out and hes gonna start ignoring you and stuff too...|`|aIX2Ak8iaa	honestly i would try 2 forget this Kevin because if you guys dnt talk anymore than what do u truly have 2gether. Also he kinda well really does sound like a jerk for saying ur annoying, if he truly did think that than why did he ask you out and risk hurting your feelings. In my opinion i wouldn't give him another chance. Id ignore him and see what happens, if he doesn't even notice or care id say move on, if it really bothers him id wonder why does it now bother you and do you really care...hope i helped|`|w7dRjrV8aa	( guy ) ok he is just an idiot without any balls. he is too afraid or has a self steem low enough that he wont ask you. if you like the weak, vulnerable guys, by all means go ahead. but in my opinion if he waits around that long its either because he is obvsessive or because he tried another girl and that didn't work out because he was probably a wimp and by then he went back to you. so he is either a stalker with no balls or your the second choise of a guy with no balls. take your pic :)
Y1npBMS0aa	well i do that with guys mostly cleanliness. but i usually like them for their personalities. and plus YOU cant help it but just know that i think there will be a flaw in each girl you like so they cant be perfect but they can be close or "your" perfect. i hope i made sense :)|`|rocqOck1aa	I think it is normal but I wouldn't judge them so much by their looks or clothes and go by their personality and their friends. Oh and their cleanliness because if she's not clean then...well..obviously... I think that it's good that you have high standards because that means that you won't just go out with anyone and that's very rare in today's society.<br>  <br>  hope that helps!|`|sr8HF6q0aa	well you also have to look at them by who they are you shouldnt judge them but remember if you get a girl that is really pretty but totally stupid and never gets a job you might regret it or she might even be the rudest person in town so you can look at a girl by er looks but you have to remember the most important thing her heart<br>  (and yes that sounds as lame as it is)<br>  Hope this helps|`|Zqby1cXpaa	all of that is okay to judge a girl on, you are attracted on looks ( the smile, cleanliness etc.) an if you like her its cause of her personality an if you like her personality most likely her friends are the same as her|`|heiROzm4aa	heck no. if you got it flaunt it. haha. im  the same way. they are representing you afterall, if you go out with them. you cant be seen as the guy who went out with a girl who only wears dark jeans! jaja.|`|LSCG8aGVaa	thats like totally normal. but when you do that.. you may over look some of the good ting and miss out on someone that would really be a good person for you.|`|ODcciLi3aa	1.u can't spell!<br>  2.ur kinda a snot if u judge a girl by what she looks like<br>  3.yeah it's normal FOR A GUY!|`|PLsJpPqOaa	i mean you can and a lot of people do, but you might miss out on a great girl..... :)|`|nOezzy5caa	ya too high of standards for a girl, ones you have than are good is looks maybe, and personality their friends are their friends for a reason she connects with them|`|27ylepZLaa	Never judge a girl by the people around her, nor by the wrappings.<br>  <br>  From my own experience you should throw those standards out of the window.|`|Hk39AkNGaa	I dunno know about "Judging then about looks" <---Not really nescessary, thats pretty high standards.|`|4ftOPCoQaa	yes you can but as long as you juge them on  personalty youll be fine|`|Tx9Izeraaa	no plz help me <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlvCA_S_pVMDPLohVL2MqsXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219181000AAbltfm">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|7lsUrjccaa	why do u care wat she looks like? it should be wat her personality is like and if u get along really well|`|xlY7a2U1aa	its alright|`|bZA3TntMaa	that sounds fine|`|qPTEmrMpaa	personally i think its fine to do that but while your worrying about all the stuff on the out side you might not see the girl whos perfect on  the inside. but yes a lot of guys have high standard depending on what they think about them self. but do what makes you happy dont be with the hottest girl in school if she has the worst personality and is a ***** just trust yourself|`|PqvUfenZaa	i dont think you should judge a girl on what clothes she wears as in liek brands names .. as you know the economy isnt going that well and if your expecting her to have like 50$ brand name shirts while she could have a shirt that looks exactly the same from like forever 21 or so for like 10$ thats stupid. either way it doesnt have an effect on who she is.<br>  <br>  but if you mean it as like the way her clothes are like cut wise (extremely short skirts, extreme v cut shirts) i guess. <br>  <br>  cleanliness- makes sense. <br>  looks- theres more to a girl then looks youu knoww. b ut i get what you mean<br>  personality- that means everything .. well at least to me it does<br>  <br>  sharing my opinion .. <br>  hope i helped you|`|OLlPPJFqaa	DUDE......be pICKY......sometimes the biggest mistake people make are lowering their standards....but to be honest, sometimes igf your standards are too high (ex- clothes, looks) IT realllllllllyyyyyy does cancel out a lot of potentially nice and serious girls...no doubt...but standards are standards and preferences are preferences :) Good Luck!|`|FOUCV6Cmaa	You have to be attracted to a girl.  I don't think you are too high standard, you know what you want.  Remember though no one is perfect.  Sometimes the gal with the looks and the right clothes is the one with the rotten personality.  Just follow your heart!|`|FsozOO6Zaa	I can see why you think like this. Looks shouldn't be a huge one, but obviously it counts for something. People say friends reflect who you are...but that's not always the case. Some of my friends get in trouble a lot and do drugs - but I am the total opposite. But some of my other friends are just like me... If you see this girl with a specific group of people you "dont" like, see if she has OTHER friends that you think reflect more of who she is (like the case with me and my friends). Clothes aren't that big of a deal, sometimes people can't afford much but cleanliness should be a big deal. Just because a girl doesn't "Dress up" and think she's 20 every single day at school doesn't mean she doesn't care about how she looks.|`|ff545BLyaa	Okay with me...  but judgeing a girl on cothing thats kinda lame....|`|eVK2zZsOaa	You can base your decision on what kind of female you deal with on whatever you want. If you feel like you need to make sure she looks good and has a nice smile then that is your preference and it is perfectly ok do that. Base your standards on whatever you feel is going to bring you the perfect mate. Just be careful.....setting your standards too high can lead to some unwanted results. Sometimes we can seek out a mate that is too perfect and it can lead to a long and lonely love life. Don't have a list of like 100 requirements because you will not find a woman who is going to meet all of your standards.|`|Fw78upNjaa	It's perfectly normal to judge a person. Our whole society is judgement based. Every single person has likes and dislikes. When looking at a new person our first impression can actually tell us if a relationship will bloom from there. <br>  <br>  I totally have high standards. You have to be clean, funny, and intelligent or have some great quality that attracts me. However, at the same time give people a chance, you know? <br>  <br>  There's more beyond looks and definitely more beyond the surface. You'd be surprised how many people can fit you "standard mold" if you give them a chance.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped :)|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	yeah girls judge guys using similar standards|`|AeV8KYL2aa	i bet they judge you just as harshly.. good luck on your endless cycle of torture and unhappiness|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	you look like youre looking for what every other man is... however, when you grow up and mature, youll find out that this perfection is impossible to achieve, and youll learn to overlook her "faults". <br>  <br>  or youll spend eternity alone, cuz NO girl is perfect. if she seems like it, she probably has the biggest problems.|`|FDW159pEaa	well if you judge a girl and you found out she  might be pissed i mean people judgeevery one i've done it and it is mean but if you don't tell anyone its fine <br>  also if you like a girl talk to her because she might look weird and stuff bt she could be like the awsomest person ever|`|GqL8VD9aaa	clothing? if ur talking about if they dress nice, it's ok.

aBv4zph1aa	It appears to be a very good price for fresh flowers, however, it depends on how the arrangements will look too.  If you're satisfied with what your floral designer is going to create for you, sounds like a very good price for all of this.  <br>  <br>  Also find out if this $1500.00 includes delivery and set up.  Make sure everything is in writing:<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  Time of delivery for bridal party flowers <br>  (you'll need to know for picture taking)<br>  Time that set up of flowers will be completed at the reception.<br>  <br>  Also, as an FYI, check out COSTCO on line.  They have very reasonable prices (cause they have direct sources) for wedding flowers and very nice too.  So that's another source for you to compare prices.<br>  <br>  Hope these few tips helps you out.<br>  <br>  RESPONSE:<br>  $1,500.00 is a very good price for eveything that you're getting (including delivery and set up).   It appears that your friend/florist has a vision, so run with it....sounds very nice and roses look very rich too!|`|ECe1rgsdaa	you didn't give us the price...|`|xoIc4C6Eaa	Are the flowers real or silk? <br>  <br>  To give you something to gage from, I'm having my bouquet in red and white roses, 3 each of bridesmaids and grooms men, 4 fathers, 4 coursages, 2 extra boutioneres, flower girls basket with petals. No other "decoration" type. And it's $205. All arragements are silk. Real flowers are actually about $150 more. But you should look around. That seems a little high.|`|VlzlPAEwaa	I went through this just five months ago...My tally would have been 2$2300.00 So I went to my local grocery store and bought so many roses, and different flowers,,,It all cost mt $400.00.<br>   Just look up how to make the things you need, and make them... They were beautiful ararrangements you could always go to local floral department, and find out how to make them...save money honey...|`|AhKaLuO3aa	That is an amazingly low price for all that's included in your package!! If you've seen their work, like it, and it's everything you could dream of...then I say to jump on this deal :)|`|8c7cc680a9dfdc46cf7a06e1622558bbaa	I can see you easily spending $2000 on all of that! But that is just a "guestimation" coming from the research I have been doing lately.<br>  <br>  If you have the money, I'd say go for it. However you could always just get real flowers for the bridal party and then use silk arrangements for the decorations. That alone will save you a lot of $.<br>  <br>  ----------<br>  updated to say: <br>  <br>  $1500 is not much off from what I said, so I think that is actually a good price. Bridal bouquets alone usually cost $100-200 a piece. Boutioneers and corsages are generally $13-20/each. I'd say bridesmaid bouquets shouldn't cost as much as your bridal bouquet but could still be up there in price ($50-100/ea.)<br>  <br>   The most money I think you will be spending is on the centerpieces and other miscellanous arrangements. That is why I would probably just do silk flowers for the decorations instead of real. If you did that you could probably get away with only spending $700-800 which is half the price.|`|ALQFHnHTaa	Shop at different florists and get different prices. You can also tell them you are on a budget and see what they can make for less. Adding more greens and fewer flowers will take a big chunk out of the bill.<br>  <br>  There are so many variables that it is impossible to tell you what a good price would be. It all depends on how many flowers are being used and what they are being put into. For example:  are there going to be flowers on the aisle bows? Are the aisle bows going to be two colors?<br>  <br>  When you get a price for something ask what it is going to contain. You can always substitute one rose and lots of greens, baby breath and ribbon in a hand held design instead of a bouquet holder. That would be lots cheaper.  Get magical and use mirrors and voltives on the tables with the flowers. That will make them look much larger and be less expensive.|`|xkGfxn70aa	You have a very reasonable quote. Actually a little low, you have got to consider though what style and if your using all fresh flowers.  Sounds wonderful.  Good luck!|`|UUQXNhMtaa	we can't say without a price!

I think that last answer was very inapropriate. Sometimes when people get diagnosed with mental disorders it can be very scary. I am a psychology major and when people are uneducated they assume the worst. My boyfriend started going to therapy and taking seroquel, pristic, and one other for his bipolar and depression. I could tell a major difference in him within a week. He is going great and feels great. Our relationship has never been better. Always talk about things with your spouse and be there to support them.|`|jVx7pmCgaa	My partner had ADD and that was hard enough to live with. I think with differences like this comes good and bad, however more then likely the bad out runs the good 5 times over. <br>  Like they are actually very loyal, energetic and loving but major mood swings, aggression and irritating habits are also a factor. All in all i ended up feeling like the parent and totally exhausted from giving him so much energy and realised he already has a mother and that i deserve to be in a more equal, compatible relationship.  <br>  Good Luck|`|7DoR1QKuaa	...no, but WOW!  That must be hard.  Well, I use to think that I was bipolar, but then I realized that I just needed more sleep.|`|DYUfnPzhaa	Hey-  I read your answers and you should really ask this question in the Mental Health section.

XeYGLWEnaa	mira, ya vi que alguien te conto la historia de su padre!, como espa?ol que eres te sugiero que cuando lo agas lleges con humildad a u.s.a. y te alies mucho tiempo a nosotros los mexicanos, pienso eso porque te pueden ellos arropar en lo que aprendes todo sobre u.s.a. lo bueno y lo malo. despues te podras independizar de los mexicanos pero ya estando vien informado y sabiendo como es la vida diaria,<br>  <br>  yo ahorita me regrese a mexico pero estoy por irme de nuevo(aunque ilegalmente, y tus caracteristicas son iguales a las mias en educacion y todo lo demas)
71b5d9acd0e084b723a6c805c9cfd85daa	Give it to your mutal friend and let it go.|`|4POGapREaa	Don't make yourself look stupid.  Send her a text saying "I have a piece of mail for you that seems to be important.  Please text back with your forwarding address or to make arrangements to pick it up.  Thanks."  Be done with it.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	Return it to sender and let them deal with it.|`|hvcjyEmDaa	give it to your friend to deliver to her, or just cross out your address, put on her new address, and send it to her.<br>  <br>  It's time to let go.|`|j8aCEtg8aa	Set it on fire and pretend you never saw it.|`|hNSZlSMPaa	Be the bigger person and get it to her. Later on you will feel better as a person and then let her go and move on in your life.  She has made it plain that is what she wants and you are only hurting yourself.  Been there and I really wanted him back but it was not going to happen. Down the road I met a better man who was wonderful to me and my kids and I was glad I did not get their father back.|`|qAR26vRFaa	Give it to the mutual friend.
MROjF6ahaa	Ok so the thing is............<br>  <br>  THEY NEED A LIFE<br>  <br>  and they think this girl is soooo cool and they think they are nothing compared to her..<br>  <br>  lack of self confidence..<br>  <br>  DONT DO IT!<br>  <br>  its better to be your self<br>  ditch them?<br>  <br>  IDK its up 2 you|`|ZfAiUNvHaa	Oh my god I've gone through this over and over and over. And now I am too. I've found you've got to be yourself, don't mope about them stalking her. Be fun, happy, a good friend and supportive and they'll see just how awesome you are.|`|AdFucadgaa	I don't think they consider you as friend. Friendship is a two way process, a give and take relationship. Open for suggestions, corrections and sometimes cruelly reactions. <br>  <br>  Anyway, you can find one who can be your true friend. If they refuse to accept your friendship then go on with your life, if they wanted you be their friend they'll know where to contact you. Why waste your time with someone who does not  value you. True friends are hard to find they say. Just stay friendly, you'll find one surely.|`|a62788d28fb7418ac54ec8f66d13c9cbaa	Sounds like you feel left out. I wouldn't sweat this little problem. I know this sounds odd but, it always one friend out of the group no body likes and they just want to kiss this girls behind for some reason trust me girl they will get tired of it soon. I would just chill out and be yourself don't kiss this girls behind. all those girls following her are probably being fake. One day when your friends are not hanging out with this other girl just invite them to hang out or go out shopping for the day so you can get to know them.|`|tFKQYT6Naa	ughh tell me aboutt it i have soo been there !<br>  well wen i was in that same sittuation i was getting really annoyed and aggrivated cuz i felt like nobody was listenin to me or wat i had to say.... so the only way i got them to listenin to me was just not talking to them and then they realized what they were doing nd they said sorry and then we had like a big talk and stuff.... so maybe just talking about your problems with eachother will hepl you out..<br>  hope i helped ! = D|`|o80aAQV2aa	Awww, poor thing. This is just like middle school. Here is their problem: These girls have deluded themselves into thinking that this girl is somehow better than you, which I highly doubt, but that's what they think. You might have to leave these girls and find a new friend who listens to and cares about you. Just be yourself and don't let meanies like that get to you!|`|b2j5AE1oaa	my advice is if they wanna follow her around let them but when they lose you as a friend then they'll be like why didn't we listen|`|FfMv8pipaa	I say find some new friends.<br>  Don't follow in with a crowd of people who only follow one girl for no apparent reason.<br>  They probably do that to get on her good side because she has something they want. In the end, she'll probably lose them all, and when you're not there to crawl back to, they won't know what to do.<br>  In my very best opinion, I'd have to say they aren't that good of friends. <br>  But if you want to keep them, I'd say have a talk with them all. Find out why, and if they are real rude and snotty, I'd say give up. <br>  I'm sure lots of people would be willing to be friends with you, don't set your limit to this one group of girls.|`|6mJJrVUlaa	Oh I definitely know how you feel i've been through this before just last year.  What I did was talked to my other friends about how i didn't like how everyone was acting.  They listened and we agreed that this kid was so not even worth the trouble.  Just be yourself and keep doing what you're doing now.  Don't follow this girl around or you'll just become a clone of her.  People will respect you more for being who you are.  Besides, people in school think that you are fake if you try really hard to be like someone else.  Good luck! :D|`|nEZunptyaa	Well it is probably cause all the girls look up to that other girl. Is she pretty? Smart? Charming? whatever the case is it is cause the other girls like her as a idle. And yes this does happen to guys too. But its ok hopefully the girls will get tired of that other girl and start liking you both equally. If they dont they are not your true friends.|`|1jtMIrUiaa	I personally have experienced this.. and its not worth it. for one is boring! to do what they want to do all the time, and one if they only care about the one person, why should you even bother hanging around ? go find some friends who arent obsessed with one person. trust me, when your not following the other group around anymore they'll miss you.|`|M7NFiBBBaa	I had friends like that. One of my friends always follows this other girl ( who is really mean) around and acts like her little puppy. Now she doesn't talk to me anymore. I don't think they deserve a friend like you if they treat you that way, like you are nothing compared to the other girl.|`|LYdHLw7naa	Well kiwioat7... If you follow her you will get hurt in the end, it's only a matter of time and she'll make you look foolish in all your friends eyes. Remember she has to stay on top of it all, I feel sorry for people that can't stand on their own. Be brave.|`|qJXSTtTfaa	wow. It's just not in the movies.  I would find a set of new friends that acutally care.|`|vfBpeb7Maa	i hate when friends do that. tell them to think for themselves and that you don't think it's cool that they're being followers and tell them you kind of feel left out. if they don't care then they probably aren't worth your time and you should find better friends. good luck. (:|`|Cl4lYfnCaa	Honey, If that's the case then get new friends. If they're not interested in you, and more attention to her, I suggest you either tell them how you feel or stop hanging around with them.|`|lZLZqtaBaa	that has happened to me before. if you are close to your friends then if i was you i would confront them. Just tell them what you feel like in a nice way so that they dont get mad at you.
1YdeUn1Caa	There is alot of legal tape you have to go through. You don't qualify just yet. You are too young. <br>  <a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/publications/emancipated.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.publiccounsel.org/publication...</a><br>  Everything you want to know is there.|`|GR2XNzCCaa	I believe when you call child services, they will talk to you and you will possibly get a public lawyer. But then you will either be put into a foster home or have to sign emancipation (divorcing from your parents) papers. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Quit fighting with your parents and do what they tell you to do.They are the adults and until you are able to go to work and support yourself you NEED them!If you call cps you'll be put in some foster home or juvenile detention place.|`|Sm44fi0jaa	call child services or go to therapy with your parents. ive had this problem too and i resolved it by sitting down and talking too them
MROjF6ahaa	Well find what one is god at and the other isnt?<br>  <br>  life isnt one big competition<br>  <br>  you have to have fun with it while you can!!<br>  <br>  OK<br>  <br>  Good luck XD|`|ei0Wryytaa	umm...<br>  talk about something else|`|uhKBBQ9raa	you two are too similar!<br>  hah, that's why you guys compete and there's no way to fix that until someone or both stop making all a competition.<br>  the power of "will" haha<br>  enjoy yourselves, cause competition may be taking the best of your friendship.<br>  good luck :P|`|RXQDvhexaa	a little competition is a good thing. its when you cant let the other person win that it gets bad. if you swallow your pride in one situation so the other person can take his/her glory they should do the same for you latter. its always nice to win but it can be equally satisfying to see a friend succeed.|`|DI92bGw2aa	is ok, I had a similar experience.that situation don′t means that you are sick, I propouse  when you compete again the winner have to do something good for the looser gay, like what, let me think....<br>  something symbolic,,,,|`|3pzTBC7Caa	dont compete
tG1vTi0Daa	Just leave her alone for awhile. She sounds like a b i t ch to me. She doesnt treat you right, she doesnt respect you, and she sure doesnt care about your feelings. Who knows whats going on in her crazy head. In the mean time, dont worry about it. Just be happy single, look at the good things in your life and dont take all that for granted, because things could be a lot worse. Dont let a girl talk you down and ruin your faith in yourself, or keep you from doing what you want to do. I think she is just as confused as you are... she clearly doesnt know what she wants anymore, thats why shes hot and cold. Dont fall for her being nice right now, you know shes just doing that because she wants to control you and feel good about it. For real though, leave her alone for a while, or for a very long time. Keep doing what youre doing.|`|qxLgA93Iaa	Your doing the right thing buddy. I'm proud of you for standing up to her like that. Really. Girls or guys...that's hard to do.<br>  And, she is trying to suck you back in. Hopefully this time, it won't work.|`|92c01a76c33fc6972e01b32f7ee92058aa	You are doing the right thing.  Start looking for a job elsewhere.  Try to arrange it so that you do not have classes with her at school but if you do, only act civilized.  Provide no encouragement for dates and do not agree to any invitations.  Tell her that it is over, that you guys never really got along and you think it better if each of you started over with someone new.  If she should find a new boyfriend, no matter how big a jerk he might be, remember that he is a better choice than you for her.  And say that.  You are the worst possible choice for her because she will destroy you with her constant criticism.  You do not need a girl friend who brings up things you did when you were barely into high school.  Sheesh.|`|3CXfqxcgaa	Once some one uses you and puts you down it is time to go. Could you be married to that crap for 50 years. Run as fast as you can. Find some one that adores you and excepts who you are and you excepts who she is.
y3eY9x0kaa	Dear FRIEND,<br>  Hey, sorry I have been busy lately, it took me awhile to reply to this e-mail, I wanted to tell you a few things, first off, I really appreaciate your friendship and you have been one of my best friends that I have had in a long time, the only thing that is affecting me is the fact that your getting upset, I hate to know that your sad because you think I'm blowing you off, because I'm not, I have a lot going on in the past few weeks, and even weeks to come, any time that I feel that we can hangout, I will let you know, I'm sorry your upset and mad, but I am a very busy person and being my best friend I wanted you to know that even if we don't hangout all the time, we are still best friends, maybe soon we can get a bunch of people together for a movie or something! well I will call you as soon as I have time.! <br>  -your best friend, (yourname)|`|WPipgT9vaa	I don't think it's fair to her that you are pretending to like her when it's clear you hate guts. Stop stringing her along and just tell her you don't want to be friends.

a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Personally I don't care for strapless. However, I would say #1 would be more flattering on most body types and the ruffle on the second dress is a bit out of place.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	yeah I vote for #1.  no one's gonna wear that dress again with the ruffle at the bottom.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I like this one:<br>  <a href="http://s547.photobucket.com/albums/hh475/mysunshine417/?action=view&current=90215468c83c300e4797c17814d927a5_m.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s547.photobucket.com/albums/hh475...</a><br>  <br>  I think the bottom of the dress kind of mimics yours... It's cute and fun.|`|Axtitdo8aa	Number 2 - it has the same shape as your dress so it will be flattering.  The other one is much too short and looks like a cocktail dress.|`|qrd27oqsaa	Definately #2, it's so classic and perfect. Easy to wear again. Beautiful gown by the way.|`|0Id85yiYaa	1|`|hkwBR1moaa	I don't like either.|`|4459a617a0f5dd8c54421a39f39f8ed4aa	The shape on the second is not flattering at all. We don't all have the perfect hourglass shape, so that won't look good on all your BM's.<br>  <br>  Go with the first one. The detail at the waist is lovely, even if you change it to a thicker ribbon.|`|FnskUYpqaa	I like #2 better though for some reason it's fitting the model on this picture kind of weird. I've seen a similar dress in person and actually it's the one my bridesmaids are wearing.|`|1KfbgBupaa	Dress #1 doesn't have a flattering top so go for dress #2.  It also has a flare at the bottom that will go well with your dress.|`|sGP6s7uraa	I like the second one better because it compliments your gown by mimicking the same shape.|`|q8eue7CRaa	The 2nd one is less flattering - go for the 1st! Anyone should be able to pull it off.|`|6UmRmaeWaa	1 for sure!<br>  <br>  My niece calls your dress the mermaid dress ha ha how cute!|`|IHNll9Yjaa	first one....it's nice, its a more softer blue...the softer the better, AND it won't take away the distraction from you|`|T2QieSzPaa	I don't care for any of these gowns...sorry...are those really your only choices?|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	They are both great dresses, but i like #1 better, especially with the bow in back. #2 looks a little 80's with the ruffle.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	I like the first one It's prettier overall and the second one mimics your dress too much.

AA11380378	He needs to be a REGISTERED and LICENSED officiant in your state in order for the marriage to be legal.<br>  <br>  You need to apply for a marriage license on your town's hall in advance and after the cermony is performed,  the officiant needs to sign the license and write down his officiant license number in your state. <br>  <br>  Remember that religion and State are two diferent things. Another option is for your to get married at the court house and later perform a religious ceremony with your friend officiating the service.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I think you should ask HIM. He would probably know. I don't see why NOT, really, retired pastors and priests sometimes come and "fill in" at my church...If they can do that why not a ceremony for you?<br>  <br>  My wedding was performed by my former pastor. The senior pastor of my church became the bishop, so I thought :at least I don't have to choose which one of them to perform our wedding". so I asked the associate pastor, and she was thrilled to do it, but a month or so later I was informed that she was leaving the church in a few weeks- she was going to become the bishop's assistant! And appearantly neither position is allowed to perform weddings. She did tell me though that since I had asked before the announcement that she would still do it, it just could not be in a church. So we got married at a park instead.|`|6utUL9Hiaa	I don't see why he wouldn't be able to perform a "justice of the peace" role for you- definately ask him...that sounds like a really nice idea!
II4Po8CZaa	1. no if they dont like you sometimes they will say something like that but not likely<br>  2. ask if she would like to talk or sit by her at lunch and ask her if she would like to date when she is allowed to<br>  3. she might mean that her parents are very protective and they might not want her to date so just hang out with her if she feels ok with it and maybe she will get to like you trust me ive got experience with rejections and i have alot of friends who happen to be girls and ive asked the same thing and they said that they mean it when they say stuff like that.|`|oE1eCjRtaa	i know it doesnt answer your last two questions but have you considered that maybe her mum/dad wont let her date untill she turns 16? <br>  A lot of parents are like that. if i were you i would try and become more friendly wtih her so that when she does turn 16 and if you ask her out again, she might say yes.|`|ubbKS6BBaa	SHe could respect her parents and they've told her to please wait until you're 16. <br>  <br>  Or she could have said that because she doesn't like you. <br>  <br>  Try when she's 16? Or move on to the next contestant.|`|JXeppqfHaa	I think that she might be telling the truth, but it is had to tell for sure unless you know her personally. This would be how i would let someone down easily. If you really like her and you want to know the truth, then the next time you see her confront her in a nice way though, if she likes you she should say. She might not mean anything else. You might be over thinking this one=) us girls aren't that complicated. Just be youself and trust yourself and you should do fine.
fc37688f48f44a71f9de0ad8f18a0eaaaa	Well if he really likes u then he will break up with his girfriend for u. here are 2 options<br>  1. move on to some one else<br>  2. keep on flirting and well whatever else u do and just wait and see if he breaks up with his girlffriend and if he doesnt than he either is a  stupid manwhore who is nooot worth it trust me, or if he does break up with his girlfriend then well he probably rly does like you and will ask u out|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Don't make a move until him & his girlfriend is over.|`|5uzHW4CYaa	Back off until they're no longer together or make him choose. It sounds bad either way, but I've been through it too.|`|tWePoJYNaa	Well, I'd talk to him about it. You can't start something with him while he's still with his girlfriend. I'm not saying that you'd even consider that a possibility, but there are too many cheaters in the world, and you don't want to help create another. He's likely considering ending it anyways. Tell him you have feelings for him and that you know he feels the same way (if you're positive) but you can't do anything about it unless he's single. If he's really committed to his girlfriend he'll tell you, and then you should just stay away from him if he's too tempting. Good luck! These situations suck.|`|zdQGden1aa	There's nothing that you can do, he's the one who has to actually "do" something and that's break up with his current gf.

Just go slowly.|`|YhdHZ6kkaa	tell him what you posted up and he would tell you what to do|`|vp4xjqbLaa	Take it easy don't rush into anything,remember that this guy still hasn't made his intentions clear so until he does officially say hey lets go out sometime just go with the flow enjoy the ride but be honest with him if it does come to the point where he wants more and you decide you don't...you never know he may just wait until your ready and appreciate your honesty.<br>  Personally i think there is no time limit to how long you should wait for your next relationship...if it feels right the person makes you happy and your genuinely interested in them and its not just to fill a void then live life and  dont delay happiness.|`|sN1FjEOeaa	i say goo for it because this chance may not be around when you are finally ready(this guy liking you).. and if you were only talking to this guy in january and yall werent goin out then noo need to wait, since its not going to happen jus think about what are you waiting for?? maybe you were waiting on a nother guy coming into your life and he has ,he jus came sooner than you thought he would..|`|vwvTldkoaa	maybe you should tell this guy you need a little more time.<br>  tell him your interested but you need a little while.<br>  if he really likes you, he'll give you the time you need.|`|9uIjRBVMaa	If you want my opinion, I think you should go for it.<br>  You might regret it later if you don't.<br>  Plus, if things get serious you will forget all about that other guy.|`|6kAtYLAdaa	take your time.  if hes a really sweet guy he wont mind waiting and you dont wanna lead him on....|`|9bDsqAYIaa	go for it<br>  date the guy<br>  it will get ur mind off of the other guy and it will make u happy|`|x1FzJLwZaa	then be friends for the meantime|`|9zevjO8Laa	y don't u tell him that!! so i think u r a really great guy but im not sure if i want a relationship right now!!|`|xijwHZrWaa	Tell him exactly what you just told the world & I think he'll understand.|`|ssFCk115aa	Go for it because if you dont respond to him in a little bit he will start thinking that your not intrested him and move on soo go for it
Vx5DoFUAaa	i was dating this guy at the time,<br>  and i had been talking to another guy.. not like that tho.<br>  <br>  my boyfriend and i drifted apart, so<br>  i just started talking to this other guy EVERY NIGHT.<br>  i didnt wanna end it with my boyfriend but this other guy wanted<br>  to date me, & he told me he'd wait forever (:<br>  so one night, me and him were hanging out at the movies<br>  and at the end of the movie was a preview that said<br>  'kylie marie, will you marry me?'<br>  his friend worked there,<br>  and was able to add it in.<br>  <br>  :D<br>  so, i ended it with my boyfriend,<br>  and started dating brandon.<br>  <br>  that was a year and 8 months ago,<br>  and were still together.<br>  oh, & im 6 weeks pregnant!<br>  :)|`|CBa9G4j4aa	The guy came to school with roses and a plain white shirt on. On the front it said "Royelle will you go out with me?" and on the back it had check boxes that said "yes", "no", or "maybe". It was super cute! I had to put a check mark in the box I wanted with marker!|`|SG4WDeKNaa	Well my girlfriend has always told me that she liked how I did it, so here is the story: We had met online through a stupid dating thing on Facebook and started talking all the time, she was so nervous about having to "break the ice" when we met each other. So I told her even before she showed up that as soon as I saw her I was going to kiss her, and that should be a pretty good ice breaker. So when she arrived at my house (and you can bet I was nervous as hell) I kissed her. We spent the rest of the night together and as it started to approach the time that she had to go home (she still lived at home, she was 18 so it was nothing illegal). I started joking around, while holding her, that I really liked this girl and that I thought she was way to out of my league and that I didn't know if I should even ask her. She knew I was talking about her, it was quite obvious. So I asked her out and we have been together for about 2 1/2 months now and have spent every moment together. We are even talking about taking things to the next step/ I know it seems soon, but she is in the Navy, so it is kind of one of those either go all in or forget about it situations. That's my story anyway. I hope you liked it.

We are on Lake Michigan or the ocean and we are going for a walk and he leads me down to the end of the pier or up to a light house, which ever, and then he spins me around and kneels down and pulls out the ring he (and his dad(please do Not ask!!) ) picked out, and asks me if I love him and then if I will marry him.<br>  <br>  <br>  Thank you for ignoring my identity.|`|g02pr7hpaa	Um, thats tough :)<br>  I'll think about it and come back...|`|vYxqAASbaa	on your anniversary, first he makes you breakfast in bed. Then he tells you to wear something, comfortable but fancy. Then takes you to the places where "first things happen" (example: first kiss, first met) and have a picnic. then goes to a fancy restuaraunt. He tells you what he thinks love is and how "your it baby". then pops the question.
O2jX3lpQaa	wat kind of game is it? i like scrabble|`|xBd96wvRaa	Maybe she did not get your message. And ask yourself did your message ask for a reply? Did you ask a question in your message? <br>  <br>  Send another message asking how she is or bolder if she would like to grab a cup of coffee. <br>  <br>  If she doesn't reply - next time you see her ask if she got your message if she says yes, there is your answer. Which is No she in not interested.|`|7Hs8TE5haa	yea you defiantly should make a move on her. From all the staring, id say she wants you to. but you should have made a move sooner and that's probably why she didn't respond to your facebook messages. but next time you see her, strike up a conversation and maybe ask for her number so you guys can text or talk on the phone. if she gives it to you then you should ask her to hang out sometime and see where it goes from there.|`|2EIvAsZ6aa	sure|`|67115b1163cc8b9c69bf180fdf940ed7aa	Well, it really does seem like she's into u <br>  u should make a move.. flirt with her.. Look at her and smile when u catch her looking at u wink or something..<br>  try asking her out one day for lunch or something after class.<br>  I think she didn't answer ur mail coz she's shy and scared your not into her coz u never talk to her.. so she doesn't know what to say..<br>  ASK her for her number too and text her and stuff :)<br>  let her know ur interested  <br>  <br>  Good luck with her ;)|`|qxs0VPXmaa	make a move if you see her again, she definitely likes you, and don't ignore again, just act normal!!!! just act like yourself!! she is just a person that you happen to like and she likes you!!!|`|0QOAKWeCaa	Yes make a move, she seems to like you a lot.

I don't think it could really get anymore direct unless she ask you out. But girls don't do that. Its the guys job. So yeah shes done alot to get your attention to come her way. I think now its your turn if you really like her.|`|eDfh1yhYaa	I think she really really really likes you,.these days technology can let you down, maybe she didn't even get your message? A lot of stuff often ends up lost in cyberspace. I think you should go for it and ask her out and quickly i think she's waited long enough :)|`|hKss8M9Raa	She sounds like a stalker, but, OBVIOUSLY, she likes you, or liked you. She probably thinks you don't like her/think she's crazy/are avioding her by the the way you say you reacted to her. It may not be too late to win her though. I would save this question to show her. She'll be flattered that you remembered so many details!

Nothing I hate more than a girl who tries to act or be like someone else. You need to have enthusiasm. Be up for anything. If he wants to play a video game and you think that's crap, do it anyway. Guys love it when you will do something they love or are passionate about.  Also, have confidence in yourself and what you do. Whenever you're around a guy you like or whatever, do what you do with pride. Last, have a sense of humor. You need to be able to laugh at yourself at times and you need to be happy with things.|`|YlOembScaa	Be yourself....<br>  **dont where a bunch of make up--you'll just be a fake... guys might think your "hot" but thats not going to necassarly going to make them want to go out with you... they just may be desprate...<br>  **Be nice-- <br>  **if you have a certain guy in mind... flirt with him a little... give him some compliments... <br>  ?good luck!|`|whR6j9JIaa	So, go out more and meet people.|`|FnDU2fhxaa	your 14.<br>  wait until your older.<br>  for now have fun and forget about guys|`|54qBK15laa	I am a 13-year-old kid.  Guys try to not act sensative around women even though they r.  They like physical relationships and they like to talk a lot when they get nervous.  U need to make them feel relaxed and don't wait for him to make the first move.  Guys r shy around girls they like and if u can realize which ones r shy around u u will know who likes u.  Then ask that dude out.  I wonder how i should act around girls because i alwaya wait for them to make the first move.  U NEED TO MAKE THE FIRST MOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Guys r usually to shy to make the first move even though they try to act cool around u.
i7ZArzliaa	To be honest, personally, I wouldn't accept the idea that "he's too busy for three days straight"... unless it is an extreme case where he came down with something and had to go to the hospital... or he had a family emergency... <br>  <br>  If a guy is truly interested in a girl, he would find any chance he had to call or at least text her.  Three days of MIA means either he's afraid and confused of your guys' current relationship and/or unsure about the future... or that you were too slow and he's into someone else.<br>  <br>  "What do I do?"<br>  Calling him may just scare him more and/or push him further away because it puts him in the spot light to talk to you directly... which may (or may not) create an uncomfortable silence.  To me, calling him would seem like you're desperate.<br>  <br>  I think texting him wouldn't hurt... just a simple "Hey, how are you, blahblah~ we haven't chatted for a couple of days and I was wondering if you'd like to do something together when you got some time off"... something like that.  Why ask to do something together?  It shows that you're interested in him and at the same time, he must reply (unless in an extreme case as above).<br>  <br>  If he says "Sure, let's have coffee on Saturday!"... you score!<br>  <br>  If he says "Well, I have to work all this week, but next Friday I'm free"... you still scored, but also at which point during the so-called *date*, you can ask him about his feelings.<br>  <br>  If he says "Ah well, sorry, but I'm busy all week, maybe next time! *smiley face*"... sorry to say, but when there is a 'next time', you're most likely going to get the same answer.  Either he's really not interested in you or that he's not putting much effort into seeing you, in which case, he's not worth your time and energy anyway...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck!<br>  <br>  Offnote to all original posters: It would be much appreciated if you chose a Best Answer to your question when you feel you've gotten it... even if it is not mine... many people spend a lot of time honestly researching and answering questions for you, and sadly, most of them never even receive a simple "Thanks". A few seconds of your time to click a button is but a nice gesture.

There is no rule that you talk daily. Call him up and make light conversation and see what you get from that.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	I wouldn't worry about it, he probably had stuff to do. Just because he doesn't talk to you for a few days doesn't mean he isn't into you.

Are you sure he's available?  Does he work, go to school, play in a band?  Get where I'm heading?  There are countless reasons why he either can't or isn't able to communicate with you.  Next time you talk, simply ask him where's he's been.  You were concerned.....that sort of thing.|`|xJ0tDHSiaa	I'm a guy, he's just either really busy, or being a bastard and being a sexy man to you, and getting under your skin and reeling you in like a fish, and your the fish in the fish tank.

He may want to be your friend and not a boyfriend. Or he is just busy. Don't bug him, just text him one hi and say what is up. Leave it at that until he contacts you.|`|ee7335f3bdae606bbfe534bef63fe2e0aa	Maybe something came up.  Send him an email or text letting him know that you are there if he needs to talk and leave it at that.  DO NOT push him.|`|S852p6SXaa	well like you said, maybe hes busy.  give him a couple more days if he doesn't respond then just forget him.|`|FHrQzaPqaa	find out what the problem is before you go to the next step.|`|qRKOWgS0aa	Yes, I know. This sounds cliché, but REALLY; be yourself. If you aren't yourself when getting to know a guy, and you end up going out with him, is it really fair to you that he likes you for who you're not? If that's confusing, just think of how long you're going to have to keep up the act. <br>  Get a new look! It can be as dramatic or subtle as you want; dye your hair pink (this may not attract some groups of guys), or get side bangs or layers, but dont get so caught up on looks. If he's a good person, he'll barely notice. The possibilities are endless, and this is sure to get your guys' attention! <br>  Ask your friends for advice; there is a good chance that some of them have had boyfriends. If not, think about if you have the TIME to have one, and if you are ready. <br>  Don't rush it. Guys are just as shy as girls, and when you reach up to kiss him on the first date, he might be happy, but he also might be a bit nervous and scared. Work your way up the ladder: Hugging', 'Holding hands', First kiss, 'Cuddling', French kissing and making out... you finish the rest. Just make sure that when you reach the end of the ladder, you go back to the basics every once in a while. It gets a bit tiring at the top, over and over again. <br>  Have fun! Relationships aren't supposed to be about stress and being 'tied down'. If you feel this way, consider taking a break from boys!
NVg06Egwaa	Before the tongue gets involved...NO! But when the tongues get in and everything...YES! So IMo YES! If you're getting to the point of making out aka french kissing and it lasts longer than like 15 seconds..I call it french kissing AKA Making Out.|`|KA2BdkM3aa	ummmmm yes. what exactly do you think making out is? Sure you could add in some other bases before you make it a home run but you've pulled off a solid line drive.|`|ildgJVJoaa	duh! french kissing is practically a synonym for making out. more than 10 second is making out in my opinion.|`|PFm1dI55aa	Uhm, maybe?

I would totally fall for it... <br>  <br>  ~good luck~|`|AA12107793	I wish you a lot of luck, however, it is not always easy to begin again with someone that all ready knows all your faults. Both of you need to work out any past issues and/or problems.|`|06b9c84774f56925d1e58878d307859aaa	hope it works out for ya|`|Rih79dHNaa	well did you break up with her or did she break with you ???<br>  if she broke up with u i would try but do not count on it|`|a1iam8Zvaa	yeahhh<br>  i would, i'm a sucker for guys with a nice voice lol<br>  unless i'm with another guy =/<br>  but try it =]|`|qSSiV0mmaa	Your plan sounds good, however I am more concerned with your comment that "without her I'm not whole".  You should not depend on someone else to make you happy or whole. You should work on your self esteem rather then worry about getting her back.|`|DET61tGPaa	It doesn't work bud, tried. Me and My ex broke up for the same exact reasons, and i had actually wrote her a song while we were together, well jsut the lyrics, then after we broke up i wrote the guitar part for it and played it for her, and she started to cry and i felt like **** for making her cry, i didn't mean to my intentions were jsut to show how much i cared.<br>  <br>  It might work for you cuz it's a different girl and they all act diferent, but don't count on it working, that way too, if it does work it will feel even better|`|37dJAd1baa	Sorry, no. I'd be impressed that you decided to learn my favorite song, but I don't think it would make me fall back in love with you.<br>  Instead of playing your guitar for 3 weeks, you could have called her, emailed her, sent her flowers, sent her a hand-written note via snail mail, dropped by her office, or a million other cute little things to grab her attention.<br>  <br>  You guys need to start talking!|`|AA12398373	After two years, she would need a lot more from you than a song played on a guitar.|`|Vx9Lvt9Aaa	dont put the love all out there...........that will force the love on her.........................just talk to her.....make her laugh .........go out.....and the love will come back.....save the guitar for the grand slammmmmmm!!!...|`|4LZNeVLTaa	omg! that is the sweetest thing a guy can ever do! it really just depends on why you guys broke up in he first place, and if shes dating a guy right now, then talk to her about it and dont tell her detail about how you want her back just ask her stuff like are you happy?<br>  if she is just tell her thats all you could ever ask for. and really that is the sweetest thing a guy can ever do! that proves your a man! <br>  shes a lucky girl, sucks that she lost you. or the other way aorunD?<br>  well good luck sir. lol<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  o and if you can your a guy so answer the question i asked idk how to find it htough. lol its about an abusive boyfriend i think hes abusive. help me. please......|`|2s9IZU7xaa	it realy depends on why you broke up and if the same thing that got imbetween you guys before will get inbetween again and it also depends on if your hot and if you can sing but i dont think I would get back with a guy who did that I would be like no thanx <br>  anyway hope I helped|`|4ka3Avvcaa	Thats so romantic<br>  i would well because i'm the romantic type<br>  but it really depends on how your ex is....<br>  But again thats the most romantic thing ever...<br>  She would be lucky to take you back!!|`|A9JV4uAxaa	Idk man, i always thought that only worked in the movies, do you know how she feels about you right now?|`|J30Gh5O6aa	awww i would get back with you if you said all that and did all that =] so sweet.|`|8DYwsHlPaa	why did you guys break<br>  up and if you did that idk<br>  maybe|`|IC9ajqCjaa	That's sweet :) And yeah!|`|BtR8zpySaa	u got that fron guess who?<br>  anyway you should try but find out if shes moved on
4ce5b454fceaa5c7da06ac84b31319f6aa	No he won't, he'll probably be amazed by your confidence. Just walk over and start chatting to him to see what he's actually like to talk to. If he seems decent then start talking to him a little every time your in class and if you see him outside of class give him a wave and a hi or something. If that's going well, you could probably ask him out to the cinema.<br>  Good luck!|`|MySNBiDRaa	that would do good. Just be casual and keep calm. If hes really nice as you said he is. It should work<br>  <br>  you can also try commenting about the context. like the cardio club. Say isnt it nice to finally have a cardio club or something, to strike up a conversation.<br>  <br>  good luck !!|`|gKhR0sgLaa	A big mistake most people make when it comes to wanting somebody, is thinking that talking to a person of the opposite sex automatically means you like them. A lot of guys would think, she is just being polite. How do you think all friendships start? With casual conversations.|`|oKgjv4ODaa	well do something to get his attention like if he is lifting after school accidently drop something by him n if he picks it up be like thx n introduce ur self n have a short conversation then the next time u see him strike up another conversation|`|vjfdhhSDaa	If he thinks your weird so be it at least you've broken the ice.|`|PIIqTgwuaa	Ask him how does he like farts<br>  then fart rly loud<br>  works for me every time|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...do it you're beautiful and it won't be a bother...<br>  ...besides both of you could talk about fitness, health and the cardio club...<br>  ...and ask for recommendations or advice...|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	you said it's in your school...you didn't mention if it's high school or college<br>  i find things get a lot easier in college<br>  high school still has so much drama ;)<br>  <br>  i would wait until the second or third time you see him and just strike up a conversation<br>  just talk about the fitness room, that you just found out about this cardio club, has he gone there before, what does he think etc<br>  <br>  i would gauge his responses to let you know if he's into the conversation or not|`|c3DqvgE4aa	everything works out in this world <br>  and the strangest it is the more original u are<br>  just dont waste time in anything u do or time will fly away<br>  "if u wanted to do something and u did it u must never regret in life"<br>  my motto|`|lOGHxtoUaa	life would be so much easier for guys if girls came up to them. i hate that guys normally ask out girls it is awful.<br>  talk to him first it helps us guys out a little.<br>  so no not weird.|`|t9T35AkCaa	get to know him, like sometimes just say hi out of no where, he'll say hi too then eventually you guys will say more than hi :o|`|KcAehrrKaa	Go up and talk, that shows interest.
Y9djVW1Naa	Less than an hour is fine so your should be ok.<br>  I wouldn't travel more than 2 hours in one direction unless I was staying ovenight.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	My wedding was in Texas, and lots of people flew in from CA and VA.  My wedding site was about 45 minutes away from where my family lived.  So I don't think that's too long of a drive at all!  Something that helped was that the night before my family stayed in a cute little hotel near the wedding site.  IT was a fun last evening plus we didn't have to worry about the long drive.|`|76nTvO4iaa	It sounds fine to me.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	21 minutes is fine.  There will be about an hour between ceremony and reception anyways (for pictures).<br>  Total driving time is fine. I drove 2 hours to a wedding once.  If it's family, and they love you they'll show.<br>  I don't see a single problem with your plan.|`|aipChC3haa	Nope, that's OK, as long as the bridal party doesn't have to go through that because they will get hot and stuffy and the makeup will get f'd up.<br>  But yeah that's totally OK!|`|jPJ9MTCwaa	I think sounds just fine.  Most of the weddings I go to, surprisingly, required about a 45 drive between the church and reception then back home again so I say not too far at all.|`|8ad580cd99c0cf921506c236e4e80b8faa	When the souls joined together, distance is not a problem
AIftgLEGaa	I believe your boyfriend thinks you measure up to him. If he didn't he wouldn't be going out with you.|`|a1iam8Zvaa	dont let it get to your relationship<br>  i had a bf who was really really cute<br>  and i was so insecure about myself<br>  and he use ot always be like<br>  your pretty dont worry about it<br>  but i was just too unconfident lol<br>  and it ate away from my relationship lol<br>  so dont let it get to you<br>  just be happy =]|`|3y0w1qIBaa	It's not a competition.  The most important thing is the happiness between your boyfriend and you.|`|Wf8PbTraaa	just keep being yourself he obviously likes you or he wouldn't be with you.<br>  <br>  if you go around changing up cuz you feel like hes better than you than he might not like you anymore....he likes you for you and so should you.|`|0qjAT3yVaa	SO??? does any famous person spouse feel the same?? it is not what instrument you play,maybe your talent is love,understanding,listening,honestly,pr... at the moment you have 6 to his 5 .........so he is short now.....LOL.....BE YOURSELF THAT IS WHAT HE WANTS|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	my god! i just recently felt the same way about me an my bf. i dont really know wat to do so im gona talk to him about it when i get the chance maybe u should to?|`|T8O8xVb6aa	You don't need to measure up to him. He loves you for who you are (unless he's purposely making you feel this way) and you shouldn't feel need to get "on his level". <br>  <br>  good luck|`|8pWFsDSHaa	Well my girlfriend is a million times more beautiful than me.... It is just nice to know what she likes in me, like being a nice guy, or funny, or a friend.|`|5db88cbaf3527eb6e504255901eb58cfaa	He obviously thinks you "measure up".  Your boyfriend likes you for yourself - not what you can do.  Stop worrying - be happy.
7bb17ba0d239bccce9d108823363a0f2aa	Well at the risk of being boring and following the crowd - of course you look hot !<br>  Though I sense a deeper issue here - from this and previous questions maybe you are having crisis of confidence? Or maybe just not appreciated?<br>  Have faith - you look great and obviously have men at your feet!|`|GSqaUAFYaa	m a girl but i think HOT..<br>  <br>  u hav the hipsand everything<br>  <br>  i think u should do something with ur hair...chocolate brown or something|`|f1c1c8dafe8cc85d8807ccbdff4a484baa	Hmmmmm...Body & face are gorgeous, but need to investigate further.  What's your number??? ;)|`|R4qiyprfaa	id think you were|`|zHJufZTcaa	I think you are really hot.. Beautiful smile... nice bod..|`|d6cbd4f49a6660cc733a0b7ea8151199aa	Why are you asking us? You are married and from what I can tell, you have at least 1 maybe 2 kids. <br>  <br>  I think you are a M!LF!|`|AA11108018	Tell me this a joke on your part   Please tell me why you think your not hot.  From the top of your head to the toes on your feet you great  I did see one default one of the Tye's on your top is frayed    LOLOLOLOL Just kidding
48HKDSR0aa	If you like him and if you feel confortable with him being your boyfriend, I think it may be worth trying.<br>  <br>  He's seen you through your breakups and know what to expect if you two broke up right?<br>  <br>  talk to him about it and tell him that you would like to remain close even if something happens|`|VgiUGqxtaa	Trust me STAY FRIENDS!!!!!!<br>  <br>  ive seen the "good friends become great lovers" Bs crumble right b4 my eyes..<br>  <br>  Its happened to me..Trust me, stick to the friendship..<br>  <br>  But if you're feeling brave, give it a try..|`|c3MFIbeUaa	I believe you should first place the value on the relationship of friend first and foremost.<br>   What bad can happen is not that you guys break up as bf/gf but as friends. IF he is indeed the close friend that you say he is then you must first as a couple way the cost of breaking up for reasons.<br>   Couples break up all the time for various reasons of incompatibility but rarely do they break up as friends or else you would never have been a friend in the first place.<br>   Unless there is reason to believe that something will come up to break the bond of trust so bad as to kill the friendship then yes, go ahead and become a couple.<br>   IT is the bond of friendship that you should protect first as you are still young yet. Do not sacrifice this close friendship if you see a need to ever be with others.<br>   I suggest you take this step from friendship to couple with fore thought and attention as it can be a great thing. It Can also be the most definitely the worst experience of your life.<br>   Take care. GOD BLESS!<br>   Cheers, huggs, hopes and prayers.|`|tO8ey3o8aa	Give it a try, try not to start a relationship with thinking what's gonna happen when you break up. Sure it might not last forever, but let's not focus on that.
FPsU6HOXaa	she wants to be with you, &maybe shes expecting you to tell her WHY you're still with her.<br>  its nice to hear.|`|M85hL2eCaa	tell her yes and if it gets annoying tell her something like this...<br>  "ok, we ARE still going out! and i will tell you if i dont want to go out anymore ok?" and that should stop the problem she will be kinda shocked....but maby she is asking this bcuz maby u dont ack like u to are going out. like u dont pay enuf attention to her...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope that helps...|`|kzIVGEfgaa	If it's constantly, she is probably insecure about it. It may also be a jealous thing too if you are hugging other girls or talking to them. <br>  <br>  She shouldn't be jealous of you hugging them if you are but if she is, talk to her about it|`|BBNhU5cwaa	she wants to know|`|z5Hl6Bhtaa	She's just making sure your with her :]|`|oCaf3238aa	shes just making sure
Ucoj40DXaa	Not all girls are like that.  Some are more talkative and involved, some are shy, others respect people's bubbles and are more laid back.  Mabye the aggressive, out going girls aren't for you... Why don't you try looking for girls of the latter types?  Look for someone who has an agreeable pace as you, who would respect your personal space.<br>  <br>  Also, be yourself and don't act accordingly to those girls.  If you don't be yourself, you'll have more trouble later on cause if you fake, girls won't like you for who you really are and you'll have a hard time showing them who you really are.<br>  <br>  And remember, there is definately someone out there for you, who will love you for the kind of person you truly are, so be patient :)|`|XMXgeJPFaa	You SOB you better love that attention i don't get ANY.  You gota play it cool and not worry about it.  It might even be worse though because the more you act like an ****** the more the girls might like you haha.  Have fun with it.|`|zoptablFaa	For help with all your dating needs check out <a href="http://datingwebsitesonlineportal.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://datingwebsitesonlineportal.blogsp...</a>
WjVsIqbPaa	well i cant say for sure, but he sounds like he would be controlling and abusive. my best advice would be get out... and fast.
a0S75L1faa	doesnt matter your age your parents cant control what you feel. so do what your want live with out regrets its your life..just make smart decisions and think twice before you make any.|`|AA10466027	Yes.  She doesn't want you to get into a situation you can't handle.  Your whole future can be ruined by making a mistake now.  And the proof that you are too young to date is that you told her a lie.  Adults don't lie.  They accept responsibility for their actions.  P. S.  Your parents are your best friends because they love you.  Give them some respect.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	Number one - you are NOT supposed to be on here until your are really 13.<br>  <br>  Number two - It IS fair because you are already lying to her and she know that you are just stupid enough at your age to wind up prego and then she will have to support you AND your baby.
5WkptD9yaa	FLIRT!!!!<br>  duh!
eDP3YU5Laa	Youll like a guy you like them.<br>  Your not going to force your self<br>  not to like them. It just happens :)|`|mYjtC4Graa	ninth grade.|`|VgiUGqxtaa	16...<br>  <br>  that should be the age...<br>  <br>  i h8 when youngsters say they "love thier bf/gf, when they've barely gone through puberty.|`|2drqM7u8aa	there is no certain age that you can start to like someone. when you like someone, you like them.|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	I didn't have a girlfriend until high school, so I'm gonna say high school.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	16+ cause younger is just too young
7yBHL4x5aa	well u cant force ur feelings so he has to understand it and maybe as time passes den maybe u gonna get to luv him so as for now just go with it
ZjM0ghSnaa	I agree with you. I think is completely unfair when a person is called a hater for not doing anything, when those other girls are the real haters.<br>  The best thing to do is not let them get to you. Your the one is isnt like them, and that's great. Hopefully one day they'll understand the real meaning of a hater, and they'll stop calling you, along with other people that.|`|MU453gLqaa	I think people spend entirely too much time trying to figure out what others are thinking.  Say for example my 13 year old is walking in the mall with her friend and they see another girl walking with her friend. They do not know them.Well the other two girls are talking and laughing and my daughter and her friend assume the conversation is about them. Now these girls become haters when maybe they weren't even thinking anything about my daughter and her friend to begin with. And if they know the person and do not like them then it is worse.  I say find something else to worry about.|`|wnr9S9kuaa	I don't think that anyone's jealous and I'm not jealous of anyone either.  As long as you know the truth then everything's alright.  They're the ones who don't know the truth.|`|a1iam8Zvaa	i would kick their ***<br>  hehe =]
y4zYkceEaa	Seems to me he's playing with your heart. Are you in a offical relationship with this guy? He's probably avoiding you. By all means no one should make you feel this way. If you really love him give it another try. If nothing changed, move on. He's doesn't have a heart to even call you back! You deserve better than this guy. Kick him to the curb. He's a boy, you need a gentlemen! Good luck! ;))<br>  <br>  edit: Wtf? He has no balls to step up to the plate & call you back. You deserve better. I'm sorry you feel this way. He's a jerk. If you get to talk to him in person, slap him for me. lol|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Mine always did. they like to be the chaser sit back and let him do the work and see what happens|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Well, you may want to give this guy some space.  Try not to do in 24/7 or you're going to scare him away.|`|IHNll9Yjaa	yes...he got what he wanted.....I also found with my bf, that if I was too nice to him, he would take advantage of me....so I stopped giving him money for gas, "doing it" with him, telling him how much I loved him, didn't call as much, and he's coming around.....when you get TOO NICE....they will take advantage of you because they know you'll do anything for them when you're desparate....you shouldn't be buying him gifts......what did he give to you?|`|AA12400627	Try harder not to be clingy and needy! You are scaring him....trust me...you're being too lovey dovey and it's making him uncomfortable! <br>  <br>  Stop being too nice and buying him so much stuff! You give him too much, you will be taken advantage of! It's a law of nature....happens everytime! <br>  <br>  Wait...give it time and let him get in touch with you this time!|`|G9mIO5rvaa	hm<br>  sometimes it's the guys fault and not the girls, although maybe you scared his off with the whole "i love you" business. Just give his some space, back off a little, maybe date some other guys..<br>  who knows? he might just realize how much he really likes you!|`|WQhV4Amgaa	houston, you slept with him! h that's all he wants is sex. he's a man-whore like edge or those people on the gta games. just slap some sense into him and get an std checkup|`|japDHRaPaa	sometimes guys make you think that he likes you a lot more than he actually does, just to get in your pants. ha, yes , they do sometimes just take girls and throw them away, its pathetic and sad but very true. just let him be for now, and wait for him to come to you. if he doesnt, then he is not even worth it and dont waste your time trying to get him back.|`|TBZK5q78aa	I think this is his way of stating "I'm no-longer interested in you." In essence move on with your life dear. There are many men in this world dear. Take from a guy like me; This is a tactful way of rejecting you... Sorry but it's true... He's not too interested in you. If he claims he is, then he is just in it for games which also something you do not need.<br>  <br>  God bless!|`|AI2VoFP4aa	uh yea!. did you really not know that when you had sex. and let me clarify that you did not make love you had sex. he obviously got what he wanted and now hes done with you. maybe you should have thought twice about sleeping with him. some guys are like that and the more you think theyre going to call the more often they dont. choose better next time.|`|8pWFsDSHaa	Sadly = ( Boys are just jerks, insensitive jerks.... You need a Man, im sorry for you.|`|lW3ZddDFaa	maybe you scared him away OR he is just a jerk......<br>  either way u are the good person....    :)

e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	To flirt with a guy without anyone else knowing, you would need to get somewhere alone with him.  Other wise anyone around will see and hear you flirt.
JhvqUvlsaa	I don't think you should tell him while he's fighting with your BF; wait until that cools off. And if he continues to give you attention and you are liking it then MAYBE it would be okay but let him think about it for a while when you tell him. See how he responds.

Being in the middle of her relationship with him is a serious danger to your life.<br>  <br>  But you don't want to hear that, so here's the only thing that could work.<br>  <br>  Get a job, a car, and save up some $.  When you've got a couple thousand, offer to run off with her and get married.  It's every girl's dream.  Hardly any girl would be able to resist it.  Be warned though, she's just as likely to cheat on you with him as she is to be cheating on him with you.  She has a psychological addiction to him that is stronger than any drug and you just may not be able to force withdrawal under any circumstances.|`|FsXTyGH9aa	yea keep it up..if he treats her bad and you treat her good she will eventually come round.|`|r7yaD6Axaa	U should give up <br>  <br>  <br>  i mean i know that u love her but she's been with his bf for so long and his bf even hurt her but she never give up loving him or maybe <br>  <br>  <br>  if ur really meant together u will be together <br>  <br>  but u see wen love hurt u have to fine new love <br>  <br>  <br>  and ur so busy thinking of her how about you she doesn't seem serious <br>  <br>  but this is just an advise urs is more important than anyone <br>  <br>  follow ur heart and mind but think <br>  <br>  think of a decision that u will never regret<br>  <br>  love has a lot of hurts,fight, and sacrifise<br>  <br>  that's how it works
4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	I don't give my lady friends topless massages. I don't think they'd let me do that anyway, but if they did and I was taken, I would feel weird about it.<br>  <br>  Your whole social circle sounds f*cked up to me. Your boyfriend is trying to hit it w/ your friends. Your friend falls for this. You and bf, well, ex-bf, have a mutual friend Eric, and yet Eric tells you that the guy cheated. Wouldn't a friend to both of you decline to even get involved b/c it's really not fair. I mean, I guess you broke it off anyway. <br>  <br>  But if you were so upset about this that you ended a six month relationship over it, then I think it's mean of you to keep teasing him about it. Let him move on. If you're trying to be friends, then isn't it bad enough that this incident destroyed your relationship?? Let it go and now that you're just friends he can give topless massages to whoever the heck he wants and you don't have to care. Do you want this one mistake to ruin your friendship and your romance with this guy?? Or is it that you're trying to prove your point that he was in the wrong. Well, I'm w/ you, he was out of line. But what exactly are you asking this for? If 25 people came on here and told that you overreacted, would you go back and give him another chance?? You had a problem w/ it and since it was your relationship, you're the one who matters. And it's not like he was exactly sensitive or understanding toward the fact that you took exception to the whole thing.|`|7fdeTRhPaa	If he's your ex-boyfriend why does it matter?|`|HZgjUguWaa	yeah right nothing happened & if u buy that there's some swamp land near Phoenix 4 sale|`|uLHtXibRaa	Its totally out of order..If he loved you thats a very strange way of proving it?|`|K4Fnbvjuaa	Definatly not ok....he is living in another world if he thinks that is ok. If he is in a relationship the only person he SHOULD be giving a topless massage to ,is his girlfriend. Now what a person SHOULD do and what they think is OK to do varies by each person....you just have to find the person that is on the same page as you.<br>  <br>  But most likely he just doesn't want to admit he did something crapy, because then he would feel guilty...and most immature guys don't want to think about how their actions hurt people...so they deny the truth.|`|9XjtEdEqaa	NO. would he like it if you went up with one of his friends and they showed you their penis. i dont think he would like that. he cheated on you so good job for breaking up with him.|`|zmgfafalaa	No. Not at all! If my bf did that, i'd break up with him.

Not a cool thing|`|y7JML5UYaa	oh honey he gave her more than a massage..|`|3EJUvTT3aa	No its not okay, obviously, that's like cheating.<br>  He's your ex now anyway, its in the past so just forget it.|`|48HKDSR0aa	not cool.<br>  <br>  congrats on him being your ex-bf now|`|Molu004zaa	Hell to the NO. She's not a friend and he's not a boyfriend - both are complete losers and I can't BELIEVE you still associate with either of them.

3UMZzQCbaa	Wow Faith Hate is a very big word to say for someone you are with? if thats the way you feel then Why would you be there, is it that bad that you have gotten to a point that you Hate that person, Please think about this and pray about it for its a sad time for you to feel hate. <br>  <br>  i would talk with him about it or her about it, tell them that your upset and that your feeling alittle angry and see if that helps you guys and if your unconfortable talking in person write it all down, and explain how you feel let him or her know that you are upset and that you wish to  not feel this way any longer:)<br>  <br>  hope this helps <br>  <br>  angel|`|wp5TjXT4aa	You need to care for yourself first. If that person does not make you happy, leave them. It sounds like you are staying because you don't want to hurt them but they don't care enough about you to let you go be happy with someone else. Is this person possesive?<br>  Do what makes YOU happy. If you spend your life trying to make others happy all the time, you will never be happy yourself!|`|sBM1P2h2aa	it depends on how you care for him. if you broke up would it just be caring for him as a friend or do you think you would miss him?

3UMZzQCbaa	What has he done to make you feel this way, This is not a good thing at all to feel this way, it is sad that your at this point . have you spoken to him about this and tell him how you feel, can you talk to him about this ? is he a person that will listen and not get upset.? is this a problem is so, you have to think if you wish to be with that any longer, and if it is healthy and its not easy at all i am sorry that your going threw this, i hope it all works out ><br>  <br>  god bless angel|`|TXaAsy4Kaa	you need to move on. it seems like you need to move on and the way you sound it seems like he treats you bad. sorry its just what i see|`|0eorp2Hhaa	cuz he probably follows everywhere u go and cant get any privacy, it can be also teasing u too much and being immature around u or his friends : \

ArJcyHdtaa	See dear Mr.Broken, why do you wanna go after some one whos not fit for you. Why do you wanna waste your precious tears for some one like that.<br>  <br>  It could be that she just thought as a friend and she dated another guy becoz she must hav been interested in him in other way. Theres no fault wid her. She treats you as a friend. <br>  <br>  See watever the case. Speak to her tel her wat you have expressed here..if you cud see her eyes wet when you express yourself..then shes into you atleast as a friend who cares otherwise ..kick out and move on man...wy spent time crying...<br>  <br>  i believe the one who deserves your tears will never let you cry. GOTCHA?<br>  <br>  <br>  Now jus go have fun!|`|htWw0OlCaa	Sometimes girls cant read the emotions that a guy puts out. Why do you think that girls and guys are always asking questions about the opposite sex? It depends on how you are displaying your emotions for a girl to pick up on them, we are not mind readers, we can't always tell that something is wrong. Im sure once you told her to get lost that she knew something was wrong then. Did she ask you what was wrong? If she didn't then Im so sure she walked away very confused. I think you need to talk to this girl and make her understand what she does to you. She may not know that you feel this way about her. Talk to her.... Seriously. Best wishes|`|CHF7VtElaa	i think you need to at least get it off your chest. tell her how you feel but you can't expect her to say the same. i say that you have nothing to lose. you can't get over someone until you've fallen into someone else. good luck.|`|fNnZqzZNaa	oh boy stuff like this happens to every dude! Trust me, it feels like you'll NEVER get over it, but the truth is, YOU WILL. It takes TIME, and stay busy because when your bored, you think about her and it makes it worse. Try going days without thinking about her dude and in no time you'll find a way better chick!  please believe me on this one man.|`|RKfqVRhTaa	Dude, I know how you feel. I went through this, and I still am. I know it hurts like hell and it feels like if you will never get over it. I really miss her and still cry at night. There's a horrible pain in my chest when I think about her. Its been 5 months. Just try to ignore the pain and look for another girl. Another option is, if she doesn't like the average asshole, a.k.a. the popular, stupid, reckless guys that every stupid girl likes, your lucky. Be sweet. Tell her she's beautiful and write about her. Make her feel special. You can win her over with your words. However, if she does like the average asshole, then you deserve better and none of this will work. I can tell your a really nice guy. Good luck.|`|jwBF0IoKaa	I made this account just so I could respond tot his...<br>  <br>  It takes time.. i was in the exact same situation yourself and I am still in it.. I met the girl about a year and a half ago and after about 6 months I finnaly decided to make a move.. she pretty much murdered my heart to the point I was ready to kill myself. The depresing thing is im still very close friends with her and see her a lot each day. I know she likes me more then just a friend but her excuse was she wasint ready for a relationship. The best thing I could recommend doing is.. if you can just get out. Coming from personal experience its not worth a year of pain just because she cant love you the same way you do to her. Music usually  weakens the pain for me so you could try that. <br>  =/ Im sorry I cant offer better advice but it really just takes time. Confrontation can help also but It ended up being a disaster for me..
rO56gv3Faa	extensions would look great!<br>  <br>  you could put in in like ringlet curls, it would be soo cute!
2qbLrHBKaa	So easy, just be nice but honest. Say, I am not into ladyboys as far as romantic relationships go but I'm sure you will make someone very happy one day. or You are not my type personally but I'm sure there are plenty of guys who would like to date you. Reject them but don't put them down. Or say, I really don't feel comfortable flirting with you when I know that I am not interested in you romantically. I do not mean to assume that you are coming on to me, I just want to be clear just in case so there is no confusion.|`|6R9McFZhaa	baby because is by internet why you don't tell that you find a girlfriend in your school or work and tell them some question about girls that you want to know

wW6NJk4jaa	I'm not sure...... the guy that is waiting might just be cautious because he's been hurt before, which would hurt him even worse if you went for the other guy, or he could be making up excuses not to be exclusive.... I guess just ask him what his intentions are , if he really wants to be with you eventually or if he's waiting around for a different reason?
XawBWMQraa	go with the guy who is ready now. The one you are waiting on may never be ready. if its meant to be, it will happen after. Go with your gut instinct
IT7ka3Ybaa	sex|`|HfZeQR4Aaa	It's not really anything that you can prepare for. You just know it. All the hand holding, kissing, hugging, etc. will just come naturally. No one will tell you how to do it. She will just make sense to you meaning it just feels right and romantic ideas will just flow freely. <br>  <br>  Falling in love is easy with the right woman. It's just staying in love. That's the hard part.|`|nig3OtZdaa	well you have to make a woman feel special and she'll give back in return(im not talking about sex)<br>  i've heard that when you're in love things like talking just comes easily, back rubs, kissing, hugging, just comes along as you go, too..<br>  <br>  good luck <br>  :)|`|7BZYUHpjaa	its just something that happens. you have to stick with one girl for a time and then one day you will realize that you love her and want to spend your life with her. you cant force it.|`|wnr9S9kuaa	When you fall in love, if you guys break up then you will feel very sad and depressed.|`|2n1PbzbRaa	penis+vagina=love,,, simple.|`|T8O8xVb6aa	sex is not the answer.<br>  falling in love is natural, you just have to meet the right person|`|Mr7sJyUMaa	sex her up|`|abwqrdtpaa	When you first see her, you'll just know. The way you find it hard to think straight when she's around, you'll feel protective of her and you'll care about her welfare. Love will never be true if you just make yourself fall in love with someone. It needs to be spontaneous and you should NEVER marry or fall in love just because someone looks good.

C8DOT8Y7aa	Always be a gentleman. Hold doors open for her, and just be polite and helpful. <br>  Know her favorite song and listen to her type of music, then share what you think about it. <br>  Learn to love what she does. <br>  Tell her that she's on your mind from the time you awaken 'til bedtime. <br>  Tell her you love her, but not too often. It loses its luster if you overuse it. <br>  Whenever you tell her that you love her, make sure you mean it. <br>  Make her happy by buying her gifts, but know what she likes beforehand. Jewelery is a great choice but don't be offended if she doesn't wear it all the time. <br>  If it's cold, ask her if she's cold, and have a jacket or a coat handy so you can give it to her. <br>  Go out somewhere and have some fun. Some good places to go are movies, restaurants, and other relaxing locations. <br>  Never ignore her and just walk off with your friends. It's rude to do that. If she does it to you, wait a minute for her to return to you, and if she doesn't, go talk to your friends. <br>  At the movies or when you're walking, hold her hand. Girls love that. <br>  Before you kiss her, take a breath mint. <br>  Move the relationship at a pace you're both comfortable with. If you don't match up, try to compromise. If that doesn't work out, politely find someone else. <br>  Make a good impression on her parents. Even if she doesn't like them, they can be your greatest allies in the long run. <br>  Become friends with her friends. It gives you more things in common with your girl. Eventually, her friends will love you, and that's a definite turn-on for your girlfriend. <br>  Walk her to classes if you go to the same school. When you walk her, carry her books, even if she isn't struggling. Some girls won't let you, though. If she denies a few times, let it go and don't push. <br>  When you listen to your iPod around her, share an ear with her. This way, you'll be closer because the cord is short and you'll have an excuse to hold her hand or put your arm around her. <br>  Don't be too shy. There are times and places that are appropriate to be shy, like kissing in public. Don't be too shy to put your arm around her or hold her hand, because you shouldn't be ashamed to have some public displays of affection. <br>  Kiss something other than her lips. Her hand, her forehead, her cheek. Anything like that will definitely put a smile on her face. <br>  If you know she has a good sense of humour, learn a new joke every day and tell it to her. If she appreciates a good-sensed joke, don't be afraid to share. Just make sure it is not offending to her.|`|a1iam8Zvaa	if you've been with her for like 3 years<br>  if she doesnt love you<br>  its a total waste<br>  say it loud and proud<br>  and if she doesnt like it<br>  she doesnt deserve it|`|jcTnOE8uaa	Tell her exactly what you said on yahoo.|`|fXedgFmIaa	just one day when u guys r hanging out. when ya'll r kissing or wat ever. pull back and say "can i tell u something" she'll say yea. than u just say it "i love you"|`|ijR3ygAJaa	"I love you" will generally do the trick ;) It doesn't have to be in some rose-covered hotel room or whatever xD Just say it from the heart!

PoYFQ7Mxaa	Uh...Yeah|`|OLnmXeWDaa	The FLDS and other non LDS sects do in fact consider themselves Mormon.

I saw this and I just had to say something.  You can't be "Mormon" AND FLDS IF (please note that word, "if") by "Mormon" you mean you are a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (which is the group people most commonly associate with that word).  LDS members do not practice polygamy.  PLEASE stop the continuation of this misconception about Mormons.  They aren't all out there practicing polygamy.<br>  <br>  And yes.  You should tell her.  If you are truly comfortable with your lifestyle, you should have no real problem discussing it with your lady friend.|`|JZkCVHJAaa	if you want to build a good trusting relationship with this woman you should be up front with her, if shes not into then your wasting your time if having more then one wife is what you want|`|BMQlzUkfaa	The FLDS are not part of the Mormon church.  They are not considered Mormons at all and in any way, so don't associate yourself with us because we don't like it nor do we accept what you are doing.<br>  <br>  Your answer is obvious if you are a Christian.  How could you not think of telling her?

I like a gentleman, caring, loving and a BIG sense of humor. Gosh, if he can laugh at me and in return I can laugh at him without him getting bent outta shape I'm head over heals already. Looks comes in first and last. You can have blonde hair and blue eyes and be a twin to Brad Pitt, just a soon as you disrespect her or think your Mr. high and mighty is when you turn ugly as a dogs behind. But looks of course turns heads first. But theres really no preference for me. The attraction is smile, conversation carrier and dont forget the cologne. If its faint and smells lovely. Dont go overboard to where everyone thinks you fell in the tank. Please anything dont be someone your not. And if I could have my own TV show for questions like these I'd stress all the little things you dont forget. Little things ex: forehead kisses, reach for her hand (and please a lot of guys make a mistake of just puttin it there and if she'd fall you'd have to pick her up) A flower, notice "A" flower it always doesn't have to be the dozen or more, the little things.

If you think positively you will attract more positive things back into your life.

All I can really tell you is that you need to get your mind off it. I suggest hanging out with your closest friends, watching non romance movies, and occasionally eat some chocolate and ice cream.

yTYEd6Ghaa	i think having the relationship you had with your dad set the grid for who you flirt and have relationships with other men. you crave attention from them so you start talking about a subject you know all guys will be interested (and teased) about...SEX! the good thing is that you are actually worried and aware about this "habit" of yours. you need to get to the root of why you do this to men. do you only do it when your fiance/boyfriend is around? if you are alone with other men you should act as if your bf/fiance is right there with you. i hope i helped! good luck to you!|`|Q27cXlGbaa	just stop hanging out with any other guys.|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	Stop hanging around other guys and pay more attention to your BF.|`|uFmrZbCbaa	Flirting with someone else when you are in a relationship, especially a long distance relationship is slutty ! grow up and stop hurting your so called boyfriend he apparently means nothing to you... rock solid ya right.|`|du5MNrQ6aa	stop being skanky and stop hanging out with guys, why not try to hang with your own man and flirt with him instead?|`|dpRrSCbmaa	go live with ur fionce, then u wont be so tempted to flirt with other guys.|`|cul82gntaa	call him more
jRa5ksWSaa	If it's just a lot and not exactly then go ahead. You need some differences though. I mean, you know yourself, if they are the same as yourself, you can't learn new things every day and that's what makes relationships truly great.|`|7sA8HwTzaa	Absolutely!  That's what we all are looking for in both romance and friendship.  The lack of such is what causes war.|`|9dvmMRX4aa	I guess but you know what they say, opposites attract|`|uLHtXibRaa	yes...is that vain?|`|9UQlhzitaa	yes because i would pretty much know what to expect and would have very little to worry about.<br>  <br>  found her once but she married my best friend and their still together after i think 15 years now|`|JcV2nn4jaa	Thats scary man, I wouldn't, but hey, thats only my opinion, whatever rock your boat partner|`|FIyiOCcUaa	.|`|gkiQPQauaa	.|`|Nig6z3Cnaa	i dont know. probably not because im ugly.|`|7e8a79679077253ba19f7c7646511819aa	Your question does not really make sense ?|`|yPKrBiIhaa	ya thats pretty cool plus u'll make a cute couple|`|zXpbfBcuaa	im not sure ill tell u wen i meet a girl like dat XD|`|VgiUGqxtaa	There might b a problem there..<br>  <br>  The both of you might have SO much in common that the relationship becomes boring & repetitive..<br>  <br>  But on the other hand, having alot in common with the opp. sex makes going in2 a relationship alot easier|`|b4CSFDU8aa	yes but only because im hot and im not a nerd and sweet so he could be hot and not a nerd and sweet|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Sure.|`|wYrS24e2aa	um why wouldnt anyone? for 1 avg guys first consider if they are attractive to them or not just by the first glance. They either say DAMN LOOK AT THEM TITTIES or they say yea...... time to turn the other way. Now if they think they're hot then they consider the other stuff like if they have the same interests personality etc. But me personally I dont really care how a girl is personality like AT FIRST. But eventually if she is really annoying you might stay with her just to boink her. But eventually someone else would come along that peeks your interest.
zMDkllJvaa	make him be gentle wanna know somthin nice guys are what you want if you want sex think about you you can turn the light off and hold each other till your comftorable and then just slip into it dont go get a one night stand thats whory for men and women trust him and know he cares abougt making it as comfortgable as possible its very diffrentg feelingg the first time|`|3KAiV9zTaa	i was shy about my body at first when getting naked in front of him when we were about to have sex. after i did get naked in front of him, instead of thinking of the worst, he actually thought that i had a great body. now its no big deal AT ALL! turns out he's actually shy about his body as well so its like yeah.i'm not afraid anymore, and whenever we have our sexual moments alone i don't feel self conscious anymore.<br>  then i also know i'm doing it with my boyfriend who i love so much, i'd do just because i love him (of course with protection)!|`|DErBSfZgaa	im super insecure of my boyfriend seeing me naked<br>  becuz there are so many things i don't like about myself. anyways<br>  whenever you decide to do it just wear a big loose t shirt<br>  and nothing else under. he'll understand. or turn the lights off<br>  and go under the covers i guess. don't stress it. that's what i do.|`|dpRrSCbmaa	if u really love the guy, and he really loves you, it wont be awkward for either of you to see each other nakedd|`|ixHwF4apaa	when we were born we were without dresses. ok let come to the question, wait till you get your husband, have comfortably and joyfully. when you both talk, walk together, you can feel he is yours and he can feel you are his. then where is question of shy. any mammal is given birth is for reproduction. for the social reasons we are wearing dresses and it does not matter on marriage and for mating. even if you feels shy, the switch off and have it. have a great future full of xxx and joy
AA10221073	Sometimes there's not much you can do<br>  Apologizing is always a good thing and you have truly mean it when you apologize to a person for whatever you have done to upset them<br>  <br>  After that it's up to them to accept it if not then do nothing but know that you did apologize<br>  <br>  The bad part is some people just rather be mad no matter how you say your sorry you are they just want to stay mad <br>  <br>  And that person is the one who has the problem not you<br>  <br>  So whom ever this person is you've apologized to and he/she still are mad then just forget it and let them stew in their own juice|`|VEEgoDkFaa	Give them time.

71302fffca270b78218f13d21ef605e6aa	the moment he sleep with his ex, even if nothing happened it was time to called a quit and have some self-respect. the fact that he still has contact with her and does stuff behind your back means that he stills wants to be with her but he is too much of a coward to brake up with you. plain and simple you should dump him and believe me around the corner there will be someone WAY better than him, someone with enough testicular fortitude to treat you right. let those to psychos be together otherwise you are gonna get drag even further and you are going to regret it.|`|AA11594366	if he talks to her behind your back he has other intensions. Maybe they like the risk and that attracts them to each other. She likes getting you pissed and it shows her that he would risk you to talk with her and she likes that. Blow their minds - invite her to dinner and show them t dosent bother you. They may lose interest if they see it dosent bother you, at least she will, she will be pissed if she thinks you dont care.|`|rZMC87EAaa	It's easy. Tell your boyfriend to stay away from her, or just tell HER to p*** off. I believe you can also get a restraining order against her for essentially threatening you on your voice mail.|`|707gOCvbaa	She won't go away because if he is still talking to her then he's giving her false hope she stands a chance of getting him back. You are getting the short end of the stick here. He lies repeatedly and has an issue with the ex? Honey you are caught up in a weird love triangle and she's not going anywhere. Your guy ahs no respect for you and if you hang around he will repeat his actions until he breaks your heart.|`|cqOOKv3Jaa	call the cops|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	honestly, this is just too bizarre<br>  if you say you love him i am sure you think you do<br>  but if he's sleeping with her and talking to her behind your back...then he clearly didn't choose you<br>  <br>  also if you break up with him if doesn't mean 'she wins' it means that you have moved on and they have to stay with each other<br>  don't think about her in this mess. take care of yourself|`|S852p6SXaa	okay first he sleeps with her on the vacation and secretly talks to her behind you back? they obviously still have something going on,  you should just end the relationship before you get hurt.|`|a5b774126a207d8d38e9c6854bb56b66aa	tell him to stop talkin to her or u will stop talkin to him cuz him still talkin to her just encourages her to keep doin what she is doin|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	Wow, you are definitely right. This is creepy and inappropriate. While maintaining a friendship with his ex would not be out of the question (I have maintained a question with one of my exes), they should NOT sleep in the same bed, let alone her being on family vacations and at parties if the relationship is really over. <br>  <br>  You mentioned that they had sex a couple of times, and that right there is part of the problem. Physical intimacy is often interpreted, especially by women, as the same as mental and emotional intimacy. This is one of many reasons to wait until marriage before having sex. When you have sex with someone, you simply have a harder time breaking up with them, even if you know they're wrong for you, and when the break up occurs, you end up having a more difficult time letting go of the relationship. <br>  <br>  The fact that his parents are okay with this show that THEY are probably not aware that his relationship with his ex is over, or  that you are the current girlfriend. <br>  <br>  The first thing you need to do is remind your boyfriend that he chose YOU, not her, and that he needs to cut out this behavior, or  that you will leave him. Then, when the behavior persists, you MUST follow through, or else he will believe that he can walk right over you and do whatever he wants and you won't do anything about it! <br>  <br>  You also need to make sure that his family knows who the girlfriend is, that this particular behavior bothers you, that it is inappropriate, and that you have made this particular ultimatum of your boyfriend. It will be very telling if they seem to take his ex's side over yours! <br>  <br>  To be perfectly honest, though, at this point, you'd save more face to just dump him flat. So she "wins." So what? At least you don't have to deal with the emotional rollercoaster. In the end, YOU actually have control over the situation, you can still hold your head up high, and you can find a guy that will actually be worth it.|`|WJHriZWjaa	This can't go on. Break up with him. If he really cared about you, he'd come back. Until he decides what he really wants, you shouldn't have to put up with his past relationship problems. He needs to figure out for himself that his ex doesn't like him anymore. Once he does, he'll probably want you back. Give him some time to sort things out. It seems like he's cheating on you.|`|I1MAeetZaa	well i would punch her in the face but thats just me. um talk to your bf and tell him to tell her to back off. if he doesnt that just means he loves the attention and the fact that he has 2 girls fighting for him  if that happens i would then break up with him.<br>  but thats just me  good luck though.<br>  <br>  <br>  oh i just read the last sentence. dump him seriously you dont want to be cheated on. theres better out there|`|FPsU6HOXaa	my friend sounds exactly like the lunatic your talking about.<br>  but shes friends with his sister.<br>  mayb you should try talking to him &tell him he needs to make a serious decision. if he wants to be with you, he`ll respect what your asking...otherwise it's his fault to. he should NOT be talking to her behind your back.|`|dTaGzh6Haa	Uh, I don't think the ex is the real problem here. I think your boyfriend is cheating on you with the ex and on the "ex" with you. Welcome to hell, my dear. <br>  You'd do well to let the lunatic have the lunatic. Run, Forrest, run!|`|ajgC0KPhaa	I really liked way your BF sounded, until the last sentence.<br>  <br>  Anyways, if she's really bothering you through so much personal sources (e-mail and phonecalls), then you should report her for harassment.<br>  If that doesn't work, then tell your BF to "tell her off".<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AinzwVQsVwT.H1baqD3FS9Xty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090212210557AAl3UEa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  .|`|t6N64bBYaa	ok not cool that he still talks to her. me personally, i would call the police and have then arrest her for harassment and stalking|`|x1FzJLwZaa	your bf needs to tell her to back off. i mean why cant he do anything about her calling you names ?? doesn't he has balls to stand up for you like seriously|`|BBNhU5cwaa	take her to jail
oUuDyzVmaa	ugh same here lol it SUCKS buuuut wat i do is if i know some hobby or interest of the other person, or even a shared interes, i talk about that which leads to other convos. dont think its awkward cos then ur brain will start believing it and it WILL make it happen....no jokes its proven fact. its all bout practice but if worse comes to worse, just tlk bout any random old thing...<br>  if there wern't listners in the world, then hoo would the talkers talk to?|`|f846739cc7909493f5273e70425c0163aa	It might sound stupid, but you can start back up a conversation with what time is it, and it doesn't matter what the situation is.
nPOS9d9Waa	Well..start talking to him and ask him what he likes..then just say do you have an AIM account and if he says yea why then just say something like oh just asking because i do and i was just wondering if i could have your screen name so i can add you and we can get to talk some more..yea just say something like that.<br>  <br>                        Hope i helped ya! :D|`|xXRmY2tCaa	just ask him, if you know each other im sure that there would be no reason why he wouldn't
8FbOtXAXaa	It might be hard to ask her out because you are shy and you really like her and you are a little afraid of rejection. Just think about what you want to say and take a deep breath and talk to her.|`|AA10330963	What! oh no, that is why i am single and am 26 yrs old! guys dont ask me out! ( yes I ask guys out, they say yes then run..they get real scared!) anywayz....<br>  <br>  you didnt mention if u knew she liked you. but, I am going to asume she does like you. ok.  so... WHATS THE PROBLEM?  oh yeh, you worry what people think. GET OVER IT!  people dont choose who will make you very happy or who you want to love! <br>  <br>  GO FOR IT!<br>  <br>  * work on , not worrying what people think and life would get so much easier! <br>  Are people breathing for you? nope I think not. so again whats the problem?  if you get nervous, its because you really like her  and thats ok!!! call her if you cant do it in person and write it down, she wont know it. ok.|`|qdQAQxg0aa	Just do it. Most girls actually think it's kinda cute if a guy seems nervous when asking them out, it shows that you actually care.<br>  <br>  Don't let your nerves convince you to do something stupid though, like asking her out over the internet, or having a friend do it for you. Those things seem juvenile, and usually result in an automatic "no."<br>  <br>  But as long as you work up the nerve and just ask, it's okay to be nervous. Just ask yourself, does the possibility of her saying yes outweigh the possibility of rejection? And if not, then obviously she's not the girl for you.|`|KiVfCReraa	life with out risk is boring. just ask her out. dont leave yourself with the 'what if..'|`|dywC7NTKaa	What people think is there thoughts Not yours, don't let other stop you if you really want her.|`|r4hJTqMAaa	just go for it.<br>  who cares what people will say and think?
WO68RZdIaa	It could just be those guys way of being nice & their way of complimenting you. (Or their way of flirting with you)<br>  <br>  I catch myself sometimes using "Sweetie" or "Sweetheart"- mostly when I'm dealing with waitresses, cashiers and other women that usually have jobs where they are on their feet for long hours & possibly having to deal with rude customers. In the manner I say it & with a genuine smile, it is usually taken as a compliment, in some cases the same as "Have a nice day" kind of comment. But occasionally I do get some sourpuss that snaps back "I'm NOT your Sweetie." But those are very far & few.|`|8DYwsHlPaa	yes and no cuz that could also be<br>  all they see you as <br>  but maybe thats how they say they like<br>  a girl.|`|DUWoxgbKaa	That's A Hard One A Guy Should Answer This One Lol.|`|4Uw1NhUpaa	i think you know the answer to that one.
FG9IPQasaa	I would probably ignore him for at least a day, and see if he would try at least a little harder to talk to you.<br>  Or just tell him your situation, and the position you stand in.<br>  Hopefully he'll understand.|`|Z9svX7r4aa	awww. man that suckss. Well, I dont know why his parents are so strict, thats over protective. 2nd of all, it seems that every oppurtunity he has is taking and risking it with you, so, he obviously really likes you too. Well, the only thing you can do is, since you still really like him, just put up with it. He is getting older, so his parents will hopefully get less protective. I would stay with it, and hopefully it doesnt ruin your relationship in general. I hope this helped (:
5VHWy0Ggaa	well i couldn't really tell you if she was faking it or not... i was going to say that most girls fake it to make their partner feel more confident, before i read the whole thing... but i'm not really sure.<br>  <br>  the best thing i say to do is to talk to her... tell her that it's okay if she faked it, and let her know that you want to know the truth... so you can make the experience more pleasurable for her next time. i would say to maybe try different techniques, and stick to whatever turns out best... but don't keep it the same, i think you know what i'm trying to say! lol... but i would just talk to her, since you two have good communication, then talk about it! maybe she just said that in the spur of the moment since you two had just been intimate with eachother. she may feel more comfortable out of that situation.|`|GXglwjW4aa	You're right, she probably was faking it.|`|HH90Eghaaa	Hard to tell, really by faking  she is just hurting herself. There is nothing really you can do if she wishes to continue this, if indeed she is faking! Just watch out for the wrath later on, when she finally gets sick of faking and starts blaming you!|`|LDe9yzCKaa	just tell her that you would like her to be honest w/ u... cause if w/e you r doing is not working... u have to do something diff.... good luck!|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	i would be really honest and gentle about it<br>  i think that your points "I would feel rotten if I continued the same technique i was using and it wasn't getting her off.Part of me thinks she did it to make me more confident and feel better about myself as a partner" are REALLY valid<br>  <br>  just talk to her about it<br>  i think she will appreciate the dialogue<br>  <br>  OR you can just say...'what did you like about last night? what works best for you? i am into doing whatever you want"<br>  then she will be able to direct you if she is willing|`|qGOxMYpHaa	you should be happy she faked it to make you feel happy because she cares for you that much.  im not a lesbian nor a woman but if u really want to make her ***, give her massages every other day.  just gentle rubbing motions on her thighs near the vagina and under the breast and on the back..it loosens up the body.  and do fingering techniques in a up and down fashion.|`|AA11108018	Than what you to do is get her so worked up before you go down on her that she begging for you to do it  Have fun and good luck|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Maybe she's being honest.

The further you go in the relationship im sure you'll be able to know, and learn more. Just ask more questions, like (does this feel better or that or so on...)|`|59cnZfTeaa	Without being there its hard to tell. I think you should take her word for it but it is possible she just said it to give you confidence. Either way she probably enjoyed it a lot so does it really matter?<br>  By the way i enjoyed your story. I found it hot|`|m8alP5kPaa	No one but her will know if she faked it or not. Ask her...if you don't want to ask straight out "did you fake it?"...maybe just ask her if you could do anything different that would "please" her more.|`|e86df6aeda098a41020c4baf4c81dcddaa	all i can say is ask her what she likes. try something and ask her if it honestly feels good. if she says no, try something else, and continue to ask.<br>  <br>  you never know until you try ! :)|`|bvse9jU7aa	When she got an "orgasm", did any juices/fluid come out of her vag?

43CAj5M8aa	The choice is yours. I prefer trimmed or shaved. It doesn't matter as long as it doesn't look like you have chewbacca in a leg lock. Some women can't shave because it irritates them and they get bumps. If that's the case then trim your bush with scissors or invest in a set of clippers with guards. Just be careful and don't cut the wrong thing.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	It's a garden, let it grow.|`|GrarZDDwaa	You  should shave. It's sexier and when you wear a bikini it's no worries. And when you have your period it's less gross.|`|qRKOWgS0aa	Shave around the top of your legs, near pubic area, so hair doesn't show when you put your panties on, just keep trim and tidy.|`|AA11083295	Men have different preferences some men like a girl to be completely shaved others like myself want a big hairy bush it's a turn on for me.  I trim myself|`|AA10652271	It depends on the person as to if they want to have public hair or not.|`|kERP7zAhaa	its do what ever is good for you|`|jYMlAN4Paa	There is no rule. It is whatever you feel comfortable with. Who cares what others do...you're the one who has to do it and live with it. Personally, I think that when people shave, it makes them look prepubescent...in other words...a child. The thought of a guy wanting to have sex with a woman who is shaved because he likes it that way turns my stomach.|`|WMR8hVlfaa	There is no "rule". That's complete nonsense. If you want to shave, shave. If you don't, then don't. Nobody should be allowed to dictate wha tyou do with your body.|`|srAP6Vzvaa	if u like sex shave it. just the like the person above said. nothing is more ugly than a shaggy vagina. gross.|`|jXCjw64Iaa	Shave it if your a girl.<br>  Shave or trim if your a guy.|`|MfUMaKcDaa	haha there's no rule. i like to keep it nice smooth and trimmed, otherwise i think it's kinda gross.|`|6nrLRKmeaa	shave, always all the time especially if you plan on having a good sex life XD|`|NrbLdZzOaa	Shave it|`|QHnS31Scaa	i trim it so its like a frsh hair cut|`|EgfL2c86aa	a lot of guys like none. however the first time my boyfriend and i had sex it was unexpected and i hadn't shaved in like a week and i told him i didn't want to but he said he didn't even care. i mean to be perfectly honest, i think a lot of guys prefer no hair but when your sitting naked on their bed, their honestly not gonna turn you down if you haven't shaved. ha.|`|jnEgsAHNaa	I think the rule is to just keep it well groomed.  By that, it means that you have to keep it trimmed very short or you can shave it.  It's really just a preference.  But yea, you have to shave, you can't let it grow old school :)|`|w4l8NajJaa	yeah whenever your about to you know uh hem lol<br>  shave but other than that let that thing grow like a bush lol<br>  haha i say just trim it with like scissors used for care not like the hand craft scissors in your moms sewing kit lol<br>  have fun kiddddsss : )|`|YCpR0Tg6aa	There's no rule. It's all about personal preference.|`|IwTkZ4jiaa	i dont know if you're talking about for when in bed, but if it is<br>  trust me... i mean you dont know me.... but you'll be more comfortable with yourself and your other will like it more if you shave.|`|BDPazdfnaa	theres no rule or fashion "season" to adhere to. just keep it neat, and if u have a bf/spouse listen to what he prefers.. :)<br>  p/s i think u could never really go wrong w/ brazilian|`|aXcT6AaQaa	There is no rule, its whatever you want.|`|mC2dRyuMaa	w.e u want w.e ur comfortable with im comfortable with shaving wen me and my bf u no but its w.e u want|`|p6y7STRHaa	do what you feel best with.|`|xmBWbmGkaa	Its up 2 u.

43CAj5M8aa	I will tell you this and you just do whatever you feel. I know that if a girl slept with me after the first couple of dates I would think she was a slut, or desperate. Being a guy sex is always on our minds.

Any sooner, and he wouldn't respect you.  Any later and he might move on.|`|UxRoUTvCaa	It's never too soon|`|zHJufZTcaa	You don't want to seem like a floozie. wait 3-4 dates then see how things are going|`|50CYDsayaa	I personally belive you should go with the flow,  Maybe hooping in bed after youve had the 1st date, but even then if it feels right then JUST DO IT, but if you just the slighest concern then id wait till it does feel right, and if they are that interested they will wait!|`|BxYWNm31aa	3rd date

I am speaking in terms of my fiance. If you mean obsessed as in I am constantly thinking of him, wanting to see him, knowing everything about him, and cherishing every moment we have together, then yes. If you mean obsessive to the point of being controlling, then no.|`|lK3TXGBOaa	well i think i am... you see hes a jerk and he never really calls me or txtxs me..he does it every other two days. so i decided to break up with him but even though i cut him off i have really strong feelings for him and idk everywhere i go i think about him, at work, music also reminds me of him...sometimes at home i get on myspace and look him up and i like to see his pictures and the comments that people write..but idk im not sure its an obsession? what do you think...i wish i could move on but idk how to...:(|`|13f8355359652cfde88b26bd8b3d6c6caa	hahah, yeah.

1acc6a03dc8acb93ccd9b56b409139d2aa	Wow i would definitly LOOSE the "best friend" and talk to my man about why he felt the need to talk to my "best friend" about OUR relationship.. your his girl not your best friend so i dont know why hes not talking to YOU about it... he should believe YOU not your "friend". But if you cheated and lied to him before then i can see why he went to the "friend".<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiHMP_ACRfxGuWKt4OszNL7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220162638AAFwOpm">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|K4Fnbvjuaa	I would be pissed...and it would make me a little suspicious. If you know what I mean. Your friends are not suppossed to talk **** and lie about you to your boyfriend, and your boyfriend is supposed to come to you to talk about relationship problems, not your best friend.
wI5SU7ykaa	find someone better than him|`|fEmCglDSaa	chocolate and sprite or jones soda|`|MySNBiDRaa	let me know if you find the answer :(|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Mmm... I know you are not going to agree with me.. but it's going out with someone new. I know there are more cons than pros on this one, but you have more chance of success than trying the "mature way". What do you think?
kN7MYvmIaa	no its good you have saved yourself till now from stdzz and pregnancy. 3 cheers to you. and now dont mess it up. make sure when u do it - be safe and have a good time, no need to hurry. do it when you feel you are ready. you are virgin does not mean ure not attractive, it means you are more mature and intelligent than your age.|`|4ZjWUjv6aa	About the boyfriend, it  may seem weird, but not all of us are the same.<br>  <br>  And being a virgin just means you have self control and self respect for yourself.|`|xgWf3SKxaa	dont have sex before marriage and yes its weird you havent had a bf yet but idk its okay i guess maybe you should wear makeup or something im sorry im not trying to be mean|`|seJxUXHCaa	No; I lost my virginity at a VERY young age (13) =\ And it was only soon after that I realized how important my virginity was and that I cannot take it back. Many people lose their virginity at a young age these days, and I respect you for waiting, it's good to wait. I really wish I waited for the right guy but instead I lost mine to a boy I really loved & he broke my heart. And for the boyfriend part, feel lucky for that, the heartbreak is awful and you should be happy it's something you don't have to deal with; because it truly SUCKS. You just haven't found the right guy yet appearently; don't worry! He'll come along when your least expecting it ;)|`|HNmKgYnUaa	I'm in the same situation...same age same eveything.<br>  it doesn't matter to me.<br>  <br>  I have to study and go to school and wouldn't have time to dedicate to a relationship now anyway.<br>  <br>  And besides we have Bill and Tokio Hotel and thats the best part.|`|77NzfiVkaa	No, not really. Especially the virgin thing, I would count that as being good. I think more people should wait until they are actually mature enough to make that kind of decision. You will find the right guy eventually.|`|kAIXDVu1aa	no it's not weird|`|FHrQzaPqaa	No this is not weird at all. when you are ready you will know do not let<br>  anybody tell you different.|`|tC02KPckaa	No. That is a good thing. Most girls are not virgins, and have started having sex at 16.|`|HildPYKOaa	ohh you're 18..i just turned 19..my case is just like urs..but thatt's not weird..i mean, i don't feel bad for being virgin or something..but wait there's someone special for you..i'd rather something late but good..u know what i mean..<br>  so ...take it easy..I BET You'll find someone who will complete you..u only need patience|`|b82ybE3gaa	Its only weird if you want a boyfriend and don't want to be a virgin anymore...but its not a bad thing. I don't praise people who decide to wait, because I personally think its a personal choice. so either be happy the way you are. or change it if your ready to.|`|NZ4iWM9maa	weird no, unexpected yea|`|AA10307482	You are doing just great.<br>  Work hard and study hard - you will be a big success.|`|HMzUeqTmaa	thats funny...18 your old same situation, never really ha a girlfriend. Yea i guess it is kinda normal|`|6627NijZaa	no it just means u will have a wonderful future instead of those gettin pregnant at age 18|`|AO3blmIQaa	no its normal|`|E6CShQfKaa	Not at all, that is great! Guys can screw up your life. Think twice before getting involved with anyone. Good luck! Wait until marriage!|`|4zeazkWOaa	that means you're pure ;;)|`|l3T0wmSyaa	nope<br>  your time will come and you will meet someone|`|DErBSfZgaa	no, maybe it's just because you havn't found the right guy.<br>  don't stress it hun (:<br>  im sure there's someone out there for you.|`|owjQbCzjaa	No, it's not weird at all!<br>  It just means your not a h o e<br>  and you are waiting for the RIGHT guy to come, and all that waiting will deffinalty pay off in the end, when you are with your prince charming, while other girls are at home eating ben & jerry crying their eyes out about their crappy "boyfriend"<br>  <br>  <br>  your time will come|`|vTra7n5baa	No.  At my school, which was very academic and a bit elitist, practically everyone was virgin until they went to college.  As freshmen, they lost their inhibitions and felt sex would be okay because they were legally adults.  Naive, but better than losing your virginity at 12.  Many, many people don't date until college or beyond so don't even give this a second thought.|`|XQ4OOqwoaa	no ........<br>  is it b/c you are not allowed too or you don't want to? <br>  b/c if you are not allowed too then it's fine <br>  but if a NICE guy some along and asks you out thinks about it before saying no......<br>  and never go with oh the guy is nice to me so i think he likes me b/c the changes are he is only flirting with you .|`|PvwZdLuLaa	No that's not weird at all! It's really admirable today in this sex crazed world.|`|W7l1awFPaa	Not weird.  I assume it means that you have decided that most of the men you meet don't really interest you and possibly that you are saving yourself for that special man who will prove it by asking him to marry you first.|`|uLHtXibRaa	Its only because society advocates sex as a hobby,passtime and the only way in life to get satisfaction ..and if you havent had it your weird...you are not weird..its the world and ppls attitudes whih are weird..|`|5lFppGAVaa	Nope best thing you can do there is plenty of time for all of that.  Take it from someone who had a boyfriend and a baby at 16.|`|Ud2IseT6aa	NO!!!! u just need to wait till the time is rite and the perfect guy cums around. and its best to wait till ur married b4 u have sex dont listen to all those sl*uts who have done it already|`|SMv0Xj20aa	why would that be weird??|`|uRbeSOMwaa	Of course not!|`|7m2SWTtgaa	OMG no it is so not weird. In fact you should be proud of yourself! you own something that others have lost. Ok??<br>  Do it wen YOU are ready<br>  GL<br>  xoxo|`|ozRry8cNaa	No it isn't weird at all.  Being a virgin just means that when you get married you can give your virginity up to the man you love, and not some guy who was a one night fling.  Be proud that you are a virgin because look at the world around us, so many teen girls are getting pregnant and ruining the future that they built up on.  <br>  <br>  It's not weird not to have a boyfriend, it just means that you haven't found a guy that catches your interest yet and that is perfectly fine.  You don't have to rush to get a boyfriend, your young and have your whole life in front of you!! =)<br>  <br>  So have fun with life and don't worry about that stuff lol because you are perfectly fine and normal not weird at all. =)|`|2xQuaZHwaa	no|`|mC2dRyuMaa	no not wierd at all its normal when u find the rite guy to be with and hes the right guy to take it to the next level ull no and itl hurt lol but its normal so smile =D|`|c9988f25b01126242b7097d8fdabc8bfaa	Really depends on what kind of environment that you live in.  I personally do not think that is at all "weird."  Whatever you're comfortable is fine.  It doesn't really matter, and it's not like it's a bad thing.  <br>  <br>  I'm 17, never had a boyfriend and a virgin...or a kiss.  Don't compare yourself with other people on things like this.  Be yourself and if you ARE comfortable being those things, then it's fine.|`|tCpe36CEaa	no dont listen to  the kids in school. Their dum|`|MTkXXOsjaa	I'm positive that you're a complete weirdo/psycho/loser/etc. to many people in the world because everybody has a different opinion on life's many aspects.  All that matters is that you do what you do and make no unwanted compromises.  Personally, I find a person to be pretty awesome to cherish their virginity but the next person might think that you're pretty odd for not losing it years ago.|`|IPFVpcN9aa	yeaahhh..you see i am a gymnast and i make time for my love bird..if your feeling alone...try a dating service or the local coffee shop|`|5QPJ9NRxaa	not at all. high school guys are immature.<br>  <br>  and honestly wait for sex until marriage thats some of the best advice you'll ever get.|`|r0BM2oEdaa	It's tottaly normal, and a very responsible choice. I mean if you havn't had a boyfriend is it because your unsure of yourself, or you just dont have time for them. Because really, if you do want one you have to love yourself for who you are and embrace it, you just compliment yourself, like "my eyes are stunning" or whatever you want. And some boy is going to come along and believe that to. Trust ittt.,|`|8ev2YhNSaa	actually no. and i wish i was in your position actually. i actually lost mine about two months ago. and now i realize it wasn't worth it. i really wish that i could take it back. yeah i am going out with the girl i did it with..but i feel different empty inside. truthfully i praise you for still being a virgin! and wait till your married. i wish that i could say the same!! so make sure you stay that way until you found your true love and marry him. then it would be fine. i wish that i could say i was a virgin again. i would give just about anything for it back.|`|6c010ec34eb50fa52c9a9cfde1163d14aa	No way. Take your time and find the right person. There are a lotta crazies out there lol.|`|yOr4SOO4aa	Not really, probably all the guys you know are not as good as you need your guy to be.|`|35ae746aae90d4f0ba10e9f5ecba492baa	No, it is not wierd.  I don't even have a girlfriend either even if I'm 17.  I didn't have one because I made a promise not to have one.  Some people called me a "monk" or a "priest" when they asked me if I have ever kissed a girl or not.|`|vFlUT9Zzaa	No, absolutely not.|`|avlaSaUaaa	No its not at all,<br>  <br>  In fact I respect you for saving yourself, it shows alot of self pride and digniaty!|`|RIJDIeC6aa	I don' t think so. Maybe you has your mind on other things and it hasn't been the right time ti have a boyfriend. Remember just cause you've never had a boyfriend it doesn't mean you're boring or weird. People don't define you, maybe you don't need a boyfriend.|`|RXzj8vg2aa	I find it tacky, and immature to lose your virginity b4 marriage.  Don't fall into peer pressure and think that its wierd to be 18 and a virgin, im 22yr old virgin and im proud of it.|`|wCIVNMIsaa	Nope i was a virgin until i was 19|`|1ceywpfVaa	No no no!  That means that you have a little more self respect than all the sluts and man-sluts out there.  But if you aren't out and about by age. . . say. . . 30? then I would advise online dating or something like that.  Don't sweat it, kid.  You're totally normal.|`|g3I4zblPaa	Nope. I am 16, still a virgin and never had a bf.|`|uDSXv5Fbaa	no not really, just the part that you havent had a bf but that in itself isnt that odd.|`|vBqIRHppaa	nope.im the exact same age and ive never had a bf either and im a virgin also.<br>  theres just other things that are more important to us in life i guess.<br>  :)|`|blDGgrv5aa	Not weird at all.|`|ZS4gMRrwaa	No, it's not weird at all.. you just want to find the right person.|`|itiJVgRsaa	no it's not weird. you do what you feel in your heart is right and you do what you want when you're ready. i didn't have sex til i was 17 cuz i wasn't ready yet before that.|`|fWJwoMFSaa	no it shows your responsible|`|rhuM3r5naa	no it just means your not going to end up like my mom.my mom did it early and i haooend when she was 16.it means your responsible and mind my langue but tat shows yoour no a slut.|`|CAf3ooH2aa	Not weird at all.  You're smart 'cause there's all kinds of crap out there!  When it's right and you're ready you'll know, regardless of what age you are.|`|rHMQs5cSaa	Not weird at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  That just means you are waiting for your first love and thats good!!!!!<br>  <br>  and good your a virgin wait till marriage ; )|`|DrYNAjfcaa	nope, i am saving myself for marriage too!|`|xtcSsPPwaa	not really|`|vJnVhly5aa	no my dad tells me i cant have a boyfriend until i am 25.That's pretty weird but that's the actual age when you are more mature and responsible for your actions.Everything will be fine as long as u will not die for that******|`|SG74Zc5Qaa	no not really . True Love will come your way when you find the right guy.<br>  Good Luck!<br>  xx|`|wkcopSvpaa	Nope it is not weird at all...... I am heading the same way like you because I am saving myself for marriage for somebody that I want to spend the rest of my life with.....
aigFTh1Vaa	aww thats sweet he should ask you to go out with him soon... if not he might want you to ake the first move|`|wNtBzGGYaa	I think you need to ask him. for another day or so just play along and poke him back and just goof off with him. then once you guys become even more close you should just go for it!
R0U4qy6haa	holy moly-you have my vote|`|d6cbd4f49a6660cc733a0b7ea8151199aa	I'm an *** man, turn around, retake and repost.

I7OqMnkfaa	be realllyyy sweet and outgoing!!<br>  girls LOVE confidence<br>  <br>  but dont try too hard at it<br>  haha <br>  :D<br>  <br>  good luck buddy!!|`|HU7iCAFAaa	well i can tell you this, you can talk to girls and let them know you better, then on some days give her flowers or a card something little to start off with. then when your hanging out more ask her to do something a date, dinner, go to the movies, and other stuff and then you might have a girlfriend.|`|2Q3aOzebaa	First of all, if you have a lot of girl friends..the first thing to do is to ask them about your problem.  Second, if you find someone you like.. be more interested in them, and talk to them for awhile; like for a couple months.  Girls always either like to talk about themselves, or there's the ones that like to listen to what you have to talk about.<br>  <br>  You can try asking them how their day was and stuff like that. And for sources of information, you can always ask her friends about the things she likes.<br>  <br>  If they say no, it probably just means she wants to be friends and doesn't want to lead you on.  Or she just doesn't like you.  If they avoid you, they're probably shy or don't know how to say no without hurting you. If you get someone who avoids you; remind them about what you asked and about their answer, until they give you a definite answer.  But not constantly.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little. c: I know I wasn't making much sense. Good luck!|`|gKhR0sgLaa	I think the problem is that you are too nice honestly. You are treating girls like you are a friend, and nothing more. Listening to their problems does not make you wanted. I believe, being too nice actually either makes you look desperate, or like you want to be a friend with them and nothing more.<br>  <br>  You have to separate yourself from the other guys that girls are friends with. Busting girls balls(not literally) will show them that you aren't desperate, and shows that you could care less whether or not you and that said friend go out. If she even kind of wants you, they will feel that you might not want them back. That's where you give some signs, while still busting their balls. This shows that you are interested, but aren't obsessed. If they feel you don't want them much, but are interested, chances are they will want you in return.<br>  <br>  It's hard to explain in words, but the gist of it is to be more of a man. Stop being like a girl friend, and start being more a guy. Girls will probably respect the confidence, and will also feel you aren't simply friend material.<br>  <br>  Most girls might disagree and say "stay nice, there aren't enough nice guys out there," but they want what they cant have usually.|`|xCpUIaXZaa	hey dude, ur pictures didnt show up on yahoo. um if u want u can try 2 email ur pics 2 my email. i'll tell u honestly wat i think. ok pal :)  also, its late 4 me rite now,my brain is like fried!! i need 2 think about wat advise 2 give u on how 2 get a girlfriend. ok dude. dont wory we  will all try 2 help u :)  hang loose bro! :)|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	ask to have dinner with you  at a nice restraint  and  show how  u can be a good boyfriend  like open door for her pull out her chair   help her with her  jacket  and bring her flowers|`|iFT4EK4Vaa	ask one of the girls that is your friend out.  What do you know!!!  Maybe she will say yes!  omg i would have never guessed|`|ub6SPfpuaa	You will find a girl who appreciates you one day...just keep being yourself...that is if your looking for "the one"<br>  <br>  For something more casual u might want to play hard to get a little more :)|`|PvwZdLuLaa	Change your attitude with your girl friends to be more romantic rather than friendly.|`|BSQXfLLiaa	Since I am a female and have had a few boyfriends I can tell you some girls like guys certain guys because of their bad habits but being yourself will get you a girlfriend one day don't rush or feel bad about it.
GUUa1s6Laa	I don't think so, sorry. I'll tell you why<br>  1.) I am not sure if by 'her' you mean you or your friend. If you mean your friend then he was insinuating he likes your friend. If you meant you, then he wouldn't move if you sat next to him.<br>  2.)I dont know the tone of voice for this one, but it sounds like he may have been irritated that you asked you him about that<br>  3.) I'm iffy about this one. He may be flirting with all the other girls but either way this does not mean he doesn't like you<br>  1.) Seems irrelevant because I dont know the context<br>  2.) If he likes her then that would make sense<br>  3.) He used to ask you for help but he doesnt now. Helping in school is an excellent way to get to know a girl. So  I assume he no longer wants to get to know you<br>  4.) I dont know how old you are, but jr. high/high school are pretty brutal for popularity,it seems like you are one or the other and not much mingling. Luckily this all ends after highschool!<br>  <br>  So that's my opinion. Sorry:)|`|pmkP39hcaa	well... he could but he doesnt want you to know... or he doesnt and he doesnt want people to think he does. just go up to him and ask him if he does thats great if he doesnt oh well and tell him that ur okay and dont want things to be awkward and just be friends.|`|ay2ksWhsaa	Sorry i dont think he likes you.

8FbOtXAXaa	You back away from relationships because you want to trust a guy but I don't think a guy has really proven himself as trustworthy to you,so you think that whenever a guy is trying to get close to you then he is going to do something to hurt you in some way.This guy really confused you and don't feel bad that you blocked him from your facebook or whatever because you are just wasting time worrying about that little puke. Just move on and if you run into a guy that you like and he is genuinely nice and caring and you feel like you can trust him then go for it!

5WQXVwbDaa	Yes you or your boyfriend at whatever age can get it from planned parenthood. You must get it within 3 days or it will not work. It is free at planned parenthood and you can buy it at any pharmacy for at least $40. Planned parenthood and any pharmacy has it on hand because timing is crucial. Even if you don't have a appointment show up early and wait.<br>  <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.plannedparenthood.org/</a>   They also offer this birth control called Mirena which is a IUD they insert in you. They do that for free too. They basically just ask for donations. But they have real doctors. It only takes a minute for them to put it in and it is a bit scary with a pinch but you can choose to not get pregnant for 5 to ten years. I have it and it works well. It's the smart thing to do unless you plan on having a kid any time soon. From the looks of it you are young so you should take your time. Good luck!|`|Nui0BRAEaa	anyone can buy it over the counter any pharmacy, no prescription|`|Wvuj8VIHaa	<a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.plannedparenthood.org/</a> CAN HELP YOU OUT TREMENDOUSLY GOOD LUCK!BTW UR REALLY PRETTY|`|C4zZ6Wktaa	Yes they do have the morning after pill.

hmLo323Uaa	You wrote, “I was wasted.” The next thing you wrote was “I wasn’t that drunk.”  I think there is your problem.  Try having a non-alcohol night together. Sometimes anticipation, pressure and booze do not mix.  Have just a normal night / day. Go out and eat, maybe grab a movie and lay around on the couch.  It well happen when you take the stress and booze out of it and just let it happen.  <br>  <br>  After you break down the barrier, you can return to the drunken screw-fest.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  BP|`|SG4WDeKNaa	Just relax.

It could be financial reason or it could be that his feeling, his love for you has not reached to that deep level of emotional stage (to the point that we cannot live without the one we truely love).  That could have been the reason that he held back.  Based on your description about him, he didn't seem to me as a bad guy.  In fact, he seemed to be honest with his feeling toward you, eventhough the way he communicated toward you, seemed hurtful and he could have approached in a better way without hurting a girl's feeling.  At least, he's not like one of those perverts who only see women as a sexual pleasure.<br>  <br>  Just hang in there, my friend.  Give him some time to refresh his mind until he realizes that he might be mistakenly passed on a wonderful chance of establishing a wonder life with that beautiful girl that he had turned down after the Valentine's Day.<br>  <br>  Take care, dear!
Q5BM2POnaa	any relationship where one or more of the parties is in 7th grade is doomed even if you lived next door.<br>  <br>  Here are the harsh realities<br>  <br>  1. he's a long distance away and neither of you are old enough to drive or have a car<br>  <br>  2. 99.9% of all relationships at that age don't last <br>  <br>  3. you've never actually met him or he you.  How in the world could even a mature adult tell someone was "meant to be" from a few keystrokes and photo exchange?<br>  <br>  -------------------------<br>  <br>  It's not ageist to know that 99.9% of relationships started in the 7th grade never even make it to 9th grade much less to adulthood.  That's just reality.  The sooner you put your raging hormones aside and realize that, the happier you will be. <br>  <br>  You asked a question.   If you didn't really want an honest answer, you probably shouldn't have asked.  The reality is, at your age, you know almost nothing compared to what you will know 20 years from now.  If you've had 8 boyfriend already that doesn't suggest experience, it's suggests you don't have good parents and have a poor relationship with your father.<br>  <br>  I stand by my decision - the relationship is doomed.  <br>  <br>  Now quit focusing on boys and do some things to build up your confidence, self-esteem and intelligence.|`|AA11263103	its doomed.|`|z5Hl6Bhtaa	Wow your mad young to be doing this stuff.

My boyfriend and I have been together since the 8th grade and we are now 22 and 23 years old. His family also knew about me and I had to secretly date him behind my parents back.

All you need is to have patience and not to let anyone have their games with you. The right guy will come along, when the time will be right. Just try not to get hurt in the process of waiting, otherwise you might just send him away and put all men in the same category. There is more than one special someone in everyone's life, nothing is (fortunatelly) forever and the only thing you have to care about is your happiness and your health. Don't let anyone get in the way of that. I had to learn that the hard way, and I only wish none of you will.|`|8uHQngbNaa	No. Especially video games.|`|INLQHsl7aa	yes it is...|`|8a8CZqGLaa	Sure.

y4zYkceEaa	If I were you I wouldn't get involved with someone who does drugs. It can create a lot of problems, via relationship wise. You can be friends with him & tell him that doing drugs isn't all that good. From my experience, if he's addicted to drugs, he won't up and listen to you. You're gonna have to make an impact on his life. Give it a try though, good luck! ;))|`|K1uUvEcWaa	no dont do it with him, dont give in to peer pressure.<br>  just talk to him and tell him your here for him.<br>  hes probably going through a hard time, maybe he never had many friends and now hhes finally fitting in? but thats no excuse. i bet he doesnt enjoy doing these drugs.<br>  talk to him and hang out with him and show him a good time without drugs or any peer pressure events :]|`|mC2dRyuMaa	Tell him that drugs are the worst for him its killing him slowly tell him you realy like him and he can have a chance with you if he stops doing drugs maby thatl scare him to stop and change for you idk worth a shot gd luck|`|jo3kUQXTaa	You said you've "liked" him for a year.  If you just like him, and aren't already in a relationship, give him up - now.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying this really based on the drugs issue - it could have been anything that made you come on and ask questions and question why you still "like" him.<br>  <br>  you say you want to become friends with him, but clearly you didn't know him that well if you didn't know about the drugs.  if what you are learning about him now is already making you question yourself - you probably will only like him less - or have to change who you are to become better friends or get closer<br>  <br>  he's not worth changing for - no matter how hot or cute he seems right now - no one is worth that.|`|VUjvhnreaa	This is something I've ran into before. When I was 12 my boyfriend was doing drugs an his mom had just died. He was getting high everyday an well lord knows what else.You learn you can't help someone unless they want to help themselves first, otherwise there's no point.<br>  The only thing you can do is stay away from the drugs if you dont want in that crowd.|`|a193VN0Laa	He might run in the opposite direction if you jump in and try and make him stop but if you become friends with him and build a relationship where what you think and say matters then you'll have the opportunity to express how you feel and help him change.|`|E3UX1SzWaa	do it with him or get over it.  if its weed its really not a big deal.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	You can't help someone that doesn't want help.  He's probably doing drugs because all of his friends do.  If you want to know what "high" looks like, watch intervention or celebrity rehab. <br>  <br>  If you are really insistent on helping him, tell a counselor at school what you know. It will get the authorities involved and get him the help he needs.|`|a8c86432a8a5add7fcbf2436c1c53a6daa	first see if its true.. second you shouldnt be shy..third tell him he shouldnt have to take drugs to fit into the popular croud.. and forthhh.. tell him reasons why

J3JClsuQaa	To me, it sounds like her response wasn't that mature, ya know?  I agree with you for coming out and asking what was on your mind.  I would want to date someone who did the same.  If she was flirtin with the girl on myspace, she shouldda been a woman and owned up to it, and TRIED to explain it away...  Honesty and owning up to mistakes are qualities I admire.  Did ya check the dates on when the lovey dovey was goin on?  If it was same day/ recent I would not vall her.  If she's worth it and is a good person AND wants to be with you, she will "woman-up" and call you.  : )  Good luck.

If she can't be straight-laced and act like she speaks then you'd only be putting yourself out on a limb to continue anything past a plain ol' friendship with her.  In other words, if she tells you that she doesn't like that other person, she should obviously not be socializing with that person in that manner.  Otherwise, she IS playing games.
pERzRTxlaa	I think he was asking you out. It sounds like he had planned to ask you to see that movie with him but since you had already seen it, it caught him off guard. He probably had played it through in his mind that you would say no and he would have asked you to watch it with him. Sorry, better luck next time.

You shouldn't be the only one trying to make things good.  He has to do his part as well. Talk to him about it.

There are way too many fish in the sea for you to be desperate about him.  Trust. ';-()

Preferably his parents... ) <br>  <br>  I mean does it ever end?<br>   ( In his case it's probably not... Until he finds serenity and peace with God he is going to reiterate this atrocious flaw. ) <br>  <br>  What is the purpose of it?<br>   ( He may have a low self-esteem... People who cheat feel as if they need to prove something to themselves or the world. When you are living a dreadful life, you may attempt to harm others so they can be depressed as well. )<br>   <br>  He refuses to divorce her....but can't stay faithful to her. So I have given her the courage to file for a divorce. She finally believes in herself and has taken the first step.<br>  <br>  ( Good job... She has has hampered enough time as it is.

Are there people out there that just can never stop? Is it like a disease???<br>  <br>  ( When a man does not know God, he is prone to any type of deception: murder, kidnapping, rape, theft, infidelity, etc. A man without God allows sinister motives to penetrate his spirit. The sinister actions will emerge in his character as you see many people today... Yes, with God you can perish any sinister action. Without God, you are beguiling yourself with the pernicious. In my opinion, infidelity epitomizes evil. It is a form of treachery and there is nothing worst than betrayal.

She needs to move on with her life and find a man that will take her seriously. This other guy needs Yahweh in his life because he is lost. If he does have God in his life, he needs to beg Yahweh to liberate him from this pernicious habit. It's very atrocious and it's not of God.

To make matters worse, there is a child as a result of the affair.  I love my wife and honestly it had nothing to do with my love for her.  In fact we were not having any problems at all.  My friend used to say that men were genetically flawed and geared toward having multiple women.  I can tell you what I think it is.  I was flattered by the advances of that woman and it felt good to be wanted.  I think mostly, men have a low self esteem and need or crave the attention.  It is hard to refuse another woman especially if she is a looker.  <br>  But it took almost losing my wife to know what I would be losing.  I am a straight flyer now and we are in chirch now too.  I know from experience that I will never go down that road agaon because now... the only attention I want is that from my wife.   ;-)|`|dEjFE6A9aa	it can be, he could be a sex addict, this affects both men and women, for every guy ive known who cheats, there is a woman doing the exact same thing. Its not a guy issue, its a people issue. There is a saying it takes 2 to tango! But yea they are addicted to the thrill of being wanted, the attention, and the pleasure of a sexual realise. They also desire variety, which means different women in his case. It can be helped but he has to seek help and admit he has a problem, if not there is nothing u can do. <br>  <br>  The real sad thing is he is a sad man with real low self esteem and constantly needs reassurance of his man hood by other women, but whats sadder is he is destroying another woman's confidence, and her faith in men as a whole, which i think is a huge crime. Because its the good men and women who suffer for there crimes in the future, when members of either gender find it difficult to trust in a relationship again, for fear of history repeating itself.<br>  <br>  You did the right thing giving her courage to move on your a good friend, i just wish there where more honest people like you, to make the victims see the light sooner. But great job. And i hope my answer has given you a little more insight. <br>  <br>  Take care

Studies show that confidence is the key to looking good and feeling good. To gain confidence, try writing a list of things you are good at and things that you like about yourself. For instance: <br>  My pretty eyes are complimented often <br>  I have a great personality <br>  I can get along with people easily <br>  I have a lot of friends<br>  <br>  Also, a great way to gain confidence is to join a sport that you are good at, or want to excel in. Not only will this boost your self-esteem, you are guaranteed to make new friends! Boys love when girls are oozing self confidence, but they also like a girl that is humble, so don't get a big head. <br>  Break the touch barrier. The touch barrier is an invisible 'thing' that stops you from interacting physically with a crush. To break it, touch him whenever you can. While talking to him, casually touch him on the shoulder or playfully go up behind him and pull his hood up. Be careful, though. These things (if used extensively) can be annoying to him. <br>  Get to know him. Though we can be quick to want to date random hotties, said hottie could be freaked when you ask him out without even a conversation first. To get a conversation started, talk about him; everybody likes talking about themselves. Talk about your interests, jobs, families, friends, pets, favorite things, you name it. If he is in the same sport as you, or a sport you want to join, voila! More time with Mr. Right. <br>  Slowly start giving him the signs... Joke around with him, to start! Make him laugh and feel himself and comfortable with you. If you are bold enough, ask him to go out with you and your friends to a movie, lunch, or just hanging out at the mall or local park. Look him more in the eyes, but make sure that you don't look at him strangely; this will turn him off. Smile at him when passing in the halls, or give him a playful high five. A few compliments will show him that you are into him. <br>  Find the right time... for him to ask you out. When you are with your friends, the guy might feel awkward to ask you to 'talk privately'. (Wouldn't you?) If he is shy, ask him yourself! The worst thing that could happen is rejection; and when that happens, move on! Its time to go boy hunting again. If he says yes, congrats! It is all you from here on out. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  TipsYesTips Yes This sounds cliché,cliche  REALLY; be yourself. If you aren't yourself when getting to know a guy, and you end up going out with him, is it really fair to you that he likes you for who you're not? If that's confusing, just think of how long you're going to have to keep up the act. <br>  Get a new look! It can be as dramatic or subtle as you want; dye your hair pink (this may not attract some groups of guys), or get side bangs or layers, but dont gedon't caught up on looks. If he's a good person, he'll barely notice. The possibilities are endless, and this is sure to get your guys' attention! <br>  Ask your friends for advice; there is a good chance that some of them have had boyfriends. If not, think about if you have the TIME to have one, and if you are ready. <br>  Don't rush it. Guys are just as shy as girls, and when you reach up to kiss him on the first date, he might be happy, but he also might be a bit nervous and scared. Work your way up the ladder: Hugging', 'Holding hands', First kiss, 'Cuddling', French kissing and making out... you finish the rest. Just make sure that when you reach the end of the ladder, you go back to the basics every once in a while. It gets a bit tiring at the top, over and over again. <br>  Have fun! Relationships aren't supposed to be about stress and being 'tied down'. If you feel this way, consider taking a break from boys<br>  Warnings Don't get volved in sexual activity unless you know ALL the risks and consequences of the aftermath. <br>  When you have a boyfriend, be aware of jealousy from friends. If this happens, maybe your friend used to have a crush on your boyfriend; that means you've done something wrong. Consider: are you really hurting your friend with the relationship you're in? Who is more important, the friend or the guy? NEVER make your friend feel replaced. <br>  When talking to your man don't tell him about all of the compliments you get from other guys. Even if they are his friends, as long as you don't lead them on everything will turn out alright. Telling him will just make him become uncomfortable and defensive. Keep it to yourself and your relationship will run smoothly. <br>  If you try to start a conversation with a boy and he gives quick or short answers then moves away then thats a sign he prefers someone else<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

50yx063Daa	Hey,<br>  <br>  Please let me start off by saying that nothing seems to be the matter with you...it's your ex boyfriend that has some maturity issues. You guys probably have a two year age difference and he's making a fuss over that? I'm sorry to come off as being so straight forward, but someone who is willing to use the excuse of age is pretty lame. So please sweetie, don't you dare think it's you that needs to mature up, it's him. <br>  <br>  But if you really want to prove to him that you can be mature and handle this situation like a lady...I say don't let it effect you. Yes...usually people say "don't make it LOOK like it effects you", but I'm suggesting to you NOT to let it effect you. Do you see what I mean? The person you are with should like you for who you are as a person and not who you are in age. Please don't go begging him to take you back or write him letters upon letters telling him how much you care because then he'll think he's got you wrapped around your little finger. <br>  <br>  I say take pride in who you are and where you are in this point in your life. I'm sure you are a talented and confident person, and quite honestly age has nothing to do with it. I hope you take my advice and stay just the way you are. Don't change for anyone, but yourself.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	leave him alone so he won't go to jail. That's how.|`|tMEUPBo4aa	Sounds like he is dating someone else. A senior, maybe or someone college bound. If we are talking high school, most high school boys wants to date older women. If he broke up with you, there is probably someone else in the picture. Most guys don't breakup, single. All guys keep a "stand by" on hand ... just in case.

His parents are paying for the rehersal dinner, little bits for the wedding, and gifts for the honeymoon.

But no one has offered money- his parents or mine. You have to decide within yourself if you want to accept the $ from your mom.

My mother is making punch, because she wanted to help me, but she is about $50,000 in debt. So I wanted to make her feel like she was helping w/o giving her a burden.

Once they start putting money in they start getting a say in the planning.  If his parents don't want to pay, they don't have to.  Your mom is financially insecure then maybe YOU should offer to help pay from your and your fiance's pockets.<br>  MAYBE you could tell your mom you really appreciate it and would LOVE for her help in paying for the flowers, or your dress. Give her ONE item she can pay for.  She just wants to help, but you know her situation I wouldn't let her pay for a whole wedding unless she is 100% insistent.  In that case, keep the costs VERY low. Make your own favours, print your own invites, make your own centerpieces etc. There are TONS of Do-it Yourself projects you can do that will look professional.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	You should be prepared to pay for it all yourselves, and not expect anyone to help.

And dont be bitter; they have no obligation to help out. <br>  <br>  Since your mother is kind enough to contribute, let her know how much you appreciate it. Oh, and just let her contribute a set amount that she can afford without breaking the bank, rather than an unset amount like "at least half". Then you and fiance come up with rest, and plan the wedding within that budget.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	We paid for our own wedding. It is not up to your parents to pay.

But times were different then.  There are so many other considerations to factor in now.  I have been married 11 years - I was 26, he was 32.  As we both worked & both our parents were pensioners at the time, we just started planning with the full expectation that we would be paying.  But my parents wanted to make a contribution & so as not to offend them & totally abolish the traditions of old which were important to them, both sets of parents covered the reception bill - at the time $8000.  So his parents & mine both gave us a cheque for $4000 & they were delighted to do that.  At the end of the day, I am sure you wouldn't like to see your Mum worrying about how she will pay for it so perhaps not going overboard on expense & asking her to pay for an item ie cake, flowers, photographer etc & then perhaps your partner might ask his parents to do the same.  Don't start married life with strained in-law relationships.  Start saving your money, pay for it  yourselves & you will be proud of what you have achieved.  And remember, you crawl before you walk, you cannot have a Jolie-Pitt style wedding on a $1000 budget.  Whats most important is you and him & celebrating the day with the ones you love.  And congratulations|`|F8iYNurEaa	Even though your mum offered to pay at least half of your wedding, you shouldn't let her if she has financial problems. It is lovely that she offered but you need to decline it, or only let her pay for one aspect of the wedding (maybe your dress, or the the flowers, or photographer). I agree with you that it isn't fair that she pay a huge amount towards the wedding when your fiance's family don't contribute at all. These days weddings cost ridiculous amounts of money and it is only fair that both sides contribute equally. I am getting married next year and my fiance and I are saving up to pay for our own wedding. My mum is going to make a donation towards our wedding fund, as is his family, and this is the way that works best for us. If you both set aside an amount to save each month (and stick to it) it is surprising how much money you can actually save over a relatively short period of time. Good luck.|`|nxPioaw5aa	His parents should offer to help, especially if they are well off.  I would find it very rude if they didn't!!  If they don't offer to help, your mom could pay for half and you and your fiance pay the other half.<br>  <br>  For our wedding, my fiance's parents are paying for the rehearsal dinner, open bar and photography, my parents are paying for the venues, dinner, cake, dj, flowers and me and my fiance are filling in where we can (invitations, favors, attendant gifts etc.)<br>  <br>  By the way, if his parents still refuse to pay anything, I would not let them have any input in the wedding (i.e. location, food, decorations etc.) and I would make them limit their guest list (i.e. they can't invite their friends, only their family).  I know it sounds kind of harsh, but if they can afford it and don't offer help, I think that is awful!  It's a different situation if parents don' t have the money to help.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|VA5OyI56aa	ur bf should pay every thing ..  u can help him but he is the one who is responsible to pay for u <br>  and his family should help him in that  <br>  <br>  this is what we have in islam <br>  see the place of woman in islam <br>  <br>   Husband is financially responsible. He has to prepare house and furniture for marriage, and he also has to give the bride the marriage-gift (Mahr, called dowry in English- Bride decide what she wants and the amount or type of the gift-money, property or else...)This is to support women more financially. In Islam, the giving of mahr to the bride by the groom is an essential part of the contract stated by God:|`|AA11449112	when i got married ... both of parents contributed to the wedding ... but we put out most of the money.<br>  <br>  we told our parents that we wanted to have a small wedding because we can't afford it.  we presented the list of people to them ... we told them that if they want to invite certain people - they have to pay for them. we also tricked them (i know its mean) we told them the price per guest at the reception was more than what they really are ($120 but in reality it was $89)<br>  <br>  i truly believe that both parents should contribute.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|WhYTUzMuaa	we have traditional indian marriage<br>  so from my side my mum (even I helped as much I can with my savings)and on reception his parents did.Of course my husband used to support them financially.But in your case I believe your mum's not giving bcoz of his parents,she just want to give it for you.So ,I believe don't put on too much on her.Ask her to share whatever she can comfortably and rest u and ur bf should be arranging as I don't find any reason to ask anyone if they are not willingly share.|`|5qwW4GGAaa	my mom is paying for the cake (under 250) and me and my fiance are paying for everything else..|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	My mom and Dad paid for most of it.  My husband paid for the honeymoon, the rental car, and gifts for the groomsmen, plus the tuxes.  His parents paid for the rehearsal dinner.  That's the way most weddings are done, with the groom's parents paying for the rehearsal dinner.  That's the least they should do.|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	We paid for our wedding ourselves.  Traditionally (which is changing rapidly), the bride's family paid for the wedding.  Your fiance's family may still be working with that tradition.  If you pay for your own wedding, then you get to make all the decisions, which is nice.  If your mum is helping to pay for it, then she may feel like she should have some say in how the money is spent, including who is and is not invited.  It's your choice whether you want to deal with that or not.<br>  <br>  If it were me, I wouldn't take money for something like a wedding from a mum who is struggling. I'd feel guilty having her pay for something she can't afford when a big wedding isn't a necessity.
O1MITmaGaa	question: have you asked your cousin if she likes him?<br>  <br>  and: why back off if you don't know if he likes you just as much/better?<br>  <br>  <br>  that said, there's little you can do but just...wait I guess. get yourself absorbed in other things, like new friends, or find a celebrity crush. occupy yourself so you won't have time to think of him.|`|1CcM7oNaaa	think of every bad thing about him that you can. eventually you'll realize that theres more bad stuff than there is good stuff
UMYda9Jaaa	In my experience, if the guy doesn't take the lead in a relationship, he's not too likely to take responsibility for it later on. So, my answer would be no: not out of fear of rejection but just out of respect for the men who have enough integrity to go after what they want.|`|uPbTsr9eaa	I am not a girl, i am a women, and no i would not. <br>  <br>  I did when I was younger and i am not doing it again!!! <br>  <br>  He broke my heart and made me look like an idiot.

I don't like spending my life waiting...|`|ar06i7cIaa	I am definitely the one to ask a man out on a date, Yes I fear rejection but whoever said that guys dont as well? Someone has to be more forward and say what they want. Some guys are in fear as well, so thats why they dont ask. You cant wait until he loses the fear because he may never lose it. <br>  <br>  Umm when someone doesnt feel the same way as you do just remember that some people were not meant for each other and atleast you can move on. <br>  <br>  Never be the one to ask yourself what if him and I?<br>  If you want something go for it, guys admire that. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!!! Email me for anything else!!!|`|AA11367901	No, cause I don't like rejection. If he don't like me enough to ask why should I waste my time.|`|Nhi8cxAvaa	No. We hope that you ask us out.

We don't live in the stone age where the male hunts the food and drags it home for the female to prepare at the fire. I share the responsibilty of cooking with my wife. She happens to be a good cook, but she only got that way through practice. Try to Google some recipes. It's easy to follow a recipe. That's how I do it. I'm no Emeril either.|`|wfE3mo7Naa	mad imp cuz a ***** that cant cook is useless unless shes mad hot
Bp8ls3XMaa	yes but i do not want to remember the painfuld experience.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	My ex wife got pregnant before we were married and lead me to believe I was the father.  I took her to get an abortion and paid for it.  I found out many years later after we were married that the aborted baby that I thought was mine wasn't.  <br>  <br>  Later, she became an alcoholic.  I tried for years to get her to go to rehab.  She refused until she had a DUI and totaled a car.  She then had an affair with someone she met in rehab.  <br>  <br>  How's that for the woman of any man's dreams?<br>  <br>  We are now divorced.

Your friend loves to brag about how good she looks and all of the cool stuff she has and she does it to make you feel like you don't have anything or that you are good enough as she is. She is not your friend at all if she is calling you fat, she says these things to make her self feel better. Even though she may be skinny and have designer things, I bet she is really insecure inside and the best way to make her self feel better is to make you feel bad. I know it might not make sense but it's true. I would just cut her off. You can make so many other friends and you don't need this girl in your life bringing you down.|`|n3pSWkg0aa	wow i had a friend like that, she was in ALL my classes, always bragging about stuff to me. after a while it got unbelievably annoying and next time she does that give her a wtf stare, say good for you and turn around and talk to someone else and ignore her. and if she calls you fat be like wow stfu ***** slap her and walk away.<br>  <br>  ignoring her worked she doesn't talk to me as much even though i have 2 classes with her now. and doesn't say anything bragging, and when she does im say good, roll my eyes look away and talk to someone else, she'll get the message eventually. and if she said anything about my weight i just said something about her totally fried hair..<br>  <br>  but don't worry about that friend if she notices you dont care she'll shut up eventually|`|gS651gq8aa	hey, sometimes you can't be nice about it...<br>  the nicest you could be about it is to calmly tell her that you don't care and would she please shut up...or just ignore her all together<br>  <br>  on the other hand, you might just have to break it to her the old fashioned way...<br>  <br>  "I don't give a f*** if you're so skinny you disappear, just shut the hell up!"<br>  <br>  besides, dudes don't like super skinny girls anyway<br>  trust me|`|8d8f3108d7ed59766712f20eb0f433deaa	tell her she needs to grow up and stop with wanna be Barbie crap.

vKoa9mQsaa	I think he's starting to like you.  Ok, here's what to do.  WHENEVER you make eye contact, smile at him, invite him to group gigs, and if he ain't gonna make the first move, invite him to, like, someplace casual, like a mall or a cafe.|`|qRKOWgS0aa	Hope these tips help, sounds like he likes you. Good Luck.<br>  <br>  Yes, I know. This sounds cliché, but REALLY; be yourself. If you aren't yourself when getting to know a guy, and you end up going out with him, is it really fair to you that he likes you for who you're not? If that's confusing, just think of how long you're going to have to keep up the act. <br>  Get a new look! It can be as dramatic or subtle as you want; dye your hair pink (this may not attract some groups of guys), or get side bangs or layers, but dont get so caught up on looks. If he's a good person, he'll barely notice. The possibilities are endless, and this is sure to get your guys' attention! <br>  Ask your friends for advice; there is a good chance that some of them have had boyfriends. If not, think about if you have the TIME to have one, and if you are ready. <br>  Don't rush it. Guys are just as shy as girls, and when you reach up to kiss him on the first date, he might be happy, but he also might be a bit nervous and scared. Work your way up the ladder: Hugging', 'Holding hands', First kiss, 'Cuddling', French kissing and making out... you finish the rest. Just make sure that when you reach the end of the ladder, you go back to the basics every once in a while. It gets a bit tiring at the top, over and over again. <br>  Have fun! Relationships aren't supposed to be about stress and being 'tied down'. If you feel this way, consider taking a break from boys!|`|eDP3YU5Laa	He really likes you!<br>  Good Luck!|`|nNYBhelGaa	its really hard not to like someone back when they like you isnt it

8x3e7Gmjaa	i know its hard to understand, your in highschool and youre still young, but one thing that you dont really learn until later is that there are a ton of people in the world, and sometimes, youre just gunna fall in love with someone who doesnt love you back.. love isnt always a 2 way street like people make it out to be, and you can love someone very much, but not get more than friendship back.. and thats just how it is. ive been there, and i know how it feels to give your love to someone who wont ever love you back, and it hurts and its hard to wanna move on and leave them to their life.  but the best thing you can do is confess all your feelings to her, on the condition you wont really speak to her anymore...  because you already know if you tell her how deeply you feel you will feel awkard talking to her again, but you also know if you dont tell her, youll feel like youre gunna explode because you want her to know so badly, (hoping it will change somethin)  so the best thing to do is go out with a bang...  tell her how youve felt, and say but because of her feelings for you you cant talk with her anymore because its too hard...  and leave it at that, it will give you a sense of closure. like you said what you had to say, and distanced yourself from her to help yourself heal from it.  its not an easy thing to do, but try to look outside of it and know that if you loved her youd want her happiness more than anything else, even if its not with you, and tell yourself that until you slowly start feelin emtpy of it...  i know it hurts.  ive done it before..  but its the only way to let go... <br>  <br>  if you got any more questions or wanna talk to someone just add me as a contact and message me... i been down this road before.|`|zK2AhQM5aa	man...<br>  <br>  iv definitely been there. it sucks fo sho, but hey, ur always gonna like this girl, and you just gotta let it go for now, maybe meet some new girls, and realize that shes definitely not the only girl out there. <br>  <br>  ull get through this trust me !|`|1zfwLsQpaa	deutschland, deutschland uber alles in der welt|`|17lkwekHaa	well ur in love, i know how u feel. my bf didn't like me at first, but then we hung out and he started realizing his feelings for me, we fell in love and on Christmas in 2006 he asked me out and we've been together for 2 years and 1 month.<br>  <br>  So talk 2 her, spend time with her (but dont be too forward), and respect her feelings, if u force it on her u will just CHASE HER AWAY! trust me sweetie. <br>  <br>  just go with ur heart, it will always lead u right, and pray 2 god.<br>  <br>  God bless u, and ur hopefully/ prayfully soon to be gf.|`|1WQTxqUmaa	feelings will probably come back once in a while.  just try and keep your head up high.  if you have a good friendship with her, be happy that you have that.  dwell on what you do have, not on what you want.  if is is meant to be, it will work out.  sorry if that isn't much help.  good luck!|`|jZ1g2pahaa	Ask out the 4 hottest TAKEN girls in school and you wont care anymore.<br>  <br>  I did that when the girl i loved shot me down like a flippin plane in WW2.<br>  <br>  I stopped loving her and now we are still great friends. (And she totally has a crush on me lol)<br>  <br>  IDK why it worked lol it just did.|`|8USyeYX6aa	you should reli tell her how you feel and tell her why but dont be like stalker about it.|`|qxs0VPXmaa	act yourself.|`|2545a1a8d5f0a0f14de8e407f7c80f7caa	"Chris Brown, damn right, I beat a *****"<br>  <br>  **** dude this one kinda has me stumped, you could sit down with her and tell her your feelings towards her, maybe she likes you once again. Maybe you could continue to be the sweet guy you are around her and maybe she'll realize one day you were the one for her all along. For me, that only happens in movies, **** dude Im still in love with my ex from 2 years ago, so how you think I feel, and she got a man, havent talked to her in over a year. It really does suck when someone doesnt love you but you love them, its like theres no gettin over it, and you have no control and don't know what else to do. But what I do, to keep my head up...you know how it is when you see a really hott girl or another girl you could see liking, the girl you loved for all that time or another girl you like kinda fades away from all the excitement from that new girl, so I try to tell myself theres gotta be a girl out there for me. Heres another trick, if you really wanted to get over her, pick her apart, but only pick out the things you hate about her, theres gotta be something she does that irritates the hell out of you, so then when you meet someone new, maybe that new girl wont have that bad quality that got on your nerves. <br>  <br>  Oh yea and a little advice, posting her picture up might not be a great idea, if she herself on here shes probably gonna get really pissed off at you, but if its her pics, and she found this posting, well you still could be in hott water, but thats just my opinion. hope this kinda helps you out|`|JjCqTCeXaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  I know how you feel. In fact, I went through the same thing! When I was reading your problem I was like, oh my gosh, that's what happened to me! The only difference is I'm a girl, and the guy who rejected me's a guy. But it's the same.<br>  <br>  I'm still in love with the guy that rejected me, too! And I know how it feels when you can't get over them, even though they've hurt you so much. I still cry about him sometimes.<br>  <br>  But that's just the way humans are- we always want what we can't have. She can't be that great, now can she? I'm sure there're plenty of lovely girls just waiting for you out there. You just have to put her out of your mind and think anew. I believe we all go through the same thing- we fall in love and think they're the one, but find ourselves rejected- but it's an experience that teaches us to move on and forget the past and get on with our lives. That's why the present's called the present!<br>  <br>  So don't worry about her- just give yourelf time, and before you know it, she'll be out of your system! Good luck!|`|tqC2LCkoaa	Okay i know exactly what that is like i am in high school and im a girl so i can come from her perspective you too have been friends for so long she has got the idea that your just friends im going to give you true advice be a jackass. im dead serious i know that sounds so crazy i dont know what type of girl she is but girls respond to changed in attitude change in friends and looks thats just how we are. you were really never over her its the fact that since you too are friends you can talk anytime so it doesnt matter thats why it  didnt bother you. your emotions probably finally caved in and your back to point a i know it sounds really hard but your going to have to block her out becuase thats when she will crawl back to you for attention and when she does that still ignore her then SLOWLY talk to her short though heys whats up's you know little stuff. after that she will notice the change. you wanting her so bad is turning her off. so just block her out. pretty much it speaks for itself.|`|zvD43AbXaa	hahaha<br>  that is funny<br>  alright listen<br>  when you fall in love, you fall in love, meaning there is no turning back, and there is no such thing as moving on or getting over someone<br>  love never dies,<br>  love lasts forever, and it never fails and never gives up<br>  you never stop loving the one you love<br>  so what you need to do is go up to her and tell her you love her, and tell her how much she means to you, tell her how much you think about her, tell her how beautiful and wonderful you think she is<br>  and she will be so flattered, and she will have to love a beautiful person like you :)|`|qgaylT4raa	You love her but she doesn't love you. You can't just go through high school feeling miserable because the girl you "love" doesn't love you back. Try looking for other girls you find attractive and you might be surprised at who likes you back. Maybe one day she'll find out that she loves you back but don't trip out.|`|Uwb97wCnaa	Tell her exactly how you feel, even if it freaks her out. If you don't, you'll always wonder what would have happened if you had. If you do, and everything goes well, then you'll be happy. You've got nothing to lose.|`|6e0ccddd541e8852720e3fd8ada7d15caa	haha i can relate <br>  i'm in high school same thing happened.<br>  Mysteries of girls that boys can never understand haha.<br>  Try and work a miracle and if you do tell me what you did|`|QntLVyJQaa	It seems she is very clear. But is she sending your messages that her feelings have changed?<br>  <br>  Perharps you should try hanging out w/ different girls because than u wont be so fixated on her.|`|4fBXhYqSaa	Oops! You don't have permission to view this photo<br>  well i don't
3MmVWDT3aa	I totally understand the problem. I am 13 too and haven't had my first kiss either. I keep thinking to myself "This is my life, I want to have at least have had my first kiss by 14." I want to be able to grow up then tell my kids one day about my first kiss (I know weird right?). But I know about all the drama at school, who kissed who, yackety yack yack. But really it's ok to not have your first kiss yet. You want it to be with that magical guy right? You'll get it soon. Trust me.<br>  <br>  -Olivia<333|`|d97328305dbf70df85d7603032b0e440aa	Its perfectly normal. wait until the time is right and its a decent guy. My first mouth to mouth kiss wasn't until I was 15. Don't rush it, you have plenty of more time ahead of you. :-)|`|Ad4D3mLEaa	yes, i had mine when i was 15!<br>  and you might just need to mature a little more, or the guys might haha, you'll have a good relationship eventually :]|`|ZZ1Q4zrIaa	you shouldn't be worrying about getting your first kiss if your 13. Calm down! Wait till your like 16,17. why worry about such a stupid thing like that. I'm 14 and haven't had a kiss or a gf. Don't worry about it.|`|467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	you're 13.<br>  you shouldn't have had "many boyfriends".<br>  you'll start keeping them when you're ready.<br>  and yes, it's fine that you haven't kissed a boy.|`|F0NfKljZaa	just ne yourself around them and then see how it goes from there.|`|QgCqvtTQaa	you just havent found one that deserves to be your first yet.|`|dSOfuO3Laa	You've just got to find the right one.|`|AQWX3Ue7aa	I had my first kiss at 12 playing 7 mins in heaven at a party but TRUST me it gets so better as u get older and u actually have a strong relationship with a guy.

I've had chances but I just never wanted to waste it.<br>  <br>  I'm probably making a big deal out of it, but I'm probably going to remember it for the rest of my life, so I want it to be something that I chose and was ready for, not just because everyone else is doing it.<br>  <br>  We're only in our early teens. Let's enjoy it. We have a lifetime to do that|`|tLyfneelaa	yes im 13 and iv never kissed a guy your first kiss should be memorable and you should remember it forever don't rush into it and as for keeping a bf at 13 wow i don't even think you should have bf at 13 but who cares about me lol well if things don't work out don't assume its something you did it might just be the guy isn't right|`|YeR6R8Feaa	yea, i didnt have my first kiss until i was 16. as for bf's , i was like you and had lots of boyfriends but they never lasted. once you meet the right guy, things will work out.  relationships dont always last forever, but its more fun to experience being with different guys (not in a slutty way)|`|6vkKjwLwaa	it is normal to be 13 and never been kissed i no people that are 17 and havent been kissed. <br>  n keeping a bf is kinda difficult. u cant be clingy but not to unclingy... its a lot of work and figuring out what he wants but remembering its not always about him.|`|NiO0qTEzaa	I'm nearing 15 and I've never been kissed. It just depends on the person you're with, I guess.<br>  <br>  And to keep relationships ... you really have to get along with the person so they don't drive you crazy. You're still young though. The right person will come along eventually :]|`|mqVO95iYaa	im 13, just just had my first kiss. It'll come naturally. I know heaps of people who haven't even had boyfriends yet so don't worry|`|zOrizG35aa	Just got mine like a month ago.<br>  And yes it is normal.|`|BURVqkrNaa	It's ok.

Its fine. I promise.|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	Just wait till you are older and more mature, then you will know exactly what to do! Its totally normal not to have kissed a boy at your age, you will like it so much more when you are like 15 or 16!|`|GR2XNzCCaa	Yes it is normal not to have been kissed. My first kiss was when I was 15. And on keeping a boyfriend, find one at your maturity level and take it slow. Also, be yourself around your guy.|`|OtU6z4OFaa	Yes I'm 14 never had a kiss or bf <br>  <br>  Plz help me <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqXd85RzvJiCsW.pUtATt3bsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220174533AABQLXC">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|AA11447210	It's fine...save that for when you're dating age (16). No reason to start racing into adult behaviors...finish being a kid first.|`|i2NqmsBeaa	Im 16 and never had a kiss! Dont worry about it!
rVdcXJ8aaa	he is sooo cute!!|`|i3gdSmoEaa	its not about "lookign cute together", that just happens to be a plus. its about personalities clicking. and if neither of these is you and you dont have permission, you could get sued for up to 1.3 million bucks.|`|S6fzJHPeaa	d girl is a stunner she looks 2 good 4 him|`|ZJg26cAmaa	guy looks like he is 12....|`|CBa9G4j4aa	She looks better then him! lol.|`|a5b774126a207d8d38e9c6854bb56b66aa	yeah i think so|`|877c11ba0aaa509142a50e675e9f83c6aa	If you're the girl, you're way too pretty for him.|`|Fyt8uQexaa	girl looks too cute for him but guy looks like a funny/fun person.|`|TAMGy07Daa	All younge couples look cute together. :3|`|TSyOI185aa	they both look cute together but i like the first girl with him : )
hSOYndoxaa	I would say a young man. My boyfriend is 21 and he's AMAZING if you know what I mean =)|`|IFGzOomWaa	Well seeing as most people loose they're virginity so young these days around the age of 20-25 is when they're quiet experienced. ive met some guys who are 20-25 and they're SOOOO immature and only care about themselves when it comes to s(e)x and real life. However I have met some really decent 20-25 year olds that do care about plesuring the opposite sex, making them feel comfortable and ect...<br>  <br>  <br>  to sum it up, it depends on the guy... everyones different & everyones experience is different.
RbBbNh0Maa	I don't know, but I have been with my boyfriend for 8 years and I moved in with him when we had only been going out for 2 weeks. We now have 2 children and are in love. Of course he has changed and I have changed but It is definately all good.|`|MTkXXOsjaa	Well, I could be a freakin' psycho who likes to brutally murder people but not before slowly torturing them until they're seconds away from death but I can also certainly wait a week to get somebody into my house.<br>  <br>  In other words, do yourself a favor and seriously get to know the person and yes, you're moving waaaay too fast.|`|4m6WwWEEaa	Yes its moving too fast<br>  have dates<br>  be together for over 2 months<br>  then move in<br>  be safe for the sake of yourself and your children|`|V6MdE2mDaa	Awesome!|`|8P64hgL3aa	Only one week? you must be kidding me. Definitly not. At least give it 6 months and see how things go. You can never trust people after a week. Do you even know what his past was like? 21 unmarried and having a child doesn't sound that trusting to me.|`|GJlEpxqeaa	NO!|`|AxGFz6qQaa	If you have a child, you owe it to them to wait.|`|cspcpTkBaa	i think u should wait a few months 2 get 2 kno him, then consider it. u just met him not 2 long ago and he could b acting like this just to get into your apartment, or your pants, or maybe even 2 hurt you or your family. im not judging him or you or anything, im just saying i think its a little for him to move in. i do think yall are moving a little 2 fast.
dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	There is no right answer for this one. I think most of it depends on him finding the right woman. The right woman can focus a man's energies and even shift his priorities. Generally speaking most men are pretty useless as a husband until they are around 28 years old or so. I read questions here and it seems most men under 25 are more obsessed with their video games than they are their girlfriends, wives, or fiances.<br>  <br>  I know in my case I did not marry until I was 30 and I was more than ready... I had seen enough ball games, lived and died with sporting teams... I had toys, gadgets, TVS... I had the bench press in my living room... I was ready to be more for someone than the lovable goof that I was.<br>  <br>  These things certainly help a man commit.<br>  <br>  - The right woman<br>  - Emotional and Fiscal security<br>  - Playing the field a bit , sowing some oats<br>  - The need for something more<br>  - Desire to have a family<br>  - Loneliness|`|9bdEPcWIaa	That's a tough question, I think it's different for everyone.|`|onbwN4csaa	They have searched the world over.<br>  And found what they were looking for.<br>  That true gem.|`|zPOO2vHBaa	when they find someone that they want to spend the rest of their lives with. and mean it.|`|ml2FDYECaa	You are never really ready before you have a career as when you get older your ideas change, and you have to grow with the one that you are with. I was ready as I fell in love with my wife, and I made a commitment. Ten years later 'we own our house, she has a career, I make movies, and we finally have a child. Now to answer your question:<br>  <br>  When you are ready to commit through thick, and thin then you are ready. But what I really want to say is that marriage is a lot of hard work...it is a lot of work, which makes it worth it when you can communicate...GL|`|JkcqNPvGaa	When they reach that point on their own. If you love someone and they say they love you, and you've got to know each other well and are used to each other, Well shouldnt they be willing if its real? Why would someone dilly dally if they thought they wanted you for the rest of their life? If they never wanted to commit to marriage then I guess its really that they wont commit to you. But like I said, they have to do it on their own accord, because they love you and you know eachother really well.|`|WhYTUzMuaa	when you meet someone who you think is just right for you and you are not ready to weight anymore to be his or her.When you want to give everything yours to that person ,when you start feeling that person's sorrows and joys,when u r ready for long commitment without any expectations.when your inner urge will force you to marry and to be his or her forever.|`|0ce618e63791d8565b35858c7ee73724aa	when they can picture waking up to them every morning.<br>  when they want to be with each other practically all the time.<br>  when they can sacrafice things for each other (espically time) <br>  and most of all when they give all of their hearts to each other and<br>   cant picture their lives without one another.|`|XJ2BW5p7aa	Different for everyone in my opinion. But generally the time is right when they get everything non marriage related out of their system.|`|QPVEL0NLaa	when they have given up completely on life and pray for the quiet comfort of death to arrive|`|mwdwDOaWaa	maturity and financial stability.|`|NvrVjOhBaa	The right person.|`|uR4EDZElaa	You should want to marry someone that has things in common with you, someone u know  could spend the rest of ur life with, someone that u really care about,, just make sure  marry for the right reasons|`|OYYYNCyCaa	are men ever ready<br>  <br>  for the women i am not a mind reader|`|IvMPh09baa	uh.. i would think when they have found someone that wants to marry them.
nNYBhelGaa	ok so i think you should just say to her, can you trust me for just one second and then hold her hands and kiss her and move slow and proceed with the frenching! you are vary sweet for waiting this long im trying to find a guy like you|`|3ISGQ4Csaa	Don't ask, it's always weird when you ask. Just ease into it. Start off as a small kiss, and then as you get going and the feeling gets stronger, incorporate the tongue into it. Don't just stick your tongue in her mouth. A guy did that to me a year ago, and i still throw up in my mouth a little bit everytime i think about it. His tongue was all slimy and gross and he got spit all over the place b/c i wasn't ready for it. GROSS!|`|dpRrSCbmaa	ask her if she's nervous, and if she is, give her just a little nudge, she'll be fine. i mean dont make her if she like REALLY doesnt want to, but i think she'll thank you for pushing her a little bit|`|4yVHE0hLaa	u don't ask it french kiss, that's lame. and just go with the flow, when it happens it happens|`|LYnK4xb0aa	you don't just ask ,,you work it in slowly ,,use the tip of your tongue suck on her lip ,,tease her and teach her
GAnCdatkaa	Maybe your moving to fast for her or she doesn't want <br>  to put on a show for the kiddies/grown folks!!<br>  Pump your brakes!!Let her decide when she wants to go public!!<br>  Keep it soft and sweet, not x-rated!!! Girls love a sensitive guy(just don't go gay with the sweetness!)!!|`|4IHe4rPYaa	she just doesn't like it. don't push it do it at other times.|`|rgQ2zUkxaa	maybes she doesnt like public display of affection dawg
MSnROh2Baa	I wish you had an answer here. ):<br>  I'm in the same problem. I've been chasing this guy who is like known and loved by everyone, and I constantly see him staring back at me, whenever my eyes glance at him, or if I see him looking at me at the corner of my eyes. Ugh. Plus, it's even harder to forget about it when he and I are now in the same c-walking crew. -.- Just perfect, huh? And it's so much harder since he's always trying to make me laugh since he's my dancing tutor (it's like I have 2 left feet), & he always teases me about it, but in the sweet, silly way. I bet you're in the same position, am I?<br>  <br>  Well, I'm not going to suggest you asking him out, because we're in the same peril situation, and like you, I wouldn't want to embarrass myself if he didn't. All I would consider, which I too am trying, is to become really good friends with him, and don't be shy. Try breaking that barrier.<br>  <br>  If you want to show you like him, be a bit flirty, and talk to him more. That's what I did to the guy I am absolutely crazy about, and he said, "Are you flirting with me?" And turns out it was a joke, and then my face totally fell. Try making him laugh, and talk to him more often, Most likely if he always tries talking to you, stares at you, and gives like teases that are friendly, but a hint of flirt, you can tell he likes you.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped, and let me know how it goes. (:
zCE0slQ5aa	kissing on the forehead can have two distinct meanings...<br>  1. In a relationship the personification is deep caring and respect.<br>  2. Outside a relationship it can represent a desire for 'friendship only'.|`|a1iam8Zvaa	i think maybe he likes it<br>  kissing on the forehead is like a really nice kiss<br>  its like saying<br>  i really really like you<br>  =]|`|CBa9G4j4aa	It means he cares. A lot. Like it's more then just about sex or looks.|`|12e75a555c004c5de28d82c984f31313aa	I think a forehead kiss is an endearment.  It is a nurturing thing.  I bet he liked it, because he commented on it.  A forehead kiss says you aren't expecting anything in return - you are simply giving.|`|0VLirxVtaa	I think it's sweet, but personally I would have went for the lips first. My boyfriend likes when I kiss him on the cheek, but I have never tried the forehead. Next time you get the chance, go for the lips.|`|3KAiV9zTaa	i love it myself. i'm a girl by the way. my boyfriend likes it too for somebody like himself. yeah it counts for something.|`|5db88cbaf3527eb6e504255901eb58cfaa	It is "sweet" and shows affection.|`|1rn6uxIWaa	I think kissing someone on the forehead shows more respect for the person, and is sweeter and means more than a kiss on the lips.
Ff7mCzlPaa	some things are private.  i have no idea why you'd make a public announcement about your period?  do you?
iLQojxY1aa	tell them to go f*ck themselves....haha<br>  and if he ever says hi, respond by saying "eat sh!t" lmao|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	Karma has a way of making all things better. <br>  Here's my story:<br>  My ex who cheated on me during our entire relationship, rushed into marriage with another girl (who looked like an uglier version of me) that he got pregnant.  <br>  <br>  She proceeded to cheat on him during their 6 month marriage with 6 different guys, and then when they divorced, convinced the judge to give her sole custody.  He doesn't get to see his kid, got an STD, and is lonely as hell.  He lives with his mom because child support eats up his paycheck. <br>  <br>  I meanwhile am happy, in love, and financially stable and on my own.  All things have a way of working out.  Remember that whenever god closes a door, he leaves a window open.  Look at the window of opportunity and jump through it.  It's always better.|`|TBjIJnWvaa	What did the cannibal do after he dumped his girlfriend? He wiped his ***?<br>  <br>  A hunter was walking through the jungle and comes a cross a beautiful naked woman sprawled with a seductive look in her eye. the hunter asks "are you game?" She replied softly "Yes... i am" with a wink... So he shoots her.<br>  <br>  Did you hear about the blonde who got fired from the banana factory? She kept throwing out all the bent ones.<br>  <br>  How do you make a handkerchief dance? Put a little boogie in it.|`|hCRxXDFgaa	Karma is a *****.  Don't worry, she will probably end up getting pregnant and he'll get an STD|`|3df62cd5d4c4550eefa351b54399e098aa	Then you shouldn't have any problems finding a new boyfriend.  Just remember why she is an ex too.   Many of my friends have seen their ex's with their new women and say the same thing about them not being as pretty.  Maybe the men want to be the better looking of the two.  What an ego boost for them to be the ones turning heads.  My guess is that she will the one feeling inadequate at some time in the near future.|`|6pk6HnuSaa	want maybe I should rough them up a bit  for ya?<br>  teach them what it means to mess w the Y!A family?<br>  ?<br>  regardless-  hes like so yesterday now, why let it bother you?<br>  smile with the awareness of how much he is missing and how little you are missing|`|gfksposqaa	It's tough, you just have to stay positive; the only way I have found to get over someone is to find someone else, but if you try too hard to find someone else, it won't work, so you're kindof stuck in a catch 22 for a while.
9QF6GGyiaa	Ask one of your friends from your previous school. Or if you've made friends at your new school than ask if they're dates have any friends who would want to go.|`|Ddfff5psaa	I always dreamed of having my prom with a date also, but it didn't happen that way last year, and you know what it was way more fun, I danced with my friends.  I went home afterward ALONE and not to a hotel party to have sex.  I was happy with the way it turned out. I think you will have muchhhhh more fun alone!  Plus you can get whatever color of dress you want without worring about matching some guys tux.  Also you can dance with whoever you want! And do whatever YOU want without worrying about what your date is thinking and if he is having fun.  It's just way better trust me =)

AA11108018	Sounds like he likes you.  There are people who shy and afraid to start a convo because they feel what they to say is not important.  Four months is not much to really get to know  someone.  If he treats you good no yelling slapping or anything disrespectfully what could ask for|`|k9IFYBDQaa	it sounds to me he has the quiet personality of an INTP. being an INTP my self i can say that i dont like to talk much, but i do a ton of thinking and feeling i just dont know how to express it. here is a section from the website below that might explain some things <br>  <br>  "For the INTP, love has three distinct phases: falling in, staying in, and getting out. These phases relate to their thinking preference and its need for order and sequence.<br>  <br>  An INTP characterized falling in love as a stage of complete loss of rationality that may last a year or less. When an INTP falls in love, he or she falls hard - an all or nothing phenomenon. At this stage, INTPs are likely to be very lively, almost giddy, in their new love. The experience rushes over them and carries them along. They do not structure or control it but simply enjoy and experience it. They do many loving things and they are curious about their loved one and are able to overlook his or her flaws. They may bravely ignore the realities of distance, weather, and time to be with the loved one. <br>  <br>  As relationships progress to the staying-in-love phase, INTPs begin to evaluate their structure and form. They may withdraw at this point because they are moving toward their more customary inward style. Outward demonstrations of affection lessen, and the giddy state changes. Interactions are more matter of fact, perhaps even impersonal. INTPs take their commitments to their partner seriously; however, they may not discuss these commitments at any length with their partner or with other people, because their commitments seem so obvious to them.<br>  <br>  Falling out of love, which may not always occur, results from an analysis of the real expectations and needs of the relationship. Often an undefined line is crossed that neither partner knows about ahead of time. However, the INTP knows after the line has been crossed, and then the relationship deteriorates or ends. If INTPs recognize their emotions and needs as valid, they are able to sever relationship ties fairly cleanly. However, if they misjudge their own needs and those of their partner, the breakup can be messy, perhaps affecting other aspects of their lives for a long time. If the INTP shares some common interests with the former loved one, the relationship continues but on a different level. When INTPs have a reason to continue relationships, they do."<br>  <br>  i hope this helps and it might be fun to have him take a personality test to see if i am right.

JlDcVTVsaa	She probably waited a long time, and now thinks that you are not interested, so she is trying to move on.|`|8wi2X5sSaa	maybe she has given up on you. like u said, u didnt pay much attention to her and that has caused her to assume that ur not interested in her. but dont worry, maybe she's still interested u if u initiate a convo with her. talk to her like ur talking to a friend and get to know her like u said because its not too late. (unless she has a boyfriend?) good luck!
EIY722Hwaa	Sounds like she was bating you. She's pretty smart if you think about it. She's making you chase her. If you really like her, well then try talking to her again.

They've got lots of endurance, and regulate the speed from slow to extremely fast. They can please the girl any way she likes. Firm and stable men.|`|H7hHCHRkaa	I think it depends more on whether or not your partner thinks more about you than themselves.

It’s all about confidence. I felt exactly the same as you when I was in high school, and even past it, but then I finally found a reason to be happy with myself and I stopped caring what others thought.  Once I discovered that in myself, I was able to find my true happiness.

Then after I cried and talked to that teacher, I talked to my self and everything was fine. <br>  <br>  I know it seems hard, but we all goes through these things. But what helps sometimes is crying about it, or recording in a journal or diary, and then wait a few days or weeks, until the feeling comes back, read the page and reflect. That always works, and for me, I take it to school and I read it, also laugh at it because it was so long ago. <br>  Don't worry too much. :D You can find a lot of things to laugh about when you believe it would happen and if it happens you'll be laughing.<br>  Hope this helps.

NTC6g8hYaa	Talk to his foster family. Tell them how he feels and stuff like that. Yes it's a hard time because of the economy but if they really loved him, then they would adopt him. Also keep being there for him and comfort him during hard times. Losing your parents is a big deal and having that happen at a young age is hard because you have to live the rest of your life not knowing what your parents would have been like.

Its a good sign that he is calling you and being forthcoming. But best advice is let him do the chasing. Make him earn you. Don't be too easy. Let him have a bit of a chase. Guys like challenges. Don't make him feel to jealous though, a bit can be a good thing. Its also not good to get into mind games either. So let him make the moves and show a bit of interest at the right times too.|`|UdKxWkAnaa	Interesting issue,<br>  <br>  its not mixed signals, to be practically honest he is setting you up for a booty call, when he said did not do relationships he is looking for no strings the signal is clear he wants it without the relationship, so my main piece of advice is clear its your choice if you want what he is offering then accept it will never go any further thank no strings, but if you are looking for commitment then no don't even go there.|`|Pc9gRdseaa	Right, when you're meeting him what's happening? If he is ringing you to meet so that he can just gain something from it such as a ******** then get out of it now! It sounds like he is saying jump and you are saying how high - don't take that offensively i'm just trying to be honest rather than sugar coating the truth!

IcMpejbUaa	maybe you should ask your friends and his friends (including you and him) on a group date. well tell your friends that you like him first so that they wouldnt get all interested in him. then during the date, you guys could talk and find interests. he might just be shy so just do the first move, or you could wait and he would the move first. well good luck :]|`|5uzHW4CYaa	Find mutual friends.

I was heels over head for this guy-and I asked my FRIEND to ask him if he like me-bad idea.  He thought that I was asking him out, so I got turned down in front of all of his friends...it sucked (but he called me pretty so I guess it could have gone worse...) ANYWAY...<br>  <br>  Sometimes guys can give you the wrong impression.  Just because a guy ogles and talks to you doesn't mean he's interested.  And just because a guy shows a lot of interest doesn't mean he's ready to commit to you.  You need to give the relationship time.  Let your friendship work it's way up-then see where you go from there.  That's how I got my first boyfriend.  Actually, I got his number (from a friend of mine...he doesn't need to know how sadly obsessed I was with talking to him) and I called him up.  Soon, we started talking every night...for hours at a time...and we learned how to respect one another.  He started to grow more confident around me-as did I around him...and my parents even started to trust him more and let me hang out with him and his and my friends (I was 13 at the time).  That being said-time is key.  Friendship is key.  Do with that as you may (: Good luck.|`|o6gmUS67aa	Every single guy is different.  The signs aren't really something you can say every guy gives.  The best thing to do is find someone you're friends with who can either ask the guy or ask his best friend.  When you know if he does or not, then you can either pursue him or go find someone else!|`|ArKT9O7Maa	The simplest, most surefire way to know?<br>  Ask him.<br>  Then tell him you like him.

Cpp1LddVaa	IMHO, the secret of succes on a first date is that you are DOING something (besides the obvious!) so that both parties are living in the immediate present and not stagnating over awkward "interview" questions and premature "how far can we go" episodes.<br>  <br>  It's best to learn about things your date is interested in, plan some kind of activity visit around that.  Whenever you take a break, get refreshments or whatever, encourage your date to talk and then let them ramble on.  You'll learn a lot about them and they'll like you better for listening.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes.
hKss8M9Raa	Does he know who you are? If you've never talked to him and your prom is in a few weeks you are going to have to be the one to talk to him first. I was the one who broke the ice with me and my fiance. Similar situation. We knew who each other were but had never talked much and only had one class together in college. I had started to notice how cute he was so whenever I saw him I started smiling or saying hello which eventually became small talk. In our class he saw that I had made a study sheet for our test and asked if he could see it. I offered to e-mail him the next one I made (e-mail contact without being weird). Then I added him as a friend on Facebook (an invaluable tool when starting a new relationship) and we chatted on there. I also was the first one to invite him somewhere. I asked him AND HIS FRIEND (important for not being too weird) if they wanted to come to something and they invited me out to eat afterward. My fiance pretty much got the hint and took it from there. I had to discreetly make him notice me though!|`|iaAOVZbFaa	Go up to him and ask a random question. Then say "Cool, thanks." And ask a question about himself after. Just try to start chatting. You can do it!<br>  <br>  Mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnR8Bgh977uTJwxTzzOylTbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220195253AAYgN5l">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|MilWQufkaa	the ice breaker is the toughest thing. If he's in any of your classes, or takes any similar subjects to you, you can ask him something like has he studied for an oncoming exam yet, how he's coping, about an assignment, etc etc. <br>  <br>  Or you can be direct.<br>  <br>  "Hey ____. Um, was just wondering, do you have a prom date yet? Wanna go with me? Cool, um, So i'll grab your number and i'll give you a call sometime?"<br>  <br>  Its probably a good idea to get their number instead of giving yours out. Giving out your number means they dont have to call you. I know from exp. Get theirs, then you're in control. Good luck =]
8YfYh3y0aa	Yes, that could be difficult.  Could you call him when he's at home?  Make some small talk about school and then tell him that you have to go unexpectedly (like to clean up cat barf or something).     Ask him if it would be possible for him to call you at the same time tomorrow evening (or whatever).   If he calls back, you are in.   If he doesn't, at least you have something to ask him next time you see him.   <br>  <br>  I think that you can pull it off, if you keep cool.
oVKPxClQaa	Try this, don't ask him, and don't talk to him. <br>  <br>  How do you think that'll work?  yea... I'd just go with the asking him and talking to him.|`|R0U4qy6haa	then just ask him if he knows if you are going to need tickets for this trip-use that for your ice-breaker
XsXokO9paa	Maybe the clue lies in your answer. You write that you are "funny, outgoing, awesome to be around". Maybe you are but writing it like that makes you sound a tad conceited. That could be the thing that is letting you down, rather than try to be so outgoing, just be yourself.<br>  <br>  It depends what you want from a guy too, I doubt that you are after a manwhore. So look for a nice man who you really like and just be kind to him, rather than trying to get any guy, go for one in particular. But NEver ask him out. If a girl likes a boy she should seduce him in a way, make him want to be with her, so that he will be a man and ask her.|`|QHASqNDtaa	Because they don't have to work for them. They don't have to be committed to just that girl for a long time.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	Because at that age they are sex-crazed and will take it wherever they can get it.|`|lOGHxtoUaa	because they are more likely to get lucky...hey don't act like them ok <br>  <br>  i am sure a guy likes you.|`|9dc7211c44c17097c672d814b9900b0faa	the sluts are easy.|`|deg9d50faa	they wanna have intercorse with them|`|Hj5NFqIQaa	to get sex without working too hard.|`|e2e8e03326f17e0af0fd766ade6233f9aa	Because their hormones are telling them to mate.  Thats about it really.  Remember humans are just evolved animals.  Thousands of years ago we only lived to about 28 max, therefore at 15 we were ready to boink every girl/woman we saw, because it was a genetic and biological imperative. The urge is still there at that age, but we like to try to pretend it isn't for societal reasons.|`|8cOstTBoaa	Becuz those girls are the most easy way they can GET SOME!!!!! Obviously......just wait for the rite guy, or find one, one that duznt go for the sluts. Trust me, he'll come along soon enough. And as for those guys, they are just looking for some easy action. And thats allllll there is to it.
F3LBgfvwaa	It totally depends on your values and boundaries. People don't all have the same idea of what is "okay." At 16, you really don't KNOW that you are going to marry this guy. You are still changing very quickly at that age and could grow apart or change your mind. My advice is this: think long and hard about it, and don't do it if you think you might regret it. And always use a condom.|`|LDe9yzCKaa	I dont think a 16yr old girl would even know what true live really is... love for teens = infatuation. and if you think that this person is the right guy for u... then he should not have a problem waiting. once you have sex.. u cant go back so just think twice b4 u take any step forward.|`|hGWhzfFqaa	First off, you shouldn't ask strangers if you're ready to have sex it's not for them to decide, that's completely your choice.<br>  <br>  Secondly, if you're in love with him (even if you're not going to marry him) you should have sex with him if you're ready.|`|d6cbd4f49a6660cc733a0b7ea8151199aa	Let me re-write your question in my answer:<br>  <br>  You don't know crap because you are not going to marry this guy, that is a fact, you are just wanting to have sex because you are young and no, it's not okay! <br>  <br>  Hows that.|`|zHJufZTcaa	At a young age YOU DON"T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS!!!!!

AA10048903	I think it depends mainly on what your used to, constantly see, or are brought up around.  When I was very young, I preferred blonds, because that's what I saw most of the time on TV and at school. I also like thicker girls cause they seemed to have more of the equipment in all the right places.<br>  As I got older and started to become more involved in exercise and the gym, my preference went towards thinner muscular girls.<br>  A few years back I dated a black girl, almost purely on a whim, I fell in love with her, but unfortunately broke up with her.  Now my preference has changed towards woman with darker features and hair.<br>  YES, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and can change depending on factors around you.|`|qy07K2k5aa	I certainly believe that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. That's the way it is.|`|p0mCoRyMaa	me me me! ofcourse its true, its what makes us attracted to the people we are attracted too.|`|tudgm0S1aa	i agree, i have met unattracted men, where after getting to know them, we had a connection, then after time i feel so deep in love that the person became the most attracted person i;ve ever met, of course only in my eyes... its wired how its happens.. but outer beauty means nothing|`|QpRihtQ6aa	i def agree with that!!<br>  i am  pretty with lotsa freckles and im skinny with curves and ive heard  soo many good and bad things about wat i look like.<br>   beauty is def. in the eye of the beholderr.|`|TAMGy07Daa	Its a true statement, all it means is that - Everyone has their own opinion on who is and who isn't more beautiful.|`|cflktD34aa	definately. and apparently people of similar attractiveness often get together.

I have to compliment my man almost everyday or else he gets deflated.|`|4c770e93cae766d4352b51d99611c9c6aa	Yes, but I think they like them more from the opposite sex or the sex that they prefer to be with to be honest with you.|`|ub6SPfpuaa	no ...its def a gurl thing...guys like them...but dont do it too much...it can get unattractive...just be honest...if he looks good that day than say so...not just things out of no where
zCE0slQ5aa	this is a dogmatic question. according to scriptures interpretation and most religions the answer is yes.<br>  ok, enough of that. now, lets be practicle and realistic. what are the physical and emotional consequences to you? what are the physical and emotional consequences to your partner? if neither of you suffer as a result of the consentual act, than really,...what is the harm?<br>  Be forewarned, this is the 3rd of 5 most intimate acts a person can share with another. the emotional results can be unpredictable and sometimes catastrophic to one or both of the persons involved if both are not on the same wavelength regarding eachothers feelings. Take ultimate care!|`|o6xLWwZvaa	no<br>  <br>  People do it all the time. Have sex without dating.|`|AA11447210	Not at all, as long as the parties are adults, responsible, safe, and available (not cheating).|`|03cLY4H8aa	Personally, i think it is wrong. But some people didn't give it a second thought. All they care is to have it and be done with it without even thinking of the consequences later on. Anyways, the choice is still yours to decide. Good luck.|`|1FitXo3gaa	Yeah<br>  in the bible it says not to<br>  lie with a man before marriage<br>  but hay every one else does<br>  so make sure its with someone you truly <br>  love|`|2dPqad7Eaa	Yeah I do I think it's wrong.|`|EKM9AKc2aa	what do u think ?|`|BptkAyrNaa	No. Having sex outside of marriage (or a relationship) is one's choice. Granted, some religious organizations imply, if not express, that fornication is a sin and that chastity is sacred, leaving some misguided people into believing that. It is only wrong when people perform sex on children, or use sex to cheat, rape, or otherwise abuse or manipulate themselves. <br>  <br>  To be honest, I think the whole abstinence thing is a trick women play on naive "nice guys". No "jerk" or "bad boy" would ever go for this. <br>  <br>  I even mention in another answer situations where premarital abstinence can damage a relationship. Now, if you are in a relationship, and you and your partner mutually agree to abstain until you marry each other, then there is nothing wrong with that; again, it is a choice.|`|4QpAAQnhaa	well alot of people say yes,but the truth is that once it happens ,it just happens! i tried to do that,but i fell in love.i dont thnk that its wrong,but i do think that its wrong for people to make other believe that it is ...you only have 1 life,just make sure that you do it with the person who loves you,and cherishes you! you also have to be in love,if notyour going to regret it ..bad !|`|jQXza1aSaa	It isn't even a little bit wrong unless you view it as wrong.

3y0w1qIBaa	Coming from a guy's perspective, I think he was very shy and wanted to make the first move, but cannot.  When you see him next time, approach up to him and introduce yourself.  I bet it will brighten his day or night.  Life is all about taking risks.  I wouldn't say that he likes you, but more like checking you out.  Hope it helps you.|`|Tw0Ci97Yaa	he likes you don worry about it. ask him out.|`|GkZbeUVdaa	aww thats sweet.im kind of in the same situation you're in.i like an 8th grader but im in 7th grade.except he plays violin and i play cello...

3jOG5V5caa	just hang out with him and there are ways you can show you like him.  You can start by just smiling and talking to him even flirt.  If he likes you to he'll probably do the same and may try to spen more time with you.|`|cqOOKv3Jaa	omg...just be yourself like you have been, and let him know how you feel. if youve know him for three years now and can't read his signs its time for you to be verbal|`|qL3dGTXDaa	Ask him if you can hang your jacket in his locker as your is cramped. This will start little sparks which will eventually erupt into a hot towering inferno.|`|vjfdhhSDaa	Tell him you like him ! You miss 100% of the shots not taken.
1UDLn1Boaa	You're not wrong.  Those are your standards so your friend can't really say anything about it.|`|VgiUGqxtaa	Loool..<br>  <br>  Babez, its Two Double O Nine.<br>  <br>  Chivalry died a loooooooooooooong time ago, died with the jeri curls..<br>  <br>  Specially with the state of the economy..<br>  <br>  So, my thoughts,m yeah, you're wrong|`|7y3OA7LQaa	I think that there is nothing wrong with expecting respect but don't expect everything in the world from him materialistically or anything like that.
WWnkeaIAaa	don't just think about it, she may have other idea's, ha
wW6NJk4jaa	yes he probably likes you, and I would assume he wants to have sex with you, he sounds like a pervert
yJZeRu5Vaa	he is immaute. he likes your boobs. watch the milkshake video, youll understand|`|SHoIWZ56aa	probably likes you not in a longterm relationship way|`|MfUMaKcDaa	he might be like, checking you out...he's probably a heatbreaker. don't waste your time.|`|AA11727669	He dosemt like u.

aITWZoQzaa	I think he's a player and probably does that to every girl.  It makes him feel cool but he really doesn't get it.  It just makes him look like a immature jerk.

Well, I don't seek girls, I tend to ignore them for a long time, and they just try harder, but ask them, because only they can tell you why they went out with me...|`|bbcdb7567db47a2d8a81e3abaec851e3aa	I don't either.  I've been told by my husband that most women like men that are mean to them, but I don't get it.  Who wants abuse?  Not me, or you, evidently.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	Usually because they are dating someone who is equally mean and stupid!|`|O183sgCLaa	well soon girls are gonna figure out the @ssholes they were dating back in middle school and highschool, are gonna find out it was a mistake<br>  soon guys would get over themselves and stop being @ssholes|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	There are many hurt people in this world that think negative attention is better than no attention.|`|DJo0E2I2aa	because mean people olny want sex so they put out more for other mean people who want sex so there putting out as well

39b93358932fc94c4728e2a799ba5a80aa	welll first off....if he dumped you for that girl cuz of her looks, well then you most certainly shouldn't be with him again....thats messed up but thats what we guys mostly end up doin if we don't have feelings for the girl we r with right now<br>  <br>  next....well enjoy the fact that he got cheated on by her, cuz think about it, if he never left you, he wouldn't be hurt by yasmin in the first place. i would rub that in his face if i was you.<br>  <br>  last....its hard to get over...try some st. john's wort at the local pharmacy, its an over the counter anti-depressant and makes your mood better. you WILL get over him....trust me|`|9SSO454taa	What go around will come around.|`|foBwYDM7aa	It's a hard one because as you say, this girl is nice to everyone, it would make you look a little bad if you suddenly had a go at her.<br>  Even so, she sounds like a bit of a slut.
GBr9YngTaa	Perhaps he's shy. Why not take initiative and talk to him? Even if he stares at you it doesn't necessarily means he likes you. It could mean that you're an eye candy or good looking.|`|7sA8HwTzaa	Yes, he likes you.  You're going to have to be the first one to talk or things will go nowhere.|`|AP0blEojaa	is he shy? if your answer is yes then he likes you go up to him and say hello and talk to him|`|QR6JmD4Haa	If you're interested, why don't you talk to him? Maybe he's shy, and if that's true, then it will help a lot if you do. Good luck|`|JOfW3U5taa	walk up to him, open your eyes wide and stare at face while saying "how does it feel to be stared at?"<br>  <br>  you should freak him out and he should leave you alone ^^|`|yfGvXftfaa	ask him why he's staring at u so much !|`|j9D1wL0baa	if he not talking to you he probably don't like you, but he could just be shy, so try talking to him, and if he talks to you then it's all good, and if he doesn't talk to you, forget about him, there are way better guys out there that will talk to you. <br>  <br>  kk hope a helped|`|r5amEcP3aa	He's probably shy, or doesn't know how you feel. Start talking to him more, and then gradually talk about going on a date or something (casual at first.)|`|cul82gntaa	it depends on how old he is, i think he might like u , u should start talking to him
HKkbqlIuaa	Sounds like she's hypocritical. She wants to be nice to your face, but then she wants to sabotage your relationship. I would say ignore her. I don't really care for my soon to be mother-in-law, but I just avoid her as much as possible. I look at the great thing my fiance and I have, and I realize that it's not worth it to bother with her. She probably also doesn't want her baby boy going off and depending on someone else. Some mothers don't want to lose their children, especially mothers with sons. I find it quite irritating. Well, I hope you're able to resolve things.|`|HMzUeqTmaa	Mom's in general are over protective, and they want what is right for their son. Even if it is not what HE wants. If you like him that much to get engaaged, then he does like you, so his mom is going to have to put her differences aside|`|vlEeaB4baa	Oh, I hate that.  Sometimes I feel the same way about my fiance's mom.  I think she talks all nice to my face, but then when him and her are talking on the phone, they trash me or something.  It's the worst feeling ever.   ah..........  I guess if you love him enough, you will put up with it, as silly as it seems.    My mom talks crap about my fiance all the time, and I just ignore her, 'cause I love him and she couldn't change my mind if she tried.  Good luck.|`|fyKFnxCnaa	Some times mothers of boys are just plain ol psycho sis.<br>  <br>  Don't take the crap personal.  Believe me, in-laws can be a real pain in the @ss.. <br>  <br>  My ex's mother never liked me... and I have no idea why.<br>  <br>  But I got over it.<br>  <br>  You really don't have to be that involved with her.<br>  <br>  At one point, I simply avoided her.<br>  <br>  As far as the fights she is having with your fiance - let him deal with that..<br>  <br>  That is his mother and his problem.<br>  <br>  Let him stress about that.<br>  <br>  You can't contol anyone other then yourself.<br>  <br>  And who knows why she doesn't like you.<br>  <br>  But don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  A lot of people can't stand their in-laws.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|yRBvbzKPaa	it could be just an insecurity thing on her behalf<br>  no matter how old a son gets, mummys always love to look after their little boys<br>  as long as you guys can keep perservering<br>  do you guys live with his mother?<br>  coz i've been there, and i strongly recommend getting your own space
877c11ba0aaa509142a50e675e9f83c6aa	To an extent, it's definitely true.<br>  <br>  If a MAN likes you, he'll make it happen is more true than if a BOY likes you, he'll make it happen.<br>  <br>  However, as with anything in life (and as was in the movie), there are exceptions for everything.<br>  <br>  For example, if you're best friends with a guy and he's crazy about you, he might not say anything for fear of losing you as a friend.<br>  <br>  Still, its a pretty safe bet that if a guy has plenty of chances to make something happen and he doesn't, he isn't interested. :)|`|J30Gh5O6aa	i dont think thats true in all cases but in some for sure.|`|1dP7Viiuaa	no. i dont believe in much of what the movie or the book says. cause most of the situations they talk abt are people who just met each other and started dating. well, alot of times a relationship doesnt start that way. so its really quite unrealistic to over-generalise everything. <br>  <br>  besides, in the dating game, the girl gives the signal that she wants the guy and not the other way ard.|`|5QPJ9NRxaa	no its not lol<br>  notice how in the end of the movie the guy who said that line didn't make it happen, but he did like her
8uzTVZVtaa	It depends on whether he's superficial or not. Or whether he really likes you. You appear to be comfortable about dating a shorter guy. Both of you have to find this acceptable, not just one person. Ask him, whether he's doesn't mind the height difference. Does he feel intimated? Does he feel that it's a threat to his masculinity? Don't be so self conscious, and ask him. And, it's totally acceptable to date someone taller than you, no matter if you're a man, or woman. Look at some of these crazy celebrities like Flav Flav and Brigitte Nielsen; Michael J Fox, and Tracy Pollan; Tom Cruise and Kate Holmes. Height, like age is just a number. So, don't let it keep you from the love of your life. Having someone very different in your life is exciting, and challenging.|`|2btGvJexaa	you know that saying "its on the inside that matters?" That is totally true! If you both like each other go for it! Height is not a big deal when you find someone you connect with. Plus how often are you going to be standing together anyways?

He was terribly funny.  It didn't work out but it wasn't because of the height difference.

They broke up because she kept flirting with other guys, my ex the most. I would say she's kind of a whore.. but anyways I'm over him since I know it's his lost since he won't ever get to have me again even if he begged because his current girlfriend... total player and he seems to be in love with her. SUCKS FOR HIM THAT JERK. <br>  <br>  yeah I'm not much help. But hopefully you'll move on soon. It's better that way because now, we hate eachother so much we won't even talk to eachother even though we have a lot of classes together.
AjBpAPpdaa	If you truely loved him, you would see past his weight problem and into his heart and soul and love him for who he really is.

She weighs 30 pounds less than me. I told her I had no issues with her weight. But in your case, the best way to solve this situation is to workout together.

ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	Sometimes two people can break up, still have sex afterwards, and both be totally fine. Just ask yourself this: How would you feel if you found out he was also having sex with someone else? Or if he actually got another girlfriend? Would you be okay with that or would it upset you? Don't expect him to always be around for you because he probably won't. Most likely, you two having sex will just make things even more complicated. You still have feelings for him, and it sounds like he does for you too, but it may not be worth all the emotions you'll feel afterwards. Guys can have sex with a girl and just forget about her. Girls want more security than that. But if you're both fine with it morally, and know that for a fact, and can have SAFE sex without all the emotions afterwards, then go for it. But really think about it before you do please.|`|AA11447210	If you are both adults, responsible, safe, and available (not cheating) it's fine...if you can handle it emotionally.<br>  <br>  However if you aren't both at least 18 and legally responsible for the consequences of your actions, then it's a very bad idea...nobody should have to deal with that but you two (possible pregnancy or STDs or whatever else may occur)|`|jJjfeylmaa	"everybody thinks that everybody knows about everybody else, but nobody knows anything about themselves cuz their all worried about everybody else" -jack johnson<br>  <br>  DON'T make your decisions based on what other people think, do what you and him think is right, it's your life not anyone else's!|`|iizKx4Bvaa	listen, you do what you think is right for you.

Cut up the material into odd shapes, and allow the children to glue down the material with liquid glue. Don't give them any limits, just let their imagination flow.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to do that, then just try coloring or drawing. Let them watch a movie or watch some television.

Just make them something healthy...something you know they already like and enjoy. I hope you have fun baby sitting!

When that problem comes up, she has to fix it herself, and when you start helping, it usually makes it worse. They think it's overly noticeable if you can see it, and start getting worse and worse. The thing is, it drains you. You start to worry so much, you can't even have a normal conversation. You may love her, but Insecurity is a straight road right to ruin. Steer off of it as soon as you can, and don't just feed them what you want to hear. Until they can take care of themselves, you need to let her stand on her own. Don't be a crutch.|`|MtEZChaGaa	I feel like this happens alot in relationship in which the girl doesn't trust you alot anymore. Maybe you've done something that made her upset at one point..

Your heart is your court to decide. If you are doing good then fear for none.<br>  <br>  ALL THE VERY BEST!|`|kL6RNKpJaa	He sounds like the b**** in this one. He's probobly really hurt inside, and as weird and dramatic as that sounds it's probobly true. So he's trying to basically make sure that your hurt aswell and embarress you. I'm guessing those im's and messages were about getting back together? talking it out? or him trying to tell you how he feels just so you know and he thinks you don't care so he's back lashing at you. If I were you, I would try talking to him about it and trying to be friends, people would believe it more if the truth came from him and he said "Okay we didn't really do anything"<br>  If that doesn't work, and he doesn't want to talk to you, I would just spred it around that everythin wasn't true, and if it gets really out of hand and people start really teasing you and getting physical? Go to the principal, I've seen it happen before to a girl who would go home crying because she was called a **** and she was still a virgin and everything. So do something!(: Hope something helped!

The relationship is separate.<br>  <br>  If a relationship is working and is healthy I don't believe any social networking site would ruin it.  Of course, those in the relationship should be fully aware of what the other is doing in Facebook, MySpace or whatever the site is.  <br>  <br>  It's okay to have friends and even friends of the opposite gender provided both parties in the relationship are okay with it.  If it causes discomfort then those friendships are not okay.<br>  <br>  As you know, my friend, people can do all sorts of things online.  For some people that is nearly their whole life.  But relationships are built on trust and respect, and when that is violated that is what can ruin the relationship.  <br>  <br>  My first marriage ended long before there was an internet or a Facebook, and what caused it to end was a betrayal of trust and respect (on her part.)  That can happen online or any other way, and the result is pretty much the same.<br>  <br>  It is possible that Facebook could--for some people--be a healthy release.  If it works that way it could actually help relationships, but that is totally up to the participants in the relationship.|`|HqcH85SMaa	I play a wrestling game on facebook that takes hours per day and my hubby plays too so we don't have a problem.

KSUPtqCaaa	Honestly, you might need to see a doctor about this if you're still having problems at twenty... That said, some people never do cure it and have to find a means to manage it.<br>  <br>  You really should consider telling her and being up front. Yes, it could gross her out and ruin the relationship; but these are the risks of life; and trust me, no relationship is worth living as a lie!<br>  <br>  Once she is told, then you will have to decide if it is better to wear protection or risk wetting the bed... This is your choice, but it is worth discussing with her. If she feels she has some say in your life, it may help it go over better.<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|IvMPh09baa	buy some depends.|`|0lQtTE9Daa	if your having a girl over just dont drink anything and go to the bathroom alot that day. part of the reason you do it is cus your thinking about it. its all phsycological|`|YHcyuka3aa	I think on the times you do bed wet, your extremely tired and you sleep too soundly to wake up when the urge comes to visit the bathroom or your just too lazy to get up. It also could be a drinking problem, do you drink? Try to make sure you get plenty of rest, treat yourself just like you would a child that your toilet training, (don't laugh I'm serious) Make sure you go before bedtime and if necessary, set an alarm for 4 or 5 hours later to wake you up to go again. Don't be lazy about it but get up and go. Once your have trained your body to follow the urge to go, you will soon have the problem solved.|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	I thought you were a 9th grade guy whose music teacher is flirting with him.

But if your trying to be a good friend, TELL HIM THE TRUTH! It might be tough but it's slot easier than him finding out you lied to him about it. I'm sure he wants the truth anyways! Trust me.

Mr. Popular probably knows his reputation and is over-confident and full of himself. Also, less competition for The Loner.|`|4yVHE0hLaa	if your a loner then your probably not seen often, so the mr. popular will be noticed more , but the mr. popular is intimidating.|`|wfE3mo7Naa	they're obviously not going to have identical personalities if one is a loner and the other is "mr popular"<br>  <br>  personality is changed by experiences. dont be a ******* idiot.|`|NiO0qTEzaa	Who do you like more?<br>  <br>  I'd go for the loner because Mr. popular probably gets so many girls its not funny.

vBkGGYJSaa	it sounds like he likes you.<br>  you will never know for sure unless you start talking to him and simply ask him if he likes you.<br>  if he says no, then ask him why not and tell him that you like him and see what he says.<br>  the only way to know is to talk, talk about anything just talk and see where the conversation goes.<br>  smile at him and see what his reaction is. good luck|`|cuqP79Foaa	it sounds like he likes you. just ask him one day.
AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|DEHqdmVnaa	WOW THATS ALOT OF WRITING ^

You told your friend what you knew about this guy.  She listened, but she still made a choice to go out with him.  Now, if you want to continue being a good friend, be there for her.  She had the right to make her own choices.  Be there so she has someone to talk to, but do not say I told you so.  She is hurting right now and could use someone to talk to.

But if you like this guy go for it. If you dont and you are just friends, Its not your job to save his education and it certainly not good for him to make ultimatums. They aren't good in the first place.

Dont think about it, and when you like the girl and start talking to her, you'll automatically flirt.|`|ee7335f3bdae606bbfe534bef63fe2e0aa	Find something you like and tell her about it.  Like:  I really like your top.  That's a flirt.|`|qRKOWgS0aa	Try This<br>  First and foremost, listen more than you talk. This doesn't mean sit there like a dud, but ask a question, wait until she is completely done talking then agree with her. <br>  Now then, start up a conversation with her. Speak with confidence and flow, but do not attempt extreme images such as macho, super-smooth, cool dude, comedian, pick-up artist, witty conversationalist, or having a profession that you do not have. <br>  You can pretend the confidence at first. It will come more naturally when she responds to you. <br>  Don't overwhelm her with compliments. You should focus on going from "nice acquaintance" to "intimate friend/potential lover" smoothly. Intimate friends joke around, tease each other gently, touch each other. Start with touching her on the arm when you're laughing (don't watch the hand). See if she touches you. <br>  Don't act like you're trying to impress her. If she really does something stupid and is a little embarrassed (not horrified) call her out on it. Smirk, say, "Wow - that was smooth!" with a little smile, then change tone and say, "Oh - come here!" and comfort her with a little side-hug. If you do or say something stupid, don't just ignore it, either. Don't focus on it for too long, but just say, "It's my first day walking. Give me a break!" with a smile. <br>  Throw in some<br>  Hope it helps?|`|MfUMaKcDaa	just be natural, and talk normal and it'll come to you.

I'm a highschool student so... it wasn't too long ago I saw your situation happening left and right.|`|sfHIaIi6aa	well ive been in ur shoes like probly everyone else, if u guys hang out more outside of school u probly have a good shot start with bigger groups of friends then u guys can hang out alone without it getting awkward sometimes its not just shyness something could be on her mind too and if u want her to open up to u then u should open up to her first then she might feel more comfortable, also you should live your life with her more than talk about it cuz u havent lived much so just go out and do stuff|`|3XBtWuTWaa	hmmn.<br>  then try to talk to her about your feelings.<br>  how you desire her to feel comfortable with you.<br>  but i also think it`s normal to be shy.<br>  maybe she's scared of something that you might hate her.<br>  or what so ever.<br>  just make your relationship stronger.<br>  doing lovey-dovey stuffs.<br>  sharing secrets and blabla:))|`|xFueK4ZFaa	tell her some of YOUR things openly. <br>  do some things that she WOULD NEVER do to show her that its okay to do them.<br>  <br>  idk? she's obviously kind of weird if she's your GIRLFRIEND and she can't be comfortable. maybe you guys should have established that BEFORE you decided to get serious :)|`|dJ7xagFCaa	Show her that you are just like her. over time, she will get as comfy with you as if she is with her family. and yes its normal. im shy around older guys too. she just doesnt want to do something stupid cause older guys are intimidating. just trip one day and maybe it will loosen her up a bit [jk... unless your willing] <br>  <br>  hope this helps! please star me! i need to get to level too!|`|sPUaA91taa	just let her know that even though your in 8th and shes in 7th that you guys have a special relationship and that age doesn't really matter that much. just let her know that you are there for her.|`|U8v8RXvQaa	your only in eigth grade.<br>  don't sweat it.<br>  keep it low key around her,<br>  and don't rush her into anything.<br>  be a friend to her - and she'll warm up to you eventually.|`|GYgtimSLaa	you have all of high school to date<br>  i personally think you are too young.<br>  <br>  how long have you known each other? that may be part of it|`|TApsFzgBaa	SHE YUST NEEDS TO GET USED TO IT....THERES NO PROBLEM WITH SOMEONE DATING SOMEONE A EYAR LESS THAN THEM OR MORE.....ITS LOVE N DAT DNT MATTER|`|554cbaad408d4cd105322cde412038daaa	She's like what? 12?

Things take time.|`|yq5b1OFCaa	gotta give it time|`|5HOyupgfaa	i have no idea why she would be shy. im a 7th grader currently dating an 8th grader and im always open around him. but, if you guys just started dating, she might be in like a stage of shock or something? idk. but you could just talk to her more and maybe have a talk with her and ask her why shes shy around you, i mean she is your girlfriend|`|ySYcQhcjaa	get to know her a lot. like what her interests are and try to connect with her. that relationship is ok cause in our school, a 6th grader is dating a 10th grader.|`|u5HmOfhRaa	Once she spends more time with you she will most likley not be as shy around you.|`|QPVEL0NLaa	so..........your the one bugging my little girl.

pdbc4souaa	You're looking at one night, a little conversation, a couple gestures. You want to make a big thing about it. The more important issue is, "Can you talk to him? Do you have anything in common with him?"<br>  <br>  There have been a lot of women I have liked over the years, some that I have been strongly attacted to, but unless you can form an attachment and share something with that person, it will never develop into anything.Can you talk to him when the lights are on and there is no music playing? Because that is the way we live, honey.
vBvgqjjsaa	Yes he likes you!|`|0JGFv5PXaa	he really likes u

AfnQ95Z5aa	Because yahoo answers is a front for the International Church Ladies Bridge Club.|`|a1pmr73vaa	good offer..wanna 3some lol.|`|mwEBrwlOaa	I feel there are several reasons for this. First reason is threesomes do not fix relationship problems they can only make them worse. Threesomes should be done by a couple when their relationship is stable not when it is going through rough times. If a threesome is done when the couple is having relationship problem then issues like an affair and further relationship problems are more likely to occur. <br>  <br>  Second reason there allot of self-proclaimed relationship experts on Yahoo! Answers who believe all solutions are based on a simple black and white formula which is based on 1930s Christian values and modern day talk shows. <br>  <br>  Third reason there are allot of wannabies on Yahoo! Answers those who want to have a threesome but for whatever have not. So they take out their frustration on those who ask questions.<br>  <br>  Fourth is that you are way too sensitive. Big deal someone does not like your reply for whatever reason. It is not like you are not going to get a $1,000,000 prize for giving the most popular answer or be elected president. All you get is 10 points that is not redeemable for cash. Just learn to go with the flow because you are dealing with a subject that is going to elicit a strong emotional reaction one way or another.|`|M7r7gHNGaa	I think it depends on the ages of the individuals and what the state of their relationship. Threesomes are pretty much for folks in their 20s and older because they are more likely to have the emotional.maturity needed. You also need to consider what sex the third person is going to be. Most young guys will want a second girl and end up practically forcing his girlfriend into the menage a trois. This could be quite traumatic for her. That is immature of the guy and will end in disaster.<br>  <br>  I won't knock it but neither will I condone it for teens.|`|m2jeeo4Laa	Simple logic.  If a person is having relationship problems, adding another problem isn't going to help.|`|L2pkns9maa	A threesome gives them another reason for them to be apart.|`|eUcUQcefaa	A lot of people find threesomes gross. It seems like tons of guys want threesomes, but I know a lot of them really don't want the experience. <br>  <br>  Besides, it's disrespectful to include someone else, friend or whatever, to your own relationship. Many of us think that relationships are special.|`|JyEoCBrJaa	Maybe the reason why your getting a thumbs down b/c your asking this question on the wrong website? Duhhhh...<br>  <br>  And...What make you think a threesome would solve any relationship problem???? I'm going to assume that you are not in a realationship at the moment b/c of this question.|`|qG3Ixgz9aa	Why do you think that a threesome is always the answer to everything?...... Talk about ignorance!!|`|m3iRfxysaa	Some people just aren't very adventurous.|`|AA12321426	Most people are lame and boring, you only live once so rock on buddy|`|xJCc01oRaa	Well sir, why don't you have a threesome?|`|AA11605508	Hey, I'd be all for it if it involved two GUYS.

The only person who can create that feeling inside you..is you. It means you care so much of that other person..that you allow yourself to feel that deeply.<br>  <br>  What is in your mind and in your heart.. is put there by you.<br>  <br>  So you can not force someone to feel what you feel.

First time I was too scared to make a move. Second time, I waited too long to make a move and ended up in "the friend zone" and 3rd time she had her eyes on someone else. Put it this way buddy. Its a lot better to at least KNOW she doesnt love you back than to sit in the dark wondering. Dont act all desperate and tell her you love her and whatnot. She'll probably get scared off. Just ask her out like normal and see how it goes from there. Good luck, hope you get her =]|`|d67b3bee942a5faea13b08c9229ffe2baa	yes, the only way to move on is to find someone else.  i was practically in love with a guy until he moved away and i was forced to stop hanging out with him.

x1FzJLwZaa	Do you reach orgasm faster than you can blink your eye?? Many men dread this situation, and with good reason. Cumming too early or too fast robs you and your partner of the pleasure that sexual intercourse can give. Cumming to quickly is believed to be one of the most common sexual complaint of many couples. About 29 percent of men are reportedly bothered by these “quick” sexual episodes.<br>  <br>  There are many reasons why a man “cums” too fast. Biologically, men experience climax much earlier than women. They do so 2-3 minutes after penetration, in contrast to women who take their time (about 12-14 minutes). Likewise, there are also psychological factors that bring about early ejaculation. These include guilt, anxiety (lack of experience), or fear of sexually transmitted infections, potential pregnancy, etc. Age and sexual experience also plays a factor in cumming to quickly. Older men are also known to be able to control their ejaculation as compared with their younger counterparts. The men surveyed credit this due to their experience.<br>  <br>  So, how can you control yourself from ejaculating too quickly? One way is to exercise your PC (pubococcygeus) muscle, which is the primary “sexual muscle” that forms part of the pelvis. The PC muscle is largely involved with sexual functions such as ejaculation and orgasm. With regular exercise, this muscle can provide firmer and larger erections, powerful ejaculations and<br>  more intense climaxes.<br>  <br>  So where is this muscle located? Try stopping the flow of your urine midway. The PC muscle, located between the anus and scrotum, is the one you contracts when you try to stop the flow of your urine.<br>  <br>  Now that you know where it is located, how do you go about exercising your PC muscles? Try clenching and releasing your PC muscle in ten-second periods. Perform three sets of this. Take a breather. Now, try the clench-and-release technique for five seconds. Perform ten sets of this. This time, try tightening the muscle for 30 seconds and relaxing for 30 seconds. Perform three sets of this.<br>  <br>  This exercise is rather simple and easy to perform. You can do it by yourself — just about anytime and anywhere. You don’t need any device or contraption to exercise your PC muscle. But, like all exercise regimens, you need to commit to a routine devotedly. Famous porn stars, with explosive cumshots, are even rumored to perform these exercises faithfully.<br>  <br>  So next time you and your partner are making love, try to go inside her and pause for awhile. Don’t move for several seconds; then try tightening and relaxing your PC muscle.<br>  <br>  You also have to keep in mind that different women also prefer different types of sex. Some prefer the long and sensual approach; while others favor the pound-pound-pound quick approach. It’s always better to know your partner’s preference so that you can both enjoy an intimate sexual fun.<br>  <br>  Open communication is essential if you want to achieve multi-orgasmic sex. If you are cumming to soon during sex, talk with your partner and let her know what is going on. You will be surprised at how quickly she will volunteer to help you increase your penetration time. You guys can increase foreplay and try multiple positions to lengthen your love making experience. Great long lasting sex can be a reality for you and your partner but you must be willing to learn together what works for the both of you while trying to<br>  fix the problem of cumming too fast.|`|URJyU1q5aa	I could see why she got mad because she wanted to go longer but thats not really your fault.   by the way, me and my bf were 16 and 19 when we first got together and that was 3 years ago and we are still going strong so ignore those people. i think you can only get in trouble if one of your parents press charges or if you get caught in the act. im not totally sure but i was told something like that by a cop a couple years ago.|`|W6LGsQC8aa	First of all, are you taking care of her first before you go at it?<br>  <br>  FOREPLAY, my friend... if you give her at LEAST one (but please, the more the better) orgasm before intercourse, she will be happier with you. The clitoris is your friend!<br>  <br>  I also suggest wearing a condom to reduce sensitivity so you last longer when you are actually having intercourse. They make desensitizing condoms too!|`|dTaGzh6Haa	Ah, women. Aren't they so totally weird?<br>  Okay, why don't you try masturbating right before you go out with her? Then you can probably hold off a little longer the first time around.<br>  She's not old enough or knowledgeable enough about the way guys 'work' to understand a logical explanation. That's perfectly okay though. I'd be real worried if she did. <br>  Use some protection dude.|`|2MdtxjEAaa	She is definately wrong for getting mad at you. That is not in your control and it should not be all about that anyway. And HEY you did make it up to her.|`|qxYlOxXHaa	I would suggest more foreplay with you concentrating on her.  Both of your hormones are at an all time high.|`|YuC4xv1baa	your 19 and shes 16 im getting the police involved|`|X3QBqLSHaa	I wouldn't get mad, but you could go to jail since your an adult and she's a minor!|`|ZqKuZ0Dbaa	yes, but only if it is everytime you have sex, my boyfriend last only like a minute, it is really selfish and don't even want to have sex with him|`|kzIVGEfgaa	I think she is confused. I also think it's more of a confusion than being mad. It's not your fault I agree. She may be someone who thinks it is going to be a long time everytime. That's just not the case|`|8DYwsHlPaa	well if she turned you<br>  on and didn't satisfie you<br>  wouldn't you be mad?<br>  and people take things differently<br>  and neeither|`|kfntyBZYaa	she's 16 and you're 19 and wondering why she's immaturely getting mad at you?

When things are over you you could care less after that.
8P64hgL3aa	how much time does he want to spend with you? Does he call you/email you/text you often? If so, there's a high chance he does.<br>  Oh and also look to see if he spends any money for you.<br>  good luck|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	has he ever called you or texted of his own volition?<br>  is he nervous when you are near<br>  does he stare at you.<br>  these are some give- aways that he likes you.|`|M7r7gHNGaa	The only thing I want to say is that staring is not necessarily an indication that someone likes you. Guys and girls will also stare at people they dislike.|`|I5SypMlsaa	yeah if he is paying attention to you its a giveaway... guys think in one direction if he doesnt like you he wouldnt even look at you twice, unless he just wants to be your friend(in that case you must be really cool and like of the guys which i doubt you are)|`|Jw3VExIpaa	If he talks to you, texts takes his pressious time spent doing all that its a deff. sign come on a little stringer to him and let him know you like him then he will ask you out!|`|X757qR26aa	well normally a obvious sign is that he stares at you or looks at you a lot|`|pAtRDF6baa	A clear give away is if he glances at your lips every now and then
sYSEYHAzaa	Sounds like a fuc'k up to me... Dump her... if she drinks and cheats what else do u see in her... ive known girls exactly like that and ive seen them cheating while their bf's somewheres elseplace. There are plenty of fish in the sea brother and u dont need the pain. If she really loved u she wouldnt be drinking with other guys at parties and bars. Shes ungrateful for u, even when u are giving her second and maybe even third chances. (In sports terms its 4th and 10 yards to go... Time to Punt!)|`|srAP6Vzvaa	your an idiot !!!! what kind of a Man, a strong Man, takes back a cheating whore??? your pathetic. your not worthy to be titled a MAN. your a sniveling little boy who takes back a unfaithful woman !? your a fool and your weak. she is going to get banged by a railroad track of Men and your gonna take it. so sad... utterly sad. Live and Learn little boy. Live and Learn|`|qazXVoYdaa	dude you sound really sweet and all but you ganna have to leave her<br>   5 DIFFERENT GUYS!!!<br>  and her excuse was total bull!<br>  im sorry but i dont think she loves you<br>  like you love her =[|`|ise05jjUaa	I hate to say this but I would move on, I could see if only 2 dudes called & said that they slept with her because its possible they were in cahoots with one another in trying to start trouble, but its not, its 5 different dudes.  One dude even said to tell your girl to leave him alone, he's not saying he slept with her like the other 4 dudes, he's wants her to leave him alone so that makes me think otherwise that maybe she is all up on him.  I really don't see why 5 random dudes would just call & make up something like that, if it was just one dude its possible that he might be trying to break the two of you up so he can go out with her, but again its not its 5 different dudes.  After a while you have to think there's some truth to it if more than one person is saying it, but that is up to you.  Had it been me, yes I was like you at one time, took a girl back after she cheated on me only to realize it was the wrong choice to make.  Now that I'm older, knowing that I had gone through that, I would say to move on & find someone else better.|`|aXnxkT1oaa	If you do not leave the w h o r e you will have hell in life! kick her out! unless you want to suffer|`|aLgY4l3Naa	You know when we love someone we just want to cling to every word they say whether its a lie or not, but you really need to sit down and gather your thoughts together and really think things through, something does not seem right, and i get the feeling your headed for more heartache and pain if you choose to stay with her! You really seem like a good guy and your young still, there are too many good women out there for you to put yourself into this one who does not really love and appreciate you the way she should!! Love and respect yourself to know you deserve better, be confident with who you are and know this was not your fault or your problem, ITS HERS and that's were you need to leave it! It does not sound like she made a mistake, its sounds like this is the person she is, so beware, i think your getting your fair warning, PAY ATTENTION!! Good luck to you and i wish you the best!!
WA9Y8QAEaa	be more mature around her, maybe not joke around as much, prove to her that you can be a mature guy :) Talk to her about what you want for the future, maybe pull out her chair for her when you can, etc :)<br>  good luck with the girl! :)
nBNzYDpLaa	I'm not really sure about type/color.<br>  But if you take a wet toothbrush and brush your lips, it will make them really soft and moist and i don't even know, it's really nice though. :P Try asking again in a fashion category, you'd get more help there.|`|ZyPqznLFaa	Hahaha. Try something with the word **** in it. It's made for you!|`|mrysAOpGaa	are you trying to be seductive and get attention?! that picture was unnecassary, please delete this question to avoid other people looking at it
SRPh7SjVaa	From personal experience, don't have her bring a friend. It takes away from the fact you both want to get to know one another as friend's. But, you don't want to go anywhere where chances to be intimate pop up. A big public place, most likely. The mall is a good place to go. Grab a bite to eat, walk around, talk, socialize, just have fun. Don't worry so much about the response you'll get from her. The more you try to make it not seem like a date, the more you push it that way. Try to steer clear of the talk of past relationships, because that implies you want to know how their love life has been, and how you can fit in it. Don't flat out tell her it's not a date, because sometimes you can offend them, even though you don't mean to come off that way. Main point is, just treat them like distant familiy. Don't do anything you wouldn't do with someone elses girlfriend, either. Don't try too hard. You'll be fine.|`|mC2dRyuMaa	well if u ask her to bring friends itl be even more ackward but if u no sum one that she knows bring him or her along take her like to the park get sumtn to eat movies the mall idk wuts in ur neighborhood thats fun|`|n336SjRiaa	bring her to a coffee shop. caribu or starbucks or something. its not a date, its casual, yet sweet. coffee shop all the way.|`|l3T0wmSyaa	go with some friends to something really cool like a concert or go bowling.... something that you'll have fun with|`|5lKBLQ6vaa	do not bring any company. bc then it shows your prob to shy to hang out w. her by yurself|`|s0qrPl5saa	I'd hang out with just her, if you both bringing friends is suggested by you, it might seem to her like you're just trying to get to know her friends more than her. Sure, after you've met her a few times, but not the first time in my opinion :)<br>  <br>  I don't think that taking her for a long walk (the whole day?) would be such a bad idea, maybe get to a park and sit around there and chat; a park isn't really a "date" place. And if you don't want her to think it's a date, then just don't mention that you think she might see it like that, simply because that would make her wonder about it.|`|PvwZdLuLaa	Honestly, in this situation, I wouldn't be talking to anyone on like and then meeting them. You never know what kinds of crazy people there are out there. Be very very careful if you end up going through with it, but I personally think that you shouldn't.|`|W7l1awFPaa	Do you want it to be a date?  Then don't clutter it up with other people.  A nice, relaxing place is a coffee shop of an afternoon.  Cliche I know, but it works.  If you prefer you can do something else non-committal like taking a walk downtown or by the river or something.  Sitting and chatting, I think, is the best way to get to know someone fairly quickly.|`|7BZYUHpjaa	if your not going for a date then dont tell her to bring a friend cuz then it sounds like a double. just tell her something like its great to hang out with her and shes such a great friend. if you didnt want to be alone with her the first time then take her to a party or something.|`|c09gaZh3aa	If I was you I would bring a friend along so things won't seem exclusive.When you two hangout it won't be like a date if you have someone else there to tagalong|`|UOSrSEqHaa	you might not want to meet "her" alone because there is the chance she is a 50 year old man who wants to rape you. Bring a friend...or five..|`|UhBfGjZFaa	tell her to bring a friend and you do the same
9xEZ22NEaa	OK, if you THINK she lyks you...you don't need to go jump right into it. Trust me...us girls don't like that. If we like you, we'll let you know. But before jumping all into it, make sure you KNOW she's been showing signs. Maybe she is just one of those girls that is SUPER SUPER friendly. Get one of your GUY (*key word there) friends to go start a conversation with her and then kind of ease into asking "Do you like (insert your name here)?" and then tell your GUY friend to kind of ease off the conversation after getting a yes, no, not really, kind of, or some kind of answer. Then if she replies with one of the following, go and take that extra step: "Yes." "Sort of." <br>  But if she says one of the following, just continue to be bestestest friends:<br>  "No." "Not really." "<br>  If she gives your friend the typical "I don't know" answer, then just try to win her over without being too obvious. If she gives the "I don't know" and then pours herself out to your friend, tell him to tell you all that she poured out and then interpret that the best way you can. <br>  <br>  If you have any questions or a problem arises, you can contact me on my profile page! Best of luck! Add me to your friends!
uxBnPqtYaa	just be yourself. compliment her. be witty. dont kiss her yet. give it time. dont try to rush into anything. take things slow. end the night with a hug. that should guarantee a second date. and just relax. its not like your on trial. dont be too tense. just chill and let things flow naturally. if it doesnt work out it doesnt matter, there are plenty more where that came from(:<br>  <br>  good luck honey?<br>  hope everything works out fine.|`|owjQbCzjaa	Ask her questions about herself, act as if you are interested to know more about her and shows you really care and a good listener.<br>  <br>  Act like yourself, is the BEST advice to be given.<br>  If you act like  someone else, then she won't like you for the real you.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you will do great, and have an amazing time with your lady!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|kERP7zAhaa	When you pick her up, compliment her.

992155b8fe8665d0f71938b6281333e5aa	variety is the spice of life.  My wife indulges me from time to time as I too have a ph fetish.  In a healthy relationship you both are trying to continue to please the other.  I do things for her like give massages that she loves.<br>  <br>  Not easy to put into words but don't make it about the ph.  They think of them like underwear not at all the way that you see them.  I was able to make my wife more into it by setting it up.  I did something for her that she really liked (dinner, dance, massage on return) and then put a blindfold on her.  I then dressed her in ph, left the blind fold on, and we had a nice time.  I then told her how great it was and how I'd love for that to happen again or more frequently.  Set the mood, they are happy and willing to indulge to make you happy.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|YTasscmKaa	No, its not wrong to ask. My wife caters to my pantyhose fetish. But we have a good relationship and there are alot of things I do for her as well. As long as its a balanced and fair relationship, there is no harm in asking.

It sounds like she really likes you. She's basically sending you mixed signals. I can understand that completely. That's what I'm going through right now. This guy was flirting with me, told me he liked me, and then the day after he asked me to hang out and I told him I couldn't, he got a girlfriend. Then I asked him what was going on and he told me I was cute. But he still flirts with me, even with his girlfriend around. <br>  <br>  <br>  This kinda goes with you...The girl likes you as more than a friend, but she's still willing to go out with other guys.|`|rDOaBCViaa	If she is taking the time to go out and actually talk to you I would say this is possibly more.

doHNEvf8aa	tell your friend she would wanna know,<br>  <br>  <br>  ps that joey kid sounds like a jerk|`|2EIvAsZ6aa	Yeah, you should tell your friend. Its entirely disrespectful for him to be flirting with any woman while hes in a relationship, and you're no better if you start pursuing him.|`|TLim2pBTaa	I think you should tell Danielle what her boyfriend has been doing just find a nice way to let her know. You know your friend better than anybody so you should know how she should react. Because he told her that you and Erica were jealous of their relationship you don't want her to think that you are purposely trying to break them up. Hope everything works out. Good Luck.|`|kAX9xBmkaa	o should talk 2 both of them. and see what they tell u|`|5zcDp9zwaa	If this one guy is causing all of this trouble don't fall for it. I mean if she's your friend..he came into the picture later. He's not good enough for either one of you. It sounds to me like he's trying t play all three of ya'll. Chances are he likes all of ya'll and justs want to see who he can get to first and then will drop you for the next girl that comes along. He's not any good. ..... sorry|`|Hd7tFHN7aa	This is not your to handle.  You weren't kissing him, he kissed you and that is just a kiss.  I agree flirting can and is fun, but you have to limit it to times and places and not all of the time in any place, that is for couples or dating couples to be if you understand that.<br>  <br>  Danielle is going to know a lot about the guy, just being with him and around him.  You should be a good friend and don't go after this guy or take any candy from him or give him any if you know what I'm like saying now.  Be true to your friend, you will know her a lot longer then this guy in the future if he is a player.
8s2HEgWUaa	I think that any college student thinking they are going to stay in a relationship let alone long distance isn't smart enough to be in college. I'm not trying to be mean here but with everything that goes on in college odds are the girl or guy aren't going to stay faithful. you also have to keep in mind that the longer two people are seperated from each other they are going to grow apart. you can talk on the phone as much as you want but when it comes to the real thing your voice just isn't going to cut it. there are couples that are an exception to this but odds are your not the exceptioin to that. sorry
tO8ey3o8aa	idk why some people do that<br>  i find those people to be stupiddd
Bp8ls3XMaa	good personality|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Someone trying to get my attention. Maybe he doesn't like you.<br>  <br>  What I look for is someone who isn't a boy-hopper.<br>  <br>  Someone who loves me back<br>  <br>  Someone who isn't just after sex<br>  <br>  I'm still waiting.|`|12gvcc2Daa	well most guys are simply looking for girls. and i think you've already filled that requirement so just get next to the guy and let nature take its course.|`|e0qGLxmiaa	does it even matter?<br>  u r who u r
kN7MYvmIaa	join a dance class, u'll kill 2 birds with a stone.<br>  a handsome guy who knows how to dance!!|`|AA10975334	You can't get anyone to ask you out, it just comes natural. I can't tell you where you can meet new people because I don't know your area. Are there weekend clubs for people your age? Have you tried going to some of the school activities? Maybe while at school, start introducing yourself to other people, even girls, they just may hook you up with a nice guy to go to the prom with. Even if you don't get a date, GO WITH A BUNCH OF FRIENDS :0D It will be fun and quite memorable. Go and hang out at a restaurant and then go to the prom.|`|9TdKiE0gaa	well you could, get a make over visit  the mall and just ask random people to hang out with you that you think are cute. or just look lonley sitting at a table and people come to you. It happens to me all the time. They just wanna hang out so you could find a date that way :DD|`|rlfaVhlxaa	you dont have to go the traditional route... if you dont think a guys gonna ask you, try asking the guy to prom or just make it blatently obvious you want them to ask you.|`|pQWZNafqaa	Idk. Try community hangouts or something. Sit with different people at lunch, maybe.|`|lLX9iB0Raa	OH GIRL! PLEASE DON'T GO WITH ANY STRANGER! UR OUT OF UR MIND IF U DO! go with ur friends, u'll have more fun and some cute hot guy might pop up at prom by himself or is just there with a friend. but seriously if u don't wanna go with anyone in school, don't go into any website looking for ur perfect date! Good luck AND ENJOY UR PROM! YOU'LL ONLY HAVE ONE!|`|gTN9RF1Aaa	you can usually go to a restaurant like TGIF or the beach.. because seriously, who doesnt go to the beach :)|`|gYyv1c5Waa	Go out with friends on Fridays and maybe over the weekend with their friends or with a group of guys.|`|lTS9ggOhaa	Could you meet someone outside of school and take them to the prom?|`|skEsMe9Kaa	facebook|`|o6xLWwZvaa	I met my husband from a aol chatroom before my junior year of school started. So he went to my junior and senior prom with me. <br>  <br>  So maybe you can meet a guy from the internet just for the prom...and you never know how it will turn out in the end. Good or Bad.
vkI84yPCaa	it doesnt matter what colour u r if u like eachoither... and him smiling and stuff, is proabably because he is a nice guy.. he might also have feelings for u, but if he has a gf, i pewrsonaly think he is being nice and cares about u... <br>  good luck anyway :)
F3KkB4GWaa	Yea guys that age arent even worth the trouble anyway.|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	No.|`|AA11108018	With out a doubt wait a few more years|`|HOVvKqxsaa	no|`|0XhyldBdaa	When you are 14, you don't need to get involved with a guy.  It's hard enough being a teenage girl, going through highschool, having things change with your body and such.  Plus, boys your age are really immature, and boys who are older are only after one thing.  <br>  <br>  I say enjoy your teenage years without a boyfriend.  If you do want to go out and see a movie with a boy or go out with a group of friends and have a boy you have a crush on go with you, then do it... but NOTHING serious... it will only make things hard for you.  You still have the rest of your life to get a boyfriend, so don't rush it now!!|`|rpEplm0Qaa	No my first date was when i was in fifth grade.|`|qDII8luraa	If you truly like someone, then it shouldn't matter.|`|viBopoGTaa	No, age doesn't matter. As long as your responsible and know what your doing.|`|7BcBwW6Xaa	if you think your ready then go for it. i'm ready but my mom won't let me :(.|`|AeJbSuNNaa	I didn't have a choice... I wasn't allowed to date until 16. So, IMO, yes it's too young.|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	yes wait 4 years
TrN7L35Daa	don't ask her if she doesn't like you but what i would want said to me is... I really like you and if you would want to go to a movie of something that would be great. but if not it's ok i understand.|`|AxaBvOvJaa	Hey. I really like you. And I was wondering if you wanted to go out with me? <br>  <br>  <br>  Tips:  <br>  Never have someone ask a girl out for you.<br>  (And I don't really like it when guys ask me out randomly. I like it more when they ask if I want to hang out sometime so we can get to know each other. That's just my opinion though. But since you guys talk a lot, I guess you guys already know each other well.)|`|bq3AotVNaa	Go slow man, just keep it casual. Dont make things weird but just explain to her that you have deeper feelings for her. It could weird things out between you to, but i've never been one to not try because of that. So yes, just explain to her that you like her and that you want to be more than friends, suggest going to a movie, or going for dinner, or if you cant go somewhere ,bring her to your house for your own dinner and a movie, a free evening at home, which , if she is a good friend, she will already be accustomed to. Go for it man, keep it calm, casual, dont try to hard, or come on to strong, just keep a natural flow.|`|Qkg98XtHaa	Just go ahead and ask her. But, if you really like her then just stay friends because if you go out and for some reason you break up then you wont be around her anymore. Wouldnt you rather just be with her all the time than lose her? Its all on you|`|w7rtDlaDaa	ASk her out if she likes you back shes probably waiting for you to ask say like hey do you wanna go to the movies this weekend?|`|2ZMlkKCiaa	do you have school dances? you could ask her to one.... then later at the dance ask her out.... the main thing is that your not going to get anywhere if you don't take risks. just ask her.|`|du5MNrQ6aa	say hey i really like you<br>  <br>  wanna go out|`|bOhvvbUIaa	my advice is to say "hey would you like to go out with me?"|`|IJstP8wAaa	before you ask her out, make sure that she is comfortable with talking to you and make sure that she can trust you. don't scare her by talking to much or being nervous, just try to act normal and "go with the flow." girls never like it when the boy is really awkward and brings the subject up right out of the blue so make the conversation relaxed. good luck!!|`|avQPO8v0aa	take her to a move that she likes.... say jonas brothers 3d concert exprirence with specail guest demi loavto and (ew) taylor swift any girl would love that its like a conecrt so you can dance with her sexually during sexual songs like love is on its way... have fun email me if you do this or need tips!!! at jb4lyf3@yahoo.com have fun!|`|9V5uVE0Xaa	tell her how you really feel about her..maybe she will like you back :] but dont say anything TOO CORNY..but just a little..trust me..be sweet..and not to nervous..and if u get rejected try again..or move on :] <br>  GOOD LUCKK :)|`|c061LEUwaa	just ask her who cares wat is the worse thing that can happen|`|4SxNeTFzaa	aww thats cute :) .. it would be adorable if u told her how beautiful she was n just be honest with her n dont say " will you go out with me" say "will you be my girlfriend" .. muchh cuterr|`|cqOOKv3Jaa	bring up a movie or something that yu know she's into before...she'll reflect the same intrest and just invite her to do whatever it is that she's into some time|`|zrFaC7aHaa	just ask...it really isnt that hard :D lol lately ive been talking to one of my guy friends about a girl he likes and im kinda amazed at how much u guys stress out and think about all the little details about asking a girl out :D just dont be too nervous and maybe after you;ve been talking for a lil bit, than just ask her "hey do u wanna do something friday nite?" or "can i ask you something? do you want to go out with me?" lol just something like that :D good luck|`|qRKOWgS0aa	Yes,go for it. A few easy tips, hope they help.Good Luck.<br>  <br>  Flirting with a girl is all about having fun at the same time giving her strong flirting signals that you might be interested in her. Flirting with a girl involves being spontaneous and a fast thinker. Flirting requires very good communication skills as most of the part of it would be verbal therefore in order to become a good flirt with a girl you need to master the art of communication before hand. There are several other essential aspects to flirting with a girl read on to discover what these aspects are and how you can master them.<br>  <br>  Be good at talking- Like mentioned above flirting with girls is all about being a good talker and very fast with switching words and topics. You would never be a good flirt unless you master your tongue and the words which come out of your mouth. The very first impression you make is based on the way you talk therefore in order to flirt effectively with a girl you need to be a king of communication.<br>  <br>  Over confidence is the key- Yes you heard it! In order to become good at flirting with a girl you need to flaunt confidence and this confidence needs to be spontaneous and over the top. Sometimes over confidence is what's required to flirt effectively with a girl.<br>  <br>  Be humorous- Humor forms the overall foundation of flirting. If you take out humor than it wound be more boring than amusing. Remember the true key to flirting with a girl is all about being funny and making her laugh. Everyone wants to laugh and if you can make a girl feel good than she would most definitely love to see you again and again. You need to become a permanent expert flirt than an occasional flirt who gets rejected by girls all the time.|`|a4fb671bdeb9d97a5ca6b59c2e09d198aa	I would love if a guy I was friends with would just tell me that he cares about me and would like to try having a relationship with me. <br>  <br>  Don't start out by confessing your love for her or coming on really strong. That just scares us off. But no matter what our feelings are, if you take care to make us as comfortable as possible, she will respect you for it.|`|ar06i7cIaa	When you guys are laughing or talking (Or touching,lol) Just tell her be forward, "I really like you a lot and was wondering if you would like to hang out sometime?"<br>  Hope I helped!!! Anything else I can help with? Email me, dont hesitate, probably I'll come up with a more in depth answer!|`|lUUzf7t2aa	do it before its too late, ask her and if she says no.....oh well ur still friends
q8vILEpfaa	He asked SHE has the right to say NO|`|Xb7kaCkiaa	She shouldn't be forced to do nothing she don't wanna do. If he can't accept that then he ain't worth that girls time.|`|J3JClsuQaa	tell her to tell him that if he doesn't want to respect her feelings on the subject he can move on to the next girl... that's what I would say...|`|rT3MfFvuaa	After looking at your question for about 5 minutes I think I have managed to translate it into English!  If the lady in question does not want to try anal sex - end of story!  Sex is a two way thing, would he like it if she wanted him to do something he didn't want?  I doubt it.  Tell her to tell him how she feels so that he doesn't feel totally rejected and if he chooses to continue to press her for anal sex then tell her to inform him to get a horse!|`|Wf8PbTraaa	ummm i personally say don't knock it til you try it.<br>  <br>  but i also believe if a guy is over the top excited to do it in the butt he might be gay......just my opinion though<br>  <br>  either way tell her to try it she might like it. but if she doesn't tell her to stop.|`|aK8BS08Baa	go for it experiment|`|db85e2a270ad9957d45e37426dfe4ed3aa	She shouldn't feel pressured, by him or anyone, to do  something she is not comfortable doing. He needs to respect her decision if he really cares for her.

XH2o1MM6aa	.Did you ever watch the "Get Smart" series.It was hilarious as he was a bumbling secret agent.You could have endless fun adopting a similar role.Where he'd have to accept total confidentiality about your identity.Or if you prefer a more serious role.Then a James Bond spoof would do.|`|e86df6aeda098a41020c4baf4c81dcddaa	doctor and patient.<br>  <br>  nurse and patient. <br>  <br>  cable guy and lonely housewife. <br>  <br>  maid and widowed man.  <br>  <br>  haha :D
7PqwM6QXaa	those girls probably have crushes on more than just you.<br>  Girls tend to be confused, well i do lol, cuz no offense but its hard to tell if a guy likes you, so we keep our options open. They're trying to be friends with you, to really see if they like you, talk to them more! lol when we have been trying to be your friend for too long, we eventually get the fact that you dont seem intrested in us and just move on to another guy.|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	They can both like you. <br>  <br>  I would say the girl who flirts with you heavily likes you for sure.|`|B4SF8sPraa	lol lol are you serious lol same is happening to me now these two girls i have in my religion class and lunch both like me but i kinda chose the one i want so this'l be awkwards muthsera!!<br>  <br>  and i know atleast one likes me becuase she was talking to a friend in our anatomy class about it and about halfway through she kinda made a comment to her friend which was a rather obvious thing... i know she bes wanting me..and shes gone get it!|`|pCwGPx0Faa	ahaha, you dont get out much, do you?<br>  i've made this mistake with plenty of guys. <br>  i'm way too nice to them alot, and then they end up thinking i like them, but i dont. normally i'd say it sounds like they like you, but since they do that with every other guy, i'd say there's not really a good chance. there might be though, i'd need more details on how they act. <br>  <br>  good luccck . x [:|`|tLyfneelaa	wow girls like flirting with boys its there over obsessed boy hormones talking to them there in the awkward stage were talking and flirting with guys gives them a thrill|`|F0NfKljZaa	Just tell them what is going on between you, them and your other friends.|`|MRODFWgmaa	They probably both have crushes on you and like to tease boyss<br>  take advantage of itt lol :]<br>  <br>  <3
FQ9BajGraa	Hair - it has to be nice and shiny, also it's good if it's a little shaggy but the country thing is good too.|`|qr2sKsy2aa	That they clean themselves up. If us girls are going to look good guys should also try to look clean by shaving, dressing nice, smelling nice, ect.

dWHSmESNaa	Hmm...I seem to ask myself this question quite a bit.<br>  <br>  I'd say wait until at least tomorrow. Or better yet, wait for HIM to text YOU--it proves he wants to talk to you and it boosts your self-confidence.<br>  <br>  It would help to know the situation with you guys though.|`|KbxJKaPpaa	I think you should send him a forward or just send him something like did u do the homework? or ask him something that has 2 do with school or something like that! hope this helps!|`|5uzHW4CYaa	Don't do it! <br>  Wait until tomorrow or whenever you have something to say next. Most people hate it when the conversation is :<br>  <br>  1 - hey<br>  2- hey<br>  3 - what's up?<br>  4 - nothing, you?<br>  5 - nothing<br>  6 - cool<br>  7 - yeah, so how are you<br>  8 - good, you?<br>  <br>  etc . . . <br>  <br>  wait until you have cool news or you heard a funny joke!|`|lldwL1nYaa	Send him a forward. Preferrably one that requires an answer. It lets him know that you are there to be texted, but like it's just a casual "Hey i'm sending this, not stalking you" thing.
PK5Elowdaa	If you wanna know the truth. In about 2 years, you will look back and realize, its the least of the worries in your life. <br>  <br>  FACT: this will pass<br>  FACT: Time will heal you<br>  FACT: You're not alone. You and millions of other people out there are going through the same/ if not worse situation.<br>  FACT: there's another better looking and more considerate guy waiting for you<br>  <br>  In short it does you no good to worry. Worrying won't make it better. It just makes it worse. Now go to the fridge and eat some ice cream. It should make you feel a little better.|`|l1zvTRVAaa	get help. pronto. see the guidance councillor at your school|`|iizKx4Bvaa	you need to distract yourself. 19 is a great age to start experiencing the world. Stuff happens and this is part of the journey. Life experiences will make you stronger if you allow it. open your heart your mind and make it about your future. No time to sit and think and drive yourself nuts.|`|36aPSk4oaa	I think you should start with your parents.  I mean, if they're fighting about you, it must feel bad.  Try to work stuff out so that at least you and your parents are communicating.   Your other problems will be less challenging if you are on good terms with your folks.|`|7sA8HwTzaa	You need to speak to a professional about your issues.

I want to hug u :)|`|MitVhIK9aa	see a councler there kid,<br>  <br>  (=|`|AA10882246	This is going to sound weird, but pen-pal.<br>  <br>  Okay, let me explain.  <br>  <br>  If you're grounded, it's time to have the "I'm an adult now, so relax" talk with your parents.  That's another story altogether.  The pen-pal idea works though.  Get online through Facebook, Myspace, etc. and find a cute guy.  I mean, there's a little more effort than just that, but find someone you can talk to that makes you feel good.  He could be 10 minutes away, or across the ocean.  Email back and forth or trade numbers and text each other.  Little things make a huge difference.<br>  <br>  Think about it.  If you're stuck at work and nothing is going well, but you suddenly get a text from (let's say his name is Brian), and he's being sweet, so you smile.  He's cute, so you kinda drift off in your mind thinking about how funny and charming he is.  Before you know it, your workday is over!  You're home, and in a great mood!  <br>  <br>  Even if Brain (or whomever you meet) isn't available (maybe he's 3,000 miles away), you still feel a connection with someone that makes you FEEL special, and makes you FEEL beautiful just the way you are.  That's a perfect remedy for any of those rainy day blues.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck, my dear.<br>  <br>  Blake

Your just into your boyfriend which is always a good thing :) I love my boyfriend to death and yeah sometimes we do things and sometimes i do think of doing other things but i choose not to. It's all up to you. I am almost positive that your boyfriend will say yes to anything you want to do with him. But YOU have to be ready for it. Do not just do it because you always think about it. Do it because you LOVE him and you know he LOVES YOU! Goodluckk!|`|KSK22vHUaa	That... sounds about normal.  It'll wane in a few months, and you'll feel like that with (almost) every new boy.

Beware if you play you eventually have to pay the piper , i did . I wasent ready to be a Dad at 17 but i had to do alot of growing up in a hurry. Im a Dad of 4 now the first was an oops the other 3 were planned.|`|wfE3mo7Naa	******* nympho.|`|Bx2w3h0faa	YES<br>  <br>  You are very addicted to sex at this point because you obviously just had your wildest fantasy's just come true? Wiether your a virgin or not, you just had something that was popped that you have been waiting for because its always on your mind now.<br>  <br>  And to be honest there are really few choices you can make at this point. Because you can either be "Clingy" to this guy and always want to get it on and have sex. And trust me you may not believe me but it will, and i mean it will get "Old" fast. It will get repeatitive, and before you know it both of you are tired of having sex with eachother because you do it all the time. You're turning into addicts.<br>  <br>  Or, you can take things slow and be a little positive in this relationship because if you really do care, and want it to last then thats what you will do instead of hang on his cock for your dear life like a sad puppy not wanting her owner to leave the door.<br>  <br>  And to answer Why?, ok how would you feel if you couldnt carry a conversation with someone because at the end of the sentence its always "Well do you want to? should we? do you wanna have sex now?". Dont you think that would get annoying after a while? and it also makes it seem like you dont even care about eachother you just want to "F*ck".<br>  <br>  To sum it all in a nut shell, you need to be in love if you want things to work with sex and relationships. Because if you dont love eachother its not going to work trust me. And it will appear more and more that way when your just have sex all the time instead of being there with eachother in a loving and caring way. If your not there for someone spiritually to make someone really feel like that you do care, then its more likely they are not going to want to have sex with you.<br>  <br>  Just dont be clingy, take it slow.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Oh, you young people. I don't think you are addicted to sex or anything like that. When I was first married, hear that word married, I felt the same way you are  now. That is why you are supposed to wait for marriage. Sex is wonderful in it's place, not for children in school to play at. The consequences and dangers of casual sex is exactly what you are going through now. Along with the dangers of Aids, std's and babies.|`|ntcETBTQaa	Sycho gf
fAabSnQpaa	No, you don't have to kiss someone you have been dating or really like for your first kiss. Your first kiss is just that, a first kiss. It doesn't actually matter all the much unless you want it to. On the bright side, you'll have a little experience for when you kiss a special guy for the first time, and that will probably make it better for both of you. The first kiss is nothing compared to the ones soon to come ;)|`|s0P4smC4aa	hey if you had fun, then it wasn't spoiled<br>  sure, it may not have been with the ideal guy that youv'e been dating for awhile<br>  but it's only a kiss<br>  as long as it's not anything further, then that's fine ;)|`|jJjfeylmaa	If you enjoyed it and grew from it it wasn't a waste. that's actually pretty exciting, always remember your "scandalous" first kiss! ;)|`|WQ3uCllqaa	OMG!!

Wo5Ezmwiaa	I say move on. This guy sounds too complicated and too wishy washy to have a decent relationship with. I'm sure that before he made contact with you, you were moving on quite fine. It's just now, with talking to him again, your emotions have become all stirred up again and you're wondering "what if". He dumped you in a really rotten way. Saying he slept with other girls, and he didn't love you. That is an awful way to dump someone. I'd return the favor. Stop answering his calls, change your numbr if you have to, drop him like a bad habit. If you want to tell him something first, tell him you loved him but you just can't put up with his games anymore. Tell your friends to not give him your new number, no matter how much he begs, and make a clean break from this guy. I say hope was gone the moment he dumped you, and it's not coming back. You can find another guy. Don't worry.

Yes, some people are like "whatever" about it, but to some of us it means much more. <br>  <br>  If he really likes you, he'll wait. If he keeps pressuring you, then break up with him. Do not let this chump treat you like this or give in because you'll just set a pattern for the rest of your life. <br>  <br>  Sometimes it hurts to lose someone you think you  might love but you're only fifteen?sixteen? You have plenty more time to fall in love and find the guy who will wait for you. Trust me!<br>  <br>  I didn't have sex until I was 22.

HOWEVER he waited until I was ready, which was two years into our relationship. <br>  <br>  Luck|`|Yz1qffV6aa	You are not sure that you love him, are you? Sometimes people mistake physical attraction to love. Any man who loves a woman would want to be committed to her for life, which is marriage, if he can't do it, then he must only want one thing and then he will dump her like trash. It is not really about saving yourself until marriage, it is about knowing the intention of the person, what is it that they have towards you, and this cannot be done but through that. It's going to leave deep bruises once you have sex with him and you don't last for long.|`|xijwHZrWaa	If you don't want to then you shouldn't have to.

JhvqUvlsaa	I think you need to take some time away from her and try to get over your feelings for her. If she is willing to be friends you have to get over your feelings for her before you can go back to being friends. I know it's hard and it hurts but you can do it. It just takes some time. Let her be the one to come to you and email you and stuff but if it still hurts then don't reply back; when you do contact her and she asks why just say you needed some space. It'll work out. =)|`|8QQzB3CDaa	I don't think you should be mad, but its okay to be upset.<br>  Just give her some time to think about the way she feels about you and who knows maybe she does like you but was maybe nervous or scared about telling you. and remember, there are plenty of fish in the sea of love :P <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)
xXRmY2tCaa	kinda hard to do but you can use words or motions, you can try to get them stirred up by talking naughty or doing a motion thats uk suggestive, but thats really all u can do if you are afraid to touch, if you want to take a step out of your comfort zone you can half hug or grab the arms, you dont have to always go for the chest
JlDcVTVsaa	how is he using you if you didnt have sex, and he is not trying to make you do any thing to him?<br>  <br>  I would just give him some time, he needs to get over what his ex did to him before he can have an other relationship. <br>  <br>  and when he is ready he will come around and ask you out.|`|kA7GEKf7aa	I think you answered your own question.

For a first time date you moved pretty fast for a virgin and it is possible that he was using you to get over her.  It is possible that he thought he'd get sex and didn't.  It is possible that he felt he would use you if he saw too much of you until he got over this girl.<br>  <br>  You need to realize that a guy who dates and has sex with a girl who is a **** -- who has sex with multiple partners, may well give him different kinds of sexually transmitted diseases and he could pass those on to you.  So don't rush into any sexual relationships.  Wait until you are older.  If and when you do have sex, use condoms for some protection.<br>  <br>  Why not wait a week and text him again and ask how he is doing.  But don't move into making out so soon.  It is hard to go backwards once you have crossed a line.  Making out is one of those lines.  He has to get over a girl and he could use one to feel good about himself without caring for a girl. So why not get to know him a bit more.  Do you have an opportunity to see him and just talk to him?  Don't go where you are alone so you won't make out.  When you make out, you aren't talking and finding out more about one another.  You need to know someone and care about them before you make out - not just a sexual attraction.<br>  <br>  Be patient a bit and try to talk to him on very informal basis in a public place.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.  Don't rush into anything.|`|S852p6SXaa	like everyone else said. your being used, hes hurt right now about the fact that he caught his girlfriend with another guy and he thinks be being with someone else will take his mind off of it or trying to get revenge on his girlfriend. and its wrong that hes doing that because hes acting like her, hes hurting because of her action and t hes going end up hurting you by doing the same.

I don't know if this was your first sexual experience or not, but hopefully you know how to properly put a condom on.  That being said, as long as there was no genital physical contact before you put the condom on and as long as it was put on correctly, the chances are slim.  There are many factors that can effect a woman's cycle including stress.  The more she worries the longer it might be before her period arrives!  As a side note, I became pregnant when I was on the pill (taking it religiously at the same time every night, no antibiotics, etc.).  There is only one way to ensure 100% that an unwanted pregnancy will not occur and that is by not having sex.  If you're not ready for a baby maybe you're not ready for sex!|`|XLTMtUEkaa	well um how old is she it is normal for a young teenager to be late,but not as much for an adult.|`|a1iam8Zvaa	well<br>  wait another week or two<br>  and if her period still doesnt come<br>  get more tests<br>  and see what happends<br>  how old r u guys??|`|HH90Eghaaa	Weird thing about a girls period, if she's worried about it, its not going to come!

Some girls tend to miss a month or two without having any periods at all.  Almost all girls miss their periods by a couple of days sometimes.  There's still a chance that she might be pregnant, so if she still doesn't get her period, buy another test and check again.  Remember, condoms don't always work.|`|467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	it is possible..<br>  but periods are not always on the exact same date.<br>  <br>  ask her, if it's normal for her to be off schedule.<br>  if it is, then it lowers your possibilty.<br>  <br>  have her take a couple more tests, just to make sure.|`|1vY2H6phaa	50/50|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Yes, you could have 50/50 chance.
GUUa1s6Laa	Sounds like she has changed and it made her happier. Realizing you are going to lose someone is a huge shocker (it doesnt work for some people until AFTER they've lost someone). But it's the kind of theory where you don't know what you have until it's gone. She just needed a scare to realize what she has.<br>  It may slowly go back to the way things were, but it looks like she's changed for now. But I Can't say for sure sorry.|`|43CAj5M8aa	It's a funny thing. People can change. Instead of arguing next time, just be honest and speak you mind. Be open about what is bothering you about your girl. She may have problems with you too. Nobody is perfect. You are both still very young and confused. Time will tell if she has changed. Give it a chance for a while and then see for yourself.
ca1562f9999b16755e6d5f797fb3b9ebaa	She slept with another guy, but at the same time, she sometimes thinks you're her true love? First of all, that's just illogical. And you sound like you're really nice and understanding to her. I'm not trying to trash her, but it sounds like as if she's spoiled..She wants the other guy, but yet she doesn't want you to go. She wants both you and the other guy. Also, she's having all those physical and mental affection for the other guy, and yet, you still seem to understand her and is ready to forgive her. In my opinion, you deserve a better girl. I think it's time you should move on.|`|89d3bf3b50a93d03e19347179f7c0974aa	Build a bridge and get over it|`|KGwpztjoaa	Dude---<br>  <br>  I am going through the same thing right now.  It sucks, it really does but just know that you're not out there alone.  When someone breaks up with you there's always alot of mental and emotional confusion but we all go through it at some point or another.  Go hang with your friends and try to just become friends with as many girls as possible.  You'll be fine man, things always work out in the end.<br>  <br>  Love you brother|`|a5b774126a207d8d38e9c6854bb56b66aa	way 2 long i wanna fall asleep but anyways u will get over her i got over my first love and i felt the same way u did but eventually ull find somebody that will make you forget about her she moved on now you have too|`|f9yORGumaa	I think once she starts sleeping with another guy...it's pretty much over. Especially if she says that she does love him, because he's actually there and so her love for him will be stronger than her love for you (who is not there with her). I think you should just move on, even though it hurts.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
NrbLdZzOaa	WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br>  <br>  You say you want his friends, but you dont want to break up with him. PICK ONE!!! This isnt a problem, you just can't deal with not having everything you want.|`|inN8hhsQaa	if your in a relationship with someone you should be complete dedicated to that person if your not completely dedicated then break up with him what your doing is wrong and your going to end up hurting him. so just break up with him your actually leading him on. so if i were you; wait scratch that i wouldn't be you because i wouldn't do that to someone but whatever break up with him|`|3df62cd5d4c4550eefa351b54399e098aa	Would you want a boyfriend that was wanting to be with another girl?  I don't think so.  The right think to do is to break up with him.  At least until you have eyes only for him.  But realize that if you hook up with his best friend you are heading for no possible get back together.|`|PFm1dI55aa	Break up. If it's not right, you'll know.|`|yTYEd6Ghaa	I think in any situation it would be wrong to stay with a guy or girl that you dont have feelings for anymore because it isnt fair to them. if i were you (and i have been b4 lol) i would break it off with ryan and be single for a while. you are not ready to be commited to one person so you should just have fun. you can also see how ryans friend reacts around you being single and around ryan but please DO NOT try to have more than one boyfriend cause it never works out no matter what anyone says! lol i hope i helped! good luck! :)
ZYOwcdVcaa	Here are my general guidelines for girls of interest:<br>  <br>  A respectable but not too serious attitude; not into drugs, drinking, or other hurtful distractions to life; a fun/funny personality; someone I'm confident in having a fun conversation without a backlash/drama; not a fake look or attitude (its easy to tell); someone who respects me for myself--despite my faults; not distracted on a phone or ipod--attention to me; a decent level of intelligence; and a pretty face/fit body would also be nice...<br>  <br>  Answer mine? :)<br>  First question under my profile titled "Would I be able to ask her out?"|`|2qLxnfkRaa	I look 4 support and someone who will do what is right. They must deny the superfluous carnal things and be honest. They have 2 be good people who r reliable and make me laugh. I would want someone who would sereve me well in a marriage, can keep a level head under pressure, and has an intelligence level so I don't get hit by the collateral of their desicons. Boys r pretty dumb so I need someone smarter than me.|`|c2dcd638f0c11bf57553715f0ad99518aa	in a girl <br>  i want intelligence above all<br>  looks personality<br>  and i want to act like she has some common sense lol
rIzx4OEWaa	Just steer clear why run the risk of having more problems, your ex will think you were at something before you broke up with him. It would also cause problems for there friendship so unless this guy has hurt you don't cause him any grief an stay away.|`|Eg1G2mvVaa	I would be wary, a relationship with him could cause problems down the line of your ex starts complaining to him.<br>  <br>  Just because youe ex is an asshole doesn't mean his best mate will be one too.  My last ex was an absolute tool, but his best mate was a great guy who warned me to stay away from him as he was trouble (I really shoulda listned).|`|a5b774126a207d8d38e9c6854bb56b66aa	u should know all of your boyfriends friends so dat dis never happens but i wouldnt talk to it cuz i would always wonder are they talkin about me

If you can't talk to him, can't work this one dance situation out...then you should stop dating altogether. Being in a relationship is all about communcation. Your bf needs to tell you that he is going with this other girl..even if its as a friend, since you cant go. You need to talk to him...tell him you know that he is going.|`|3ISGQ4Csaa	K so, here's what u do: you go to the dance alone, and when you see him and if he is with that girl, confront him about it. Plus he should have gone to the dance with you because ur his girlfriend. He shouldn't be going with any other girl, even if it's just as a friend.|`|KcYaPYhhaa	Just calmly go up to him and say "I heard your taking someone else to the dance... Is that true?"<br>  <br>  and then if he says yes than talk to him about it.

Then don't talk to him, forget about him, and don't bother about breaking up with him--this is his immature way of breaking up with you. You are worth a heck of alot more than this dweeb.|`|BBNhU5cwaa	dump him! he sounfs like a boy that will cheat on you if he doesnt tell you!|`|MtEZChaGaa	tell him to go f*ck himself.<br>  Wheres your self-respect girl|`|YgSrgTFzaa	break up!|`|6q3TQZFzaa	I remember my boyfriend asked another girl to the prom. And he was very honest about it. She was a (well you know) and he said he thought he would have a "better time" with her. He didn't. My friends kept "accidentally" spilling things on them, and when she wasn't cleaning off her dress in the bathroom, she was making out with his friends.<br>  <br>  Since this guy had actually been my friend for many years before we became a couple, we were able to remain friends for many years after this incident until we lost touch. But our friendship lasted long after we went to college together. I think if you have that type of relationship with your boyfriend, you can confront him (as I did mine) just to get it out of your system and move on without completely losing someone you care about. But remember intimate relationships don't last very long without honesty and trust and you don't seem to have either of those with him, so your friends might be right about letting this one go.<br>  <br>  P.S. The girl he took to the prom ended up getting really fat and having 4 kids before the age of 19, so looks like I won that one after all. Ha!|`|I7OqMnkfaa	I can honestly say its because he wants to explore with out stepping out of the cage. it really doesnt matter if she has a bf... im sorry... :/<br>  but yeah, guys like that little spark of fun in their life. dont take his crap, gorgeous. definately talk to him or, do what i did. tell them you want to be single for a while, and when he goes to the dance it wont even be that fun.. he will want you back. believe me.<br>  <br>  good luck. i hope i helped<br>  !! :D|`|LoHkeZ4eaa	If you really love/care about him then give him another chance. Holding back and waiting for him to say he is going with her is a BAD idea. Never hide emotions from your boyfriend, because they will just build up inside of you and one day explode and cause you to do something irrational and crazy like breaking up with him. This would not be a reason to break up with him, unless he does this all the time. Just try to forgive and forget and if he does it again, or if he does something worse, then u need to talk with him and tell him that you really love him and want it to work, but that every time he does something like this, it makes ur relationship less strong, and that you want to work through it. but dont have that talk yet. just tell him how u feel, and ask him why he didnt tell u. dont yell at him, it's not like he really did anything bad, maybe he just didn't see the point in telling u.|`|REoNMbanaa	you should definitly talk to your boyfriend, and not get the info from other people. just go straight to the source and find out whats up from him. if you guys are going out then you should be able to confront him about how you feel. just tell him that you were feeling jealous because you got the wrong idea from it, and that the only reason why you felt jealous was because you care a lot about him. this will bring u guys closer because you can open up to eachother and talk about your issues. <br>  Good Luck :D<br>     -Em

Say you've like her for a while but didnt think you stood a chance with her or something cute in that sense (girls like that). When she realizes you liked her along she'll forget about giving up on you :]|`|Yfjh6KdIaa	She's playing hard-to-get. Just confront her and talk to her. She can't avoid that. She is just seeing if you will chase after her. She maybe just but another girl, but you never know. Go for it! She sounds like a sweet girl and you should get to know her more. She just wants to see that you really like her before she even thinks about confronting you. Best of luck.

wYrS24e2aa	dude she is into you. **** just make conversation with her. You see I was like you in high school shy/didnt know what to say but there were many girls that took interest in me I just didnt do anything. That is bad. Because at the end of highschool and after highschool you are going to regret not having done anything. And me for example I am not shy anymore and talk to girls easily. And now I think to myself why wasnt I like this in high school, high school would have been way more fun. So my advice make conversation with her over anything. Once you get the ball rolling its easier afterwards. Just be yourself. Now this can help you or it can get you nowhere. Heres why if your true self is funny, witty, fun to be around then just being yourself will make good things come to you mainly pretty girls. But if being yourself means you are a douche bag who talks to noone and dont have a sense of humour then hell no you will go nowhere. But if you think you are like the first example then you're fine. And quit being shy it really serves no pupose. It will get you nowhere in life.

He has a girlfriend now so you should probably give him a little space before his girlfriend starts freaking out on him. Then he'll start getting upset.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Yes, why not..even though he has a girlfriend that doesn't mean she holds a place deep in his heart like you do.|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	Well go for it. What do you really have to lose?  And if his girlfriend gets mad, he should tell you, because it is the right thing to do.  And if you still like him why don't you tell him instead of hurting yourself more because you sit there with those feelings for him but then you watch him with some other girl, that is going to beat you up.  If it doesn't, because it totally would me, then that should show you that you really don't have much of any more feelings for him.  Be careful that you don't ruin anything though.  Take a chance if you feel like it, because once you tell him how you feel, and he has you in the friend zone, then that is going to be uber weird.|`|48HKDSR0aa	It really sounds like you like him as more than a friend but that he only likes you as a best friend material.<br>  <br>  Its nice to have guy best friends.

3KAiV9zTaa	I would fight for my boyfriend till the end of time! Me and my boyfriend have been through a lot seriously. On the 27th will be our 9 month anniversary. About 5-6 months ago he asked me to be his wife and on valentines day he let it be known to my parents. his parents say its okay and mine have as well so yeah. We're currently in high school now and i can't wait to be with him. <br>  <br>  As far as the struggles we've had, we went a whole summer without seeing each other and that was hard for us both, the constant accusations of us not making it in our relationship, women from all directions trying to get their hands on him, and as for me, it was hard for me to believe my boyfriend for a while when he said that he truely loved me. As far as trying to prove our love for each other was hard. sure enought we've gotten into so altercations, but we bounced back and we are still happy together for all this time. Now me and my boyfriend are really close. We are always together, never apart and whenever we can we try to show our PDA (public display of affection), no matter who is looking lol. we don't care. it just lets everyone know that we are here on this earth for each other and nothing else. Over the past few months, now our relationship has gotten so deep, now we are engage in sexual activity.I even lost my virginity to him. And it is a wonderful feeling when you are showing your feelings for the one you love.<br>  <br>  So let me tell you. Don't let anybody take away what you feel like belongs to you. especially your boyfriend. if you truely love him, fight. if what you have is special, then dammit make it a war and win! fight until victory is yours! don't let no other female take him away from you and don't let another girl make a pass at him because you know why? because you and him were meant to be. so fight! win! and in the end, taste victory and receive your salvation! i hope this helps you. many blessings.<br>  <br>  xxxx<br>  Lover at war|`|TuIrAXLkaa	tell him to get a new phone and number.

You're either going to have to recognize that your husband chose to be with YOU and that they're just jealous, or you aren't. Decide right now if this is a dealbreaker in your relationship, and if it is, leave.
NbpPWE3Uaa	well it is hard to get to know somebody that u have no classes with but if he stares at u during lunch then hes definatly interested in u or at least thinks ur cute.......good luck! just go talk to him!

xXRmY2tCaa	i have the same problem, if this is after uve been crushed, its cuz ur still attached to him or you think that it was meant to be, if this is during its cuz of the same reason minus the being crushed, you want it to be the perfect relationship, you think its meant to be and thus you cant keep it off your mind, if youve been crushed try to forget him, if you havent, try asking him out and if it doesnt work, cut the cord
2btGvJexaa	if you cant choose between the two boys then you shouldnt be with either one. You shouldnt stay in a relationship unless you see a future with that person and obviously if you almost passed up "ollie" for "ben" then I dont think he was all that great to begin with. I think you made the right decision, you should be the only girl your boy wants not a fall back.|`|93H9KLgCaa	awwwww. girlll i totally feel you im so sorry ):. dont worry its okay. okay first with ben. i think that if he really wanted to, he would have stopped his bad habit already. i dont think that he wants to stop, nor do i think he will. i think that hes just using you because he obviously likes you although this type of relationship is probably not healthy. i know of one of my friends who would do the same to me and i know that if he had a bad habit he wouldnt stop for me or anybody.you have to believe that if he really would like to stop, hell stop on his own time and would definatley do it if he wanted to but otherwise hes a guy and would probably not do it.<br>  <br>  on the other hand with your boyfriend i believe that if he was willing to trade you for another girl, then he probably is not the guy for you. i think that you deserve so much better than this. and that you deserve a gguy who wants you to tell him the truth and talk with you about anything and everything. you are a treasure. dont EVER doubt thatt! (: dont stop believing that you need a guy who is going to need you 24/7 and wont bribe you into a relationship. <br>  if ive answered your question, im glad. its up to you if your willing to go back to your boyfriend or not, but i think that right now you have done the best thing for both of you. and i really think that the other girl did the right thing too. im glad for that. i wish you the best of luck! dont get discouraged! theres a guy out there thats going to treat you amazingly well and make you feel so special.<br>  <br>  you cant stop looking for him, and im not either because lemme tell you i havent found mr. right!<br>  <br>  love youu!<br>  -leahh<br>  psalms 46:10|`|4Q5OwgU8aa	first off, the bad habit needs to be broken!!<br>  and secondly, if he's had two chances what's a third one gonna do? second chances don't always matter cause people almost never change. and if he was gonna dump you for someone else, but stayed with you as a fall back, leave his a** at the curb, you can do better!!<br>  <br>  good luck [:|`|bqllCJsTaa	High school been there done that. U see he loves you but boys are immature. He really does love you but hates to admit it so he tries to make you jealous because he's jelous. He hates the thought of another guy with his girl.

SCD6Pdtnaa	There are a few possible reasons:<br>  <br>  1. Models, actresses, etc. are often so skinny compared to the real-life women/girls that females see around them that it is easy to develop a warped sense of skinny/fat. It's hard to get a sense of how your own body fits in. Maybe she has a friend or sister who is even skinnier than she is, and though your gf isn't fat, she thinks she might be fat compared to them.<br>  <br>  2. Even though you think she's not fishing for compliments, she may be, even without her being aware of it. It may not be that she particularly likes hearing that she's skinny, but likes any positive compliment at all - and saying she's fat is an easy/guaranteed way to get someone to say something nice about her. <br>  <br>  3. If she's recently lost weight, or has gained a bit of weight, she just might be afraid of where her body is headed.<br>  <br>  Try giving her compliments (unsolicited) about other things. Tell her that her shirt is nice, or you like her hair when she pulls it back, or you think she's funny or a great person to watch a movie with. You might take her mind off of her weight for a bit. :)|`|VrmlehM2aa	she just wants you to compliment her.<br>  make her feel better about herself|`|gZoghJmvaa	Even if she keeps insisting that she is "fat" that could still mean that she is fishing for compliments.<br>  Either that or she's comparing herself to some other girl that she thinks has the perfect body. && she's probably insecure.

tD0nI64xaa	Lifted shoulders: Biologists call this involuntary movement the "cute response." It reveals a softer, almost child-like side to a person that's meant to let the other person know that you're open to them. <br>  <br>  Pigeon toes: Turning the toes inward is a sign that someone is both attracted and somewhat intimidated by you. They're unconsciously shrinking their body so as to appear less threatening.<br>  <br>  Palms up: A person who's interested will typically have their palms face up when gesturing or at rest. This act displays openness and vulnerability -- both signs that the person is friendly and approachable. <br>  <br>  The forehead bow: If a person tips their head slightly forward and looks up at you from under their brow, they're inviting you to come closer. <br>  <br>  Dilated pupils: If someone is looking at something or someone they like, their pupils dilate (or get bigger), <br>  <br>  Feet pointing toward you: People who are attracted to each other subconsciously try to 'line up' with the other person.

Of course I like it when a guy tells me that I'm beautiful and what not, but its kind of insulting when a guy gives off the impression that he thinks I'm nothing but a pretty face. And I like a gentleman, little things like hold the door open for me and stuff. I'm kind of old-fashioned as far as what it takes to impress me. A friendly person who will just come up and talk to me about anything really is nice. I don't like guys who are obviously just trying to hook up with me, I'm not like that. The nervous awkward clumsy guy thing can be cute too sometimes.|`|GUUa1s6Laa	Funny funny funny! I'm in college too and the two things Im looking for is smart and funny! Doesn't matter if you're average looking, if you notice some of the most gorgeous girls are with guys who are very average looking, or worse. And you look at them going "why is she with him?!" and it's because he is those two things, funny and smart. Confidence helps too, so sell yourself!<br>  <br>  Oh second thought, the best way to approach a girl in a college setting is definitely to talk to her about what you have in common - college. Better yet if you are in the same program or classes.|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	be your self ok

Wo5Ezmwiaa	Tell him you're sorry, but you've always seen him as just a friend. You like hanging out with him, and talking with him, but to you he is just a friend. That's pretty much the only thing you can do. Tell him also, that if he thinks things are too weird now, you'll understand if he doesn't want to hang out as much. But tell him that you're willing to put this past you and remain friends if he doesn't feel too weird about it. Feelings can come and go. I'm sure that once he finds another crush, he'll feel fine with just being friends again.

It wouldn't matter if you were over 18.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	He's a pedophile.|`|t2sTqzu9aa	Yes, just make sure you don't do anything sexual.|`|GpNxs1ggaa	depends on where you live , mostly no..|`|GF1PEO2Xaa	It's not legal until the 15 year old is 18. My bf is 18 and so we have to be shush.|`|ISN86YOZaa	Actually it's not legal. But if you guys don't have sex or do anything sexual then it's alright. But your Bf can still go to jail if he gets caught.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	No it is not!<br>  And I don't want to pay for your kid when he gets you preggo and splits and you go on welfare.|`|0VLirxVtaa	Nope...you are not legal until 18.

You have to be 17 to date an 18 year old person, and 18 to date anyone older than 18.|`|Wf8PbTraaa	no. i think the highest a 15 year old can go is 18....thats it as far as i know but yea the 22 year old can go to jail<br>  <br>  the only loophole is if they're not having sex. if they're not having sex then they're legally doing nothing wrong.|`|TAMGy07Daa	Nope, aslong as you guys dont have sex. i dont see a problem but it overall is still wrong, where do you girls find these guys?!|`|e1J4yrO2aa	what the heck!!<br>   no its not when your over 18 then your not a minor any more. <br>  <br>   the 22 year old can get in a lot of trouble!|`|xDOkuxOXaa	sweetie don't even think about it I'm 24 for god sakes i wouldn't want to go out with a 15 year old that disgusting! :x|`|ZyfilGjFaa	NO ITS NOT LEGAL ANYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

8FbOtXAXaa	It just sounds like he is a little shy as well or maybe even a little nervous around you since he likes you. He probably wants or wanted to come of over and talk to you but since your friend didn't talk to you for him then he probably didn't know how to approach you and so he never said anything. I do think that you should try to talk to him just to show that you  like him as well. You should IM him, I'm sure he would probably be flattered that you are talking to him and that might just break the ice between you two. Hope you find this helpful and good luck!|`|vu8JNSI0aa	He's shy, you should go talk to him

jCaCM3efaa	um, it's kinda hard to explain. like, you have to let your bottom or top lip go eather above or below their top lip so that one of your lips are basically sucking his lip. my boyfriend told me that i'm an amazing kisser so, i hope that helps. also, this will sound like nasty but licking their lip while it's inbetween yours while kissing them sometimes is really fun for them and you if they do it back:) hope that helps! good luck!|`|FnnyT1mlaa	I enjoy those slow soft ones. Gently youching each others lips is always a turn on.|`|231e2f619695988a9a2770ac10966cd2aa	if you have a kid together, im sure its not that hard to ask him again how to kiss.. just be like "so are you going to teach me how now?"

Do you think more time will really change things if they haven't already?  Only you can say when to say its over.  But it sounds like he just is not making an effort.
UKYDpztQaa	id say it all really depends. some people fall quick. and some it takes longer before they truly know they love someone. i think most people think their in love but its more lust or an extreme like for someone. to be REALLY "in love" takes longer.
XxuTil84aa	*hyperventilates* o.e "Luke, I am your father.... jk! ;D"|`|nXloT3Iiaa	The boy's name Luke \l(u)-ke\ is pronounced look. It is of Greek origin, and its meaning is "from Lucanus". Place name: a region in southern Italy. Also sometimes used as an English form of Lucius and Lucian. Biblical: a first-century Christian, called "the beloved physician" and is patron saint of doctors and artists, who wrote one of the four Gospel accounts of the life of Christ. Lukas is a Dutch form. "Star Wars" character Luke Skywalker; actors Luke Perry, Luke Wilson.<br>  <br>  Luke has 11 variant forms: Loukas, Luc, Lucas, Lucian, Lucien, Lucio, Lucius, Luck, Lucky, Lukacs and Lukas.<br>  <br>  <br>  His name is very common. What does his name have to do with it?

e86df6aeda098a41020c4baf4c81dcddaa	being the other girl, makes you a whore, no questions asked, unless you didn't know you were the other girl.<br>  <br>  but since you do, you are. so, that makes you just straight up low..<br>  <br>  but then continuing to have sex with him after figuring out you were the other girl? you need to wake up in your fantasy of him actually caring about you, and start realizing that he doesn't care about you, he only wants you for sex.|`|LYnK4xb0aa	leave him|`|y60FXLfSaa	Please don't waste your time on this guy. You deserve so much better than him, even if you do think you're in love with him. If all he comes to you is for sex, then that's ALL he wants, he probably could care less about the emotional pain you're going through. Just kick him to the curb and start looking for YOUR perfect guy. Hope this helps(:|`|AA10934463	im sorry i dont understand the question...but i think you  should think of yourself in this situation ..if hes treating a way you dont want to be treated then dont let him treat you that way ....wheres your self respect in that ? break up with hm if hes being like that and you dont like it .. no use wasting your life over something that takes 5 seconds to leave..Good luck|`|vjfdhhSDaa	Sounds to me like you have a low self esteem problem , If the guy's being a d*** and treatin you like sh** dump him and find a guy that-ll treat you right.

I think you should get to know him.|`|StJGeiFyaa	talk to him and see if you can figure out if he likes you i bet he does|`|ropZvmRDaa	I think you do have a good chance if he really does those things. Don't make your move yet, wait for him to give you some more clues. Trying taking it a little slow though, like for instance: <br>  1. Walk down the hall with him<br>  2. Ask him things like "Want to sit with me at lunch?" or "What class are you going to next?" Just try to seem interested in things he likes. <br>  <br>  It will work, I promise. <br>  :)|`|RdjyNxHlaa	Sounds like he likes you. Start talking to him very casually. Let it develop on its own.|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	Yes and yes you should.|`|gZg7JZnOaa	you first|`|gKhR0sgLaa	Ok, I'm going to be honest, he might lie you... but you can't tell just by whether or not they are looking at you. You have to talk to them, and I know it is harder than it sounds, but that is the only way to tell. By talking to them, you can also decide whether or not you really want to be with them.<br>  <br>  If it's in a class, than talk about what you are learning, whether you think it's stupid, or maybe even that the teacher is stupid. once you break the ice, it should be much easier to talk to them if you let things happen naturally.|`|JbTPuZtlaa	get to know him better first. never move to fast or the future could be awkward. try talking to him and see what he likes, and if you have alot in common and he seems to like you...

AW1dCzH0aa	Here are some things that I did to save money:<br>  <br>  1) I used DIY invitations from Target, DIY programs and save the dates from Michaels Craft Store (they also have placecards you can print at home)<br>  <br>  2) If you are planning to serve alcohol, find out if you can bring your own in.  Then wait for the Bev Mo 5 cent sale.  You buy a bottle of wine and get the second for a nickel.  It's a great deal.  We did that for my engagement party and got like 14 bottles of wine for less than $100.  <br>  <br>  3) I bought a used Maggie Sottero gown off of craigslist.com for $140.  <br>  <br>  4) You can find tons of leftover wedding decorations off of craigslist.com or ebay.  You can also find reasonably inexpensive things from Ikea, Walmart or Target.  <br>  <br>  5) Instead of buying more flowers, you can use colored napkins or table cloths to dress up your space.  After the wedding, you can make some of your money back by selling your stuff on ebay or craigslist.com.  Try this place:  tableclothsfactory.com<br>  <br>  6) Here are some examples of DIY centerpieces that would be pretty inexpensive:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/Hasbrown42/Centerpiece.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/H...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/Hasbrown42/CenterpieceIdeaV.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/H...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/Hasbrown42/Hurricanes.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/H...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/Hasbrown42/SquareCenterpiece.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/H...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/Hasbrown42/4in1vase.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/H...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/Hasbrown42/SimpleCenterpieceIdea.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/H...</a><br>  <br>  7) You can learn to do your own flowers.  Purchase them in bulk from costco.com or sam's club online.  Then check out youtube or martha stewart weddings (website) and figure out how to make your own bouquets.  <br>  <br>  Alright - hope that helps!|`|cQuRFvQYaa	DIY invites will save you some money, you can look at craft supply stores for the materials or "kits". Personally I'm thinking of doing a postcard style invite. Searching the internet for ideas has really helped me. I really liked offbeatbride.com.<br>  <br>  DIY food: get help from family. Keep the menu pretty simple. To make it easier get some food from costco. So menu ideas are 1.if its an afternoon affair you can do tea sandwiches with things like veggies and dip, devilled eggs, stuffed mushrooms etc.. 2. Go mexican and have a taco buffet and seven layer dip and things of that nature. 3. bbq picnic style, anything from burgers and hot dogs to a pig roast.4. the more traditional buffet with chicken, beef, or lasagna which choice of potato and veggies. Look into cupcakes instead of a cake.<br>  <br>  Its easier to match things if you don't have specific color theme, so keep it colourful and fun. This is fitting for a summer wedding. Google search paper poms, they are an easy to make decoration.<br>  <br>  If you have it outside in a pretty setting you don't need to decorate much. I'm not going to do any flowers at our wedding (I know this is almost unheard of) I've never really been a flower kind of girl, and I'm allergic to the pollen anyway. There are these really cool diy felt and button bouquets, they last much longer than flowers.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps a little bit!|`|8ygky5g4aa	I would suggest to use a web site like www.theknot.com or www.weddingchannel.com that has free planning tools including budgeting and time lines. <br>  <br>  Then you need to start planning with your timeline.  Since you want to save money you may want to consider getting married and having the reception all in the same place.  Or find venues that have package deals for the catering, limo, pictures etc.  It really depends on what you budget is.  You need to figure out your budget first!!  Once you've figured out your budget then you can find ways to stay within your budget.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|JrVhTyLdaa	Don't forget to order some sort of wedding favors for your guests. Many are available at less cost than making them yourself. You can find some nice ones that cost less than $1 each at<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.e-weddingfavors.com/catalog/Under_1_00-26-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.e-weddingfavors.com/catalog/U...</a>|`|bhyUX6kkaa	I had pretty much no budget for my wedding but no woman wants to sacrifice elegance just because of a lack of money. I had to get really creative. <br>  First I found out what people were charging for their services (band, florist, caterer, dress, makeup artist...)<br>  <br>  Then once I had the specifics I looked at how could I save money by cutting corners or doing things my self.<br>  <br>  First I asked a couple really good friends who I knew were creative if they would be willing to help out.<br>  <br>  For the flowers, after a really nice florist quoted me a bundle I went to this little whole in the wall shack of a place. Before I did anything I told them that I needed it for a wedding and I needed to see what they could do first. They were so eager to please and excited for the business that did a really terrific job. <br>  <br>  For the dress, once I found the style I wanted, which cost over $4,000 in the store, I found a tailor who could recreate it for me for much less. I found a guy who specialized in dress making for dolls. These dresses were so small and detailed that I knew he could handle what I wanted. Because it wasn't his normal form of business I got him to do it for $500 and it was tailor made for me. <br>  <br>  When it came to the caterer I couldn't believe how much they wanted. So I went around my city for a couple of weeks looking for whole in the wall restaurants that looked like they really needed the business. My fiance and I went around eating at them and the ones we liked best we asked if they would be willing to do catering. Again, they were struggling for the business that they were more than happy to negotiate a fair price. And, also most of the places had catered large parties before so there was no worries if they could.<br>  <br>  As for the makeup artist... I was quoted thousands of dollars for the whole wedding party and if it was just me then just $500 to apply makeup for an hour or two most!<br>  I found this great DVD course that teaches people how to apply beauty makeup specifically for weddings and private events. The course was only $150 and I asked my best friend if she would be willing to learn it practice and do my makeup if I bought the course. She did and it came out beautiful and now she works as a makeup artist charging the $500 to others!!!! I think the course was called the event makeup artist<br>  <br>  The point is you just have to be creative. There are so many businesses out there looking for customers and so many things geared to budget weddings. Your wedding will come out stunning you just have to have a little fun with it.|`|6BjZkRuYaa	Weddings are so personal - My hband and I splurged on what we really cared about - and "didnt" do the rest.  1.  We got married in at a botanical garden.  So, all the flowers and decorations were taken care of.  2.  We paid for a photographer to take pics of the ceremony - then he was done.  1/2 the cost.  At the reception we put disposable camera on the tables and got great shots. 3. Had the reception at a great country club, they provided candles, matching napkins to my dresses (pleasant surprise) and table decorations (little round mirrors)  good enough for me!  The great scenery from the club itself did the rest.  4. I could care less about the wedding cake so we just had the caterer cut up a sheet cake and serve.  Who ever remembers - or cares - about the couple cutting cake?  Huge expense saved and didnt miss it! 5. We made our own invites that were beautiful.  You can save a fortune on a dress - craigslist in my area always has never been worn dresses posted... and some are really gorgeous! 6.  Lesson here - Pay for what makes the day FOR YOU.  The rest - to hell w/ it.  We cut out so much stuff and had one of the classiest, nicest weddings I've ever been too.  Splurged on: Country Club (which actually gave us a great deal - pd as much as the buffet/ reception hall would have cost)  ask them!  They want to fill their rooms too!  Limo, and DJ for the party.  The rest was peanuts.|`|zYt0kPtzaa	Get your dress of ebay they are really good and well i got mine off there and it cost me $204.00 and that was too be made to my size and express shipping to me.<br>  or www.lightinthebox.com and they make bridal dresses from $200 and bridesmaids dresses from $80 they are really good.<br>  Ebay.com is a really good place to start as everything is cheaper than in stores etc.<br>  <br>  goodluck and enjoy|`|6dIJ8sUkaa	For me it was a few things.<br>  Invitations- I wanted pocket invitations and when I checked in different places they were charging me about $250 to $300 for the everything. so i ordered my kit for this website<br>  <a href="http://www.invitationpaper.com/products.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.invitationpaper.com/products....</a><br>  and printed my own invitations including ink the invitations came out for $125 dollars. There are some really nice diy in walmart and target for alot cheaper but i wanted pocket invitations and even the printable kit was alittle more expensive.<br>   <br>  Another one was flowers- After getting quotes from different florist ranging from $2000-$3000 I even thought of using silks which i didn't want to do. After much research i found that if i bought real flowers wholesale online I would be saving ALOT of money. After buying all the flowers online and having my cousin who is my coordinator on the day of the wedding set them up for me I would be around $700.|`|7efe69c2d9a0b4d3a0798d71a2f5ea43aa	I made my own bouquets, boutonnieres and center pieces. I used silk flowers and ordered them from save on crafts. I still have some left over that I will be creating a web site sometime this weekend. If you do not want to order silk flowers online Michael's and Joann's have a great selection as well as the dollar store. I also bought the invitation kit from Michael's and printed them up myself. I bought glass containers for my center pieces. I also made my own favors. I bought white plastic spoons and ribbon with my wedding colors and put three hershey's kisses on them. I also bought terra cotta pots and painted them red and put my name and my husband's name and the wedding date.

d3icrU62aa	just be yourself...honestly, any girl that's worth it would look past your status...being genuine is HUGE...rarely any guys out there that are genuine but it's such a plus!
OKIp6GsUaa	Talk to him about everything and how your feeling.<br>  And tell him that you don't want to loose him.<br>  I hope everything works out fine.=]]|`|pueeMH6gaa	He sounds like a bit of a half-wit.  Maybe you should try and do better.|`|JuGH3Rowaa	what you did was kinda uhh mean lol you dont do that and just leave him on the line at least tell him your not gonna talk to him and if you wait long enough you might have a chance to have to talk to him
qRKOWgS0aa	Have you ever wanted to flirt with a girl in class, but you never had the courage? Here are the basics on flirting with girls.<br>  <br>  Make sure you take care of all of your personal hygienic matters first. Take a shower every day, wear deodorant (Axe is preffered...but not too much! Girls love it when you walk by and they can smell a hint of it on you but some girls may not like it.), etc. <br>  Find the girl you want to flirt with. If you are sitting next to her, you can simply start talking to her. Compliment her, tell her how good she looks, etc. Just remember not to say anything that might put her off, especially if you've never talked to her. Just pretend she is like one of your "guy" friends. Don't treat her exactly like this or she will feel like you don't care that she is a girl and are desprate for a new guy friend. <br>  If she isn't nearby, try to get her attention and when you do, look at her for a few seconds. Don't stare hard, or she will be a little creeped out. You then can start mouthing a conversation with her. Do not stare at anything below her face. The eyes and the lips have the best effect. <br>  Act like you have done this before. Be sure to show you are confident, just don't act stupid or insecure. <br>  Be cool, don't stress. there is always someone else !<br>  <br>  [edit] TipsIf you are sitting across the room, and you catch her staring at you, make eye contact and SMILE and mouth a conversation to her if she is interested in you she will keep mouthing a conversation too! <br>  Likewise, if you like her, and she catches you staring at her, smile, and try to keep eye contact for at least 3 seconds. <br>  Just talk to her and don't be shy
ptQ5SkPVaa	Find someone closer to you. You're to young to be stuck in that kind of relationship. Be friends with her but to expect more at such a long distance is not going to work.|`|KcYaPYhhaa	Just text her everyonce in a while and say something like "Hey what's goin on?" or "Hows it goin?"<br>  <br>  Then when you get to it bring up camp, and that night, and then say something like "I'm sorry if I made things awkward."<br>  <br>  Get to know her a little better and find out when and if she will be going back to that camp.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Answer mine? <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArAup4Q9pGurydB.xKTdFpTD7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090220175359AAppUhA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|AA11285960	go back to camp this summer and see if the spark is still there|`|ag5fthVAaa	Aw. Thats cute.<br>  But long distance relationships are hard to do at your age.<br>  Try talking to other girls at your school or in your community.<br>  I'm sure you will met one just as great.<br>  You seem like a nice guy too, one that doesn't call girls hot; We all prefer beautiful, You will have no problem getting a girl.<br>  Good luck :)|`|nJezM2aMaa	she doesnt like you|`|XktkAZVfaa	Is she with anyone? It seems like it, or she likes someone else, you should find out somehow. I think that is nice that you are in love, it seemed like guys were never like that when I was that age. I would start to pay attention to other girls though, but still think about the girl you love. You have to keep your options open you know, there might be a girl you havnt noticed that feels the same way about you that could actually be an awesome girl friend. Something will work out in your way soon I'm sure. It always does! Good Luck ^^|`|TOPTB10Baa	I'm in love with a guy who lives four hours away and is in love with his ex.<br>  It's delightful isn't it? :|<br>  Haha. Let's see. I think you guys should keep talking.

Come on you don't want to regret losing your opportunity with her. Just be open with her and see what she says back, you never know. And if she doesn't feel the same what it wasn't meant to be, theres someone better for you out there.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And btw ??Parkl? has nooo idea what shes talking about|`|qlD3VuNqaa	try talking to her and ask her out on a date!

You're 14 I don't think you can say that with true meaning. Sorry but it's true?|`|I7OqMnkfaa	Keep texting her!!! you should get to know her agian before she forgets you!!<br>  :D|`|7H1al5u1aa	A girl isn't going to call you first. Most of us are very stupid, and feel like, 'If he likes me, he'll call me first...' So go ahead and give her a call, flirt with her, talk to her and get to know her. If she's interested, she'll welcome it. She might not call you first for a while, but don't give up or to suddenly assume that she dislikes you. But if she doesn't pay much attention to what you have to say, or if she just doesn't seem to want to talk for the first few conversations assume that she doesn't want to talk and text her occasionally, asking her how she's doing and how she's been since your last conversation. <br>  <br>  (: Good luck!|`|sD7d3Wgpaa	well, instead of interviewing her why don't you tell her about yourself...i don't mean all about you you don't want to go on and on but let her know what you are interested into, find out if you two have any interests together, bt i want to warn you make sure that you can see each other quite a bit because i was in a long distance relationship and believe me it does not work out! i tried all i could to make it work out but it just didn't. but otherwise just find out what you both are interested in and talk about that but mix it up a bit, and maybe find out what she is really interested in and maybe ask her to do that with you sometime if she would like to..<br>  <br>  hope this helps out.|`|nd5w7v4saa	I think if you like her you should definately talk to her.<br>  <br>  Ask her out, to dinner and a movie or something.<br>  <br>  If you still end up liking her maybe see how it goes , then move forward.<br>  <br>  but it sounded great until the part,<br>  she lives a couple hours away.<br>  that may be the one thing that doesnt work out.<br>  <br>  go up and visit her for a day, something like that.|`|AxC6WG7Naa	Well first of all I think it story is really cute! :) and all I can say 2 u iz if u r confident and u feel as if u were meant to be them go 4 her.

You've got your whole life to have your "first kiss". There is nothing wrong with waiting for the right person if you want to.
hSOYndoxaa	No, never stay with someone just because you have a child together. Being in an unhappy relationship with all the fighting and drama will be worse for the child then if you were to just break up and find someone that makes you happy.
1d709148a53b6e2e7a4c50cec7acddddaa	Yeah. Find a pregnant friend (obviously maybe hard) and have her pee into a cup with a lid. Tell your BF that you think you might be preggers and go buy an over the counter tester. At his place (with friends urine with you to use) use the test and come out ecstatic yet timid. LoL watch his draw drop. Say you will do it again to be sure and it comes out positive too. Let him hang on for a while before you let him know .. oops must have read it wrong.|`|y6v4ztM8aa	yo to the 1st comment. WHAT THE **** IS WRONG WITH YOU?!?!?!  holy ****!!!.|`|D2g0XSLTaa	Tell him you are pregnant.|`|V1a6EWG1aa	you should bake brownies for him and tell him its a late Valentines Day present (Or tell him whatever you want)But secretly add tons TONS of chili powder, garlic powder, anything gross that won't look too obvious. I tried this but the person wasn't that grossed out because i didn't add enough so add a lot!!!!!!!!!! It would be really funny to get it on video but idk if there's a way to do that without making it obvious and ruining the whole thing...........<br>  <br>  Another thing to try is putting a container of salt in his drink........enough said|`|PIIqTgwuaa	tell him to take his pants off and your going to preform oral sex. when his pants are off punch his Dick.
FkJgd8o4aa	Absolutely not.<br>  <br>  I worked as a cashier at a grocery store when I was a teen and my manager was always around -- being friendly, being talkative with customers was part of my job and we were taught that it was a good thing remembering faces and learning names, so I always laid it on thick. It was extremely ridiculous how many men mistook my warmth and friendliness as flirting.|`|KrpnKhFTaa	No. She is only flirting with you to make more sales. Don't fall for this! They are vultures and flatter your ego to get you to spend. It's despicable but that's what they do. I've encountered these kind of saleswoman before...Watch out! And don't give them your credit card! They will make unauthorized charges! <br>  <br>  I know you're not going to listen because you're in LaLa land right now...but believe me, just try and get her to go with you out of the store for coffee or a bite to eat and it's no go!|`|zTau6hDIaa	"Is it acceptable to go back to the store and ask her out?"<br>  Absolutely not!<br>  You should let me know what store she is in first, then I will go check her out & tell you if you should ask her out or not.|`|WQ3uCllqaa	Aren't they suppposed to be that way? Don't embarrass yourself...|`|gTS6xTO4aa	maybe its just cos aussies are really friendly people (i should know, i am one!)<br>  <br>  maybe you should visit the store a few more times and get to know her better before asking her out|`|nNYBhelGaa	No this is not acceptable, you are a man! lol yes go back and ask her out, dont be so uptight! let it all loose|`|0lQtTE9Daa	she was doing her job dont be desperate you just need more confidence. you could ask her out but honestly you probibly dont have the balls.
aLgY4l3Naa	Its still hurts because you really loved him, and to realize that everything you had with him was basically a lie, he betrayed you on so many levels, and its going to take longer then a month to get over this!Don't beat yourself up because your still going through it, its perfectly natural to feel this way!! This guy was a coward, liar and deceiver and eventually over time you will become more thankful he is not in your life anymore! Just give yourself time to accept all that has taken place because im sure your still in a state of shock, but just know that you did not deserve this and it was not your fault in any way, this was not your problem at all but his!! Be confident with this person that you are, love and respect yourself and know you deserve the best!! Try to keep yourself busy, do things that will make you feel better, read a good book, exercise or go for walks, spend time with family and friends who will be a source of support for you and most importantly PRAY!! Everything will get better my friend, just hang in there and just thank God every day he was looking out for you and allowed things to come to light before you got stuck in a marriage!! I wish you all the luck and stay strong from someone who knows!!|`|Eug52iQDaa	I doubt that you're grieving the loss of the relationship.  You're shocked and grieving because you have found out that any person can betray trust so easily.  Unfortunately, there are far too many people out there like that.  <br>  <br>  take care.|`|H7hHCHRkaa	He does not win sweetie he lost you and you sound like the better "catch" excuse the phrase. He was your first in so many areas so it will be much harder to get over him, sad but true. It will get better with time. Good Luck!|`|0LvWiESWaa	He doesn't win. He is obviously not happy or else he wouldn't have strayed from her. People who do that kind of stuff are very unhappy people. They are looking to fill a void that can never be filled outside themselves. <br>  <br>  It will take you a while to work through all of this. He was your first love, your first bf and your first sexual experience. He betrayed you in the worst way a person can betray another person. It's going to take you a long time to heal and you may have a hard time trusting someone again. <br>  <br>  Give yourself some time. Grieve and be angry until you aren't anymore. You will get over it and you will meet someone ten times better but, first you have to get through the tough part. If it gets bad enough, there is nothing wrong with getting a therapist to help you work through this tough time in your life. <br>  <br>  It will get better. Promise.|`|a8f5edcc140b36ea895725f1c1fa0ff7aa	But you win!! You walk away the bigger and better person. It sucks because it once happened to me. so i surrounded myself with good people and after a few months i was over it and wondered what in the world i ever saw in the person anyway. and what goes around DOES come around!  and then i found the right person, without even looking. and shes my wife now. and shes good to me and im darn proud!|`|zu6tMtnkaa	Honey time when heal your heart and always remember every dog have there day but good woman has 2 . keep busy stay strong your human and you have emotions that's why you feel hurt but it wil make you a stronger person in the end|`|FVhnOfxcaa	ok this is the only advice i have to give you. number one i am so sorry for whats happened to you, but one and a half years you can get over.  i promise u in a few months you will be over this.  people like him can lead 2 lives without any guilt or remorse. the same thing happened to me, only for a much shorter amount of time.  there are support groups for people who have been in relationships with these types of people.<br>  <br>  sounds to me he is one of these sociopaths.  hes a cheater also which fits the bill. this is not about u this person has problems.  the best advice i can give you is that he left you because you are too good for him. this other girl that is sticking around think about how LOW her self esteem must be to stay with someone that cheats on her.  these type of people pray on people like that and they dont care about them deep down.<br>  <br>  I know its hard to believe when something like this happens. you cant believe its humanly possible for someone to do these things, but these people have no conscience.  you will be destroyed for awhile because you cant wrap your head around it.  i say it takes you another few months to get over it.  dont let this guy destroy your trust in relationships because very few people are really like this. good thing is now you will learn to spot one.<br>  <br>  dont think of this as a total loss, the guy im sure cared about you to a point , the point that he could.  just know that in the future if he ever does get help, and even if not, he will miss you and know he lost a good thing.  but PLEASE whatever you do, when you hear from him dont take him back.  <br>  <br>  as for winning, dont let him, dont talk to him , answer his calls or anything answer his emails, go out get new friends, go to the bar...maybe get 2 jobs to keep your mind off things until you can actualy deal with it...hope my advice helped|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Hi.. i'm sorry you're having such a hard time, hon<br>  <br>  You know, even though you realize the guy is scum, we can't just toss our feelings into the trash after a break-up.

You will be in denial and angry... you will go through a lot of different feelings, until finally one day you will come to accept it for what it was, and it won't matter anymore.<br>  <br>  Until then, keep yourself busy - visit family and do things with friends, take up a hobby, take a class, etc.  <br>  <br>  by the way, he didn't "win".. losers never do.|`|NUOGcCBYaa	Because you were use to having him around, and that's why you feel sad,lost, lonely and depressed. As time goes on, the hurt and pain will  go away.<br>  <br>  This is your first break up, so this is all new to you. Once you have 2 or 3 behind you, your understand your feelings better next time.<br>  Your hurt because he cheat on your ( i would be to, who wouldn't?)<br>  <br>  And as you said he was your first, he is and was your "FIRST" in everything, hang in there and things will get better.<br>  And before you know it, your be well over him. And on the way to be meeting someone new.......................<br>  <br>  And in the mean time, as much as it hurts. It's ok to cry, over a lost love gone sour.|`|61Fwbi79aa	You are not grieving him as much as you are the loss of the relationship and what it could have been. And he does not "win" here. You are clearly the better woman. What kind of a guy "wins" with a woman who doesnt mind him cheating? That is a relationship that is headed for disaster. It sounds sort of shallow to me, as far as relationships go.<br>  <br>  Chin up, dear|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	You're not just grieving a loss, but a loss of what could have been. I'm really sorry this happened to you, it really must be hurtful to have given so much of yourself only to have it all turn out to have been a lie.<br>  <br>  The fact that you now know what and who you don't want doesn't make it any easier at this point, but it will pass. For some people it can take years to get unstuck emotionally, please, if you are feeling that way, find someone to talk to who has your best interests at heart.<br>  <br>  When you love someone, you make yourself open and vulnerable. It's a risk we take when we are hoping to find true love. When it doesn't work out, we feel this pain, and sometime say 'never again. But we do it again, eventually. We are only human, and we all make mistakes.<br>  <br>  Here's an interesting point for you to consider. Guys like him can fool the best of psychiatrists, so why couldn't he fool one of us 'normal' people? The ironic part is that he is going through life fooling himself.<br>  <br>  Remind yourself, from time to time, that you are worthy of loving and being loved, and someday, you will meet someone who is worthy of the love you have to offer.
14929d050f0d4920cb09fe344ab094b9aa	Yes they were talking about you, and they probably like you a lot. Next time go say hi to them and tell them they are pretty too.|`|s8S5FsgPaa	means people|`|AA11300621	they both think you're cute.<br>  get to know them :)
IzRdQx95aa	Hah, if air came out of her, that's normal...<br>  <br>  if it came out of you...see a doctor.|`|8cOstTBoaa	Ahem ahem, i think its called "queefing", and its perfectly normal.|`|Im4K2eFIaa	Totally normal. Happens a lot, sometimes not at all too.
AcgDcQG0aa	Being single and available is not enough.  You need to have something more than this to attract the girls.<br>  <br>  Having lots of money or at least a good job usually helps a lot.<br>  <br>  It's not so much a matter of going to the right places to meet girls as it is a matter of being attractive enough to girls who are looking for a guy.|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	haha agree with the first answerer. <br>  <br>  Go to the movies with your friends and find girls there. You can find girls anywhere, just look in the right places. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|71h39Q5faa	What kind of girls are you looking for?  If you belong to a specific religious or ethnic group you should go to events sponsored by those types of organizations.  if you are looking to get married you should look for someone who shares your faith in your church, synagogue, etc.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for a one night stand.  They have  a million online sites for booty calls.  Be cautious.<br>  <br>  If you are looking to go out socially then what are the local places in your area that cater to adults in your age range?  Near me during the summer there are clubs and bars on the waterfront where folks go to dance the night away and meet new people.<br>  <br>  If you like comedy some of the hotels have comedy clubs where you can go and meet people. Go out with a friend or two.<br>  <br>  Some of the hotels and bars have karaoke nights.  Even if you can't sing they are a place to meet people on the buffet line.<br>  <br>  Take up line dancing, or one of the others at a local ymca.<br>  <br>  There are so many places to go out and meet nice people. Good Luck.|`|lsv6wSUzaa	Put on your best clothes and colgne, and go to where you think people hang out. the mall, coffeee shops stuff like that. places you are interested in going too, and find someone who has the same interest as you (maybe you see them buy something that you like too?) and spark up a conversation. worst that could happen is that shes not interested and youll never have to talk to her again lol. keep trying, itll work out :) good luck|`|NS3BxXEmaa	the mall all girls love the mall|`|wIxRF5gNaa	Get off yahoo answers, go out with friends and find someone you lazy bum|`|RqFnyCVQaa	There are many ways to meet people without having to spend a lot of money. For the younger crowd, if you live near a college or university, they frequently have activities that non-students can attend.  Another good idea is to network with your friends.  They know you better than anyone. Let them know that you are available and are looking to date.  Many people try the bars, but often that turns out not to be the best idea. Alcohol can certainly impair judgment and it can get quite expensive.  Lastly, you might want to consider placing an ad in a few online dating services.  They all allow you to place an ad without paying, so it might be worth checking out.  One good site to check out is Canada 4 Date at www.canada4date.net  They have quite a selection of services from most parts of the world, including the US.  What ever you try, don't give up right away.  Sometimes these things take a little time!|`|C19VI48saa	Always be open to talking to other people, always. get yourself out there. you really have to start at a base with like guy friends and then kind of build from there from meeting girls that they might know. try to go to basketball games or track meets, and just do your best to get noticed. Its not just automatically going to happen out of the blue. build a rep in your school<br>  <br>  and if its possible, make sure to join a sport. any sport.|`|vjfdhhSDaa	The best place to meet females is the laundry mat or the grocery store<br>  if you do your fishing in the sewer your bound to catch a tu**, I-E don't go to a bar to pick up women.Trust your instincts and just be yourself .|`|5qQ2zbH5aa	Depends on what Kind of girls your looking for if you want to find some sluts who will sleep with you hit up a club. If you want to find an intellgent girl your better off at a library.
ZjM0ghSnaa	Shy guys are the best, haha. <br>  <br>  Anyways, Im sure you wont seem like a creep. In my past and rescent experiences dealing with pervs and creeps, you wont come off as one, trust me. Just talk to her, dont let her attractiveness (is that even a word?) get to you or make you feel that she's out of your league, or your not good enough for her. She can still like you too. Get to know her better. I wouldnt be freaked out if a guy came up to me and told me if he was nervous, and then asked me out for coffee.I wouldnt think that would be coming off as too strong. You know the girl, so it wouldnt be wierd. If it were a complete stranger, then I guess it would be. Go for it, im sure she likes you too and will say yes. Relax and be confident. Everything will turn out fine. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck:)
REoNMbanaa	nah you didnt spend too much. it was really nice of you and the gifts were really thoughtful. im sure she appreciated it alot|`|du5MNrQ6aa	trying to buy her love obviously.|`|L2pkns9maa	Money is no issue.

Reguardless to buy her love or what.|`|SBBNsgKfaa	yeah , do you see how persuasive and tempting are girls are? lol.
AA12321514	Ladies would feel as if he was there with them. You realize the importance of the person when he/she is away from you.|`|bO2rzfISaa	We just don't do that. I was offered a great job with a 30 day training class cross country. We decided no. I had my gallbladder out; he spent every night with me in the hospital, most nights in my tiny bed.<br>  <br>  My previous husband was gone all the time. I learned that it destroys a marriage.|`|X7i59NeIaa	I always miss my husband if either one of us has to be away for any reason. I hate to go to bed alone. I like to have him laying down beside me.

He wants me with him.|`|rH33ty23aa	My husband is in the military so every time he packs that d*mn green bag my heart goes through a tons of emotions.

cAqMoc5Paa	Birth marks are beautiful no matter where on your body, what colour or shape.<br>  <br>  Men fall in love with personalities, not faces.<br>  If the fall in love with your face it's not real love.|`|n3pSWkg0aa	umm, it shouldn't, if he does then he isnt worth your time, its a birthmark, you can't make it go away. and no one should be that shallow, but if it's bothering you then cover it with make up, if not then dont. idk how it looks, no picture, but it depends where on your cheek and how light/dark it is|`|DCnNSweXaa	If a person does not like you for a small imperfection like that he is a shallow creep!  Unfortunately, there are many of these in the world, but I am sure that will not prevent anyone from liking you and hey you got to love yourself before anyone else will be able to.  If the birthmark bothers you then you might take action, but if not probably no one else even notices it.  I think if a guy is smart he will look at you for your heart and you will not have any trouble.  Looks fade..|`|tcRpXd7Vaa	Not really.<br>  In a way it would add individuality.|`|gHbdC9xiaa	beauty mark, not birth mark :)

Also, if he were to... masturbate an hour or two before sex, it might help him to last longer.  Most times, the more you do it, it gets better... especially if he's young.  Approach the masturbation thing delicately... : ), try to do it in a way that doesn't hurt his pride.  Tell him you love the size or something, so that he's not thinking that you are not satisfied, as this will turn him off / piss him off :P|`|geuF7GsHaa	whats a minute man?|`|pIc6TiYIaa	how is he a minute man?<br>  the only definition of minute men i know was in my 8th grade txt book.<br>  *famous militia in during the declaration of independence called the minute men because they were ready to fight in a minutes warning*|`|klZK6UhNaa	Wait untill he's seconds man.|`|ARKyNCLgaa	call him crabtree|`|LgoBsjFXaa	Buy him a "lasso" at an adult aids store.

She's a bisexual. You don't just become a lesbian.  And no there's nothing different about how to do things with her. Just as you normaly do it.
2JouVEthaa	Yes, I've had some involvement with a guy I met at the gym I go to.|`|i2NqmsBeaa	Haha, nice question! :D|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	Nope. I haven't.|`|B4O15dt4aa	no|`|QhCy2009aa	Yes, It was a fabulous relationship.....wonder what he is up too these days?? LOL
C8DOT8Y7aa	Establish a more-than-just-friends relationship. Start by asking her for something to play on, like if you are in her class, ask her for a pencil or eraser. If she's slightly interested, she might play about, teasing you for it. Don't worry, it's not that she doesn't like you. She expects you to play along, so maybe walk off in mock sulk, don't do it too heavily though. She might start to think you are weird if you do. If she comes by you and asks you who you like, you know you are on the right track. They are probably just as nervous as you, so they want to get that type of approach as well. This probably means that they like you, and your job just got much easier. <br>  Compliment her, but be careful. Unless they are desperate, they might think you are desperate or making something too obvious. So maybe tell her you like her new hairstyle but then go behind her and mess around with it, spice it up. She'll like your courage to go play about with her hair but make sure she doesn't have dandruff or lice because although you might not be too bothered, she will get embarrassed and scared to go near you. Also, don't lay it on like you've seen in the movies: "I like your handbag.". No guy, in school, will honestly care about a handbag. Something you might truly like you can compliment on. <br>  Start a ball game (not literally). Be a little far away and look at her, admire her. She'll catch your gaze and look at you. Look away suddenly but keep an eye out for her looking back at you. If she is, get up and walk past her, possibly giving her a little smile as you go. <br>  Have chats with her. Ask her if she has any pets and find out some interesting things. Make sure she knows you inside out as well. <br>  Move in closer, be alone and look down. Look up at her eyes, look lost in her world for a second, and then say "I,(pause),like you. So...(cough)..Will you go out with me" While you say this look down. Look up when you say me and smile questioningly. If that isn't your style, there is another way to ask a girl out. All you have to do is walk up (make sure she's alone), and ask her to go out with you in a confident (but relaxed!) manner. <br>  Don't try too hard, girls aren't stupid, they can tell when you get desperate. Be relaxed and confident in yourself. <br>  Don't just become friends with her, become friends with all of her friends, as relationships are made and broken on her friends' opinions. <br>  If she says no, she means NO. Just back off for awhile, leave her to cool down, but don't give up complete hope. <br>  Be confident, not cocky. The difference is there, and very noticeable for girls. Make jokes and be self-confident; women love it when men make them laugh. <br>  When the time comes to ask her out, wait for the opportune moment. Trust your instincts; they will tell you when the time is right. As mentioned earlier, it's probably best not to do it in front of her friends or in front of your friends. It's easier for both of you if you are alone. <br>  If she says "I'll think about it" it's not a good sign, although she could just be nervous, or caught up in the moment, and she's being careful not to make a stupid mistake. Don't bug her about it, let it go a few days - if she doesn't bring it up again, it's a no. <br>  Don't ask her out as a dare, or as a joke - this can really hurt a girl's feelings. Be sure that you are doing it because you want to, if you don't you could really become known as a jerk. <br>  If you see any facial expressions, like an eye raise, make sure you say, "it's okay if you say no."|`|kUsm71nnaa	Dude!<br>    You  just ask them out and if they say no you just move on yo the next one.|`|BQwM1EEeaa	just ask in person.<br>  not with a lot of people around, cause that could be REALLY embarrassing and would put her on the spot.<br>  <br>  if she says no, dont let it get to you. just move on.|`|AA11650655	simple dude ..."grow some balls"<br>  if they say no then walk away and try another..

tU5NJVL3aa	But it IS black or white -- before you get married, you both have to settle on what it is you want with respect to children.  He's made it pretty clear, and seems to be wanting to move forward with the relationship under that assumption.  You on the other hand are the one that seems torn.  You are going to HAVE to decide if you want children of your own or not, and be very clear about it, then let him know what it's going to be.    There should not be any marriage if you guys aren't on the same page.|`|5jMNBO2naa	well if he does not want kids ( and you have to respect that decision ) and you do of your own blood, then you will have a bridge to cross sooner or later, and that means a hard choice, stay or go. The longer you stay the harder it will be to leave , as since it's a fixed issue, you are kidding yourself if you think you can change him, so you are better of confirming his stance on the issue and then preparing and exit strategy|`|be5b6f02c20b23ba0ebd00d8685794a0aa	I had a vasectomy when I was 21, and never had children.  Most women who I have dated did not listen clearly when I told them I had a vasectomy and was not planning to ever have children.  They took advantage of the ‘sexual freedom’, but usually aborted the relationship when they got too close and the reality sunk un. They were so hooked on the idea that having children was compulsory.<br>  <br>  Anyway, this is the ultimate deal breaker.  You need to consider the fact that true love is hard to find, and children are just vanity.  Everyone can make a baby, but how many find true love?  You need to think about that.  Peer pressure will say “have a baby”, but are you above that?  You can be just another “cave woman”, or “lemming” and make a baby, or you can be something more.  It is up to you.
ZZ1Q4zrIaa	It is his fault. He should have danced with you. My friend, Sholanda, was with her bf, me, my friend Jack and her bf wouldn't dance with her so she asked me if I wanted to and I said yes and he didn't mind. He is being pretty immature if he was crying. Especially if you aren't even going out. I wouldn't ask him again. Go with someone else.|`|6cc543542598d9c7bc967e59c411667aaa	go alone it's safer that way. then you can with who ever you want to and no one gets hurt.|`|FcD5gE9gaa	this is obviously middle school.<br>  6th grade maybe? something like that happened to me at that age xD<br>  except i wasnt crying in the bathroom .__.<br>  she was my best friend, who i liked at the time, and<br>  she just broke up with her boyfriend, so i asked her to the dance.<br>  then a day before the valentines dance she got back with her ex sooo yeah. hah :)<br>  but that was 6th grade, and nobody actually 'asks people to the dance' in middle school.<br>  f*ck the drama, and just have fun. god damn
Xh00k0TRaa	I think its perfectly fine for you to be mad. You should care cause honestly it has everything in the world to do with you.|`|P0wMTzDFaa	You should be mad.<br>  He's telling you not to talk to your cousin and you don't tell him anything when he talks to other girls.<br>  It's  just not fair.<br>  Tell him you trust him and it's not fair that he doesn't trust you.|`|eoQoCcz5aa	Dump him ........ Too much hard work for the Mind Body and Soul , or have about 5 boyfriends on the go if you like that sort of thing .|`|1EhbLBkUaa	If the relationship is based on different standards for both of you -- you can't talk to guys, while he can talk to girls -- then there's a problem.  Is he projecting what he would do in your shoes?  Or is he just possessive and controlling? Neither is good for you.<br>  <br>  In addition, that he would threaten a girl -- and in a sexual way, to boot -- doesn't say much for him either.

ff0e1c9782d175037d83406d22493c44aa	Well Danzgirl.  It seems like you're in quite a pickle. <br>  I think you should just continue on your path of friendliness and socializing with this specific person...and try to ignore the people in your class if they start to taunt you. (which they might. which will stink.)<br>  BTW: I think it awesomely cute that Tyler wanted to be your partner. :) He could've asked his little chums...but no. HE ASKED YOU!!!
C8DOT8Y7aa	Make him feel that he is special (and irreplaceable) to you. Guy's like their ego's boosted a little bit once in a while. Show him how important he is to you. Let him in on a personal little part of your past and share a hope for the future. Be sure it is something that you wouldn't tell just anyone. He needs to know that you think highly of him. Also, leave him notes and small surprises to show that you care. Don't be too forward though. Guys like being the one to take initiative in most things so don't over do it. <br>  Have complete self confidence. No matter what you have been through LOVE yourself. KNOW that you are beautiful and irreplaceable. If you want him to know that you have to know it first. Don't let any past hinderance stand in your way instead use it to prove your maturity in overcoming those obstacles. Also important is being the woman who doesn't need a man in her life to be happy. <br>  Enlist the help of your friends. This may seem sneaky at first but it doesn't have to be. Having a friend or two leave you facebook comments about how "beautiful", "amazing", "(fill in the blank)" you are sends him the message that other people think you are awesome and he should too. Be careful when having a male friend do this. You don't want it to see like flirtation which might make him nervous. The goal is to make him realize how perfect you are for him, not to scare him into thinking everyone is in love with you.|`|OaEcIiK6aa	ohh i think you know ;)

MilWQufkaa	fear of rejection and looking like a dork has stopped me from asking out so many girls in the past. You just need to psychologically slap yourself in the face (or literally if it helps lol) and go out there and do it. The hardest part is the ice breaker.

The worst thing that is going to happen is him saying no, which leaves you where you are already no worse off no better off. If he accepts you then you have gained by taking action. So you having nothing to lose and everything to gain. All that's stopping you is the limits of your mind, but once you over come this anythings possible.|`|aigFTh1Vaa	if you really like him then it should come natural you shouldn't be scared to talk to him. it is natural to be a little nervous when you first find otu if he likes you or not but don't be scared. if you don't talk to him he will think that you don't like him and then he won't want to talk to you|`|UUTjv2bIaa	i had the same problem with this girl at my school! she was just as nervous 2 talk to me...so do wat i did and finally go say something...u'l hit it off great!|`|mC2dRyuMaa	just talk to him wut u scared of hes just a boy
Wo5Ezmwiaa	Maybe ask him some innocent hypothetical questions when you two are alone, to see where he stands on the idea of the two of you. For example ~ "What do you think it would have been like if we hadn't broken up? Do you think we'd still be together?"<br>  Judging from his answer, maybe you can open up to him a little bit and tell him that to tell the truth, you're not over him, and that since you're now ready for a relationship, maybe it could work out this time if he wanted to try again.

And here you are putting all this effort into a friendship, while in the back of your mind you're hoping it'll be more.  Then one day, BOOM, she says "don't you think so-n-so's cute?"  or she goes back to her ex.  Cuts like a knife.  I know because I've been there.<br>  So imagine you're friends with her and her dating other guys.  If you're OK with this then I think a friendship could work out fine.  Otherwise, you risk a big-time crash and burn.|`|AA11880696	give her time<br>  she'll come around its just for now she doesn't feel comfortable dating and feels that she has to be single for a while<br>  just let her take her time|`|WvBgXv5daa	she needs a friend and with u there to the rescue, her recovery is resulting to u if u stay by her side and dont push her to going out then she will realize she wants you<br>  trust me it will be a happy ending|`|vBqIRHppaa	Just try to be there for her as a friend only right now.<br>  Then she'll learn to trust you and she might really want the relationship after a while<br>  :)<br>  Just take it slow.
48W167cBaa	Smile, and don't make her feel uncomfortable. Awkward silences and nervous habits from my best guy friend make me feel weird, haha. Keep the conversations going, and laugh at things that should be laughed at. Being sure of yourself is good too- but don't be cocky, or self centered. <br>  <br>  And most importantly, be yourself, be natural! Showing her your true self is always the first step- go from there. <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|9ionkBvuaa	Always make the 1st move.|`|dYChNv3Vaa	Be talkative to a lot of people, but not annoyingly so.<br>  And make sure when you're trying to appear confident you don't just come across as cocky and conceited, because that isn't attractive at all.|`|sSetS5CHaa	Um. Be a cocky perv.<br>  <br>  The women will tell you otherwise, but it's worked on every one of them. A lot.|`|R9ikVxzRaa	know what you are talking about and be sure of yourself-but don't ack like a cocky prick|`|dujGeZ32aa	be yourself....otherwise you might look like a joke.

Eug52iQDaa	You need to figure out why you're so angry, honey.   There's more going on here than you're telling.  Is there a counselor that you can talk to?  If you don't want to be this way, a good counselor can help you figure out why all this is going on and help you get back the person you want to be.  Sweetie you don't have to be nuts to talk things out with someone.  We ALL need outside help once in a while - to put our lives back in perspective.<br>  <br>  Knowing that you want to change is the first step.  Good for you!  I'm proud of you.  I hope you get yourself back soon.|`|VvRHin1Jaa	you need to calm down and control that anger inside you. also talk to her and apologize it will make you feel much better and help her too. tell her you care about her and love her|`|7z6BWoESaa	I am a Mother of a 15 year old and you would not believe how bad it hurts when he is mean to me, it is the worst hurt I have ever experienced, he has never called me a mean name like that but still it is very painful, and you must feel some remorse over it or you wouldnt be asking for our advice, go to your Mom talk to her if you dont want to talk to her tell her you would like someone to talk to, your Mother loves you, and she will be more than happy to help you, good luck!|`|Id4aSqrPaa	talk to her. if shes taking all the abuse she doesnt know how to talk to you and is scared to drive you away. the first chance you get... sit down at the kitchen table while shes cooking and ask about her day. let he sit down and continue the conversation. after the small talk... APOLOGIZE GEEZ... she doesn't deserve it and you know it. talk to her... if there is something bothering you. trust in her to listen, not judge, and maybe not solve your problems but can sure be the ear/shoulder you need... let her know shes needed :)|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	maybe you could talk to someone about all of this anger.  if you want help and want to do the work it takes to change, a therapist would be able to help you.|`|cOce5YbRaa	Maybe you are Bipolar sweetie. The way you describe yourself and your mood swings sounds just like it to me. I don't know where you live but I live in Texas and they have a place here that is called West Texas Centers For Mental Health. It is a place you can go to and if your parents don't have the money, you can get all of your services for free including medications if they put you on any. You go in and you have a person that is called a Case Worker and you can talk to them about anything and you would see a Psychiatrist also. I used to work for them where I live and I was also a patient of theirs also. It is a really neat place to go if they have the right kind of people working for them. If you are Bipolar-which is Manic Depressive-this would explain your behavior and talking to someone and getting on a medication would help you tremendously sweetie. If you don't want to go there, get with your Family Doctor and talk to him or her about this and ask if they think you might be Bipolar. Your Doctor can also help you with this. Don't beat yourself up sweetie because if you are Bipolar, this is a very normal behavior for Bipolar people that are not on medications. Talk to your Mom about this too and get her to take you to the Doctor. Then she will understand why your behavior hasn't been like before and both of you will feel a whole lot better about everything. It isn't easy being Bipolar, but if you will take your medications like you are supposed to and take them for a few years I have seen grown people that was able to quit the medications after a few years of being on them and did okay. Some have to take the meds for the rest of their life. Sounds like you are young and this is in your favor but get some help with this and quick so you can get it caught now. Good luck and I wish you the very best and hang in there. It does get better. I promise!!|`|2YR7Jr0xaa	dude just calm the **** down and stop being a little brat like seriously im not trying to be mean or anything but wow if your mom loved you enough to nurture you and care about you then love her enough to controll yourself dude try talking to her and ask for forgivnes ask her if u can have a clean slate with her because in the end you mom will always be there for you|`|e3ncFOfjaa	Ummm I think you should sit down and talk to your mom.  Or even better yet go out with just you and your mom and travel a lil bit or vacation.  I mean it will take you away from the nasty people, traveling will help you lose weight a little, and spending time with your mom would be awesome.|`|0kseszAKaa	awww. Try to stay away from anyone thats racist or has a bad influence on you. Hang with people who respect you and can help you. When ur angry write down ur feelings on a paper or do something that will take out all ur anger. And when ur calm talk to ur mom and tell her whats happening with you and im sure she can help. Feel good about urself as much as possible and do things in ur spare time that are fun, will keep u fit and let u forget bout ur anger. Well good luck :)|`|GcIcwHLPaa	You could get professional help...<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  Sit down with your mum and tell her all the things she does that sets you off and find a medius where you can both work well together

N1qKXDs2aa	you could try eating better. vut down on the fats, it won't really help you lose weight but its healthy for you. <br>  watch the amount of calories that you eat. (this does effect your weight) note that 1 pound equals 3500 calories so you have to do a little bit of work to get some of that weight of, but be persistent and fight it to the end. distance running and other cardiovascular exercises helps.|`|bL9APqogaa	I totally know how you feel! I am the same way! I am on weight watcher's and that is a great plan! It works! You don't have to do their exercising plan as I heard it is really intense. But to follow their diet is great. Eat  about 5-6 small meals a day. Exercise daily. Drink at least 8 cups of water each day. Lots of fruits and vegetables!

If he has a girlfriend though, why would he hang out with your and not his gf? anyways, since he told you jokes to make you laugh, then thats another reason to show that he likes you.<br>  <br>  By the way, that better not be my Edward your talking about in your avatar....<br>  <br>  haha|`|t2sTqzu9aa	It does sound like it, or he could just want to hang out with you or be closer too you, although I'm guessing he's probably thinking more then friendship =]|`|oifGKbyCaa	i think he likes u , but if ur bestfriend is dating him dont go out with him because your best friend will hate u...thats what happended with some of my friends.

707gOCvbaa	Regardless of her size he still has feelings for her and has not move on truly. You seem to want to place the blame on this woman by insulting her but it';s not her fault. Your guy is decieving you by hding the photos and he's not ready to give 100% to his new realationship. My gut feeling is to not expect much from him going forward and look for the signs that he might be doing other things behind your back.

BO14BwmRaa	Well I just have to ask you to please not be the couple that do the baby talk "I wov you" "Nooooo I wov yoooou" <br>  That kind of stuff angers me (ask the couple that I have a locker next to...)<br>  <br>  But My advice would be to tell him when ever you feel comfortable. Now you guys have been dating for two weeks and still in the "Honeymoon Phase." <br>  This means that you guys may feel in love but it actually might not be what you think. Wait a while longer and if the butterfly tingly feeling you get when talking to him stays I would say you have developed true feelings for him. <br>  But use your better judgment if you are in love tell him when you truly feel that he is in love with you as well. You wouldn't want to spook him away. But I'm sure that after awhile you'll both fall in love (romantic isn't it?)<br>  Good luck! hope this helps.|`|hSOYndoxaa	When you feel that you truly love him tell him. Two weeks is pretty early though. Most people dont know if they really love someone in two weeks.|`|AA11098273	There's really no specific time frame to tell him assuming you know you love this person. You definitely don't want to drop the 'L' word 2 weeks into the relationship cause #1. All the mushy gushy feelings in the world doesn't mean you love this person long term. #2. He might get spooked and think you are clingy and insecure causing him to question your motives. Get to know each other better and just be "Friends first" it's a great way to keep things fresh and learn to respect each other, that won't come overnight. Once you've had a few arguments that you've worked out together, then and only then can you begin to respect each other and decide if you truly love him. See how long you can go saying "I love you" without actually saying the words. It will have so much more meaning when you know the time is right..<br>  -Best wishes...|`|JMqZY4uiaa	whenever its okay don't be afraid to tell him that he will be happy to|`|T3cIiWuJaa	whenever you feel you love himmm
AA11982696	No you were right! Good job on telling him you cant make it. He knows you like him so why the hell would he tell you he has a date and THEN only ask you because you werent answering his texts. You did good, keep it that way .|`|sWEtd9aUaa	He's trying to get you jealous. I don't think he really went with her Saturday because even if he did why would he tell you when he knows you have feelings for him. I think he's starting to like you but doesnt know how to act. Theres 2 things you could do.. <br>  1. Go Sunday and act like you two are just friends and ask questions about the date. Like did you have fun? What happened? Act instrested and that will make him think to himself.. why is she asking me these questions. She seems cool with it. I thought she'd be jealous. <br>  OR<br>  2. Don't go Sunday. Play hard to get. Say sorry already made plans. Thats all. Dont tell him who or where. If he asks just ignore the text. Make him wonder.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped : )|`|rlfaVhlxaa	you say that you never contact him, but have feelings for him. you tell him you have feelings for him but then dont answer his texts. he probably got that date just to tell you... he said he had "low expectations". meaning hes not into that girl. sounds like a typical teenage relationship. just go out hiking and have a good time. if he brings it up then talk to him about it. i'm pretty sure he will. is going hiking really a date?|`|mC2dRyuMaa	hm well idk if hes not dating bcuz of a personal problem then y would he just ask this random chic out bcuz she asked for his numbr? thats a little low dnt u think but u should of went and made him feel shity about his date on Saturday seems me ****** up but he knows he hurt u so its w.e|`|EiQtzZHPaa	he was trying to make you jealous,good girl for not taking the bait! don't worry now that he knows that you are not interested in playing games,he'll ask you out again,this time he'll be more respectful|`|fAabSnQpaa	See him. Prove to him you can be better than whoever else he's "seeing" or considering.|`|876fed5d0d7a0e4f3cedf6316868026caa	Not now, you already turned him down.<br>  Guys don't like wishy washy gals.------<br>  Sorry, it's an honest answer.|`|UOSrSEqHaa	He's stupid for going on a date with a girl on Saturday but maybe he was trying to make you jealous for some reason. Maybe for yelling at him. Guys are idiots and don't make much sense most of the time. You should go Sunday and talk to him about the date. Tell him that it bothered you that he went on a date with someone and that it made you not even want to come hiking. But make sure to let him know that you really do care about him and that it really hurt that he went out with someone else. Just say what you feel, and I have a feeling you'll know what to do on Sunday. Good luck and I hope this helped :)|`|aT71jM10aa	no, I think you shouldnt have gone. and it was wrong for him to tell you about another girl right after you told him about your feelings for him and he told you about the other girl as if he didnt care that you liked him. so dont go with cux then he's gonna think your obsessed or crazy to go with him even after the other girl. I think you start playing hard to get with him and then he'll come to you and look obsessed. and oh, talk about other guys with him, not too much though.|`|wkcopSvpaa	okay first of all..... I think he is doing this to make you jealous.... because other wise he would have told you straight up that he only wanted to be your friend from the beginning! Don't let him get to you! Even though you know it eats you inside that he told you that he wasn't dating and now he is going on a date on Saturday! But you should not go on a date with him a Sunday just tell him how you feel tell him that why did he tell you that he wasn't dating and all of the sudden is going out with some girl that he just met|`|wYK4Ye2Daa	If you like him, I think you should go.  I mean why not? What's wrong with hanging out even if he went on a date with the mall chick?  There's always an evil coniving possibility that he's luring you into a semi-romantic situation so you guys can talk and he can tell you that you're not his type and whatnot.  That's pretty unlikely, and you have the perfect chance to win him over.|`|RIJDIeC6aa	I think this guy's a jerk and he only asked you out on Sunday as like a rebound type of thing since he doesn't think the other date is gonna go well. He's a liar and you're probably his second choice. No, you shouldn't see him on Sunday.<br>  <br>  Sorry if  I was mean, I'm just so pissed off that men can be such liars and insensitive people.|`|qqi2YlABaa	well guys usually don't like asking the girl out so he was just trying to tempt you to ask him out. you should go hiking with him and while you guys are hiking ask him to go out with you and ask him about how things went on saturday with the other girl. if he was tryng to make you jealous and just made it up then you'll stump him.|`|yOr4SOO4aa	I think you shoul go, maybe not hiking but go and see what hapends. Don't discart the idea that maybe he made the saturday night date to make himself more interesting for you... Yeap that's how guys think haha, anyways on your date you should ask him how his date went. Hope it goes well!|`|fWJwoMFSaa	no because maybe the date on saturday workedout and they're going out for real and make her jealous or you can go but ask his girlfriend(if the saturday thing worked) to come along with you guys or tell him or true feelings from the bottom of your heart|`|1ceywpfVaa	Yes.  You should see him on sunday.  Men work in mysterious ways (I know cuz I am one) and usually when they take up hints that a girl that likes them is upset with them, they try to make it up in one way or the next.|`|bbLkL3JNaa	This is tough. I would say definitely don't go out with him, but I don't know, because it sounds like he might have been trying to make you jealous by telling you he was going out with the other girl. Just think about it.|`|EHqsVwSWaa	He thinks of you as a friend and a backup plan. Is that what you want to be? If not, leave it alone. If you don't mind that, then go hiking with him and have fun.|`|KI0ABgXoaa	I think you should go and find away to spot him out. I've done it before nad its hilarious to see them embarrased after being like that. I htink you shoukldnt go because h's obviously lieng|`|ub6SPfpuaa	No u did everything right...u have to play a little hard to get with him it sounds like he likes that...most guys do...take control of the situation..he has way to much control...|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	if u like hoking  i wood go but if don`t collectible  about it i wood not go|`|pQWZNafqaa	You call that short?<br>  <br>  and yes.|`|r0BM2oEdaa	It sounds like hes a loser. move on with your life...|`|SRPh7SjVaa	You did good not going. Most likely, the "personal problem" he was talking about was exactly what he was showing to you. If you told him you had feelings for him, and he goes off with some random girl and has the nerve to tell you, he isn't worth it. If he says his expectations are low, he might as well be saying you're nothing special. He just doesn't want to lose you when he goes and plays around, mulling things over. Don't sit around and wait for him to move around to a new toy. And don't go to see him just to outdo someone else. He isn't worth the effort it would take to 1-up the other girl.|`|cP91ygObaa	See him. Because you can see if he still likes you and if he does BINGO.<br>  You have to think, even though he's going on a date with another girl. he must still like you. Why would he ask you if he didnt like you?<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. this is my first answer on here :).<br>  xxx|`|HY7CHX8Uaa	I Think You Should Of  Gone He Would Have Probably Realized He Is Messed Up For What He Did And Could Of Made It Up To You Well I Would Have Done That. Good Luck|`|jnktNA5Faa	maybe you should of gone to talk to him and get things straight. However, dont make him think he has you because he wont try as much. and see what happens|`|TjwKYY5gaa	YOU DID THE RITE THING....DONT WORRY|`|3y0w1qIBaa	I think it was wrong for him to go on the date with that girl on Saturday.  Maybe you should see him on Sunday and talk to him about this.|`|czmiYdjkaa	No, he was just going to use you. But trust your instincts.|`|467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	ew.<br>  no.<br>  <br>  he's lying.<br>  in some way.<br>  <br>  he goes out with some random girl he meets.. and told you that there was a personal problem before?<br>  no.<br>  i dont think so.<br>  <br>  leave him be.<br>  don't get involved.<br>  you will get hurt.<br>  <br>  you did the right thing. =]<br>  never doubt your intuition.|`|JH6oCuUZaa	Lighten up!  If he likes you and you like him who cares about the he said this and did this junk.  Enjoy yourself and have fun with him|`|Ud2IseT6aa	u call that short?|`|AA10975334	You guys aren't going steady, so he has that right to date who he wants to date. If he has low expectations, then take it at that.  he asked you to go hiking which means that there is SOME interest otherwise he wouldn't have invited you to go. <br>  take things a little at a time and if it works it works if it doesn't it doesn't We unfortunately win some and lose some, dating is tough and can be painful. Hang tight and stop worrying so much
dk8y4eseaa	I say he's fallen for you ;) So yes. And guys don't just pay for dinner, he must like you very much. Have fun.|`|ln1WGh3gaa	just a lil bit!|`|AA11353473	He's probably interested.<br>  I can't be entirely sure though.<br>  You should ask him when you see him, but make sure it's the right time.

wu2g3BtRaa	what makes you think girls are so similar to cats???|`|Cdp02p0Xaa	cat fights. lol|`|2zgv89OQaa	I hope that I'm not similar to a cat.  I don't like cats at all.|`|2xlreTaGaa	this is true..women are mysterious,sleek,graceful,elegant and so much more..just like cats..this totally makes sense now..since guys are related to pigs ahhaa|`|h46Oxo95aa	Tough question.Hmmmmmm...........................|`|GvYKQ0Goaa	LOL<br>  <br>  I love you baby <3<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  come home early tonight please..<br>  I miss you..|`|Ggtccfhhaa	girls dont resemble cat genetically...that makes no sense they are human being like you and me.....|`|gKhR0sgLaa	Umm... WTF kind of question is this?<br>  <br>  Girls aren't similar to cats.|`|ruu9Wdrkaa	what makes you think that??
vYoyGziFaa	I find that if I ask people about things that THEY are interested in, even if I am not, and let them explain or expound, they think I am a brilliant conversationalist.
osusVJk0aa	just be gentle and close your eyes<br>  =D|`|YxABWksZaa	just make the first kiss a quick one, dont try to make out. believe me, unless hes a total ***, even if you mess up hell like it and think its cute. if hes got any balls hell fix the mess up and kiss you back. but if it bothers you that much, this is what my girlfriend did to me when we started going out way back when. she just told me she had something to tell me and told me to get closer, then she kissed me on the cheek. do that, and it may lead to him having the confidence to finish the job. or just give him a quick peck on the lips before you leave or when hes not really expecting it. or try your best to create a situation where both of you are alone and just look at him when hes looking at you and dont say anything at all. just look. then kiss him. he may even kiss you first. lettt me know if this helps at all. like right away<br>  email me hahah i wanna know if you think this will work|`|4pX3bXzvaa	The BIGGEST piece of advice I can give is DON'T RUSH! Just stay calm and take it slow and let it happen naturally. Don't worry too much about your technique or small details. My kisses when I was younger was horrible because I would go too fast lol.|`|vQqf3aXjaa	Trust me, it will come naturally. I had never been kissed before, the current relationship that I'm in. And I was worried about that as well. But when the mood is right and the moment strikes, it will all flow so well. Don't be nervous. Just close your eyes and allow your feelings to lead you. I promise you, it will be FINE! Good luck girl, and I hope everything works out.|`|Z0b7pHyLaa	i knoow everyone says that kissing comes naturally, but it really does. once you do it, you just go with it. it's not something you think of while you're actually doing it, and you can't practice it without someone. if you want to kiss your boyfriend, give him subtle hints. guys always want to be physical so even if you try to kiss him i doubt he'd back down. good luck(:<br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220203716AAjsXzt">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>
k8I37Be5aa	Hey well I took the tom to read all of r story well I kind of went through the same thing with a crush myself and I learned after 2 years that she was crazy for me that whole time and I guess she got tired of waiting so anyway things happened then we moved on so I say that yes he likes u I meanwhy else would he smile and if he looks at u then that's means Ur  on his mind so get in there!!!!!|`|h1Abd6plaa	it sounds like he likes you.. I've dated a guy to years younger then me and i was 16 I didn't think there was anything wrong with it and I still don't regret anything.. But you better make a move befor its to late because then you will regret it|`|HIxqAJ6oaa	if he has liked you for at least a year and it seems like he still does, subtly hint that you have interest in him, to help get him started.
l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear<br>  <br>  It is very difficult to fathom any ones mind so the best thing is to communicate. Just behave normally. And no he was not joking you may be hot so he gave that opinion. And yes you are right when you say if a guy feel that some girl is hot it does not mean he likes her and wants to have a relationship. Tell your friend that you are not interested in him|`|0a3d8785f8742829b2a54e45eb88c0e0aa	You should try comforting her. Tell her that there's plenty of other guys out there, and it shouldn't matter if he thinks you're hot, and that she should just move on and get over it, because like you said, just 'cause a guy thinks you're hot doesn't mean they like you. Try getting that message through her head.
c282b658121c083eb61a50380f3c922daa	You're the best thing that ever happened to me.|`|GvYKQ0Goaa	Rock on dude!|`|Hj5NFqIQaa	I Love You...

I'm sure it will be fine<br>  good luck!! =)|`|nNYBhelGaa	just bump into him and be like "oh im so sorry, did i hurt you" and he will probably somthing back like, "no you didnt hurt me" and that will get you noticed<br>  i hope i helped
WvBgXv5daa	Well im happen to be a girl in 8th grade, and think if she says stop looking at me then is she looking at you back? you oviously both have feelings for each other okay! its gonna take alittle for her to get used to you, shes gonna feel like you like her even though you do, you cant like her until alittle longer and she realizes that she likes you and will ditch that boy for you,<br>  hope your romantic lovestory comes true beacuse it will!|`|CAf3ooH2aa	Ever heard of punctuation?<br>  Stop talking trash, go up to her and apologize.  Then leave her alone.  Hopefully she'll appreciate that you took the first step, and maybe you two can be friends again.|`|5MWDbW7paa	yeah... get over her. you can get a better girl. no reason for her to act like that. totally weirddddddddddddddddddddd. or maybe just confront her of why shes being like this.. it makes no sense of how shes acting.|`|llIxkU39aa	if theres no hope then let it go but if there is hope hang on to the love|`|c9e83377d7336eed482d84b85be3bf55aa	wtf|`|zEo5WT1Taa	umm... no comment|`|NVg06Egwaa	Ok, I didnt' really comprehend your explanation...but I'll do my best to give you advice. First off....in 7th grade Girls are just discovering that guys can be friends or boy friends. (I'm a girl BTW) and so it's an akward time for both. Serious relationships don't exist...but anyways. She doesn't seem like she feels comfortable around you...she might see you as stalker-like. And besides...she might not like you. I'm not trying ot dump all negatives on you! But you have to realize that people's feelings change.......and she might not like you. Be nice to her....don't call her a stupid little attention whore! How is she going to like you then?!? no offense, but if a guy called me that and disrespected me THAT MUCH they're WAY too immature to go out with anyone! You should never do that!|`|TrN7L35Daa	so you should apologize to her for being a jerk and ask if you two can start over. if that doesn't work then just stop trying because that means that she doesn't have a heart and if you still like her after that then she must be really beautiful|`|k7WUFZpvaa	Move on dude...... she could be using you in a jealousy play since she has a boyfriend. Some younger ladies (and older ladies too) like the sense of control that they can ellicit over men.|`|uXiKfK0Yaa	wow! u seem to good 4 her i wouldn't waste my time if i were u......from what i've seen girls usually dont act like tht?? at least no girls i no???|`|5488d65a5a874c153dc0083bb5fcb518aa	wow; that's just wired; for get her;|`|fRREBCxSaa	GIVE UP.<br>  if she's going to be like that, it's obviously not worth your time. If she's done this since the 7th grade (however old you are now) than you need to get over it. she definately isn't going to like you anytime soon. there's no part in that story that makes me think she'll change her find about you. my suggestion: find someone whose better than her and ignore her.|`|xyW8PsfUaa	Well, i think you should just wait until u two are alone and then tell her the truth. Often times honesty is the best policy. But be very sweet and nice. Good luck! hope i helped!|`|KpiCMmmVaa	forget that "stupid little attention whore"<br>  <br>  so not worth it.<br>  dangg girls these days.<br>  <br>  how do you still like her ???|`|UVscrbwkaa	Hmmm, been a girl.. i think you should calm it with her, and try and move on..<br>  She could be playin hard to get, but unlikely if she has a boyfriend.<br>  Just act like you don't like her anymore, and she will probably miss the attention your giving her.<br>  Girls go for bad guys and the ones that treat them like sh** and dont seem to pay attention to good guys for some weird reason.<br>  You seem like a sweet kind of guy. Myabe she needs to open her eyes to what she is rejecting.<br>  But the best thing for you to do, is probably leave her to get on with her life. Maybe one day she will come to you?<br>  Nothing lasts forever, she probably wont be with her boyfriend very long anyway.<br>  If she flirted with you in the beginning, maybe she had feelings for you.. even if she did have a boyfriend. <br>  Them feelings probably havn't gone away. They never do with girls :)<br>  Hope everything goes okay for you.<br>  x
PLpZRs5Kaa	she sounds like she has a borderline personality disorder...shes a brat is all i can say and if a girl acts like that even if a boy acts like that i wouldnt waste one minute of my time on them...shes not worth it but ur case sounds like the song "just the girl"|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	There is spell check.|`|qCU2mJ2Caa	ahahahas thats funny. attion as in asian? ahahahs .. love hate relationship? she might be thinking the same, like you hate someone but like them at the same time. you like hating them and like you like having their company around becaus eit makes your day more interesting and fun. just keep it up.. she'll fall for you one day! >:]
IJstP8wAaa	if you really like the boy, and breaking up with him didn't make the relationship awkward, then i would definitely take a shot at it! this happened to my friend, and they NEVER talked. so they broke up. also, the boy didn't want a girlfriend. so, if he wants one, and you two are still on good terms, then great!
0gvpklkIaa	its only 2 years apart... so no. A lot of "couples" have like a 3-4 year age difference|`|8FbOtXAXaa	Well if he doesn't like you then there is not a whole lot that you can do about it unfortunately. And no it's not weird that you are 16 and the guy is 18. I don't really think age is a big deal. Just try to focus on other guys or just hang out with your friends to keep your mind off of him.

hnpw7xataa	Hi Princess<br>  I am sorry your boyfriends such a jerk and has no idea how to make a person or girl feel good. If i was you i would tell him its over and move on, because if he loved you enough to want to marry you he has to accept you for whom you are. You are not being to sensitive about it at all in fact you seen like you are angry with it like i would be. I think his actions are so unacceptable towards you that i would break up with him and find a guy who loves me for me.|`|A9aB6vVmaa	He is thinking your attitude will be "If 165 is ok, then what's wrong with 175? Or 185? or 200? You should love me no matter what size I am."<br>  <br>  It was wrong for him to say it, but he is drawing a line.

My colors are deep red and plum.  I wanted things to be sensual and romantic like our love (cheesy) but it has worked so far.  My bridesmaids are wearing black cocktail dresses and red jewelry.  the tuxes are black with red vests.  My future step-daughter "flowergirl" is wearing a Plum/Auburgine dress that looks adorable on her.  My bouquets are a mixture of white and plum and reds and burgundys and so it the rest of my decor like linens, draping, and programs.  Don't worry about seasons.  The colors should be something significant to you, don't think Easter pastels just because its Spring, you'll have to live with the pictures for the rest of your life and you'll always hate that you had to do baby blue or yellow :)<br>  <br>  Maybe mix it up and use plum and lavendar to lighten it up for Spring.  Or just use all shades of purple instead.|`|F8iYNurEaa	The best thing to do when planning your wedding colours is to ignore what you think you should have and do what you want to do. It is easy to fall into the whole trap of finding colours to compliment the time of the year, when actually it doesn't really matter. I think plum will be beautiful and if you match it with a cream or champagne colour then you can make it light and airy and Spring-like.|`|6El0zpBJaa	Choose whatever color you like. Anything goes these days!
7wtytRtKaa	Yes. Most teens are like that. They think they should have a boyfriend or girlfriend because everybody else does and they are "of age". However, most of them haven't even had those "sexual interests" to want a bf or gf enough. So they endure the relationships just for the hell of it.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Definitely yes,but they are not aware of this ,we should form a group of people to spread this|`|DET61tGPaa	I think a lot of people are in these type of relationships. I know a lot of friends who say "But i love him/her," and i think they do, but i dont' think they are IN love with this person. The world puts so much pressure into you having a bf/gf that a lot of people think you should have one and date for the wrong reasons, It's sad|`|bdade993e630dbc15f1df344277bad03aa	everyone else seems to be doing it<br>  <br>  therefore, they feel that it is unacceptable to be single and see relationships as short term games rather than long term affection|`|1UDLn1Boaa	I think most teens are like that.  They just want to be in a "relationship" and to get sexual with each other.|`|kzIVGEfgaa	I wouldn't say a lot of people but some people are.|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	yes it wong to use some just for sex|`|7OYJ8Qa0aa	yep, pretty much most of the teens nowadays. they wouldn't feel confident if they didn't have someone to be their 'bf/gf' <br>  yet they say 'i love you to bits' and don't even know the real meaning of 'i love you' is<br>  wrong reasons for sure|`|gyhraargaa	mmmm .. i would say most people are in 'relationships' for the wrong reasons..<br>  but everyone has their needs, & if it works out .. hey! that's great.<br>  but usually if they're in it for the wrong reasons probably won't work out.|`|JcKwXCrJaa	I think most teens are like that. They just want to be in a "relationship" and to get sexual with each other.<br>  <br>  and all that|`|h1omg1IPaa	yes. most ppl are like that
aM1YxexPaa	There is a simple answer to this.  Think do you want the selfish gain of getting a bf, or the satisfaction of knowing that you helped your friend possibly attain happiness?|`|4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	In this situation I think you and your friend should ban together and ditch this guy. By saying that you're "pretty sure he like me," I take that to mean that he at least knows you like him. Yet, he's asking out your good friend anyway. That's a jerk move. I bet she sees it the same way when you explain that he knew you liked him and is making a play at her anyway.<br>  <br>  So, yes, talk w/ your friend. She's iffy on him anyway, so she may just let you have him. But you're concerned about betraying your friend. This guy was willing to betray you, so I would think that he would lose some of his allure after pulling something like that.|`|hSSBEEFRaa	I think talking to her about it is the best possible solution. But first see what she says about him, you don't want to guilt her into saying no. If she decides a no, then go after him and enjoy, there is a reason they wouldn't work out!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  -Sam|`|09uvIdllaa	well i would talk to my friend &+ if she was a good friend she wouldn;t get mad at u if u wanted to goo out whid him.. ask her if she thought about it yet...&+ just tell eachotha that no matter wat happens a boy won't get between your friendship so yeaa u guys have to talk it over &+ if shes not goin out with him then u have a  shot and if she is goin out with him then dont worry there are plenty of other guys !! TRUST ME|`|tMEUPBo4aa	Friendship Rule number #1: Don't fight over the same guy/gal.<br>  You should NEVER be the consolation prize. Hey, he asked you're friend out first ... which means, he is not all that interested in you. <br>  <br>  When/if your friend turns him down, you will be going after her "sloppy seconds". That's just not cool or respectful to you.|`|AedFEkcNaa	Talk to her about it first. Make her understand that you really like him and if it's taken her a week to decide, you dont think she's really into him. Just tell her your feelings than make the move.|`|3yjYj2pCaa	just do it<br>  and <br>  you <br>  know<br>  u <br>  want<br>  tooo
t2sTqzu9aa	You would get slapped, pepper sprayed, kicked in the nuts, shot or in the rare event you may end up making out with someone.<br>  <br>  It all depends on where, and who =]|`|D58bzW4Jaa	It depends if she know you.<br>  <br>  If she doesnt you better watch out...ur bout to get ur *** wooped.|`|e1e2e52546122c919c60181cb1ee1188aa	It all depends on the situation. We need more details. If I was single and you were attractive and a GOOD kisser and NOT a homicidal maniac, I just might swoon. Or kick you in the nads.|`|7sA8HwTzaa	It depends on what you look like, how well you kiss, and how she feels about something as spontaneous as something like this.<br>  <br>  She would probably knock you on your ***, though.|`|S7DmmIwraa	I"d punch you then kick you in the jewels and watch you go down.|`|e1J4yrO2aa	omg if you were good looking id let you.. <br>   and then it would make a good story... <br>  <br>  <br>                        dont you think?|`|5jQVj4Pfaa	Personally, if I didn't know you at all, I'd slap you and then ***** you out. If you really freaked me out, I'd probably knee-jab you right in the crotch. Unless the girl's one of those ones that just accepts it and is like "okay... what do you want and who are you?" All depends on the person, but I just wouldn't try it anyway. Bad idea.|`|rlkWrJlGaa	ehm that happened to me once at my first dance. I didnt know what to say he was cute, but i mean he wasnt in a relationship with me. I kinda pushed him away and my boyfriend kicked him where it hurt. :P|`|xDOkuxOXaa	woha dude don't go to fast the girl needs to talk with you to get to know each other and then that's where the big kiss!!!! :))|`|ytdgp3sHaa	uhh she would probably slap you in the face or run away haha  or if she liked you she would kiss you back lol|`|Yz1qffV6aa	Report sexual assault.|`|n1kVcQBvaa	they would call the cops.|`|XcgcE3Cjaa	if you are a cutie then id laugh and say give me another! LMAO!!|`|yfGvXftfaa	IDK .... slap him ? or kiss him back ?? it depends .....|`|0oe4MSWBaa	i would say hey where do you wnna **** babe<br>  you want some more of this ? come and get it (;|`|8kek6Nqpaa	personally, i would slap u
ZjM0ghSnaa	Why dont you ask him for help on a subject your not good at? or, pretend that your not good at it. That way, he'll have to help you and you two get a chance to talk. <br>  <br>  If he likes sports, find put what his favorite team is. Ask him if he watched last nights game and ask who won, or what his opinions were on it. <br>  You can talk to him on anything, dont worry. <br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|uU28jSyeaa	ok what you can do is go up to him when he's not with anyone and just ask him couple of questions that's you think he might what to answer like: so how has your day been,so if you aren't doing anything this weekend do you want to hang out. things like that and then if things go good from there you'll never know he might just ask you to be his girlfriend and when he does ask you that question think about it for like 4 seconds and then say " YES"!!|`|2KBtd1Dhaa	I would just be natural. Guys want to be a girl's friend before dating her, or at least know her as a person. Only the shallowest guys go for looks and looks alone. Make conversation. Make him laugh!!|`|vZA5B36qaa	Just Say Hey Whats up or something!!!
PoYFQ7Mxaa	You're very cute|`|hvJ3rQfFaa	I don't know....I don't judge by first impressions|`|tWSYjZMWaa	whats not 2 like. u have it all|`|sLWC6vEmaa	youre pretty =)<br>  <br>  id give you an 8 out of 10!|`|35ae746aae90d4f0ba10e9f5ecba492baa	Your pretty and unique.  You have something which we don't.  You are a great blessing to everyone soon...
CHF7VtElaa	you just have to trust them until they give you a reason not to. i was like that and found that it only hurt my relationship more.|`|QNGzjvRKaa	You have to take that chance or stay alone.|`|5n13XFuhaa	Well, you have just got to gain the trust over time. Not everyone is untrustworrthy :)|`|qxYlOxXHaa	If you are having trust issues because of being hurt in the past the first question you may want to ask yourself is "Is this person similar to anyone from my past"?  Are you picking the same type of person over and over again.  I did it for many, many years.  Basically I set myself up to get burned and hurt.  When I started dating my husband he didn't look like anyone from my past nor acted like anyone that I wanted from my past.  I knew within a month that we would get married because I decided that even though he was different that was what I chose to want.  It was scarey but we have been married for 13 years and he is very devoted to me.  You have to learn to keep your eyes open and look for signals that may be repeating themselves.  If you keep your heart and especially your eyes open than you will trust again.  Be slow to give the trust and let the person gain it.  don't give it too soon in the relationship.  Be secure within yourself first.  You are what you attract.|`|LgiMl11vaa	you just have to gain their trust. im going through the same problems. but you just have to take down your walls. not everyone is gonna hurt you, beleive it or not. there's gonna be one person who fixes it all and makes it all worth it. you just have to put yourself out there, which is a scary thing, but it seems like you've already done the hardest part!! so congrats!:) lol
viBopoGTaa	It doesn't matter about looks. I'm dating a guy who has a lower reputation as me and doesn't have that much good of looks, but I never cared. It's the personality that counts.|`|UaIR316oaa	who cares what he looks like <br>  i think that should not have even crossed your mind<br>  hes sweet and nice and likes you<br>  where is the problem?<br>  and if your friends are stupid enough to point that out well ... that's just rude...<br>   and to be honest i think that's a sucky question to ask. like how would you feel if you were going on yahoo answers and you found this question about you!|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	date him who cares what your friends think|`|8wi2X5sSaa	i think u should give him a chance. who cares what your friends think. either way, they're probably gonna accept any answer that would come from you. if this guy makes u happy, and i mean like u can spend a lot of ur time with him and not get bored then yeah. good luck!|`|JINK3IHiaa	do you like him? then say yea.<br>  If you dont like him say no.<br>  Dont peer pressure if you do like him, say yes and dont care about your friends.|`|wYOAY4RPaa	Oh gosh, sweet, kind and funny? or handsome, mean and hateful !! I wish I would have known the answer to this one before I got married!!|`|rGM8Neqgaa	As long as you're happy, it doesn't matter what the other people think. =)|`|AI2VoFP4aa	dont get wrapped up in what other ppl think all that matters is what you think about him. trust me sometimes some of the most attractive guys can be the biggest asses, when guys get to a certain age and they know that theyre attractive they let it go to their heads. this may not be a love connection but theres no harm in it if nothing else youve got a good guy friend with a great personality.|`|M85hL2eCaa	ok first off all he doesnt have to be the most handsomest guy in the world and second of all dont always listen to your friends they may not like him but they have diffrent taste then you and if u like him go for it. i mean he likes you not then soo who care what they think as long as you like him then go fo it....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope that helps...|`|EqqXpzvVaa	If you like him date him, if you don't then don't.  Your friends shouldn't be a variable on who you date.
pYCHnlnsaa	Boy says he doesn't like you? I have had the same experience. I had a guy friend, and he acted as you say your crush acts, and yet he had told me he liked me as friends only. I confronted him though, and came straight out telling him I liked him. It turns out, he was shy and thought I didn't like him, and he was afraid to tell me, but he did like me. We are now dating. <br>  <br>  Boys are weird, and when you ask them about their feelings they will more than likely lie. From what it seems, he does like you, but he isn't positive if you like him, so he won't admit it to you. Just confront him and tell him your real feelings and see how he feels about it. I wish you all the luck with this guy. It is always great to find the guy you have been wanting.|`|x1FzJLwZaa	ask him if he likes you so you 2 could go on a date and live happily ever after|`|YmspJewvaa	why are you so sure he doesn't like you?<br>  then maybe, he is just trying to flirt with any girl he encounters.|`|AjBpAPpdaa	He does like you he just doesnt want you to know, he's afraid it may ruin your friendship i assume,|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	He likes you, he just doesn't want to admit it.
VgiUGqxtaa	YESSSS!!<br>  <br>  My speciality..Shy stuff<br>  <br>  Ok coming from a shy guy, look out for these things:<br>  <br>  talks 2 u, but when ppl around, goes quiet. (Like he can be really chatty when he's with you. meaning he trusts u enough 2 b himself, but then when others are around, you see him go quiet)<br>  <br>  u always find him looking @ u, until you look @ him<br>  <br>  Those r the main signs 2 look 4..If none of that, then yeah..,,,<br>  <br>  My advice, just go out on a limp & ask him out, if he likes you, even if he's shy, he'll agree.<br>  <br>  Also, what the guy uptop said -> kiss him n run, the next day..he'll braven up!!!<br>  <br>  (i know braven aint a word)|`|JCVs8W6raa	Shy guy like me like it slowly tell him that you like him then quick kiss him and then runaway next day he will come to you?try it believe will success.
TJiGs8S4aa	You need to ask a bunch of total strangers what your feelings should be?  Yeesh.  I think you should use your head to figure out which person is the most sensible one to focus on - it's really pretty obvious, isn't it?  Unless you think jerks are fine, as long as they are *hot* jerks?|`|CBa9G4j4aa	The good guy. The bad guy will probably end up hurting you and the class clown will probably crack jokes about you behind your back to his friends.|`|Wg0VteZ9aa	obviously not the bad guy. The class clown also sounds like a jerk. From what you put on there i would say the good guy.|`|y9FSY7mTaa	The nice guy,because the "bad guy" would probably get you into trouble with some stuff and the class clowns are normally people who are obsessed with attention and try their hardest to get it if you date the class clown he will be with you 24/7 and most likely stalk you the nice guy is probably the way to go|`|fS8joiTaaa	The clown i like being funny and i like funny people they are more entertaining than bad kids and good kids.|`|FcqDWdF1aa	The good guy or the clown.|`|K1uUvEcWaa	THE GOOD GUY<br>  definatley<br>  i mean the class clown cracks rude jokes, thats kinda mean, what if he does that to you one day? that would be horrible, and as it goes for "hot" who cares, you wont be happy with someone rude.<br>  and the "bad guy" and you dont want a dirty minded guy unless you are like that took, but then he would pressure you to do things you might not want to do.<br>  and the good guy since he is sweet nice funny and is never really mean how could you beat that? thats the perfect combination.<br>  sorry for this being long but yeah. :]|`|5WYpSBFYaa	You NEED to like the GOOD one.<br>  I've been with the class clown before, he couldn't take the relationship seriously.<br>  And I've been with the bad boy, many many times, you're just going to get hurt. Believe me.<br>  Pick the good guy, cause there's millions of girls wishing they had a guy like him.|`|rWoaRdljaa	isn't that up to you?
Eg1G2mvVaa	I am friends with my bf's ex, I personally would not take it as a good sign if his exes ran at the sight of him.|`|OyLIIN7zaa	hey  ------------------> you've got an easy in: familarity.   But once you're in it gets sticky.  There is never just the two, there is always the third whom both of you know, who is left out and stranded. jealousy wrecks that relationship and it all end up in a mess.<br>  <br>  Take it from me.
t4ODLJ7raa	wait after marriege
wqgEo3gyaa	Most guys, that are worth dating, don't like a flirt.  Play it like you are, maybe a little hard to get, but act like it doesn't matter to you.  Just be a wonderful friend, and see what happens.  Your best friend is most likely making a fool of herself in front of this guy, and he knows, but is polite enough to let it slide.
Po8jDnX2aa	id be like whatever if shes hot but i wouldnt go out with a chick that looks like she got slapped in the face with a slice of pizza lol!!|`|nmjLXZxzaa	i have acne, its not much but you can tell when i flip my hair<br>  <br>  my bf doesnt care.
KhyPqoFIaa	Hello there, i am the surfer <br>  <br>  You did not mention te quality and time of the relationship<br>  It was best for both of you for the ending, if there was not ending things would go down hill from there on!<br>  You did not mention how the break - up was: like friendly or worse <br>  Are you friends with him? <br>  I deduce that you see him on a regular basis <br>  <br>  As for your feelings, those are going to stay there for a time, it′s not like removing a tree from the foundation<br>  <br>  As to being sad all the time, do things  that make you happy! like listen to your favorite music, do your favorite hobby, go to movies, reconnect with your friends, pamper yourself more, do other thing like you had not try before!<br>  <br>  As for getting him back, think if the relationships was worth saving! my guess from here is that he was the one who started the conversation oriented towards the break up like: we need to talk! ( you never said it was you doing the break up!) <br>  <br>  Analise the lesson you had learned from him, recall the mistakes he made as way and motive to move on and do move on!<br>  <br>  Go to www.youtube.com and watch the video from Julieta Venegas : me voy it′s about dumping the bf for a better life! it does help<br>  <br>  Put into a paper everything the relationship meant for you and attach the paper to a balloon  of hidrogen a let it fly away!<br>  <br>  Before going to bed and after wake up every morning read to yourself: i am better with my self and i am moving towards happiness<br>  <br>  Good luck, Hope it helps!|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	Hmmmm.... Same situation I'm in. Get over him. Things never work the second time around.|`|PK5Elowdaa	Im in the same situation. Your options are the same as mine. Either  come back into my life or stay completely out of it. No in between right? Yep. <br>  <br>  I can't really give you a specific answer for getting him back cause I have no details of what happen. As far as getting over him, hmmmm.. Do what all girls normally do. Go hang out with all your friends. Thats whay my girl did to me. She broke up with me and just went out with her friends. Another way to get over him is to think of all the bad things he's done to you. If you keep thinking about all the good times you had with him, your healing progress will be extremely slow. So take my advice. Think of all the bad things he's done and go hang out with your friends.  Time will be on your side. Good Luck.|`|LQIWZvAGaa	if you want to get him back tell him you love him and miss him and you want to try again. If he is worth it he will want to try again.<br>  <br>  and as for the getting over im yet to do this.. good luck!

For now, you should just act like you're not interested in being more than friends. But stay close with him. If he sees a lot in you, he might decide that he's more connected to you than he is to his girlfriend.|`|1dP7Viiuaa	he has a gf. dont ever fall for boys who have gfs. whether he likes you or not is not the point, cause the thing is, hes still in a relationship.

He is only thinking about his man thing.<br>  <br>  RUN from this dude.  He is a creap who will break your heart and give you some crazy STD!
W6LGsQC8aa	Those are definitely red flags for an abusive relationship. The anger and then the expressing forgiveness are a vicious cycle that trap countless women.<br>  <br>  Just because you stood by him while he was in jail doesn't mean you need to stand by him while he is abusing you!<br>  <br>  You should get out of the relationship now! He shouldn't dictate who you can and cannot talk to, he doesn't own you!|`|1wsBUmQPaa	Leave him!! You will only continue and worsen an abusive relationship! He will not change, he will only get worse!<br>  <br>  Here are some tips to help you stay safe:<br>   Stay in touch with friends and try to stay in group settings before, during, or after school/work.<br>  <br>  Talk to your parents or family members if there are things about your partner that you do not like. Inform them about the relationship.<br>  <br>  If you go to school, let your teachers, counselors, or security guards know about your situation so that they can help you be safe.<br>  <br>  If you need to, change your routine. If possible, change your route to an from school/work an the time you arrive or leave.<br>  <br>  Always keep your cell phone charge or keep extra change at hand in case you need to use a public phone to call for help. (911 is free if you are in trouble and need immediate help.)<br>  <br>  If he gets violent or keeps threatening you, you should consider applying for a protective order. You can get one from the police or apply for one at a courthouse for free.<br>  <br>  Try not to be alone with your partner. Don't go to isolated places, go to public places. Before you leave your house, let other people know where you will be and what your plans are.<br>  <br>  TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS. If you feel you are in danger, get help immediately. Break up with your partner in a PUBLIC place. Let other people know your plans to break up with him and let them know when and where you will break up. <br>  <br>  Here is a good book to read:<br>  Warning, Dating May Be Hazardous to Your Health! <br>  by Claudette McShane<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Warning-Dating-Hazardous-Your-Health/dp/0941300080" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Warning-Dating-Haz...</a><br>  <br>  Check out:<br>  <a href="http://www.loveisrespect.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.loveisrespect.org</a> and <a href="http://www.breakthecycle.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.breakthecycle.org.</a><br>  <br>  P.S.: Please don't make any excuses for him.

It's unique looking-which is good! Don't change it...you look really pretty with it anyway.|`|mzhFrm5Taa	No|`|tBx1M0g9aa	no its nto big it looks fine|`|SoSy4SwXaa	u look like christina ricci|`|QHnS31Scaa	no its good|`|pQWZNafqaa	I wouldnt say your nose is big. You need to put on there a profile of your nose and face (profile is a picture from the side) just to be sure. The only picture that makes your nose look strange is the bottom right picture, but I think that may just be the flash of the camera.|`|Y16olPxlaa	No your nose is fine.<br>  If you're seriously that self concious look up some tips of how to make your other facial features more prominent so that they stand out more than your nose.<br>  But I personally don't think you should worry about it.|`|Km6QTk9Caa	Actually I think everything is in proportion and you have lovely features.  You are a very pretty girl.   I wouldn't be focused on it.   Be happy with what you have,  you look great.|`|ot05RAj8aa	hell no<br>  mine is bigger than yours|`|pgAcX782aa	sory but yeah it kinda is but your really purdy dont let that affect you and your confidence|`|srAP6Vzvaa	if i was single i would hit on you. your nose is perfect. stop nit-picking.|`|5MFBoWSAaa	Your nose looks fine to me.|`|vBqIRHppaa	noo way<br>  your beautiful<br>  <3|`|AA11982696	I dont like my nose either but you look just fine.|`|lW3ZddDFaa	you look great.... nose is fine the way it is and don't point for this subject again u look nice and above okay for sure!!!!!    :)|`|0VLirxVtaa	I don't think anything is wrong with your nose.

Your hott!
877c11ba0aaa509142a50e675e9f83c6aa	Kiss her goodnight. Just before you leave, turn around, and plant a light one on her and linger there for a moment.<br>  <br>  And then say your goodbyes and leave as if nothing happened - it'll keep her thinking about it.<br>  <br>  On top of that, it helps with a possible "awkward" stage afterward because you are leaving anyway.<br>  <br>  Plus, if she's wondering if you're going to kiss her the whole time you're together, it'll bring bonus points for you.<br>  <br>  But mostly, a goodnight kiss ensures that you leave unforgettable - and she keeps things about you. :)|`|CSysSbnlaa	Just watch NASCAR for awhile. If you feel a connection or love in the air or whatever put your arm around her. Lean in a little, not too much, like only 2 cms or somethin'. Then wait for her. If she leans in, too, turn your head a bit towards her. If she turns her head, look at her. You both should feel something then, after that it's all done. But it's only if you two feel connections. If she doesn't, don't do anything, just sit there until she does anything. Got it?|`|PtqjRurnaa	Lol love the don't fail me now commit!!!!   But go with your gut if her mom is there don't be macing on her!!!!  But when its just the two of you and it feels right.|`|MKNdR4FPaa	Trust me it will happen if it happens just put ur arm around her and keep looking at her and then it just happens|`|XasLRQnXaa	i wouldn't kiss her unless you guys are cuddling and blah blah..i dont even know if thats a date? I'd say wait at least til the 2nd one. Don't rush things :]
yKqOi9yraa	You need to figure out what you're willing to accept. If you are ok with him doing this, then he is going to do it. If you stand up and say "I wanna be the only one, and i deserve to be the only one" then at least you will be honest with him and yourself. It sounds like he is having his cake and eating it too. <br>  Never accept anything less than what you want. If he can't give that to you, someone else out there will. There are billions of people on this planet and there is always more than one person out there for someone. No, i don't think you are wrong to want him for yourself, and i don't think you deserve to be guilt tripped into dealing with this bullcrap. No offense to him, but he sounds like he has many problems and i believe that you should try and seperate yourself from him quickly.|`|ubC1reIraa	i know what you're going through. my boyfriend cheated on me and he wouldn't let go of the other girl....<br>  i cried and cried every night...i almost even became depress...everyday i begged him to drop her........but i failed to ask one simple question....<br>  "Is it me or her?"<br>  i told him he can have time to answer that question...it took him 2days to answer that question and at the end, he choose me.<br>  and after he chose me, we talked about the situation...i never yelled at him or got angry with him.....and because of that, he knew what i was going through and now he's completely in love with me...<br>  <br>  i know how much this hurts you but sweetie, sometimes things happen to you at the time that may seem horrible, painful and unfair, but in reflection you realize that without overcoming those obstacles you would never realize your potential, strength, will power or heart. everything happens for a reason. <br>  if someone hurts you, betrays you or breaks your heart, forgive them because they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious to whom you open your heart. if someone loves you, love them back unconditionally, not only because they love you, but also because they are teaching you to love and open your heart and eyes to little things|`|0mhcCyE5aa	Honey!!!!<br>  <br>  Stand on your own two feet, kick him to the curb, and tell him to kiss your azz!!!<br>  <br>  Sure it will hurt like hell for a while afterwards!!!  But when the pain subsides, and it will subside, you will the happiest woman in the world!!!!<br>  <br>  You deserve better!!!  Let her have his cheating azz!!!<br>  <br>  Do NOT sell yourself short!!!!|`|q0NQStcXaa	You are going to have to accept your boyfriend's friends. If you don't, then things like this will drag you under.<br>  If you feel bad about it, talk it over with the other woman, and your boyfriend. Doing this can set things straight. <br>  <br>  Trust is the ebb and flow of relationships.|`|oMv9MuWqaa	you need a man who isint afraid to be owned and wants to be with u.. only<br>  forget him|`|EbUJ7ML5aa	I'm sure that this is probably the last thing that you want to hear, but you should definitely drop him. If he's willing to start a relationship with another woman, he's stopped caring about you and you shouldn't have to put up with something like that. I understand that you have been with him for over a year(?) and i empathize with the heartbreak that you must be going through. However, you sound like a very sweet woman and no one should have to go through the type of suffering you've mentioned. You could definitely find someone better; someone who would appreciate you and not have relationships with other women. The fact that your boyfriend has asked you to accept this woman into your guys' relationship is appalling. A good boyfriend should be YOURS and YOURS ONLY! I hope this helps and good luck :)
OHydEvTCaa	Do not have sex! Please save your body for later on in life when you get married.. Please do not have sex outside of marriage.. there are too many consequences involved with sex.. teen pregnancy, STDS, emotional trauma, humiliation, self consciencness, regret, hurt.. please, please please do not have SEX.. take it from a young woman who started having sex at the early age of 14 and I stopped at 18 when I got saved and TURNED my life around GOD.. God will not be pleased with you if you willingly commit sin.. especially if you know whats right.. everyone is not having sex...Do you think this boy will want to be with you if you give him sex? boys only want your body.. trust me!!!  I will be praying for you to get your mind focused on the right things.. like school! You should be seeking God for help.This is in LOVE young sister that's not love that's lust.. don't do it.. please|`|kERP7zAhaa	You're wayyy to young to have sex. First of all you can't even spell sophomore. Sophomores shouldn't be having sex anyway. And can you get more cliched than doing it after a dance? And love and sex have nothing to do with each other. And sex has nothing to do with popularity. Maybe reconsider having sex when you actually learn the English language perhaps? Try using full sentences. They're generally accepted in today's society.  <br>  <br>  Well if you're going to do it, be discreet, even though you know he won't be, because people are going to judge you and think you're a whore. That's just a fact of life.|`|5QPJ9NRxaa	hmm how to not make yourself not look like an idiot...... <br>  <br>  dont do it.<br>  <br>  i dont care if you dont care about my answer but I am answering it<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter how "in love" you two are or how much you two "connect"<br>  but they dont just say wait untill marriage because they're bored.<br>  <br>  You may ignore my answer but you can't ignore my prayers :)<br>  <br>  God bless you|`|AjBpAPpdaa	Its all in the hips, *echo* it's all in the hips *fades*|`|6TuFqVBEaa	deal with it and just take control dont make him  think you dont know  what your doing|`|PkUPp4s0aa	okay first of all...if he really cares about you he wont care how good you are. he'll be happy that you're giving yourself to him at all. second of all...you arent going to be good your first time. its going to hurt. youre going to be emotional and regretful after. trust me. every girl feels like that. but just make sure that you're absolutely ready for it. make sure you're comfortable enough with him that you won't care about how silly you will look. you're going to make funny sounds and faces and you have to be comfortable to do that with him. also, be sure that he really does care about you. this will be a night you will never forget for the rest of your life. make sure he's "the one" for this. i'm 23 now and i lost mine when i was 17 and i don't regret it because i knew it was right. also, i'm sure you have some friends who have had sex, so ask them what their first time was like. good luck!

NVg06Egwaa	Ok, so first off ARE YOU SURE?!? Are you ready to make a commitment to her? Remember, humans are not trash; we are not supposed to be 'dumped' when we become useless to the bf/gf. IF you are super positive, is she in any of your classes? If not, try walking w/ her in the hallways to her next classes. Even if you've memorized her schedule (yeah...I"m that much of a stalker too!) pretend to be oblivious about some of it, so she doesn't get freaked out by a "stalker" impression. Talk to her alot, be nice..become friends w/ her friends. Just subtly (not too fast!) drop hints! After you have become pretty good friends be like "so who do you like?" casually. Hopefully it goes well. If not, I'm sorry! that definitely sux....but there are tons of fish in the sea...keep your options open. In the mean-time C.O.M.M.U.N.I.C.A.T.E!!!  SUPER CRUCIAL!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|OtU6z4OFaa	ask her questions about her self and join her convos w/ her friends during classes and stuff, or just ask her out<br>  <br>  Plz help me <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqXd85RzvJiCsW.pUtATt3bsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220174533AABQLXC">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ZS4gMRrwaa	she will be flirting with you. her cheeks will get rosy and she would smile a lot.|`|zf7Z5DQsaa	talk to her on msn or facebook chat|`|6eenzkJKaa	Haha,<br>  talk to her when ever you get the chance. If you wanna now if she likes you then you should talk to her friends and see if she has talked about you to her friends. Invite her to the movies and pay for her and she will be really thankful and think you are really sweet. major crush points. just do sweet things to and for her!|`|vJnVhly5aa	just ask her out and if she says no well just move on.Girls are shy to tell a guy if they like them so do it yourself because thats the boy's job<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|iNzRRI70aa	Well if you want to get to know her better i would talk to her as her frined first and then you could find out if she likes you by asking her friend and if her friend tells her that is ok because then she will know too and then she may feel the same way back but she probably likes you. so i wouldnt worry. but difinately get to know her and then you can make your move.<br>  <3much love<br>  LuCKY|`|7PqwM6QXaa	Talk to her, get to know her more :)<br>  i dont know if a lot of girls like it, but i do, i like it when the guy asks the girl out. idk it makes him seem strong lol
wUTSP5VHaa	Lots of touchy. By that I mean talk with your hands.<br>  Touch his hands and chest and shoulders when you talk to him.<br>  Make fun of him a little bit, pay more attention to him than other guys or girls around. And don't be afraid to send out signs jokingly like things about his looks and stuff like "hey sexy" you know jokingly. Very subtle flirting techniques. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Alsoooo laugh at every funny or even not so funny thing he says!! :)|`|qRKOWgS0aa	Be confident. Studies show that confidence is the key to looking good and feeling good. To gain confidence, try writing a list of things you are good at and things that you like about yourself. For instance: <br>  My pretty eyes are complimented often <br>  I have a great personality <br>  I can get along with people easily <br>  I have a lot of friends<br>  <br>  Also, a great way to gain confidence is to join a sport that you are good at, or want to excel in. Not only will this boost your self-esteem, you are guaranteed to make new friends! Boys love when girls are oozing self confidence, but they also like a girl that is humble, so don't get a big head. <br>  Break the touch barrier. The touch barrier is an invisible 'thing' that stops you from interacting physically with a crush. To break it, touch him whenever you can. While talking to him, casually touch him on the shoulder or playfully go up behind him and pull his hood up. Be careful, though. These things (if used extensively) can be annoying to him. <br>  Get to know him. Though we can be quick to want to date random hotties, said hottie could be freaked when you ask him out without even a conversation first. To get a conversation started, talk about him; everybody likes talking about themselves. Talk about your interests, jobs, families, friends, pets, favorite things, you name it. If he is in the same sport as you, or a sport you want to join, voila! More time with Mr. Right. <br>  Slowly start giving him the signs... Joke around with him, to start! Make him laugh and feel himself and comfortable with you. If you are bold enough, ask him to go out with you and your friends to a movie, lunch, or just hanging out at the mall or local park. Look him more in the eyes, but make sure that you don't look at him strangely; this will turn him off. Smile at him when passing in the halls, or give him a playful high five. A few compliments will show him that you are into him. <br>  Find the right time... for him to ask you out. When you are with your friends, the guy might feel awkward to ask you to 'talk privately'. (Wouldn't you?) If he is shy, ask him yourself! The worst thing that could happen is rejection; and when that happens, move on! Its time to go boy hunting again. If he says yes, congrats! It is all you from here on out.|`|74008e5e3a8a4192f40444bc93d2b1c2aa	To Flirt: Graze his arm when you talk, make eye contact last a few seconds too long, compliment him on something (clothes,hair,his not so funny joke ) <br>  <br>  To Seduce: Keep light skin contact, kiss him by his ear or on the neck, make out with him, rub his thigh staying close to his penis, guys are a lot easier to seduce then females. Once they get the hint its all down hill from there.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and happy trails! lol|`|lOGHxtoUaa	breathe on his neck. <br>  just joke around about the guy. too flirt.|`|DzunYgWOaa	wink, smile
kERP7zAhaa	to the other answerer Josh<br>  <br>  AWWWW<br>  <br>  and no they're not ;] just keep looking|`|Bx2w3h0faa	A turn on is a sexual attraction.<br>  <br>  So, of course the overall appearance of a woman is what we notice first and foremost so we will immediatly pursue that woman to try and give it a shot to see if she is also interested.<br>  <br>  However, thats when we learn about the personality. Personality is very important at this point. Because if you cant "Click" with this person there really is no point in getting with them in "Bed" either.|`|w4l8NajJaa	i like to see in a girl kindness<br>  not that stuck up better than anyone girl that thinks everyone loves her<br>  the girl who makes me laugh and makes me feel comfortable around<br>  a girl that is somewhat goodlooking and knows how to have a good time<br>  a girl that isnt a slut or a durrrtty girl lol<br>  but who am i kidding they are all taken : (
8YfYh3y0aa	You should try talking to one of them when you get the chance. Make as many friends as you can, and worry about all the girl/boy stuff once you get the hang of that.
5sHcB4wuaa	hell yes, i love it, i hate skinny girls, they disgust me with their pancake butts, jeez i thought evolution is suppose to change people to be more attractive, and big butt is more attractive, flat butts and flat chests is what i hate. dont be self conscious. screw society for making girls think that skinny is better, those models are nasty skeletons with pretty faces.|`|w4XbSuB5aa	Well it doesn't really matter to some men like me but it's nice if u have something there, well i'm a good guy so i aim for a girl with a nice personality and looks good but she doesnt have to have a lot of curves. but yea most guys like it.|`|6PfJXI7iaa	Guys like many things..

No need to feel self-conscious, life's to short.
WMR8hVlfaa	He is abusing his position of authority. It is not okay at all for him to act toward you in ANY way other than as a manager to an employee. You are a minor and it is illegal for him to touch you. You might think he's a nice guy, but he is being a huge creep and you should tell someone -- your parents, his higher ups, someone. It is NOT okay. Just because his parents have a 12 year age difference does not make it all right for a 27 year old MAN to hit on a 16-year-old CHILD (and you are, by law).<br>  <br>  Developmentally, you are lightyears behind him. One of the main reasons there are laws regarding age is that between your teen years and early twenties you undergo a ton of cognitive development. I am in no way the same person I was at 18 now that I am 21. You have nothing in common with him, and if you don't do something about it NOW he will continue to press you and try to use his power over your job to pressure you into returning his affections.|`|HNAVlwV7aa	do NOT respond to his 'feelings' . a working relationship is not to be mixed with love. that just calls for trouble. u even have a bf. since u obviously dnt care about him try to find someone ur own age that u like. and dnt quit ur job. it's normal for older guys to want younger girls. it makes them feel young again.
dAM2o5lTaa	Well....technically as a girl, its sort of an unwritten rule that you're never supposed to change yourself for a guy.  But it is going to be hard to get over him it seems like, and since you don't like anyone else, I would suggest the whole"look what your missing" idea.  <br>  <br>  Don't go over-the-top....then it will seem like you're trying too hard, and I don't think that guys like that.  But just try and look pretty every day, maybe wear some makeup or something.  Maybe try talking to him some more, getting to be closer friends.  Hopefully he will see what he's missing out on, and ask you out!  :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|qZ0310yVaa	1 has got it
C75SumRtaa	well you gotta talk to her!! if you are a straight forward guy, and you feel confident then just bring it up all flirty and charming, but if your more on the shy side, ask around from trusted sources or stike up casual conversations and try to incorporate it into the conversation.<br>         Hope it works out with you guys!!!|`|x5CdjLqXaa	ask around, ask her friends or co-workers if you guys are working at the same place, ask her what she likes to do for fun/on her days off, etc..... the more you talk to her, the more likely it is that she'll mention her boyfriend if she has one
tHFY2hg4aa	There is a good possibility that she likes you. Allot of girls use touching to communicate that. However, some girls are just quirky with their behavior(meaning you need to notice if she is this way to everyone else). <br>  So, since you are the one who is there, you will have to use your best judgment on that. My advice would be to warm up to her sociably and see what grows from it.|`|4d7f164df9b799e88fffba204ae0183faa	Sounds like she likes you.

AA12336306	Uhh, I think you should just ask her|`|hw3jNGubaa	she probably is afraid of infection or something|`|xZYWOZMEaa	Maybe she has a little acne on some places on her body and face and doesnt want you to feel it. Or maybe she has bumps or something? my sister has little white bumps on her thighs that you can barely see but you can feel them so maybe she has that.. idk what its called though. Or it could be something else.. just ask her and see what she says? but don't make a big deal about it because it might make her feel more self concious if you keep bringing it up.|`|TyRjrSWLaa	she pobably just gets horny really fast thats why i dunno i cat think of anything else just ask her and dont talk to her till she does thats probably extreme but do something

You haven't had the time to talk to him about what's wrong with him. <br>  If you're totally freaked out with this guy, then I think that you should just get out of his way.

Especially if it is your real Mom. If it was a Step-Mom it wouldn't be so bad but if it is your real Mom it is way beyond not normal. You need to talk to someone about this and quick to see why you have this type of feelings towards your Mom. Don't feel like a pervert or anything by some of the answers you will probably get on this question but this does require some professional help. If you are in school talk to your school counselor. If not, get an appointment made with a counselor. If you don't get help, this could be the start of some serious problems in your life. I can't go into detail with you like I want to-I am a counselor myself. This is way too deep of a personal problem and I can't write things that you need to be asked and told. Please get yourself some help and I wish you the best. Good luck.|`|zVVybJFXaa	Sounds like you're young. You may have urges to see your Mom naked because she is the constant female figure in your life, that happens to be attractive. Have you ever seen a picture of naked a woman? If not, your urges about seeing your mother naked makes sense being that she is the constant female in your life. <br>  I would block out thoughts of anything sexual regarding your mother. I'm guessing that your in your teenage years, so that would mean that your hormones are going crazy right now.|`|BNrQSYwhaa	Your a sexually Curious Adolescence It's not your mom you find attractive it's your Urge to Sexually explore.It's normal for a Teenage boy to want to see naked women|`|dJ7xagFCaa	um, no thats not very normal.<br>  <br>  okay then. thats odd. go out there and find a GIRL your OWN AGE thats NOT related to you...especially one that didnt give birth to you.<br>  <br>  she carried you in her uterus for 9 months. ur confused.|`|ANsznbWsaa	Ew. gross.<br>  If this is a serious question it is probably just hormones.|`|ktOoGh6oaa	if i saw your mom......|`|PFPvvHEgaa	You made me sad.<br>  Incest.<br>  Iz not nize.|`|Q3qcnzHAaa	no|`|sBeq09Hxaa	It is just an affection towards the same blood you know.

RQ4h0ltuaa	When he said he was looking for love he wanted to see what you would say. That was his way of asking/telling you with out making it awkward.

CBa9G4j4aa	Honestly I don't believe in love at first sight and I don't think you should. To truly be in love you have to be in love with someone flaws and all. You love someone for who they are truly deep down in side. When you first see someone you don't know a thing about them. You should get to know them properly first.|`|KNCi2Yudaa	i dont believe in love at first sight. you cant tell what a person is like by looking at them. you have to get to know them and talk to them, cause then u would just like them for their looks.|`|yop2DPYvaa	yes i believe in love at first sight<br>  i experienced it with the first guy i loved.<br>  you know in the exact instant you lay eyes on him, its a pretty crazy experience. i remember being so caught off guard that i couldnt even form sentances and my heart was just racing.|`|pE5E5L5naa	the last one is true, the rest is just pure Bull$hit, cause even if she looks good, you can't get it on when her personality is all fcked up inside
2hcA3VP9aa	even though i do not know you personally i would really worry for you because people like your boyfriend seem like if they get a little alcohol in them, then they will hit anyone, including their loved ones. and for the fact when you said his friends wont take your side, i feel like that can come to hurt or even kill you in the future. i hate to use such morbid words but lets say as an example he hit you and you try to hit him back then his friends might try to help him by fighting you. i really don't know y'all relationship can last in these circumstances. i think y'all should go to a public place, like restaurant, and you should tell him all of your concerns. he might get mad but if it is just the two of you at the table i don't think he will put his hands on you since y'all are in public. but i do think y'all should take different cars just for you safety. i hope this helps and i wish you the best.

2btGvJexaa	I think you should let him know whats going on in your head and see where he stands. Don't make a move on him until your sure he feels the same way about you.

4b63df522adcbbe3effabc36048eabe4aa	Since Cannabis shouldn't be labeled a drug in the first place, and since she only smokes it on occasion, I don't see a problem with her. Smoking Marijuana is less harmful then drinking and smoking cigarettes, therefore for someone to label her a junkie, over bud, that person needs to better educate themselves.<br>  <br>  I don't know if it's a turn on or turn off, each dude has his own perception on things, mostly chicks. But really, if she does anything else like Crystal-Meth or Heroine, then ok, label her a druggy... other wise people need to lay-off. It's pathetic how many people are brainwashed by the government into thinking Marijuana is the devil, yet they don't believe in other things the government tells them. How many people agreed with everything Bush did or said?<br>  <br>  The same people who are brainwashed, are the same people who will give me a thumbs-down. Grow up, smoking marijuana is one persons drug, eating fast-food or drinking coffee is another persons. Just because something is legal doesn't make it right.<br>  <br>  Out of High School.

AA10789153	OK, first of all, you're worrying too much. You're only 14 for pete's sake! You have MANY MANY years to worry about getting a gf. The whole "we're too good of friends" is basically a line used when a girl is not interested in you at all, but is trying to be nice and not say pike off. Sorry, but it'll get better. Just be patient :)|`|0eorp2Hhaa	its cuz ur a ''nice guy'' i guess. but dont worry, i find nice guys are very attractive :)|`|y531A4FAaa	"we're too good of friends" means that you guys are close in terms of friendship and she wouldn't want to ruin that after you guys broke up. and if she keeps going out with "douches" it's probably because she's trapped inside the spiral. for example, one bf breaks up with her and shes hurt, then another one comes along and treats her nice and they go out, and then he breaks up with her and so on.|`|eZ884HfPaa	Girls like guys that are confident ... unfortunatly the nice guys are always the friends....|`|e0qGLxmiaa	why do u want to date someone who goes out with douc hes?|`|ZggXjWdxaa	thats sad. i'm sorry. but that one girl must think of you as her friend, and girls dont want to go out with their best friends.  there are two ways that girls think of guys: as friends, and as boyfriends.  they usually dont mix, i you know what i mean.  girls like guys that are funny, that make them laugh, that arent awkward to talk to, that always have something to say, that are cute, nice, smile alot, fun to be around, outgoing, flirty, and make them feel special and loved.  keep trying, your only 14, trust me, you have time, and i'm sure you will find a girlfriend sometime soon.|`|uq5MGH3oaa	you probably cant get a girl because u dont network with other ppl. stop following everyone else and what their doin. dats gonna just make u feel bad about urself. heres a few suggestions<br>  <br>  start talking and being social with other people <br>  <br>  start seeing what do you want in a girl <br>  <br>  eventually youre going to talk to more people and find that special one<br>  <br>  and remember this...if you don't do anything the girls gonna move on....
PGqMKRL7aa	you're pretty fugly (f**king ugly) and she's way prettier : )<br>  <br>  what matters is not the outside, but the kind of person you are on the inside, and it looks like you've been beaten to the point of no return with the ugly stick...and you really are an awful friend, what kind of friend would ever say something like that about their friend? Yes, they make a good couple, yes they're better than you, yes you fail at life. No you are not better. You are not better for him as you are a ***** and it looks like he'd be better off with a llama than you.<br>  <br>  and jess is right...you're pretty much a waste of oxygen...|`|OiUiEMr0aa	i think your a stuck up little brat who is a looser and is jealous of a person who looks like considers you a friend and here you are talking bad about her...your a complete ho....seriously wow...get your own boyfriend its too late for that guy...apparanlty she beat you to him cause shes way cuter than you|`|fBdtvrWdaa	No offense but you sound like a b*tch. How dare you act like that and come on some website and degrade that girl? It is his choice because it is his life and his girlfriend. If he doesn't like you? Big freaking deal. Find someone else don't act like you are 12, which it looks to me like you are. You are insanely rude and, from what I see and read, he's better off without you even in his life.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  You are ugly. On the outside, you are passable but on the inside? You are hidious. She's very pretty. A little too much make-up, but at least she's not going behind your back calling you ugly to everyone she can. I seriously mean it when I say, you seem like a b*tch.|`|hhPNKpEQaa	Well, you seem sorta jealous. She DOES look alot older in that last photo though. She's pretty, but blondes can get over rated.|`|72df64d291deb659fd8f62b0c3330639aa	uhm you are both really ugly sorry.<br>  and youre really conceited...
rIzx4OEWaa	I would take an educated guess that they are jealous of you an don't want you any where near there boyfriends or husbands. Being a model perhaps they think there other half will start to compare you against them an wonder why they aren't as attractive as you must be.<br>  It could also be the fact that they wish they were you an are jealous of that as well, they may feel that you have more in your life now that you are a model an can travel etc. It will happen it is up to you to prove them wrong, try taking your own boyfriend around to visit them an see what there reactions are then? I hope it works it's a shame they can be so childish.|`|Molu004zaa	It's possible that they might just be jealous of your success. Alternatively, your attitude may have changed since becoming a model. Have you started acting snobby or stuck-up in any way? Think REALLY hard. If you have, that's something which might be driving them away. Your best option is to sit them down and ask.|`|XWk7TDYTaa	The problem is you only know your side of the story.<br>  If they're mad at you its pretty conceited to assume its because they're jealous of your modeling. <br>  But that could always be it too.<br>  <br>  How about you ask them?|`|4Pa8TnLeaa	you know what the problem is <br>  they are just jealous that you have the opportunity to do modeling <br>  make sure that you dont boast about it.. maybe you have annoyed them without realizing.|`|zGgUsEmdaa	Jealousy of your figure, I think. x
4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	Why are you scared? Are you scared b/c you like the guy back? Or are you scared b/c you know that if you start dating him and then get a chance w/ "the other guy" that you will dump him at the drop of a hat??<br>  <br>  If you've been crushing on "the other guy" for months and nothing's happened yet, then that means he hasn't ever really noticed you or doesn't particularly like you back. Either way, your chances of starting something out of that are slim.<br>  <br>  My advice: you got this dude's number and I think you like him enough to get butterflies in your stomach. Go for it. If you're worried about an awkward conversation then just call when he's known to be at work or in class or otherwise unable to pick up. Leave a simple message requesting him to call you back. Then, he's got your number and the onus is on him to initiate the first date. If his availability is up in the air and you don't know when you can call and get a guaranteed voicemail, then you should jot down a few anecdotes, funny stories and cool talking points a note card, to refer to if there's an awkward pause and things get tenuous.
8s2HEgWUaa	Well by reading your question your probably in high school. The smart thing is to do it in person and just make it straight forward. Too many woman are scared of telling guys things so they do little signs or give hints. One thing you need to know about us men is that we are not the brightest. By the time we catch on to your hint we're already going to be moved on. Not trying to be mean. Just trying to prevent you from sitting there thinking to yourself why didn't i do something different. Just be straight. Good luck|`|1uRUaSblaa	Nope.You mentioned 'like', not 'love'...should be ok.<br>  <br>  Depends on how close my friendship is with the other person.If we feel comfortable with each other enough , I will tell him I have a 'problem' of liking him and ask him what he suggests I should do about it.At least from his answer, I will know where I stand and do what is most appropriate.|`|y531A4FAaa	I think you should do it. life is about taking chances isn't it? my friend flat out told her crush she liked him,but hes a jerk so nothing happened. but i'm sure that won't happen with you. good luck.
e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	This is what guys do.  Guys tease each other about everything.  Especially things that bug that particular guy.  If a guy does not like it when he gets teased about something...then his guy friends will tease him about it every time.
Molu004zaa	She rejects you. So what? It's not like you'll die or turn blue or anything. Her turning you down is honestly the worst thing that can happen and that's NOTHING to be scared of.

EgfL2c86aa	i honestly believe i have been in love once. and what i felt with that guy was almost like a drug high the entire time. everything about us was just great. even the morning after we had a fight we'd wake up and apologize and go about being happy. when you love someone i think you loose sight of everyone else's opinion and only focus on your own. that's what love is.
c282b658121c083eb61a50380f3c922daa	You should be very worried.  He is still in love with his ex.<br>  <br>  Move on.|`|EjhBMKX8aa	girl something is up i been in the same situation before and im a guy and she did turn around on me and went to her ex.  Maybe they do have a special connection and they are just truly just friends but i would def. keep my eyes and ear open with him.
iuTn6OwSaa	he seems like a player kind of... but see how it goes. My opinion is don't have sex with him.. it makes your relationship a lot harder and more complicated. Don't make that mistake so early into a relationship.... but i think you need to tell him how you feel. Tell him why you feel this way, and see if you see a change. If you don't then talk to him about it and tell him that you are concerned.. hope that helped! good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Avn6Rblt0_BxR7qIPpqjAR3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220171953AAjROrF">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|vnJG8UYJaa	The only way you will know the truth about how this guy feels about you is to put your relationship to the test.  Try going out with him, but don't have sex with him.  If he continues the relationship, then he likes being around you.  If he doesn't, then all he wanted was sex.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|bqllCJsTaa	Man don't have sex because you think its gonna make him love you more. If you're not ready then don't.

Think of something safer that won't harm you in any way.|`|td6WXhv4aa	Don't smoke you'll get addicted to nicotine your teeth will turn yellow and you'll have better than average odds of getting lung cancer.<br>  <br>  What are the consequences of smoking:<br>  <br>  Coronary heart disease (e.g., heart attacks)<br>  Peripheral vascular disease (circulatory problems)<br>  Aortic aneurysm<br>  High blood pressure<br>  High cholesterol (LDL)<br>  Lung cancer<br>  Cancer of the mouth, throat and voice box<br>  Cancer of the pancreas<br>  Cancer of the kidney, and urinary bladder<br>  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)<br>  Chronic bronchitis<br>  Emphysema<br>  Pneumonia<br>  Influenza (the "flu")<br>  The common cold<br>  Peptic ulcers<br>  Chronic bowel disease (Crohn's Disease)<br>  Tooth decay (cavities)<br>  Gum disease<br>  Osteoporosis<br>  Sleep problems (falling asleep inappropriately and/or frequent waking)<br>  Cataracts<br>  Thyroid disease (Grave's Disease)<br>  <br>  There is some scientific evidence that smoking may also be related to cancer of the large intestine and leukemia. In addition to various diseases, smoking also causes the skin to wrinkle and create the appearance of premature aging. Smoking also reduces the sense of smell and taste.<br>  <br>  Edit: The guy who said smoking can't ruin your life needs a reality check.|`|jg9w6IbQaa	smoking will not necessarily ruin your life. some people like to overreact. i'm a smoker so i'm not going to put you down for it but if you're only going to do it once and then never do it again, why do it at all? i don't think doing this is going to ruin your life, but remember not to do it for the wrong reasons.|`|12gvcc2Daa	nope you should not and i have good reasons why. first of all you will get NO enjoyment out of that one first puff. it will taste like crap. second it wont do your  health any favors especially if you manage to get hooked.

No High, No Health, No Guy. its simply not worth it in anyway.|`|SwYY1IWuaa	i stared smoking when i was 16 because i was not the that smart and i findly quit when i was 20 now it has allmost been 5 years sense i quit and i wish i never stared. so if you never do it it will be a lot better for you|`|XT81GCu1aa	Don't do it.|`|jrcBgCxeaa	talk to your doctor first but here are some things to consider.<br>  1. breathing exercises....when quiting to oxygenate the blood when you are having a craving.<br>  2. Slowly decrease you cigarette intake.<br>  3. Nicotine patch or gum.<br>  4. something in your mouth to suck on...sounds strange as to the breathing exercise and sucking on something but I will explain.<br>  When inhaling the smoke, ironical you dump more oxygen into your system and that is what gives you the calm feeling when having a smoke. A cigarette is also used to relieve stress, so when feeling stressed out try a stick of gum or suck on a candy, just make sure not to sugar overdose.<br>  5. when feeling a craving coming on do something to take your mind off of it.<br>  6. If you go with the slow cut down option keep a journal about your progress. Good luck on quiting.|`|gu0W3BXjaa	Definetly do not smoke cigarettes. If your talking about trying marijuana, its also not good for you, though has less dangerous effects on your body. I have recently quit weed but its a good experience to have.

I'll tell you the best way.  SEX TOYS IS THE NAME!!   My girl friend can never come when we have sex (I mean not clitoral ***, but g-spot ***).  And I'm long and she even complains that it hurts in certain positions.  Get a nice penis like G-SPOT vibrator and a clit vibrator.  Ask her to use the clit vibrator and you use the g-spot vibrator on her. She can come over and over.   And trust me , she'll go to sleep after that and won't bug you for sex all night.   These days these vibrators are like crazy. No guy can perform like them.   <br>  The problem is that if you don't make a women *** completely , they still wont' feel satisfied.   <br>  So get some toys.  Go to the local adult store and experiment. <br>  After sometime, she'll be stuck on them, and you can be done in like 5 mins...HAHAHA.|`|PfmXPbFpaa	I agree with the previous posters who mentioned toys and foreplay.

2Q3aOzebaa	I don't think you should push it on her constantly, but ever since Christmas? this is way more than enough time for her to think it through. If you feel like waiting until May, it's up to you.<br>  <br>  But I think you should ask her how she feels soon because if she feels the same way you do, go for it. And if she doesn't, you can slowly try to get over your first crush and move on.  No need for her to lead you on or anything. (I'm not implying that she is/was leading you on.)<br>  <br>  --To answer your question, I wouldn't mind if someone said this to me, but I wouldn't make them wait too long for an answer.|`|HCk6ifrAaa	Yes thats plenty of time...<br>  She should just tell you what she feels, but don't get your hopes up because her answer could just as easily be a no than a yes.<br>  If she thinks you're being pushy or desperate or whatever then she's just crazy.|`|kzIVGEfgaa	Well, personally, if I grew up with someone for a while, and they came out and said they liked me, I would feel a weird. However, giving her 5 months to give you answer, is too long. <br>  <br>  I think you should take her aside somewhere, sit down, and talk to her. Explain your feelings and say you want an answer but don't demand it. Make her feel like it's ok if she says she doesn't like you.<br>  <br>  She may like you but be hesitant because she doesn't want it to be messy if it ends bad. OR she may not like you and not want to tell you in risk of losing you all together.
YmspJewvaa	Since she didn't completely turn you down, that means that you still have a chance. I mean, if she really does not like you, she would just reject. Also, "Some walls are built to keep others away, but some walls are built to see who cares to tear them down." If you have true feelings for her, keep waiting for her.|`|lldwL1nYaa	she might be confused. She likes you deep down but something (whether its something she knows about you, something she holds against you, anything) is keeping her from giving into it. But it's nice for her to know that someone likes her and she likes that you talk to her and actually  care, so she can't tell you to leave her alone.|`|RxLSxs6Zaa	just keep giving her attention and flirting with her. or you could always go with the jealous approach and make her jealous because your talking to some other girl and she might go out with you, but that could always back fire too.|`|xDOkuxOXaa	hmmm that's a hard one lets think how about you talk with her so she can get what she wants or if you like her make-out i dare you!!!

Q5BM2POnaa	The question presumes all guys are the same and like the same thing.<br>  <br>  It doesn't make any more sense than asking what kind of dresses girls like to wear or what kind of music guys like.<br>  <br>  However, in an attempt to answer your question, guys generally are simple creatures.  We tend to like women who are a little (but not too much) slutty and we tend to be a bit dirtier sexually (or at least we don't hide it as much).<br>  <br>  In short most guys are pretty easy.  A little makeup, a sexy outfit, a bit of mystery and be a little adventurous in bed and it's all good.|`|8SKpsVG7aa	any slutty thing that comes to mind|`|XGgPhaDbaa	You are too dadgum young to be asking this!<br>  go to the movies with your friends and get off of here trying to learn about sex.<br>  We aren't going to tell you.|`|738eb3523fcda7312e683aec70d06ce8aa	What do I like in bed?

I always feel weird answering questions about sex if the person asking is in junior high.  Oh well - Reader Discretion is Advised.<br>  <br>  Here are the top few things I can suggest to make you better in bed, and make your sex life an unbelievably good time.<br>  <br>  1 - Masturbate.  HUGE deal.  You really need to know what makes you orgasm so you can achieve better and better orgasms with a partner.  Understand your body and how it works. <br>  1b - Tell the guy you masturbate and / or that you own toys.  Men like to visualize their woman in all states of pleasure, even if she's by herself.<br>  <br>  2 - Keep an open mind.  Within reason though.  If the guy wants to blindfold you and tease you, kissing every last inch of your body, that sounds acceptable.  If he has fantasies of staged rape, or choking, or anything that could be construed as abuse, stay away (unless you consciously decide you're into that).  <br>  <br>  3 - TALK ABOUT SEX.  Talk about your fantasies together.  Tell him what you want him to do to you - where you want his hands to go, where you want him to kiss you, how you want him to take you...  Let him tell you what he wants you to do to him.  Talk about what turns you on - especially what about HIM turns you on.  We feel more powerful when you make the fantasy about us in particular.  He will feel like a bigger, better man, who can satisfy you just the way you want, if you make the fantasy about him, specifically.<br>  <br>  3b - Match sexual compatibility by talking.  If you don't like oral sex, but he does, you might have a problem.  If you love it, but he won't return the favor, it may cause a problem.  Talk about what you like and don't like so you can determine if you're a good match.  If he doesn't want to do anything other than you go down on him and then sex....I would leave that alone.  There are MUCH better, more attentive, better skilled men out there.<br>  <br>  4 - When you're comfortable with each other, make a Naughty To Do List.  This is key to adventure.  Set goals for future sexcapades.  You each make a to-do list of sexual activities you want to accomplish.  Maybe it's WHERE you want to do it (hallway, kitchen, car, couch, park), maybe it's a certain position, maybe it's something you want to do to him, maybe its something you want him to do to you - whatever it is, write it down.  He will do the same.  Sit down and share with each other.  <br>  <br>  [usually this will automatically lead to clothes fling off and at least three things on that list being taken care of within a matter of minutes] <br>  <br>  There are a lot of things guys want.  Number one, I think, is to have a girl who knows how her body works, and can show me if I'm not doing it right. I want a girl who knows how to orgasm, and personally, can have a hundred a night (I like to set & break records).  I think men just want someone that is fun, adventurous, and open to exploring what each of you like together.<br>  <br>  Have fun, stay protected, and shoot me a message if you need more. <br>  <br>  Blake|`|vRXtz76Iaa	well, it depends... Each guy likes different things like scratching or biting in bed.. and each guy has a certain thing that he likes to have done more than anything..You just have to find out what it is.. Basically what I would want though, is just a girl to feel comfortable with it and do whatever feels right for her... Not influence her to do anything she didn′t want to try while in bed... When there is a connection, it doesn′t really matter what you do in bed... The feeling you get is all you need...|`|m3PKdMWBaa	I like a girl who is confident about her body and her sexuality and will let me know when she's enjoying herself. I like a girl who doesn't think it's "gross" for a man to go down on her... and someone who enjoys returning the favor sometimes. It doesn't take much... if she's into it, I'm into it.|`|zal6shPUaa	hats

VgiUGqxtaa	You, My Lady, are in the friend Zone!!!<br>  <br>  Sorry :(...<br>  <br>  But, it might just be that he's too shy to tell you, so plays along..<br>  <br>  Maybe try telling him, instead of trying to show him|`|b2d574b8a654cff08132b97a7ed59201aa	Hmmm. One possibility is that both of you are stuck in awkward teenage land, where you both like each other, but neither one of you knows quite how to act on it. It's also possible that he just can't make up his mind about girls -- that he likes the attention but is afraid of being in a relationship. Or, he simply might not see you as anything more than a friend.<br>  <br>  I think you should try just cutting to the chase and asking him out. Next time you're being flirty, ask him how he feels about girls asking guys out. Then ask him how he'd feel about going on a date with you.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, stop throwing yourself at him. One thing about the male psyche is that we tend to take women who pay a lot of attention to us for granted -- but as soon as they stop and start hanging out with other guys, we find ourselves getting strangely jealous.
nUqGDTvxaa	you should be a bigger person .... and stop messing with him. i can tell from your writing that he a toy for you and nothing more. let him live his life.

(which is bad) <br>  <br>  but other girls, they will usually just stare at you ALOT <br>  and sometimes even smile at you<br>  also if they try to come up with reasons to talk to you<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|AA11808093	Well, that's a hard one but it could be anything from a glance to a shy smile. It could be how she seems to gentle brush against you when she has room to pass without doing so or the way she touches your hand when giving you something (like if u work together & she passes u something). There are many instances that could show a person likes you without verbally saying they do.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps & good luck with who ever it may be...

Maybe she already feels that way.|`|M85hL2eCaa	ok heres the thing maby she is into you but it may just be a friend thing you have to be carefull with stuff like that bcuz if she doesnt like you and u ask her out and she turns you down...that will make your friendship kinda akward soo wait till there is more signs like she flirts with you. maby then but wait and see...bcuz a fiendship is better than nothing, right?<br>  <br>  <br>  hope that helps....

She wants you to ask her if you can see it sometime.|`|Xb7kaCkiaa	I talk like that, its no biggy :)<br>  Some girls are just like that<br>  but sometimes I get so annoying I piss myself off.|`|GHnkKwl3aa	Well us girls are really talkative. We talk about literally the most random things. Today it could be the designs and stuff litering her bed, tomorrow it could be the time when she was five and she saw a butterfly. (Just random example lol)<br>   <br>  Point is, she was probably just sitting in her room and talking to you, saw there was some kind of lull in the conversation and talked about the first thing she saw. <br>  <br>  I do that a lot. :P|`|8a65VDAKaa	my gf and i talk about EVERYTHING (except what we've done with other people in the past, because we dont really care for it, although we have a general idea)...  and yes, sometimes she talks about her stuffed animals and the things in her room.. and her childhood games and dolls. i dont care, cuz she listens to me talk about cars or football..|`|YDUmNLFVaa	Haha yup totally normal! Me and my boyfriend talk about pretty much EVERYTHING. It's just something us girls do haha. So nothing to worry about totally normal.|`|BPGz4Sa6aa	yep, girls will be girls...we love cute comfortable things|`|9f7a722194248b03b8bf4b7d62bb253eaa	A lot of girls, even the scary emo ones (I know more than a few) like to do things like that. When I'm with people I'm really comfortable around I act like a 3 year old! I have a baby voice when normally I'm kind of gruff. It's just nice to be able to depend on someone to not make fun of our inner baby girl :D So yes, it's totally sweet and normal.|`|IYTcI3r5aa	Furry fandom (also known as furrydom, furridom, fur fandom or furdom) refers to the fandom for fictional anthropomorphic animal characters with human personalities and characteristics.[1] Examples of anthropomorphic attributes include exhibiting human intelligence and facial expressions, the ability to speak, walk on two legs, and wear clothes.|`|5LwGKsYPaa	well maybe she was out of it. or wanted to change up the convo. but we dont ALWAYS talk bout that stuff. just change the subjext. a girl wants to know if you want to change the convo or else we dont have any clue you want too next time just tell her.<br>  -- answer my recent question?|`|yayDgY0qaa	YES. we girls will talk about it. At least 5th graders do. I am in the 5th grade. So don't ask me this question for at least another 8 years.|`|CHF7VtElaa	yes its normal. girls just want to keep the conversation going so they ramble on about the littlest things.|`|1ceywpfVaa	No, I think it's normal.  Maybe she's just running out of stuff to say.
HvKa78nAaa	you can talk about any thing   what kinds things you like what he likes
4IHe4rPYaa	you should. the guy is supposed to end the phone conversation but act like you still wanna talk to her.|`|dujGeZ32aa	If you explain her that you gotta go, i think she will understand.  tell her you will call her tomorrow and make you sure call her.  But play fair and sometimes let her tell you she will call you the next day.|`|hSSBEEFRaa	You should, that way you can control how far the conversation goes and it  ensures you have stuff to talk about next time. Plus girls like to talk on the phone, and it you wait till they stop it could be awhile and then she might lose interest because you talked about so much, leave her wanting more conversation =D.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  -Sam|`|Vr6L81iiaa	That is a question with two answers. If you have to go.... then you have to go. She'll understand. If you are the one who needs to leave, then yes, say you'll talk to her later or call her later. And please make sure you do, nothing drives a girl more crazy then a guy who promised to call but never did. It really depends on time, if she needs to go for any reason then that's that, and if you need to go then that's also that. does that make any sense to you? lol
TOPTB10Baa	Wow... I'm really sorry that happened.<br>  I think you need to talk to him about it. It's gonna be hard, that's for sure. But you need to. You can't let him leave it at that.<br>  Either he was being a douche and using you to help him get over his ex, who as you said, he ended up getting back together with, or he liked you but liked her more.<br>  I'm not sure. it's hard to tell from things like that.<br>  But just, talk it out with him. Tell him how you feel and that you want to know what all this meant. Make him talk about it so you guys can try to recover at least some of what you lost.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Go and demand an explanation|`|XF1y4wMmaa	What a jerk. He is a asshole to do that to you.<br>  He is not worth it. You move on. <br>  If I was you, I would drop him. If my best guy friend did that to me, Oh god, I would drop them right then and there. <br>  I am really sorry!|`|GHnkKwl3aa	That has to be one of the rudest things I've ever heard a guy do before. He led you on. When he didn't have a girlfriend to love him and to kiss (and do other things), he went to his best friend -- played with her emotions and led her to believe she loved him. That's sickening.<br>  <br>  I can't believe Jake got back with his ex! After everything you two went through! He used you!<br>  <br>  ...you totally deserve better.

Be cautious about it though, he might be holding back because he does still like you, but there is someone else.|`|ysijEWIhaa	you intimidate him, he is scare of being rejected by you, he really like you a lot, he has a conflict, the other girls are not important for him just you.
3924c6cb1a9c58e6092df7c8166eddceaa	I would be so mortified!  Probably just say "excuse me, sorry, my stomach hasn't been feeling too well today."<br>  <br>  Actually, I was over at a guy's house (we're at the very initial stages of getting to know each other better) the other day and he farted loudly in the middle of a conversation.  He was obviously embarrassed.  I just pretended like I never even heard it.|`|3FoU68xuaa	I don't :) i hold it or leave asap, so it's never happened. Though everyone will say "it's only natural" and whatnot, I do think alot of guys will view you a bit differently and you want to distinguish yourself apart from being "just one of the guys" type of friend to him and be the girl he thinks more of..So I try to keep some mystery in that way and as many ways as possible..There's a lot to be said for being girly and feminine!|`|gYuJUyvvaa	If someone did that to me, I'd be like<br>  <br>  "HOW DARE YOU!!!" and fart louder :D|`|dujGeZ32aa	either excuse me or pretend it never happened.|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	excuse me|`|u4B3pmqmaa	that is really embarassing.....i dont know what id do! lol|`|zdQGden1aa	laugh in knowing that you got him first|`|12gvcc2Daa	turn around and say; "bet you can't to better"<br>  seriously after you do that there's nothing much else left to do besides bask in humilitation while accepting fully that as a human you have human urges and one of those urges happens to be flatulence. i mean lets face it... this guy you like, you suppose he's never layed one?|`|jiCoo78raa	Smile and bat your eyelashes. If he can't handle your farts now, he never will... and if that's the case, what kind of a guy is that?|`|aK8BS08Baa	hahaha i being a guy would laugh and then be like never hook up with that and tell everyone about it so we can all laugh no really though it aint that bad at all being a guy i wouldnt care that much so dont sweat it|`|wJl9a1Tqaa	blame the person right next to you or if there is none people around you than tell him that you were trying to get gum off your shoe then get out of there|`|vs7JYKmOaa	thats a little embaresing but just relax is something natural he is probably grosser|`|AOVlNkbTaa	Laugh at yourself!

SAY HELL NO<br>  <br>  Let's get real.|`|GHnkKwl3aa	What I'm going to say I know is going to sound harsh and uncomprihensible, but please, if you want help - take my advice.<br>  <br>  He broke your heart. Your heart is shattered over him. He dumped you and moved on really quickly. Meaning he's already forgotten about your feelings, and is looking for a new girl. My advice? You do the same. Cheer yourself up. Remember that friends (especially boyfriends) come and go in our lifetime quickly. But you have to forget about how they hurt you and focus on all the good times. And with that, you'll be able to get back out there and date again and forget about him. <br>  <br>  He's forgotten and moved on. I wouldn't get back together with him. Think of it -- he dumped you. Two DAYS later went and put his moves on another girl. He's not worth it. It's just going to happen again. Move on. Find a different guy, a better guy, one that makes you even happier.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Cheer up! Heart break is natural. Once you love, you have to brace yourself for the impact of a broken heart but you'll get over it.|`|nBKSMnTSaa	If your boyfriend could leave you for another girl, and then talk about getting back with you 2 weeks later, then he's just a piece of trash. The reason why he wants to get back with you in 2 weeks is his trick way of saying if his ex does not accept him back, then you are still there for him as a second choice. He's being extremely selfish, and not caring about your feelings at ALL. So I really think you should just say no. I know that it will hurt, because you'll remember all the memories you've had. But do you want to get over the feelings and move on for a better life, or lie to yourself that you NEED this guy who can do such a thing to you and ruin your life? <br>  <br>  All up to you, but my advice is given. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8pWFsDSHaa	Tell him in two weeks how much he hurt you, what he did, left you in the cold..... It is your choice, just let him know he gets one chance if you say yes, that he Cannot do that to you........ And to just tell you the truth, or else it hurts (hurting =( ) a whole lot more.|`|hJ5lQXehaa	You sound like a stalker. Get over it.|`|gYTtiHGzaa	separate the pros and cons, it is your decision, and i am sure you'll make the right choice and talk to him. and be aggressive|`|AA11650655	look you have a long life ,maybe this guy isnt mr. right just move forward and u will meet the riight perfect guy in time..|`|Gf3Njsbhaa	ahh yeah i never fell hard for guys but a recent breakup from a year relationship devestated me. i was the same way. dont let it get to you as much as it hurts. <br>  make sure you surround yourself with people at all times work go to school keep yourself busy its the only thing that helps. just dont think about it. and if someone brings it up dont say you want to hear about it. if you hear that hes trying to get back together with someone else hes just trying to live. and get over you. hes not worth it. everything happends for a reason. you nor him can tell the future. maybe it will bring  you guys back together. no matter what im sure he doesnt want to see you this upset and hes just trying to cope with it as much as you are just hes doing it the stupid way trying to find rebound<br>  <br>  well hope you feel better cheer up their not worth it! we all realize it after you straighten things out that you spent your time mopping around for a stupid guys theres too many more.
0pGHEctIaa	your only in middle school, wait until high school to date.<br>  guys in middle school are immature and no one knows what they're doing. <br>  and being smart is a good thing. people will except you for who you are. being smart is just an awesome addition!

The only reason people think that its wrong is because they're racist and very uneducated. Living in California where I see so much diversity that I'm accustomed to it. On the other hand, I took a trip to the east coast and everything seems so different as if everyone keeps to their own kind. I'd pretty much say that its just being uneducated, racist, and narrow minded. Unfortunately some people are still stuck in the past and not in the present. The present is diversity, it is being more excepting to other people's differences.|`|2MB7plSjaa	No, there isn't anything wrong in my opinion.  But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  Don't forget about the stereotypes these days.  Some people may think that all black men are "ghetto" and or "trashy".  They have to remember that not all people are like that if they are a different color.

That's not the problem...  You can just ask him to do something innocent after school, you know, study together, grab a coffee, whatever.

You missed your chance on Valentine's day, ya know, to drop him a note...
JtEBaOdjaa	Are you throwing it yourself? cause that is tacky. lol<br>  If your aunt is doing everything then SHE is inviting these people.<br>  <br>  You each make a guest list and that's it.  You shouldn't exclude your friend because she didn't want to invite her and vice versa.<br>  However, do not invite anyone who is not invited to either wedding.<br>  <br>  Out of town guests get an invite too.  I have gone to MANY out of town showers.  If they can't come they'll say 'no' and that's fine.<br>  <br>  For friends and family invite to BOTH weddings send out an invite saying "joint bridal shower".  Then the people who are attending yours and not hers will get an invite for you alone, and those attending hers and not not yours will get an invite with her name only.  That way they don't worry about 2 gifts.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	If people are being invited to only one wedding, maybe you can say on their shower invite that it is a shower for that girl and not mention that it's a joint bridal shower.  If they don't know in advance that there's a joint bridal shower, then they won't feel obligated to buy gifts for both of you.|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	I'd invited both out of town and those who live in the area.<br>  <br>  As for the guest list, I see what you mean. If I was invited to your shower and the invite said joint shower I'd be confused if I'd have to buy a gift for both of you even though I'm only close to one. What about sending separate invites. Those people only invited to your sister's wedding get an invite for her shower and same with you. Then those people who would be on both lists get a joint shower invite.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	First you don't want to invite out of towner. They'll just think you want an extra gift because you know they can't come. Then both of you invite whoever you would have if it was a seperate one. Those who only know one of you will bring the gift for you. Those that know both of you will bring 1 for each. The ones that aren't close will think your reception is a smaller sized one. No big deal|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	family and  your friends
e8SPmZULaa	i think you should tell your bf the truth even though it will hurt (it would hurt either way) say that you feel of him in more of a brother type way, not a bf/gf way. Also tell him you dont want it to ruin your friendship and tell him that you'll always be there for him in hard times like what hes going through now.<br>  <br>  Dont ask the other guy out straight away.. it wiulll make you look like abit of a player even if you dont mean to be seen like that. Id tell the over guy you like him but dont ask him out JUST yet... give it a while of him knowing you like him because if you immediately ask him out the guy you just dumped will seriously feel really really bad D:<br>  <br>  ive been in the same situation.. u just gotta bite the bullet but tell them your never too far out to help<br>  x|`|XF1y4wMmaa	If your current bf is not making you happy then you should not keep it up. In the beginning of the year I was going out with this guy that I thought I liked a lot. Well, he asked me out, after a week we talked and we both thought it wasnt working. To my suprise, he started going out with my ex-best friend the next day... Hmmm.<br>  Anyways, you really should give this guy a couple more days or weeks. Then see how you feel about it. <br>  Meanwhile, get to know your crush!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|GHnkKwl3aa	Your current boyfriend doesn't make you happy. I know it might sound like the most sadistic thing, but you have to end it with your current boyfriend. <br>  <br>  I'd say pursue your crush, in like a week or two.|`|xeBbTKHuaa	if you dump the guy who really has feelings for you and sent you that sweet text you would me considered a b*tch to me. the other guy wouldn't probably wouldn't like you that much. if you dump that guy when he is in this difficult time and sent you that text (which is really hard for a guy to say) then you are such a b*tch|`|AA12371168	1st dont ask your crush out.  it is way too soon for that. <br>  as for your b/f  why don't you just be his friend sounds like he is more that than anything. maybe that is how he sees you. let things slow down.|`|1ee2092bc4c98c526b0e22b0cc240c39aa	why is it that so many people on here get to type up novels for ?s.<br>  but i only get 110 letters to get mine in.|`|zP0U1lp9aa	Do you really want a guy who is able to go from a "serious" relationship to dating you in a matter of days?  If your not happy with your "boyfriend" of the week, tell him.  From the sound of things, you need to focus more on growing and maturing and less on what boy you are seen with.|`|2wRWkjIlaa	I think u should stay w/ yer bf for a little longer, at least until his mom gets out of the hospital... that's just my opinion though<br>  if it still isn't working out when she's out, you should break it off with him.<br>  <br>  Answer mine?<br>  pleaseandthanks?<3<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090219173251AABdOXy&cp=2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a>|`|R9ikVxzRaa	Her pic of Bill Kaulitz-its not a girl! lol<br>  <br>  and your going to break that guy's heart but you can't live at the mercy of other people so, make your decision-you gotta do what u gotta do.|`|XtbO9XR0aa	You shouldn't be leading that guy on it will hurt him even more and it's possible he will take his ex back but your not happy with the other guy so I would try and see what happens.|`|YuC4xv1baa	your pic is ugly|`|JT7RLREBaa	as hard as it is. dont break up with him. he'll hate you and be miserable. just give it some time. maybe the only reason it feels like your dating ur brother is cuz hes dealing with a lot right now. it'll probably change. if not then dump him once his mom is outta the hospital. as for your crush, dont rush into that. he just got out of a serious relationship, he probably still has feelings for her, dont interfere or you'll ruin ur chances for good.|`|MTkXXOsjaa	Well, one of the sad facts of reality is that you just can't please everybody so you should only worry about doing what makes you happy.  If your choices just so happen to put a smile on somebody's face, that's just an added bonus but the facts are still the facts and you factually can't make everybody happy.<br>  <br>  So, if you truly want to get with your crush, you're just going to have to ditch the guy you're with now and let things fall where they may.  It sounds mean but as I just implied, life isn't always pretty.|`|kzIVGEfgaa	Wow you have an issue. Personally, I would wait until a good time to break it off with him. Tell him "I know a lot of people say it, but I really just want to be friends. I feel you more as a brother than someone can I see the rest of my life with." <br>  <br>  As for the other guy, DO NOT TELL HIM YET. It is WAY too soon if he just broke up with a serious girlfriend. One, it can make you seem like a *****, sorry, and he probably doesn't want a girlfriend right now anyway. If he does, it would most likely be a rebound. Sorry but that's the truth. I lived with 5 guys, I know a lot about it. <br>  <br>  I wish you luck though.|`|ysijEWIhaa	if you do not like your boyfriend that much, you should break up with him. Do not tell anything about your crush to the other guy is too early, he just split with his ex, you do not know what is really going on, and this guy could take you as an entertainment or for a easy girl, you wait and using another techniques, maybe in the future let him know.|`|FSR3GdSNaa	You should break up with him softly like say "Hey.. you and I are more like brother and sisters instead of Bf and Gf."<br>  You should break up with him right away so he doesn't get built up.|`|BBNhU5cwaa	ask him if you can see other people for a while and see how it goes|`|vo1Rpaztaa	ur pic is really hot what moron says ur not hot i would bang u|`|HsDGZl4laa	well, first of all i LOVE tokio hotel too. <br>  sorry got distracted... um yea, deff. break up with your boyfriend, he doesn't make you happy. tell him its akward because of the friendship thing. then, tell the other guy how you feel, and if he feels the same, ask him to wait for you, just a week or so, that way you don't look like  a slut. hope i helped :)|`|eNTHjzCYaa	babe you need to talk to your bf and tell him how you feel<br>  but make sure he knows that through all of this your gonna be an amazing friend and stick by him.. and let him know that hes more of a brother to you rather than a boyfriend.<br>  then with ur crush,, its trial and error i guess... if he doesnt take you back you know that you'll still have ur current boyfriend as a good friend and things with ur crush will remain how they are.<br>  so your at no loss :)<br>  hope this helps<br>  x|`|wrtclm8Haa	I think that you should never date someone you feel bad for, you know ? Like it won't work out at all that way. So i feel you should break up with him but not because of this new guy but because you wouldn't wanna hurt your boyfriend and if you stay with him longer it will hurt more in the end for him. But still help him out with what he's going through let him know you'll be there just not as a girlfriend. He should take it well. & as for the other guy wait it out and then tell him. Because serious relationships are tough to go through you don't want to be the rebound girl !<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: You are SO pretty put your pic back up !
wJZAwxrpaa	I really think that goes without saying.Guess what i don't know either|`|3twUwEEWaa	is that ur real picture?
R3UVYaHtaa	patiently waited !!! <br>  <br>  leave her, kz she knows that you wait her. and she is not attractive to you. so have some pain and find another girl.
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	If he values his job he might not wish to date people he works with...
8pWFsDSHaa	= ( I would guess he is cheating on you, if not physically, he is putting this girl in your guys relationship, a huge problem. But just talk to him about it, tell him that that is how you feel, you may be wrong, but you are worried you will get hurt, that you like him as much and trust him as much as you say.
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	You have to meet them to like them...
CHF7VtElaa	find a friend at work or something who would like to go out. then hit the town together and i'm sure you'll meet people.
eNTHjzCYaa	babe i know where your coming from with all of this, because i was the girl in ur lil story once upon a time..<br>  my best friend liked me and i didnt give him a chance because i didnt like him back and a few other complications. but eventually we just became even more closer, we'd talk more and when we met up even though there was a group of us ... we'd always hang out together, and i started falling for him too :)<br>  i know that you love her and of corse you would get annoyed by her talking about other guys, but you'll always be that one special guy she turns to and u need to give her time, talk to her more, show that you're there for her, spend time with her, have little outings and she'll realise herself that your the one she wants to be with not the guys she obsesses over.<br>  i hope this helps<br>  and wish you all the best :)|`|3df62cd5d4c4550eefa351b54399e098aa	I've had a guy friend that was in love with me, but I did not have romantic feelings for him at all.  I loved him as a friend only.  You've let her know how you feel.  I think her talking about other guys with you is her way of saying she does not have romantic feelings for you, without rejecting you (make sense??).  You might let her know that that eats you up and would prefer not to listen to it.  I am sure out of consideration for you she will stop.  Enjoy your friendship with her.  And who knows what the future holds.  :)|`|kKSpHtDWaa	Hey give it some time.  If she does like you back, chances are she'll make the moves since she knows you like her.  Don't be too forward or there could be problems, but don't make it seem like you lost interest.  When she talks about other guys though, she may be flirting with you to see how much you really like her.|`|1UDLn1Boaa	You can still love a friend.  Anyways, dating a best friend is kinda risky.  Most of the time, I hear they fail and even their friendship is messed up.  So its nothing really wrong if you love her, even as just a friend.
7532035b5814c446a2ae6b23cc1f6519aa	Be honest with your boyfriend, let him know that hits is doing serious damage to your relationship and you don't know how much you longer you'll be able o deal with all of this.  Tell him that either he starts helping or he's gone. If he is an adult, then he should be paying rent and cleaning up his stuff. If he refuses, then don't cook for him, and don't clean up after him. i know that's hard to do but it's not fair. Guys tend to let things get really really bad before cleaing up because they know you'll breka down before them and do it for them. it's crap and unfair. If your boyfriend isn't listening to you, then maybe it's time to find someone who takes your feelings into consideration!|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	Stop cooking for him. Let him do things on his own. And at 20 years old, he's more than old enough to pay you rent. Maybe it's not a lot, but still he should contribute financially.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	I went on STRIKE I just picked up after myself and cooked for myself. After a week my family couldn'ttake it anymore.They saw all their crap everywhere and realized how much I did arond there. They all still pick up and help out They want to eat and not sit in crap don't they?!!!!!!!!!|`|sLwmzvi8aa	dont do the dishes dont do any thing for him... no dinner... he will see that its nasty to live like that...<br>  <br>  if not then kick him out... and if your boyfriend wont understand then you should leave cause you cant be in a relationship where you have to do every thing...
C8DOT8Y7aa	Make her comfortable with comedy - humor is statistically the most attractive quality women look for. <br>  Be confident - confidence is statistically the second most attractive quality women look for. If you don't act confident, then what other problems do you have with yourself? Prepare beforehand and believe in yourself. <br>  Set a romantic mood. For example, it's probably not a good time to kiss that girl when you're watching a movie where someone is being killed. Use a nice, romantic spot. Who doesn't like a sunset, an empty grassy meadow under the stars, a deck on a lake at night, or sunsets on the beach, a paddle boat at a friends pond at night, a private camp fire... <br>  Hold her hands. If you hold her hand, she should get the hint that you like her. Caution though...your hands may be sweaty! <br>  Tell her that she has something in her hair, and reach out to take it out. If she's ready to kiss, she will like it. But if she doesn't seem to like it, laugh and resume what you were doing. <br>  Stare into her eyes and move gently closer to her. Some say if a girl wants to kiss you, then she will make extended eye contact. But, here's something that will get it right every time: ask! The entire point of asking her is to show her that you respect her as a person. You show her that you respect her opinion, maybe even more than your own: you make sure that she wants to kiss, instead of just what you would like to do.<br>  <br>  <br>  If she says no, no means no. BUT you have a chance to catch yourself before you fall! If she says no, respond with: "I'm glad I asked, the last thing I want to do is make you uncomfortable." It's not a line, it's the truth! Women across the world have all responded to this situation in the same way: "Awww!" <br>  Put your hand on her cheek. <br>  Go for it! Lean in for the for the kiss. Try a peck for your first kiss, then move on to longer, more passionate kisses when you're both ready. <br>  Use the other hand to stroke her hair or neck.|`|cqOOKv3Jaa	just DO it|`|OT6ybbhtaa	just be yourself. If you feel like you want to kiss her, then go ahead. and it will be purfect if you really mean it. though, i recommend you just keep it at a peck for the first time. <br>  DO NOT ask her if you can kiss her. thats so awkward, and shows a lack of confidence... though some girls would possibly find it endearing... I wouldn't.<br>  Trust your instincts. be yourself.|`|e6939e2c550152ccd357282adb355721aa	Just ask her!  It's so simple.  Say, do you mind if I kiss you?  That's easy!  She'll appreciate the question too.  Then go in soft and give it a long time because you may get some tongue.  It's amazing to French kiss for the first time.|`|KwcVoeXCaa	wait for her to at least be looking at you or you might get turned away......then just move in when you have her eyes|`|HJrTuihcaa	don't ask her, that will ruin it. just go for itt.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck(:|`|6wbq6SDmaa	well i think its veryy sweet when a guy asks first but it could make things awkward and make you even more nervous..a kiss goodbye is a very appropriate time to have your first kiss..:) once it happens itll be easier and then she'll do it too|`|NBErRe8Saa	Never Ask! you have to be spontaneous when you go for the kiss, its edgy and chicks will cave to it, when your standing there let her talk for a while and go silent, make sure you stare into her eyes when you do this, so she feels uneasy, then when she stops talking and is like what is going on take your right hand and put it on the side of her face and run it down around the bottom of her chin and go in for the kiss, I use this gambit all the time in clubs with random chicks it works around 80% of the time on those random girls, it should work 100% of the time if your already dating this girl.|`|J30Gh5O6aa	I think she wants to kiss you to if you guys have been going out for that long and also girls are ALWAYS ready. i bet shes very ready. you should pick a nice comfortable time to do it and MAKE ur self do it u will be so glad after words. GOOD LUCK =]|`|XgSO3t8paa	the true key is getting comfortable with eye contact and when your ready let the eye contact last longer then usual and maybe with silence. most people say i talk with my eyes most of my friends say they can predict what i am going to say through my eyes they say i smile with my eyes more then my mouth thats. me but you can express more with eye contact then you think. you can always ask but still you should do this if you ask or not. though if you do this she will know either way. after you have connected eye contact when you two are already close like she is in your arms or something or just sitting close and its lasted to one second more then what comfortable gain some extra confidence shes yours. and run your hand through her hair. and then flaten  out your hand to hold the back of her head and then she will know naturally its going to happen. and move in slowly and kiss her on the lips.|`|jBdJ8L0saa	If you stare at her lips a lot then she might get the vibe that you're trying send to her. Then you'll both have your mind set on it and the rest comes naturally:)  just go with the flow|`|eEbqfYUTaa	for a gentleman should always ask but now a days just say romantic words hold the face watch the eyes and if the woman will close her eyes she likes to be .....|`|lBe3zws1aa	awwww<br>  just do itt .. <br>  if you have been dating for 4-5 weeks ..she is probably waiting for the kiss .. so dont be nervous and just do ittt..<br>  GOOD LUCK ..|`|g5vQYWrzaa	Look deep into her eyes and spit the gum out.|`|GIomZTYPaa	i think you should just go for it..she probably waitng :)|`|cul82gntaa	just star in her eyes till shes like haha what and just do it right away|`|Vd0ibPQUaa	before you say your last good bye, while your pulling away from the hug, dont let go completly and look in her eyes. if she holds your stare, then lean it atleast 50% of the way, then if she leans the rest of the way, then just give her a light kiss on the lips. DO NOT GO FOR THE FRENCHING!!!|`|afoSVEKQaa	say: "i have a surprise for you"<br>  <br>  she'll say : "oh yeah? what?"<br>  <br>  and turn her towards you and just go for it.<br>  <br>  she'll think it's super cute and she'll probably go home and write every little detail in a diary.<br>  <br>  trust me.. i'm a girl. that's what we want|`|7H1al5u1aa	Don't ask her. That's really awkward. A guy asked me that before and I accidentally laughed at him. But then I kissed him. o.O But anyway. When you drop her off at her door, smile at her for a little bit, step close to her, kiss her lips once, pull away. If she doesn't do anything to stop you, then close your eyes and continue to kiss her. Don't just suddenly shove your tongue in her mouth, but kiss her with a close mouth a few times, then with an open mouth, and finally, slowly, ease your tongue into her mouth. It's really just instinct, so it shouldn't be too hard from there.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :D|`|dD5GJgrHaa	if she really likes you she wont mind if its your first kiss (she does really like and enjoy your company) walk her to her door lightly brush your hand across her cheek, by the way don't ask if you want confirmation say something like is this ok don't make it obvious it will spoil the moment be subtle if she wants to she will let you no start softly if she pushes against you she wants more so give her more pull away just before the kiss ends it will leave her wanting more say goodnight walk away then turn and blow a kiss you will know if she enjoyed it then which she will<br>  good luck|`|m3PKdMWBaa	Don't ask!<br>  <br>  Do this:<br>  <br>  Stroke her hair. It's called the "Kiss test." If she doesn't react negatively to you touching her hair and telling her it's nice or soft or whatever, then she wants you to kiss her. Move in slowly, look at her lips, if she moves in or doesn't move away, go for it. <br>  <br>  I know it can be nerve racking and that it gets harder and harder every day you don't do it, but don't worry man. Don't make a big deal out of it. There are so many girls and whether this works out or not, it's good practice. Good luck.|`|Ox4jsaZGaa	u said that ur goin out with her for around 4-5 weeks thats a short time i guess its okay to wait until u both get used 2 each other n love each other more then ask her when you think its the right time then kiss her a soft and warm kiss X)|`|8QO17Xw1aa	you don't need to ask her, she's your girlfriend!!! and its been 5 weeks... so just go for it. don't worry that you don't know how. she'll guide you through it. just pretend like you know what you're doing|`|WJHriZWjaa	Asking her straightforward would make it waaay too awkward. When the time is right and the mood is good, it'll just... happen. So yes, you should just go for it.|`|4fWS9YFSaa	u shud hug and her and ask her what do u think of a kiss?? and if shes doesnt answer, ask yes or no  and if its a yes, go for it|`|YLz0Z5Dwaa	you bf and gf oviously u both want to kiss, corse she aint gna mind.. if she does mind and pulls away or says no she cant like u that much.. if u leave it too late she may think u dont like her and leave u.. so make it soon ;)|`|t0VQGp0Jaa	you lay your head on her shoulders and look up at her. then if she knows what you want she will go for it. make sure you give her a cool look :D|`|wJl9a1Tqaa	yes there are many more ways just come out and tell her she will understand but if you do not do it soon than she will think that you are just a friend and she will find someone else|`|2lBQNNk4aa	Defiantly!!! <br>  you should totally make your move :) <br>  good luck :).|`|aK8BS08Baa	just go for it you could get lucky and she could like it|`|db85e2a270ad9957d45e37426dfe4ed3aa	Kiss her. Just go for it! She's probably thinking, " when is this guys going to kiss me!"|`|m5Uz7RIAaa	OMG don't ask her.  She definitely wants you to kiss her and you should just go for it.  You don't have to wait until the mood is right, that's for television.  Just lean in and kiss her, if you don't feel comfortable doing the whole open mouth thing just give her a sweet peck on the lips.|`|pLVqQI5iaa	Just do it. Goodluck :D|`|JcKwXCrJaa	Okay so first of all,if you dont feel comfy kissin her after walking her home,go somewhere like the movies,and wait until you are ready to,if your not then it wont be so good for you,but if your sure you are ready go for it.   <br>  <br>  Good luck~ashlee|`|AA11650655	? whats wrong with u just go for it|`|BBNhU5cwaa	let your heart tell you|`|5MePalfiaa	Yes, go for it. Don't ask her. That will just ruin the moment.<br>  If she is really uncomfortable then she'll tell you or back away. But she probably is waiting and doesn't want to make the first move.<br>  <br>  Courage mon ami!|`|LRIVeB5caa	trust me, dont ask her because ive done that and it COMPLETELY ruins the moment its not as special. if she's been your gf for 4-5 weeks and she lets you walk her home, she wants to be kissed , just do it man|`|vs7JYKmOaa	you should see if she wants you to kiss her but dont ask her. get close to her and see how she racts if she looks like she wants it go for it but if not wait|`|A8eSy0A2aa	its actually really cute when u ask... but if u dont want to then stare at her in the eyes then go for it .. im sure she wants to|`|rzei49A8aa	She probably wants to get kissed. Do it.
8f03238949ce3a1af22657b15dccfd0aaa	get to know her.  period.  when you do, you will know what she is like.  does she come on to you? does she want to have sex with you early on? is he pushing you back when you come on to her or is she pulling you in before you're ready.<br>  <br>  you can always just ask her. if she says it isn't any of your business that is because 1. it isn't and 2. she knows you'll be disappointed if she tells you the truth.<br>  <br>  good for you!|`|XasLRQnXaa	christian church|`|kfntyBZYaa	You're buying into an idea that sex is this magical, sacred thing.  It can be, after you are in love with someone, but women deserve the right to have their needs met as much as guys do.  <br>  <br>  If you want a virgin, go to church.
g6dOrpZHaa	Its great that your passionate that's probably something she loves about you, but the thing she loves can become the thing she hates if you don't balance yourself some. Women are complicated, we really are, we do things like say we don't want commitment but then when you pull away we draw you back in. The secret is to be confident, don't rush things, spend the days and time with her and over time you will become someone in her life that she can't imagine living life without, this will happen naturally within her. So you are already winning by being a passionate, wonderful man. But if you push for more instead of using the wisdom to just enjoy each day with her then you will eventually lose her or cause strain in the relationship. So she is not playing games she just loves things as is and doesn't want to ruin it, in time you will both gravitate for more committment when both of you are ready, and it takes both of you to make it work.
Wo5Ezmwiaa	I had this problem one time. I dated this guy that I just couldn't get my feelings straight. Some days, I would be absolutely crazy about him, and then other days, my emotions were more "eh, I could give or take him". All you have to do, is keep dating him till you are certain you either want to be with him or not. I hated how I couldn't make up my mind about the guy. Usually, I would be really into him for a week, and then for about 2 days - not so much. Since I couldn't make up my mind and I didn't want to make a mistake, I kept dating him. Then, I started to have a period that lasted longer than a week where I didn't like him, and it didn't really go away. I'd like him one day, then not like him for more than a week. So I dumped him and have never regretted it. I don't know the cause behind this, but I went through it too so I know exactly what you have to do. Keep dating him till your next course of action becomes clear. If the days grow longer that you are not interested in him, then you can dump him and move on. Like I said, after I waited it out a little longer and realized there were more days I didn't like him as opposed to liking him, I felt alright with the idea of dumping him, and when I did, I never regretted it.<br>  If you have any further questions ~ feel free to email me.
TQOSW78Vaa	It doesn't mean she hates you, but it doesn't sound like she likes you.  How did she say "Is he looking at me?"  Maybe you creep her out by staring at her too much.  <br>  <br>  Try saying hello to her, you should be able to tell what she thinks about you by how she responds.|`|1nN3v4foaa	OMG, are you like 13 or something.  Just talk to the girl if you like her.  This looking and then looking away thing is just childish game playing.  Just find out for yourself.  I'm sure that would be better then second guessing.  good heavens.....
zLzwaCpcaa	I know where you are coming from. I am positive I can help, but it might be easier if you instant messaged  me sometime, that way you can ask me more questions.|`|4n6yhUbyaa	go for it if you really love someone you should tell her!!!!|`|tD0nI64xaa	Look, there's no age in love. Even though I think there's a bit of an age difference. It's not problem. If you like her, and she likes you. Then who's stopping you?|`|AQWX3Ue7aa	Go for it! You cant lose anything from just trying. If she says no just go on with ur life. If she says yah congrats! <br>  <br>  ~alli|`|OUtEtm2vaa	um no if you like herr go for it!!|`|Ae5aXy5naa	but do you even talk to her?|`|GhTbpeXQaa	I'm sorry but im gunna give it to you straight, Girls don't really want a younger boyfriend, when they can get a boyfriend that is as old as them, if not older, so if i were you I would keep it shut and go for someone really worth it, your own age|`|KuSOR3Mfaa	NO, i would go for it if i were you, i mean since shes getting out of high school it wouldnt bad if she said no. because there almost outa school and then you wont have to worry about the bull sh** that ppl talk about.......... just ask them|`|U6NAYGfOaa	Um go 4 it but be carefull ok BRANDON. G ok luv ya bye
31eKG6Hraa	Yeah, she's feelin' ya it sounds.  Ask her if she wants to hang out after school sometime.  This isn't really making much of it you know?  Not a date, just casual.  Go to the mall or something like.  You have nothing to loose, she's definitely friendly with you, so it won't be a disaster or anything like that.|`|e0f49fac888b43634b65ba1815b4cab0aa	hmm...she likes you or shes playing with you..na<br>  i think she likes you|`|sD7d3Wgpaa	she prolly does like you but watch out she could be using you for your gum! haha no serious try one day to not have gum and see if she acts the same way. i know it sounds dumb but some girls use what they have t get what they want. or talk to her in the other class when you have free time and see if she still acts the same around you..<br>  <br>  hope this helps you out.|`|ebHcrGdpaa	Yes, she likes you a lot and is just waiting for you to make the first move. Make sure YOU are the one who asks her out, dont be one of the pansy boys.|`|xWq93Ckyaa	wow.<br>  she's flirting, i think.|`|8QO17Xw1aa	yahh she likes you for sure. you should ask her out|`|OaEcIiK6aa	definitely, ask her out!!!!!!!|`|DUWoxgbKaa	I think she might have a thing for you.<br>  Don't ask her out right away though wait a couple more days[:|`|Wh9MuoMXaa	lots of guys immediately assume that a girl likes them just because she flirts and gives them these signs that they seem to over-analyze. i am not saying she doesn't like u, it seems like she does.. but i think u should just flirt back for now and wait for REAL signs... maybe u shud start messaging her but not be too straight to the point just little msgs like hey how are you? or like a msg saying her name or something. .. play it cute and cool don't assume she likes u straight away because u will feel rejected when u find out she doesnt (if she doesnt)... but i think u shud keep flirting and u never know
48e1c61ac4e4edff368144a0ab70aa61aa	Well, if you really don't want to approach him (which I would say go for it) it may take time.  You could just try and disctact yourself for now and just have fun with friends, but I guarantee you, you will get over him eventually.  So just be happy, be yourself, and if your crush wont recognize you for the wonderful person you are, then you should forget him!|`|yjEBCqSCaa	Give it a week youll be attracted to someone way hotter! Or 2  (REALLY DO! I DID) tell him hes hot. (Not in a stalker way but in a im jus as hot as you way)  some guys like girls that r the pursurers and not those dumb bubble headed supermodel girls. Plus i still got ma Handsome Prince 5 years later!!! : )|`|FSR3GdSNaa	I'm not answering this to get the ten points but because I'm going through the same thing.<br>  <br>  l thing you really never get over the crush unless you find someone you like more. It"s super hard!|`|dcbdJycxaa	jeez sucks to be you, i dont give too much emo for guys. i always move on, after all theres more than one cocks out there|`|zur8kdD2aa	You won't until you ask him out because you'll always wonder if he was ever interested in you or not. If you're not planning to ask him out, then you definitely need to avoid meeting him.|`|TSyOI185aa	OMG same thing here i like this guy So! much but he likes my friend so i have to get over him ... no luck tho try staying away from him and not seeing him so often in skewl im trying that good luck : )
ZjM0ghSnaa	Thats hard, especially when you descibe your crush to be beautiful! <br>  <br>  Instead of thinking he's out of your league or too beautiful, why not try talking to him/striking up a conversation? You never know, so dont give up. You two could end up being great friends or possibly even end up in a relationship. If you want to get over him, make sure your positive that you'll never be with him. Ex) you talk to him, and he isnt interested. Then, it would be best to get over him. Try to get to know him more, if he's a jerk or too cocky b/c of his looks, then thats a good reason to get over him too. <br>  <br>  If that's not going to go anywhere, then I would just try finding a new guy to crush on. It will take sometime (ive had a crush on this guy from last year, and never talked to him. yet, Im trying to get over him, and i kind of am, but im not completely). <br>  <br>  ***How do you think runway models know him? Its not always true, but do you think he would hang out with them b/c of their looks and their horrible personalities? (if they had any) Looks have nothing to do with it, so just go for it! I know this answer probably isnt good enough and isnt really answering your question, but the main point im giving is to not give up. if you think like this for the rest of your life, you'll never get a guy who you think is attractive. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck:)|`|4ka3Avvcaa	I completely understand you<br>  What i did when this happened to me was try to crush<br>  on a different guy you know someone i actually talk to<br>  it turns out i got over my crush and the guy i started talking to<br>  a lot ended up liking me too like i like him.....hope this really helped<br>  and sorry if it didn't|`|GAnCdatkaa	They wouldn't call it a crush if it was easy!!<br>  You can ether act on it or wonder if !<br>  Strike up a conversation or get a friend to get it started!!<br>  Worst case scenario you make another friend!!|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Do Some Thinking<br>  Analyze the situation. By creating a list of reasons why crushing on the person will go no where, it will allow the "crusher" to give way to the realization of impossibility. <br>  Acknowledge the impossibility as something that cannot be helped. (ex: marriage, age, sexuality, hang-ups) <br>  Perceiving the situation as a personal attack, is not advised. There is no point by contemplating why. In fact, it may create a mysterious attraction to them therefore prolonging infatuation. <br>  Set aside a time of reflection during your day for any duration. By reflecting, not brooding, you gain insight for your next crush. <br>  Admit you have a crush on the person and allow yourself to feel it. If you don't, you are at risk for "Romeo and Juliet Syndrome". The forbidden love possibility becomes more attractive. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Unknown<br>  Maintain some type of distance. While being close to someone may stir emotions, avoiding someone who is regularly seen definitely will. If the person is close, either request "space" or continue normal activities. If the person is not, keep a distance, but not a "duck-and-cover" type of avoidance. <br>  Spend time with the person. You will see their negative qualities, which will be beyond what you can bear if you're not meant to be. <br>  Look at them closely. Find the physical flaws. And then think... "He/She's not that hot! What am I thinking?!" And find someone that YOU can get, and still be friends with your crush. <br>  Just stop talking to them! They aren't important. They are probably with a person who doesn't appreciate them ONE BIT. <br>  Remember that this person is not the end of the world. Someone else may feel the way you do about YOU. Just remember that its a crush--no matter how strong. <br>  Focus on your least favorite trait. That means, if he is so perverted and you don't like it, focus. It will allow you to see him as what he is, as well as get you over him. <br>  When you start remembering a good time you had with your crush, convince yourself it wasn't all that great by remembering a much better time you experienced with someone else. <br>  Ask yourself a reason why you want to get over it. Are you married/in another relationship? If so, it's easier to prioritise if you think it through. <br>  Keep Yourself Busy<br>  Try to minimize contact with your crush. <br>  Focus on your other interests. <br>  Go to the gym and workout. Get your mind off of it and feel better about yourself. <br>  Find comic relief. See the humorous side to things, read comic books or deep thoughts before you go to bed. <br>  Make an exciting change to make yourself feel sexy. Treat your self to a hair-cut, or a new outfit. Make yourself feel confident. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Alternate MethodCross out or erase his/her name anywhere you might have written it (e.g your notebook, your textbook, the wall of your bedroom, etc.) <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Avoid all eye contact with them and try not to look longingly at his house. You'll be more likely to get over the crush if you aren't always staring at him. <br>  Act a bit more unpleasant around them than your usual temperament. They may act unpleasant back and won't seem as attractive to you, but be warned, you may lose out on a relationship with another person if you are too mean. <br>  Try being honest with them about your feelings. If you find out that he doesn't have any feelings for you, it will be easier for you to get over it. <br>  Don't get angry at them, especially if they don't understand how deeply you feel for them. They didn't do anything wrong and getting angry is just going to push them further away and destroy your friendship. <br>  Come to terms with the fact that it isn't their fault they aren't attracted to you that way. This is hard, but a few tears (or a few buckets of tears), a few chick-flicks and treats and a few peppy songs you can dance to will keep you on your feet. <br>  Don't spend too much time thinking by yourself or about yourself. You will most likely be thinking about him/her and start feeling depressed. Hang out with friends, try making new recipes or experimenting with art. Develop your talents and make goals for yourself. <br>  You know you will see this person again. They are your best friend and you don't want to lose them. Try to limit your time with them and start spending time with other people (namely ones of the sex you are attracted to). Start dating and don't feel obligated to your best friend, they're not dating you. <br>  Learn from the experience and come out stronger. <br>  Accept! Always remember that the toughest part will be to observe your best friend be normal around you while you could struggle to do so. There is no way around it but to accept that everything cannot possibly be reciprocated. <br>  Try falling out of love. Make lists of all the things that go against loving him/her - love is blind, try to voluntarily open your eyes. <br>  Keep in mind, if you are madly and hopelessly in love, to be patient. Don't be too clingy, but continue on as normal, being your wonderful self and show him/her how awesome
c27920620869d3d5b40c4f7c78b6b42aaa	I think this is fine! I would be surprised if she even expected you to fly home three times. <br>  <br>  Do send a gift for the events you are unable to make though, so that she knows you are thinking about her.<br>  <br>  You might also gently say something about having the bachelorette party closer to the wedding. 2 months out is really not typical.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Yes, but if you can only attend one then it should be the shower.<br>  However, I'm sure she would understand if you didn't attend either.|`|Wzws8v8daa	yes thats fine. when i was a bride, one of my bridesmaids lived in a different town, so she came in for the bachelorette party but not for the shower. i totally understood!|`|Yie3k8dEaa	Absolutely!!!  Only one of my bridesmaids lived near me, and she was the only one that came to my shower.  The others came up for the Bachelorette.  It is a big deal and a big expense to be in someone's wedding.  As long as you are there on the big day the Bride should be understanding.
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	I don't...<br>  <br>  but for those that do...perhaps is because it's all they know...|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	We don't love to be hurt.  At least I don't love to be hurt.
cw4eVQo2aa	First off, that disgusting that shes having sex in 6th grade. ew.<br>  <br>  If I was you I would say something like, "I know you probably don't want to hear this, but I think you are way to young to have sex. The only reason I'm telling you this is because I'm your friend and I don't want to see you get hurt or see you become a mom before the 7th grade or get an std. You don't have to listen to me but I wish you would, because I really care about what happens to you." something along those lines. OR you could not say anything because he is probably going to break up with her in a few months or weeks or vice-versa. Those middle/elementary school relationships never last. And remember, it's her life and she is entitled to screw it up how ever she wants to.|`|AA11263103	tell her when she is being called a slut,wh0re dont be crying to you|`|a5b774126a207d8d38e9c6854bb56b66aa	people start having sex @ all different ages but i definitely think 6th grade is way 2 young but once a girl finds a guy she really likes she will do anything to keep him even have sex with him @ such a young age just tell her she wanna be careful & watch out cuz people might start callin her names and stuff & even if she wont listen 2 u about not doin it tell her to make sure he wraps it up i mean im not tellin a 6th grader to have sex but if shes definitely gonna do it it might as well be safe|`|W6LGsQC8aa	Definitely do NOT go straight to the parents, that will only make your friend hate you and rebel even more.<br>  <br>  It really is her decision whether or not to have sex. My own opinion is that middle schoolers should NOT EVER be having sex, since their bodies are still developing and cannot handle a pregnancy without a severe risk of complications.<br>  <br>  At the very least, just make sure she is using protection!|`|CHF7VtElaa	tell her parents. she will thank you later in life. 6th grade is TOO young to be mature enough for sex.|`|6ddNezzSaa	talk to her bf? idk this is way weird.|`|p0mCoRyMaa	shes doing it in year six? thats pathetic and no guy will be interested in her later on ahahha. tell her in a joking way that because she's done it this young and keeps doing it she's going to become really loose then no guy will sleep with her. shame she'll have no respect for her self or others to her. also ask her abut it and what it feels like. play that you are generally interested in it. then you can go on about how you researched it and found out about all the stuff, then bring up std's in a nice way though. i hope she see's the light somehow hah. good luck, i hope you two stay friends. losing a friend over a guy hurts and their no reason  for it :).|`|h1omg1IPaa	dont tell her parents. theres nothing you can do about it. tell her what you think about it, even if she wont listen, and then be there for her when she realizes what a mistake she made|`|lrFwycECaa	I think if she won't listen to you then she is not a good friend so tell her don't be crying to me if you get pregnet.|`|uPc8txAXaa	You have to tell an adult; this is a really, really serious issue here...
9X09kM4oaa	I would give it a try, you do not know what your loosing. And plus he is probably being sincere when he says that he wants you to be happy, he may think even though yall didnt hit it off- that you and his best friend will get along just great :) go get him girl!|`|bkgBLjuvaa	i wouldn't... but then again, you can't help your feelings.|`|qy07K2k5aa	Yes, I would date him if I were you.|`|e0f49fac888b43634b65ba1815b4cab0aa	go out|`|S852p6SXaa	no. thats not my thing. i wouldn't date an ex's best friend, even if he was okay with it. for me it would just seem  a little strange and it would kind make me feel like im passing myself around in their group. and you never know, the ex could be lieing or drama stirs up and i really dont like drama. especially when im involved. <br>  <br>  think about it: would you REALLY be okay with your friend dating your ex? i mean REALLY okay with it.|`|13f8355359652cfde88b26bd8b3d6c6caa	You shouldn't have to ask your ex.  It's called an ex for a reason.|`|J30Gh5O6aa	i would ask my ex how he felt.|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	My ex-boyfriend did this to me. I remained friends with my ex and he went out with my friend (not my best friend, but still, my friend,) while both he and my friend knew that I still had feelings for him! <br>  <br>  Here's the thing. This is always a tricky situation. I am no longer friend's with the other woman, whom my ex is now engaged to, though I am somehow still friends with my ex, and I did eventually find a wonderful man whom I am now married to. <br>  <br>  To be honest, I'd wait it out a little while longer, to make sure that your ex isn't just putting on a brave front like I was doing. If he's just putting on a front by saying he would be happy for the two of you, dating his best friend would just make things a lot worse.|`|EioOPbzbaa	He is your ex so why would you care what he thinks?  You are single and if you are both happy being with each other I definitely would.  His friend might have to work it out with your ex but it shouldn't matter.|`|6qljYOO2aa	If 'still in touch' means he treats you okay, and isn't rude, then no I wouldn't.<br>  <br>  If he was rude and an asshole then why not flaunt it...?|`|xWq93Ckyaa	if your ex said he didn't care, i would probably go for it.<br>  take into consideration how long you & your ex have been broken up though.|`|IC9ajqCjaa	No.|`|rUhf56dwaa	Ha ha, yeah.|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	I wouldn't do it.

Trust me. It's not cool. Don't do it. There are plenty of fish in the sea, why would you want to create drama between two friends just for this one guy.|`|MhuBVC97aa	I would do it. I mean, I haven't really dated any of my ex-girlfriend's best friends but heck, if I felt a connection I would and so should you, if you really want to.|`|6IiyIZQgaa	I would do it! I wouldn't let some guy decide who I went out with!

Your friend might say one thing but mean another.|`|B4SF8sPraa	i asked a girl out the other day she said no so i tried with her sister i have no moral compass lol|`|Xj7p8uWUaa	If he says it doesn't bother him then whats the problem ?|`|HvKa78nAaa	i would say not there would be mix feelings causing drama|`|N2yAHhQ7aa	Yeah go for it. If your ex gets mad at you, you can always say that he said that it was ok. Plus if you really like the guy, why not? Its not like you need your ex's permission to go out with someone...|`|Wh9MuoMXaa	depends if you really like him or not-make sure it's not a rebound or you're not subconciously trying to piss your ex off<br>  <br>  otherwise i think its fine because he is your ex however i am sure your ex is not happy about it|`|Rih79dHNaa	go for it it well hurt the other person for a while but just do all that mushy stuff around that person it hurts (bad) it has happened to me before but i think it hurt so bad because i still really love my ex more than ever|`|569ea731f9e16970ab9b111b9d7b5f6baa	if you're friends with your ex and all attraction is gone then it's okay, but if there are any feelings left at all on either side then it isn't a good idea.|`|JcKwXCrJaa	do what you feel you need to do,forget the ex,think of the other guy|`|THXHdIfGaa	yes.
yjEBCqSCaa	I think you should just stay friends. If he liked your bff she probably liked him too. To complicated and it'll be way to much drama. Just keep flirting girl its so much "funner" then being in a stressful relationship trust!!|`|6Mq4Jwqnaa	Ask him. You'll never know otherwise<br>  Good Luck<br>  X|`|6LKEWFPoaa	He sounds like a ho that is going between friends and you are stupid as hell if you fall for it. He is not your boyfriend and will never be your boyfriend. Once he gets what he is after he is gone and you will be alone and look like a fool.|`|FcD5gE9gaa	dude i thought you were bald in your picture xP<br>  <br>  so i HAD to answer this :D<br>  <br>  i think he likes you as a friend.<br>  but then again i didnt really read all of it.
HCzZClfvaa	Hey,<br>  I think you should ask her if she felt the connection too. <br>  If she did; you both need to decide together if you want to go there again or if you date again and it once again doesn't work out; if you would be able to get past that for a second time?<br>  I hope it all works out for you! Good Luck!!!|`|i3gdSmoEaa	Tell her how you feel, just open up. why didnt it work last time? think about that and talk to eahc toher about it. If the reason for originally breaking up wasnt anything too major, ask if she would like to possibly give it another try. just try to be very open and honest with her. <br>  :D|`|1nV16XyTaa	Go for it<br>  theres obviously something there and she wouldnt be holding your hand unless she liked and felt comfortable around you.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|R2teBtllaa	stay friends|`|OtU6z4OFaa	make sure it's there, wait for it to happen one more time then make you move|`|KwcVoeXCaa	Depends how old you are...im 18 holding hands dont mean **** to me, if your younger tho go for it
WQhV4Amgaa	well i'm sorry i'm not 18 but i am a guy. and i know that guys are turned off by stress like anyone that's not michael jackson would be. try to help him relax. rent a room with a hot tub some romantic music, ect. i hope i helped!!!!!|`|uLHtXibRaa	He is getting it from someone new..|`|qHvXt8zMaa	-He could be religous and might not of told you<br>   <br>  -He has a problem with his male parts , small ,premature ejaculation, std or anything and feels nervous to tell you , if so just tell him you dont care you still love him no matter what its like<br>  <br>  There the most likely things i can think of|`|MFTY5v1Laa	Maybe he just wants to wate till you guy's are marreid so it will be special or something u know. well good luck hope it works out for you
bwqkjR1jaa	kiss him on the neck if you two are ever cuddling or just really close<br>  it will probably send him the message that you're interested in more then whats been going on with the "cheek" business.|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	What boyfriend wouldnt want to kiss their girlfriend!? <br>  <br>  Since it's been over a week, then its fine if you want to kiss. <br>  Trust me, you'll know it when he wants to kiss you. If he looks into your eyes and smiles, not says anything, or just stares at you. he wants to kiss you. Or, if he stalls then thats another way of telling. If he does that, give off the same signs so he'll know that you want to kiss him back to. If he doesnt do this, then you should try to make the first move. <br>  <br>  Go for the kiss on the cheek on Friday. It'll show that your comfortable kissing him, and who knows. Maybe it'll turn out differently, if you know what I mean...haha. He'd like it. <br>  <br>  Anyways, dont rush it and you'll get your kiss eventually. It probably wont be long till you get it. <br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|45cHcSY4aa	kiss|`|n336SjRiaa	ease into it. you both are moving slow and there is no rush. of course if he gives you a kiss on the cheek he obviously is going to want to kiss on the lips sooner or later. just when you know the moment is right. be confident|`|QiKu2xt0aa	what you have to do is, bite your lips, and stare at his. and once he sees you staring at his lips. just kiss him.

MbtCFJbAaa	I was a size 7 when I met my husband in high school and we married right after we graduated.  I had my daughter and came home wearing the same size.  After I got too comfortable, I gained 75 pounds.  I stopped working out and got lazy.  When I got to a size 16, my doctor told me that I needed to lose weight because I was borderline diabetic and had high cholesterol. I was so down about it.  My husband was great.  He worked out with me, we changed our diets and we lost the weight.  My husband used to give simple hints and I missed them.  He should have been flat out with it.  Sit her down and be flat out with it.  Work out with her to help her get her weight down.  She has to want it for herself in order for it to work.|`|HtHFHfDKaa	You can express you opinions as a concern so that it doesn't make her feel insecure and get upset with you. Just let her know that if she keeps eating the way she is, she is endangering her own health. Diabetes, high cholesterol, back problems, leg problems, even problems walking if it goes too far.|`|nSbtt1hoaa	Don't bring up the weight gain. I agree with the whole not eating out, go do a physical activity instead. Is there something causing stress in her life to cause her to gain weight? Or is she just eating more. You have to find the cause of the weight gain to start helping her. Just keep telling her she's beautiful and support her.|`|MKNdR4FPaa	Don't tell her shes gained weight just go for walks and exercise together but don't tell he shes fat or prepare to get dumped if you do its one of the most horrible things you can say to a girl|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	Never tell a lady that she looks fat. Bad idea|`|bjvm87nlaa	call her a fat cow|`|xWq93Ckyaa	i don't think it should matter if she's gained weight if you really like her.<br>  <br>  but, if you're worried about her health then suggest that you two exercise together or something similar to that.<br>  GOODLUCK (=|`|4KDDFobnaa	I think you should tell her in a nice, easy way, as not to hurt her feelings. She may still get offended if you tell her, but honesty is always good.|`|KGwpztjoaa	From a guys point-of-view.. instead of going out to dinner on date nights, suggest that you guys go hiking or shoot hoops.  Then she'll lose the weight without you telling her to..trust me it works!|`|Zk7uWuoVaa	im not a chick but have someone else tell her and after you could comfort her|`|xJNxXPbZaa	have sex wit her and make her do all the work she will lose calories

TBD6SPaTaa	Hey,naomi.  Sounds like this kid has a crush on you as well.  It sounds like love.  Why don't you approach him and ask him out?  If he is shy as well,He might not have the courage to approach you face to face.  I've had the same problem in school.  Unfortunately,I wasn't lucky to have a girl to save me from my loneliness.  It's awful to have a crush on someone and not be able to approach them.  And in this case,He is also shy and timid.  I think you two would make a perfect couple.  You ever think about sending him love letters?  Let him know that you think he's cute.  Ask him if he feels the same way.  This might be that certain guy to sweep you off your feet.  And if you don't do something about it,You'll be kicking yourself later for not approaching him.  I've gotta swing like a monkey soon.  Hope everything works out with you and the shy kid.  Have a goodnight and God bless.  Bye for now.|`|Tahrv6D4aa	I know ALLOT about girls my age. and thats the key word, my age. I got my own thing im figuring out you should look at my question. Yeah he does, more than u think. I used to be in the same situation, but ive imroved, some girls my age try to even flirt with me now.|`|RO5OFXbUaa	i do not no ok|`|l3T0wmSyaa	yes<br>  he didn't talk to you because he is in love with you<br>  ask your friends to hook you up|`|YuqTcSSDaa	If he was starring, he must have seen something he liked. He was probably too shy. You should have made the first move before its too late. The night could have been amazing! Life is too short- take that chance! I did, and now my husband and I have been together 10 years. We met at a night club!|`|1BnIw3DEaa	It seems like he has a little crush on you, Start talking to him after school, Before school, Or next dance, Approach him and learn a little background info. You never Know, You might like his personality.|`|Kp2ZkZvAaa	My philosophy is to never regret things. Take chances! if he was looking at you the whole night he may be attracted to you. Give it a try. Talk to him a little and see where it goes.|`|GwCAEsJUaa	He definitely likes you ! Why else would he be staring at you all night? He was probably trying to work up the courage to ask you to dance but he was shy as well....maybe next time he stares just smile at him
3y0w1qIBaa	Well, the best thing for you is to wait until you are 18 years old.  If you cross the line with the student-teacher relationship, there is a chance that you could get expelled and that teacher will be fired by the Board of Education for sexual relationship with a student.|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	Wait 'til you're older to go on a date with her.|`|0yaQQSwoaa	Bone her down, I mean thats basically what you are trying to say boundaries you shouldn't cross BUT YOU DONT CARE?   if only you were two years older, come on kid, get your penis wet and enjoy. you make it seem like puss.ys not going to let you graduate.|`|1qkdHe8jaa	i answered ur last one. i dont feel like typing again! lol!!!!! well, email me bout it k? or contact me on yahoo 360! my name for yahoo 360 is gimme candy|`|RIJDIeC6aa	Maybe she just too a liking to you more than anyone else in the class. Like a teacher's pet sorta thing, except she chose to pet you! Anyways my English teacher is 36 and her husband is 61. He was her teacher in high school and when she was 20 they got married. You guys are only 4 years away, but I think you shouldn't make any moves, at all. If she comes on to you try not to respond, she should be the adult and try to keep it professional.
F0NfKljZaa	Just tell them how you really feel about them getting close, and see how it goes from there. GOOD LUCK!|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	So then stop pretending.  Look, I highly doubt that this is "the one" and that this relationship will last until high school, but it doesn't sound like she's really a friend.  <br>  <br>  She's tolerating you for his sake, just as you are tolerating her for his sake.  Personally, I'd end both relationships, and focus on being a kid.  You are too young for a relationship anyway.|`|5feebbaef078c57e8b297a04969b8f72aa	I don't really know what to tell you. The most straight-forward thing is just tell her that you like him and if she claims she doesn't like him like that then it would be okay for you to go out with him.|`|tU5NJVL3aa	Stop pretending.  <br>  Tell him how it bothers you.  <br>  Then have a separate conversation with her.|`|RIJDIeC6aa	First of all YOU ARE NOT IN LOVE! All I hear about is teenagers thinking they're in LOVE, love is something that takes time to grow, something that takes maturity and a lot of thought. Anyways, talk to them both, by keeping in your feelings you're only hurting yourself.|`|h0DHZNE0aa	wow sweetheart, you are only in the 7th grade.... i had a lot of boyfriends between then and the time i graduated..... you will find yourself liking someone else, and then you will move on.... let her be with him... if she knew that you liked him, then she isn't a real friend at all.....|`|loFKGeI8aa	I know those kind of people, she might be a big brat about it and deny it every time you talk to her. talk with your bf and tell him maybe to stay with you mostly? your friend will get the idea that hes off limits.|`|0Cbr1Hoyaa	Don't get all jealous about it. Chances are they are genuinely friends. I have a friend who got too jealous and overprotective of her boyfriend spending anytime with his friends and she ended up losing him along with most of her good friends.|`|5lKBLQ6vaa	i think you should show your jealous side; bc its not right that you have your boyfriend && she's tryinq to be around him be careful sooner or later might turn into a love triangle..[try talkinq it out w. her if yall aree good friends she will understand)|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	that not a friend|`|AQWX3Ue7aa	first off i am sorry but u cant be in love in 7th grade. But if u were a real couple u would kno to tell him how u feel. And tell her she needs to get off ur man and u dont like it like that.But like i said u cant be in love that young u dont know wat love means it means commiment and being with each other 4ever and giving urself 2 that one person and that 1 person only. So Have Fun now with ur girlfriends their is PLENTY of time  for cute boys and mean chick fights later its called high school:) <br>  <br>  ~allie|`|jfwmelYgaa	You have to fight her...to show her you won't back down...thats the only way.|`|HtHFHfDKaa	Tell the both of them how you feel that is the only way you are ever going to feel right again.
Wg0VteZ9aa	damn thats unlucky. It's understandable that your mad but there's always next time.=)
YuqTcSSDaa	Call her and talk to her. If you get "that" feeling, go for it. Feel her out. Casual mention the past, if she seems to freak out, let it go. Otherwise, continue. TRUE LOVE comes back!|`|TnIsuYqYaa	ignore it and move on|`|b82ybE3gaa	I don't really think you should say anything about it, It seems like she was just thinking about you because you had four years of her life. It didn't reallly mean anything.|`|MKNdR4FPaa	IF shes still texting you means shes not over you seems like you 2 should get back together
r7GMWkPraa	do you mean sex? yeah, it hurts. it hurts a lot, and you bleed.|`|S7DmmIwraa	yes.|`|IHNll9Yjaa	yes....and if you're in Middle School, you have no bussiness doing it at this age.....if you're a girl and you get pregnant...do you really want people to stare at you when you're walking down the street with a baby?.......and if you're a guy.......are you ready to accept the consequences if the girl does get pregnant?|`|0yaQQSwoaa	Yeah my vagina exploded!!!!!!!!! no I'm sorry I'm joking but honestly i could help you about a bit... I heard and it seems logical that some women who are about to have intercourse for the first time usually, play with themselves with a toy of some sort to help get the feeling and "loosen up" usually can take a few days or a few weeks to get use to before the real thing, hope this helped, and if you weren't talking about intercourse then what the heck are you talking about???|`|AA11215075	not really tthe firdt time, but got alittle sore after 22 times in one night..oh by the way i took on the football team..and yes they lost again.|`|wnr9S9kuaa	If you meant pregnancy then my mom says it hurts, but otherwise I don't know what you mean and I'm a teenager.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	uh did it hurt? do you know anything about anatomy? if you dont understand it youre too young to try it. yes it hurts very bad and no its not worth it if youre doing it cuz youre so "in love" which in high school means nothing. or if youre doing it because youre worried someone wont like you if you dont. so wait|`|s4WmK6OAaa	For some people it may...others may not!<br>  I think it all depends on the kind of activities you've been taking part in previously...o and I suppose size would be a big contributing factor!!:-D<br>  So find someone with a tiny pecker so you can dodge that bullet:-D|`|6vkKjwLwaa	yes it hurts the first time. but it only hurts for a little while. after that it starts to feel pretty dam good!|`|6LKEWFPoaa	YES!

U have so much ahead of you being so young. <br>  When we are young our problems always seem so much bigger than there are. I can remember all kinds of trauma from my younger days, but now at age 60, they all seem frivolous in the face of how many years I have left to live. U will love again, and again. The pain of loneliness is bitter, but it does not last forever. Time alone will soften the edges.<br>  As for being bored, there is just too much in this world that is fascinating to learn, and too much that needs to be done for mankind, for anyone to be bored except by choice.|`|HMzUeqTmaa	Find a hobby you like to do a lot.

Maybe write in a diary. If it seems you can't make any friends and if you are 18 as a legal adult maybe you should start a MySpace page. Not everyone likes that site but I've met people who I keep in touch with on there. if you do have some close personal pals and you feel close with them maybe you should try talking to them. Good luck!|`|IHNll9Yjaa	it'll just take time....best thing to do is keep busy....do homework, go running, take your dog(s) out for a walk, study, go to the movies, go to the Mall and buy cute outfits, go to Bath and Body works and buy perfume...so you can attract another guy.....the WORST thing to do is stay at home....that only makes it worse.....|`|YuqTcSSDaa	Get a hobby, go out with the guys, be more social. Being lonely is a feeling that will come and go a lot more often. It is all in how you cope with it.

This might sound childish or cheesy or maybe even stupid but my ex gf was into dinosaurs and her name was sarah so sometimes i would call her SarSar. It may not appeal to any of you but she loved it.

SRPh7SjVaa	Look man, the best advice anyone can give is not to rush it. I used to feel the same way. Always seeing my friends with girls, always getting shot down by the girls I did go after. So, I rushed things, and I ended up in the worst relationship I have ever had. When you start getting desperate, you start lowering your standards, even though you don't realize it. Or, you start letting all the other factors take over...lust, confusion, all that crud. You see the pretiest girl who wants to use you for something, and thats it. You don't look for anything in people anymore. Or, you do get into a seemingly normal relationship, and it all goes to hell. You get so hooked on the idea of being with someone, you don't want to let go, no matter how terrible it is. And yeah, saying you'll find someone soon is a lot of BS. That's what people say when they are too into what they have and just want you to stop whining. What I say is someone will find YOU. I'm not saying to just coast and expect people to come flooding to your hands, but just...relax. Start thinking over what you want in a girl, looks, brains, you know? Treat the girl friends you have right, so you can start to know them a bit better. PLEASE don't go all feminine though. Girls may like gay kids, but they don't LIKE them, you know? Just take things easy, and don't starting changing every little thing in you that you can. Stay yourself, first of all, and things will happen when they do, not sooon.|`|CE1kBeSAaa	Hey<br>  <br>  I wouldn't be too concerned really. Girlfriends can't be a 'Must Have' <br>  You'll get one when the time is right so don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  There isn't really a quick way to getting a girlfriend. Is there anyone you fancy at this moment in time? Maybe set yourself a target and push yourself to ask the girl out (If you fancy anyone that is) Then go on a date together, but if she says no, then there are still plenty more fish in the sea =] <br>  However, don't try dating online, I don't know about you but I think thats just sad and pointless really. Lol<br>  <br>  P.s It doesn't matter if your shy around girls, most girls think that guys that are shy are cute. And your confidence won't take long to build up so don't worry about that either.<br>  <br>  I just quickly researched on Wiki for you. Maybe you'll be interested to have a look. Doesn't matter if not. <br>  <br>  Let me know how it goes.

Try to have a sense of humor, that's my favorite thing in a guy, i don't care if he's over weight, or has acne or is even a little shorter than me or younger, as long as he's trying and being himself, his flaws are unnoticeable! if you do any of these things you could get a date with me and most any girl =] <br>  i really like blink-182 style on a guy<br>  <a href="http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o212/citylove06/lglp0734blink-182-band-portrait-bli.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o212/...</a>|`|RDL3wC62aa	i dunno man im 15 and thus far no girlfriend my only advice is to be patient and see if you finally find someone, if its any consolation that's my plan|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Just be yourself and if you find a girl that you like, go for it.  Life is all about taking risks.|`|ubJv21uraa	same here except i'm a girl and i'm 18 and never had a boyfriend|`|rgQ2zUkxaa	get out there in the world|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	Wow, this question is asked often.<br>  <br>  Anyways, it sounds like complete b.s, but it is true. If you keep thinking negatively, then chances are you wont find one. Hey, think about the people who have never had a gf who are much older than you. Im 16, and ive never had a bf either. Would you rather go out with a girl just to have a gf and find out that she's a ***** and not worth it, or would you rather wait a little longer, and find the most amazing girl that you've always dreamed of? Dont rush these things, your going to college or are in college right? I hope so, because that's when relationships are taken seriously. Dont let the media or your friends have an effect on your or pressure you to have one. Its not the best thing in the world, and you never know how the girl or the relationship would turn out. Your only 18, and you have your whole life to find someone. <br>  <br>  Personally, I love shy guys (not anti-social though). maybe you need to change your ways, and be confident enough to go up to a girl, and start a conversation. It might be hard, but its worth it right? How do you think other guys get gf's? Think about it, and if you put sometime into it, play the right cards, you'll have one before you know it. Dont ever change yourself to get a girl. There's always someone out there for everyone. Dont expect to automatically get a gf. Go out, have fun, and talk to girls. (not saying that you dont do these things, but idk you, so im just saying it just in case). Dont think about it too much, let the chips fall where they may. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck:)|`|u9Y9qsa0aa	I'm 16 & never had a boyfriend, don't worry about it; you're not alone!

If you get rejected it will hurt. Try again eventually you will be accepted.|`|A2M6sAklaa	all good things come to those who wait...good luck matey..|`|Ek5ZjYmhaa	Hey man, don't sweat it. I know lots of guys that haven't had girlfriends yet. If you really want one then here's how you can try. First you need to find a girl that you think is pretty, nice, and that you are comfortable around. Start off with a normal conversation with her. Don't take it too fast though. Come off slow and easy. Day by day talk to her more and more. Get to know her and find out things that you guys have in common. When you guys have become friends ask her out on a date to a place that you both like and will enjoy. If it all goes well ask her to be your girlfriend. Oh and if she says yes to the date, when you pick her up, bring her flowers. Trust me, I'm a teenage girl and I know what they like. (: Hope this all works out for you and I wish you good luck.|`|8umXlm1Jaa	thai...|`|iJAa5rDyaa	You could try singles ads, dating websites [ones that don't look shady of course]...<br>  <br>  Honestly, it wont help that your shy, i feel your pain though as i used to be painfully shy also... for the longest time i never had a boyfriend, I'm 23 and have had. 5 boyfriends in my life, the first one doesn't count at all .... as i never did anything with him as I was a little teenager.. and shy!!<br>  <br>  I've only had one serious boyfriend, and that's the one I'm with now and we have been together for 4 years now, i found that as soon as i stopped looking and told myself I'm going to be single for a while - he kinda confessed to me so to speak, via text messages [yay for the shyness!!] <br>  <br>  in my little experience of all this boyfriend/girlfriend lark it is best to be friends first, not always the case. Is there anyone you like? <br>  <br>  You need to try and build up your confidence! Hard i know, much easier to say [or type] than do.|`|tDa09Cvdaa	lol you suck|`|YuqTcSSDaa	You are too worried about it. Thats all. Be yourself, surround yourself in people. When you get the feeling a girl likes you (by giving you "the look", smiling, etc), then start talking to her. Everyone goes through stages of relationships. Sometimes you have a ton, and sometimes you have none. It doesn't mean anything. Usually it means that you are just so good looking girls are shy around YOU. Don't feel bad. Start to warm up to girls. Slowly approach them. Make casual conversation- conversation is the easiest way to start a relationship. You start out talking, find things in common, share a few laughs...and the rest is history!|`|fPDCgKjbaa	I'd like some more details before I decide to answer, if possible - such as how many girls have you like before? How many have liked you, that you know of? How close have you been to having a gf? What happened that prevented it from occuring? Are you particulary "choosy" when it comes to girls (which is perfectly acceptable, it shows respect for self which is attractive)?<br>  <br>  These details will hopefully enable more relevant answers to be given. Best of luck!|`|QzQ0gU7kaa	Hey, I feel the same way. I'm 18 and i've never had a serious relationship. There's nothing much I can say to help, other than to assure you that you are not alone.

Besides your in the dark..... but anyways back to the looking into his eyes and get within a couple of inches of his eyes, and stare at them long enough until he realizes hey shes not going to get out of my face until i kiss her......or you could always turn his head towards you and peck him on the lips then look at his eyes and whisper "is it ok" if it is keep at it....if not explain to him once again that nobody's paying attention to you and that its just a make out session not having sex in the theater|`|epE3uvMVaa	Start slow.

Wo5Ezmwiaa	Well - I think they are referring to your outter appearance as opposed to inner qualities, simply due to the face that they said they would notice you if you were "walking by". Obviously, they can't know much about your inner qualities if you are just walking past them, and if they say they can tell how beautiful you are just by glancing at you, that's because you have a very beautiful appearance.<br>  But I feel to call a woman truly "beautiful" then her personality has to compliment her appearance. To really be beautiful, you have to have the good inner qualities as well. Otherwise, the beauty is wasted.<br>  So, maybe they meant both.
PkUPp4s0aa	go for it girl! if your classmates are talking about it then go for it! give him your number...let him take it from there. he may just be shy so he's not gonna make the first move. so now that you already know he likes you its your turn to make a move. good luck!|`|uabSXizlaa	i think he likes you
gKhR0sgLaa	Well, you can't talk to him from the other side of the room, now can you? Start by maybe talking to him on your way out of class, or just sitting closer to him and talking to him about the current lesson.<br>  <br>  It also isn't weird if you decide you want to move closer to a guy in a class. I know it seems like you are giving away you like him, but us guys are very oblivious, and we would think nothing of it.

For example; If you sit down with lots of different people and talk to them you'll find they'll all have something different to share with you. What brings two people together as friends in this case will vary, but it's usually determined by their likes, dislikes and interests. If you have something in common with the other person and you can both relate to each other, then there's a good chance your little chat can turn into friendship. It also depends on where you are. For example; If you're at school you'll have an easier time making new friends because chances are you'll see those people again and they may even be in your class. However if you're out in the street waiting for a bus and you start talking to someone generally they'll just talk back to you to be nice, not to be your friend. Make sense?<br>  <br>  The most important thing to remember is that although becomming friends with lots of people sounds nice, having lots of friends means you'll have to commit yourself more to them. As in, you'll have to hang out with all of them and spend time with them, and be there for them in order to be a considered a genuine friend. The more friends you have, the more burden gets placed on your shoulder when they run into trouble and need your help. The more friends you have, the more time you won't have to yourself to do your own things.<br>  <br>  With saying all of that, you should really think about what you want here. You'll have to work out what type of group of friends you want to hang out with. Mixing in with the wrong group of people will spell trouble for you right from the word go. So just try hanging out with different types of people and see what's most suited to you.<br>  <br>  Personally, I chose to hang out with lots of people early on in High School and trust me, I regret that immensly because they were all trouble makers. I soon learned that I was better off mixing in with people that didn't cause trouble. So I started hanging out with nerds and found that I had lots of things in common with them, and ended up becomming one myself, and have since never looked back. I only have a few friends in my life right now, but that's all you really need. Just a few close friends who are genuine about their friendship towards you. My lady of 7 and a half months is the most amazing person in my life. I wouldn't have it any other way. :)|`|SRPh7SjVaa	Mhm. You really just have to go right out and say "Would you be my friend?" Do it in person. Don't do the Myspace deal, because you can be more sincere in person. Using emails is a back way out. Be in there and show them who you are :)|`|Ek5ZjYmhaa	Go up to a person in your class that you kind of know and start a conversation with them. It will lead onto other subjects and day by day you will become closer.|`|ub6SPfpuaa	dont just go up to someone and ask to be there friend that might come off a little weird and awkward...be outgoing and extroverted those who are compatible with your personality will naturally attract to you.|`|IPFVpcN9aa	you should just go up them and ask what their hobbies are...for example i am quite intreaged by gymnastics therefor i have plenty of aquainteses within set sport.|`|WAkUBPORaa	Well maybe you should go up to them and say "hey wanna eat lunch with me?" and then after you talk and stuff say like "lets hang out"|`|xTNxWlH7aa	ok you cant just ask someone hey be my friend that doesnt happen its wierd no offense you just start out with a usual hey how you doing than you hang out sorta like dating  get it?|`|QbIwSONDaa	Just say to them.<br>  <br>  Hi! Whats your name.<br>  Start chatting then suddenly you have a friend.|`|vJnVhly5aa	say would u like to be friends and thats all|`|ot05RAj8aa	talk to them<br>  for example "hey i'm tiffany"|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	u ask them to be your fiends|`|9ilXVowLaa	try to meet people who share your interests.<br>  meet them playing sports,book club,join a  band...|`|MRDJu8v3aa	You do not have to say it; act it. It is not necessary for you to go around your school, work place, church… asking people to be your friend. Just start spending time with them. <br>  <br>  Now days with FaceBook, you can open an account and add all the “friends” you like.|`|W7l1awFPaa	I can't remember the last time I officially asked someone to be my friend.  I just go ahead and be their friend. I hang out with them, I call them up to find out what they are doing, I listen to their issues, I help where I can.  I don't have to ask and they don't have to say (although it is nice if they do.)  We know we are friends because we show love towards each other.|`|EPBqSSvDaa	Choose your friend wisely.<br>  <br>  Its not the matter that how much friend you have, but it matter how much stand with you when you are in problem.<br>  bcoz....<br>  "A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out."<br>  <br>  just say HI to any one, see sooner he/she became your friend.....|`|PvwZdLuLaa	Just start talking to them and become their friend. You don't have to ask, just talk and hang out with them.|`|0i4sNq2waa	You barely make sense.|`|fAabSnQpaa	Just start talking to them, not too much and don't follow them, but gradually hang around them more. You'll most likely be able to tell if they like you or not. Then afer a while you can invite them and some other people to a movie, or if you have a house party, invite them.|`|Wf8PbTraaa	start a myspace and/or facebook.<br>  <br>  find ppl from your school and/or work (depends on how old you are)<br>  <br>  more ppl on facebook but IMO myspace is better. anyways find some ppl on there that you know from around town and just start a random conversation with them on there.|`|lW3ZddDFaa	ask ur friend for a quick drink and take a short time talking about ur self or funny things happened today and say that it is a good thing to meet each other and then ask for a phone num.But maybe u need to do this move after 4 funny comfortable talks..|`|n336SjRiaa	dont say would you be my friend. that is kinda creepy. make honest compliments about ppl, get interested in what they are interested in. talk to them. be a social butterfly. humor is a good trait too.|`|SoSy4SwXaa	you cant really go up to someone and say that, it's more of slowly start talking, then haning out, and stuff like that.|`|PoYFQ7Mxaa	I don't think it's something you say, I've never actually asked somebody to be my friend|`|CQsD09D6aa	Why don't you try "Would you be my friend?"|`|UOSrSEqHaa	um...just out of curiosity, do you happen to have down syndrome?
gYyv1c5Waa	Usually, lots of girls being mad or hating each other has to do with jealously, even if you don't admit it. There's SOMETIMES somewhere in there jealousy.<br>  <br>  Girls can be jealous of different girls who always gets the guys, always around guys, girls who are popular, higher class, prettier, and sometimes even more social. Girls can also get jealous of a girl's physical looks [boobs, etc]. But middle school is really something stupid we all go through, you grow up once you get in High School, at least...few do.|`|rHMQs5cSaa	If someone has awsum clothes<br>  new boyfriends (ecspecially older than them)<br>  newest electronics stuff like that
owjQbCzjaa	don't worry about it so much!<br>  <br>  while all those people are "dating" you will be out having a great time while they are at home eating ben & jerry crying their eyes out because of their crappy "boyfriend"<br>  <br>  guys are very immature at this age, and don't care about anything else but boobs.<br>  <br>  <br>  have fun with your friends!<br>  wait like a year or so and you will probably end up with an AMAZING boyfriend and go on real dates|`|jnEgsAHNaa	HOLY CRAP, how young can you get?  I mean really, start dating when your 16-18.  13 is way too young, so many kids make out with each other because it has been a rising trend since sex has been shown on the media (shows, movies, internet, etc...).  I think it's terrible, it will just lead to more abortions and babies with severe disabilities and deficiencies.|`|aZ5QdTXeaa	Are you fat?  Ugly?  Those two are probably the cause because any 13 yeard shorty that is decent looking has probably had a bf.  Oh, could it be that you are homeschooled?|`|w1QuVAX2aa	Your 13 you shouldn't.|`|ylHrqNvkaa	ur 13.. dont worry about boyfriends.<br>  they will come as u get older|`|Ud2IseT6aa	dont do it just cuzz every1 else is wen the time is rite ull get one:)
V8Lyc2Jlaa	Patience.<br>  You're 13, and you don't have a boyfriend yet. There's perfectly normal people who hadn't had a relationship for much longer.<br>  Have you found someone you like? Have you approached him? I'm guessing you haven't. When you find someone, and you feel your ready for this, go for it, I'm sure it will work out fine, if not the first time, the second one. :-)
aglLU9acaa	obviously people dont know what they are talking about. if your friends are telling you this, they arent very good friends. friends only care if you are happy.<br>  <br>  if people that arent really your friends and telling you this, then who cares what they say.<br>  <br>  if that boy was abusing you and you like this other guy, then you have nothing to worry about. if your friends say you are using this other boy, then they arent really your friends. and if people that arent really friends with you, screw what they say!<br>  <br>  hope my advice helps!!|`|AA11043457	I wish I could ask more about the abuse.  If he abused you by hitting or by molesting you, you need to report it to your parents as that is a crime.  but then I'm surprised that you even say that you like him as how do you continue to like someone who has mistreated you?  You should stay away from him and not see him again.<br>  <br>  So your problem is over, you have one boy you like.  You are not using anyone.  <br>  <br>  First, what teenagers are supposed to do is to talk to a number of different people and get to know them so when  you get older you will know the kind of person  you want to marry.  Today kids are pairing up much too soon.  So they get too involved.  Some people don't date until they are 16 years old but only do group things before then.  One reason is that people pair them up and they can't develop friendships.  My granddaughters don't date until they are 16 and some are reluctant even though asked as they  don't want to be stuck getting to know only one guy.  They would like to date -- with different people, but no sex.  Making out or having sex means you talk less and don't get to know the person at all.  You can get sexually transmitted diseases and it can mess up your whole life.  <br>  <br>  So  the people who say you are using them are way off the mark.  Tell them you don't like the one boy anymore - that he wasn't nice to you.  But don't let them make you feel that  you have to get too involved with one boy either.<br>  <br>  Good luck toyou.|`|S852p6SXaa	yeah get rid of the one who's abusing you. but its not cool to date 2 people at the same time cause its not fair. think it about the other way around if some guy was doing that to you. you would not like that and probably be very hurt and pissed off.|`|7vt21U1naa	Stop hanging out with the abuser one and hang out with the nice one =] <br>  <br>  Don't worry about people. They have no life except talking crap about others!!<br>  <br>  Just do what makes you happy without even thinking about what peoples think. ;]|`|966laRlHaa	dont think about what others thinkin of you, thats first<br>  secondly, stop, if those two have feelings for you and you dont have for no one, than tell them(both, but separate, of course) that your feelin isnt that way as them. just be honest. say you like them as friends and you like to spend time with them, but you dont like them in romantic way.|`|FmvnC8keaa	Well who cares about what people say. If a guy is abusing you then the best thing is to try and get out of that relationship. Besides, liking more than one guy is just our nature as girls! I kind of like around ten haha :]]|`|mcDq2zq1aa	its natural to want to have a back up like whatever<br>  dont fuuuuuuuuuuuuucking talk to the guy who abused you?<br>  are you joking? chris brown rihanna. like no, DONE WITH HIM!<br>  hhaha stay with the one now and be done|`|5lFppGAVaa	If they both know about the other its all good.  But I say leave the one that abused you alone because he is not worth your time.|`|yOr4SOO4aa	You shouldn't go out with a guy who abused you!!!!|`|08ff27fe3110ddd7da36736daaf4c2dfaa	lose em both and start fresh. gud luck!|`|5lKBLQ6vaa	try to distance yourself from them <br>  btw dont worry about what people think its 09 the yr to do you with no reqrets|`|uxBnPqtYaa	he abused you!? **** him.<br>  stick with one and stop flip flopping.|`|qlpjDvoNaa	If you've broken up with both of them more than once then maybe you are. It's like if one upsets you then you run to the other because you don't want to be comforted and not alone. Now I dont' think you should go back to the abusive one ever because that isn't going to change but ex's are ex's for a reason and rarely does it work on the second try.|`|ZbcK1r2paa	There is no reason to go back to the first guy if he abused you because you may just get abused again and if he says he changed that is a big chance to take. Also tell the others to leave you alone because who you go out with and why is your business not anyone else's so disregard what ever they say|`|PkUPp4s0aa	NEVER let a guy hit you. EVER. leave that jerk! go with the other guy. and if you dont want to be with him then find someone else...but leave the other guy. no guy is ever worth taking a punch for.|`|jnktNA5Faa	make up your mind because if you don't, your not only hurting yourself but them too.|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	grow up|`|xBd96wvRaa	We'll you are. <br>  But that is ok, if one takes that approach everyone uses everyone. <br>  <br>  One hurts you and you go to the other to make yourself feel better. But hey why would anyone be with anyone if it didn't make them feel good? <br>  <br>  Your problem is that you are not discriminate enough. Stop giving them chances. Time to tap into a new partner pool.

Tell her that you love her too much to ever even have a thought like that cross your mind. Why would you ever want to do a thing like that. Tell her that you'd rather argue with her than to ever kiss anyone else. :( I really hope things get better between you and her!|`|6X7qTFvhaa	you need to confront your ex girlfriend and tell her in PERSON what really happened or didn't happen and tell her that that girl was lying|`|srAP6Vzvaa	i dont know how old you are. but you need to be a MAN and move on. you sound too emotional. be strong and fight to move forward with you life. go to the gym and work out your pain. it does alot of good.|`|7BZYUHpjaa	for surely dont give up on her and move on but it doesnt sound like your going to do that. when you see her and get a chance to talk to her quietly then just be like that never happened i would never kiss another girl. watch your tone though. sound sad and sweet. not mad or anythign like that.
zCE0slQ5aa	Will H is on task. Good Philosophy.<br>  Sometime, when the moment presents itself,...don't worry, you'll know when, look him in the eyes and say,..."If you ever want to ask me out, i'll say yes."-smile at him sweetly than look away. Pause for a moment. If he doesn't say anything, move the conversation in a different direction with grace, not urgency. Stay in control of your emotions and be confident. After that, it's up to him.|`|RXzj8vg2aa	You'll never know till you ask, most guys who like a girl hide there feeling from that girl the most(specially if there friends b/c hes afraid of messing it up) just tell him you like him.  and dont go to his friends, b/c if his friends dont like you, then the message might get changed or not make it to him.  then you have a bigger problem|`|Ek5ZjYmhaa	Try asking some of him friends or taking a risk and ask him out.

Wo5Ezmwiaa	Hmm, do you think that - in the long run - you would enjoy being with this other guy more than your current boyfriend? If so, then I think maybe you should do something about it. You could get that other guy alone and tell him "Look, I know we both are seeing someone, but it's just that I can't get you out of my head and I was wondering...if I broke up with my boyfriend...would you be interested in dating? I know you have a girlfriend, and I have my boyfriend, it's just that lately I've been thinking about maybe leaving him, and I was wondering if I did..would there be a possibility of something happening between us?"<br>  If your boyfriend is going to be going away, and this guy will be staying, it may be in your best interests to break it up with your current boyfriend before your emotions get too deep.
ynFtyVKYaa	I think that you should stay wit bf 1 lil bit more and find out get 2 da core why u guys have been aguring lately but if you keep feeling gulity tell him bout boy numba 2 bcuz if he heard bout it from some1 else he wuld start to think ur cheating...Maybe boy numba 2 wuld be a better fren u know one of those frens who ur close with but they have a crush on you..and if you and boy numba one ever broke up if boy2 likes/liked you that much ten he would be wating for you..But yes stay with boy1 for now but also think if your starting to question if you'll be better off with another boy then if wat u and boy1 really have true love or jus ur frist love were u guys will always have feelings 4 each other but you've moved on|`|LGLArmjRaa	Look the thing is you care about both of them, but number two is just a bit of fun and its not like secure.

The best thing to do is to talk to your boyfriend about the situation, and tell him that his house mother did not mean her talk in a way that she hated you and would get upset with him if you had sex with him. Tell him that he should talk to her again and clear up the fact that he thinks that she will get angry with him. Chances are after this happens, he will feel better about having sex again.|`|QLR4iSkEaa	You have to explain to him that in order to have a healthy relationship, both your needs must be satisfied and one of which is to have sex.

veLaEqL6aa	To be truly honest, leave the bad boy to grow up.  He obviously got into trouble early in life & has kind of given up.  Maybe your leaving him for good will help him snap out of it & think about what is really important in his life.   If he can see you succeeding and thriving, it may give him the kick in the pants he needs to get his head out of his @$$.  If a man (I used the word with a lot of trepidation from your description!) has a child he is not taking care of, even if just through child support, he is not really a man.  Just because something is hard does not mean you give up.   Personally, I worked 5 jobs at one time to support the woman I loved and the child she brought into the relationship.  I was not the father but I was the dad & that is much more important.  I had 2 full time jobs & worked 3 part time jobs in my time off from the full time ones.  I hated them all but I put up with it because a real man does not give up & does not let the ones he loves down.  Your bf is showing he is not a man, in this respect.  Let him go to jail, he chose this path, it is his to walk.  I have been in management and hired people with really bad track records.  The history means much less than the attitude you show in the interview.  We would even hire when we could only give 10 hours a week because someone showed real promise & we could find out just how hard of workers they could be this way.  I hired one man who had spent 14 years in jail over a murder.  Over the next 4 weeks he worked a total of 50 hours.  During that time, he ran the people who had been there for months or years into the ground.  This got him full time employment and 3 others out of work.  When I left the company, he took my place as assistant manager of a national food service chain resturant.  I stopped in 2 weeks ago & he was gone.  When I asked what happened to him, the manager said he had been promoted & is now in charge of a district of 34 stores.  This is a man who killed someone for $90 in a gas station robbery, spent nearly a decade & a half in prison, & realized he had screwed up the first part of his life.  He was determined not to screw up the second half.  P.S.  He is now making over $70,000 a year before bonuses.  He has said multiple times that going to prison is what fixed his head, he had time to think about what is important to him.      His parents disowned him when he went to jail.  Last year, he looked them up and they welcomed him back into the family because he had made up for his past errors.  Give the guy a chance, let him go to prison & get his head together.|`|PkUPp4s0aa	honestly? i think you should leave him. if he isnt going to pay child support for his first kid what would make you think he would do it for you? you can do way better. don't date a guy who's going to jail for the second time. he has issues and you don't have to be the one to "save" him. let him be someone else's worry.|`|6TuFqVBEaa	**** em hes  an ***
fPDCgKjbaa	I'd write her an email (although a posted letter may have more weight) to explain your feelings.<br>  <br>  Dear <insert name here><br>  <br>  So far it has been <insert amount of time> since we initiated our separation, and I am realising just how important you are to me, and how much I need you in my life. This letter/email is intended to show that I care about you more than I could have ever realised, and that whilst I respect that you wanted 3 months, I would love to meet up before then, if you would agree. I realise the importance of this break, for it has only increased my passion for you, however I believe that I am aware enough of this now to be able to treat you better than I did before. I love you more than I thought I could love anyone, and everything I have done that hurt you, even if unintentional, is now hurting me, and the guilt I feel is, although perhaps deserved, unbearable without you by my side.<br>  There are very little things left in the world that I wouldn't give to have you back, and for that reason if you have any questions or requirements of me my only wish is for you to ask them so I can repair our relationship and to be able to hold you in my arms again.<br>  I hope that you are well, and have benefited, like me, from this break. I hope to hear from you at the end of <insert amount of time until the 3  months is over>, although sooner would be preferable.<br>  I love you. Return to me?<br>  <br>  <Insert your name here><br>  <br>  Try not to mention anything about the argument UNLESS you have to explain yourself or apologise or answer any questions she may have about it. If you need to, then make sure its you that is taking the blame, not her, and be careful about your choice of words. I suggest that you write this letter/email one day, and then check it the next BEFORE you send it to make sure that you are happy with what you have written.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|Im4K2eFIaa	Talk to her about how you feel. Be honest. Maybe time apart is what is best for you, but I just don't understand why she wants THREE months specifically. Try meeting in the middle and go on a break simply until you both are ready to be together...then if the relationship is that good you will probably not need to wait so long. You can't make her be with you in the meantime if she does not want to be. Keep yourself busy while you can't be together.|`|TODzjTczaa	Approach her.  Be honest, and be simple.  Beg her forgiveness, and tell her that you apologize for the misunderstanding.  If she accepts, good. If not, let her go.|`|mC2dRyuMaa	wel the best thing i can tell u is talk to her tell her that it was a stupid argument and that u cant bare being away from her and that ur hurting i think itl work|`|Y16olPxlaa	Maybe you should tell her that.|`|40zMUQMGaa	Get over it; don't go crazy for someone who doesn't want you around.<br>  live your life man.|`|7BZYUHpjaa	she wants to break up for three months and then go back out with you? what i dont understand|`|08ff27fe3110ddd7da36736daaf4c2dfaa	awwwwwwwww so sweet! apologize and whisk her off her feet. the best of luck to u!!! we need more men like you.|`|966laRlHaa	I have two ideas..<br>  1. That she told you she want a pause instead of leaving you, she wants to leave you, sad, but truth.<br>  2. On the other side, maybe she want that you fight for her, maybe she wants to see how much you love her and want to see will you do something or not. In this case I suggest to not do something dum, best of all is talking and spend some *good qualified time* with her.|`|Ek5ZjYmhaa	Giver her a few days to calm down. When you think the time is right show up at her house unexpectdly and bring her roses and chocolates. Roses mean I'm sorry and chocolates mean "i love you" Even try to write her a song if you can.

I know it seems like what you don't need to do, but if there was ever really something between you two, she will come back to you. She will start to remember and miss you. Just make sure you can swallow whatever you did wrong and admit it so it makes it that much easier for her to come back to you.  <br>  <br>  Hang in there. Love is so tough because it can also be so great.<br>  <br>  I hope things turn out good for you.|`|aglLU9acaa	she obviously wants some space. you need to respect that wish and give her the space. if you dont, and you croud her and try to rush her into going back out with her, she could get mad and make the wait time longer. if you really love her, you will give her her space and let her cool down. she will get over the argument, but with some people it takes longer to heal or get over something. <br>  <br>  hope my advice helps :)|`|xBd96wvRaa	You need to accept the play is not yours to make. <br>  <br>  Either wait and see or move on as though you two are over for good. <br>  I would recommend moving on.|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	its called breaking up, sometimes it hurts bucko

Then this shouldn't even be an issue.  His penis might be small, but he probably loves you too.  Just put yourself in his situation, how would you feel if he DUMPED you because you have small boobs or you have excess labia skin on your vagina?  So many girls are just soooooooooooo shallow.  If you are really having trouble, talk to him and tell him your issue.  Then you can both go to a special doctor and talk about what can help you guys out.<br>  <br>  Oh yea, and there is a male enhancement, and it's called surgery, which will cost a lot of money.  There is actually extra penis deep inside so I think what the doctor does is make a small incision around the penis so the organ can extend, then they would sew it back together.  I don't know the name of the procedure, but you can look it up.|`|5HKhla0Paa	He can use penis enlargements products.<br>  <br>  I tried just about every penis enlargement product <br>  method, but nothing worked.

8FbOtXAXaa	I don't think that just by sending you that text meant that he wants you to be his girlfriend. Like you said, you asked him who his best friend is and he said you so that means that you are just his best friend. Now if he asks you to go out and see a movie or starts acting like more than friends with you, then I might think he likes you more than a friend. Just stay the way that you are because if he doesn't feel the same way, then it might be a really awkward situation. Just wait it out and you will know by his actions like if he is really affectionate towards you that he likes you back.

If he really needed release, he could masturbate.|`|RIjjgex0aa	Well you don't state your age or your BF age but as far as pain no.<br>  A man is not in pain because he's not getting any *****!!!! period.<br>  Discomfort, the only thing I can think of is when your making out or something his dick gets hard and yea that can be a little uncomfortable with it still in his pants, but he needs to grow up because every MAN knows how to deal with this. Please do not be dumb enough to fall for this anymore.
XH2o1MM6aa	.Most women would'nt be comfortable riding a motorcycle on a dinner outing.
XH2o1MM6aa	.Samantha "friends" who take pleasure in miscalling you are weird friends.If these guys say something of  personal or rude.Just smile and reply "You wish".If they are pissing you off,don't get angry as that'll on satisfy their egos.Just ignore them as they really are immature.
qRKOWgS0aa	Yes, I know. This sounds cliché, but REALLY; be yourself. If you aren't yourself when getting to know a guy, and you end up going out with him, is it really fair to you that he likes you for who you're not? If that's confusing, just think of how long you're going to have to keep up the act. <br>  Get a new look! It can be as dramatic or subtle as you want; dye your hair pink (this may not attract some groups of guys), or get side bangs or layers, but dont get so caught up on looks. If he's a good person, he'll barely notice. The possibilities are endless, and this is sure to get your guys' attention! <br>  Ask your friends for advice; there is a good chance that some of them have had boyfriends. If not, think about if you have the TIME to have one, and if you are ready. <br>  Don't rush it. Guys are just as shy as girls, and when you reach up to kiss him on the first date, he might be happy, but he also might be a bit nervous and scared. Work your way up the ladder: Hugging', 'Holding hands', First kiss, 'Cuddling', French kissing and making out... you finish the rest. Just make sure that when you reach the end of the ladder, you go back to the basics every once in a while. It gets a bit tiring at the top, over and over again. <br>  Have fun! Relationships aren't supposed to be about stress and being 'tied down'. If you feel this way, consider taking a break from boys!|`|lW3ZddDFaa	till him... it is nice to talk to you so what are you doing this evening and get him with this subject!!!! after 3 to 4 seem alike conversation till him that you like him and wondering if we can take this relationship out of the school......hope that help!!!|`|BxYWNm31aa	hang out with him more i guess, <br>  worked for me, a girl started to hang out with me more and i started liking her because her personality and her looks as well and we had a lot in common|`|PFm1dI55aa	If you don't tell him, you shouldn't expect him to somehow figure it out.|`|TQOSW78Vaa	just tell him.

It is most definitely not your fault. If you're displaying respect and care for girls there is no reason for her NOT to like you! The right girl just hasn't come along yet. I hope she will soon for you though! I know this sounds stupid, but EVERY day since like 8th grade, I've been wanting a guy to just even SAY they liked me. But to this day (2 years later) no one has! And while it is depressing, I'm just going to wait for the right person. I think 2-day relationships were they just wanted to say they were going out w/ someone are SO STUPID! You have to truly care for the person and have actual chemistry. Idk....but best of luck! don't give up hope and give in to someone you don't even like! It's ok!! Pray!

You have no idea what might be running through that girl's mind and it just might be that she is attracted to you and that you are the one that makes her the happiest.|`|Uv7onQaQaa	I think whats not okay.. is your view of yourself. don;t ever think someone is better than you. everyone is different... we all have good points and bad. i think in high school and when were young we base a lot of partner selection soly on looks.. but as you get older, and in your 20's looks start to play only a small role. smart girls look for more than just looks in a guy. we fall for a guys intellect, and ambition, whether or not he can make us laugh, and feel good about ourselves. we all want to be with someone who makes us feel good. those are the ppl we fall for. dont underestimate yourself because you dont think your good looking enough for this girl... if she doesnt like you for wtv reason you have to move on.. but looks rly only go so far.. and they fade.. looks are often what initially attract us to someone, but its personality and compatibility which keep ppl together and what are the basis of an actual relationship. girls are rly NOT attracted to guys who are not confident.. and often fall for a guy who may be a 6 on 10 look wise, but have great confidence and know they're "a catch", way b4 we fall for a guy who may be a 9 on 10 in the looks department, with no confidence.. confidence is VERY sexy.. and if you believe your the $hit, so will she... the right girl will see you for the great person you are... but you rly have to  love yourself b4 your able to love someone else, and be loved =)|`|FeRC5jkoaa	nope. its not okay. sorry.|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	You need therapy, seriously, I'm not trying to be mean.|`|MTkXXOsjaa	It's just as okay for an ugly girl to love a beautiful man.

You should not let him know about reading his mail, but I would talk to him about staying in touch with his ex. Tell him that you can tell she's still interested in him, and so it makes you uncomfortable for him to still be talking to her on messenger. Assure him that you trust him, and that it's not a matter of trust, it's just the fact that he's talking to an ex who has feelings for him and who would like to have him back, and that it's not healthy for either of them and the situation makes you, as his current girlfriend, uncomfortable.|`|qxgkhN8aaa	Hi, should I address you as '' love '' as in your symbol ?<br>  I'll say.<br>  Let it be, if your b/f cannot be contented with you, just let it be.<br>  I know you had the right for not only to call her, but other issues as well.<br>  But ultimately, a girl, I believe only want the best to herself,<br>  i.e. to want the guy to love you the MOST, and I mean MOST.<br>  So, if he start to get back to his ex and communicating and so on,<br>  why bother ?

7NkYCUKdaa	Im the same way.<br>  I refuse to date in high school, it just seems like a waste of time.<br>  It's really odd for a 17 year old girl to say that.. but it's true.<br>  <br>  Im not gay or anything, I love to be around guys and stuff... but still im not into short relationships and stupid drama.<br>  <br>  It's not weird at all to me at least.|`|Qi72Npkkaa	ur just not ready for realationship|`|8FbOtXAXaa	you feel like this because you are still young yet.

gzWwwsg0aa	You will be happy to know that there are girls like that out there.  I know of several that believe the same morals and things like that.  I mean I dont believe that you should have to wait until marriage to have sex but i believe that you should do it with someone you love rather than just doin it for fun.. I believe you should wait for true love...|`|3z3P6j49aa	Yes there are good girls left. No, don't become a perverted jerk!<br>  Girls just settle for those because they think they cant find any better.<br>  Trust me, I've dated all the jerks, most cheated on me, or dumped me because i wouldn't have sex with them. When i found a good guy I didn't believe it was real... and that can mess things up easily. <br>  <br>  So just wait for the right girl. I promise theres a good girl looking for a good guy like you.|`|YHcyuka3aa	No you do not become like the rest because they are wrong. I agree 100% with your post. I am also very disappointed in the way the younger female generation are allowing themselves to dress and act the way they do. School is not forever and if you have to not date while in (high) school then that is what you do. I know a lot of people who have never dated in school and they are fine now because they didn't follow a crowd of perverted kids with bad ideals. Once you are out of school and go into the work force, you will meet someone that have the same views as you. Its ok to be particular and I hope you stay that way. Don't feel like you are the one out of place, they are the ones who have misplaced their morals. Your right by keeping yours, you won't be sorry later on in life. Good luck to you and know your doing the right thing by not following the wrong crowd.|`|7Hs8TE5haa	it seems to me that you just don't know very nice girls, but they are out there. defiantly done act more like your friends cause im sure one day they'll regret the stuff they did after they get some girl pregnant or lose a friend drunk driving. Don't give up just yet, im sure you'll find the right girl.|`|Avbh2QEeaa	most girls want a guy like u.....but they are really hard to find.  Don't worry, there are lots of girls out there, i'm sure u'll find what u are looking for.  Not EVERY girl is the same.  You'll soon realize that.  Good luck!!|`|CCyB12Tbaa	You sound like a good guy and I'm sure any girl would be happy with you! You could try online dating to find someone who you would be happy with! Good luck :)|`|ar06i7cIaa	Dude its nice to know that guys like you exist (YAY!!!)<br>  Umm dude people are always going to do whatever they think satisfies them. Like literally if you dont like that lifestyle than dont hang out with them, like you will be like you are now, trying to consider changing who you are, to please someone else.<br>  Umm I am a decent girl, in fact, I care for other people more than I care for myself because that is the way I am. Dude if I knew you, I would consider going out with you. You cant like see one chick and judge the rest, just like that, its just not fair.<br>  Dont become like the rest because that is what girls like me are tired of seing. And you will become just like the rest dude. Like literally just stay true to who you are. Its okay to be different the right person will come a long, believe it or not. <br>  The girls that are into that stuff are headed in a different direction in life than you are and they are obviously not your type.<br>  Dude dont get discouraged, Stay true to your soul.<br>  Hope I helped!!!<br>  If there is anything else I could do to help, just email me, I would love to help more, if I can!!!|`|GJlEpxqeaa	There are good girls left. You have to look where the bad girls are. That's where I hide and I'm one of the good girls. Honestly, be who you are because that's who you are. Don't change and be JERKS like the rest of them. There are still girls like me who want the nice guys. Be happy! We're are still here!|`|aa9jQ9XFaa	Not all American girls are like that, i'm not at all.  I think people like that are just desperate for attention.  There are tons of good people left, dont change just because everyone else is|`|AA10208246	No, don't feed into the peer pressure. Be yourself and you will do good.|`|0NlFBcFpaa	NEVER turn into a perverted jerk!!! Trust me, there are many of us girls left out here that appreciate everything you are doing to maintain your purity, sense of responsibility, and overall respect for others.<br>  <br>  i don't do any of the things you've mentioned either. i find them trivial and, frankly, immature. high schoolers are just going to realize in a couple years all the stupid things they did in the past and regret them. feel lucky that you won't have to go through that!!<br>  <br>  and i've come to terms with not finding someone yet. you're only 18!! give it some time!! you're going to college and you'll meet all sorts of different people who offer different things. you're meant to find your one person out there. wait and stick to your morals. don't change for others approval or recognition. :)|`|2QS8j9aOaa	You have a tall heart inside of you and I would suggest that you go where the good girls go to Church and that is where you will find those good girls and morally good. Don't give into peer pressure of doing immoral things for the sake of blending in with the rest. Go against the current, and be separated from evil. Find new friends and if there are only negative it is best to be alone. God see's your pure heart and intentions and will send you your hearts desire if you only ask him. All things are possible thru God.|`|6TpkjSOuaa	no not all the girls are like that. I am a hispanic 16 year old sophomore and i don't do that. I really care about my grades i am a honors student. I spend my time reading and doing homework because i want to be someone in life and with the help of God i know i am gonna get there. i am top 7 in class rank. I believe in losing my virginity with the right guy that i will spend the rest of my life with but i got so disappointed and got use to the idea that i am gonna be single forever because i saw that most guys are jerks that only want sex, but now i see that not all of them are like that. because you basically think like me. you are the male version of me. I don't drink because that could make me an alcoholic and i might even get raped. I am really glad that there are guys that think like you do. Never change i hope someday you find that special person that will make you happy. And please please do not conform to society. Look now a days we have ppl infected with aids and all sorts of stds because of their wild lives. and im sure you don't want to end up like the rest of them.<br>  <br>  hey watch this video  it pretty much describes the situation you and me are going through. Listen to the lyrics and watch the whole song. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVP0b8qvZg8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVP0b8qvZ...</a>|`|ekTtIliKaa	No, you should just stay being you. It's true that the girls of your and my generation have mostly gone pretty bad... and though nothing like the girls you described, I'm not perfect myself lol ><<br>  <br>  point being, stay the way you are, really, because when you do find someone, it will be so much better. If you just become like all the rest then all of your relationships will be like that too, quick and fleeting and most unsatisfying. <br>  If you stay the way you are, then when you find someone, it will probably last for a long time if not forever. It's really hard to find guys like you these days, and trust me, some girls are looking.<br>  <br>  ps. not that there's anything wrong with religion or going to church (because there's not), you don't need to become all super religious to get a good, clean, nice girl... (made me think of this because of one of the other answers <<)|`|HYUOJJpRaa	I promise to God, I will not drink, smoke or have sex until I'm married. The only reason they do that is to get attention. If they were happy with themselves they wouldn't feel the need to do all that.|`|rk8MBfbLaa	There are good girls out there you have to wait and let time take its course. And no! girls dont like perverted guys.|`|8P64hgL3aa	As you said, not everyone's like that. there are lots of really good down to earth girls that think the way you do. unfortunately most girls are lead to wrong things because of peer pressure, but I'm sure as you get into your 20s you'll find more people like you in places like colleges and universities, even if you go to a church, there must be really nice girls in there too.<br>  I'd say when you meet someone if she's almost like you, you'll have to give in even if she does some things you don't like. For example, I think exactly the same way as you do. I met this really good girl and she thinks a lot like I do but she's also a bi and not a lot into guys. So I'm willing to try it with her because there aren't many girls like that.|`|Ggtccfhhaa	aight bro check this...i at one point looked at life you do....i was pretty much at the point where i thought that the only way i was gonna get a girl is to become like the rest of the male population and become a jerk...but hey im only 18 and a freshman in college and i have found a girl that is a 'good' girl and she is so amazing and not like most of the girls in my higschool...yeah and in college you will see a lot more of these kinds of girl..the ones that sleep with tons of guys and stuff like that...the point of this is that you just have to look at these girls and say if i want a girl like that i have to be a jerk..but you dont want a girl that has had sex with 15 since jan 12..and there is a girl like that in my hall...so the point of this is dont be a jerk and give in you will find a good girl|`|QzQ0gU7kaa	ugh. where have you been all of my life?<br>  <br>  kidding, but really. i feel the same way, but opposite, obviously... as a 18 year old high school senior girl. <br>  <br>  Stay the way you are, eventually someone will respect that. That's what I have to keep telling myself as well, that I don't have to whore myself out to get guys to like me, although I can't say it's worked so far. Same with the drinking/partying.. i just don't think it's right, but it seems that's the only thing that will get you a boyfriend/girlfriend. <br>  <br>  why aren't there guys like you at my school?!?!<br>  <br>  Stay true to yourself :]|`|hYldhzQDaa	WoW i really and truley understand ur position as a girl im so not like the other girls u see im not sayin im ugly cuz i aint im just not a **** lol <br>  my friends keep tellin me 2 do the same things but i was raised different :D<br>  so yeah DONT CHANGE there r girls out there lookin 4 guys like u soo just look a little harder and its people like u who dont end up dead over drugs or emotional suicide lol|`|vjfdhhSDaa	First off , I tip my hat to you. You are obviously very respectful young man the kind id like my daughter to someday marry . Yes there are a-lot of good girls left in the world. Your friends are gonna do what there gonna do you cant stop their behavior , you can only try to influence it . But don't give yourself allot of undue stress worrying about it . The right girl will come along soon enough just wait patiently. Many girls want to be treated that way true ; but the girl that waits is special that's the one you want to set your sights on.

tK7XacH7aa	well, it's not good to post pictures of yourself online, but what you could do is post a picture of her on photobucket, then ask a question here saying if this girl is pretty (make sure you say "pic inside" or something like that and wait for people to answer. Lots of people will look if they know there's a pic inside. Make sure you put a link to that photo. She doesn't see it because she probably sees other girls that are pretty and have guys say to them that they are pretty, and she probably hasn't had that many. <br>  Technically people don't have the whole package, I guess because every one has negative qualities. If you focus on the good things, you could blind yourself of the negatives. And vice-versa|`|KQCaAQ00aa	she's only thirteen . give her some years, maybe she'll grow to love herself

And we share a lot with them, some times they are our best friends, but there should be a line, especially if that person is the opposite sex, or some one you could be in a relationship with if there was not your significant other.  Here is why:  you are talking about your relationship, the things that are wrong and soon one you, or both start to think:  Oh he/she understands me more then my husband/wife and you think the grass may be greener on the other side of the fence.  Well that person does not really know you not as Intimate as your spouse, you owe it to your spouse to talk things out with them.  I am not saying don't sound off, I am just saying be selective about what you talk about.  As for your co workers flirting, try drawing that line now you may be able to get the point across, just by drawing back a little, if that does not work you may have it be blunt, and tell him he is a good friend, but that is all it will ever be.  Good luck (I have been there )

Good luck. :)|`|gKak1Rx7aa	just be her friend and don't bother her about this stuff and when she is ready to date she will come to you|`|5VHWy0Ggaa	here's what i suggest... stay true to who you are. my boyfriend is a sweet and loving guy, he's not cocky. if you change the person you are for someone, it will not work out. no matter what, it just won't work out in the end because you are pretending to be someone you are not. as i said do not change who you are... trust me if things do not work out with this girl, it's for a reason! you never know who people are at a first glance, get to know her, and take it slow. i know this is not really what you want to hear, but it would be the smart thing to do... if she "flips your switch," and you two ended up jumping into bed together it would almost be meaningless. basically like a one night stand. if you really want to be with her, and want things to last, you will take my advice! or something along the lines.<br>  <br>  if she cannot accept you for you, then she's not worth it. if she cannot appreciate you for the sweet guy that you are, you WILL find someone better!|`|Dl9a08Rxaa	just go up to her and kiss her like crazy and see what happens|`|gKhR0sgLaa	It is true, being too nice is not a good thing with girls. Any girl can deny it, saying they would love a nice guy, but they know it's not true.<br>  <br>  Try treating her like a normal person, not like the girl of your dreams. Try being more comfortable with who you are, because you seem really insecure. <br>  <br>  The trick is not to be just cocky, but funny and cocky. The easiest part would be working on being more funny. Bust the girls balls, but have fun while doing it, that's what I do. Don't be serious, and show her you aren't serious, but mess with her a lot. Also, don't apologize when you bust her balls, it will show that you will kiss up to her because you are afraid to lose her.<br>  <br>  I know it sounds so weird, and not make any sense, but it does work, trust me.
8YfYh3y0aa	Cheat?  You're not married or engaged are you?  Anyway, its better to deal with guys one at a time, so make up your mind.
zDQIKDNoaa	Was this in person? If so, i would probably ask him out on the phone or in person. Say to him...<br>  <br>  "Hey Ken, whats up?"<br>  <br>  "Hey Barbie. Nothing, Just Hanging out."<br>  <br>  "Yep, me too! Oh, and I wanted to ask you something.."<br>  <br>  "What's that Barbie?"<br>  <br>  "Would you like to maybe sometime go to Culvers with me? We could catch a movie after that, "He's just not that into you" looks pretty good."<br>  <br>  And he will hopefully say "sure, I'd love to!"<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  you can just go middle school on him.<br>  <br>  AIM:<br>  Heyyyyy Matt.<br>  <br>  Hey.<br>  <br>  Who do you like?<br>  <br>  Idk, why / Idk, who do you like?<br>  <br>  Well, I like you, and i was wondering if you wanted to go out with me?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11353473	If he asked you that, you should've told him YES.<br>  He was trying to ask you out when that happened.<br>  I think that in this case:<br>  He was trying to ask if you like him because he likes you and wants to know if you do, but instead you said no, he got a bit disappointed, and when you asked him if he likes you, he said that maybe he doesn't, maybe he does.<br>  SO - you should definitely ask him out!<br>  Just find a time, like when it's all quiet and you two are sitting close to each other, tap on his shoulder, and start talking.

8YfYh3y0aa	In the 6th grade, he has absolutely no idea either.   Best for you to just work on being his friend for now.
zewYoUM4aa	I think you should talk to her. Tell her how you feel. It's very, very possible that she still has feelings (and very likely that this be true), but it's more of an after stage with girls. Once she knows that you're really into her (and it sounds like she's into you) then it'll be easier to move on and not think about her ex. Giver her time and don't be too pushy. It might take some time, so don't rush it.|`|g3OjS4zdaa	Just give her the Shocker!

Cpp1LddVaa	IMHE, whether or not a female partner has girlfriends is a non-factor in whether I would want to be with  her or whether we  could succeed as a couple.<br>  <br>  Women in my life, including my wife of almost 14 years, have a way of outgrowing girlfriends.  These days, females don't seem to claw each other's eyes out as much as when I was growing up, maybe because they have more options.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't listen to word one from "the girls" about what men "really like" or "really want."  Neither they, nor the magazines they read ever get it right.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes.|`|AA10421008	A guy wouldn't care very much. Guys will want most of your attention anyway.

decWPAHkaa	Come on now think positive and have a little more faith in your man. It doesn't sound like he's in it for the sex at all. He's already expressed his love for you, how he loves to spend time with you and how much he wants you. Having sex with you is a bonus and a great way to relieve stress.<br>  <br>  BTW, There is nothing wrong with a man to want to record themselves having sex. It doesn't mean that's the only reason why he's in a relationship with you. I'm sure you two do a lot more activities other than sex, so anyway  If you're not comfortable recording yourself having sex or if you're not in control of what happens to that tape then please DON'T DO IT. Only trust yourself when come down to situations like that. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Edit.. Question, how do you know he was ignoring your calls? Give him the benefit of the doubt. He was probaly sleep. You said yourself that he was stressd,  busy and didn't get any sleep. he probably doesn't even realize he was being rude to you.|`|d3icrU62aa	ehh it sounds fishy to me. keep in mind that I don't know your boyfriend and how he is but I get this weird feeling that maybe he wants to tape ya'll having sex and then put it out there or he might just have a hidden camera....bottom line is: if you are second guessing having sex, it's prolly not a good idea to go forward with it.<br>  He could be busy but it doesn't take a lot to show a lil affection or even say that you love the other person.|`|rk8MBfbLaa	i think he wants payback for what ever you did to him.|`|1IkC0hpkaa	Your boyfriend is definitely experimenting something you dont know - sex!  He's probably busy surfing porn or being with other company keen to do what he wants to do.  He doesnt love you k.  Moreover there are so many tell tale signs - seeing you alone?  Wake up girl and move on to someone more focused.|`|dpwMHg8maa	it sounds like he's in it for the sex girl.  My boyfriend works pretty much all the time, and because he gets so stressed, he WANTS to see me because i relax him.<br>  <br>  My first thoughts are to not trust this guy...he prolly just wants to get into your pants, film it, then sell it or put it on the internet.<br>  <br>  As for him not wanting to be with you and ignoring your calls, thats a sign right there.  You deserve a guy that tells you he loves you and wants to be with you. Not just for sex, but because your fun to be around.  Maybe if he showed he loved you more openly, you wouldnt have done what you did in the beginning.<br>  <br>  I dont know thats my idea anyways. I hope it helps, and good luck
knFDrJ4Taa	Well, I would try to just go with the flow. Never try to force conversation or emotions; just relax. If you seriously need something to say at all, though, talking to him about something funny that happened to the two of you ususally can work. Although I don't typically recommend having rather important conversations through any means other than in person, in this case I might message him and bring it up. That way, when each of you reply, you have enough time to think through what you want to say next before you send the message. It won't have the same edge or pressure as a one-on-one, real confrontation, y'know? For a first break-the-ice conversation, I would definitely try that. If all goes well, you'll have something else to talk about later.<br>  <br>  Hope all goes well! :)|`|1IkC0hpkaa	Yr xbf is confused.  How can he hv feelings but didnt want a relationship?  Thats hard to fathom!  Guess u pple sms or msg too much, its difficult to speak in person.  Stop smsing and talk face to face.|`|9nOQlbwEaa	Try to find up from his friends what is the problems that cos him to stop having a relationship with you, and also try to find up what is his interest or hobby, when next time you want to talk to him, just start with his interest or hobby and from there then only start to talk about other things.

1eR2DadOaa	mmm well i actually find my gf a bit boring at times, and i wish that she'd talk a bit more, but it doesn't matter because if you're really supposed to be together he won't care if you're boring or quiet. I don't know how old you are, but for a lot of guys i know around 13-16, craziness is a turn on. If you run out of things to talk about, just say something random and see what happens. About telling you to live a bit more, that's probably a good thing, or definitely not a bad thing, because it means he cares in the slightest about you.<br>  <br>  Oh well you can never really trust me, I don't know your situation.|`|KwWwB22Zaa	thats called being shy, can be fixed by being yourself, and maybe if you spend enough time around him it will just wear off.|`|z6CBWSnFaa	i act like you when i am around girls. no gf yet. i am only 14|`|7nhvBUc1aa	oh, hahah.<br>  just pretend he's one o yo buddiess :D

Make a list of things you have been wanting to do (add new songs on your iPod, study, etc) and soon enough you won't have her on your mind as much. Also, realize you can't make a person like you. Don't try to make yourself like another person, because it's not truly fair for them. Hope this helps!

Your gonna have to get over it or else its never gonna work
Wo5Ezmwiaa	Wow, you must really really care about her for you to be so sensitive to the fact that some other people saw her naked. Look, I'm sure she didn't stand there posed while a bunch of guys got to walk up and study her body. She and her friends probably ran around for a bit, and the guys never really got a good look at her body specifically. Just try to not think about it. The point is that she is with YOU now, and she did nothing with those guys. Those guys have seen tons of other girls naked, either in real life or just in movies alone, and I'm sure they couldn't picture her naked anymore. It's in the past, and that's where it should stay. Sorry I can't give you more advice than that. It probably isn't normal to care THAT much about it, but personally I think it's very sweet that you do in fact care, just try to not obsess over it.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	this is something i would not have told him, because men's ego's are fragile. u did this to yourself, there are just some things that u have to keep to yourself because when there's any kind of argument they will throw it up to u.|`|OYYYNCyCaa	Please only answer if you are serious<br>  <br>  this question is not serious|`|Kh5o3QCcaa	Tell him that if he had a real issue with you dating other men while you two were just dating, then he should have been honest with himself and not married you.  <br>  <br>  If you are faithful in your marriage, and have been since you two became serious he needs to man up and learn to move past it.  He is the one who said he accepted it- and his actions show otherwise.  He shouldn't have lied for such a large commitment, or at least put off the marriage until he either learned to move past it or realized that he couldn't and call off the wedding.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't have to get him to trust you.  He needs to find it in himself, and you have done all that you can to show him he can trust you.  So to me the ball is in his court.  He needs to stop bringing it up in such a manner.  If he needs to discuss it to help him move on, but it's counter productive and down right rude to rub something like this in your face.... especially when it happened prior to any commitments.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but I would hate to see how supportive he would be in any given situation..... and heaven forbid he have a history and ever make a mistake.  <br>  <br>  Me's thinks his horse is too high for him to fall gracefully from.<br>  <br>  (PS  I think anybody who has lied about or hidden their past from their spouse is scum of the earth (it's called enrtapment.  Your spouse doesn't even know who they married, and you have to ask yourself would they have married you had you not lied?  Then they truly don't love you. Not the 'you' you have presented to them, but the 'you' you truly are.  Your marriage is a lie), so I sincerely commend you on being honest.  I think honesty is key, and his immaturity in handling this matter is unfortunate.)|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	If you want my opinion on this, you shouldn't have told him. Yes, its great to be open about these things, but honestly...no matter how open minded he is, the fact that you cheated on him 6 times is ridiculous and I am sure he is extremely hurt. <br>  Since it was so early in the relationship, you really shouldn't have told him. Because now inside he is probably thinking that you have cheated after too and many many things. He is hurt. Really hurt. <br>  I think you should have a talk with him. And really let him know how much he means to you and everything you feel for him. Say sorry and make sure he understands how you feel about him. <br>  <br>  All the best.|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	Don't listen to Redhead, she's  a slut too. Read some of her other answers...that'll tell ya. Yeah, you're  pig, but because you're  a woman, you'll get away with it and his money too...your women friend can probably even convince you that you were the victim.|`|KEAfTavqaa	Wow. Once a cheater always a cheater. I cant believe he didn't divorce you by now.|`|AA11391968	The price you will pay (if he stays in the marriage) will be time.  You will need to be extra considerate in offering info on things you are doing or places you are going.  He needs time to see that cheating is not, and has not occurred (again) until he's comfortable.  But if he can never (and never happens for different people at different times) fully trust you, he will come to a conclusion and leave.|`|H7hHCHRkaa	You never cheated on your husband you went with other guys early on in the relationship that you had with your boyfriend he wasn't your husband then and it was before you guy's were serious. He needs to get over it and if he doesn't there is nothing you can do to reassure him unfortunately. Good Luck|`|NS5fnxpNaa	In my opinion you didn't cheat on him. It was before there was any commitments such as not going out with other people no ring on the finger, he has to get over this or its going to hurt your marriage. Will he go and talk to a councilor or maybe your pastor or priest. Just how many ladies did he have before the wedding bells? If you think none think again. He is just trying to hurt you when he is mad and he is. Good luck I think he needs help.|`|OOL4XdjPaa	I would explain to him that it was before you were sure of how you felt (like loving him) and that you would never break your wedding vows because they are very important to you blah blah and if he can't accept that you love him and are sorry then there's nothing you can do. you can't go back in time and change it. all you can do is stay fiathful now.. which you are.. now that you're married.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|Q5KFND17aa	it is only natural that he is reacting like this. honestly, if i were him i would've left you right there because you didn't really even give the relationship a chance to succeed. you cheated. you should be grateful he's even with you.<br>  <br>  cheater cheater pumpkin eater!|`|8ebb09b16f5ff1a5448d5eab3b4b1fa4aa	I just answered this same question:<br>  I'm going to reserve judgment, but I am concerned that at 18 you've been with so many men, and are married. You're a child. My gut tells me that he doesn't trust you for the obvious reasons but he still married you. So it may be he wasn't completely honest with you because you took him off the hook by telling him your secrets. I don't believe in telling partners about cheats unless you get caught. It doesn't make them feel better - it just opens up new horrible wounds. <br>  <br>  The military offers counseling, go. Go now, don't wait.and keep your draws away from other men.|`|UrNMuhFKaa	First off stop feeling sorry for yourself - early on? Please it was with 5 different guy.<br>  Here is how you fix it. My guess is you only want the easy quick fix  because that matches your past behavior.<br>  Okay read on if you really care. My guess you have stopped reading about now. <br>  Take responsibility for your past choices and accept the consequences of your poor choices. To repair you must stop being defensive and be 100% trustworthy, you must be willing to give detailed accounts of your comings and goings. You must be willing to be accountable to him by being totally transparent. You can not lie to him about money, where you have been, about who you talk to. Do your best to avoid him finding out things about where you have been or who you have been with from someone else. Sup rises will erode trust.<br>  Lastly be willing to do this for as long as it takes. After all it is what you owe him.<br>  Good luck you dug this hole now it is up to you to fill it in.<br>  Lastly stop minimizing what you have done. This business about how it was before this or before that is a big pile of crap.<br>  You showed low character and trust will come from showing high character.<br>  Sorry for being so blunt and hard on you but you seems you are in a great deal of denial and have a significant sense of entitlement.|`|V6BWAWoyaa	First of all, you didn't cheat on your husband, you cheated on your fiance or boyfriend at the time.  It is going to take a very long time for him to trust you again.  You cheated on him and he decided to marry you anyway.  Deep down inside he has to trust you some what or he wouldn't have married you.  He has some rights to bring it up any time he wants.  You were unfaithful to him.  Married or not you were still with him at the time.  6 times is an aweful lot.  I wouldn't have married you if you cheated on me six times.  But I am not him and you have a very lucky man.  Just be patient with him and let him do what he has to do to trust you again.  You will be fine.|`|Id4aSqrPaa	if he said he forgives you then he shouldn't bring it up as leverage in a fight. its unfair. <br>  <br>  you need to communicate. dont fight. discuss what you need, what he wants, and how you both feel about this whole situation. be honest and you should remind him that your being honest and want to work it out. besides the more someone doesn't trust another the more they begin to realize there is nothing they can do so they end up falling into bad habits.|`|IA5uBGFkaa	I think the biggest mistake people can make at times is tell all. If all this was before the I love yous ect.... then it should have been kept away from him. Cause this is what happens they think about the before stuff and throw it in your face. Unless he can mature enough to let it go since he did forgive you it was before you were serious it sounds then I am sorry you kinda opened up a torture chamber for your self. Maybe you could remind him he said he forgave you so what is with the mud slinging.|`|frtBRjDdaa	no you did not cheated on him but you did not did well before marriage too. every time he brings up the subject you should just stay calm and he is calm also you jut ask him forgiveness even if you not to be blame and tell him that you have changed now.<br>  And as a wife you should understand him more than he should to u|`|26A3XZD7aa	Ok heres the thing when people usually forgive they dont forget but damn this guy cant let it go & i can bet you he never will without trust you kinda have nothing & usually when guys dont trust you they get panicy & violant & the marriage will become hell after awhile so my advice 2 u is move on cause theres nothing you can do here but i see where hes coming from i mean 5 guys damn dude|`|a8f5edcc140b36ea895725f1c1fa0ff7aa	hey you brought this on yourself....sounds like you need to do a lot of a@@ kissing. excuse my language but i dont know if i couldve even married someone knowing that they would just give it up to anyone. and dont get mad at us because you f'd your life up!! its up to you to find a way to fix it!! its not going to be easy though|`|B5WbBKDOaa	once a slut awalys a slut|`|ZtfN4J6taa	I would have kicked your sorry, lying, cheating ho BUTT out on the street a long time ago !|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	some things are much better left unsaid.<br>  <br>  but it's too  late now.<br>  <br>  he doesn't trust you, i'm sure.  have you considered marriage counseling?|`|AMkMHOAyaa	READ YOUR BIBLE AND LET GOD HELP YOU HE IS THE ONLY 1 TRY PROVERBS|`|7aoHmM4baa	just tell him to promess to never talk about it again and move on|`|aeLyiRczaa	Well, I would be smart enough to see and admit that so much of what you are getting, you willingly brought about.  You cheated.  You knew you were cheating.  If you did not realize what this could and may cause in a relationship, then you are too silly and immature to think of marriage, let alone be married.<br>  <br>  Help you?  Look, the best advice I can give you is to think before you do things and to be realistic about life and people.  And by no means do you use this situation as one to help you justify not being fully honest in the future either.<br>  <br>  As to the cheating was very early in the relationship.  And?  Look, your are still trying to give yourself credit or trying to act as if it should all be okay now.  If I run over person with a car, ten years from now, some will say there goes the guy who ran over a person with a car.  How long it takes others to let it go is their choice, not yours.<br>  <br>  Do not be fooled.  You do not always get a do over and you do not get to decide how seriously another person sees or take things.  You also do not get to decide how upset they are or for how long.  You like many seem to be saying that you should be able to do what you want and then be able to determine the above things for others too.  Just more of the female attitude that they should be treated like royalty and get to make the rules, at least in my opinion.  Do not gamble more then you are willing to lose would be a good thought for you.|`|kV9GlWDFaa	you should not have gotten married. obviously you were confused if you were sleeping with all these men and you knew what you were doing too. that is a bad kind of pain right there missy and your messing with his emotions, ego etc. i understand **** happens but not 6 different times. trusting you would be his first mistake i believe even if he trusted you you would still act out. i believe there is something more underneath it all. let this guy go. he deserves to have a faithful wife somebody death do him part you've proven yourself untrustworthy time and time again i'm sorry but you knew better. marriage is a serious commitment one that should not be taken lightly if you want to have a successful marriage you should have waited. if you do decide to stay then okay but HE WILL CONTINUE to bring this up and you cannot change the past however you can change your future. you do not deserve to be belittled by him. if you haven't acted out recently and feel you can do this right i suggest you do it elsewhere this **** will never work out seriously!!!|`|q4JaBnQuaa	OK... by telling him he lost trust in you. just like you still remember from years ago now he will too and you need to give him a lot of time before he can trust you. it's not something that can be forgotten...and i mean I HOPE you would never do it agian but you need to give him time space. Now more than ever you need to remind him that you love him and that he is the one for you( only if you mean it) also don't push things to quickly. Agian if you can't forget it how do you expect him too. expecially since your the one that did it to him not the other way around so just..give him time give him explainations where when who why if your not doing anything there is nothing to be afriad of and yeah don't try to push him to forget it to quickly casue now he knows and that will sadly eat away at him for the rest of his life...but he can and will learn to trust you once agian if he truly loves you just give him plenty of time...|`|rTaaIXSuaa	Regardless if he was not your husband at the time of the infidelity, cheating is cheating. Call it for what it is. <br>  My opinion about you is that you are going to cheat again. How can anyone cheat on someone SIX times with FIVE different men (eww) and be sincere in their apology? I can understand cheating once and realizing it was a horrible mistake, but SIX?<br>  Sorry, you brought this on yourself. A real woman doesn't pull this crap on her man. You want him to trust you after cheating six times. lol<br>  If you can't stay with one man, have respect for his feelings and end the marriage. You don't deserve him.

You know, girls don't usually go up to guys and say, "Hey, I'm new, would you be my friend", right?  So you have to approach her.  You simply ask her if she hangs out with anyone, and if she says no, not really, then you can ask her if she wants to hang out with you, like at lunch, or maybe at break.  She's probably secretly wishing someone would ask her to hang out, I mean that's what it's all about, right?  So go for it.  I'm rooting for you!|`|08MBrOuSaa	Well, the normal 'Hello, what's up' route normally works. <br>  <br>  Or you could always go for that more quirky route like; "I like blue toothbrushes, what's your favorite color?"

94gC814Eaa	so a slow pace is good to start at and you can always speed up if they want to speed up but if you start fast it will be hard to know they want to slow down. I find starting slow gives you time to really get into it, but maybe that's just me. I hate too much tongue, but i like a lot at times. Don't stress it though you learn through experience, and over a bit of time if you both stay together you will meet in the middle. also my mistake is when i first started kissing i didn't get that i was supposed to suck a little more. It may be that i was just never told but i never was so im sure i was an awful kisser. And my current bf even though we are older didn't ever date in high school so he had never really kissed anyone so he started by really sucking it kind of felt weird. It wasn't bad though in fact i liked it, however i think he doesn't suck as much because he kind of met me in the middle.|`|FJswVeqbaa	all i know it that..the first time that i've had my first kiss/make out time....i actually told the person that i had never kissed before and that i didn't know how to do it...and he actually thought that it was really  cute and he Just showed me how...|`|e86df6aeda098a41020c4baf4c81dcddaa	lol, well its just your first time so theres really nothing to worry about just yet ! :)<br>  <br>  it really depends what mood your in. if your feelin crazy, makeout rough and fast!<br>  <br>  but if your feeling sensual, make it nice and slow. <br>  <br>  remember, practice makes perfect :)|`|s1SVm9Dpaa	its okay! dont worry.<br>  <br>  the first time is kind of wierd to me too.<br>  <br>  but when you keep doing it than it will be fine :)
abb886581ffcf2d8bf185b206f80f441aa	Inbreeding is breeding between close relatives, whether plant or animal. If practiced repeatedly, it leads to an increase in homozygosity of a population. <br>  <br>  Breeding in domestic animals is assortative breeding primarily. Without the sorting of individuals by trait, a breed could not be established, nor could poor genetic material be removed.<br>  <br>  Inbreeding is used by breeders of domestic animals to fix desirable genetic traits within a population or to attempt to remove deleterious traits by allowing them to manifest phenotypically from the genotypes. Inbreeding is defined as the use of close relations for breeding such as mother to son, father to daughter, brother to sister. Breeders must cull unfit breeding suppressed individuals and/or individuals who demonstrate either homozygosity or heterozygosity for genetic based diseases<br>  <br>  Linebreeding, a specific form of inbreeding, is accomplished through breedings of cousins, aunt to nephew, half brother to half sister. This was used to isolate breeds within the companion and livestock industry. For instance an animal with a desirable colour is bred back within the lines with identified selection traits whether it be milk production or adherence to breed standard of appearance or behavior. Breeders must then cull unfit individuals, and in some cases the breeders will then outbreed to increase the level of genetic diversity. Again casual breeding is problematic as it is without the requisite culling of individuals who are either maladaptive, not to breed standard or carriers of poor genetic material that must be removed from a healthy breeding program.<br>  <br>  Inbreeding is also deliberately induced in laboratory mice in order to guarantee a consistent and uniform animal model for experimental purposes.|`|3z3P6j49aa	Not true at all. Inbreeding does not enhance qualities at all, and causes birth defects for animals too. I mean originally they were inbred but that was a long, long time ago.<br>  <br>  But, I think its something about the DNA being too similar.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	It's an urban myth about human babies being born with birth defects from Incest. Animal inbreeding actually does cause lots of problems, they just go unnoticed.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest</a>|`|71VRvldJaa	It has to do with the genes and DNA.  If the genes of the incensual partners are similar and there are defects or mutations in those genes, These defective genes keep recurring and actually spread like a virus.  Incest increases the likelihood that two genes with the same defect will meet up resulting in birth defects.|`|YLajQcFkaa	Kinda like making a copy of a copy.  Sooner or later its all distorted and flawed.  With dogs inbreeding is a problem.  German Shepard's are almost the most inbreed breed and they are full of flaws.  Most breeds have a good gene pool to mix with.|`|LAhGRwU9aa	the human bloodlines werent meant to be mixed like animal leading to  a weak genetic  code ,in the appalations spelled wrong are proof of this|`|eMPeOsRBaa	Purebreds are dogs that are strictly one breed, that doesn't meant hat they have been inbred.
q0JTN9QAaa	If you really love him you will tell him you don't love him anymore and that he gets on your nerves and you never want to see him again.<br>  <br>  That way he can move on and will never wonder what might have been.  People that care that much about what their family thinks will never be happy going against the family wishes and his family will never accept you.<br>  <br>  So you can spend the rest of your life with him and see him unhappy because he misses his family or leave him in a way where he thinks there is no chance with you ever and let him be happy.  You will be able to move on too with time.|`|mwdwDOaWaa	Dear sister, You are a wise person, very wise. My respect to you. Sometimes these sad, difficult steps are the wisest course of action. Now may be you both will be heart broken, but over time I think you come to see that it is the course of action. <br>  <br>  Time is the biggest healer, and when these pains will subside, you will see the wisdom of your actions. I can only imagine to think your pain, but it's the true love that is making you take this drastic step. It will be his loss, to lose someone was worthy as you, to lose some one as loving as you, just because of his narrow minded family!<br>  -------------------<br>  There is an alternate solution, however it may be not to your liking. From what you said about the guy, i assume he is middle-eastern and probably a moslem, hence of different faith to you (ASSUMPTION no offence).  You may ask him to take you to meet his parents and family, or if possible the reverse his parents meeting you, so that they may get to know you better and hence remove their  misconceptions, and see you for what really you are. <br>  <br>  Then perhaps, perhaps they may accept you. Mind you, dead sister, this is only theoretical and I personally wouldn't suggest it. My intention was to show an alternate path.<br>  <br>  Peace sister. My respect to you!|`|pJJyH3vhaa	Wow, sorry to hear about that. However, a man who TRULY loves you, will dump his family for you.|`|15fafbb5314da7937a58fa36d4ece8fbaa	All I can tell you is what a very wise man said once: "Love is retarded". I am sorry that is all I have to offer|`|XJ2BW5p7aa	Unfortunately I think my answer is exactly what you are thinking.<br>  Yes you should leave this relationship alone. Even if he does go against his family at some point he will bring it up and make it your fault. And I think you don't want to be the reason he and his family have an issue.<br>  <br>  Let it be. Let him go. Finish school. And start looking.<br>  I am sure you will find someone from a more similar culture to yours.<br>  <br>  Even if you disagree with above the culture difference may come through in other areas that you are not facing yet... Always tricky getting into relationships with people from other "deeply rooted" cultures.|`|kV9GlWDFaa	For one good girl for focusing on your studies that is more important than this jerry springer live right before you. i suggest you leave these peices where they lay. you MIGHT have something to offer this world. I understand that him marrying his own cousin has got to suck but these are his families and his CULTURES beliefs we cannot change them just like americas ****. lol. You have to make this decision on your own cupcake sorry! 1. you can leave him and be miserable for like what 2 months? <br>  2. you can run away together and live in forbidden esactasy <br>  3. you can tell his family to stop being so damn creepy and tell them to **** off and your gonna **** their son and **** him good and long time!!!<br>   This is retarded that you've been subjected to this obscure enviroment. you know what to do sista just leave this mo fo alone <br>  i know it hurts but its better to have loved and lost then to have never loved at all! i'm sorry if i sounded rude at all i was just trying to cheer you up!

Right.<br>  <br>  Ok i can understand you being busy when my husband and I met I went to college full time and worked and he was in the USA NAVY an almost lived at work...but no matter what we made time for eachother going as far as seeing eachother at odd ends or driving long distences for only a 15 to 30 visit type thing. We also wrote letters through both mail and e-mail and to this day still does. mind you he could not text me back when on some parts of the ship were he did not get eception he always did so with in two hours in between passing to or through parts were he did get. If he was some where were it did cetch I got lucky and we could text back and forth a lot more and I could still work or be in school n him work. <br>  <br>  If the guy is into you no matter what he will make it known an there will be time. <br>  <br>  I would not see him...I do not know him but by the sounds of it he is not good for you or your kids.<br>  <br>  You need a commited man who is into you and your kid or kids I do not no if you have one or more....how ever many...who you are with should understand a family unit and thrive for it.<br>  <br>  Sorry if I sounded harsh but I tell it as it is and that is what comes off to me.<br>  God Bless|`|O1MITmaGaa	maybe since I'm guessing he has a job, he can't always answer right away. he might be at a meeting or something, or driving (and you surely wouldn't want him texting on the road!)<br>  <br>  I think you just need to calm down. You're so jittery over this guy, which is great because that means you really do like him, but don't expect him to act just the same way you do because you two have a tight relationship. two different people are two different people. It's like expecting a gift when you give a gift; you shouldn't expect it because you're giving a gift out of your own good will and kindness. likewise, you should let him be as he is. as long as he seems interested, that's fine.<br>  <br>  but if you're texting him 5x every hour, there might be a problem...|`|tXk0oymyaa	your a single mom<br>  he goes to work and has a life different from yours<br>  <br>  if you really want to be with him<br>  let time to relax<br>  <br>  you want to be with someone who has at least time to not make you worry. <br>  <br>  I say that you give both of you time to slow down the stress. Prepare before hand on certain events. If he breaks them he's not the right guy no matter if he doesn't want sexual contact. has he been married before? it says a lot about a guy and his age. you have a kid : more of the time should be with the kid.

Td2NCCVtaa	first you should know the person very well then know relationship between that guy and other girls get some iformation about that guy from their friend then you can trust on him otherwise he can chit you
JJ1qjygyaa	NO... haha... of course not.  If you really like this guy you need to be persistent.  Us fellas are slow anyways.  Sometimes its really hard for us to express that we like you.  So if hes already done enough to show you that he cares for you, and you think hes worth the time and effort  keep doing whatever it is that your doing.  If you step back, hes gonna automatically assume that your over him.  Its almost like just handing him over to this new girl.  Unless you really don't think that hes all that.  In that case i could see why you'd step back.  If you want him, continue to be in his life.  Continue to be yourself, cause apparently your what he is looking for.  Its always scary with love and relationships.  You will always fear rejection, it may seem easier to just back off.  However if you don't take the chance you may pass up someone that could be your soul mate. good luck with this boy.|`|MMKh70VFaa	crazy you ask because i was in the same situation<br>  <br>  the guy i liked had 3 girls on his mind (one was me)<br>  and anywaaay i stuck around for a little and gave him girl advice and we became like best friends but i stopped talking to him for a while bc idk it was kind of frustrating that i liked him (but i never mentioned that) and he actually got with one of the other two girls and was with her for a week till he realized he really only liked me.......long story short he is now my boyfriend of 2 years and we are happily inlove :)<br>  <br>  hope that helps in many ways!<br>  and good luck!|`|gFgltsmcaa	no tell her all the bad things he does and you know all of them|`|mtRtQIcWaa	NO U GO GET YO MAN GIRL|`|gSFFHv1iaa	likes and dislike are just human emotions which grows strong as we think positive or negative about any other human<br>  <br>  <br>  but if u love thats guy n love is bout dedicating ur whole n soul to him n same from his side than go get him or do wats make ur guy happy<br>  <br>  <br>  other wise find some one better who can lvoe u till the end of time<br>  <br>  true love is like two bodies and single souls and for rest likes n dislike dont think much<br>  <br>  cuz evry emotion is our thought nothing else so stop thinking much|`|NQ239NgAaa	geez get him before she does<br>  u dont wanna lose him to her do u|`|I2gs5opxaa	be friends with him as well time will tell .|`|vwgmh3v6aa	No keep going for him!!|`|DEEpdxNraa	Hmm, I suggest you go see or read "He's Just Not That Into You"<br>  A very good movie.

Why put yourself in a situation where you haven't even started something with this guy yet and he's already attracted to somebody else? I say stay away from situations like that. It's not worth it. Unless you like the competitive aspect of it, that is. I personally don't.|`|osDB9DTEaa	I'm thinking that if you step back, he may think you are losing interest in him; this will probably give him reason to turn to the other gal.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.
ggfE4rlvaa	I'd say tell him how you feel! Especially before he gets serious with this girl! He might be trying to move on thinking that you don't want him. If you tell him how you feel, I bet he'd dump her in a heartbeat. Don't let this relationship go on without telling him how you feel though. She would get over it easier if it was soon as possible.|`|8cUR80R5aa	If you have such a strong friendship, i think that you owe it to him to be honest about your feelings. Especially while he is only casually seeing someone, and it is at the beginning stages. First make sure that you aren't just jealous, and if you intend on letting him know your feelings, make sure you know if you want to have a relationship with him or not. You should tell him either way. Let him know you have these feelings, but if you don't want to act on them, let him know that too. He probably senses that something is up, but may be jumping to other conclusions. It really doesn't help a relationship even if it is a friendship, if there is dishonesty. I think you would hurt his feelings more if he fund out when it was too late to act on.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and don't worry. It sounds like you have been on his mind for 20 years. Whatever you tell him, he will be happy to know.|`|2443b235f2f0711e9a4e23b054575479aa	ok the way i see it he open the door telling you how he feel, an you left him stand . yes by all means tell him how you feel,their a old saying, it better to love an lost than  never love,  so yes make the jump let him know you true feelling|`|1jIzBUkhaa	Yes , tell him how you fell for him.|`|LRF70DMjaa	As uncomfortable as it may seem sometimes you need to leap out of your comfort zone and take a risk.  I think the absolute worst case scenario is that he doesn't want to be "more than friends".  However, he'll still always be your friend.  Best case scenario, he's just been waiting to hear it from you and feels the same way.<br>  <br>  You won't know unless you give it a try.  Life's not worth the regrets.<br>  <br>  I hope everything works out for you two.  Good luck!|`|qof2d5ujaa	That's absolutely cute! <br>  <br>  You don't have to take my advice since I'm only 15, but I know that when a guy and a girl have been friends for THAT long, unless they're gay or lesbian, cannot be JUST friends. I doubt he's gay and I doubt you are too.<br>  <br>  But anyway,<br>  <br>  You will never lose your friendship, trust me, so I would tell him. Life is short, and you don't wanna be like one of those people who end up telling someone they love them when they're old and gray because you'll only have about 10 days to be together. <br>  <br>  This girl he's with is merely a obstacle so I say, get off the computer and tell him he's the one for you!|`|62meQdw0aa	Although I don't know your exact situation, from what I've read, it sounds very promising!

Gfj24Tb6aa	I swear this girl sounds exactly like me.<br>  I may be wrong about what she's thinking (because I can't read her mind after all) but I will tell you MY reasons for doing what your girl is doing.<br>  <br>  Last year, there was this guy who liked me in one of my classes. He talked to me a bit, and I started to get feelings for him too. As we talked more, he began to find me outside of the one class we shared. Normaly, he'd intentionaly walk by me and smile or something. I would mirror his gestures, but not do more than what he did because I was afraid that I would screw something up or look stupid (and if you are older than her, she may be dealing with some intimidation or fear of embarasment of saying the wrong thing to you). <br>  <br>  Then, I played a very stupid card with this guy. I played 'Hard to get'. It was a big mistake on my part because I believe my guy took my strategie just the same way you are feeling about your girl. He may have thought I was avoiding him or thought I was being arrogant or egotistical. Whatever he thought, it wasn't the results I was hoping for by playing my little game. He stopped talking to me altogether. Now he has a girlfriend and I get a mixture of stomach pains and butterflies everytime I see him because I still have feelings for him. <br>  <br>  So your girl may not have much experience in dating ( much like I did) and be trying to play hard to get. For hue mean time... I would continue talking to her in class and smiling at her. Smiles=good! Outside of your class, if you walk near her and you think she should be seeing you from where she's at, call her name or say hi. Start a conversation and walk with her. The more you talk to her, the more willing and comfortable she may be to talk to you outside of class. <br>  <br>  Girls tend to get stuck in the 'guys make all the first moves' mind set, and some of us are just not that comfortable with initiating conversations. But as your relationship develops, she may become more likely that she will pat more direct attention to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your girl :)<br>  <br>  Ps: I think it's awesome that you're interested in a younger girl.

yDVlTUYTaa	Tell her you found out that her boyfriend has been putting pressure on her and using you as an excuse. Tell her you want her to feel free to be honest with you about how she feels, or what she's doing and let her know you'll be there to listen to her if she wants to talk. All you can do is be as honest as possible with her as you can and ask her to be the same.<br>  You also might tell her that, contrary to family rumors, you and your boyfriend keep a very strong line and you would never be with someone who pushed you to do something or made you feel like you owe him something. She needs to think about if that's the kind of relationship she really wants. A victim relationship.<br>  And finally, I don't think there's anything you can do to punish this loser guy unless it's helping your cousin wake up to the fact that he's a user, in it for himself and doesn't really care for her.  If he loses his hold over her and she sees him for what he is, that's probably the best thing you could do for her and the best revenge to him.|`|AA10892747	If she didn't tell you that, how did you find out?<br>  <br>  Honestly, I would tell her parents.

I'd get into his head and scare the crap out of him as far as i can tell he just sounds like a cocky guy who thinks he has it all so just get into his head and he'll break down.<br>   <br>  On the other hand to make things less serious i would totally make them break up makes the Guy feel stupid and retarded
zUJUwSXMaa	first of all, yes if i were 13, i'd feel really insulted. but then again, she's ur grandmom and yes, she said all this things because she care about you and trust me i believe she has no intention to hurt you in any way. :D<br>  <br>  so i advise you to call her back or meet up with her or smth and try to talk to her nicely and explain to her that you really really love hockey and that it is not smth that you happen to just like. tell her this is your passion, explain to her, express your passion of hockey and the reason why u like it. well it's kinda true that hockey is a rough sport but hey, almost all sports are rough and you'll definitely face injuries in certain occasions someday. bottomline is - honestly tell her the main reason about you enjoy hockey and that perhaps one day you would love to make a career out of it. comfort her too, tell her that when you play hockey - you'll definitely be careful. plus you could tell her that besides excelling academically, you'd want a hobby to enjoy and hockey seems to be the perfect sport! tell her too, that in the future she would be proud to watch her grandson play hockey for his school/national team or smth. just tell her about all the wonderful things in hockey (: i dunno much about hockey but i really think you could convince her in accepting u playing for that sport. perhaps ask ur parents to help along in the conversation? ^^<br>  <br>  sports is never a mistake especially when you have a passion of it, and you are in such a young age - so good for u! but really, i knw you're frustrated at ur grandmom but she's just reaaaaly worried for u, u shud be thankful for that! and yes she might seem a lil overprotective but trust me, i have a 14-yr-old bro who loooooves soccer and he broke his knee and was like using crutches for 2 weeks and my grandmom was like asking him to quit soccer&stuff but after a few conversations - she realised that its pointless to stop someone from chasing his dream.<br>  <br>  well, im so sorry to hear about this and do tell me how it went. all the best!<br>  <br>  XOXO|`|Eug52iQDaa	You said it yourself.  She called your dad out of concern.  She loves you and doesn't want you to get hurt.  That's not an awful thing, you know.  It's what grandmothers are all about.  Get used to it.  You acted VERY badly hanging up on her!  Especially since she said that 3 years ago.  Shame on you.  You owe her an apology.  <br>  <br>  Plenty of kids have parents that don't care what they do.  You're very lucky to have parents and a grandmother that care about you and look out for your welfare.  You are showing absolutely no respect for your grandmother in the statements you made here.  <br>  <br>  To answer your question, no, I wouldn't be insulted.  I would explain to her politely why I feel as I do about hockey.  How can you expect her, even now, 3 years later, to trust you to make good decisions when you're throwing a temper tantrum?|`|NrkWd4Aoaa	If I were 13 I might have been insulted, too.  It's a dumb excuse for chewing out your grandmother for a three-year-old telephone call that had no practical effect on your hockey career whatsoever.<br>  <br>  It is good that you have the kind of relationship with your grandmother that you can call her up and tell her how you feel.  Her excuse was not, however, dumb. <br>  <br>  You owe your grandmother an apology for hanging up on her and chewing her out for caring about you and not wanting you to get hurt.   <br>  <br>  Neither one of you sound like bad people.  You made a mistake, but it is a matter of immaturity.<br>  <br>  It is great that you have found your calling in life.  I hope that you also find time to help with chores and keep up with your academics and do other things necessary to be a well-rounded person.<br>  <br>  Blessings!|`|HiuNSScLaa	i think shes just concerned but i would have felt insulted to but i think she cares alot but again i probably would have done the same thing|`|O1MITmaGaa	a little jolt of a different angle:<br>  <br>  she's your grandma. as I've found out, family, especially parents and grandparents, are always going to be concerned about your safety. the one thing they want, more than anything, more than you getting rich and successful, is you being in good health. they don't want you to get your teeth knocked out and have a horrible smile, or for you to injure a leg and not be able to walk for the rest of life, so you won't be able to do a lot of things in the future. Health is very important, and parents are always worried about it because they just want to see you walk about and function like a normal person.<br>  <br>  if you can understand that, then you've understood something far beyond what many people your age can grasp.<br>  <br>  I had a similar situation. I played piano until I was 12, about, at which time my grandma point out I grinded my teeth. she worried it was due to stress, and my parents attributed it to my piano lessons. I was, I must say, fabulous at the piano. I was set to do incredible things on those black and white keys, but they pulled me from it, because they were afraid it was affecting me mentally and physically. I can't blame them, but I do agree, I dream about what could've been often.<br>  <br>  you're only 13. you should take that chance now to grasp your dream, your passion. I was unlucky; I lost the piano finally at age 14 (I went on and off on it) and now, today, I regret it. you still have time. you only lost 3 years, whereas I've lost like 5. make up for it. if you try hard, you'll be able to catch up. don't let people step between you and your goals, even if they are family. but if your grandma's going to get a heart attack over you taking up hockey again, it might be a problem. but if it's something you've really got your whole heart in, I'd say go for it, before it's too late.|`|XI3blPQtaa	she really only has ur best interests in mind. i used to argue with mine about evrything until she got sick and by the time we made up she got worse and eventually passed away 10 days b4 xmas last year. what im trying to say is do what u want to do but dont hate her 4 caring about u cos u dont know how long u have with her.

yptfd3sIaa	Explain to your parents that you need a break from your cousins. When/if they come over, hang out in your room. Don't go to their home. If they ask what's up, simply say that you are a female and they are animals and you'd love to spend time with them after they've outgrown this beastly stage.

They don't want to come off as being stupid and say the wrong thing.|`|231e2f619695988a9a2770ac10966cd2aa	she might think your cute or something. but judging the way you talk "and crap," i dont know what she would see in you.|`|55CpRJDvaa	She likes you.<br>  She might not be comfortable actually MEETING you.<br>  <br>  I don't know. =/|`|5TJdDCREaa	Maybe you could lighten up on saying crap so much lol.<br>  Uhm seeing her naked without her knowing is something that you probably shouldn't be screaming from the rooftops and that doesn't exactly help build a friendship or anything.<br>  <br>  And I'd really like to understand why you cared enough to ask this question. It's only your friends gf, she's doesn't have to like you and you don't have to like her and/or engage in conversation.|`|xEwOAjJWaa	maybe shes scared of falling ofr you,<br>  or maybe shes had some bad experiances.<br>  why have you seen her naked lmao|`|d36OrpbDaa	what the hell are you asking?  can you clarify?|`|4snTNQ98aa	yeah i agree...|`|rvmiK8rgaa	I get that your language is a pose, so ok, why not?  It's fun stream-of-consciousness put-on, why not?<br>  <br>  You ask what are some possibilities for her being nervous????<br>  <br>  Maybe she DOES know you've seen her naked and fears that body is all you want & won't respect her.<br>  <br>  Maybe you are so much the tough guy that she's afraid to let you in, in case you drive her wild with Passion.<br>  <br>  So tough guy, Dude, Mean Hombre,  you ask HER -"what you scared of?"
76nTvO4iaa	You've mentioned 4 people - 2 cousins + an aunt & uncle.   If you're only talking about 4 (fairly closely related) people, invite them! <br>  <br>  The 2 cousins might or might not come, but it will make their mother (your aunt) happy that you thought to invite them.<br>  <br>  It sounds like the aunt & uncle from your dad's side would like to  come, since they came to your mom's wedding.|`|PBdPD748aa	you're putting everyone elses 'feelings' before your own, stop it!! <br>  <br>  its your special day with the man you love and there is no way that you need to have people there that you dont like/ talk to!! <br>  <br>  and you dont need to answer to anyone, its up to you and your future husband. you cant please everybody and it is your special day so you need to just focus on you and your man, everyone will get over it, believe me!<br>  <br>  before my fiance and i decided to elope, we were inviting his parents and not his sister - she was always against our relationship and everyone accepted that choice of her not being there - and we're talking close family here - not distant, so it can be done if u do it properly! there is nothing wrong with only having the people there that are actively apart of BOTH of your life. just because your bloodlines are related somewhere doesnt mean you have to have a big string attached to them!<br>  <br>  the purpose of your wedding day is to celebrate you and your fiance becoming family - dont forget that. you have who you want and feel has blessed and supported your relationship there - and no one else.|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	Weddings make or break families and you have to be careful.  You should invite all of your relatives unless there is some falling out and you are alienated and have been for years.  It is the right thing to do.  They can always decline and that is on them but if you don't invite them you will never hear the end of it.  Trust me.|`|J38v75bvaa	i have the same problem.<br>  <br>  just remember it comes down to the fact that it is YOUR wedding. not there's.<br>  <br>  if you want to be around all the people you love and enjoy being around then invite only those people.|`|S3tK5UN3aa	I would just invite the whole family because some might feel hurt if they're not invited and it might just turn into a big argument.|`|64ef40bfea69a52c85daf6104a54abbfaa	I'd invite them and just hope that they can't make it.... <br>  <br>  I know this is probably going to come off immature and selfish but if anything I'd do it just for the gifts/money.|`|HvbIE03saa	Keep in mind it's you and your fiance's wedding, and ultimately you should only invite people that are important to you. <br>  <br>  Maybe you don't talk to some family members now, but were they a big influence on your life growing up? Sometimes people think "Well, because I don't talk to them now or within the past 5 years, they're not important" and they can forget what an impact the person had on their lives when they were younger.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to invite them, which is fine, you can always just say that you're having a small wedding (but only if you really are) and use that as the reason to help avoid hurt feelings. No matter what you do though, there might be some hurt feelings and you just have to be prepared for that.<br>  <br>  Good luck : )
7IhVne7Xaa	From what you've said here she doesn't seem to want to date you, just be her friend! There are plenty more girls out there for you!<br>  :)|`|uzGjTBhYaa	if u dont know if she is tht into u call her like late tonite and ask her out and you can always say u were drunk if things go bad|`|olhVY0o5aa	cal her right nw its ur mistake and correct it nw by calling her d'nt hesitate to say ur feeling to her okey best wishes from my side<br>  take care and cal her nw|`|bYU77eteaa	call when you want to.  I would be flattered if I knew you couldn't wait "3 days" to call me...if you called me that night or something.  Its when you start calling me 8 times a day is when I got a problem...but dont hesitate to show me that you are interested. you might miss out|`|HzP6xg1Uaa	Oh boy. Here's the truth about women.<br>  <br>  1. Very few of them actually know what they want. They vacillate constantly.<br>  2. Don't over analyze her not returning your call. They do that all the time.<br>  <br>  My advice: Ask her after class, preferably alone, maybe grab lunch together if possible and ask her out. Put the ball in her court.<br>  Good Luck.
91a2b9fe0d0ef5781c3a0beca8dcdd82aa	wow, isnt he a dreamer! its true, everybody loves differently, but that doesnt mean that he loves you more than another. its an emotional blackmail to control you and keep you by his side and to make you think, if you did leave him, that you wouldnt find anyone to love you. i say its a load of crap. your young, your beautiful and probably an amazing girl. so the next time he says that, say to him "do you want to see if thats true?" with the strong hint that its over. that should make him see your sick of hearing that and your willing to put it to the test (even if your not going to hahaha).|`|DiRXd5Lpaa	That used to be my ex boyfriends line too.  Its his way of making sure that you don't leave him, he wants you to actually believe that that could be true.  He lacks any self esteem.  You'd be better off without him and to find someone who would actually love you for you and not hold it over your head.|`|Am54a7c0aa	Cause he's an abusive boyfriend. Leave him before you start feeling trapped and like you have no way out.|`|eKDYbe9Laa	because he lov only ur body|`|AB8nUS3uaa	don't believe him.. someone will love you for you.. hes just trying to make you not leave him.. if hes telling you that stuff hes a piece of crap.. leave him for someone who treats you good and doesn't want to lose you..|`|PXuoxlwbaa	so that you wont leave him and you will think that hes the only one who could care for you that way. which in reality, probably isnt true. If you're not ahppy, get out. Don't stick around because of some nonsense he says.|`|8cOstTBoaa	Either a) hes trying to make u feel like ur nothing, and arent worth anything or if hes a good guy b) that he loves u soooo much, its not even possible that anyone else can ever love u more than he alredy does.|`|HCzZClfvaa	It sounds to me that he is trying to scare you into staying with him. He doesn't seem to want you to end it so is lying to you to make you stay together.|`|D0KuQ4Qeaa	because he thinks that your his everything and the reason is he knows you will find someone else after him and hes afraid of the thought of you having another if things dont work out between you to|`|FgF39gBZaa	Trying to make you give into thinking that you will always be depressed if you don't get him. While, it is the other way around. You probably should leave him.|`|sxJgu3C9aa	LOVE is unmeasurable, unlimited...this is what he means.<br>  <br>  LOVE HIM and be grateful for being LOVED !<br>  LOVE is about GIVING...|`|AA11599034	so u dnt leave him <br>  or maybe he wants you to see the truth and notice other guys won't love you the way he loves you because he knows you<br>  theyll just like you for ur "bodies.."|`|o2FJIXS9aa	He is doing it to try and control you and keep you with him. My ex-husband told me I would never have a life at all after I left him, but it's been 15 years and I am a pretty happy person. I guess you have reasons for leaving him, and one is probably obsession. It's not true that no one will ever love you - it is his way of keeping you to himself.|`|V8Fpgd9maa	You are dating a person who is grossly insecure, has control issues, and turns all of that into anger and abuse. <br>  <br>  I've read many of your questions about this guy, and I can't believe you are still with him. My guess is that you stay with him for security.<br>  <br>  Long term what will happen with his personality temperament is that it leads to escalate to further mental abuse, manipulation, guilt trips, then physical violence.<br>  <br>  If you don't believe me, go to a woman's abuse/ batter shelter and talk to them about your boyfriend - they will tell you their experiences and then you will be seeking a restraining order.<br>  <br>  watch.
b1vxzMZPaa	As her friend, I would ask her about it. When you do, watch her eyes carefully. She may lie because she is afraid of it getting out (and thinking he might hurt her worse), and if you look at her eyes when you ask her, you'll probably be able to tell if she's lying. If it was my friend, I would ask about it. If she gets mad at you for prying, just tell her that you are concerned for her safety and are here to help her or listen to her problems, if she wants to talk about it. I hope it's not abuse!|`|zqjVAqPHaa	choking her with his hands|`|8FbOtXAXaa	It could either be massive hickeys or he hurt her. Do you ever really know a person? If this is just a recent thing that started between the two of them she might not be ready to tell you yet. I would talk to her about it and if she is being abused be very supportive of her and help her in any way that you can.|`|eMX7eDgbaa	Well it could be that some one gave her a hicky. I mean if she is with a guy and all then that is a very possible explanation. If you see this again like in another 3 weeks maybe you should look into it.
cidwIuJRaa	Maybe you should just hang out by yourself.Nothing wrong with just being a loner.|`|bYU77eteaa	Yall are different...you may have to find friends you have more things in common with.  By the weekend you shouldnt "hate" your friends...thats when you are suppose to want them more...so I figure yall aren't suppose to be tight like that...different interests|`|x3g9IlhVaa	The first thing you need to realise is that these arent friends, they are just people you hang out at the same place with for five days a week.<br>  <br>  You shouldnt feel bad because they dont have much in common with you other than school stuff.  So what if you have different interests to them..perhaps they could learn something from you and vice versa.<br>  <br>  Someone else said you should try to find others who like the same things you do..really good advice.|`|8IfePMa3aa	First they say they're your friends, then you say they don't accept you...which is it?<br>  You can't have both.|`|4qL7oRrVaa	It's annoying being the odd one out. <br>  <br>  They don't understand, and they won't ever understand until they mature and learn how to accept.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, it takes a long time. So just be happy with who you are, the more you question yourself baised on their comments, the more their comments will make you unhappy with yourself. Tell them all the time if they comment on your interests, that you are happy, too bad for them they haven't found something interesting and unique to be happy with.|`|n7hezV5aaa	Well it sounds like your friends wish that you had a little more in common with them. Don't you? I mean I see what you mean about liking different things, because I'm also into reading, sci-fi/fantasy, anything that has to do with vampires just fascinates me, BUT...I do put an effort into doing other things as well. You can't maintain a friendship if you just do what you want to do. When you say you hate your friends by the end of the week, do you mean that you see them so much that you're sick of them and wouldn't want to hang out? I think your friends might be more willing to accept who you are if you made an effort into liking or at least doing some of the things they like as well. Maybe you could taech each other about the stuff you like. You could explain to them what fascinates you about all the stuff you like and vice versa. Try it. If it doesn't work then you might have to find some buddies that are into the stuff you are.|`|rbkWmBThaa	and you call them friends..i mean if they are your friends they should respect what you like...my friends and i have different likes..but after awhile we discover the things we have in common..and besides you see them 5 days in a week..isn't it enough?..tell them what you feel..ask them why they choose you as one of your friend if they don't respect what you like..|`|jxpa713daa	if your a follower convert and learn about the celebs. and such<br>  its natural for teens to like celebs. and gossip and stuff<br>  <br>  but if your a better person and want to be you, then find yourself a group of actual friends, cause what you just described wernt friends, they were your half *** job of trying to find people to fit in with, and not looking for people who are actually like you, maybe join a group or club you enjoy and meet some people|`|pniQtmz7aa	they are stupid... eveyrone is differnt some more similar to others and somemaybe a little less... ofr exampl me i am am shy, quite and not very talkative ...and my friends are always talking i love reading too and they dont... just forget about them and make new friends who actually understand u ... just forget about them trust me u will feel much better...<br>  hope i helped xD ??|`|WX2S8eUxaa	im was in a similar situation. Do you want your group to change? or do you want to change groups? thats what you have to decide on..from what your saying it seems like leaving the group is the better option,|`|0bae6f6117c8017281b80e06ee9926b1aa	If they can't accept you for being yourself than there's a problem, seems like they want you to be more like them, and DON'T! Being yourself and **** anyone who thinks differently.|`|NeBDl4Hfaa	They're not your friends.  Maybe you could join a community or a group of individuals who share the same level of intellect such as yours.|`|nJszzqRCaa	i dont realy think they are your friends and i agree with the celebrity thing its not important wow thanks for making me relise :D|`|P0nkf64Taa	You sound like you dis like them anyway, maybe try talking to a different group of people. One that you think may have similar interests as you. That way if you enjoy'd the same thing, you wouldn't dread hanging out with them outside of school. I don't see how you could know every single person, personally, ha. enough that you've already decided you hate them? maybe if you tried getting to know someone else. Or just don't talk to people at your school. I personally dis like almost everyone at my school, I have one good bestfriend, and two/three other friends that annoy me. That's all I need ;) and I have many other friends that go to other schools that I talk to outside of school. usually just for someone to talk to. Sometime romantic interests:p
jqsu76T5aa	flirt:)|`|fh8bQdGkaa	It's possible for it to happen, but it can be quite hard if it's the guy who likes the girl first in the relationship (also how old the friendship is).<br>  Just be yourself, do a little flirting, ask her out on casual dates. Don't make it obvious, but little by little, until the perfect time, something awesome will happen, and maybe a conversation you guys are having at some point subtly gives the hint that you like her. See how it works out, but don't go crazy if she doesn't want to date. Understand her feelings, and be a friend. Maybe do a little truth or dare to spice things up a bit. When it comes your turn do something like, "would you ever see me as a potential date?" you sly guy...|`|1uRUaSblaa	As a guy, you can make the 1st <br>  move upfront.Ask her how she feels about <br>  your friendship with her.If her answer is positive,<br>  confess your feelings to her and allow <br>  her some time to think about it. <br>  Date her out again and go on from there.:)|`|sxJgu3C9aa	Tell her straight away, invite her for a date, show her you care, spend as much time you both can afford together, share, be open to her, respect her.|`|dHF0l6bLaa	dont tell her wait untill the perfect time, love isnt somthing u say just randomly , love is the unconditional felling of affection. so the key is not to be clingy, the best way to show her is try to remeber somthing that was always very special to her that she wud of told u but expected u had for gotten and do that|`|x3bkJHBZaa	Don't hint her, she might not get it. Go up to her & express your feeling. She might be waiting for you to make the 1st move. After all, you can still love her as a friend. All the best to you|`|3QGv54ynaa	Tell her. Girls don't like hints when it has to do with guys. She probably would just want you to say how you feel just like you would want her to do the same.|`|363c1dee7cd5e73a40fbdbfd509017e5aa	Prepare yourself to lose the friendship.<br>  <br>  Write a letter.
QKM3NLmaaa	yeah. i ended up sliding my tongue all over the screen and pushing all the keys.|`|q2H9jgDSaa	yepp.<br>  haha<br>  kiss me through the phone.|`|By1DJAUOaa	IF ONLY IT WER POSSIBLE...|`|b9ShNrWoaa	raises hand*<br>  <br>  AYE!

lBKfmRWCaa	Something must have changed for him not to speak to you now. Have you asked him about it? Gone to his house to speak to him about this and found out what changed? <br>  <br>  Seems to me he is the only person who can answer your question.
69SHxWA9aa	Ohh My Gosh!<br>  <br>  I a glad that you have a trusted friend that will be there for you when you need someone.<br>  <br>  My wife did not want to be with me when the chips where down, now she is the ex wife, and well her chips are down to about nothing nowdays.  While vengeance is not mine, can I say that the house that she bought is worth a little less than when she bought it with the money left over from our divorce, while I took my money and retired for a couple of years, enjoying myself fully during the first break in working that I have ever had since high school!<br>  <br>  There is a country song about a good friend who will hit the gas, get there fast, no matter what.  Help you with a flat tire, get your bus fare, a place to spend the night, and so on.<br>  <br>  I hope that you are grateful for the help, and willing to help someone else when they need it.<br>  <br>  Cheers!<br>  <br>  Her house value dropped about $150,000 in the past three years!  I think that would make me cry.  But she is able to get over that.  I think.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	Yes I've had many a good friend who when beyond what they had to do to help me out over the years, and I know how you feel. And always treasure that moment in time for ever.<br>  take care<br>  dave|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	It means he's someone you can really rely on, when you weren't sure you could before.... And that's a great feeling! =D|`|tYNnVFNpaa	omg what happened!?!?|`|XI3blPQtaa	OMG did he give you an orgasm or something?lol|`|h4SWtjb2aa	wut did he do to you?!?|`|hcC1tMwraa	ok you have to tell us what happened!! isn't it great when people do nice things!
dE0vtX2eaa	nah. not lonely. im in a relationship but before this great one ive been on and off with tons of girls and i feel that i have the required perpective to help people that desperately need advice. i mean, who better to give one advice than someone who has actually been there and done that?<br>  <br>  ---tigger....i think my mum ran over him yesterday. twas a hit and run. he just jumped right out infront of me!|`|xEmIhOc3aa	nope i need pts..and im not lonely im happy...thnx 4 the pts|`|d36OrpbDaa	ha no just bored. thanks for the points! hhhhaaaaaaaaaaa|`|WQ3uCllqaa	I'm just bored and my bf is working out.<br>  <br>  He sure is big guy...|`|AF8JWedEaa	will u be my friend?!?!?<br>  <br>  and tigger too ??|`|Xb7kaCkiaa	okay yay<br>  >:)<br>  <br>  <br>  tigger is real..
c6g92RRVaa	he does love you but probably just isn't ready for marriage. there are different levels to love and just because you Do love someone doesn't mean you should instantly get married. take things slower and get to know this guy. you will get to a point where you insecurities will go and you feel closer to him than anyone. don't be in a rush toget married enjoy it now while it lasts|`|5KcUyLFRaa	Maybe your reading far to much into it. Maybe he really just doesn't feel ready for it. You should be glad he was honest, and didn't just say yes to make you happy.|`|hsyI1DxDaa	Marriage is pretty serious and a BIG step forward. Your boyfriend might just not feel ready for that kind of responsibility. Don't rush into that sort of thing.
3ISGQ4Csaa	YES! The guy i like is tall, athletic, has a really nice smile, nice lips, beautiful eyes, and this dark brown hair that looks really good in contrast to his light skin. If he didn't have the acne scars he has, i would've melted from his hotness. Not to mention his personality is naturally and very sexy:)|`|gFgltsmcaa	nope but you can fool women into thinking you are|`|Ym6rACTsaa	I have slight, very slight, scarring and my wife still thinks I'm handsome.|`|rvmiK8rgaa	Sure.<br>  <br>  The most beautiful woman I know has lots, but it don't mean nothing. Being hot is about inner beauty.|`|WQ3uCllqaa	Yup. Steve Nash comes to mind. Also, my step mom is very pretty and she has acne scars. You just gotta play it off...|`|rX4ti0Nsaa	yes, attitude and behavior is everything|`|du5MNrQ6aa	Yes|`|abOSnIrxaa	yup|`|M0KLWw54aa	yup its in the attitude|`|o2FJIXS9aa	I have slight acne scars and I feel self-conscious about it. But it never let me stop me from doing anything I wanted to do. I have good features and a good attitude. Because I do have it, I notice other people that do. Bill Murray has acne scars and has played a leading man.|`|dE0vtX2eaa	yep. when the camera isnt focus on their face! haha. but seriously, looks arent everything, specially a couple of pimple scars.
yNWgQcHkaa	well in ur opinion who is more popular/more beutiful cuz he might wanna be popular then his heart...<br>  <br>  or his new gf dunt want him communicate with him.<br>  maybe he was kinda not rlly liking you...
x5N1PO4haa	B'coz girls will be girls!!|`|dE0vtX2eaa	i think shes a typical girl. dont know what she got till its gone. dont worry about it man. you should go to her and say, look how the mighty have fallen. when you wanted her back, she said know. and now that you are over it, look how desperate she is. be strong man, dont let em know that you are weak, otherwise youll have trouble finding another|`|rvmiK8rgaa	Go to the Source, Man, ask her.  Don't ask us, ask her - how do you REALLY feel about me?  Do it!|`|8FbOtXAXaa	She is sending you mixed signals obviously because she says she doesn't want you and just wants to be friends and then the next thing you know she is all over you for being all over another girl. She is just jealous because she thought that she had the upper hand by saying she just wanted to be friends and now you are with someone else and she feels like you got away from her.Get used to it, us girls are just jealous by nature:)|`|vkQOeDlUaa	Girls have to be the center of attention..........|`|uGxWOIOdaa	Its a girl's secret.<br>  LOL!|`|Gfj24Tb6aa	because we just want to be loved :)|`|jxpa713daa	not all girls are like that bro<br>  shes just jealous that she made a wrong dessision or that when she said she just wanted to be friends that she didnt say what she ment and said, lets give it some time....<br>  <br>  so if you like this "date" girl then work on it<br>  if not ignore it, she has no business in your business, youve only been out with her once|`|IaMByOjFaa	Maybe she realized later on that she made the wrong decision by letting you go.  But when she saw you with the girl those feeling came back to soon.  Besides men and women get jealous. It all part of the Circle of life.  Like the Lion King|`|iteNhkEdaa	i  am a girl and maybe the reason hat she done that is because she still has feelings for you and she never noticed. she is keeping it all to herself for some reason. if i was you i would stay away from her.|`|WQ3uCllqaa	Girls like guys to trip over them, even they don't like them back, they like the attention,they like keeping you on a string...girls...*rolls eyes*. Just be glad you made her jealous, she deserved it;)|`|du5MNrQ6aa	they get jealous because men are manwhores and flirt with anything with a vagina.|`|078UfDg6aa	lol|`|7iwZRuUmaa	there is more to this story...|`|zZYShwgqaa	well firstly if she hides her feelings to not make a scene she might be hiding her real feelings for you. which is strange but some girls do that. and i mean if you're doing a little PDA some girls who have had previous feelings would be upset that A) you seemed to have gotten over them pretty quickly and B) they didn't get that from you. or another option would be that she thinks your a dick for doing all that **** wiht a chick ya never met before.|`|OsauNtKPaa	I think she wanted to be friends with you to learn about you more n' take it slow before she dated you....so she moved backwards.<br>  <br>  However, she still liked you and maybe had intentions to move froward with you later when she was ready. I guess she still had her hopes on you.<br>  <br>  But then you let her down really hard by going after another girl, really really really fast...|`|rX4ti0Nsaa	girls hate it when they think your happier with someone else. especially when they did the breaking up.  they hope you just sit desparately by the phone waiting for them to call. ignore her and keep doing what your doing.|`|9s5duQmFaa	It is in every girl's gene to act jealous.and when she said she just wanted to be friends...did you even bother to ask why>?|`|C7Ehw7Kdaa	Insecurity|`|I8iKjRkBaa	Why are you worried? If she doesn't want to date you then your fair game for some other lucky female. I personally wouldn't appreciate the games she is trying to play and I would have no part of it. Tell her she missed out and date the hottie at the party.<br>  What it is, is she doesn't want you, but at the same time, she doesn't want anyone else to want you either. Don't ask, that's just how it is. There is no logic behind it, you just gotta take charge and tell her what you think. She will either like you more for it or, she will not like you for it, but at this point, what do you have to loose?

Lucretious. Royalty free use.<br>  The Lightning Bolt that Shatters Our World<br>  Dr. Nathan Kollar, Professor of Religious Studies at St. John Fisher College offered these words on suffering: <br>  Like a tree struck by lightning--splintered, shaken, denuded--<br>  our world is broken by suffering, and we will never be the same again. <br>  A sudden death occurs without any forewarning; it is unanticipated. A traumatic death, in addition to being sudden, can also be violent, mutilating or destructive; it can be random and/or preventable or may involve many deaths. A sudden, accidental, unexpected or traumatic death shatters the world as we know it. It is often a loss that does not make any sense. <br>  In an instance life is forever changed. Survivors* are left with the knowledge that life is not always fair and that sometimes bad things happen to good people. The sudden, traumatic death leaves the survivors feeling shaken, unsure and vulnerable. <br>  <br>  *Survivors are all of those who suffered injuries or losses during traumatic events. Survivors can also be the rescue workers, ems, medical personell, friends and relatives of the victims. <br>  <br>  Definitions - Deaths and Losses <br>  <br>  Deaths <br>  A Sudden Death is an instant unexpected death or a death that occurs within one hour of the onset of symptoms. <br>  An Accidental Death is the loss of life that results from bodily injury caused by an accident. With an accidental death, survivors are left thinking that the death was so random and/or preventable that something could have been done to keep it from happening. <br>  <br>  A Traumatic Death is one that is also sudden and unanticipated. The traumatic death is also frequently violent, mutilating or destructive, random and/or preventable. It may involve multiple deaths or be one in which the mourner has a personal encounter with death. <br>  <br>  Losses <br>  A Sudden Loss is a loss that occurs without any forewarning. In an instant, life is forever changed. <br>  <br>  An Accidental Loss is a loss, often a bodily injury, caused by an accident. There are many different types of losses that can be experienced. <br>  <br>  A Traumatic Loss is a sudden and unanticipate loss that is also frequently of a violent, mutiliating, destructive nature that may be random and seem preventable. <br>  <br>  Definition - Traumatic Event <br>  <br>  A Traumatic Event is an event, or series of events, that causes moderate to severe stress reactions. Traumatic events are characterized by a sense of horror, helplessness, serious injury, or the threat of serious injury or death. <br>  Examples of Sudden, Accidental or Traumatic Deaths <br>  Common examples of sudden deaths include: <br>  <br>  Heart attack <br>  Stroke <br>  Ruptured aneurysm <br>  Accidents - Car, train, airplane, industrial, vacation etc. <br>  Post-operative complication <br>  Anaphylactic reactions (bee stings, severe allergies) <br>  Rapidly fatal acute leukemias <br>  Sudden infant death syndrome <br>  Rapidly progressive infectious diseases - respiratory anthrax, certain pneumonias, Legionnaire's <br>  Suicide <br>  Homicide <br>  Natural disasters (Hurricane Katrina, Christmas Tsunami) <br>  Human-caused disasters (Oklahoma City Bombing, the September 11th terrorist attack or any of the recent school shootings) <br>  Each type of sudden loss, whether a heart or a terrorist attack, leaves survivors bereaved, dazed and vulnerable trying to make sense out of the insensible loss. As survivors of sudden or traumatic death begin to process the loss, they experience a grief response.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	Would you please tell me if you're an atheist, a Christian,etc.?|`|yDVlTUYTaa	Medical insurance will often cover counseling. Also most churches offer free counseling. Good for you for recognizing that you need others to talk to about this. Many people go through the grief process alone or just relying on those closest to them and it's so much harder that way. Google grief support groups to get a start. There most likely will be one in your area. Another contact to try is Hospice. Even though you didn't need to utilize their services, they can give you information on grief support in your area.<br>  I'm so sorry for your loss. Dad's are so special!|`|AA11032586	I know it is very difficult. I lost mine 2 years ago, and I still have times that are tough. One of the best things is to openly and honestly talk with your Husband. That is supposed to be your best source of assurance and confidant. I would also recommend talking to some elders in the Church or the Pastor and his wife. The Church family is an awesome source of help. I hope you the best of everything in life. Remember, you always have the Heavenly Father. He has really helped me. God Bless. Good luck.|`|yptfd3sIaa	If you have insurance there are many options, including bereavement counseling group sessions at some hospitals and medical centers. If you do not have insurance, most communities have a free or sliding scale mental health center that offers group and/or individual counseling, usually with a LCSW. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|szJzZ9myaa	When my old man died I got faced for two weeks straight, which is ironic because he was killed by a drunk driver. I guess everybody morns their loved ones in a different way, you just haven't found yours yet.|`|Fe56VaX4aa	I lost my mom very unexpectedly when i was 15 (couple of years ago). She was in her late 30's. Never imagined that i would loose her so soon. I never came to the realization that she was gone til after a year later.But,I think with everyone its different. I am just barely getting over her loss. What i did was just stayed real close with friends and family. Anytime i was upset or mad i would write, listen to music, or would be with family. There is no real solution that will take the pain away. Sometimes i wish there was! But reality is, there isn't. Stay close with your family, friends, stay busy.Crying helps. Get involved in a church, that will  be the best therapy. Stay strong! If i can get passed it, you can too.|`|WhYTUzMuaa	Look this is life,anyrhing can happen.I understand ur situation but there is nothing u can do.Just wait with the time u'll be alright.Let the moment pass.If u have sister or brother or freinds to talk that will help.But I'll say it'll take some time.It happened to me when i was just 7 or 8 and I still feel shaky when i recall when I saw him last time ,atleast u understand what happened and u r in a situation that u can balance ur life.Have some patience and be calm.This is true.Everyone of us has to face it.Remember there will be lot like you or could be worst than u.Believe in yourself,Trust yourself ,list your blessings . Acceptance leads to peace, which will help you have a better attitude about yourself and where you are going in life. Things could be better, but they could be a lot worse, too. Be grateful for what you have. Express you’re thanks to some of the people in your life who are always there when you need them.|`|M184ct7Qaa	Just know that there are other people there for you.<br>  You are not alone.<br>  Visit a church.<br>  The members are usually friendly,<br>  and they can bond with you easily.<br>  Hope this helped!|`|88f1a343b6666f44a54943a922a50329aa	it's ok to grieve. only time will help.  give it time.|`|AV2q8U2Zaa	therapist? for what
st9KHhoKaa	i would say more than 5...10...15..20 <br>  <br>  i know a friend of mine who sleeps with any guy..her excuse is "oh i cant help it" <br>  <br>  THAT IS BULLCRAP<br>  <br>  iv had self control for over a entire year!! and kissed one guy which i am saving myself for, because i think he is worth the wait. <br>  <br>  why not ask the question "HOW MANY WOMEN DOES ONE NEED TO SLEEP WITH IN A YEAR TO BE CONSIDERED A MAN WHORE" <br>  <br>  at the end of the day, why can men sleep with over 50 women and get called a legend by their friends, and girl sleeps with 2 guys and get called a slut? <br>  <br>  double standards. <br>  <br>  women and men / both need to have more self control and some morals. there are too many girls jumping into bed with guys and too many guys sleeping around with too many girls.|`|I8iKjRkBaa	If you really want to know the answer to this question, then your probably a tramp. It doesn't matter, if your a woman who has had more than 1 or 2 partners, men tend to think that. Its a double standard anyway you slice it. So don't worry about what other people think, if you don't feel like a tramp then your not.|`|H3iMSlVfaa	I'm confused... I thought a tramp was someone who doesn't have a house what does that have to do with sleeping with people?<br>  <br>  If your on about being a slut... I don't know 10 or more I would say?|`|AKl0n2Liaa	I would say that anyone that you weren't in a relationship with is too many. I believe,  too often we give ourselves up to people that do not even think about having some type of future w/ us.|`|I3mo7alVaa	Well depending on if their married or not.<br>  <br>  If your married - Better stay with one. It's not good to sleep with another til' your married. <br>  <br>  If your not married 2. You know the saying 2 -2 many right.|`|AA11116901	between 18-25 like 30<br>  26-40 12 <br>  40+ <5<br>  All based on the fact that there is no marriage in here... in which case it would be >1|`|5TJdDCREaa	If you have to ask, you've probably already slept with one too many.|`|0gSuxiQOaa	Good for her, 300 and going on 400|`|BXLCiCUlaa	anything over 1|`|g3pGZEw9aa	You're a tramp!|`|79aZQf4qaa	2|`|f31e11a2391e029bbde885d1d31c8124aa	4|`|uGezRb7Xaa	Sleep with whoever you want.

Be careful, check for STD, etc. etc. and I don't see why anyone could care. I think society needs to become more relaxed and less nosey of other people's business in general.<br>  <br>  And hey, why just women? Why aren't men considered "tramps" if they screw over multiple women in another year? Your question was only regarding women. But that's another rant I'll save for later.<br>  <br>  Let the thumb downs come.|`|TtMKPBR3aa	if you are married two is enough... if not married but with boyfriend two is still the magic number... if no boyfriend three|`|fcd41ae13b5b45292cfeda0b4cdff32baa	tramp= the number of guys you slept with this year-1 :)|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	3|`|MNyYWoFfaa	"Jasmine St.Claire boned 300 guys in one day and is still considered a virtuous woman."<br>  <br>  Your definition of "virtuous" is very different from the dictionary's<br>  <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/virtuous" rel="nofollow">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionar...</a>|`|59cnZfTeaa	its not the number but the frequency.

And everything. Especially nail polish.<br>  <br>  Okay irrelivent. Guys love individuality.. And if you meet one who doesn't.. You're out of his league.|`|lZW02mYzaa	not really im from chicago aslong as you dont leave your house in a gold thong and a pair of sun glasses im ok  you look nice and it seems to fit you so you be you and let them be them|`|dzbblpjgaa	Absolutely not - life can be grey and black and most people dress that way. You stay colourful and cheerful. Forgive those who think you are attention seeking - be yourself!<br>  <br>  I like colour but usually not so many LOL|`|s62iQmjdaa	Seriously nothing weird about what you were maybe people from your school are jealous or just have a unique eye problem but you seem normal nothing weird and cute too|`|oNHtVHzsaa	hey there is nothing wrong w/ having ur own style. guys like it. good luck and say hi to that new boyfriend ur going to have. tee hee. : )|`|GjKMUIpIaa	u seem to dress normally 2 me. btw, ther wuz only 1 person in the pic.|`|qJtPcrWTaa	cool style<br>  I like it a lot|`|I3mo7alVaa	No!<br>  <br>  If someone gets freaked then they have no fashion. However you have fashion which is great your style is kinda known where I from. I guess you can say only a jealous person would say something or be freaked. Cause obviously that would mean you showed them a fashion their either not fit for or they can't get lol I guess.<br>  <br>  Yea I'm a guy and I had some problems with what I wear sometimes cause I like my fashion too. I wore some Pink black and gray Forces to school and had some guy say I was gay for it but the shoes went along with an outfit I had. But you know what they don't have what it takes to be fashioned. So you do you and don't worry about what anyone says about your fashion cause they wouldn't have a quarter of what it takes to where what others do. <br>  <br>  Note: No I'm not gay or gay for wearing pink lol,<br>  It takes a man to wear pink...|`|st9KHhoKaa	trust me you can get away with it..paris hilton couldnt!!<br>  <br>  your very pretty and and cute and unique!! who wants to be a fake, blonde, paris hilton bimbo!!? <br>  <br>  and if a guy cant see that then he is a loser.|`|jxpa713daa	one of those outfits was a little weird<br>  had one of those animated animal things on it.... i dont know<br>  anyway thats the only outfit i kinda disliked<br>  the other two are just peachy :)|`|tOIz5WB3aa	no i would not be freaked out. I would just consider you original.<br>  Whoops im a girl. ha|`|564KtmOwaa	oh shiz no,<br>  you're abbbsssoooooooooolutely gorgeous!|`|WQ3uCllqaa	I love it!!

However Im straight like 6:00 and youre cute, looks good to me.|`|XKhNw221aa	no, you seem like an attention starved teen. nothing unique.|`|O24IOZ8Paa	nope why|`|qeeem2giaa	i think you got the wrong picture.<br>  <br>  but i found the other one, you're pretty =)
i8cFHtUzaa	obsession...?|`|jYMlAN4Paa	I think you've pretty much said it. Of course, you can give the reality of that which is something like...."I have this unnatural image of you that you get to live up to. I'm in love with it and worship it and I don't give a toss what you think or how you feel just as long as you can live up to this image of perfection."<br>  <br>  Course...this woman will never live up to your expectations. Being on a pedestal is rather lonely. Wouldn't you want her to be happy and to treat her like a human being rather than an untouchable trophy?|`|7NEbLq8gaa	1)your my everything<br>  2)If there is no you, there is no me.<br>  3)godess<br>  4)trophy wife?! (lol)<br>  5)whipped<br>  6)my sunshine<br>  <br>  What else can you say? If you make a romantic gesture then I really dont think she will care what you call her.|`|Sb93dIXbaa	Marry Her!|`|jBM7e88raa	he is whipped!
kLPaq30Eaa	Divorce, death, having a child, moving, getting a new job, etc.|`|y0JoBMk8aa	osama bin ladin finnaly gettin captured|`|pUIGCtaZaa	Well some examples are: a death in the family, a drastic move, a traumatic event taking place, getting hired for a new job, etc.|`|xhijqoBwaa	marriage. moving house. changing jobs. having children. menopause. labotomy. death|`|kmORkPuCaa	Finding out how many days you have to live...|`|h4SWtjb2aa	when sumone dies
mDBHMJPjaa	im pretty sure he does like you but he doesn't know if he's ready yet..|`|gsds3lmraa	He's calling because you haven't called him. Most guys enjoy the chase. <br>  On the other hand he may really like you and have realised that when he didn't hear from you. I think you need to have the conversation about where you stand again and if he comes out with the same bs then chuck him and then you'll know it was just the chase.|`|xEwOAjJWaa	dont stalk hes myspace... it just makes you question him... and yes guys are confusing... but i ashure you were around the same in the confussing situation.<br>  <br>  if hes just playing you around ditch hes sorry **** but dont stalker hes myspace what ever you do!.|`|fh8bQdGkaa	This might sound a little harsh... but he might just want to be friends for now. He may want to hangout with you and get to know you a bit better, and you may want to try the same. It's good to at least know the person before actually calling him or her boyfriend or girlfriend, wouldn't you agree? He may be interested in someone else, but that changes like the wind, so who cares? This kinda reminds me of the time about this girl named Kate who was creeping my facebook not too long ago and she was totally getting into my stuff, and I found out about it. It was pretty awkward. She later tried to use facebook as a means for an argument. Turns out she misconstrued this whole situation and that she's just a nutcase and I never talked to her again. I mean, just looking through it is fine, but picking it apart like that is something people shouldn't do. It's their lives, their business. If you like him that much, just hangout with him for awhile. Maybe you'll find out he's a pretty good guy, or just a complete fruit cup. Be patient and just be yourself. Don't stress about it, and just have fun with it. Who knows? Maybe he's just not ready for a girlfriend. Or possibly that he likes you so much, that he doesn't want to screw up his chances with such an awesome girl? That's what I did one time, cause I was a little nervous around her for awhile. Then I got used to her company and we dated. Some girls I used to have a crush on I never dated cause I wanted to at least have them as friends. Deep relationships can strengthen a couple's bond, but can also devastate it completely. <br>  About that phone call... He may have taken the argument a completely different way you did, so there is no common ground. That's why you have to talk to him to get it straight, and then do whatever. If you don't like him anymore, then just ignore him if you don't even want to be his friend. If you do like him, like I said, see where it takes you. Don't expect to just jump into the best relationship of your life if that's what you're thinking. Be understanding, and ask the right questions. Go with your heart. You'll know what to do sooner or later.|`|xg8kp3Pfaa	Be friends only.|`|uYJdvnqxaa	Maybe he was calling you to make sure you were still friends?Maybe since you weren't talking to him he thought you didn't want to at least be his friend anymore.
0vo7tDP5aa	you must be a typical guy. you can't understand it from a women's perspective. women find many things sexy, that you cannot comprehend. and it really makes that person SEXY in their eyes. just like you would find a girl with a toned athletic body and big boobs sexy. its the same sense of sexy. for them, the realm of physical appearance and sexiness are disconnected. for most guys they are usually connected, that's why you get confused when they are separated.|`|tZG6l1q9aa	I don't think it means like nerdy academic smart but kind of common sense-cleverness smart.|`|UUl6LsPzaa	Women don't like smart guys. They like complete idiots.
vs5rK3iRaa	Eight years is not that much of a difference.  If you were 18 and she was 10, THAT would be weird.  But if you were 60 and she was 52, you'd be almost the same age!<br>  Age is relative.|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	age doesnt matter. if thats a big deciding factor for people then they are probablly missing out on great chances for love|`|tXk0oymyaa	it's legal no harm done<br>  Though the gap is 8 year difference or so<br>  your both in school<br>  <br>  see what happens<br>  <br>  your a man now<br>  be strong<br>  she could be the one|`|HMzUeqTmaa	love is love age should have nothing to deal with it|`|rALoVUVoaa	I'm 20 and would go for men in their late twenties; there is NOTHING wrong with it at all<br>  <br>  Go for it|`|iDScOWBIaa	if her parents approve, its fine. but that ones a biggie|`|SSukoZ1Caa	its legal man. if you act like you are around her age then you two should get a long fine. you two obviously find each other attractive so it should be fine. Yes, the age difference is weird and not normal at all haha but it shouldn't really matter man. if you want her, go get her. respect what she does and doesn't want though|`|DUu7h6XSaa	no, unless you guys were like twenty years apart or something then yeah. but in so many cultures there is a lot of older men married to younger women. and besides she asked you out you should be happy! and SHES LEGAL!!! haha|`|9tbupRCuaa	It's actually cute!<br>  AGE doesnt matter man!<br>  <br>  I am 20 years old, my bf is 26.<br>  <br>  Advise: just make sure you're not gonna ruin her life.|`|kCZd7RSDaa	No|`|MVVCMj6Haa	You good ...I
aWEybdDFaa	Sweet as sugar, glassy eyes, will say the perfect things, very romantic, and depending how long you make him wait--he'll get sweaty, depress, and very anxious.|`|Xb7kaCkiaa	he casually drops the phrase<br>  "**** or gtfo"|`|J8uhpecYaa	He pretends to care about your feelings and praises how you communicate.|`|cp7fjeJhaa	he always talks about sex, and when he asks if you want to get together if you say lets go to a movie or something he says well wanna go to a motel or come to my place first, he is only interested in seeing you when he wants sex and doesn't take you other places and if he does it's just to probably get sex afterwards...........<br>  <br>  if you are asking this question, you know the guy you are talkin about just wants sex........your instincts dont lie|`|vwoqIUR6aa	he doesn't call you or ask you to do stuff. he just invites you over or himself over. once the deed is done, he leaves and doesn't want to do anything else with you besides the deed.|`|wXV5GxJHaa	what guys doesn't want just sex out of a relationship? come on now... you must be young|`|tYNnVFNpaa	just wants to get you in bed|`|0Ngi2keVaa	He only calls you at night, and ignores you if you call him during the day, or when you text him. he only talks to you if its convenient for him, and is really nice to you before or during sex, but is a jerk to you after. also you can tell if you have sex, and then in the morning when you wake up he is facing away from you or doesn't kiss you goodbye. i have to say, most guys only want sex out of a relationship.|`|8LBIeeomaa	He would remember calling you only when he has nothing better to do..and he would think that may be drinking at his place or your place is the best thing you could do..<br>  <br>  On other days he would not call/text you..He would tell you you are beautiful but would not to hang out with you..Beware of such kind..unless you are ok with casual sex with no strings attached..trust me you will feel much better if next time he askes you to come over, and you say no..rather than end up sleepign with him and fins he is gone in the morning for good...|`|c059nXPfaa	He calls you just before, at or after last call at the bar.<br>  He never hangs out with you, without looking for sex.<br>  He makes sure you know how attractive he thinks you are.<br>  He doesn't introduce you to his friends.<br>  He doesn't know much about you.<br>  <br>  Just a couple hints.|`|alAtUXvyaa	little to no affection or pda, only ever wants to hang out or go on dates if there's a good chance he'll get some afterwards.|`|6Ei4mn6naa	Well, any guy has his own way of acting, for example, my bf will give me that look which I called (wild stare) and believe me, his look turn me on Loooooooooool|`|K2QwEM4raa	Guess he just says so, but I wouldn't know because I wouldn't go out with him.|`|FeRC5jkoaa	He's always staring at your vag.|`|GTZFpbfPaa	he says:<br>  "heyyy babbby" in a weird accent.<br>  BEWARE OF THOSE KINDS!!|`|vdNbpHbsaa	It depends on your age and the age of the "man" in question.  If you're talking about a teenage male, then the answer is he acts any way to want him to act and says anything you want him to say in order to get sex.  If you are talking about a more mature relationship, then the simplistic answer is he comes on strong, wants to kiss you and caress you a lot, and doesn't want to spend much time doing anything else.  There will be no movies and no dinners at romantic restaurants (unless he is convinced that this it what it will take to achieve his objective).  Plus he won't be all that interested in just talking with you to find out what you are like.  He doesn't want the emotional baggage of a real relationship.  He just wants to get in, make some small talk (nothing serious or in-depth), get sex, and get out.|`|KYGGglowaa	Well....depends how long that person known the guy. Because if you known him for awhile, you kinda know what he's all about. But, if you dont know him all that well and/or havent know him for that long of a time, then he will come off kinda strong. Example: He may always try to go for a kiss or if he is flirting, he may make a lot of sex remarks...Hopefully he may just be blunt about it and tell you straight up. Go by your gut feeling, if you uncomfortable in your gut about being with him, then dont hang out with him or even talk with him. You'll be okay, if you listen to what your gut has to say.|`|qnqTjRZoaa	He acts like mr. perfect with a little bit of mystery.  He probably wont sleep over either. I have found that if the guy only wants sex out of the relationship and he's smart about it, he wont sleep over cause that causes the girl to get attached.  He also may seem too good to be true... if it feels that way then it probably is.  good luck!|`|bIE0PTY3aa	I honestly don't know because I've never just wanted sex out of a relationship. I've always wanted a healthy, happy relationship with plenty of cuddling (especially at night during sleep), and plenty of affection. Sex was never my #1 objective. Sorry I can't help you, I'm different from other guys, I guess. -john in rock island, illinois, QUAD CITIES, USA<br>  <br>  OMG I just read what the other girls wrote up above!!!! Are there seriously guys that are like that??? No way!!!! There is no way that they could get away with being so selfish, is there? Are you guys being for real? No way..... No way.....|`|FHxegXZAaa	There's no specific way to tell actually b/c some maybe the upfront player type and as soon as your first date is over, he'll be leading you to his bedroom...There could also be the sneaky type who will pretend to love you until you dont give it up and leaves<br>  <br>  no exact way to predict how he'll act|`|Ih4T0QpOaa	he's all attentive and nice to you before  sex... and after sex he will disappear for a while until the day that he's horny again and he'll start phoning you and be all attentive and nice again - and so the vicious cycle goes on.|`|EQJpV9S3aa	He keeps asking for the sex?

nf6aqR1Haa	I cant tell what he wants but you should think about what you want. My mother-in-law and sister-in-law are extremely childish like that and I have to deal with it for the rest of my life because we have 2 kids together. About every 6 months they do something new and I cant handle it much longer. Just remember that if you ever decided to settle down with him you would be stuck with her too!!!|`|HMzUeqTmaa	Sisters due have influence but i think he is trying to protect you from her....thats what i get out of it anyways|`|6Ei4mn6naa	Grrrrrrr. so typical.<br>  My fiancé broke up with me 2 month before wedding because of sisters and father and noticing that we been together for almost one year. <br>  So such guys are worthless

Would you really want to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't really want to be with you but is just in the realtionship because they don't want to hurt your feelings? I wouldn't. They are doing you a favor by leaving so that you can meet new people who genuinely care about you.|`|ISD5c0CMaa	+ hang out with your friends more often<br>  + keep yourself busy<br>  + think this lover was not the one and look out for all the other possibilities<br>  + start being more aware about the others<br>  + maybe if it helps just be friends<br>  + try not to see her/him that often<br>  + put whatever that reminds you of her away (but don't throw it, somewhere like the attic or something)<br>  <br>  Hope it helps.|`|0M1Ovlodaa	u get away.<br>  hang out with your friends<br>  concentrate on work and what not.<br>  go do stuff that takes your mind off of them.<br>  <br>  if u sit around home doing nothing but think of them<br>  it will take you forever.<br>  even if you're out and little things of going out remind you of themm..<br>  it will all be overr soon.|`|ZD3f6zxnaa	The first two weeks is the hardest, they say that's the crying period..let all your anger, hurt, and frustration out during those two weeks. don't be afraid to cry...once that two weeks is over than take it one day at a time.

X9XYf7Jxaa	he's actually serious about the relationship then. he likes your personality a lot and can't show it since he's a reserved person. if a guy says "i love you" then he means it, but you really gotta read him carefully...i know many jerks that are able to win over a girl and get them on their good side.|`|AA11348410	I know you're gonna hear this over and over again; but your still young. There will be lots more drama to come. I would just act casual with him. You know like yal are just good friends that dated. Most guys if you don't act like you're not interested in them will be interested in you. And if not then there will other guys who will be interested in you. Just remember to not have sex just because you want to keep a guy. That never works out well. Good luck
HzP6xg1Uaa	That is just how things are meant to be. What's important is that you never leave on an angry note. You never know when something will happen to the ones you love.
lbgoHgDkaa	no, that is not weird.  most people focus on some little detail that separates an average girl from someone that they like.|`|AA12400627	If you think it's weird, then there might be a problem....but if it is your thing, then I really don't see why it should matter....<br>  <br>  Unless you discoverer later that you found their personality lacking in one way or another?|`|PaVyuYVUaa	i really dont think thats a good reason. and i think its a weird reason.|`|hBbgjasQaa	U better know it but 1st see ur face in mirror, some one  else may reject u|`|Tu7UOK3Waa	*lust not love|`|GjKMUIpIaa	not rely, everyone likes chicks for different resons.

cllt4Alraa	honestly i think the whole freaking and grinding thing is very uncultured and says a lot about how much today's teens are brainwashed by all the gangsta music and such. When I go to dances I dont freak or grind but I will dance like a crazy person or if you just dance in a group with a few friends you should be fine.<br>  <br>  It might seem weird to not fit in with everyone around you, but if it makes you are the guy uncomfortable then dont do it.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	well when there is a slow dance you can wrap ur arms around his shoulders and his around your waist<br>  <br>  for fast songs<br>  you should move to the beat<br>  <br>  every time you hear a beat you should stop your feet lightly and just move in random motions i guess<br>  <br>  idk its kinda hard<br>  its a skill you have to develop|`|ruE1llE2aa	Its not weird. <br>  I get praised for my dancing in my group of friends, but I still don't grind....well ok I did once, but that was with four girl friends of mine, just for fun. haha. But anyway it's not weird at all, Don't worry about it. Just dance freely, or hold his hands while you dance. Thats what I do a lot. You can still look sexy or hot without grinding or freaking, trust me.|`|abOSnIrxaa	I've not freaked danced before it was so much more fun...kept our distance and did our on thang..Good Luck!
231e2f619695988a9a2770ac10966cd2aa	to get the message through to her, do it any way possible. if you know she likes you, she'll be flattered to hang out with you or be your girlfriend. so go ahead, text her!|`|JetaJF6Maa	yes ucan tell her via text message in a beautiful nd romantic way <br>  so that she could know ur feelings 4 her nd dont be so desprate be clam nd patient nd tell<br>  go on man|`|ISD5c0CMaa	Don't text her!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  But do tell her, don't you dare not to, or you might not the chance again.<br>  What are you waiting for? Her birthday?<br>  Make some time, call her/text her/IM her and ask her when she's free.<br>  Then make some time for that particular time and ask her to meet you somewhere like a cafe or something.<br>  All the best!|`|dHF0l6bLaa	dude just straight up tell her eh, its a risk and life is full of them and if u never tell her how u feel u will always live on in life wondering "if she was the one"<br>  <br>  so just tell her, at least u and her will both know|`|sxJgu3C9aa	Write to her and, when you both have time, meet and tell her again, eye to eye what you feel for her.|`|hQ4UCs2gaa	We think written communications are great but if you likeher back, she would probably like it more if you called her or talked to her in person about it. luv. lauren and shelby|`|i2jmNDQZaa	You could do it in a text but be careful and not read something into the answer that isn't there. It is hard to hear the tone of voice in a text. Why can't you call her? I would rather get an email from someone who wants to tell me something like that. At least there's enough room for explaination and then I could answer in the same fashion.<br>  <br>  I love texting, but i think it should be kept to the small conversations and not the important ones.|`|b0ItZsXZaa	i would tell you to ask her to lunch and talk to her that way you can read her body language and show in person that you are very interested.don't just come out and say it rather you could try to coax how she is feeling. with this you will know how to drop the bomb shell... and remember it helps when you are confident!!!|`|T9OroHEJaa	aww..texting seems like an okayish idea but the best thing to do will probably be to tell her in person, but u can start off by giving her little hints that you have thing for her, which you can do through txts and this will probably make it easier to say it in person also..goodluck:D|`|RByBNfsNaa	you like her right! so i think it's romantic if you will tell her in person..<br>  And find time that she's not busy!|`|hPiFktZ7aa	do it text her or anything... girl always wait for boy to ask...|`|0ZVAZ1R7aa	You answered your own question by saying that you know she likes you.  So then what are you waiting for if you dont tell her then someone else will snatch her interest and you will be sayin your shoulda, coulda's lol i mean really its not abnormal situation.  This is a daily kinda thing that men and woman face allllll the time so go for it and dont give up or second guess your actions all the time or you will never get what you want!!! or maybe you are not sure why you like her but honestly when you get it off your chest you will see the bond will probably start to get tighter...good luck and all that!! <br>  <br>  by the way; no man has ever gotten me by not letting me know whats on his mind!! got to be a go getter to get the ones you want!!

LOL!!<br>  <br>  Seriously though; there are quite a lot of us here. We all are as different as people are all over the world and it seems odd that you would seek a partner based on an accent.

aOUjMhUmaa	Take it from me, I've been married for 1.6 years... you need to get it out of your head as quickly as possible that your woman is a dude. A lot of frustration comes from assuming your woman thinks like a dude, but SHE DOESN'T.<br>  I've graduated from college, and all during my undergraduate time, they tried to convince us that men and women are the same. THAT IS BOGUS BS, DON'T BELIEVE IT.<br>  You will be a lot happier if you start accepting her methods as female methods, as ways, however ineffective at conveying their true meaning, they she has been encultured to do.<br>  Act like you are communicating with a person from a different culture... or different planet to be safe.<br>  You wouldn't yell at a Korean and tell them they are stupid for them spraying water all over the bathroom... Korean bathrooms have a drain in the floor and everything is meant to get wet--they don't have open electrical outlets in there...<br>  So have some understanding.<br>  <br>  <br>  BUT, if you really don't like the guess work, then be straight with her. You're not the only one who has to learn how the other person works. You should ask her, "Honey, I know you want me to always respond to comments about the dishes with, 'Oh honey, don't worry, I'll do them', but the fact is, sometimes I won't think it's very serious and let you do them. If you want me to do them, ASK, and I will ALWAYS do it, rather than you choosing to do them and brooding about it for 24 hours."<br>  <br>  That's my advice to you. You are not the same, you need to bridge the gap if you want to communicate effectively.|`|XmxN58XCaa	oh man, careful where that leads too.|`|LmFGYK7laa	hahaha this is so random but i get yelled at by my mom for the same thing =) and its probably because she was asking u to do the dishes but said it in a way to make it seem like she's not asking u ... and then when u didn't get up and do them she got upset|`|hE9HDEJWaa	Dear Math Geek:<br>  <br>  as a girl, I can give you insight into the weird and often twisted thoughts of women. You see my friend, when a girl says "yes", she really means "no", and when a girl says "It's ok, I'll do the dishes", what she *really* wants is for you to insist further on doing them because it's a silly girl thing many girls do. <br>  I think it has to do with romanticism. It's the idea that the man will go "out of his way" to make his lady comfortable. Just tell her next time to be up-front :)|`|91a2b9fe0d0ef5781c3a0beca8dcdd82aa	wow, you are thick. she did want you to do the dishes. but she wasnt going to say "i want you to do the dishes". so she hinted for you to do them. then put up the little "fight" to show she isnt pushy. at the very least, she wanted you to help.<br>  the thing is, if a woman is suggesting something, its what she wants, whether its going somewhere, buying something or doing something. so listen to her and think about what she says.|`|HMzUeqTmaa	Dude my ansswer to life...women are just bi-polar|`|j0G4Zz0Yaa	she wants to think that you really care about helping her out and stuff and not that you only do something when she hints at it...that you could think of helping her on your own<br>  <br>  by persisting it would have showed that you really WANTD to help her out not that you suggested it just bcuz it sounds good or you wantd somethign in return|`|lq0JNwK7aa	Yeah, we can be confusing like that sometimes.<br>  <br>  Usually though, it's because there is some underlying problem/concern she has in her mind. In short, the dishes were symbolism for a different problem.<br>  <br>  Talk to her about it and see if that helps.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA12117694	lol:)...typical woman man..they want you to take the hint the first time..but it usually flys over us and they sometimes just like to be angry for no reason LOL. I know one thing to not say..never tell her or ask her if it is her time of the month or your ears will be ringing LOL.|`|F4IbdT2vaa	You should have responded with, "You wash, I'll dry." That way it's a compromise, she'll love to see that you are willing to meet her halfway. She'll feel that you are understanding and that your communication is good. Most importantly, it will keep you out of the dog house.|`|DvwJmahvaa	well, duh<br>  <br>  why is would she mention the dirty dishes to you is she didnt want you to do them?<br>  <br>  why would she mention them to you at all if she wanted to do them herself?<br>  <br>  silly|`|ylHrqNvkaa	lol girls are like that<br>  they want u to chase them
hdnI8ARiaa	yea|`|UVwRSpDjaa	Sweetie it happens when your in school. Girls are mean sometimes. Just be you and you'll have a great life.

That's life and it is good to see that you both overcame your differences and became friends again.<br>  <br>  The other friend however most likely feels betrayed. They defended you and put effort into sticking up for you just to have you be friends with that person again. Maybe they fear of their time with you may be limited because they don't want to interact with that girl now also. This person should be happy that you made up with a friend. However emotion more often than not clouds judgment. <br>  <br>  But I have to say, if you are afraid this person may physically harm you, they are not someone you want to be friends with anyways.|`|xW5g6iIxaa	I think I know how your friend must feel. All those months you and her have spent together made her feel like your best friend and finding out that you got back with your best friend, she probably thinks you and her would lose that friendship.<br>  You didn't really do anything wrong, lots of people experience this. Of course if you had a choice, you wouldn't want to continue fighting with your best friend. She should actually try to be happy for you.<br>  You confront her and tell her what you really think and give her a chance to speak as well.|`|6OIm5pz6aa	Your friend wont hurt you. You NEED to call her and explain things otherwise you'll keep worrying like this.<br>  Its not a stupid reason, because your friend thought you guys connected and grew closer through the whole thing so she probably thinks now that your friends with your old friend, you'll grow apart from her, even though you hated her before.<br>  Just trust me, call her, explain things to her, and see how it goes.|`|AA11976779	you should be aloud to have more than one friend... try to explain that to your friend and if she doesn't understand ,give her time even you said it can take a while... if your really scared for your safety tell a parent or someone you trust... it will be ok in the end don't worry|`|Yf2xwDOlaa	LOL, you know you messed up, that girl stood up for you and tried to protect you and took your side and now she feels like you said f off to her when she was loyal too you. Yea my advice, transfer?|`|kKid6i9aaa	easy if she threatens you call the police and no you didnt do anything wrong she is just jealous that you have another friend now
lFFhcoXZaa	Starting conversations is easy.<br>  To insure you can hold up your end, have a few things listed on a sheet of paper that are related to the subject. Of course knowing the subject matter plays a big part. Don't just go off on something you aren't familiar with, (unless you are trying to show your boyfriend that he is very knowledgeable in a subject you need help with - if you get my drift).<br>  Example: Sports. If it's about baseball, what is your favorite team doing to give themselves a competitive edge this season?<br>  Any new players? Lose any to arbitration? Are any hurt? A new manager?<br>  Pick a subject and research it. If you are going to get in the middle of something be prepared. <br>  Good luck.<br>  .
NGz7R9enaa	Pick yourself up and dust off. Don't let him get to you like this, you have a little one that needs you more than anything else. You may love him, I think that is completely normal. I still love a few of my ex's, however I don't want to be with them because I know that it just didn't work out. <br>  <br>  It sounds like he is really angry or that he is just an a** and you deserve better any way you look at it. *hugs*

HKkbqlIuaa	Because mother's are protective of their sons. In a sense, whenever you marry the son, it's sort of like you're their new "care taker." Generally, mom's don't like this because they want to take care of their baby boy forever. It's rather annoying if you ask me. Mother's always think they know what's best for their son, even if it's not what he wants. Of course, no one is ever going to be good enough, especially not the woman he actually chooses. Lol, but don't worry. I don't get along with my mother-in-law either, well we get along, but it's VERY difficult. Lol, well good luck. If you come up with any secrets to make it easier, please let me know!!|`|yptfd3sIaa	Pardon me as I delve into a little gender politics, but here it goes: <br>  We, as a society, have very specific ideas about how men and women relate to one another. <br>  <br>  A young woman getting married might have parents convincing themselves that she is in love with his personality, or his stability, or any other number of things besides his sexiness. The marrying son, however, is presumed to have prioritized his new bride's LOOKS above all else, which means (ew) his mother could be a little jealous. Which is crazy. And gross.<br>  <br>  Of course this is all ridiculous, because not all men marry for looks (or looks alone), and certainly there are women who prioritize his attractiveness over earnings ability.|`|WhYTUzMuaa	i think thats bit reasonabel.as we i mean daughter in laws take away their life time precious thing(their son) and they feel possessive about it.i can imagine now since i had my son,he is only 2 and i feell i should be the only one for ,for all his love and care but its not easy when he will have someone so special for him when he start caring more than me.i know its nature but i think that could be for every one and specially mums.just be patient and try to loo other side of the picture it might not be being bossy or jealous its just the love and possessiveness for their child.i know we big we understand but feelings not very easy to change.

I've had to leave classrooms many times discussing things about the class with much younger people than myself.

bL9APqogaa	Always stay with the children! Sometimes they can get into big trouble! When your parents aren't there, make sure you know their cell phone numbers or the numbers where they will be at. Know where you live just incase you need to call someone (like 911). Ask things like what can they eat? What time is their bedtime? What activities do they usually do? Can I take them outside? How can I discipline them if they are bad? Things like that! <br>  I know how you feel! I felt the same way when I first babsat! Have fun!

And he doesn't know what to do about her, because the chances are she's exerting emotional blackmail on him.<br>  <br>  Get her number off the phone. Tell your Dad what you found, and suggest that he go to the police.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	Well, first get your dad off alone and ask him if something is going on since he's been acting werid lately, like he's having an affair or something.  Then kind of jokingly say "if you're going to screw around, at least make sure you wear a condom so you don't bring any more babies into this world, you know mom would sue for divorce and take all your money, and I'd probably never get to see you anymore.." and whatever other things you can think of as reasons you don't want him to get divorced from your mom.  Say it in a the same manner your dad would be telling you that when you do have sex, wear a condom and all that father-son talk stuff.  It'll put him on alert because if you can sense something is going on, maybe he needs to straighten out his life a little more.  Don't tell him you read his cell phone.  And don't tell your mom.  Just make a joke out of the way he's been acting lately like a guy would if he was having an extra-marital affair and what the consequence may be if it is true.|`|7fa275a0b219d341645d003c4f5add6baa	If you confronted him about it then he would know you looked at his phone and he would be pissed about that.<br>  This is a tricky one !!!!

But this will not be pretty. I'm sorry for what your father will put you and your mother through.|`|SK5wHr5zaa	You shouldn't have peeped at your Dad's phone messages, most devious and sneaky of you. Whilst this situation is upsetting for you no good will come of telling your Mum as what is happening will continue to happen and make the possibility of a reconciliation between them much more difficult. Give the affair a chance to petter out on its own and if it does then what your Mum didn't know won't hurt her.You came by the information by foul means now have the maturity to be discreet and keep quiet. If you haven't already done so, don't tell anyone. Please permit me to say that your action of looking at your Dad's private phone messages brings your own moral standards into question and I would suggest you have a look at yourself before you start judgeing others. I know there is no comparison between the two immoral acts but the two actions are dishonest.|`|9a7b9b80f412db25e4cb8d6d8786a735aa	Hi, What a terrible burden for you to have to "carry", Both my children suspected their dad was having an affair, (and so did i but i didn't want to tell them) he was nasty to us all, his character changed, so after a while my children sat me down and told me of their suspicions i didn't go accusing him i just bided my time and gained all the evidence i needed, then i struck. He left us to go and live with his girlfriend. Don't keep this information to yourself you should not have to go through this alone, it's not fair on you. Also don't go telling everyone, just have a quiet word with your mum, tell her what you have seen, tell her you know it was wrong that you looked into your dad's phone but you were being nosey, Also tell your mum to just keep calm and gain information. I made the mistake the first time of "going in feet first" but time and patience pay.  Good Luck it is not going to be a good time for your family. (your mum most probably has an idea that he is cheating)|`|HNUiDK8Daa	Bring it up with your mum, she really needs to know. This happened with our family, and my sister told our mum, but she didn't believe her at all, but you have proof, forward it to your phone or your mums phone? I know if your family broke you'd probably feel responsible for it , but if you was in your mum shoes, wouldn't you want to know rather than going on living with your dad whilst he's with some other women?

The major cause of bad breath is not the teeth but the top of the tongue.  Look for some "white stuff" on the top of your tongue, especially in the back of the tongue.  This is the bacteria and must be removed to cure bad breath.  Also, most people can not smell their own bad breath.  Good oral hygiene is to brush and floss the teeth and then clean the tongue.

I understand you want answers, but just forget it. over time you will get over it and hate yourself for even writing that note. Why do you want to give him that joy?
8FbOtXAXaa	I think that you might just be afraid of losing him and so you constantly have this fear that he really doesn't love you and so the thought just keeps swirling in your head until it drives you nuts and you ask him, and then he gets upset when you ask him. The reason why he is getting upset with you is because he feels like you don't trust him when in fact he probably is a trustworthy guy. I have been down this road before so don't worry this happens to a lot of people. It's almost like you have to keep asking him just to make sure even though you know he will be upset about it but you can't help it. I think it might also have to do with some insecurities.Sorry if that sounds harsh but that is just how I see it. I think you two can be together but it just sounds like you are letting your insecurities get in the way. You can be happy forever! You just need to find a way to deal with the insecurities. Really dig deep into to what you feel insecure about and then try to find a way to resolve this. Best of luck to you!|`|hBbgjasQaa	Be bold , ask her directly|`|w5kQ98Fxaa	1. You read too many romance novels. Rest your heart in a safe harbour? 'Feel more secure' would be fine. And make your question less difficult to read. <br>  <br>  2. If he's said 'I love you' already, whenever you want to find out if he still loves you, just say it to him and he'll either say it back or he won't. Don't do this 10000000 times per day. Oh my god I am re-reading your question and you say heart so many times I'm getting distracted and thinking about open-heart surgery.<br>  <br>  Okay focus. Right. If you've been together a while and you think he might want to marry you.. Why don't you propose to him? Get him a nice watch and do it over dinner somewhere. If you've not been together long and you're just looking for security, I worry for you. You've obviously got a lot on your mind and I think it would be healthy for you to find something to rely on so you don't need a boyfriend of a few weeks/months to be your rock. Maybe a friend could be your focus. Or you could take up sailing or surfing or writing short-stories or volunteering or some other hobby or task that can be what makes you feel good about yourself so you don't have to rely on men to do that, because they won't, can't and shouldn't have to be the one holding you up.<br>  <br>  I don't understand the last part of your question. Do you mean you won't feel happy forever if you marry him or you won't be happy if you don't? If it's the first.. Don't marry him. You'll find the right guy someday. If it's the second, either propose or really work on making the relationship a strong one so you can see marriage somewhere in your future. <br>  <br>  I think if you're this worried about all of this, you should sit him down and tell him that you're feeling insecure right now and it's completely not his fault, it's all probably just in your head but you might need him to be more affectionate/verbal about his affection than usual for a while. Sitting down and having a grown up conversation about how you feel (and how he feels about that) is a great way to open up dialogue.<br>  <br>  Don't hide stuff from him - you can't build a marriage (if that's what you want with him) on secrets.|`|pqpiFyT0aa	communication is esential in a relationship. so yes you should at least bring up what you feel. if he gets upset tell him that he hasnt done anything to make you question him but you just want to know that his love is genuine and for real so yes bring it up|`|iiMQhey6aa	dont ask himmm = = makes you sound desperate and clingy<br>  however the next time he says he loves you<br>  compliment him and say you like that<br>  hopefully he'll say it more often to satisfy you|`|ooXzW8Hdaa	tell him a bit about your feelings, if it's positive, continue, but don't say too much.<br>  try to keep romantic<br>  <br>  plz answer mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220231651AAZBgIH">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|C7Ehw7Kdaa	I think you express a common concern. I've had the same problem. I guess it really depends on how long you guys have been dating. If its just been a couple months, I don't think it should be so much your priorty if he "loves" you yet since he's still getting to know you. <br>  <br>  Also, he IMPLIED that he loved you when he asked whether he did something wrong to make you think that he didn't love you. <br>  <br>  And we have to remember, happiness isn't always the ultimate goal. Relationships are not always happy because relationships are never perfect. We have to accept that we are not always going to be happy all the time in a said relationship. We have to accept the high and lows that come with the waves. <br>  <br>  But if you have doubts about this man for other reasons, or if you feel now you are trying to pick things to find fault about him to dump him, my advice would be to write a list. Write a list of reasons why you like him, then write a list of reasons why you don't. Then compare them. Weigh your reasons.

0DIHY37daa	Are you upset with her? Is there a lot of stress in your life? When something is bothering us, it can be hard to communicate well. I am sure your mom doesn't think you are an idiot. Maybe you need some way to expres yourself, like an outlet. Maybe a journal?
2O0dabMjaa	I found this  online and posted the link at the bottom:<br>  <br>  "In most states, if a person is named as the father on a child’s birth certificate, he is the legal father for all purposes. The presumption of paternity in this situation is very strong, and if the man named on the birth certificate wishes to assert his father’s rights and challenge his legal status to the child, he should do so as soon as possible."<br>  <br>  Yours is the opposite  of the above, your husband is not her biological father but he is on the birth certificate so he is her legal father for all purposes. You  ex was convicted of domestic violence which may affect his chances of visitation and deprive him of custody.  He is her biological father but under the circumstances,  if your state's laws are favorable the fact your  husband is named as her father make your ex  a non-issue.   Check your state's laws.   <br>  <br>  You made the right decision to protect yourself and your daughter who has found the father a child deserves.  That is not one who is violent to any woman, least of all one who is carrying his child.   Abusers do not  reform in prison and you have  the  right to feel fearful, to not want him near your daughter. <br>  <br>  You put your best interest and well-being as well as your daughter's first and that was the ONLY decision.  Contact local law authorities and ask them what that might mean to you when he's out what take precautions and know what your legal rights are.  State laws vary but victims have rights and notification is one of them.  I wish you well!|`|7yUoLRDyaa	Okay, I say i understand that he was abusive to you. That means that you and him have problems but the child has a right to know who his/her father is. And so does the babies Father. I mean he is the father of the child. He may not have been there because of you guys problems but it doesnt change the fact that it is His child. I mean I think you made the right decision if he use to be abusive, you had to handle your problems too. But i mean Im sure he is not going to get full custody of a child that you have been talking care of for the last years but he does have a right to spend time with the baby just as much as the baby has a right to spend time with its dad|`|aeLyiRczaa	Boo hoo for you and what you want.  You wanted to have sex with this guy and you did, right?   Seems that is what you think of most of all, does it not?  What you want.  Look, you made a kid with this guy.  He is as much her Dad as you are her Mom.  Deal with that.  Why should you get to make a mistake and then be in control anymore then he is?  He messed up as you did.  And he is her parent as you are.  Get over it.  I am tired of you women thinking you should get to use kids as hostages, leverage, pawns or extortion notes.  I am also tired of seeing you women act as if you know best or have some special rights simply because you have a vagina.<br>  <br>  If the guy does something to the kid or to you, then you have a case in my view.  Otherwise, hush, let he and her see one another and stop with your nonsense of trying to act like you are any better then he is or more fit then he is.|`|5af8PNwxaa	My only suggestion would be to seek profession legal advice.<br>  <br>  If you don't believe me, if he wants to be a hands on dad and he can prove he is the child's father, he will find a way to get either partial or permanent custody.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|fyKFnxCnaa	If you are in the United States, it would be a cold day in hell before he got your daughter.<br>  <br>  You think a felon is going to be able to take your child away?<br>  <br>  Uh, no....<br>  <br>  Most he might be able to fight for is visitation.<br>  <br>  But being the loser he is, I really doubt he is going to fight for it.<br>  <br>  It would be a lot of money and time.<br>  <br>  In order for a man to take a child from a woman, he would have to prove her as unfit. Which I am hoping you are not.  However, for a felon to actually get custody - I am not even sure that is possible.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it sis.  See if you can re-register for a restraining order.<br>  <br>  And don't let him know where you work and/or live!|`|nBQeSu2faa	The fact your ex has a record against him for abuse, would not help him in any way to take your daughter away from you...so don't worry about that end of things.  Its a different matter altogether with regard to him being in his daughters life. He has the right to be in her life and she has a right to have him in her life. All of this can be arranged in the courts, and with the help of a good lawyer  it wont become a big issue. I understand why you don't want him in her life but in the end he is still her father ,he does have rights to see her. If you stop him from seeing her or make things very difficult for him... I think you are going to have a lot more problems than you are having right now . Your daughter will resent you for not allowing her to have contact with her  father .   As your daughter gets older she will make up her own mind about her father, but if you stop her seeing him ..she will resent you for it and you could end up with much bigger problems .|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	Just hire a good lawyer. Keep the creep away from your child.|`|IA5uBGFkaa	If you have fears about him seeing her and taking off with her than you need to make your fears known to family court and that you would like to have him only be able to have supervised visitations because of the abuse and the things that you are hearing and fear he might take off with her <br>  and he may just be blowing smoke and there would be a lot of other stuff such as a paternity test ect...Most abusers won't go through all the court stuff they just want to still have some power or control over you with fear.|`|p8RvGtNYaa	It is too early to jump to any conclusion that your daughter will be taken away.  But the biological father has the right to see his child unless you can prove why not.<br>  <br>  Unless you have proof that the guy remains abusive, you are just agonizing yourself to fight it for naught.  It is part of the price you pay for past actions.|`|ml2FDYECaa	Ignore the jackass' who respond to this question. You did the right thing for your life, and your child which is more important...good luck as the legal system here in the US sucks. Trying to get custody of my son when drugs, and trafficking was involved didn't help me much. Good luck, and God bless.|`|BbRewQjQaa	Yes you did the right thing don't worry about him for him to get any parental rights he is going to have to come out of pocket for an DNA test also since he is not on the birth certificate it will have to be court ordered.
FKR45WLPaa	I think that you did.  I have a friend that was in that situation.  Her ex came around after almost nine years.  She allowed him supervised visits, but didn't tell her son who the guy was, just that he was a friend.  He ended up back in jail on domestic abuse.  If he can't come around for another two years, he may lose interest anyway.  If he wants to be in your daughter's life after that, check to see if you can prevent it if he hasn't paid any child support.  Also, with your husband's name on the birth certificate, he will have to prove that he is actually the biological father.  I don't think that he really has a chance of taking her away.  Worst case scenario seems like supervised visits.  I know that would still suck, I would be sick too.  Good luck, maybe he will just end up in trouble with the law again.  Most of them do.|`|bYU77eteaa	Go to court...the ball is in your hands<br>  He was abusive and therefore almost forfeits his rights as a father. <br>  If they choose between a happy home with a momma and a daddy and an abusive sperm donor...who you think they are gonna choose?<br>  <br>  P.S. People CAN change...but at this moment, you need to be sure that it's best for your daughter.  He might not have changed and so before you go handing over your daughter, you have the right to be skeptical|`|uiGVViTJaa	yah put up a good fight, lassie|`|AA11809403	leaving the abuser was a GREAT idea. best for you, best for your child.<br>  <br>  i  understand you are scared about this.  could you get one of the safety electronic trackers for children? so if ( God forbid) your daughter is taken, she can be found fast, easily.|`|0fcwsv7Vaa	Why do you think leaving an abusive relationship was a bad idea. You did everything right. he just a jackass.|`|6Ei4mn6naa	hard 2 say but your ex isnt capable and abusive, so I assume you did the right call and acted like real mom. If he comes around, report to police|`|oqh9KThCaa	he needs to prove that he will be a GOOD father. and u could let him have supervised visits.. but u did make a good decision in leaveing him|`|QI36SaLhaa	You did a good thing by leaving him come on if he abused you that meant he didn't care about you so you shouldn't care either which seems like you don't nd that's good now if he asks for your daughter just take him to court and remind them about the abuse he might say after two years he realize that his daughter is all he got but you could say if you wasn't a bad person you would of never stoped seeing her good luck|`|AAsWf3h6aa	Cant u get a longer restraining order on him?he should move on because u did and more over he should give u your respect and privacy.U definitely didnt do the wrong decision...just dont give up on your daughter especially when she's safe with you.|`|GO46i2l9aa	You did the right decision, but the likely hood that he will actually come close to having any custody of her is slim to none. I doubt they would put your daughter with someone who has an abusive past.|`|VZFEB85Iaa	Just get a restraining order from him forever.  He doesn't deserve the child.  You went through the pain.|`|ERCxeKhtaa	DON'T LET YOUR EX NEAR HER.<br>  you made the right decision. really you did.|`|se0NiMTVaa	go to court im sure you'll win full custody<br>  <br>  good luck sweety|`|7e3okUZXaa	maybe you should meet with him and see for yourself if he has changed, people can change. check his status with the courts to make sure he has followed all that was required of him to be "finished" with his 2 year program. honestly if hes one of the few that do change, then you need to give him a chance to prove himself, your child deserves the chance to get to know her biological father, you may regret it later if you try and control this situation selfishly, meaning that you need to think of everyone involved and what they would want.  I know its hard but you really need to meet with the ex and talk like the adults you are and work out this situation before it gets ugly.                 good luck|`|KYLWhNeNaa	I think if you think her father is dangerous it would be a good decision to keep her away from him. Your child's safety is more important than him "wanting to be a dad" if you understand sorry if I seemed rude was not trying to be XD|`|iBhjLiC9aa	get another restraining order<br>  but everyones right people do change|`|phLDxPzLaa	PEOPLE CAN CHANGE I BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD GIVE HER BOTH NAMES BUT HER DADS NAME SHOULD BE HER LAST
231e2f619695988a9a2770ac10966cd2aa	its his way of asking if you see him in your future.|`|uiGVViTJaa	UHHH.. POOP|`|HKkbqlIuaa	I don't understand the last part of your question. However, more than likely, if a man asks this, he is taking the relationship relatively seriously. He is trying to see if you guys want the same things in life, or if your lives are going to end up turning in different directions. It sounds like he wants to take the relationship to the next level. Good luck with everything.|`|O1MITmaGaa	note: your question wasn't great communication, in very poor form. I can barely make out what you're trying to say.<br>  <br>  1. he's asking what you want in life. aka, do you want a successful job career, kids, a big farm, a long, healthy life, a rich life...I know it's open ended and ambiguous, but what you do want most of all in life? what'll make you most happy?<br>  2. "why is man not [committed] to a woman?" - what? I don't get it. are you jumping to a conclusion here? a man can be committed to a woman. it's just as possible for a woman to be committed to a man. don't discriminate based on gender. both males and females have the ability to be dishonest.|`|phLDxPzLaa	I BELIEVE THAT HE IS ASKING YOU WHAT YOU WANT IN LIFE TO COMPARE HIS WANTS AND LIKES WITH YOURES ALSO HE COULD BE SEEING IF YOU FIT IN HIS FUTURE ALSO I BELIEVE THAT A MAN CAN BE COMMITTED IF THE WOMEN IS STRONG ENOUGH TO COMMITT ALSO  LISTEN IT TAKES TWO SO WHEN YOU ARE ASKED THOSE TYPE OF QUESTIONS EXPRESS TRUE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT DONT JUST MAKE SOMTHING UP THAT WAY WHEN HE TELL YOU HIS WANTS YOU WILL KNOW IF HE IS RIGHT FOR YOU ALSO SOOOOOOOOOOOO WITH THAT I WISH YOU GOOD LUCK MY DEAR...................SMILE|`|MVVCMj6Haa	He wants to know were head at...so he's not wasting his time
AA11969451	You are in tune with one another...it is common in many couples. My husband and I can finish each others sentences and will start conversations in the middle.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Oh girl...it is called being "in love".  And that is a gift because too few people ever get to experience being "in love".  And I know what you mean.  Every time my man speaks his voice resonates within my soul and it strikes a cord in me that makes me ache for him.  We are connected soul to soul, even when we make love.  Deep, everlasting love can't be "explained".  If it could be, maybe more people would wait on the right person and their relationships would last a lifetime.  No one should ever settle.  And that seems to be all our society does anymore.  It is sad.  But you and your fiance' should celebrate what you have and cherish it!|`|I2gs5opxaa	yess its like having a soul mate its why you can shere tell how the others feeling allso your on the same page.  having  a soul mate is way more that being in love its forever as well because of way you both feel so its talk feel shere lisin let things just grow youll see .

Be patient and let things develop as they will.|`|B7idbFNVaa	Yeah, he does sound obsessed by YOU.  If he stare at you for more than 12 seconds then it is out of the comfort zone.

Question is: Are you willing to try?|`|ZrrGygBPaa	i'm 30 asian and he's 38 cascausian.<br>  <br>  It sure does look awkward when we walked together and it invites lots of unwanted attention.<br>  <br>  We do like each other.<br>  <br>  I did ever ask him did he mind all the unwanted attention, he said no.<br>  <br>  sadly, i do minded but i'm trying to overcome the barriers.<br>  <br>  AGE IS JUST A NUMBER WHEN COME TO LOVE BUT DEPEND ON WHICH COUNTRY U STAY IN AND THEIR MIND MENTALITY.<br>  <br>  AS LONG AS BOTH PARTIES LIKE EACH OTHER, DON CARE ABT OTHERS !|`|FJbdpGfVaa	It is a very large age gap but if you truely love each other then it shouldnt matter as long as you dont listen to what other people think and you're happy.

The problem is, different women do it different ways.  Some have a small mouth or a sensitive throat, and that takes away from the man's experience.  Personally, many times, I enjoy head more than sex... It's very erotic and it turns me on.|`|QKM3NLmaaa	feels great, but you gotta use your tongue, and watch out for teeth. you don't want to scrape them along his *****. that's more painful than it's pleasurable. just make sure you're sliding it in and out of your mouth at a good rate, and that should be fine. that alone is an awesome orgasm, id say.|`|gWu693giaa	As long as the girl knows what she is doing there is nothing better for a guy.

I have no idea. Just tell him how it really is, of course he's not going to like it. But it's reality. You don't want to be unhappy for the rest of your life, and you don't deserve it. Lack of communication between you two could be your biggest problem... but idk.<br>  <br>  Break it off with guy #1 and give guy #2 a chance. Hopefully you've learned not to rush into things so quickly though.|`|I8iKjRkBaa	Sounds to me like you know exactly what you want, you know that Guy#1 isn't all that he's cracked up to be. Your missing Guy#2 because he made you feel different about yourself and it was new and exciting. I say, your young, you should be able to date and do what you want, your in your twenties. You should be living life instead of worrying about marriage. Take your time, I promise you will be a completely different person with different opinions in only 5 or 6 years. You have the rest of your life to be tied down to someone, but for right now, live it up, make your twenties something you look back on and smile.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	well you sound confused. id say dont ever get married again and be single.|`|O24IOZ8Paa	you are a big waste of time and you dont put # on your guys or prospects yea 22 old and you cant play anyone elese here you go find another place too cry your problems out  i dint think this is the place to wonder about w/ # youll pick and no one cares oh you want a date well w/ ya look like ? have $  i bet you got nada like me xxoo haah good luck  ROC..

But I take it as a compliment because I wouldn't want to be like every body else.<br>  <br>  Anyways, don't let it get to you, if you feel you're a good person, because they're the people that will always be unhappy because they can't accept anything outside the little 'comfort box' they put up around themselves.|`|lBKfmRWCaa	Sounds like these people are jealous. Spreading rumours and calling you names is them trying to bring you down.<br>  <br>  People often make judgments on others without knowing them, we all do it. They see you as confident, hate that about you and are trying to dent your confidence - probably because they have none or very little. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, there are people like that all throughout life. Ignore them as hard as it is sometimes.

The best thing to do in these situations is to not even acknowledge them and don't even give them a chance to talk to you or your friend. Ignore them as much as possible and treat them like the immature brats that they are. Eventually it will stop being fun for them and they will quit.|`|Du8QhOmaaa	haha children. lol<br>  eh just punch her that ought to do it. lol

XJ2BW5p7aa	A married woman will always think she is right. No matter what the subject is. And she will also always find a way to make you the one at fault. That is just how it goes. <br>  <br>  There are a lot of women that are actually willing all the time if the guy they're with is "that" guy, if you know what I mean. <br>  <br>  Others are simply realizing that while the guy is nice and good for them he is not "that" guy.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	I apologize for all the women who are so unhappy in their marriages that they don't appreciate the sanctity of their marriages.  I don't think, even they, understand marriage and sex.  According to the Bible, women set the tone for the home and the bedroom.  And I agree, that most women, once married, change from be sensual and giving, to withdrawing and witholding sex from their husbands.  There are many reasons.  One is, some women use sex as a tool to get a man to fall in love with them because they are too insecure with themselves to gain a man based on their own merit and what they have to offer.  <br>  Secondly, some women actually love sex with their husband before and during the beginning of their marriage, but grow more in love and are connecting on an emotional level instead of a sexual level.  But that doesn't mean total withdrawal of sex.  <br>  But when a woman cheats, no matter the reason, she is looking for someone or something to fulfill her that she lacks in herself.  And that is usually self confidence.  A person needs to love him/herself to obtain security in who he/she is and not use someone else to "find" him/herself.  And some women cheat because they are too lazy to work at their marriage.  All relationships, no matter what kind, take sacrifice and work.  And no one should run away into someone else's arms to escape him/herself.|`|IA5uBGFkaa	If both people respect their own body and each others there wouldn't be this debate. They would have great sex and there would not be double standards.|`|p8RvGtNYaa	Who ever told you women use the same logic?  They are wired for emotions (from Venus).  Men are wired for logic (from Mars).|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	I think you're taking too many examples and trying to merge them into one unfounded theory. It's also very easy to allow oneself to become misdirected, waiting for cues from women who are waiting for cues from you. It all becomes so irrational and paradoxical and you're going to convince yourself that every woman on the planet is nothing more than a bundle of mass confusion, waiting for them to give cues, while they are waiting for you to give cues.<br>  <br>  How ever did mankind evolve with all of this mass confusion?<br>  <br>  Be true to yourself, set your own goals, and don't worry about women.<br>  <br>  And as you are doing this, try to imagine what life would be like without them? What would life be like without that one, special one, the one who makes you dizzy just looking at her... the one who makes your heart sing, the one who makes your world go around.<br>  <br>  Oh, haven't you met 'her' yet? You will ;-) Then you'll really be in trouble.|`|IvMPh09baa	i think its being you stink, actually.<br>  <br>  i find it hard to believe you get any standard from women, let alone a double.|`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	You have to remember that most of the people that post here are the unhappy ones... happy people do not turn to a computer or strangers for advice.<br>  <br>  One of the main differences between men and women is that men think marriage is going to be 24-7 sex and to women marriage is the first step in a whole new universe of responsibility and expectation.<br>  <br>  It is not that my wife does not enjoy sex... she just values other things more... Work, Church, Kids, Volunteering... Sometimes I am last on the list.<br>  <br>  Men and women will almost never view sex the same way because most woman could have it any time they wanted it and men are still left to hope and to pray and to obsess over when the next time will be.|`|AA11587827	we as humans have drifted away from our  moral and standards, all i can say that a man or a woman that has that attitude, should never get married, i would never refuse my wife sex when she wanted it and i dont think she should either, if she does, then its like i said ,she should not be married, people are all the time tring to fix something that's not broke, they also need to grow up and accept the commitments they make when they marry|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I agree that her body is hers and she is not owned property.

Eug52iQDaa	So be honest with him and ask him.  Work out a payment plan ahead of time and have it all on paper in the form of an IOU.  Family borrowing risks taking advantage of the person lending the money.  Treat money transactions like a business transaction.  Make payments on time and as agreed.  <br>  <br>  Then, after that's paid back,start saving a little money at a time.  Designate a set amount from what you earn and put it away first.  Then take care of other obligations.|`|XI3blPQtaa	my advise is to never get money and family mixed up 2gether!

And his sister (also Italian, shocker :P) is engaged to a Spanish guy, and his brother is married to an Italian-American woman.<br>  C. My tutor's ex-girlfriend is Irish.

Sometimes, we want someone but can't have them for whatever reason, and it makes us long for that person so much that we feel like we remain in love with them even when they're not with us. To love someone "forever" is to never forget the richness and beauty they brought into your life, or for the things they did and the way you are a kinder, gentler and more loving person yourself for having known them.  Love is very personal, totally subjective, and as unique from person to person as our fingerprints ... and time will tell which of our loves will last "forever" ... So to answer your question directly, yes, some loves do remain forever.  And that's the way of love.|`|iDScOWBIaa	this isnt really answering the question, but nowadays people dont care about forever, they only care about 5 minute disposable pleasures...

Finally, yes, a future with them will be the only priority in your life. When you know, you know. It's not the kind of thing where you just think you are.

If I could describe it in a physical sense, I'd say for me that it causes a feeling of fullness. Like the way I'd feel after a really good meal, only in my entire body. And while I still get irritated with my loved one on occasion and need some time for myself once in a while, I always look forward to being with them again.|`|RGG30rbkaa	Well only if you truly want love you have to put your heart into it.

Also you can join some group that are free, people with the same problem, they called neurotic anonymous, not that you are neurotic but they mention this group in the radio where people get with the same problem get together and meet other people.  Try not to contact him and find friend to help you every time you feel to call or text him.  I know what are you going through since I had been there.  After 7 years he told out the blue that he did not love anymore.  I had my heart in pieces and the worst thing is that we work in the same place.  When you remember him just say a little prayer.  Write a letter with all your feeling.  He is the one who lost, you will better little by little ,the pain will be less, but you have to keep away from him.  Don't let him full you.  Don't be his friend for now since he is using you.  I have the same problem, my family are not here and all my friend live far away.  I had been sick due to an injury but I'm also struggling.

Oh Yes.<br>  <br>  First off...don't joke about it.<br>  Call us weird...but even women who are not immediately interested in getting married consider this a serious topic...weddings and funerals are usually good things to avoid joking about.So yourself a huge favor and skip that.<br>  <br>  Second...once a woman (even a young one) hears the word "marriage", she will start a clock emotionally. The topic has been broached...and now she will have to start the process of evaluating the relationship for long term potential. She may not want to push the issue...but it's "out there". <br>  <br>  I lived with my husband for six years before he proposed...and he did what you have done.

I think it's ever too early to start mentioning 'love'.  People are still somewhat on their "Isn't it nice to be dating me" behavior.  If you bring up marriage, she's going to start making plans, or start running.  I don't know you well enough to know which.  If you like her, I don't see anything wrong with talking to her in future terms.

5c40baa93c7ba8164e45f151f1878025aa	Yes you will have to convert and be baptized.  I would go to the nearest Catholic church. Make an appointment to speak with a priest. They will help walk you through all the steps needed.  Good luck to you.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	One or both of you will have to convert to Catholicism before the wedding if you want to do that. The Catholic church will not allow outsiders to marry in their buildings. If you don't believe in what they do, why do you want to get married there? Is it because of the architecture of the building? A church is a house of worship, not a pretty backdrop. <br>  <br>  You are already married so you won't be having a wedding. It would be a renewal of vows. No priest, even if you were to convert, would marry you because that is grounds for fraud.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	The Roman Catholic church will marry a Catholic and and Orthodox person but not two Orthodox people, one of the two people getting married MUST be a baptised Roman Catholic. <br>  <br>  Also the Orthodox churches do not allow Orthodox people to marry in a Roman Catholic church, so even mixed-religion couples usually can only be married by Orthodox priest if they want to both follow their religion. Roman Catholics are allowed to marry in Orthodox church with dispensation from their bishop but never the other way around. Keep that in mind- your Orthodox church would never recognize this marriage. <br>  <br>  Anyway, at least one of you would have to convert, the Roman Catholic church does not marry couples where neither person is a Roman Catholic. They aren't going to let you convert just because you want a prettier wedding though you have to believe in the religion right?|`|363c1dee7cd5e73a40fbdbfd509017e5aa	You're not Orthodox if you want to marry Catholic just because you like the ceremony better. <br>  <br>  Convert because it doesn't matter to you anyway and see your dream come true.

It can be very insightful.|`|JV0i77uiaa	I would recommend you to go to Al-anon, they really can help you and tell you what to do.  He is an  addict and he must be very depressed.  He needs therapy a psychiatric and go to narcotic anonymous, but there is nothing you can do if he does not wants.  You have to take care of yourself.  Don't feel pity for him, don't stay with him.  If he keep this way there is no future for you and you had already waist 7 years.  Pray for him.  God bless and I hope you can help him helping yourself.|`|Fe56VaX4aa	He needs to get some help. You need to let him know how you feel. Let him know that you feel your relationship is drifting apart. If he wants to change that, that's awsome. But if he is not willing to do something about it. Then he doesn't see the relationship a big importance, and you will not be able to change that. If that happens, then he doesn't deserve you. You need somebody that will care for you back.|`|srAP6Vzvaa	wow this is so very sad . i dont know what to say. maybe have him see a psychiatrist ?? he has nothing to lose in seeing one.

It has been a few years since 18, but i seemed like I was moody and depressed.  18 is a hard age and it is about becoming an adult and paying your own way while you still know everything.   But seriously, he may need to get professional help and you may not be able to cheer him up, but you can be a friend and listen to his problems or be there to talk about what might be causing him to be sad or moody.  No one should be moody or sad for over a week, if he is he really needs to see his family doctor.  It is a sad world that we live in and we think sometimes that we wish our life was different, but then we see someone who is in a bad way and we can be thankful.  Tell your friend up font that you want to see him happy and that if he needs anything you will be there.  It sounds like he really needs a friend right now.|`|ibOD8ggDaa	take him out to eat or to the movies show him a good time and introduce him to your friends who knows
451075cc0b28ffa413b31fd0b3fd84c0aa	I know that you're not telling the whole story.  Whatever.<br>  It is natural to have mixed up feelings about your parents as you move from childhood dependence on them to young adulthood and independence.  Its moving away (emotionally), and sometimes can be "rough".<br>  Its your room and his house.  If he doesn't show the respect you (and everyone else) deserves, thats on him, not you.  You could pick a good time and calmly ask him why he continues to be rude, even after you've asked him to take his shoes off, but it may not do much good.<br>  The fact that him wearing shoes bothers you is alarming.  do you really believe that that is something to get all worked up about?<br>  There are kids starving and being beaten by their parents, or sold into slavery and you're complaining about shoes?  Hmm.  I assume the problem is deeper.  It is a tragedy to not be loved by your dad.  If it is true.  I am not really very sympathetic to your complaints about the work you have to do.  Nor is it his responsibility to "take you anywhere".<br>  Usually anger is a sign of fear.  Why do you think he is afraid?  Why are you?  I don't think you are in a position to judge what is best for your little brother.  If your dad is acting violently or cruelly then he should be reported.  There is no simple answer to family problems.  Sounds like it might be alcohol related.  Maybe you could talk to your high school counselor?  Good luck.  Don't try to take on the responsibility for your whole familly.  thats a huge job even for an adult.  Get some help.|`|AA10388823	Well, I have been in your boat. The best you could do is let things pass. Try seeking help, if need be. You're brave, and you'll handle it well, I'm sure. Good luck hun!|`|q4JaBnQuaa	well... if you can which i wouold think not talk to him. Also talk to your grandparents and tell them how you feel if stuff is really bad were you don't want to live there talk to a social worker at school and see if that will change there perespective a little bit also you can talk to a consuelr at school and they can talk to your parents with you so you won't be  worried|`|AV2q8U2Zaa	yes|`|O1MITmaGaa	I'm quite sure that something can be settled here.<br>  <br>  but first thing's first<br>  you drawing terrible pictures of your dad, and him treating you so disgusting can't keep going on. thus, is the solution:<br>  <br>  why not stay with your mom?<br>  I know things can be worked out. I'm sure that legally, if the child is unsatisfied and feeling abused in a household, and thinks she'd be better off with the other parent, that can be arranged. the fact that your father seems to want to keep you just because he's selfish with his money is just horrendous. if you want to be with your mom, let her know, tell her how things are going, if possible. maybe she'll be able to get a lawyer or something<br>  <br>  if that doesn't work, perhaps you can get to stay with your mom through going to the cops. or if you're at school, talk to your guidance counselor but tell him/her that you don't want them to confront your dad, or tell them that it's a sensitive situation. they could probably help<br>  <br>  I truly wish you the best of luck here. I'm rather certain that legally, the children have some say in which parent they want to be with (reminds me of Catch Me If You Can, where the boy has to choose whether to be with his mom or dad). I hope you don't have to keep going through this because this sounds like a terrible house for you, and your siblings to grow up in. Think of how important it is for your brother to be raised in a warm household - and try to find a safe way to secure that future for you, your sister, and brother.
NU1VFg3gaa	Talk to your local Parish Priest.  I am sure he would be delighted to perform some kind of special blessing, privately or publicly say for instance during mass.  I hope this is the case, my husband lost his wedding band four years ago and I have only just replaced it (was very hard to locate the identical) but I still don't feel "right" if that makes sense.  I am planning on seeing our local parish priest in the hope of having the two of them blessed together.

ise05jjUaa	I believe every girl is perfect in her own way & one day someone special will realize that she is special to when he decides he wants to be with her.  Putting the word "perfect" & "woman" together is too broad of a question to ask of all men, we don't all think the same as far as what is perfect for us.  Myself, looks wise, I like Kim Kardashian, but some men may say she's got to big of an ***.  I know a lot of men like the model Gisela, but I certainly don't, she's got no ***, so you see perfection to each man is different.  That has a lot to do with how we're raised, how the men in our lives treated women & so on.  So one man may like a certain lady & think she's the most gorgeous thing in the world, another may not.  Looks matter to a lot of men, but personality is really the key, it can either make or break a potential relationship.  Again, I may like a certain type of personality compared to someone else, its all individual preference.|`|jYMlAN4Paa	No one and nothing is perfect.

Also looks come in to play but normally you wouldn't ask some one out that you don't find attractive.|`|bIE0PTY3aa	She is very quiet. She keeps to herself. She may have self esteem problems (when I bring this one up, it usually confuses people, but I look for girls who are not too sure of themselves, so that I can study them and find the things that are beautiful about them and show THEM then things that are beautiful about them). Girls who look down when you look at them... Not away, but down. Girls that I have to stop in the hallway at a book store or the mall to talk to. I like girls that I have to stop to talk to, and I mean I have to STOP THEM, not like, I have to stop moving and then they stop. I like having to get their attention. I like approaching them and then maybe just touching them on the arm gently because that get's the oxytocin going and that's a TRUST chemical. I'll ask her her name, I'll tell her first of why WHY I stopped her ("look, I'm sorry, I know we don't know each other, but I had no choice but to stop you because if I didn't, I know I'll be regretting it later...  what's your name (answer)... Oh, ok, I'm John. How old are you, what do you do? (by this time she'll usually tell you if she has a boyfriend). You don't want to drag the conversation out, but insteaed of pulling your cell phone out....  (go ahead and pull it out), but also pull a little piece of paper out and tell her straight up "look, I don't know if you're gonna call me....  only you can answer that question, and you don't have to answer it now.... but here's my name, #, and email address). I check my email every day".... I'd really like to hear from you. I realize that all we have to go on for now is that you're gorgeous, but if we can build on that, then maybe we have something going. I'm looking for intelligence more than anything. That's what I seek in a girl. It's all about what's up here (point to your head).. Tell her that you're late, you've got to go, but you're glad that you ran into her and it'd be great to her from her sometime. then SMILE, LOOK HER IN THE EYES, tell her you've got to go. turn, and GO.. Your job is done. <br>  <br>  Now, as to what makes a girl perfect, I think I outlined it a little in the beginning, but just a quiet girl who doesn't think she's beautiful, but I DO. There are plenty of girls out there who don't find themselves attractive but I'd give a million bucks to get to know them. They think they're worthless. they wear glasses, they have acne, the have cracked lips, they don't wear makeup. THAT, TO ME, IS WHAT MAKES A GIRL PERFECT. I love those traits. and Yes, I know that you girls consider them imperfections, but TRUST ME, there plenty of guys out there whom consider them PERFECTIONS. Mussed hair? Can't keep it under conrol? Can't afford new shoes? Walking around with a ten year old back-pack that looks like it should belong to a male freshman physics major? I LOVE GIRLS LIKE THAT. So for all you girls out there who don't wear makeup, DON'T WEAR IT. You're ten times sexier without it. NO PERFUME? EXCELLENT. I hate the stuff.Just shower, a little deoderant, and some baby powder, No ear-rings? No rings, No jewelry? You are my dream girl. Just thought I'd try to answer the question as honestly as possible. -john in rock island, illinois, QUAD CITIES, USA (johndeporter@yahoo.com)|`|i67jl71Uaa	IMO<br>  There is really no perfect.<br>  Personally, I like a girl that I can trust, is sweet, loving, talkative.<br>  And hey, if she's good looking, thats never a bad thing. <br>  <br>  Don't try to be something that you arent.

It's simple. Backstabbers generally LIKE to receive attention, whether positive or negative. If you show no reaction and move on with your life, she will get no satisfaction out of it. You seem a little immature and you will probably not listen to my advice. It will only get worse if you stay her friend, try to catch her, and give her all of the attention she wants.<br>  <br>  Edit- Trust your gut feeling. If you think she's talking about you, there is a 99% chance that she is. There is no need to confirm it.|`|Fvh6y6chaa	Friend? yeah right some friend!

He may just be in a funk and feels like he needs to be seen as sexy, or a catch.

When you look to your side you see the one who you made a commitment with.<br>  Now in order to change with the years you have to communicate, and talk things out. Talk about how you feel instead of reacting to your feelings.<br>  It seems like your husband thinks he will find what has been lost not knowing that the happiness is right in front of him...you both need to find it together before it's gone.

If so, approach National Commission for Women. Else, if there is any health related issues, it is advisable for both to consult a family counsellor / *** therapist to get cured of any deficiencies in either of you. If it is really so unbearble, then better apply for divorce and join some good ashram / missionaries where you would be safe.

qxgkhN8aaa	Hi Periwink, though your questions are specifically aims at meeting<br>  guys/girls and jobs and self esteem, but the answer to your questions will be quite random.<br>  <br>  STRENGTH, as in almost anything, sometimes we'll make it and sometimes we'll break it.<br>  As strength will also comes with when you aged.<br>  What you're afraid to do in the past, you might get some or all the strength<br>  to do what you'll wants to do, in future.<br>  And seeing most things with difficulties, someday you'll also find,<br>  yeah, this is actually easy to achieve. But not everything, OK ?<br>  And as strength also comes with practice, for example like,<br>  even patience, spiritually, emotionally, mastery, and a whole lot more.<br>  So, basically, everyone in this world will never be perfect and everyone in this<br>  world will never can own everything, and if they do, they'll rather die,<br>  cuz why ? because simply, s/he got no any other challenges left for him/her<br>  to push their own boundaries anymore, so why live.<br>  And for people who had gain their strength and acting with self confidence,<br>  even this kind of people might break down someday, <br>  but not necessarily, just that, it might happen though rare.<br>  And if you want to prove at what you're good at,<br>  then, make sure you know and find something that you really loves to do.<br>  Even common ones.<br>  As in not everyone in this world who loves to do something unique or out of<br>  this world..........., can you get me now ?|`|jUXzm8u9aa	Experience, passion, and competing. For the girls, if you are about to talk to her, and your nervous, then there isn't much you can do because this is what you are. Anyways, you can never be sure that everything will go right.<br>  <br>  When I don't get a job, I try again. I'm looking for a job now, and I live in California. We're having econimics issue, and I ask like 10 restaurants if their hiring, and none of them wants me. But I try again. Remember, when you reach the bottom, there is no where else to go but to the top.<br>  <br>  You prove yourself that you are good at what you do by competing. For example, I'm good at rubik's cube, and fast solving it too. I search around and see if I'm as fast as the average competitors or anything, then I go compete them.<br>  <br>  There will be time that you lose your "strength" and "self-confidence", not everything will go perfect. Sometime you can't control it, and that is what destiny is. If it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be.|`|YqQbQkvNaa	listen to music that you like.

sY1itvPkaa	Who knows. Maybe?
O1MITmaGaa	It sounds like you would've been better off making a star than buying one.<br>  <br>  anyway, it's not a matter of WHETHER, but HOW.<br>  <br>  it seems like a sweet present to give to your life. but it's less ABOUT the present, than it is about HOW you wrap the present, how you present the present. ;)<br>  <br>  you could hand it to her, say "love you honey," *kiss* - you'll get a 3 maybe for that.<br>  <br>  or you could take her by the hand, bring her outside (if it's not too cold), look at the stars while holding her in your arms, and whisper in her ear, "you know what they say? these stars burn for far longer than we do. we just exist for a second of their lives. they're pretty much fixed in the sky for forever, just the way I want my love for you to be." *then hand her the gift*<br>  <br>  OKAY, OKAY that might be plain sappy, but I'm a sucker for romantic stuff, and it sounds like your wife isn't too unresponsive to that style either. BUT: my point is, it's all about the packaging. how you present it is more important than what you present. I've given some not-s-great presents, but have decorated, wrapped, or designed them in such a way that they seem way more worthy than they really are. not to say a star isn't worth much, but it's important to keep in mind how you create the meaning of that star. RHETORIC. how you create the truth of what that star means in your lives together.<br>  <br>  best wishes!|`|NmsuIXd1aa	it's the thought that counts.|`|BkN9ICoNaa	cheesy poof !!! woman like roses or diamonds or s*x not stuff  they cant spend lol|`|WxbrZnKdaa	aww.. i wish my boyfriend did that for me! lol, i think since you put the thought into it she will appreciate it.|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	I think she will absolutely love it. If she really makes cards instead of buying then she will adore this. She will love the idea and really think its romantic. What can be more romantic than having your husband speak about stars...hehe<br>  <br>  I think its an awesome gift and I REALLY think she will love it. <br>  Wish you alll the best!|`|IvMPh09baa	i would say its pretty freakin GAY!<br>  <br>  Thats what you should name the star also, GAY!|`|94gC814Eaa	I Love it i love the night sky it is a comfort to my soul, therefore  I would love it. <br>  <br>  Also I think its cute cause you can't buy her the moon, but you can buy her a star. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Where i live there are few stars due to light pollution. Oh how i miss the thousands of stars back home.|`|tRAHbAL8aa	It really depends on the girl.<br>  <br>  I would think that that is the sweetest thing in the world if my boyfriend did that to me though (:|`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	I say cheesy.|`|SnpP6dGFaa	I think it's sweet :D|`|AA12095067	I love cheesy stuff, and I love stars - but honestly that star thing is just a scam.<br>  <br>  If my husband "bought" me a star (which has no status whatsoever) of course I'd say thank you, but inside I'd be fuming that he got scammed like a rube.<br>  <br>  Make her a card with stars on it, write a poem about stars or take her star-gazing one beautiful night (my husband does that and it's always magical), but for heaven's sake don't do the star thing.|`|ml2FDYECaa	I'm not sure what you are getting at, but making a card is better than buying a star. For one...buying a star is like throwing money away. Making a card has more thought, and love that goes into it. I have been making my own cards for years, and it is the best thing. My family gets a kick out of it, and they enjoy the time and the art that goes into making them. They are original, and 'mine'...my own thoughts go into it. Even if you make up a cheezy poem is much better than buying...come on, be real. And being cheap has nothing to do with it. I like spending money. Even when it comes to buying a card that would cost me a buck, or two I still like making my own.<br>  <br>  Now to answer what I think your question is; the whole star thing is way cheezy. I had a conversation on that the other day with a friend at work, and man...any sucker who buys one has been taken for a ride. Just think of what you are going to look like when people find out you bought a star....think aobut it.|`|cu8fUJbMaa	Awwwwwwww!  I think that's horribly sweet and very romantic and I'm sure she will love it!  Be sure that you look at the chart they provide you with and know where to locate the star in the night sky so you can take her right out and show it to her.|`|7NEbLq8gaa	My cousin's fiance did that for her and the next night when we had a girls night out. Well all the ladies were like AWWWW!!! But me personally, I think it would mean more to me if you took me with you and we went through the whole process TOGETHER. But on the other hand like my grandma says what for you, she/he picks out and what for us is for US to pick out. Good luck and god's speed|`|XJ2BW5p7aa	Totally depends on the person you are talking about. While one woman will think it is the most romantic thing to date the other will think you are a cheap cheesy dude that tries hard to not spend any money.|`|utYyjRFdaa	i think your wife will really appreciate it...it really doesn't take to much to make women happy. so just the fact that you thought of something nice to do for her will be enough.|`|66dAMlktaa	LOL, that'd be good enough but don't forget to actually buy something for her if she's the 'practical' person and isn't so much a romantic as you are...|`|fyKFnxCnaa	Well personally, I prefer Coach.. <br>  <br>  However, if she is big on thought and not purses, then she will probably love it.<br>  No worries man..
wY2k1cHVaa	I'm in the same situation and my friends refer to me as being "shy or quiet". Not a problem for me though. I just don't have much to say. Nothing interesting goes on and i have a pretty boring/monotonous life =/<br>  <br>  I get tired and stressed out easily. Especially at school so during lunch when i socialize...i just doze off. I really don't like talking when i'm tired. Or maybe you know your friends too well and you don't know how to start a conversation? Like you've already talked about everything and there's nothing else to talk about? I hope that makes sense.|`|OgQG7oNOaa	Try caffiene, cause its probably not you its your friends who cant have a stimulating conversation.

He should be happy that his mother has found someone, even if it could be awkward, but that is why we are given this thing we call life.  It can be traumatic to think that our parents or parent actually has sex, but it is true.  This would also be difficult for her, I would imagine, but she is his parent and she should really be the one to talk with him instead of him having to be the one.  This is sad because it could really be a win win situation for both if handled correctly. But it sounds like it is being ignored (and maybe it will just go away)  It sounds like he might be ashamed and really does not know how to act.  But he has got to get over it and get his life back.  Maybe you should suggest counseling to him and let him talk with someone.  I wish I could be more help, but the mother should really address this with her son.|`|vxE9xBoTaa	you should bring him to a psychologist or counselor. he's probably traumatized by what he saw.|`|Ssq55UYPaa	enter my dick contest and I will declare u first place automatically
M7r7gHNGaa	You can't make someone want a relationship anymore than you can make someone love you. He has a perfectly logical reason not to be in one right now. If he got into a relationship with you, has to work, and take classes he will have little time for dates, endless texting, IMs, or phone calls. Most girls end up feeling neglected and will start pressuring the guy until he either pushes her away, or flunks out of school trying to keep her happy.<br>  <br>  Try to be understanding and discuss setting a trial time period to see how you both deal with not seeing or hearing from each other.

It may be emotional needs, spiritual needs, or even physical needs.<br>  <br>  This guy is being thoughtful for you in any case when the workload at school is insufferable, he was afraid to neglect you. Yet, recognise that he does have feelings for you. <br>  <br>  Find out his need through good communication and ask yourself if you can fulfill that need of his. For example, if he doesn't need a girlfriend, but just a friend with benefits, would you be willing?|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	well just be there for him .. that's what makes it happen .ok good luck.. but tell him you have 2 tickets to a movie you won .. will he go with you .. get the idea .. ok|`|rvmiK8rgaa	A man wants to be loved, and he will feel that if a gal takes an interest in his deepest feelings..Converse with him.....and let him make the running physically.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	BE ON TIME AND MEAN WHAT YOU SAY AND SAY WHAT YOU DO. thats about sums it up. and answer your damn phone calls.

I have a few things on my list that make me want to be in a relationship:<br>  (1) Emotional support.<br>  (2) To cheer me up when I'm depressed.<br>  (3) To not only be my girlfriend, but in a way also my best friend.<br>  <br>  Take advantage of this list because the next time you see him depressed and feeling down and you can sense that he need someone to talk to, you should be the first to ask him how he's feeling and try to help him feel better. Over time, he will realize that you are a caring person and he will see great potential in you. We want a girl who really cares about us and not just wanting to be with us just to go out and have fun. Meanwhile give him some time to figure out what he want to do with his love life, but you should always remind him that you're there for him when he needs you. Then after awhile, hit him with the question and put him in the spotlight. Ask him how he feels about the two of you in a relationship. Tell him that you love him and want to take it further and surely he will respond appropriately.

Really you can wear it on whatever finger you want.  Getting a ring resized isn't a big deal.  Most stores carry rings in a size 7 as it is the average women's sized ring.  If you want, wear it on your third finger.  If not, head down to any jewelry store and they can get it sized for you.  I work at Zales and they do it for like 30 bucks but anywhere can do it.|`|AA11143998	I don't believe it matters what finger you wear it on. I wear mine on my right hand on my middle finger.

She might like the smoothness and less prickliness of a shaved face?|`|94Bhw04iaa	She finds it sexy, so maybe you should keep it..|`|cyfDLbfRaa	why shave it off? just keep it. if she likes it, then hey make her happy. i think?<br>  and if it truly bothers you, then tell her. say its u know ur body ur face, and you'd feel better if ur facial hair was gone!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  5clock shadow is sexieeesttt! whoo :]<br>  <br>  -kels
tXZTi73kaa	Personally, I think she'd love it!  It's not like she doesn't know she's heavy... like she looks in the mirror every day and doesn't notice.  Really, I think she might be more attracted to you knowing that you like her just the way she is.|`|aXnxkT1oaa	but what will you say - i like your fat? or "ooooh sexy fat"?|`|HUUZgDppaa	i dont think they will mind if you like them heavy technically its a compliment you got nothing to lose|`|sUBOZnxFaa	Curvy is a good word to use. Heavy can be taken as an insult. I think a girl would appreciate it specially if she is self conscious or has low self esteem. I would suggest you do it in a sweet way, put your arms around her and tell her she is beautiful. Any girl would love that and it will definitely boost her confidence.|`|UXarq5Tdaa	don't say the word heavy or any word that implies that, even full figured might insult some unless this girl is really heavy and knows she is, if its just a chick with an extra 20lb and you say that she might get offended if she's self conscious about her weird|`|hBbgjasQaa	It is a matter of taste , no harm liking such. Arabs love it. An Arab poet says , Alas, i may pass through a desert with a group of trees and find there a woman with heavy buttocks with three children playing under it.So go ahead to ur likings|`|J8tYQZ4gaa	well i think if you told a heavy girl that she prolly wouldnt mind and it would boost her confidence i know my bro likes heavy girls girls better hey whatever makes you happy!|`|O1MITmaGaa	1 it's nice that a guy can appreciate a variety of body shapes. I know very few who do. a very valuable characteristic to have!<br>  <br>  #2 I might be slightly insulted if you said you liked heavy girls - it's like saying you like skinny girls - it's the problem that you generalize just based on appearance. It might seem like you're being considerate and open minded, not a guy who likes the stereotypical thin-body-type. But the fact is that it's still rude to judge someone from the outside.<br>  <br>  #3 but, if that's how you feel and you want to share it, fine. I might think you're making fun of me, but it's your freedom to say what you want.<br>  <br>  #4 just tell a girl you like the way she looks, as well as her personality. be specific and personal with what you say. don't talk about girls in general, but about her in particular. that way, you'll end up in less trouble, most likely.|`|Pnn3VgFpaa	That depends really. If the girl is aware that she is heavy and does not have a problem with it, I am sure she would find it a compliment. However, if the girl is busy with her weight, and very conscious of it, then I don't think it would be a good idea. You'd only confirm that she is heavy and since she doesn't want to be it, she is more likely to take is as an insult. I have moved country and gained over 10 kg when I was there. I really wanna get rid of that extra weight, so I would not take it as a compliment. :) Hope this helps.|`|AA11584265	You don't have to announce it from the roof tops...just show that you appreciate a girl (heavy or not) by spending time with her. Do nice things for her, talk to her. Be attentive and willing to listen. Be a gentleman at all times. Whatever you do, just don't say to her I like "heavy" girls so your weight doesn't bother me. Even if that is meant from the heart, your words will be hurtful to her because she will know that you have noticed her weight. So just leave weight out of it and just be yourself. Thats the best way to go about it.|`|mMPVZ0Zmaa	I think you would be better off saying 'curvy'. Most girls have poor self-image due to weight and calling them heavy most likely won't be taken as a compliment, even if you mean well.|`|dJ7xagFCaa	well dont exactly say "i like you being heavy" try telling her shes pretty or "i like you the way you are" its nothing to be ashamed of, i think its nice.|`|3y0jPzgSaa	just use the word CURVEY
wuLL7tG6aa	You should file an ex parte emergency motion asking for immediate relief from the court. The court could issue immediate relief awarding you sole custody if it believes there is a potential of harm to the kids. Re: service of the papers, if she is ducking it, you can ask that the court allow her to be served by another way (for example publication in a newspaper).<br>  <br>  If you cannot find her and have no idea where she might be, another option is hiring a private investigator to help you locate her. When you locate her if you have the court order you can contact the local police, show them your court order - from that they will be able to see that she is not abiding by the court order and can help you to get your kids back.<br>  <br>  You really should have a lawyer assisting you with this and helping you navigate the court process. You can contact the law society and they should be able to guide you in finding a lawyer including (if money is an issue) legal aid or reduced fee legal services if you qualify.

W4ibqcLMaa	He definitley likes you I had the same reaction when my friend did that to me, if you want to go out with him have one of your friends ask him if he likes you he will probably say yes or kinds or maybe all of those are good then have your friend tell him to ask you out always works|`|59cnZfTeaa	Firstly this is the first time i've heard of any young people called Hector. Wow.<br>  <br>  from the second bit of information I'd say yes.

It's kind of hard to tell. But I would recommend moving on. If she's this hard to read now when she barely knows you imagine how she would be if you got married or something. Yeek!|`|8hzSHritaa	It's too early to tell. Give it time.

And if she is like a sister how can you disrespect her feelings for him like that.<br>  I dont care how much of a babe he is...you are jumping over your friend's corpse to get to him and its worst because you knew she liked him.<br>  <br>  Who knows you might meet someone else you like more which isnt such a bad idea.|`|h4SWtjb2aa	promise traci that youll let nothing *** between ur friendship

I think its more of a thing people just do to say they have done.  Many regret it, some do not.  Comes to a matter of preference.  Being cool is important to some people, but to do YOU is Important to yourself and emotional well being.|`|6IuarYyOaa	no dude your smart. im 18 and i did the same thing. so do what feels right to you. to be honest i wish i was still was a virgin i thought it wasn't cool is i just said screw it and me and her havent been the same. do whats right for you no matter what people say!|`|bqPr6kc6aa	well...im nineteen and i really would love to meet someone my age whose a virgin, so i think it's cool!

He got mad at you, and LEFT because you didn't kiss him? Sounds like he likes it all his way, or no way at all. A guy that's worth your time would wait for your kiss..when you are ready. I know it sounds lame to you maybe, but trust me it's true. It shows about his character, and it's not looking good. Your firtst kiss should be special. It will feel right to you. Because you pulled away, you must have a little "gut" feeling that he wasn't worthy.|`|Zlye7is3aa	tell him you like him if you do, and if you don't then let him know that you just want to be friends, but if you really do care about this guy as a friend or as otherwise then the best thing to do would really be to talk to him and at least let him know whats on your mind|`|4snTNQ98aa	well you 2 are drunk so hopefully he wont remember a thing and even if he does try to act like nothing had happen|`|8FbOtXAXaa	Just talk to him and act like everything is cool between you two.

Try new things also. Change your hair and make up, get your nails done etc, basically to boost your own confidence. It is possible for someone to fall in love with you no matter how you look.

AA10065812	*** It is best to stay together for the child, but you don't say why you think he's having an affair?  Could you be misreading the signs?  <br>  <br>  Over 85% of the children of divorce develop life long behavioral problems, so finding a way to keep it together is best.  If you have clear evidence that he's having an affir, start putting Saltpeter in his food.  Keeps him from getting it up.  When Kathy Lee Gifford learned her husband was having an affair she jumped his bones every chance she got until he was too worn out to fool around with anyone else.<br>  <a href="http://celebrity.rightpundits.com/?p=4040" rel="nofollow">http://celebrity.rightpundits.com/?p=404...</a><br>  <br>  Here's some books that may help.<br>  <br>  Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands<br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Proper-Care-and-Feeding-of-Husbands/Laura-Schlessinger/e/9780060520625/?itm=8" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Proper-...</a><br>  <br>  The Proper Care and Feeding of Marriage <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Proper-Care-and-Feeding-of-Marriage/Dr-Laura-Schlessinger/e/9780061142826/?itm=4" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Pro...</a><br>  <br>  Woman Power: Transform Your Man, Your Marriage, Your Life <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Woman-Power/Laura-Schlessinger/e/9780641817847/?itm=6" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Woman-P...</a><br>  <br>  Ten Stupid Things Couples do to Mess up Their Relationships <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stupid-Things-Couples-do-to-Mess-up-Their-Relationships/Laura-Schlessinger/e/9780060512606/?itm=7" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stu...</a><br>  <br>  Ten Stupid Things Men Do to Mess Up Their Lives <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stupid-Things-Men-Do-to-Mess-Up-Their-Lives/Laura-Schlessinger/e/9780641865411/?itm=8" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stu...</a><br>  <br>  Stupid Things Parents Do to Mess Up Their Kids <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Stupid-Things-Parents-Do-to-Mess-Up-Their-Kids/Laura-Schlessinger/e/9780060933791/?itm=12" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Stupid-...</a>|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	I stayed for the kids, that was 36 years ago, she had five other affairs since then. I'm still here, my life is over and ruined, she's somewhere else with her thinking, very shallow and thinks I should accept it. Will not talk about it.<br>      Don't end up like me.|`|AA12346188	If you cannot tolerate and sure of his infidelity, you can ditch him any time. But life is not that easy, if you are economically dependent.<br>  You can decide when only you are economically independent.<br>  Otherwise, there is no other go but to accept him as he is.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	No you shouldn't stay if you don't want to, its much better for them to have two happy honest parents than one cheating disrespectful parent and one unhappy disrespected parent. They will figure out there is some kind of problem anyway, and kids get really stressed about that kind of thing. Also children model their parents behavior and really do look for partners who are similar to their parents- 8/9 times out of 10 the daughters will grow up and find men who will cheat on them or treat them poorly and the sons will grow up and treat their wives poorly in some way or cheat on them. <br>  <br>  Divorce can be hard on them but its better and healthier for them in the long run.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Never stay for the kids. You do not want them to grow up thinking this is what a normal marriage and family are like. You don't want them to see you stay with a man that does not value what he has and does not treat his family right. These are not good messages to send to children. These kids want a mother that is happy and content.|`|0ulKsvXlaa	I would tell him you are only staying with him for the sake of the children, and that normally you would have divorced him by now.<br>  <br>  Having said that, add that because he insists on continuing his affairs, you intend to look around for yourself, with the intention of finding yourself a lover.<br>  <br>  What is good for the goose is good for the gander.<br>  <br>  See how he likes that !|`|AA11315360	No never. He is risking your safety and your children's safety by having affairs. Who knows if any of these women could go nuts that he is married and go after your family. Also he is at risk of bringing home an STD to you like AIDS! So dont stay with a man who cheats and wants it to stay that way. If he has no remorse or moral problems with cheating on you and plans on continuing cheating then you need to leave him immediately! Take the kids and leave. Get a divorce. <br>  Your kids would rather be in a divorced home rather than see their mother upset and crying because the father is cheating on her.<br>  If you stay with him you are telling your kids that a woman should stay with a man who cheats. And that cheating is ok. They might grow up and become just like him or just like you.<br>  Would you want your children to allow someone to cheat on them? Or do you want your children to grow up and be cheaters?<br>  Let your kids see that if a man cheats and continues it then you get a divorce. Let them see a strong woman who leaves. And let them see the punishment for their dad is a divorce. That he can no longer have you.|`|K2QwEM4raa	Please don't stay because of your children. You just said that you don't want to stay, so don't. I was once upon a time one of 4 children that their mother thought the same way as you do now. It will cause permanent damage to your children in one form or the other. They will in the end pay the price. I loved my father but it was the best thing in the world for us kids and my mother when she finally got up the nerve to leave. Even if some of the kids don't like it they almost always get over it. My mom can't believe she stayed 20 years and she was very sorry for herself and us that she did. Kids are smarter than you think.|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	If he was remorsefull and no longer seeing this woman I would support you.  However he has already destroyed your family and has no apologies.  Get a private investigator so you can show something to the judge when you go for full custody, child support, and alimony.  He deserves to live at the YMCA eating beanies and wienies 3 meals a day.|`|onbwN4csaa	You know your kids aren't stupid. You may not tell them but they know somethings wrong.<br>  They will grow up with loveless parents.<br>  and in time see the fighting and sadness from both of you.<br>  Don't use the kids to justify and hide your fear in<br>  taking that step to start a new better life.<br>  maybe the kids will experience and see what<br>  true love looks like between there mother<br>  and there new step father. <br>  and finely be happy as a family.<br>  Think about it  ??|`|AA11678629	no if you stay then you are cheating yourself. but if you do decide to stay why deny yourself pleasure go out and fet some of your own who knows what might develop maybe you will meet someone and find a new husband|`|WmTD3Rlaaa	You are a true hero. You have stood by a man for the kids sake just so they may have a family. I feel for you Hun. Your not alone.|`|POJNnWhDaa	NO get out. Kids will understand when they get older. Do not ever stay with anyone who cheats on you.|`|yVIb7zjiaa	You and the kids stay kick his sorry @ss out...|`|5af8PNwxaa	Confused...I would be having a good talk with him and telling him I want this affair to finish...now.<br>  I would be asking him if he really wants to save this marriage and go to marriage counselling to work on the problems/issues in the marriage.<br>  I am not too sure why you let the first affair go by without saying anything (ie having another affair) as he seems to think this behaviour is OK.  He is really being so disrespectful to you...and trust, trust has gone out the window.<br>  <br>  I can appreciate that 15 years is a long time, I do feel you really deserve so much better than this, as hard as it may be the kids learn from parents behaviour and I figure being married 15 years you have kids on the verge on becoming teenagers and if you have any sons, this behaviour (ie having affairs) will carry forward to your son's adult relationships.  As difficult as it may be, you may need to break up the family home for the kids sake (if talks, counselling fails)...as believe me kids pick up on everything and you and the kids need to be happy and not miserable.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ti1K0USpaa	DO NOT STAY WITH THE GUY!  Staying with him is the worst thing that you can do for yourself and your kids.  Your kids may not consciously know what's going on, but they will pick up on the tension, anxiety, and depression that inevitably comes from a dysfunctional relationship (no matter how well you "fake it"), and the adverse affects on them will be life-long.  I completely understand that you are willing to do anything for your kids and that you're willing to make any sacrifice - this is proof of that.  It's also pretty obvious that your intentions are pure and admirable.  However, should you stay with him, the repercussions will be devastating for all involved, and the kids will suffer the most.|`|1680de8ab7d0f5d20f5b73ba98b5a13faa	Kids are just innocent and are the future.<br>  <br>  While it is true that given the conditions kids may not be getting the right atmosphere at home as it should be , but it is STILL worth giving a chance by taking positive steps, possibly as :<br>  - Making your husband realise that he is being unfair with kids<br>  - Making him COMMIT why he want to have an affair in the first place<br>  - If required even confront him <br>  <br>  Please do not feel shy to take help of any one who knows both of you, particularly an elderly relative or friend or even a professional councillor. <br>  <br>  Your concern for kids is very nobel and am sure you will be able to work around the difficulty you are facing now.Besides, going up for a split is just giving up.<br>  <br>  Just think if the world will never be the same for kids (after their parents split up) will it be better and  enjoyable for you and your husband , no matter what he is doing now ?<br>  <br>  I am sure your husband will soon realise that Responsibility is more important than Love !.<br>  <br>  In fact Responsibility means Love !<br>  <br>  <br>  ALL THE BEST ! ! !|`|fyKFnxCnaa	No.  You can't sacrifice your happiness in life because of your kids.<br>  <br>  You will be miserable, and therefore you wont be able to actually give your kids what they need from their mother.<br>  <br>  This is the only life you got!  Don't waste it with some jerk because you have children.  This can also cause resentment to not only your husband, but your kids.<br>  <br>  You are not responsible for him cheating.  He made that decision.<br>  <br>  He is the one that decided that family isn't important.<br>  <br>  NOT YOU!!!!!<br>  <br>  He is the bad guy, not you!<br>  There are plenty of men in this world that will actually treat you and your kids decent.<br>  <br>  And a divorce doesn't have to mean that the kids have no relationship with their father.<br>  <br>  They can still see their father - but you sure don't have to suffer anymore.<br>  <br>  Sorry you are going through this!|`|BNrQSYwhaa	Your husband does not deserve your love or your children's love.Your Making the choice to make yourself unhappy for the sake of your children.If you Stay you will continue to see him with his Mistress having fun while your are depressed.If you break up your children from their father you could find a man who treats you right and who could be a great father figure for your children.An alternative Method would be to confront him about it and see if you can work something out.<br>  Best of luck|`|HtApr3l7aa	When you say that they are still so young, how old are they?  I ask this question because a divorce can impact children more when they are older. Children at a young age can more easily accept things as they are and cope with it.<br>  If you did leave, I would explain to the children that daddy has done the wrong thing by mommy and you need to leave because it is making you very sad. <br>  <br>  It is a tough decision to make and there are positives and negatives whichever way you decide. Ultimately, the decision is yours and up to you to weigh up. Only you will know deeply inside what is the best solution for your family. No one can tell you what it is except your own personal convictions. - Go with that, it is where you will find your strength to get through this.|`|UhmeFaiRaa	wow... sound like it's tough.  But, what I have learned through a similar experience is that your kids want you to be happy.  If you stay with this man who is cheating on you and probably a huge liar!!! What will you be teaching your kids? That it ok to treat women this way or that its okay to be treated this way? Most men that cheat came from a house of cheaters!! Most woman that allow this, watched their own allow it.  If  you really want to do something for your kids, show them what is right from wrong!|`|crAPb2Diaa	HELL NO!that is the last thing u should do .don't do it for your kids do it for your self.God would not want that for any family so please don't do that to your kids and especially to your self .alwas remember your kids will grow and go on there own and were will u end up old and lonely  don't Waite tell its to late for u to be happy im not saying go find some 1 just don't set with your hands crossed tell its to late to be happy !|`|i6zSUjVoaa	If you are absolutely positive that he is having an affair then do not just stay in it for your children. Someday they will understand why you made your choice, you should not feel obligated to stay with someone who is unfaithful. You deserve better.|`|lvrcRLU8aa	Hell No! he the one that is breaking up the family not you. If you stay in that relationship it's bad for you and it well eventually affect the kids.|`|1l8JCXdSaa	leave. my mother was in the same situation. after she left my father we were all happier. the kids can still visit him. you deserve better. we were young when it happened as well, but we were just fine. you will be too. good luck.|`|VJ3Y4RwTaa	Dont cause this will ruin your kids future and mental outlook towards people and the world around them. Kids need parents father and mother or else they come out a little strange.|`|XI3blPQtaa	no way, he is an A S S H O L E.
358cbae440ce92123d3d9003e4a471dbaa	slip her a note,<br>  and say that you noticed her, thought she was beautiful, would like a chance to get to know her better (with some kind of contact info)|`|Eug52iQDaa	So go in and buy a tube of toothpaste or something and tell her that you'd like to get to know her better.  Could you meet her for lunch or maybe a movie?  Have a piece of paper ready with your number on it.  Hand it to her and ask her to please call if she'd like to get to know you better too.  Leave it at that.  It's honest and simple, and you're asking her to go somewhere public, since she doesn't know you at all.  If she calls, ask her where she would like to go and meet her on her terms.  If you start suggesting other things, you're going to creep her out and scare her.  Remember, you're an unknown person.<br>  <br>  If she declines right away at the register, still slip her the piece of paper and tell her that if she decides you're not an axe murderer to give you a call.. smile.  Remember, everyone is a stranger until you meet them.   :) <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|UUl6LsPzaa	I know it says women only but I have a solution for you. Here it is: the next time you go in to the store, buy something, make small talk at the register, then say, "What are you doing after work? Do you want to go to ____ with me." Then when she hands you the receipt. Take it and write you phone number on it. Then say, "I don't need my receipt" and give it back to her.|`|dzbblpjgaa	When you behave this anxious she probably already knows! Or thinks you may go shoplifting.... Just ask her "How many hours do you work as you always seem to be in here? She will probably reply "So do You!" Break the ice, don't just buy it! Good luck!|`|3ggolLgQaa	The best thing to do is go to the drug store when you have a real reason. Talk to her and tell her that you noticed shes new to the area and you dint mind showing her around the place.|`|Q2sy3BGOaa	chains you can drop in to get a snack?|`|ruE1llE2aa	If it's really that hard, I would skip wooing her in. I mean, you would be a gentleman about it, definitely, but like you already said, just be direct. Don't spill your guts out, but tell her the truth and ask her out to dinner at a diner or something. Don't hide behind excuses or awkward pick up lines. Those are the worst and put us girls in a weird position, >_<

8FbOtXAXaa	The best thing you can do is treat her with respect and just be yourself. Show her that you care about her by doing little special things for her birthday, or for holidays. Spend time with her and just really get to know who she is. Good Luck!|`|O1MITmaGaa	I'd say just take it slow and, most importantly, to respect her. I mean, you should respect everyone, but it's especially important for a potential gf. Also, be yourself. it's good to be honest. just enjoy yourself and make sure she feels comfortable being around you. don't be rude or crass, but pleasant.<br>  <br>  best of luck!
TBZK5q78aa	I agree with majority of the answers here but as a Libra male I can give you a precise answer.<br>  <br>  A Libra can be attracted to a woman and never approach her. Libra's also like testing their powers on what woman is attracted to them. Yes it's a weird habit. That does not imply that Libra's are not faithful because contrary to that Libras are very loyal in relationships.<br>  <br>  As a Libra, I find it challenging approaching a woman I have high interest for. But if I'm too hectic, then I will just come up to you or find an excuse to talk to you: math help anything... But he may be too shy to engage you. Extend your hand and show you have interest. A lot of the times, naive Libra's will let a plethora of alluring woman surpass them. So don't let that woman be you! Find an excuse to talk to him. Better yet, ask him open question like, "how many times are you going to look at me and not say nothing." This will trigger something in him and he should be a bit more eager (maybe even embarrassed) and will begin to open up a bit more. But try to flirt with him more. Make it conspicuous that you desire him.<br>  <br>  By the way, according to the zodiac, Pisces and Libra is a dreadful match. It usually start of awesome and romantic, but over time it becomes an atrocity. The relationship will last long because Libra's settle for their partners flaws, but it will be absolutely dreadful for the two of you. <br>  The reason I'm stating this is because I have experienced it. I dated a Pisces woman and it started of very passionate, but after a month it made a dreadful detour. It's probably the worst relationship I ever had.<br>  <br>  So in essence, if the two of you begin dating, watch out for infatuation. You have to have strict ground rules. There are also no room for insecurity. As long as you keep a positive mind set, this relationship can ascend. If you have doubt in your heart, this relationship will descend. <br>  <br>  So I basically gave you a time-line essence of how to handle things lol.<br>  <br>  God-bless!|`|I8iKjRkBaa	Most libra's like to indulge in the finer things, nice dinners are a weakness. They also are drawn to intelligence, a good conversation or debate about something controversial will catch his eye and his interest. Libra's are mostly open minded and able to see both points of view. He might need to know you have some depth before jumping in. Take some charge with him, you be the first to ask him out, that might just be what he's waiting for.|`|So7e7kugaa	maybe check in with his/your friends since you have friends in common and ask what they think? since they know u both they might know what he thinks (maybe he's talked about you to them or they could ask him --casually of course-- if he's interested in you..)<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  ask him out yourself ;-)<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck! <br>  -a fellow pisces|`|2c7e8c6a806e859860fb77a44becc650aa	Ask Ms. Cleo|`|4snTNQ98aa	some guys fear of rejection...maybe you should give him some sign or ask him directly is there any girl you like?|`|NQ239NgAaa	it doesnt matter wat star signs u are its just like any1 would geez|`|uYDoPNv9aa	star signs dont matter.<br>  if u are ment for each other he will ask u out no matter what star sign you are. lol|`|AA12400627	Use your intuition on this one....if you feel that he is into you.....then drop some subtle hints.....if he does not pick up on them or acts dumb....then you've got your answer.....<br>  <br>  If you feel that he did not get it, then be straightforward! Guys are not mindreaders and many of them can't take a hint!
CopTYYjQaa	Apologize to that person ,he/she will have to ask himself what did i do to this person for her/him to apologize to me.He/she will end up apologizing to you|`|qpMX2Mhxaa	Apologies are for people that need to apologise. You have nothing to apologise for.<br>  <br>  If you feel that you have some loose ends to tie up with this chap, why not leave a comment on his profile. When/if he replies, send a second message confronting him, explaining how he hurt you. It seems all you really need is closure. You won't get this by saying sorry for his mistakes.|`|W4NyrlGZaa	right i live in the uk i dont have a clue wat junior high is, i would send him a message saying something like "hi do you remember me from junior whatever hows your school" blah blah blah and just chat with him and if he says something bad just dont reply and forget him, and maybe if you keep chatting to him he may apologize. Maybe even become friends? or do you hate him??
CkAU0Tcpaa	you do what you feel is right

FmYkUfIDaa	Hi Jazmine,<br>  Sometimes when people meet it really can be 'love at first sight', There is a chemistry between them and they are by some miracle suited to and for each other.<br>  <br>  As time passes they come to the realization that they are soul-mates.<br>  <br>  It is like asking the question - "How do you know that you love someone?"<br>  <br>  Answer: When you wish for them everything that you wish for yourself, except that you wish it for them before yourself. In simple language, you are totally and unselfishly lovingly disposed to the other person.<br>  <br>  It is an unfailing love by one for the other. It is never conditional and totally unselfish. It is a beautiful gift to have and to give.|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	. . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-‘”. . . . . . . . . .``~.,<br>  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-”. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .“-.,<br>  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ”:,<br>  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,<br>  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}<br>  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}<br>  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:”. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .“~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./<br>  . . . . . . /(_. . ”~,_. . . ..“~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/<br>  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .”=,_. . . .“-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~”; /. .. .}<br>  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .”=-._. . .“;,,./`. . /” . . . ./. .. ../<br>  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..“~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../<br>  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-”<br>  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\<br>  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__<br>  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,<br>  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _\. . . . . ._,-%. . . ..`\<br>  <br>  <br>  It's a romantic notion that has no basis in reality|`|66Mjr1F8aa	Soul-mates are when you feel a great connection to that person, being able to be yourself around him, knowing he'll ALWAYS be there for you. Soul mates are when you can see that person and look in there eyes and know this is true love. you will need to be 110% sure you love him. if not it's not real. hope i helped!!
NUMBHdgfaa	Sounds like  you two are both in the same situation.  What do you mean by "like"?  Did he tell you he liked you?  If so then thats a pretty strong indicator that he likes you.  Even flirts are embarassed to say that they really like somebody.|`|lXJQ27k0aa	Tell the truth exactly.|`|I3mo7alVaa	I think so. Me being a guy I have done what he is doing to you but of course with a different girl. She as well did the same back. But is their anything coming up soon? Take him somewhere like the movies an event or a show. Get to know him a lot because you don't want to fall in love to soon and something bad happen where it can crush your heart. (God forbid if that happens) I hope it doesn't cause it sucks. But really just get to know him and pray to god if he is the right one or not.<br>  <br>  And as my Pastor says - Don't find love let it find you so you end up with the right guy.<br>  <br>  So if he started to flirt with you first then girl you better get him before someone else do lol.|`|I8iKjRkBaa	Act like you don't like him or even cares if he is around at all. Boys like a little bit of a chase. If he really likes you, then it will bother him and he will show you more attention.|`|I2gs5opxaa	its nice to be friends see him when u can talking at times helps to but u know how he is so its look lisin and learn be wise as to how u feel as well.|`|79aZQf4qaa	what the **** is a flirt? sounds like a sex term|`|J9Heg6Qiaa	well, if I were him I liked you if I constantly flirting with you.<br>  If I asked you out that means I like you.<br>  <br>  hmm...if ever he says again that you two should be going out response instantly with enthusiasm...but not too much ok...tell him ok when do you want? (have guts to say that...after all you like this guy like you never liked anyone...ryt?)|`|7DkHGVzEaa	you should mention ur ages. Any way what did u mean by <br>  "he always seems to mention that"<br>  if he can't say it may coz of fear of rejection or rxn of u <br>  coz of nature of u <br>  if u r young may be it just matter of shyness <br>  <br>  u could smile at him. that give good expression of acceptance <br>  thank U<br>  i hope i helped|`|Be6oUPd5aa	ive had this happen to me with this girl i like right now. Shes a horrible flirt. I say horrible cause she flirts to the point where you like her but turns you down, and yet she keeps flirting. i hope your guy isnt like that in the end =/
LLbOdAqjaa	he is just hurt.<br>  <br>  He wants you to feel some of the pain you put him through.<br>  <br>  Give him some space for a few days to a week.<br>  <br>  ..I broke up with my boyfriend because i had to and he told me to stop calling him etc. and then 2 months later it was his birthday and i sent him a Happy Birthday text and he said thank you asked how i was doing and we began talking again.<br>  <br>  Later i found out that even though he siad he didnt want to talk to me... he always still hoped that he would get a text from me or a phonecall...<br>  <br>  and for quite a while he didnt let me forget that i hurt him.<br>  <br>  <br>  So just like my boyfriend.. yours wants you to feel some guilt and pain.<br>  <br>  Hopefully soon you can find a right time to talk to him...and tell him you are very sorry and maybe you can atleast meet up and see if you re kindle your love<br>  <br>  because if he sees you...itll be harder for him to reject.|`|IrfbapHAaa	dude what a dick.<br>  but nawww. <br>  he doesn't like you.<br>  sorry.|`|zUdxoRbyaa	send him a card. cant hurt.

w5kQ98Fxaa	If you're also in track, go up to her and ask to borrow something.. A spanner to tighten the spikes on your shoes, a drink of her water..<br>  <br>  And thank her if she gives it to you. Say you've seen her around before. Ask her name. Ask her if she likes track. Complain about the coach. Talk about an upcoming meet & what she thinks of the opposition. Try not to let the conversation become question-answer-question-answer. Look for something in her answers that you could make into a conversation.|`|GjKMUIpIaa	u have a mouth, right. USE IT
8x3e7Gmjaa	i personally dont care for the sex after marriage line.....  i believe love has no boundaries, and should be expressed whenever the timing feels right.  anything can happen to the person you love from teh time you fall in love to the time you actually get married.. why run the risk..  i remember a story on the news some months ago about a highway overpass that collapsed killing a newlyweds husband....  they had just been married and he was killed in a freak accident.   the thing is, you never know what will happen tomorrow,a nd you should express your love to that person when you feel the urge.  youre never promised tomorrow.  <br>  <br>  yeah its true sex is just mainly a lust thing not many do it for love, soem do it thinking they are in love, and some really are in it for the love..  its harder to find the latter, but thats what makes the journey worth it.|`|bw2izUoraa	i really dont think theres anything wrong with sex before marrage. and ya it is prettu casual<br>  <br>  my own opinion is that there is less chnce of cheating if you do "experiment" with more then just your spouse (before marraige of coarse)|`|AA11383122	i think you should wait. I lost my virginity early and later on was really depressed cause it wasn't with someone i loved or even liked. Wait until you find that person that you really love.|`|xEmIhOc3aa	i agree w/ you sex is very special and shouldnt be given out ...regularly......im 17 an dnt have a bf yet...and ..i think...hmmm i guess until marriage is ok...<br>  <br>  <br>  sorry my answer would have been more detailed and stuff but its 3;am  lol|`|dY6LA7Txaa	hmm sex should be something that should be done with that special person. It doesnt matter when you have it . so longs as its with the right person then nothing else matters|`|d36OrpbDaa	don't have sex just to have it.  make sure you're in a stable, caring relationship.  hopefully in love, but sometimes it's hard to know if you are in love, so that may or may not be necessary for you.<br>  <br>  don't make such a personal decision based on what society thinks.  make that decision for yourself, and based on your circumstances.  don't lose it just to lose it.  make sure you find a girl that you really care about, that cares about you, and that is understanding that you want to save it until you are ready and until you know the person is into you for more than just sex.<br>  <br>  it's so much better when it's with someone you really care about.  don't waste it just to say you did it.|`|zWiU19BWaa	Don't do it. Once you do, there's no going back. When you have it, it'll be great, but after you'll realize that that was stupid to do and you'll feel stupid. Trust me and don't do it.|`|Ey8iUDo1aa	if you love a person and willing to spend the life with that person go ahead but who said god dosent like to have fun enjoy yourself you only live once my man but when you do wera protection no babies unless you want|`|du5MNrQ6aa	How does it get more valuable the longer you save it?

After we broke up, I still believed in it for a while... but when I was 19, I found myself on a one-night-stand somehow.  After that, I had sex with like 12 different women in a three year period.<br>  Bottom line is, the opportunity is going to present itself sooner or later and you will have to make the decision to let it go, or keep it special for your marriage. Personally, I respect the decision to wait, but I say go ahead and enjoy yourself...  Just be smart about it!!|`|7bcQ9Xemaa	sex isn't some magical thing, people forget we're mammals. sex is meant for procreation not some huge important thing to keep to yourself for just the right person on a special night. why we turned it into such a thing, i'll never know.<br>  <br>  think about it.|`|sSM8z52Maa	i was raised on the sex after marriage thing to. It is best if you save it for when your married. It will have more value and meaning to you later on.|`|QKM3NLmaaa	in the end, it all goes away, so might as well bang it up before your time comes.|`|C7Ehw7Kdaa	if it feels right why not? thats my reasoning|`|AA10690878	I personally do not believe that waiting until marriage to have sex is a good idea. You will understand more about what I'm talking about as you gain more sexual experiences, but you can very much adore someone and still not be able to have great sex. It is overly romantic to suggest that sex will be amazing simply because you love one another. And I believe you MUST have a healthy sex life in order to stay happily married.<br>  <br>  I take GREAT EXCEPTION to your statement that sex in our society does not have much meaning behind it. Even a one-night stand can be an emotionally intense experience. The stereotype is that two singles can hook up at a bar and bang away for the sake of an orgasm, but that's bull. You are emotionally baring yourself to someone every time you have sex. You are showing them who you are. And you are showing them what your sexual predilections are, which says a lot about what kind of person you are psychologically.<br>  <br>  Look, your first experience might very well suck, my friend. A lot of ours did. But the world is full of women that will want to know you on that deep of an emotional level. So go show them.|`|Eug52iQDaa	What's the rush?  You've remained a virgin this long, so stick with it.  <br>  <br>  Look, sex can be great, but truly, it's a very private thing that you share with the one you love.  Casual sex isn't what it's cracked up to be.  Love makes all the difference.<br>  <br>  I admire you for sticking to your principles.  Not many people do that these days.
uSPAw89faa	First of all, how long have you been together? If a short time, take her on a short trip like Hawaiian Gardens (a suburb of L.A) or a close by bed and breakfast in your area. If a long time, ask her if she like tropical places or skiing, then pick. Hope that helps.|`|QQhKa4fdaa	your bed

0bae6f6117c8017281b80e06ee9926b1aa	I don't personally know how she is, but sounds like she's never gonna change until she's gone through the things that she's put others through. Sad to say but maybe you dumping her or taking a break is gonna make her realize that your that "perfect" guy who will treat her right. Some people go through that stage of playing the field, and maybe she's not quite ready to settle down for something real. "you don't know what you got, until it's gone". I went through something similar and he was my first love too, I eventually broke it off with him and a year and a half later he told me he made a huge mistake. Number one question you should ask yourself is do you trust her, could you trust her with a guy friend alone? If not then I think you know what you gotta do. Go with your gut, never doubt what your heart might be telling you. I hope this helps, and good luck =]|`|wGL2A3C8aa	Try falling in love with a responsible, trustworthy girl.

You need to see a marriage counsellor.|`|7fa275a0b219d341645d003c4f5add6baa	You both need to sit down and talk about this. If you don't it will just get worse. You need communication in a marriage to make it work. You need to tell him how you feel and figure out a way to compromise and get things back on track.|`|AcPq4Qd8aa	Because hes a man. All men moan about work, unless they can spend the rest of the night in the pub!|`|eXwnWqROaa	It sounds to me you are in a relationship that has gone sour. If you are really that unhappy then you should tell him how you are feeling. If he decides not to react upon this information then you have serious problems. If you Still love your partner then maybe you should seek counselling for both of you. The thing is you are not being selfish you just are not appreciating each other as you should and could be. My partner talks about work a Lot to and that includes moaning!!!.. but i feel that this is balanced out because we have such a close bond with one another in other parts of our relationship. You really have to tell him the problem because he probably doesn't even realise how much this effects you if you dont talk.|`|YtE7YXJWaa	Hi Betty<br>  You need to tell him to leave work at work as its not helping either of you.

That's my guess anyway.|`|a6j7Bu9daa	why dont you work and he look after the kids.|`|5af8PNwxaa	Sorry...I think you may be the one feeling self absorbed.<br>  <br>  Sounds like he hates his job, he probably won't leave as he feels obligated because your sister introduced him and if he leaves it may cause problems between you and your sister (ie meaning she may feel unappreciated because she got him the role).   <br>  <br>  He is also probably thinking at this moment, with the job market (ie putting people out of jobs) he should be staying whilst this job is secure and there are the kids and your not working helping to bring in extra money for the household (ie not sure how old your kids are??) and then there are the bills. This is why he is miserable, feeding his face, going to the bathroom to try and relax because he is so wound up, not getting the sleep he needs to be productive at work as you say with your snoring (ie meaning have you seen a doctor about this to correct as this can also effect your health?).   <br>  <br>  Yes, he shows an interest in sex on holidays as he is relaxed, away from work...you don't need to be a rocket scientist to work this out.<br>  <br>  Please, don't try and boost him up...let him talk, ask him about work and let him blow off steam, wind down.<br>  <br>  If you don't listen,I don't mean to overact here as I think he is crying out for someone to listen, you may find him in the bath with slashed wrists, etc.<br>  <br>  If he can't talk to you, he may need to seek help from a counsellor / psychiatrist, getting everything off his chest before he has a breakdown as he is feeling pressured.|`|6LamNmHsaa	yeah my brother is the same so hard you try he still moans it i told him don't bring work to home. but sometime discussions is necessary for guidance. just sit together calmly cause my brother looses his tempo when discuss it. its out of respect what i am saying Your husband been pampered all its life meaning protective shell by his parents. i know cause my brother is the same he has a child and a daughter as well. Main thing your husband needs confidence let him be independent for a change let make some decisions i guess he always ask before making one give him some authority then he will see some changes in him. I hop that helps its only me.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Your husband sounds like he is really unhappy with his job, as you can tell.  You need to seriously sit down and talk with him about it.  Be honest with him and tell him how you feel and how he is making you feel.  I sense that he feels trapped by his job and by you.  If he wasn't married, with children to support, he would probably leave his job but feels he can't with all his responsibilities.  That is why he comes home going on and on about his miserable job, he is subconsciously letting you know he feels trapped.  He also sounds like he may be suffering from depression and needs help.  This is affecting your marriage.  Attitude is everything and affects everything, including a marriage and a job.  He needs an attitude adjustment.  Offer to go to work and let him sit with the kids, if that is feasible.  Above all, be honest with each other before this destroys your marriage.  I will be praying for you, and good luck.|`|fePQ12Rfaa	I think you are selfish and ungrateful. It sounds like he is working his socks off to feed cloth and keep his family, including his Wife!<br>  <br>  I suggest you go out get a job to support the whole family, including your Husband and then see who is the bigger moaner.|`|AF8JWedEaa	cause your not putting out..<br>  EH, PACHA!|`|zKkMzjvUaa	I have been married for 15 years and my husband has moaned every day about work. I have tried spoiling him (favourite meal etc), sitting down and trying to talk to him and listen to him. Offered to swap job roles so he could stay at home and look after our daughter. Asked if there was someone else, or was he bored with me. After 15 years of this believe me the man just likes moaning and I think you should just let him carry on because there is a certain breed of man that isn't happy unless he is moaning. Instead of worrying about it, embrace it and find yourself outside interests so you don't have to look at his miserable face every night. It will give him something else to moan about and in a perverse sort ot way, you'd be helping him to be happy. Works for me!!

CHCPnvksaa	it sounds like either she is really inexperienced or she's selfish and just wants sex her way. One of the best things about sex is the experimentation. You can't expect her to be a porn star every night. No woman is, but she needs to exert some effort. I would tell her that there are some things that you'd like to try with her and that you'd like her to at least consider it. She'll never know what she really likes till she gives it a shot. If she doesn't go for it, then sorry to say, but the two of you just aren't sexually compatible. She needs to realize that if she won't try the kinky stuff, there are plenty of other women out there who will.<br>  And contrary to what some people have said on here, your desires are not abnormal.

I am going to criticize you for your betterment.<br>  I think, your GF is absolutely normal but you have some abnormal sexual desires. I think you watch too many pornographic films and read such novels. Look, a girl look for caring guy rather than a macho guy. If you behave nicely, talk nicely, care for her, this pleasure will be more than orgasm to her. I think she is getting along well should it a normal sexual intercourse, but since your fantasies are abnormal and you want to bering reel life into real life, so her dislike is quite normal.

She also wishes death on her mother, probably because she is hurting. She basically feels the same way about her mother that her kids feel about her. It's a bad cycle. Maybe she learned her ways from her mother? Your nieces n nephews will come around, the truth always comes out. Just keep praying for them and try to keep your distance from her, she seems toxic

Move on with your life you simpleton|`|AA10494978	COMMUNICATE!  Why is it so hard for people to understand that concept?!  If you have any hope for putting your marriage back together, you have to communicate with your ex - that means, grow up and have an adult conversation with him.  Tell him what you have been through.  Will he get mad?  Probably, if he is sane he will.  This is not something you can work out between lunch and dinner, if you already got a divorce, you guys have some serious issues to work out.  Before you even contemplate any kind of a reconciliation, you need some marriage therapy.  Soon.  <br>  <br>  But regardless of what you do - do not put your child in harm's way.  If you have a boyfriend and your child lives with you, yes, that is putting your child in harm's way.  I understand you are 21 - but I don't care for that excuse.  You chose to bring that child into the world, he didn't ask you to.  Now you have a responsability to take care of him - that means, you work your ... whatever... off to give that child a home so he can have a chance at normal life. If you are about to ask, what about my life?  You gave up that right when your child was born.  Now you have something more important to worry about.  Kids need a mommy and a daddy.  That means, get rid of your d*ck boyfriend, go to counseling with your ex and see if you can put your marriage back together.  Quit playing these selfish games with your child's future.  Good luck to you.<br>  <br>  Update: OK, relax.  You can get through this.  Tell your ex you are willing to work thorugh whatever it takes to put your family back together.  First, you need transportation.  If this was your first DUI (please don't say your BF made you do it, that is pathetic - you are a grown person, how can he make you do anything) contact an attorney specializing in DUI cases.  You can get a DL to go to and from work and certainly to visit your child.  If your BF is telling you you can't leave the house (again, are you a kid or an adult?!) you stand up for yourself.  If he gets abusive, you call 911.  Why is a seemingly smart, competent and caring mother not doing what it takes to get her life back together?  Just do it.  Get your act together, and show your ex that you can do it by moving on.  You are relying on your BF to give you a home, so his expectation is that you are there to take care of his kids.  You can't blame him for that.  But, I also want to tell you to stop blaming yourself.  Did you make a mistake?  Yeah... Thank you Captain Obvious.  But now you have to suck it up, get cranking on getting your life together and start by finding out how you can get a temporary DL to start going to work.  Your BF will just have to figure out how to take care of his kids.  Your family is waiting for you.  Get to work.  When you feel down, like you do tonight, think of your child.  He needs you to be there.  Good luck to you.|`|kV9GlWDFaa	i understand your pain. this is a shitty situation to have to be in loosing a license is quite pricey and without a job then that is kinda difficult as well. with a child being involved this is just messy. i feel you shouldn't be so dependent on this ex. he might have it all now but you don't need him. you miss your old life because it seems way better than the one you have now. the difference is this is your life now and you have complete control over it. dump the loser boyfriend get a dependable friend!!! and get a job.

o4F1v1mqaa	I agree with Dr. R.<br>  <br>  If he truly loves you then u gaining 12lbs shouldn't be an issue. It's not like u gained 100 or something. It'd be different if that were the case, but its not. 120's NOT A BAD WEIGHT TO BE!<br>  <br>  But I think you should also ask ur bf why it obviously bothers him so much.<br>  <br>  Remember it's not what on the outside but the inside. lol|`|ocIsJXHGaa	he probably wants you to take care of yourself better, you dont wanna weight 300 lbs by the time you get married!|`|4qL7oRrVaa	I'd laugh at him, honestly.|`|GdPCE9wbaa	The person who love you will accept you the way you look, he wont say you to change you for him<br>  <br>  If you are over weight means he will tell you to reduce your weight for you good sake.

vn2Lq7hIaa	The street prostitute is the bottom rung on the prostitute ladder. The local girls and others are out on their own.They have men and boy friends in their lives, not regarded as pimps but living off the avails of prostitution Most often these guys are alcoholics, drug addicts, or thieves, they don't work and are probably collecting a welfare cheque each month.<br>  <br>  The girls are for the most part out there to support their hard drug habit, as well as the guys they live with. The sharing of needles and unprotected sex has resulted in many contracting the Aids virus and being infected with S.T.D.s.<br>  <br>  If a new girl (or girls) appear on the street with the regulars, in all probability she / they   are being pimped. It's common practice for pimps to move their harem of ladies in a circuit of several different cities for 2 to 3 months at a time, or bring them in when large amount of foreign visitors are expected. Many of them will also collect welfare for the period they are in each city.<br>  <br>  The pimps handle all the money they receive and supply them with the necessities as well as drugs. If they are not the goldbags they used to be they are left on some cities street, they don't know anyone they are broke, homeless, hungry, drug addicted with only the clothes they wear. The rest of the harem moves on to the next stop. Some pimps trade women, it's a different girl to screw or the pimp may have laid a beating on her and now wants her gone, even though she is a good producer. Pimps stick together on most issues, so she will not be treated well by him either. <br>   <br>  The girls working escort agencies are better off when it comes to pay,<br>  working conditions and the clients they service, but have some not so <br>  easy rules to work with too.<br>  <br>  It's A Tough Life, And Many Die Long Before They Should.  So...........<br>  Don't Take Your Love To Town Dear,  Leave Your Love At Home.<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|3FoU68xuaa	Guess there is no one answer to this question because it depends on the girl..I mean some work independently and some work for pimps/escort companies/whatever..and usually if they are working for a pimp, it's kind of common knowledge/rumor that they are rarely nice to them..they don't respect themselves so how could they expect anyone else to respect them either? It's not a job where one would get treated nicely because they are pretty classless and low so it's not a job that commands respect, if you think about it. and they act and look slutty because they ARE..they are selling sex and the idea of it as well, so they have to put themselves out there and let it be known! How else would it work?|`|XOlnc8iBaa	I was a prostitute for years in my twenties and I did it out of self hatred and power. I hated men, they had raped me, and lied to me so I thought using them for money was a way to get back at them, only to find myself stripped of my soul. I know girls who hook, and they have pimps, or they don't. They do it for drugs mostly, but a lot are single mums, their bf has dumped them and does not pay them for the kids, so they have no choice in one way as hooking is a quick way to make money. They could go to school, get a job, but they hate who they are, they feel worthless and they are in a place I have been and never want to visit again. Have some empathy, don't judge, the world isn't always kind and some have no family, love, or guidance, and get lost along the way.|`|O1MITmaGaa	I recently watched a CNBC episode, I believe, on prostitution, cept it was "High-end Prostitution." Anyway, same idea.<br>  <br>  to answer your last question, why do they do this, it's for the money. they need it, and that's the easiest and most accessible way to get it, I believe it is. plus, some of them are drug addicts, which drives them even more to continue their work. they act slutty because prostitutes are for sex, whereas in other forms of prostitution, such as where girls are "escorts," the girls act as companions for men to talk to and enjoy the company of. there are different lines of work, apparently.<br>  <br>  I have no info on how the system with pimps works. all I know's from that explanation on TV|`|AA11485682	Some women sell themselves of their own free will. Others do it for their pimps. Some go into it because they want to and think it'll be easy. Others turn to it because they need the money and don't have anywhere else to go. Some pimps might be nice, many are not. They act the way they think men want them to, as they want men to buy sex from them.|`|IXskJPlVaa	Depends on location - In Thailand it is a accepted profession. In India - it is a bad profession to be in. In the end no one can ever like it as there is nothing in it other than quick money and the girl is a living person - even if she likes it initially - after a time all hate the profession as the worst thing to have happened to anybody. Best of luck.|`|I2gs5opxaa	theres there old saying in everyone is diffrent where some ladys will do anything to live get by earn money to and theres ladys who have way to much pride no matter what, yess the ladys who prostitute mostly hooked into it can be harder to get out  of cose theres some who learn the hard way and some are not so lucky.
I3mo7alVaa	I have the same problem but I found out a way to get me through it.<br>  <br>  Hope I can help somehow but always keep in mind that it is bad to find love but to let it find you. Because if you go out looking for it you might end up with he wrong person. <<< I hope it don't happen to you.<br>  <br>  But I can say pray to god and ask him if she is the right one, if you get a funny feeling or some type of awkward sign then congrats. It's good to do this because god has someone special for everyone and well she might be the one he has for you. As time goes one and your friendship turns outstanding then I think it would be the best time to tell her how you truly feel.|`|4b644d3e9fa1328649e31b2870d579ccaa	Well, you better give her a "Belated Happy Valentine's Day" gift.

Sure enough he felt the same way. But... he told me that no matter how he felt i would never lose his friendship and thats true. If she is a true friend nothing will change. Just tell her how you feel and who knows she may feel the same.

That's just my opinion though.|`|iWcXFF38aa	Seriously I wouldn't put so much thought into it. From what you are saying, it seems as if this is a guy who is serious about committing to you.  I think it's just a matter a time that he pops the question, but from what you indicated, you're not in a rush either. And it almost sounds that you have some concerns about the whole idea yourself.<br>  <br>  Why not enjoy what you have with him fully with where you all are today, and from what I see you appear to be in a very good place. Don't taint a seemingly satisfying relationship with presumptions about the future.  And if you are so concerned about it, discuss it with him.  <br>  <br>  And when the wedding proposal does happen, let it be a wonderfully pleasant surprise.

You shouldn't have jump to the conclusion in the first place. You should have talked to her instead! If this got you into a deep hole the only thing to do is to tell her the truth.

7orOPW5daa	Well sometimes guys ejaculate little bits o sperm during sex.  So she could end up prego.  It all really matters if the expression you used "first five seconds"... was it really only the first five seconds or was it more like the first five minutes?  That could really make a big difference.  Also, it's irresponsible not to urinate and then wash that entire area after sex, and your friend sounds pretty irresponsible, so she probably didn't do that, which increases the chance for pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Other than that, your friend could now have AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, HPV, herpes, crabs, a yeast infection, a urinary tract infection, or any combination of these diseases and infections.  You should do your friend a favor and go to Planned Parenthood with her.  Ask them to give you both the inoculation for HPV, and then let her get herself checked out.  You would be doing it to convince her to go, and honestly it wouldn't hurt for you to go... eventually you are going to try out sex.  You would get the vaccine for HPV out of the way and help your friend protect herself.|`|iq7ZHua6aa	There is no guarantee that she is not pregnant.<br>  Also she could have STD passed on from her boyfriend.|`|bFF02ezDaa	it souldnt but she is to young wat should i be saying im 13 and had it...lol any ways i had it with a guy my age thow not 2 years oldder!!!!!
k6mYgCBXaa	In my opinion the fact that he is still angry is a good sign. Sounds crazy, but it is true. The opposite of love is not hate, it is indifference. So the odds that he still cares are in your favor as long as he is NOT indifferent.    It wasn't clear to me in your post if you two are still a confirmed couple or if you have seperated and are considering divorce? So, I am uncertain how to respond to the other issues you presented. If you two are broken up and he is looking at other women wondering about them that is MUCH different than if you two are still together and he does this infront of you!    Clarify and I will come back and check your post. Until then you may find the following site helpful on how to avoid a divorce.    http://www.urlfreeze.com/WA/Save_Your_Lo...|`|C0GeEv7kaa	You just need to sit down and speak with your husband about exactly how he feels about your relationship. Before my husband and I were married, we realized that we needed time apart so we split. After only 2 months he realized that he couldn't live without me and he drove 2 1/2 hours to pick me and all of my stuff up, a week later we were married.     Instead of confiding in others, you need to confide in your husband. Find out what he wants. What happens to your relationship is the responsibility of the both of you. Good luck.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	You need to sit down with him and have a heart-to-heart on the present and future. You cannot crash through a brick wall and the marriage may be at that point. But marriage is not "friendship," it goes much deeper, and if both of you have drifted apart it may be time to move away from the wall and take different paths in this finite journey of life.|`|iM2BaJbeaa	When you cant even say you are friends anymore then it is over, the friend ship is where it begins and the friendship is the last thing to go.|`|ugNH8FMYaa	I think this is very common, and I thik you need couples counseling so a professional can show you the way.    I've been w/ my husband 7 yrs and no matter what, before calling it quits I'd give counseling a try.     As for angry words, there ARE ways to fight fairly & throwing hurtful things around are not it. Just bc we're angry doesn't mean we can't get our point across in a constructive manner. Maybe he needs to acknowledge this and try counseling for anger management as well.|`|AA10986891	I say you can leave your marriage when you are able to leave and have no regrets when you look back.|`|2fSCAmLiaa	When YOU have so many doubts  it sounds  more like habit than love,talk to someone who knows both of you well good luck|`|dzyJw0cvaa	I think you may be in a marital rut.  Feelings have changed, because obviosuly you didnt get married because he treated you like this.  TALK TO HIM.  Sit him down and tell him all that you are feeling.  Avoid making him feel defensive by saying things like, "You do this" and "You make me angry." Instead use the words, "I feel" before you say something.      You both NEED marriage counseling.  Things will not likely get better without the help of a professional.     If he is not willing to help you with this or to go to counseling, if he is not willing to try, then its over.    A marriage is only really truly over when one person simply has no ambition to try anymore.    Good luck.  I really hope things get better for you.

69GgJhnWaa	.....Right. So, I hate to burst your bubble, but I doubt he would allow his girlfriend to leave a magazine full of naked men in his room. I'm pretty sure that the magazine is there completely of his own volition. Did you ever think that maybe he quit going to church and is "off" because he's gay and since your obviously religious is afraid of the response your family will have towards him? Just because he has a girlfriend does not mean he is straight. He may just be dating her in an attempt to make himself straight or make himself appear straight. That sounds like a more likely conclusion than the one you've drawn. And as for the pregnancy thing, he's going to do what he wants, so just make sure he does it safely and uses condoms.|`|HtfqFgEgaa	First tell him he is important to the church and he needs to bring his girl friend.

Sorry.  Really, I think you have run into one of those guys who has trouble sorting through his feelings, what is a friend and who do I want to have sex with.  Too many guys have the feeling that if you have a friend of the opposite sex, that it means you can have sex with her but once you have sex with her they can't put you back as just a friend, their dirty little minds still want to have sex with you.  The reason they say that sex can ruin a good friendship, there's so many emotions involved.|`|q3J6JQdcaa	most guys take girls that dump them or they dump the girls as a "not going any further" situation. so i doubt he would want to date you again. also most girls get jealous of female friends and especially past girlfriends, so if he just started dating a girl he probably just doesnt want to risk trouble by also hanging out with you.<br>  dont take offence at his actions, when he gets more settled with this girl try to make more contact but make sure shes in it so she doesnt think anything of you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|b2444f35a7f9696e20acbb1687b47466aa	The only women from my past which I DO NOT want to have anything to do with are the ones I got DIVORCED from. <br>  <br>  I have no problems being friends with the girls I just dated. <br>  ======================================...|`|dvA9ttLIaa	Some guys are different.

Personally I never use that word. Did you break up with him? Because if you did he may realize what he had was amazing and it's gone.

Talk to her, make her feel good and do something with her like go to the movies or go play in the arcades, whatever. Just make sure she's having fun. <br>  <br>  Also tell her not to trust everybody to tell her life story, cos not many people would actually care and take more advantage of her. She has to step up her game in life and become more tougher and a fighter. <br>  <br>  You can be her boyfriend to her, which is sweet and take it easy on it ok? she may not want to at first because of her past relationships and would be able to trust you.

Since when is sleeping with someone a one way activity?  If she accepts to sleep with you is because she finds an advantage in doing that too! <br>  On the other hand, if she trusts you her secrets is because there is probably a certain harmony in your relationship...and, she accepts to tell you the secrets too! <br>  Naturally if she has been hurt a lot, and "used" she expects something different from you by telling you her past experiences.<br>  Since she seems to be pretty open when communicating with you, you should do the same. Make sure she is also interested in having a relationship with you beyond friendship.<br>  So, talk to her, tell her how you feel too! Tell her that you can see how she was hurt and that you do not want to do the same. <br>  On the other hand, why would you have a "moral" problem if you are not going to use her?|`|PxqcLkw1aa	I think you answered you own question.

Spend some time really getting to know her and you will know when it's the right time to take your relationship to the next level.|`|Oh9BnXezaa	you just need to be truthful with her for starters, then if u really like her, u need to let her no that u would like to be her boyfriend, and then see where it goes... if she wants to sleep with you and yo don't end it afterwards then there is nothing wrong with that, as long as you are doing it for the right reasons....<br>  <br>  you need to tell her how you feel...<br>  <br>  hope this helps...x|`|3389acc7fbe9dbba8ee2124559e992ecaa	ask her out. ask her if she wants to be your gf.<br>  if yes sleep with her. if no dont sleep with her.|`|AA11284982	dont do it man other wise your no different then the guys she has screwed.|`|lTsONvwQaa	Tell her what you just told us. and see how she feels about it.

As you're the Sagittarius guy, yeah you do need to have freedom with yourself alone or with friends and she must make sure she understands your needs too as well as you with her. <br>  <br>  She might feel insecure and moody at times and basically it's just the way it is for Cancer girls, so either you talk to her calm way or don't and move away for a little while until she feels better. <br>  <br>  Just needs a little understanding for both each others needs and more communication, though Cancer girl hate confrontation, and solve your ways to create a better relationship, i'm sure you Cancer woman does not wanna break up and wanna works things out with you, so sit her down and smooth things out.<br>  <br>  It's not too late..|`|Jsy1xsL1aa	Either the centaur or the archer are the best signs of sagittarius.

K2QwEM4raa	In the US only half of what you saved or brought together after you married. Most of the time what was yours and what was his before marriage stays with that person. In your country it might be different so you will have to contact a lawyer.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	2 years?..........what a waste of time. For the sake of you baby why not put in one last effort and seek some couples counseling?<br>  <br>  You would be entitled to half of anything accumulated during the marriage.<br>  You will also be entitled to child support.<br>  <br>  There may be a chance that you could get a very small percentage of his half of the flat, but it is unlikely as you were only married for 2 years.|`|onbwN4csaa	You should be ENTITLED to half the value of his half<br>  of the flat. half of all savings / checking accts. and half the value of all other assets.<br>  Plus child support.|`|yVIb7zjiaa	You are entitled to anything that was gotten after you  were married.You will not be entitled for the 200 pounds because  paying bills is not an asset.Now you can get  him for child support after you are divorced.|`|mYkinxsQaa	If there's no prenup, you are entitled to half of what BOTH of you earned AFTER getting married but check your local laws and speak with an attorney. I wish you the best.|`|xGI9z01Maa	You have to look at the law for your area.  In California, you would get half of everything that your husband owned after 2 years of marriage including the bills that you had together but the amount you transferred would not count as something that he had to get you back.  But each state and country is different.  See a lawyer. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you take custody of the child.  You should get child support.   <br>  <br>  For the baby sake, try to be reasonable.  You have to see him for the rest of your child's life.  You will be together for wedding, school events and other things.  Fighting over some items just makes those events more hell in the long run.  If possible, work something out together before you go to a lawyers.  When they get involved, a $5 plate can cost $300 in court cost and lawyer bills and hurt feelings in the long run that can not be fixed.  But if you can't agree, get someone in to work with you both before you hurt each other.  Your main goal now is to make sure that you and he can have a partnership for the child's sake if not a full marriage.|`|08IaFoRgaa	This is a legal question and you should protect yourself by contacting an attorney as soon as possible.  Much of this answer will depend upon the laws in the area in which you live.  If you have the proper documentation showing the use of the 200 pounds I believe you might have a case.  My best advice is -  See an Attorney right away.<br>  MY FRIEND MILDRED SENT ME

son2d5G1aa	Yea, don't go back to the store to see him! It would kinda seem desperate...but, just wait and see what happens. Look him up on myspace or something. If he doesn't contact you just move on:)|`|wcDy86xuaa	Ditch the guy and buy a LuvSak, they are amazing!|`|40e5418b0213652de2f223c98fb34338aa	NO!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't go back, you would look despreate.   you already made the first move now all you can do is wait.   if you don't hear back from him then maybe " he's just not that into you".|`|f4575b9658ad5a72f847375a828570c9aa	Well, maybe he was busy & didn't have a chance to call you?  If he doesn't call you by the weekend then I would say he isn't interested or possibly has a girlfriend?  I would have thought he would of called already so it wouldn't be awkward.  Did he say I'll give you a call or just take the number?  You could I guess pass by the store again, but I wouldn't keep going in there.  You don't want to look desperate or like a stalker.  Maybe have your guy friend go back in there & say "hey, did you ever give my friend a call from the other day?"  Good luck!|`|aZsyxJ5Gaa	i should be given best answer for reading this long *** question/article...

bIchmrdaaa	Do not tell her Bf, it may cause a problem.If she wants to tell him she will do it on her own terms. You should not get involved. What if it were you? Things do happen you know. She probably kissed the guy cause she is attracted to him it does not mean that she loves him.|`|IQiseLlHaa	If it was just a peck on the lips, this could cause more harm than good if you told her boyfriend. It sounds like you were all having fun together dancing and she sounds like she regrets doing what she did.<br>  <br>  Maybe what would be a better thing to do would be to let her know how much you think her boyfriend is good for her, and that you don't like the idea of her not appreciating him? Honesty and openness is always best but she should be the one to talk to her boyfriend if it's really necessary.

I know telling you to talk to him or ask him out is out of the question because most girls can be shy and what not so I'll resort to this. The very least you could do that will take minimal effort and courage is to just say hi to every Asian guy you think is cute and this will not only build your self-confidence but it will also make the Asian guys wonder, hey what's up with this girl being so friendly and all?

7RbootLlaa	You still have your whole life ahead of you. If you want to stay off the drugs, stay away from your old friends and if your ex knew you were on drugs and did nothing about it, she wasn't a friend either. It's best to keep away from her too. Stick with your dating and try and get a job, go back to school/college or help out at a homeless shelter, this will keep your mind occupied. When your mind is not occupied, people tend to dwell on stuff that is irrelevant. So keep your mind active with positive thoughts.

pLkeooJ1aa	Dude..... this sounds like that movie "The Cable Guy"..... just a little.....<br>  <br>  Well, I don't know the whole situation, but chances are, if there IS any chance, call him out on his douchebaggery behavior.<br>  <br>  Tell him that armpits don't belong in the faces of others. "You don't see me shoving my armpit in your face, do you?"<br>  <br>  As far as the needy phone calls, if you ignore him for the majority of them and answer when you're ready to talk, blow it off like it's no big deal. If he calls you on not answering your phone, tell him you have other things going on, but you're not ignoring him.<br>  <br>  Sounds like he's happy to have a friend and if looking to impress with macho behavior. If you like the guy, cool. If not, pull out now before it gets crazy.|`|1UiYpUWiaa	give him the cold shoulder, tell him your busy you have stuff to do, put on a cold emotionless face  when hes talking, make accuses for not having time for him,  sooner or later he should get the point and by then there will be a big enough distant between the tow of you so it won't feel completely weird.
gjtdLPIYaa	girls these days will most likely lie about it so there really isn't a point to ask. i have seen so many girls lie to their boyfriend about being a virgin . the only way to find out is to look and see if she has a hymen. and the thing about "well she could of lost it from horse back riding or from sports. is highly unlikely. so don't believe it.|`|iq7ZHua6aa	To be 100% sure, you need to ask.|`|9q8loqqxaa	dont listen to him. "u need to ask". thats the dumbest **** ever. even i lied about it. has she had bf? look the only way to find out is by actually doing the nasty thang.. look into her eyes and u can tell. just enter the penis into her thing and youll see youll feel and hear it|`|Jsy1xsL1aa	I was a virgin until I was raped. I cried SO much afterwards. If you rape her abd she cries, she probably was a virgin.|`|9EcxjHewaa	Just ask. MOST girls won't lie.|`|be6eed05c77e84c91810483266c1e72caa	Why do you need to know?  It doesn't matter.|`|AA11833994	why does it matter?
2pxGPcxaaa	Take his word for it. I think he is shy talking to people face-to-face.|`|uSPAw89faa	Try to take it for what he says it is.  Do you feel he's being honest? If so, then just trust your judgment when you meet him.  Guys are human too; and they can be shy too.  He may have a  nervousness on an initial  meeting.  Just feel the situation out, he may be a shy sweetie.  Good Luck|`|be6eed05c77e84c91810483266c1e72caa	Some people really are shy especially in front of somebody they like coz they get conscious and worried what that person is thinking... don't worry about it.  If you get to hang out with him a couple of times, he might just get used to you being around and later on feel comfortable to be himself.  Phones are the safest way to talk coz you dont get to see each other face to face.  He could really be a shy guy.  You'll know if he's really interested if he plans to meet you despite of his being timid.  If he doesn't go his way out to meet you, then he's bluffing.  He just needs a phone pal. =)
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	all this would depend on the laws in your state, how much money he has,if your a stay at home mom and have no job. after 10 yrs u should get some kind of alimony. also depends on the judge. just make sure u get a good attorney,but in some states it really doesn't matter if they cheated on u or not.
K2QwEM4raa	So very sorry!  But I know it will not be easy right now but try and look at it as a new beginning.

Best wishes for a new future.|`|Kh5o3QCcaa	I was essentially raped by my boyfriend when I was 16, and then I found out I was pregnant.  I stayed to try to make it work.  As soon as she was born and we got into an argument he pinned me to the ground- face first in dirt, and repeatedly punched the back of my head and neck full force several times because a friend of mine (female) took me out for a night to celebrate the birth of my daughter.<br>  <br>  I of course left.

3r1TwMCQaa	Usually guys don't have big conversations in the way girls do.

Why would you wanna friendship with a guy who cheated on his ex anyway? It doesn't say much about his personality.|`|QluBTwCvaa	Tell him that you like him a friend. Tell him that he cheated on his EX and your not drunk now and thinking straight and not interested in dating.|`|Xm4NvBPLaa	well play with him in his game give him something for something else<br>  <br>  Im just curious is he up to task or was he just saying that to a friend and really is to scare, you're be the leading player and decided can he have some or not you can behave provocative it dosen't matter !|`|WRC0O6tqaa	No u shouldnt because he want just sleep and have sex with  u and want play with ur innocent body and respect just reply him thanks we are just good friend .. not more please avoid from this guy..|`|YBIiEF3Paa	you are better off without him|`|TRogTUQnaa	First of all, don't believe everything your friend tells you.  She's probably bitterly jealous for some obscure reason.  Whatever she says is hearsay, so just forget it.  Second, why do you want this dude as a friend?  If he's a total sleezeball, cheating and using girls, what good is he as a friend, or is it just for drunken make out sessions?  And if you want him as a friend, and don't want him as a boyfriend, that's two reasons why you shouldn't make out with him.|`|uZDe2eM3aa	well a and b arnt really things you would want in a guy so i dont think he is really worht it if sleeping with you is all he wants but if you still want him as a friend then just talk to him and lay down some rules. going from that say whatever you want in the text.|`|Jsy1xsL1aa	Most times, if you just suck a guy off they'll be cool and not want to sleep with you. You can still be friends too which is why I always do that.|`|CHlxBbkHaa	You can still go for coffee with him.  But keep your distance.  Body language says a lot.

I'd just tell him flat out that you want to be friends because of the reasons you listed. Be honest, honesty will get you further in life. Plus, if he says no that he only wants to bang then that should tell you right then and there that he isn't worth it. Coffee sounds like a nice safe thing to do, considering he can't rape you(figure of speech) in the middle of a coffee shop. So, just go have coffee with him feel him out and at least have fun! But, if he pressures you or tries to talk you into having sex or even just making out, don't do it unless you understand completely that is all he wants.|`|djUMvICoaa	Oh, what a tanled web we weave when we practice to deceive.  Girl, you sent this guy some wrong messages when you let yourself get into that kissing thing, he thinks you're easy pickings now, that you are really into him.  I suggest stay away.  You already know your own reasons and you are pretty sure what he wants.  Accepting anything from him is going to be sending another wrong message.  If he can't be friends and have that same conversation over the phone with you, you know you're better off without him and safer.  Your head is telling you the right thing.  Next time you might have to watch how much you drink, you may be lucky that anything else hadn't happened that night.|`|tRa0y6zqaa	he sounds like a douche<br>  I mean, he cheated on his last gf, he goes to the same college as you, he was bragging to his friend about how he's fully going to get some, making you sound like a piece of meat..<br>  <br>  I think you answered your own question here.<br>  don't reply.|`|be6eed05c77e84c91810483266c1e72caa	A friend won't take advantage of you and even talk about what happened with the both you to other people.  That's called respect.  You can't be friends with somebody who thinks you're just a "thing".  Tell him you're busy.|`|UZ97lztYaa	You could either reply with..<br>  'sure coffee sounds good.. as long as its just two friends gettin 2gether?'<br>  or<br>  'im a bit busy atm'|`|7orOPW5daa	Well you shouldn't make anything up because it would be too easy for him to find out the truth if you are in the same social circle, but it sounds like you might not want to come right out and tell him that you aren't really interested in a sleazebag.<br>  <br>  I'm 100% with you, I wouldn't want to go out with him and let him think that he's tricking me into bed either.  You could just go out with him for coffee and if he makes any moves on you, you could act like you didn't remember the make out session and then if he asks you could say that you are only interested in being friends with him.  That would be a little deceptive, however.<br>  <br>  If it were me I would just tell him that I was not interested and leave it at that, if he asks questions tell him that all you can offer is friendship and that you are not interested in being his new sex conquest, explaining that he'd been overheard.  That way, although he might feel awkward, you put it right out there that you've already decided that you can stay friends with him, but you make it clear that he should give up on you in the sex realm.<br>  <br>  Just remember... you don't really owe him an explanation.  You don't owe him anything.  Yeah, so maybe you overdrank at the bar or at a party and kissed him.  So what.  People do it all the time, and it doesn't make you less of a person, so no matter what is said, don't let him make you feel like less of a person or like you owe him anything.
be6eed05c77e84c91810483266c1e72caa	You know if a guy really likes you he'll always find a way to be with you and to stay away from other girls.  Follow you instincts.|`|HCzZClfvaa	Hey,<br>  First off Jenna seems like a bad friend; knowing you like him and were already on the scene yet kept on moving in?... Yeah not cool.<br>  I recommend ringing John and meeting up with him. Hang out and have fun with him. It will give you the one on one time you're after.<br>  Tell him something about having wanted to hang out with him more that other night and was rather disapointed when Jenna kept geting in the way. <br>  Hopefully sparks will fly when you two are together.<br>  Good Luck!!!
pLkeooJ1aa	You've been with him for 10 years and it's just started happening?<br>  <br>  Well, first off, I would ask a mutual friend if they see the same thing you do. It may be that you're becoming easily embarrassed by him. It may be that he actually is becoming more of an embarrassment. Check that part out first.<br>  <br>  If your fears are confirmed, you might want to wait until it happens again, and then make a mental note. At the end of the night, ask him about it. Not like, "Why did you say that stupid thing?" more like, "what's gotten into you? You haven't been yourself as of late." (your own words, of course)<br>  <br>  It can be a weird situation. My last boyfriend (of 3 years) started doing that and I would let it go because I didn't know how to confront it. His buddy told him he sounds like a dweeb and he stopped. I don't know if he stopped cause he was embarrassed, or because he finally heard himself, but it stopped. If you're not comfortable addressing it, let a guy friend of his do it. It might come off as less personal that way...<br>  <br>  Good luck. This situation is awkward, I know.
szVvf7Nkaa	Don't feel bad because he's acting differently. Give it more time and see how it turns out. It could be that this guy is a bit shy and it could be that he had no clue that you felt this way about him. But if it ends that he's acting this way because he's not interested then at least you know where you stand with him.|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Probably not.  Guys are wierd, the minute they know that you care, they pull the rug out from under you.  I guess they just want what they can't have.  Oh and the nice guy bullcr_ _?  That's all a lie.  They're all the same, no matter if they're good looking (not nice) or not (nice), they're all the same.  Hopefully this guy wasn't nice, because, even if he was a jerk, at least you got to look at a good looking guy?|`|dJoE8yedaa	Some guys like the honesty and some are intimidated by it. If he's the latter, tell him you wanted to see what reaction he would give and wait for him to make the next move.

K2QwEM4raa	I'm so sorry and I wish I could say keep trying but I truly believe that when the heart changes you can rarely get the feelings back. Your best hope in my opinion is to stop trying and she may and I mean may realize that she wants you if she thinks you are moving on with your life. But for the sake of your children continue being nice but a little distanced. And it may or may not work. Stop trying.|`|nBQeSu2faa	Now that you are aware there was a problem in the marriage..this in it's self will be a great help. You need to give your wife time and space but when you are around her continue to be calm ,kind, caring, thoughtful and loving..but don't smother her with your love. If you do get to talk about what went wrong..you must be ready to listen ..try see where she is coming from. If you do get back together ...remember it must be  new start, new rules to make sure the marriage works. All of this can only be done if you are both communicating, not just living in the same house..but really communicating...if you get back together ..remember what ever you were both doing before ...it didn't work , so that's why you need a new set of rules.  One of those rules must be..COMMUNICATION , don't try to read each others minds..for sure you will always get it wrong.|`|GaHkxtU9aa	James, I believe everyone deserves a second chance. If there is still a feeling of love between two people, that is a starting ground to start talking and communicating - and working out what went wrong and how you can move on either together or apart.<br>  <br>  If there is true love - love will find a way - if two people want it too.<br>  <br>  Buy her flowers, call her to ask how she is. Tell her you and the kids miss her. <br>  <br>  Good luck and god bless. Really hope it works out for you. Your love deserves a second chance|`|onbwN4csaa	Don't try to win her back just yet.<br>  Start it over. Ask her for a date.

We were married 17 years also when he left me. For some strange reason i hear a lot of couple separate after 17 years of marriage. Hang in there if she loves you she will come back it will just take some time for her to realize that. Don't do anything stupid and just keep doing what your doing believe me she is paying attention. I became a much better person after my husband left me it's just a shame it took something like that for me to realize what i was doing wrong. Sure my heart was broke and i was depressed for a long time but i got over that and when i did i was like a new person. He seen i had changed for the better and that i really did love him. I wasn't good at showing my love until after he left me you know the old saying "you don't know what you have until you lose it." We started dating after he was gone for 6 months it was fun and exciting. Our son was 16 at the time so that made it much easier for me to spend the night at my husbands apartment and some times we even stayed at a hotel. I hope you and your wife gets to that point because my husband and i fell in love all over again. That happened 13 years ago and we still feel the same towards each other. We been married 30 years now and we are best friends and lovers. The separation was the best thing that could have happened to us it saved our marriage of course i didn't think so back then.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your marriage i hope she realizes real soon that she is making the biggest mistake of her life and comes back to you. Good luck hon!|`|xGI9z01Maa	You can't win your wife's heart back, she has to give it freely.  <br>  <br>  You can go to therapy until you drain your bank account dry, but the fact is you can't change what your wife is feeling.  It is not you but her that needs to find out what was lacking in this marriage.  She is unhappy and needs to find herself.  This really is not about you if you didn't know that you were having issues.  This is something that she has to work out for herself.<br>  <br>  Most likely, you will not get back together.  But if you want to chance, make sure that you don't let the divorce get ugly (try to work everything out without issues.)  Be there for her if she wants you to be, but don't push anything.  See if she would like to go to couples therapy.  But also try to move on.  She needs to see that you still love her but you understand that she has to lead her own life and show her that you are moving on and not pushing things.|`|04IPHLnoaa	im sorry to hear that, i think you should talk to her seriously and try and take them out somewhere they wanted to go or somewhere where you know she'll enjoy say your very sorry and make sure she realises that your very sorry, and i think you two little sweet daughters deserve a father back dont destroy their lives please thank you do mention this to your wife that please dont destroy your daughters lives thank you.|`|PHhKrdqsaa	woh...tough time you got over there dude...have you talked to her to find out what exactly is wrong..??? you cant be best frends just a month ago and the next thing you know you are enemies....how...there must something very wrong....<br>  talk to her and resolve the issue....your dear babies need you together...if she does not want to talk to you..talk to her best friend so that you know hwta could be wrong.<br>  all the very best.|`|HPxKdROwaa	O' friend...you are really in my situation. But only the thing is you are going to therapy. I am doing here therapy myself. See brother..we cannot make the other person to say I LOVE YOU who once has dumped you. I hope she is expecting more from you which you didn't know. You are improving your weak areas and that is good. That intimacy is dead in your relation so what ever you do you cannot please. So search for another girl and show the same love which now you wanted to show to your present wife. Definitely she will shower you in love and appreciates you. Chear up man...you have good life ahead|`|Y0356x8faa	I hope things work out for you, you do sound like a kind & loving man that just grew distant from her - she is likely thinking that you will get her back and go back to ignoring her. <br>  you need to romance her, i agree with the guy who said ask her on a date, keep it very romantic but not physical. take her to her favorite place for dinner, pick her up and  give her flowers. Send her cards in the mail that you are thinking of her and that you will always love her and that you are working on your problems to be a better husband to her. <br>  i have to ask if there is someone else in the picture?|`|pre1k4Pqaa	hi well somtimes all  married people need to remmber just why they first got togher for do u remmber things like when u first met,kiss first time you said love u ??? well after so meany years that can fade sadly in the years of togher all marriage's go trough changes as u see now how bad things can go the only way is to go back remmber how you first made her yours if you  did it once im sure you can again just now is a little diffrent its for the reasons as you have said its not impossable just need to get this right as u once did so plan think put the words caring love want you back into your marriage.

j2yhjBDiaa	Uh oh...Your subconscious might be picking up on subtleties that your conscious mind doesn't want to accept. I'd definitely keep a close eye on both of them...|`|f02e697306fa9b0bd6517818970ff8daaa	It seems you have this idea in the deep recesses of you imagination and now it is coming up. Does not mean anything is amiss.|`|OBCvewW2aa	How the hell am I supposed to know?|`|tsBL19qzaa	What you are having is a precognitive episode in which you have witnessed your wife having an affair with your friend: ergo your wife is having an affair.    At least that is how I interpret the dream. Though, it could be just utter nonsense.|`|85vDqn6naa	She is having an affair for sure! Stop kidding yourself especially if she is coy and touching him whenever she can.|`|5cjKxcSFaa	I feel bad because of the last guys answer so i'll give you my opinion.  Dreams sometimes can mean important things.  Maybe you should take a close look at your friends track record.  Has he ever done anything to make you believe he'd do that to you?  Same for your wife.  Furthermore, a break from work to spend more time at home usually helps troubles in paradise.  Also, I think that your dream could be a mix of fear ( wife cheating ), desire ( you want a threesome or to watch erotic acts ( vouyerism ) ), and recalled memories ( her looking and moaning at you ).  And maybe laying down the law a little bit can make your possible straying wife turn back to the stead.  No b/s...man up and don't let this roll over you.  Tell your best friend you don't want him at your house w/out you and find out why he's going there  1.   2 explain to your wife that if she needs excitement from someone else that you need the truth so you can adjust and move forward.  Good luck.  you may need it.|`|DIx2ZD4Faa	I don't know about the dream but if they were having an affair they would probably try to be a little more discreet.    tell your wife about your dream and how disturbed it makes you feel. talk about the dream only and your feelings.     do you trust her?    it would freak me out.
6oM9kfK2aa	honey, he likes you! thats sweet,sound like he is trying to take it to the next level, let him, sounds like u have been hurt and dont want to get hurt by him, likes you, let him please you,you deserve the best|`|TiOsIfi7aa	that is so cute, he like you a loooooot i think :)|`|57939d59a3c1f8d1245087ca83034729aa	thats so romantic, i would like that lol|`|QijoFWoCaa	Sounds like a pretty normal response for just starting to date.  Good job.|`|e42c6a111e92fde09b5e0f86378459c1aa	The real question is ..."Do YOU think he cares?"      Sounds like you both agreed to take it slow and he is honoring the agreement.  If you have other expectations of him when ever you find yourself alone, you should tell him.      If not...enjoy the movie, have some kettle corn and be patient going to any next step.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	He sounds romantic, make it happen.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I think it's sweet. Nothing wrong with staying home and hanging out!|`|8uNLDeLQaa	he likes u|`|fmDEqjRKaa	if he actually does something like that i.e. hold ur hand and walk with u i'd believe him|`|2afVnStxaa	Sounds to me that he not only really cares for you he respects your decision to take it slow and is allowing you the time you need. He sounds like a keeper. Stay with him and move things forward, he sounds like he is worth it. Good luck to you.|`|J3iBuHAHaa	YAWN.    I don't know what kind of girl you are, but that sounds sort of broing to me...lol. If you're someone that likes to take things at a snail pase, by all means sit in a room with the notebook on and let him hold you all night. Otherwise, you should tell him that you atleast want to fill the room with romantic kisses and maybe some mild foreplay in the future. If you need any more advice, you can e-mail me.    Hope I was of some help, Good luck :)|`|oRr9SOIqaa	It means he cares a lot!!! That's so sweet |`|7009418e24ad1def37deaede6f243f56aa	Some guys are like that, they take it slow and like to hold you.

He really cares if he'd say that, I mean why would a boy say that and not care? Come on girl, we are all the same...we should know they care when they say that.|`|HPgMTnJ3aa	its like cuddling together
