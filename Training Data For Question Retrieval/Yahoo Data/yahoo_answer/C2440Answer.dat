The Welsh Regiment, "The Princess of Wales Regiment" was engaged in that battle.  Or try googling "Welsh Regiment - South Africa - 1900"    My own uncles were in the Glosters and I found a Museum dedicated to that Regiment in Gloucester Docks.  Among the exhibits were lists of soldiers who served in the 1914-18 War and my uncles were among them.  Many Regiments have their own museums.

O05HQLohaa	Agents  They do not look at your picture and resume and go out and try to find you a job.  You should give them enough information about your skills and decent photos of you.  Almost all agents know where to find out about casting for theater and movies.    When these castings are announced they look through their files to see who might have a chance. If you appear to have a chance they will notify you.  Until you have found work several times they are not going to go out and try to sell you to a producer.

dfjIBHe3aa	Simply put, the American Pop Artists -- Warhol, Litchenstein and James Rosenquist were reacting against Abstract Expressionism such as Jackson Pollock and Willem de Koonig.  They were preceded by Robert Rauchenberg, Jasper Johns and Larry Rivers, who bought, erased and exhibited a de Kooning drawing.  But Warhol used silk screens with his soup cans and photographs (which he then painted on) James Rosenquist was a former sign painter who used sign painting techniques and Litchenstein made extensive use of stencils.  They did everything they could to take the gesture out of their work.  This is especially clear in Litchenstein's prints of a brushstroke which is as stylized and deprived of life as any of his blown up cartoon panels.  It was being shown in a New York which celebrated Franz Kline's huge canvases with one or two very gestural black strokes filling them up.      I have never seen any British Pop art which was as formalist, but then again, while I'm sure they exist, I've never read any British Critic from the period as overbearing as Clement Greenberg, who was an articulate champion of abstract expressionism.|`|p2jBCUU6aa	This should give you a start:    Roy Lichtenstein (October 27, 1923  September 29, 1997) was a prominent American pop artist, his work heavily influenced by both popular advertising and the comic book style. He himself described Pop art as, "not 'American' painting but actually industrial painting".    Roy Lichtenstein was born on October 27, 1923 into an upper-middle-class New York City family, and attended public school until the age of 12. He then enrolled at Manhattan's Franklin School for Boys, remaining there for his secondary education. Art was not included in the school's curriculum; Lichtenstein first became interested in art and design as a hobby. He was an avid jazz fan, often attending concerts at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. He would frequently draw portraits of the musicians playing their instruments. After graduation from Franklin, Lichtenstein enrolled in summer classes at the Art Students League of New York, where he worked under the tutelage of Reginald Marsh.    Lichtenstein then left New York to study at the Ohio State University which offered studio courses and a degree in fine arts. His studies were interrupted by a three year stint in the army during World War II and after between 1943 and 1946. Lichtenstein returned home to visit his dying father and was discharged from the army under the Servicemen's Readjustment Act (USA). Returning to studies in Ohio under the supervision of one of his teachers, Hoyt L. Sherman, who is widely regarded to have had a significant impact on his future work (Lichtenstein would later name a new studio he funded at OSU as the Hoyt L. Sherman Studio Art Center). Lichtenstein entered the graduate program at Ohio State and was hired as an art instructor, a post he held on and off for the next ten years. In 1949 Lichtenstein received a M.F.A. degree from the Ohio State University and in the same year married Isabel Wilson (divorced 1965).  Wilson was previously married to Cleveland, Ohio artist Michael Sarisky. In 1951 Lichtenstein had his first one-man exhibition at Carlebach Gallery in New York.    He moved to Cleveland in the same year, where he remained for six years, although frequently traveling back to New York. Undertaking jobs as varied as a draftsman to a window decorator in between periods of painting. His work at this time fluctuated between Cubism and Expressionism. In 1954 his first son, David Hoyt Lichtenstein was born. He then had his second son, Mitchell Lichtenstein in 1956. In 1957 he moved back to upstate New York and began teaching again. It was at this time that he adopted the Abstract Expressionism style, a late convert to this style of painting.    Lichtenstein began teaching in upstate New York at State University of New York at Oswego in 1958. However, the brutal upstate winters were taking a toll on him and his wife.    In 1960, he started teaching at Rutgers University where he was heavily influenced by Allan Kaprow, also a teacher at the University. This environment helped to reignite his interest in Proto-pop imagery.In 1961 Lichtenstein began his first Pop paintings using cartoon images and techniques derived from the appearance of commercial printing. This phase would continue to 1965 and included the use of advertising imagery suggesting consumerism and homemaking. His first work to feature the large-scale use of hard-edged figures and Benday Dots was Look Mickey (1961, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.). This piece came from a challenge from one of his sons, who pointed to a Mickey Mouse comic book and said; "I bet you can't paint as good as that, eh, Dad?" In the same year he produced six other works with recognizable characters from gum wrappers and cartoons. In 1961 Leo Castelli started displaying Lichtenstein's work at his gallery in New York, and he had his first one man show at the gallery in 1962; the entire collection was bought by influential collectors of the time before the show even opened. Interestingly Castelli rejected the work of one of Lichtenstein's contemporaries, Andy Warhol. In September 1963 he took a leave of absence from his teaching position at Douglass College at Rutgers.    It was at this time that Lichtenstein began to find fame not just in America but worldwide. He moved back to New York to be at the center of the art scene and resigned from Rutgers University in 1964 to concentrate on his painting. Lichtenstein used oil and Magna paint in his best known works, such as Drowning Girl (1963), which was appropriated from the lead story in DC Comics' Secret Hearts  83. (Drowning Girl now hangs in the Museum of Modern Art, New York.) Also featuring thick outlines, bold colors and Benday Dots to represent certain colors, as if created by photographic reproduction. Lichtenstein would say of his own work: Abstract Expressionists "put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting dow|`|VUgCSQ6Daa	Are you referring to Roy Lichtenstein? If so, here is a link that may help.

644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	On April 6, 1917, the House of Representatives voted 373 to 50 in favor of declaring war, and the Senate voted in favor by 82 to 6.    The president does not have the authority to declare war.    A few Americans were embittered, and some saw Wilson as acting on behalf of big business.    Some Germans believed that the United States was already in effect in the war on the side of Britain. Germany's Supreme Command assured King William that if submarine warfare brought the United States into the war, Britain would be forced to sue for peace before U.S. troops could arrive in significant numbers. Many were inclined to accept the judgment of their nation's leading military men on military matters. And so too was Kaiser Wilhelm, who accepted their analysis.    Wilhelm was nervous and wanted peace, but he also wished for a military victory, and he was determined to carry out his role as Germany's God-appointed ruler. His government notified Washington of its intentions to resume unrestricted submarine warfare, and it offered American ships passage to one British port a week, at Falmouth - a ship that, to avoid being torpedoed, had to be marked by flags, painted with certain signs, and had to follow a described sea lane across the Atlantic. The Wilson administration rejected all this, and on January 31, 1917, the Germans began their new program of submarine warfare.    Wilson, always under attack in the United States for being too soft, responded with a call for "armed neutrality," which meant the arming of U.S. merchant ships to defend themselves against submarines. The British moved to influence opinion in the United States, and on February 28 it made public a telegram that Germany's new Secretary of State, Arthur Zimmermann, had sent in mid-January to the German minister in Mexico. The telegram advised the minister in Mexico that war between the United States and Germany might come with Germany's new submarine offensive and that the minister was to offer Mexico an alliance with Germany and promise Mexico the return of Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. In learning of the telegram, the U.S. public was aroused.    Wilson went before a joint session of Congress and announced that the United States would not choose "the path of submission." The world, he told Congress and the nation, must be "made safe for democracy." He called for a new balance of power.|`|O9FojdEMaa	Wilson asks for declaration of war  April 2, 1917  Capitol Building, Washington, D.C.  "The world must be made safe for democracy," Wilson insists

A better way to extract a single frame is to import the video into Windows Movie Maker and drag onto the timeline.    Run the video and pause on a good frame. Then go to Tools>Take Picture from Preview. This will copy just the single frame.    You will still have the twin problems of very low resolution and slow shutter speed.    Low resolution means you can't print the image, bit its OK for web use.    Most video shot at the default frame rate will be 25 frames per second, this means that every frame will have a shutter speed of 1/25th of a second, which in turn means that most frames will have motion blur, either camera blur or subject blur, usually both.    Windows Movie Maker at least allows you to step through the frames one by one and select the one which has the least blur, but I suspect it will be less than perfect.    Chris|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	Yes.

3tWlbje7aa	Well right from the start she is convinced that the act should be committed. To put it mildly, regicide crosses  Macbeth's mind early on but he's always lilly livered about it. She is fiercly dtermined right from the start as soon as she gets the letter from Macbeth. She knows that his "weakness" (is being cruel a weakness? It is to her) is that he's not a heartless bastard like she is. (he is too full of the milk of human kindness). She maintains her determination right until the murder -- she becomes a secondary character after that.     Remember that just before the deed he says        We will proceed no further in this business:      He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought      Golden opinions from all sorts of people,      Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,      Not cast aside so soon.    So he thinks he's got it pretty cushy and he would balls it all up by topping the King but Lady Macbeth accused him of being a coward and and a promise breaker. She is absolutely determined that it will happen. So you're right on the money on manipulation.

UeRBQBa9aa	The 'Aryan Race' myth began long before Hitler got ahold of it. <br>  When the British occupied India there was a myth, begun or at least pushed, by the British that an 'Aryan' ['noble/spiritual] white race had taken over in ancient India from the darker Dravidians. To make their occupation a little easier they circulated this myth, [although now the archaeology of the Indus/Harappan civilizations has found that some type of people did migrate into this area...but there is much yet to be found associated with this theory]...<br>  It was, just  a ploy used by the 'white' race to attempt the subjugation of a 'dark' race...and Hinduism and also to off-set the caste system that was practiced in India.<br>  At the end of the 19th and early 20th C. CE,  there were a group who claimed to be 'seers'...who would go into trances and relate things in either past or future history. One of these subjects was 'Aryanism'. <br>  Unfortunately Blavatsky equated 'Aryans' with 'semetic' people.<br>  When Hitler came into power he used this myth to separate his 'perfect 'Aryan Race' from the 'semetics' , who were thought to be Jewish...[There are many ethnic groups who are Semetic and are not Jewish...which is a religion].....<br>  What Hitler was doing was to divide his people, create an 'enemy in their midst', and also create an idea of being a 'superior race'.....<br>  He also justified the actions of attempting genocide with this myth...<br>  ['Arian' is another word associated with the first followers and monks who spread Christianity before the militant Byzantine Church took over].<br>  isis1037@yahoo.com|`|RD05jXYwaa	Heindrick Himmler was the voice of the Aryan nation he wanted to connect with and be esteemed as if he were from The Order of the Teutonic Knights of St. Mary's Hospital in Jerusalem. a well respected and honored order from the 1200 -1400. but they were disbanded and destroyed In 1410, a Polish-Lithuanian army decisively defeated the Order and broke its military power at the Battle of Grunwald.<br>  Himmler sucked Hitler into his "dreams of heraldry" and Aryan purity. tmm|`|35154496dadac252bb1dd3ed057615f8aa	I guess from old religions such as the Hinduism and Zoroastrianism.|`|c819af3af49d8b8d19675e0d6c66de9daa	He was racist and wanted to make the white majority feel better so that they would elect him.|`|oRm1JJ31aa	because he believed in evolution.

Yugoslavia, apart from a brief interlude under German occupation in WW2, survived as an independent country in this form until the 1990s, so could be said to be the big success story of the Treaty of Versailles.
draNVjbkaa	In L.A. a good price range is $250-500 (for the session only, this doesn't include touch ups or reproductions). Anything over $500 is either for a name or some quack who does no better than a photographer who charges $250.<br>  <br>  If you're in LA or NY go to www.reproductions.com and look through their books. Find photographers that photograph people like you well ie. Skin tone, hair color, eye color, ethnicity, age range, physical structure, etc. Choose your top 5 and meet with ALL of them! You want to get their philosophies and their personalities. You certainly don't want to work with someone whose personality sucks for you.<br>  <br>  Usually you DON'T get your headshots until you've taken some classes that help you determine the type of roles that you can play. Your best way to determine your type is to ask agents or casting directors. Casting directors especially! They're the ones that are paid to imagine you playing multiple roles based on ONE GENERAL headshot.<br>  <br>  With regards to looks, you DON'T want character shots ie. literally dressing like a cop, doctor, etc. NO PROPS EITHER! This is an insult to the casting directors and will get you laughed out of this business. You want 3-4 GENERAL LOOKS! For example, a business suit look can suggest FBI, detective, secretary, business person,etc. A casual look (jeans and t-shirt) can suggest high school, college, blue collar. An upscale j-crew/Banana Republic look can suggest young parent, preppy, white collar, etc.<br>  <br>  Also, when you meet with your photographer make it clear that you don't want the following in your headshots:<br>  <br>  -Landscape cropping. When a landscape photo is posted online on LA Casting or Actors access, it's appears very tiny compared to a photo that was cropped portrait. CDs get submissions as really tiny thumbnails. They might miss your photo if it's smaller than the majority of photos that are cropped portrait.<br>  <br>  -Chopping off the top of the head. When too much of your head is chopped off, it makes it a little difficult as to what your really look like. Cropping off a small part of the top of your head is forgivable, but not to the extent where you look like Hannibal Lecter or Sylar from Heroes' victims.<br>  <br>  -Too close. Don't get it cropped too close to where people can't see your body. At least your upper torso should be visible in your shots so CDs/Agents have a fair idea of what you look like physically.<br>  <br>  -Silly poses. Headshots are supposed to be as natural as rain. Making stupid poses will just make you look stupider. Such common poses include, but not limited to:<br>  1. Sitting on the toilet. This is where you're sitting down but leaning forward.<br>  2. My head is too heavy. Don't do a headshot where your hand is under your chin or even touching your head.<br>  3. Look at me, I have a sexy back! I've seen some headshots where people are in contorted poses, looking over his or her shoulder. It's not natural.<br>  4. I'm a mermaid! This is where you're laying on your stomach with your feet up.<br>  5. Leading with my shoulder|`|AA12228381	anywhere from $75 to $500+, just depends upon who you shoot with.  Just remember, for the most part, you get what you pay for, although the highest prices doesn't guarantee the best.  A couple points:<br>  <br>  1) Headshots are THE actors main tool.  It's your business card.  It's usually the ONLY thing a casting director will see, so it better catch their eye.<br>  2) Make sure it actually looks like you.  Biggest pet peeve of CD's is when you come to their office and look NOTHING like your headshot.<br>  3) Be sure to use a true 'headshot' photographer - not someone who also does weddings, and corporate shots, etc as a headshot is not one of those.<br>  4) Look at example of their work to see if it suits your type and look.|`|hwvQy100aa	They can run a couple of thousand dollars.

ceBTTCPwaa	Punish him by making him read the DaVinci Code.<br>  <br>  Othello, the Moor of Venice is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written in approximately 1603, and based on the Italian short story "Un Capitano Moro" (A Moorish Captain) by Cinthio (a disciple of Boccaccio) first published in 1565. The work revolves around four central characters: Othello, a Moorish general in the Venetian army; his wife Desdemona; his lieutenant, Cassio; and his trusted ensign Iago. Because of its varied themes — racism, love, jealousy and betrayal — Othello remains relevant to the present day and is often performed in professional and community theatres alike. The play has also been the basis for numerous operatic, film and literary adaptations.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Othello" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Othello</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/oth/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/oth/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/othello/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/ot...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/id-138.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/othello/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/othello/index....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?article_id=337" rel="nofollow">http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmOthello02.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/Titles/othello/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/othello.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/Free_Booknotes/Othello/othello.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/F...</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Iago is one of Shakespeare's best villains.<br>  <br>  You go steal from Merchant of Venice and take a pound of flesh.<br>  Likely, given the time period, death would be punishment.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Iago|`|tWlaPLcMaa	i would say looking him up in a cell and putting him under a fossit that leaks one drip at a time.sounds horrible
ceBTTCPwaa	Othello is a British 2001 made-for-TV film starring Eamonn Walker, Christopher Eccleston and Keeley Hawes. It is an adaptation in modern English of William Shakespeare's play Othello. It was scripted by Andrew Davies and directed by Geoffrey Sax.<br>  <br>  The film is narrated by Ben Jago, a corrupt police detective who is prepared to manipulate those around him to get what he wants, even the people he loves. After the Commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police Sinclair Carver is caught using racist language he is forced to resign. The Home Secretary and Prime Minister choose John Othello, a black policeman and Jago's best friend, to be the next Commissioner as a publicity stunt after a reporter praises him for ending a riot. Jago, Carver's second-in-command, feels that Othello stole his chance to become Commissioner himself as he had been the favourite for the job. Jago plots to take revenge on Othello by ruining his life and driving him out of his new job. Jago posts on a pro-Nazi website about Othello's marriage to Dessie Brabant, a wealthy white woman, leading her to be attacked in the street. When Othello asks Jago to lend him a man to look after her during the day Jago suggests Michael Cass, an attractive inspector and known womanizer, to look after Dessie. Jago also seduces Dessie's best friend, Lulu, to try to get information about Dessie's past and her relationship with Cass. During this Othello has Jago look into the death of Billy Coates, a black drug-user, who was battered to death by three policemen claiming it was self-defence. He discovers, via PC Andy Roderick, that the three policemen actually went to Coastes' flat with the intention of attacking him due to racial hate. Jago sympathises with Roderick and offers protection in return for him testifying against the other three policemen. Upon discovering this Othello is given all the credit. Furious that he has once again been overlooked by Othello, Jago decides to ruin the case. Roderick is called to give evidence at the trail causing the other policemen to rebuff him. The day he is called to trail he is found dead from an overdose, and it is suggested that Jago overdosed Roderick with alcohol, knowing he was on anti-depressants. Jago offers to take the blaime but Othello refuses telling him that he is the "only person [he] can trust." Through Jago's prompting and several misunderstood situations between Dessie and Cass, Othello begins to become paranoid that Dessie is having an affair. Jago suggests they use DNA to test whether Dessie and Cass sleeping together. During a televised interview Othello has a break down and even attacks Cass in a car park. Jago starts to feel guilty about what has happened. However he decides that it is out of his control. Nonetheless he tells Othello that he got the DNA tests back, confirming that Dessie is having an affair That night Othello returns home to confront her. When Dessie denies it Othello kills her in a fit of anger. Worried when they don't get a response at the door, Jago and Lulu break into the flat to find Dessie dead. Jago tells Othello that the tests were negative and Dessie was innocent. Realising that he had been manipulated, Othello asks Jago why he did it, to which Jago states that Othello "took what was his" yet, despite everything, Jago states that he still loves Othello and always will. Jago and Lulu wait outside for the police to arrive when Othello kills himself. Shortly after the Home Secretary and Prime Minister decide to choose a more reliable pair of hands for the Commissioner, choosing Jago.<br>  The film ends with Jago stating that it wasn't about race or politics but love, "simple as that."|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Here is a set  of links with many modern productions.

3L4citcnaa	This is quite simple, really. You have heard that the Civil War was all about slavery? This is likely if you live in the North. In the South, most textbooks will tell you that the Civil War was all about states' rights. In truth, it was about both. <br>  <br>  The South wanted slaves; the North wanted abolition. The South believed that every state should be able to choose whether they wanted slaves or not. The North believed that the federal government should have complete power over this decision. <br>  <br>  Do you see the similarity now?<br>  <br>  The difference between the North and the South was, in part, states' rights; or in other words, big government versus small government. <br>  <br>  In case this doesn't clue you in, the most fundamental difference between a liberal and a conservative is the size of government. Liberals want a big, powerful government with lots of taxes so that they can pay for all of their government run programs, like welfare, medicine, and education. Conservatives want a smaller government, where states and corporations have more power to control their own future.<br>  <br>  Surely, at this point I know longer have to point out the obvious? The North, like modern day liberals, wanted a strong government (in the case of the Civil War, it was to outlaw slavery) and the South, like modern day conservatives, wanted a weak federal government (In the case of the Civil War, it was to allow the existence of slavery).|`|kuA09bzVaa	Not at all.

g8kIjpwSaa	After graduating, I sent my resume to every single firm in a 50 mile radius and also searched for job postings on AIGA. <br>  <br>  With the economy the way it is, you may have to be willing to take job offers that are out of state. Some areas of the country have more demand for designers than other. Austin, TX for example is a good area for designers right now. New York is always good, but there are more designers than design jobs and the competition is insanity.<br>  <br>  As an entry level designer, you should expect to be paid somewhere in the ballpark of $30,000. That's the national entry level salary average for designers according to a December 2008 survey. But after 6 months to a year you'll get a performance evaluation and a pay raise.<br>  <br>  My main advice is to just find a job, even if it's not you're dream design job with your dream design firm. The first two years in the design industry is about learning the field, and in some cases un-learning what you were taught in school. But after those first two years, you'll be in a better position to get the jobs you really want.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	Hobbes tries to contrast in "The Leviathan" what happens in the absence of government with what (can) happen when one is present.<br>  <br>  In the so-called 'state of nature', he feels that every person is essentially at war with every other one.  Because every person is selfish, it is natural to want everything for yourself at the expense of everyone else.  Questions such as 'justice' are pretty much irrelevant in such a state... there is only power and force, what you can do and what you can't do.<br>  <br>  But when you have some kind of authority involved which can then act based on the mutual strength of many people, other things can happen.  Many people are naturally stronger than any single one, but because such force is wielded by many hands, it must also serve all of them as well.  In Hobbes' view, this causes all kinds of rules and systems to naturally fall into place.<br>  <br>  When two people agree to make an exchange without coercion, he sees this as an atom of justice.  It is fair and mutually beneficial.  And pretty much all social interactions can be extrapolated into this kind of exchange on one level or another:  you pay taxes and the government provides you services, you cede your right to engage in international negotiations but the sovereign does it for you, and so on.  And the only way to assure someone doesn't break the agreement is that social force lurking in the background... so without a government of some sort none of this works.<br>  <br>  So the equality of the leviathan isn't the equality of every person being alike or even the equality of each having the exact same rights, but rather one of fair exchanges made on agreed upon terms that are then stuck to.  You may give up stuff, but so long as you like what you are getting, you end up at least no worse than you were before.<br>  <br>  My take, for what it's worth.  Hope that helps!

I recommend you call the nearest college that has a dance program and ask if they know any local studios offering community classes.

SH1Tsi4Uaa	I have made a website that's still in development that has free magic tricks. It's found at <a href="http://www.learn-magic-online.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.learn-magic-online.com.</a> Here's one that I grabbed from it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Switching Cards Card Trick<br>  <br>  The magician asks for a spectator to take a card. He then tells the spectator to place their hand over it to ensure that he can not do anything to it. The top card no the deck is taken, waved over the spectator's hand, the turned over to reveal that the two have changed places.<br>  <br>  How It's Done<br>  <br>  So how is this great trick performed? The secret is simple: a double-card lift. If you don't already know how to perform a double-card grip, you will need to learn one now, as several card tricks require it.<br>  <br>  All you need to do is put one card on top of another whille making it look like just one; this is much easier to do if you slightly bend the card back.<br>  <br>  Once you've got the double-card lift down, you're going to need to apply it to the trick. You will also need to memorize the top card.<br>  <br>  Ask for the spectator to choose any card that they want, memorize it, and not show it to you. While they are doing that, (and it might only take about a second) you will need to slightly raise the card with your pinky.<br>  <br>  Now that your spectator is content, take the card from them, and very quickly place it under the top card. This will take some practice, but that's not exactly what your audience is looking for, and thus you will most likely get by with it.<br>  <br>  Using a double-card lift, show the audience their card, with the top card on top so that they know it is still there. Set both cards back down on the deck, and slide off the real top card, and tell your spectator to keep it under their hand; remember, right now they think they are keeping the card they choose under their hand, while it is really still on the top of the deck.<br>  <br>  Lift up the back of the spectator's choosen card so that only you can see it saying something like, "Okay, the next card is the [fill in card]." In a casual movement, wave the choosen card over the spectator's hand, and tell them the two have just switched. They will now discover that what you say is true.<br>  <br>  Tips<br>  <br>  *To show the spectator the false card, use a triple-card lift of a duplicate top card from another deck.<br>  <br>  *Make sure that your spectator doesn't turn over the card you give them!|`|dHc2lN39aa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgLUbXSqwSs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgLUbXSqw...</a><br>  <br>  ^^^^^^ 3 easy magic tricks and how to do them
5oAU7S9zaa	That is so cool, and I love Twilight!<br>  <br>  Here are some really great books like it...<br>  Need by Carrie Jones-<br>  <br>   Zara collects phobias the way other high school girls collect lipsticks. Little wonder, since life’s been pretty rough so far. Her father left, her stepfather just died, and her mother’s pretty much checked out. Now Zara’s living with her grandmother in sleepy, cold Maine so that she stays “safe.” Zara doesn’t think she’s in danger; she thinks her mother can’t deal.  Wrong. Turns out that guy she sees everywhere, the one leaving trails of gold glitter, isn’t a figment of her imagination. He’s a pixie—and not the cute, lovable kind with wings. He’s the kind who has dreadful, uncontrollable needs. And he’s trailing Zara<br>   <br>  Evermore by Alyson Noel-<br>  <br>  Since a horrible accident claimed the lives of her family, sixteen-year-old Ever can see auras, hear people’s thoughts, and know a person’s life story by touch. Going out of her way to shield herself from human contact to suppress her abilities has branded her as a freak at her new high school—but everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste…<br>  <br>  Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Damen equal parts light and darkness, and he belongs to an enchanted new world where no one ever dies.<br>  <br>  Vampire Diaries by : L.J Smith********<br>  Elena: the golden girl, the leader, the one who can have any boy she wants. <br>  Stefan: brooding and mysterious, he seems to be the only one who can resist Elena, even as he struggles to protect her from the horrors that haunt his past. <br>  Damon: sexy, dangerous, and driven by an urge for revenge against Stefan, the brother who betrayed him. Determined to have Elena, he'd kill to possess her. <br>  <br>  Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead<br>  After two years on the run, best friends Rose, half-human/half-vampire, and Lissa, a mortal vampire princess, are caught and returned to St. Vladimir's Academy. Up until then, Rose had kept Lissa safe from her enemies; school, however, brings both girls additional challenges and responsibilities. How they handle peer pressure, nasty gossip, new relationships, and anonymous threats may mean life or death. Likable narrator Rose hides doubts about her friend behind a tough exterior; orphan Lissa, while coping with difficult emotional issues such as depression and survivor's guilt, uses her emerging gifts for good. <br>  <br>  Mediator Series by Meg Cabot*********<br>  Susannah Simon is 16 years old, a lonely New York City girl who has to move from her beloved East Coast to live with her mother and new step-family in Carmel, California. Traumatic enough for any teenager, this adjustment to a new family and environment is complicated even more by Susannah's natural gift for talking to the dead. Susannah is a mediator, a contact point for the dead who can't (or won't) make it to the other side. The family home is a beautiful old house harbouring its own resident unsettled spirit, which has set up residence in Susannah's bedroom. There is also the small matter of the angry ghost haunting the locker room in her new school, desperate for revenge on an ex-boyfriend, not to mention the discovery that her school principal, Father Dominic, is also a mediator. <br>  <br>  The Luxe by Anna Godbersen<br>  A big, sumptuous tale of catty girls, dark secrets and windswept romance unfurls in this compulsively readable novel of late-19th-century New York City socialites. Godbersen weaves a tenuous web of deceit, backstabbing and pretense that follows four teens: Elizabeth Holland, a prim and proper lady of old-money society, is betrothed to one man, though furtively loves another; Henry Schoonmaker, a debauched playboy who must marry Elizabeth or be disinherited; Diana Holland, Elizabeth’s younger sister who is in love with her fiancé; and Penelope Hayes, a member of the nouveau riche who will stop at nothing to win Henry’s affections. <br>  <br>  The Uglies Series by Scott Westerfield ~ Science fiction Set in the future where everyone born normal is considered Ugly until you turn sixteen and have a surgery to turn Pretty.

Jeb, a sympathetic scientist, helped them escape and, since then, they've been living on their own. The Erasers have orders to kill them so the world will never find out they exist.

To Zoey, being marked is truly a blessing, though she's scared at first. She has never fit into the human world and has always felt she is destined for something else. Her grandmother, a descendant of the Cherokee, has always supported her emotionally, and it is she who takes the girl to her new school. But even there the teen stands apart from the others.

Maybe death is an answer to life?|`|AA10023528	Just to get possible experience of a true sense of appreciation, for right now there is none for both Life and Death|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	This is one question where man can only find a truthful answer in a belief in a God that he did not create.  But that God created man.<br>  Without this spiritual premise for belief man's existence is just as meaningful as that of an animal or fish or bird or plants existence.<br>  <br>  Philosophers in the past have stated reasons for living but they are dead.  So why respect their answers to the point where you live by their decrees?  <br>  <br>  The next question would be is the spiritual or religious answer really more reliable and truthful than one that is natural?   The answer is yes for those who believe it is and no for those who do not believe.<br>  <br>  The last question then would be then why does Uncle Remus 54 believe in the spiritual answer rather than live the words of dead man in the past.<br>  <br>  The answer is simple.  I believe there is only one book that contains 67 books in all called the Bible that contains the truth about God and all the interactions between God and the people and nations that took place in ancient history.  There are people who follow a religion based on that book called Jews and live all around the world.  They have a land of their own called Israel.  And there are new followers who follow what they believe to be a fullfillment of Jewish faith called Christianity.<br>  <br>  This belief has only been around for 2000 years.  While the Jewish faith or nation has been around for some 5,000 plus years.  Since God brought them out of the nation of Egypt under Moses.   From Moses came the 10 commandments of which Western society is very familiar with and knows about.  From the Old Testament comes the creation story and the flood event from which all the cultures around the world share similar stories.   <br>  <br>  The religous belief then adds a historical context that connects my part of living with those in the past.  And connects it with those who will follow me in the future.  My accountability for my actions is not just for those of my family and friends but to the higher power, the creator of our faith and the creator of the universe as well.   The point of my living then is to love God as he has loved me and to share God's love to my fellow man as well.  <br>  <br>  The concept of self is no longer tied to just my physical nature which is finite and can die.  But it also includes my spiritual nature that is eternal and never dies.  And I do not believe that of my own choosing or will.  No.  It is the teaching of this truth that is in the book that speaks the truth about God and man.  And that book covers man's 4,000 plus years of experience before Jesus Christ came into the world.<br>  <br>  I know my answer is long but I wanted to make it clear to you what I believe the point of living is.  It is not to die.  It is to live not just in this life, but to life more gloriously in the life to come.|`|spYpsixUaa	1. There is a fly on the wall in the corner of a dark room in the upstairs attic in my mind which is pondering philosophical questions like "Why would Thales think that everything is made of water?" There is another fly on that same wall which is pondering the smell of rotting tomato sauce rising up from the floor and wondering if he should fly down to it and try to eat some of it. On the facing wall of these two flies is a spider who is pondering the tasty effort of chasing them down and eating them.<br>  <br>  2. Work, work, work! Perpetuating the species is neither a sensical nor nonsensical thing to do. It's the genetic purpose of living beings. Even plants do it. The purpose of procreation (i.e., the meaning of Life (******* **** *** *** *** **** ******** ** *** ****** ********* *** ***** ** ****** ********* ** ******* *** *** ***** **** ***** ******* ** ***** *****)) is an individual effort, almost a competitive struggle. "I procreate so that my progeny can outnumber the other guy's progeny." That's what procreation is all about. Life itself and the fact that we have brains is merely something to pass the time inbetween children. Gee, that's kinda depressing. I'm glad I disagree with it.<br>  <br>  3. ******** doesn't have any religion. Should I be afraid of you? There is a tiny little earthworm crawling up out of the drain in my bathtub swirling around in the ceramic basin, squirming in the light with all the stinging soap-stains, and I look down at it and wonder, "What is the point of your life? You're not ********. I'm not afraid of you! You're nothing but a little worm!" Contradiction: No Religion, but "life is so godless." Oh, I get it. You're a paradox!<br>  <br>  4. If you can say "Cogito ergo Sum," a predatory carnivore will be tempted to eat you!<br>  <br>  5. Yet another in the continuing struggle of the 42-ish quandary of conundrums! Is it time for yet another visit to ******.*** for yet another mail-order copy of that amazing technological invention (The Electronic Book-like device which has a huge yellow smiley face on it that calmly advises each reader, "Don't Panic!"? Yes, the supposedly science-fiction notion of a paperless book in a portable electronic format is in fact a reality now. Does this constitute an existential crisis for Reality? What happens when the realm of science fiction becomes real objects readily available on the market? When Sci-Fi becomes reality?

He puts us on the planet with a book of instructions, and the test is to see if we can figure out how to live according to the instructions in that book before we die. Haven't you ever seen ***********? It's the same thing, except we're not dead! Have some more coffee. Oh, and look. They gave me this cool mousepad with the Corporate philosophy printed on it!<br>  <br>  7. The dogs roam the streets in a cantankerous herd, packing like gerbils and swarming like birds, bellowing like vain breezes in trees, a soundless howl against the icy winds of Winter in a midwestern cornfield, waiting for the imagined horror that to arrive, and looking for strange lights in the skies (while we enjoy a peaceful reverie noticing the shape of Orion's bow and arrow), and yet we toil in the soil mining for gold as we age mercilessly wailing at the waning of our lives.<br>  <br>  8. We exist because we are here, and our sense of duty is determined by society. In an existentialist view, our meaning / purpose / value in Life is merely living it. Sometimes people recite the blind optimism that Life is a gift that should be cherished, but when you go to bed alone and stare at the ceiling, you get pretty saddened when you have to disagree and say that "It just is." Sometimes people spout the famous aphorisms, unhelpfully, "Go where you're most needed when you're most needed." and "Help others, join a charity, etc." Others will spew contempt at you for posting a question which could conceivably be searched in the *** Indexes (The White space in the Green bar just below the Banner sign on the screen), but sometimes the point of posting the question yourself is the magic of having somebody talking directly to you.|`|AA11488628	the point is you are going to die so you may as well do something worth while if you are going to be around.|`|X3lrPVbKaa	I'm not an oracle but I believe we are all here for a purpose.

osFEzMy5aa	Anything can be interesting just depends on how you capture it.  Try starting off with buildings and architecture like bridges or stadiums or churches.  Then another day do nature and landscapes, then another day do people and misc. stuff like cars and train tracks.  Then whenever you're sitting around the house do macro pics of stuff outside and food.  But I always suggest taking pictures of things according to the season because you wont get to for many months to a year.<br>  <br>  Check out flickr.com, theres a ton of great ideas there or get a photography book and try to replicate pictures with things available to you.

3LOLGaOMaa	Well, when Liliuokalani came into power, she wanted ot get rid of the bayonet Constitution and restore power in Hawaii, which of course angered Dole, because he wanted to continue his sugar business. Dole and his friends sent out four ships of Marines (without government permission) to aim cannons at her palace, so she surrendered. <br>  <br>  Grover Cleveland wanted to put the annex on hold because he wanted to investigate what happened and give Liliuokalani her throne back. Dole refused to step down from power, and Cleveland was not going to use military force, so he gave up. The next president, William McKinley, gave Hawaii their annex|`|4ilM2hCwaa	In 1887 a consortium of non-native planters and businessmen, including Dole, seeking to control the kingdom politically as well as economically, formed a secret organization known as the Hawaiian League. King Kalakaua was compelled to accept a new Cabinet composed of league members, who forced the reluctant king to sign a new constitution, later known as the Bayonet Constitution which greatly curtailed the monarch's power, and placed the executive power in the hands of the Cabinet. When Kalakaua died in January 1891, Lili'uokalani ascended the throne. In January 1892 the queen proclaimed a new constitution which would restore power to the throne and rights to the Native Hawaiians, at the same time a group of non-native businessmen formed an Annexation Club, the goal of which was the overthrow of the queen and annex the kingdom to the United States. In an effort to difuse the mounting crisis, the queen, who wished to avoid bloodshed, issued a proclamation declaring that she would not seek to alter the constitution except by constitutional means. The Committee of Safety, however, denounced her and requested troops  - 162 armed troops from the USS Boston came ashore and Lili'uokalani was deposed. <br>  <br>  An appeal sent to President Grover Cleveland stalled in congress and led to ten days of fighting between Hawaiian royalists and the revolutionary government. The Queen was unlawfully arrested in January 1895, and imprisoned in the Iolani Palace, where she was presented with a document of abdication, which she was compelled to sign in order to save her loyalists from execution.
3cEqH3pfaa	The Safavids (1501-1736) established Shi'i Islam as the by far dominant religion of what is essentially Iran today (though their territory on occasions spread much further). Compared to the neighbouring Ottoman  Empire it was relatively weak, but strong enough to cause this empire to be cautious. It main struggles in the east were with the Ghilzai Afghans.Its stongest significance was that it unified Iran. Prior to the safavids, Iran was disorganised and highly fragmented. The Safavids centralized and unified to a degree rarely seen before in the area. They imposed (through a variety of means) Shi'i Islam and developed a strong army and centralised administration. It also developed strong trade and commerce links, a flowering of cultural activities and merging of Islamic with some ancient philosophies, such as Aristotelian and Neo-Platonic thought. In spite of their zeal for Shi'i Islam, they were surprisingly tolerant towards other religions -Christians, for example, were allowed to travel freely, own property and worship unhindered.<br>  The Holy Roman Empire in the same period was almost the exact opposite - a patchwork of states & free cities all under the nominal rule of an Emperor who had no real control of the Empire. It was religiously divided (Catholics, Lutherans and Calvinists), military weak and an administrative nightmare. Religious intolerance was the norm - it would be very unpleasant if you were not of the same religion of the ruler, and everywhere, especially so if you were not Christian. The Jews in many parts of the Holy Roman Empire still operated under medieval restrictions on movement, occupations, and where and to worship.|`|wUq7oinGaa	It was one of the Turkish empires.  Sandwiched in between the Ottoman and Mughal empire, it was the weakest one of the three.  It was obviously Muslim.  It was also had centralized government.<br>  <br>  In contrast the Holy Roman Empire was a confederation of loosely tied German states with the emperor being emperor only because the most powerful dukes allowed him to be.  Obviously it was Christian.  And also it was the most powerful kingdom(s) in Europe during the 16th century.

But that has nothing at all to do with what makes a book a good book!<br>  <br>  What makes a book good is the ability to tell a story and how easily your sucked in by the story. Most importantly a good book is one that you enjoy and have fun reading! Writers have lots of ways of doing this and none is more wrong than another... they're just different, nothing more. Stephanie Meyers method of writing is very basic and even childish but thats what makes it simple and easy to read.

She has a very limited sense of vocabulary for description on appearance.<br>  <br>  But I think writing grammatically and well versed in a wide range of vocabulary words doesn't always get you far. It is the way the writer drags you into the story. In this case I think Stephenie did well by relating to alot of her readers (Not just teenagers or "Stupid, Moronic adults") and bringing them into the story.<br>  <br>  Over all if you can get past the lack of description I think the story was just fine- not good enough to be ranked next to Harry Potter or Jane Austen- but fine all the same.|`|Y7zYPbMuaa	no...i DISAGREE...|`|YpmcXaNJaa	Nup I liked it :)|`|w51hObZyaa	Finally!

Hmm. Well, Twilight takes lots of space here daily.]<br>  <br>  The book and a half I read were enough for me.<br>  I'd already seen books on Amazon by a Stephanie Meyer and presumably her husband, 'how-to books' for teens; now long gone, not 'cause they sold out. <br>  One day there, the very next: gone.<br>  I'd also read the (no-longer-as-it-was) Wiki entry about her and the 'dream' that led her to write these books. When only 'Twilight' made a few ripples.<br>  <br>  I explored her due to the (also now rarely-seen anymore, if ever) footage of a Canadian TV show that ran from 2001-2002, called "Vampire High" that used to be on YouTube. <br>  It was also mentioned in the Wiki entry. Meyer had her 'dream' in early (maybe it was mid; does it matter much?) 2003. <br>  An interesting coincidence, since "Vampire High" was all about youngish-looking vampires entering regular high schools with regular humans, and one vampire falls in love w/a human girl...<br>  You get that picture.<br>  <br>  Anyway. I read as much (of the now-called 'saga') as I could, because the book was recommended by someone who usually has better taste (pun intended; that person also reads romance books to 'lighten up' after school work, so I shoulda' known better)... <br>  I found not only very poor writing, but also absurd characterization, flat and unreal plotting... In fact, every single one of the "no-no's" of good writing. Sheesh. <br>  <br>  Most who don't like Twilight will not answer this question, except perhaps those who remain at this site to gain points answering only Twi questions and to defend the honor of Meyer. <br>  These poor kids have apparently never read many books and many are quite young. Yet too many think nothing of giving actual death threats and that kind of thing to any who doubt Mrs. Meyer's 'sanctity' in regards her books. It's really too bad.<br>  <br>  I also read that Meyer herself never read, for example, Dracula, or Frankenstein, or any vamp-Rice books... In fact she too, rarely read any books at all, besides her favorite one, the Book of Mormon. Now she reads the competition. And recommends more junk reading.<br>  Eh. She still can't write, and it's a sorry state of affairs that some won't ever get past waiting for her next travesty. <br>  ADD: I'll echo your other answer: How did you manage to read the entire series?<br>  <br>  2nd ADD: For the 'teacher-to-be' and readers who  think 'a simple style' is just fine: <br>  It is fine, if it's well-done. <br>  I still like Dr. Seuss books. Those are good. I like short fiction, by necessity 'simple' but also by necessity (for publication) 'good.' <br>  <br>  You are (at OSU) really studying to be a teacher? Then surely you know 'simple styles' that are also 'good' reading. "The Lottery" is simple but good. <br>  Poe's short fiction is simple but good. "Catcher in the Rye," "The Giving Tree," and more, a lot more, all 'good.' <br>  You either aren't a future teacher, or you are set on the 'freedom' of feeding your maybe future students pap, and will do them no good that way. (btw, future prof, suggest you use 'you're' and not "your" in class for a sentence re: one here; edits are your 'friends')<br>  <br>  ADD for 'Kelly' ..Yes, I do expect teens (tweens are just a bit different, and I question their reading this series at all; it sets up poor ideas about relationships)..I expect teens to read good books. They don't have to be 'by the smartest man on earth' (hah) but they CAN be good books. Teens are much smarter than you apparently think.<br>  <br>  One more ADD: See? A lover of the saga thinks you shouldn't have read the books, so you "...couldn't speak negatively about them." There is the start of Twi-fan censorship.

SEYvpj8naa	Mill would advocate forcing the musician to stop using drugs in order to save his talent only if doing so would increase the total net happiness in the world.  He would support this position because he is a utilitarian and thus a consequentialist.  To a utilitarian, something is right based on the consequences it produces, i.e. producing the greatest amount of net happiness.<br>  <br>  Kant's reaction would be more complicated.  In Kant's explanation of the Categorical Imperative ("Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"), he discusses people who chose not to develop their talents.  He asserts that not cultivating one's talents violates the Categorical Imperative and is therefore wrong.  <br>  <br>  However, Kant also asserts that people should always be treated as ends in themselves and never as means to achieve an end.  Kant is a strict nonconsequentialist - he believes that there are certain moral duties which must always be followed, regardless of the consequences.  Kant would believe that forcing an individual to do anything in order to bring about certain desirable states of affairs is wrong.  So although Kant would agree that the musician is acting immorally by losing his talents to drug addiction, he would also contend that forcing the musician to enter rehab is morally inexcusable.|`|wD86088oaa	Both Kant and Mill would say send him to rehab. Kant believed in the Categorical Imperative--a moral obligation to society to act as if you were a representative of that society. So, Kant would see the musician as a role model, who is destroying society by influencing them toward drug use. <br>  <br>  Mill was a Utilitarian. He believed that all action should bring the greatest amount of justice (utility) to the individual (and, in turn, to society). Mill would have sent the musician to rehab for the his own personal benefit and for the benefit of society.|`|y9N3DsKBaa	kant and Mill were both into the rights of the group or society over the individual.

DiRI58buaa	Prima facie duties are supposed to be duties that are self evident.  They are your starting assumptions.  So in Biomedical Ethics, you are assuming it is morally right to be beneficent and just and morally wrong to be malevolent.  Until proven wrong, these assumptions are enforced.<br>  Situation:<br>  A patient is in pain.  As a doctor, you have a duty to be benevolent, so you give them pain killers to stop the pain because otherwise you would be acting malevolent by withholding pain killers you could administer.|`|y8bFwXZEaa	Those principles are the same one written in the Constitution of the U.S., whether implied or explicit.<br>  <br>  However, they are not duties, not even in bioethics. They are matters of ethics, just as the name says, and ethics cannot be duties, because a "duty" erases the nature of ethics.<br>  <br>  We don't owe our fellows a "duty" of respect; the right to disrespect does not belong to us. We therefore break a covenant, you might say, of Aristotle's Man qua man: If we are going to BE a man "qua man," we do so by living up to the highest standards we can imagine of human ethics. Duty wipes out the need for standards.<br>  <br>  "The meaning of the term “duty” is: the moral necessity to perform certain actions for no reason other than obedience to some higher authority, without regard to any personal goal, motive, desire or interest."

3L4citcnaa	Do you see the theme in each of the couplets? They each speak of something young, vibrant, and full-of-life, and then describe how time destroys it. Now look at the title of the poem: To the VIRGINS to MAKE MUCH OF TIME. All of the young, vibrant things in poem: rosebuds, flower, sun, and so on, is being compared and likened to a virgin: a young girl in her prime. The poem warns that she will not remain vibrant and young forever, for time will make her old. As such, the speaker is urging virgins to lose their virginity. For example, "The be not coy but use your time...for having lost but once your prime, you may forever tarry." In other words, don't be shy about losing your virginity, for once time has made you old, and you're no longer a young supple girl, you will never get back your lost time, and will likely end up a spinster. <br>  <br>  Remember, this poem is fairly old. Look at the diction, if you don't know the exact date. Back then, if a girl did not marry when she was young, there wasn't much chance of her marrying when she became older, and thus she is deemed spinster, or old maid. The poem warns against this, and urges girls to take advantage of their youthful sexiness, essentially, and go get laid. <br>  <br>  Also, as a note, in case you didn't know, the word "marry" means "indeed" rather than "matrimony"|`|EpOU7vGYaa	its about a young boy who loves a girl and how he missed his chance with her and how he wasted all the time missing her.|`|9PbyjAEXaa	i think it means that they r gonna do it, and the girl will not be a virgin tomorrow, because of deflowering, i guess, and that they can go get married and the guy will be close to c****** and ya.

In WWI  the reaction was fierce patriotism and a desire to defend the motherland. <br>  Massive recruitment of troops beyond their capabilities to handle at the time.

And even after enlisting, waited months for equipment and uniforms, let alone adequate training and leadership.<br>  <br>  The poster below is incorrect as the US did participate in the WWI slaughter.

bocePfyYaa	I am curious. What made you choose Nikon? I am not saying don't get one, but just curious why you chose Nikon. Is it just because they are popular? If so, that is the wrong reason to choose one brand over the other. Out of fairness, I am going to tell you about the model in your price range from the top three DSLR manufacturers and then let you make your decision.<br>  <br>  First of all, I agree with what others have said about not needing to get the best camera body you can afford. Lenses retain most of their value as you can use them for decades as long as you take care of them. Camera bodies-not so. DSLRs have a life of 5-7 years and most people replace them before then.<br>  <br>  Nikon-I would say go for a D60. The D40 is 6MPand that is enough to make decent enlargements, but with today's technology is pushing it on being obsolete. So, the D60-you can get it with the 18-55mm kit lens for $599. It is 10.2MP, gets 3fps, and has an ISO range of 100-1600.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/542463-REG/Nikon_25438_D60_SLR_Digital_Camera.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/54...</a><br>  <br>  Canon-With Canon, I would say to get the XS with the 18-55mm kit lens for $529. It is 10.1MP, gets 3fps, and has an ISO range of 100-1600.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/571144-REG/Canon_2762B003_EOS_Rebel_XS_a_k_a_.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/57...</a><br>  <br>  Sony-Now this one depends on whether you like live view or not. The a200 does not have live view. The a300 has an articulated LCD live view screen that tilts out. That and price are the only, and I do mean the only differences between them. You can get the a200 with the 18-70mm kit lens for $499. Or you can get the a300 with the 18-70mm kit lens for $599. They are both 10.2MP, and both get 3fps and both have an ISO range of 100-3200.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?O=search&A=search&Q=&sb=bs%2Cupper%28ds%29&sq=asc&sortDrop=Brand%3A+A+to+Z&ac=&bsi=&bhs=t&ci=6222&shs=&at=Brand_Sony&x=67&y=17" rel="nofollow">http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controll...</a><br>  <br>  You are almost definitely going to want a super telephoto lens eventually and if you have any interest in doing portraits, a good portrait lens. I say to get one of those kits and a memory card and a camera case for now. Save up some money and buy a Tamron 18-250mm. There is one for the Nikon, Canon and Sony mounts. It costs $459. This is an excellent super wide/super telephoto zoom lens. Trust me. You won't regret getting this lens. You will want to be on the lookout for about a 35mm 1.4 lens for portraits if you want to do portraiture. Using those lenses, you will learn what other lenses you will want. You can get a fish eye adapter that you can attach to a lens for fairly cheap.<br>  <br>  Whether you go new or used, B&H is a great place to buy from. They have great service and shipping and they pack the items the best I have seen. There is no sales tax for non-NY residents and ground shipping is usually free, expecially for DSLRs.|`|162603d72ddcf3279ac7690bc9b8ba0daa	The D80 body only is $589.95 at B&H.  With the 18-135 kit lens  $749.95.  Check the used prices at www.keh.com.  None of the kit lenses make a very good macro, and the Nikon fisheye 10.5mm is about $700 new, and the super wide 12-24 is over $850.  60mm macro Nikon is about $450.  Used body from a reliable dealer or craigslist would save you some money, but the great lenses hold their value pretty much.|`|duyHLEEnaa	Hey,<br>  Personal The D40 would be better yes less megapixal but its more user friendly and as an armature you don't need the D80 functions. it sound like it going to be your first DSLR. also your best investing in the D40 then buying Nikon's macro lenses. rather then sigma or tamron, you wont loss any sharpness and your AF will be alot quicker, i started with the D50 and its just the same as the D40 nearly now i have a D200 and a D2X.<br>  <br>  Daz XD|`|RXamcvhOaa	I'm also no pro, but I just purchased a Nikon D60.  I really like it.  Most of the advice I found was to save your money on the camera body and spend like crazy on lenses.  Unless you're trying to become a professional, you don't need a crazy fancy camera.  I found a really good deal on mine at Sam's Club, which came with a Nikkor 18-55mm lens (this was about 5 months ago).  I would definitely look around some more and ask a lot of people. There are a ton of websites out there where photographers offer advice. Oh, if you wind up buying a used body, make sure it will be compatible with new lenses, even if you have to use an adapter.

Also, Cyndislist.com has LOTS of links to help you get started. Free sites are getting harder to find....<br>  <br>  You can't do it all online. For good face to face help check for a genealogy club in your area AND check for a Family History Center...that, IMHO, is your best bet for getting started. The staff there will help you quite a bit. No, you do not need to be a Mormon or join the church to use their resources (I have come across these misconceptions often).|`|05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	There are over 400,000 free sites.<br>  They all require research skills.<br>  No one who spells as poorly as you would be able to use them.

We get your question many time a day. So I have cut and am pasting an answer.<br>  <br>  Websites that only have family trees are not worth a tinker's curse unless you are willing to verify the information with documents/records. They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.<br>  <br>  Right before Christmas of 2008, I found out I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1957. It was the same year Hurricane Audrey hit in our part of the world. Hey! we had been dead for 51 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!<br>  <br>  I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.<br>  <br>  This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.<br>  <br>  Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family trees.<br>  <br>  Cyndi'sList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.<br>  <br>  Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.<br>  <br>  However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.<br>  <br>  Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.<br>  <br>  A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.<br>  <br>  They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know. Just call the nearest Mormon Church or visit their free website, FamilySearch.org, to get their hours for the general public.<br>  <br>  Rootsweb and FamilySearch.org are 2 free sites but remember verify information in family trees with documents/records. If you don't you don't know whether it is accurate or not.

I learned most of what I know about writing simply from reading well written books and practicing writing. Also practice makes perfect. If there is somewhere for you to take classes then do. Take an AP literature class and study how those writers did it. You can major in English or Creative writing with the latter being the most influential in order to sharpen your skills. Mind you, colleges that teach creative writing don't teach you how to write commercial fiction. These are your Harry Potters, Twilights, Clicks, or any mainstream novel. Instead they teach literary fiction which are the books you might consider boring. Books by people like, Charles Dickens, Ernest Hemingway, and others. Don't get me wrong, creative writing programs are great. I'm in one now. The techniques they teach you are literary in nature but can help you when writing stronger commercial fiction. And who knows you might find yourself more inclined to writing literary commercial fiction like J.R.R Tolkien and C.S.Lewis. Good luck and practice practice PRACTICE!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Stressing over a novel? Feeling all alone? Visit and subscribe to this blog and follow the writer as she struggles to make an idea reality. <a href="http://jcthejourney.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://jcthejourney.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  Edit: You can skip the whole class thing but in this day and age why would you? There are too many professionals offering their expertise for you to pass it up. Besides most of the excellent writers who are self taught most likely lived durring a time when there were no creative writing teachers. The only way was to do it themselves.|`|SBhVZD4Xaa	you don't have to take any classes or attend any seminars, you just write and read a lot<br>  many writers are self taught|`|5L6z92Iqaa	Write. Simple as that. A writer writes. An author publishes. Big difference.<br>  <br>  Take journalism classes in high school and some creative writing courses if they are available. It is never too early to start preparing. Most High schools offer alot of courses to help establish a writers knack. Write in your spare time durring breaks, lunch, and after school. Devote yourself to your stories and your characters and realize that your first peice of work probably wont see the light of day in the publishing world.<br>  <br>  If writing is what you want to do professionally and you want to become a published author then I definately urge you to Major in English Literature, Creative writing, Journalism, etc.. in college. <br>  <br>  Also, to help round out your writing style some improv acting classes can be extremely helpful for creative ideas and getting to know dialogue.|`|AN02OYPlaa	Look for writing tips all over the internet. Apply them to your own writing. Write a book. Get some honest critiques. Edit to death...and then attempt to publish your finished work. <br>  I'm not really sure...school doesn't really have an impact on me. For me, it's a writing website that I've gotten lots of help from. It's actually a fansite for a game, but focuses mainly on writing. The owner of the website is trying to publisher himself, along with some other members. Point being, you should try finding websites like that, too. They're all over the place, but typically places like fanfiction.net aren't the most helpful. You should try reading agent's blogs, etc. as well for writing tips. Best of luck.|`|ryAEsx8laa	There's a big difference between fiction and non-fiction. Journalism can help a lot if you are writing non-fiction or crime fiction. <br>  <br>  For fiction, you want English classes. You also should read books on writing and understand plotting, characterization, pacing, etc. Look for how these are dealt with in the books you read.<br>  <br>  Practice writing.<br>  <br>  With the possible exception of journalism, most writers don't earn a living. Many don't get their books published. Have a back-up plan for making a living.|`|svYiQZUHaa	Write Books in high school.|`|X1JuFzOIaa	take lots of LA classes and in college you could major in literature.<br>  but in my opinion the biggest factor is how much you want it. you might have to work long and hard before anything you write is recognized. so don't give up! :)
SU3HNfvPaa	Okay well OPEC is an organization that manages the trade of oil. It is formed of many countries in the middle east and a few elsewhere. The only logical answer is D because industrialized countries need petroleum/oil for multiple reasons|`|3L4citcnaa	How can you not know that the answer is D) ECONOMIC INFLUENCE OVER INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES. ?<br>  <br>  OPEC does, after all, stand for Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. They control petrol production, selling, and whatnot. That basically rules out A and C. Petrol has nothing to do with waterways. B can also be ruled out because petrol is not exported exclusively to tropical regions. Even if you weren't able to tell right off that it's D, process of elimination should help you out. <br>  <br>  D. is obviously the best answer. Industrialized nations rely on petrol to run their factories, cars, heaters, etc. They cannot live without it.

I patron some of my local bookstores (usually for coffee) and when I'm there and have time I'll pick up a graphic novel I want to read but don't want to buy. I've managed to finish entire manga series doing that.  I go to the coffee shop get something to drink than I go into the shelves pick up the volume I'm on and sit in one of the lounging chairs.  Sometimes if I get into the story, I'll be there for a couple of hours, and noone has ever said anything to me (though I don't do it very often and I do it at more than one store).<br>  <br>  With shipping and handling I'm not finding the series online any cheeper than you listed (cheapest used for first book with S&H ends up being 11.66 USD).|`|Zq37XNRbaa	Try eBay, or maybe Amazon.|`|RuIKEI4Eaa	www.ebookhood.com<br>  <br>  ABSOLUTELY FREE!!!!
nfUomw3caa	Passive civil disobedience to draw attention to injustices and discrimination in the United States at the time. The first example of this was the Montgomery, Alabama  bus boycott. This was started by Rosa Parks refusing to yield her seat to a white man on her way home from  work on Dec.1 1955. Rosa Parks is arrested after allegedly violating bus segregation laws. She is charged with disorderly conduct.<br>  <br>  On  December 2 a group of Black Montgomery activists, including professor Jo Ann Robinson, attorney Fred Gray and labor leader E.D. Nixon, begin setting the stage for a bus boycott.  <br>  <br>  On December 5, Rosa Parks is convicted and fined in Montgomery city court. A one-day boycott of city buses results in about 90 percent of normal black ridership staying off buses. The Montgomery Improvement Association is formed by black leaders, who elect the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. president. Several thousand black citizens attend the first MIA mass meeting at Holt Street Baptist Church, where they overwhelmingly support continuing the bus boycott. <br>  <br>  December 5, the first negotiations between MIA leaders and city and bus company officials deadlock over a proposal by MIA spokesmen for a bus seating policy that is more fair to blacks but still segregated.<br>  <br>  A great number of legal action are filed and dismissed or appealed to higher courts and homes of different black leaders are bombed but no one is injured. The home of Lutheran minister Robert Graetz, a white member of the MIA board, is bombed. No one is injured. <br>  <br>  On June 5 1956 Federal judges Rives and Johnson rule the city and state bus segregation laws are unconstitutional. Lynne dissents.<br>  This is not the end of appeals on the case but in the end desegregation of bus system throughout the south is enacted.<br>  <br>  Tough thing for all minorities, and white people too, was that was only the beginning. The Civil War made all men free in 1865 it took more then 100 years for the courts and laws to catch up with the last full measure of devotion that Mr. Lincoln's army had so nobly advanced. It also took many more demonstrations of non-violent protest. Yes, there was some violent protest also.|`|xncJ1uFmaa	Martin Luther King became famous world wide like Mahatma Gandhi & the klu klux clan unleashed attacks on black men, I believe.

3L4citcnaa	I did think that the overall idea was rather clever, though I have a few critiques. <br>  <br>  First of all, I think only E.E. Cummings could get away with not capitalizing in his poetry. Unless it is being used as a device to accomplish a certain feel (and in the case of your poem, I don't believe that it is) it really just bespeaks of laziness to not press that pesky "shift" button. <br>  <br>  Second, what is with the stilted rhyme scheme? Again, I only know of one poet who could really get away with alternating rhyme and no rhyme in the same poem: Emily Dickinson. She often used this to a certain effect. Again, I do not believe this to be the case for you. If you stopped using rhyme at the last sentence of the first stanza, and continued that way throughout the second, it woulde make sense, because you are revealing a change in the reader's understanding of what the speaker is saying. <br>  <br>  Third: While this is not really necessary, it really bothers me that your syllables in the first stanza don't match up. The first line is 8, the second is 9, the third is 8, and the fourth is 7. This sounds alright, though I would like it better if the fourth line were 9 syllables, like "I come out now on this dreary day," or something. But of course, it is your poem, and I doubt a professional critic would get on your case about that. Structured syllables is one of those artistic liberties most poets can take. <br>  <br>  Overall, this poem is not bad, though I think you could add more to it to make it truly great. Add another stanza or two to explain why you are your own worst enemy. <br>  <br>  Good luck in future writing!|`|I0waERKqaa	Great awesome!!!|`|Ko7NMfoAaa	its ok|`|AfUuMEqVaa	I don't know too much about poetry, but your poem suggests that you don't like yourself, in my opinion.

draNVjbkaa	Getting into voice over acting is a hefty investment. Largely because you have to invest thousands of dollars in putting together a demo reel that shows your range as a voice actor. There are different types of voiceovers. Commercials are the biggest chunk. Then there are promo, narrative, foreign language, audiobook, and animation. <br>  <br>  Before forking over thousands of dollars to get your reel, get a lot of training before. Good training consists of proper vocal exercises and warmup, proper diction in American standard English, breaking down a VO script into phrases, and being able to make that script come to life and not just some regular read. Improv is also highly recommended as well for you want to be able to loosen up and use your imagination when you're in that isolation chamber (recording booth).
kfOpbbCyaa	Catherine treated Heathcliff poorly, so at first I felt very sorry for him. However, he became so bitter and consumed with the need for revenge that he tried to harm everyone, including the completely innocent. To put it mildly, he annoyed me.<br>  <br>  I don't believe I misunderstood his character. Look what he did to the next generation, including his own son. What Catherine had done to him was bad enough, but for him to turn around and attempt to destroy everything and everyone around him was just too much. My initial sympathy could not survive his vengeance.<br>  <br>  Actually, I thought his amazing passion and love turned into something more akin to haunted obsession. But that just might be me.<br>  <br>  It's a great story, though.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	No, he's not misunderstood. He is a savage.  He's a horrible man.  The fact that he loves Catherine does not make him a good man.  Even Catherine herself, who knows him better than anyone, knows that he is a horrible man.  She tries to warn Isabella, who she does care about, against giving her heart to Heathcliff, because she knows what Heathcliff will do to her.  "I'd as soon put that little canary into the park on a winter's day, as recommend you to bestow your heart on him!...don't imagine that he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior! He's not a rough diamond - a pearl-containing oyster of a rustic: he's a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man."<br>  <br>  Heathcliff himself knows that he is a horrible man.  In fact, Heathcliff goes to great lengths to make SURE he is not "misunderstood".  After he runs away with Isabella, he describes to Nelly about how he tried to make his feelings and intentions as clear as possible to Isabella before they ever left, just so she would be clear on the fact.  "I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature, so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character and acting on the false impressions she cherished...I don't care who knows that the passion was wholly on one side: and I never told her a lie about it. She cannot accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful softness. The first thing she saw me do, on coming out of the Grange, was to hang up her little dog; and when she pleaded for it, the first words I uttered were a wish that I had the hanging of every being belonging to her, except one..."<br>  <br>  He tortures animals, he tortures people...he is a poison that destroys everything he comes in contact with...INCLUDING the woman he loves. No one in the novel is in denial that Heathcliff is horrible, including Heathcliff.  The only time there's a "misunderstanding" when it comes to Heathcliff, is when people try to over-psychoanalyze him into the role of some sort of victim.  He's not.|`|E70A7aqcaa	It's been soooooooooo long since I read "Wuthering Heights" that the only thing I can remember about it was how incredibly boring it was.  Sorry I can't be of more  help.

DtotNQ3oaa	FORTY 7 is right and there is also a form of genocide that destroys an entire people without murdering outright,like in the USA. I can't be too specific but it is worldwide also.You may understand.|`|heF3HIzQaa	Genocide has a precise definition. It is an attempt to wipe out a whole gene pool - an entire ethnic group; as the Germans attempted with Jews and Gypsy's, as Turks attempted with Armenians, and was attempted in Rwanda by Hutus massacring Tutsis - among others.<br>  <br>  What action should be taken? It should always be opposed by any means possible and necessary.

The only way to prevent something like this from happening would be to blow the threat off with a missile before it could do any damage on the target. The government or armed forces would have to intervene in this scenario.|`|882aadf45b04a15ccacc11c27555a716aa	If both sides in a conflict are totally liquidated, then the genocide problem is both null & void.  It's when one side has survivors that genocide becomes a problem, as the genocide just continues on.  Tragically, the only way to eliminate genocide is by using genocide.

KNN4a8uYaa	Well, it also depends on the type of Polaroid camera you're talking about.  For the 600 camera, there's things ya can do, like image manipulation by applying the eraser on a pencil to the image as it develops.  Aside from that, there aren't too many other applications I can think of.<br>  <br>  For cameras that use peel apart film, like the Land Camera 200 series through 400 series, and the Reporter, as well as the test shots for cameras with Polaroid backs (medium format and larger) - there are plenty of uses.  Yes, it'll help give a good idea how the lighting works for test shots.  Also, even with Fuji's FP-100C, which IS usable in any camera that accepts the 3.25x4.25 and 4x5 film, can be used for Emulsion Lifts and Image Transfers, like the venerable Type 669.  It's not quite as useful as Polaroid Type 669 (it doesn't take to well to objects with excessive curving, and it doesn't take to textures quite as well as it's predecessor), but it still is quite usable for these purposes.  I've been pretty well focusing on these techniques for a few years now, and I have been pretty well immersed in this film.|`|g8kIjpwSaa	There is no advantage to having a Polaroid camera. Mainly because polaroid film is being discontinued. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.polaroid.com/ifilm/en/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.polaroid.com/ifilm/en/index.h...</a>|`|bocePfyYaa	The advantage used to be that you could get instant gratification. You could also take questionable pictures without having to worry about having them processed. With the advent of digital, those advantages are basically gone. And as someone else said, polaroid is discontinuing the film. Unless someone like Fujifilm picks it up, there will eventually be no more. So I think that you would be wasting $60. Instead, maybe you should buy a pogo. It is a portable photo printer.|`|qXAvXHdYaa	There were a lot of professionals that would use polaroid or polaroid backs on their medium format cameras.  They did this to test out some theories/techniques or the lighting to verify they had what they wanted.  This way they are not wasting expensive medium format negative film on test shots they would have to take somewhere and get developed.<br>  <br>  With digital, you do not really need a polaroid for that reason.  Some people might like the nostalgic look/feel of the polaroid, but with a little photoshop creativity, you can create a "polaroid-ish" type design and look.|`|oXPDFw4daa	Polaroid no longer manufactures film for their cameras.<br>  <br>  Fuji makes a similar product, but it does not fit all Polaroid cameras.<br>  <br>  So in general, a Polaroid camera at this point is essentially a museum piece.  There is no practical function.|`|z581p8qXaa	Polaroid photo's have a unique value, and I love them. However, unless you are ready to really pay for every photo--stick to digital.  But if you can afford it, I recommend doing polaroid.

b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	I have to agree with Slightly Amused.  Yashica TLR's are really good.  I have a Yashica A, and it's one of my favorite cameras now.  It's very reliable and solidly built, and it takes incredibly sharp pictures.  I bought it on eBay for about $65, and in my opinion it was worth every penny.  You might be able to find one for around $50, but seriously if you can afford it, it's worth more than that.  <br>  <br>  Just be careful, and be sure it has a detailed description.  The seller should say that the lens is clear with no scratches or fungus, that the shutter fires, that the aperture control dial turns, etc.  I don't expect the seller to have actually tested the camera with a roll of film, but they should at least have checked the camera first.  If the seller says something like "oh, I don't know anything about cameras" then forget it.  The more detailed the description is, the better.<br>  <br>  If you've never used a Twin Lens Reflex camera before, it will feel a little awkward at first.  They're kind of heavy, and it feels strange looking in the view screen at the top of the camera, instead of a normal viewfinder like on 35mm cameras.   Also, because it uses a mirror, your view will be reversed.  That took me a little while to get used to...everytime I wanted to pan the camera left, everything shifted to the right!  But you'll get used to it, and the large screen does help a lot with composing your pictures.  <br>  <br>  The only thing is that medium format cameras are getting really popular right now for some reason, and they're selling for very high prices on eBay.  Some people try to say that "no one uses film anymore"...well, that is NOT true at all, because I was just outbid on the last 3 cameras I tried to buy.  In fact, the last medium format folding camera I tried to buy ended up having over 10 bids and sold for $120.  So you might have to look around for a while to find one.<br>  <br>  Another good TLR camera that you might be able to find for a little cheaper is a Graflex 22.  I have one, and it takes good pictures.  It's not quite as sharp as the Yashica A, but it still takes really good pictures and I've been happy with it.  <br>  <br>  Both the Yashica A and Graflex 22 are completely manual...manual focus, shutter speed, and aperture control.  So you'll have to learn how to use manual exposure.  But that's better anyway, so you'll be able to have more control and creativity in your pictures.  They also both use 120 film.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!|`|31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	You can either get one that will work from a company that trades cameras or buys used ones, or you can go on eBay and look up terms like "yashica" "Minolta autocord, "Rolleiflex" Rolleicord.  There are many other brands.  Everything is determined by how good the camera functions.  I doubt that you can get a good working camera for 450.<br>  <br>  There are two models from Yashica that are basically the same thing.  they have light meters.  One is the Yashicamat 124 and the other is Yashicamat 124G.  Really, the G only stands for having Gold connections on the light meter.  <br>  <br>  The only real problems that I have encountered with Yashica TLR and other TLRs is tht if they are left unused for a while, the shutters will stick or slow down.  That requires a CLA to clean that up.  that is about $150 for that procedure alone.  The other problem is that if you are focusing at infinity, the lens will go beyond infinity just a little bit and your picture will be fuzzy.  <br>  <br>  My advice, then, is to know something about the cameras.  You can get good deals like a Rolleicord Vb that I recently purchased for a really nice deal, but it had the sticky shutter.  It cost me $150 to fix that and clean it up, but the camera is collector quality.  <br>  <br>  I like the TLRs, they are fun to use and you can spend from about $100 to $1200 depending upon brand and condition.|`|fMBREYmNaa	Twin Lens Reflex Cameras are hard to find, i saw two at cameta camera this weekend, they should still have them in stock|`|GQemfOANaa	yes I would suggest ebay or craigslist, or put a wanted advert in your local papers.|`|6srJbS6Vaa	I just found over $50 at Amazon.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1235390346/ref=sr_nr_seeall_8?ie=UTF8&rs=&keywords=Twin%20Lens%20Reflex&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3ATwin%20Lens%20Reflex%2Ci%3Aelectronics&tag=discount.save-20" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1235390346/r...</a>|`|TbTO5SXlaa	I suggest the Minolta Autocord TLR. There were several models so you might want to do a little research. The early models did not have a light meter and only used 120 film. Later models added a selenium light meter and used 120/220 film and the last models used a CDS metering system.<br>  <br>  I guarantee you will get some looks from people as you use your TLR.|`|k8AcVixTaa	You can find many on eBay.  You have to make sure that they are in working order.  <br>  <br>  There are several to choose from in this category.  I would go with the Yashica, the Mamiya, or a good old Rolleiflex.  Be ware of ones called Seagull.  They are cheap but not very good as far as lens quality goes.  Heck, even a Russian made Kiev will work well.<br>  <br>  My personal favorite is the Mamiya C220 or C330.  I have used several over the years and if my eyesight hadn't got so bad I would still have one.

AA10725882	Democracy in Egypt?  Ho Ho Ho<br>  Democracy had no place in Egypt for the period from 1805 to 1815 to 1882 when the British did take over the country.  Real Egyptians had little or no say in their own country until Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1952/56 -1970.<br>  <br>  Egypt was essentially lost to Napoleon after the Battle of the Nile in 1798 - though Napoelon did complete a temporary conquest before he left for France in 1799.<br>  <br>  After 1805, the history of Egypt fell under the power of an Ottoman pasha of Egypt, Muhammad Ali (1769 -1849) who would become known as the father of modern Egypt because of the economic, social, and political changes set in motion during his 44 years of personal rule.<br>  <br>  Mohammed Ali was Albanian, a former soldier.  He confiscated lands from native Egyptians.  He defied the Sultan in Istanbul.  He built an economy based on Egyptian cotton grown for the new steam powered cloth spinning and weaving factories of Britain.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, his son Said and grandson Ismail ran Egypt into debt so that the British took over the Suez Canal in 1875 and Egypt itself by ~1882.<br>  <br>  The battle of Waterloo prompted Muhammad Ali to return to Cairo in case the British tried to takeover his country, but that would not happen for another ~ 67 years.  The French were no longer a factor in Egypt in 1805 let alone 1815.  Much of Napoleon's army - which he had abandoned in Egypt in 1799 - died of diseases - including plague.  <br>  <br>  Egypt was a black mark on Napoleon's record.  His beloved soldiers - he treated abysmally.  He abandoned them to an ignoble end - much as he did during the retrreat from Russia in the terrible winter of 1812.<br>  <br>  Suggest - Research "Muhammad Ali Pasha"|`|AA11304025	It remained in the Ottoman Empire and eventually the British took over the running of the country from the 1880s after Egypt went bankrupt after paying for most of the cost of the Suez Canal.<br>  Egypt still remained theoretically part of the Ottoman Empire until 1918 .

People fall in "love" despite having nothing whatsoever in common and not even liking each other, let alone knowing each other.<br>  <br>  True love means that someone is your best friend and you love their company. It doesn't mean that you drool over their appearance and they drool over how good you smell. I know people who had "love" like Bella and Edward's. None of them are still together, and most now hate each other. Most of them weren't together for more than six months. Superficial attraction / lust doesn't last, and that's all any of the characters in Twilight have.|`|P0wMTzDFaa	It's the same.<br>  <br>  Just like Edward and Bella,we try to keep the ones we love without hurting them.<br>  (:|`|245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	If we're talking high school relationships, I think generally the same.<br>  <br>  The "romance" between Bella and Edward is based off of looks and is much more like lust.

LRPZJD5laa	probably dress, talk, etc. normally, but i'm guessing just as a mental image she/he would be unshaven and kinda scruffy looking|`|rPfyaQ6uaa	well, as a fellow writer, a drug dealer can be anyone, from a fearsome street thug to a wall street yuppie. but theyd want to attract as little attention as possible.theyd look normal, not highly wealthy, smell, dress and act the same as the people they keep company with (friends, family, co workers, etc). Drug dealers dont have a certain look, just as undercover law enforcements. a druge dealer could be many people. they just want to at least APPEAR normal|`|af5ac6e4768248c92fc36981d9f2cf71aa	i am with every one else they look like anyone else. i would also suggest that you do not write about any one from a different ethnic background or anyone with a dialect. theses things tick off people who are or know about them. they make you less believable. back to the drug dealer, think about how you want them to come across. are they friendly, are they a old trying to get by, are they steal your teeth to sell to dental school cruel?|`|AA10287019	Okay, they'd look like a regular person, but you'd get this sort of vibe that something's up, like they're sort of sneaky I guess.<br>  But whatever you do, DON'T make them to be the typical sterotype of one, with baggy jeans and all that. Seriously.<br>  hope this helps! :)|`|FxwPJqKJaa	they can be the most ordinary looking people. some are just a little more desperate. its all relative...|`|3reHk4I1aa	make them look like everyone else so that way they dont get caught like if it was a girl put her in like light colors and stuff like that but make them smell bad becuz they do drugs|`|AjqO1aJgaa	They'd look just like anyone else. People don't come with neat little appearance shortcuts to help you recognise them.|`|j6eWCkQLaa	Asian drug dealers tend to be bright and normal. Contrary to popular belief they do not look rugged or scruffy. You don't have to be 6 feet tall or seedy to be a drug dealer. & they don't live in seedy apartments. They usually rent out nice new ones.<br>  <br>  They see a market with potential and work with it. <br>  Most asian guys start off in high school. They usually begin as droppers once they have their license. Droppers do exactly that. They wait for a call to a location and deliver usually a small rock for $20 (few customers buy $100 - $400) It's very much a business. They get a call and they say they'll be there in 5 - 10 minutes (usually taking 15) <br>  Down is generally "gift wrapped" in small neat packages and up is usually in the form of wrapped stones. <br>  <br>  At the end of their shift they bring what remains of the stuff & money back to the apartment. The droppers then sit down, usually ordering some chinese food, and begin a whole lot of accounting. Recording down the names of customers, amount of ups sold, downs sold etc. <br>  While they are doing this the next person on call will usually be at the apartment on the internet etc. until they get a call (then they're off) <br>  <br>  The person that owns the apartment,stuff = gives a cut to the workers. Workers have about 1000 by the end of the week. Not much but for an 18 year old in Canada it isn't bad. <br>  This person counts the bags of money and does the whole accounting shtick again. Problems only arise if there is money missing (people rarely rarely get killed = that's for stupid people) The average asian dealer wears plain Hugo boss shirts (usually in black) or Armani. No they do not smell bad and yes they shave. Like everyone else they shower and smell normal.  Some druggies give collateral (Psps, wedding rings etc) and if one of the workers likes what he sees he'll just give him the rock & take the collateral to keep :) Usually the rock is not nearly as expensive but druggies don't tend to care too much.<br>  <br>  The average drug dealer does not do drugs and you'll be hard pressed to find an asian drug dealer who does. They are not that stupid. They usually have 2 - 3 different cars so that regular drops don't look sketchy. These are usually cars like the new corola's (grey, green etc) that won't attract attention and will blend in easily with regular cars.<br>  Successful drug dealers know how to handle money. With asian drug dealers you don't get the usual bravado because they know that money talks.They usually move every few months and make the rounds untill they have a decent amount. 2 mill is usually the mark.<br>  Drug dealers hire people to do drops= These people are usually recommended trusted friends or are friends & usually become friends because they spend so much time with them. Sometimes he will pay for a trip to say hawaii for all of them. The average asian drug dealer has a "good girl" asian girlfriend who is usually nice, smart and hangs out with the workers and her boyfriend at their appartment. Some asian drug dealers have cute little dogs they buy $200 Juicy jackets for too :)
XxtVwslraa	Read and write. OFTEN! The best way to learn your craft is to study those who perfected it before you. I learned most of what I know about writing simply from reading well written books and practicing writing. Also practice makes perfect. If there is somewhere for you to take classes then do. Take an AP literature class and study how those writers did it. You can major in English or Creative writing with the latter being the most influential in order to sharpen your skills. Mind you, colleges that teach creative writing don't teach you how to write commercial fiction. These are your Harry Potters, Twilights, Clicks, or any mainstream novel. Instead they teach literary fiction which are the books you might consider boring. Books by people like, Charles Dickens, Ernest Hemingway, and others. Don't get me wrong, creative writing programs are great. I'm in one now. The techniques they teach you are literary in nature but can help you when writing stronger commercial fiction. And who knows you might find yourself more inclined to writing literary commercial fiction like J.R.R Tolkien and C.S.Lewis. Good luck and practice practice PRACTICE!!!<br>  <br>  Now getting published is another thing entirely.<br>  <br>  Stressing over a novel? Feeling all alone?

If u did, u should read The Host by Stephenie Meyer and The Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice|`|ELOWvAaLaa	i really enjoyed the Uglies Series. they are science fiction novels that take place in a future society. all of the characters are "ugly" until they turn 16 and undergo a surgery that makes them "pretty". the main character Tally Youngblood can't wait to turn pretty so she could be with her best friend Peris, but then she meets Shay and everything changes. it's a really interesting series. you should definitely read it! hope i helped! :D|`|Yo3awDQmaa	These are my personal recommendations for books:<br>  (You can find my personal opinion of the one’s I’ve read at my blog CasCanRead.com)<br>  <br>  The House of Night series---It knocked me straight out of my Twilight obsession. Even though I am still hyped about the DVD and New Moon movie. The ending of the last book drove me nuts and I can't wait to find out what happens next.<br>  <br>  The Morganville Vampire series—This series is pure amazingness. Love, Love, Love it! It’s really at a tie with House of Night with amazingness.<br>   <br>  Vampire Academy series--I just finished this and I can't wait for the next one! It was awesome and totally made me cry like a million time and make me angry. It sure does keep you on your toes.<br>  <br>  Evermore by Alyson Noel- Very interesting. I could not put it down!<br>  <br>  Society of S—This book is very interesting. I believe it may be an adult book, but I’m not sure. It’s about a thirteen year old girl, but her vocabulary and English is advanced. It’s a good read though.<br>  <br>  Peeps—very interesting (in a guys point of view.)<br>  <br>  Someone Like You by Sarah Dessen—awesome book!<br>  <br>  The Gallagher Girls series is interesting...It's about a girl that goes to spy school. The first book is "I'd tell you I love you, but then I'd have to kill you".<br>  <br>  The two books I actually enjoyed reading in school were Speak and Holes. Speak is a really good book.<br>  <br>  A few other books I have read recently and enjoyed are: Kissing Kate, The Bermudez Triangle, and Empress of the World.<br>  <br>  Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice.<br>  <br>  Some series that others have told me to read that are in the Young Adult/ Supernatural genre are: The Mortal Instruments series, Darkest Powers series,  Maxium Ride, Vampire Kisses series, The Vampire Diaries, The Uglies series, Chronicles of Narnia, Blue Bloods, Sookie Stackhouse series, and Sweep series.<br>  <br>  <br>  Then these more classical books: anything Jane Austen, To Kill a Mockingbird, Wuthering Heights, Great Expectations, Jane Eyre, Little Women, Odyssey, The Scarlet Letter, and Treasure Island. All of those are part of Barnes and Nobles Classic Collection.<br>  <br>  Any of these books listed can be found on Barnes and Noble to know what they are about.|`|AA10287019	The Blue Blood series by Melissa de la Cruz<br>  that's in that genre.

eGcu5cN4aa	It all has to do with your breathing. You must support your voice from your diaphragm.<br>  When you breath incorrectly, your lungs will only fill up a little bit, and you won't have any support. An obvious indication that you are breathing wrong is t your shoulders raising. <br>  <br>  Feel where your rib cage connects. Under the breast bone. It is about 8 inches above the belly button.  About one inch below where the rib cage connects is the diaphragm. focus on breathing 'low' and try to move your diaphragm. You can feel it move. <br>  Just continue working on breathing low and breathing with your diaphragm with a lot of support and you will be projecting like crazy!!!<br>  <br>  Best of luck!!|`|encz34GYaa	with your eyes closed, imagine that you see your voice physically. its waves and strength coming out of your mouth. before you start singing, imagine that you see through the walls and you see the farthest building from where you're standing. with eyes still closed, start to sing 'seeing' your voice coming out of your mouth and what you want is to let your voice reach THAT building. don't shout, you want the people from that building to hear your beautiful voice as if you're singing to them nearby. :)<br>  <br>  goodluck!

DAsQ4UZ8aa	As a writer of non fiction my first advice is to check your grammar before you 'put it out there'.  Also, you only need to 'paint the mental picture' once and then make subsequent referals to it in the form of euphimism or a single noun when dealing with a physical object.  When dealing with a landscape you can add words to your dialogue as the story progress' for scene development.  This too can be used in character development.  Best of luck to you.|`|VtUPI9Lgaa	........<br>  i am sorry, i didn't like it. <br>  <br>  It was boring (to me) and i got tired of hearing all of the Naoki's in there. <br>  <br>  No offense but it seems like your character is a better writer than what you have done. Try basing what you have written about Stephanie|`|8QKgkOZfaa	Okay, the first best thing you can do is to use pronouns (she, them, her, it, etc) instead of Naoki every time you refer to her.<br>  <br>  commas represent pauses just as well as '...'s do.

Keep going!|`|CnM2U1bXaa	idk, its all right. keep working on it and it will b great|`|Wxe9fDk9aa	Well first, you have to put a comma after by in the second sentence, so it's like ( by, hiding.... ) then go to your fifth sentence depicting this terrible monster because if it's going to be a scary story the creature should get the star treatment. Then write how it approaches her in vivid detail while she's paralyzed with fear and can't move and there's brown smelly, sticky goop dripping from the creatures mouth that is staring at her with yellow, bloodshot eyes and so on.<br>  I wouldn't say it's a book yet. It's just a paragraph.|`|daza5A4vaa	I had trouble getting through it.<br>  Probably because you say "Naoki" like.. 9987 times.<br>  Edit, and come back (:<br>  I'd be glad to give it a second look.|`|93CMl5tcaa	Naoki this..Naoki that...your sentences are very boring and poorly writen.

AA12343309	Your public library and a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. The FHCs have records on people all over the world,not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.<br>  <br>  I have never had them to try and convert me nor have I heard of them doing that to anyone else that has used their resources.<br>  <br>  First start with your living family. Talk to the senior members and tape them. What might seem to be insignificant story telling and ramblings you wouldn't write down might later turn out to be very significant. However, I am not saying they won't be wrong on some things.<br>  <br>  Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.  Find out if any members of your family has any old family bibles.<br>  <br>  On websites, be very very cautious about information in family trees, free or fee. They are subscriber submitted, usually not documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You will frequently see different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers, but that doesn't mean it is accurate. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information is useful only as clues as to where to get the documentation.<br>  <br>  If you disagree with something another subscriber has on your family, the website owners will tell you that is between you and the other subscriber.<br>  <br>  I like Ancestry.Com for its records/documents.<br>  Documentation is the meat of genealogy.

I think The Earth, My Butt & Other Big Round Things is better though.<br>  Also Louise Rennison is absolutely hilarious.|`|pVdV4gwgaa	You can try <br>  Angus, Thongs, And Full Frontal Snogging: Confessions of Georgia Nicolson.

HORACAnlaa	It needs a really good editor to clean up the grammatical errors. Right now, it's a tough slog reading this story. The flow is very uneven as one reads it. Study grammar more, because you need to improve in that department if you wish to write.<br>  <br>  On a creative level it's not bad. The nihilist impression of the man still shines through; regardless of all the maimed English. But it is not as deep as you suggest in your introduction. Spare the adjectives, focus on good grammar, and master complete sentences so the wonder of your creativity can be enjoyed by all.|`|FoIxsunVaa	the reason I am a bad writer is because I am a bad reader. Here are my thoughts as I read what you wrote. I'll skip the philosophy paragraph which i find primitive, as literature.<br>  <br>  “How long has it been”…………..<br>  The ray of light penetrating the curtain into the dark and foreboding <br>  (I am past the number of cliched adjectives and subjects that I can hold in my head, so I hear buzzzz-a bunch of meaningless details-buzzzz.)<br>  room lying down onto the soft cover warming it small piece of land. <br>  (it small piece of land, try that in English?)<br>  Sound penetrating the stone walls, into his mind, deep into the depths oh his conscience. (zzzzzzz) He tries to move his hand, to lift his head, to even remember his own name. Slowly the covers rise, first a finger, then the hand. <br>  (are we going to describe EVERY part of his body moving when one finger describes it all? I am sooooo lost.)<br>  Eyes open slowly and then shut, afraid of the light. Slowly they reopen making friends with the light, letting it inside their depths. He rises, why is he here? <br>  (I was wondering the same question. I have suspended my need to have a REASON TO KEEP READING for half of an overlong paragraph.)<br>  The question on his mind. Slowly he walks over. Arms grabbing ahead, fingers wrapping around the handle. <br>  (more fingers and toes? What is this anatomy class?)<br>  Coffee? No. Walking back, away, to his stainless white sheets, <br>  (HE IS HOME??? BUT WHERE AM I? WHAT AM I DOING HERE. You just shot me to death of stupidity.)<br>  away from all the people running circles, away from the mad world , covering his head, he fades away , into his dreams.<br>  (that was murder, I am NOT signing up for another tour of English free finger moving that changes from 'some mystery place" to "home" in mid-sentence!)<br>  <br>  I realized as I was editing my comments that you never said he wasn't home. But everything was so VAGUE, except for the finger wagging, that I assumed he was some mystery place. He didn't wake up looking at the same ceiling fixture he sees every morning above his bed. You have accomplished too much detail and NOT ENOUGH at the SAME TIME.<br>  <br>  I couldn't waste any more of my night on this, sorry.

k2Jbp9e6aa	Your assignment astounds me.  It is difficult enough to become either an actor or a  singer without being a writer as well. There are monologues a-plenty, and you can find them in any theatrical bookstore. There are showtunes a-plenty and you can find them in any serious music store. <br>  But in musical theatre, the show-stopper songs come out of tit-for-tat dialogue. In musical theater, monologues are sung - not spoken.<br>  In short, the only idea I have is to kick your teacher back into the back row of the chorus.|`|TVrJXH3uaa	I'm doing the same thing!<br>  you should do like a mix of a fairy tale!<br>  like maybe the wolf's side, or like rapunzel having such silky hair, the prince falls off and she falls for the paramedic, and he doesn't like girls with long hair? or along those lines Mine is about glitter? it's so random, like how in the world does that little glitter, get on you, and you don't know how, and im just thinking of ideas, My teacher loves random pointless stuff...he is making someone write on cheese. and salad dressing, and the first emotion they felt when they heard their first song! well hope that helped, i know so people like being the mirror of snow white, and what they really think, someone meeting her biological father, and one who's obsessed with ice cream..but theres no more ice cream!

ripvOi5jaa	Try writing about your characters as people first and see what time period you think they fit in first. When I write a story I like to make a list of their likes and dislikes things they do etc...<br>  <br>  Or you can try starting a little in each period and see what works best. If you choose historical be sure to do plenty of research about that time so it can feel real.<br>  Either way I'd love to read it. I'm a big fan of interracial romance.<br>  <br>  (Will you post it online? I have an account on fictionpress.com so if you post it there send a link to Crescent City Chick)|`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	I'm thinking it's pretty unrealistic that an American musician would be traveling in Mussolini's Italy. A modern, non-wartime setting would be much more realistic.<br>  <br>  I think it's a very good idea for a story. It's reminiscent of Brokeback Mountain, in that it's about a long distance relationship dying off.
FTRKOr9Kaa	Ambos personajes son orgullosos y prejuiciosos. El orgullo herido de Lizzy la llevó a prejuzgar a Darcy luego de que lo escuchó decir lo que dijo de ella; el excesivo orgullo de éste, el creerse superior a todos, a su vez también hizo que prejuzgase a todos (la sociedad de Meryton en general y los Bennet en particular y los Gardiner y la misma Lizzy son la prueba viviente de lo equivocado que estuvo), ambos tenían que regular sus respectivos orgullos y reconocer sus errores de juicio.|`|175a76c9e371848e51e6eaff5764f33baa	El orgulloso era Mr. Darcy, la prejuiciosa era Elizabeth Bennet... pero se cambian los papeles muchas veces osea la orgullosa era ella y el prejuicioso era el...<br>  <br>  es un muy buen libro, a mi me gusto....<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|Zo8meTSqaa	Ambos eran orgullosos y ambos tenían prejuicios hacia el otro.|`|ebddc7d7e4bc8d5ecedf058200feb746aa	Se supone que el orgullo proviene de Mr. Darcy que refleja todo el nivel aristocrático y de riqueza de su ambiente social y familiar.

qId4daV9aa	I love modern too. I am currently a senior at a performing arts H.S. and take modern classes everyday. Our main syllabus has been Martha Graham, which has a definite technique to it like ballet. It is not easy to do correctly! This passed year, we have had guest teachers in modern for every month, so I have been lucky enough to be exposed to lots of different styles of modern. I have been able to study with Nathan Trice and Milton Meyers to name a few. I have done the Paul Taylor SI in NY as well as the Ailey. This week I have my college audition for NYU Tisch dance followed by my Juilliard audition. I am hoping to dance in a Modern Contemporary company upon graduation from college.<br>  In terms of pointers for modern, keep up with your ballet. You need not do pointe. Strong ballet is an essential for strong modern dance.<br>  I find modern so much more expressive then ballet to dance and I love the fact that I rarely have to wear my pointe shoes anymore!|`|aYVVwjBXaa	you'll appreciate this then.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW3gKKiTvjs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW3gKKiTv...</a>|`|5b98026588656ab5d04922888ecc617aaa	I think that it would be cool to make a dance, if you have enough technique.

omFDjExkaa	Los códices constituyen una especie de memoranda, escritos por sacerdotes, destinados a la meditación y que sólo los propios sacerdotes eran capaces de descifrar. No eran libros para todos, constituían una especie de manual para uso exclusivo del sacerdote, de quien se exigía que mediante la interpretación de los signos figurativos supiera dar instrucción y directrices en todas las decisivas cuestiones de la vida, tanto las religiosas como las políticas y sociales.Cuarenta códices indígenas de los más importantes se encuentran en el extranjero: quince en París, cuatro en Madrid, seis en la biblioteca Bodleiana de la universidad de Oxford, cuatro en el Vaticano, dos en Florencia; y las bibliotecas públicas de Liverpool, Dresde, Bolonia, Nueva York, Berlín, Nueva Orleans y Basilea poseen uno cada una.En cuanto el contenido temático, se ha agrupado según el tema más importante de cada manuscrito, porque casi siempre abordan varios: 1. Calendáricos - rituales (almanaques y ruedas), 2. históricos, 3. genealógicos, 4. cartográficos (lienzos, mapas y planos), 5. económicos (catastros, censos, registros financieros, planos de propiedades, tributos), 6. etnográficos, 7. misceláneos, de litigios, de historia natural, 8. catecismos indígenas y 9. Techialoyan. Ahora bien , todo esto ya lo has de conocer, pero lo màs importante es revalcar que todos y cada uno de los Còdices tienen un gran valor, aunque cada uno es distinto , podrìa atreverme a decirque el recien digitalizado Còdice Colombino, guardado en el Museo Nacional de Antropologìa e Historia es de los màs interesantes por su entiguedad y contenido, ademàs es el unico Còdice Prehispànico que se guarda  en Mèxico.

Si te gustan las novelas rosas bien podrás leer Hija de la Fortuna -en caso que te guste demasiado posteriormente deberàs leer Retrato en Sepia- ambas de Isabel Allende. Si quieres algo de terror social puedes leer De amor y de Sombra o la Casa de los Espíritus igualmente de Allende. Si deseasun estilo más nacionalista (en el caso que seas mexicana, claro) erótico y fuerte bien leerás Gringo Viejo de Fuentes. Aura del escritor mencionado anteriormente tiene un fondo más enfocado en el alma. Si quieres un estilo oscuro sin duda te recomiendo Sobre Héroes y Tumbas de Ernesto Sábato o bien El Túnel, su más conocida novela. Otra novela rosa -entiéndase de amor- es Como Agua para Chocolate de Laura Esquivel, esta te la recomiendo ampliamente. Si te gusta la aventura y quieres una lectura muy rápida y sencilla lee la trilogía "Memorias del águila y el Jaguar" (conformada por La Ciudad de las Bestias, El Reino del Dragón de Oro y el Bosque de los Pigmeos) de Isabel Allende. Si te gusta la novela policíaca sin duda disfrutarás cualquier libro de Dan Brown: El Código Da Vinci, ángeles y Demonios, La Conspiración y La fortaleza Digital. Si crees en la reencarnación no puedes dejar de leer a Brian Weiss con Muchas Vidas, Muchos Maestros... y Los Mensajes de los Sabios. Aunque tu pregunta se centra en lo literario déjame te digo que si piensas leer Harry Potter o Ca?itas, no te servirá y el sabor de boca no te será muy grato. Obras puramente literarias son:<br>  *Fuente Ovejuna-Lope de Vega<br>  *El caballero de Olmedo-Lope de Vega<br>  *Niebla (puramente existencialista) -Miguel de Unamuno<br>  *El Zarco (la tendencia es el trance del Romanticismo al Realismo)- Ignacio Manuel Altamirano.<br>  Agatha Christie también es buenísima, su estilo es policiaco y creeme que no podrás de dejar de leer. Espero que te haya servido mi respuesta. <br>  *Bodas de Sangre-Federico García Lorca|`|Sezp07kdaa	"Orgullo y Prejuicio" de Jane Austen. Si te gustan las novelas románicas éste libro es para ti.

The House of Sleep.

Lo spiazzamento e l'ironia come critica al mondo dell'arte... già ma poi se dico così si dovrebbe parlare di cosa è fare arte oggi e se baudrillard aveva ragione ad dire che l'arte è morta trent'anni fa.. ecc ecc e il discorso diventa troppo ampio...

Es realmente inmoral.|`|NGnZ6Tc6aa	Estoy de acuerdo contigo, es una verdadera lastima que la gente se deje enga?ar por una persona pseudoartista para hacer cosas pseudoartisticas, tal vez las personas que fueron son personas que necesitan elevar su autoestima y piensan que ense?ando sus miserias lo van a lograr, ademas qué gana el verdadero arte con esto? solo confundir a los mediocres.|`|XRBvg7Zbaa	La obra de arte no es la fotografía, si no todo el momento. El arte tradicional esta restringido a dos dimensiones y a un espacio reducido, pocas veces hay movimiento en él, a demás de ser percibido a lo más por dos sentidos.<br>  La pintura 2 dimensiones estático, visual<br>  La escultura 3 dimensiones estatíco, visual, pocas veces tacto.<br>  E cine 2 dimensiones, estatico, básicamente visual.<br>  Lo anterior es solo como ejemplo.<br>  Las insalaciones artisticas, como la obra de Tunick pueden sobrepasar por mucho la cuestión espacial y sensitiva. Eso es ya un gran aporte para el arte.<br>  Como participante en una instalación de Stunick, ves, escuchas, tocas, hueles, es en tres dimensiones, hay moviemiento y el espacio es poco restringido.<br>  Recuerda que quizás el primer propósito de arte es "hacer sentir emociones", y la obra de stunick cumple con ese requisito ya que algunos nos gusta a otros no, unos se alegran otros se indignan unos lo alienta otros se ofenden. ?te das cuenta? con todo eso ya esta causando senseciones y emociones. Eso es arte.<br>  Es una falacia pensar que el arte siempre tiene que ser bonito o agradble. Absolutamente todas las obr de arte han sido aceptadas por unos y rechazadas por otros, eso es algo normal y deseable en el arte.<br>  Otro objetivo del arte es la comunicación. El arte es por definición comunicación. Vaya que si hubo comunicación el domingo, desde los amigos que se ponian de acuerdo para asisitir, las platicas de café debatiendo sobre el tema, los novios o parejas que planeaban ir juntos, los medios de comunicación, la gente que se conocío en la fila o en el zocalo, los blogs, las paginas de nternet. HUbo muchisima comunicación, se estacumpliendo el sentido del arte<br>  La obra de Tunick NO ES LA FOTOGRAFíA en si, la obra de arte no son las fotos, es todo, desde el efecto causado en la sociedad, la luz, la alegría y motivacón en la gente, la drenalina, etc. Por ello se le llama instalación que además es un tipo de arte efimero<br>  En definitiva SI ES ARTE|`|sYiu7F6raa	FELICIDADES A AQUELLOS QUE ENCONTRARON LO QUE BUSCABAN Y MAL POR QUIENES SE ARREPIENTEN DE LO QUE YA HICIERON, LAS APRECIACIONES DEL ARTE VARIAN TANTO....

Respeto tu punto de vista. Al parecer el arte es una expresión que tiene la humanidad ..comunica  la universalidad del hombre...y al parecer hasta el momento, ha sido algo valiosísimo que ha sobrevivido el pasado  y que además nos muestra como comprender a la historia. Con el tiempo...muchos artistas fueron famosos después de su muerte..como Vincent Van Vangoh....o Leonardo  da Vinci....   En relación al zócalo yo también cuestioné éso y llegue a la conclusión de que el permiso es en el Distrito Federal (Donde esta Marcelo Ebrard) Hago memoria y hace 6  a?os Tunic...quizó venir, pero no se lopermitió el gobierno..al parecer y si no estoy mal el PAN  y mucho antes el PRI..(Acepto correcciones)  siento que en ése momento el gobierno se encontraba mucho más inmerso en su moralidad conservadora (PAN). Hay que ver que cosas han cambiado  de ése tiempo a éste momento, Una de éllas y bastante fuerte es la despenalización al aborto (Durante las primeras 12 semanas) ...situación que los ULTRA CONSERVADORES...ni tocaban o se armaban las ri?as..recuerda el caso de la peque?a que fue violada a los 12 a?os y el gobierno panista , junto con un sacerdote de localidad ...influyeron para que la peque?a no interrumpiera su embarazo ...?y QUE PASO ENTONCES?....SOBRE EL TRANSPORTE...participaran mayores de edad..creo que son personas constructivas laboralmente...cuentan con MONEY, además no todo se transportan en burro, también han de tener ..su... DOCH ..o aúnque...VW. sin mencionar a los excentricos que acudan ya sabes...siempre hay un Facundo....u otras personas igual de respetables como la Zavaleta....etc. Sobre las fotos...si entiendo será masiva pero no en pornografía. (QUIZáS) me perdere en la inmensidad.. y .. aúnque no gane dinero no deseo ser  balconeada como Pamela Anderson, u otras más...ya que ni tengo su cuerpo y ni ganaría dinero, mostrando mi puerquesito...No definitivamente, por el momento no me inquieta una fama por mantener mi cuerpo a juicio y morbosidad de seres que utilizan una fantasía. Sin embargo en el ser humano existe el libre albedrío, otoirgado con la experiencia, y que no siempre depende de la edad, que tenemos, sino en el momento en que la ponemos en práctica......En relación a la pulmonía ... la verdad, la verdad...lo pienso..′..pero me atrevo.. es mi gusto y, .ya te platicare, si lo aceptas, por su puesto... si me enferme puede ser ya que soy muy delicadita...... Oye te recomiendo leas la sección de Armando Ramírez en UN DIARIO  de módico precio  y de accesibilidad a todos...quizás te agraden sus críticas....  NOTA.. mejorare mi RDCON.

Sus habitantes se conocen como "porte?os". <br>  <br>  Buenos Aires, con sus 47 barrios, es la novena ciudad más poblada del mundo y una de las ciudades más europeas de Latinoamérica. De hecho, se la conoce como "el París de Sudamérica" por sus edificios afrancesados, su gran número de plazas, fuentes y esculturas, y su amplia oferta cultural, una de las más importantes del Cono Sur y del mundo. Se trata de una ciudad muy cosmopolita y multicultural, gracias a su población mayoritariamente emigrante. <br>  <br>  Las calles de Buenos Aires están llenas de ambiente tanto de día como de noche. Los locales nocturnos permanecen abiertos hasta el amanecer, así como algunas tiendas de discos, librerías y kioscos de revistas. Destacan sus teatros por la variedad y calidad de sus espectáculos, de fama mundial. <br>  <br>  Buenos Aires es una ciudad muy agradable y entretenida, sin duda una de las urbes más atractivas de Latinoamérica, cualidades que mantiene pese a la crisis económica que devastó el país hace unos a?os. <br>  <br>  Mapa de Buenos Aires <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  CóRDOBA<br>  <br>  Capital de la provincia de Córdoba, esta ciudad nació con el objetivo de vincular el Alto Perú con el Río de la Plata por medio de lo que se conoció como el Camino Real. Hoy en día, con un millón y medio de habitantes, es la segunda urbe más importante de la República Argentina y la principal de la zona central del país. Es además un gran centro industrial cuyas principales fuentes de riqueza son la minería, la agricultura y la ganadería. <br>  <br>  En Córdoba conviven la tradición propia de la época colonial con las construcciones más modernas y actuales. Los bellos edificios de los siglos XVII y XVIII pueblan calles peatonales y acogedoras, en las que el visitante también encuentra abundantes galerías comerciales, tiendas y locales. <br>  <br>  Destacan su arquitectura, sus museos, su vida nocturna, y sus abundantes salas de espectáculos. Quienes la visitan quedan fascinados por su centro histórico, la hermosa área peatonal, la Basílica de Santo Domingo, la Iglesia Catedral y el Barrio Nueva Córdoba. Hay recorridos peatonales que enlazan la plaza San Martín, la Catedral, el Cabildo Histórico y la Manzana de las Luces con la iglesia de la Compa?ía de Jesús, la Casa de Trejo, el Colegio Nacional Monserrat y el Museo Fray José Antonio de San Alberto. Otros lugares que vale la pena conocer son el Parque Sarmiento (dise?ado a finales del siglo pasado por el arquitecto francés Charles Thays), la Casa del Virrey Sobremonte , la Capilla de San Roque y el Teatro del Libertador. <br>  <br>  Fundada por el hidalgo espa?ol Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera en el siglo XVI, en sus orígenes se la bautizó como Córdoba de la Nueva Andalucía. En 1614 los Jesuitas fundaron en ella la Universidad Nacional, la segunda creada en Hispanoamérica, y lugar de formación, a lo largo de los siglos, de numerosas personalidades de la cultura y la vida política del país, razón por la cual se empezó a conocer a Córboba como "la docta". Desde entonces esta metrópolis constituye el segundo núcleo universitario del país después de Buenos Aires. La belleza de sus calles, su importante vida cultural, su ambiente estudiantil y el prestigio de su oferta educativa atraen cada a?o a miles de estudiantes argentinos y del resto del mundo.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  LA PLATA<br>  <br>  La ciudad de La Plata constituye un importante centro administrativo, comercial, educativo, recreativo y cultural de Argentina. Situada a 56 Km al sudeste de la Capital Federal, a 9,87 metros de altura respecto al nivel del mar, sus 940,38 km2 de superficie albergan a más de medio millón de habitantes (densidad poblacional: 585 hab/km2). <br>  <br>  Surgió de la voluntad de los argentinos de engrandecer su país tras la reorganización institucional del país en 1880 y la proclamación de su Constitución Nacional. Se eligió un paraje llamado Lomas de Ensenada de Barragán, que estaba a una distancia adecuada de Buenos Aires, tenía una situación geográfica que facilitaría el comercio, y una topografía idónea para asentar la ciudad y sus sucesivas ampliaciones, junto con las facilidades climáticas y ambientales de la zona para crear una nueva comunidad. <br>  <br>  El 19 de noviembre de 1882 se colocó la primera piedra de lo que hoy es La Plata, concretamente su Plaza Moreno. A?o y medio después de su fundación, la población ascendía a 6.846 habitantes, de los cuales el 49% era de origen italiano y sólo el 28,6 % argentinos. Los primeros moradores eran empleados en la construcción de la urbe. Luego fueron ampliándose los sectores profesionales. <br>  <br>  La ciudad de La Plata fue una de las primeras ciudades del mundo con un plan urbanístico previo a su construcción que también incluía actividades y vías de comunicación. Su trazado se puede sintetizar en una trama en damero, a la cual se superpone una trama de diagonales. Este sistema rígido de calles amplias y arboladas, con una trama de diagonales que permiten un rápido desplazamiento y el acortamiento de distancias, se complementa con plazas, parques y boulevares, destacando el papel que desempe?an las zonas verdes y los jardines. En el mes de octubre de 1998, la UNESCO incluyó a La Plata en una lista tentativa entre otros cuatro lugares argentinos que asp a alcanzar la designación como Patrimonio de la Humanidad. La candidatura de esta ciudad se fundaba en su original trazado urbanístico, único en el mundo, no en sus construcciones tradicionales, más comunes a las de otras ciudades. <br>  <br>  La Plata es sede de la reputada Universidad Nacional de La Plata. Es una ciudad principalmente universitaria, con mucho ambiente, que cuenta además con un centro de gran belleza con edificios fundacionales (la Casa de Gobierno, el Palacio de la Legislatura, el Palacio Municipal) de hermosa arquitectura, numerosas plazas, avenidas y paseos. Tiene además un museo de Ciencias Naturales de reconocido prestigio en Paleontología, y un casco urbano cuajado de parques, distribuidos cada seis cuadras, al igual que las plazas, así como numerosas zonas verdes (Parque Martín Rodríguez, Parque Municipal, Parque Pereyra Iraola, o el Parque Ecológico Municipal).|`|UqfvvUpcaa	La ciudad mas importante y capital de Argentina es Buenos Aires|`|yXsaiGUeaa	Las tres ciudades principales de Argentina son las siguientes 3:<br>  Rosario: surge a mediados del siglo XVIII, sin fundación oficial<br>  Buenos Aires: 1ra fundación 1536, 2da fundacion 1580<br>  Córdoba: fundada en 1573
JHUkmvoLaa	ZEEV (VLADIMIR) JABOTINSKY<br>  1880-1940<br>  <br>  Zeev (Vladimir) Jabotinsky nació el 18 de octubre de 1880, en la ciudad rusa de Odessa. A los 18 a?os estudio en Italia y Suiza y sirvió como corresponsal para varios periódicos rusos. Pronto por sus informes y artículos se le reconoció como uno de los máximos exponentes del periodismo ruso. Firmo todos sus informes y artículos con su seudónimo literario "Altalena." El pogrom contra los judíos de Kishinev en 1903 estimuló a Jabotinsky para emprender la actividad sionista. él organizó las unidades de autodefensa y luchó por los derechos de la minoría judía en Rusia. Jabotinsky fue elegido como delegado al VI Congreso Sionista, el último en que Teodoro Herzl estuvo en activo.  Durante la I Guerra Mundial trabajo como corresponsal de guerra. Trabajó para la fundación de la Legión Judía. En 1920, Jabotinsky dirigió la Haganah en Jerusalén contra los alborotos árabes y fue condenado por los británicos a 15 a?os de trabajos forzados. A consecuencia de la presión publica contra el veredicto, recibió la amnistía y fue liberado de la prisión de Acre. Después de 1921 Jabotinsky era miembro del Ejecutivo Sionista y uno de los fundadores de "Keren Hayesod." Después de una serie de discordancias con la dirección del Movimiento Sionista, él se separó y, en 1925, estableció la Unión de Sionistas Revisionistas (Hatzohar) qué requirió el establecimiento inmediato de un Estado judío. En 1923 Jabotinsky estaba a la cabeza del movimiento juvenil Betar de espíritu nacionalista. Durante los a?os 1928-1929, residió en Palestina y revisó el diario hebreo Doar Hayom, mientras, al mismo tiempo, emprendió una aumentada actividad política. En 1929, abandono Palestina en una gira de conferencias después de que la administración británica le negara la entrada en el país. Desde entonces vivió en el exilio hasta su muerte. <br>  En 1935, después de que el Movimiento Sionista rechazara su programa político y se negara a definir claramente que "el objetivo de Sionismo era el establecimiento de un estado judío," Jabotinsky decidió abandonar del Movimiento Sionista. Jabotinsky fundó la Nueva Organización Sionista (N.Z.O) para dirigir la actividad política independiente para la inmigración libre y el establecimiento de un Estado judío. <br>  En 1937, el Irgun Tzvai Leumi se volvió el brazo militar del movimiento de Jabotinsky y él su comandante. Los tres cuerpos encabezados por Jabotinsky, la Nueva Organización Sionista (N.Z.O), el Betar movimiento juvenil y el Irgun Tzvai Leumi (I.Z.L) era tres extensiones del mismo movimiento. La Nueva Organización Sionista era el brazo político que mantuvo los contactos con los gobiernos y otros factores políticos, Betar educó la juventud de la Diáspora para la liberación y construcción de Eretz Israel y el Irgun Tzvai Leumi (I.Z.L) era el brazo militar que luchó contra los enemigos de la empresa Sionista. <br>  A lo largo de este periodo de intensa actividad política, Jabotinsky continuó escribiendo poesía, novelas, historias cortas y artículos. Jabotinsky tradujo en hebreo algunos de los clásicos mas conocidos de la literatura mundial. <br>  Durante 1939 --1940, Jabotinsky desarrollo actividades en Gran Breta?a y los Estados Unidos con la esperanza de establecer un ejército judío para luchar lado a lado con los aliados contra la Alemania Nazi. <br>  El 4 de agosto de 1940, mientras visitaba a los miembros de Betar en Nueva York, sufrió un ataque al corazón y murió. En su testamento pidió que solamente fuera enterrado en Eretz Israel por orden expresa del Gobierno hebreo del futuro Estado judío. Su testamento se cumplió por Levi Eshkol, primer ministro de Israel en 1964, los restos de Jabotinsky y los de su esposa Jeanne eran enterrados en el monte Herzl en Jerusalén.|`|FgqRXcELaa	ZEEV (VLADIMIR) JABOTINSKY<br>  1880-1940<br>  <br>  Zeev (Vladimir) Jabotinsky nació el 18 de octubre de 1880, en la ciudad rusa de Odessa.

AA10404097	Heaven’s Net is Wide is one of two companion novels to Lian Hearn's popular Tales of the Otori trilogy (the other sequel being The Harsh Cry of the Heron) currently scheduled to be released in September, 2007[1].<br>  <br>  The novel is a prequel, set before The Tales of The Otori and recounts the life of Lord Shigeru from the age of 12 (the year in which Takeo is born). It is set to include Shigeru's training with Matsuda Shingen, the battle of Yaegahara, the role of Muto Shizuka, the meeting with Lady Maruyama and other events foreshadowing Across the Nightingale Floor.|`|cecb8b383242fb859e0c3d1393509369aa	The first in the trilogy is  Across  the Nightengale Floor; Tales of the Otori.  Next is  Grass for His Pillow and last is Brilliance for the Moon.|`|AA10242125	HEARN, LIAN; pseudonym of Gillian Rubenstein<br>  Will there be anymore books in the Tales of the Otori series after Brilliance of the Moon?<br>   I am writing two more: a sort of prequel which tells the life of Shigeru from age 12 until his rescue of Takeo in Mino and a final one which takes place 14 years after the end of Brilliance of the Moon. I wrote all the first three books out by hand before I typed up Across the Nightingale Floor, and I am doing the same with these two, as the stories have to echo each other. When I have finished the second one (I am about a quarter of the way into it), I will decide if I want to let other people read them, if they are going to add to the trilogy or if they will diminish it. It's hard to tell at this stage.<br>  <br>  .....<br>  The Barnes & Noble Review<br>  The Harsh Cry of the Heron -- the much-anticipated conclusion to the bestselling Tales of the Otori saga (Across the Nightingale Floor, Grass for His Pillow, and Brilliance of the Moon) -- brings to a close Lian Hearn's epic fantasy chronicle of a feudal Japan replete with murder, myth, martial arts, and magic. <br>  <br>  Sixteen years after the events of Brilliance of the Moon, Otori Takeo is sovereign ruler of the Three Countries, and the realm is finally experiencing peace and prosperity. Takeo and his wife, Kaede, have three beautiful daughters -- Shigeko and her younger twin sisters, Maya and Miki -- and Takeo is preparing his heir, Shigeko, for her eventual ascendancy. But threats abound as Takeo struggles to keep the Three Countries at peace: The Emperor is asking for his abdication, assassins are targeting his family, and a holy woman's mysterious prophecy involving Takeo's death from long ago might finally come to fruition.
AA10517241	Patronage is the concept of repaying friends or supporters for the help they gave in support of a candidate or cause.  This is the reason the civil service commission was created-to try to eliminate this practice.<br>  <br>  In theory this is a good idea but in practice, the upper levels of government still practice patronage and the result is that the best qualified to fill a position are not always put into it.  That is also why the uppper-middle level staffers are the ones who really know what needs to be done and how to get it accomplished|`|2ARgi1rdaa	The concept is the same as you scratch my back I'll scratch yours.

Seriously.|`|KHVvDMLYaa	oh my god yes. he looks way better cleanly shaven and stuff<br>  he has to be cleaned up rather than look like a hobo<br>  he looks way hotter in twilight cuz he got cleaned up and for once washed his hair|`|C2FkuVESaa	I think he could be moderately attractive if cleaned up and made to shave. I've seen so many mag covers with him stubbly and he looks like the homeless-arcade-stalker your mom told you not to talk to.<br>  <br>  So shall we buy Pattz a pair of tweezers? It's too bad we can't buy Steph Meyer any talent.|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	YES!

It was a war, so some people had to die. That's pretty much as "realistic" as you can get in an alternate universe with wizards..|`|Dsmwrvziaa	I read in an interview that she had not intended to kill either Tonks or Remus, but she decided to so that it would make up for keeping Arthur Weasley alive in OotP. It's really just to keep it realistic and such. I mean, what's a war if no one on the good side dies?|`|URmvBQSQaa	I think to make it more realistic and believable( the greatest books contain tragedy)<br>  Also. she wanted to make Harry the hero He couldn't really be that  Great a Hero if there were so many survivors.|`|z9YZiySmaa	i think that JKR killed off so many people so that we are notleft with as many questions as we would be. it also adds drama and thickens the plot.|`|EQdJgYQiaa	Sadly, it's more realistic that way.|`|frtgHgcWaa	I know...<br>  It was a war it had 2 be tragic.<br>  It was wicked sad|`|vDGFRACaaa	A: Last book, no reason not to. (A lot of series finales on TV tend to kill at least 1 character. Since there's only 7 or 8 main characters and HP has hundreds of characters, I guess the number gets multiplied.)<br>  <br>  B: To teach children about the brutality of war. (The best way to teach people about violence is to write about it, so they reader will be less likely to do it themselves.)<br>  <br>  C: It was kind-of building up with more and more significant deaths. In the 4th book they killed a random nobody, in the fifth they killed Harry's uncle, in the sixth they killed Harry's mentor. I was surprised she didn't kill Ron or Hermione, actually.|`|x08oohwpaa	The book focused on the battle between good and evil and climaxed with war.  People die in wars.  I think she wanted a realistic story, it would be silly to write about evil and not have any  characters permanently affected.

a35836f62ee5723d1327045b66a7200baa	Now from a historian:<br>  <br>  In order for a group of people to be considered a civilization historically they must meet the following requirements:<br>  <br>  1.  They must have built permanent structures and lived there.<br>  2.  They must have established military protection and maintained an army<br>  3.  They must have planted crops and raised animals<br>  4.  They must have demonstrated some sort of organizational government<br>  5.  Some sort of written language and established means of communicating.<br>  <br>  That is why the American Indians are NOT considered a civilization to historians.  They only met a couple of these requirements.  However the Aztecs, Mayas, and Incas or Central and South America ARE considered civilizations.  So too were the Chinese dynasties, the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, etc...<br>  <br>  <br>  And there you have it from an historical point of view.|`|AA10041812	It's a good question that is still being debated among historians. However, writing was a very key development, as was living in cities.<br>  This necessitated a division of labor so that specialists like priests and scribes could work without having to worry about harvesting crops for themselves. No civilization is self-sufficient, so another key development was foreign trade (and with it a business economy).|`|f2bcf2a9827601be23d7b70f58184edaaa	the need, and want, to not operate alone, early on humans and even sub humans understood that they did better in groups than they did alone..|`|a242fb73384a22e07ad6be60f7ca1d83aa	The be considered a civilization, the one thing every group needed to have was a written language/literacy. Usually written language came in the form of receipts for trade and inventory. There were also things like centralized government and city structures that all people needed. Permanent settlements and agriculture were considered a must because hunter/gatherer groups weren't considered a civilization because they moved around all the time. The one thing they needed though was literacy (usually the ruler of the civilization and the religious leaders were the ones to use writing for things other than receipts and inventory).|`|mW1GSBUraa	permanent residence. no more moving clans. implicatios of a city<br>  written language<br>  agriculture subsistance<br>  some form of government, ie a set of rules to follow/ a leader of somesort.

It does not say white anglo saxon European men.<br>  <br>  The fact is that slavery was NOT an issue that was side-stepped by the founding fathers.   It was a major topic of debate and issue during the 1787-89 period when the Constitution was created.  (For all you history illiterates, read James Madison's detailed records and transcripts of each day of the convention).<br>  <br>  The Northerners very specifically pushed to legislate against continued slave trade AND to stop additional slave states from entering the new country.   To get the southern states to accept the new constitution, there was a compromise made not to create any laws abolishing slavery for 20 years after the time the constitution was enacted.<br>  <br>  Also, indentured servants were literally enslaved during this same colonial period albeit for finite periods of time (5-15 years).<br>  <br>  Be aware that there are many elementary and high school history teachers who are unqualified to teach you true American history.

SygvUa0Eaa	Not as long as you don't add the same plot, and characters, and don't base it on the movie, because you need permission to do that- and I highly doubt you'll get it.    However, I don't think it would be a good idea anyway. I mean, technically you're not copying the movie, but you are pretty much taking away the idea. People don't like this, and it'll hurt your book, with pretty bad reviews too.|`|GqrRBZ3faa	If Vanilla Ice can get away with copying Queen by changing one note, you can get away with that. Just make sure to make it your own. Did you get the idea from Jumper? Or were you thinking of ideas and just now noticed it is a lot like the movie? Be original! Make it your own! Don't copy for the sake of being an author. If you are really that paranoid about it, scratch the idea and think of something else. It's really easy to get ideas. Just look around you, go for a walk, use past experiences.|`|3tWlbje7aa	Lots of people are inspired by other books they've read, stories they know, songs they've listened to and so on.

UGBL3wREaa	First, photography is an Art. No one would have told Picasso that he had what it took. Second, your work is fantastic and even more so because of your age! Third, focus on high school but continue to pursue it. If you still love and are that passionate about it when your done and ready for college then pursue it. Regardless, you are already at the level of a professional. Talk to people you know and don't that do weddings and such..perhaps you could begin doing weddings as an assistant and then pursue even your own wedding sessions where  you go as the main photographer! You I know will be an outstanding photographer if you keep it up..your already a great one! :)|`|VFJUXwVNaa	Dude, to be perfectly honest, school should be a priority. You have some great shots and you should continue on with your photography. Take photography in school. <br>  <br>  You're too young to have to make a decision as to what you're going to do with your life, enjoy life, try everything out. School will open doors for you though and you'll be able to follow whatever passion you may have. Study photography in college! There are a lot of really cool art schools that will allow your passion to grow.<br>  <br>  Definitely keep taking pictures though and try to become as knowledgeable of a photographer as possible. You've got plenty of time to figure out what to do! |`|JvUzyLwcaa	Keep at it, you are very good. But also focus on school!! Also I would explore more possible career choices before you decide for sure that you want to be a photographer. I mean you have only been taking pictures for 6 months and after a while you might get bored and want to try something new, and if that happens go for it, your photography will be waiting when you get back!!|`|4HzRccNGaa	those are all really good i myself have turn my life long hobbie and into sumthing more!!! heres mine let me know what you think<br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jessicalynnephotography/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/jessicalynn...</a>|`|fa70fc6c0ebd4df17b301a1c34d3c0b0aa	1 School should always be a priority!!!! If you do not focus on school then you will not be able to take college courses in photography... On compliments the other.<br>  <br>  #2 Of course you should keep shooting regardless of how your pictures look. As with anything practice makes perfect and for some it makes them even better.<br>  <br>  #3 Read this through before you judge please.... Almost anyone can take nice pictures of nature. Mother nature makes it so easy with all the different colors and shapes ect... BUT it takes a "photographer" to tell a story with that picture. Some of your pictures create a story for me...<br>  <br>  #4 I would strongly encourage you to take some art classes and even photography classes in high school and continue into college if you choose to stay with it. DO NOT skip the basics classes just because you know the information. I have learned there is always some little thing I didn't know that makes my pictures better and I know it will be the same way for you.<br>  <br>  I do not know if you have done any research or taken any formal classes but you have a good start to a very keen photographic eye! One I wish I would have found at your age. Stick with it and enjoy it. If for no other reason but to keep your sanity.. I like a lot of your pictures like I said they tell me stories and that's what it is all about. <br>  <br>  Great job and keep it up|`|etQBVcGfaa	im the kid with the skateboard towards the end of the pictures if anyine is wondering|`|ulluAgHDaa	If they are your pics then you have some talent already - doing photography courses will enhance that talent - the courses will provide you with loads of little things that could take forever learn on your own - therefore study first and plan for future study....I loved the umbrellas by the way!
E478z7XGaa	Hi Ashley,<br>  <br>    I am guessing the reason you are having trouble playing the F in the highest register is that you are not supporting your air stream as much as it needs to be.  Have you tried playing any of the notes above that F.....  from F# to high C?<br>  <br>  You must use alot of diaphragm muscles to blow some steady and fast air.   It will not be a piece of cake right at first and especially if you are out of practice blowing those really high notes.<br>  <br>  I don't think it is your flute if you have had it checked out recently.<br>  Try playing some long tone exercises for F and all of the notes above that.<br>  <br>  In chromatic  style,  play each note, holding it out for 4 long counts.  Blow very hard and then go on the next note and so on until you reach high C.    Repeat the exercise over and over for about 15 minutes.   In about a week,  you should begin to see an improvement on playing those high register notes.   You might  get a head-rush  but it will eventually go away the more you work on it.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.<br>  <br>  Thanks for reading.:))|`|kbbOeaEgaa	one time in band camp...

XD But mainly, label your light source and think of where the shadows would be, i.e. opposite the light. For example, shadows would be in folds in clothing, under the neck, under where something hangs over (like a hat), wrapping around the edge of a form, etc...<br>  If you want, use references to help with shading. ^^ Or get a friend to critique in person. Looking at the reverse of a drawing also helps. |`|YZSIWGb5aa	ok where to begin<br>  1st: look at where it is darkest and where it is lightest<br>  2nd: you have to have control do not start off really dark you can always go back and make it darker<br>  3rd: practice a few times <br>  when you shade you have to apply many layers so it doesnt look scratchy sometimes.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|AA10916575	you might want to try downloading photoshop from adobe|`|9BxeiEzZaa	Be consistantly aware of where the primary source of light is coming from.When mixing an object's shady part,take the object's colour and add it's complimetary colour and a fairly strong gray.Experiment.|`|amcqJkWhaa	Look at a bunch of black and white photos, you'll see how each object is defined and what makes for good lighting. <br>  <br>  Also you might want to read a book on stage-makeup, like the one by Rosemarie Swinfield. It shows how shading and highlighting can distort/enhance features, in this case, features of a person's face, using only make-up-- this is what drawing-shading does.  <br>  <br>  There's books on how to get certain textures with shading. Like if you overlap ininiti signs, you'll get an interesting texture. |`|5rL4njnxaa	Locate and pay attention to the primary source of light.  If you are working from life, use a strong lamp and eliminate as many other sources as you can.  If you are just starting, work with an object that is all white- you can see the light and shadow more easily.<br>  <br>  Pay attention to all the intermediate shades of grey.  Create a grey scale.  If you are using pencil or charcoal, try using a tortillion or bending stump to blend and create soft shadows.

If we think happiness comes simply from the surroundings, and too busy trying to pursue one, we will never find it. Happiness is in our mind, only. Statistics show poor people are more likely to be happy than wealthy men; less greed.<br>  <br>  This quote, tells the reader to be grateful, and be satisfied for your current situation.

Work backwards from yourself and gather whatever information you are able to. Ask lots of questions, write down dates, places, family stories, anything at all that you can discover.

When/if they migrated? Did any of them return to Italy?<br>  <br>  From there, you can start exploring... looking at passenger lists, finding websites that have the English versions of births, deaths, marriages..it's a long and sometimes frustrating, but eventually rewarding hobby, which often becomes an obsession.<br>  <br>  One site that will help you learn where to look is as below.<br>  Best of luck... by the way, always keep a record of the source of your information, whether it be from Aunt Maria in 2008 or from a site or maybe from family certificates.

Qualcosa possiamo fare, almeno proviamoci per non lasciarlo solo. Chi non lo ha letto, e un dovere...<br>  <br>  La questione criminale? Affare del Sud, come i rifiuti<br>  di Roberto Saviano<br>  La speranza non ha un volto solo: ne ha dieci, cento, mille, centomila. Volti di ragazzi che sfilano con gioia, opponendo allegria alla cupezza di chi schiaccia il loro futuro, lo soffoca, umilia, disintegra. Volti di ragazzi che con quell'allegria urlano la voglia di libertà, la disperazione per un destino senza nulla in cui credere. La loro marcia era scandita da un elenco senza fine, rilanciato da tutti gli altoparlanti come nelle feste di paese si fa per le musichette: la cantilena ossessiva di un rosario doloroso che unisce in una catena settecentocinque nomi. Settecentocinque cadaveri, settecentocinque giusti, settecentocinque vite che si sono spente ma non piegate lottando contro la mafia: un sacrificio di massa che permetteva a quei ragazzi di marciare senza minacce. La litania dei martiri era infinita, la lista ricominciava sempre dall'inizio, come se la speranza di legalità potesse risorgere soltanto dal sacrificio, dal sangue versato per rendere fertile la terra desolata. ? <br>  <br>   Neppure il miracolo di Bari ha smosso qualcosa, neanche l'ondata umana che nel segno di Libera ha riunito tanti ruscelli in unico gesto di rivolta ha dato una scossa ai media chiusi nel torpore di una quotidianità disillusa e alla politica di una campagna elettorale dove si fatica a trovare un contenuto dietro le parole. Mafia è una parola rara e banalizzata, bisogna maledirla per copione e poi dimenticarla in fretta per andare avanti con comizi che devono sempre occuparsi d'altro. Sarebbe stato meglio se mafia fosse stato un termine pericoloso, di quelli che fanno da calamita all'odio, una parola che si fa carne viva di impegno. L'hanno formattizzata, diventa un punto in scaletta, per condire l'introduzione del discorso come i saluti di circostanza. O peggio del peggio, da relegare nelle regioni meridionali.<br>  I leader di centrosinistra e centrodestra non se ne sono occupati? - mi è stato risposto solo pochi giorni fa -, ma lo faranno più avanti, quando arriveranno nel Sud, lo faranno a Napoli quando chiuderanno la campagna. Lo faranno a sud, come per i rifiuti più velenosi che nessuno sa dove buttare e si mandano a inquinare una terra contaminata e condannata. Lo faranno a sud, come se la potenza della criminalità organizzata non riguardasse il nord, come se la ricchezza dei traffici mafiosi non arricchisse le banche padane o se i voti manovrati dai padrini non condizionassero i palazzi romani. Il perimetro del problema agli occhi della politica si è ristretto da piaga planetaria ad affare locale: come se i Kalashnikov avessero sparato e ucciso a Duisburg per una lite di campanile o i casalesi colonizzassero Aberdeen per imparare meglio l'inglese.<br>  <br>  'Ndrangheta, camorra e mafia, anzi, come le chiamano gli affiliati, Cosa Nuova, Sistema e Cosa Nostra sono oggi più di ogni altro il 'potere forte'. Quello che controlla direttamente un terzo del paese, quello che è infiltrato in tutto il territorio e ha facoltà di condizionare indirettamente interi settori dell'economia - i trasporti, gli ospedali, i subappalti edili, le catene di supermercati, la produzione tessile, il comparto agricolo, l'industria alimentare, le candidature dei primari, la distribuzione di benzina, i centri commerciali - come un cancro le cui metastasi si sono già diffuse in ogni parte d'Italia e persino d'Europa.<br>  <br>  Il potere che decide con quale parte politica schierarsi, quello capace ormai da decenni di sottomettere la politica dei propri territori d'origine e persino di quelli d'investimento al punto di non avere più bisogno di accedere a coperture di livello superiore. Le mafie oggi possono farne a meno perché si sono fatte più ciniche, più realistiche, e perché sono diventate infinitamente più potenti e indefinite, allo stesso tempo arroganti e mimetiche.<br>  <br>  Parlarne, affrontare il problema significa rischiare di perdere un numero troppo alto di consensi, ecco perché. Così tutti si limitano a commenti di solidarietà con le vittime e gli inquirenti, complimenti alle forze dell'ordine, generici appelli alla moralità e alla lotta alle mafie. A Palermo le denunce dei commercianti per la prima volta fanno arrestare gli estorsori, è una rivoluzione che per loro merita giusto il tempo di un comunicato. E poi tutto tace di nuovo. Ma perché siano le mafie a tacere per sempre bisogna fronteggiarle senza compromessi, anche a costo di perdere le elezioni nell'immediato per 'vincere' col tempo, una ricchezza e una libertà inestimabili - la salvezza del nostro paese. L'unica che potrà non far sentire l'Italia un paese determinato dal potere criminale.<br>  <br>  Nessuno crede che il compito della politica sia di costruire paradisi: che il fato ci scampi da questa maledizione. Nessuno può pensare che ci siano ricette taumaturgiche, che basti un po' di decisionismo e di buona volontà per risanare ciò che per decenni è stato lasciato incancrenire. Ma si smetta di trattare i cittadini come appartenenti a due tifoserie opposte che non possono far altro che scegliere fra l'una e l'altra fazione e con questo si assumono ogni responsabilità di quel che accade dopo le elezioni. Si smetta di chiedere loro con chi stanno. Inizino piuttosto i partiti a dire attraverso scelte chiare in che modo vogliono stare con i cittadini. Scelte che non siano di comodo e di compromesso, che non mirino a un rinnovamento di facciata senza il coraggio di disfarsi dei meccanismi che portano in cambio voti sicuri. Inizino pure dalla fine, se non hanno altro da dire prima.<br>  <br>  Walter Veltroni sarà a Napoli, pochi giorni prima del voto, lì sappia trovare parole che nessun cittadino e nessun mafioso possano mai dimenticare. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  di Roberto Saviano <br>  20 marzo 2008

DzrMNUUJaa	El libro más largo del mundo     PDF      Imprimir      E-Mail<br>  <br>  En 1960, el escritor francés Raymond Queneau presentó el que probablemente sea el libro más extenso del mundo. Se trata de Cent mille miliards de poèmes, y apenas ocupa diez páginas que contienen, cada una, un soneto. Los versos mantienen todos la misma rima y están cortados en tiras, de modo que pueden combinarse con los de los otros sonetos. Así, el número total de combinaciones posibles que contiene el libro es de 10 elevado a 14, es decir, cien billones de poemas distintos. Eso implica que nadie nunca podrá leer el libro entero por mucho que se empe?e, ya que se tardarían varios millones de a?os en casar todos los poemas, y eso sin comer, ni dormir, ni leer revistas ni nada. ?Todo en sólo diez páginas!|`|244d02a73f5d3c856bab5a28b5b8deb8aa	hola.. yo kreo k el Quijote de la mancha.. esta muy extenso.. bye|`|5s1yJrXoaa	Creo que la historia interminable, porque nunca se termina.|`|w48KFwi4aa	los de escritores famosos|`|9otKQpnIaa	la biblia|`|CZK8HKsTaa	harry potter la ultima por internet|`|G8xQvdZNaa	Caballo de troya jejeje... xD <br>  <br>  Bye suerte!|`|TKt3EYrraa	Sin duda, el que más aburrido se te haga.|`|nQuNTRHuaa	Muy buena respuesta la de Kannys; en caso de ser asi, le doy la razon.<br>  <br>  Pero hay una cosa q no entendi de esta pregunta.

9lxrQixoaa	no, but you would come to your senses, based on instincts and logic, you would start to question the meaning of life?, then maybe after building a model, i made this model, created it, it'll bring the question who created us?<br>  the big bang? but were did the chemicals/rocks come from, who created those materials? just like a clay model, clay was made by us as well as the model<br>  there's something bigger and better than us that created us<br>  <br>  why is it unexplainable, because the human mind is limited, each animal on earth has limited brain powers<br>  <br>  then come the questioning, 'why?'<br>  well its like trying to teach a monkey to use a computer, they just wont understand there brains are limited to understand such thing<br>  or going back in time and telling cavemen you made a tv, a box with colours and flashing light and out can see people live<br>  <br>  its difficult to understand<br>  <br>  we dont inevt storys of the universe, we use logic, our brains something god gave us<br>  <br>  i mean seriously after studying and discovering the detailed-nes of our bodies themselves let alone the universe, we have millions of cells, nephrons kidneys, a heart that pumps all by it self, could this all be created by itself? by chance? its impossible, billions of people, all look diffrent<br>  its hard to imagine that there isn't something more powerful than us, something that didn't create us. god<br>  <br>  but then thats my interpretation, my logic and understanding, i think its better to belive in something, because beliving that nothing created us, and when we die, we die, then you really dont have a reason to get up every morning, why shoudl you do good and blah i find it hard not to belive<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|7XxtDUVCaa	I don't believe in god anyway.|`|ybdNwzMBaa	Hi, Boy are you way of beam,just take a simple look at nature how did an insect pollinate a flower that looks smells like a female insect.

All others are content to be born, procreate, die.<br>  <br>  The world and people have been around a lot longer than the current Christian God - or for that matter, the gods of any other monotheistic religion.<br>  <br>  Ancient civilisations believed in multiple gods simply because they could not understand the workings of the universe without applying a "more powerful than me" deity to control those workings - the sun, moon, growth of crops, love, war etc.<br>  <br>  The Christian religion is a masculine-based religion but there are many others out there that are earth-honouring and goddess centred.|`|mzDnV1Cqaa	You are just saying that there are a lot of things in the universe that we don't understand, so this is one of them. If a person never went to church, and nobody ever talked to him about God, what do you think that person is going to think about his origins?. Sometimes in his life he will ask that question, where am I coming from?, there has to be a beginning, so it is not a man-made invention, whatever you say about God doesn't matter, the matter is that we are coming from somewhere, if you see the human anatomy you will realise that we are perfect, the functions of every limb, vein,muscle, organ in the body is perfect, without any of them it will be difficult to function, we weren't created by some kind of Frankestein doctor or alien race, we are too perfect, so it is not convenient or sad that we are here. You don't invent a story that lasts for thousand and thousands of years, I hope one day you will understand this and the only way is reading the bible, you will have the answers there.|`|9VTCqyFeaa	No, I wouldn't. And in fact, that's my exact situation.<br>  <br>  However, I do not have any problems with people who believe in God, and I'll respect their beliefs. But there are a few conditions to how far that goes.<br>  I do not like people who involve me in their religion, they should keep it to themselves. And more importantly, people praising God whenever something good happens when someone put a lot of effort in it. I find this very insulting to the person who worked for it. Just to include some examples:<br>  - Parents thanking god when a doctor saved their child's life.<br>  - People wondering how God gave someone the power to get that world record for a certain sport.<br>  I don't mind if the sportsman him/herself is religious and shares the same belief, but otherwise it really is very insulting.<br>  I'm not saying everyone does this, just mentioning before anyone gets offended, but I have seen this happen a lot of times.<br>  <br>  Just my 2 cents.|`|AZlIQvE1aa	Well if no one talked about God, then no i would not technically not know God exists. But then how did the idea of God first arise then? Why God? There was a time when there was no thought of a supreme being or anything other then what we could see. If God was just an elaborate story to fill in answers to questions you have to wonder why sooo many people would believe in such a lie. There are many religions that believe in some sort of supreme thing or things. If i had no knowledge of God I would truly be curious as to why i just happen to be so lucky. There is no scientific explanation for the reason why every single time that I did not finish my math homework last year, I had the same supply teacher who never checked homework. 1 or 2 times it's a lucky coincidence but after about 7 times its like ummmmmmm... what the? In the end i would believe i had to come from somewere. All cells come from pre-existing cells right?<br>  <br>  ...I really like Big Daddy's answer. I wouldn't rule out the alien origins though ahaha|`|392a91e32207acc30c423125f639d22aaa	I liken religions to wheels, they serve their purposes, and there is something amiss to humanity if they should be purged from our culture  - like relics and antiques, I suppose.<br>  <br>  If we don't know where we have been, there is no telling us that we are going in circles and repeating the same discoveries or mistakes.  We just shouldn't hold on to them like they are the only tools we would ever have in life.|`|dBXSdk5Taa	if i believed in god and my family didn't i would still wouldn't change what i believed in him.|`|rG1q4SPFaa	I totally agree!|`|vcbeF860aa	i think some of the folks here have missed the point.<br>  what you mean is this: would anyone believe in god if they never heard of it. the answer is "no!" god, religions, belief systems- they all exist because people cause them to exist. in the days of old, people could not explain certain things so they so they assigned those phenomena to some higher beings with supernatural powers. But now we know thunders don’t roar or earthquakes occur because Zeus is nodding his head! What I mean is this- science has explained most of those things to us.<br>  <br>  Imagine an island where all new born babies are made to grow up…away from the pre-existing notions of God but given the education which we all receive. They would be curious about their origin but scientific explanations would convince them more than an “umm… because of this Guy called God who we haven’t really seen but who made the Earth in six days and then…” <br>  <br>  And please do not argue that it is the fear of God that makes us believe in right and wrong, good and bad. All atheists, if you have not noticed till now, are not murderers. In fact, the believers seem to be doing most of the killings these days.

I think that Absolutes are mere concepts and not a reality in the universe. In my view, both zero and infinity are concepts that can not exist in reality....... what exists can only be the Maximum or the Minimum, which are obviously relative rather than absolute. Absolute zero temperature implies that there is absolutely zero element of the heat energy, which is not a reality that can exist in the universe. Similarly, the speed of light is merely the maximum that can exist in the universe.... I believe that any number that can be quantified can always be lower than another number.... thus the speed of light at 186000 miles per second is of course less than 187000 miles per second which is a valid possible speed faster than light..... that may not be possible to exist in the universe which merely means that the speed of light is the maximum in the universe, but that does not qualify it to be an Absolute speed....... the Absolute speed must be infinity which can by definition never be exceeded and like all other Absolutes, it would simply be a concept rather than a reality.    I repeat that all the Absolutes that we can imagine would only be conceptual and not real, because any Absolute implies either zero or infinity both of which are unreal...... in reality what we can have is only Maximum or Minimum which by definition is relative rather than absolute.|`|123cb0f60a65c8151ec27e589a993e7faa	Amoungst those things that are truely absolute,we must put such facts as;   It is as "hot as hell",and that   it is-or the vast majority of it is- alien or Destructive to life.|`|33a05d5ba88a6895c5cdcdaf425d01d3aa	only God is the Absolute, every other thing is relative.

Besides the theories of Aryabhata in the Aryabhatiya and the lost Arya-siddhānta, we find the Pancha-Siddhāntika of Varahamihira. From this time on, we find a predominance of geocentric models, and possibly heliocentric models, in Indian astronomy, in contrast to the "Merucentric" astronomy of Puranic, Jaina and Buddhist traditions whose actual mathematics has been largely lost and only fabulous accounts remain.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  The astronomy and the astrology of ancient India (Jyotisha) is based upon sidereal calculations, although a tropical system was also used in a few cases. For example, Uttarayana (Uttarāyana ????????) was determined according to a tropical system in the Mahabharata, or by Lagadha in the Vedanga Jyotisha. But even then, sidereal astronomy was the mainstay. Now, even Uttarāyana is determined according to the sidereal system of Hindus.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Linguistics<br>  Main articles: Vyakarana and Tolkāppiyam<br>  Further information: Panini (grammarian), Bhartrihari, and History of linguistics <br>  Linguistics (along with phonology, morphology, etc.) first arose among Indian grammarians who were attempting to catalog and codify Sanskrit's rules. Modern linguistics owes a great deal to these grammarians, and to this day, for example, key terms for compound analysis such as bahuvrihi are taken from Sanskrit.<br>  <br>  Linguistics was pursued in ancient India for many centuries. The Sanskrit grammar of Pā?ini (c. 520 – 460 BCE), who is often considered the founder of linguistics, contains a particularly detailed description of Sanskrit morphology, phonology and roots, evincing a high level of linguistic insight and analysis. In particular, he is most famous for formulating the 3,959 rules of Sanskrit morphology in the text A??ādhyāyī. His sophisticated grammar of Sanskrit continues to be in use to this day. The Indian grammatical tradition is believed to have been active for many centuries before Pā?ini, and anticipates by millennia certain developments in the West, such as the phoneme and the generation of word forms by the successive application of morphological rules for example. (Outside of India, the phoneme seems to have been discovered and forgotten several times through history.)<br>  <br>  The South Indian linguist Tolkāppiyar (c. 3rd century BCE) wrote the Tolkāppiyam, the grammar of Tamil, which is also still in use today. Bhartrihari (c. 450 – 510) was another important author on Indic linguistic theory. He theorized the act of speech as being made up of three stages: conceptualization by the speaker; performance of speaking; and comprehension by the interpreter. The work of Pā?ini, and the later Indian linguist Bhartrihari, had a significant influence on many of the foundational ideas proposed by Ferdinand de Saussure, professor of Sanskrit, who is widely considered the father of modern structural linguistics.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Mathematics<br>  Main article: Indian mathematics<br>  Main authors of classical Indian mathematics (400 CE to 1200 CE) are scholars like Aryabhata, Brahmagupta, and Bhaskara II. Indian mathematicians made early contributions to the study of the decimal number system, zero, negative numbers, arithmetic, and algebra. In addition, trigonometry, having evolved in the Hellenistic world and having been introduced into ancient India through the translation of Greek works, was further advanced in India, and, in particular, the modern definitions of sine and cosine were developed there. These mathematical concepts were transmitted to the Middle East, China, and Europe and led to further developments that now form the foundations of many areas of mathematics.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Medicine and surgery<br>  Main article: Ayurveda<br>  Ayurvedic practice was flourishing during the time of Buddha (around 520 BC) , and in this period the Ayurvedic practitioners were commonly using Mercuric-sulphur combination based medicines. An important Ayurvedic practitioner of this period was Nagarjuna, a Buddhist herbologist, famous for inventing various new drugs for the treatment of ailments.[citation needed] Nagarjuna was accompanied by Surananda, Nagbodhi, Yashodhana, Nityanatha, Govinda, Anantdev, Vagbhatta etc.<br>  <br>  Sushruta (also spelt Susruta or Sushrutha) (c. 6th century BC) was the first surgeon in the world who lived in ancient India and is the author of the book Sushruta Samhita, in which he describes over 120 surgical instruments, 300 surgical procedures and classifies human surgery in 8 categories. He lived and taught and practiced his art on the banks of the Ganga in the area that corresponds to the present day city of Varanasi in North India.<br>  Plastic surgery developed in India.<br>  <br>  During the regime of Chandragupta Maurya (375-415 AD), Ayurveda was part of mainstream Indian medical techniques, and continued to be so until the colonisation by the British. Chakrapani Dutta (DuttaSharma) was a Vaid Brahman of Bengal who wrote books on Ayurveda such as "Chakradutta" and others. Chakrapani Dutta was the Rajavaidya of Great King Laxman Sen {some says rajVaid of King Nayapala (1038 - 1055)}. It is believed by some practitioners that Chakradutta is the essence of Ayurveda.<br>  <br>  Ayurveda has always been preserved by the people of India as a traditional "science of life", despite increasing adoption of European medical techniques during the time of British rule. For several decades the reputation and skills of the various Ayurvedic schools declined markedly as Western medicine and Western-style hospitals were built. However, beginning in the 1970s, a gradual recognition of value of Ayurveda returned, and today Ayurvedic hospitals and practitioners are flourishing throughout all of India. As well, the production and marketing of Ayurvedic herbal medicines has dramatically increased, as well as scientific documentation of benefits. Today, Ayurvedic medicines are available throughout the world.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Philosophical Discussions<br>   This article does not cite any references or sources. (September 2007)<br>  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unverifiable material may be challenged and removed. <br>  <br>  Further information: Indian physics <br>  A number of Indian theories on physics have attracted the attention of Indologists. Veteran Australian Indologist Arthur Llewellyn Basham has concluded that:<br>  <br>  "They were brilliant imaginative explanations of the physical structure of the world, and in a large measure, agreed with the discoveries of modern physics."<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Atomism<br>  Further information: Indian atomism <br>  The concept of the atom in ancient India derives from the classification of the material world in five basic elements by Indian philosophers. This classification existed since Vedic times (c. 1500 BCE). The elements were the earth (prithvi), fire (agni), air (vayu), water (jaal) and ether or space (aksha). The elements were associated with human sensory perceptions: smell, touch, vision, taste and ether/space respectively. Later, Buddhist philosophers replaced ether/space with life, joy and sorrow.<br>  <br>  Ancient Indian philosophers believed that all elements except ether were physically palpable and hence comprised of minuscule particles. The smallest particle, which could not be subdivided, was called paramanu in Sanskrit (shortened to parmanu), from parama (ultimate or beyond) and anu (atom). Thus, "paramanu" literally means "beyond atom" and this was a concept at an abstract level which suggested the possibility of splitting atoms, which is now the source of atomic energy. However, the term "atom" should not be conflated with the concept of atom as it is understood today.<br>  <br>  The 6th century BCE Indian philosopher Kanada was the first person who went deep systematically in such theorization. Another Indian philosopher, Pakudha Katyayana, a contemporary of Buddha, also propounded the ideas of atomic constitution of the material world. All these were based on logic and philosophy and lacked any empirical basis for want of commensurate technology.<br>  <br>  Will Durant wrote in Our Oriental Heritage:<br>  <br>  "Two systems of Hindu thought propound physical theories suggestively similar to those of Greece. Kanada, founder of the Vaisheshika philosophy, held that the world was composed of atoms as many in kind as the various elements. The Jains more nearly approximated to Democritus by teaching that all atoms were of the same kind, producing different effects by diverse modes of combinations. Kanada believed light and heat to be varieties of the same substance; Udayana taught that all heat comes from the sun; and Vachaspati, like Newton, interpreted light as composed of minute particles emitted by substances and striking the eye."<br>  <br>  <br>  [edi

a7QLIsv9aa	I was thinking it was b/c 20 yrs would be too cliche. And that would make him 36 yrs old, right? If his oldest son is 12, that would mean he and Ginny had the kid when he was 24, which is a decent age - 7 yrs after the fact, time to recuperate. (Hope my math's right in this one)|`|WY56HifDaa	My assumption was it gave enough time for them to recover, get married, have time to have kids, and the kids get old enough to go to Hogwarts. <br>  Ron's mom Molly was talking about how when Voldemort first appeared there was a rash of quick marriages, I assume that there probably were many marriages right after the victory as well.|`|HwQQMPTqaa	I didnt think there was a reason, but i think TJ man is tight. I wouldnt have mad that connction in a million years! But it makes sense.|`|6fMJn3mraa	I don't think so. I think more of a respectable time for all of them to have more children and just ready to go to hogwarts.  would be a bit odd if it was 9 years later and their first kid was jumping on the train to hogwarts :)|`|KuP5CZNGaa	You could also say why not? J. K. may not have used 20 years per say because it's a very rounded number. It also makes Harry 36 I believe, so it's a round about number for having children of an adequate age to attend Hogwarts, therefore setting the scene for the epilogue.

dRvpXFLvaa	bueno como ya lo mencionaste, es el profesor de hogwarts, es maestro de pociones aunque a el le interesan mucho mas las artes oscuras.<br>  te voy a contar desde que era ni?o:<br>  <br>  Snape era vecino, o vivia cerca de donde vivia Lily Evans (mama de harry) desde ni?o estuvo enamorado de ella, despues a los 11 fueron juntos a Hogwarts, la mama de Snape era bruja, por lo tanto Snape sabia muchas mas cosas de Hogwarts que Lily, ya que ella era hija de muggles.. cuando iban en el tren, Snape le dijo a Lily que el queria entrar a Slytherin, en eso James Potter lo escucho y desde alli le cayo mal.. total Lily quedo en Griffyndor junto con James y Snape en Slytherin...<br>  Pasados loa a?os Snape le reclamaba a Lily que ellos prometieron ser siempre amigos, y le reclamaba que ella siempre estaba con James, Lily le respondio que a ella no le gustaban los amigos de Snape...<br>  <br>  Snape odiaba a James porque a el le gustaba Lily..<br>  <br>  Saliendo de la escuela James y Lily se casaron, y Snape se unio a Voldemort...<br>  Despues de un tiempo Dumbledore le estaba haciendo una entrevista a la maestra Sibyll Trelawney y ella en ese momento dijo una profecia, y Snape la escucho pero a medias y fue y le dijo a Voldemort, y asi fue como Voldemort mato a James, Lily y trato de matar a Harry pero no pudo, en su lugar el fue destruido...<br>  <br>  Snape se sentia muy culpable y fue a pedirle ayuda a Dumbledore pero este puso de condicion que el le tendria que ayudar a proteger a Harry.. Snape acepto...<br>  <br>  Snape hizo prometer a Dumbledore que nunca se sabria que el estaba protegiendo a Harry, por esa misma razon Snape le hacia la vida de cuadritos a Harry, aparte de que se parecia mucho a su papa.. pasado el tiempo Dumbledore le dijo a Snape que harry debia morir para poder destruir a Voldemort, y snape le reclamo, le dijo que todo ese tiempo cuidandolo para que despues lo mataran... Alli Dumbledore se dio cuenta de que snape queria a Harry, le pregunto a Snape que si lo queria y Snape le contesto que si...<br>  <br>  Snape murio en manos de Voldemort por un mal entendido que le costo la vida a Voldemort...<br>  <br>  espero que le entiendas, saluditos|`|175a76c9e371848e51e6eaff5764f33baa	Ginny ya te conto toda su historia, estoy de acuerdo con ella...|`|A145CW0Daa	que papel tiene en la saga???<br>  <br>  Bueno, en los primeros 5 libros es el maestro de pociones, en el libro 6 es el maestro de defensa contra las artes oscuras y en el 7 es el director de hogwarts.<br>  <br>  Facil, no?|`|HChoQLB6aa	Exacto ... de acuerdo totalmente con Ginny!|`|z3NkbFZLaa	El profesor Snape es un personaje raro , al principio cunaod voldemord  estaba vivo , Snape era mortifago , pero al matar a la familia de harry  y a mas personas , Snape se dio cuenta de que lo estaba haciendo mal , y decidio alistarse  a la orden del fenix con dumblerdore y demas. <br>  Que se lleve mal con harry potter no quiere decir que este con voldemor.<br>  <br>  Se lleva mal con harry potrter , porque el padre de harry era compa?ero de snape  y un dia el padre de harry le jugo una mala pasada a snape y snape se enfado mucho!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Buenoe spero que te haya servido de ayuda

WYngdeacaa	The only other contender to conquer world where the Chinese.  The reason things turned out the way they did is that Europeans were extroverted and the Chinese were introverted.<br>  <br>  For cultural, economic, and political reasons, the Europeans wanted to know what was over the next hill or over the next wave.  Much of it had to do with the fact that they knew there were much richer and more advanced nations out there, and they wanted a piece of the pie.<br>  <br>  The Chinese, on the other hand, developed a philosophy that they were the supreme pinnacle of human civilization.  No other nation could even come close to them in terms of technology, economy, and education.  They felt it was pointless to go out into the world since everything they would find would disappoint.  In their view, all the other nations should come to China and pay homage.  This arrogance and complacency caused to them to stagnate economically, culturally, and technologically.  <br>  <br>  There is an old Chinese military maxim:  "Only he who is weak attacks".  The Chinese felt they weren't so they didn't.  The Europeans thought they were so they did.  Or put another way, why go to the trouble of conquest when you don't need anything.|`|ZDrXFS2daa	Because they were the ones who were capable and ready to do the exploring.

Making a current comparison would be the same as to travel for the space until the moon.  Nor all of the countries of the Earth can make that.  <br>  Portugal, Spain, France, England and Holland dominated the art of the navigation and they developed maps, that were confidential documents and they had a lot of value at that time of the explorations.|`|pwj8BXboaa	Not a very good book really.  He explains why Eurasians had superior technology to Americans, but can't explain why it was a Spaniard and not a Chinese or Arab or Indian who conquered America.<br>  <br>  The story is very complex and fully of historical accidents, but I believe it can be explained partly as an after-effect of the Mongol invasions.  The Mongols briefly united most of Asia under a single empire.  This unity facilitated a huge increase in traffic among the various civilizations.  Thus Chinese technologies such as artillery, printing and paper were transported to the rest of Asia and Europe. Think Marco Polo, etc.<br>  <br>  After "stirring the pot", the Mongol empire devolved into local tyrannies in each of the population centers they conquered-- China, India, Persia, and the Middle East.  Each of these regions remained under the control of a single Emperor.<br>  <br>  The European civilization was the one population center that the Mongols failed to conquer and consolidate.  As a result, they profited from the technologies that contact with the Mongols brought them, but, but never fell under the yoke of a single Conqueror.  Instead, they were left to fight among themselves for dominance.  <br>  <br>  It was at this critical juncture, when Europe was exposed to the highest technologies available, but politically in a state of high competition, that the modern world was formed.  <br>  <br>  Remember, Columbus discovered America because they were desparate to find direct access to India and China.  Why were they desperate?  Because the Ottoman Empire had recently gained control over the entire Middle East and had cut off direct European access to the East.<br>  <br>  Why did Spain fund this effort to find a trade route to India?  Because they were in competition with the kings of Portugal, France, England, and especially the Italian city states.<br>  <br>  Gavin Menzies points out how the Chinese fleets in the early Ming dynasty were much more capable of colonizing & conquering the world BEFORE Columbus.  But they didn't.  Why?  Because the decisions in Ming China were made by a single political entity, the Ming Emperor.  There were no competing emporers or kings who might have attempted this with a similar fleet.  So when the Emperor of China orderd the destruction of the fleet, that was the end of it.<br>

hUQtHzBFaa	It is one of the best schools you can get in, if you are accepted. People who attended the school are serious about the programs (no slackers). It is very expensive, and not so easy to get in. Start applying or inquiring now if you are interested. A lot of famous people came from it - one in particular Spike Lee. If you are serious and willing to work extra hard and can afford it (check for scholarships and grants), go apply for it.<br>  <br>  If you want to be an actor, and willing to work hard for it and starve for it - Chicago is the place to go. Second City is where you can hone in your craft. A lot of working actors (well known) came from that place. There are a lot of small theatre where you can also practice and improve your craft - if you get to act in them.|`|dGLdJxrsaa	Tisch is one of the top art schools in the nation, if not the world. It is pricy, but its programs are phenomenal for anyone aspiring to go into the entertainment/arts in their future. Because of its competitiveness, Tisch does expect a portfolio of prior work to be submited, so that they can distingush between those applicants who are good, and those who are great. <br>  <br>  If you want to go into musical theatre, Tisch is definitely a prime option. I would go for it and apply. But, just because it's an arts school doesn't mean that it doesn't expect the academics to be high. You need a solid GPA, as well as a gallery of various extracurricular activities. Also, make sure you're going out and doing some acting stuff on your own, whether it's for your school, or whether it's scripting and acting in your own movies/plays.<br>  <br>  Whatever it is, just show them that you've got a light shining in you, and that you're different from the other applicants. Be uberly creative, and go above and beyond.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped, and good luck!|`|cQjEMhocaa	Everyone is going to tell you 'its one of the best schools!'  and it may be, but its not phenomenal.<br>  It is well respected.  It is a good school.  However their undergraduate program is very different than their graduate program and their undergrad excepts tons of kids of year and has hundreds enrolled.  You pick a specific medium, (i.e. musical theatre) and study that but a closer search at schools may yield more interesting musical theatre potential somewhere else for you.  <br>  Personally I dont do musical theatre so I am not as familiar with those schools.  They would be east coast generally and some of the universities now have good BFA programs and are state funded and much cheaper than NYU.<br>  I WILL say that agents and casting directors are partial to NYU on a resume though, regardless of talent.

Only a professional who gets paid for their shots would really notice a difference.

48OX56Czaa	No!  Nobody had the right Natives off of the land they had lived on long before the Europeans came over.  So many Native Americans died on the trail of tears and it had always been THEIR land.  They preserved and respected it and lived on it for centuries.  The Europeans cut a path of destruction and devastated the land and the natives living on it.|`|Euwt7fHfaa	The Trail of Tears was the forced relocation of Native Americans from their homelands to Indian Territory (present day Oklahoma) in the Western United States. The phrase originated from a description of the removal of the Choctaw Nation in 1831.[1] Many Native Americans suffered from exposure, disease, and starvation while en route to their destinations, and many died, including, for example, 4,000 of the 15,000 relocated Cherokee.[2] Thousands of enslaved and free African-Americans (as slaves accompanying their Native American slaveowners and as former runaway slaves that were assisted by, assimilated by, or married to members of the tribes) accompanied the removed nations on the Trail of Tears.[3]<br>  <br>  In 1830, the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee (Creek), and Seminole (sometimes collectively referred to as the Five Civilized Tribes) were living as autonomous nations in what would be called the American Deep South. The process of cultural transformation (proposed by George Washington and Henry Knox) was gaining momentum, especially among the Cherokee and Choctaw.[4] Indian removal was first proposed by Thomas Jefferson.[citation needed] Andrew Jackson was the first U.S. President to implement removal with the passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830. In 1831 the Choctaw were the first to be removed, and they became the model for all other removals. After the Choctaw, the Seminole were removed in 1832, the Creek in 1834, then the Chickasaw in 1837, and finally the Cherokee in 1838.<br>  <br>  <br>  ** the trail of tears was necessary for the development of the south. this prevented a war between the new settlers and the indians<br>

fa70fc6c0ebd4df17b301a1c34d3c0b0aa	Use an f/stop (typically between F/8 and F/16 depends on what ISO your shooting at) that will allow enough like to get the horizon somewhat (ie shillouettes of the trees, buildings, whatever) then use a slow shutter speed 3-15 seconds. A tripod is a must and if you have one use a remote, other wise you run the risk of getting camera shake in your pictures from depressing the button. It's inevitable for all of us but a very few select individual who have a wierd ability to not move while moving..... haha I recommend F/16 ISO 100 and a 4-8 second shutter.

Adjust as required.<br>  <br>  When firework is launched open shutter, when firework finishes close shutter - simple.<br>  <br>  You can try keeping shutter open for multiple fireworks, but if they explode in the same piece of sky they will blow out to white.

fa70fc6c0ebd4df17b301a1c34d3c0b0aa	Yes changing your ISO will definately help and is the best course of action if you choose not to use your flash.<br>  <br>  The higher ISO will stop the motion if set correctly (high enough).<br>  <br>  Another thing you need to be concerned with if shooting indoors with your flash is the lights in the room your shooting in. My guess is your pictures are coming out looking orange. That is due to the incadensent bulbs in the room. Fourescent bulbs will also affect image quality.<br>  <br>  If possible you want to adjust your white balance. you can either change your white balance for the different symbols (I suggest looking in your manual for definitions without knowing your camera) OR you can change your white balance to the "K" mode or Kelvin scale. <br>  <br>  Kelvin is a measure of temperature and most cameras are factory set at 5300K to 5700K and fluctuate between 1000K & 15000K. The higher the number the warmer the light or more orange the picture will come out. Conversly the lower the number the cooler or more blue the picture will come out. Thereofre if your taking pictures indoors with your flash and the are coming out orange then you will want to adjust your white balance to the "K" setting and then adjust the temperature down to maybe 2800K. And then increase your ISO to 800 or higher to stop the motion or blur.<br>  <br>  Which at this point i would recommend as the pther have to begin shooting in manual mode and manual mode only. By doing so you are forcing yourself to learn more about your camera and how it reacts in differnt sitiuations, which in the long run is only going to make you a better photographer by teaching you how to make a good solid image with less editing later saving you time and time is money in our world. And, it also gives you a lesson in creativity to the pint you can intentionally change your settings to get a more creative outcome for your image.<br>  <br>  Email me if you have more questions.....we as photographers need to share andlearn from each other. |`|6644da85d010d98c8e75bdddc3c55c49aa	What ISO are you using? I increase mine to 3,200--and yes, it's going to be noisy--but at least the shutter speed will be fast enough. <br>  <br>  I set mine in P mode. There are times that it is far too dark and if flash can't be used, I'd rather get decent exposure, than worrying about the DOF--unless I can increase the ISO. I do keep an eye on the aperture--and I change it accordingly-in shift mode. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/little_pooky/2969454423/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/little_pook...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/little_pooky/2792162826/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/little_pook...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/little_pooky/2598868114/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/little_pook...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/little_pooky/2526702667/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/little_pook...</a><br>  <br>  etc<br>  |`|GQbbf3Edaa	you should invest in faster lenses, f/2.8,f1.8,f/1.4. fixed 50,85,180mm and these lenses are sharp Consider working manuel this will you control of your settings. Yes ISO will help also even though it will be noisy you are getting the shot. |`|SdZBOmptaa	the way to avoid camera shake which creates the blur is to use a tripod.|`|AfYL9pLvaa	I suggest that u use the tripod and face the camera at the bright spot.|`|v7LBEYQ7aa	Best thing to do is to shoot in Manual if I were you.<br>  P is the worst because you don't get to really dig in and feel what your doing, plus with manual you get to know your camera more.<br>  <br>  With manual you can change the aperture and shutter speed together, much more better than shutter speed alone. [which is what I find happens in aperture priority.]<br>  Changing the ISO does a HUGE amount of difference.<br>  When you put your ISO higher, the camera tries to seek all the light there is to seek.<br>  <br>  Also, you can make the flash a lot less harsh by slipping a note card in front of it and bouncing the flash off of the note card, onto the ceiling, and onto the subject.<br>  It's less harsh on their eyes, and isn't to bright on the photograph.<br>  <br>  Again, Try to use Manual as much as you can to get a better feel of your camera and how to use it.
fa70fc6c0ebd4df17b301a1c34d3c0b0aa	Based on the limited information you gave us I am going to make an assumption ( yes I know how that usually turns out but to give you the best answer I can I need to in this case)<br>  <br>  The assumption is this.... That you hired a photographer for your wedding and as part of your package you purchased a CD with the rights to those pictures. Which, I do not understand why some photogs do this but it seem prevalent in my area as well. Anyway, and now you want to print some pictures but want your photographer to print them with her printing source because you want the quality print rather than then "everyday" printer look. <br>  <br>  If this is the case then yes the photographer will want a copyright release from you because she wants to protect herself from copyright infringement. She sold the rights to you in your package and now you are contracting her to make prints of copyrighted pictures. If she does this without written consent from you then you can in all intensive purposes turn around and sue her. <br>  <br>  Below is a link to a release for that you can very easily copy into or re-type in a word document and tailor it to your needs. Once you have done that review it with your photographer and see if she would like any other clauses added. If you both agree on the added clauses ect. then complete it, sign it and the job can proceed. If you have any other questions please do not hesitate to email me.<br>  <br>  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...<br>  Ok here is what you may be looking for....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.businessownersideacafe.com/bizforms/ownimage2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.businessownersideacafe.com/bi...</a><br>  <br>  I will email this to you as well|`|5ecT7kEJaa	Andy W has it right. <br>  <br>  I would add the following. <br>  <br>  The photographer owns the Copyright and can release your images for printing by way of a licence to print for personal use only.  <br>  <br>  The photographer should also have obtained signed model releases for you and your spouse in order to use your likeness for (the photographers) commercial activities. <br>  <br>  So perhaps you could swop paper...!!  Permission to print further copies for your permission on a model release form.  <br>  <br>  WalMart and other labs are protecting themselves from being sued - thats all.  Many people do not understand that they do not "own" the photos.  They merely lease the right to use them.   Just like you all don't "own" the software you use on your computer.  You bought a licence to use it (remember the EULA!), nothing else, not the code and certainly not the copyright. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|e80d865060201c6543892c88a41bba3caa	You don't need to send anything to your photographer.<br>  They need to give you permission (a license) to print the shots.<br>  Call them and they should send you permission to print what you need.<br>  <br>  <br>  Spadafora74 - for the person to be allowed to print photos from the cd which the photographer supplied then the PHOTOGRAPHER has to grant a license for the person to be legally allowed to print them.<br>  The copyright belongs to the photographer and they and only they control the printing.<br>  Yes people can and do just go along and print or copy existing photographs however this is illegal and when done to my shots and I find out then they find themselves in court.<br>  No license from the PHOTOGRAPHER then no prints.|`|U3ApaKhqaa	If you think that you can just send a model release to the photographer and get print rights, you're wrong.<br>  <br>  Every pro photographer has releases and they are usually incorporated into the contract.  It sounds like what you contracted for was a CD, which you have, and no prints.  That's the result of the decision you made at the time.  If you want prints you can order them.  If you want unlimited rights to the images, you can negotiate how much that will cost with the photographer, pay them and get the files and copyrights.<br>  <br>  You got what you paid for.  If you want more, pay more.  Simple.<br>  <br>  Vance<br>  <br>  Edit:  A fuller explanation would have been better in the beginning.  I'm not a lawyer, but this is modified from my contracts langauge, which was setup by a lawyer.<br>  <br>  "This agreement is entered into between __________________________, hereinafter Photographer, and __________________________ and _________________________, herein after customer.<br>  <br>  In acknowledgement of payment in full for photography services performed on (insert date/dates) in the amount of ___________, the Photographer hereby grants to the Customer unlimited reproduction rights to the photographs for personal (non-commercial) use . The Photographer also acknowledges that the Customer owns the copyright of images commissioned for domestic use (for example, family portraits, wedding photos etc). The Photographer claims a "right of restraint" to prohibit the use of images commissioned for domestic use being used for commercial purposes without prior written agreement. Where images are commissioned for commercial use, the Customer acknowledges that the copyright is owned by the Photographer and subsequent use will be as agreed. Requests for commercial use of photographs are to be submitted for approval. An additional fee may be payable.<br>  <br>  Photographer reserves the right to prohibit the copying of a cd/dvd containing the photographs where the cd/dvd contains a presentation produced by Photographer.<br>  <br>  The Customer hereby indemnifies the Photographer against any claims and damages, including reasonable legal fees, arising from the Customer's use of the photographs and the Photographer's use of any material under instruction from the Customer. <br>  <br>  The Customer hereby grants to the Photographer the right to use any image taken as a result of this agreement for display in the Photographer's portfolio, exhibitions, competitions and other promotions of the Photographer's work. The Photographer agrees that he will act on a reasonable written request from the Customer that particular photographs not be used for these purposes. Other than for these purposes, the Photographer agrees that no commercial or product promotion use will be made of the photographs unless agreed to in writing by the Client and/or the person(s) indentifiable in the photograph(s)."<br>  <br>  All parties date and sign.|`|OZOv3dvLaa	If you have the cd, you can obviously print the images for your own personal use. That should have been part of your signed contractual agreement...<br>  <br>  If your looking to use these images for monetary gain, or commercial purposes, you need to contact the photographer and get further copy release permissions. THE PHOTOGRAPHER OWNS THE RIGHTS.|`|F1xgmt7oaa	why does this sound so dodgy?<br>  <br>  releases for wedding shots? your wedding photographer should be giving them to you not the other way around........<br>  <br>  dont tell me you hired a cowboy to shoot your wedding?|`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	The photographer provides that and it should have been clear whether or not it was included with the CD.  It was included with ours and is actually on the CD itself.  But do keep in mind that you do pay for the release.  If it was not included in the price already, the photographer can and probably will charge for it.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	That depends on what you want, and where you live.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for her to sign over the copyright in its entirety that's one form.  And you may actually already have the copyright per a verbal agreement with a small photographer who maybe doesn't understand that you need it on paper.<br>  <br>  Or you could be just wanting permission to run a certain number of prints, etc.<br>  <br>  At the risk of recommending more illegal activity =)) I would drop by your local library and check out some books on running a photography business and they should have some blanks you could photocopy.  Or at least you will have a better grasp of what form you are looking for

fa70fc6c0ebd4df17b301a1c34d3c0b0aa	Both cameras are going to take excellent pictures. The 50D is the newest model. The 50D is claiming to have upgraded the noise reduction from the 40D in the higher ISO's so that would be a plus.<br>  <br>  The true picture quality comes from you the photographer. Yes the 50D is a 15MP body and the 40D is a 10 MP and this one has this and that one has this but it all comes down to how you use it.<br>  <br>  I currently shoot a 30D and if I were to upgrade to one of the two you list here I would probably buy the 50D. BUT, if I were going out to buy two new cameras and were trying to decide to buy two 50D's or two 40D's i would forgo both and buy the 5D Mark II. But I suspect you want 2 cameras with different lens' for whatever it is your shooting.... So, I say you can't go wrong with either purchase truly and I suspect your shooting sports (hence the 2nd body) so go with the advanced noise reduction and buy the 50D.....<br>  <br>  My two cents worth|`|Efd1G2loaa	That really depends on the photographer.

8asG4WCwaa	You do not need to register the copyright.  Reputable agents, editors, and publishers will not steal it.<br>  <br>  If you register it now, and then have to make editorial changes to make the work more marketable (happens even to good authors), it has to be registered a second time, so the money is wasted on the first one.<br>  <br>  You only need to register a copyright when there is a need to do so (like when getting published, and the publisher will do this for you, and in your name).  In the very rare event that your work is stolen, you have a grace period in which to register in order to file suit.<br>  <br>  Mailing a copy to yourself (known as a poor man's copyright) is a myth.  It does not register a copyright and does not even prove you wrote it.<br>  <br>  When sending manuscripts to agents or publishers, you want to appear as professional as possible.  Having a copyright on a work has two big problems<br>  1 - it is the mark of an amatuer, and from experience, many agents and publishers know that amatuers are often difficult to work with because the either believe their work is so brilliant it doesn't need to be changed, or they know so little about publishing they complicate the process of contracts, proof reading, marketing, etc. <br>  2 - a work with a copyright has a date on it.  Even good books sometimes take years to sell when the markets are not open.  You handicap the manuscript with that date because it can say "my work wasn't good enough six years ago and it probably isn't good enough now, either".  A busy agent or editor might not even read it.|`|nE5eqyWeaa	You own the copyright now.|`|BJhZqF98aa	It does lock the book but not from you because it's your material.

You do your job: write the book; rewrite the book; make it the best you can. Leave the rest to your agent, editor, and publisher.

It would have been impossible to transport that many people to the mainland, and the Hawaiian economy would have collapsed without Japanese American workers. "<br>  <br>  -from the book Japanese American Internment Camps by Gail Sakurai, 2002<br>  <br>  "Ironically, the territory with the largest Japanese population saw the least discrimination. More than one third of all residents of Hawaii had some Japanese ancestry. Japanese labor was considered vital to the civilian and military economics of the Hawaiian Islands. Besides, the views of Delos Emmons, military commander of Hawaii, were the opposite of those of General DeWitt."<br>  <br>  -from the book Japanese-American internment in American History, 1996.<br>  <br>  As noted in some of the other reviews, there were a very small number of people arrested and detained in Hawaii and a small number that voluntarily went to the mainland camps, but primarily so they could find relatives. There was not a single act of sabotage in Hawaii by the Japanese Americans during the entire war.<br>  <br>  In addition, since there were so many people of Japanese ancestry already living in Hawaii, about a third of the population, racism was not at all the kind of problem it was on the west coast."

If it's a Gilbert and Sullivan piece you'd want to pick something more operatic, than if you're doing High School Musical.    Pick some kind of song in the style of the music for the show. If you can't do that for whatever reason, choose a humorous song -- sing Weird Al or some bizarrely folksy song like Happy Birthday.

Son of Kim Il Sung, took over for father (in '94 I believe). Continued dictatorship and cult of personality.    Other than that, not really anyone notable. Some of Kim's sons, some generals, but no one anyone not studying the country in depth would or should know about.|`|O7w6XGqPaa	North Korea does not really have citizens, it has rulers and subjects, slaves really treated more like domesticated animals than people.

AA12339318	It's less a matter of "delicacy" and more a matter of knowing how to juggle.  It all becomes much easier, like a  second nature, after hours of practice.    I now shoot digital, and use the "auto" feature a lot more than I'm comfortable admitting, but, when I used to shoot film in the field, I could walk around a location with a couple of "default" setting in my mind.  Outdoors, using ISO, (ASA at the time) was a "no brainer" 100.  Shutter speed was often a matter of subject, or a compromise.  Once I had the speed set, I clicked the f-stop to the appropriate setting for direct sunlight and then wandered around looking for suitible shots with my hand on the apreture ring..  Entering areas of shade, my hand I "automaticlly" clicked a wider setting, going back into sunlight, without thinking, I clicked back.  Facing a subject with heavy glare, like a body of water, I clicked a smaller opening.  These moves were done with little thought, so, when the moment came for a quick shot, the camera came up to my eyes, I gave a quick twist of the focus ring and "click."    Of course, not every shot was a "keeper," but, with practice, I improved my odds tremedously.    When I had the luxury of setting up a shot, then I made carful, deliberate decisions, based on many hours of previous practice.  I only rarely took the light meter out of my bag.  In general, out in the field, I only tended to use it at twilight hours or in deep shaded areas, like in dense woods, or among tall buildings or deep canyons.    But I only got to that point of expertise because of the many, many rolls of films with a LOW yield of usable shots and the copius notes I took when I first began using a camera more complex than the Kodak Instamatic, point and shoots.  After a session in the darkroom and after critique and comparing shots with my notes, each subsequent shooting session yielded a greater percentage of "good" frames.    Even then, I never stopped "bracketing" important shots.  I still, to this day, take that "one more, for insurance" shot.    Maybe it's a personal style.  It's not a delicate balance.  Or even a juggling act.  For me, it's more like a shotgun with a bigger bore.|`|C77c0OE2aa	Yeah, that's the golden triangle of exposure.    steve|`|xcw4EBalaa	Well said.

If you start feeding your cute kitten this you will see a huge and great change in its actions in a positive way and a better and shiny coat. Don't buy your kitten/cat feed from grocery stores brand food because they are mainly stuffed with ingredients that may be harmful to your cat/kitten.

9WIbZUH0aa	Very very good plot,(so far, i don't know what you have in mind for the big scheme of things.  It would be nice to include a  little inkling a little earlier on, but if you do it in the next 100 words it'll flow nicely) but you need less purple prose.  Don't describe your character's eye color in the very beginning, because when you are groggy you do not think about what color your eyes are.  You could have another character mention them later or perhaps have her look into a mirror.  Also, you have a few run-ons, and if you shorten some of your paragraphs it will read faster and create more suspense.  Also, you could replace some of the more important but boring words with more interesting words, and some of the less important huge words with less interesting words, because they don't matter as much.  For suspense at the end, try and use potent verbs and nouns that crack, such as plunder, grab,  lamp, and book.  take out the sky bit.  In the beginning, use more potent verbs to speed up the action.  Describe action and dialogue more, everything else less.  Scenery can come later, once you've grabbed the reader, after the page or two, or after the first 1,000 words and the first bit of action have taken place.  Take out as much of the main pov character's thought as you can with the story still making sense, because it slows the story.  You can add more thought towards the end about the car, because it creates suspense.  Only put in a great amount of thought when you need suspense or need the character to reflect on high action that has just taken place, sort of as a cool down for the reader.  If you need any more help, feel free to message me. I can send you a lot of writing tools that my friend and I have worked to put together.  :D    Oh, by the way, purple prose = unnecessary detail that sound nice but just slow the story and don't add anything.  Amateur writers are guilty of this, but pros are sometimes too.  It sounds nice to the author and they get attached to it, thinking it beautiful (usually), but to the reader it feels a little hokey to read.|`|AHuBqplbaa	I think the only real weakness is the unnecessary detail.    "bed with blurry, exhausted, blue eyes I just prayed that I was. "    This seems like an unnecessary time to tell us the eyes are blue, if it even matters at all.  I would also change or remove the word 'exhausted' - eyes get exausted from overuse, like reading too much, not from sleep.    "I rolled over on my right side and buried myself under a large blanket,"  Who cares which side you rolled onto?    Try to limit the details to what is important and it will be easier and smoother to read.|`|PqNIUhrXaa	I like it.  The story pulls me in.  I would totally read it if you published it.   Perhaps you should have more of a plot. I don't enjoy books with not much plot. That's just me though.   You're writing so far is good.

HJaVcUGwaa	The actual percentage was 40% women and children.  The ratio of civilian deaths in this war (Palestinians : Israelis) was (400 : 1).    This is a more detailed tally of casualties:    Israelis: 13 killed (20% civilian, 80% military)    Palestinians:1330 (80% civilian, 10% policemen, 10% Palestinian resistance)  40% of the dead were women and children    Ratio of military deaths (Israel : Palestine): 1 : 13    Ratio of non-military* deaths (Israel : Palestine): 1 : 400    *Policemen are considered non-military.    Total numbers are from official medical sources on both sides.  Israeli military losses per Israeli army  Hamas losses per Hamas    Both Israel and Hamas claim they have killed more of the other. Israel claims they have killed several hundred Hamas (counting the policemen as Hamas fighters), while Hamas claims killing 80 Israeli soldiers.|`|PG7WfGpHaa	They cluster together in United Nations schools and things, which makes them an easier target.|`|xQwU590Laa	I have some doubts on that figure of 60 percent.

eFjy1f2paa	Who's controlling the kiss?  Is He kissing You or are You kissing Him?    If he's doing the kissing, then it might be fairly easy, he leads, you follow. Close your eyes and let him do all the work.    If you're being agressive in the scene its going to be more difficult.  Plan it out, coreograph it like you would any other stage movement - plan on where your hands are going to be, how your head will be tilted and so on.  It then becomes a mechanical action, rather than an emotional moment (you can let a little emotion in as you go on - thats the acting part).     If you a really worried about your folks - turn away from the audiance when you kiss (if your director will let you) and you can always tell them it was kissing on the cheek |`|MHFuJGdGaa	Have you ever had a band-aid pulled off?

As far as your parents watching? Ouch, that could be tough. Just try to not let it mean anything.|`|8IZVPSPJaa	Out of curiosity, what's the play?  So, don't be to eager or stalkerish with the guy.  Try to be chill and laid back with him.  If you guys are working a scene together just try to talk to him.  Since you guys are in a play together, you have a common interest.  Use this as a icebreaker.  As for your parents, tell them it was fake.  Just be like "o he put his hands over my mouth and kissed hi hand" or something like that.    If you are not even remotely attracted to the guy treat it like work.  If you are pretend that this is your first kiss together.  Of course, it all depends on the scene, staging, who's kissing who, etc.  Good luck!  If they casted you in this role, they knew you could handle this scene.

RHAK3PUNaa	haha there are none go to the house of blues when a fun band is playing and dance there
uqb7dkBbaa	They left so quickly and the city was buried so quickly that when the houses are dug up the colours are exactly as they were during the time of the ancient Romans and nothing was destroyed or stolen. This is like a time capsule 2000 years old.
i93KqZ3Kaa	The coat hanger monologue from Your a Good Man Charlie Brown!! I am using it for an audition for Into the Woods fr Little Red. It's Sally Brown's monologue, and if performed right, very funny. She's complaining to her teacher about the grade on her project.\    Her is a link to it.  http://www.stageagent.com/Shows/Monologu...  Hope i helped!!|`|MHFuJGdGaa	For future reference I would recommend reading the entire play before you so choose to do a monologue from it, so that you can understand he context of the character, etc.      Depending on how liberal the casting directors/ teachers at your school are I would look into Ted Tally's "Hooters."

KCpGsN2faa	He was able to rhyme without sounding like a 3 year old. All of his poems have an amzing rhythm, try reading "The Bells" out loud, its amazing. Also, if you know anything about his personal history, you can understand his poetry soooo much better. Like "The Raven" was written because of his wife's death. He had a specific way of writing too, I used to have a handout of a paper he had actually written explaining how he writes, everything had a purpose  in his writings. Plus, his stuff was so shocking back then, cuz it was so morbid, twisted, it was just amazing.|`|LBlSeLC0aa	He had balls to write the type of stuff that he did when he did it.  His poems were sick, sadistic, and eye opening for the people in a time when that just wasnt something people did.

mKOxr4Lwaa	the Germans were planning world invasion years ahead.<br>  <br>  just one example of how much planning they put into it.<br>  they had made visits to museums all over the world making a list of things they wanted to steal.<br>  <br>  If Hitler had not been such a lunatic Germany might have won, they had the manpower and the factories and support ready years ahead of the US.|`|7sqpiGgoaa	he played the 'christians are an intolerant and ignorant bunch so i'll use their natural fear and hate of the jews to my advantage' card<br>  <br>  religion is lovely|`|k2NRCYo9aa	The true answer is that Germany was woefully unprepared for World War II.  Hitler kept getting away with annexations of Austria and Czechslovakia, that he thought that Britain and France would look the other way when he invaded Poland.  He was not prepared to start a war against Britain and France in 1938.  His admirals and generals did not think Germany would be ready for a major conflict until 1947.  By then, Raeder would have had his capital ships, Donitz would have had enough U-boats to keep 300 in operation at all times needed to cripple British trade (Germany rarely had over 40 at one time and 100 total throughout the war), the Luftwaffe would have had a long range bomber built (as the Stutkas were only dive bombers and not good for long range missions), and they would have been able to start a war with high quality tanks (German tanks at the beginning of the war were horrible, and one of the main advantages of annexing Czechslovakia was procuring their high quality tanks).   Had he not got greedy by invading Poland and waited until he was ready, he would have also had the a-bomb, jet-fighters, and a large cache of supersonic guided missiles (considering what Werner von Braun did in the United States after the war, think of what more in Germany he could have accomplished.  What would a V-3 or V-4 missile have been like?)  <br>  <br>  The world is very lucky that Germany was not prepared for the war.  Had they waited until 1947, the outcome would have been much different.
DIlNnjf8aa	That's where Hitler was from.<br>  <br>  "Adolf Hitler was born at the Gasthof zum Pommer, an inn in Braunau am Inn, Austria-Hungary, on 20 April 1889"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitle...</a>|`|XCn2dK1laa	While the other answers are right, I must stress that Hitler believed that Germany should become an empire and add any German speaking country to it,which is why it was important for him to conquer Austria|`|aqeWwA71aa	Austria was a large part of the power that Germany needed to go to war.  Hitler didn't 'conquer' it as much as just walk in and dare anybody to make trouble.  It worked - and Hitler had Austria!  It surprised even him a great deal.<br>  <br>  The real secret reason perhaps is because Hitler had grown up there, of course, and he was taking back his own homeland when he went into Austria.  He had real strong emotional ties to the place.|`|5m4yaEJyaa	Couple of Reasons<br>  1) Hitler was born in Austria<br>  2) Austria is ethnically German (like Germany)<br>  3) By occupying Austria it would provide a land connection between Germany and Italy (Axis Powers)<br>  Hope this helps|`|b2TsoViMaa	hitler wanted to attain more land for his "living room" for germany he also needed resources and a pathway for italy
AHJQfHx9aa	American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis is absolutely perfect for you.  Patrick Bateman makes so much money that he can not only buy anything he wants, but he can do whatever he wants.  It's the perfect sellyoursoultobecomeaconsumerpawn tone.  Will work great for your essay.
7KcVSB3Uaa	Yep to the other answers, except that many older works are no longer under copyright, and are free to use. You must not claim them as your own (claim that you wrote it yourself), but you can reproduce them. For instance, The Iliad is not under copyright, and none of Homer's ancestors are going to be suing you for reading it online!|`|capqMpiCaa	cause if everyone read it online instead of buying it, then the author would make no money and would be unable to publish anymore books, duh. Your basically stealing from the author|`|FNwYzjogaa	If the author posts it online for people to read then it's legal. However, if a person who is not the author posts the book online then reading the book is illegal. It's violates the copyrights of the author. You aren't paying to read the book, you're stealing it.|`|w3yrnDEiaa	You didn't pay for it and there for are stealing it. Since royalties aren't being paid to the author and publisher they aren't making money.|`|fLUJvOucaa	A book is illegal because you didn't pay for it... authors don't write books for free its like stealing music same idea and same penalties|`|qzkWahFeaa	You are not paying to read it.|`|IRjm8Artaa	Because it's protected by copyright; everything you type, the second it leaves your fingers, it protected automatically by copyright. The author owns all rights, and unless they choose to post it for free somewhere, they reserve the sole right on where they want it. If a publisher is currently printing it, they obviously don't want you to read it for free.|`|IvfAI1S2aa	Let's put this in laymen terms: you're not giving them the money, credit and "gratitude" they deserve.<br>  <br>  It's illegal due due to the fact that you're not giving the writers the things that they are, by entertaining you with their words and putting visualizations of characters and settings into your mind, entitled to. Also, book sales would not be up and they would not get credit for all of the books sold. They also few this as reader gratitude. <br>  <br>  If it were you, wouldn't you rather people pay to do it? Don't be a hypocrite and say no, because this would be your only means of making money.<br>  <br>  Also, the copyright is infringed upon by doing this. Unless, of course as the other person mentioned, it is no longer under copyright. Then you may do as you please by putting it online, as long as you do not claim it to be your own work of literature.|`|T7Mq6ZN8aa	Books are usually copyrighted - books have rules. In this case, books cannot be shown on the internet as the copyright forbids it! But sometimes books are not copyrighted against this or are allowed to be viewed on the internet by the author and are allowed to be shown.|`|ADU4iyZDaa	google "copyright book laws"
