Over the past week, I've been putting them up in rollers every night, and in the morning they would be super curly! They would wilt to some degree by the end of the day (without hairspray) but it would take quite a while for the curls to fall out completely.

The hair around the nape of my neck won't really curl well at all and the curls start to come out within like, an hour. The curls are uneven, some chunks of hair don't curl at all and look really funky.      WHY IS THIS?? How can I get it back to the way it was earlier this week?

20090225113015AAoGfLi	Beauty & Style;Hair	Do you like Anakin Skywalker's Hairstyle (from episode 3)?	I want my hair to look like Anakin's (from episode 3). No I'm not a creepy Anakin fanboy. We just have similar hair.        So I wanted to ask what you think of it.  Do you think it looks too much like a mullet?  I don't think so but I guess I wouldn't really know.       Now, my hair is styled like it already, but I can't quite get it right. I found pictures of Anakin on the internet. Here's a jpeg of them:       http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j131/T...       See, the one on the bottom is how my hair looks now. See it? It's just a little uglier than the pictures on the top. I want my hair to look more like the two on the top.        I don't know if it's just the lighting or the angle, but the two on top look better. I think it's the texture. How can I make my hair a little less flat to my head like that? It curls out at the bottom but the top is flat so it looks bell-shaped. Is there some sort of product I can get or something I can do to make it puff our more on top?      Right now I use "Garnier fructuse surf hair" to give it a bit of texture, and it does make it less flat to my head, but after a while it starts looking bad.

I WILL STILL USE SOAP AND I AM NOT PLANNING ON USING IT TO CLEAN MYSELF, I WOULD ONLY USE IT FOR SMELL. th only thing i hate about body wash is you can't really smell it and it dosent stay on long. and also don't say i shouldnt use it because it cost alot because my parents have a cabinet full of body lotions and my parents have the $$$ in the bank. So anyway's would you recomend it and should i try it out?

20090226153820AAsI0gO	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Could you please make me an outfit?	Hello there! I'd like to ask a favor to the Yahoo! Answers community: could you please make me an outfit? Just for everyday wear. Here is extra info:       I'm in 6th grade    I love skinny jeans, and converse    I would like something seasonable, but something to prepare for the spring would also be nice    I have sort of a hip, preppy, style.     I like the following stores:   Abercrombie   Aeropostale   American Eagle   Pink by Victoria's Secret   Bloomingdales   Forever 21   Neiman Marcus   Nordstrom    I like all colors, especially bold ones.     I prefer solids to patterns; i've heard solids make you look slimmer    I have brown eyes and dark dark dark brown hair; i guess you could call it almost black.       And ya. Thank you so much!   P.S. Polyvore is recommended

20090226094657AAMpHDy	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Has any one seen first hand the results of a tattoo on some one who takes prescription blood thinners?	My husband takes prescription blood thinners & has an artificial heart valve...and he badly wants a tattoo.  Of course the dr. advises against it because he risks getting infection on his valve, which is preventable by taking an antibiotic such as amoxicillin.  The risk is no worse than that of having his teeth cleaned, he just has to take the antibiotic an half hour prior to the procedure.   However, our concern is how well the ink will absorb in to the skin.  So my question is has any one seen or done this first hand?  And if so, what were the results of the quality of the tattoo?  I would appreciate answers from people who have done or received tattoos such as this.
