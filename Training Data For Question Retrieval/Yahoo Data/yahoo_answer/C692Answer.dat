I know you may not be able to put 1 above the other, but if you keep sitting on it like this they'll both find someone else or get tired of waiting. What I started to do if I got in this situation & still do presently is I write down all of the good & bad qualities I can think of from each woman/girl. & make my choice on paper.

YPsBEwlDaa	I wouldn't think twice! I would EXPOSE & PLUS SOME!!!|`|fSO7kfdGaa	I wouldn't spread it around town or anything because your have more class than that and don't want to act in a state of emotions that you might later regret. Remember your not the bad guy here so don't give anyone reason to think you are. I would let the cheaters know that you know the true and tell them they need to come clean with the unknowing husband because he deserves to know the truth.  After all were all suppose to be grown ups here.|`|eeGN977eaa	I thought I would until it happened, which was last week. I confronted 'the other woman' but I didn't tell her husband. I almost did but then I thought of how I would have reacted had he found out first and told me. I think I wouldn't have believed him. It was a difficult situation but that is what I decided.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	Only if it were someone I knew who had betrayed me as equally as my spouse had.  As long as she had no loyalty to me the betrayal is all his and nothing really to do with her.  If I found out she was married, though I may consider telling her significant other, because I'd hope that someone else would do me the same courtesy.|`|5OXtsCv1aa	Expose your spouse - who betrayed you, who promised not to forsake you for anyone else before God! <br>  <br>  Don't blame the Other Person - the same lying cheating spouse who lied and cheated on you "probably" lied to them, Right?|`|a73a11fa642e15167d49c1ea43b54b8caa	Absolutely!|`|TUNvbXbgaa	YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  if she is messing with my husband I will let her husband know what is is doing.|`|oqQdutsfaa	H*ll to da yes! And make them real shame in the process!|`|mRffo5G8aa	I am not certain what you meant?  If you knew your own husband cheated on you wouldn't that be enough?  Why would you have to know the woman?  One should also explore what the cause was that made the husband or wife lose interest in the relationship to the point of seeking outside attention.  Knowing the person who is the other in the situation is of little consequence.  Finding out what the problem in your relationship that caused the cheating is most important...and fixing it if that is what you want.  Otherwise...if you are not interested in saving the relationship...move on.|`|HlR7egIeaa	I kind of agree with white chocolate! Depends on what circumstances. If the "other person" knew the cheating spouse was married, then yeah. But if "the other person" didnt then they are prob just as hurt as the spouse being cheated on! I once had a guy tell me he was divorced when he wasn't. Come to find out he was still married with two kids at home... yikes!!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever it is you're trying to figure out!|`|iHKAAh7aaa	No matter how you slice it adultery is wrong, and if your the one that is hurt, I bet someone else on the other end will be hurting also. Be careful not to get yourself involved in a conflict, but I think you should address this issue to get it out of your mind.|`|F6dApOJtaa	Yes I would. Why would I have to worry about what people might think about them if they didn't care about how I would feel when they cheated with my gf/spouse.|`|zmkflyoWaa	HELL YES.|`|TSmego9vaa	lol yea. if she or he was with him. I would show them as well.|`|P1Ym7OXdaa	i would sue both their asses|`|dItZAwI2aa	i did know who both my ex wives had sex with while we were married. i didn't confront their "lay" partners. i just divorced both. while yes the other party is at fault, its the spouse that cheated thats 100% responsible for allowing it to happen and following thru with it...the people they cheated with were just stupid, unmoral, unethical willing participants.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	I would talk to her husband and let him know that she was cheating with my husband and that my reason for telling him was because I would assume he wanted to know as I was in the same position as he, and would want him to do the same if the situation was reversed. <br>  <br>  I would not talk to her circle of friends though. It's none of their business and I wouldn't make it their business. For one thing, it would be wrong for any of them to treat the cheating woman differently than they ever did because she didn't actually do anything to them and her cheating character only reflects the relationship or lack of relationship with her husband. More importantly, I wouldn't want anybody to see me as the bitter wife who is just tryna cause problems for this woman because my husband cheated with her. I wouldn't want the reputation of someone who was so immature they resorted to playing the "get back" game. I'd rather people see me pick myself up, say **** him regarding my husband and the woman he cheated with, and move on with my life. I don't wanna be viewed as the victim where people are "awww.. you poor thing. " I wouldn't need sympathy in that situation, I'd rather have empowerment.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	In the case of my husband cheating, we lived in a small town.  Once I found out and we separated, everything just seemed to hit the fan at once.  It just came out, her husband knew by the time I did.  We both separated.  He and she divorced, I took my husband back only for him to do it again a few years later.  This time we lived in a bigger town and she wasn't married but was a well known CPA in the area.  Since she helped my husband hide some of our assets there by cheating me out of them I told everyone who would listen and some who didn't.  I do not feel bad about putting a stain on her reputation.  She asked for it.  She knew my husband was married and set out to get him. My best revenge however, was letting her have him.<br>  Red|`|uBssj3Znaa	no, as it would be just as much my husband's fault as it would be her's. Plus, I wouldn't be surprised if her friends already knew ...|`|CuGAYMlbaa	this will not change that fact that they cheated just leave and start over|`|FtyLwqR5aa	You bet I would and have.
oYDhOmkyaa	From my experience, they usually come back.<br>  <br>  It may take them awhile, but they do.  I have found that it isn't really the same when they do come back, and my relationships ended within a month after every time we got back together.<br>  <br>  The best thing for you to do is show her that you are happy without her, and be with other people.  <br>  <br>  Absence makes the heart grow fonder.<br>  And good luck bro.
AdIrjmV7aa	First of all you are too yound to think that you are in love.  At your ages interests change almost daily. Chances are that what you consider "spark" is now gone.|`|ywRPvKyfaa	Be spontaneous with him for example when he is not expecting it give him a kiss, do something sweet for example what is favourite sweets buy him some that won't cost very much and it is nothing big but it just shows that you are thinking about him.  Do you play fight with him or do silly things with him.  Give him cuddles if he looks like he needs one i'm sure you two will be fine.|`|ug0FnKgeaa	Tickle his butthole and he will love you forever.|`|rro0bcOaaa	whats wrong with 24/7 ridin|`|wa18Uyeuaa	Try to regain that spark. Remember what you two did when you were a "new couple". Do "new couple" things, like just watching the sunset, movies or the stars together. Walk in the woods, to the park, to WalMart to just goof off and be like little five year olds. It's hard to say what you could do together because I'm not sure where you live, so I'm giving you suggestions for country living. If you live in a city, try walking blocks. Like hold hands, flirt, act like he's the cute guy you've been eying from across the room and you're all alone. Just have fun with yourselves though. Don't think bad. Good luck.
kfLH50ECaa	ya just send him a message and let him, know why you acted the way  you did that your dad was out side that you did want to ride in his mustang but that your dad was waiting for you that maybe you can take a rain check with him :)<br>  <br>  <br>  kassie|`|MRwR6eHYaa	i don't think you should explain it to him and make it be a bigger deal than it really is, but you definitely should message him. it will show him that you're still interested, and you weren't really rejecting him.|`|oFUqegjfaa	Send him a message.  Tell him "thanks again for the ride offer but my dad was already on the way". Ask if he wants to hang out at the coffee house. Try not to be so blinded by the fact that he is a junior with a mustang. That means absolutely nothing.|`|2S2onP86aa	Haha, awww, that's cute. First, freshman and junior, totally not a big age difference. It's nothing. I'm a sophmore dating a junior. So whatever. <br>  <br>  And yes, send him a message and explain to him. Tell him you didn't have a chace to tell him, he just ran away. Hehe.<br>  <br>  Good luck sugar, keep your head up. ?|`|AFx0PCGvaa	Don't go off explaining yourself..because what if he didn't think that? now you look like a ******' loser. Just message him and be like, hey nice running into you whatsup yadda yada. It'll let him know you're into him.|`|5hlJwDBoaa	yeah just say thanks for the offer and start up a convo.|`|QODJNf1oaa	Well, it is definitely a good sign that he asked you to hang out - it is clear that he's interested in you. I'm sure he would be pumped if you sent him a cute message saying, " thanks for the offer yesterday, but my dad had already left ...kinda wish he hadn't " or... if you don't want to be too blunt - the best way to let someone know your into them is by eye contact, flirting alot & smiling at him.|`|uNynmZxpaa	you should explain it to him b/c it seems rude that a girl turns you down so just tell him that you dad was outside and that you had to ride with him|`|bfOzIY82aa	well its not anybody Else's decision to make you do what ever your heart tells you to.

I don't think you have anything to worry about.|`|76nTvO4iaa	I think it would be a lovely place.<br>  <br>  If your guests' needs are taken care as far as food, drink and a chair to sit in, they won't care that the venue is located at a fairground.|`|4POGapREaa	Gorgeous!  Not tacky at all.  Hey, they obviously do a lot of weddings so people must like it or they'd be out of business.  Great job.

EdidZdtlaa	he might just like flirting with you but i dont think you should take it seriously just yet. wait and see if he breaks up with his girlfriend because you dont wanna get into a big mess. just wait it out and see what happens.|`|cMyPQ90vaa	well if he already has a girlfriend than just stay away from him not only is he taken but that will just bring trouble to you so my opinion just stay far away from guys that are already taken because you wouldn't like it if you was in a relationship and someone took your man away from you.

Over all I cannot say I love each for different reasons...  hmmm|`|lhoN1Uimaa	Flirting is nice.  <br>  <br>  It alleviates some of the pressure and tension that can be there if two people are attracted to each other.<br>  <br>  Watch out though.  Don't flirt with anyone that you would not want attention from.  Alot of guys will take flirting as you wanting to have a relationship with them.|`|P7HdSzhKaa	it is like asking if someone likes the color yellow or the color blue?<br>  <br>  there will always be someone who likes one or the other, neither, or both (green).<br>  <br>  i like them to be forward but shy which is a mixture (green).<br>  <br>  women can act flirty just to be a flirt. some are shy because of low confidence.<br>  <br>  but a mixure is when they flirt but ease shyness into it too.<br>  <br>  sort of a mystery.<br>  <br>  8^)|`|6CPFRnGraa	Personally, I don't mind either way. The only thing that I don't like about flirting girls is that I can never tell if they just like to flirt or if they actually like me. I don't have this problem now, but when I did, it drove me up the wall, lol. I think shy, quiet girls are cute. I'm shy myself.|`|NJrkgBaWaa	If you get a real flirty girl it shows there interested and can have a good time, but on the other hand can hook up with anyone and she isnt guranteed yours... Sweet and Shy is the way I like them because obv there sweet and aren;t big mouthed and repsectful...

AnW3dzQfaa	I would be upset.  It's your life not hers.  All that matters is if you are happy and he treats you good.  But, just like you said, your mother is very religious so everything you do probaly upsets her.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	Your Mom is just concerned with you and wants the best for you. It is ok to at least listen to her. Believe me I am 40 and my Mom is still right with things in my life. But no you don't have to do anything about what you are doing. Give her the benefit and tell her you appreciate her advise but you are doing your own thing. We all have to give our parents respect no matter what it is or how old we are.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	no not at all but do remember she is your mom and is worried about you she loves you and may or may not say things that hurt your feelings but don't let that come between you both. i am sure he may be a nice guy but it will take your mom a little while to warm up to him so relax and let this play out|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	she has the right to tell you her concerns and you owe her the respect to listen to what she says, but you are a grown woman and you don't have to take her advice or suggestions as an order.<br>  <br>  I don't understand why you are angry with her and why you keep fighting with her.  Neither one of you is going to change so to continue arguing in an attempt to get the other one to see your side is a waste of time.  It takes two people to argue.  You can always say, "Mom, I'm not discussing this with you.  Talk to you another time."  and then hang up.  Or if you are with her in person you can leave.  Anger in this case is a wasted emotion.<br>  <br>  and yes, I do believe you're 28 and you are still fighting with mom over how to live your life because I know 27 to about 28 is when most people finally realize that they don't have to live their lives to please their parents.  (some people realize it sooner and some people never realize it.)  <br>  <br>  Mom doesn't approve and she's not going to be happy.  That's her choice.  You've made your choice.  Own it and stop arguing.  All you owe your mom is to listen to her concerns and hear her out fully ONE TIME.  After she's stated her case and you've decided to not do it her way then you change the subject or say good bye when she brings it up after that.  It's a waste of time, energy and emotion to rehash the same arguement over and over and she  can't argue with you if you don't argue back.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	no matter how old u are, your mom will always be your mom, and although u have the final say, u could at least see what she has to say.she just doesn't want u to get hurt. and if your not to blame for his divorce and he didn't leave her for u, then u need to explain this to mom. u are an adult but still your mom's little girl, so at least let her have her say.|`|s7seaaPkaa	she is your mother which means she will always be concerned about you. but alot of mothers dont know when to draw the line.<br>  it is actually not of her buisness what religion you choose to be or if you wanna be with a married man. or if you decide to worship the devil...lol {{not that you will}} its not her say so.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	if you don't want your mums advice .. then don't take it to heart .. but let her be the mum as she dose love you.. all the way .. don't get upset with her .. but be happy that she cares that much about you... i only wish all the best .. to you him and your mum to ..|`|YPsBEwlDaa	Your 28 & living outside of your parent's house. NO your mother doesn't have any business but I believe she is just concern about you! Allow her to say what she is concern about but let her know to that you will make your own choice's!|`|a73a11fa642e15167d49c1ea43b54b8caa	You shouldn't even be asking such a rtdiculous question at 28 years of age.  This is your life.  You answer to no one, but yourself and your God.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Hmm...I don't blame her for being protective.  The guy is on the rebound and just moves in with you like that?  Have you known each other that long?  Are you supporting him financially?  I have a feeling there is more to this than you say...why else would a parent be so concerned?  If she's just out to bash you with religious rhetoric then yes, I do agree that you are an adult and it's none of her business...but again, I just feel like there is more to this story.  <br>  <br>  Angry - maybe - annoyed - yeah, I'd be annoyed...|`|djUMvICoaa	She has the right to be anything she wants as long as it's not directed at you.  She may have well meaning thoughts but if she can't put them out there in an acceptable way then there is a problem.  But you two seem to have an on going feud anyway.  But at 28 you have the right to make your own mistakes.  The only thing about this is that I think where you mom was going with what she wanted was right.  Getting involved with a married man is bad news, the reason, first he's a cheat, why would you want that, the second is that if his wife finds out he has a place to fall into.  Does that mean he really wants you or you are just a stop over, a nice to place to lay over until he gets his sh@t back together.  If he loved you why didn't he leave his wife before?  If he didn't really love her why did he stay for so long?  The right place to flop hadn't shown up yet.  I'm sorry , but I'm acting like a parent now, and I have 2 of my own, and it's hard sometimes to bite my tongue, but I do, unless I feel they are open to what I have to say but I also know that I should give it to them in what I see, not what they have to do.  It makes a lot of difference on how far the conversation will go.   good luck|`|eeGN977eaa	There have been many times that my mom and I have disagreed. But the bottom line is I love my mom very much and I respect her opinion so I hear what she has to say. Most recently I found out my husband cheated on me and as difficult as it is I decided to stay. My mom completely disagreed with this and told me so. I responded by telling her that I understand what she is saying and I hope that she will try to respect my decision because I don't want it or anything to come between us. She said fine I guess we will agree to disagree and we left it at that.|`|9QeV07zJaa	Could be she thinks she is one of your friends and wants to help you think through things by rasing another perspective.<br>  <br>  <br>  Religious or not, dating a man that is still married is very unlikely to end well. She has the right to say anything she want to you. It's up to you to take it or leave it, without getting defensive. <br>  <br>  You have the right to be angry, but why would you want to harbor such negative thoughts about your Mother?  Your MOTHER ! ! ! ...  or anyone else.  Anger has no long term benefit.|`|7BLJ45cVaa	You are a grown up woman. It's probably time that your mom realizes that you are going  to live your own life. If you don't have a problem with your life keep doing what you are doing.|`|HE56Jra6aa	Your mother is your mother.... Right or wrong, She will always be there for you, religious or not. you need to be the bigger and talk to her and get your side to her. She'll always judge, that's what Mothers do the best, besides meddling.|`|W4BsmESnaa	Your mother has every right to tell you how to run your life. She is your mother. But don't forget you have every right to do what you want with your life.|`|AA10204462	WHAT CONTROL YOU MAMA STILL HAS OVER YOU.  Why waste time getting angry about what she thinks.

My mother is very traditional and I am not. My mother doesn't believe in premarital sex, or living together out of wed lock.... etc. So I can relate. The nice thing is though that my mother realizes that my happiness means more to her then her opinion on how things should be done. It is 2009! And in your mother's defense she was raised in a different time then you. I would listen to what your mother has to say and take what advice you want from it and put aside what you don't need. Sometimes I don't think our mothers realize what the dating world is like now days. And that it is easier to make it with 2 incomes than 1 and if you found a man that makes you happy, helps you out, and you love eachother then your mother should be grateful for that.|`|9BsyKN9haa	She is your mom! My mom tells me what to do all the time! Who cares! I just smile and nod. You sounds like a teenager who is going show her mommy and tell her off! Just respectfully disengage from the topic. If she freaks and brings it up just leave or drop it! It is non- of her business but she is worried about you. having your daughter live with a married man would make any mother worried! If you get angry and fight with her you are letting her have control of you. You might say some things you don't mean and over some man! If you love him and your mom keep them separate and DISENGAGE from fights.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	You are 28.  You need to establish boundaries with your mom.  I am sure she is concerned, but she needs to let you go and live your own life.  I can say this, because my son is 29, and my twin girls are 22.  I do not get into their personal business, and because of that, they share their lives with me regularly.  I do have to bite my tongue once in a while :)|`|uBssj3Znaa	You have every right to be angry, but I would take this opportunity to hear your mom out and then correct her on the information she has wrong. I would also remind her that you are an adult who makes your own decisions and are happy with the decisions you have made.

1dOFZC82aa	I think if you want to get her back in your life, then being friends would be a good start.  If she gave you her number, then call her.  But I also want to say that because you have gone through this tough time, and still working through your issues, you may be thinking of her so much because she symbolizes something to you - like joy.  Because who doesn't feel good when someone likes them?  It's natural to think of her fondly. But I wouldn't put all my happiness in her hands.  All I'm saying is that sometimes when you put someone, or even an idea, on a pedestal, the reality of the situation has the potential to be disappointing.  So be friends with her, and see what happens, but continue to work on making your own happiness.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ZVNtxUKTaa	She seems like a nice girl...maybe you could write her a letter explaining everything. True friends don't judge; and will listen to what you have to say. So if she is worth being friends with, I'm sure she'll understand.|`|CPZA5qrGaa	She gave you her number. What more of an "invitation" do you need?<br>  Get on the phone and make that connection.<br>  Due process...is out the window and old hat.<br>  This is a new leaf on life as you know it. Don't f_k it up looking <br>  for excuses. Get balls will you.

Take it from there.|`|EiGc45Zwaa	To be really blunt, you are acting like a coward and making your past an excuse. I know past shaped you but you are 20 now, you do whatever you want and shape yourself. You are not your mom nor your father. You are you, be yourself make your own rules and family values. If you are fun to be around with when you are calm, then try to be more calm. Forget your past, it didnt help you when you had to go through it, neither its helping you in present nor will it help you in future. <br>  As for the girl, if you really like her, then whats the problem? talk to her! Dont make your bad points take over your good ones. talk to her, call her, tell her how you feel and for once just go and do something without thinking abt your painful past.|`|nkpRxWLgaa	You sound like you're working very hard on improving your life.  Bravo!  Keep it up, whether or not you are able to re-establish this friendship, it's a great step forward.  You have idealized this girl highly, though you keep saying you didn't get to know each other very well.  That puts a lot responsibility on her shoulders to make her feel so responsible for your emotions.  I'm not trying to discourage you from trying to contact her.  She sounds like someone who would be a wonderful friend.  At the same time, over time her life has probably had many changes, too, and she may no longer be exactly who she was before.  A card simply expressing to her that her friendship meant a lot to you and impacted your life in a positive way would be nice.  That would open the lines of communication and pave the way to renewing your friendship.  Just don't have too many expectations of her.  Take it easy!|`|ZZkInusMaa	find a family researcher <br>  an get them to find her for you they can get her adress and number everything you just have to find one now ..|`|ZM2UJmLtaa	Yes...Live life to the fullest,and take opportunities as you see them. You have only one life, and what could give it more meaning than to spend your time with the people you love? What could give it more value than showing those people we care so much just how much we love them, if not in actions (for now), then at least in words?<br>  I kinda get where you're coming from, as I have a history quite similar to yours as well...That's why I know, and I feel this way...My friends, whom I consider closer than my family, I cherish with all my life. They have given my life both sorrows, and countless joys. They give my life meaning. And kudos to your journey towards self-improvement. Let me know how it turns out, ok? And whatever happens, congratulations. Self-awareness is the first step towards your betterment. I wish you all the best and may God guide you always.<br>  <br>  (P.S.

It is better to have few real friends than have a lot of fake friends.. Relationship with people takes process for you to determine if they can be your friends.

Also a fit body, like a person that does exercise and takes care of themself. a flat stomach. to be fat for a girl is not a good thing. <br>     1.4) a nice ***: every man likes a nive ***.<br>      1.5) long and skinny legs, that is really nice.<br>      1.6) a nice face, pretty face, nice proportions, nice teeth, ect. <br>  <br>  2) personality :<br>  <br>     2.1) funny<br>     2.2) friendly<br>     2.3) open to new experiences.<br>    2.4)  accepting the man the way he is.<br>    2.5) some level of inteligence is really important. <br>  <br>  <br>  you dont need to have all this qualities, just few of them.

If he says no, then that's it. Move on.|`|ywRPvKyfaa	Be sweet with him and get conversations with him like if you are near him start talking with him and casually ask something like What is your favourite band? then start getting conversations with him the next few times you see him.  If nothing else works then move on.|`|ZDqdYhdGaa	I hate to tell you this, but to be honest, it doesn't sound at all like he feels the same way about you. You two may have hooked up, but he has shown no further interest in you at all, it was a hookup and that's it. Him avoiding you is him not leading you on and trying to let you know that he doesn't have romantic feelings for you. <br>  <br>  Joking around saying "you're a goof ball" is him just being a friend, there is nothing in the comments that makes it seem like he thinks anymore than that. Just because he shows up at a bar after you talk about him it doesn't mean that it is destiny, it was just ironic. <br>  <br>  And just because he wants the same things that you do, it doesn't mean that you two are meant to be together. What you felt when you two hooked up, is clearly not what he felt, sounds like he viewed it as just a hook up. <br>  <br>  Again I am trying to help you out and be honest here, not being mean at all. I know men pretty well and it is pretty clear that he doesn't have an interest in being any more than friends.<br>  <br>  Let go and move on. Find someone who cares about you and who has feelings for you too. Great men are out there, but you aren't going to find them if you are hooked up on a guy who doesn't have an interest to be any more than friends with you.|`|06Hro5okaa	Unfortunately I think he's just into it for fun.

If he can't treat you well in front of his friends he doesn't deserve to be with you.|`|HhHVApzRaa	Hey girl... man if there is anything in life that is difficult- it's LOVE right?! So I can understand why you are confused and nervous about the whole situation. You really liked this guy, slept with him, got attached to him bit then he dated someone else, and then someone ELSE briefly after that, all the while keeping you on the back burner by talking to you now and then, keeping you "warm" so that he'll always have a backup (you.) That scenario in itself would probably make anyone want to scream to you, "THIS GUY IS A JERK! HE'S USING YOU, FORGET HIM!".. But I get it, you really have deep feelings for him, and it's hard to just "walk away." But let me ask you some things..<br>  <br>         1) If you had the ability to just snap your fingers and you could be COMPLETELY over him, would you? Or would you stay in it, pain and all, and just hope that he comes around? If you said yes.. you would take the chance to just snap your fingers and be over him if you could, then that's your heart telling you that he's not the one. And hey, in life.. sometimes we just gotta accept that some people we NEED to move on from and accept that YES, it's going to be hard, but it WILL get better and you deserve to make things better for yourself and your life, am I right? <br>  <br>          2) In your heart of hearts, don't you think you deserve a man who will want to be with you after he sleeps with you? One that will feel so fortunate to have you in his life and won't play games with you? A man who will love you as much as you love him, or even more? Do you really picture your love life panning out like it is now? People fall in love all the time, and often with the wrong person.. but that doesn't mean you have to stay in love or will be in love with them forever, the key here is loving YOURSELF enough to know that you deserve a better love life and the kind of romance you always dreamed of. When you really start to love yourself enough to know that this guy is hurting you more than lifting you up- you should do anything you can do get over him because YOU are too good to be treated this way!<br>  <br>          3) Does he bring more positive into your life or negative? I mean do you spend more time upset over him/acting in ways you later regret than spending happier moments with him? Something tells me that the bad outweighs the good here, but you're allowing the good to outweigh the bad<br>  <br>  <br>        Sweetie, love sucks sometimes. There is a good side and a bad side. And right now, you're in a heartbreaking slump that a lot of people can relate to. But now is the time to dust yourself off, take charge of your life and feelings, and get on the path to getting over him so that you can later find a man who is worthy of your time! This other guy, is not. Seize the day girly, go out and be happy for yourself and forget about the people who are hurting you! God bless and Good luck!
LiZir5Jiaa	ALL other women arent narrow minded! lol...remember, many ppl believe a guy should approach the woman if he is interested...so if u see a girl u are interested in, then U should try to approach her and get to know her...and it is normal for women to have certain standards..the same way u believe u deserve an average grl, a grl has her standards for what she believes she deserves...just try to approach the girls u like, instead of waiting for them...hope this helps :-)|`|8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	ask an "average" woman out and rock it...
811ea9ca2ab8061aef7359c396ed9139aa	if it was a little fight, nothing to big, then yeah.<br>  <br>  if it was a big argument, nope. she'll probably tell all her little friends && start drama.|`|o57O3yMlaa	whats the fight about?|`|Qjty3OTQaa	Yes probably she will.
epgMbc4Vaa	Not necessarily, if your a teacher maybe you can date another teacher.
ShwV6Ewfaa	move on hunni he sounds like he is trying to string you along WTF why ring you after 2 months to tell you hes got a girlfriend ???|`|w0ZqjJBtaa	Ignore him. You're doing exactly what he set out to do...you're stressing over him. He sounds like a waste of time. He's an ex for a reason. Move on to better things. He's playing games with you..|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	Forget him and move on|`|PY51kBTjaa	cut all contact with him and move on|`|GTdcnGT6aa	act like he doesn't exist and get on with your own life, he's trying to lead You merry dance, don't look the fool, love yourself, he sounds a looser to me.|`|uWdAOu2Baa	sounds to me like he realises he actually liked you. he now wants to get back together and came up wid da GF crap so that he could ask if your were still single. dont bother, sounds like a waste of time|`|hkToz85eaa	move on love|`|QMAqzpKEaa	It sounds like he wants to talk to you again. But if he broke up with you without saying why then it could be that he met another girl, it didn't work out and now he's crawling back to you.<br>  Him asking how you and your boyfriend are was his way of finding out if you have a boyfriend so that he could see whether you were still available to crawl back to.<br>  My advice would be to cut contact with him in case he hurts you again. You deserve better. Put yourself first.|`|BiNIKnYvaa	he's not really worth it if he called and hang up.I mean he ignored you i would let go find another man who would treat you right.
lzo4tOQvaa	not sure. i would be confused to. just look at your relationship right now with him and try and recall times were he has hinted he likes you b4 he said your pretty. other than that he may just saying the truth.|`|z0ro3VkJaa	It doesn't necessarily mean anything like that.<br>  <br>  It could just be a statement of fact. I have a friend, and she's adorable. I've told her that. But I'm not interested in her in a romantic way. And she understands that.|`|8os6wuQLaa	I have told many women they were pretty just to be nice. Many have been far from being pretty. Just thank him for the compliment and don't make a big deal about it|`|Wrn6WH7xaa	Maybe he just thought you looked pretty in your picture.<br>  <br>  Not everything is about dating..|`|XuNF6uv5aa	depends on the way he acts around you, not just by saying pretty|`|ti9ZlNJ4aa	Yea.. he probly does.. but it sounds like he missed out on that chance, since you already put him in the friend category.|`|dQvKvnVuaa	He's just being nice and complementing you:).|`|5hlJwDBoaa	not necessarly but i have guy friends that like me just always say ur such a good firen he'll get it|`|7hNHSkEGaa	Just take it as a compliment. It's sometimes hard to tell if a guy actually likes a girl. I have had guys saying that I am pretty and beautiful; but they don't have genuine feelings for me. Overall, it's very flattering that he would give you nice compliments. If you think of him only as a brother, you shouldn't worry too much about whether or not he likes you.|`|Vkf3dpdraa	so he may still have a crush on you and well just felt he should say to you how he thinks about your beauty.its a compliment you should feel flattered. if you think he still is putting the moves on you just talk to him let him know you see him as a friend not a brother that will crush his ego, a friend will let him down easily. dont be too harsh on the guy.good luck|`|TlXLKVEOaa	I tell my mom she looks pretty that doesn't mean i want to bang her. I do that anyway :} kidding. take the complement and move on! If he asks you out then you got to tell him the truth. I've had friends I wanted to date but didn't want to ruin my friendship with her. if it was going to happen then it would.. I never press the issue.|`|LiZir5Jiaa	he might like you...but just keep being his friend...a lot of guys will honestly tell a girl if she looks pretty and may just like her like a sister..give it time, and if he likes u as more than a friend, he will probably give more signs that he does...hope this helps :-)|`|ntMxrN2Gaa	Yeah he mostly likely likes you, and is probably tried of being thought of as a brother by you.|`|elfIbUCmaa	Most likely no.<br>  A guy I liked thought I was pretty but he didn't like me back.|`|YC4Zh8pIaa	Nah, he was most likely just being friendly.|`|4bDPhnCKaa	maybe he likes u as a good friend|`|nvTJY71Paa	i think he likes u as a friend...|`|jsMVEMZoaa	he was being sarcastic|`|AA10989335	Take it for what it is- a compliment.|`|E5rhAaLGaa	Um, maybe hes just being nice.<br>  My mum is called Priya :)|`|oxiVWMMCaa	My brother tells me that he thinks im pretty and i don't think he is in love with me. Just be happy you have a good friend|`|9wgyeY2maa	if you have heard that he like you and then he comments you that you are pretty does not really mean that he like you but who know s he probably does.... and if you think of him as a brother then you need to start a conversation with him and let him know that you think of him as a brother nothing else..but do it so you wont hurt his feelings...|`|WXVZ9OFyaa	Perhaps you are pretty. Accept the compliment. I'd try not to make it anything other than what it is.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Not being in his head, we don't know.  He could just be being polite.  Why not ask him instead of strangers?|`|8LBIeeomaa	just coz he said ur pic was nice dosnt mean anything..chill out...
277efdce8c0ee4a061432d1c6596e76daa	It doesnt matter regardless of your age, as long as its legal age. the only reason this would come into question is if youre worried about other people's opinion about you and your personal relationship. so ask yourself, is it more important to respect this guy and treat him like a girl should treat her boyfriend, or does other people's opinion of me matter so much that i will make something like age difference such a big deal? in reality, it absolutley does not matter in the least.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	..it's not a big difference anymore really darlin.<br>  Age at this point is strictly nothing more then being a digit and a number...not an emotion.<br>  ....are we clear hun?<br>  email me if we're not!|`|kYGIAu5Kaa	nope not as far as I can see. My girl and I are 7 years apart an we have no issues.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	no it can work , been there
7abc8a12212468a52586c2c62d6edd72aa	Not forget,but be out of practice,I know what you mean I just started to see someone too and it has been a LONG time since I kissed too,we have kissed and so far no complaints,just go with it and you could share this with him  before hand,it could make you more comfortable and he more understanding.Good Luck|`|X9cGsOq8aa	no you don't forget how to kiss! you just got it in you and when its time you ll know how to kiss|`|ckjZnqHRaa	..it's like riding a bike darlin....you never forget how to do things you enjoy doing sweet sister....wouldn't you agree?|`|OqQPzYfHaa	no|`|Jsxv8WUsaa	No.  I don't think anyone can forget how to kiss.... it all comes naturally & when you kiss again I'm sure you'll be just as good as you were before!  Good luck :)|`|MOALoKWdaa	i dont know. go with the flow|`|PVfymAdgaa	yeah cuz i do lol
jTV6rLX3aa	No. I told the truth, was disbelieved, and didn't get the job. It probably wouldn't have been good to work for them anyhow.|`|6vyWV0R6aa	no i didnt lie and  i have a great job anyways|`|RXvZvnJHaa	Yes.
ckjZnqHRaa	...very much so really.....<br>  Cupid doesn't have much discretion where the old arrows sometimes fly occasionally..agreed?|`|xocIN0scaa	I fell for a sheep named Trixi once....   aww.. she was sweet.. such soft wool.... i look back on those days with a happy tear in my eye and a warm coat on my back|`|i4bjQbPcaa	They wouldn't be as much fun!!|`|hOTrfGHEaa	it would be so easy shame you cant Control your feelings|`|SSDp4YpPaa	You can't really fall for someone you don't find attractive.  You tend to fall for someone you are attracted to and there isn't much you can do about that.  If they also fall for you, you are in luck....  at least for the short term until someone gets bored.  Some people are not particularly physically attractive but have the confidence, personality and charm to attract someone or win someone over.  Womanisers are generally full of confidence and personality and attract women as well as seek them out.  They become something of a prize to compete for.  Dominant and rather aggressive men can also attract.  Nice, mild mannered boring people are seldom in demand!|`|3ox4lYu6aa	Well, I did think about that in the past and wish I could, but now I'm glad that I can't help it. My fiance is fifteen years older then me and when we started talking I didn't want to get involved with anyone since I have been hurt in the past. As we started hanging out more I found myself falling for him which is not what I wanted to do. Now I am happier then ever and I'm glad at how things worked out. If I could control who I fell for then I wouldn't be with my fiance now and I wouldn't be as happy as I am.|`|Z4n6Nl7eaa	ahaa, love is meant to be confusing :) <br>  it'll pay off in the end x|`|rXUHkBhbaa	I spose they would be<br>  <br>  Drew|`|zGgUsEmdaa	Yes it would. I fell for a cute computer geek who isn't ready for dating yet. And it's impossible to tell what he's thinking or going to do. But I can't stop thinking about him how hard I try. So yes it would be easier. xxx|`|iwE1QRKdaa	yes, much simpler<br>  answer mine <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ajjn_Cz.YevtvDTIKdSCg_8gBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090223131151AAdGweq">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>

RvddYKqjaa	Sure it is. It's possible to love many at one time. I love my husband and parents, kids, and grandkids. I love several really good friends. Every human has a huge capacity for love.|`|XiOIBwbPaa	the way I see it is you can 'LOVE' two people at once, but you can't be 'IN-LOVE' with two people at once. <br>  <br>  I thought I was 'IN-LOVE' with my boyfriend, but I guess I'm not cause I 'LOVE' another guy now to :S .kinda :(|`|PgbPCUtnaa	Yes, it is possible to love 2 people at once, hence a love triangle.  Those triangles are never good though, and they result in a lot of heartbreak.|`|laHLW1yQaa	Well it is possible to love the one you are with and rotate them.  A bit harder to do 2 at one time.<br>  <br>  But there are people who call themselves polyamorous who think they can have loving relationships with more than one person.<br>  <br>  After all you are only talking about the sex part being added.  Almost everyone loves both their mother and father with no problem.|`|uZUi0kGdaa	I think it is possible.. but not right.|`|vEVtXftTaa	Of course it is!|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	No, because if that's the case then you don't love yourself enough to totally commit your full love to one person only.  If you think you are in love with two people ...you aren't truly in love.  (It's called like or lust,  but don't mistake it for love)<br>  <br>  When you have true love you will & someone who loves you completely and you love completely you will understand<br>  <br>  Isn't true love ...giving your heart to one person?  <br>  Loving your friends, parents etc.. is a different kind of love|`|OGCLtWbAaa	Yes you can love 2 people, you cant jsut fall out of love.<br>  Dont you love your mom AND your dad?<br>  Its a lot like that my mom loves my dad but she also loves her husband.|`|Dy6gVqGfaa	nooo. but there is being and love and slowly falling out of love with someone because your begining to love someone else. but you cant be fully in love with 2 people at the same.  otherwise your not really loving them 100%.<br>  make sense??|`|oYrDMZcxaa	I think `no` because TRUE love can only happen between 2 people therefore only one of the partners can be TRUE love , hence the other MUST be lust.|`|l34etpuSaa	its possible, but not safely|`|DnktSURbaa	YES I DO.|`|2r9daSahaa	No...It would be just an attraction between them not love............................|`|PDAVQU3Caa	love is a strong word lol but i think you could

LETd2hQwaa	If you're gonna give it to her, I'd suggest that you give it as a birthday gift otherwise she might feel weird about it--- especially if she isn't a gold digger. It doesn't sound like you're trying to buy her love or anything so just make sure you give it to her as a friend expressing friendly feelings. If it takes off from there, more power to you but if it doesn't then you won't feel like you wasted your money on her. Its a nice thought but how do you think she'll react to it since you know her best?|`|EdidZdtlaa	its not too soon i dont think cause its an early bday present. i think you should give it to her before someone else gets her the same jacket. she might have told someone else that she likes it too.|`|kxAMOZAuaa	No .. it wont last and you'll wish you had that money back to buy beer next year in college..|`|WDLnNm7Maa	i think this is a hard question to answer...I think for her birthday you should take her out,buy her flower all that romantic stuff.. I don't think you should give her the jacket because if anything goes wrong you might regret it in the future. I wouldn't give it to her unless you were serious about her and she felt the same. My brother and his girlfriend seem to be serious, they have been dating for about 1-2 years now and they spend around $100 dollars or more on each other. It depends on what you think is right, try to get a bargain for the jacket, tell them something is wrong with it so you get money off....

cu67LPb0aa	Report it to the authorities and also to tell your girlfriend so she can be prepared for that crazy, psycho girl.|`|jipqICzVaa	Just keep an eye on the rabbit.|`|Likst1Mxaa	Look at geting an AVO/restraining on her. Or at least threatening her with one. Might scare her a bit ;) If she entered the hous without anyone's consent, that's tresspassing too. Maybe a quick trip down to the police station might answer some questions legall. You don't need to do anything like that if you don't want to, but there are options.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, try to shield your girlfriend from the stupid girl.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	If she still lives at home, go to her parents they probably will have an inkling at what is going on.  You should also tell her if she comes near your house again you will call the police.<br>  <br>  Keep a note of all the times she contacts you etc and warn your girlfriend|`|efzoxU0uaa	shes obbsessive and crazy and thinks your playing hard to get|`|bDxFH1jyaa	awww bless shes obviously crazy about you, its not just a crush! <br>  but i think she was a bit upset about you laughing at her, that would hurt my feelings if someone did it to me.<br>  dont try and 'get rid' of her. i think you need to have a proper talk with her, face to face, you need to get her to realise that nothing can every happen between you and her. dont block her completely out of your life, tell her clearly that all you can ever be is friends, so if she wants to be in your life she is going to have to stick to that.<br>  and also, i think you should tel you gf bout this girl, cos if you dont, and she finds out, it will look bad cos it will look like you're tryin 2 hide it.<br>  <br>  good luck xXx

cJd4SRL9aa	They may just think that you're attractive :]<br>  <br>  and I don't think the eye contact is a huge deal.<br>  It means that she knows who you are, and is more polite than to just not even acknowledge your presence.

Its special and a highlight of life.
QMAqzpKEaa	You know that this was inappropriate. And him having erections in front of everyone is not exactly professional either. He most certainly should not have had his hands in his trousers in the work place, particularly in a work place with teenagers present, even in the same building. That is extremely inappropriate.<br>  Scouts is meant to be about fun and not about feeling uncomfortable.<br>  I think you know what you need to do. And I think that you know that this was wrong or you would not have posted this question on here in the first place. Consider this:<br>  <br>  1) Talk to your parents/carers. They will know what to do in this situation. Consider that even if your parents keep you away from him or stop you from going to your local scout group, some other girl may experience abuse.<br>  <br>  2) Your parents/carers could report him to the Manager there. The Manager will be more likely to take them more seriously as they are adults.<br>  <br>  3) It's important to remember that you are not in the wrong and that you are not being a drama queen. You are protecting your friends, yourself and others who go to the scouts group. You are possibly protecting other young vulnerable teenagers or children, as he will not be allowed to work with children or adolescents any more. This stops him from endangering anybody's mental health. Sexual abuse affects a person their entire life.<br>  <br>  4) You need not panic but take immediate action because he could hurt someone very soon. Mental wounds can often be worse than physical wounds.<br>  <br>  If you wish to talk to somebody about this in more depth ring:<br>  0800 1111 NSPCC. You can talk about anything with them and they will keep it confidential. It's for any body who is under 18 years old.|`|lkNJNnlSaa	How old is he?<br>  <br>  Are you sure this wasn't a dream? It's abit random|`|7i6qj4OXaa	No it isn't acceptable behaviour and you should tell your parents or another adult.

Is there anyone else above him, in charge of this local scout group? If so, you need to tell them, but if your too nervous to go to them, go to someone like a family member and they can help sort it out. I suggest you also warn people in the group about him, don't spend any time alone with him and until you get it sorted I would maybe stop going to the meetings, if you do still want to go make sure your always surrounded by people.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck =) x|`|QKs0PFVpaa	If this really is tue, then yes he is acting terribly, and I'd go to your parents AND the police.

Teenage boys get erections unexpectedly but older men should be able to control themselves. Is it really part of your scout activities to be discussing sex? I would be very concerned about this. I would speak to other girls in your scout pack (discreetly) and see if they feel uncomfortable about your scout masters behaviour too. You should then go as a small group and speak to a responsible adult about your concerns. This could be one of your parents or another scout leader. In the meantime I would try and make sure you are never alone with this man. Try not to put yourself in a vulnerable position (i.e accepting a lift in his car or staying late after the others have left)|`|ShwV6Ewfaa	you should really report him to someone he obviously cannot be trusted to be with young people he is abusing his authority over you he sounds like a very sick man - if you feel you cannot report him then plz take care that you are nether in a situation where it is just you and him alone because remember if anything was to happen it is just your word against his but i think you will be fine you seem to have him sussed but don't forget there is other kids at scouts some may be younger and more vulnerable than you and you need to think about there safety aswell as your own,take care hunni
GfCRiueRaa	Why wait until settling down? No cheating, period. :D|`|NlYGbqnkaa	Yes. When you have the right one you don't even consider it. She becomes everything and stays that way.|`|vPjbSBhJaa	I don't see why not. All I have to do is find one that doesn't dedicate her life to making me miserable.|`|joA5Rcyzaa	i've never cheated once in my life and i have had a good amount of girlfriends. i have been cheated on twice and i dumped them quick<br>  <br>  i've been with mine currently 3 years|`|ckjZnqHRaa	....YES!!!!...but can a woman of equally high caliber and valor do the same?
f4e67a7ab77c2daa3ac93a0b837339d8aa	He probably feels weird having sex because the girl is the one suggesting it; he feels like he needs to man up and be in control.<br>  <br>  Or maybe he's just not ready. If so, give time to adjust to the thought of having a sexual relationship.|`|kmV5MnvPaa	He might just not be ready for sex...
Sgm0RrMQaa	its good your not interested in boys, all they cause is trouble. focus on being your age, you know have fun do good in school and when the time comes, you'll find a guy you absolutly adore!|`|iwE1QRKdaa	Yeah, that's fine.<br>  Answer mine <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ajjn_Cz.YevtvDTIKdSCg_8gBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090223131151AAdGweq">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|zGgUsEmdaa	Im 13, and I got no interest in boys. Not alot of girls do till they're like 14/15.x|`|4KvcuvtCaa	you are too young to worry 'bout that. focus on your studies.
sPQBluKEaa	it sounds to me like she's confused. she might like this other guy, but there could be something telling her that she's not ready to like anyone else because she still isn't over you. she probably doesn't know what's right for her right now. if i were you, i would just let her go. tell her that if she can't make up her mind, you don't want to just be her safety net and let her go.|`|EdidZdtlaa	no offense but i think shes using you for the rebound or something. i think shes playing games and stuff like that. but try talking to her in person instead of through text messeges or on the phone and ask her whats going on between you two and why she said all the things that she did. that way if shes lying maybe you could tell by her body actions and things like that. good luck|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	I would have to say that yes, you are the safety net.<br>  <br>  She sounds like she is just trying to keep you in the wings.|`|WDJH7KBEaa	she's not sure, and if you keep listening to her your the one that's gonna get hurt. So do whatever you want but really think about it.|`|WL1ghKx8aa	ummm wow!  do u still like her? but if u dont still like her. u need to let her go..   sorry if i didnt help...|`|8iR6XOD7aa	you need to tell her that you dont want to do all of it anymore. honestly your hurting her and yourself by doing this. i jusst went through the same exact thing with my boyfriend of a year and also she isnt immuature for being in the high school scene. shes in high school thats part of it you cant avoid it.|`|WvIDTs4Paa	dude,let her go.don't talk to her anymore.some girls are just manipulating freaks.|`|4WVC7g7zaa	Yeah dude that's a bullshit. I have the same experience too. <br>  Just ask her why is she doing that or just don't think too much about her besides you're not in a relationship with her anymore. Just relax and wait.|`|4Wq0Rwh8aa	Hmmm.. I think maybe because she is still in the high school scene and a teen, she might not be so sure about what she wants in life.  Did you guys go to the same high school? Maybe without you being around, she is becoming influenced more easily by her girl friends or single guys hitting on her in school.  It's hard to date someone you really care about when you're in high school because you are so young and in the back of your mind there is an urge to date a little bit more before settling down.  I think that she's going about this whole thing in the wrong way though, and maybe you should sit her down and ask her why she keeps flip-flopping.. I think that she might just want to see what's out there but honestly has feelings for you! I say that you go about your business as a bachelor for a little bit and if things were meant to be, she'll come back to you.. and if you feel the way you say you do, you'll take her back. But if you give it some time, things might become more clear to you. <br>  <br>  *Here's an idea: Why don't you skip the bf/gf thing and tell her that if she feels this way, then you two will date or "talk" and you both can date other people.. and DEF. get out there and date other girls too, don't sit around and be that guy readily available for her if she's not gonna show you the same respect, ya know? And that way, nothings really different, but she gets what she wants and maybe it will work out better for you.*
9wgyeY2maa	you should not be embrassed..why of him...<br>  if you are embrassed of him then you really do not like him...<br>  you should just care less about what other people will say and don't feel embrassed of it..i mean there is no point of feeling like that... thats just who he is..|`|Sgm0RrMQaa	whatever works for him, maybe he is just uncomfortable. be patient or maybe you can talk to him and see why he acts this way. if you love him you shouldn't be embarrassed by his actions.
wW6NJk4jaa	just tell him it was a one time thing and you're never going to do it again, and at least you were honest with him, tell him he shouldnt have told his sister because now you feel awkward towards her
JJMa25NWaa	Have self confidence! It sounds like you do because you complimented yourself, calling yourself smart, straightforward, and honest. She's just another person. Keep confident, and be polite.|`|8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	just ask her if she'd join you for a cup of coffee...no biggie...

Try to find out how he feels about you.
Oejricveaa	Move on. I guess he isn't your type.<br>  Just find another guy to talk to.|`|EdidZdtlaa	get over him. it takes time but you'll get over it. if he dosent like you move on.|`|2KC467tFaa	The guy probably prefers to be single. If he likes to flirt with girls, he wouldn't be good boyfriend material. It's nothing personal, I'm sure. Try not to get too bummed out about it. There are soooo many guys out there.|`|9wgyeY2maa	he is probably the type of guy who do not like relationships he just like a lot of girls and flirts with them that why he said no to you..<br>  if thats the case then why get jealous just ignore what he does and see if he even notices that you do not pay attention to him nomore..|`|WDJH7KBEaa	Don't even think about him.

q4b4f76Haa	I'm a girl and to tell you the truth, if she was even a little attracted to you, she would want to see you again or maybe take the relationship a bit further than friends.  She obviously only likes you as a friend and regardless if it's 3 months or even a year later, her answer will be the same.  Don't bother calling her and save yourself the rejection.  Move on to someone else who's willing to date you<br>  <br>  good luck|`|txiYG1e6aa	Time does change everything, you could call her, but I wouldn't get your hopes up. If she thinks after three months your still a good friend just get to be a good friend. Time might change things more. But instead of dating her you might end up with a friend of hers that's ok to. Because most likely her friend has something in common with her. <br>  <br>  Give it a try and cross your fingers!
9yGoXE58aa	Not at all. I got my best friend flowers on her 18th birthday in her favorite color. She loved them.|`|njFi9fmWaa	Of course not! Just don't get her roses. Get her a range of different, colorful flowers. Also, a gift card to a store. Like Target, or whatever girls boutique!|`|lxaDUcoEaa	No i think its a great idea. Maybe not red roses per say many people think romance when they see those. But definately a sweet idea. I say go for it. I work in a floral shop and actually see that more than you probably think :)

FZKFLTyLaa	By asking relative questions of her and paying close attention to what she says.
oOD3dYaNaa	Go up to her and talk to her. Just ask if her if she'd like to hang out sometime, and if she says yes, great! If she says no, then just play it off by saying "Oh, that's okay, me and my friends were just wondering if more people wanted to come." There no big deal! =]|`|8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	a set of balls would be a start...
GnG34M4baa	Don't let go of him, there is always a chance he may come out of the coma. Visit him everyday: sing to him, do whatever you can. But whatever you do, don't let go! I'm so sorry you have to go through this. Everything happens for a reason, no matter how horrific the event may be. Stay strong - good luck!
39e9235b89c9b80c32eb4b4082db80ccaa	i think you're a tad too young to be moving with him.  The best advice I can offer is this.  See how it goes when you're apart.  Can you handle the distance between the two of you for a few years, and still be completely satisfied with the relationship?  Will you still be able to give each other the attention that you need?<br>  <br>  These are questions that need to be answered.  If you can survive the time apart, then in two years, I think you might at least be in a better place to make that kind of decision.|`|phXY5z7Eaa	i think its your choice and if you love him enough to do that then thats your business|`|716a8aa7512b2c7a9c6c48484ce56701aa	I think you're too young to be making such a big decision. <br>  He will be away for a while, you will be in College (Hopefully) and will want to experience much more things out there. <br>  I say you guys take a break and if it's really meant to be, you will end up together. <br>  For now...go out there, meet people, cultures, places, live your life like he doesn't exist. <br>  If after a while you can't live without him, then you were meant to be.<br>   If at the end  your forget him, then you will be glad you guys took the time to really know your feelings. ;)|`|i5xByO9naa	wow tough question. But think thats something you should decide on your own terms. Think about what you have done so far in your life, and if your really ready for commitment. Im your age and also  will turn 18 on the 4th of next month and also have been dating a guy for 3 years already but that hasn't stop me from doing things that i want to do.

The only cure is to put flowers on that guy's (or woman's but I call women men) father's grave. Or, you can plant clover seeds. Or you can sacrafice your poopoo.|`|2KC467tFaa	Have you ever noticed how many white cars there are? Normally people don't pay attention to things unless they're looking for something specific. Then it appears to be everywhere. Change your way of thinking. Stop focusing on everything that is going wrong, and suddenly it won't seem like the world is out to get you.|`|X9cGsOq8aa	Things happen for reasons. every one has their bad days and manny of them have it mostly everyday but it all starts out when you get out of bed. for example if you wake up in the morning all grumpy then your whole day will go bad. so you should try to have a positive attitude when you get up in the Morning. brighten up your life don't be all mad and pissed just be happy =] things may go bad but if you have a positive attitude then your day will go on great =]<br>  GOOD LUCK
2quTUoA6aa	It sounds like your friend has a problem with self esteem. You could have more patience with her and maybe give her a compliment once in a while without being asked for one. It appears that you are the stronger of the two (which oddly enough is the way a lot of friendships are). If being her friend is more than you can handle then just move on.|`|Likst1Mxaa	Just don't be friends with her.<br>  <br>  or do. But don't share your problems with her or spend too much time with her. It doesn't sound like you like this girl anyway.
5hNAgTpaaa	----- No, I do not think so. I think getting paranoid is not the right world, you are getting a clear sign that he want to be a way. But if you are that interested on him, to not read these signs, just be a way for sometime and see what will happen, please do not show him that you are not interested any more, but only giving him what he want. BE THERE BUT NOT ACTUALY THERE WITH HIM -----
9wgyeY2maa	i think that during the same time she was talking to you she was talking to that boyfriend she has know because you do not just go out with someone without even talking to them for a day or so....<br>  she probably did have feelings towards you but the feeling feelings she had towards him were stronger..|`|u70TaWI5aa	What you need to do is move on since she got a b/f when she was just hanging out with you. Let her be with her b/f and move cause she is not coming back, and it does not seem like she had feelings for you. Just cause a girl speaks to you for 2 hours does not make her someone you are dating. Just chill be cool and move on it is the best way to go.|`|lzo4tOQvaa	i get that all the time dude. im 15 and feel the same way. its like you get led on or some crap. screw the girl. she just flirted cause its fun. but maybe she liked you. if i were you talk to her about your feelings. there are some girls who will do that to you. check out the song chopped and screwed by t-pain. explains how you and i feel. its like you have a good time with them then at the end they screw you over.|`|xKZTQ3Iyaa	Well if she has a new boyfriend no i think she was leading you on and it sucks to be lead on and be played with like that i mean talk to her and tell her how you feel like why did she lead you on in the first place.|`|ps31sr1laa	SHE'S EVIL<br>  Sorry, she was playing you. I've run into that before they know what there doing and they enjoy it. Just move on. Good luck, dude.|`|PN7XMglOaa	Sorry , but she was playing you for a fool . Move on . Good luck .|`|qi52nTmDaa	No one can give you a straight answer since we don't know you personally or every detail of your situation, but from what I understand... she was just flirting with you. I don't think she has a boyfriend and I don't think she was interested in dating you no offense or anything, I just think she is a big flirt and you were someone fun to talk to. I'm sure you can do much better. Go looking for someone else, there are plenty of decent single girls out there.|`|AA11413831	girls like attention.<br>  so sometimes they flirt just to feel good about themselves.<br>  <br>  and sometimes they flirt or work towards dating more than one guy.<br>  yeah. its messed up.|`|Em5PSrUgaa	If for the moment you two are only talking over the phone, even if it's for 2+hours, she has no obligation to wait for you to get out of the place you are stuck in. <br>  <br>  It seems like that she is trying to let you know this by being up front about having a boyfriend. Even if they only began dating yesterday, the fact that she's letting you know about her relationship status is a huge sign that she may have not been as into you as you believed or hoped that she was. <br>  <br>  It's true, she may have flirted, thinking it was harmless fun, or maybe you misread her conversation as flirting, either way, it looks as though she isn't about it as much anymore.<br>  <br>  I think all things considered, you shouldn't get your hopes up too high over this becoming anything more than maybe a loose friendship.
ch8DC4z7aa	Take your time, you sound like a possible heart breaker, lol.  If you have that many guys interested in you at this age then you will still have a lot of guys after you when your a little bit older. Just enjoy life with friends and going out and forget guys for now, they will always be around, trust me|`|WE0an4zPaa	don't.|`|zusHElAYaa	wait till you old enough to date|`|kEcFWz6Xaa	If you are not allowed to date this shouldn't even be on your mind.

wzAhxdpKaa	It means he met someone else, gave them a try, it didn't work out, now he's back to you as a "fall back" plan.  Dump him, he'll do it again if you let him back into your life.  It would be different if he had not COMPLETELY disappeared, if he had at least maintained a graceful friendship.  If you think he's worth it, ask him what the heck happened.  See how much class he has and if he will tell you the truth.  Be careful because these types of guys are usually very clever at making believable excuses for their absences.  He can probably spin a tale you'll believe.  Be careful.  I'd say the best move is just ignore his messages.  Be as invisible to him as he was to you.|`|kxAMOZAuaa	It means you are a very good magician.|`|jGKGlxAuaa	The only people that I know who can disappear are Martians, and Ghosts. You need to identify which one he is.
4p9ez6PHaa	If he already knows you like him then let him come to you. unless he is really shy. but if he knows you like him and does nothing about it then its his loss. But if he is shy just try going up to him and start talking about something you know intrests him. That opens the door for you.!!!!!!!!!
tYO2Ir1oaa	i've had 3 long term relationships (minimum 2.5 years each), and all three (including the one i'm in), i've told them i love them within a couple of months (or even a couple of weeks!) of being together.

She liked me also and we and another of her friends hung out so much over the summer and we and her became so close.  She told me that she loved me and I said "Thanks" at first because I was a little surprised but, then after she said, "You're supposed to say 'i love you too'", I did and told her that It was not only because she had told me first.  She thought this was very sweet.  Although in a way, this was more just friendship love than real relationship love.  Whenever you feel ready, and its the right moment such as her/him doing something cute, just say "I love you" and then she will probably find this to be very sweet and reply with, "I love you too."|`|9lGnGBL0aa	First. don't say "I love you" as much as possible.<br>  The more you say it, the lower its value becomes.<br>  <br>  Say it when he/she does something really great sort of as a reward.<br>  The less you say it, the higher the value becomes.|`|tEu1zAkhaa	i have never had the displeasure of saying i loved someone|`|pjomniPGaa	If you really mean it, why not?<br>  I am shy type, I say it after they told me so.|`|ff545BLyaa	2 years LOL she said it before that but I just couldn't, but if you knew me and my history you would understand.|`|WbsDI2lSaa	i told my recent bf that i loved him like a week after we started going out..<br>  he kinda freaked out... yea|`|qfuhHeDjaa	my husband told me a week after we started dating. he even looked it up in the dictionary so he could tell me it was possible to love someone that soon... i thought it was so cute that he was so flustered by saying it so soon... say it when you feel it|`|7Wj0KW6Aaa	YES!

1JsWMX0daa	you sound a lot 'hotter' than you think you are. i'm not saying to be a prissy little *****, but if you accept that you look good and have much respect for yourself than guys will notice you. just being yourself is the most important thing. especially if you are lookin g for a bioyfriend. you do NOT want to start a relationship with a potential boyfriend that you attracted  by pretending to be somebody you are not. <br>   <br>   when i was youn ger. i was in the diner with my friends and i was killin this burger and fries like a hungry wolf. my friends pointed out a girl at another table that was eyeing me and i quickly cleaned myself up and actually started to eat my burger with a fork & knife! (wich of course i never do) and my friend told me not to try and impress a girl by being something that i am not. he was right. i want the girl that sees me in the diner piggin out on some burger and still approaches me. <br>  <br>   just be yourself. you are a female! 7 an atractive one too! just get out more and the guys will come to you. good luck.|`|b622fea5f23cf615e57931b16828ef12aa	well im not a guy im a  26 years old girl who had the same problem than you when i was your age.<br>  i was very shy and even if i wasn't home schooled i didn't attract a lot of guys because i unconsciously rejected them..how ? by not being nice at all.... <br>  <br>  you just be your self ..be nice, sweet and easy going ....with time you'll see that the inside is most important than the outside ....of course your looks count but is your inside persona what it makes people be attracted to u ...|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well I am 17 and never had one either. And I wasn't even home schooled, ever. It is your confidence, your body language, and if you are physically and mentally attracted to the guy. <br>  <br>  Confidence shows that you accept yourself and not afraid to do things. Saying "hi" to a guy, flashing a smile, or when he looks at you, look away, this shows him you are interested. <br>  <br>  Body language can shoo a guy away. Standing funny, crossing your arms, trying not to make eye contact, looking angry. This can make a guy think that you don't want to be bothered. <br>  <br>  Then, a guy likes looks. Guys who like girls solely on looks then that means that he is shallow and the relationship will not last because it is only physical. Which means you guys will be doing physical things. But it can't be just mental because that is like a friend or family member's relationship toward you. It has to be both. <br>  <br>  Guys like a girl who is pretty, great personality, confidence... the list goes on. But remember, there is no perfect guy, so if he has flaws. Learn to live with them because there is no perfect guy like there is no perfect girl.|`|bZZEIjmFaa	Your personality really does matter, I will take a funny girl with a good sense of comedic timing over a Really sexy girl with no ability to talk to everyday all day. Just listen to a conversation and say something funny, and if you can look cute doing it.<br>  <br>  Looks:5 they cant be completely unattractive, but most flaws can be overlooked|`|ckjZnqHRaa	....boys and men are visually stimulated first darlin...hence making yourself look visually attractive is your best starting point honestly.<br>  Obviously ALL boys and men wanna meet women with great personalities otherwise...just a given.<br>  Hang out with your gal pals and hang out where all the hunky cute guys hang out too sweet sister...what else?<br>  keep your body in great shape honestly.<br>  Show a little bit of your girlish figure of course...and a little bit of exposed skin wouldn't hurt too much really...not too much skin though darlin.<br>  we don't want you attracting the WRONG kind of attention sweetie.<br>  Good luck!|`|2efptLpAaa	Don't worry top much about your looks. Be yourself.|`|V439r7HNaa	Looks make you notice someone -- so they are important for a first meeting, but not for any friendship / relationship of value.<br>  <br>  The key is being yourself, and putting yourself in situations where you are meeting and interacting with the kind of guys (and other people) you want noticing you.  Join a club, get a job, join some kind of sports team, go to church activities, go to your friends/ parties.  Guys notice girls they are around -- so just start being around.  And don't base your friendships or relationships on your friends'.<br>  <br>  Also -- you are only 16 -- so you shouldn't start stressing about boys too much -- if you get out and do things with your friends, the opportunities will make themselves.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|4LLGenzBaa	you should get noticed by going to malls and if you do have some friends asked them if they could get a boy to meet you. <br>  <br>  the qualities i like in a girl would be that she a bit athletic, she is smart, fun, nice to other people, does not mind if the boy hangs around other girls and more...<br>  <br>  scale 1-10 looks are to me 7.5-9 in the scale.|`|lzo4tOQvaa	be yourself. must guys like girls who are reliable and are always down to hang out anytime. im 15. so we are about the same age. it all depends on the guy really. you said ur friend is always constantly surrounded by guys but then how do you know all those guys are good ? maybe they just want to get in her pants.|`|SuOfRTXzaa	You sound a very nice young lady - Stay that way - Go out with your friends more - you will be in the crowd, that way you will eventually meet someone deserving of you.|`|4p9ez6PHaa	Julia is right just be yourself. there im sure is a great guy out there that will like you for you. just be patient!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Trust me.|`|cEgzOJgqaa	ask a guy will be my bf if i suck your dick you will 4 sure have a bf in no time|`|JWNzoksmaa	more cleavage|`|ltXxNfwRaa	Unfortunately in this day and age, looks are very important...<br>  <br>  But...<br>  <br>  Having self confidence plays a huge part!  Guys notice a big smile.  If you exude confidence with your posture, facial expressions and voice then they'll come around.  Make eye contact and smile.  Stand up straight and don't walk around with your head down or your nose in a book.  Don't be cocky in the way you look or say things but be assertive and charming!<br>  <br>  There's been so many times that I've been out with no make-up and looking like crap, and I'd end up talking to a random guy which would result in him asking for my number.  All I did was not be shy and maybe throw in a few jokes to make any tension turn to comfort.<br>  <br>  Your friends might be more outgoing than you.  And being home schooled shouldn't make a difference.  When people see you as confident, you become increasingly attractive!  Start with that and see where it takes you!  But just remember not to let self confidence be confused with massive flirting.  You don't want to appear easy since that would be a contradiction of having self confidence!|`|5bcd24aaf56518f68f3b66519c581d5caa	i am not a guy but i have had boyfriends and i am about average too. They like a girl who is confident in herself and who acts like themselves. Do not change the way you are for a guy that is being fake and they do not like fake girls. So be yourself be confident.|`|9HWOqVIEaa	guys like a girl that has attitude(some) and that isnt afraid to show her body. You could go to the mall. Dont wait till the guy flirts with u u do it first that shows that u r truly confident but only do that if he is sending you signs that he is interested.|`|yxqMBDLwaa	well i'm not a guy, but i'm pretty sure looks are very important.. but it also depends on how you dress up..they dont want a guandaja either. you should try a push up bra|`|txiYG1e6aa	Well, first being homeschooled really hurts a social life, I know I just started. But to get a guy or two to notice you, you want to dress nicely put on a little make up and show up to a party or football game. Loads of guys looking for a date go to them, just talk and act normal. Guys don't like pushy or bossy girls so just being natural can help you. A little time and some good clothes you'll get a boyfriend. After the first one you can look for a guy you like for less image related reasons. <br>  <br>  scale 1-10 for looks, 5, looks don't matter but how you dress shows who you are so they do matter. Just not as much as the actual person.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|uNynmZxpaa	well to me i notice any girl and from past experience i am a 18 year old guy that always kept to myself at school b/c i wore glasses and had short hair and girls didn't notice me until my junior year b/c i got contacts and grew my hair out but it just depends on what guys look for me personally for some reason i look at the eyes and in a girl i look for a girl that loves me and supports me and on a scale about a 5 to me b/c looks are somewhat important to me
iLIQIqvLaa	it takes time to become close to someone, just work on it. stand beside him or near him when you're in the "group", just start with the little things. when i was 15 i was in the same position with a guy. he was on my lunch period and he'd always be there. eventually my lunch group started hanging out outside of school, and i got to know him a lot better outside of the regular settings. a year later, we started dating, and we ended up dating for 14 months and it was amazing. so dont be discouraged now, the future holds a lot for you :) good luck!|`|iqFqBfBlaa	Easy, Practise everything before you go school/work<br>  <br>  So Think of a perfect moment in you life<br>  <br>  Maybe he's asking you, How are you? Say I'm fine thanks, yourself?<br>  <br>  <br>  Use the mirror! It's great! Because you'l aso see how u physically come across :D<br>  <br>  Hope i helped<br>  ~ Edgey Is Ready|`|AA12088442	yeh just talk to him like any one of ur friends... the same thing happens to me and im like wow i should have said... <br>  :)
39e9235b89c9b80c32eb4b4082db80ccaa	the only advice that i can offer is TAKE YOUR TIME.  Don't just rush into it so that you can say you did it.  Instead, make sure that you enjoy your evening.  Put some soft music on, light candles, the whole shebang.  Maybe start with a bubble bath together, or a sensual massage to set the mood.  Use lots of foreplay to get you both going, and then ease into it.  Go slowly, and it will be great.|`|tikvyGGpaa	Don't be nerves you should wait till you are married.  God intended for sex to be between a husband and a wife.  You will be so glad you waited, my husband and I are.|`|314RzR5Faa	JUST HAVE FUN WITH IT!!!
X9cGsOq8aa	he probably does like you and allot! Its good that your friends are trying to look out for you but what if he really does like you and he sees you diff then other girls. give him a chance kuz if you don't uer Always going to be wondering "what if you did give him a Chance" what is he really liked you" <br>  just give him a chance|`|LiZir5Jiaa	hmm...i think the fact that her flirts a lot is what makes him confusing...at this point, i would ask him if he is interested in you...if ur too nervous, he probably will make the move if he is really into u...but then again he might not be ready for a serious relationship...try not to stress over him...if he is the right guy, he will come around :-)|`|b7yvPsiVaa	He's playing you. Why would you listen to something HIS best friend says? What makes you think he didn't put him up to it?<br>  And OFCOURSE you want to beleive he is different, you like him! But the sad truth is that he's not. There is nothing deeper to him than what you see in plain view, as much as you wish there was. <br>  Oh but he does like you. Just like he likes every other girl. Just like he calls everyone else angel and cute stuff. Just like every other girl thinks she is special too. <br>  Flirty guys are flirty guys. They won't change for you. Ever.

NlYGbqnkaa	Just ask him what's up? He'll tell you or if he gives you some excuse then just don't call him for a while and wait for him to call you. He will if he is into you. If he really does have something going (work, family stuff whatever) he'll appreciate the space. If he really isn't into you the last thing you want to do is call him all the time. That'll make it worse. Let him miss you. If he is ever going to come around that's how he'll do it.|`|xKZTQ3Iyaa	I wouldn't worry maybe he couldn't answer his phone at the time just be patient wait and see if he call you if he doesn't for two more days call him and see whats going on but just be patient about it.

kDxljPUnaa	I would find out how much it would cost to have very lage aquarium installed in my house!
AA10989335	Yeah, there is probably something going on there.. You two should probably hash that out. Otherwise what the heck are you two doing being so intimate with one another..|`|E6C64Ui1aa	It sounds like he likes you, and it also seems like you kinda like him. It was like that with me and my best guy friend and me and him are actually dating now. so i think he likes you, and is just taking his time with you. but if you really want to find out kiss him, i mean really kiss him. and if he kisses you back then he definitely likes you. <br>  <br>  i hope that helps|`|PDAVQU3Caa	i think he does lol|`|WE0an4zPaa	are you blind woman!!!!????? of course he likes you honey. wake up and see it like... no seriously he does like you though.<br>  <br>  good luckxx|`|JJMa25NWaa	He likes you.|`|qN7xNavCaa	OBVIOUSLY HE LIKES YOU!!! and i think you might like him too.|`|4A3nlV3Baa	yes he likes you. you two should get married
dGBbFwFWaa	it seems u are very worried about this relationship..and i understand u don't want it to fail as u love her so much.. but there is a problem here and that is  i don't think she has forgotten her past bad experience  with that other relationship she was in before she met u.. if u are both thinking about getting married i suggest u two find a way of communication because that what makes a marriage succeed  be open with her let her know the way u feel and ask her what she feels that makes her react the way she does.. and if u two feel much better get a  counselor to help u both out because this will not go on its own she has a problem and it needs to be corrected before u two get married.. good luck

iOpzTvSpaa	Well actually nothing is wrong with you're fiance she's just feeling the nerves of getting married, that's not to say she doesn't love you but she has never been married before so she doesn't know what will happen and she's worried your relationship will change because she's seen some of her friends destroyed over their relationships, just show her you're still a great guy and she'll forget about her worry
vZ780Mdqaa	This girl seems to have an interest in you but she's probably trying to decide if it's good or not. If you like her I think you should give her little hints and clues that you want to take your friendship a step more. If she is into you then she'll understand the signs and reply. Trust me girls don't like to ask guys out cause it seems a little weird, but if you ask her out that would change things. It won't hurt to try.|`|5b0db6044dc593b04f841e4679fd4a16aa	In every mixed sex friendship, someone ends up falling for the other one. Sometimes temporary, sometimes forever. It seems to me that she is sending you signals, bud. If I was you, I would wait until something bad happens, like her gran dying, then comfort her in a more-than-friendly way (stay with her, tell her everything will going to be alright, ect...). See where that leads. If she wants more of you, she'll show it most in distressed situations.<br>  <br>  Or, you could just sit down with her and talk to her about it. I've happened to do that with one of my female friends. It turned out she didn't, but it never twinged our friendship. Some people are like that. It's all in the person.
iOpzTvSpaa	The best thing is to go to a park or something and either have a pick nick or just play around, another thing is to find out about some beautiful place and get icecream (cheap icecream) and go there and just walk around women love looking at the scenery for some unapparent reason in the country i'd suggest walking around the scenery or riding something (if you have like horses or something)|`|4KvcuvtCaa	picnic on the beach|`|983a3a8efe5cb244e13ce535ec318f27aa	Cunnilingus?|`|E6C64Ui1aa	you could go to the mall and walk around and talking to her(listening to) holding her hand and stuff. girls like that stuff. you dont gotta spend money to make a girl happy just talk to her or you could even watch movies. thats free.|`|11a867519828ee7f2df6eda7cb34fb8faa	Careful, people.

kgvOhnIraa	You can't tell it's not his cousin just by looking up the number online.  All of my cousins live 4 hours away from me, so the area they live in has absolutely nothing to do with it.  There are MAJOR trust issues in that relationship and that's what you should be worried about!|`|6vyWV0R6aa	i say you call the number dont ask him|`|SuOfRTXzaa	Call the number - or better still if you know her surname look her up in the phone book - then you can check the telephone number - without the possibility of making a fool of yourself.

I've been there before and you feel like you want to see and touch this person everyday but you can't so you want to at least know what they're up to or if they're doing something they're not supposed to but the first ingredient to any relationship, especially long distance, is trust.  You have to trust him!  That's all you guys have and he will most definitely appreciate you for giving him that.  If he is doing anything wrong just know secrets have a funny way of revealing themselves and you will find out.  But you can't concern yourself with that.  He says he loves you and you love him too.  Maybe you guys should figure out an arrangement.  Depending on how far away he lives and how much it'll cost maybe you arrange something where you see each other once or twice a month.  It's hard to find a good person in the world now days so nurture the relationship you have already and be happy.  Good luck girl!<br>  B

Laugh about it or whatever and go on. Just don't worry about what other people think so much. I know your probably in High School or whatever and it seems like a big deal but just think. All those people you go to school with won't even be there in X amount of years. Talk to people more go to the salon and get a hair cut, go get some new clothes. Just do something different with yourself that will make you feel better, even if no one else says anything at least you feel better about yourself you know. Just keep your head up and don't sweat the small stuff.  God didn't put you on the earth to impress anyone besides yourself.

So you just have to know that you'll attract good and honest people. This sort of people don't care about looks,hotness and these SHALLOW stuff. They only care about your personality. So if you're a good person with a helpful and fun character then expect to know more people that good-looking but shallow people. Don't just waste your time trying to find out if you're cute or not, because those who care don't matter and those who don't care matter..My motto..Realistic, isn't it? cheer up, Good luck =]

Mogd1Ltgaa	Most likely she does. From what you say, she sounds shy so maybe start talking to her and asking her questions about herself to get a conversation going and make her seem less nervous. She probably feels like an idiot being all quiet around you, but I'm sure she just doesn't know how not to be. When someone is hugging her, she probably looks at you to see if you are looking and what your expression is. She probably doesn't want it to seem like she likes him and wants to know if you look jealous. So, basically if you like her do all of that. Plus, when you talk to her don't act all cool and perfect, that might make her seem more insecure. So, tell something stupid or embarrassing about yourself at least one time. Like when you tripped or fell, i don't know.|`|LHxDNIWGaa	YES......

Good luck!|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	Yeah it's possible for him to like you...but only because it's not impossible. That's kind of a dumb question to ask. From my point of view I would say he likes you as a friend, considering he only glances at you and doesn't talk to you anymore. You guys were just the "in-class" friends. Which means now that you don't have any classes together, you guys don't talk.|`|kbkbDhwLaa	It's possible that he likes you, but it's impossible for us to tell. The fist thing is of no importance. The looking at you can either be completely normal, or he could like you so subconciously stares. We'd need more to go on to even begin to speculate as to whether or not he likes you.|`|nIl5EENdaa	Well it might be possible, If he just looks at you then he might just be checking out on what your'e doing. But there's a slight chance that he might not like you because if he was in the hall with you and that other guy, then he prolly would've talked to you and him in the hallway.|`|98LDN0Quaa	i think you might be over reacting..when i see someone i know and i like them be it friend or otherwise..i say "hi"..maybe you should suck it up and be the first to say hi.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	It's possible but if you don't talk to him anymore he probably won't be interested long.

She might act either louder if she's with friends or she might be quieter when she's by herself. It all depends on her personality. <br>  You should make the first move and talk to her!

xJBJn6dOaa	so basically you haven't seen or heard from him since before Valentine's Day? That's not a good sign... especially since that was over two weeks ago and he never called last week. I would let it go, because it sounds like he may have lost interest for whatever reason. since you weren't going out officially, He probably just chickened out and didn't feel the need to be honest with you.|`|EnODJeIcaa	He's probably either balancing his relationship with you with other girls and the other girl/s took precedent on Valentines Day...or he decided he doesn't really like you all that much and instead of telling you...he is ducking the problem by ignoring you and leading you along.<br>  <br>  Either he is afraid of any sort of commitment...which means you shouldn't bother with him...or you're just another play thing and he had more important people to attend to.<br>  <br>  I only say it this way because I've seen it and I've played the part...he may have a girl that he has known for a long time and she takes precedence...<br>  <br>  But ultimately he is blowing you off for whatever reason and instead of showing that you are strong and courageous and unwilling to be treated like that...you're wondering what you did wrong..and why is he mad at you.<br>  <br>  Just accept that it wasn't a good match...at least he is showing you this early instead of dragging you through two years of on again off again crap...COUNT YOUR LOSSES WHICH ARE NONE AND MOVE ON.|`|O0pYOOpAaa	There are so many reasons why.

If you tried, you'd find it difficult to define, and your definition would probably NOT be someone else's definition of love.

How so? A conversation would a great way to start. Find out about him so you can strategize more securely and effectively on how to flirt with him and ultimately lead onto the road of a relationship if thats what you're looking for. Love is full of risks, and sometimes they are necessary for being "stealthy" or more commonly known "surprising and bold." <br>  <br>  Choice B, find out, isn't as recommended because its likely that he'll find out and really you wouldn't know if he would be intimidated or otherwise.

That guy who likes you is probably the same as me.|`|j4PwaY5Jaa	i dont think he likes you i think he loves you try to talk to him just stop him in the hall and say hey i dont wanna sound dumb but i notice that you look at me alot and i wanted to know if we could hang out as friends sometime|`|kdBhSqqfaa	I don't think he does, it sounds like he might just be annoyed by you.<br>  <br>  Answer mine? <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Atydk5tQY_joP5qQiVQh_WXAFQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090227121515AA4BmXE">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|bbHoF5jsaa	He likes you!  But is too afraid to say anything...He is afraid you might not like him back.|`|8LUm74jvaa	yea i think so..|`|EmOIkLCSaa	may b he wants to know u better..<br>  go talk to him n find out...
MXMMlSJPaa	yes with my husband.GOD gave me a thoughtful man to love|`|4m9Hewq1aa	Not yet, but oh...I have high hopes<br>      If only he could see how much I care for him...|`|stBzl9Nfaa	iT Depends on what the term "lovE" means to you.
MXMMlSJPaa	It is better be with someone else by that your life will be completely satisfied.|`|8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	that's totally subjective...
yBTTPsbNaa	Yes! Don't give up on him!! and Pray!|`|USgWGqgAaa	I really wouldn't know. The best thing is to pray that he will pull through. There was someone I knew who was in a coma for like three weeks and he pulled through. <br>  I hope this helps.|`|YzaBbEpXaa	The best thing you can do is believe in him. Believe that he can surpass this, and he can. The mind can do wonders. Talk to him, even though he's not there. When my great grandmother was in a coma, I would talk to her at night. I told her that she could come out of this. that she was strong. that I believed in her. She came out of it. She was strong and surpassed a miracle. Do the same thing for your friend.<br>  <br>  I really do hope that I helped. I'm very sorry that you have to go through this, but I believe in your friend, and I believe in you. I know things will go well for you if you really want it. I believe in your miracle ^_^|`|ZcjhvBp5aa	i feel sooooooooooooooooo sorry for you but he could live through this it was just a taser.
sIQHbjLfaa	I would be frustrated a little because since you guys have been going out for a while, maybe he wants to know if you really love him by having sex with him.  I totally understand what you mean by people saying that he just wants you for sex...if he has been going out with you for that long, he wouldnt just be using you.  Maybe you should have a good talk with him.  Don't just blow this relationship because of him pressuring you to have sex.  I would suggest you ask him to hang out one day and just talk about you not ready to have sex.  i wish you the best of luck.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Break up with him.<br>  He is sex driven. <br>  Wait til he is more mature.<br>  <br>  Please do not have sex you are too young to deal with the consequences.<br>  Sex will ruin your life.|`|a2Cd3ezwaa	he needs to go.  this dude is a jealous looser who just wants sex, sex, and more sex.    you don't deserve him|`|JQjs3cB3aa	well why is he pushing you now??<br>  <br>  you're only 14 for gods sake!!|`|mjWHOUhUaa	Well he is saying that just so you would feel sorry for him.<br>  He wants you to have sex with him because probabley his buddies are bragging about them that they had sex and your boyfriend does not want to be a looser or he wants to brag to his friends, there are lots of reasons.  Perhaps you can tell him how you feel about sex and maybe if he waits till certain period of time then, just dont do something you would regret later!<br>  Paul<br>  Sorry if no help!!|`|fZWH4ioPaa	well this is what u can tell him say im fuc*en 14 years old and too young and i dont want to get accidently pregnat because of u do u want to be taking care of a child      and i think he is just telling u that ur having sex with other guys cuz i think he is trying for u to prove it 2 him and he just doin that to bugg   <br>  <br>  <br>  and he must be a really horny guy for wanting to have sex at age 14|`|3fV6zRlJaa	bc he's trying to use reverse pyschology. he thinks u'll be like "no I havent and I'll prove it."  Dont be stupid, he is a jerk and he sounds like he doesnt have any respect for u and he's pressuring u and that is never the way to get into sex. Sex is a HUGE step!! DONT DO IT little one =) lol|`|Qhyovyj8aa	Get rid of him. If he can't learn to respect you, he doesn't deserve you. He sounds like a jerk to me.|`|7pYyXSBUaa	Eff this guy! You need to dump him!<br>  It sounds like you are not ready at all to have sex with him... He sounds<br>  like a douche bag! Don't give him what he want's because you will REGRET IT!!|`|6ycnSoaRaa	this may be way out of my league but here goes... I've had a chosen abortion and it was the hardest thing( mentally and physically) that I have ever done in my life. When I was in there awaiting the dreaded procedure.... there was a little girl in there with her aunt, I thought that it was the aunt getting the surgery done..... after my procedure( I was first) the young girl came into the recovery room with me and curled up with me on the couch.... I just so happened to ask how old she was and she was your age.... It broke my heart to do what I did and I was 22...... it killed me moreso to see a beautiful young girl( much like yourself) having to go through that as well. Please do yourself a favor.... wait. It's honestly not all it's cracked up to be anyways. Wait until your older- it will prevent you from a lot of heartache. Be smart and dump that loser.... nothin and nobody is worth losing that to right now. Wait until you know that it's right and feel no pressure with someone that respects your decisions. good luck sweetie- and if you still wanna chat, my email is jennifer.brown@scbtonline.com. GOOD LUCK!!!|`|nqkUrVTraa	wow i hate say this but the only way to get him to stop is to have sex wit him. buh please dont do it unless YOU want to. and if he cant understand maybe hes not right for you??|`|yV8fog7Paa	he only wants you for sex.<br>  dump him.|`|Is3pmbbKaa	Tell him if he keeps accusing you and forcing you to have sex then dump him straight out. No explanation needed, this guy's a ********.
8PvqsOt8aa	He is busy or he got the wrong number and has been texting a stranger.|`|DcrI9zmkaa	Did you tell him that you were unable to respond to his text any earlier?  It could be he's embarrassed because he doesn't think you return his feelings.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Sounds like he might be busy with other things or other people.
4juunPpoaa	Make a move, let him know your intrested and get to know him. If he shows hes intrested take things further, if hes not intrested then back off and let your friends make a move.
Cl4kOAemaa	I think its best to wait. Some time its best to have a good friendship first until you feel its right to go to the next level. I have found out that starting a relationship first is not a good idea, because it always ends people heart broken. Just go with friendship first then take it to the next level. ;)
AxydfiIHaa	that sounds like he's shy, maybe he's nervous to call and nervous to see you if you guys don't hangout that much. try calling him instead and eventually he'll start calling you after a while. try to talk to him about his shyness if you're starting to get annoyed with it.|`|ch8DC4z7aa	I don't know , he sounds strange but think about it properly, if he really is that shy ,do you really want to be with  a guy who is THAT shy and unsure about himself. Confidence is a very attractive thing|`|B9KdOxMSaa	He likes you and respects you very much. You may have to make the moves if you want any physical contact.|`|KHtf2pDKaa	he sounds like hes just very shy.hes with you so he must like you.but he sounds very shy|`|lzooHi0Baa	What in the world was it that attracted you to this shy,non affectionate, unable to initiate any physical contact nor have eye contact individual,?   The fact that he drives 40 miles can mean a lot of things.   Loneliness and inacceptance by the rest of the crowd and finding someone that can put up with his presence, and make him laugh, could be one.   I do not even find him fun to be with, if nothing else.   Stop trying to make him something he is not, you sound a bit insecure yourself.    Focus on yourself before goint dating again.
n01WYIl3aa	YES! i would definantly tell her to go see her doctor. You have no idea what kind of bacteria is in that water. I know for sure that there is one that swims up bodily fluid into the body. NO BUENO!!!<br>  <br>  she needs to go get checked out!!!|`|nVdYIHhzaa	i know when a guy and a girl have sex underwater it hurts the girl pretty bad but as long as the water was clean you should be fine|`|ZlgRne3caa	Having sex in water is bad for a female in the first place. Needless to say that sex in a lake would be worse for her. It's possible for her to get a disease... My advice would be not to do it again. Also, if you want to take extra precaution she could go see her doctor.<br>  <br>  Best of luck =)
1BVyYudTaa	hello erinc,????<br>  <br>   i dont know who is he dying to find out.you can just have it go to my profile and send me mail,but dont ask the mail address.i am not allowed to provide it,but you can send me private messgages through the mail allowed here in my profile.??i am sorry.??<br>  <br>  <br>  all thee best.!????|`|xJS3BdUNaa	Here I am!<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm a mystery sweetheart. hahaha<br>  <br>  I'm not giving you my real email address either.  For all I know your some fat, balding, middleaged dude stalking me from his mother's basement...  ha ha.
tluT02tvaa	What would you do if you caught your boyfriend checking out your mom ? - I honestly would be a bit grossed out,he can check out whoever he wants..just don't dare do it front of me.<br>  <br>  Say your boyfriend was in the shower and you got on his computer to check you mail and found that he left open a racist website, you click on it and found racist postings by him? Would you just leave or what?<br>  -I would bothered by that type of behavior,racism is hate without a valid reason,he could easily shift his hate unto me and my family,and thats not the type of boyfriend i want.<br>  <br>  Say that hott guy finally asked you out and on the date you discover that he has terrible table manners, what would you do or say?<br>  -I wouldn't try to correct him.thats what his mom was for,if she failed to train him right,than no reason for me to even attempt a try.He should have good manners naturally.<br>  <br>  And lastly, what are some of your worst dating experiences? Anything bad or terrible happen on a date?  -Nothing i can think of..besides a man not being too talkative..a silent date,is not much of a date imo.<br>  Its our only chance of getting to know one another and you only get one first impression..i like guys who speak up.
GEfUTyi8aa	You didnt do anything creepy .... but you should have tried to find out if she was single or not..... because if she isnt, she didnt take the flowers home, how could she.  She might not know who you are .... they see so many people at the bank all the time......  and for sure you havent creeped out the whole bank.   You can still go there and not worry, if anything some of the women will think highly of you as chivalry is no longer part of main stream dating (and its too bad because its nice and shows alot about someone).<br>  <br>  I think what you did was nice.... now all you can do is ask her if she liked the flowers .... if she is uncomfortable then just say, look I just wanted to be nice, I hope you enjoyed them.  And leave it at that.   <br>  <br>  I have read other posts of yours and you are giving me the impression you are out there looking for someone... almost desperate.   You need to chill out and relax..... let things come around naturally.... they will you know... I always find if your out looking for it, it doesnt happen..... so just back off for awhile..... be a nice guy.. open doors for women..... let them go first ..... smile say hello but just leave it at that..... one day one will talk to you first and you wont have to worry so much about what these women think.  I sense you put yourself out there too much, become too vulnerable..... dont do that..... you can be nice and a gentleman but not a doormat.... dont give off a desperate signal either.....<br>  <br>  Again, dont worry about this, you did nothing wrong, it was sweet.... its your bank, you can go there all you want.... and I dont think people there think your a stalker.... just a guy who thinks an employee is interesting... but dont do anything else... balls in her court.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|8PvqsOt8aa	No man go back, what is the worst that can happen. In life there are no second chances, if you do not do it, you will think about it the rest of your life and wonder what would of happened had you done it. Go for it man|`|FJZIvANFaa	Thats not creepy, go back.|`|A4LcPy9haa	Go back|`|cq3FtZCuaa	if some random dude sent me flowers..i would be creeped out at first. but then ill be like aww, thats sweet. like someone actually took their time out to send me flowers? but dont be afraid to talk to her and ask her out on a small simple date. you never know if you dont try! lol rejection is the worst feeling in the world emotionally..in my opinion. but life is always about taking a risk. if she's not interested in you..there's plenty of fish in the sea! (;|`|NlYGbqnkaa	Don't be embarrassed at all. I would go back and be really loud and obvious. I would ask her out really loud so everyone could hear. She will laugh and be embarrassed herself. She won't be able to say no. Just have her meet you somewhere like a dinner or something where there are alot of people around.|`|QHQUkiC5aa	go back, if she rejects you, at least your not like in school or anything and u see here eveyrday, its just on fridays, and you can always change banks.<br>  she probably thought the flowers were sweet though, not stalkerish.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkDZnYpStvWfXTUdX09FLLrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227162001AAr4l9q">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|AA10776626	Guys are rarely romantic anymore.

Just let it go until you hear about her.<br>  <br>  Thanks for your answer of my question.<br>  Cheers buddy|`|mBczFuLmaa	Well....doing that and not even knowing her status definitely took guts!  But it's sweet that you think enough of her.  I say go back when she's there and this time talk to her....you got to start somewhere right?  Scary I know, but you obviously have the guts!|`|Oqf65Cisaa	Go back to the bank <br>  tell her it was you that sent the flowers, tell her that you have noticed her alot and wonderd if she wanted to go for a drink or something after work. <br>  ;)<br>  <br>  <br>  xx|`|cPROMMgqaa	That's not creepy it all. It's really cute! :) <br>  Go back. You'll regret it if you don't.|`|GW9cETg5aa	Go back for sure! If someone sent me flowers at work I'd think it was so sweet.<br>  If you go in every week, then I'm sure she's seen you before and has a general idea of who you are. Girls absolutely love this kind of stuff but not enough guys do it!<br>  Just keep going to the bank and doing what you normally do and if she's there go up to her and just start talking about her. Ask her how her day as been and just be really interested in what she has to say. :]|`|WCPqMcFNaa	Guess what? She knows you like her. and I bet she smiled like hell when she heard you stopped by the bank, just like she did when she got the flowers.But have you checked if she is single? other than that GO for it baby. Don't be too shy be decisive.
7oZt0hodaa	no. I think chicks of any height can be hot. It's all about how they carry themselves.|`|LcOPL8gCaa	Well i'm gonna list for a guy:<br>  Height has to be taller than me<br>  Eyes: Green<br>  Hair: Brown / black<br>  skin: Light brown (tan)<br>  Hair length: short army buzz.<br>  <br>  ha ha that's my fiance. He's italian, green eyes, his hair is dark brown but almost black, he is in the army has the hair cut too ( I gave it to him ) he is light tan but dark at the same time. Hard to explain, he's taller than me by a long shot... like 6 more inch. <br>  <br>  but i just like that i can rest my head on his chest when standing or laying down. Can't have someone shorter than me lol.|`|OF7ZHq19aa	Shorter women are cuter|`|oDLdqrJfaa	nope.....unless they are really tall or really short.|`|nZk0oKvTaa	no, not really|`|PDAVQU3Caa	not really, but i dont like a girl that is taller than me haha|`|m4xLigxdaa	I'm 24 years old and only 5'4.  most guys love that i'm little!|`|Qe95LNxYaa	when i see one that i like i let you know|`|vBcqzMz4aa	Im 6'2 so its hard to find a girl taller then me, but if she was way taller or way shorter then me it's kind of a turn off.<br>  To me, I think girls with red hair and black hair are crazy hot.<br>  I dont mind their eye color to be honost...<br>  Skin color?

8d672c3b130959e0280953077c21f82caa	my bestfriend is likee that too. i hate it. i miss hanging out with her a whole lots. but just try to talk to your friend and tell her how you feel about her boyfriend && maybe she will understand.|`|b7yvPsiVaa	Talk to her now before the problem gets worse. Let her know that you care about her alot and what you think about this guy and how much it bothers you that she leaves you for him all the time. <br>  But TALK to her, don't just send her a note because she might take a note the wrong way.<br>  Hopefully she will make the right choice and stop paying so much attention to the jerk and atleast juggle time with you more. But if she STILL completely choses the jerk over you reguardless of how you felt, then she wasn't much of a friend to start with anyway.|`|NQwEcBgRaa	first....its HOES BEFORE BROS! i think you should confront her and tell her how you feel. i mean your best friends. she will understand. and just tell her what you noe about the guy in a way that wont make her mad. and just tell her that you really dont want to lose your guys' friendship. <br>  hope this helps (:|`|pjDzsN5Saa	I think that you should call her and like go to the movies or the mall, just the two of you.  Then you can tell her how you feel that her bf is getting in the way of your friendship, also that you don't like him.  That has happened to me once except it was with my friend and a new girl, she spent a whole lot of time with her and i could barely talk to her then she came over and i told her what I was feeling and now she spends time with me as much as she spends with the other girl.  Try that and it might help.
gSqpAoFEaa	Haha..this kinda brings back memories because I was the man in between 2 women and I got props from my male peers for being able to balance both women, ironically they had the same mutual friends and used to be friends themselves. From my experience it's not just about the getting the guy it's about showing other people that you can get "that guy"! So I feel it's more of an ego subject! Hope it helped somewhat!<br>  David|`|EdidZdtlaa	um i think that when the two women are fighting they are just trying to get some of there anger out. they should be thinking something like i wanna beat this girl up so bad or something. when your fighting physically theres not really anything going through there head. but verbally they are just like i wanna beat this girl up really bad. this is what i got from my friends when they were fighting over boys which is very stupid. hope i helped.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	I never had a physical fight with a woman.  But I've been cheated on before.<br>  <br>  Scenarios:<br>  <br>  Spoke with the chick who said she didn't know about me, i believed her - I was mad at him not her.  End of story<br>  <br>  Scenario 2:  Spoke with the chick who decided to call me names, saying I was stupid blah blah.  If she was in my presence at the time she would have been slapped with a hammer.<br>  <br>  My reaction to #2 was different of course I was mad at him.  But in the end, she was disrespectful and thought it was okay to date someone who was in a relationship.<br>  <br>  There is also the fact that she chose to disrespect me.  I just think that its a bit "unladylike" to date someone in a relationship, and personally  its a betrayal of womanhood.  <br>  <br>  Quite frankly you can't be mad if he cheats on you as well - women complain about how evil men are - yet some of them promote their ways - isn't that stupid?|`|BvCyIbLsaa	they probably thinking that  the guy wants one or the other they don't want to share but personally i think they some what think like guys like am i not good enough for here what does he have that i don't im better looking then you|`|Qe95LNxYaa	i would get a lawn chair a video camera a beer sit back and enjoy the show while you can|`|AFx0PCGvaa	NONSENSE

5b0db6044dc593b04f841e4679fd4a16aa	Get into a heated argument with him. Act like your on the verge of throwing something at him. and then kiss him straight on the lips and walk away. Leave him stunned with something to think about.|`|JQCi0L1oaa	wow, this sounds just like me. i too am in 8th grade. i was also in your same area of problems. okk so yes he likes you hes just afraid of showing it because he doesnt want others to know how he may feel about you. all my friends were like you and so and so would look so cute together and i thought the same thing and he used to flirt with me all the time. no he loves to "dis" me. and he now does it constantly. so i played along and did it back to him. and one day he pulls me aside and says im sorry for being mean to you, the truth is i really like you. i was so happy and sortive knew it all along now me and mr.dis man are dating and its all good. i have a feeling that your going through the same thing. give it some time and sortive ignore him and laugh when he makes fun of you. because now he likes that its bugging you. anyways give it some time and he'll come around. good luck:))|`|XpHpeRGAaa	Honey, I am so sorry you have one of these in your life. <br>  <br>  Even if he likes you, there is no point in wasting your time with him. <br>  <br>  As an 8th grader, he has raging testosterone issues, like all boys that age, that make him act aggressively and also may give him confusing feelings of attraction with aggression at the same time. <br>  <br>  However, if he really did like you, he would be nicer more of the time than he is mean. <br>  <br>  I would take him aside to a private area where no one can hear or see the two of you clearly, do not make a scene be subtle. The set up is crucial, you do not want to attract the attention of his friends or your friends. <br>  <br>   Ask him if you could have a truce and simply be cordial to each other. Explain that he is distracting your studies and that you think he is a nice enough guy, and that you apologize if you gave him any impression that you appreciate his negative attention, and that you would be so relieved if you could both just be friendly, not even friends but just simply cordial and respectful of each other.<br>  <br>  Resist all temptation to chat and gossip about this conversation. I know that is difficult for you, but if you do you will ruin any possible outcome by creating rumors. Ask him to keep the conversation between the two of you before you go into your brief (very brief schpiel) to avert gossip. Explain that you will each have a better time at school if you could each be respectful of each other.|`|uOihCBDHaa	There are two possible cases.<br>  1) yes, he likes you and is just annoying you for the attention. i mean, he agreed with your teacher that you looked good today and he asked your friend if you like him<br>  2) or maybe he's not too crazy and is just really insane.|`|SjD1aKT5aa	Let him go hun, he's not worth your time and you've got plenty of time :)<br>  <br>  :] Kiki|`|FHjLB6v2aa	Does he like you? Well it sure seems like it. If not, he seems like he has a thing for you. Do you act like you like him? Or does he know? Because if you don't act like you like him then maybe the reason that he's always trying to annoy you instead of show you that he likes you is probably because he doesn't know if you like him and he doesn't want to get rejected. He probably does like you, he's just to shy to tell you, so instead he tries making it like it's not obvious (although it totally is) and makes fun of you so that maybe people won't know that he actually likes you. Idk why, but guys seem to do this instead of showing their actual feelings.
31e3060541ec106d948e7080f42a5032aa	for me its holding hands you hug everyone else but you dont hold their hand|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Neither!  My boyfriend and I have been together nearly two years, and we still hold hands when we go out, and we always hug.  (And we're in our 20s and 30s, lol!)  So it doesn't have to die out if you don't want it to!|`|qsZPkbF2aa	It depends on the person. The women I have dated usually hugged me first before wanting to hold my hand.|`|uh6vbixmaa	Sexing it up!|`|JWMTtKjsaa	well any one of them can go first but i started holding hands. <br>  hope this is helpful
Jsxv8WUsaa	I know what you mean!  Maybe it's just the attraction of them... I don't think it's possibly to know if you like someone unless you talk to them because you need to know them in order to know if you like them!!!|`|T0dPL9wBaa	I know what you mean-- the guy I'm seeing right now, when I first met him, well I would never in a million years have guessed that it would end up like this.<br>  <br>  But there is such a thing as instant attraction. Sometimes you see someone and just feel really attracted to them. And there's also the fact that sometimes, you don't really have to talk to someone to know what they're like... though it sure as hell helps.<br>  <br>  I'm sure that lots of girls (or guys) who have liked someone from afar have been sorely disappointed upon first meeting their huge crush.<br>  <br>  So yes... hope I shed some light.|`|WCKbUvjHaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227121256AAMgwdK">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|AA12088442	yeh... its weird... and annoying :)|`|ff545BLyaa	I have a very simple answer for you.  It seems to me that the people asking those questions are either in 6-9th grade.  They are just kids and its like puppy love.  Just leave it alone.  they don't really know what they feel and usually its just a physical attraction.  Anyone older asking a question like that needs to grow up and stop acting like a child.  Its all about maturity level.|`|LiZir5Jiaa	i completely understand how u feel, because i feel the same way! i might think a guy is attractive, but cant say i like him until i get to kno him...i think ppl say they like someone in the loose sense of that they like their looks, and their personality based on how they act around other ppl|`|Un9CElCaaa	i dont know either. that makes no sense to me. i only like girls once i get to know them. i cant just look at a girl and say she's hot i have a crush on her. she might be a b****h. people that say this stuff are naive and immature|`|Ix2eWrswaa	they probably like the way they carry themselves or they see them in class and the way they act but just dont have enough courage to talk to them|`|YtDp0wjdaa	lol ya!! i wonder that 2
wW6NJk4jaa	I think you need to be honest with the guy and tell him the real reason, he'll be mad at you at first but if you want the other guy than you have to, otherwise his friend could tell him that you just said you liked him too
2KJvaWDYaa	1. yes he likes u he keeps asking u out!! how else can he possibly let u know he likes u?!<br>  2. ur friend sounds like a bit of a cow saying 'he doesnt like u he is embarressed of you' clearly if he was he wouldnt b telling everyone ur his GF. shes jealous<br>  3. he does sound like a bit of a creepy player though...i personally wouldnt date him but that just me.<br>  3. nxt time u ask a question make it much shorter more ppl will answer and put some punctuation in it that was like one giant sentence.<br>  4. u r not a loser dont tell urself that!!!<br>  <br>  good luck
KlRsBt5waa	The fact that there was a gun in the first place should be making the alarm bells in your head go off like crazy. I don't believe that people should remain together if another one goes to jail because...they're in jail and you are going to be putting your life on hold for someone else. Your life is going to continue while his stays in prison. That's no life for you to live!|`|ADP9swbMaa	No.|`|AA11131788	Yes, you should support him.
VUR8hhiTaa	I met my boyfriend on <a href="http://wwwsinglesnet.info" rel="nofollow">http://wwwsinglesnet.info</a><br>  It took about a month, and he showed interest in me. I registered for a lot of different ones, and didn't like most. This one is the best so far, and the best thing is it is free!|`|sgRDJUXqaa	I've done the online dating thing several times, and I've never been scammed.  Everyone has been who they said they were.  None of those relationships worked out, but that doesn't mean that online dating is bad.  It's not really different from meeting someone in person.  They might not be the business CEO making six figures like they say they are.|`|JCdBSULraa	I've met probably close to 50 girls through online dating, I only met about 10 face-to-face.   Of those, only one had been deceptive about her appearance, and I only fell for two of them (but they didn't work out of course).  I've never been scammed, but there was one scary girl who was married at age 18 to some thug who threatened to hunt me down (she never told me she was married).  I guess that's as close to a scam as I got.   <br>  Also, true.com, match.com, chemistry.com, and other pay sites are arguably scams in and of themselves, I'd avoid them like the plague.|`|AA12272251	I would not say cheated or scammed, But I have been on online dating services and have had no luck. However I am a very picky person. I have given up, maybe, I am thinking of trying millionaire matchmaker. If I can't find love maybe I will find money. lol joking but, not really.
XXbZAriNaa	the other guy will surely come round to a sensible way of thinking, sounds like a good night out to me and good value for ￡1
lNlL0Ag2aa	Remember that all girls typically follow that rule that they should wait for the guy to approach them and let the guy do all the chasing (unfair but true). <br>  <br>  So you need to be confident and bold and go up to a girl upfront and tell her straightfoward that you want her to be your girl. Girls, especially if they were secretly crushing on you, will start crushing on you even more when they see how you're confident and bold.<br>  <br>  They love it also that you're trying to get the girl you want because (like us guys) they love to see that a guy is into them and is showing that they're interested in them. It's a huge turn on for them so when you approach girls, as long as they were physically interested in you, they will love your confident personality.
dduBFkLkaa	go to a scary movie...and when u get to the scary parts then snuggle up...haha that gives an excuse to be right by him..say ur scared haha|`|N4xd99Qaaa	Any movie will be fine. Just keep staring at each other and kiss.

FHjLB6v2aa	Well you don't want to just jump right into anything just yet.  Drop her more hints.  Ask her out for dinner or a movie or maybe just to eat at a fast food restaurant and walk around a park or something or a picnic.  Then when you have sometime alone with her, make her laugh and get close to her face, smile, and kiss her.  =]|`|RvXADXZtaa	i think she already has an idea that you like her when you sent her a valentine. im in the process of asking someone out too and everyone is telling me to go for it so i think you should to. <br>  <br>  if you live near a movie cinema, take her to the movies and then ask her if she wants lunch(if there are any places around to have lunch. not a 4 star restaurant but something simple like kfc, McDonalds, Subway etc. and make sure YOU pay). after movies and lunch take her home and tell her you had fun today and you hope she did too and you want to do it again some time.<br>  <br>   if you know her well give her a hug and then as you pull away give her little kiss on the cheek.  make sure your holding her hand and when you turn to walk away you kind of reach out to her as if you dont want to let go. and make sure your gentle.  and this way you dont need to ask her out. if she says yes to everything then youve got a gf. oh almost forgot-make her laugh and if you know her well enough maybe tickle her a bit, just lightly though, make it sexy (maybe run your hand down her side then hold her around the waist as you walk or around her shoulder.)<br>  <br>  hope this helped. ShyGuy|`|T0dPL9wBaa	She probably knows you like her.<br>  Go in for a kiss.
TXAwV8aRaa	trust me he doesn't hate you he's just using that as an excuse to say no after you asked him out. probably something went wrong that you did that caused him to say that but he got over...so don't stress he doesn't hate and neither should you hate him|`|zY7boFYNaa	Well, probably the guy was not ready for that move, you know if you haste things--it will not be in a gradual pace, and probably just wants to get to know you better, and maybe later on he will see, but do not worry, just do not let any guy take advantage of you :)|`|t5ro0HB7aa	maybe he can't date or just got out of a relationship, he probably likes you though.  So just give it time and be friends for a while and then later on try making a move?|`|UZodNAOkaa	I think the thing is that he likes you but he either isn't ready to show his feelings or that he's just not sure if he likes you or not mabye hes confused emotionally.|`|LniiejFOaa	Maybe he just wants to flirt and not date.<br>  <br>  Answer this please:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnFNi_hf8eIylnTJkK5EhwLsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225181718AAD72U9">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|zmWotb1taa	i think he is afraid!|`|QSrS3bZgaa	wtf|`|8PvqsOt8aa	He likes you allot but does not know how to handle what he is feeling, you scare him. You need to wait until he feels more comfortable with you, then you can move into a deeper relationship, or move on and find someone who wants to be with you and can handle his feelings, and that is another thing, he may act like this for life and you need to think about that, do you want to deal with that the rest of your life.|`|8OIYdgwKaa	i dont think he likes you hun, if he said he hates you then he cant be very into you. maybe your just reading too much into it. x|`|noChNWX1aa	He is playing with yours emotions. You can play with has emotions or find someone else. Good luck.|`|kzWYi5OIaa	Typical guy. He obviously likes you. Hes just afraid to admit he likes you.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	If he said no then he doesn't like you that way.  He may have been joking about hating you but he doesn't want to date you.|`|fQVM8OHmaa	The exact same thing is happening to me.  I think he likes you but doesn't want to admit it.|`|yciUf6nMaa	If he was shy, then he would have said yes.<br>  But seriously, that isn't how it goes.<br>  A boy asks the girl out, not the other way around.|`|B5EgyPlpaa	i do think he likes you he probably said no because he is scared to let anyone know. do it when you are alone with him and ask what he means.|`|NYEQf7qkaa	it depends<br>  if hes a player type of guy<br>  then its just him<br>  he likes to flirt with any girl he can find.<br>  if he flirts with a girl doesnt mean he has  a major crush<br>  hope i helped..|`|EZvnyVF2aa	He probably thinks of you as a friend not a girlfriend.|`|kEcFWz6Xaa	Maybe he is just a flirt, I have flirted with cute guys that I would never go out with because they weren't my type.|`|qmMCGKl9aa	your coming on too strong.<br>  usually guys are the ones that like to do the chasing.<br>  <br>  so just fall back .|`|JizwgEiYaa	u seem confused... ill pray for u|`|elfIbUCmaa	if he hated you in the first place, i'd just give up from there.
P7HdSzhKaa	Good question.<br>  <br>  Basically, it is a big circle, i believe.<br>  <br>  i dont really prefer the terms "black" or "white".<br>  <br>  but Black men believe that some black women are exactly what society describes them as mostly...i wont say it..but you know. So black men alternate to other races.<br>  <br>  i am open to any race as long as the woman is true and an angel..<br>  <br>  Black women aslo believe what society says about most black men, which is...you know...premiscuous..therefore they too alternate.<br>  <br>  i am not jealous of a white man with a black woman. love is what love is.<br>  <br>  but people cannot help what society says...unless they change themselves despite it all.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  but i wont lie...some people get offened either way the ying yang sign goes..<br>  <br>  but i think it is good to mix things up..learn about other cultures by sharing tha love with another race..<br>  <br>  we are all human. "taste the rainbow" hahaha|`|q1pwHXrMaa	I whole heartily believe love is blind. <br>  <br>  It doesn't matter about race, religion, ethnicity, your anything else. The only thing that matters is that you want to be with that person.<br>  <br>  End.|`|4KvcuvtCaa	black guys aren't my fave, but white guys would get offended if i dated black guys.|`|POHWTDPRaa	Doesn't matter to me either way. It's not my business who dates who or what color either of them are. Why be offended by something that doesn't affect me?|`|4HoVVCenaa	I'm okay with it either way. Makes no difference to me.
lnWvaRWBaa	Unless her life long dream is to be a pornstar you might want to keep your fantasies to yourself and let her live a normal life.

y4JrDSLUaa	If a woman is beautiful and stuck-up, ie. she criticizes other women on their looks, feels "superior" to them, etc., then she is an emotional Tower of Pisa. What I mean by that is she is so concerned with how others perceive her, that she feels the need to put down other women in order to feel good about herself. So on the inside, she is a shaky, insecure little girl. However, her feelings of "superiority" are very real: a woman can genuinely convince herself that she is "worth" more than others.<br>  <br>  In contrast, a truly beautiful woman inside-and-out is secure with herself, and in fact appreciates the beauty in every single other person she meets.|`|8vbUOxjxaa	Well I am one of those people sometimes but just towards guys. I have a good reason to be. I am actually really bubbly and friendly and well good looking and my ex's alwasy got really mad about it. Maybe they weer jealous but even my familly said i am very flirtatious. I really think i am just friendly but what ever. So to save my present very deep reltaionship, I have made the note to be more snobbish. Plus, I was getting really annoyed at all the pereveted old men or people i didnt want to attract alwasy though i like them if i look at them or something. Like I though I would be nice to them you know, but than theyjust like follow you and get all creepy. I dont need them. I just want to spread the good attitude around. NOw i just act happy and pretty much am, but dont relly look unless (they are not looking) and or they are in my circle at the time..like a store clerk or airport attendent. And those truley deeply snobbish people might have really tight parents that were tin the army or something  are just like that. dont worry about them. maybe they do think they are better(or just say that and feel very insecure)..either way. It is good to give a bit of a cold shoulder in this world to stangers. You never know who they are. and if they are a future husband..now he can do abit of chasing and not have you give yourself to him so easily..fun for both! I hope I helped.|`|AA11223515	its true|`|6q86rICnaa	Usually insecurity. It's actually harder if you are good looking, because you start to think that people only like you cuz your hot. That can really mess up someones head, so they become insecure.
v8ITv3WNaa	I think you should just be honest and tell him how you feel...don't read to much into the myspace thing because it holds no truth behind it and your pretending to be someone your not on myspace. Let him know what's up and leave the ball in his court BUT beware because he has a girlfriend he could get involved with you just for sex or any other thing he can use you for because he knows that you really like him...really by letting him know how you feel...you will be able to read his actions towards you if he likes you back you will know.
pA6d7YFraa	No, i really don't think that the relationship will last because you have to have some type of communication between the both of you. It seem like both of you are some what shy. Maybe you can come up with a topic then you'll can go from there. Start off by asking " How was your day?" Or What did you do today? that should get the ball rolling. Open up to each other and let it flow.

Please note my e-mail address  mrlovechugh@yahoo.com  and  desired.lover@yahoo.com   <br>  I will find website for you, You may send me mail so I may send you link or you may find from www.google.com  <br>  I'm so happy after knowing our line is same i.e. medical line.<br>  <br>  have a nice day and nice dream.|`|TPCmwFxRaa	Im sorry. I really dont know that answer. :(
tluT02tvaa	I feel flattered since its usually hard for guys to do that..it shows me,that he trusts me and respects me enough to tell me such personal things.I listen with a very open ear.And i feel like i have accomplished something great. :)|`|uTYXxzqmaa	I think thats cute :) that he can share things like that to me|`|f0423c049434af188b8aae9a68343013aa	I think it's very sweet. <br>  <br>  As the other responder said, it's sometimes hard for guys to do that. For him to think that I'm a trustworthy person, it's a nice compliment.
FZKFLTyLaa	Be frank, and honest. Just ask :<br>  Would it offend you if I considered you as more than just a friend (or classmate)? Do you know how much I like you?<br>  I cannot understand in this age of communications why so many people have such great difficulty<br>   just speaking to one another.
f0173000dda40d230a0442e8832073d1aa	Whilst I love people that use the word "whilst"--I am saddened by the rest of your question.  He doesn't sound like a very good best friend, let alone a boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Yes, you've gone off him.  Thank the Lord and move on.<br>  <br>  Face it, he was a jerk and you can do better.|`|AA11893430	not sure.... good luck with that though|`|nptdlUUqaa	I strongly think from listening to this, that you don't have feelings for him anymore, and when he does something wrong or something stupid, even the littlest things, you instincts tell you to get annoyed with him, when really you don't! I'm sorry if you don't understand, I just can't think of a way to explain! As I don't understand what i'm saying!<br>  <br>  Hoped I have helped!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	If he is interested in your best friend he's not being true to you. If it were me, I would let him go. you deserve a man whose interested in you.|`|MuwLvbzMaa	You're just on your period.|`|SJDTElSvaa	its cuzz he's a buttface|`|qroOTyrGaa	Hi there, honestly you need to decide whether or not talking to him is healthy for you. If you constantly have that sick feeling in the pit of your stomach and he doesn't make you a better person then you probably shouldn't speak to him until your feelings are gone. You sound like a very intelligent woman, really decide if you can be friends right now because it sounds like you can't. :(|`|kEcFWz6Xaa	Well he did somethings on his part also which is not excusing your actions. I think the best thing for you to do is break up with him and get over your depression. A relationship is to stressful for you right now, I would recommend doing some social activities and working out. Both of these things will help make you feel better. I hope you recover and feel better.|`|38kFV1wTaa	Break up with him. You're clearly not happy with him... If you're thinking of staying with him and tryna make things work, it won't, he's already damaged your trust and everything that was good between you two. You'll only regret being with him months or years from now. So it'll be better if you end it now.|`|DL3DSG42aa	Ok. Why are you still with this asshole? He's obviously extremely selfish and does not repsect you. Cut him off, please. Life is way too short to waste time with someone like that. He would be dead if he did that crap to me. Find a new boyfriend and tell him to **** off.|`|d2FJBJ8baa	well you don't love him anymore and he has hurt you and you don't if you hurt him back<br>  <br>  time for you to get another bf|`|S6dM85fxaa	If he's trying to tap another well, kick him to the curb.  You don't need a cheatin bastard|`|aYCksvYXaa	ok well I'm not really sure how to answer this, and I wasn't gonna try until I saw all the stupid answers you'd gotten thus far. <br>  <br>  I would give it a little time; don't give up on him yet, if he's been your friend for like 3 years, and all this has been like 6 months, give yourself time. Esp. with family issues; you need time to rcover from that. But if he continues to anger you or you just feel like you two don't have a chance after a while, tell him. Don't try to hide your feelings from him: that will only give you more to be frusterated about. <br>  <br>  hope I helped. Good luck.|`|uvo24D2gaa	because you have bigger problems than him<br>    mayby you are jealous of him talking about your best friend<br>  you guys are not ment to be if he annoys you that much and the dude write hate lists lool <br>   and you fall out too much so you arnt bothered anymore and feel like it is a routine and it is constantly happening.<br>  <br>    duh it shows you are not interested in him because you lash out and dont give a crap<br>  <br>  tell him your family issues mayby he could suport u|`|LJpiNQiYaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Am1psMXWwPzob2RfOdHRTh7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227124626AA8LVxv">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ZxLzNWvkaa	Your not meant to be maybe..|`|oNkxVdSjaa	i say let that asshole go, he's not worth you, i hate it when men do that, they don't know how special women are..|`|XGx9WORLaa	he sounds like a loser dump him and don't talk to him again if your friend wants him let her have him she will find out he isn't worth it as he will probably start doing the same to her also if she is going for him than she isn't ur true friend move on with your life you don't need that sh*t|`|fIhC2VdXaa	well for one, you boyfriend is an asshole, why in the world would your bf try to get with your best friend? and not help you with your hard time? like he should actually be there for you and wow hes dumb. Even though you guys have been dating for 6 months this does not seem like he is close to you or likes you that much, therefore you should break up with him, if he really gives you that much rage and your starting to not care then you should end it. Hes an asshole and you can probably do a lot better than that
POHWTDPRaa	There's nothing you can do now. The dance is over. You don't have to feel stupid. Everyone gets nervous. Just say Yes next time someone asks. You don't have to be super cool or the world's greatest dancer. People go to dances to have fun. If you're having fun that will show. No one expects you to be Mr. Slick.
zVLXJcsgaa	well, i thinik that you should both make an agreement to leave each other alone for a few weeks...like no contact or anything...and then, the thing is, since you love him so much, you want to know if he loves you as well, just as strongly as you do to him.<br>  <br>  if in the period of the few weeks, he chooses someone else over you...then well, im very sorry, but it probably wasnt even worth being with him anyway.<br>  <br>  i really really hope that this works out for you. i can say that it did work for me.|`|nIl5EENdaa	Maybe you should tell him how you feel. Tell him that you love him a lot and that you don't want to be apart. Maybe you guys can stay together but try to avoid subjects that can bring up problems. Try hanging with your friends while your together. And if he REALLY loves you as you say, then you can trust him not to find anyone better than you.|`|fnytzXWTaa	They always say that the heart is stronger when away from the ones you love. I don't think its a bad idea. If you guys don't seem to love each other at the end then you don't you move on. Its the story of life. Don't worry if you been together for 2 years I don't think there's anything that will stop you two.  Now just remember if this doesn't work out then it doesn't move on with life. Just let life take you in the moments and not days!|`|7b882f43c0724ab2516a55698652a19daa	fight means love. My girlfriends fights with me because she loves me. she complains because she cares. if u dunt care anyone, u wont bother to care or fight. Right?<br>  <br>  If u love him, tel him, and tell him what u dunt like. or ask him why do they fight. any issue u both hiding? Talking is the best solution, not running away!|`|yMD13bMTaa	See the thing is when two people are in love there A lot of fighting involved trust me. yes some time apart may help but do be apart to long because that cause you to lose feelings for one another.|`|DaXu6JMDaa	well, what if you find someone better heh? just ask for it not to be open where you find other people.....more like still together but spending "me" time....we all need it|`|AA11524272	I guess it's a good idea to take a break as long as it's not a whole "vacation". A few days should be enough to give each other some time to think about the relationship. Once you have taken that break the best thing to do is to get together and talk.<br>  <br>  If you believe there is a risk of him finding someone he may like more than you then think about the same risk for him of you finding someone you may like more than him. For every relationship both guy and girl have the same rights, opportunities and risks. Whatever he may do you may do too, so that's why it is important to let him know that you want to be with him, but if he is with someone else then you automatically have the right to be with someone else too. It's not a threat, just a reality you both have to understand.<br>  <br>  My recommendation: take a short break, then talk about the relationship and most importantly, talk about the things that each one likes and dislikes about each other. Just set some basic rules before you talk: no shouting or yelling, no disrespectful words, no unnecessary remarks or tones of voice, no implied things, no reading between the lines, what-you-say-is-what-I-understand. These rules should help each other say in concrete terms how each one feels about the relationship in an objective way. Once you have talked about the good and bad things move on to the next step: make and ask for suggestions about how the bad things can be improved. Discuss the ideas and move on with the relationship, make it grow.|`|gCsD5qtyaa	A break is a good idea sometimes. I am not sure how long the break will be but maybe a few days would be good just to spend some time clearing your minds. If its weeks then I would definetly say that it is over. Not to be hurtful because I would feel the same way.|`|FSY2Mf3Vaa	If he really loves you he' ll wait for you. If he goes off with someone else straight away he obviously didnt love you as much as you loved him, and he isnt worth your tears. I know its really hard to not see someone you love but as you say your arguing all the time so you most probably do need time apart. I hope everything works out for you.x|`|0j6dO8FEaa	I dont think its a good idea.. my husband and i have been with eachother for three years and got married 3 months ago.. sometimes i sit and think  wow things have changed, we argue a lot now compared to when we first started dating, but at the end of the night i realize that through all the fighting and arguing i still love him. Things will never go back to the lovey-dovey way, but if you love some so much and you think it worth sticking through it then do it. Talk to each other, surprise him make him his favorite dinner, buy him something hes always wanted, take him somewhere both of you have wanted to go, and just talk things out the so called "breaks" are always a bad thing because that just seems you guys are gonna see other people, or just get over each other, if you really love each other you guyz will find a way to make it work. with out the "break"<br>  <br>  ps there is no such thing and happily ever after just remember that.. everyone couple has there own problems, and every couple deals with them differently.. But love is always the key to happiness.|`|cFNA6fU1aa	prolly not|`|d3585569f839ab86bd98d1228e1b5accaa	The ultimate test of love. If it was ment to be this is how you find out. Good luck.|`|lnWvaRWBaa	I feel that there is no such thing as a break and my boyfriend feels the same way too, and we have been together 2 years also. We both agree that if we're meant to be together and that we're really in love then we can work through our problems and stay together because when you get married and live together you can't really just take a break then.|`|dBrGgTVjaa	well when you guys take a break you will both change and either you change together or realize that maybe you want to do your own thing and grow apart. <br>  dont worry about him finding someone else or what he's doing. this break is for the both of you to do your own thing, so if you dont change the relationship you want eventually, it might end up being the same fighting situation as it just was... <br>  focus on yourself for the break and everything will work itself out.<br>  its definitely a good idea dude.|`|pUUyYz4gaa	Get good grades, get a college education, and you will meet tons of attractive people from the opposite sex.|`|koUpN6SMaa	yeah it isn't really a good idea<br>  get back with him asap

oeuJGaqIaa	Just say your sorry and ask if there is anything you can do to help him out.  You might offer to hang out with him maybe catch a movie or veg out in front of the TV.  He probably will appreciate the support!!  Good Luck!!|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	Find a couple of old rock songs, such as<br>  <br>  " Shop Around" by Smokey Robinson<br>  "Plenty of Fish in the Sea"<br>  <br>  Comments like:<br>  "She's such a *****!"|`|31e3060541ec106d948e7080f42a5032aa	that everything is going to be okay and that he will find someone better|`|pq3Dt5bdaa	Tell him you know he's in pain but she's not everything in life. Remind him of his good qualities that she didn't appreciate and someone else will. Tell him that being single is a great thing. No strings. Be sure to say that he should take time to get over her before moving on to someone else. Time really does heal all wounds. Be around for him. Keep him busy.|`|P7HdSzhKaa	tell him that he will always have you and he can always depend on you no matter what the situation.<br>  <br>  let him know you are a constant in his life.<br>  <br>  guys need just one person who he can count on, other than God, to help him through a tough time.<br>  <br>  he might even like you as more...who knows?|`|98LDN0Quaa	"Lets go to the strip club"
94C2U5FLaa	if she likes it, stay out of it|`|JCdBSULraa	Nope, the guy sounds good.  Most of the time when someone goes through a traumatic experience like that, especially rape at a young age, they spend their entire lives trying to recreate the experience.  Basically their bodies enjoyed the experience against their will, and they felt guilty about it, but the guilt turned to obsession, so they seek out the same types of relationship over and over, thus is why she gravitates towards abusive guys.  <br>  <br>  This guy however does not sound abusive, but she, no doubt still craves to be abused, so much more likely she's begging for the guy to hurt her during sex.  Abuse is much more than physical pain, it's more about control, and the guy is not using his might to control her, only to pleasure her. Both the guy and the girl should get counseling at some point, because it's not entirely healthy to have this kind of relationship.  Not because what they're doing is bad, but if left unchecked, they might push themselves too far with their obsessions.<br>  <br>  Anyway, if you really must give them advice, I'd just tell her you're worried about her health, and to seek counseling if she ever fears the sadism/masochism thing is getting out of hand.  Aside from that, stay out of the way, you might not approve of what they're doing, but it's not your place to approve.|`|lnWvaRWBaa	I would say that the fact that she was raped probably left her tramatized and probably has something to do with how she reacts to this. But, they are some people who enjoy having sex that way and pain actually gets them off and it might not have anything to do with her past. I think when my boyfriend bites my neck, but i don't get all the way into all of that other stuff, but some people do find it normal and actually enjoy it.|`|AA11808892	It could be that she is in an abusive relationship. But if she likes it a bit rougher in bed and it doesn't go beyond that then there really is no concern to be had.|`|Kiq9LSmtaa	Your friend has an inferiority complex going, she needs help.  You are a good friend to notice - the question is what are you prepared to do about it?  How can you make her understand that she is better than she thinks she is?

Also, by asking how are you she knows that you care about her emotionally rather than a typical "what's up?". Make eye contact and smile...she is sure to appreciate your conversation. As for topics you could talk to her about classes, teachers, homework, music, novels, pop icons, anything really. Best of luck to you, everything will go splendidly! -Alice (16f)|`|DFSHoO4uaa	well start of caual  like that lesson was so boring or did u do ur homework going out with her i would advice first you get to know her but group activerys means u can be closer 2 her! hope it goes well|`|80jLgzTBaa	Just simply say whats up or something lol! <br>  <br>   <br>   goood luck <br>  <br>     xokatiexo|`|qXA3RjIbaa	just be like hey wats up and keep the conversation going

You really don't have anything to worry about in terms of cheating, but if it bothers you..you should tell her.|`|BIFO1Vudaa	Well if it's myspace, she's probably just looking for attention.<br>  That's basically the definition of myspace.|`|94C2U5FLaa	whats her myspace link?
1DWx1H8Paa	I think you should tell him. In his defense men are pigs, and we think about sex all day long. Nevertheless you should tell him how you feel, how he makes you feel. If nothing changes your 19 and hot, go find a new guy that will treat you like youfeel you  should be treated.|`|RS8wTMmIaa	you need to talk to your bf about this and let him know how insignificant he's making you feel. if my bf was pulling all this crap on me i would either give the same **** back to him till he realized something was up or just dump him, bt i can tell you really care about him so you need to talk to him and let him know how much he's hurting you when he does this and that he's making you feel unimportant and not special. and if he doesn't change after this and continues to act like a dick then you need to find someone new bc he's not worth it. you should be with a guy that makes you feel like the most beautiful, special girl in the world and nothing could ever change that.

QEuhPEb7aa	He's probably lying to me.<br>  <br>  It merits him a fake smile for a fake compliment.|`|EMYImof1aa	i would be shocked, but in a good way, it would be better if i knew him from somewhere or at least knew his face from somewhere, like college or a store i shop at often, but it'd be kinda strange if i'd never seen him before! i'd probably be like wow thanks, how's it going or do i know you from somewhere?|`|DEcunDd5aa	I would say thanks.|`|uEQ2LbQyaa	i would be like thinks|`|LVrqRCh8aa	I'd be like "THANKS!!" you are too.|`|EdCapqHtaa	I wouldnt know what to say....|`|lTLaQ5i9aa	I would be really happy because someone out of the ordinary just comes up and says that! It would make my day.<br>  <br>   Why?|`|tt3mYuFPaa	You just can't not take looks into consideration.<br>  I mean, there have been many perverted old people and drunk guys who have said that to me.<br>  And I was disgusted.<br>  But if a normal guy, like not a pedofile nor drunk would say that to me, in a ncie way, I would be flattered.<br>  And happy.<br>  Probably it would keep me happy for the whole day.<br>  But, you see, his looks would decide upon how I would answer to him.<br>  Not just the physical looks, also his clothes, style etc...<br>  <br>  But still, you can't just go and say looks don't matter at all, not even for the first impression, because they do.<br>  <br>  They are a part of a part just as much as his personality.<br>  <br>  And that is just something you will have to deal with if you are going to come on to girls and tell them you think they're cute.|`|JHo7g8vAaa	it depends on how he approaches it. like if he comes up all fast and rushes out the words "hey! i think you're cute!" and runs away, i'll think it's a joke. <br>  but if he comes up to me casually and plays it cool and just says "hey you're pretty cute" then i'll feel flattered and i'll be thinking of a thousand different things|`|uLHtXibRaa	Id say..'Tar very much'...and thats it.|`|i9BgSAMjaa	it makes me feel good|`|y05xZzwdaa	I had this happen to me at Publix (grocery store).

tK7XacH7aa	How about you initiate a couple of hugs and then tell him "You know I really like the hugs you give me. you should give me hugs like that every day." Then the next day if he doesn't offer the hug remind him and ask him to give you a hug every day. Then you can kind of touch him and hope he responds.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|fIhC2VdXaa	well maybe he's just shy? you guys are still pretty young and  its only been a month. I'm pretty sure later in your relationship things will get better because you'll get to know each other more. but for now maybe you should just try to talk to him about it? just ask him why and tell him you want more in your relationship
tK7XacH7aa	Thirteen is way too young to have sex. Do you even understand the consequences of unsafe sex. Especially at that age! You should save sex for after marriage because what I've heard on Yahoo that sex feels better after marriage because you actually feel/know that you will be with that person for a long time. At this point you're just doing it for fun. I've heard other stories about how those who had sex at your age really regretted it and it hurt their reputation in general. Also if you get pregnent say good by to your childhood because having a child is a rough thing at that age. Any other questions just keep asking on Yahoo, I'm sure there are some experienced people on here that can offer you more help. Just make sure you put in the question the words "sex and 14 years old" You'll get a huge response. <br>  <br>  Don't have sex yet! It's not a wise decision.|`|a2Cd3ezwaa	oh goodness.  how long have you been dating?  and i don't care what anyone says, 13 is too young for sex.

OLHNleEaaa	This was something I replied on two years ago and got best answer on <br>  <br>  Best Answer - Chosen by Asker<br>  Love has so many meanings and its different for every person depending on who has loved them and who they have loved. <br>  <br>  For me Love is the ultimate thing everyone needs....they will die for it, sacrifice for it....even hurt others over it or hurt the one they love.....<br>  <br>  I believe without love there would not be a world. I believe God made us all different and we all have had different experiences including the bad ones and the good ones. <br>  <br>  The question is what does it mean to you.....What love have you experienced....what love haven't you experienced..... Where have you found it? Where did you look for it and found out that it wasn't there....Who has loved you and how did they love you....How do you want to be loved? What kind of love do you want.....Is it temporary or is it permanent? <br>  <br>  People wonder why there is so much negative in this world....but there is many that have lived amidst this negative world and are not bitter.<br>  2 years ago|`|PlDiJFi0aa	You are just a small kid.Every one know the meaning of love.<br>  hahahaha|`|71JJ9GRVaa	As you said, there is so many definitions of love, and everyone has a different way of looking at it.<br>  I've been with my boyfriend for almost 7 years, and I fall in love with him over and over again. Special moments, small gestures. When you spend a week together doing nothing, and when the time comes to go back to work, and you have to be apart from each other, you get this nervous feeling in your stomach, missing him so much:(<br>  When you can't imagine your life without him, when u would do anything for him. A phone call, a text message, or a whisper through the table to tell you that he loves you.<br>  Love to me is the meaning of my life, the reason for me being here:)
pjDzsN5Saa	I know how you feel, i used to get into fights with my bff, I would always ignore her until she cooled down, but it doesn't work that well.  It's always over on the outside but never on the inside.  We got into a fight once and we decided not to be friends, it lasted a week then we made up because we had a very long talk on the phone, then after that we figured out what we did wrong and fixed it. that might help.<br>          I felt alone without my bff then i made it right, talk to her, find out what happened, it feels a lot better.|`|wKsi5yeMaa	well best friends always argue and i dont think you guys should stop talking just talk to her and tell her that you want to keep being friends.|`|E2OKRhwYaa	Aww I'm sorry truth be told, even the best of us lose best friends sometimes and although it might hurt life goes on. Maybe try telling her that you don't want to lose her and you guys can find a more mature way for working out problems other than arguing about it.
C8DOT8Y7aa	Approach the girl you like. Say "hi" or "hey" and ask her a question or give her a compliment. It can be scary, but it's really pretty simple. If starting conversations is not your strong point, read these articles:<br>  <br>  <br>  How to Talk to Strangers <br>  How to Come Up with Good Conversation Topics <br>  Flirt a little! Relax, crack a joke, and break the touch barrier (see How to Touch a Girl). <br>  Gauge her interest. Take notice of eye contact, smiling, laughter, and enthusiasm in her responses. Read her body language.<br>  <br>  <br>  Notice if she touches you more often than what friends do (she's constantly trying to touch your hand or something). If she finds excuses to do so, then you're probably on the right track. But conversely, don't assume that just because she isn't touching you that she doesn't like you. She may be too nervous to touch you yet. <br>  Observe how she looks at you. If she likes you, she will either hold it for a long time or pull away immediately. Either of these could mean that she likes you. If she pulls away quickly, it means she is nervous but she still likes you. If you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you, then this means that she likes you, although she may quickly dart her head in a different direction. <br>  Pop the question. "Hey, why don't you come to the movies with me this weekend?" (It doesn't have to be the movies - it can be anything you're interested in, and that you think she'll enjoy too.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Another good way to ask is "I heard about this movie, _______. What do you think about it?" If she says she'd like to see it, ask if she'd want to see it with you. If she says "As in a date?", don't be afraid to say yes. If she doesn't say that, just make a time, turn up and treat it like a date and she'll get the drift. <br>  Keep your cool if she says no. Respond gracefully, like "No problem! Maybe another time. I'll see you around, OK?" And go about your business - there are other fish in the sea!<br>  <br>  <br>  Another way to go about doing it is to bail before she has a chance to respond. See How to Sweep a Girl off Her Feet. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  TipsAsk her when you two are ALONE. Having others around you will stir pressure on her to say yes or no. <br>  Ask her out directly. Instead of texting, getting other boys to ask her out for you, or beating around the bush, just ask her. Even if you're nervous, this will increase your chances. Most girls will admire your confidence if you are not arrogant about it. <br>  Being relaxed and confident is the difference between a comfortable silence and an unbearable silence. It's natural to have breaks in the conversation. Don't sweat it. <br>  Don't be afraid of rejection! Most girls have big hearts and will not let you down very easily, if at all. Some girls agree to one date just because you asked and they're being nice. Don't take it the wrong way, it simply means she likes you enough to not hurt your feelings but not enough that she's ready for a relationship. <br>  When you do approach the girl, try not to start the conversation by a "Hey, can I talk to you?" or a "Can I ask you something?". Don't ask her out randomly, but these lines are giant hints that you are about to ask her out. This would be awkward. <br>  If she says no, just ask "Oh, OK. Is it fine if we're still friends?"|`|ixrDRTQnaa	First be friend with her and you can ask her out.
LYdxypciaa	I've had people do similar things to me!<br>  Their not worth it, just completely ignore them. <br>  Get a better best friend. <br>  Unless she's like a one in a million just made this mistake.<br>  <br>  She would of done this to make her self seem better in front of the boy, by making you seem uglier and by comparison.  <br>  <br>  I have big hands and big feet lol cos im tall... well 5'6 xD I always used to think i was some horridious giant but all the lads in my year seem to be shooting up now.

Likst1Mxaa	It is lovely that you want to help people! Be careful not to make this girl feel like a "project" - genuinely wanting to be her friend is more important than solving her problem.<br>  <br>  The thing is, you guys aren't friends yet. Be really nice to her and help her to see that you are caring and trustworthy.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could try to say (after a few weeks of being friends) "Are you okay? I'm a bit worried about you because ____"<br>  <br>  Don't use the word 'abuse' when you talk to her. She may become reserved, deny it or more hurt. She might feel like it is her fault. <br>  <br>  It is really important that you share this with an adult, teacher, counsellor or someone that you trust. Even if she doesn't say she being abused, if you tell a teacher you trust that there seems to be something wrong with this girl they can and will help her.<br>  <br>  Also, if she does disclose abuse to you, you might go through a whole range of emotions, find yourself comparing stores, etc. It is hard having friends who are being abused, especially if you have lived thru the same situation. If you want someone to "debrief" with, talk to a trusted adult, not another friend. It is not fair to tell other friends about the situation the girl is in.<br>  <br>  If you make someone feel valued and accepted then they are more likely to be friends with you.

(Probably the thing that he sent you a picture of.)|`|PgbPCUtnaa	If he sent you a picture of his junk before a picture of his face, he thinks that that picture is enough to convince you to like him.  Obviously sex is all that's on that pervert's mind, but that's the only thing that's on a lot of guys' minds.  He sounds like one of those sex-driven guys that just want to "hit it and quit it."|`|vBcqzMz4aa	nope, its all about sex at this point. think of how awkward it would be to have to meet this guy in real life and have to make small talk with him after hes gone so far as to show you his junk.. the answer is VERY.|`|l1qWh9vSaa	I think he's looking for sex, you talk to him on line and he sends you a picture of his tool,! think about it. the guy's a freak.|`|yzZchHHTaa	No self respecting Guy would send a pic of his thing to any Woman.

pYomxgYfaa	Sweety, jealousy ruins many things.<br>  <br>  Jealousy can be healthy to an extent, but you have to understand that he PROPOSED to you. He wants to spend the REST of his LIFE with you. He wants to die with you being his WIFE. <br>  <br>  If he was unsure, he wouldn't have put a ring on your precious finger and asked you to be the mother of his children.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend is very much like you, he is the jealous type. I cannot begin to tell you how many nights i've cried feeling pathetic and useless because I cannot be trusted. <br>  <br>  I love him so much, and yet I can't live my life without this feeling that no matter what I do, he will find something wrong with it. I am not saying you are exactly the same, but believe me, you have nothing to be insecure about.<br>  <br>  You found a man who is giving his entire life to you, and you are worried about other women? Hunny you are the ONE and ONLY woman for him, and he proved that the day he asked you to marry him.<br>  <br>  Please don't be jealous of these things. You have no idea how much it could hurt your fiancee. I, for one, have cried many nights and my heart has been broken because of this. Please, please, please give him some credit. You are going to spend the rest of your life with him, and I feel that to him that is such a privilege he would not want to lose.<br>  <br>  Make it worth his while :)|`|LETd2hQwaa	Its all in your head.

He may or may not be completely over it, but has decided that it is not an important part of who he is, and something he would like to move past.<br>  <br>  As for your personal concerns with pornography, I would recommend trying to overcome them as well.<br>  <br>  Being in a relationship is not a cure-all for pornography addiction.  But if you two remain honest and open with each other, you can definitely overcome this addiction, and develop a satisfying and rewarding relationship.|`|kHOPhEsGaa	Give the poor guy a chance to breathe. You have major paranoia. Im a girl and can tell who has beauty whether its men or women, it just a part of us, we judge people on what they look like. First impressions are everything even when people say they shouldn't be, its the 20th century and were all going to do this.If i saw someone wearing something i liked id probably look again to see their sense of style, or saw a really hot guy walking past (i would think he is hott but deffo would not make something happen) doesn't mean i have a thing for them.|`|oOqSpBmbaa	No, I'm like him as well.. I'd leave him be to be honest.<br>  I notice beauty in girls and will openly admit it, even though I'm not gay..<br>  I could be walking through a mall with my friends and pass by a gorgeous girl and say "Sweet Jesus she's pretty" or whatever|`|kkO87h0Xaa	You're really being paranoid.|`|pUUyYz4gaa	This point you need to consider is that your constant questions will eventually point him in that direction again, either through your mistrust of him or your constantly bringing it up.<br>  <br>  Trust him at his word until you have evidence of otherwise, or you will drive him out of our life and into the arms of those things again.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	It is possible for ANY person to change that much and more. <br>  <br>  In any case, it sounds to me like you are reading into this WAY too much. I suggest you work on NOT being such a "jealous type," or you're going to be single again. And again. And again. If it takes counseling, get it. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	You need to relax. Guys and girls watch porn all of the time. It's a normal thing and it has nothing to do with our personal relationships, so long as it does not turn into a addiction. But you say YOU were the one with the addiction...so I think he should be worried about you in that scenario. <br>  <br>  Also, he won't leave you just because he finds someone else attractive. He likes YOU and your personality. If he really wanted to be with those other girls then he would leave you. Don't worry so much. If you worry all of the time then you won't enjoy your relationship!|`|jmlAmr3gaa	Guys are fundamentally logical.  Whatever they reason they should be, they can be.<br>  <br>  That said... it's totally natural for people to notice the opposite sex.  Stop distrusting your guy, and giving him a hard time about being human, or you'll lose him.  A lot of people say trust has to be earned, but that's wrong.  In healthy relationships, trust is given, and only withdrawn when it's been abused.|`|iLIQIqvLaa	the best advice i could give you is to relax. if you're his first girlfriend, and you're already engaged, then i'm pretty sure he feels no need to look or care about other women if he hasn't done anything with them for pretty much his whole life, except with you. let him be, because you're coming off as controling.|`|GaLw1qMwaa	you are learning how to love.  <br>  the more relationships you have the more you will know how to act.<br>  <br>  you shouldnt ask questions like that, people have a right to privacy.<br>  pressuring him will just make him tell you anything that will shut you up.|`|0UqOwLCjaa	You're terribly jealous and may endanger your relationship because of it.|`|OuQizrQ6aa	Guys have to look at that stuff or else we could die.|`|1Ad7jJgwaa	First of all, you both should be more comfortable with what you're attracted to. If you both like porn, so what? If you do this, you'll both be happy I bet.<br>  <br>  Go to an adult store, and go shopping for three videos you both think you'll really like. Maybe get some other stuff while you're there too, why not. Go home and watch them together and talk about them while it's happening. It'll be fun. You'll both open up a little more about what you like and don't like, and be more comfortable that you both like different things. Perfectly natural, perfectly fine.<br>  <br>  Maybe after that you'll feel less inclined to ask him questions like that. Chances are, the reason you DO ask him these things, is because you want to have that kind of connection with him. Does he like other women? Good, he's not gay. Is he intimate with them on the same level you are? Not even close. Don't worry about it. This is a good chance for you both to open up, give it a shot.|`|Wrn6WH7xaa	Stop worrying about it, it sounds like you have a good guy who loves you a whole lot. Atleast your seeing his point, which is the first step, but for your realationship to work, you need to build trust (not just say you trust him, but truly and honestly trust him)<br>  <br>  As for the porn, did you ever think of watching it together? It could really spice things up. ;-)|`|d2FJBJ8baa	you are over reacting and you need to calm down<br>  <br>  every man looks at other woman, it is natural. nothing will happen, we just look because it is there. he loves you and if you don't stops this non-sense then things might go bad because you are being paranoid. you are feeling extremely insecure which is just silly. stop worrying and treat him well, you will be fine|`|j4PwaY5Jaa	i really truly believe your man .... i look at guy's and girl's and see Beauty  i also agree with your man cuz who wants to dwell on all the stuff that is in the past i think he cares for you and you need to just let it go and i dont think he will like anyone else over you because my boy has looked at girls like that and we have been together for 1 year and 4 n a half months and i know that it dont seem like a long time but it is for me cuz im 16 and hes 15 so it is a long time for us ...please dont take my age and advice as just some dumb teen that dont know what she is talking about cuz thats not the case .... me and my guy can pick out pretty girls together and laugh about it try it with your man but tell him your not trying to grill him about it Just tell him that you want to see if you both consider the same peeps as beautiful and have fun with it you only live one time and you only get one chance what if he was killed tomorrow and the last good convo you had was about this? just let it go and relax he's with you not them so just enjoy it

You're only in middle school so I would not have sex if i were you, it's way too early for that and you'd regret it but kissing is not that big of a deal.|`|uLHtXibRaa	What is this..?..If you friends pressured you to jump off a cliff for your b/f would you be asking if you should or not?What do you want to do?Thats what matters.|`|xljItkJgaa	Kiss... it's not like it's sex.|`|Vkf3dpdraa	Well that is not the right reason to kiss someone because your  feeling pressured. whats next you are going to be pressured into having sex? please think about your actions do not give in peer pressure! if you are going to kiss someone it should be because you are in the moment and just give in and kiss because you want to not because you are being told to. good luck in your 1st kiss make sure you put on chap stick or lip gloss?|`|gjIPQ1blaa	okay. i had my first kiss in 6th grade. i was exactly like you but when we     did kiss, it was awesome. and i was happy that i decided to kiss. <br>  so since you guys like each other so much i think you should.<br>  kissing can bring a relationship closer together. : )|`|B2DwTM3caa	listen, just ask you girlfriend if she wants to kiss u and if she does do the French kiss is really hot and it feel really good|`|Dy6gVqGfaa	do it when it feels time to kiss him.dont do it just because your friends want you to.|`|twCu2tFfaa	6 months is about time

Wy0lUjP9aa	Is Twilight even in the movies anymore?<br>  <br>  Usually on the first date most women don't kiss on the first date. They do it on the second or third one. But I think it depends on how comfortable you are with him. <br>  <br>  Wear jeans and a nice top but show it off with some flats.<br>  But you can wear dress dance and a cute graphic tee and wear some cute closed toe high heel shoes. You can look very nice. If you are not always comfortable with a dress on, like I am not comfortable with a dress on so I would wear the pants and shirt.|`|T0dPL9wBaa	Is English your first language?<br>  <br>  <br>  In answer to the part of your question I could understand, no, you don't have to dress up unless you want to. There's no harm in going all out, but nice jeans and nice top should be fine.|`|clZvzqz6aa	if your just going to the movies than a nice top and some jeans would be fine. <br>  the holding hands and kissing part is up to you, if you both feel comfortable with doing that then go for it. <br>  <br>  have fun!

8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	key word in your question is "boys"...<br>  <br>  as boys grow into men, some get better at expressing their feelings and remembering important dates (sometimes with some helpful reminders from you)...|`|AA10836670	we get it that its important, because most women make a fuss over it. but for us. most men just dont remember it. <br>  <br>  its not a big deal for us. most of us anyways.
6akCILTQaa	Just be straight and tell him what you feel...   tell him that if not love lets be frnds..   nothing wrong in being honest...   honesty is the first virtue towards best relationships|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Why not just tell him you are interested? Don't play games.

ExluLxQyaa	Realize that this is not the 1930's and ask him out.  You can do that you know.  Guys don't always have to do the asking.
PiWYjEQ9aa	grope around.. his chest or ***..i luv it ven my gf does that to me spontaneously.. N I return the favor!
jBVtNmeQaa	Well at his age it's pretty normal to have this problem and Viagra is definitely the best solution, or other similar drugs.<br>  <br>  You can try like Kama Sutra, which works with breathing and raising the energy rather than losing your power and letting it go through orgasm.<br>  <br>  Also if when he feels the orgasm you stop making love for a minute, and start again, that usually helps keep the orgasm at bay for awhile and raise the energy, but I'm not sure how easy that is at his age.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|nVdYIHhzaa	viagra helps with that
czPzAuSAaa	First off, stop being so possessive.  When he's at work, I'd say he needs to concentrate on his job & not on talking to you.|`|f9Y7FL5iaa	dont boss him around!

YAKouHawaa	Hey MexicanBoy :) I've seen you say quite a few times how much you like this girl. Firstly do you know why she dumped this other guy? If not then ask why, does she like another guy? Keep showing her how sweet you are. Personally I think you should take her for a walk somewhere like the beach or park, sit her down on a bench or something and just tell her how you feel. There will never feel like there is a right time to say this. Tell her how much you like her and if she doesn't feel the same way then just be sure to tell her that you still want to stay friends and that hopefully one day you'll get over her. I really hope everything works out for you -Blue Eyes- x|`|620435831a260a57d4798da422b767c7aa	Blue eyes advice is a good one. Anyhow, you can't really do much. Honestly, I wouldn't rush in right away. Um, time defiantly has to pass by. Because frankly, she can say that she isn't going back with him, but you never know. She needs 'space' to really think things out, and I  doubt she is thinking about you in a more deeper way, right now. The best thing right now, is to be friendly. And just let the days speak for itself.|`|Rp66HmQraa	OMG Fantastico... Usted deberia pedir que sea tu novia! Estoy tan feliz por ti. : D Preguntele a la mayor brevedad posible. Ella ya deberia saber que seria un gran novio, por lo que no deberia tener que convencer a ella.|`|WxjlBU13aa	This sounds like my friend David... I had the feeling he liked me and when my and my bf broke up he was there. The thing is... I didn't see him that way. He was a sweet guy, giving me advice and trying to help me move on... but i still had feelings for my bf.<br>  I think you should be very careful with this girl.. You could get seriously hurt..|`|h52mKmdsaa	honestly its to soon to say your in love with her you might think you like her alot but love is a strong word <br>  if i was you just hangout with her more and get to know her <br>  more ask her out to dinner and maybe a walk to the beach or something nice but dont move in to fast you might scare her away good luck|`|x8AiE27Waa	good for you <br>  my baby  still havent dumped that b'itch :[<br>  i need him.!
AA11071040	Wait until the snickers machine is out of the picture, you don't want to be the other woman!  It might be awkward dating at first, since you can't really go anywhere, unless you have a pick-up truck or van.  Be prepared for the ridicule of dating outside your species.  Since you have to pay him to get any satisfaction, it might feel like you are paying an escort.  Plus, he is already satisfying other people, so you may have a lot of competition!|`|AxydfiIHaa	...i'm not sure how to handle that?<br>  if you're substituting names with objects then you should probably just wait until they break up, start being friends right now. i don't think you quite "love" him yet if you arent dating unless you guys have been friends for a while.<br>  <br>  if you really do love a vending machine then i can't help you...thats just a little too strange.|`|gd0wVQ41aa	out would be fine!<br>  but if you two got married and had a baby, the baby could result to a snickers bar with a human head.|`|wv4rOWqZaa	...hmmm.|`|YFXusnT1aa	weird|`|xgJbxZgfaa	just drink him all up!!
3XZX5Mj6aa	At 16 I didn't think much about getting married and having kids- as time passes your opinions will change as you mature. You should definitely stay a virgin; if not, you will most likely regret it a few years down the track.|`|SW690ahvaa	Well,firstly id like 2 say that im proud of u,because you kept yourself until 16 because im 15&& yea..But think about it when your not having sex,you dont have 2 worry about the risk of getting any diseases or getting pregnant,and those are the best things about being a virgin:)But dont feel like u have 2 and if u do use protection!!|`|FWlYX7tmaa	hitt it

p9j5zl4Naa	Everyone does that.  Its an outlet to let out the anger and frustration.  I suggest getting a membership at a gym.  It will give him an alternate outlet to let things out at, and stay in shape while he's at it.|`|zY7boFYNaa	He is just probably in a bad mood and does not know how to control his anger, so he puts on people, so be ask him about it, when he is good mood to respect you.|`|srAP6Vzvaa	it's not THEY. it's just him sweety. he needs to grow some Balls and not take his frustration out on others. especially on a Woman. i think he is pathetic actually. pretty sad.|`|AA12074512	all men are not like that.. you said it hes a prick|`|b538976641cc2a50041772f307796f66aa	Yeah Women never do this. Wait, you picked him. This is partly your fault for picking a guy like this.
Uj5kuzoJaa	Sounds like he likes you. Do you like him? If you do then start being flirty back to him and see what happens. Make an effort to talk to him more. See if you can get a group of people to go to the movies and ask him if he wants to go with all of you. It takes the pressure off and you two will probably have a good time.

NQIwNjWBaa	If you only like him as a friend, then be careful not to ruin your friendship.But before you go out and do anything you might want to make sure its over between you and your ex...At first most guys only like what they see..But you are not the only pretty girl out there so remember that..Because you never know he might actually like you. Talk to him and try to get to know him and if you realize that you do like him go ahead and go out with him and take a chance and  hopefully he really likes you because of your looks and personality because looks alone can be deceiving.|`|azcafkQpaa	Exactly that. <br>  When he does ask you out, ask if you could just go as friends. It's okay to let him know you're not quite ready to jump back into dating just yet, although you do like him. There's no harm in saying you'd like to be friends before anything further goes on. <br>  <br>  If he's a nice guy, he wont mind at all. If not, well then he might not even be worth it anyway, right?
2GQv8dfgaa	maybe he wants things to get a move on.<br>  you should just smile at him and wave haha guys like taht i guess..<br>  so yeah. im sure he likes you<br>  hes just playing hard to get.
a5SsIeWKaa	Just a GIRL asking a guy out is enough for me. :P|`|FbT5sSScaa	Well, I believe that it would be best if they ask you out face to face because it shows there true feelings for you. If it is face to face, when you both are in a good mood, and laughing with each other, you turn to them and say, "Would you wanna go out with me" or a more creative way. Maybe give them a present then ask them. But thats only if you no there going to say yes. I hope I helped!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!!!|`|LETd2hQwaa	Totally not a guy but I'm totally gonna answer this question because I was once curious and asked some guys myself and the majority rule simply said: JUST DO IT it doesn't matter how, all that matters is that you do it because guys don't always like to do the asking, its nice to have a girl take the pressure off sometimes.|`|wCsQUZGlaa	Just a girl asking a guy out is great I think. I'd say face to face. Just say you wanna spend time with him, hang out.

That's all it has to be.|`|zx8cVDqIaa	Face to Face, I like to talk to them and when I get close enough I ask them if they'd like to go somewhere, like a place to eat, eventually the relationship gets more serious and you have a girlfriend like that.|`|a49Musptaa	i know i'm not a guy but i love it when guys ask me out face to face. they say want to go somewhere then tell me|`|jWMXi3Lnaa	Do it on MSN and you'll be single forever|`|PJZRGsc3aa	face to face<br>  <br>  <br>  straight up, don't "beat around the bush"|`|EsnFmcMFaa	face to face<br>  <br>  i dont care how
XTdhbETbaa	the sex your having is exploratory. Like climbing a mountain because its hard. After summit and decent do you want to go right back and climb it again? No you want to try another one. When you find the girl that you don't become disinterested in then maybe there is something there. Until then keep climbing away buddy!|`|IPefoTZVaa	if you're like me, then it's the thrill of the chase.<br>  <br>  girls play hard to get which makes it fun. after you've gotten it you feel like you've already won this game.|`|hQv43Xhmaa	Maybe it is because you got all you wanted from the girl and there isn't anything else in it for you.|`|LNAEqArtaa	Very possible that you haven't found the right girl yet. You'll know when you've found her because you'll never want to leave her side again!|`|KRfoTdQWaa	Maybe after w/e you did with the chick it might of made you think less of her, so your not interested.|`|4gyOqTqGaa	its just you bro<br>  no one else|`|orLbJlfFaa	maybe sumthing wrong with you, maybe your not that sexy or  your sex is exciting.|`|QHI9HSiqaa	The conquest is over- time for new challenges.|`|wv4rOWqZaa	it's the hat...|`|4wRVxL6Xaa	Maybe women's not your thing!!<br>  <br>  Or maybe you did it wrong!!|`|jJwuMTSqaa	Have sex with a male, and see if you feel the same way.|`|YQ1Q7XeEaa	You my friend have never been in love.<br>  <br>  You get what you want - it's the whole basis for interest in that person.  Once you have it they lose the allure.<br>  <br>  It also means you are probably pretty shallow when it comes to relationships because a question like this shows you're in it for your needs alone.|`|kWJkhm3gaa	Ok, I'll be getting no "best answer" for this or probably not many thumbs up but I don't really care.  You're probably honestly just one of these guys (and there are A LOT of them) who will have sex with anyone just because she is "hot" without actually getting to know or respect them as a person. Truly a sad way to live life...look a little more into their eyes and a little less at the chest.

8adee73ccc06e52ea84f99eba7588af8aa	Sounds like he's developed some feelings for you other than friendship, and those are making him feel a bit shy around you.  Question is, do you want him to like you (that is, do you like him back?)  You can either encourage or discourage those feelings in him, and either get to be bf/gf or back to being just friends.|`|Qy9mH2s7aa	has he hugged you? does he tease you? do u guys text each other? IM? facebook? myspace? if he texts you a lot then he definitely likes you. i cannot tell if he likes you from what you said. <br>  how long have you guys been friends? do you eat lunch togeather? does he help you with your homework if you need it?|`|rj57MKHYaa	he may have liked you b4 but now hes geting bored becuase in his eyes you didnt get the hint or hes just shy and to scared to admit it =P hope this helps
u9RwzLPnaa	Yes! although, it's very tricky and even then the guy still might want more later on.|`|HHyny0JSaa	Sure, guys and girls can just be friends. And if you ever get the urge, there's always friends with benefits.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Absolutely.  I go out with guy friends, and it's totally cool.  If the opportunity presents itself, drop a line about how great it is to meet someone you can just hang out with or how you're happy to be single now -- just in case.|`|207dFmdHaa	yes yes yes, just be truthful from the start with the guy....some of my best friends are guys, and I am now married with kids, and have stayed in contact with these guy, and now their wives.

It's completely normal to go out with a guy just as a friend. And you can tell him that when he asks you. If you like the guy, but not necessarily in that way, just  say "Sure, but just as friends right now." If he doesn't like that, well that's his problem. You don't need to feel pressured to go into a relationship just because a guy asked you out on a "date". Besides, if you don't get romantic feelings for the guy after your friendly date, you could have just gained a new friend, which is just as golden.|`|IFrzXsDXaa	Yes! i have tons of chik friends that i just hang out with! as long as the guys understand where your coming from. It also depends on your age. im assuming your a teen like myself.<br>  <br>  Then again u did say men and women. SO it depends. Yes i dnt see why you couldnt. but im also not an adult. but that is my opinion. sorry if i couldnt help :(|`|bXGwTQy6aa	you cant be friends with someone you got feelings for.....but a true friend respect each other regardless of gender...you can have male or female friends without a problem,just respect those boundaries|`|AcjLKC2Laa	Just tell them too all back off.<br>  & yeah there's ways to do that. Just say hey look, I don't want to be crying over you or making the relationship go further .|`|8cAYuWKbaa	not really...like you can hang out as friends....but if ur going out...then your kind of committed to the man...i mean you could always just chill as friends.|`|Zexhg9Lbaa	Depends on the other person.|`|W0qFAIVuaa	Yes,as long as the sex is good!|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	of course they can!!<br>  i do it all the time!!<br>  it's WAY better than all that drama..
g71m3S9Naa	I have no idea on that one.....<br>  <br>  If you have a long tongue women think you can lick puss real good.|`|4j6DSEqFaa	I guess because your tongue is long and on tv when they talk about good kissing its normally because a person's tongue can touch the back of someone's throat. That's my educated guess!
2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Probably cuz when they don't have a girlfriend you think you have a chance, so when they get one, it's the end of someone's hopes.|`|Wi5TG5Yzaa	Its because you feel betrayed. You feel as though they have crushed you on purpose, which they probably have, and that they have smitten your soul with their Axe of Going Out With Someone Else. I think that you should sit down and be truthful to yourself. Go and cry!!!!!!! You'll find yourself a much happier person who can take **** like that and just throw it in the betrayer's breakfast cereal!
mpFuO5Ilaa	um i step on the gas sometimes but mostly cruise control. I flirt all the time!! ha!!
bclSSup9aa	SPEAKING AS A GUY he just wants to tax that sweet *** while he is away from his girlfriend. then he makes up with her leaves you in the dust and now you have herpies.

LETd2hQwaa	1st of all... CHILL! Now, why is that you want to break it off? I mean really, is the situation(s) so bad that it can't be worked on? Is he worth all this drama? Is he a good guy? Has he been there for you the whole 9 months? Can you see yourself with him if you could just get past the drama? Think long and hard about how much you really care for him and if you can see yourself with him. Obviously there are issues here but only you know if you can love him through the hurt. <br>  <br>  You can always talk to him about how you're feeling too. Communication is key.|`|jCykBGwlaa	Why do you think you should break up with him in the first place? What is the true reason your head is saying no? If you guys were meant to be together and you break up, you might find each other again when the time is right to be together. I had this problem too I ended it with the guy I really loved but my heart was saying don't do it. Girl it turns out he wasn't worth my time even. I was heartbroken but now I'm with someone knew who totally makes my whole world seem brighter. If think you should break up in your head it's probably trying to prepare the heart for pain it might suffer in the future.|`|bVROvLNSaa	Make a list of the pros and cons.  <br>  Sometimes it helps to see it written down on paper.  It may even help you decide.  <br>  Kudos to you for wanting to do this in person.  Too many would just text or leave a voice mail or send an e-mail.|`|0q5Z5zxIaa	i'm a bit like this as well.. my heart wants it to work, but my head it telling me it won't.<br>  <br>  my advice is to think about what it really is that's stopping you from being optimistic. then tackle that problem. life is about believing, so start believing that you two will work out if your heart tells you it will. speak to your boyfriend about it and he may be able to help you.. or even feel the same way, then you can tackle it together. either way, your heart will tell you what to do eventually. follow it.<br>  <br>  hope this helps :) good luck!
AA11778728	just ask. dont play the stupid silly little games, just come right out and ask.|`|mPDqWc8gaa	if it's not a date then just text him or something. or talk to him on the phone.|`|ifRsiDxQaa	now i'm confused????? lol love april x
15Zr5voMaa	you should ask the girl out that you like. if you don't like the girl that likes you then don't go out with her. All you have to do is go up and say to her hi, my name is( whatever ur real name is) do you wanna go out with me. or you could get to know her first before you ask her out. That might help just a little bit, i hope it works and you ask her out.
AA11209233	The way it is now, you get to choose where this relationship is going.  You can end it, be friends, or make him a boyfriend--but you two aren't anything but acquaintances at the moment.  <br>  <br>  If you like him so far, help the boy out, let him know you like him.  Do sit next to him.  Ask him what he thinks about something.  Be funny-flirty, and don't be afraid to touch him.  No, you aren't ready to hold hands for two hours while you watch a movie that isn't romantic.  But don't be afraid to grab his hand to look at his watch, guide him somewhere, or make a joke.  Basically, follow up the insufficient text flirting with enough flirting that you both know where you stand with each other, and then take things wherever you want from there.|`|PS83gPGoaa	jus takes things slowly and relax. sit next to him and see how he reacts.|`|HPntifqhaa	To me it sounds he is interested but is afraid or too shy to make a more aggressive move on you. Maybe you should try to sit first before he does (if your there first, of course) and let him decide if he wants to sit next to you. If I liked you enough, yes I would but if I'm feeling inadequate I may be a bit too shy. If you like him enough then you should just go for it!
BfgB6l8Qaa	It can be awkward. She doesn't see you that way, and you made the mistake in her eyes, so don't go cutting her off. Perhaps she did upset you, but it isnt her fault she sees you nothing but a best friend. Hang out with her and see how things go. At least you gave it a try though and now you know how she feels about it|`|dGDQy584aa	Don't see each other for a while so you can get over feeling hurt.  It's natural to feel angry and all, but it's better that she told you the truth instead of being "nice" and stringing you along.  <br>  If you still want to be friends after that, then work into it slowly|`|tCiVuFK9aa	Yes it is normal to get your feelings hurt when you are told that by someone you really like.  Try to go back to being just friends.

I've always been a romantic type thinking that if you're dating someone the man should treat you to something special but simple... a rose..card..nice dinner if nothing else spend some quality time.My boyfriend was away in Alabama for valentines day so we made our own we he got back... but then again we've been dating for almost 3 years.. I guess the problem is that ya'll have only been together for a month. But that shouldn't make it any less important to you. I hate to say it but there is a chance that he didn't want to do anything because he didn't want to buy you a present or dinner... its lame and immature but thats how it goes sometimes.. stop the cuss words for a second and tell him how you feel. If his reaction is anything but sincere forget him and find someone worth your time.
P9yzwrwDaa	dude likes you|`|djkJkogLaa	yeah, the same thing is happening to me but today when i was onthe bus, he put his ear phones in my ear and made me listen to it.  but idk, it was like he was making such an effort to have me listen to it and i was absent from school on wendsday, and this one kid that i, he, my friend gabby and this other kid, and the other kid said that mike(the guy) wasnt being annoying whne i wasnt there.  i think that means that he likes me, and everyone else says that same thing.  that would be my best guess, and i hope you and that boy go along good(: take a chance and ask him out! you never know(:|`|LLapx5x3aa	From personal experience i would say you are right. Thats how my relationship, of three years, started with my Ex. We worked together and i would playfully joke and we would be alittle mean to each other. I guess it was just my way of tryin to say im interested, but don't wanna feel rejected.|`|f8xmQjdkaa	If I liked them, I wouldn't call them b*tch.  Anyone who uses that name....ahhhhhhgh...no..don't even get me started.|`|mPfDlG2Laa	Well, it sounds to me like he has a major crush on you (and an idiotic fixation with that hip-hop junk.)  He is covering up, keeping his heart under cover.  Yeah, we guys are very terrified of rejection and looking stupid.  Ladies don't have that moronic machismo to worry about!  But do me a small favor-break him of that bit*h habit real quick.  He may not intend to but he is disrepecting you.  Hip-hop is good about fostering that.|`|Tf19RETiaa	woah im like the exact situation! i think its true.
mPfDlG2Laa	First, don't be so giving-like that would be easy to stop doing...  Yes, he likes you!  Talk to him, tell him to not be so cagey-be open and honest.  Communication; the hardest thing for humans to do...|`|WdOAxQmoaa	if he jokes around and all that,he likes you,coming from a guy i know i do it to the girls i like.  show him that your interested in him like say he's cute do the usual flirtatious things girls do :P. if your shy or scared because you got hurt in the past ,you have to get over it, it's hard,i'm the same i haven't talked to a random girls in months that's bad for me lol,that's because im paranoide in case i get hurt. <br>  <br>  show him you like him,then he'll do all the asking out stuff honest :)|`|4G1jYmJ1aa	Well honestly if you like him enough to post a question on yahoo then GO FOR IT! Don't let him go like don't let another girl move in on him and talk to him more, If he knows your interested then i'm sure he'll show you more. Just make a suggestion to chill one day...DO SOMETHING don't let him come to you because that doesn't always work. good luck girl!|`|108bda52f589fc19127b2386f7d509f7aa	Be alone together somewhere, not necessarily in a motel room, and you will see by how you are with each other whether there is anything "going on". Just be yourself.|`|vrtbYVC5aa	ask for sex if he says yes yur good
lNlL0Ag2aa	Lol? Most of them probably don't know what those are cuz I have no idea what a camo hat is suppose to look like.
xJBJn6dOaa	It could be a rebound, or it could be someone he liked while you were going out, but couldn't do anything about it. I know that with my first boyfriend, we went to different colleges and I started liking someone new. After a few months, my boyfriend and I split and I started dating that other person only after a few weeks. We weren't "official" for a while, but we certainly were "together" pretty soon after my relationship ended.<br>  <br>  It always hurts to be the other person in the relationship who doesn't get a new boyfriend/girlfriend first. Please don't take it personally... he can see who he wants now, and so can you. From what it sounds like, he genuinely likes this new person. Take it as motivation to go out and there and meet new people! :)|`|AA10989335	Nobody can say for sure, but maybe hes just being young and having fun. He might not want anything too serious right now.. If he has found happiness I should think you will have no problem either.|`|YFXusnT1aa	He likes her but he is not completely sure yet|`|JizwgEiYaa	QUIT ASKING THE SAME QUESTION|`|POHWTDPRaa	You have asked this question many times. Are you just going to keep going until someone gives up and tells you what you want to hear, that he is miserable without you, his one true love? He likes hanging out with her. He thinks she is a nice person. Yes, he likes her. And he is happy. Why can't you be happy FOR him?
hBr3nfaIaa	About the whole him-getting-on-with-other-girls thing, don't worry because if you're like me, you can talk really easily to people who are just friends but you can maybe feel shy/awkward with your gf.<br>  <br>  It's only a new relationship, I think you gotta get to know each other more so you have things to talk about.<br>  <br>  So just go out at the weekend and spend time together.<br>  It's should help [:|`|XTj0LP6gaa	If he's really your boyfriend you should be able to just ask him.  "Hey honey why don't you ever talk to me in class?"|`|zY7boFYNaa	Do not be afraid to confront your feelings to your boyfriend, it only hold on pressure yourself with that grudge that you are holding in, just ask him about it, and plus it is a bit early in the relationship?But ask him right away cause it is BETTER for him to know how you are feeling.|`|gekVXz9eaa	ok gurl dis is wat u need 2 do,  go out on a reallllyyyy romantic date. Then get him to drop the bomba "i love you" the way u shuld do tht is lk tell him u luv him and stuff and b all romantic. But if dat don't work FLIRTATION IS KEYYYY!!!!!!!!! and sexy clothes.|`|Ha5pGkbgaa	i hate the man species >_<|`|PTwQMnTRaa	My advice to you is to get a life. (In a nice way, not a mean way).  Talk to YOUR friends, You all have only been dating two weeks, that's hardly a relationship (maybe in teenage years).  But just like he had a life before you, you have hopefully had a life before him, popular or not.  As far as his speaking to you.  He could be shy so you speak to him.  Also watch out for the ex, there is noooo such thing as, there just good friends, when he treats her different, and by that I mean Better than he treats you.  Wake up.  HE should always speak to you.  It sounds like he doesn't want to make her uncomfortable.  his loyalty should be with his girlfriend.
iwvRBeXOaa	Once or twice. I learned quickly though how to identify these guys from the beginning and stopped wearing my heart on my sleeve because the sad truth is a lot of guys are just otu there to pretty much get laid and that's it.
7z9eKO2maa	you've got the right idea about it dudette, stick to that and you'll be happier (:|`|QEgpIxuKaa	No, you're not old fashioned just smart and have some morals, (seems a bit rare these days).  When you do meet the right guy he will indeed stick around and wait but I'd recommend that you be honest about your feelings and concerns so that you don't come across as a tease and a game player|`|9NSfJChaaa	An "old-fashioned" girl would not set a time limit of 6 months and then doing it.  An "old-fashioned" girl would wait until she knew there was going to be a commitment from the man, and might even continue to hold out until the wedding night.|`|HQssYZ8taa	you can wait as long as you want. If you think you do it too early and you feel like your a hoe, then just dont tell anybody you did it|`|b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	Maybe the others have split cause they feel you are just teasing them. Be straight forward, don't play games. Just say it's too soon...|`|PtSeJXnEaa	my boyfriend and i waited 3 days. we've been togeth almost 6 months and couldn't be happier.|`|D1KT9ioJaa	ppl in my area do it within 4 weeks..which is a lot better than waiting 6months!|`|NC5GCk5Yaa	they are really into you??? maybe penis deep...thats it...|`|JNcB7Ffbaa	WAIT TILL YOU GET MARRIED!!!!|`|mO6YN1wJaa	I totally agree with you!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Q2bGrCeKaa	And there is nothing wrong with being old fashioned and respecting yourself........I have promised myself to remain celibate until i get married I am planning on getting a purity ring.....But waiting until 6 months isn't that bad.....|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	Thats about right to wait and see what they want I would say.|`|AA12130864	You can lead a horse to water.....<br>  <br>  But you should leave sex out of the equasion until marage.<br>  <br>  That way if the two of you can get by without it for the duration, it is real!!<br>  <br>  Kind of like your logic, but one step further!!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps,<br>  <br>  Lonnie|`|a31YBmwHaa	its good of you to wait. good on you girl, he should stick around for you, not for the sex.<br>  if he only w8'sfor the sex he's a douchebag. dump him. beat him up|`|s7seaaPkaa	i dont think your old fashioned your just not  whor* like some of these girls these days.<br>  i wait the same amount of time.<br>  theres no point of giving yourself to someone who doesn't want the whole you.<br>  all they want is a ONE PART!|`|yEMRPW1Aaa	welcome to the real world of today.

7w9AM9Tnaa	well she could be a little into you. or she could just be shy to talk to any guys.. unless she does talk to most guys around her, then maybe she could be into you.  the only way you'll find out is start talking to her, like little things like if you hear her talking to other people about a certain thing, then be like oh i didn't know that blah blah blah or whatever she's talking about.. that's kinda what im going through too. except im 17.|`|srfZDygNaa	if youre 25 years old.. you have a problem. no grown man by now should have a problem taking to chicks. <br>  take a risk!
EJVKqFiHaa	I am a extreemly shy person and the way that i'm dealing with it (still shy) is find out why i'm shy. <br>  <br>  I learned that i'm shy because I want everyone to accept me, and if im quiet then usually people won't judge me for bad behavior and I'll be accepted. I am not myself and I don't have my own personality, i'm a stiff basically. <br>  <br>  I thought I just enjoyed being quiet when in reality I was dieing for someone to talk to. I always kept myself isolated and away from social gatherings to the point where I rarely know anything about life outside the room. <br>  <br>  What I do to fix it? Well, my method is talking to people. Just say hello and do my best to strike up a conversation. Realize its something that is curable and I don't have to live with it if I make the right choices.
kLN5hx6paa	Alright,<br>  <br>  I can relate to this, Normally I'm in the medical section but this question caught my eye.<br>  <br>  Look no one is worthless, your a guitarist - I envy you. I'm a piano player, what I'm getting at what you play can be played alone you could be a soloist easily, drums can't. <br>  <br>  My advice to you is this, Do take it slow what I mean by that is simple don't go rush to ask her out. However do talk to her, make her laught, take her places, buy her lunch or dinner. Ask her to listen to your guitar playing. DO NOT show that your trying to sell yourself or your competing against this other guy. Most important thing is be yourself. <br>  <br>  You can't go wrong with this method, if you didn't get her which I hope you do. Then you weren't what she was looking for, that doesn't make you worthless, that makes it her lost you seem like a good guy. Don't over stress this, go and wow her don't " ask her on a date " but if you take her out to dinner its clear she wouldn't mind a date. Then you can take it from there if you set up another one. Then when it becomes clear she likes you then ask her to be your girl. Pretend this other drummer boy doesn't exsist, if you stress it you might act or mess up in a way that will push her away.<br>  <br>  GoodLuck I'm here if you need me. Help is just a email away.|`|QGrIn7MXaa	dude man i no what u mean just go for it what do u have to lose? you don't have her now so just go for it and man ur not worthless u play guitar man that **** is tight, i made the same mistake ur about to make if you don't just belive in ur self and do it good look man|`|AIr5mQ7aaa	Come on bro, no one is worthless. If you underestimate yourself, you never know what you could of been capable of. <br>  <br>  If you don't try, you will never know, so just tell her how you feel.|`|ki8P8bYfaa	Join the club.  Same with me, only with a guy.  My mind is wrapped around him all the time!  Well, anyway, you are not worthless.  Who cares if your not the stongest guy?  Seriously, just go up to her and start a conversation and mention a place you'd like to go over the weekend and ask her to come.  If she says no, that's that, and she's stupid for not saying yes.

And also yes take it slow but maybe you can try some kind of casual group date kinda thing Like bowling, get a small group of mutual ffriends so that you get hang out with her more and put  your self out there, and since there will be other people there, there wont be a lot of pressure or anything. it'll be relaxed and fun!<br>  Hope i helped some(:|`|NWMrLImfaa	okay, first of all strength does not matter to a girl<br>  <br>  second, bands don't really matter unless the music you play is what that particular girl likes. Third, how fast you go doesn't really matter, just drop some hints so she's not surprised when you ask her. And most importantly, girls do not want to hear how many times you've done it, so please, no sexual jokes or comments too soon, you want her too feel comfortable around you. When guys make those jokes is when girls feel like things are moving too fast and you will seem like a perv.|`|fC6cKr1Haa	Thanks for answering my question! Sofar you have the best answer, it really helped. (: <br>  <br>  As for your's, have some confidence in yourself! Try talking to her more, and getting more of a basic relationship where you feel comfortable asking her out. But like you said, don't take too long. <br>  <br>  Think about it this way, you'd obviously be upset if Mark got the girl. But you'd be even more upset if he got her and you never even asked her. <br>  <br>  So just go for it! Good Luck! She sounds like a great girl (:|`|ziR2tx3Jaa	your not worthless first of all ive gone through the same thing but just because your friend is famous or better looking doesn't mean he is going to be a better boyfriend or going to treat her right!! you shouldn't give up!!! u should show her that you care about her and that you really like her and your there for her!!! you still have a chance!!! and if it doesn't work out in the end there are plenty of people out there for you and that doesn't mean you 2 wont be great friends!!<br>  hope this helps <br>  good luck!!|`|CeyuSMT9aa	My question is how is a 16 year-old high schooler a drummer in a 'famous band'?|`|PQw92IGHaa	First off, you can't think your worthless.  You deserve a hot girl as much as any other guy.  I think you have to go for it.  She might think that you aren't interested and end up with that other dude.  Also, write her a song...maybe something funny and goofy (not so much sappy)...because at the end of the day...you can play a great song on a guitar..where a drummer will just keep the beat!  GOOD LUCK and GO FOR IT!
hkLOvwFGaa	Hmmm.....I think you must switch off your<br>  mobile phone at night when you go to bed.<br>  That way it doesn't matter if someone is<br>  making nuisance calls. You will get a good<br>  nights rest.|`|0q5Z5zxIaa	it could be your ex boyfriend, but to be honest, it could be anyone. not necessarily even someone you know, it could be someone with the wrong number or prank calls. if you really think that it's your ex, just ask him if it was. if he says no, then let it drop. it's only a few phone calls, don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  sorry to hear about your cousin by the way, i hope everything will turn out okay for you.<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)
zChpODnnaa	Get your friend to talk him in to dumping you ;P If you don't want to dump him, that's what I did, since I really had hard time dumping a girl but I did that and the girl dumped me. I wasnt as sad but wasnt as happy, since I knew it was comming.|`|hF6uZqWRaa	would you rather dumb him (it would only take a few minutes) or deal with his selfish self? since you say he doesn't call you and talks about other girls. Trust me dumping someone is hard, ive done it twice but you will get over it. just think about what your going to tell him...just tell him things aren't working out for both of ya and you want to move on. be honest.|`|fvw664Ziaa	Uhhhm<br>  sounds alot like me & someone...we're not "techically" dating but we kinda are...like I eveen think my teacher thinks we're dating because he came by my desk & we like were wispering and crapp...<br>  anwyayss<br>  You should just go up to him & be like, "I'm sorry but I don't think this is working out very well could we just be frineds?"
4rLdaCNHaa	Ugly, much like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.<br>     And after seeing your picture, i can in all honesty say, that you've obviously been attracted to girls with vision problems or just totally blind.  I happen to find you very good looking.<br>    Its like i told my son, in grade school...you could be the most perfect child in the world, but kids will pick and pick until they find something wrong with you and if they still can't, then they will make it up until it does get to you. And it's so true, isn't it?<br>    Confidence does help, why not try the library, they have thousands of self help books, if you don't like one, then you can always move on to another. Much of them are based on studies of human behaviors, so they must have some pretty good ones and it won't cost you anything.<br>    But honest to god, your good looking, so believe it and start to think positively and don't be put off by a being turned down.<br>    A person can't really "reject" you, if they don't know you, so stop thinking it is rejection or your looks. Sooner or later your gonna hit on the right women.<br>    Gotta be something wrong with the girls over there!!!|`|WLj5UZoOaa	You not ugly :) just ignore them.|`|jkL4K7otaa	ha i have that same problem well not with the whole being called ugly everytime i ask someone out but the low confidence thing and really that is a problem.....try to fix it look in the mirror every morning and just say "i look dam secci" ;) <br>  <br>  and forget those girls who say ur ugly they hav no life and are bitches and just want to make people feel lower then them <br>  <br>  there are other fishies in the sea;)|`|gRXngD9aaa	You look fine to me.  Also, it appears you have big hands, and we all know what that means, you lucky devil.<br>  <br>  Maybe if you showed those girls on the street you other 'asset' you'd get more interest (wink, wink).|`|Zexhg9Lbaa	You are not ugly, i am uglier than you.<br>  If somebody calls you ugly just avoid them, you will get a girl who can see beauty in you.|`|K5Wr8Mcaaa	I don't think your ugly. You just haven't found the right gurl yet.|`|2GQv8dfgaa	idk i think youre probably a 3-4<br>  youre not like super super ugly!<br>  just be funny it comes down to your personality.<br>  so be cool and theyll like u if you get to know them|`|DwTTt628aa	your not ugly its just girls bein girls you will find someone keep looking
aa673f8d0b3f8397baf3af4288720b12aa	If he asks you out, you go girl. So what if she likes him, does he like her? There's nothing to suggest he does. You can do exactly what you like.  She is being selfish telling you she wont be your friend any more if you go.  Who says he will ever ask her out anyway. She could pull this trick with you every time you meet someone you both like so don't let her do this to you.|`|zx8cVDqIaa	A sensible person with common sense would know right from wrong.|`|0JgenGPtaa	since you said this "Friend" is selfish and never cares about anyone else, i think you don't even keep her as a friend.<br>  <br>  i know it may sound harsh, but it's her loss for not getting with the Guy when she had the chance.<br>  <br>  yes, you have the right to go out with "him". If Kelsey(your so call friend) end the friendship then that's her loss. she shouldn't be asking you not go out with him! it's not fair to you.<br>  <br>  i know it's hard, but let her her know how you feel about the guy and that you want to go out with him. and let her know if she's an understanding friend that she wouldn't hold you back from someone you like.<br>  <br>  I hope things turn out well for you and good luck:)|`|X6qrh5ZWaa	go for it, if she is your friend she would want you to be happy. and no matter what this guy is still going to like you and not her so it will be hard for her and you will feel bad but you have the right to love just as she does. <br>  <br>  and p.s. she never told anyone so its not like you did it to hurt her|`|JHzP1qtoaa	I say go for it. You were not informed of Kelsey's feelings for him, and its pretty crappy that she tells you now, are you just stated your feelings.|`|NvQETTJKaa	go out with him. if she's a true friend she'll get over it and eventually be happy for you two. a guy shouldnt end a GOOD friendship|`|nuV7tvVDaa	shes jelous that he likes you and you like him back.  its not your fault that she dint get it the way she wanted and shes putting the guilt on you.  plus its her fault for not telling the guy she liked him.  if she was your real friend, shed let you have him and move on|`|ulzTajOJaa	If you like him go out with him. I think she's being immature and selfish.|`|OXtYMoVLaa	This is a tough one because usually in this situation something always ends whether it would be your relationship with the guy eventually(which would be caused by your friend more likely) or your friendship. I would say it's not a problem if the guy knows your friend as well. He could have asked her out at any time but he's choosing to ask you out. I'd say don't worry about. Besides, as cruel as this may sound, you will go through friends throughout your entire life. So i say go for it and go out with the guy. If she was your friend, she wouldn't be threatening you with her friendship over a guy. She needs to grow up. Good luck!
Vnah73CEaa	The best thing to do is take your mind off of him, and then time will do the rest. The longer you don't think about him, the easier it will be to get over him. It's logic, and it worked for me.|`|BGPG2FaFaa	well go put ur attention on another guy

MzSFaebraa	Very Pretty.|`|LbNXxRXnaa	Uhmm couple things wrong with this:<br>  <br>  A) This picture says MY FRIEND at the bottom. So it's not you.<br>  B) You need a password to look at the pics. <br>  <br>  Sheesh|`|0gOWh0z2aa	You're cute, but I have no clue about your personality.|`|bmqJs2hwaa	I dont dig insecure chicks|`|zIjoaj3Baa	Cute like a little girl.

XvfVO8zgaa	Okay so maybe you should write her on the internet, like Myspace im pretty sure you and her have a myspace, and tell her your true feeling or just copy and paste you whole question you just wrote and send it to her and see how she feels about it. its always easier to admit things or tell somebody how you truly feel over the internet or texting them.<br>  Maybe she feels the same about you but was to shy to admit it or too shy to ask you out. and she might have gotten tired of waiting for you to step up and be a man and ask her out. so she probably moved on. maybe it was to ge you jealous so you know what your  losing and she wants you to feel whats its like without her so the you WOULD step up.<br>  <br>  She probably likes you too but you wont found out if you never ask.<br>  So i say you copy your WHOLE question, say that you postedthis on yahoo questions for advice and send it to her. And maybe she'll admit her true feelings for you.<br>  <br>  But dont get all heartbroken and down until you  know for sure what her true feelings are.<br>  <br>  If you have problems with telling someone something, always remember that the internet is a solution(: hehe<br>  <br>  Dont be afraid, your almost an adult.Youra guy and girls wait for guys to step up. So take that extra step and tell her how you feel(by coping this WHOLE question) imma girl and i know that if you send that question to her she will tell you her true feelings(:<br>  ~Patsy~|`|UP33GlBwaa	Im sorry for your troubles.  We all go through bad times.  It's not easy caring for someone and wanting to be with them and they dont feel the same way.  Time will help you to get over her.  Just try and stay busy and keep on boxing.  It will help you to stay on a good track and eventually you'll meet a great girl that will love you.  Good Luck!|`|0fygxRHLaa	think of how big her boobs were|`|8rzMDHMLaa	you dont... the exact same thing happened to me...cept i havent known her for three years.  the thing is u need to TELL her her that you have feeling for her and see where i goes from there. thats all i did. we arent going out but its better. express yourself towards her but dont do it obsessivly or like awkwardly. haha good luck man!|`|o6bl7Nkwaa	Well, to put it short. You can't.<br>  She's obviously a big part of your life which leaves you two options.<br>  1. Wait it out and hope they break up soon.<br>  2. Sabotage the relationship (if your caught, it could ruin your friendship)<br>  <br>  Hope I helped :)<br>  Sarla.
RqQ0K32Baa	This is sweet, I don't know why but when guys do stuff like this it makes me respect them more. Haha.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I think you should just give up for now. If she wants anything, she can help make it happen.<br>  <br>  But she could feel awkward since you guys broke up.<br>  <br>  I'm kind of in a problem like this and when he tries to talk to me for some reason i get awkward feeling and close up even though I want back with him more than anything. It's lame considering we were like best friends but maybe she's feeling the same things?<br>  <br>  And I would talk to her first, I prefer guys to start conversations with me after this kind of stuff. It makes me feel wanted.<br>  <br>  But she might be different.<br>  <br>  Good luck though. (:|`|YzdKR5MWaa	drop it, you'll know if she's sincere soon enough...
DcrI9zmkaa	He may have been flirting, yeah.  Don't get ahead of yourself, though.  People flirt.  It doesn't mean he wants to date you or anything.  Try getting to know him better, and then you'll better be able to gauge what he wants (& what *you* want).|`|cqzZjRVwaa	Well it sounds like he probably likes you, if you, like, get what I mean, like n stuff, like.|`|fox5a3ePaa	Of course|`|Pi0fVzv3aa	yess, it seems like he likes you more then flirting, because hes askign you personal informationn about where you live<br>  or he could be aksing that to stalk you and rape you<br>  so didn't give out personal information to guys you don't knoww<br>  or you'll learn the hard way..<br>  but it seems liek he likes you :)|`|48SlX2Yiaa	Yeah, he was asking personal questions and even asked to hang out.<br>  This guys sounds rather bold...|`|K5Wr8Mcaaa	I think he's interested and wants to get to know you.|`|62NmYVHMaa	the way he was acting i think it is more stalking|`|rj57MKHYaa	well ill tell you this, he likes you and wants to know more about you I used to be like that. yea he was and i think hes a hit it quit it unless you really get to know him.
e5M6Sxeyaa	* add on facebook, myspace of whatever.<br>  * wear a shirt that has alot of cleavage ;)<br>  * always smile, talk with friends have a good time...be noticeable haha<br>  * if he ever looks at you, look up and do a cute smile .
Uj5kuzoJaa	No I would be so sore after that. Especially because at that point it's no longer enjoyable. I'm good with just a couple hours at a time. I bet almost all the guys will say they would though and almost all the girls will say they wouldn't hahaha.|`|7iP6wTrqaa	Well, maybe not non-stop sex but it might be something to do on a boring Sunday!|`|Cgrd1CWoaa	no! thats way to long|`|vsjLO9k1aa	bad idea, you will be sore and so will she
3fcbca3714916fbe65f4ab8039bd7d32aa	you tell him that your uncomfortable with himsmoking pot my gf did an i havent smoked it since.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	People who smoke pot don't care about anyone but themselves and when they can get their next hit.  He's only 13, which means he's already making poor decisions that will affect him for the rest of his life.  Tell him he should quit and get help, then back off.  He probably won't care what you think anyway.
AA10862145	My favourites on a woman are Tresor, Boucheron, Amirage, Angel but these are not teenager smells.<br>  <br>  I think the fragrances that best suit the younger genre are fresh, slightly sweet (but not overly sweet), with a touch of white flowers for prettiness. Patchouli also works well, but requires a personality fit. Have you tried the Harajuku Lovers variations?|`|72a759eadcb04ef83b501e2c3dcde213aa	There was a particular perfume that drove me nuts (the sort that threw me off that none other perfume can). It's one that has some sort of pheromone concentration and it's one of those perfume that men would naturally attract to.<br>  <br>  I haven't asked the person who was wearing it at the time in case she got the wrong idea (she had a bf).<br>  <br>  If you experiment with samples or ask the store clerk about this sort of perfume, you should get a significant boost in attention you get from men.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|La4EHNo7aa	sweet|`|bDjI55FXaa	I was eating fruity gum once and a boy sitting beside me was like 'I smell haribo' .. though it was just fruity gum, so fruity can be good<br>  <br>  I've never bought vanilla perfume but a girl in class had it on and I was wondering so bad "what perfume does she use?" it smelled so good<br>  Go around debenhams or somewhere and try to find vanilla because I'm sure lots of people love vanilla it smells great =p|`|0K4ylh5Uaa	One guy's favorite perfume on a woman smells like crap to another man. I'm only answering this to let you know that perfume is meant to be discovered...not announce it's presence. Put the perfume on discreetly so that the guy your with finds it...*wink*|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	Anything that isn't flowery.  We don't like that.  Smells like a funeral.  Sweet, fruity, fresh...those are nice.|`|lICdV767aa	i wear fruity sweet stuff lol. i dont like the other smells.<br>  guys say i smell good :] lol
ig0Y3fE5aa	1. They don't know they are great, they have low self esteem<br>  <br>  2. They had a bad experience with one guy and they do not wish to get close with any others. <br>  <br>  probably some other reasons those are 2 main ones thoughlol|`|OXtYMoVLaa	Because they're looking for acceptance and their dads never showed them how they should respect themselves and what kind of guy to look for. Honestly you can kinda tell why they are the way they are if you look at their family. Also, a majority of guys (not gentlemen) will only acknowledge girls that are like that so they can get the sex from them and move on. And the girls that aren't acknowledge will eventually see this and will want to be noticed and will sadly change to be like that girl just so people can see her.
T4N6a7MQaa	Contrary to popular belief guys do notice a girl's personality whether she's skinny or not. We would notice is she didn't have boobs or had six instead of two.|`|GVlzdZKsaa	Big boobs rule.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	Its no contest. The 2nd one wins.|`|iwE1QRKdaa	I like skinny/normal girls|`|vBcqzMz4aa	skinny is always the better choice in my opinion, most skinny girls are really flexible and stuff *winkity wink* and if you desire a bit thicker woman you can plump them up to the perfect size. It's alot easier then dating a fat chick and begging her to lose weight lol|`|JCdBSULraa	I do prefer girls who are skinny and have small (or no) boobs, but as long as their BMI is under 28 or so, I don't really care about appearance or breast size.<br>  <br>  use <a href="http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/</a> to determine that is in lbs for your height, 28 is actually overweight.|`|7z9eKO2maa	a good figure/shape is unique to everyone, some people look amazing being really skinny with less in the breast area, but it also works the other way. it's impossible to really tell without any more information... sorry :/|`|EyaqiWPwaa	i like the girl who has a sandwich on her boobs and i can eat it ....either way i get a sandwich|`|RqTC18NFaa	Skinny is not attractive for me, I prefer a woman with some meat on her  bones and some curves.  I would take a 130-150 lb woman with nice curves anyday over a 100 lb beanpole.|`|YFXusnT1aa	It depends because I am an equal opportunity guy. I don't like a particular type of girl. Sometimes a woman can be sexy just with a cute smile, personality|`|UZodNAOkaa	I think you're going on a stereotype a bit but its true for some guys but guys who r like that r shallow so my answer is some guys|`|JizwgEiYaa	the 2nd one|`|qX4O0tc8aa	it depends on who your speaking to..<br>  if you were still athletic. and have bigger thighs and hips. some guys like that.<br>  <br>  some guys just want a tiny girl because they are shallow. in that case you shouldnt want aomeone like thta.<br>  but. in my opinion. idc about a body. there has to be a mental click there. ya kno?|`|yW2tK5uxaa	Big Girl, Big Boobs. It turns me on.|`|f8xmQjdkaa	Off the top of my head I can think of several people I know that fit each description, and if I could, I'd take any of them.  It doesn't matter to me with the chest, but as long as a girl is healthy and not overweight, then it's fine.  <br>  <br>  I'd take either :)|`|AA10743159	If you have ever hugged a skinny girl, believe me you would be much happier, with a girl with some meat on her bones, as they say.<br>  And what guy, can turn down nice breasts. Sure, lots of guys, like me, don't like huge breasts. To me anyway, anything over C cup, is way to much. While others love bigger breasts, as do others who love small ones.<br>  There is always someone out there, for every shape and size.
aPtj7HbVaa	no it's not go right ahead girl!|`|ZfvFjxpwaa	If you dont think it is then its not. If you want to know, just ask ;3 hehe.|`|a9BMA7wpaa	probly not
aUDVBmZSaa	It's very close by these descriptions, I'd just have to personally know these two girls to make a choice.|`|CdUvu8D8aa	number 2 but dont change for a guy
MYbRICxqaa	You are already know what to do. If you do want to date this guy again then take it easy. And stop listening to rumors go to the horses mouth.|`|Kvajun9yaa	if he hooks up with a lot of girls i would not do it i think it is about how comfortable you are with yourself in order to do that and you already have feelings for him so you  might just get hurt!- good luck|`|qmMCGKl9aa	if you want to do the whole friends with benefits, then i say go for it.<br>  but if you want a relationship then don't do anything with him.<br>  <br>  because if you hook up with him hes gonna think wat do i wonna be in a relationship with her for? im getting wat i want.|`|sGYl7971aa	Go with your instincts, you already said he broke up with you, and now he likes you "again"?  I think you might want to consider finding someone who likes you all the time, and wants to do more than hook up with no strings|`|FH2rD2aUaa	he likes you but hes keeping his options open.<br>  <br>  its up to you wether you want to keep going or move on|`|nRcSFAxlaa	he is using you. cut him loose and find someone else. he is not worth it.|`|lMu2J3pNaa	he sounds like a man-ho....no offense<br>  if hes really doing things with other girls that he doesnt want u to kno about, its cuz he wants u to think ur the only girl hes with, get u in bed, and dump u on the street afterwards|`|oNkxVdSjaa	he's either making you jealous or he's a total retard..COME ON GIRL! you can do better than him, he rejected you, now you should move on, forget the past!!<br>  <br>  i'll pray for you..<br>  <br>  XxXxXx|`|s0kDsoooaa	you can do better than him.. move on. answer mine please x
AA11150213	If you split up with someone it's not a good idea to keep seeing them if you want to move on. By constantly seeing each other you're allowing yourself to stay emotionally attached, and preventing yourself from getting over the person.<br>  <br>  If you still want to be with the person and they want to be with you than perhaps you need to discuss whatever issue caused you to break up in the first place. If it is an issue that the two of you can work out and make better than perhaps you can give the relationship a try.<br>  <br>  However, if you don't want to get back together than stop seeing each other. Like i said it will only make you stay attached and keep you from moving on.
scyLaz0saa	Hmm I think they just want to do a few things.<br>  1) See how you react.<br>  2) See if they can make you uncomfortable (and joke about it later).<br>  <br>  It would be easier to aid you if I knew the questions.
h52mKmdsaa	haha i think its funny yea kinda akward but yea it happens nothing any of us can do about it lol
pKzH1cFHaa	A real man would accept you the way you are and you are probably not giving him enough credit. If you are too chicken to be yourself around him, then you need to dump him. <br>  <br>  When my fiance met me, I was bigger than I am now, and apparently (according to him and some other people I worked with), tons of guys were mad that he asked me out before they could. I wouldn't give someone who loves me for me for anything.|`|jYy6dDAZaa	If ur lying on the internet what makes u think he isn't?|`|dttNFTXYaa	if you weigh nine hundred pounds your boyfriend shouldnt care. if he really loves you it wont matter. and just an opinion of mine i dont think long distance relationships really work out that well. and you shouldnt lie to your boyfriend.|`|IjXoLSU1aa	he's your bf right, so it doesnt matter what you look like, he's gunna want to see you no matter what. he wont be bothered if you think your a bit bloated.<br>  <br>  If its long distance, then you shud go for it.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|6nIXYGu6aa	you should be like hey!  oh my god.  how could i forget that!  hey i can't see you this weekend, its my friends birthday!  we are soo close i can't miss it, we have some partyin to do|`|jLKmyNBMaa	You feel to fat? If he likes you then that wont matter, its not like you suddenly gained 50 pounds, don't cancel for that reason..See him, he wont care|`|VLRCARCfaa	Be confident and see him!!   I'm sorry but even if you starve yourself for the next 7 days your going to look pretty much the same next week when you see him.<br>  <br>  If he cares about you then it won't matter... and if you really have that big of a complex about it then tell him the truth!!<br>  <br>  Lying in a relationship won't get you very far... if you feel that he is that superficial you might wanna reconsider this relationship.|`|0Vmn3vnHaa	he should care what you look like
3qjtZphNaa	i wouldnt wear those <br>  they arent cute at all<br>  <3|`|dEL25yelaa	wear what you feel comfortable in. Have fun!
47a351e058b1e2e9d4f9a2bfc0f35883aa	youll be fine... just have fun.|`|jGKGlxAuaa	Talk about that farting contest you won last semester, and you are hoping to turn pro next season.<br>  <br>  Remember all the attention you received after winning, even getting you picture in the newspaper.<br>  <br>  You were awesome, Dude!
LHxDNIWGaa	Just keep on liking him until he breaks up w/ her... and make a move! idk!|`|KZfYzhZRaa	whats the question?|`|dV6nEBUdaa	whats the question?|`|BeKJUOaBaa	corner him and tell him then itz up 2 u|`|T3nvV9G3aa	Uhh, what do you want help with?|`|JizwgEiYaa	forget about him... hes taken... get your own|`|HtwhcFdfaa	He has a girlfriend, respect that!|`|EyaqiWPwaa	well heres what i would suggest....make him a sandwich and then give it to him ....hell know you like him more than a friend then
oOhvAV4Laa	You should let the girl that likes you the you care for her but as a friend ans that is it, As for the girl that you like. u should asked her out N be like honest and tell her that you want a serious relationship with her..<br>  and just clear everything... with them<br>  <br>  -aRi|`|PQw92IGHaa	To be honest you are in a really bad spot.  If they are truly best friends, the other girl won't go for you because her friend is into you.  You can try being honest, and telling the girl that you like her a lot but you were really into her friend.  It sounds harsh, but that is the only way I can see you having a chance with her bestfriend.  It's doubtful even if you do that.|`|DcrI9zmkaa	(I'm wondering why you went out with a girl you didn't like in the first place...)<br>  <br>  Anyway, this situation is pretty much doomed.  Either you'll get one girl and bust up their friendship or you'll lose both of them.  All you can do is be honest, but you better be prepared for the fallout.|`|lYctCgNlaa	tell her your not into her and you just t t wanna be bff|`|rj57MKHYaa	just what the other guy said leave it be and find a new chick man. its how its going to have to be dont be selfish or i will like kick your ***.|`|zx8cVDqIaa	Turn them both down, you can't ruin two persons relationship and think of your own pleasures.|`|71VRvldJaa	If I were you, I'd get right out of this triangle!  There is no good that can come of this.....you're going to end up with neither of them and the best friends are going to end up hating each other!  Don't get involved in complicated situations like this!
4j6DSEqFaa	Not really. I am in 9th grade and let me tell you something. I haven't had a boyfriend yet, but I have some things that might make you think. I was always kind of friends with the popular people because well at my school it is easy to be...well...sorta. Anyway guys don't really like shy girls, but guys do like smart girls. Believe or not they do. I was always told they do, but didn't believe it until recently. I like a popular guy and he likes me back (he told me so). I talk to him alot but our situation is a little different because <br>  Long story Short: My mom dated his uncle his mom & brother lives with his uncle we went to his house alot I started to like him now he likes me 2.<br>  Guys like girls who can be themselves and can have fun and that are smart. So I mean start testing your self and get out of that shy mode. Last year I was kind of shy if really depended on what class i was in or who I was around but I was shy and never danced at parties and now I slowly progressing. At a party a week ago I danced and I'm not shy around anyone. And a popular boy likes me & I'm one of the skinniest little girls out there. So test yourself into moving out of your shell. And you will find the right boy.|`|jQKdFV3Waa	if you ant to be noticed dotn be shy( some popular guy see and like shy gals)
UE07ucqWaa	if it's safe:-<br>  basiaclly they need reasurance that your gunna be ok - if u dont have a cell phone the best thing to do is to tell them that ur friends have phones and they sed you can use them.<br>  <br>  let them take you there and pick you up - dont stay there for hours.<br>  make sure you tell them you have enough money - so you can use a pay phone if u really need to. tell them what friends your gunna be with (just stick to girls if u have to). and reasure them that your not gunna go anywhere else apart from the bowling alley.|`|SditxwbPaa	I think you might be a little too young for an unchaperoned event.<br>  <br>  I wuz 15 before they even considered it and that is if my older brother went with us.<br>  <br>  I am sorry, but I have to vote for your parents on this one.|`|d5fcb2Ioaa	its time for you to learn how to lie.|`|plBXp91Daa	Your 13 years old very young maybe is it ok if you go to a bowling alley near by your house if there is one so that your parents don't have to worry about you. Or otherwise give you your cellphone back so that they can call you so and then. I tell you if they let you go they do that because they trust you so don't let your parents down because they will never let you go alone with your friends.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	well you are 13, are you a responsible sensible kid though. you're parents dont hang out with you so they can have fun you know. its for your safety - whether you know it or not yet. <br>  First up, whinging, begging, crying, argueing, will get you no where, <br>  What will? be a responsible, nice, great to be with kid. Not only will it make your relationship with your parents better - they will see you are more mature, and they will see you are now old enough to make good decisions for yourself. But until you do that, they will always chaperone. No time like the present to grow up.|`|ubofHDxPaa	hmmmmm <br>  <br>  Sometimes you just have to take it easy. Thirteen is a little young. I know it seems like you can't do anything but later on in life you will have plenty of time to do "things".|`|qmMCGKl9aa	your too young to be with a boy anywho.<br>  <br>  your friends aren't gonna let you out alone. i can tel you that right now and i dont even know you.|`|Qe95LNxYaa	just tell them the story that you wrote here|`|QrOJ8f7aaa	Welcome to the world of lying, honey.

Obviously there are people out there that find you attractive. Stop fishing for compliments.|`|3u4HU7rdaa	dont be scared of what other people think. you are who you are. embrace that, and hey your bf thinks its adorable, and his opinion is important. so love yourself. it's okay, i've seen shorter. ur pretty though.|`|K5Wr8Mcaaa	Your 5 foot and self conscious..

HnEcgVGiaa	I answered a similar question before, so here it is again:<br>  <br>  An ideal girlfriend would also be my best friend. Someone who I can share all of my life with and someone who will share hers with me. The ideal girlfriend would see past my shortcomings and still love. It is someone who I can love back with all of my heart. We would have our own inside jokes where we'd be laughing while everyone else is confused. We would go on our own expeditions. We would help each other whenever we need help.<br>  <br>  The ideal girlfriend would be understanding, patient, kind, warm, and faithful. Her honesty allows me to trust her completely. Her compassion allows her to offer help to others in need. We would volunteer together at local charities, shelters, or other organizations.<br>  <br>  She would be someone who loves God with all of her heart. She would be family-oriented and would protect her family and friends at all costs.<br>  <br>  Sooner or later, I will realize she is my soul mate, and I just cannot live without her.|`|OCMrQVRxaa	nice sensitive 1 not 2 clingy and alwas up 4 a laugh|`|lj3e3rE4aa	I prefer dudes with huge dongs.|`|XBjy2ADpaa	fun girls, like girls that never want to do anything but watch tv and shop are really boring, like i don't know maybe it is just me but i can't stand girls like that, like i want to be able to go out and do something and have fun..

Stop trying to please her and do your own thing. <br>  <br>  You have every right to have the evening to yourself after work, I guess this girl doesn't work so she doesn't get how tiring it can be. <br>  <br>  Be firm and tell her that if she is your friend, really, that she will understand that going out means you making a big effort on your part and that the least she could do is make the effort to wait for you before leaving.<br>  <br>  Now if she doesn't you've just discovered that she doesn't care about you and is therefore not someone you should be calling a friend. <br>  <br>  Hope it works out for you :-)|`|877cce02fda50057f8296485bc952536aa	Oh you poor thing, it sounds like you're in a real predicament. My feelings on this are, that if Lisa is a true friend she wouldn't expect you to meet everyone there if she knows it would make you feel uneasy. I presume this would involve you travelling alone and making your way to the disco alone too. Not something anyone would want to do late at night. It sounds like she's being selfish and not considering your feelings at all. If I were in your position I wouldn't go. I think I'd feel fed up and pushed into doing something that I didn't want to do. If Lisa gave you a hard time for not doing something that SHE wants you to do then she isn't a friend worth keeping. She sounds like a bully to me. Find someone that considers YOUR feelings. Good luck with deciding what to do. :)|`|uVuYdcRcaa	What should you do?!<br>  <br>   STAND UP FOR YOURSELF!!!<br>  <br>  Gosh, hun if you don't want to go, don't go - if you go out when you rather not, you won't enjoy it anyhow.<br>  <br>  I use to work late shifts till 10pm before I had my son and quite often the last thing I wanted to do was to get ready for a night out - all I wanted was my PJs, a warm drink and my bed!<br>  <br>   If you do want to go to the disco then you either see if you can leave early from work or get one of your mates to meet you outside the disco so you don't have to walk in by yourself.<br>  <br>  But seriously, look at making your own choices.<br>  <br>  This 'LISA' sounds a bit of a bully!<br>  <br>  Lx
iwvRBeXOaa	Because when we go through pain we learn and grow and therefore, become a better person.<br>  <br>  Sex for the first time hurts like once, MAYBE twice and if the guy goes slow it doesn't even hurt that bad. Once you start having sex more frequently the small amount of pain is a distant memory. Any woman who has given childbirth will tell you it hurt like hell, but the second they held their baby in their arms there was no pain to be felt, only joy.<br>  <br>  Growing up means accepting that some things will hurt, you can't be afraid to try things or you'll never truly live.

n9cJdDBjaa	Yes, people generally grow prettier as they grow older.  I.e., we lose the baby fat on our cheeks, our face grows longer, and our cheekbones start to show.  I'm 15 too and I know this because i've watched my sister change.|`|E14cuDlZaa	Dude! Your only 15 and in Grade 9!!! Those are the  worst days for everyone!<br>  <br>  I was an ugly little Acne filled kid in Grade 9 and before, and was wondering if i was ever going to grow up to be a handsome guy myself... And i did!! I'm now 6'3 and i must say, I'm not Ugly anyways haha. <br>  <br>  I also found a Beautiful little Lady-Friend who makes most guys Jealous. Trust me man, you'll be good! Just wait a few years. It always gets better.
sEryEzoyaa	ok well i m a girl so i know wat i do when i like a guy ;) i sneak quick glances at him, smile at him whenever he tlks to me, want to b where he is, try to dress really nice around him, and i usually tilt my head when talking to him but that might just b me =) hope that helped :)|`|qp19ASuzaa	Okay.  First of all. Lighten up. Don't sit around *waiting* for a girl to show signs she likes you.  If you're talking about a certain girl, talk to her first, then go from their.  But usually if a girl likes you she won't let you know right off the bat.  If she's interested she might blush and get all shy around you.  Maybe she'll screw around with her hair and smile a lot.  Also, for me, when I like a guy; I blush...A LOT.  If I like a  guy I always find some way to embarrass myself in front of him.

I don't know exactly, it could be many things. it's a wait and see situation!<br>  <br>  He may suddenly come out and say he likes you, sometimes boys can be a little off with you when they like you, they're just sorting out their feelings.<br>  All the best.|`|eSDpEwhyaa	Don't answer any questions to anyone unless he tells you something Dont even make comments about him.

If you like her back, then ask her out on a date, if your old enough... or whatever it is that kids do now to hang out.

EoH6Fnwkaa	Yes as long as they're not sluts, if thats what your referring to. But yeah a down to earth girl and that's not shallow. It's not impossible and most women prefer long lasting relationships without sex in it, after all it's not their first priority.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	That is such an unbelievable generalization. Attractive, unattractive...whatever, every woman is different. I'm sure that many attractive women go a long time without being intimate with someone and many unattractive women may have a different guy every night. It depends on the respect that they have for themselves and their morals and what they feel is right or wrong and how they want to live their lives. Looks really play a very small part when it comes to casual sex.|`|303dbc9a11680b5deb062fbc8e8ddba1aa	yes they do. Perhaps some women feel the need to constantly be in a relationship but there are plenty of attractive women who only want to be in a relationship if it's a good one and those aren't always easy to find.|`|bhnPUzypaa	woman can go a long time without being intimate i guess, however some can't it just really depends on the person really, and not all attractive woman find someone to be intimate with.<br>  <br>  It is all down to who that person is :)
R2BBjtaraa	ok first of all his best friend likes you again? or his best friend tells you your ex likes you again?<br>  <br>  <br>  good for you to stick up for your friend. friendship should come before guys and obviously hes not a very good boyfriend if he breaks up with you just because you stood up for your friend.  if a guy is shallow enough to break up with you because of that then forget him, he's not worth it|`|nIkFQfE2aa	dont talk to him..if he got mad because you defended your friend then he is no good!! Ignore him like he ignored you! You need a nice guy not some jerk!
FLPRFTccaa	give me 10 points|`|Oqf65Cisaa	i think that she finds you attractive and one day you too will be together?<br>  but i think she likes her boyfriend more at the moment. <br>  friends.|`|nlqVEjhQaa	Maybe she's doing that because she knows that her current boyfriend, who is probably not the greatest person if they've already broken up, isn't going to be around forever. Since you're her good friend and she trusts you, she knows that you'd be a perfect pick-up when she's done with the other guy.<br>  She knows you like her and she's using your feelings in her favor.|`|nuV7tvVDaa	she prolly thinks of yyou as a friend but if you told her you liked her maybe shell like you back
ADpPVwdNaa	She may see it as being cocky, and after not speaking to you for a while or seeing you, it probably made her uncomfortable that you "assume" you're perfect for her. For all you know, she might have a boyfriend who she likes a lot. She also probably feels confused from you going from saying "Thanks for being an immature baby the last time we talked and have fun being fat, ugly, and alone," to saying that you're the perfect guy for her. Would her perfect guy call her fat, ugly and lonely? Probably not.<br>  <br>  So, that's what's up. It's all on you.
dRiH2Uszaa	Oh my god, I am so sorry.This must hurt so bad...

I saw it again today and i was a little confused, so i looked at his questions he has asked and its the same question as before.  He just wants girls to talk to him.
Uj5kuzoJaa	It really depends on why you two split up in the first place. If he hates your guts then there's really not much you can do about it. Try being friends first. Hang out just as friends for awhile and see where things go from there. After awhile maybe sit him down and talk to him. Ask him why things went wrong. Ask if maybe you two can try to make it work again. Though you need to ask yourself, why did you two break up in the first place. Has anything changed?|`|fox5a3ePaa	I little more information as why you split up might be helful|`|IUlh5pqWaa	You don't, they're an ex for a reason x|`|7cf4b3bd36e805b27e9c6125e10e129aaa	the answer's simple - you don't|`|WLsS5vxsaa	Here is a great article.

vkDKUCOZaa	Just move on hun, u will look desperate.....|`|Oyvlt2vyaa	You broke up for a reason, it wasn't meant to be.  Most breakups go through this stage, of wanting the other person back.  You've just got to be strong and distract yourself from this guy.  You don't need your ex boyfriend back, enjoy yourself without him.  Good luck.  :)
XBjy2ADpaa	tell them that if any of them fight each other then you don't want anything to do with them, like in that way.. and that you don't want to be treated like a prize or something...|`|J5vBQ5I0aa	just tell all three of them you do not want a boyfriend and you dont want them to fight over you becasue you just want to be friends
Yfg2ggBwaa	Sounds like he wants time apart from you. I can't really tell you how to feel, but if I was in your shoes I'd give my significant other some space and give it time. Don't want to rush into anything, and remember you are young.|`|gXxEsWcxaa	umm, why don't you move in with him?|`|uNJirnYoaa	you don't sound very mature to me.  a mature person would know how to handle this situation and not ask a ton of strangers. they'd also realize they are in a jacked up relationship.|`|vWXSQDWlaa	i think hes right. its ok to go over there and stuff to see him, but if ur with him a ton over there its gonna look weird and not that great for you and him. so i think u shouldnt move in with him. ur too young and yes if u r IN the apartment with him, u might get preg. stay young and happy!|`|6lirnoXOaa	thats pretty early to be practically living together<br>  use it as an escape from your sisters if you must but sparingly<br>  dont want to rush things and push him away early on|`|cHkH7ESuaa	Your guy sounds lame.

F0sfmZFnaa	AWWWW that is so sweet!!! I am in marching band too and LOVE it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D<br>  <br>  Well, to be honest, there is a fine line between cute and cheesy. With T-shirts - especially band ones - avoid actual pictures on the shirt, for instance, like a picture of HIM - big no-no. Just some simple text on a solid shirt is always good, especially if its one of those marching band/music quotes that only band nerds like us get. :) again, not too busy - no pictures - puns are always cute.<br>  <br>  If you are still kinda shaky on the whole shirt thing, and still want to do something with your marching band, why don't you do a marching band pillow? Like one that sits on his bed - we do that at my school for the seniors; underclassman band members make a decorative pillow that has pictures a quotes and their instrument and all that on it and those seniors TREASURE it!! You can use fabric sheets that you print out and can do pictures and stuff. Just look in wal marts arts/crafts area, they have TONS of stuff in the sewing area.<br>  <br>  Good luck...and you are right, i'm sure anything you give him he'll love. :)|`|UxqC80LAaa	Yeah, that'll be good.<br>  And remember to get one for yourself so you guys can be looking cute... and cute TOGETHER.<br>  <br>  Buutt.

You ask this question as if you were an old man, but in fact you are just beginning your life. You are probably on your way to starting your career and establish a foundation for your life, and your first concern should not be finding someone to be intimate with. <br>  <br>  Save your innocence for someone you truly love, and who feels the same way, not for a woman you will meet on the internet for sex. It's complicated, but their are ways around your shyness. Just being an overall kind person with an open heart is all you need to find the woman made for you, and trust me, their is someone for everyone. <br>  <br>  Don't ever lose confidence based on your age or the fact that you haven't ever kissed a girl before. Just never lose hope.<br>  <br>  Good luck, man.|`|C9C9EAyiaa	It won't if you don't get an std and don't feel the need to tell anyone I don't think it would at all...Lol I feel like I'm giving you the wrong answer.

If this is the case then having sex with a random person probably would not be good for you. Wanting something that is deep can not be filled with a shallow void, but if you just wanted sex I could see where you are coming from.|`|sO2CKU1uaa	Please don't do that.

56vmjlGDaa	Yes that girl probably likes you, she is just shy. Try like to talk to her after school or something. Try to make friends with her and just talk about stuff that you both like. If you are shy she might come to you first an make a move. Just act as flirty as you can, make her laugh or something, just when you know it you will be her best guy, friend. I remember that this guy use to like me and he became my best friend, he used to make me laugh all the time tickled me an stuff, he always stared at me in class. Later i started to like him, he was so cute. Finnally he asked me out and i said yes. Remember to make your move, make her laugh, and win her heart before someone else does.|`|cdpzBVAFaa	I think she likes you but is shy. You must ask for her help (create a problem if you dont have any) in that way you both can spend more time together. If she likes you she will definately help you if she knows the answer.

3XFX8sLhaa	Hey! Firstly i think you are very pretty and have an amazing body, and i am VVV jelous! second of all i think his problem is with the image that these pictures portray of you, you may not be but men and women alike will look at you with you body out, the tan the blonde hair, the make up and think you are being a bit slutty by parading yourself. Maybe beacuse you are his girlfriend, he want you to project a more classy or ladylike image, because aswell as representing yourself in the way you look, your representing your boyfriend too. <br>  <br>  But all in all, i think if you are comfortable, and you should be, i wish i had your looks and confidence, then do as you please, and don't let him put you down. If you feel comfortable and like that image is part of you then dont change 4 n e one, if you dress like that to get attention and look hot to other people, not 4 yourself, then maybe he is right and you do need to reconsider. <br>  <br>  Good luck Darling. x|`|y2l0Nse1aa	well, first of all you are one hot chick so it gives him the impression that you are making yourself to benoticed out there just in case two of you guys don't work out. if it was shot in plain tshirt and jeans without model type posing it would be ok. trust me i am a guy.  you should be more concerned if he didn't care which means he is willing to share you with others. hope you get the drift.|`|4d586bbaf718130eaa4cea32fff1b88faa	tell him to stop being a cry baby guys gonna look regardless|`|52apRUE6aa	maybe u shouldnt do that? as a guy if my gf did that i would ne a little mad.|`|TstiC2Ilaa	Not EVERYONE has these types of pictures on myspace. I don't and a lot of other girls dont. True, your pretty and you have a nice body, BUT you know showing it off like that is disrespectful to your boyfriend. So, what's more important, showing your stomach to the world or respecting your boyfriend?<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  And also, hun, you KNOW those pictures are for attention and compliments. It's obvious. You could have told us what the pictures looked like, but instead you posted them AGAIN because you know guys are going to compliment it. Good job in proving your boyfriend right.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	Your Very Pretty and attractive. It would make me mad if my girlfriend posed for pics like that to, for other guys to look at.|`|3ILoAb8daa	He's pissed because honestly it makes you look trashy. Your a beautiful girl with a nice body, but when you show your body off like that it makes you look easy, even though you thinks its just a "trend" and it's "cute". So, just be respectful to your boyfriend and delete them off your myspace. You can still take pictures like this with your friends and they can have them on their myspace, and so if you must show off they will still be online, but just to show your boyfriend you care take them off myspace. I agree with Kari V completely btw.|`|pUNWFSDfaa	He's being over protective. Your HOTTTT. Any guy thats with you should be happy that he is. He's a lucky guy. You need to be with somone that understands that a beautiful girl like you should be proud to show a little off, and he should be proud to be with you. Drop this loser.|`|zIjoaj3Baa	If my girlfriend pulled that, yeah....I'd be pretty pissed.

47656d33be33ab59b93a1031373f0c0eaa	Well, you should defiantly start by getting to know her. Find out what she likes and dislikes. Some girls like flirting and like lots of attention, but they just keep saying, no, stop, but really they like it. It's just weird like that. Are you friends with her? If you aren't that's a good place to start. Put yourself into her social group somehow. You want to be part of her group of friends. Once you're in there, then you can start getting to know her. Find out what you two have in common (or if you don't mind lying a bit, if she finds something interesting and cool, you can also pretend to be super into it.) Let her blab on to you about a whole bunch of stuff you have absolutely no interest in. If you are interested, that's a huge +. Try to start conversations now and then about things you know she could just talk about all day long. You don't want to be too obvious at first though. Just play it cool and make it seem like you genuinely just want to be good friends. Over time, could be, instantaneous,  days, weeks, months; eventually you will be almost like her best friend, her go to guy, her reliable contact. Once it reaches this certain level, then you can slowly start moving out of the friend zone. Just try to flirt with her a bit, watch her body language. If she flirts back, or likes it, then do it more often, otherwise you still need to just be friends until she likes it. If you're still stuck in the friend zone, take notice of everything, if she like changes her hair, or you notice a new outfit, or new makeup, compliment her on it. Just real simple like, your hair looks nice. Nice is a really nice word for these situations because its just friendly and effective as a compliment. If you say something like, WOW your hair's gorgeous today. Then you are probably going to freak her out. If you aren't sure how she feels about you, then find an inside contact. Become good friends with one of her friends. If you trust her friend enough, tell her friend you have feelings for her. Then have her friend find things out for you, giving you leeway into her thoughts. Of course, all of this is relative to what type of girl the girl you like is. Just saying she's hot doesn't equate to her personality. Most girls that are down to earth can be won over with the tips above. However, if she's the jock lover type, then be mean to her. Just annoy her, she'll say she hates it but in fact she loves it. Be loud and impulsive, those types of girls love *** holes. If she is this type of girl, just kind of act like a clown that's going nowhere in life. The kind of guy she thinks she can change, but is infact a lost cause. Which is why with these types of girls, they go through maybe 4-10 guys throughout middle school and high school. They never get it until they mature. I'm hoping for you that the girl you like is like the first kind I described, not the second kind. But if she is the second kind, if she's really hott enough, why not right? Enjoy while it lasts :-P<br>  <br>  Good Luck
S8FjI00vaa	I understand how you feel. It's like having to pick the lesser of two evils.<br>  You love your boyfriend and you like this new guy. It's hard to decide who you want because on the one hand, you have history with your bf. It feels like home. But on the other hand, you have this new guy who you don't know quite as well. He's new and exciting. If I was you, then I would go somewhere that I can be alone with my thoughts. Then I would get a piece of paper and write down all the pros and cons of both guys. Just make sure you put the paper somewhere people who you don't want to see it won't find it. Making this list will let you see which guy has more qualities that you like. Then, after studying this list, your raw emotions will come out and you will see who you want most. I hope I could help.
gHS5bU8Saa	Aw, that's cute. Ok. Well you really like this girl, its totally normal the way you feel. Just talk to her like shes you're best friend or something. She's just like you and me, a person.

Trust me she knows you are going crazy trying to figure it out. She knows what she I doing. If you want to get back at her ignore her at all costs. Pretend she is not even there. It will drive her nuts. Or you could just date her friends. <br>  <br>  This is why I don't hang out with girls...I am happily married and there is no drama in my marriage bacause we don't hint at things or play head games. if we want something we just ask, we don't hint we don't play games. Unless we want to.   ;)|`|PTwQMnTRaa	Very simple.  Girls love attention.<br>  <br>  Very simple. Girls are unstable for 12 weeks of the year.<br>  <br>  Very simple.

csrOirkqaa	yes its hard to let go of someone, but if it's the best for him and especially you, you will need to do so. You will feel bad and hurt in the beginning, but trust me, you will get over it. I had to do the same and now I found someone that loves me and been married for 5 years now. Before he breaks it off, you should do it, go with your head up. Don't show him that you are sad or have been crying. You will be fine, I promise.|`|zCZDiCbwaa	i think you should get back with him because your fights can make you stronger but wait for a bit if he comes back to you know then you know its true love <br>  if he doesnt talk to him one last time and tell him how you feel and just drop it <br>  it may be really hard but its a part of life you will get over it some day
PZxn0xtCaa	I know what that's like only i was the other friend. Going from personal experience, try and put your friends needs first. Talk to her and make sure she doesn't feel left out, but don't break up with the boy. If she's a good friend, she'll tell you if it really bothers her.
143f9530216dfb9e78a759118b56a704aa	Just look at him in his eyes.<br>  Your eyes will talk to him much more than your words.<br>  If he is the right one for you at this time of your life, he will understand everything without words and will take some steps.|`|7xnMr6zVaa	keep talking with him and you be flirting with him with out knowing

osZ5zVEDaa	Okay so mine was a second date, but hilariously bad. I learned from that point on that I was just not interested in Drama chicks. <br>  <br>  Okay let us go back through the eons to the land before time... <br>  <br>  I was in Middle School and went to the 8th Grade Graduation Dance with this Girl named Charlotte. We got along really well in History class and she asked me out on a Date. I was old school, but thought okay sure why not. We go on a first date and it did not go great, but not bad. We then decide to go to the Dance. She more begged me to go. I told her I did not Dance. At the time I did not feel comfortable doing so. She told me that it was okay if I did not Dance. I was confused as the name of the event included the term "Dance", but she said that it did not matter. Their were other things to do at the dance and it would be fun. First time I learned that women lie to you and themeselves about the weirdest crap.<br>  <br>  So we go to the Dance and hang out with friends. After 30 minutes there she asks "Wanna Dance?" <br>  My response "..uhhh... well I thought we had talked about this. I don't dance.. soo... No I don't." <br>  "But we are at the Dance. Come on I am sure you will be fine. Lets just Dance.". <br>  "Charlotte I told you when you asked that I do not Dance. You said it was fine that I didn't so here I am. I do not want to dance."<br>  "oh come one. I really want to Dance with you!" at which point she drags me out to the dance floor and starts dancing. I am staring at her incredulously with a  WTF look on my face. <br>  "Charlotte I am done with this. I am going to go do something else." <br>  I then leave her at the Dance floor looking rather sad, but not feeling bad in the least because I had told her upfront how I felt and Fck That! I then go and start hanging out with a friend. She storms over and tells me that I am being selfish for not Dancing with her. I again calmly tell her that she told me it would be okay if I came and did not Dance. I replayed the events for her as they happened before coming and told her I would not Dance with her just because she felt like I should. She then call me an a$$hole and stormed off. <br>  <br>  My friend proceeds to laugh and my now uncomfortable position. Well he was laughing until 20 minutes later he and two other of my friends are asked to Dance with her. This was a very obviouse attempt to make me Jealous and I was not biting. At which point he begs me to go Dance with her so that she will leave him alone. I laugh at this and say "Hell No!"<br>  <br>  Later one of her friends comes over and tell me she is crying and all unhappy because I won't dance with her. She tells me I am being a real prick and should just go Dance with her. I tell this friend what had happened before we had decided to come there and said I would not go dance with her. She then gets pissed at me and says I am being a selfish jerk. I should have known she would want to Dance by the faact she wanted to come and just shouldn't have come if I didn't want to dance. She then storms off.<br>  <br>  Charlotte comes over 5 minutes later and tells me if I don't Dance with her she is going to kick my a$$. I am doing the incredulous WTF look on my face again. First she is 4'11" and I am easily 6'. Uh... then she halls off and punches me in the arm. It didn't hurt, but it was sudden. I tell her to stop and then she starts trying to shove me and hit me. I basically held her back as she then started just swinging her arms at me. At the end of the night I leave despite her Dad being my ride home and just walk the 2 miles. <br>  <br>  That was the worst date ever for me. The next day she asks why I wasn't talking to her. She was obviously perplexed. She saw no reason for me not wanting to have anything to do with her speacial case of crazy. <br>  <br>  I am now Married, Happy, and living with no Drama. There are non crazy women out there. You just have to be willing to put up with nothing less.|`|EyaqiWPwaa	well here is what happened ....everything was goin good we met we had a good day and then all of a sudden we both got hungry so she took me back to her place and she made me a sandwich...which was awesome!!!!...but then she took me to her room and tied me down to her bed and then started making sandwiches and WASTING THEM she started throwing them on the ground and then she would step on them...i cant stand for sandwiches to be wasted....terrible date

EdidZdtlaa	he does care girl. he just trying not to show it. but he likes you. he trying to spit his lil game lolz jk. but talk to him about you guys more. that make sense? good luck.|`|KlRsBt5waa	It's easy for girls to read into things so save yourself the hassle and don't. You may think it's complicated because you may want more, but if he's not actively pursuing you, then move on. Girls can accuse guys of messing with their heads, but guys don't think that way. When they want something they go after it. The trick is not to equate more with what they are really asking for. For example, if he wants sex, that doesn't mean he wants a relationship...it just means he wants sex.
qzY2tRTeaa	nope
jgiYbglGaa	If you were in love with her... you wouldn't feel nervous talking to her and you would know her like the back of your hand so there wouldn't be any awkwardness.. im assuming she doesn't love you back... so that's called unrequited love... it may be real... but it's not the kind of love your implying
oztoPKrGaa	Its not going to just be about sex unless you let it be just about sex.<br>  Remember that sex is actually supposed to be special.<br>  weird i know ;) lol   so when you are having sex with someone you actually care about, then it should be bringing you closer<br>  Sometimes, instead of just jumping up to go pee afterwards lay there w./ each other totally naked and just hold each other, then maybe talk about something sweet. like.. ask him what he sees himself doing in ten years.<br>  Dont get mad if your not involved in that talk. Not all men tell what they are really thinking, and if he ask you dont say marrying you. that ruins every moment for a man. lol<br>  <br>  But back you your question.<br>  Just be happy. If you like the sex then atleast hes doing his job.<br>  If you just **** and then go home, or he ditches, or calls his friends to come over, or if like he makes it obvious to everyone you two are actually having sex then those are some signs thats what its all about<br>  <br>  but if he actually cares about you , and doesnt see it as * oo im ******* some chick tonight * then thats fine<br>  <br>  remember<br>  <br>  the best way to keep a man is to keep him happy<br>  because then he doesnt have any reason to cheat|`|TEqxfG3Maa	I like that show fraggle rock! It's sweet! Time for the doziers!|`|G3hTM9qeaa	You opened the flood gates :) Sex is a very important part of a relationship. Some guys will even base their feelings for someone on how good the sex is. You'll be able to tell if that is all he wants you around for. If all you do is lock yourselves in a room and have sex every time you see him, that's not much of a relationship. As the girl, you have the power to balance it with all of the other stuff that you guys should be doing together.|`|oonZ7Hf8aa	Try to spend your time together going to the movies, or out to eat, etc. The old saying goes "Why buy the cow when you can have the milk for free"|`|3fV6zRlJaa	When u first start having sex its kinda like that. Sometimes ppl think thats the best time in there relationship, later it fades. But if ur uncomfortable about it and u love him like u say and he should love the same in return, then just tell him that u wanna hang out like old times and not just have sex all the time. He should understand if he's as great as u say he is =)|`|Fyx3gS1Kaa	I first had sex with my bf after only being with him for a month and half and i was feeling the same way you are now. I eventually had to talk to him about it to make sure that what i was thinking wouldn't come true. In these last 2 years that we have been together it is clear that most men have a much higher sex drive than us women. Where as we could wait a week, they want it daily. Its just all about respect and listening to what your partner wants. If your worried about what he thinks, i would just try telling him that your not in the mood one night or not feeling well and see how he takes it. If he flips, he's probably digging the sex more than you. But if he is understanding then you are in the clear. You really just need to communicate with him!<br>  <br>  good luck!!!|`|zIjoaj3Baa	Have you talked to him about this? Tell him your concerns. Hopefully that's not all he wants. At first, when introduced to sex, having it multiple times in a short period of time is not unusual. It's a new experience that is enjoyable. So don't worry, I'm sure that's not all your relationship is about. But now that that step has been taken, it's a part of it.|`|Lyrc2BWmaa	talk to him about it.<br>  <br>  But its usually normal that you want to have sex very often.|`|Kpw1Uaqmaa	then dont do it next time he comes over. maybe every other time he comes over or 1 in 3...my gf is the same way and we only had sex once in 2 months...im gettin very bored and im lookin for other physical attention from girls...jus please him cause he needs it or he'll go lookin for other girls to please his physical needs...but it doesnt HAVE TO be EVERYTIME|`|zg6sgA3faa	Only if you allow it to be.|`|rPoKRm8gaa	Tell him that...tell him that everytime you practically see him you have sex, and a good relationship has to be about good conversation.

If you were dating for at least a month, then I can't answer this question. It just depends on what kind of people you are and your compatibility. If, however, you were only dating for a week or two, then yes - your relationship is probably about sex.<br>  <br>  In one of my psychology classes, we discussed the topic of sexual expectation, and I remember one example that illustrates a man's mindset quite well. A furnished room with decorations and pictures on the wall also consisted of one woman sitting in the room. At first she was conservatively dressed, and a man came into the room for 10 seconds or so. When he left, experimenters asked him what he remembered about the room, and he was able to report a number of items. For the next man, the woman lifted her skirt an inch and, again, the man remember many details. This process was repeated for 50 men, each man seeing a little more of the woman's skin. By the 50th man, the woman was completely naked, and when asked by experimenters what he saw in the room, all he could remember (or noticed) was the naked woman. The pattern in the study was that the more skin the man saw, the less he noticed about the rest of the room.<br>  <br>  In other words, when sex enters the picture (or the relationship) right away, the man doesn't notice much else. If you slept with him right away, he probably doesn't love or even notice all the little things about who you are. You're just a sex toy.<br>  <br>  Please take all this with a grain of salt though. I don't know you or your boyfriend, and there are generally exceptions to any accepted idea or theory. AND I'm not a professional psychologist.|`|H0n33itcaa	just tell him <br>  u know i love you but i think were rushing into things a bit and just go for a break<br>  talk about having kids and ask him is that what he wants<br>  find out what he wants and take it from there<br>  hope i helped|`|DKGiGbxGaa	Try talking to him.

What are you scared of, exactly?  That he'll eventually dump you and leave you?  This kind of thing happens all the time, even among married couples.<br>  <br>  If, on the other hand, you really think the sex is interfering with other activities you might enjoy, and you're missing doing other things, then all you need to do is ask for other kinds of dates.  Some people are happy having sex every day.<br>  <br>  If you feel something is missing or there's something more that you want, you gotta tell him.|`|YbwDFvEaaa	Tell him that while you care about him and certainly enjoy the physical aspect of your relationship, you don't want to have sex every single time you hang out with each other. He's probably just over-excited as this is a new aspect to your relationship, and as it's usually pretty pleasurable, wants to experience it as much as possible. Surely he'll understand that you need to connect on other levels as well, just ask him to tone down the sexual advances a bit.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|b1XStRqtaa	If it is, that is totally sad.  I'd dump him and hold out for someone who doesn't just see you as a  _____________. I find it sad that some people think it's all about sex and say better sex than no sex.  The world does not revolve around sex.  There is much, much more to a good relationship than just that.  Really.|`|60ApQsGOaa	this question reminded me of my relationship in high school, and trust me....get involved with other activities. Because sex is addicting and it can ruin things. Like it'll lose it's intamacy, and if you don't want to give it up to him, he might just be like "f-it i'll find it somewher else." When my b/f and i did that, we did karate together, and kept it good for a little while...until he got with the wrong crowd and cheated on me lol|`|I2wPn0Zlaa	i think maybe he liked it so much he just wants to keep doing it lol.

gWlMmQK8aa	You Can Lose Weight Easily , BUT . you have to eat  more than once a day . your meals give you carbs and fibre and stuff like that so if you just eat one meal a day its not giving you any of these things , you are going to have less energy to work out and you will put alot of weight back on again , but if you were to eat threemeals a day on a strict diet the weight should drop off . :)<br>  Hope this helped .

AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|QGrIn7MXaa	when the guy tries to show every one up in what hes good in to impress u in any way|`|Q6DYlIa9aa	well im in high school but i think its probably around the same things...he would look at you, make you laugh, always be near you, talk to you...asks you out lol. But some guys can be shy...so they might look at you and by the time you look at them they move there head. Here is a trick...next time you are looking a the clock....look at him really quickly after...if he is still looking at the clock...he was watching you :D|`|BI3PKidpaa	I`m in the SAME situation.. except in HIGH SCHOOL!<br>  retarded or wat?<br>  <br>  I think **TexasChick**<br>  deserves best answer!

b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	Do you watch Seinfeld? Anyway, there is this episode of Seinfeld where George stops having sex and becomes super smart and the moment he has sex again, he's dumb [as most guys are] lol. Anyway, sounds like since you don't have sex you spend your time learning which then makes you smart. That's cool i guess. But when you finally meet someone that you do want to share that experience with, you'll understand the importance. You can't read it in a book.|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	Maybe you're asexual?<br>  <br>  Kind of like some people are heterosexual or homosexual or bisexual....maybe you're none of those things|`|2b4OFx5Oaa	Let's see.....<br>  <br>  Mathematical Answer for Importance of Sex: <br>  Z != 0,   Z = sex(I) ,  X(Y) = sex <br>  If either X or Y = 0 || X and Y != 0,  Z = 0 <br>  <br>  Philosophical Answer for Importance of Sex:<br>  Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Sex, without it, neither of them would exist.<br>  <br>  Biological Answer for Importance of Sex:<br>  For proper evolution to continue, a plethora of genetic mutations must occur to the extent that they create genetic eventuallities through reproduction/sex that become presistent over time. These eventuallities will lead us to the next stage of biological evolution.<br>  <br>  BOTTOM LINE: <br>  A) Saying it seems "easily achieveable" is a slight against the opposite gender.<br>  B) Being a true scientist requires you to get in the field.<br>  C) Stop posting BS up here to cover for the fact you are either scared of sex, intimidated by women, uncomfortable with the topic, etc... It's okay to be a virgin, but coming off like you holier than thou and your cheaping attitude of it makes me think you couldn't get it if you tried.|`|vweoheAvaa	I'm with you. Sex isn't the most important thing in a relationship(& as I've said before, contrary to popular belief, guys don't think about it 24/7.) For me, it's whether or not the person is happy in the relationship. If sex has something to do with it, then fine. Otherwise, I don't really get it.|`|faOBk7qtaa	After hearing about your exciting life.....it is no wonder you are a virgin.<br>  <br>  Then you come here and post that you don't care about sex, but really that statement says you are just upset about still being a virgin. Hmm sounds like some discrepencies in your statements...haha|`|kTvn2Nltaa	hahah go have sex and you will see what all the fuss is about|`|VpWyDdGraa	People are controlled by the media and society as a whole . get it here get it now. Highly overrated, Aids all kind of diseases are out here . People want to see your behind and don't care what in your mind, You serve over here and there and in the end move on to to the next conquest. Sex will come in its own time, Build a relationship first ,becomes friends first and make that pack ,marriage deal. You got the right idea. doing something to stimulate your mind, avoid pain sorrow hatred. More people worship their own bodies as it's a must have , how sad. Proud of you keeping it real,Jazzy|`|Kk9f3MdRaa	I'm not so sure people think sex is important as much as they think (and know) it just feels good. It feels incredible to connect with someone on such an emotional and physical level. I know there are SOOOOO many other amazing things out there (like math, music...) but sex is unlike anything else. It's so special and unique. It can't really be described. Just wait until you meet the right person, than you may change your opinion on sex.|`|X2mVl3XQaa	BECAUSE THEY ARE DUMB! also they are in need of pleasure that they cant even suspress their own desire!<br>  I personally dont care but i juss find it out disgusting if a girl have sex like more than 1 or 2 when they are still below 20.<br>  for me i like having sex but in the same time sometimes im questioning myself too! so i havent find the answer yet thoe.|`|0K4ylh5Uaa	Engaging in sex is important because without performing a sexual act with someone of the opposite sex none of us would be here...right?|`|YYAmBsvXaa	oh buddy- once you have sex with a woman then maybe you'll see why people do it so often. I think your scared!|`|iiJK4Ivraa	I think you need to get laid. your all brains not enough cock and balls!!!!
qLeskIKJaa	Everyone makes mistakes and everything will be okay. I think you should try and be friends for a little bit. hang out with him and show him that u can be nice without the mood swings. Then bring up getting back together. You cant really force him to make an decisions because if he doesnt truly like u back then the relationship really isnt going to work out. but if u 2 felt as strongly about each other as u say i think he will take u back. Also maube see a doctor about the sepression thing. They can give you medication and it might help you later on in life and may prevent this heart breaking thing to happen again. Good Luck !!|`|Oejricveaa	You should talk to him and tell him what is in your heart. Tell him how much he means to you.<br>  Words would heal more than presents and would mean a lot more to him.|`|EyaqiWPwaa	well first call him and tell him you want to meet up ...then stop by the deli and make him a huge sandwich and then bring it to him...once he sees what you brought everything will be forgiven|`|AA12244271	Well, give him a few hours, maybe until tomorrow, let him kinda sorta sleep on it. He's not going to be thinking about anything but you sweets. Then call him sometime tomorrow and tell him what you just wrote up there basically. Explain that he never said anything and you were unaware. But now that you are aware there's since for you to stop doing what upset him because you really want it to work out between you. Its hard to break up and try not to talk... =[ Good Luck.|`|qmMCGKl9aa	you have to learn how to control your anger.<br>  understand that by you talking down to him all your doing is pushing him away. & remember that if you don't treat him good, another will and im sure you don't want that.<br>  <br>  all you can do is talk to him. & tell him how you feel.<br>  straight from the heart, you know?|`|38kFV1wTaa	"If you can't handle my worst then you don't deserve my best."<br>  <br>  If he knows your suffering from depression and can't cope with that fact then I don't think you should be trying to win him back?|`|JizwgEiYaa	depression doesnt make u a B***H. Its over|`|BNRGqAlWaa	awww something like this happened to me today but a lil differnt but my advice is walk up to him tomorrow and say sorry dont have a friend do it or not over text or anything you have to do it face to face it will show him that you still care and your not afraid|`|KAGzPjq0aa	why would you want a guy that can't see how special you are? and who doesn't understand what your going through?
PQw92IGHaa	If you really want to see if he likes you, do the same thing he has done to you.  Quit being around anytime he wants and don't walk with him to class.  Make him pursue you darlin'!  Also, who cares if you are chubby, obviously he doesn't and if he does you're too good for him.  <br>  <br>  I think he is into you but afraid to make a commitment.  So you have two choices:<br>  <br>  A) You tell him you really like him and see what happens<br>  B) You play the game.  You don't talk to him as much, don't answer his phone calls, and truly act like you aren't interested. Flirt with other guys.  If he gets jealous, ask him what's wrong.  YOu thought you guys were "just friends'?|`|zx8cVDqIaa	I think he was too shy to make a move, and he was waiting for you to but you never came. He wanted to be more than friends but I guess he finally gave up when things seemed that it would never get any serious and you seemed like you were not interested. Maybe you should try to repair the bond and get closer to him.|`|XEJD4mLWaa	If you like him just tell him! Lads don't tend to open up as well as girls, especially when their friends are talking about them. Just tell him how you feel and if he still likes you then he will open up to you and tell you how he feels. If not then at least you know how he feels and don't have to think about it.|`|47iY7d5Laa	Well,<br>  <br>  He may have gotten distances from you because he realized that he has feelings for you, and was worried that you didn't like him back.<br>  <br>  But now that he found out you liked someone, hope has filled him, and he really wants to know if its him.<br>  <br>  It could also be that one of his other friends likes you, and his friend wants to know if it might be him.|`|ib3SNK40aa	It sounds like you both want to date each other. You can do one of two things:<br>  <br>  1: Just be brave and ask him out.<br>  <br>  and if you don't want to be the girl asking out the guy:<br>  <br>  2: Tell his friend you like him and have his friend tell him to grow some balls and ask you out already.<br>  <br>  You only live once. If you get turned down then big deal. It won't matter in the long run. If you don't take some initiative in your life you may regret it in the future.
MDgVPwU3aa	No, its not too young. I dated a guy 3 years younger than me before. We had alot in common and he was mature for his age...and really cute.
JCdBSULraa	I'm not sure how far I WOULD go, but I can tell you how far I have gone.  The furthest I've gone is to extreme body building.  I was out-of-shape and fairly fat, but then a girl kind of rejected me (not explicitly, she just started seeing someone else, even though she knew I wanted to go out with her).  Anyway, after that I hit the gym every day and lost 40 lbs over the next couple months.  I got into  the best shape of my life, but by this time, she had fallen head over heels for the other guy, so I quit my job so I didn't have to see her anymore.|`|SjD1aKT5aa	I'm not going to lie, if I like a person I subconsciously go crazy, mad, but safe hyper and do lots of weird things but not all the time. I don't know it's like you want them to notice you so bad but you do ridiculous things to get it lol.<br>  <br>  :] Kiki

Have one of your friends subtly find out if he 1) is available an 2) if he likes you.  It sounds as if you kind of want to jump his bones.  Be kind, kisses in the moonlight are better,|`|8WKSgeriaa	Get one of your friends to ask his BF who he likes<br>  If his friend says nobody then go for it and just go up to him and get to know him and spend time with him for about 3 weeks<br>  Then when you know(you will feel it) just say hey do you wanna hang out sometime and something will happen<br>  If he likes another girl get close o him and make him like you|`|VveXou3Iaa	im in same sitition here but im not asking my guy out i am just flirtin with him hoping that he notices me GIRLS DONT ASK GUYS OUT its unfair and stupid but thats how it is....<br>  HELP WITH MINE PLEASE!!!!!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227120110AAga2TQ&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|bPDrN9NTaa	well its the guys job to ask someone out. you really shouldnt be doing it. i would let a friend ask him if he likes you before you get heartbroken.|`|qjy5OirNaa	hey, do you want to go out with me?  just like that|`|fJHxazN5aa	first of all never tell anyone that you are desperate, that is a total turn off to guys. at least for me it is, guys like it when girls act like they dont need a guy. and second of all if he ikes you then he'll ask you out, most guys don't like it when girls ask them out.<br>  good luck<br>  peace|`|zUysiBHCaa	Ask him on a group date first. Both of yew will feel comfortable if a bunch of friends go with yew.

MjK9hkyGaa	Its a lot. I mean, people start having sex (well the norm) at 15/16/17 and so on. Some people wait because they have morals, and some lose it around the age. Theres nothing wrong with it. I'd say percentages are VERY high|`|cHM2US6xaa	I`m 17 and I`ve still got my v-card. (Y)<br>  <br>  I`m a model so I`m not ugly.|`|crw44vnRaa	Um lets try... how many 12yr olds can even say their virgins now a days? not that many. I lost my virginity at 18 to my husband, wouldn't have wanted it any other way.|`|hyjZ6jSBaa	I dont think its as high as people think.<br>  <br>  i hate to ... group it , but it is true , in my group (which i guess would be called the popular group) ... there are more virgins than non-virgins...<br>  <br>  i'd say it was even 75% to 25% in my group. I'm one of the 75% , being a virgin. And we're 16-17.<br>  <br>  Although , if you look at the other groups in my school...those who dont work hard at school , from poorer backgrounds , i'd say none of them were virgins.<br>  <br>  So im not sure overall. i guess it would be 50/50.|`|ouzIFdslaa	im 16.<br>  i wouldnt say im ugly aha.<br>  and im a virgin.<br>  id say its about 50/50 though.<br>  for every virgin i know, there's someone whose not|`|gHS5bU8Saa	Uhh.

KtLJMwDWaa	I fI were you I would be careful. It almost seems like he is trying to eavesdrop on your conversations to get more info about you. You don't know if he wants to get TO you, or with you. For your own safety stay alert when you are around him...|`|ADpPVwdNaa	I think it's flat out creepy! I'd say that you shouldn't look at him. Don't let him think you're interested (unless you are, in which case go right on ahead), and he'll just have to get over it on his own time.|`|JBd3QeMNaa	depends how old he is. if hes not to old, then why not? but if over like 28 stay clear.|`|zid2s6Z5aa	Okay that's just creepy, have you talked to him?<br>  <br>  Maybe you should try to talk to him before you do anything,..

ctj3tFEMaa	thats because most girls have naturally soft skin...like me=]|`|3qjtZphNaa	cuz they are why would their ears
hwwjsbEvaa	Why dont you take a long drive (with her driving) and tell her to park near a park or field. Don't actually go in the mud, because that would NOT be fun (trust me, it's happened to me!) Get her to drive onto the dirt (but not in it!) and then begin fooling around in the car. Then a couple days later, tell her about your fantasy. If you tell her straight up, she might find it a bit odd, but when you get her to see thats it's not that odd (she actually did it a couple days before) it wont seem as odd:)|`|hCV5Hyqfaa	I make my gf dress like my male cousin...oh wait that is my male cousin...dam....I need to re -evaluate thangs fool
JSakTuOHaa	Thanks for answering my question!!<br>  <br>  I'm sorry this is going on. Guys are JERKS!!! Lol<br>  <br>  Ok highschool can be a bummer but don't let these people get to you. Your shy so you need to put yourself out there. I'm guessing your a cheerleader? Maybe you can act liek your peers are your crowed and just get up and do your thing!! Your a sweet girl. Don't let this guy ruin this new experience for you. (I'm a senior) And what i've learned is half of the things  you hear are all rumors, that there not true. most people dont listen there like yeah ok and then just move on. Eventually they'll never rememebr and you'll still have you diginity. Just keep your head up high and keep your friends close. Whatever you do don't retaliate by doing the same thing. Just means your just as low as he is.<br>  <br>  The best revenge is acting like nothing is bothering you, They want a reaction? Dont give it to them.<br>  <br>  I hope i helped.<br>  I'm sorry for whats going on.. Good luck!<br>  If you ever want just e-mail me!|`|Jmmx7muRaa	just try and let it go or start rumors about him cuz he is just hatin on u
4E6rrI09aa	no that's not a problem at all! it is more attractive to girls who are looking for good relationships cause they will know you won't screw them over. Relationships mean something to you which is sweet!|`|0q5Z5zxIaa	just because your friends or other people around you have had girlfriends and gone a long way with them, doesn't mean that you should have too. everyone has a different point at when they're ready for that sort of commitment. so i wouldn't worry, these things do take time. you'll get a girlfriend when you least expect it. until then, be patient! <br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|sEryEzoyaa	ugh yeah i know wat ya mean i m  only 15 but i have nvr had a bf or kissed a boy.. i think u just have to wait for the right girl to come along and u will know :) so yeah i guess these things just take time...|`|wyAbkG3oaa	Hey don't worry about it. Just wait until the right girl comes along. There is no rush and no rules to say by what age you have to have your first girlfriend.|`|fKH7fVHPaa	i dont think theres anything wrong with it you have pleanty of time to meet girls after all your only 17! you got years left, dont worry about and enjoy life! the right girl will soon be coming your way :D|`|3s2wmhhPaa	don't worry about it, just wait, something will come along, if you cant wait then just put yourself out there|`|4X6sgXPMaa	No, that's not bad.. I am the same.. and i consider myslef to be normal.. it'll happen when it happens|`|8O4hh00Yaa	no its not a problem if i was you i wouldn't worry about it. it will come to you when you are ready trust me :)|`|zhk9UMrhaa	I've never had a girlfriend and I'm 18. You, probably, like me, have no networking among girls.<br>  <br>  This makes getting a girlfriend very difficult...unfortunately.<br>  <br>  Remember, men are the initiators. So if you're shy (like me), you have to become more outgoing.<br>  <br>  I recommend going for the underclassmen. You'll probably have more luck.<br>  <br>  Oh, and if you are a video game addict, quit. Seriously.|`|lFYlXPOKaa	Aww thats cute.Don't worry about I'm 17 and just got a boyfriend not that long ago.He was my first kiss and hes my first boyfriend.I think its sweet if you have a guy who has never been with anyone.It makes you feel special knowing your the only who has ever been with them.No worries you'll find someone don't rush into it and you will find the perfect girl.<br>  :]|`|BGAz5I7haa	I'm in the same situation but 20 yrs<br>  Don't worry that thinks of course take time<br>  Experience talking enjoy be single<br>  sometimes is better be alone tha with a stupid persons that don worth it, and when you find that person that changes ypour worl you'll know and don't let her go!!!|`|DcrI9zmkaa	I'm 29 and have had only one serious relationship.  You're normal and definitely shouldn't worry about it. :)|`|6feZyOzWaa	No its not i know people in their twenties in the same boat as you dont worry your still young.|`|cqzZjRVwaa	It's hardly anything to worry about, you're still only 17. I'm sure there are still a few more years left in you just yet.|`|fk8Lz10Aaa	dont woory <br>  some are just late bloomers in getting into a realtionship.<br>  its nothing to worry about me dear :P|`|SBRiv3gcaa	im the same. theres been so many times ive wanted to go up to a girl and ask for her number or to get to know her etc but im so damn shy lol i never have the bottle to do it. and being shy has prevented me from the same things you've mentioned. you've still got plenty of time mate so shouldnt worry about it, thats the way i look at it anyway.|`|tQu9THuTaa	Same situation over here also *lol except change the gender obviously*<br>  <br>  It's nothing big, just enjoy being single ;)|`|GiIFr1rjaa	Ditto what the others said.  Absolutely nothing to worry about.  In fact, normal!|`|PY51kBTjaa	no it's no problem...your time WILL come trust me, i didn't get my first kiss untill i was 16
u9RwzLPnaa	simple.<br>  <br>  Leave him.<br>  <br>  He just doesn't want to commit. You're his first girlfriend, somewhere in the back of his mind he just can't believe he had the jackpot so soon. When you leave him it's going to sink in the back of his mind that he just made a major mistake. When this happens he's going to call you. At that point you have to tell him. No more games or else this isn't going to work. Give him at least a week<br>  <br>  If he really wants to be with you then he's going to chase after you, eventually (just like in the movies lol) if he doesn't then you should move on.<br>  <br>  Sounds to me like you gave him two too many chances. Three strikes and all that.
b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	Where do i sign up? <br>  <br>  We would be face to face i'd grab your shoulders and knee you. Classic.|`|UgcPxd4maa	You're a jac*kas*s!|`|ADpPVwdNaa	To be honest, I think you're nuts. No pun intended. I don't know, maybe just talk to some ladies you know and tell them. They'd probably agree to it if they have a sense of humor.
HtwhcFdfaa	How long has it been since she dated him?<br>  <br>  And if she still likes him... bad idea!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|woL3VYzOaa	ok i think you should give it time. maybe mention to your friend after a while hat u heard this rumor and he may like you.... then i would wait untill she is over it and help her through it like when passing guys "oh hes cute right?" so you know for sure that she is over him.<br>  then after a while when u think shes over it (idk how long it will take, ur her friend so u judge) <br>  then ask her like how would you feel if i liked ____? and then u really have to decide from there<br>  <br>  hope that helps!|`|PqQt6yCsaa	do your questions in that order. tell your friend and then go out with him
IQEf57ANaa	maybe you are not into him anymore. try thinking about anotherg guy, if you feel excited. then is just that you are not into your BF anymore. <br>  <br>  but if you jsut dont feel sexual emotion , then you should see a doctor. <br>  <br>  his comments can have an effect on the way you look at him sexually. that is a possibility.|`|0F8hauikaa	You need more than just sex, you need affection and respect. You should make that clear to him it those things may help you enjoy it more. Most men find it important to please their woman, but if he doesn't then you can't expect much from him anyway.  Sometimes it helps to take a break or do something to spice it up and make it more romantic. Sex can become boring if it's always the same.|`|0wf8Q1Raaa	your probably just getting bored with him.|`|7tNv9T3oaa	It sounds like you two might need to get more creative. Try toys and other objects. The skies the limit on what to try.|`|FH2rD2aUaa	if hes that unsure abot the relationship dump him|`|EgfL2c86aa	are you just not into him anymore? either that or he really just sucks in bed.|`|KNqFM5rEaa	you should do something to reassure him you are not cheating. for the sex part dont fake it make him get you off. sounds like you need to spice things up and try new things. if you just keep faking you wiil grow to resent him and you guys wont last long. TRY NEW THINGS!!!|`|esXp2ENEaa	It totally could be because of what you said about the whole him accusing you and stuff I know it is hard to full enjoy anything when thats happing i think you should tell him that but dont make him feel bad. Or it could be you just over it!|`|Y5a3n1E6aa	Maybe you are not interested in him anymore or sexually attracted to him.  Or you are bored of him?|`|vBcqzMz4aa	maybe you're in need of the jb
HHyny0JSaa	I would assume that when you're in the online dating scene the women know that they are not the only ones you are in contact with, the same as that you are not the only one they are talking to. <br>  <br>  You cant really tell who's out there scamming unless you get that vibe from talking to them or by going out with them. If you do go out with someone it would be okay to tell them that you are seeing/talking to someone else. Better to be honest.<br>  <br>  Sorry to hear of your loss. Good luck in the dating scene|`|c0d2a4df433298b19d643ea89efb7b74aa	Hey sad guy, give yourself some time. Love will come to you. I really don't know much about online dating to be honest with you. Honesty is the best way to go always. You should never try to start a new relationship with out being honest. Why try. Be who you really are online or off line and you will find happiness again. Hang in and if there really are people who are trying to scam on a lonely or broken heart shame on them. Remember you are worthy. Good luck and trust your heart and you will go far.
61fb89834de2b2aea37292f2afc9ca65aa	College isn't ruining your relationship...spending too much time thinking about your relationship and not enough time on remedial spelling is.<br>  <br>  And since you have been dating for what is probably a semester, this could also be a relationship that has already run its course.
AA10743159	Yeah it would me too, lol. It's not the kind of things, most men are into, tasting their own ***.<br>  I'm sure, like everything else, there are men who won't mind, but I'm sure they will be in the minority on that issue.<br>  I don't see it as  "Man Up" as much as Gay Up.|`|XasLRQnXaa	that's disgusting, no, i would never kiss her after she swallowed.
56X3ZpyWaa	obviously she cares for herself more than her friend.<br>  teenage girls do that, and they don't care who they hurt, they expect everything to go back to normal.<br>  don't trust her ever again, keep your distance from her and when he ditches her, don't let her come running back to you.<br>  stay strong! someone with good intentions like you could get a guy over a backstabbing girl like her any day :)|`|PdDbzxvzaa	Just put her out of your list, don't meet with her try not to meet with her too many times.
hsoyMu40aa	First of all why are you shy?<br>  Us girls are not scary! To be honest we are all equally shy!<br>  Just be yourself and don't ever copy what your mates do! If you have a particular girl in mind, each time you see her smile at her and look in her eyes not at her boobs! Then slowly progress it to a "Hello".<br>  It all goes up from there, trust me!<br>  <br>  Have Fun x
9tTeBy6waa	You know. Things are not the same. Distant attitude, and behavoirs, mannerisms. You know!! You can ask him if things are ok between you, or you can assume the worst and break up first. Moving on is easy either way. It will hurt for a bit, then eventually you will meet someone else. It will be ok. <br>  <br>  If he does in fact dump you, the you hug him and say it's been fun. He will be so stunned that you handled it so well, HE won't know what to do.|`|AA12220250	when things are slow and they dont want to see u anymore, or when they dont call u alot anymore, i really dont know, its hard to tell.|`|UP33GlBwaa	I would end it with him, regardless if I felt he was going to break up with me, and that would be if he was being distant and not bothering with me, but only when he wanted something.  I dont believe that two people should be together if a 50/50 relationship is not in place.  When one person starts giving more than the other, then it is for sure, time to end it, no matter who does it.  I dont really think it matters to do it in person.  I have been dumped/rejected many times with no response and not in person.  So, does it really matter.  Everyone seems to want closure, but what good does it do.  I think the best closure is to just walk away and never look back, so you are not saying things that are unnecessary to each other to hurt one another.  Give each other at least that amount of respect and just end it cold turkey.  You know it's over so why prolong it.  If you really cared for the person (at least at one time) then wouldnt you want them to be happy?  I can be totally upset over a breakup, but in the long run I know at one time we had something and therefore want him to be happy.  I might of failed in the relationship, but it doesnt mean that he cant be happy or that maybe I cant find someone to be happy with too.  Let breakups go people and just move on, because somewhere out there, there is someone for everyone.  Unfortunately some of us have to go through alot of relationships before we find our soulmate.  Some people luck out and find their soulmate as a teenager and others have to wait at least half way through their life.  Some of us never find it and will die alone.
xp71kN68aa	there are other boys  <br>  but others of your friend
AzdDLPyyaa	yupp the guy grabbed my a**...jerk LOL|`|2P5ZYuIvaa	No, but I should.<br>  But I have slapped a guy across the face..|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	hell to the yes|`|fDEDg0ZOaa	i should have i've been pissed at a guy but i didn't slap him cause the teacher walked in the class.    i would use that
3cZ9Umzxaa	You know you're over him when you don't have to question it. If you have a child with this person its obvious that at one time there was something good within this relationship. Furthermore, the fact that it wasn't your choice may also play a role in the fact that you're not quite over the situation... As for when or how you can get over him only time will tell... but I hope that helps in the mean time.|`|qmMCGKl9aa	if you find out that he is with another girl and you get mad.<br>  if you get butterflies.<br>  if you often find yourself upset because you are no longer together<br>  if you think about him more then you should.<br>  <br>  you are still somewhat in love with him.<br>  <br>  when you feel absolutley nothing for him.<br>  <br>  that's when your finally over him.|`|5khnqAdKaa	You poor thing, That must really suck. Looks like you're not over him. It is normal to still have feelings for him, especially if you weren't the one that wanted to end things. <br>  <br>  Is there still a possibility for rekindling? <br>  <br>  If not, and he has moved on, just keep going on with your life. He will fade when you least expect it or when you find someone that takes your breath away.
laHLW1yQaa	Hey,<br>  <br>  You got a boy...if you want him.  He is sitting next to you ...dreaming of how to get to know you better...and is afraid you'll bite his head off if he says the wrong thing.<br>  <br>  As far as I can see he is not giving you any mixed signals.  Just shy ones.<br>  <br>  Here are a few easy steps and if you want him and follow them you will be posting about your 'boyfriend' soon.<br>  <br>  1. He likes you...he knows he has to ask you out...but is afraid.  So make him un afraid slowly.  Think of a scared puppy.  Go slow, clam and nicely and he will be eating out of your hand.<br>  <br>  2. Start by saying 'hello' to him each time you see him in class.  You are sitting and he comes in just look up, smile and say "hi".  First time he will probably look shocked and say nothing.  Next time it will be a weak hello.  Third or 4th time and it will be strong.<br>  <br>  3. As class ends talk to him about something in the class...something someone said that was funny...the homework...a joke the teacher made....ANYTHING.  The goal is to get him comfortable with  talking to you.  First time won't get you much but eventually he will talk back.<br>  <br>  4. When he starts talking back for real carry the conversation on to the hall and your next class.<br>  <br>  5. See if you can find him other times at school and talk.<br>  <br>  6. After you two talk then move to touching.  Just touch his arm...his hand...pat his back...anywhere with a friendly touch.  Believe me it will be like a bolt of electricty hit him.<br>  <br>  7.  By now you are talking and touching him...he is talking back.  Then say something like where you are hanging out after school or on the weekend or the evening and just throw out 'it is fun'.  See if she shows up.<br>  <br>  8. If he needs any more encouragement just say 'you are nice..I think I could like you'.<br>  <br>  9. And if he does anything sweet then just feel free to lean over and give him a quick kiss on the cheek, head, or even lips.<br>  <br>  10.  Last step enjoy your new boyfriend.
FLPRFTccaa	just  give me 10 points|`|QWuSZN5Eaa	give a good time... a candle lit dinner and stawberries, whipped cream, and you for dessert.|`|KNqFM5rEaa	it depends on what the bet is over. if it deserves a "good" prize then give him a "good" prize. if it is over something dumb then give him nothing more than a kiss on the mouth, maybe some tongue if hes nice|`|8gYGNnNzaa	a kiss<br>  dinner maybe<br>  ?makeout session?<br>  ?sex?<br>  cookies<br>  cook something for him<br>  go on a super sweet date like to somewhere  he wanted to go<br>  hope this helped|`|dRiH2Uszaa	maybe, give him a coupon, like a free date with you or anything else...
eSDpEwhyaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Best thing to do is to let her go. For what ever reason she is pushing away let her be and if she finds out that she really needs you she will come back. Now if she comes back dont presure her. Just let it all flow. The jealousy will not take you anyware. You need to work on that yourself and if you need help to stop to ask someone you trust or someone at where ever you are. Dont be afraid. and let go.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! :-)
auUeI2Vnaa	Nope.  I've never met my hubby's dad...and neither has he.|`|qy07K2k5aa	No, it has never really occurred to me before. Her parents generally are fine with me.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	You can only inherit the genes of your mother and father (unless your grandfather is also your father or some weird thing), who inherited genes from your grandparents.  So your comment doesn't make a lot of sense.  Granted, nobody is going to look EXACTLY like their parents.  I look more like my dad's sister than I do my mom.<br>  <br>  Physical appearance is rarely a make-or-break deal for me.  When we're 85, we either won't be able to see each other or we'll be so old we won't care.  As long as there is some physical attraction, that's enough for me.  I will look at the parents to see if he looks more like his mom or dad, but that's about it.|`|BPNAcSpVaa	Nooo, there is no way my fiance will look like his mother, they have way different features and builds, and him and his father barely look like each other. I think it has to do with lifestyle choices and genes, but not only from the parents. My nurse once told me that a child can grow to be 7 feet tall even if he has short parents, depending on his ancestors. His parents are ugly and he is hot anyways....lol|`|Lyrc2BWmaa	Yes but its usually not good.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	I should have...but didn't :(|`|l1iMHPK5aa	I would check out his parents' personalities and overall looks to determine if I should date him or not. Cuz one's parents are the most important people (aside from his or her siblings) that affect him or her throughout their lives. Not only physical appearances, if his parents are calm and kind, then, he's most likely got the same characterstic as his parents'. So, yeah... it kinda matters espeically if you want to pursue a long relationship with a person.|`|ib3SNK40aa	I wouldn't consider this in trying to decide whether or not I'd like to date this person because just because they're mother is ugly doesn't mean that they will be. This sounds like a really superficial and pointless thing to do if someone is using this to decide whether or not to date someone.|`|AA11238703	yes i do, yes i would.  'the apple does not fall far from the tree' and it's not all about genes.  parents are an important part of the equation.<br>  as a mom i want to help my kids by positively influencing their potential partners' decisions.|`|6nIXYGu6aa	Hey there!  Actually no I don't really care much what people look like.  Because as long as they are awesome on the inside thats all that counts!  XD cheesy yes, but good.|`|NC5GCk5Yaa	look at a girls mom to get her physical features...and how her dad treats her to see if she is gonna be a psycho bitfch|`|iIWwZrvEaa	lol...not bf/gf but random people.|`|JWNzoksmaa	a little bit, but not overly much|`|LETd2hQwaa	I do it a little to get a general idea but I don't obsess over it or make it law. Not so much with looks but definitely with other things. Watching his family just gives me more information about who he is and how he came to be... why he does the things he does and acts the way he acts. <br>  <br>  Say... I go to his parents house and they're a messy bunch of people with roaches everywhere, kids who curse in front of adults who think that kind of behavior is cute and his family is always getting into all of their children's business.<br>  <br>  Now... lets look at my man, this would explain why he might leave his shoes and clothes all over our place, not pick up after himself and not be bothered by roaches in our place. If we ever have children, I'd definitely be concerned if my children were around people who encouraged them to use bad words. If his family is always in his business, that just means that our little relationship is now a family issue whenever there is a problem. <br>  <br>  I think how you were raised has a lot to do with who you become in life.<br>  <br>  Certain things are deal breakers unless he proves to be different and unaccepting of those behavior.|`|2iigkuUKaa	you hear stuff like this in movies all the time but ive never heard of anyone doing that in real life...b/c (like you said) theirs no way to  know whos genes you have, the girl could have the dads genes and you cant look at him and say thsts what shell look like when shes old..<br>  <br>  haha..thatd be funny|`|Pi0fVzv3aa	no i think thats lame<br>  some people look nothing like thier parents<br>  you cant tell how  a girl wiill turn out by looking at her mother<br>  or how she will act like<br>  because most people aren't like thier parents<br>  and are embarrased by them<br>  so i think you shouldn't look at your bf's parents<br>  because that wont' tell you much.|`|6sJhoXAAaa	Not at all. People change a lot over their lifetimes, and might sometimes look like their mom's family, and other times resemble their dad's family.  How any relative looks does not guarantee how the young person will look when older.|`|GEkLdveFaa	y|`|8ZhtfqISaa	um.... i dont look at that at all... i know who gonna be a good man when i see it....
ZkeoRyy3aa	I think you are being the bigger person by ignoring them.  They are being immature and you shouldn't by into them.|`|ft8t98Pnaa	lets see... ignore her.. dont look at them.... dont let her get to you... he's an ex... move on|`|JK2RvliYaa	Everyone else is right, but I say sleep with him, that will show her.|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	I'm afraid she has major hostility. You must ignor her, however if you see your ex and are on friendly terms with him, tell her that it hurts your feeligns anytime you see him with her that she does this. That's king of embarrassing and immature.|`|zYqHaDcmaa	Ummmm ignore her?|`|N7mgfDxnaa	stick your tounge out at herr.|`|ECnoUtXYaa	It's up to you. you can either ignore her or have a talk with her and tell her that she has problems [in a nice way of course XD] If she's going to keep on doing that then she is really immature.|`|rPoKRm8gaa	Tell them that they don't bug you. Ignore them, and find a new boyfriend to make your exboyufriends jelous! It's evil, but works. He'll leave you alone.|`|A73ForyRaa	I'd go up to her one day and be like what the hell is your problem i never done anything to you why dont you just go **** yourself yea thats what i would do but idk lol|`|7OLg13B8aa	Look away when you see  her and him coming.Shes being immature its not like your with him anymore.|`|JWNzoksmaa	no, kick her @ss or at least approach her and ask her wtf is her problem.|`|JRRsjByCaa	DON'T STARE AT THEM EVERYTIME YOU SEE THEM!<br>  thats one way to avoid confrontation.|`|6lirnoXOaa	dont let her get to you shes being immature.|`|SwoRqEZvaa	the best thing to do is act like you don't see her. if she comes at u punch that ***** in the face
mZw0CLtRaa	What?! You're mother thinks it's fine for you to have sex at 14? That is insane, you are a child. Your body isn't fully developed yet, you can get pregnant, contract a disease if you don't use contraception or if you don't use it correctly for that matter? I think you need to wait until you are ann adult, that is you are at least 17 going onto 18. Don't be so quick to lose your virginity. It's highly unlikely you and this guy are going to be together forever so think it over before you make a mistake.  O yea, please don't listen to anything your mother tell you if that's the type of advice she is offering. Try to consult with a more responsible aunt or other relative you feel close with. I hope you make the right decision.
nuV7tvVDaa	he could be shy or that other guy could like you. just ask them both striaght and find out|`|zx8cVDqIaa	Maybe he's shy, give him a chance.|`|ooRxjLXcaa	lol yeah, just a tad old for that hah.<br>  <br>  I don't know, it sounds like they are just messing with you.<br>  but if they aren't, they sound annoying so i wouldn't go out with them. lol. :]<br>  Hope i helped.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Exactly...you're too old for that. If it happens again tell the guy that you don't know that you've heard what he has to say and that if Chris likes you and wants you to know then he can tell you. If he doesn't, you don't know what his (the guy you don't know) problem is, but that you don't have time for this. Let him know that elementary school was several years back.|`|6QNJyLp9aa	yes it sounds immature. Just ignore them. when his friend says that chris likes you, say, then chris can make his move. and leave it at that. besides, you can be hard to get. ;)|`|48SlX2Yiaa	There are immature people out there. <br>  <br>  Anyhow, it sounds like they were fooling around. If you don't like this guy then you shouldn't really be bothered by it.|`|jGKGlxAuaa	Chris is a bit shy, and he is sweet on you.|`|XHkruFkqaa	Ok so he does like you and yes you are to old for this but remember guys take longer to mature then girls.|`|NvQETTJKaa	if you are attractive- he likes you<br>  if you are not attractive- they are making fun of you|`|8gYGNnNzaa	he likes you just doesnt know how to really show it in public or is too shy to show it in public|`|A73ForyRaa	either the guy you dont know likes you or chris likes you
KOZXzbsQaa	WELCOME to my life. oh my gosh im goin thur the same thing; i really like this boy like we talk on the phone everynigth. but in person i get so shy and i dont know what to say; like i NEVER look at him in the eyes; and sometimes i feel bad; but its hard for me to; i understand where u are cominq from; i dont have a answer beaccause i also wanna know; how i can look at him in the eyes ITS VERY HARD<br>  <br>  <br>  BUT LOOK LUCK!|`|DpStw8RBaa	Just remember that you will never be able to find out if anything could happen between the two of you if you don't try to be yourself. Keep telling yourself that. It may take a while to become the normal, outgoing person that you normally are, but try taking small steps toward it. Maybe the first day you could look at him, the next day look him in the eye, the day after that smile at him, the day after that say 'hi.' <br>  <br>  I know it can be difficult to be yourself when you like someone, but you don't want to prevent yourself from being able to be with the guys you like, right?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|vWXSQDWlaa	BE YOURSELF AND LOOK INTO HIS DANG EYES. NOT HARD.|`|AA10410832	I know how hard that can be, I have a hard time with it too. : )   Just remember to try and look confident, I find that when I feel like I look confident, I feel like it too. He already really likes you and you should feel good about that!  Remember that he already likes who you are and you don't have to worry, get to know him better and you'll feel better too! good luck!!
RoTLnFGZaa	keep busy,hang out with a friend, take a nap, anything to get your mind off of him til he calls!<br>  i'd be stressing too and i'm not "clingy"<br>  but i do get extra sad when i can't talk or be with him :[|`|3bcd439f23f49c4892bdf398b03ae5c9aa	You lurrrve him!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3|`|qd3sumW3aa	If you miss him, go surprise him at his house or something, or meet up with him. Meeting in person is a lot more fun too. You cant exactly watch movies or go to restaurants through texts.<br>  If you want to get your mind off of it, just try to keep yourself busy as much as you can. Once you concentrate on things other than him, you won't think about him as much.<br>  Just try not to be too clingy, guys need their space.
4j6DSEqFaa	1. Don't break up with him<br>  2. Stop doing everything for him or stop going the extra mile<br>  3. Stop calling him or spending extra time or unnecessary time with him (that way he thinks he did something wrong and chases after you).<br>  4. After a while plan a date (plan a date that causes both of you to experience something new or do something you never done like sky diving, hiking, white river water rafting something, interesting new and fun).<br>  <br>  Good luck
0PjLdkh7aa	alert a friend. give her the info just in case something happens to you. but don't call the police unless it happens again. and if it does call the non-emergency line...and in the privacy of your own home.<br>  good luck!|`|AjFA8qIxaa	Well, that is creepy. Smart move to get his plate number.  <br>  You can wait and see if he comes around again, if he does and you're confident enough, confront him. Tell him he needs to stop foolowing you around or you will take actions.<br>  If you dont feel comfortable doing this, yes, go to this officer and tell him about it. He can give you advice, which most likely will be to report it. Or he will keep an eye out for you. It can only help. Most of the time if you confront the guy, he will be scared away. <br>  He might be just someone, who's attracted to you and doesnt know how to approach you. Or he's a stalker. Either way, he's creepy and makes you uncomfortable and nervous. So it needs to stop.<br>  Good luck and dont let it get to you.
x9I80klvaa	Dude - you're screwed.  She found another man.<br>  <br>  Best advice - dump her before she dumps you.  Walk away with your head high.  Don't let her play you for a guy in another state.  It's time to grow a pair . . .
rGci1ehoaa	you of course!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! he flirts u cheat!! hurt him before he hurts you hahahaha|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	Yes, it was totally fair,I think he's learned his lesson so now you can jump off a bridge and burn in hell you baby killing *********|`|900c79d3b0d2f128c2a0a222200c9d73aa	It's not fair.<br>  What you did was waaaay worse than what he did.<br>  All dudes flirt, its like a disease, they can't help it.|`|6kAtYLAdaa	wow.... your... wow. jerry springer much?  grow up!|`|q6kvVkNPaa	omg r u serous you think that sleeping with his brother is equal to flirting with ur best friend!!!!!!  ok first of all that is sooo not right what you did...he just flirted with ur friend soo what but u SLEPT WITH HIS BROTHER that's just wrong.... think about it if u flirted with a guy and then right away he goes and sleeps with ur sister or something how would you feel..those r two totally different thingss.. I totally agree with ur boyfriend.. u basically cheated on ur boyfriend with his brother|`|3eBEYAhqaa	I don't think either of you are right.   I think it was a little extreme for you to sleep with your boyfriends brother.  You should have just taken a break from him, told him how you felt and what you want from him exactly and if he can't do that for you, then it's not worth it.|`|DcrI9zmkaa	Flirting is one thing.  Sex is another.  The two are hardly equivalent.<br>  <br>  My advice? Get out of the relationship and take some time to grow up before you become involved again.  Two wrongs don't make a right; and, with your current thought process, all of your relationships are doomed.|`|3s2wmhhPaa	it's not right, you're crazy, so tbh there's fairness in letting him know how much crazy you actually are. good luck finding a guy who likes that sort of crazy|`|w7sReKuLaa	ok... he's right on this one from what i know.. if you would've flirted with his brother that would've been one thing.. but by sleeping with him you brought it to another level... unless he's sleeping with your best friend.|`|PS83gPGoaa	jus because he flirted with your friend does not mean you sleep with his brother and it is not fair|`|NvQETTJKaa	first of all, flirting does not equal what you did.<br>  so no, it was not fair at all|`|6lirnoXOaa	what!? thats not even close to being equal on any level.|`|fea50eff58413aa453bd7dd0b2473688aa	1. Your right he shouldn't be flirting with your best friend.<br>  2. Cheating on your boyfriend by sleeping with someone else is never right and you should never use that to get even. <br>  3. Especially with his brother. You should have just asked his brother to hang out with out your boyfriend. Or something like that to get even. Or even better his best friend.|`|mO6YN1wJaa	You should never retaliate by hurting them. Just explain to him how you feel and tell him he needs to stop or else.|`|A73ForyRaa	that really aint fair you slept with his brother he only flirted with your friend thats just not right|`|01pY6dW9aa	Wow, seriously?<br>  Read what you just wrote.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	yea,you're wrong.you took it to a whole other level and flirting doesnt equal what you di....you just used that as an excuse to sleep around
2f7c84a9d74e2f539d626705265b06c5aa	I think its cute...you probably did make her nervous...good luck...Im sure if she really likes you, she'll do it again...good luck.
8JgFKfpUaa	Well, he might be embarrassed. Guys get like that!!!<br>  or...he might be flattered and might not know what to say!!!<br>  Just talk to him lightly, until he kinda figures out what is going on!!!<br>  then, when he is comfortable talking to you again, go for it!!!
i6Ix28IPaa	I wouldn't involve your female friend, or it will look as though you're using her and that won't reflect well on you.<br>  <br>  At your ages, the 15-year-old would likely feel very flattered that a 17-year-old is interested in her.  Just be friendly and confident (but not cocky) and the next time you bump into her make brief pleasant, very casual conversation.  When you see her again later, just ask her if she'd like to catch a movie with you.  <br>  <br>  Don't sweat it or your awkwardness will be easily detected.  I hate to use a cliche, but it's true: just be yourself.  If she accepts great, if not, view it as her loss.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|LETd2hQwaa	Go talk to her. What's the worse thing that can happen? And after that, you'll move on. Don't ask your friends to get involved, just ask her directly. You're 17... its time to get over that shyness and man up. How else will you get what you want? She doesn't have to know that you're shy and really shaking in your boots--- just appear confident on the outside and be yourself.|`|Kq1zpgU5aa	Awww, you sound like a really sweet guy. Ask this girl if she has a boyfriend just like out of no where. (Even if you know she doesn't, still do it) Then if she says no be like oh... and then walk away. then the next day walk up to her and be like, Wanna go out with me?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  Get out of your shell!<br>  :)|`|KzmrWzOJaa	Well if your former friend finds out that is why you started talking to her again, she may be offened. <br>  If you like her, then you should find common interests. If she is shy, persistance is key. Just a hello each day, will get you into her mind.|`|y0f4AhAaaa	text her first till u get more comfortable with her and less shy then u know what to do|`|vGZte26Eaa	I would invite your old friend out for dinner or a movie, as friends.  From there you can find out information about the girl you like.  You don't have to make it obvious just say Hey, what have you been doing lately? She is bound to respond with stories about the other girl.  Then ask her to give you a call the next time they go out because it sounds like their having a fun time and you want to join them.|`|B8xcwFWraa	i think that you should talk to her when you are with your old female friend so this way the girl that you like will feel in a more comfortable environment. And you should just talk normal to her and you know just keep it cool and try to get to know her!! <br>  I hope this helps you....!!|`|0zv9NHnaaa	jsut walk up to her randomly, and introduce yourself. I would looooove if a boy did thatt. But DO NOT be a creep about it!! hahah. <br>  <br>  Just talk to her like anyone else. She will like itt. You guys will be good friends before you know it and good friends leads to boyfriend/girlfriendsss(:<br>  <br>  Just be yourselfff. Girls loooove thiss(:
53FA3PSNaa	Over the years I have called my wife a b***h jokingly lots of times. And on a few occasions I have whispered in her ear you are being a Bch to let her know to cool off and calm down. But either way she dose not get mad at me.|`|UURYVZFgaa	i don't really take it serious. now if he got all mad at me and called me that then i will get pissed but if he is joking i don't see anything wrong with that
FH2rD2aUaa	yes but make sure he will end the relationship you really cant trust use when were thinking of having our cake and eating it two|`|fNv0Ye8Qaa	i am always looking at a girl that is with 2 grades higher than me, but ****, she's so damn nice (her body). but doesn't mean that i love her, it's just ....ammm .... natural atraction.  <br>  <br>  <br>  :))))) so much bullshit i can say|`|7d8c1771b3e187721692240addac4a9baa	maybe, but don't talk to him unless you're down to pay the consequences of messing with someone who isn't single.|`|YQEhPRvwaa	if he talks to u then her prob. does but if just looks at u then he prob just likes to look at u.....|`|s8d7gg5Haa	He may do... but then again my and my mates always look at guys we think our hot not that we like them just think they are hot <br>  <br>  but maybe you should add him on facebook and start talking to him.<br>   <br>  <br>  answer mine please <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aps0j_vq.bEv4qTiGbIGUDnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227133219AA6piQ6">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

Ectn7tkSaa	So on which planet are all girls sluts?  I don't agree with you on that.  We should have the right to keep things private if we want to.  And guys shouldn't be too forward as that is a little rude.
mL6ycTAhaa	school, work, library, coffee shop

AA11263103	*Wait for the right moment.*<br>  There’s usually no hurry for a kiss, especially a first kiss with someone, so be patient and wait until the mood is right. Some good times are at a romantic movie after or during an on screen kiss, walking in the moonlight, or during a particularly intimate conversation. Wait until the two of you are alone so that the other person will feel more comfortable and so that nobody will see if your attempt to kiss is rejected. Many girls (and guys) don't want to be asked: they prefer that you be confident enough to take a risk and just go for it. One way to do so is to stop whatever you’re doing and silently look into the person’s eyes for a moment or two. Touch their face, then gently pull him/her toward you for a kiss. If the person pulls away or hesitates at any time, he or she is not ready for a kiss. If this happens, tell them that you want to give them a hug and go for that.<br>  <br>  *Approach for the kiss.*<br>  Approach slowly and smoothly. Depending on your starting position you may need only to turn your head, or you may need to lean in a bit. You may want to use your hands to gently urge your partner’s body or head into position—you just want to guide his or her movement a little, you don’t want to forcibly move any part of his or her body or hold your partner in an uncomfortable position—but in general you just want to position yourself correctly and let your partner meet you. As you near your partner’s lips, maintain eye contact. You may want to close your eyes after your lips meet to heighten the sensuality of the kiss (and to avoid staring at the pores on his or her face).<br>  <br>  *Kiss gently.*<br>  There are many kinds of kisses, from quick pecks to sweet, passionate kisses. There’s a time and place for all of these, but your first kiss with someone should be gentle and romantic. Don’t press your mouth onto your partner’s--just let your lips meet--and don’t try to push your tongue into his or her mouth. When your lips meet, pucker them and give a kiss, then smile and pull away a little, keeping your head close to your partner’s. If your partner moves to kiss you back or seems to like it and doesn’t pull away, go in for another kiss, this one a little firmer and longer. Put your hands on their face or around their shoulders.<br>  <br>  *Make the kiss the reason for the kiss.* <br>  Some people seem to treat kisses as nothing more than a prelude to something else, and will try to quickly move into French kissing. Good kissers concentrate on the kiss, and they kiss, at least seemingly, expecting nothing more. Enjoy the experience, and don’t move too fast. Live in the moment. You will not kiss as well if your mind is somewhere else. For example, when kissing, try to avoid thoughts like "What is he/she thinking about?", "Do I look good tonight?", or anything else. Don't be too self-conscious, or have ANY thoughts outside the kiss if you can help it. Instead, concentrate on the way the other person's lips feel against yours.<br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  and relax and pracaite with your hand or teddy bearr|`|8TmK8Qklaa	kissing techniques can be learned but if you don't have the passion it means nothing.<br>  It's all natural you just feel the moment and do it like that.<br>  <br>  ::edit:: think of it this way. There existed no book for the first man and woman to learn how to kiss so why do you need to be shown now?  kissing is a natural response when the moment presents itself.|`|jmlAmr3gaa	Kiss softly and passionately, on upper lip and lower lip, and both lips, their neck, their nose, around their lips, their eyes, and (obviously most of all) their tongue -- mainly the tip of their tongue.  Use your own tongue, lips, and nose the same way, just playing with different ways to touch and caress a person you love to be with.<br>  <br>  Occasionally, delve a little deeper with your tongue, but mostly focus on the tip of their tongue, just caressing it with yours.  Break off, smile or smirk, smiling with your eyes into theirs too, maybe a little wickedly now and then, mostly tenderly.  Push off them, study them, smile warmly, reach out, caress their skin, trace their lips with a finger, pull them tighter than before, kiss again...<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to play around, catching their tongue between your teeth, or pulling their hair so their face comes up to meet your kiss, or something like that, just to shake things up now and then, just make sure the mood is right and they'll know you're playing and not trying to eat them.<br>  <br>  None of this is set in stone.  Just follow your heart, and enjoy exploring, like a passionate dance.  Enjoy the other person, and be affectionate, showing them how much you like being close to them, how much you like to touch them in every way you can.<br>  <br>  BUT, one big thing is... if you keep that tongue tip thing going for a while, with lots of small quick passionate movements, it can be mindblowing for them, and mindblowing for you when they reciprocate.  So intense that it takes real guts to keep facing the strength of the emotion instead of pulling away.  But if you do, just smile, pull away and explore with hands and all like I described above, then go for it again.<br>  <br>  If you've never done it, or need to practice more, a good way is to hold a grape between your lips and play with it using your tongue.|`|Is3pmbbKaa	Practice biting into an apple.<br>  If you can crack a nut without making a sound in your mouth, then you are a good kisser.<br>  Tie a knot with your tongue in a cherry stem.|`|D7JZPxDzaa	don't open your mouth straight away, coz if you do and wave your tongue out, you look like the predator.|`|WzFfD82saa	Animals help<br>  jk<br>  just practice lol|`|RKLFYS2Naa	There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to learning how to kiss good. Let me say at the start if you enjoy kissing whole heartedly with a lot of passion and feeling most of the hard work is done for you. All that's left is learning a few kissing tips or kissing techniques that will have your love interest thinking you’re the best kisser they’ve ever had.<br>  <br>  Some people find kissing is the easy part. Making your move is the nerve-wracking part. You probably remember watching Happy Days and seeing all the moves those guys used to make to lock lips with girls.<br>  <br>  The fundamentals of learning how to kiss good are experimentation, imagination, kindness, preparation, respect, communication, and very importantly confidence. Build your confidence by thinking that kissing is the natural way that you express how you feel about your love interest. There is no confidence booster like having knowledge. When you truly feel in yourself that you do know how to not only kiss good but sizzle at it, your confidence will carry forward with your kissing.<br>  <br>  It’s also absolutely critical before you even think about kissing anyone that you do not have bad breath, you don’t have a rough beard, you don’t have body odour and that you’re not about to pounce on her like an octopus.<br>  <br>  Here is the classic kissing move. A great place to try this one out is at the movies or whenever the moment is right and you are sitting next to one another.<br>  <br>  Put your arm around her shoulder. Watch her body language and see how she reacts to his.<br>  <br>  If she snuggles into you or rests her shoulder on you just enjoy the moment for a few minutes. Next thing to do is put your fingers under her chin with your free hand that is not around her and gently tilt her head up so she is looking at you.<br>  <br>  In order to learn how to kiss good you need to practice. If you have never kissed anyone before or have had little practice you know you get just one chance. Blow it and they may never think of you romantically again! That’s why it’s absolutely critical that you learn how to kiss good as soon as possible, to avoid any embarrassment and humiliation.<br>  <br>  Anyone can become a great kisser, provided they follow the right kissing techniques, tips and kissing advice from people who are qualified to give it.<br>  <br>  In order to kiss good you need to be aware of how your love interest is feeling about you and your kiss. When your two lips meet keep them slightly parted and press very gently against the other person's lips. Make sure you don't bump noses (but if you do just laugh) by tilting your head slightly to one side.<br>  <br>  Kissing is a lot like dancing. Your lips and tongues move with one another at the same pace in the same style. Just like dancing, you are following one another's lead. You should be aware of how comfortable the girl feels with your kiss.<br>  <br>  Once you have start to kiss one of you will slip your tongue into the other person's mouth. Whatever you do, don't make your tongue disappear back into your mouth like a startled turtle; and don't let your tongue just sit there either. Move it around their tongue, gently suck on their tongue, chase one another's tongues around their mouths. This is what will make the difference between knowing that you kiss good and being a shocking kisser.<br>  <br>  It’s important when you start to learn how to kiss good that you identify all the embarrassing things to avoid! Don’t let your next kiss become an experience that haunts you forever. Make it your goal to follow all the kissing advice you need so that you can avoid the pitfalls and slip-ups that can jeopardize your chances of dating the girl of your dreams and becoming the best kisser she’s ever had. I guarantee if you follow the right kissing advice you will learn not only how to kiss good but how to be a truly memorable kisser that they will remember forever.<br>  <br>  Wait! Don't give up your dream of becoming a better kisser. You can become the best kisser they've ever had and learn how to kiss good. Learn how to kiss good and become the best kisser they've ever had.|`|5HYbJmbcaa	That's a funny question.<br>  The best way is to practice on either a pillow, or someone willing  (a guy friend or boyfriend) remember to kind of hug the person you are kissing and smile after.|`|GsQATI9iaa	i think there no right answer for that every body starts somewhere but try not open your lips to much use your tongue guys love that good luck|`|dR2bqUixaa	Find someone that will practice with you!

54be3c7eda2a6643c24f8ad882a635d7aa	It isnt. the human mouth is disgusting!|`|2tn8EALqaa	HEALTHY? Um, no. Well it releases tension|`|jmlAmr3gaa	To kiss well, you have to get past all your social interaction fears, and just relate to another human being fully, caring for them, and accepting their care for you in return.  That's a pretty therapeutic process.<br>  <br>  It's like someone said once: "there's no better therapist than a puppy licking your face."|`|uLHtXibRaa	Healthy?...urh?..its just something ppl enjoy doing..it does not necassarily mean your showing love or affection..or receiving it..|`|aJGAXYUIaa	to show affection and to(too) say to spmebody basically that you love them|`|zGZe0mt8aa	to show how much you love that person.|`|RKLFYS2Naa	Releases tension<br>  A passionate kiss is a great relaxation technique, says stress consultant Michelle Kay McNabb. "When your mouth is in a kissing position, you are almost smiling and as our emotions and body language are so closely linked, it's almost impossible to smile and feel tense at the same time," she explains. "Also, your breathing becomes deeper and your eyes close when you kiss. That's what you do when you relax. It's a perfect way to shut out the world."<br>  <br>  Aids in weight loss<br>  You need to use 3,000 calories to lose one pound. Claire Potter, fitness consultant for Cosmo magazine, says that "a long kiss makes the metabolism burn up sugar faster than usual. The calories burned depend on the intensity, but you can rely on 10 calories for every 10 minutes." That means that you can lose one pound by kissing for five hours.<br>  <br>  Slows the aging process<br>  "Kissing helps to tone your cheek and jaw muscles, so they're less likely to sag," says Claire Potter.<br>  <br>  Increases fitness<br>  “Your heart is pumping, your pulse is racing... If kissing is exciting, you release adrenaline into the bloodstream and your heart pumps more blood around your body,” says Dr. Susan Hotchkies. "It's a great cardiovascular workout."<br>  <br>  Finds "The One"<br>  Kissing someone releases pheromones, the chemical messengers that signal sexual attraction. "The first kiss is always a good way to work out if there's any chemistry between you," says Paul Brown, sexual and marital therapist. "In humans, it's thought that smells play a vital part in subconscious attraction, and if your pheromones aren't 'in tune', you're unlikely to hit it off."<br>  <br>  Boosts your self-esteem<br>  "In theory, when you're kissing, you're happy. And when you're happy, you feel good about yourself," says psychotherapist Paul Zeal.|`|hF6uZqWRaa	uumm ive never heard is actually healthy. they told me that you can actually give people cavities from kissing. yuck! i wouldn't want this... btw you can get an std from having sex and you can also get a great work out since you sweat and burn fat. hope this helps.|`|ib3SNK40aa	It's healthy for a relationship because it shows affection and plus it's fun :)|`|AA12130864	it released endorphins....<br>  <br>  They combat depression<br>  <br>  It is a good thing to do to relieve stress<br>  <br>  Huggs and kisses,,,,<br>  <br>  Lonnie|`|vWXSQDWlaa	i dont think it is... i mean its not like it ISNT healthy but i think ppl do it cuz.... u know|`|Fi5GJKSKaa	Healthy?<br>  most of the doctors say that its not healthy<br>  but who cares :/<br>  people love doin that|`|JWNzoksmaa	to show affection|`|XChDnnbLaa	i didnt know it was.|`|78FRzIowaa	Umm, I agree. I don't think it's necessarily 'healthy' to kiss. I think that's just an old wives tale.<br>  <br>  People really kiss to show affection, or simply for the enjoyment.|`|B91DUxNraa	Cause it makes you feel better about yourself. That's why. Lolz. :P Idk, just wanted to post something random.|`|8ZhtfqISaa	it feels good and therefore reduces stress, idk where can you find a scientist when you need one?|`|adbbcddc1ab24b792f15fe8d967c6e54aa	where did you get that statement  ?
X6hK915Naa	yea all of that we try to make you laugh meet your eyes talk we show of for yopu in some way and we pick on you just a lil bit if were introduced to u and we dont like you then none of that will happen it will be like hi bye conversation hope that helped|`|GsQATI9iaa	everything you said we look at the girl smile ask her about her what she likes what she doen't like etc|`|277efdce8c0ee4a061432d1c6596e76daa	The bad thing is that guys who make it obvious that they interested in you are the ones you are not interested in. And the ones that are confident and funny and charming but don't make it obvious that they are interested in you are the ones that you'd be attracted to. Its callad a paradox. <br>  <br>  Any guy who knows what he's doing around girls will not indicate his interest to yo unless you show that you're interested in him. So you have to give him signs as well and he will reciprocate. Look for eye contact, smile and just the fact that he's trying to make small talk. Once you respond by giggling or showing other indicators of interest, and he makes the next move by asking you about yourself and sharing about himself, then he understands the game. And you'll want to keep him. <br>  <br>  I can't explain all the dynamics, but its something that, as they say, you'll just know when you see it.
lNlL0Ag2aa	If I was interested then, I at first will constantly check her out when she's looking and if she turns to look at me, I'll just glance into her eyes and then look away. Then, when I feel prepared, I'll approach her and be over-friendly and start striking up conversations.<br>  <br>  I'll start doing that more frequently, whenever I see her, just greet her and strike up conversations and not do anything mean. I don't really make a lot of jokes until I have the oppurtunity, but otherwise, I'll just keep asking a couple questions.<br>  <br>  If I wasn't interested, then I wouldn't be approaching her at all.
lNlL0Ag2aa	If he's over-friendly around you and has a bright personality every time he meets you, then that's a big sign he’s interested in you. <br>  <br>  Also, if he tries to have a good sense of humor and put a lot of jokes that helps a lot. But a major sign is if he's happy and excited around you and he isn't like bored or uninterested or calm. <br>  <br>  As long as he's expressing a lot of emotions and he isn't like ignoring you whenever you appear, then you've definitely keep caught his attention :D.

No it's not cheating.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	My boyfriend and I have a philosophy: it's cheating if you don't want your partner to know what you did!<br>  <br>  You lied to her about it, which means it is cheating, yes.

It seems as if you're all over for money? Just because his Visa had problems, you didn't talk to him for months. Even though I'm not a guy, I'm enraged after hearing this. What is he to you? Your personal bank? Don't tell me your relationship is happiest because he buys you everything with his visa? How selfish can you get...<br>  <br>  You even said it yourself that you made him cry multiple times.<br>  <br>  An ex is an ex for a reason.
Uj5kuzoJaa	I was in the same situation just a few months ago. I have a fiance who I adore and we were all fine and happy until one day my ex (who was my first by the way) contacted me on myspace. He told me that he was still in love with me, and that he can't live with out me. I hadn't talked to him for over two years. When he contacted me I realized that I still had some feelings for him and what we had together. I had a couple weeks where I called and talked to him to see how things were. In the end it came down to me choosing. I made a list of the good qualities and the bad qualities in each guy, and asked myself who I had the most feelings for. I picked my fiance. I cried and cried the night that I made my decision it was heartbreaking to have to tell my ex. But after it was done, I felt loads lighter and I was able to commit myself fully to my fiance. I tried to see if I could still remain friends with my ex, but I decided that I didn't need that kind of temptation or feelings anymore for him. It's best to cut all ties with the one you don't choose, otherwise you might screw up one day. Me and my ex still write each other every couple weeks or so, but I no longer call him or talk to him about my personal life. <br>  All in all in was a really difficult decision and no one can tell you anything that will make the pain easier. You just have to follow your heart and hope for the best. Good luck|`|Rb087BsAaa	You have a fiance.  don't be a tramp.|`|Pp6Mz9Mkaa	which one do you have better sex with ?<br>  your welcome : )
tqhr4V33aa	there is a reason things didn't work out 10 years ago..  move on..  so many more women out there!! should have stuck with that 1st hesitation...so much worse when you get attached to the kid then you really stay for all the wrong reasons.  Good Luck!
77NzfiVkaa	Ok, one thing I can tell you is DO NOT look at her ex to see what she likes. They obviously broke up for a reason so being like him is not going to help. I know that isn't your question, but I was just shocked when I saw that person's answer. I agree with the people who say just remain friends. The awkwardness will pass if you just keep going on like it was before. If you let it come between you then you will stop being friends and there will be no chance at all of ever being with her. Just give it time! :)|`|PJZRGsc3aa	wait|`|IPefoTZVaa	if its not too late, just tell her you were just flirting with her.<br>  <br>  harmless fun.<br>  <br>  depending on where you want to go with that you could wither continue to flirt or try the friend thing (not what i'd do)|`|xgJbxZgfaa	just wait it out  and stay friends for now, bc she's not over her ex yet.|`|PqQt6yCsaa	flirt with her. also if you're friend with her ex then that's perfect. u can see what she likes and surprise her...ya know|`|MFoXcIzbaa	Dude I'm telling you this because it works I used to be just like you:<br>  stop thinking and go for it!
6iDjNKxHaa	Pay attention to the way you thing dont worry or try to invent negative thoughts. The past is the past this person does not deserve to be judged because of others. Your over thinking the worst learn to control self.|`|sGYl7971aa	Are you sure it's just insecurity on your part?  We women tend to keep attracting the same type of men, so perhaps this one has many of the traits of the ones you have left behind.<br>  <br>  I hope I'm wrong for your sake, but I would be as upset and concerned as you are about this meeting.  For your own sake be sure of who he really is before you get in to deep|`|7Q6edIEoaa	I think your insecurity over this situation is completely normal & logical. I would be so furious if my fiance was taking me out to dinner to meet some woman that he has never met! That is ridiculous, he should just leave the situation alone. She seems like she doesn't respect you or the relationship you have with your fiance. If he considers her a friend, what kind of friend would do that? It honestly has nothing to do with her being a woman & you being jealous. She's never been a huge part of his life why let her into his life, or your life together. Don't let him put you down for this because if the tables were turned I bet he would have his own doubts & comments.
DcrI9zmkaa	It may feel like the biggest catastrophe in the world, but your situation really isn't that bad.  <br>  <br>  The key is to be honest.  You're trying to be nice and polite to this boy you don't like and that doesn't work.  You have to firmly tell him that you aren't interested.  Refuse any gifts he tries to give.  You may even have to stop hanging out with him altogether.  Don't worry about fallout with him or his friends...it's called life and they'll all just have to get over it.  You can't date some guy just because a bunch of people want you to...it's really none of their business.<br>  <br>  Stick with the guy you like.  Get rid of the guy you don't.  It's that simple.|`|sfRGKWpCaa	yea.same thing happened to me.its tough.but i went out with the guy that i liked because in the end its my feelings.<br>  <br>  so think abput yursz for once.and dont worry about the others<br>  goo with your inticts.
SsfnitjXaa	Wait for him to call. Sorry to tell you but 18 years is a problem.  Let me warn you, doctors are the most conceited of all professionals.Bet you a buck he just wants to have sex with you.  By the way, no matter how smart you are... doctors never think other professionals are as smart as they are, they even criticize each other.
PxRstppXaa	you will always feel for the ppl in your life you truly loved but as time goes by u will think about it less and less till it is almost like a dream from long ago.  try to move on and keep ur friends near u will get over him.|`|7evN5zIdaa	You shouldn't be asking this question after 4 days! I broke up with my ex of 2 years and didn't feel like dating properly for a year after. It's different for everyone, but I found a year of having fun really helped. Once you've both moved on you'll find it a lot easier.|`|JDmDQJ9Waa	get a new guy that you think you could possibly fall in love with
eNkVSd9aaa	T-shirt and shorts-keep it casual-especially if you're keeping it innocent|`|5d1b54e3efed93f0e4984edefdd98aa7aa	ask him dummy|`|dlHg3r1Vaa	something really sexy. You want to at least get to 3rd base, right? :) good luck|`|jZ7ImGbvaa	A chastity belt perhaps?  If not that,  then don't forget your birth control,  cause you know,  and he knows whats going to happen,  other wise you wouldn't be in the same bed.|`|7xnMr6zVaa	that best thing u can wear is pj|`|ckjZnqHRaa	....your birthday suit...what else darlin?|`|FZjGs3uzaa	Wear your normal pj's unless u wear very skimpy ones.  Wear a tshirt and shorts or something comfy that you guys can cuddle in.|`|9dnnPXcNaa	If you wear something skimpy, you better be ready to get naked and do it.|`|OuwzKFOdaa	Wear some nice booty shorts and a cute tank.|`|7evN5zIdaa	Wear what you normally would?|`|9mTXDKgnaa	super short shorts and a tank top... that's what I would wear|`|y0f4AhAaaa	sleep dress
ft8t98Pnaa	lol..... she isnt your best friend if she's dating your ex.... friends dont do that|`|PJZRGsc3aa	probably, just stay out of her business|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Three things:<br>  <br>  1. None of us knows if it is possible. You'll have to ask him. But why would you want to if he is dating your best friend?<br>  <br>  2. Yes, she would likely hate you.<br>  <br>  3.

I would let them both be forget him and her.
slXwyAFYaa	usually he'll seem nervous around you, and may try to make jokes to make you laugh or to sound funny. he may also want to give you a hug or put his arm around you. if he's extra nice compared to what he's usually like, then that may also be a sing of flirting. you should ask him if he likes you or ask a close friend of yours who knows him to ask him. if you tell him that you like him, if he likes you back he may ask you out.
rPv7PU9Iaa	I think that's really funny. I wouldn't dump him though, because he DOES mean well.

BugeV1Mdaa	Erm... I wouldn't try too hard to pull. It comes off as desperate and no matter how subtle you try to be, they can tell. <br>  Just go to the party with the aim of making friends with guys. Put that into your head, that you just want to get to know them better and hang out with them. <br>  Boys usually misinterpret friendliness for flirting, so if you go for friendly and it comes off as flirty, it's better than going for flirty and coming off as desperate, if you know what I mean.<br>  Plus, I'd say it's better to really know someone before you pull them (especially if it's a bf you're looking for) .... if you pull a complete wanker you will regret it for a long time.|`|BGAz5I7haa	First be yourself and be confident,<br>  nothing it's more atractive for us than cinfident girls but try to make it hard not at first date..<br>  and if that gay don't fell the same seek other guy<br>  there are million in the whole world|`|fox5a3ePaa	You do sound rather desperate
KljiuCH0aa	He has to be sad...he has a crush on you and you love someone else so it's normal...but you didn't break his heart.<br>  He'll get over it after a while...|`|94gC814Eaa	Well if a guy flirted with you one day and the next had a girlfriend would you not be sad. I think that you sent him some mixed signals, and he is sad now because he thought he had a chance. You at the very least broke his confident s, and maybe his heart.
POHWTDPRaa	Talking obviously isn't working. The only thing left to do is ignore him. It's childish, but it will get the message across. Just stick to your guns. Someone is going to break. There's no reason it should be you.
C8DOT8Y7aa	Approach the girl you like. Say "hi" or "hey" and ask her a question or give her a compliment. It can be scary, but it's really pretty simple. If starting conversations is not your strong point, read these articles:<br>  <br>  <br>  Flirt a little! Relax, crack a joke, and break the touch barrier (see How to Touch a Girl). <br>  Gauge her interest. Take notice of eye contact, smiling, laughter, and enthusiasm in her responses. Read her body language.<br>  <br>  <br>  Notice if she touches you more often than what friends do (she's constantly trying to touch your hand or something). If she finds excuses to do so, then you're probably on the right track. But conversely, don't assume that just because she isn't touching you that she doesn't like you. She may be too nervous to touch you yet. <br>  Observe how she looks at you. If she likes you, she will either hold it for a long time or pull away immediately. Either of these could mean that she likes you. If she pulls away quickly, it means she is nervous but she still likes you. If you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you, then this means that she likes you, although she may quickly dart her head in a different direction. <br>  Pop the question. "Hey, why don't you come to the movies with me this weekend?" (It doesn't have to be the movies - it can be anything you're interested in, and that you think she'll enjoy too.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Another good way to ask is "I heard about this movie, _______. What do you think about it?" If she says she'd like to see it, ask if she'd want to see it with you. If she says "As in a date?", don't be afraid to say yes. If she doesn't say that, just make a time, turn up and treat it like a date and she'll get the drift. <br>  Keep your cool if she says no. Respond gracefully, like "No problem! Maybe another time. I'll see you around, OK?" And go about your business - there are other fish in the sea!<br>  <br>  <br>  Another way to go about doing it is to bail before she has a chance to respond. See How to Sweep a Girl off Her Feet. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  TipsAsk her when you two are ALONE. Having others around you will stir pressure on her to say yes or no. <br>  Ask her out directly. Instead of texting, getting other boys to ask her out for you, or beating around the bush, just ask her. Even if you're nervous, this will increase your chances. Most girls will admire your confidence if you are not arrogant about it. <br>  Being relaxed and confident is the difference between a comfortable silence and an unbearable silence. It's natural to have breaks in the conversation. Don't sweat it. <br>  Don't be afraid of rejection! Most girls have big hearts and will not let you down very easily, if at all. Some girls agree to one date just because you asked and they're being nice. Don't take it the wrong way, it simply means she likes you enough to not hurt your feelings but not enough that she's ready for a relationship. <br>  When you do approach the girl, try not to start the conversation by a "Hey, can I talk to you?" or a "Can I ask you something?". Don't ask her out randomly, but these lines are giant hints that you are about to ask her out. This would be awkward. <br>  If she says no, just ask "Oh, OK. Is it fine if we're still friends?"<br>  Source(s):<br>  Be persistent, but not too persistent. If she turns you down gently, then she's politely telling you she's not interested. If she flat out refuses, back away. You don't want any girl to think you're a stalker. <br>  If you have to ask her out through a friend, you will get a "no" by default. Girls do not enjoy hearing, "Hey! I'm asking you out for (Name of guy). He doesn't like you enough to overcome his lack of confidence." They will hear this regardless of how tactful your friend is, unless her friend is a very close friend to both you and herself. <br>  Make sure you don't have bad breath! <br>  The worst thing you can do before asking a girl out is not even having a friendship with her|`|BGPG2FaFaa	just say i really like but i want to spend more time with you so maybe u want to go out|`|zwFT2QTKaa	if you want something serious ask her out ask her to go dancing and ask her if she wants to make it official if you just want to have fun then don't ask her anything it won't be necessary
QEuhPEb7aa	I have 2 ways for you to ask her out.<br>  <br>  You could try being nice and sweet. You'll ask her politely or through a friend, a banner, a grandiose sign or some flowers and sweets.<br>  <br>  When that fails ( it's bound to fail)<br>  <br>  Put a gun at her head and ask her to go out with you.<br>  <br>  By the way, what misdeed did your stuffed animal commit to receive such great punishment?|`|7jqUpkIDaa	hahahaha just say<br>  <br>  YOUR THE ONE THAT I WANT UUU UUU UUUU YOUR THE ONE THAT I WANT!!|`|48SlX2Yiaa	Just plain out confess. Doesn't have to be in a random place, but just tell her straight out. Don't write a love letter or say, "I need to talk to you."|`|KNqFM5rEaa	really??? well, you seem to have practice kissing. all you need to do is go find someone you like and ask them out. start by saying hi, ask if you can take them out some time or if they would like to hang out sometime. start small,don't seem to clingy and let things fall together after the first get together. leave the animal alone and get out there and find some else to spend time with. you will enjoy the company alot better|`|NSx8YmP6aa	Look... I'm desperate too but the truth is that people don't like desperate people so just be yourself and flirt.

Think about, the worst thing that can happen is someone says no...and they might. The important thing is becoming comfortable speaking with people, and the only way to do that...is to do it. So sh@#t or get off the pot. Stop making out with stuffed animals too, you never know where they have been.|`|MIF4HmBQaa	Tell her that you have been admiring her from a distance and that you would like to get to know her better.

qy07K2k5aa	There are no secrets that I don't want to girlfriend to know about. I believe that I should be able to talk to her about absolutely anything and that there should be no secrets whatsoever.

No you aren't being dumb and it wouldn't just bother me a little to be in this situation...it would bother me a lot!!|`|yjhL1Nflaa	I think that they just have a really close relationship and are just really good friends. I'm close with my cousins because they live across the street but not as much as what he is doing. I do think it is a little weird that they call each other sweetie and babe and stuff like that. Some people do have feelings for their cousins but hopefully that is not the case. To be honest with you if he wanted to talk to you he would but for some reason he doesn't but he still makes time for his cousin. My feelings on a relationship are if you want to be in a good relationship you should make time for each other and put everything you are into it. Hopefully he was just joking about messing around with his cousin but maybe not. What I think you should do is talk to him and try to bring it up somehow so that it will not offend him. The best thing to do is talk things out between each other. Good luck.|`|e5M6Sxeyaa	be like man, why the hell do you call your cousin more than me<br>  dont worry about it,<br>  if you are jealous of his family...you are a freak and soooo cannot handle relationships.....seriously im not trying to be rude. :)|`|bxUrI1Tsaa	Are you positive that's a cousin, If it is... 8-(
277efdce8c0ee4a061432d1c6596e76daa	kiss him with your whole body ;-). what i mean is touch his hair, grab his shoulders with your nails, push him back, be playful, smile, really enjoy the kiss. pout at him and make him anticipate it even when youre not kissing, seduce him constantly. kissing is just one piece of the puzzle, and even if you dont score great points with the kiss, doing other things as well to stimulate him will more than make up it.|`|hF6uZqWRaa	It just takes time ... practice makes perfect :) and there's no such thing as perfect kiss or being a better kisser...every one just kisses different... for example... im more about lips. i like to play with my bf lips...bit a lil and use tongue once in a while...but that's just how we kiss. just like ive kiss guys that just want to stick there tongue down my throat lol.|`|CTE2eRgZaa	Try this:<br>  <br>  Pull back and run your tongue around his lips.  My bf loves that.  Suck his tongue and lips.|`|VGwF0A8Aaa	PRACTICE!!!!!!
JoX8D638aa	Just remember that you can't begin a new relationship until you finish a current one, and goes for the guy you like too.<br>  This isn't fair on your boyfriend, and you need to consider if this guy you're in love with is as serious about you.<br>  He has a girlfriend, and if he's not immediately willing to end things with her and be with you, it's just not worth it.<br>  If you let this get out of hand, several people will only end up getting hurt.<br>  Try and focus on the relationship you actually have now, and not dreaming about someone else.

7at1Hyn8aa	When we had to put our dog down two years ago,  I felt that way too.  Even though we have kids and a hamster the house felt empty and kind of lifeless.  I decided it was right for me (not everyone in the family felt the same way) to go to the local shelter and just see what kind of dogs were there at the time.  I went a few times and slowly over the course of the next two months the rest of the family joined me.  We found the perfect dog.<br>  She is not a replacement, and we never wanted to replace the first dog.  We intentionally picked a different breed, as well as a different temperament. Our new dog is great.  She is loving and smart.<br>  <br>  Anyway, if your family is okay with having another dog, and you feel good enough about looking at a new dog then go ahead and visit a shelter.  If you don't quite feel ready yet, then think about volunteering at the shelter to just walk some of the animals.  You don't have to take one home right away.  All those animals will appreciate whatever time you can spend with them.<br>  <br>  You will feel better soon.  By the way.  There is a web-site called rainbow bridge.

I know some men are hard to understand, a lot of them won't admit the mistakes they make, it's a man thing.  But you know, God made woman to be pretty Intelligent and special, we are able to read when our man gets hurt and doesn't want to admit it.  Sometimes they need comfort too.  I know it's not easy sometimes, and I'm not condoning verbal abuse, but try to understand where it's coming from.

If you are feeling depressed and suicidal you should definitely see a doctor or a counselor yourself.  As for why your husband wants to stay with you, I am sure it is because he loves you.

Been married to the same women for 46 yrs and it works for me. Best of luck Roy|`|q1EDNQhBaa	The fact is your not happy! Why should you have to work at it? You have only life and you are wasting it with this man! He is apologising because you have stood up for your self. He will be concerned your gonna leave and to be honest you should. I think you will deserve more than what this man can give. You have took too much and enough is enough! Good luck!|`|5wqjStm3aa	listen i am only a person and i could be mistaken <br>  but he wants to try to change let him or test him for a month or whatever amount of time you want and see if has changed or not <br>  some people will change and others will say they will change but in the end they dont|`|zL5yC2p2aa	Perhaps he's worried that if he leaves you he won't be able to find someone else.<br>  <br>  You should be asking yourself 'Why am I still married to him?' if he treats you like that|`|D1bzXzgQaa	Weed. you can't be mad when your high|`|GPpj6l9baa	Get out of the relationship. The real question is why do want to stay married to your husband?|`|uGN7Lmg0aa	Okay well if there's anything left worth saving in this marriage...<br>  <br>  "if I tell him I don't like it he accuses me of picking a fight"<br>  <br>  No.  Say you're standing up for yourself.  That defends your actions without it coming across as attacking him.<br>  <br>  "I tell him the things he says to me are mean and hurtful, and he accuses me of trying to control how he talks."<br>  <br>  If you want to be in an open and honest marriage sometimes you need to say things that hurt.  "Honey do I look like a fat cow?"  The tactful and respectful (but honest) response is "No but you do look a bit overweight." -- best followed by "but I still love you".  It hurts but needs to be said.  The wrong response, and what it sounds like your husband is doing (though you have given no examples), is saying "yes".<br>  <br>  Tell your husband he needs to learn some tact, it's a very important marriage skill.  When he accuses you of trying to control what he says, you say "as far as being tactful and respectful goes, yes I am trying to control what you say.  Honestly I shouldn't have to -- you should be doing that.  I don't understand why you would talk that way to your loving wife".<br>  <br>  Then whenever he disrespects you, you just repeat the "I don't understand..." part.  If you are lucky it will shame him into doing the right thing.<br>  <br>  Next time you lose it and yell, apologize.  Just a simple apology will do.  Obviously you were provoked and nobody's perfect.  But don't try to blame the yelling itself on him -- two wrongs don't make a right and all that.<br>  <br>  "He says its my own fault if my feelings get hurt because he can't control how I react to what he says."<br>  <br>  He's right he can't control how you react, but he misses the above point that he can control what he says.  If he says something tactless and disrespectful, that is his issue.  At some point you are probably going to start debating what is tactless and disrespectful, but at least then it is acknowledged that he has a problem he needs to work on.<br>  <br>  Lastly, try counseling.  It's less expensive than a divorce.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|IggGQ4GEaa	That is so awful to be disrespected like that. It just has a way of tearing you down as a human being. I really don't know what kind of advice to give to you, whether you should stay or go but I hope everything works out for the best.|`|WvOvoxLxaa	Have you tried counseling? If you haven't then I would suggest  you try it. If your husband doesn't want to go, then go for yourself and work through the problems. If after the counseling things don't work out then you will know that you have tried and can walk away with your head up.   If your husband apologized then he knows that some of it is him, and he has pushed you to the limit.|`|OgkGsCkvaa	You always have to ask yourself what you can do to make things better as well.  Most of what you wrote is how bad he is.  Not to sound harsh, but if everything was great from you he wouldnt do such things....(unless he is a complete dick with no hope, there are those too).  Look into some Dr. Laura books or even see a counselor and see what a third party might be able to uncover.|`|dcd11iUwaa	you know what, id be an absolute ********* to him til he knows what it feels like!<br>  if he says anything about it just say: "have a taste of your own medicine"<br>  if he still hangs around after that then dump him<br>  life's too short to be with an aggressive loser.|`|wVt3F5gnaa	I really dont know, theres no point in staying in something thats doomed.|`|1rmSuG2Haa	Honey you'll never be happy until you two divorce, by the sound of it..<br>  <br>  So if you don't want to work on it, if you feel its not going to change, leave now or regret it later..<br>  <br>  And the sooner you do it, the easier it'll be for both of you.<br>  <br>  Perhaps try a separation for a few months if you aren't sure yet?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	Same my situation with my husband. I am still can't find the real question. sighs. Our husband is IDIOT!|`|bRLWDEgraa	The question really should be (judging by what you just wrote) why do you want to stay married to him?  You have a couple options,  open discussion with your spouse,  counseling, or divorce... you pick because those are the only three options I see that could possibly make you happy.|`|IGXE3aDraa	you need to leave him and find a man who will treat you with respect, love, compassion etc. a man that will call you names and say everything is your fault is not a man. good luck|`|XJlD2kPsaa	he either loves you and cant control it or he wants you for sex.

JtEBaOdjaa	They pay for their own accomodations.  What you usually do, as the bride and groom, is call hotels near the reception.  Ask them if they offer discounts for group bookings.  Then you reserve a block of rooms, put the information in with the invites and people can call in, book (and pay) for their own accommodations (at the discounted rate).  If they want a nicer hotel they can still go find one, but this gives them a nice, discounted option.<br>  <br>  NOW, if there is someone like your mom and dad (or sister, or brother or SOMEONE important to you) who can't afford it, I would put up the money for them (personally) but ask they keep it quite so everyone doesn't start calling and asking me to foot their bill too.|`|bf6K6uubaa	Coming to your wedding is an OPTION so that means if they choose to go they need to pa for the hotel...if you don't have room in your house or anyone else's houses in the area then yeay they need to get a room.  the only way i would have paid for someone is if i really wanted them to come and i knew they wouldn't unless i paid their room...but thats usually never the case|`|63439e5b52d40d8694adad7cd7a9c505aa	Guests should not except you to pay for their travel/lodging.  Most of us would be in debt if we paid for everyone.  I have heard though that if you call a hotel and tell them you are having a large event they will often give discounts to your guests.  Just a thought if your worried about helping out.|`|sLLgERQWaa	Out of town guests pay for their own travel expenses and accommodations, if it's not feasible for their finances, then they sent their regrets and do not attend.....up to the couple at that point if they want to pay for those particular guests.|`|hq4etmjoaa	Unless you are financially well off, your guests are the ones who should be paying for the hotel. they have the option of coming to the wedding or not and if they really want to be there, they will have no problem spending the money to stay in a hotel. You already have your wedding costs and that's enough right there. Usually the guests pay for their hotel, you aren't expected to pay for that and the guests should know this.|`|vyL7yEleaa	you need to do what your budget allows, mine personally doesn't give me the play room to host their hotel rooms. <br>  <br>  for the out of town guest just let them know that you can not afford to pay for their hotel stay and give them a list of inexpensive motels or hotels around the area of the wedding. most guest will understand that a bride and groom don't have the extra money to put them up for the night as well as pay air fare and food.<br>  <br>  i'm telling my guest that we have several nice motels around the area or if they don't have the money they can camp out in our living room XD|`|AleWgjvPaa	If it's going to put you into debt then let others pay for the hotel but recommend a place for them, maybe call a few places and see if they'll give a discount for a block booking.<br>  <br>  We paid for close family to stay over and my friends weren't upset and they actually booked rooms too. The whole wedding went on for a long time and even carried on at breakfast which made it awesome.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ownoc1ZJaa	If people are coming in from out of town, it is their responsibility to pay for their own lodging.  But it is very kind of you to pay - however, definitely not necessary.|`|HcboXOmjaa	I would not. They should already know that a wedding itself is very expensive so the family should definitely pay for the hotel.|`|KOYZfaDkaa	I want to have a destination wedding in Tahoe, which is going to be about an 8 hour drive from where we all pretty much live (plus there'll be a few out of staters coming). So what I plan on doing is letting my guests pay for their accomidations, but I'm going to do the leg work and let them know where the best hotels for their money are going to be. I'm also going to see about contacting the hotel myself and asking for group rates since I'll be bring in a lot of business to them. Then my guests can call the hotel I suggest and tell them they're in for my wedding and that will secure their discount. It all makes sense in my head, I hope it works out that way though! <br>  <br>  The bottom line is that you don't have to pay for them, just look into helping them get the best hotel for their money.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	oh god, if my fiance and i had to pay for hotels, we would be so far in debt...my family is huge and they are ALL from out of state.<br>  <br>    at any wedding in my family, guests pay for their own rooms.  if the bride and groom can block off rooms at a hotel, they try to do so cause that usually gets discounts for the guests.<br>  <br>   like, unless your REALLY rich, dont worry about paying for hotel rooms for guests.  these days hotel rooms add up real quick|`|AW1dCzH0aa	EVERYONE will have to travel to get to our wedding.  Not one single person lives near the place we're having our ceremony.  It's about 100 adults and 20 kids.  We're not paying for anyone's hotel rooms.  We're paying for the entire wedding ourselves and can't afford to pay for rooms.  Of course, all the people invited to our wedding understand that we would not be offended at all if they cannot afford to come.  But, we definitely cannot afford to pay for them all.  I don't think people typically foot the bill for people's hotel rooms.

You totally just described the problem I had. My cousin would talk to her boyfriend on the phone for about two hours when we were hanging out. Hearing her talking to him all lovey dovey was NOT why I came over. So I took her phone before she had the chance to call him and I turned it off. I just told her we should just have a girls day and do crazy stuff together like we used to. So now when we hang out, we have a no-boyfriend policy.|`|c42736cb7fec6cc73ab0f4153c26567eaa	be honest with her.  tell her you're hurt that she's ignoring you and only talking to you when she needs something.  just tell her what you're feeling.|`|pYfhbdLZaa	be like this im glad u have a bf but we barley hang out a stuff and i would love 2 spend some time with u|`|WZyUpDgnaa	you should just be upfront with her|`|3x70A8rpaa	Stand up for yourselves. When I was younger I was always ignored by the people around me. And it hurts, so I know how you feel. Really. Don't lose ground, is she using you? Be careful of that! Don't let her grab you away than push you out of the cold again. Say, " You know what, you been hanging out with boyfriend alot lately! Haven't you ever think of hanging out with cousin too! It hurts that im being ignored." <br>  And there you go. The next time you're being ignored, you can say that to her. Even though that she might get mad abit, she might know how your feeling. I hope this helps <br>  Love, <br>   Mina

It's an issue she has inside and please don't internalize it and make it yours too.|`|DZsusLePaa	You love her, but I hope your mother learns (some how) to be of help to you on an emotional level regarding your body image.  You're at an ideal weight for your height.  Don't look at the scale, look at the way you fit in your clothes.  If you don't like what you see, don't starve yourself.  You will lose muscle tone, slow down your metabolism and gain weight.  Eat when you're hungry.  Eat healthy. Find some kind of exercise you like and don't eat at night close to bed time.  Some mothers thrive on putting their daughters down.  Sick way to make themselves feel good.  I hope yours is not like that.|`|K2dv9u7baa	Your mom shouldnt be putting you down like that! <br>  Try talking to her about how you feel when she says stuff like that <br>  and btw, you dont need to lose weight because you're really tall<br>  so your weight now should be the idea weight for someone your height<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|fwIe1sQwaa	Don't let her get to you.

b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	Even if you do break it yourself that doesn't mean it won't hurt the first time you have sex with your boyfriend. It can still hurt for a couple more times. Just let him break it. You won't know when it's broken cause it's gonna be a bit painful anyway.|`|DEacde81aa	Shove a tampon through it or something?
Sj9Z8jJKaa	No not humorous at all, it's very understandable..<br>  <br>  I can understand why this frustrates you, crying may not "solve problems" but it sure does help you feel better sometimes, especially when you just feel like releasing tension inside you.. that's why people say "have a good cry" sometimes you just need to! Jeez I wouldn't know how I could cope if I couldn't sometimes just cry and let it all out.. <br>  <br>  You need to talk to your husband seriously, and let him know that crying doesn't mean that its making anything worse, tell him crying just sometimes makes you feel better, just like X thing helps him feel better when he's down.. tell him that he might not understand it, but support you anyway, regardless if it seems worse.. help him to understand what you feel.. <br>  <br>  these kinds of conversations usually have the most impact when both of you are being serious and honest and open and paying attention to each other, so make some time do this.. really, "open communication" is one of the best things a couple can have.. <br>  <br>  <br>  hope things get better for you, don't give up! try talking to him!|`|NB4h4jTyaa	This is a really unhealthy response from him. Of course you are allowed to cry. He doesn't like it because it makes him feel bad, but there are other ways to express it. The fact that he won't leave you alone about it afterward is also worrying. <br>  <br>  To me, this is not a minor issue. I don't doubt your love for each other, but I do think you could benefit from some marital counseling. Best wishes to you.|`|0Yqjaj15aa	to me it seems that he just doesnt like seeing you cry and he doesnt know what to do with himself when you cry. some guys are like that and they just want the girl to stop because they cant bear it especailly if theit not very emotional.Other wise you should tell him flat out it hurts you and you dont like it.i hope i helped.<br>  =(good luck!|`|UUrqECXIaa	I don't think it's humorous. My husband doesn't like it when I cry either but he never bugs me about it. I think he tries to ignore it. If your husband can't be supportive of you in your time of sorrow, at the very least, he should give you some privacy.|`|651K5lnYaa	My husband is the same way. He never comforts me when I cry. In fact, he is usually putting me down when I cry which really only makes it worse. My husband is just very mean.|`|6myI8y1Faa	He won't let u cry! Damn...I would NEVER let my boyfriend treat me like that. When I cry he tries to comfort me.|`|a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	I understand where you are coming from exactly. I am a very sweet, geniune, caring positive, upbeat person. HOWEVER, I guess when I am personally mad, it makes people crappy.  They can't stand me when I'm not my upbeat chipper self. It is an unfair thing because we are human. You rush to comfort others, don't you? You just want a hug. Kinda like a "Big Girls Don't/Can't/Better Not Dam#it" sort of thing. Hugs to you from the great beyond.|`|pMtMsbBnaa	Maybe he's that way because men see crying differently than women.  They maybe see it as being weak.  Maybe you can tell him (and bring it up during a neutral time when you're not actually crying and both of you are in a decent mood) that it really hurts you when he gives you crap about crying.  Explain that you are different from him and you cope with things differently, and that doesn't make you any less of a person.  It's just how you naturally react, and you should be able to be yourself around him.  Ask him to just understand that's the way you are and to set aside his opinions/judgements and just be respectful of you and leave you alone when you cry.|`|AA11103096	mine is like that. i think its because he hates seeing me so upset and cant do anything to fix it. i just go off by myself and do it alone. then i get what i need and he doesnt have to get upset about it.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	I always hate it when my wife starts to cry because it seems so unfair. I can't stand to see her cry and so as soon as she starts I give in to whatever she wants just to make her feel better. I just can't take it.<br>  <br>  Maybe in some guys it has the same effect except instead of making it stop by giving in and comforting they try to make it stop with hostility and anger. If that's how they're used to dealing with things. In any case, I think it stems from some innate thing in us that we can't stand to see a woman or child cry. It's like some kind of torture to us.|`|IvMPh09baa	sometimes he gets upset when i cry, sometimes he gets very endearing to me when i cry.  he's being insensitive if he continues to yell while you cry.  maybe he's got alot of guilt on his shoulders, and the more he yells the more he doesn't have to confront his own guilt.  try to talk to him when your calm down.|`|2dd5ead8a0ebfd17db4114329eae540caa	Well he does not understand that women are sensitive. Well don't trip cry if you want to it makes you are pretty.|`|9bdEPcWIaa	That's easy. Cry when your husband is not around.|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	He is enjoying to watch or hear your crying. he don't care ever.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Some men cannot deal with this. They don't know what to do and they get mad out of frustration. I don't really know how to tell you to fix it. Have you discussed it with him when you two are no longer mad at each other and told him how you felt? Telling him during the time you are upset and he is mad is not going to work. Have a discussion about it and not an argument. You should be able to tell him how you feel and what you need and he should be able to listen with an open mind and together you should come up with a solution. If he cannot deal he can walk away without being cruel and making it worse.
AA11984835	Yes and No,<br>  <br>  No you are right in feeling angry in the response your sister has shown toward you and the rest of your family. I think you are very much justified. <br>  <br>  Yes in the notion that... In the end what is your goal?

If you prefer to be "right" then keep doing what you are doing.|`|pC5SWxC3aa	There is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't feel the way that you do. However people like her just cant be changed.

I have a cousin who drives me nuts, she does stupid stuff all the time and I jsut don't understand her, but I am always there for her because I know she's really going through a lot.  It sounds like your sister is in a really bad life right now, and she needs to know people care.  However, it's her life and only she can make up her mind if she wants to change, and it sounds like drugs are running and ruining her life.  Nobody can tell you yes or no to this question because we don't know you too.  Good luck,|`|AA11903783	Your sister needs help. She has been into a lot of mess and the only person aside from her husband who could help her is her nearest of kin and that includes you. People get into trouble because of circumstances of their choice and not their choice. I really don't blame you for your feelings about your sister but you must understand that a family is a family. You have no right to condemn her as she is. Try to help her out of her predicament and get the rest of your family to do this. This may be your most charitable project that you can do in this lifetime.|`|B91DUxNraa	You should think about how your sister is feeling right now. She has been through a lot with this guy, even though he wasn't good. Instead of ignoring her, you should go stay with her and support her, she is your sister after all. Try to remember the times where you actaully enjoyed her presence and try to change her back to how she was. I promise you that your sister will be grateful.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	i honestly thing u are being to hard on her when its not even your problem as far as u dealing with it personally... its her life and she made a mistake and she is learning the hard way..  she is only human like u and i.. and yet we are no one to  criticize or say anything when it comes to someone personal life.. i think u should start reading and learning what family is really for.. and that is dont criticize your own .. u stay together through thick and thin and give a helping hand.. today she is in that position ..but tomorrow u dont know what  life awaits you.. good luck i have spoken my mind because that is the right thing to say.. i dont think its what u wanted to hear tho..|`|uz48aq64aa	wtf is wrong with u and your family|`|ZY3RjiRAaa	oh god... no ur not. what a mess! forget about her. i feel so sorry for her son!<br>  <br>  F UR SISTER! <br>  <br>  <br>  ~sorry, but thats my opinion.|`|Zg4zNGI8aa	i think you might be harsh but think about it and say am i doing the right thing by not talking to her.|`|4e1nRQCUaa	So, if I read correctly, your sister is hot and available?|`|XJlD2kPsaa	nope, she's getting what she deserves, she's a failure at life for the most part. I agree with what your doing and i think i would do the same|`|6iCOMx8laa	No you aren't being too harsh. You are just refusing be drawn into the dramas. Good for you. Continue to be strong and stick to your resolve. Let your parents deal with her crap. You don't have to play. You live in another state. Good for you!|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	I don't believe you're being too harsh on your sister. She needs to grow up. Why on earth did she give up her child to her ex husbands relatives? She is an unfit mother to leave her child with strangers. I only hope they will treat and care for him better than she ever could.|`|Q0CfRoZ5aa	she is a jerk and everything she does you should do the opposite. no you are not being to harsh at all.|`|juczLKDEaa	No your not being to bad.<br>  <br>  Just a little judgemental.<br>  <br>  Maybe she gave her son up cause she couldn't give him what he needs. She's seems really bitter. Most likely cause her life seems to suck. You should try and figure out whats going on in her life or maybe just try to understand her side.|`|pC1H7kO4aa	Nope.|`|XWHWbVxEaa	No your sis is whack. :)|`|B4nujMnlaa	Oh my goodness! You are not being to harsh on you sister at all. And giving her the Silent Treatment (Not talking to her, not acknowledging her presence, ect.) is just the thing you should do! I'm quiet amazed at your sister there, wow. I'm so sorry but that is just totally bizarre. And once again, I don't think you are going to hard on her at all!!<br>  Hope my suggestion helped! :)|`|ChUplrj2aa	nope. Who would leave their kid with basically strangers??<br>  she obviously didn't care enough for her family to even let them know that she was going to get married. Leaving her baby with strangers is horrible. I mean, thats your nephew and your parents grand child. How do they feel? aren't they mad at her? i don't think your being harsh at all. One day shes going to regret all of the bad stuff she has done, and hopefully it wont be too late to get her child back and save the relationship with her relatives.|`|NGYcQnboaa	wow no...i mean she is family, and you need to be there for her, but not in the sense that she can walk all over you and take advantage of you. but basically i understand that you dont want communication with her. you would if she used to be a friend...she is just family this time so it is harder to get away from. just focus on being a good person and learning from your sister mistakes (seems like you have and are though) sorry for the situation<br>  hope i helped!<br>  best answer please! thanks|`|RwiodlHeaa	I do not think you were too harsh. Maybe in the long run, like a while from now you should forgive her befor something may happen to her, and you may regret not forhiving her, but for the moment, i would do the exact same thing. She sounds like a loser and not a very good person (no offense, don't want to be rude)|`|ZuQzhhXmaa	No not at all! A LOT of my immediate family are scumbags! I plan on leaving when I'm finished college and never look back! Sometimes even if they are your family people will just repetitively use you and take advantage of that fact. It's the family that supports scumbag people who happen to be family that are at fault. I have an Aunt who is grotesquely obese is the dirtiest most disgusting person alive who literally lives in filth so much so that she was evicted from every apartment she has ever managed to rent. So everyone takes her in when she gets evicted and she acts like shes entitled to it and treats everyone horribly the entire time. Some people just need to not be helped and their fate is their own.|`|dxMQAdndaa	It's a tough situation to be in because she IS family. However, given the circumstances, it seems that she has basically no respect for you or your parents and you shouldn't try to help her. It never fails to amaze me how someone can just continue to mess up their life over and over again. I would say that if in the future she tries to make amends, you should try to forgive her, as people can change and she is your sister. Until then, you should not try to help her until she helps herself first.
VH98AKVgaa	It sounds like he's a dog...... walking around you.... but whatever if neither of you talk to eachother then your never getting anywhere..... i kno you dont want to but just talk to him........maybe bring a friend with you when you talk to him!!!|`|5QGx3FE1aa	You can find some GREAT tips and tricks here!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://RelationshipHelpTips.info" rel="nofollow">http://RelationshipHelpTips.info</a>
4p6NC3Weaa	You may think it will be awkward but it might not be in the end. You may have a great time. Try being open to going on group dates. Don't rush your bf into going on serious date just the two of you because he my not be comfortable doing that. Just take things slow and have fun. you may end up meeting a lot of cool people going on group dates.|`|u2SjiWXCaa	It sounds like hes not fully comfortable with you yet, which is why he wants backup being his friends. his freinds are like a safety net the make him feel in his zone. & you'll be fine just act like the sweet girlfriend and they'll of you : ]|`|aoEgzlvkaa	Talk to him straight<br>  say you awkward going out with that set of people<br>  and you prefer the "me and you" time<br>  hows he ever going to know what you like and dont like?<br>  Just tell him straight.<br>  im sure he'll get the picture if you ask him nicely <br>  <br>  peace <br>  ox|`|1P0g68YCaa	You deffinitley need to tell him you want to go on more "alone" dates with him.  After all, he IS your boyfriends and you ARE his girlfriend, so i find it odd that he wouldnt want to be alone with you.<br>  Unless he's like 14 or 15, then i guess that would be understandable.  Guys that age are very immature and dont understand why girls feel differently than they do about things like this.<br>  Think back to the one time y'all actually DID go out on a date by yourselves.  Apparently you had a good time. But did he? maybe he felt uncomfortable but you didnt notice.<br>  If i were you i would ask him about it, and TRY not to let him avoid the conversation. Since you are in a relationship with him, you have the right to know. <br>  If he just doesnt want to be alone with you, maybe he isnt the right guy? or maybe he just needs more time to get used to the whole "dating" thing.<br>  Guys can be very interesting hahah<br>  <br>  GoodLuck<br>  <333|`|2dd5ead8a0ebfd17db4114329eae540caa	well be nice and enjoy him|`|IVPZkJnvaa	Ask him to go to dinner.<br>  If you're the one making the plans, things can be the way you want them.<br>  Please answer:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtZ3FHq5kFV6G2N9cDaTYGvsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226153302AAZlgfl&show=7#profile-info-IVPZkJnvaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|89owZt6Haa	very common in young "daters".  sometimes go with his group  and sometimes go with some of your friends. try expanding the group with some from each.  the group dynamic is probably the best for all at your age.|`|AA12225109	It's a comfort zone for him to be with all of them and you..........|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	tell u went to spend more time with just him|`|lwFgDJlHaa	On this upcoming date, try to do yourself up.<br>  make yourself look hot, your boyfriend will be very proud to have you there and It will also boost YOUR confidence when you look and feel your best.<br>  Also try to engage yourself in conversation with them, just jump in.<br>  they exspect that of you and it will open up new friendships with your boyfriends friends.<br>  <br>  If you want time with him alone why dont YOU try to plan a date.Ask him if he wants to go to a movie or come over to your house. It will let him know that you want to be alone with him, and it will also let him know, you are trying to make the relationship work.<br>  <br>  Carmen C.
dHID1XDoaa	Well whats going on is that you really don't feel like somebody is going to be there when you fall so that why you have continuous boyfriends and aren't on home because you dad wasn't around and your real mom isn't around. It's normal wanting to not be alone. I wish I wasn't alone right now but it's weird. But anyways. I hope I helped and sorry if I didn't get everything.
AA11124885	If he is offered a job and doesn't take in these times, let me know, jobs are hard to find these days!  she will just have to realize it herself.|`|uyXfPDzDaa	You need to confront your mother with the facts<br>  show her what is happening with your brother<br>  she shouldnt kick him out but rather find him help<br>  find him a job,therapy and rehab for the drinking problem<br>  instead of kicking him out which would cause more problems for him, you and her could help him<br>  you just need to help her realize what is going on<br>  open her eyes to reality
VjMyHAWraa	You did the best thing you could do! Thank God you had the sense and courage to leave!! Good job!!! Of course you will get over this. You should talk about it with someone though. It will help you work through your concerns about the situation. If you are in fear of him abusing you because you left him, you need to get help immediately! Don't wait!  My dear child, you are only 16 and have the rest of your life ahead of you! You will get your life back, soon! God bless and good luck! BTW I love it when I hear of a 16 year old with a good head on her shoulders!|`|WvOvoxLxaa	Yes you will, but now you have to remember what this guy acted like and remember the signs so you don't get hooked up with someone like that again.  Your right you are only 16 and if still young.  You have a long time before you will be out of school and I hope you go to college then you can decide what you want to do with your life. If the right one comes along you will know it, but have some fun with out being tied down to just one guy.|`|OHfZFR31aa	It will take time to get over this and time to trust another guy- how much time varies from person to person. But at least you went through this when you were young and have your whole life ahead of you. Many girls haven't even had a boyfriend at age 16<br>  <br>  And when you do grow up, you'll look back at how much you learned from this and be able to recognize the signs so you get out of a potentially abusive relationship a lot sooner|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	u have to deal with the grief involved when u loose someone u love, emotions aren't the bad guy, and there is no magic waving of a wand to stop the pain. these feelings are normal, think of them as a teacher ,trying to get over the feelings are wrong because they are part of the human experience. they teach us things we need to learn. yes this will pass. when i was your age, i too wondered when i found myself broken up with the love of my life, if i would ever love again. its not the pain but what u choose to do about it, if u learn from it, it can be a good thing. life as u knew it won't be there, because with each experience u grow.|`|So00Bd5zaa	If you know the reasons why you were in an abusive relationship then the next one won't be a repeat. Examine the reasons why the relationship was abusive.|`|2dd5ead8a0ebfd17db4114329eae540caa	Yes every man is not alike.|`|3iNobwVraa	You are young.  Get counseling now so you can heal, and will know what to look for in the future.  Read a book called The Gift of Fear.  It's amazing.  <br>  <br>  You may trust again, but possibly never in the same way, or as readily.  Just speak up about this.  Don't bottle it up and internalize it.  Then make a pact with yourself that you will let yourself see signs you need to see.  Hopefully this will prevent you from ending up in a situation where things explode around you and you're standing, broken, wondering how this happened, and blaming yourself.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|NB4h4jTyaa	Run, don't walk, to your school counselor or psychologist and ask for help on leaving an abusive relationship. Let someone know about this, especially if there is threat of further violence.<br>  <br>  It is possible to trust another guy. Talking to a counselor will help you recognize the signs of an abuser.|`|SHARt1k3aa	You will trust again and you will be a lot smarter with your next choice.  Don't get a rebound guy though, take your time to heal and be with your friends (if you have any left.  I know controlling guys don't let girls have friends).  Get your self esteem back and never ever EVER let yourself get caught up in that again.  Be really careful.|`|OzaQvzqxaa	Be strong. He is not the only guy in the world. You deserve better than him. I believe in soul mates and yes you will be able to trust in another guy.  Just put and end quickly to abusive relationships. I'm so proud that you broke up with him. I have been through that also.
xouWDqpvaa	well as an english guy... i've heard that we're not very hot... we are not tanned like american boys but probably more down to earth.... idk though<br>  <br>  <br>  haha "jimmybrown 11" you made me lol|`|sN8aqb95aa	I'm an English Boy. :D<br>  (but really it depends where you go in england, some people have completely different accents from different parts of england!)<br>  <br>  I think you would hate the "chav" accent, that goes arround quite alot of england. Sounds like a different language, and usually its common for the poor people to have it.<br>  <br>  I blame foreigners.|`|JLFGfaC3aa	The accents are fun|`|ybleoGR5aa	err i live in england :) but im a girl..ha n do we have accents?!!? btw...if ppl associate our 'accent' as being posh they r totally wrong!! lol x|`|nFpDwQ7yaa	This is what I think. I really do love English boys, but I get tired of their accents after a while. And I bet they get tired of ours. But some of them... Oh... My... Lord! They are frekin' HOT, and I never get tired of their accents. Take Robbert Pattinson for example. Now there's a N.I.C.E. man. Well I hope that helped a little.|`|MP8Nek0Xaa	Well considering America has people like Zac Efron (LOL) then I would say American boys. But what do I know? I've never seen a British movie star. I've only seen ugly people who have British accents up where I live.|`|a7f44582f7bbfb8996d883accbaf5a63aa	i really don't care. any guy who shaves his legs, waxes his eyebrows, takes care of his skin hair and nails...i'm a sucker for metro boys. i don't care what nationality. oh yes and he should have long hair!!!|`|vWXSQDWlaa	i definitely think like british english australian guys are cute and have awesome cute accents they rock! too bad i live in the usa.|`|nb7OXa5Qaa	Im English but I have never met an American boy so I dunno.

06ed123961104a81613b31974ce73856aa	I'm glad that you realize that you should be paid! Consider not just the travel time and expenses, but also your dry-cleaning bill, wear and tear on your violin, the years you spent learning the violin, and of course your time. Will you be the only musician at these weddings? Will you be sitting outside in the sun? Will they feed you? Will you have to take the day off from your regular job? <br>  <br>  Anyway, I don't think there is an easy answer, just one that feels right for you. Your rate can vary, depending on the conditions of the wedding. However, don't under-value your talent, or your time.<br>  <br>  Rates also vary wildly, depending on the experience of the performer, the location of the wedding, and the economy. Your best source for for what you should charge is probably your (former) music teachers or other (former) students. <br>  <br>  I'm including some links to some websites that might be useful.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	$50-100 sounds reasonable.|`|qKbwBYRTaa	I don't know where you live but, I live in the French Quarter. I looked earlier today on theknot.com at a violinist for an hour and a half reception (she would play the intro for bridesmaids, bride to walk down the aisle, and music while people exited) and she charged $250. <br>  <br>  So, I would say anywhere between $150 and $250 would be a good range. If you have to go to the rehearsal I would charge at the least $50. That's a lot of traveling for you and you need to be compensated.
2CI6MwCzaa	If i was you do something sly. Like walk with your books in your hand and kinda bump into him and drop your books if hes a nice guy he will help you pick them back up and then you can talk to him.<br>  <br>  AND NO THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH LIKING A GUY TO GRADES ABOVE YOU!|`|D7jC0CNsaa	2 years difference isn't really an issue. Just be aware he might be looking for different levels of a relationship to you.<br>  <br>  You need to find out if he is into you first. Quite difficult, but perhaps try to isolate him (sporting event / lunchtime etc) ask him if he'd be keen to  go out sometime. I know it sounds hard but you need to basically put it all on the line if you don't interact with him much. Otherwise it will look like you have put to much thought into it. People like spontaneous actions when it comes to relationships and starting them.
OzPheiN1aa	dump your GF and ask this one out. sleep with her for a few months then trade her in as well|`|gJE0ujbzaa	You are still pretty young.  If you are seeing a girl you no longer have interest in, let her GO. You aren't doing her any favors by hanging on to her, when you've already decided there is no future. Let her go, and allow her to move on.  <br>  <br>  Then you can ask out this other girl. The two of you obviously have an attraction.  See where it goes.<br>  <br>  Don't see where it goes if you haven't let the other girl go yet. That will hurt her MUCH worse than breaking up with her, then going out with someone else.|`|cf87f1aa28522c98acc4676433f4e725aa	Dont mess up this good friendship by putting hormones into it.|`|sN8aqb95aa	She sounds just like my best girl mate too.<br>  Just have alot of fun, arrange some sleepovers (with other friends) if you can, and do plenty of truth or dares to fill in the teenie desire! It's just alot of fun, and she just likes making you happy.<br>  <br>  Nothing to be worried about, and really with your gf, only dump her if you think that it's not right, or not going anywhere.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  P.S. She probably feels the same way!|`|eK5QBP6gaa	it never works its called cheating and you always get caught and wot kind of a boyfriend are u if u cheat man ur makin men look like were the twa.ts|`|ZPqDhHpyaa	Wow. I am in this position and i am the new girl. I am so into this guy and it's obvious that he is into me, but he has a girlfriend that he is just not willing to leave- so i'll give you advice from both perspectives.<br>  <br>  THE GIRLFRIEND: If she's needy, then it is definitely out of signs that she is insecure with herself and the relationship. She is feeling like she has to hold onto something tight or it'll slip through. Unfortunately this means she is probably really into you. How old are you? If you are young, two years is a long time and i feel like everyone needs time to experience other people. I've been left by someone who was with me for two years and it hurt like hell, but i wouldn't have it any other way. Talk to her about how she has been acting and how she feels about this relationship.<br>  <br>  THE NEW GIRL: This is the role i'm playing now. Her flirty-ness indicates that she is probably into you. Get to know her a little better before jumping the gun. But don't do anything sneaky. If you really want to get this new girl better, take a break from your current girlfriend and see how things go. <br>  <br>  Good luck. Follow your heart, as easy as that sounds i know it's not. Someone is bound to get hurt. But just figure it out for yourself and really think! I mean, if you are attracted to a new girl- why lead the old girl on and just let her keep getting attached? Sometimes the hardest thing and what you should do are the same.|`|tysVIluYaa	not attracted to her? give her the dump.

WMR8hVlfaa	I don't understand what you're trying to say. You whine about how people who meet in college settle when they get married to one another, then tell us to do what makes us happy.<br>  <br>  Why does it really matter? If you've decided not to marry until after college, that's fine. Who cares what everyone else is doing? Why is it your business, and furthermore, why does it matter to you?|`|GYoNyoWtaa	Some people do. Some people don't. It's really as simply as that. I got married way before college, I got married the summer I graduated highschool. It really all depends on when you met the right person.|`|1HfLkTrdaa	that's just your teacher's opinion...and opinions are like a*holes, everybody's got one.  Some people say that others "settle" because they don't approve of that person's choice of partner...but only the ones involved know if that's the case or not, and no one else has the right to say.<br>  <br>  There's no guarantees in life whether you marry a high school sweetheart or wait until you're in your 40s and have all of your ducks in a row.|`|OHfZFR31aa	I don't think people necessarily settle. But they are in love and think they are now mature adults because they are in their 20s and out of school. But many don't realize that they don't have any real life experience, and being with someone when you have to worry about getting a job, paying a mortgage, having kids, etc is a lot more complex than dating someone whose biggest challenge for 4 years was whether or not they were going to pass a history exam.|`|4kuWOZowaa	Some people do not all people
4MiVftDFaa	HAHAHAHA buddy you need a life and a friend|`|YrHuv1g3aa	you need help!<br>  <br>  have sex with her!|`|klcqgST9aa	I'm a girl....<br>  <br>  Um, yeah, you need to work on that. The best way to cut any habit is to have a support group, I'm sure your girlfriend would be more than happy to support you. Try cutting it down is all. Like, if you do it say, at night? Do something else at night instead, like, online computer games, or talk on the phone. Cut ten times a day down to one, and just fix yourself whenever you notice it. Like, say you're in the shower and you put your hands there....put your hands on your head and waash your hair. Just teach yourself to occupy with other things.<br>  <br>  Oh, and guess what? The more infrequently you do it, the better it is when you do. Really. <br>  <br>  Set goals, and acheive them, maybe, cut it down to twice or three times a week, and it's okay to go for multiple rounds in one sitting. So like, if you finish three times in a night, that's once. Unless you do it once in the morning, after lunch and in the afternoon, that's three times. <br>  <br>  Really. Oh, maybe try like, phone sex with your girlsfriend, so you can do your thing and she doesn't feel left out.|`|dnwJmNkdaa	alright dude,  for starters sex drive is a renewable resource...

uNazz3HLaa	Well, seems like you're already into the idea of making one up for anyway. How about taking the angle of creating one that's cute, but funny? We females can't get enough of a guy with a sense of humor. The sense of humor displays wit, fun, and character. Just don't overdo a good thing. Once, maybe twice is nice. If you continue you may be moving into weirdo creepy ville.|`|w7aHSXCIaa	Omg! I'm in middle school too, and too me, having a poem written for me would be so sweet! I would just about die. I think you really should, but after you give them to her, dont assume that she wants you around ALL the time because then she'll get overwhelmed.|`|aM2JDDWgaa	well i wouldn't go overboard if she already knows you like her. it might seem a little stalkerish :]|`|4swYFtsSaa	what are you gay?|`|juczLKDEaa	Well it depends if the girl needs her space and is independent. If she is she might find it creepy. But if not it'd be really sweet just don't make it seriously creepy.|`|n336SjRiaa	yes do it. i'd die of how sweet that would be. just dont be too strong or something. hey, if you play the guitar, sing it!

1o3OqSioaa	Forget "spontaneity" now. That's gone forever, at least until the kids are grown and gone. But the good news is that with some "planning" you can regain your love life. <br>  Get someone to watch the kids for a night or weekend. Dress up and go out or, undress and stay in. Cook a candle lit dinner for your wife. Fill up the tub with bubble bath, put in some great smelling bath oil, throw some rose petals on the bed, and light candles, and play some romantic music. Set the stage for an exciting evening of romance. It will help your wife get into the mood for love, when she feels that you care about romancing her, as opposed to just getting her in the sack. With the kids gone for once, she may just want to relax, and do nothing. She may not want to be "jumped" on suddenly the first time that the kids are gone. You don't want to appear too eager, and turn her off, so just make the evening a date with her, and make it all about her. The rewards will be worth the sacrifice in the long run. <br>  Don't feel alone, many couples find themselves trapped in this rut. The ones that get out of the rut, are the ones willing to put in the extra effort to save their love life, and many times their marriage, as well.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	Been there with the 2 jobs so she wouldn't have to. She was always good about the sex though.<br>  <br>  Things I can tell you to look out for down the road are;<br>  <br>  You have to take time to reflect and do things efficiently. I worked a lot harder than I really needed to because of the waste caused by me being too busy to properly 'mind the store'.<br>  <br>  While you're out working she's spending a lot of time thinking and she'll get notions that you're ignoring her and that you have a fun filled exciting life at work...with other girls of course.<br>  <br>  You have to force romantic time with her, I mean for a date night every week or something like that, not just sex. Otherwise, like I said instead of appreciating your hard work she'll feel neglected.<br>  <br>  Make time to take care of yourself. If you work yourself half to death and get fat in the process don't expect her to have sympathy. You'll end up middle aged, spent, sick, alone and paying alimony.<br>  <br>  While you're out working, she's developing friends and connections whether on line or real, that don't include you. After a while, she'll come to actually resent your intrusion into her world. The house, the kids, her life will all become hers in her mind and she'll actually see you as a burden. Just another person to clean up after and feed and all you want is sex. At the same time she resents you for not being with her more, she'll resent your presence. You will think of it as your house, but your place in it will become the bottom back of some closet. To prevent this you have to force the time to be there and be involved in her life as much a possible.<br>  <br>  What can I say? You're dealing with a woman. That's life.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  EDIT - I notice some guys are telling you to do housework and help her with her work in addition to your two jobs. That's a nice thing to do once in a while, but in my experience it didn't improve what I got from her. I found that if you do everything for them they get satisfied that all is right with the world and once they feel satisfied they tend to think everybody feels satisfied too, if you see what I mean. I noticed an inverse relationship to doing dishes and getting laid.|`|rm1oLtNtaa	You need to take time off for your marriage.. get a sitter or send them to the grandparents .. and have a great date night or date weekend.. <br>  At least it is a shot.. do date night... just dinner and movies.. but you need to make time for each other...<br>  <br>  Good Luck.. I know from experience .. its hard...|`|EMKuBql8aa	I work 2 job, have 2 kids and my wife also stays at home....I feel your pain, lol. <br>  <br>  I found this is a sure way to make her in the mood on your days off at least: First, turn off the baby monitors in the morning if you are still using them, shut the door letting her sleep, get the kids up for the day by yourself, clean the house for her. Let her wake up whenever she feels like it to a clean house and fed children. Then, make dinner for her cleaning up the mess, after the kids are asleep, end the night with a foot massage...it works every time, lol. <br>  <br>  I'm just looking forward to when the kids are a bit older and life is easier, just hang in there and make friends temporarily with "palmala"|`|hs793CCxaa	You both have to make time for "us". If she finds it difficult, then you can arrange it. Gee, I know there are great tips in the e-book at <a href="http://www.bringbackthespark.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bringbackthespark.com</a> - it's only about $35 I think, and it sounds just what you guys need. It sure helped several couple friends.<br>  <br>  Think babysitters, date nights, cuddles for no reason - NO REASON, just because you love her. You need to get back to "us" and make her want you, "big boy"! It's worth a try even though you may not have a lot of time. You may need to schedule time alone. Your relationship is too important. Good luck.|`|dCmSA6r2aa	welcome to busy married life hon sorry<br>  but if both want it there is always time<br>  drop and eat her out while she cooks<br>  drag her in the shower with you<br>  when she bends over cleaning up the room slide a hand between her legs always time if you want it|`|OHfZFR31aa	There's always time. Sex doesn't have to take an hour - you don't have 15 minutes for each other before you go to sleep or when you first wake up? What about weekends? Make time|`|UUiOxEoVaa	Do yourself a massive favor and make time right away.  Talk to your spouse about it before it gets too out of hand too.  Once this becomes a problem in a relationship, until it's fixed it often festers and leads to horrible feelings both about the relationship and about yourself.<br>  <br>  You need to keep this invigorated and talk to your spouse about it...maybe show her some of the responses on this post.  Sex is an emotional thing for both men and women if they know it or not.  In a relationship, it's a form of communication that typically cannot be substitute by another form of communication.  Basically letting your sex life become poor is as bad as letting your acts of non-sexual affection or verbal communication in a relationship become poor.  <br>  <br>  Sex is important... it's not something that can be put off until the ideal time.  If you always make this secondary you are basically taking the most intimate form of affection and Communication in your life on the back burner.  In the end this will harm your relationship and effect both of you negatively.|`|PXnn6LoPaa	this might sound strange, but is she on birth control?  I always have a huge jump in sex drive when we change up the birth control - not pills, just go between condoms and none.  Like, if we haven't used condoms in a while it turns me on to feel a condom, like when we were young.  But if we've been using condoms for a while it really makes me crazy to have naked sex!  I don't know, just a thought...you know, change things up somehow.  Obviously there could be issues like her body image, or just her being tired from taking care of 3 kids...that's like working 3 jobs, literally!  Let her know she's beautiful all the time and maybe do something different with the dick!|`|AA11825142	Maybe your wife is just drained emotionally and physically with 3 kids at home! You probably need to get her away for a weekend and give her a break from the kids. I don't care what anyone says being an at home mom isn't easy. I did it once for 1 year and I was a mess LOL I felt unattractive and didn't know how to have a conversation with anyone. So the last thing on my mind was having sex. And I understand its hard on you too (no pun intended LOL) you work two jobs so she can stay home and you deserve to be treated well. I would say try and get away and rekindle some of you and her time. It may not be perfect the first time she may want to rest most of the time. But if you can afford it try to do it once a month. Or get an overnight sitter and lock yourselves in the bedroom to just chill watch some movies together it will all come back!|`|qw7BmBq6aa	Thats easy, make her do part time work, quit one of your jobs then you'll have more time together.  Either that or schedule in a date night once a week and get busy!<br>  <br>  You need to tell her you're feeling this way, maybe she just got caught up in the every day buzz of life and forgot how important it is to have you at the top of the priority poll.<br>  <br>  if a marriage is to survive, we need to put eachother first, not the kids.|`|9HoXpsP6aa	It sounds like you're running out of steam working so much.  But don't forget, your wife has a job too and it isn't stress-free either. You two really need time to yourselves, away from the kids.  I bet she would love if you dropped the kids off at the babysitter and went home and had a dinner and a movie night, but with no kids to 'interrupt'.  I personally have a higher sex drive when me n my boyfriend (of 6 years-no kids) just have a nice, fun day together talking and just hanging out.  It's easy to get caught up working, but this would definately help.  It helped our sex life.|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	Kids take our energy out. Get someone to take care of them for the evening once in awhile and see if that is the real reason. Go out together at nights, get a babysitter  from time to time and take her (your wife) some place. The problem you`re having is there`s never time for your marriage as you said it.  You have three kids...hmm,  exhausting|`|oPYhUi8baa	Your wife should definitely be compensating you for your two jobs. I can't believe your doing that for her. *Whipped*<br>  (=|`|z6IekuwSaa	If the kids are babies, you'll get it back you just have to wait a little. I was just too exhausted when she was first born. Finally, at 4 months I'm just getting back into our old ways. It wasn't just the tiredness though, she has to feel beautiful. It doesn't matter if you think she's attractive or not. You have to wait for her to adjust to her post 3 kids body and accept it. That's how it was for me.<br>  <br>  <br>  O Wow, Chad has the right idea. lol. I think I would've def jumped my hubby sooner if he did that! lol. Gosh all this sex talk, the baby is asleep and my hubs isn't home, darn 24 hour duty!

If it's something special to you, bury it in a secret place. Aye, treasure, matey! Ha ha, no actually I mean it, I buried my journal and it's still in the backyard... Well, excuse me, I have some digging to do.... :D <br>  Hope I helped!|`|fwIe1sQwaa	On your email, just change your password. You are going to have to talk to your Dad a lot and perhaps argue a lot, many times. After months of arguing, he will start to back off. But that is long term.|`|JAJVHc9uaa	Dont murder your dad you jerk!  Would you rather go to jail or have them look through your files?  Just tell them to stop.  Or log out of your hot mail, hide your journal.|`|B91DUxNraa	Don't be silly! You can't murder your dad. My mom does the same thing, only more annoying. She doesn't sit behind me, but she has spywhere installed and when I'm in bed, she searchs up all the stuff I do. So in a few hours, she will be reading this. (UGH! STOP MOM!) Lolz. First off, hide your journal in a better place, like under your pillow or in your hamper. I have a journal and NO ONE has been through it because I hide it in a good place. Secondly, just talk to your dad. Ask him to have more trust in you and to not invade your personal stuff. I'm sure your dad is just looking out for you. Just talk to him about it. I'm sure he'll understand. :)|`|dGBbFwFWaa	u dont mention your age.. but now days  parents have to get involved in their kids stuff for safety only... if u have nothing to hide it shouldnt really bother u.. but maybe because of that thought of u wanting to kill your father.. maybe he sense u might be planing out his murder u cant blame him if thats what u have in mind.. its only fair he knows what is going on.. in the other hand u can talk to him and let him know that u feel is lack of privacy and respect for yourself.. and that u would appreciate if he just didnt read what its your personal journal.. good luck|`|M4HmpFyfaa	Ask him nicely to back off, because he's just overprotective of you. Trust me, even though you're really annoyed with him, you'll be glad that at least he wasn't underprotective of you. It's like how Windows Vista is really annoying, but it has really good security. It's the same with your dad. He would rather be too protective of you and make sure that you don't do anything wrong than make the mistake of not protecting you at all.|`|Zg4zNGI8aa	i would hide them in a better place and not talk to them any more.|`|AA11596133	THIS IS A PROBLEM YOU NEED TO BE DISCUSSING WITH YOUR COUNSELOR - that is what they get paid for.|`|XJlD2kPsaa	jeez, just talk to em, i mean if you cant find the will to tell em to backoff well then you are weak...you wouldnt be able to find it within you to kill your dad if you cant even talk to him...so dude, talk to him or hide your stuff put up a pass, or delete your stuff or just do soemthing else instead of reading emails...
EnpCmx1Uaa	Your dad should talk to you more on the phone, try to call him more when he is not working, and tell him how you fell.  Just because he and your mom are not together anymore doesn't mean you can't tell him the same things you tell your mom.  he probably feels like an outsider to your world, tell him what is happening in your life and ask about his.  Sooner or later all your questions about him will get answered.  Don't worry about it, I am sure it will all work out for you.|`|O4KBKZEkaa	This happens a lot and no matter what it always hurts.You need to have a good heart to heart with your dad. He hasn't forgotten about you but maybe he isn't exactly positive about his role now that you have a step dad.You need to tell him what you need him to do. Parents don't always know the right thing to do with stuff like this. Communication is the key here. Good luck. I hope thing work out for you.|`|4rLdaCNHaa	Sure he should, but men are not emotional creatures, they often have trouble expressing their feelings and some barely talk at all.<br>     Why not start by calling him, tell him you just want to know how he's doing and if every things going well for him. Your gonna have to think up things to talk about, so think about things you may have in common. When you get brave enough tell him you kind of miss him and just wanted to talk a bit. If you keep calling every so often, i think he'll probably start to respond, he'll be flattered that you miss him and made the effort to call and let him know.<br>     Try it, you have nothing to loose and everything to gain.
Nngdk0izaa	Friendships that are rocking on the wrong boat should paddle to find the right boat. If you're sick of it, try to (at least give it a try!) talk to both your friends. If they get defensive, or if you get defensive, then remember that they are your friends. A shaky friendship isn't strange; but find a way back to land to switch the boat isn't strange either. I know for me, I'm always wanting things back the way they were the last year, or the last, or the last. But if you keep moving on, you'll learn to accept the "present" (as in, the present of now and past, PRESENT, future).<br>  <br>  Added: Oh. They ditched just to see JoBros? That wasn't intelligent, and the parents didn't do anything about it? Crying is a way to let your anger out in a better way. They say that if you cry, you'll feel so much better at the end. Your friends are rocking the boat a bit too hard, and should really learn to keep calm and respectful to you.|`|2XTkSV4daa	Basically you guys need to sit and talk it out (with maybe another friend to serve as mediator) and if that doesn't work out, just hang with your other friends. At least switch schools at the beginning of a school year, not in the middle.|`|QilfSBfsaa	Why don't you find out why they mad at you?  Did you do something wrong? You have to learn to face the problem but not avoid it.  If you are not happy with someone in new school, will you switch school again? Then how many schools you are going to switch???

F0Qg8XOWaa	Getting the authorities involved in a family matter isn't the most pleasant experience for those involved. You can be removed from<br>  that environment. Give your parents an ultimatum to deal with this or you will call 911 the next time this happens. If you call  911, like I said <br>  it won't be pleasant for your parents or your sister and most of all yourself as I know you don't want to be removed from your home.<br>  They need to make this stop!!|`|JAJVHc9uaa	Oi.

Your mother should make your sister stop, she can do something about it, and if she doesnt' things are jsut going to keep getting worse, and this is going to keep happening.  SHe already almost stabbed you in the eye, right?  That sucks, I'm sorry.  Sounds like she definatly needs anger management, or your parents need to kick her out or call the police to have her picked up.  Good luck.|`|4VRB5FwOaa	what? you shouldn't let anyone hurt you, none the less your older sister.<br>  <br>  im the youngest sibling of 3 and my oldest sister was harsh on me until i reached certain age and was able to defend my self. i was thought to never hit a girl but my sister skipped the list.<br>  <br>  you should simply call the police on her, believe me the authorities dont take abuse lightly and you are a minor and she is an adult.<br>  <br>  just call the cops :)|`|T7uR3nT1aa	whats wrong with your momm!?!??!?!<br>  get help !<br>  call the police.<br>  wooow.|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	even if she your sister u need to call the police|`|B91DUxNraa	Okay, so there's this thing called 911 and they can help you with emergencies, crazy people, accidents, etc. Call 911 RIGHT AWAY! It's not right for your mom to just sit back and do nothing. And your sister is almost of legal age (21) she should know better. Please call 911, they can take your sister away to a crazy house. Please please PLEASE call. You're sister might have a mentall diesease or something, and I'm not trying to be mean. Call right away and trust me, your life will be SO much better!|`|EIxFvhYTaa	I'm sorry that this is happening to you. Remember that you are not the problem here... there is nothing that you are doing to deserve what is happening to you, even if you upset her for whatever reason, it doesnt give her the right to hit you. <br>  So now that you have gone to your parents and they have not been able to help you... you need to get help from someone else. Talk to your school counselor to see what she advises you to do. If she/he can get your family together to talk, they might be able to get your sister into therapy and anger management classes...<br>  If things get out of hand, dont be afraid to call 911! Dont worry that she's your sister... because she is not thinking about that when she is so angry that she looses control.
HKkbqlIuaa	Whether she's cheating on you or not, she is not treating you with the respect and decency you deserve as her boyfriend. It sounds like you guys need to have a talk. A good relationship requires communication on everything, even the most unconfortable of subjects. Either she needs to get better at communicating, or you need to find someone else. It doesn't sound like you're an insanely jealous boyfriend, so it's not too much to ask for you girlfriend to talk to you.

Oh well best of luck!|`|XJlD2kPsaa	man, if i were that dude, i wouldnt know how to respond.. i would just blank, i would be like sitting there in fear...just get to the point...i mean how can you respond to that, "sorry, honey?" he'll get the point but he wont know what to say|`|2g1rxroVaa	sounds good.

I think you should try to go out with the other guy or see if hes intrested in you. Maybe you two will have a better spark, or he will show that he likes you instead of a relationship with no real feelings(that seems like what the previous relation ship with the first guy was). But just oyu should try to nicely tell him to be friends without getting into lots of detail, just tell him there's no spark(if there isnt) and that he should be happy with someone else. I really overall dont think that you should go out with him again-it will leave both of you in this circle or going out and breaking up again and again-but try the new guy.<br>  email me with more questions if you'd like, and good luck! :]|`|uNazz3HLaa	Ahhhh. I remember those days. Sigh. <br>  Well, I wonder if you catch him looking at you periodically, as if he's hoping to catch your eye. Does he try to smile at you? Does he wait for your eyes to meet, then slowly look away? These are usually the typical signs of attraction. <br>  However, if none of these signs is obvious to you, if you're the bold type, ask to speak with him for a minute, and just ask him. Nothing is less fun than sitting around wondering what is going on in someone's head. The direct approach, is usually the best one. Just try to show a little class when you do it. Try not to cause a big scene. Maybe try to catch him between classes.|`|XSxZ3JN8aa	Hi ,<br>  I think i can help You here ,<br>  Beleive me , Guys bounce back fast ,<br>  i had a friend , & this guy kept asking her out becuase ,<br>  she kept dumping him , i think it ended up 6 times !<br>  I think he still likes you , if you like him ,<br>  Mabey  you should ask him out : )|`|WqW21poqaa	he probably still does. i dont know if u really like him if uve already gone out with him 2 times.<br>  <br>  answer please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ag78g4CStaIdqUBe0jUjFbXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227155335AAlg56k">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|r6tSNcdyaa	as hard as it may b, u need to talk to him and explain everything like u did in your question. see what he thinks and take it from there.|`|AA11030638	If he TRULY liked you he probably wouldn't care if you pushed him off a bridge.|`|q8Ro5GGhaa	i think he does. just tell him that you like him and see how it goes. if not you have the other guy to go for|`|RgMj44kPaa	one way to really find out, <br>  <br>  ask him|`|6QLoPNNYaa	I had a friend in a very similar situation several years ago. Even if the guy does like you, it will probably end up badly. If you have already had these kinds of issues before, then they are likely to re-emerge and become issues again. If you are in eighth grade now, it might be advisable to wait to see who is interesting in high school. I liked a girl (and thought I was in love with her) for 6 months in middle school. It turned out terribly, but I found an amazing girl that I have been dating for almost a year and a half. Keep looking you will find the right guy.<br>  <br>  Good Luck =D|`|XJlD2kPsaa	he probably has some feelings for you if he stuck wth you even after you broke up with him once, he'd probably go with you but the first couple days would be awkward|`|VMUwtGCuaa	People can change over time.|`|EswkNpFqaa	well if you like him, talk to him and see if he asks you out again. Don't ask him if he likes you, he will get shy and avoid you. You also can't tell him you like him because he will get shy and avoid you. This is what happens when you are in middle school.

HiSVA9p8aa	When you said 'beige' I thought "cooked oatmeal" and instantly said YUCK.<br>  <br>  Cream flowers would be nice against orange dresses, no matter the orange.  So would yellow flowers.  Make sure there is lots of greenery because that, too, would be gorgeous against orange dresses.<br>  <br>  You don't say the colour of your dress.  If it is white, off-white or ivory, white flowers might be a bit drab.  Yellows and oranges would be a lovely bouquet.|`|hVVALFAPaa	Orange is very unique, but it is your wedding. What does future hubby say?<br>  <br>  If you do go with orange dresses, I would stay with the beigey flowers, then you have an orange/beige bouquet. Perhaps the bridesmaids could have some orange ribbons.<br>  <br>  I would stay away from the yellow with orange. You don't want to look too sherbert-y.|`|bf6K6uubaa	it depends on where you live but orange can be very many shades...are you saying bright orange? or more like a darker burnt orange...cause sept is in the fall unless you live somewhere on the west coast like cali.  and i like the idea of the white flowers with hints on orange...and not sure what beige flowers are...but they don't sound as pretty as white ones|`|zHX9tlnWaa	I like the second idea much better. Yellow will look a lot better against the orange than beige.|`|JAJVHc9uaa	I like the second combo.|`|WL1SfxGEaa	While orange is a lovely color, it can be very unflattering for most people's skin tones, and it also doesn't flatter figures very well. If you have any thicker bridesmaids, I'm sure they'll agree when they try on the dresses. You could possibly find a very light, pastel orange, which will probably be easier for everyone to wear. Also, bright colors are very noticable, and you want everyone's eyes on you. :) Perhaps light yellow dresses with orange sashes would give the effect you want. And remember that your cake can wear any color successfully, so you might consider orange flowers there as well. Accent colors add color without overpowering. If you're going for fall colors, you could also add some autumn leaves and orange flowers to your decorations. I'm sure you'll find the right combination. Have a beautiful wedding, and congratulations.|`|FMjsTCWTaa	If you put your bridesmaids in orange dresses then I like the idea of them carrying a white bouquet best or a bouquet with lots of yellow and greenery in it.  I like the idea of you carrying an orange bouquet. <br>  <br>  You could pick up a few fake flowers in orange, yellow and white from a dollar store and take them with you when you go to look for orange dresses.  Then you can see how the different choices might look.|`|rQlsLZ9Baa	I'm getting married the first week of October and my colors are black and white with orange flowers. At first I was totally freaked out that it would come out too holloween-ish, but the orange flowers against the black bridesmaids' dresses is really eye catching. Plus, we're using flowers that have yellow and red aspects (circus roses, asiatic lilies)<br>  <br>  Personally, I think the orange dresses might be going too far. You never want to drench your wedding in one or two colors. Instead, try different shades of the same color patterns. My friend had very pretty bridesmaid dresses in a soft yellow and they carried white flowers. You could do the same with orange flowers, but since not many people look good in orange, I'd suggest keeping that color in your dresses. <br>  <br>  If you're really set on orange dresses, David's Bridal has a cute line of patterened dresses with orange in them. Personally, I like the look of the girls all being in different dresses. <br>  <br>  P.S. I'm carrying orange flowers to match my bridesmaids orange flowers.|`|vyL7yEleaa	i think if you want orange in your wedding colors i would put them in the flowers as orange is a very bright color and will draw a lot of attention away from you and to the bridesmaids. <br>  <br>  if you are going for a fall type wedding feel you want to stay more towards the earth tones, browns beige's and greens. <br>  <br>  but i really think the orange dresses would stand out way to much unless you did a burnt orange that isn't quiet as bright.|`|1dNBZFPbaa	No, no.. I LOVE the idea of orange and yellow! I like your second idea better..<br>  <br>  I also got married in September, and went with fall colours.. here is a photo: <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/dorizzzle/AWeddingPhoto#" rel="nofollow">http://picasaweb.google.com/dorizzzle/AW...</a>|`|9ceIg9xnaa	Orange... EEEKKK.... I'd do salmon before orange.. Honestly.. Orange is an attention color.. And you want attention on you! <br>  <br>  do a milder color!|`|QilfSBfsaa	I like the 2nd choice.|`|vFZq7522aa	I think that they are both way cute!!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	To be perfectly honest, very few people can wear orange (or anything in that color family..salmon and coral are the same color and just a shade lighter than bright orange) and have it look good on them. I can do it but my sister who has the same pale skin (though she is cool toned while I am warm toned) can't wear orange at all. Most people can't do it. <br>  <br>  That said, I prefer the look of the first option.
wmh4SLwqaa	oh my gosh you poor thing. i cant totally relate (im 15) but i remember seventh grade. i didnt like it either. and believe it or not i was the short chubby girl too. im stilll short, but believe me its not as bad as it seems. i promise. im stilll kinda chubby too. but you have to embrace what you have and work with it until you're over it. i excercise a lot now and eat really healthy. i go to the gym 5 times a week. its funner when you have someone to go with you though. like a friend, neighbor, or a parent. maybe sibling :) but anyways i know times can be rough. whe ever im having a bad day i go outside or listen to music. (& sometimes i excercise. weird, i know right??) im starting to like it haha. & to feeel good about yourself, surround yourself with the things you love the most. like in my room i have pictures of my family and i, my friends and the beach. i love the beach. & dont worry about being popular or not. who cares. just being yourself and doing whatever you do makes you popular in your own way! dont try to keep up with the other girls. (they're  not perfect either. no body is) by the way: my favorite thing to listen to when i have a badday is jack johnson. he's amazing.<br>  <br>  i hope i helped you! just keep your head up and smile. & praying ALWAYS helps!|`|ROhLU1MEaa	gain your self steem by doing things that make u feel good. if u r worried about ur weigth try exercising that helps and don't worry there is a moment in everybody's life when u feel sad and lonely ,things will get better,and don't pay attention to people that try hurting ur feelings because u kno that u r better than whatever they call u.|`|fAutJ3Poaa	aww when you move schools you'll probably make loads of friends and gain your confidence back.<br>  If you feel that bad about your weight then go on a diet, i'm sure your family would  help you out by buying more healthy food etc.<br>  hope i could help :)|`|MdWHUD7waa	Your a teenage girl.

Watch what you eat and exercise.|`|NKbCmlQ2aa	I'm a sophomore in high school. I've been dealing with the same insecurities for a long time now. I've never had a real best friend, except for my boyfriend who is now in jail. Plus, my parents just got divorced and my family is moving. So I'm going through a lot right now also. Girl, trust me, you are not the only one. I've stayed home from school all week crying and bitching about my boyfriend, since he's gonna be gone for a while. But sometimes you just have to say screw you and just be happy. It's not about how great you look, sweetheart. Try joining sports teams, or school clubs. That's a fast, fun, and easy way to start meeting new people. Good luck.|`|dmBnnwXvaa	Everyone was rough patches in life, the best thing to do is to stay confident in yourself! You can transfer to another school but don't let the way you felt at your old school carry with you at this new school. Instead of concentrating on the situation with these "girls" who seem really vicious use any extra time for yourself, go ahead start eating healthy and exercising, or take up some sort of hobby. Don't let this drag you down! Shrug it off like it never happened and people will see this confidence and WANT to be your friend! TRUST ME, if you feel and believe in yourself and show confidence others WILL see it.|`|wvh717Pbaa	hey hey relax... ok this happens to everyone at least once in their live. obviously you need to stop..and breathe... ok ready<br>  <br>  breathe in... breathe out.....<br>  <br>  ok now onto some good advise. about these girls... probably you should avoid confrontation... i don't know the situation but from what i know all teenagers have feuds with others... especially females.<br>  <br>  i tutor high school students.<br>  <br>  Now about your unpopularity... it's always in the eye of the beholder.. make new friends that are like you... when you try being friends that you feel are better to you, what ends up happening is you feel inadequate, although it might not be true. <br>  <br>  Your weight? lol that is normal. and btw people who diet, statistically fail, when they do fail because they are not mature enough to accept that they aren't perfect. <br>  <br>  To answer your question about your 'identity crisis', join a on campus group... you know get involved with something. it'll help with your friends as well, and build your esteem. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|ojwRgCLqaa	First of all you should try to look good. Dress nice and make your hair and makeup look nice. Also, find some really good friends. That honestly care about you. But be nice to everyone so that nobody will hate you. If you feel like your a little overweight you don't need to go crazy with exercises. Just take a short walk everyday and try to limit your unhealthy junky foods. Don't totally take them away all at once, just slowly eat less junk and more healthy stuff. You gotta stick to it to and really want it or there's no point.<br>  <br>  Best of luck :)|`|7GvCw1Mhaa	lol idk :(|`|FJcnNS1faa	Dont listen to the digusting pig who just posted that nasty comment just relax and when you go to your new school youll have a fresh start make an effort to meet new people introduce yourself and dont worry once you go through puberty youll look fine relax and everything will work out|`|ph9ZE1veaa	ummm. stop complaining. suck it up. millllllions of people have it way worse then you. kids in africa only eat once a week, some kids parents beat them almost to death, others live on the streets.<br>  <br>  seriously listen to how selfish you are compared to others.|`|AA12259102	Part of your problem is probably hormones.They affect your weight and your moods.The best thing to get them straightened out is exercise.Probation officer? Sounds like you've been screwing up a bit.Get busy,start looking for new things that interest you.Try talking to people you've never talked to before, some of them will blow you off but some of them will talk  to you.Get more comfortable with yourself then if you still want to, switch schools.But if you go to another school now feeling like you do you won't make a very good first impression.|`|K119R72Caa	Well maybe the girls you have problems with made you change your attitude. Just don't care what other people. I mean people suck,they really do and will say anything to hurt your feelings. I think if you find it would be best is to switch schools. Just make some new friends start over fresh where nobody knows you.<br>  <br>  If you don't like the way you look change yourself. I mean you know make your hair pretty (straight-in it and curl it) but on some mascara and some eye shadow. It doesn't have to be a lot make it matter your skin tone. Wear some cute earrings and a cute outfit that matches. Smell good you know wear some nice perfume or something. If your not allowed to wear make up for some reason ask you mom and dad if you can at least wear clear mascara,that's just as good and makes it look more natural. <br>  <br>  I really hope that helps you out. Good Luck!! Everything will turn out fine =D
AA11190264	baby girl, i would tell you the same thing. your friend cares so much about you that he's willing to endanger the friendship just to tell you the reality. he wants you to see what he sees. and it seems like you don't care of what's he's saying then baby girl, he doesn't want to be a part of your down fall and say "i told you so" in 30 years or less.|`|4rLdaCNHaa	It sounds to me as if he knows a lot more than he is saying. And "no one" goes off like that for no reason at all, especially the reference he made to you being a door mat. Then of course, he's seeing you in a light he hasn't before, he see's your unhappiness.<br>    If he is backing off, then he knows something and doesn't want to get involved or maybe doesn't think it will do any good. He has obviously decided that he can't hang around and watch you do this to yourself and he's right, it hurts to see a friend do this to themselves. <br>    And in a way he is right, sure it's ok for your husband to go out now and then, but "alot" and you know nothing of his adventures, except what he decides to tell you? Are you afraid to follow or check up on him, i think you are.<br>    Tell me about "a lot", does he usually go out with the guys? Does he always go to the same place/places? How do you know that person he was caught with the last time isn't still connecting to him. If he goes out a lot how do you know he hasn't got a "regular" on the side?<br>    These are all questions, you don't want answers too, is that right? And when the hammer lands, will you run crying to this friend of yours, because that is what he is backing off from.<br>    Doesn't he invite or try to get you to go with him, you are suppose to be the main and most important person in his life, the one he "wants" to spend time with.<br>    Look, just go and check up on him, if he's suppose to be with friends and isn't, then the answer is more than clear.<br>    Your friend happens to know/understand men and their behavior more than you ever will, so maybe it's time to start listening to what he has to say, rather than talking.<br>     Sorry, but it's just my opinion and feelings, so what would it hurt to prove your friend and i wrong?|`|4wWKAGjsaa	He knows you well and is disappointed that you are not in an equal partnership with your husband.<br>  He is standing away and can clearly see the mistakes you are making.<br>  Friends are for ever, husbands come and go.<br>  <br>  You are allowed to correct your mistake with your husband.<br>  If he is treating you like this after two years whilst still within the new bloom of love.  How will he treat you after 5 years, 10 years and if you have kids.<br>  Be a Slave to your husband or be an Independent  Wife who does not allow her husband to treat her like a door mat.
sgRDJUXqaa	1. You can't be racist against women.  Womanhood is not a race.<br>  2. It is illegal to deface money.<br>  3. It is illegal to beat someone.<br>  <br>  First off, don't be mean to your brother.  Second, never hit your brother.  I'm not saying what your dad did was right, but you need to stop being violent.  Violence brings on more violence, so just stop.  You are immature and a child still; you'll grow out of your tantrums.  But if your father continues to beat you, you need to speak to a trusted adult about child abuse.

di7N0CMkaa	what a bit**!<br>  Here's an idea, since she is obviously out to sting your bff group;<br>  <br>  Have one of your friend's b/f (or crush) go out with this girl. Tell him to treat her like absolute crap and make her sorry for messing with him.<br>  Then, get him to tell you everything that happened. Take the most sensitive thing you learn and throw it back at her.<br>  It is mean but, you can use it to embarrass her and put her in her place.<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Oh, also make sure she sees the same guy with your friend, the very next day. She will realize your group caused the horrible date, that it was a set-up and, she will stay away from other girl's guys.

I agree with Dreamer that the biggest turn on for me, though, would have to be how he presents himself. If he shows respect for the girl or something similar. <br>  <br>  I currently really like a guy right now. Many people think he's really cute(including me) lol :), but what I love about him is that he always tries to view everyday positively.

3a74f8e968179db88a366eba81b6d2e0aa	I don't know as it would hurt to just talk to her.  You don't know what she wants to say, but apparently talking to you is part of her process of dealing with it.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't think she'll be broadcasting this around town, but just talking to her?  What could it hurt?  Maybe she just wants to hear from you that it's over and won't happen again.|`|LazJHDzVaa	you have been party to something that probably shook this woman to her foundations the least you can do is go see her and answer any questions she needs to ask withoout telling her what you think she might want to hear. put your hands up, take responsibility for what you have done to her and give her all the time she needs|`|O4KBKZEkaa	Meet with her but do it in a public place. She may feel the need to belt you one and you probably don't want to encourage that.Don't count on it not getting out . This was a risk you took. Now you have to deal with the fallout whatever it may be.|`|EotRDimLaa	the only thing you can really do is apologize|`|4wWKAGjsaa	You have two choices, confirm what he told her and she will do what she has intended to do, presumably humiliate you publically, and if that happens you will loose your job.<br>  <br>  Where as If you meet her and are shocked at her suspicions, showing great affront that she would even consider you having an affair with her husband.<br>  Just because you work together.<br>  <br>  You will be saved public Humiliation and he will have to sort out whatever problems he has with his wife.|`|PS9JIKR7aa	you know what, go and meet her.<br>  listen to what she says and apologise, its the least you can do to try and show her some respect.<br>  for her maybe understanding is key to forgiveness.|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	I'm betting he told her that you seduced him. Of course I dont know what happened but maybe she wants the truth. She might want to see if he is still betraying her by lying about the whole thing. He may have painted you to be a real sIut. If you want her to know the truth and not his story you should talk to her. See what she wants. You dont have to plan out anything if you tell the truth.|`|7iEk06aDaa	Don't do it. It's on his plate , now, not yours. He's the one who decided to spill the beans, so now it's on him. we all make mistakes that we regret, so learn from this one and don't go for married men any more. It hurts everyone involved. There are plenty of single men out there to fall in love or have sex with.
CBa9G4j4aa	Yeah I would be mad, you don't know if he was lying because he doesn't trust you or something. That would definitely irritate me. He definitely has something to hide but don't forgive him for it!|`|cHM2US6xaa	I`d be very mad and I would talk to him right when I saw him to that.<br>  <br>  I have a bad temper :) =P<br>  <br>  So I would prob. say something like " what the **** were you doing looking through my phone ?!"<br>  <br>  And I wouldn't wait until a couple days later either.|`|kdmhuVTEaa	Yes you have a certain amount of right to be mad.<br>  It's your personal phone and the information is for your eyes and your eyes only, unless you say other wise.<br>  It's not the fact that they were looking through it that would make me mad, or the lame excuse. But it seems to me like he does not trust you!|`|RD05jXYwaa	broken or abused trust is a valid justification for anger. big issue here is trust his vs yours. he broke an unvoiced trust by encroaching into areas of your life without asking your permission. he knew it was wrong as he tried to deflect detection. how do you want to trust some proven entrust worthy? do you want to try to rebuild this trust. the ball is in your court. tmm|`|Sy9Lk9uJaa	yea i would but then i would buy a cell phone of my own, actually im doing that rite now|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	No, I would not be mad.I have nothing to hide.|`|A5nZFjEoaa	ok your relationship won't last if you let something as tiny as that keep ya'll from speaking for a whole week! You asked him and you need to trust him now. Besides, even if he was looking through your phone, that just means he cares enough to see who you're talking to. He doesn't want any guys trying to take you from him!|`|f280030b5c3fd08f70ea29f8d59505d5aa	he should have asked, and you shouldnt have anything to hide, so you probably shouldnt be mad, other then thats invading privacy, if he trusts you he shouldnt have to go through your phone, i hate that crap.|`|3csUXUzCaa	i'd kinda be angry, cuz he kinda had no right to just take it and go through it like that. , idk, its kind of annoying when that happens.|`|BbaR8Hhqaa	if you really love him, you would believe him.<br>  if its bugging him say you really just want the truth and if he did want to go through your messages, whats the big deal??<br>  you shouldnt have anything to hide from him.<br>  i wouldnt be mad.|`|BvlYQMf1aa	I'd be mad if it was anyone other then my bf (if i had one)|`|eUacdVGgaa	I dont know about being mad for a week, but def. ok to get mad.|`|MAsnWWycaa	I'd be pretty angry.|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	yes i wood be mad|`|w7sReKuLaa	the fact that he took your phone shouldn't bother you unless you were hiding something.. but the fact that he did it behind your back makes it bad.. i would be upset|`|nuI7hTGwaa	I would be pissed!  More and more people are keeping a lot of private details hidden away in their cell phones.  I know I wouldn't want anyone to go through mine.|`|qSM3xdejaa	i would be mad. i hate when people go through my stuff with out asking!|`|qSAWWGQ3aa	heck yah i would kill them.|`|3Y1rL5Vfaa	Hell yea i wud be mad!<br>  <br>  That little mofo can ask and use his manners!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  </3|`|nIDyrplHaa	I`d be pretty mad. Its like, do you not trust me or something? It sounds like he`s lying.|`|NG3PU229aa	if he was doing something that innocent why would he hide it? why wouldnt he just ask? i had an abusive bf who that was one of the first warning signs i missed with. he'd start going through my phone when he didnt think i was looking. maybe it wasnt. sounds like it wasnt. if it was and hes bottling up things and he wont talk to you about it he must not be that into you or that trusting/open which isnt good either. id say you have right to be mad, id try to talk it out with him. just remember if he looks away from you while talking or talks really fast and wants to not talk about it hes prolly lying/hiding something. <br>  good luck!

f7W6R9G0aa	Tell her it isn't a good idea and the longer she waits the more special it will be. I think it would be nice if you two sat down and had a talk.

I don't think it's a good idea to start kissing boys so soon. Most people don't start kissing boys in 6th grade and you might regret it when you're older because it won't be as special."<br>  <br>  go ahead and add to it and add your own twist. I think you seriously need to stop her from doing this!|`|CBo23fuOaa	she is a Little to young, but i know she wont listen. tell her to be its girlfriend, well like a friend or if she wants what ever. but when she is like friends with him tell her that she has to be more closer and the more faster the more " quicker she will "kiss him" <br>  <br>  hope this helps ! ??|`|b0jxIc2yaa	if she likes him i would let her cause if she regrets it later than that will be her problem. but i no how you feel cause i have a little sister too and thankfully she still thinks boys are icky!!lol!! but she is still in 5th grade. also i wouldnt no wat to tell her my little sister either!|`|bLkwvo7jaa	let her, its not sex.. just a kiss. <br>  plus 6 grade is old enough for a kiss, one more year and she's in middle school but the more you fight it the more she is gonna wanta.|`|2Mu7ZcpDaa	Well that's sorta young to be dating..<br>  It's probably not that serious, tell her she can if she wants but she'll probably regret it if your parents find out.<br>  She's got a lifetime ahead of her, tell her to wait out a year or two :)|`|wFi2nxTkaa	just tell her to take it easy.because kissing can lead to other things (UNEXPECT THINGS) and i hope she know the boy well enough to do that..............|`|vi7kxIfAaa	Tell her to go for it.|`|rVPT2tx1aa	tell her the importance of a first kiss. tell her not to waste it on just anyone because she is excited to be getting one. did you have a bad first kiss? if so, use it as an example. whatever you do, do not tell her she is too young. because that will just make her want to do it more.|`|ooRxjLXcaa	whats is so bad about that?

b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	Let me guess, your friends are the ones telling you that you're flirting? they probably don't even know what it is either. It's a manner of acting, speaking and looking at someone...|`|w7sReKuLaa	flirting comes natural to everyone.. its nothing you try to do or you'll end up looking fake... its about showing interest in that person.. just pick around with them.. when your 11 poking them and stuff is good ha jus have fun.. he'll get the point.. and ignore your friends because they're probably jealous|`|0dMp7A3aaa	Well... to answer your question, an 11 year old shouldn't even worry about flirting right now.

NG3PU229aa	it personally sounds to me like he definately at least sees you as a friend. hes probably wondering if his feelings could change too by talking to you so much and joking a bit and it sounds like things are going in that direction for sure. he could be trying to get to know you better to see if maybe he likes you or maybe he does like you already and hes trying to decide if you like him. either way it sounds like its going in that direction so if you like him too keep it up and see where it takes you!|`|w7sReKuLaa	it seems like he likes you. he may have told your friend that because he knew it would get back to you and he wasn't sure you saw him as more than a friend.. make him see that you like him.. you may be surprised what happens :)|`|XSxZ3JN8aa	OMg , <br>  It looks so much like he like you gurl ,<br>  guys theese days are jerks and idiots ( most )<br>  and it seems like you got a good one , <br>  :) <3<br>  GoOdLuCkKk!|`|N7wxFTcYaa	well u know.. as a guy, i don't just walk any girl to her classes. if i do that, it means i like her.<br>  <br>  nuff said|`|rPpdRzzSaa	I think he likes you!!!<br>  <br>  ask him out.|`|fecUjSr1aa	The question is ... are you interested in him?<br>  <br>  him telling his friend that he sees you as a friend could be a "self-denial" thingie among boys not wanting to let the public know about his feelings about you. don't construe this as bad because, he may also be thinking about your reputation (as you may not like the idea). this is out of respect to you.<br>  <br>  now that is the "mystery" side. what about you side? from all indications, he seems to be a nice guy and takes interest in you like "always laughing, walking together and complimenting" .. the best indication i see is when you said he'd take you to your classroom even if he might be late ... that to me, is an indication of self-sacrifice - you know what i mean?<br>  <br>  i say, he's got his eyes on you but still waiting to see if you're worth the "next step" ... my opinion is optimism ... <br>  <br>  hope that helps you out ...|`|aM2JDDWgaa	well by what you've said it sounds like he really likes you and all. he probably just said that he didn't really like you as more than a friend cause he didnt wanna embarrass himself in case you didnt like him.<br>  <br>  help me pleaseeee<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmIXuO0hGe1QEVB_ZxWpJBXD7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090227161024AAQKVV8">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|u1qgyGFNaa	dont find out through his friend ask him yourself.im not tryig to sound mean or anything i mean itll be clearer and you wont be thinking about it too much if you found out through him.by the way you tell it it sounds like you have a crush on him but youre a little shy.|`|sHrtX4pvaa	He definately does.

But this time if you chose army boy you better make sure that is what you want and you also have to think of your children and your now husband. Hope this helps you out you have a lot to think about.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	I think you should start being a good wife and turn down expensive bribery gifts from men that aren't your husband.  You made the decision to marry your husband.  You promised him you would be faithful, through good and bad times, and suddenly you're thinking of having an affair?  Honestly, this is messed up.  <br>  <br>  Not once did you mention what kind of bond you have with your husband, all you did was gush about some other man.  I feel sorry for your husband.|`|Vch9DTraaa	The grass is never greener on the other side.  Do the right thing and cut it off with eagle guy.  There is always a reason for everything, including why you and army guy never made it.  Give the laptop back.  Remember, for richer or for poorer, better or for worse, til death do us part.  Love and honor your husband.|`|iIWwZrvEaa	dont listen to chad. if he wants the benefit of marriage then he would go for any other woman (like his fiance) not just you. i think you guys love each other, but you need to take your time and see how you can get out of the marriage, if the army guy is who you really want.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	there is really no wrong man, but now your a married woman, and if u don't love eagle, divorce him, but don't do it just because army is coming back. should have married army when he asked u, if u loved him so much. and u shouldn't have married eagle when u still had feelings for army.did the ill feelings for eagle have any thing to do with army's appearance in your life again. plus army is engaged, your just setting yourself up for disaster.|`|EMKuBql8aa	First off, as someone who just recently got out of the military...there is ALWAYS a way to communicate, even in basic!! If "army" guy told you that he couldn't, he lied bold face to you. Second, "army" guy only started talking to you again after he joined, my guess is that he wants the benefits of being married (they get a higher pay AND get out of sharing a room with 4 other guys into a military house) <br>  <br>  Stick with the eagle guy. Trust me on this.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Here, let me PROVE that I am right and he lied, this is just off of this site, i can give you official site if you would like, actual gov't sites, it's just faster to do it this way: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AoTRR2qHjGdOe5nx98Pk0bwjzKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090117131054AAsL2C7">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnbHr1jEBGsctvG4rws3dzUjzKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20070115180952AAVQxVg">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ah9O5kdUAiKNkFxbP9L_C8sjzKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20080814074909AAq4zt7">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  You gave your word to your HUSBAND not some other dude.

AA11190264	baby girl, he's just playing with you. a real guy wouldn't talk behind your back. if he likes you then he should man up. keep ignoring him. give him the "what's your problem" look.
oOD3dYaNaa	Just go up to her and say "Hey! What's up?" Even saying that could be the start of something amazing. =]<br>  Then just keep the conversation going from there. Ask her questions that don't have a yes or no answer, because that'll keep her talking to you. Like "So how's your day?" and stuff like that. She'll think you're nice and sweet.|`|Ek5ZjYmhaa	go up to her and say hi. try starting a conversation about what sports she likes or what she likes to do. once you start on one thing then you can go into a deeper conversation about other things. hope this helps(:|`|MAsnWWycaa	Just ask her how her weekend was, or if she has any big plans, ask her about local events, music she likes, things like that.|`|81MgVTicaa	compliment her hair and clothes.|`|AA11461524	what are you doing?<br>  how's life?<br>  how are the kids? (just kidding, just to see if she freaks or goes w/ it you kno)<br>  what are you doing this weekend?|`|adNnf6Ppaa	hey how are you?|`|fN23bHi0aa	Start with "hi"|`|3WKdKir8aa	U: Hey...<br>  Her: Hii!<br>  U:What's up?<br>  Her: Nm... U?<br>  U: Nm either. Wasn't the homework boring tonight?<br>  <br>  <br>  And she'll talk to you. :D It'll start from there.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	hurt people hurt others. depending on the reason for the divorce, and maybe she wasn't the one who wanted it, i would say she is angry with u, and maybe communicating with u causes her pain. the only thing u can do is take her back to court, but if you have to have an attorney it can cost thousands, and still the outcome may not be the way u want it. sounds as if she is punishing u for something, and wrong as it is, she;s using the kids to get back at u.|`|bO2rzfISaa	You sound like such an innocent victim, but you've probably given her a reason to behave this way.<br>  <br>  You can go back to court or you can persuade her to your side. Those are really the only options. If you go back to court she going to say you didn't call or she accidentally missed the calls, etc. I doubt it's worth the time and money.<br>  <br>  Make the most of the time you have with them and think about why she's this mad.|`|1HfLkTrdaa	Maybe you are reaping what you sowed.  Don't play so innocent. If a person is doing what your ex-wife is doing, there's usually a valid reason.  So be honest with yourself.|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	She is happy now and don't want be with you, and dont love you anymore well. sorry for you! you are an azzhole! learn lesson for yourself and better to another new woman! Thats your LOSS. <br>  <br>  She tired of your S H I T. lmaooooo!|`|PCBQbQmraa	You can go back to the courts and have these things appealed.|`|2dd5ead8a0ebfd17db4114329eae540caa	life is to short, don't trip let her act the way she feels. You just continue to be a good father to those kids.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	If she is in violation of any of your court-ordered visitation, you need to report it. If you would like more time with your children, you need to go back to court to modify your visitation. Be careful that you are not calling too often even though she is not answering the phone because that could be seen as harassment.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|jfzhFtMVaa	If these things are in the decree file a contempt charge on her. Call your circuit clerk or visit a lawyer.|`|SHARt1k3aa	You must have done something to hurt her really bad and she is using the children out of anger.  It's not fair to the kids at all.  It takes a big person to put their own feelings aside for the benefit of their child, even if they were hurt.  Most people find this hard to do.  It sounds like she is cooperating as far as the custody Agreement goes, so I don't think there is much you can do.  You might want to take her back to court to get more vitiation rights, but that's about it.  At least until she cools down.  She may loosen up after she has heeled.  I commend you for wanting to be a good father, good job.  People need to separate them self from the situation.  The kids are the most important thing.  They need both parents in their lives regardless of how bad of a husband or wife they were,they can still be good parents.
Gov7TxOLaa	well...1 thing....thanks 4 answering my question!!!<br>  <br>  ok, if u really like him ask your brother first if he would be okay with u dating his friend...<br>  <br>  then ask the guy out...it doesnt really what your brother says...i wouldnt care!!! yeah and if hes really nice 2 u he migh jst wanna be friends...and if he calls u like,,freak or weirdo then he does like u!!! i can seriously understand guys...because i have alot of guy friends...but atleast i have some girl friends...like you!!! hope i helped :) any more quesions....umm...email me: GlitterGirl81020@aim.com|`|ed0955174428e55e7e6205da49319b6eaa	Oh, I know how you feel! I had serious crushes on several of my older brother's friends when I was younger. The only thing you can do is find another guy to start liking and forget about your brother's best friend. I know it's hard, but you have to realize that nothing can come out of this.
n4nOgLToaa	aww! that's soo cute! if you're aren't allowed to ask someone out, you are probably wayyy too young anyways. just talk to her and  just have fun...nothing serious.
5YAe0Vffaa	yeah, you shouldn't do that in a public place. especially at school. not a good idea at all.|`|D1c8cRM4aa	how old are you??? Whatever you decide, you don't want to regret it, so if you don't feel comfortable, its probably a bad idea|`|ojwRgCLqaa	don't do it at school! at least do it somewhere private. if you're going to at least make sure you have a condom and/or birth control pills. i'm thinking you don't really want to get pregnant. be prepared to do it, or don't do it at all. i wouldn't do it either way. but it's not my decision.|`|mYmR5cX5aa	You need to educate yourself on sex and birth control, prior to doing the deed. Talk to your parents to find their attitude on the subject, do your homework and then decide whether it is good or bad. It certainly is not something you need to rush into.|`|2dd5ead8a0ebfd17db4114329eae540caa	Baby I don't know how old you are but I do know that sometimes things happen that you will wish that you where older so take your time.

Being a young lady and having such feelings is normal, yet you are in charge and can control what does and doesn't happen.<br>  All in all think about protection for you both before anything ever happens. When the time is truly right you'll both know it, so please try to keep control over the situation should you both get all heated up. Don't put your self out there like that either, in school wouldn't be a smart place.|`|u2SjiWXCaa	-it depends how old are you?<br>  -how long have you been dating?<br>  -how comfortable you are with eachother<br>  -emotional and physical relationship levels<br>  - whether or not you have condoms& the pill <br>  - whether if you got preganant you'd be okay and have supportive parents<br>  -how serious he is with you.<br>  - how long uve known him.<br>  ^^anyways this list cud go on forever. any more questions just ask : ]]|`|4p6NC3Weaa	It wasn't good to almost do it at your school. I wouldn't do it till your older and talk to your mom about it tell her you wanna talk about it and be open to talking to her. Waiting will be a much better choice in the end.|`|ASEI0Sj6aa	i think things like that should be in your privacy <br>  not public places like school<br>  sure you could be getting in a moment but you<br>  should always think about what could be the <br>  consequences...if it turns out that you think it<br>  wouldnt hurt you in NO WAY then go see what <br>  happens|`|Vrk8QJLxaa	Its not a bad thing, just as long as the both of you are ready for this huge step in your relationship.<br>  <br>  NEVER! do it at school. my friend got expelled for this.<br>  <br>  do it in a nice quiet comfy area. preferably on a couch or bed :]|`|5Fr3U3hhaa	jajaj hell yeah.. i mean i always say the best time to have sex is make up sex and if you have that rush inside you that your gonna get caught.. jajaj i love that and yeah always use a condom|`|CSyBGcLYaa	people have sex.it's a normal thing,just becareful though ,use a condom.|`|UCUU22dcaa	Yeah not at school do it at home, I mean the car is better but still you get what I mean.<br>  Privacy! :D|`|7VOJZREhaa	don't think much nobody thinks before doing it...but everybody will put comment on this.....that's not fair..|`|QIvzmKZuaa	no it's not a bad thing at all|`|UPltmBGSaa	hahahaha how old are you?<br>  and um... doing it at school is trashy. wait till you get to you or his house.|`|1quhvD4laa	if your under age you just need to be careful cause you dont want to be raising a kid at 16.|`|Va9KmJYyaa	no. you could get pregnant, get a STD, or he'll just dump you. What if you got caught?|`|ajAOK1mpaa	well it depends alot on ur personal values...are u a christian cuz thts a sin btw
0q5Z5zxIaa	hey, calm down.. that doesn't mean it was your only chance. i was in a similar situation with the guy i like, i refused to tell him who i like when he said he'd tell me.. but it all worked out a few weeks later.<br>  <br>  my advice is for you to just start talking to him as usual and have fun. life is for living, and sitting around wondering "what if" this, and "what if" that will only make you feel worse. get out there and get talking to him.<br>  <br>  it'll make him see that you're interested in a way. get him to smile and you'll linger in his mind. give it a go, what have you got to lose? you'll never know unless you try!<br>  <br>  hope this helps :) good luck!
C9C9EAyiaa	Sophie, relax, who really cares if your fat or not? Everyone is beautiful in there own way, exept shallow jerks they are ugly little monsters. ;) *yells* WHO OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES I'm not naming any names|`|7KjHEanCaa	I have no way of knowing if you're attractive.|`|oDLdqrJfaa	God Sophie your sooo hot.....( yeah im being real)...........Gimme the Best Answer.|`|wuyjidC0aa	how would i know if i cant see you lol???|`|AA11263103	you fat and ugly|`|aUDVBmZSaa	Your question is not attractive and your attitude isnt, that's all I know about you.
RHIJ6OPQaa	just be cool and make sure she sees that you're looking at her and go up to her and play it smooth, just be like hey whats up..can i get your msn? or something like that lol but really just be yourself and dont seem desperate. major turn-off.<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)
0Av5wUdoaa	i think you should just wear hot clothes and have i great personality. and plus don't care what people think there stupid
gRXy66dOaa	then flirt with him|`|ppQbFWbWaa	Is she a nice person?  Does she think for herself?|`|8SRjELNBaa	class, self-respect, and independence.|`|S8wsZBJtaa	a little this a little that... should be charming.. considerate.. a jolly girl.. practical.. a little flirtatious.. somewhat seductive when the mood strikes.. most importantly.. if we can talk to her for hours and hours and then some more hours...  absolutely fantastic.. to bridge gaps... communicate with each other..   many many more things that guys look for.. depending on different personalities..
joA5Rcyzaa	there is no reason<br>  <br>  you break up|`|MHwn4Tlzaa	a2m|`|P10yQmydaa	Maybe you have lost interest in her, and don't want to hurt her. Maybe you think she is cheating on you.

4wWKAGjsaa	It is not your decision to make! All you can do is ask her what it was like when she and he went to XXXXX, which did you prefer that or when we went to YYY.<br>  <br>  Give her the tools to decide, she will either stay with you or she will remember you as the most caring guy who did not force her to choose.
ZZbbFCIFaa	thats average.
W7JbOpbIaa	you are stupid...if you havent gone out with him and ur friend was hanging out with him would u be bothered by it..? no...your just being stupid and selfish and should get counseling...if you are truly over him you wouldnt be bothered by ur friend hanging out with him...or going out for that matter...|`|JLFGfaC3aa	YES. That would bother me a lot.<br>  They're your bestfriend? Well, tell them. They'll understand. If it bothers you then it bothers you. There's no crime in that.
hnc7Epqdaa	Guys defenetely love to flirt. If you want to show him that you are interested flirt a little, this can be exciting because it will be like a play around. for example when you are at the lunch line, make eye contact with him, smile sofly and them push your hair over. And at times go up and birng up a cool conversation about anything you know he likes, he will be amazed to see that you care about him enough to be interested in somtehing he likes. One of the best things you can do is date. tell him your not into a relationship yet, just dating and give each other time to know each other fully. That way you could know if he is worth your time. You can date until you feel ready. Just let him know and arrange a day out. you can search for thousands of ways to flirt and grab a guys attention for good. Check them out. It will all be on the power of flirting, not the words.
WJ1kzLbBaa	He probably thinks you are pretty cute. But if you like him when you exchange glances just give him a wink or smile and see what he does.|`|XcxL6ZMqaa	i think you need to move on to people that you deserve. you deserve ppl that love you for you not someone that loves you sometimes... and then sometimes doesnt. i hope i helped and if i didnt then i hope someone does. bye :)|`|N2NwbvSQaa	Yeah he likes u but sounds like a kid that doesnt know how to act around people he likes.  I would just tell him how u feel and see what happens.
ifgzHzA3aa	Is it "honour" or "honor", "favour" or "favor"?<br>  <br>  The old English spellings of "honour" and "favour" are usually preferred. But again this is a matter of personal choice and should reflect the formality of your invitation and event.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Always use the British spelling for invites as it is more formal.|`|8ygky5g4aa	According to Weddings Beautiful Worldwide's course on invitation etiquette the proper wording is honour.<br>  <br>  Here's the trick, honour should only be used if it is a church ceremony.  If the ceremony takes place elsewhere then Pleasure of your company should be used instead.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|vCZuh3oDaa	If you're American, either spelling is acceptable.<br>  <br>  The phrase, "Request the honor/honour of your presence" however, is only acceptable wording for religious ceremonies in a church.  For all other ceremonies and receptions, you must use, "Request the pleasure of your company."|`|JtEBaOdjaa	If you live in Canada, England or anywhere that uses proper english, add the "u" in for "Honour".  If you live in the US (which is really the only country that takes the 'u's out of all their words. lol), "Honor" would be fine, and probably more acceptable.<br>  <br>  and I'd hope those aren't your real names. I'd have to question the parents who named their kid "james jim" LMAO!|`|AA11065140	It depends on where you're from.  If you're American, then use honor.  If you're British or Australian, use honour.<br>  <br>  The spelling is not an etiquette issue, but instead a language issue.  Oddly, we're all separated by a common language!|`|AA10604036	Assuming you're Americans...<br>  <br>  Either spelling is technically correct so you can go with the one you prefer.<br>  <br>  Because the Brits are always right and proper, most Brides choose the U.  :)<br>  <br>  BTW, in case you didn't know (I didn't).<br>  Etiquette dictates the phrase "the honour of your presence" be reserved for weddings held in houses of worship, while "the pleasure of your company" is used for weddings in other locations.
cDDNG6KGaa	Just tell her how you feel and then she might understand...but if she doesn't then just ask her to at least hang around every once in a while with her husband<that way he doesn't think shes cheating><br>  hope i helped!|`|K4UBu9neaa	there are way too many things wrong with this picture.  1- u r dating but she is still your ex?  if u were serious it seems odd to still refer to her as ur x.<br>  2- some other guy  comes in and she stops paying attention to u?  sounds like shes not committed to u in any way<br>  3-  she is MARRIED, but still seeing u and this other guy?  sounds like shes really selfish in general, and not in a position to care about u in any way...what u should do is find someone with less strings attached!|`|n5r57gPHaa	leave her|`|AA12385489	Move on and forget her.  She is unavailable to you even as a friend.<br>  <br>  Exes do not stay friends.|`|FpjccneWaa	man that is SO crazy CUX she married my advice would be to just get away and fast cuz wen her husband finds (AND HE WILL)it will not be pretty............cuz something similar happened to my cuzin and her boyfriend's wife went syco on her she was stoking her and everything but thank God cuz they moved soo she did not get to my cuzin.....but yea bacc to u GET AWAY AND STAY AWAY DONT LET SAY I TOLD U SO.......|`|F2rI3Juaaa	Run away as fast as you can!|`|dX4Dll0yaa	You leave her alone and move on with your life. You will thank yourself later.|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	fine some one Elas  do date
TPud8FMFaa	just bounce|`|xbISxnmfaa	Girl leave him! He sounds unstable. A stable guy would have been like okay I understand and would slow things down not flip out on you. You should be scared and I think you should RUN like hell!!|`|2dd5ead8a0ebfd17db4114329eae540caa	I don't understand you said he is a great guy but no sparks. Teach him what you need him to know. Then you will have all the sparks you want.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	You're not ready for a serious relationship; otherwise, you wouldn't run at a "great guy".  He's not doing it for you, and good guys (no such thing as a perfect guy) aren't really that hard to find.  You may just have to wait.  He does sound clingy, so you should move on.|`|67EaIAvbaa	ohhh boy...another mommas boy that needs a mother...tell him to kick rocks....if he really cared for you he wouldn't have expectations..tell him you want a man,not an insecure kid.|`|2f4qTCciaa	look i don't want to make you feel nervous, i just want to be your friend for now.|`|AA11108018	When the bad boys want to go out with you yeaaaaa there hot but not what you want.  You got what you want and now your afraid. and you don't feel that spark. If after a month you don't feel anything than you never will  Take out option before it is to late|`|RnqzbRgRaa	Unless you have a real deep connection with him, or you just can't stand even the thought of leaving him, I say find somebody better. He may be the "great guy", but it seems to me he's just not worth it. Some other man in the world is waiting for his fairy tale wife, and you have to find him. He's out there, it's just might not be this one.|`|zpwFnRekaa	It helps if you include your age.<br>  He's not mature. You are right, he's insecure, and that is a turn off. <br>  <br>  He rushed you, and flipped out when you didn't like it.<br>  Thats all on him.|`|UP33GlBwaa	If he loves you and you love him, dont run, be together and dont give a crap what anyone else thinks.  We only live once and life is short my friend.|`|JLFGfaC3aa	How should we know? We don't know him personally.<br>  BUT HONESTLY HE SOUNDS DESPERATE. DUMP HIM.|`|xyW8PsfUaa	I dont think it was meant to be. But if he is a great guy, then u can just be friends. Im sry|`|XXZFf1AYaa	I think you should stay and try to work through whatever is causing you to want to find things wrong with him. I am just like this, and it got so much better when I've actually made an effort to stick around. Deep down it just feels like distrust. Maybe it seems too good to be true, or is so different from what you're used to turning you on, that it seems easy to interpret as "bad", since you've never experienced something like that. <br>  <br>  If you can somehow get through that, and learn to give him the same respect and adoration you gave to past boyfriends, it will probably turn out to be a good relationship, as long as he doesn't really have alot of problems.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to ask him questions when he says something you don't know how to take. Talking about your feelings when they come up could give you reasonable answers or something you can live with, so you don't end up internalizing it all and freaking out that you're making a mistake with this one.|`|yFX0mdOhaa	The "Spark" is something that can come and go... no matter who the person is.  Sometimes you start off with it and it goes away, other times you don't start off with it, but get it later.  <br>  <br>  I think the best way to look at it is as follows:<br>  <br>  Make a list of all of the things you would want in your dream guy... i.e. looks, personality, taste, job, habits... everything you can think of.<br>  <br>  Then make a list of all of the things that are a turn off.  Everything you would find unappealing.<br>  <br>  After you have made your list, take a break for a few minutes and go back to it.  Look through all of your positive qualities, and circle all the one's that you MUST HAVE... the things you can't live without... if yuor person doesn't have one of these qualities, then it is a deal breaker.  Then go over the bad qualities list, and cirlce all of the ones that are deal breakers, that no matter how good the person was otherwise, you could not tolerate that quality.<br>  <br>  See if this person matches all of the circled items on your must have list, and if he has any of the circled items on your deal breaker.  <br>  <br>  If he doesn't fit, then move on.... you deserve to get what you really want.  If he does fit... this doesn't necessarily mean he's the ONE for you, but it means you should probably give it some more time and be sure.

I say dump him. A great relationship, one worthy of the whole 9 yards requires a great personality, love and respect, chemistry and passion. don't settle for some and not all thinking that it should be fine. You'll only be disappointed in the end. I think my husband is extremely attractive, amazing in bed, funny, amazingly kind, very respectful, and fun to hang out with. he's got everything, not just the things that "should" matter most. Enjoy being single now before the husband and kids come. and then when Mr. "friendly romantic kind and hot" comes along let the relationship happen. But don't waste your time on Mr. "insecure decent and dull"
WiIUEObTaa	if your wife was raped and you have the total ignorance to disrespect her in this way, as well as every single woman on this planet. don't even try to find a shrink. this is the sickie st thing imaginable. you wife is wrecked for her life. you are a typical example of to days so called men disrespect women , abuse your wife in time of need. you eat breakfast , and have your bacon and eggs interrupted , how dare her get pounded and raped . of course the person who would benefit from the divorce is your wife. it is the other way around fool you are cheating her of your love and support. did you not take a oath for better or worse, this does not matter, you quit take your ball(plural) or lack of and go home.the divorce should be granted . no question for your wife's sake she sure in hades can do a 100% better than you. dint try the bible nonsense , that makes it even more of a pathetic excuse. you sir are a total disrespectful coward. your wife is strong she will find better. you will be walking around with your bible preaching how you are a victim. plus you will be using up precious Oxygen which is in very short supply. suggest you go on local t v with your story. if you need your 15 seconds of fame this pathetic way. wish you wife a speedy recovery and being a member of the stronger sex which you just proved beyond any doubt. all you will have left is a old news video, and thank your bible for this a squalled apartment , by yourself ,because nasty things will happen if you go outside. your mind is hell burn in it.|`|kbz5S3waaa	how far the sperm travels has nothing to do with whether or not it was enjoyed...|`|RN1wGlWWaa	NO - if your wife was raped it was forced sex and not a choice she made.  But I would strongly advise both of you to get counseling for rape victims and help you deal with this tragic act of violence.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	My intial response to your question was "surely this is a joke.  This guy can't really be this insensative and stupid can he?"<br>  <br>  Having calmed down some, though, I'll treat it as if you are serious and just clueless.  <br>  <br>  It's really very simple.  Imagine if, instead of her, it was you who had been dragged down an alley, beaten and raped.  OK, can you picture that?  Would that be cheating?  If a drunk driver smashes his car into you, should you be arrested for drunk driving?  <br>  <br>  I mean, seriously, man...It's perfectly normal to have a strong emotional reaction to such an attack on your wife, and even to feel some doubts about how she will react.  I mean, will she be afraid to have sex with you now?  Does she view all men as rapists?  Are you hurting her?  Those are perfectly normal reactions, but the difference between those reactions and yours is that yours seem to point to some need to blame her and judge her because of the attack.  So, again, if you were put in prison for some reason, and a gang of men beat you and raped you, would it be cheating on your wife?  Would you have desrved it?  If they raped you, does that make you gay?  <br>  <br>  Think those questions through carefully, and let some empathy for the horror that your wife has lived through bloom in your heart.  OK?<br>  <br>  By the way, I speak from a certain amount of experience about this.  My wife was molested as a child and a teen, and my companion was raped a few months before we met her.  I've had to deal with those reactions, and wondering if the women I love might hate me for the things other men did to them.  But seriously, blaming your wife and thinking she cheated on you is...extremely insensative and foolish.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I have a strong sense that you are nothing more than a troll.

Rape may be heterosexual (involving members of opposite sexes) or homosexual (involving members of the same sex).

The fact that you are even questioning this is awful! I can sympathize that you are also hurting because somebody violated your wife, but for you to question her loyalty is disgusting. If you guys have other problems from the past ok deal with those. But Im sure your wife is suffering from this rape way more than you are. You need to understand that it wasn't enjoyable for her no matter where they found semen!  and it will probably haunt her for years to come.

Drg3bLjUaa	aww hunni, you are just in the "grieving" stage of your relationship...you have lost a big part of your life but please believe me it does get better with time, everything is just so raw as you have a lot of questions wanting to be answered -  the main one being "why?" but trust me whatever the reasons your ex gives you, you will always follow up with why? or "I'll change to make it work"...it sounds to me as though he wants to have his cake and eat it  but at the same time he is making sure you are there waiting for him should he change his mind,  this may sound harsh but as much as you say you love him you dont deserve to be treated like a doormat and if you allow him to treat you in such a way then things will never get better.  A few years ago I had the same thing happen to me and I was utterly devasted,  I gave my heart on a plate and my ex walked away with it,  I couldnt eat, couldnt sleep , couldnt go to work - I could hardly get out of bed in the mornings, if it hadn't been for my friends and family dragging me out who knows what could have happened to me I was so low :(  but I look back now and I cant stand the (obscenity).   sometimes you have to hit rock bottom to get back up on top and when you are back on top you will wonder why you wasted so much time being upset...it may not feel like this at the moment but trust me...  <br>  heres what you should do: organise a girly day out - go get your nails or hair done, buy an outfit & hit the town...make YOU time...if you show him life goes on instead of him KNOWING you are sitting devasted in the house - this will make you feel better too...keep busy...for the next few weeks make sure you have something planned for every night and stick to it, even if its only going for a facial/shopping  - give yourself NO time to be sitting thinking about him - you will find you will probably enjoy your new found freedom!<br>  <br>  chin up sweetie...xxxx|`|HJCWO2FDaa	All i can say is he isnt worth it cause if he really loved ya, he wouldnt treat you like dirt. If he has issues he should talk with you and you both have a sit and discuss things. men do stupid things but one thing i know about men is they need there me time with friends but also has to consider you. If he truly loved you he would be away from you for a while and miss you and beg for you back. I would apreciate yourself and keep your head high excercise and eat well maybe yoga takes stress away. go out with friends at time you need all the friends you have to keep you company while you get over him. hope this helps.|`|iIWwZrvEaa	honey, you neede to calm down first. second, realise that everything happens for a reason. you met him when you were 18, trust me at that time most girls are naive and have this rosy idea of love. but when you start to mature, start thinking about education, your future, it changes the way you see things and you start to question those ideas that you made hastly when you were a carefee teenager. so, it seems that you realised it couldnt work anymore. dont panic, you'll find somebody compartible. all you need to do is focus on the things you do in your life. school, work, hobbies. just get busy and hang out with friends so you have company. and who knows, even date and flirt. dont be hard on yourself.|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	You really want him back?, you should be thankful!..Move on, he doesn`t deserve you or any women around.

Learn something, do something, wasting your life like that sooner or later will turn against you-<br>  All wrong decisions do that in our lives...don`t you think so?-|`|qw7BmBq6aa	You need to start getting out more, and doing things you love.  Invest in a fun hobby, start running, rollerblading, join a sports team like volleyball or curling etc.<br>  <br>  After a while of being seperated from him and getting to know YOU better, you will start to feel relief and happy with life again.  I know the beginning steps to that are hard to do and you don't really want to either, but you will be so happy you did those things for yourself.<br>  <br>  Most people are scared to be alone with themselves, we should all ask why.

You really don't know too much about him.<br>  <br>  And I don't like those open-ended invitations.  What are you supposed to do with that?  He's the guy - if the party's on, he should call you.   Some guys like to give a bunch of vague plans so that they can string along a number of girls at the same time.  He should have a real plan.   <br>  <br>  But my recommendation is that your first date be in a public place.  At his house, with possibly some alcohol, is the wrong time to find out if he's a wack-job.  <br>  <br>  Please be careful!!!!!!   Let him take that first step!|`|xk5XK6CPaa	I dont think it wuld be werid to txt him just dont bring up the party thing rite away, let him bring it up or something and if he doesnt then after a convo be like sooo, r u still having the party tonite, or wht? or something but not right away
WpA7n8Iwaa	You are right to be concerned.  There are definitely signs of something unhealthy going on there.  I don't want to say it, but it does sound like sexual abuse.   Many times girls that are being abused, instead of being afraid of sex, become promiscuous or talk like they are.<br>  <br>  You should definitely talk to her.  Maybe you could say that you saw something on Oprah or Dr. Phil (because they have had programs about this), or researched it on line, and just tell her that you're not sure of anything and you're not accusing her dad, but that she's displaying signs of abuse.  If she says she has, then maybe you and your parents should think of a strategy of how to report this.  Child Protective Services is always on option.  I know it's very hard to do, but for your peace of mind, I'd recommend confronting as soon as possible.|`|c42736cb7fec6cc73ab0f4153c26567eaa	maybe her dad's just needy.  honestly, that doesn't seem like abuse, but i'm not in her situation.  she's getting close to guys that are bad influences because she's looking for attention and doesn't know what she should be looking for in a guy, since her role model SHOULD be her dad.  if you're seriously THAT concerned, talk to her.<br>  <br>  and i think thats what she said jokes are hilarious too, that has nothing to do with it.|`|BGCiqQFgaa	Your friend might not be in an abusive situation, but maybe her dad had some sort of incident in his life causing him to be over-protective. But, she could be, so why don't you talk to her about your home life, and maybe she'll open up and compare. You don't want to have her get father get into trouble if nothing is going on, but if you do find out something is going on, tell a school counselor, your parents, or call a child abuse hotline.|`|Cv2NrRvhaa	maybe her dad is an *** or he is sexual abusing her..u gotta talk to her|`|GdUnVFaxaa	you should probably talk to her to see how things are really going on. Be serious and she'll give you a serious answer. If things aren't that bad and he's not beating her to the ground or doing anything inappropriate to her then my suggestion would be that nothing can really be done until she turns of age to leave on her own. It is legal to leave at 18 but possible to leave one's parents at 16 with the help of the law and considerable evidence of abuse.
XFGmmF90aa	We can't tell you what to do, you'll get people who agree with you and who disagree.

But if you don't want to be her friend because of that, it's your choice.|`|tbwp9Ko8aa	It's up to her if she wants to or not.<br>  You have to decide between a religion and a friend.<br>  Just because of one reason you shouldn't not be her friend.|`|MvpeMqZgaa	Personally, I don't think weed is that bad (do some research, I am not reccomending it in any way though) and it's a persons own choice to use it or not. I think you can give her your inputs and opinions, but you can't make choices for her. If she still continues and you don't feel comfortable with it, then make some new frineds to hang out so you don't have to be involved with that. However just take it easy with her, because the interrogating and criticizing of her will only push you both apart and make others view you differently if you take the whole thing overbaord.|`|c42736cb7fec6cc73ab0f4153c26567eaa	coming from a sixteen year old that recently ditched most of her friends because they were drinking, smoking and taking meds, i think you did the right thing by telling her you were mad.  BUT, i don't think you should have freaked out on her like you did.  it's her choice, and you can try to guide her in her ways, but in the end it's completely up to her.  she's doing bad stuff, i agree.  it's illegal for a reason.  i would have told her what i think about her smoking pot, and told her that i can't be friends with her while she was doing what she was doing, like you did.  now, i have friends that smoke, and i have friends who drink.  but i don't have friends that lie to me about it or who let it get out of control.  i don't think it's a huge deal unless they start losing their grades, friends or relationships with family.  i prefer to hang out with people who don't need alcohol or pot to have a good time.  i can see why you would too.

Nv3eQenUaa	Moms always care.  Even if they are drug addicts.   If she didn't care she simply wouldn't be there at all.    Of course you are feeling hurt.   She made some hard choices in her life that effected you and your family.    Now is the time to forgive.   The time to start over.    Let Jesus be your example and starting point here.   Let him be your path and guide here.   He says to forgive those who hurt us.   Turn the other cheek to those who hate us.    So why not do that.   Being unforgiving does no one any good. It only hurts you.   It only hurts them.   It only leaves walls. Now is the time to knock down those walls.   And Jesus gives you the power to knock down the walls by forgiving you.    All you have to do is accept it, sincerely, contritely and honestly.    Forgive and you will be forgiven-- very simple, true and honest.    It comes from the heart of some one who knows your pain and never lies and is never fake.   So accept his forgiveness.   His salvation.   His peace and love.   He shows how to do it by doing it himself.   So forgive yourself-- give it all to Jesus.    Let him take all the pain and hurt you feel towards your mom so you can be free to love her without all the guilt.  So she can do the same.    Jesus is there for her too.    Talk and pray together.    Let the reconciliation and healing flow down on you like sunshine-- God's great gift to you, your mother and the world.     <br>  <br>  Dear Lord let these hurting and anguished souls accept the gift of your forgiveness, salvation and love.   Let them be free to be a family and find their rightful path as mother and daughter and believers in your way.   Jesus grant them this.   Amen.   <br>  <br>  ?

Sometimes if you talk about things that seem so huge...then they don't feel that way so much anymore. I will be so honored to pray for you...<br>      Dear Father in Heaven....I am bringing Athena before you today. She needs your help to cope with what is happening to her now and in the past. She needs forgiveness to be given her for her mom so that it won't continue to eat at her. Please help her to see her mother like Jesus does and please put love in her heart for her mother. It would be impossible for her to do that without your help. I thank you that Athena has stopped cutting herself as this is way to cope with the pain inside but is not healthy. I ask that you will touch Athena in a very special way today. Please give her your strength and help her put her trust in you. Please send the holy angels to protect and comfort her. I ask that you will help her find someone she can trust to talk with. I thank you for answering my prayer that I pray in JESUS' name.....amen!<br>  <br>  <br>                             ?

I dont believe that your mother should bring you in on her relationship with your father in this way. I think its not fair on you. I wonder is your mother a bit dramatic/attention seeking/ slightly hysterical? I think she is wrong to say such things to you in this way. You know something else that occured to me is that she is trying to get you 'on side' in her drama...dont buy into it is my advice..for anyone, dont buy into others dramas and in this instance when your mother is casting aspersions on your father you could take the stance of being annoyed with her. He is your father, always will be and your relationship with him is separate to hers and she is being an irresponsible parent I believe, regardless of your age, by affecting how you see your father in a negative light. Its unfair on you. I wonder do you and your Mom have a co-dependant relationship? I wonder this due to her boundary crossing. I think you need to protect yourself a bit more from what she says to you. How controlling and manipulative is she?

XmJZkFuMaa	Yup.  At least where I live, until the teen is an adult at 18, the paycheck can be wired to the parent's account.  As for who earns what, that's simple enough, mom can look at her billing account and it will list where the money was put in and how much.  Then you know how much one person contributed.   <br>  <br>  The question of should they comes up.  Personally... I'm for only allowing a teen 10-25% of what they're making, depending on what they're making.  The rest being put away where they can't touch it.  In the real world, when you move out, you're lucky to ever get that much from a paycheck and it makes me wince when I see teens spending what they earn since it tends to make them more prone to use credit cards when they are on their own (used to spending.)  Depending on the situation of the family, the money put aside should either be used to help support the family, put into a savings for the teen when they are in college, or something the parent and teen can agree on (such as a car, motorcycle, etc.)<br>  <br>  Add:  I know some families that need the money from the teen's income to help out with bills and family expenses.  Sucks?  Yes, big time.  And I would hope that parents do their best not to do this.  I'd be against exploiting this.  But, I know families who don't have a choice.  <br>  <br>  And then I know some cultures where until the teen moves out on their own, their money is considered the family's money, just like the father's money is considered the family's money, the mother's money is considered the family's money, etc.  If you live in the house, your money goes into the family pot, then bills, living expenses, etc are from that pot, and spending money for the workers comes last.  <br>  <br>  My plan for my own kids is they keep 10-25% (depends on what they're making) and the rest goes into savings and the like for them to have later.  But I can't condemn families who might keep the money to use themselves.|`|ScHW4842aa	Tell her to go to the bank and open up her own account. <br>  <br>  And give that to the employers. <br>  <br>  Also - tell her to quit her job and not work like a slave.|`|MZbQ5MPdaa	Unfortunately I think her parents can do this. As a parent,I can't imagine why they are keeping her money unless they are investing it and want to surprise her someday when she gets out on her own. How nice when she is 21 or so, if her parents give her a check or stocks as a surprise for a down payment on a house or a car or better yet, if it goes to a college fund! College fund is the best thing they can do for their daughter.<br>  Now, on the other hand, if they are using her money for bills etc. then she really needs to talk to them.If I was young and my parents kept the money and told me it was for family bills etc. I would tell my parents"fine, I'll start paying a certain amount of money(whatever she and her parents decide) for room and board. I need the rest of my money since I'm working for it.and want to plan for my future.<br>  Or, she can tell her parents"I would like to have my money from work and invest it in something for college."have your friend look into a saving account that yields interest,or a CD.<br>  IT will not only let her parents know she is serious about college but IF they are spending her money on family bills, it might shame them into realizing she needs to plan for her future.|`|AA10423186	just  ask    mom|`|d07861561c1ae1f3be24fc58fcebdcf5aa	i think the 17 yr old can get her own account|`|0TuWYaneaa	Until she's 18 I'm afraid so.|`|EIxFvhYTaa	Good question! You can tell how much you are getting paid by your check stub.. it will show how much was deposited into her mom's account. No, her mom is not allowed to this by law. I don't see how she would be able to prove that she didn't get a hold of the money, even if the money went in the bank, all her mom has to say is that her daughter spend it... <br>  Wells Fargo Bank lets 16 yr olds open a checkings account. But I am not sure if it is like that everywhere. I believe Bank of America does the same. <br>  Only other option would be for your friend to request getting a paper check so she can cash it  for example at Walmart. Or She can get a prepaid card, at Walgreens or Walmart and set up direct deposit to the card that would be under her name...<br>  Hope this helps :)
klcqgST9aa	My very best friend is a boy, and I too have a boyfriend, and the three of us had a hard time adjusting to one another once I started dating my boyfriend. <br>  <br>  My best friend Andrew and I have been besties for like, 5 years. We're closer than anyone possible, and I love him as a friend. The thing about best friends that are opposite sexes, is that there's always a point in time where one has feelings for the other. He's had feelings for me a number of times, even asked me out and recieved my decline. I think Andrew and I are closer than you and your best friend, as yours doesn't treat you well, but, maybe not. The thing is, Andrew was a little jealous after I started dating my boyfriend. But, whenever he does like me, he has to supress him emotions because he knows I'm taken, and he'd rather have me as a friend for life than a girlfriend for a few months.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend had a rough time adjusting to Andrew. Andrew and I used to hang out every weekend or more, and my boy was really jealous for a time, when I talked about him or anything. Over time, my boyfriend has become closer to me than my best friend, and has in fact become my best friend. This could happen to you too. <br>  <br>  Now, I still love Andrew, but in a different way. He's my silly brother kind of love, the one who throws paint at me and such. I love my boyfriend a lot more deeply and romantically, I trust him more than anything, and I'd put myself before him. Two very different loves, for the two most important people in my life. <br>  <br>  Keep both of them around, it just takes time.|`|su37vnIXaa	your lucky|`|QvcJVoE2aa	drop the zero get with the hero|`|BZIscz2Qaa	Do what u feel is right.  It sounds like u love ur current bf, and u should stay where ur at.|`|R1oSxvyXaa	you love your best friendd<3|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	Sorry you didn't mention whether or not your best friend likes you. Do you know if he does? If you don't know, then I wouldn't risk losing a great guy. If you know he does like you...then you have a big decision to make. You can either choose the guy that treats you well and cares for you, or the guy that is your best friend. If I were you, I would stay with your boyfriend and keep the best friend. If things don't work out between you and your best friend, then you stand the chance of permanently ruining your relationship. Besides, your boyfriend sounds like a nice guy.|`|bdiSM1UXaa	If you're considering to break up with your boyfriend for another man even though you are still in the endorphins phase of the relationship, maybe you're not meant to be together after all. <br>  <br>    General rule is that the main reason of dating someone should be because you like his/her personality. And them liking you back, treating you great should all come after that. First, you should worry about who you like or love. In this case, if you love your best friend more and are more attracted to him, you should date him and give it a shot.|`|AA12380526	I would stick with the boyfriend.  Although you and the best friend fight.  The point is, YOU GUYS FIGHT.  Who would want to have a boyfriend you fight with?  If he is your best friend and you fight, make up and get closer, he seems more like family, than someone you consider a boyfriend.  Plus, if he fights with you and isn't always nice to you, he cares about you, but he probably doesn't have romantic feelings for you.  You probably annoy him like a sister.|`|NbmnWwqEaa	Stay with the one you made a promise too ... and treats you well. Apparently, he doesn't want a "relationship" and you do and you have one. It would be unfair to the one you are with.<br>  <br>  The best friend may not leave your mind . . . doesn't mean he'd be a good boyfriend, though. Spend less time with him and focus on building and sustaining a healthy relationship with the man you chose.<br>  <br>  Then, if it ends with your boyfriend in time . . .and you're still free and best friend is still free . . .you can try dating.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, keep your integrity and stay with the boyfriend.|`|CNdoV899aa	He might maybe want a relationship but don't want to tell you that he really does bc ur dating this other guy. but if this guy is treating you right then i say you stay with the boyfriend and plus if ur bestfriend is a guy. you dont really want to have a relationship with him bc if u were to break up with him things would never be the same.|`|FwZus5tbaa	if you get the answer , please let me know. Because I am in the boys situation except I treat her as a Goddes and am so good to her....but no luck...but i do know you feelings...my advice TALK TO HIM. cause if he is like me he prays for it. -good luck|`|ifvkj0Hbaa	a friend can be sooo close to someone, my best friend he always has my back if i have problems with my GF and my best girl friend is always ready to step in...<br>  point is that a friend can say allot of stupid things, he can even flirt with ya.<br>  stick with you BF|`|gX40pgLyaa	Don't go with the other guy stay with your bf|`|ePKbnKifaa	follow your heart, your best friend seems to be the perfect one for you, he has the balance of happy or sorrow he is challenging yet agree able, there is no need for counter arguments and rebuttals<br>  you talk to him about every thing that does not seem awkward, I'm guessing that he would treat you as a women not as some other thing to pass the time, the fights between you and him make you stronger and he seems like your match, its not a risk do it, im sure he would accept, a girl so in dept with her personality towards him.|`|YFs3fowHaa	If it was me, I suggest that you go with your best friend. He probably has feelings for you but doesn't express them because you have a boyfriend. If you still think about your friend, then there must be something there between you & him. Your boyfriend doesn't want a relationship? Then, he isn't your boyfriend but a friend with benefits. You should give your best friend a shot and see how he is. If he treats you right; If he has your back. Or maybe you should just date both; That way, you don't regret anything...haha. But just do whatever your heart tells you.|`|fB0J3hztaa	Don't risk it. Keep your best friend and your boyfriend. Maybe later if  your best friend really seems to want a relationship and you think you should go for it go ahead. But right now I'd just be happy with what there is and see what happens.|`|YAj3arMyaa	If you don't like your current boyfriend...nothing is working out. Dump him, go for gold. and such, or you will be stuck with a 0% chance of sucess. You have a 50% chance of sucess if you try and 50% of failure. Do what you must.|`|dgzbj9ujaa	You should stay with your boyfriend. <br>  Think about it.<br>  If you gave up your boyfriend, but things didn't work out with your friend.<br>  You would have ruined your relationship with your friend and messed things up with your X.|`|23cfdf88968fe70e24be5862736df9b1aa	Stay with the way things are don't screw it up|`|jJwuMTSqaa	Stay where you are at. You might mess up a really good thing that you can not get back. Besides, if you were your BF, would you want the same to happen to you?
EMKuBql8aa	First, there is a reason why lie detector tests are not immiscible in court. it is because they are not always accurate so even if she did take it, the results could be wrong.<br>  <br>  Second, I think you guys need some counseling. Obviously you all have trust issues and what she did wasn't right. get some professional help, don't rely on something that might be inaccurate.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	No I wouldn't take a lie detector test for crying out loud. <br>  <br>  If I were you I would learn to use paragraphs though. it makes things like this much easier to read and gets you more and better answers.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I think you are wrong for asking that of him. I mean you had him swear on his kids and family, that alone was pretty low. If I were him, I would cheat on you now just so you would have a reason to carry on acting like this. That's probaly why he had the profile to start with, cause he's tired of your nagging and dwelling.|`|an1EMiFkaa	Just leave. Either way there is no trust.|`|GYoNyoWtaa	yeah|`|WvOvoxLxaa	the test should be taken, questions should be answered, and then you move on. If you need counseling to help gain the trust back  then both should be willing to do it, if they want the marriage to work out.  Once it is all out in the open it has to be dropped or it will never work out.   Most men don't cheat for sex, they cheat to feel important  to someone. So think about how couples take advantage of  each other and don't give each other the respect that is due the person you love.|`|IfOTZhQyaa	I would not take the test. You don't trust his word why should he trust yours. It's all about trust. He came clean to you he admitted his mistake. You forgave him and now you want to take it back and say I don't forgive you. How can he trust you if you go back on your word. Lets not belittle his error in all this but don't make one yourself. Two wrongs don't make a right.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	The ONLY reason a spouse would say no to a lie detector test, is because they haven't told you the truth yet, and know they're busted once they strap that machine on.<br>  <br>  Anyone who was innocent wouldn't refuse.|`|ol5kbCydaa	i would not take the test regardless ...  You said you will move on and start fresh. Then move on, and leave everything behind.... Where would you even take a test like that just because you want to?!|`|xdOgQPEkaa	if your "start fresh" arent you supposed to leave the past in the past?<br>  <br>  move on. stop obsessing over it.|`|ze7xiJwTaa	If I wasn't lying, I would take it. If your spouse refuses then I would be suspicious. He (or she) is the one who betrayed your trust in the first place. Time to show proof I say..

Here is the merchandise mail order information:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://allears.net/tp/mailorder.htm" rel="nofollow">http://allears.net/tp/mailorder.htm</a><br>  <br>  replace the item|`|9bdEPcWIaa	Tell your parents about this, they could probably help by going online disney stores to get one just like it.  Pay your parents back by doing chores.|`|fs8wMQLFaa	Share a sentimental item of yours that she likes. Be extra-sweet to her. And most of all, apologize. <br>  Good luck, <br>  Hugs Smiley
LoIhwvo9aa	ok well first of all she likes you: this is really clear! since she likes you this is gonna be a little easier but your still gonna be nervous. its also gonna be easier cause u guys are friends so here's what you d: you could 1)  invite her over your house to have her help you study for a test or work on a project for whatever class you have 6th period 2) invite her to go out to see a movie make it a romantic comedy or a horror movie that way if she gets scared you'll be there to protect her or you could 3) invite her to get some ice cream and just chill. now I bet your wondering "how do I ask her what do I saw" and here's what you say: 1) hey ____I am so freaked out about this test you think you could come over after school to help study? 2) hey _____ have you scene ***movie name***, oh really then maybe we can go this Saturday night or something it'll be fun 3) hey ____ you think you wanna catch a bit or something we could go to  ***enter ice cream parlors name here**** I'm buying? <br>  <br>  this can be done in person, on the phone, text message, or on aim whatever you prefer and trust me hun, she likes you ;-D hope i helped! :-D|`|oOD3dYaNaa	Just ask her "Hey! What's up?" What's the worst she could say? No? Well then she's a weirdo. LOL From then on, just make conversation with her. She'll reply back, cause a normal human being talks back. <br>  But seriously, just make the first move, and think about how great it'll be with her if you go and talk to her. =]|`|xyW8PsfUaa	Just ask her out. do it in ur own way. U will regret it if u dont|`|u1qgyGFNaa	dont get up the clouds yet,you dont know if she feels the same way just because she looks at you and talks to you doesnt mean she feels that way dude,better ask her out before you lose the chance|`|dZ4PiGu3aa	welll, i dont know if she likes u . but thats not the point, u want her to talk to u. so start conversations with her. i think she might be confused because u have been kind of avoiding her because u dont know what to do around her. i think u should just continue talking to her. start giving hints that u like her. like giving her compliments, saying shes beautful, dont say shes sexy... we find that a lil insulting. lol anyways . just talk to her, and give her compliments, you will see if she likes u, depending on how she responds to the compliments u give to her. <br>  hope this helps !<br>  goodd luckk man :)
VgiUGqxtaa	If you wait for him to talk to you, then you're might be waiting all year..<br>  <br>  The next time you both have your "small talk", think of topic that will prolong the convo, but not make it boring. Ask him about what he's into, sports/films/food. <br>  <br>  Get him talking, then from there make your encounters frequent. When you see him, smile/wave/say hi, etc, if you dont have his Im, then ask for it/ his number, show that you're interested in him.<br>  <br>  If things go well and after a few weeks, etc he hasnt made a move, ten maybe you should, ask him out to the movies, etc.|`|uGIzTttsaa	yea write it on his facebook and at school when you see him pass by or something go hey (insert name here) and you should bring up topics to talk about with him|`|poHGEJeraa	talk to him that u like him|`|JigLlBUaaa	I should have been nicer !
4yILMX7raa	she probably does...and just talk to her, and be nice:)|`|k69XBHOBaa	Ask her about herself and just talk.|`|IYgTS1eiaa	Just if u want to be her friend, just next time u see her, walk over, say, hey, and just talk, and ask to go to her house afterschool on tuesday *say this on monday*, then when u go to her house, since this is dereks sister, u can also see derek :)|`|4tDTQOgNaa	I wouldn't approach her or anything. People could be doing something and mean something else. So I would allow her to come to you and announce herself or what not.
VrmlehM2aa	i feel the same way. i only try to be nice to girls and they either are nice to my face then turn around and talk sh!t or they are just snobby and rude to my face. over the years i have found out that the truth is they are jealous of you or they have something in their lives that sucks and are just taking it out on someone else. i know it might sound stupid.. but thats the truth.<br>  <br>  :)|`|vOcxM9Xhaa	It gives them a confidence boost and enables them to feel good at somebody else's expense. It is emotionally immature and should not be tolerated. You will find plenty of friends out there, just look and move on if you do not like what you come across.|`|4yILMX7raa	I competley agree with you! I think it's just that some people are stuck up...don't worry about them! Surround yourself with people that arent stuck up like them!:)|`|AA11596133	How CAN they be better than you if they lack personality and the ability to be nice in return?<br>  <br>  When people snub me, I just feel sorry for them because they have no brains.  Snobs are snobs, and certainly are no better than ANYONE!  Frankly, I really do not CARE what they THINK - their actions speak louder than words!|`|4tDTQOgNaa	One of the things that they may see or assume is that your high and mighty when that probably isn't the case. It's like a competition with females. It's always about who can be better than the next female. Healthy mature thinking females don't compete they just do their own thing.
ZAIBVaKCaa	It sounds to me like he was using you. Some guys try to make friends with a girl and make them feel really comfortable around them, but really all they want is sex or revealing pictures all along. I'm really sorry this happened to you, but my advice is not to pursue the matter anymore. You're either going to get yourself hurt, or just feel worse about yourself. Not all guys do this, of course, but some feel like they can get away with anything. I'm really sorry you had to go through this.|`|LqsqMglraa	Im 37 and I have a friend that just went thru this same thing.  Its not you honey!  Guys have tried for yrs to make a sweet girl like yourself feel all squeeshy inside and feel good about themselves and when they feel this way, the guy goes in for the ORIGINAL IDEA of a boys MIND, SEX! sorry some guys are like this. just dont hold it against us who are not that way.|`|ihX3Jfbiaa	this is a very tough situation. this *guy* was probably trieing to comfort you and then reel you in. he is definetely an online predator. for yourself, stay away from him. dont worry about him. delete him NOW!! Do this for yourself.|`|WxV9P9NQaa	well its quite embaressing once a guy does that he just dont want to remember or deal with it but it will heal over time.|`|RybmvV55aa	Theres really no nicer way to say this than he wanted a ****.|`|s4FEJiNHaa	he feels like u led him on.  Somehow, he got the impression that you'd be into it.  so now he's hurt and embarrassed that he misinterpreted you.|`|1YTmgAc3aa	the guy is only using you to pleasure himself.<br>  my best advice would be this..<br>  ignore him, despite him acting nice to you|`|O0lb4Kcnaa	You didn't do anything.  He wasn't really your friend, he wanted one thing from you.  When you said "no" (congratulations by the way) you weren't worth his time so he moved on.  You're better without him.  You shouldn't be meeting guys over the internet.<br>  <br>  I doubt that he's hurt or embarrassed, or that you led him on.  He's a creep.|`|4tDTQOgNaa	It's nothing you did. It's more about him. You may not understand why he decided to ask you about naked pictures and now has decided to delete and block you. I would say it's all for the best and better for your welfare. I wouldn't even try to contact him for no reason.|`|4ab39422c7923ec245fd8bc42df199c9aa	Its probably a self defense measure right now. He went too far with that huge leap forward and now he doesn't know what to do. He got rejected and right now he is trying to retaliate. Sorry kid :p theres not much you can do right now|`|AA11356977	It may have been a freind of his messing with you. But if it was him... good for you. Hes a jerk I wouldnt feel bad at all that hes shut me out. I wouldnt want anything to do with the ***.|`|b8da35b938415f969fd9ae1cb8838ec8aa	you removed your myspace link. lol. I guess those internet creeps are making more closed. <br>  Any way for the chatting stuff. Just forget about it. We as a society have not yet transcended to the point where we would be able to have Real Friends only through exchange of messages on the internet. Any sort of conversations, even remotely deep, through a person online, might not mean anything. There's always that possibility.|`|VrmlehM2aa	this is how one of my good friends was and it really upsetted me.<br>  i talked to him a little later on and he just told me that he wasnt thinking with his brain, but more so his mind in his pants.<br>  <br>  seems to me he wanted sex or anything along those lines..<br>  sorry to say :/<br>  but i think you should deffinetly talk to him. if he refuses to talk to you for a while just because he didnt get what he wanted means that he is not a good friend at all.<br>  <br>  <br>  best of luck.|`|osZ5zVEDaa	He was a Jerk and you did nothing wrong. It sounds like he had alterior motives the entire time and when he realized you were not going to do what he wanted he cut you out. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about the Jerk. It is his loss not yours.|`|xC9SIZbGaa	He was probably a pretender, trying to get to know u well enough so you'd expose yourself, someone did that to me on a game once cuz they thought I was a girl the whole time haha! :D<br>  <br>  I doubt he was anything he said he was really|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	sounds like he ran out of **** to jack off with, and has no imagination as well, u can drink my blood anytime, blasting sisters of mercy.<br>  <br>  cya|`|k69XBHOBaa	He's a jerk and a stalker on the internet. Tell someone about it.|`|e4ZxaNxKaa	hes not a good friend, your better off without him|`|JEn54VIpaa	cuzz he hates u happy? now go do ur hw or cut urself
1F6ZnYtXaa	You should buy one of those beer sleeves that keeps your hand from getting cold- cut two small holes in it, and tie a long shoe lace so it becomes almost a  'necklace'. That way she can crutch to the fridge, put your beer in there around her neck, and crutch it over to you.

Maybe you guys are seeing too much of eachother? Maybe he doesnt feel well and is taking it out on you. I would just give him space. Get out of the house go work out or to the mall to shop. I wouldnt feed into his immature game. My husband would get on me about where I left my muddy shoes right by the door mat? He would get on me about every little thing. Just dont worry about it let him have his space.|`|8KOcjy7Daa	he might be looking for a reason to cheat, but just for conversation ask him if he would like to sleep with a friend of yours and just him by his answer.|`|ekr6BBe3aa	It takes TWO to fight.

ztrRs62Daa	I don't think chat is that useful for people you haven't spoken to for a while. Some people really don't like it and so never respond. I'd say your best bet would be to write on his wall.. Just a quick 'hi, how are you?' will suffice, you don't want to seem too desperate for him to talk to you.<br>  <br>  I think writing on his wall is much better than a message because most people will check their wall more than their inbox. I often don't notice for a while if it say I have new stuff in my inbox., whereas I see a wall post very quickly!<br>  <br>  I generally don't write personal notes with my f/r's and when I recieve them I only ever write back if I'm not busy or if I can be bothered to talk to the person..<br>  <br>  So I think you should write on his wall as soon as you read this and then take it from there. If he replies, then that's great and you can comment each other. If he doesn't reply then forget him, at least for a good while. Maybe try poking him in a week if he doesn't reply? But remember, some people don't go on Facebook all that much, so allow for that.|`|3sItMgOIaa	Just send him a message saying "hi, how are you?" I'm not really sure how FB works but I'm going on how Bebo works. I assume they are kind of the same thing where you can leave comments and wait for replys|`|KjKlytKqaa	dont poke him or right on his wall, try chat if he is online, if he doesnt respond then he is a low life and dont bother.|`|Gdg2sBb9aa	who is this guy , like what tyoe of guy... I could answer a lot better... it depends on what kind of background he has

It's called personal growth and I strongly recommend that he give it a try. He could always spend a few weeks with my ex so then he will appreciate someone with a real personality.<br>  <br>  There's no need to complicate it, If it feels right it is, If it doesn't feel right. It isn't.<br>  <br>  Some guys, no matter how hard they try, can never gain the depth of appreciation that you deserve. I'm guessing here, but do you feel 'alone' in your marriage?|`|RBQrgByeaa	He's a superficial jerk. Is he frickin' Burt Reynolds? Looks are important TO HIM. What about what's important TO YOU?<br>  <br>  Geez, Autumn, doesn't it kill you to know that you could do a lot better?|`|2dd5ead8a0ebfd17db4114329eae540caa	I would be happy because some men complain about the way there wife looks.|`|a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	Some people just think that looks are of the utmost of importance. You can't MAKE him change his honest opinion! I believe him one hundred percent. My looks changed and my husband cheated and we're getting a divorce. Looks were and are EVERYTHING to him. I thought, like you thought that he loved me unconditionally for me, but no, not so much at ALL. Kind of shallow, but it is what it is.

I've always looked at it like this. Looks don't last forever, at some point we all get old and grey hair, we also get wrinkles  and put on a little more weight, and some even go bald. So there better be more than just looks, because in the end if you have a crappy personality and character, no one will want you
OyY1x3zSaa	well firstly girls can be hot and still total bitches.... guys dont like to date total bitches... sure we'd sleep with them but not a relationship. what is hot?? it varies but id say 9/10 guys would agree that a pretty face and a body that is in shape would qualify. were not talking supermodel material by any standards but the face would prob be numero uno...<br>  <br>  the guy is prob in2 u by the way, which could be really great, but could also be **** if it doesnt work out.|`|WqW21poqaa	there's more to it then just being attractive.

This question makes me wonder...<br>  <br>  Check out the laws in your state, because in my state, harrassment carries 11 months and 29 days and that would also be the Statute of Limitations.  What you are talking about would be the accused's defense to the charges, but they wouldn't necessarily keep the charges from occurring.|`|kbz5S3waaa	grammar is golden...|`|CQsD09D6aa	What in the world are you trying to say?

That way there is no pressure and you can feel more comfortable- Make sure to invite some of his friends too ( for his comfort) this way you can feel him out in public haning and outside of school.

LlvpERUeaa	why do guys think when girls say something she means other things.....that only works for guys ......SHE MEANS SHE IS NOT INTERESTED IN U AND WANTS TO BE JUST FRIENDS......|`|iXmxbREhaa	She means it when she says, " I just want to be friends". If she liked you romantically, she would have responded differently when you first tried to tell her why you think she is beautiful. You've more or less agreed with her that you were friends only when you said, "duh, I'm just telling you why you're beautiful".  Appreciate her as a friend as she appreciates you. Maybe the situation will change down the road but for now, baring your romantic soul to her will most likely not yield the desired result for you. Good luck!!|`|pPIIOVjsaa	From personal experience I would say she wants to just be friends because she really just wants to be friends.

El amor no es posesion sino compartimiento consiente.<br>  Si creo en el futuro de la relacion de pareja y mas alla, creo que de cuestionar la relacion de pareja, darle la seriedad que merece para crecer en lo individual y tener la capacidad de compartirse uno mismo depende el futuro de la humanidad.<br>  Si no puedes dejar de pelear con tu esposa...puedes exigir que no haya guerras.<br>  Si crees que tu esposa o pareja es una tonta ... puedes mirar a las demas personas como iguales.<br>  Que clase de erotismo puede surgir de una relacion desigual?<br>  Que clase de amor puedes darle a alguien que subestimas o en quien no confias.

EIxFvhYTaa	I can see your point... but i don't think it would happen anytime soon. I agree a guys high school and even college years could be very depressing by their lack of "game". <br>  Instead of opening the brothels in schools, I propose making brothers legal and for them to need a permit to open. like that they can be regulated and maintained as safe as possible.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	No, but turning a silly question into a serious discussion I'd like to say that it would be nice if schools did teach something that people would actually use in life. The major problems that everyone will face in life are;<br>  <br>  1) Money - and the schools don't teach anyone anything useful about handling money, establishing and maintaining credit, how to handle money etc. I suppose they help you get a better job but you still have to learn how money works the hard way.<br>  <br>  2) Relationships - and if you do hear anything about dealing with people in school it'll be something on being sensitive or politically correct or some other crap that does no one any good. What good is it telling most of these kids how to use a condom if they have no clue how to get a girl in the first place?<br>  <br>  3) Trigonometry, Algebra and almost every thing else that we must know to graduate - Oh, wait. That's stuff that 99% of us will never use again, but it's somehow necessary for everyone to learn it. <br>  <br>  I'm not against learning math, science and history. I'm a bit of a nerd and a science and history buff myself. But I recognize that most people aren't helped one bit by it and I think we need to start teaching kids about real life and not just stuff them full of encyclopedic knowledge.<br>  <br>  Also, all you have to do is read here on YA to see that they're not learning the other stuff anyway.|`|EMKuBql8aa	It is illegal you dope.

Don't call him a player, druggie, or whatever. That will make her mad. If she does go out with him and something bad happens, then sorry, but that's her fault. She has to lear her own lessons.

They want to touch it. You tell them it's hot. They don't think it looks hot. You tell them it is hot and they will get hurt. Sometimes the only way people are going to understand the stove is hot is to touch it. I know a lot of people who have told me really good advice and to this day I still wished I listened to them, but I learned from my mistakes. Your friend may just have to do the same. The only other thing you can do is confront her parents with your concerns. Your friend may not like it and may resent you for it but perhaps she'll be more safe.|`|zgvpytABaa	have you tried confronting your friend? Maybe you should talk to her and be really firm.<br>  She might feel like she needs a boy in her life.<br>  <br>  I really don't think that there is a way for her to not see what is going on. I mean... from what you said, there is no way that she hasn't noticed if he is that open about it. She might be insecure.<br>  <br>  Right now she is making really bad choices, and I know it will be very hard, but you might have to distance yourself. You need to stay away. This sounds serious.<br>  Again, how can she be clueless?

It sounds like you didnt get an experienced perceptive therapist. <br>  You need to join a womans support group.It doesnt cost and they can be found through your local CODA shelter or community center or mental health center.

You will meet other women who have been where you are and have rebuilt their lives.<br>  This is important to do no matter what.  <br>  Dont make excuses for what he did.  It is inexcusable.

But it has stopped when my parents divorced when I was 11 (I'm 14). And I use 2 have reoccuring of the physical abuse he use 2 do my brother (his step son) and my mom and the mental abuse he use 2 do 2 me. We had NO counseling @ all, it took time 4 the frequent flashbacks 2 go, but they eventually did. He dnt want 2 wait til eventually, u should go 2 counseling!|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	Dear mumsy,<br>  <br>  I know exactly where you're standing. You're afraid and you're sad at the same time. Afraid to trust him again and he will brake that trust by abusing you when your guards are down and, you're sad cause these events are like a stain on your marriage, how could he do this to your marriage. <br>  <br>  The only way to forget....is to forgive. It won't happened in one day, it will take time. The flashbacks will always be there except they won't be painful anymore as they used to be and you'll be able to love and live with them in the background. <br>  <br>  Him apologizing would be the first step toward a better future. Tell him you need to hear it to find closure. <br>  <br>  It's one of those things that can only go away with time. Like a broken heart or a betrayal. <br>  <br>  Good luck, you can email me anytime. It's been 5 years for me and I still have flashbacks but I found peace with it all and I'm not hurting from them anymore.|`|IvMPh09baa	you said... you still cannot forgive him... so ask yourself this, whats it going to take for you to forgive him?  Seriously... you are stuck in a bad place because you are not making a plan for yourself and setting up goals here.  So... what does he have to do to get your forgiveness??<br>  <br>  Though... I think the real problem here is the lack of trust.  You don't trust him, you don't trust his control and his anger.  So I believe you need to take time to heal and regain trust in him again that he will control his anger and control himself so you are not afraid he will explode like that again.  As far as you regaining trust, well what is it going to take for that to happen?  Would you feel better if he atteneded anger management classes so that at least you know he got some formal training on ways to control himself?  Is it just going to take more time apart?<br>  <br>  what are you on anti-depressants for?  Stop that!  YOu don't need those.<br>  <br>  YOu need to confront your problems right now, you need to tell yourself you are going to find a way through this and you need to make a plan for yourself of what it is going to take to get through this.  what does he need to do, what do you need to do, what is it going to take??|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Go to church and discuss this with the pastor.He can counsel you and won't charge for it and if he does, find another church.The United Pentecostal churches are good.He should apologize to you hon.Next you need to apologize for any crappy things you have done to him as well.<br>  As far as depression goes, with the things you have gone through it is normal.I lost an older sister years ago and that was hard, I also have been divorced once,and that was hard too.However the LORD loves you and you are of great value to HIM.Never forget that,and your baby loves you too and no matter what you will always be "mom".<br>  When you learn to change the way you think ,then your feelings will change too.<br>  As far as forgiving your husband, in GOD'S eyes we all fall short and none of us are really any better than the next, some may be a little dirtier, but in the end we are all dirty.None of us "deserve" GOD'S mercy, yet HE shows it to us anyway.Your husband realizes his behavior was wrong, give him credit for that he seems to be trying to change.If you can not forgive HIM, why should GOD forgive you?

Have you thought that maybe she could feel the same way.. but she just dont what to get hurt like she did last time?? and even if she aint really interested rite now, doesnt mean that she wont later on.. and if you care that much for her then you will wait and see what happens.. and if you want to you can even confront her about it and be like... hey I still like you and I really wish we can start over... and take it slow when you start tryn to get with her agian... and see how that works out.. but I f you dont say anything...do u really want to have the question in the back of your head (if I would have just told her how really felt??)))

If it becomes to the point where they both are touchy-feely with each other, I suggest that you randomly strike up a conversation with your friend about your boyfriend and ask her what she would do if she was in your situation. If the response leads towards her suggesting that you dump your boyfriend, she has some sort of interest in him and you should hold on to him a little longer to see how much more she would insist that you break up with him. Other than that, you need to do what your emotions are telling you.

If sure seems that way and mom is having a hard time letting go.  You got to tell her to cut the strings even though it may hurt her feelings.

If you can't talk to her is there someone else that can?|`|MlCWsBcwaa	Does your mom come and visit you at your place?   Maybe that might help a bit, as well as you visiting her.  You don't need to live in each other's pockets, but clearly she is not doing so well at the moment.  If and when you have kids, then hopefully she will feel needed and be a big help to you and your partner.  Maybe you could invite her down for dinner once or twice a week as well.  Maybe you could go walking for exercise for 30 mins each day and invite her to come along with you, seeing as you live close by.  Also, maybe if you ask her for advice about running a household and little things like that, she can feel a bit more needed and know that you are still important in your life.  If you get stuck for conversation, maybe that is a good thing for fixing that too.  Good luck.|`|zpoRJVneaa	yes, i would suggest not shutting your mom out of your life. so you're married? so, she feels lonely at this time, so be there for her.

Gh0qq0s5aa	I don't think it's stealing.  My son does it to me all the time. If I don't ask where my change is I will never see it. But never once did I consider it stealing.  Now if he took the money from my wallet without asking then he is a thief. <br>  Mom's know how much change they are supposed to get back. Don't even think they are sleeping on that fact. She knows you keep the change and probably feels that you can use a little pocket change.  But do not get carried away.  If she asks for her change then you have to give it up.|`|KVFYJrDJaa	Technically, yes. However, you may have an understanding with her that indicates that you can keep the change for your trouble. But you have to lay the groundwork for that first and it does not sound like you have done that. <br>  <br>  You can think if it this way - If you go to the store and you paid for your $7 worth of groceries and you left without getting your change, there's kind of no way to get that money back. Which means the money was basically stolen from you. <br>  <br>  So, you can ask your mom if you can keep the change, or a reasonable amount, for your trouble or you can give her back all the change, but to conveniently forget to give it back to her is stealing.|`|x9XV2D4Oaa	In a way, yes, you are. But for a long time, you and your parents share the same money, so obviously there's no stealing in that case.<br>  <br>  In conclusion: if you are older (14+) it's stealing, but nothing illegal since you are related. If you still share money with your mom, nothing is wrong.<br>  <br>  :)|`|AA12166274	No because she knows that you have it. She gave you the money to buy for therefore the money was yours when she gave it to you.Then when you purchased the food with your money its your food. If you get change its your change.|`|UK0HFbCyaa	If she told you that the money was yours to spend, but you needed to buy groceries, then the change is probably yours to keep<br>  <br>  If she told you to keep the change, then keep it. If she said she wanted it back, then give it back.<br>  <br>  Ask her if she didn't tell you anything about the change.
0DDgOWxPaa	Seems kinda strange. I would be curious too. To be honest with you...you will not really know till you ask her. You know her best, so you shall know if she is lying when you ask. Good Luck!|`|4wWKAGjsaa	If she has been screwing away, doing escort work or basic whoring.<br>  It is your imagination thinking of the thousands of blokes.<br>  <br>  You have to be honest ask your wife, what happened ( Check the address before though).<br>  You could get a friend to ring her up and blag her for sex and see if she tells you about it.<br>  <br>  then confront her.<br>  If she has been spreading her favours about you have a choice, accept what has happened and rebuild or walk away.|`|BaHAJdDpaa	Hello Fred,<br>  <br>  It will probably bug you until you find out more about it. Instead of questioning your wife, I would find out more about Brad's. If things seem suspicious you probably need to be on the lookout for other suspicious behavior.<br>  <br>  There are signs to look for if you think your spouse is cheating on you. If it was long distance and only once it would be harder to tell than if if was going on now.<br>  <br>  But let's say that she did cheat on you. She might do so again. <br>  Let me share a few tips to look out for in a cheating spouse:<br>  1. They make excuses to be away from home.<br>  2. Unexplained or secretive phone calls.<br>  3. Starts arguments and uses as an excuse to leave the house.<br>  4. Money missing that is unaccounted for.<br>  5. She wants to clean the car before you get in.<br>  6. Too much gas used or radio stations changed.<br>  7. Lack of interest in sex - or wanting to try new techniques.<br>  <br>  These may help you out if you think there's a problem.|`|gpeOH11Daa	Confront her and ask what is going on, or bury the hatchet.  Knowing is better than guessing and wondering. It will eat you away inside. You could just call the number again and ask what agency they are to get some background.  <br>  <br>  Curiosity killed the cat, dont let it wear you down in the process. Make a decision and move forward.|`|Czpfs8RLaa	maybe it was a modeling agency? hmm wierd I know but it could be... and maybe she knows the guy or maybe someone borrowed the phone if you are really worried just casually bring it up and see what she says but whatever you do dont accuse her itll just turn into a fight good luck :)|`|aGEsJkfvaa	I'd call back and see what info I  can get on the company and if that doesn't work just come out and ask her about it.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Could be or she is talking to a modeling agent.She may be checking into a modeling job.<br>  Or seeing some one on the side who works for one.<br>  You need to talk to her.|`|kbz5S3waaa	Just ask, or look it up online with the city she was in..|`|NuvKPl3naa	you have to ask her if you want to know. it may of been a friend who works there. who knows unless you ask.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	It could have been just a text sent to a wrong number.  In fact, your wife may be wondering if you are screwing around behind her back.<br>  <br>  However, if I were you, I'd look into it more.  For example, find a close female friend who is wiling to call that number again to figure out exactly what that agency does.  I will also consider confronting her about the text msg just see how she reacts to it.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that if your wife is so careless and/or clueless to use a communal cell phone, she is bound to be caught sooner or later.|`|AA11447210	If you want to know about it ask. Otherwise, drop it and move on.|`|fN23bHi0aa	She would ask you if it was reversed.   Do a little investigation to make sure that it is what you think it is.

When you have a conversation with somebody, you need to show respect to the other person (if you consider her just a chick, she will feel how you really think about her) and nobody would like to have a conversation with you.<br>  2. You seem very self centered and don't really listen what the other person has to say. LISTEN! There might something you might not really understand what she says, so ask her what she means by this........ She will be glad to explain better and the conversation starts rolling better.<br>  3. When you talk about yourself, try to keep the conversation interested, sometimes maybe even funny. Laugh about some stuff you experienced and people will laugh WITH you. <br>  4. I personally believe that a person who constantly has negative feelings torch the world would be isolated. I don't like to be around people who constantly complain.<br>  5. Try to keep eye-contact. When I talk with people, I always look into their eyes. Sometimes eyes can tell you more than just words. It will show you their feelings and words what they don't even say. This makes you even a better listener.|`|0R345HDiaa	One thing you can do is to actively listen to what she's saying (it's easy to not really be listening because you're concerned with what you'll say when she stops) and then ask a question about something she just said to keep it going.... she may say something that sounds interesting or is in line with your interests and you can keep it going from there.  Good luck!

Ask your Mom if you can talk to her alone. Tell her whats going on in a calm way and how you feel about the situation. Remain calm and show a more mature demeanor. You still may not be able to go to the BBQ but at least she'll see your trying to take a more mature route. When your brother is around, tell him you don't want any drama or fighting. If he ignores you, leave the room.<br>  Hang in there.|`|C0lpFqlHaa	Just go insane. This used to be me, i just went crazy on my parents, like it was nothing you had ever seen before.

You really need to sit down and express your feelings, and if talking, write him an email, send him a text that you have to talk...you have a baby on the way and I can tell you from experience it's tough raising a baby alone.  you have got to talk to your husband some how and soon hopefully this is resolved before your baby arrives|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Ok, I'm a bit confused. You said that he treats you like crap. yet the only thing you really mentioned was that he ignores your comments like they don't mean anything. And to be honest, he has no reason to care about your comments. He's NOT MARRIED TO YOU! I think you are letting your hormones get the best of you, and if you are stubborn headed and want to say it's not your hormone, then perhaps you are naturally just a mean rude angry person. <br>  <br>  Get over youself he doesn't need to bow down at your every word. Heck he doesn't even have to listen to you at all. He's your husbands friend, and he already has a wife.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Pack your things and go.

Your husband's friend is disrespecting your husband by disrespecting you and he defends his friend! Kick his a** to the curb. You are not your husband's mommy nor his friends mommy.|`|IvMPh09baa	does your husband know that he treats you so horribly?? I find it very odd that you are mad at the best friend and not at your husband for not sticking up for you when his friend disrespects you.<br>  <br>  I suggest you re-direct your anger here, if you feel so disrespected by his best friend and you have valid reasons for feeling that way make sure your husband knows this and see's it.  And then if your husband does not stand by your side and stand up for you and the disrespect he is showing you, I would re-evaluate who I married. <br>  <br>  My husband would NEVER allow ANY of his friends to disrespect me.

NG3PU229aa	i dont think your gf would be with you if you werent the one she wanted. she probably thinks your friend is just her friend and trying to be friendly since you guys are friends too. you should try talking to her if she doesnt know your uncomfortable with how is she supposed to change that. and if your "friend" is talking to you about her like that she deserves to know. id want to know if a guy that cheats/lies was talking about how he liked me so i could make sure i wasnt leading him on or anything. and i dont think you have to worry about her still liking him i dont kno too many girls that would date a guy if they were really into a different one and i dont usually admit to an old crush unless thats all it is. id tell your "friend" to back off of your girlfriends and prolly get new friends cuz it doesnt sound like hes a great one and id talk to your girl because shes totally out of the loop and she doesnt have any idea that that stuff bugs you. just make sure you dont sound accusatory make sure you sound concerned and tell her you dont want to lose her and you wanted her to know. it'll make her feel good and then she can do something about it.<br>  good luck!|`|K2ROjaghaa	GET HIM AWAY FROM HER!<br>  He is trying to break you two up and get into her pants. <br>  don't talk to him at all. <br>  Tell your girlfriend to stay away from him also. <br>  if you really love her you'll do this.|`|pMrKkaqXaa	do a tricckk on themmm and find out wat they really do when you go to pracitce. thats the only way u going to find out the truths..... when you so called go to "practice" just miss it for one day and stick arounddd|`|6sGMvug3aa	Well girls could be VERY unclear...

And they probably dont do anything while you are around cause you already know the position and they dont want to give you suspitions...

J7Mmo5Xmaa	You were old enough to make a decent decision when you married him hon.You were not 16 when you got married.You also had some space when you broke up with him and you did not have to reconcile.You obviously do not love this man otherwise you would not be thinking about dumping him for your "guy friend" you are with him because he is "safe".<br>  You are not with him because he is your first choice or your love, it was because you knew he loved you and he was available.You would rather be in this relationship than alone waiting for the right guy.<br>  Next, if you have kids, your responsibility is to them and your husband.So either divorce and do your thing or dump the guy friend before it destroys your marriage.I think you should ask yourself if you really love your husband and if you do, then fix your marriage.|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	Oh If you made a mistake and he make mistake. well try get fresh start over again<br>  <br>  answer mine<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aieq8x9WKlAIAVyxGfvcOpnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227163523AArXxtL">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Drg3bLjUaa	once a cheat always a cheat in my opinion....walk away..dont worry about hurting him, he didnt think of you on the occasions you have mentioned here - guys always say they will do anything to make it work but the fact is the next piece of skirt to show a little interest in him and you will be back to square one...cut your losses and start a fresh...if you cheat on him and tell him you will NEVER hear the end of it..he had his chance and he blew it...go be happy =]|`|Vch9DTraaa	Every one is going to tell you to to divorce or move on, I'm not.  Marriage is important, the grass is never greener on the other side.  You made an agreement to forgive him, and now you need to stand behind that.  I'm not condoning what he did, but making him re-live it over and over again is not right either.  And it sounds to me like your wanting some one to tell you "yeah he did wrong, so go for this other guy"!  Well I say, stick with your husband, he loves you.  Please listen to the video link below, listen with your heart on what unconditional love is.  Make it work!  Stop talking and seeing this other man, all he is doing is defiling your mind and marriage.  Be a good woman and be faithful, not only physically, but emotionally.|`|oo4E4QzJaa	I think you need to give, just because he says those things doesn't mean he is telling you the truth- he is telling you what you want to hear so you stay with him. Also note, he has made mistakes with other girls multiple times, what makes you think he won't keep doing it. You shouldn't feel like giving up on your marriage is wrong- what is wrong is when people believe divorce is bad so they stay miserable for the rest of their lives. You are having second thoughts in your marriage and if you truly love the person, you would never have second thoughts. Therefore I believe your relationship isn't going to work, you should just let go. If he cries you are just going have to let go, don't be mean but you have to be happy. Stick your ground and don't cave in. If you are having problems deciding if you want to stay married, or get divorced write a list of all the pros and cons of your marriage, if there are more cons you get divorced, more pros you stay together. The outcome of your results will tell you what your heart subconsciously wants (I hope that makes sense?). It may always help you realize not to sweat the small things and view your marriage as a whole. Well anyways I hope that helped, I know and hope you will make the right decision in the end. Good Luck :)|`|DlCcFu1eaa	Don't you think it's outrageous of you to put him through the mill for texting some girl when you yourself admit to having a close guy friend that you've pondered cheating with??????? Isn't that the pot calling the kettle black?<br>  <br>  Me thinks you're more than a little narcissistic. Perhaps you should stop looking at your husband's faults and start looking in the mirror.|`|fN23bHi0aa	I think you should start new.  Move on with your life and rediscover yourself.  Good Luck.
AA10145237	Damn and the sad part is that is actually true....well for me it was because i feel i am not ready i met this great guy and i want to take it very slow because i need to know what i want with my life and him...i need to know that i am ready to start a relationship that is nice....i figure us women do it because some are not ready and don't want to mess it up if they do jump in the hear of the hole.....|`|AA10835024	Wait until you're a bit older to start looking for relationships. Good girls do exist, you just have to find them (I found my fiance on MySpace )|`|1816a64fd088fbedf36f65a5fd54e4a0aa	I will STRONGLY urge you to just be patient, because being sweet and honest and caring is going to land you a girl who you can be happy to spend the rest of your life with one day. If you turn into a jerk and aren't being yourself, then the right girl is gonna pass you by.  If a girl doesn't want to be with  you cuz she doesn't know how to handle you being "too good to be true", then you should move on anyways.  I went out with jerks in the past, and that was because I had alot of problems and wasn't confident about the fact that someone may actually love me more me and want to be with me forever.  Now that I am ready to settle down, I wish I could call back all those "really nice guys" and have them give me another chance, and I would appreciate them so much.  Don't change, hang in there.......and be the nice person you are, it will be worth it. Nice guys are the best!|`|3be4c09139c9700519ea33ba97dc019aaa	a warning for you..if you become a jerk the girls will leave you.|`|9845acd18f5d6009488f1bf7c19bf9d2aa	in the world good man does not get a  good women. because they does not know how to express inner them on right way. and they do same stuffs which are not need it in life.that all need to be natural,came just easy and not to much.|`|c0892f300adfb144e663a27ba36c6f98aa	Women do like a man like that but yet men like this also get to emotional to quick and it scares women.

I too was once one of those women who loved a bad boy (for the challenge I suppose).  I am now and forever a "nice guy" lover.  Would NEVER go back to a bad boy.  Too much drama, bulls*((t, and headaches.  <br>  <br>  I am currently with a really, really nice man and YES I deserve him!!!!  All boils down to the woman's self-esteem.  Meet someone who is confident and self-assured and she'll see you are a blessing.|`|AA11948309	well, alot of girls have dated jerks in the past and they may just be afraid of being hurt again....buuuut i can definitly understand y this must frusterate u....but don't worry there r still lots of girls out there that will be able to c u 4 who u truly r!<br>  Goodluck

usj1lyfFaa	Sure it's ok for you to bring up.  It's easy to approach problems in a relationship when you don't do it in an accusing or angry way.  Just let him know that it bugs you.  Although to be honest he may be like some guys where he just doesn't like talking on the phone.  As for the texting thing, he just needs to be more considerate.|`|s8d7gg5Haa	yeah talk to him! <br>  a relationship will only work with too mature people who can talk to each other without arguments!<br>  <br>  but start off by talking about everything because me and my ex didn't and well as soon as we got more comfortable with each other we would argue insted of talk! <br>  <br>  so yeah its impoortant to talk<br>  good luck|`|delicXRHaa	Maybe he's just not into that stuff!

Do you not want to upset him? You have a valid point and should be able to express yourself without fear.

I have dated plenty girls that are like that.  I still would bring it up, but maybe mention it AFTER you two have the talk about where you stand.  Rather than vice versa.

ztrRs62Daa	Okay, wow. I'm feeling really bad for you right now, that is such a harsh thing to do, poor you. However, presumably she didn't rape your ex and therefore he is also partly to blame, which makes him a bit scummy. So the question is, is your new boyfriend more trustworthy and less scummy than the ex? Do you trust him enough to let her talk to him?<br>  <br>  Also, if he doesn't know about her having sex with your ex, I think you should tell him. Tell him you don't like the way she is acting towards him and that's why.<br>  <br>  Out of interest, what did you do when she told you? How did you react to that? I would've been so pissed with her.. And how old is she? I hope she's legal..!<br>  <br>  Sorry about all this, hope things go well with the new boyfriend.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	You have a real problem.|`|ScHW4842aa	your sister has a problem. <br>  If that were my sister, I would have belted her in the face and told her that I would always pretend infront of everyone else, but to me, she was dead now.|`|MlCWsBcwaa	If she is under age, I would tell your parents about the crank calls and other strange things as she is still their responsibility.  Also, tell your boyfriend what is happening.  If she does things like this, he needs to be careful not to be alone with her at all.  You can't be sure what she would do or say.  It sounds like your sister has some problems and/or is seeking attention of some sort and can't be trusted.  Maybe it is a coincidence it is your ex and current boyfriend she targets, or maybe there is something more in it.  In fact, even if she is not at home anymore, I would still talk to your parents about it if you can and let them hear the messages for themselves.  This could get messy.  For her sake, she needs someone to talk to her about what she is doing to others and herself.  Good luck.|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	Oh yea, watch lil sis.  If she did it once she will do it again.|`|X0UtxEUkaa	you should not trust your sister!!!! what a backstabber! that your forced to live with!|`|rSxSV6tfaa	OMG your sister has a problem and so did your ex boyfriend. That is so sister at all. I would kick her ***, i mean she is your LITTLE sister. If she did it once she would do it again, just hopefully you can trust your boyfriend.
RxmiWJq9aa	if he has ur number just text him saying heyy:) or something along those lines.dont keep checkin ur phone and if he doesn't reply dun worry he mite be busy.just dun keep continuosly textin him or he will think ur weird.if he doesn't have ur number and asks who u r just tell him who u r .good luck girl!!|`|G0zOPniRaa	GUYS ARE GAY TEXTING HEHAHEAH.
dmBnnwXvaa	Okay, good for you when you said that friends don't do that to friends! Its true she shouldn't do that to you, would she appreciate it if you went  and kissed the guy that she really likes? HELL NO! haha so make sure you don't back down on something like that especially with your really good friend, because if something does happen between them and you said it was okay it will put your friendship on the rocks because you'll be upset with her!|`|B91DUxNraa	I think that deep down, you still have the hint of a crush on him. It's sort of like seeing your ex-boyfriend go out with another girl - you still feel like you are attached to him in some way. You should make it known to your friend to give it awhile before she gets all lovey with him and if she is a good friend, she will understand. Good luck. :)|`|ZY3RjiRAaa	Okay she's a really bad friend! Don't tell her stuff anymore! I'm serious! Like if shes gonna go and do that **** to you, just forget that *****! <br>  <br>  I mean, she shouldn't try to go after a guy that you just got over! But usually you don't even fully get over the guy. That's just way too soon.|`|mo8OfKjeaa	wow.<br>  was she joking? i do that a lot.<br>  <br>  and if you got over him, you have to accept the fact that others will like him.<br>  <br>  ive had a crush on this guy all of last year, on and off. he was kinda dorky but so funny and great personality. a few months ago, he had a gf, and i still VERY LITTLE like him. i got jealous wishing i could be with him.<br>  <br>  so, in conclusion, if you still have a tiny bit of feeling, go for him, and flirt with him.|`|ww3ukbdVaa	yea, you are kind of being selfish. if you are really over him, then act like it. other girls like him too, stop hogging and spread the love|`|KIX3Hfakaa	omg its like a soap opera :)|`|27IeVZNeaa	that sounds exactly what me and my friend did.  Your not being to<br>  sensitive its a natural reaction. She should be more carelful about what she does because your kinda in a confused, inbetween, hard-to-decide phase|`|O0lb4Kcnaa	To be young again with the drama!  You told her that you didn't really like him anymore.  That put him back on the playing field.|`|y2O1D8q7aa	whats the question?|`|J2gBU0NDaa	Sorry to be so honest, but you sound like you are 15yrs old or younger, if so don't worry, you will grow up soon enough.  If you are older, then you need to grow up.  If you like the guy tell him so or get over him.  We are not talking about a guy you dated for a yr or more, and then broke up. Sure that may take a little time.  But if I am not mistaken you just liked this guy from a far.  So are you saying every guy you have a crush on no one else can like also?  That sounds like you are the one that is full of yourself.  Do you even know what real love is?  Sex feels good. But when someone likes you in spite of your craziness, that feels better.  And I am not talking about you.  I am talking about all of us.  We are all crazy in our own way.  We just have to find someone who accepts our type, and we accept theirs.|`|Z4wmiI37aa	I think she is just really self obsorbed no offense|`|k69XBHOBaa	Just ask him out. If he says no walk away or dis him.|`|E6kJE2x2aa	I would be mad 2 she sounds really stuck up and conceited|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	LOL! Say what?? LOL|`|cm8G7AiCaa	dnt ever let BOYZ come in between ur friendship!!|`|9UQlhzitaa	ok from what i'm reading here is <br>  1) your friend may be just feeling you out .To find out if you are really over him or not.The reason that I say this is because she backed away from dancing with him so fast.Sounds like she wants to see if she can make you jealous.<br>  <br>  2)It sounds to me like you like this guy more than you want to admit, Because  why did you get upset at all if he means nothing to you?<br>  <br>  3)If your girlfriend is that great as she thinks then try to make it happen then if it does not you have bragging rights to bring her ego down a peg and you can ask the boy she likes to dance just as a good measure.(whats the worst that can happen he says no and you don't dance with him)|`|iysNv79Oaa	i don't think that this girl is a true friend. a friend wouldn't do that to you. and if the guy ands up going out with her then he will obviously not be a good boyfriend. <br>  i think you should try talking to her because sometimes its just that the person doesn't really know how your feeling or they are just the oblivious type. also you can try talking to some of your other friends.<br>  But whatever you do, DO NOT START GOSSIP!!! that will be the worst thing you can do!<br>  But, you obviously don't seem like that kind of person. i think you should talk to your friend or ignore her for a while if you think that will teach her something. You seem young, so thins is the time you usually get mixed up in the teen/kid dramas. The SAME thing happened to me once, and luckily my friend understood. Go on with your life, worse things can happen. I hope it all goes well, and your friend finds some other guy to go after. Just ask yourself, "Is this a guy im interested in?", or if your sure that he's not move on, and find someone else. <br>  Some people just don't understand,but i totally get how you feel!hope i helped, best of luck with your friend (and ANY guy!!).:):):):P|`|oIC8gWjtaa	maybe your friend would just slow dance with him if he asked, just to be nice. If not...she's a horrible friend. But she should always say no, anywayz if she really cared about you. She should know that it would hurt you to have her be with him. Tell her to consider if you danced with the guy she really liked. It might be awkward and need courage, but you need to confront her.
AA10762620	i fell asleep-sorry.|`|11ae79d6bf1a32ce27c3d8dd58ae3673aa	Good Lord just ask the chick out before you put us all to sleep|`|1649f04592bee659fadf0d42aca54899aa	She has done everything but ask you out herself.  If you can't do it on the phone, then while you are chatting on MSN, mention a movie and ask if she would go with you to see it.  I bet she'll say yes!  If you don't make a move, you'll never get to go out with her.  Good luck, I know you can do this!|`|19e5da9f0fc70fc9ad5946e1f9738556aa	Its too long wait for her just like u bored us u must be boring her, hence she pissed off|`|cecca49073c3c1f599073c88452611a7aa	you are talking in circles here...she probably feels the same way.<br>  If your  relationship is as bad as you make it seem than there is probably no real relationship.  Chatting on line is one thing but being with someone is totally different. Maybe she just wants to chat casually with you and nothing more. Ask her what she wants from you.  Its better to know the truth than to live in la-la land. If she only wants to chat than leave it at that.  If she wants more she will let you know.|`|f3ce54f28cfcfdd0b5deb3d1c1e6a50faa	Well If You Really Like This Girl Just Continue Talking To Her & Just Ask Her If She Would Like To Go To A Movie With You Or Something. And If She Saids Yes Just Ask Her If It Would Possible To Go With You & Her. And If She Tells You No Then Maybe It Might Be Time To Just Move On & Fine Someone Who Will Like You. Life Is Way To Short Honey So Don't Just Let It Slip You By. I Hope This Helps A Little Bit. Good Luck.
8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Something I was taught as a kid is that "while there is life, there is hope," and it was permanently ingrained in me.  Fight for what you want out of life and don't settle for less.  Do not accept second best.  You might end up alone, but you won't be bitter, because you will have been living for your ideals and not someone else's.<br>  <br>  Yes, I do feel this way at times.  It is because I am a lawyer and always giving but never seen as needing.  It is because I am a single mother and children are not here to meet their mother's needs.  This is what special little pampering things are about.  Your favorite music, books, a bath, a favorite relaxation tea, relaxation lotions, a glass of red wine, a bit of good chocolate, etc.<br>  <br>  CHOOSE to be happy.  Yes, I believe it is a choice, and do not believe we are victims of circumstance unless we allow ourselves to become this.|`|2dd5ead8a0ebfd17db4114329eae540caa	Start out by taking care of yourself. Go out and do something nice just for  you.|`|OhkY8n7Yaa	Because you know what you want and what you don't want...|`|qw7BmBq6aa	First off, life's too short to keep self centered friends.  Those kind of people that just take, they will take until you have nothing left, and you are empty emotionally.<br>  <br>  You need to start surrounding yourself with happy friendly people, people who are givers too.<br>  <br>  Also, maybe try not to give all of yourself anymore.  Start putting limits on what you'll do for others, make sure you don't fall into that people pleasing pitt fall, thats enough to kill even martha stewart.|`|1xNsWOnOaa	People will always judge, you have to be stronger than them.  Happiness is a contant search for all of us.  A lot of people you think are happy really aren't.  Keep trying and keep searching.  One day you will feel it.  We are all truly alone in this life so do what YOU want.|`|xr8j9Tjhaa	It is not selfish to take care of yourself and what you need. if you try to help others when you are missing what you need it could lead to resentment and burnout<br>  <br>  it might help if you could start doing things for yourself.|`|lmSoNMhPaa	you know what make you happy.you just need to find yourself and come into your own.|`|Alkp8P29aa	Im pretty much always happy (but not like CREEPY happy). You just have to take notice of the little joys in life! Ya know, like look around you  and find other things that make you happy! Im not saying you should try to be someone your not, cause that's wrong! And, maybe if you took your mind off what you've done right, you'll see what you've done WRONG, and start noticing things better. That way, you'll start to notice and  appreciate why your livin'! The reason you feel that way, in my opinion, is because you were giving for the wrong reasons. You were giving to people to say you gave, not to just help the people. You can never give too much. And your life isn't over, you just need to find what makes you happy. I hope i could help you!! I really do hate to see people in misery... 8/|`|EIxFvhYTaa	You are not alone in feeling like this, and I know how it is to get so into helping others that you forget about yourself. Then after a while you look back and realize that you have lost yourself and no longer remember who you used to be...<br>  Why not start small... try different ice cream and see which one is your favorite. Try different perfumes, lotions, music, movies and see what you like... take a day to try on different clothes and see what you feel more comfortable in. <br>  Little things like these will lead to other things... <br>  Have hope, because this is like a new beginning for you, how exiting to rediscover yourself! Keep your head up, there is a lot to look forward to...|`|rXORvIstaa	I know what you mean.  Here is what I do.  If I see that I am the one who is putting more into a friendship, then I just stop calling that person or going over to visit them.  I try not to be upset about it, and I figure if that person wants to talk to me, then they would call.  I don't really understand why people sometimes don't reciprocate in a friendship.  I guess we are all so busy with our lives that sometimes we don't have the energy to spread around to everyone.  It is completely okay to stop seeing someone if you feel you aren't getting anything from the the relationship or friendship.  Don't waste your time on those people.  Go do something for you.  Learn how to enjoy time doing things by yourself (going to the movies, beach, park, or at home).  Eventually, you will meet the people who value your time.  Don't feel ashamed, or lonely, or like nobody likes you just because you do some things on your own.  Feel good about yourself.  When you do, people will come to you.<br>  <br>  Take care.|`|u1uECuFNaa	I feel like this also.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Oh yeah. All that giving, and in my experience, they gave back, but nothing healthy. One sided relationships, even friendships are 'time limited'. Taking on so much and not getting anything positive in return is never a good thing. <br>  <br>  Try to let yourself have some 'healthy' selfishness. It can work wonders for you. Start with one small thing, something that you would enjoy, just for you. <br>  <br>  You need some ME time, give to yourself what you used to give to others. It sounds to me like you are experiencing burn out. Find someone who can give to you the emotional support that you need, and go ahead, be selfish. The worst thing that can happen is you might find your smile again.
NbmnWwqEaa	First of all . . . no, too young for sex, both of you! Doesn't make you a prude. In fact, I, for one, would have more respect for you as a man if you wait until you are a legal adult, and save your viriginity for the young woman you are very much in love with.<br>  <br>  So, that said, you are only 14 and in four years, let's visit the virginity again. In the meantime, thank you for being a gentleman with respect to your girlfriend.<br>  <br>  In my day and age . . . we had "board games" . . . as we didn't have computers.

FVDTXM68aa	Hun, don't change your morals! I'm 22 and engaged to my man (who is 25) and he just bought us a newly built 3 story house for our future. His house is in the neighborhood next to me and my parents, and I'm not moving in until after we're married! Just because everyone else is doing it, doesn't mean you have to! I think it's funny b/c all my other friends moved in to apartments with their bfs (who aren't really motivated to make money), and they ALL (3 of my girl friends) moved out and back in with their parents. Too much stress on their relationships (especially since they aren't through college yet and don't have set careers). So, in other words...don't be jealous of what others are doing :) Focus on your school/career and continue being happy! Just because your bf doesn't want to "plan" everything out right this second doesn't mean he doesn't love you!! He is probably trying to figure things out himself ;) Don't take it personally. I mean, hey, you still have the guy...so don't worry!! :) Things will work out in the future!! But for now, be happy having each other. Remember, don't change your morals just because you want a quick fix/change. And don't let anyone tell you that your stupid for not moving in with your bf before marriage. A lot of smart people wait (so don't feel bad)! I hope this helps!! Good Luck, sweetie!!! You sound like you have your head on straight!! :)|`|03ce03bb1a9fba2bd6ebcd6ed48ff8e4aa	My advice is, don't ever move in with your boyfriend or girlfriend.  If you two are going to get married, not engaged, then yes do so.  But, the thing is, if you live with each other, you will see each other every day.  You will have no personal space.  I am not trying to be mean, but just trying to make you think.  Most of my personal experience in life has made me think twice about moving in with a girl that I am dating.  The best thing to do is to keep planning about the future.  Wait a few years, and then evaluate where you two are.

Vch9DTraaa	Go the best Counselor, God Himself.  Talk to Him, cry out to Him, I'm telling you, there is no one that can fill your heart or heal a heart better than Him!|`|chlvKoXqaa	Talk to your pastor AND his wife together, I know exactly how you feel, but, its called forgiveness, this is the time to live by faith. Go on God's strength day by day, not your own. Jesus forgave all your sins if you are saved, you have to TRUELY forgive. If your husband continous on in unrepentent adultery then you probably have to separate, until he repents and gets checked for std's [my opinion]. I cried and prayed and talked to Christian friends but never would I repay evil with evil. Look how our Lord Jesus was betrayed, and He never sinned.|`|kbz5S3waaa	ask at a local church?|`|CUMdhfKzaa	Google.|`|a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	That is a good question. Doesn't it feel like we are LOST out here after betrayal. Marriage ministries seem to exist for good relationships and strengthening somewhat strong marriages. We need consolation, fellowship and understanding. I will look and let you know if you will look and let me know. So far, it is non-existent. Through all the prayer, I still feel lonely like no one can really touch that hurt, lost, painful part that scar that my husband's betrayal touched. I was his 2nd wife and I can see how detrimental it is that he never truly healed from his betrayal by his 1st wife. What a mess. We need help!

wXaGIPSPaa	The pain, hurt, confusion you are feeling is overwhelming.  You are dwelling on what happened and replaying it over and over again in your mind.  Your spouse did not physically touch another person so let it go.  Try with all your power to rebuild your marriage.  Flirt, tease, dress up, do things together, date, write love notes, fondle, cuddle....<br>  push all the doubts out of your heart and mind for now and concentrate on loving one another.  Those doubts will torment you and kill your relationship and end it.  <br>  You need therapy. You cant do this alone. You need a third party that is not siding with one or another.<br>  Forgiveness is a choice.  YOu choose to forgive then its not fair to keep bringing it up and slapping their face with it. You choose to forgive then you need to focus all your energy on repair. Dont waste it on stuff that will just damage it more.<br>  You can beat this.  Many relationships have had harder problems than this and survived. And if you dont survive at least you will know you tried your very best.  So move on now.  its not easy but its worth it.<br>  take care and good luck.|`|EMKuBql8aa	What....didn't like everyone's answers so you decided to post again??<br>  <br>  I still stand on what i said, lie detectors are not accurate, that is why they are not used in court.

nqkXE1cUaa	We all have relationships and only a few of those relationships last the tides of time. We all go through heartache. Here are a few tips that I have gathered and tested my self in my 'extensive' research.<br>  <br>      *<br>        Email<br>      *<br>        Send to Phone<br>      *<br>        Print Article<br>  <br>      *<br>        Add to Favorites<br>      *<br>        Flag Article<br>      * Share<br>  <br>  Instructions<br>  Difficulty: Moderate<br>  Step1<br>  If this was a bad, one-sided relationship... remind yourself of that. This will help you disassociate and distance yourself. Make a list of all the horrible things that happend. Post this list by the phone so that you are not tempted to call this person or to answer the phone when this person calls you.<br>  Step2<br>  Change something or as many things as you can. It could be a new hair cut and color, the way you like it for once. Rearrange the furniture. You don't have to buy something new. Try a new look or wardrobe, if you can afford it.<br>  Step3<br>  Try a new routine. Visit different bars, coffee shops, sites, shops, etc. Go where you want.<br>  Step4<br>  Pamper yourself. Why not? A warm bath with rose petals. A nice piece of lingerie. A nice outfit.<br>  Step5<br>  Play your music in the car.<br>  Step6<br>  When your are ready get rid of it ALL. Pictures, clothes, concert ticket stubs, presents, phone numbers, email address<br>  Step7<br>  Allow yourself time. This could take weeks but it should not last forever.|`|4Ovf0Gr8aa	you gotta realize this guy is dumb. <br>  seriously.. i wish girls would realize that there are more guys in the world. honestly..i went through a bad break up.. he was the love of my life... but i got over him becuase i realized that iw as waisting my time, waiting for something that wasn't going to happen. it's gunna take time, yes.. but you gotta move on and hang out with other people.

dmBnnwXvaa	This is a tricky question to answer because there are a lot of reasons why people run out of things to say in a conversation. I suggest you just sit down and think of things that you like to do or talk about with other people and then talk about them with your friend. Pay attention to things that she likes and talk to her about them. You can bring up music, movies, TV, radio shows, youtube videos, facebook, homework and practically anything else!|`|AA12034666	A good friendship doesn't need to have every moment of silence filled by talking. You're gonna run out of things to say every once in awhile. Don't worry. Just relax and enjoy each others company in silence. Pretty soon, something else will come up to talk about.<br>  <br>  Back when you first met you talked all night because you both had a lot of background to share. You've caught up on that background now. There's not so much new to learn about each other.<br>  <br>  Going places together, and doing things together, and sharing experiences automatically gives you food for conversation.|`|3sItMgOIaa	You need to suck every last word out of a topic before pushing it to one side.

There are several answers to your dilemma and they're based upon ages. If you're in junior high, then you have a major issue because you're siblings are your team members and "your brothers keeper". If you're of that age group than you need to get into sports or have them join some kind of sports so that you/they can learn to be teammates. <br>  Now if you're an adult or a soon to be adult, all you have to do is be nice and tell them how you really feel.

KWeU8LJtaa	You don't go to the DMV to get married. You go there for anything you need related to your car.<br>  <br>  You go to your courthouse to get your marriage license. No matter where you live in the US, you need to have a marriage license if you plan on getting married.|`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	You don't get marriage licenses from the DMV unless you are marrying a car. You get a marriage license from the county courthouse, which is in most counties only open Monday to Friday 8:30 to 4:30. (It may be different in Denver.)  You'll need your driver's licenses, social security cards, and any military or other official picture ID. The fee for the license varies from county to county, and most counties require cash.<br>  <br>  You need the license in your hands before you can marry.|`|AA10604036	Marriage is two things: a personal commitment and a civil contract.<br>  <br>  To make the personal commitment of marriage you need only do it, no license required.<br>  <br>  To create a binding civil contract you must apply for a marriage license and have it solemnized by a representative of the State.<br>  <br>  So your answer is yes and no.  :)<br>  <br>  If you want a legally binding marriage contract, the DMV can't help you.  You need to see your County's Clerk and Recorder to get a license application processed.  However, it looks like you can solemnize your own marriage in Colorado, who knew?!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|vyL7yEleaa	yes you would need to get a marriage license from that counties court house in order to get married unless you plan on getting married in las vegas.<br>  <br>  the DMV is for the department of motor vehicles. you wouldn't be able to get a marriage license there. you would need to go to the county court house and get one from them.|`|hsZnjZvoaa	I have never performed a ceremony with a license issued by the driver's license people.   Most people go to the county courthouse during the week.  Las Vegas has very late hours at their clerk fo court, especially on the weekend|`|xZG0q6vXaa	Thanks for the 2 points<br>  <br>  What were you gonna do at the Driving Motor Vehicles office?  Are you of age to drive a car or bike?
7iEk06aDaa	Don't worry, honey, your parents are adults and I'm sure that they can handle the situation. Just sit tight until your dad gets back and maybe he will explain everything then.|`|8bf22a7b300866a77ba08f820aaefdcaaa	Does you grandfather have Alzheimer's or memory loss problems?<br>  <br>  He may have very well walked out of the house and might randomly be roaming around the area. I'm sure they have called the cops and there are probably quite a few people looking for him.<br>  <br>  He will probably be returned safely. Calm down and think happy thoughts. Everything should be OK.|`|LHojBfx5aa	I think if it was completely major, they would tell you. Just think positive thoughts. See, like, on thanksgiving, the day my grandmother died, my parents told me what was happening and that they didn't know wether or not she'd be okay. So they told me. They knew it was major. <br>  <br>  Your parents would tell you if it was very important, no matter what age you are. Anyway, just think positive thoughts. If something bad happens, God has a reason for it. If you think the best, the best will happen...just be realistic =D. I know it's scary. <br>  <br>  Good Luck Hun.|`|l4jSgRRmaa	Parents often don't realize that children imagine worse things when they try to shield them from the truth.

I work and am a great wife to my man!n My ex cheated and Im sooooo glad I was able to take care of me and the kids. It really is important to think relaistically even if you think it is stupid/ Better to be prepared. Plus its better for your self esteem to be out of the house and be productive in both areas. Its called well rounded. Youll see what I mean if all you do is stay at home.|`|bO2rzfISaa	I'd set my aspirations a bit higher. Go to college if you don't have to work. You can keep your house clean in less than an hour a day. You'll need the education if your marriage doesn't work out, and statistically, it won't. Nothing personal, you're just way too young.<br>  <br>  EDIT: As I said, nothing personal. I've been 19, married and pregnant. Then I was 26, remarried and pregnant. Statistically, you should know I'm speaking the truth, especially if you already have a college education (good for you).|`|IvMPh09baa	wow... your 19 and also pregnant and married.  I think your playing house right now... you should have grown up a bit before jumping to all these adult responsibilities.  I give your marriage 2 years tops, until both of you realize you should have sewed your wild oats first.<br>  <br>  ADD: 19 and a college degree? impossible.  you are also a liar now.|`|tbEChzAGaa	the perfect housewife to most men will differ, you should ask your husband, tell him how you feel.

Today, he emailed this to me,<br>  "for future relationships." Maybe it can help you.<br>  I am not listening to this ish.. I mean... whatever<br>  is my attitude about his giving ME advice for the <br>  future... AAARGH. But I think your desire is noble.<br>  Just remember men are very very visual and having<br>  a gorgeous hot wife is a mans dream come true.<br>  Treat him like a KING and be sure he reciprocates<br>  and shares the same love with you.

My husband tells me every day that he thinks i am a great wife and that he doesn't deserve me. My suggestions to you are:<br>  1. Love him as much as you love your self.<br>  2. Ask him what does he think would make you a better wife.<br>  3. Do your best.<br>  If you will do these three things i think that every thing else will just fall into place.|`|Wtx2GXVbaa	As far as doing your part, sista you are doing a great deal you are carrying a child that is a job in it self, so do not feel like you are not doing your part.  Just greet your man with a smile and a kiss everyday and always keep a good line of communication open with him, but do not ever nag him.  What you both need to do is to be there for each other.  Being a good wife and housewife are two jobs alone so just think in a positivev way as much as possible.

This could be the start of something amazing when you start talking!! =]|`|RuJhWnS5aa	Talk to her about class (jokes about the professor, questions, whatever), but DO NOT ask about her.  She'll think you're hitting on her if you ask her questions about herself (which could backfire on you).  And I wouldn't introduce yourself until she tells you her name.

Do you have anything in common with the girl? This girl could be really shy and doesn't know how you feel about her so she doesn't want to make a move. I'll give you an example: me. I'm too shy to talk to any guy I like so this could be her case.  Just be yourself. If you're funny, that definitely works in your favor even if you think your jokes might be stupid and dorky. If she's really sweet, her heart will melt and know it's the thought that counts. And if you're getting any math tests back anytime soon, ask her what she got, it's a normal question so she won't suspect you like her if you don't want her to know. Do you sit near her?? If not, maybe ask the teacher if everyone can change seats. If your teacher is REALLY cool they'll might let you choose your own seats. Then you "accidentially" sit near her. Good luck and lets hope you get the girl!|`|qSsLPBo3aa	Well she's already in your class just go to her and be like man this is hard. Do you get this.

Trust me... girls seem to be attracted to a mysterious guy.<br>  <br>  just give her a little smile and turn around right after and then automatically <br>  her mind will start thinking and then she will probably ask for help or somthing<br>  but if you really want this to work DO NOT ACT DESPERATE or seem like you are trying too hard... kind of make her come to you.  it might take sometime but if she is worth it... this might just work out with you guys<br>  <br>  So again if you seem to catch her eye just smile and turn around make her feel that<br>  she can talk to you and that your nice and she is confortable to confront you.|`|504UiytAaa	Tell her that you had trouble with your homework, and was wondering if she could help you because you heard she was smart.

zdu3gh8jaa	Go and meet her, keep the conversation light and if she starts to get difficult just say that you have matured a lot since last year and now you tend to think more before you speak out, also you were hoping that you could put the past behind you and start a new relationship with her. If she continues to be difficult, just collect your coat and walk away telling her that when she decides she wants to move on from the issue to give you a ring then you'll talk. Other than that wish her well and leave her to it. <br>  She may have already forgiven and forgotten and this is her way of starting over again.<br>  Hope all works out well for you, take a couple of deep breaths before you meet her and just be your happy smiley self. Don't worry about it, at the end of the day the worst that can happen is that she doesn't want to know you.Good Luck and enjoy your day.|`|wlqUMBZbaa	Just bite the bullet and be nice as pie and if she turns nasty just walk away.|`|SyqNpS6Baa	Honestly, if it's been a year and your cousin has made the first move to get back in touch, then I'd say that everything was forgotten.  The first thing to do to break the ice, would be to give him / her a hug when you see them.  Everything else after that should be easier.  Whatever you do, never apologise for what you said the year before, if you meant it then don't take it back.  Good Luck.

x4LYGAIkaa	If sex is all that matters, no wonder you're not happy. The body can be only tricked and pleased only so much, to satisfy the mind is trickier. You shouldn't get with anyone just because of the sex. There is a difference between love and lust. Ask him if he's happy, and how he feels about the marriage. And then tell him how you feel. If you fight for simple things, there is a bigger problem that is causing you two to blow up over things that shouldn't matter. If you have to, find a marriage counselor to help you sort things out. If you do divorce, next time you marry someone think about the future, lest get bored with that person as well.|`|JigLlBUaaa	De pas it ., de pas it ...oops , new card , new card , new card............

NuvKPl3naa	i married for love, but the fact my husband had a job made it easier.|`|QdCwBSVQaa	Both.  I married my second husband because I love him, but money (in the broadest sense of the word) is also important.  I didn't marry him because he's rich (I make more money at my job than he does) -- I married him in part because he has similar financial goals (i.e., doesn't like to have a lot of debt, doesn't run up credit cards, wanted to buy a house, saves aggressively toward retirement, likes a diversified, fairly conservative investment portfolio).  <br>  <br>  My first husband was a trust fund baby who will eventually inherit a fortune when his parents die.  He is a spoiled titty baby who thinks life owes him a luxurious lifestyle.  He was alternately grandiose and embarrassingly cheap when it came to money.

hGDTV4C1aa	sometimes I feel the same way, when you are privileged, although you know there are others that have much less than you  it still doesn't stop you from wanting the excesses of life that you are used to. Some call it spoiled, from whatever point of the spectrum they sit. There are some who have more, and think that you may be deprived. Sometimes I wish that my parents did not have so many materialistic things to give me, so maybe then I could appreciate what they did give me. When you have less you appreciate more, when you have more you appreciate less.|`|NuvKPl3naa	maybe you are resenting it. you snap your fingers and what you need or want is there, while other people are not so lucky. i guess think about what you want, what you really feel. and if you are spoiled and selfish than you are the only one to change that. next time your mom wants to buy you a coach purse, tell her know maybe use the money for charity. regardless of your upbringing you are who you want to be|`|8j7FCEOraa	Emo?<br>  Get your head out of your butt, unless you were abused there is nothing wrong with the way your parents raised you.

HKkbqlIuaa	Well, I can't make your decisions for you, nor do I truly know what you're feeling, but here's advice from my point of view. Exes are exes for a reason. They are in the past. "Old flame." That in itself doesn't sound to promising in my opinion. Now, if you don't think the relationship is going anywhere, and you have really put 100% into it, then you can end it. I would not end the relationship just because an ex came back into your life. <br>  <br>  In a nut shell, if you want to end the relationship, then go ahead. Just make sure it's what you really want, and it's not because some old feelings are coming back up. Maybe one of the reasons you can't love the new guy is because of the old feelings for your ex? It sounds like this might be ruining future relationships. I'm not trying to sound judgemental, but for you to be willing to just throw your current relationship out the window, shows you definitely still have feelings. I think you need to get over this ex so you can move on with your life. It's not fair to you, your current and or future partners. <br>  <br>  NOTE: I could be wrong on my assumptions because I don't know you, or the other people. This is just what I take from it. Just remember, the relationship ended for a reason.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	You obviously aren't happy with your present relationship so just end it so you can both move on. Whether you hook up with the old flame should have nothing to do with it, why waste your time and the guy's time ?|`|7831010767e13fd92e98f42d4a2ef7aeaa	Dump the jerk. But that doesn't mean the other guy is a good choice either. It's ok to have time between boyfriends.|`|Ajz5hyXJaa	here is my advice from experience with this exact subject<br>  you should go on a few 'lunches' with your old flame these are not dates. just get to know u and catch up sort of thing.<br>  Give it a couple of weeks (5 or so) and you will have a better idea of who you want to be with and if it turns out your old flame and u rekindle then just tell the guy that you are with that you and him do not connect as well as you want and be genuin if u break up with him and do it gently

4a10b417978a3ffd7eec913e8023dcdfaa	Oh, I am sorry you are going through something like this, but it happens sometimes when you get involved with someone who is divorced.  I believe that when a person has sex with another, their souls meld and become one (supported by the verse in the Bible that says two become one upon marriage).  Give him time to think, but realize that at some level, he will always be attached to his exwife.  She sounds like she is being a bit jealous and over-protective, but she may still be attached to him.  Give them a chance to work things out (after all, they have children together), and then see what happens.  If he is pulling away from both of you for some time to think, give him that time.  Realize that he may choose her again, and then go live your life.|`|2f4e8d608eb1581a076ac3a1cfadfe5aaa	This may sound a little harsh but you need to read it.

U need a man with No baggage.|`|i4wchS1baa	The mature approach would be to give him some space.  You can't force someone to choose you.  If he does decide that he wants a relationship with you, it needs to be him coming to that conclusion on his own.  If he does, he needs to set some boundaries with his ex.  If not, you're headed for a life of pain with him.  Best of luck to you!|`|41ea565bf959d722ee7c178f47af61b7aa	He is probably using your for the sex and he is using the wife as a deversion|`|ZDjyH7Zzaa	I think the ball is in his court at this point he needs to decide over the two of you but it sounds like his ex is crazy if he loved you enough it shouldnt be a hard choice.|`|7ab43c98209854db2f4365b29564e4d6aa	At first he says he's you're his soulmate, later he says he loves you and his ex wife?

AA12317807	if you truely love your boyfriend you will tell the other guy you cant talk to him anymore.. if you guys are having intimate convos then you basically are being with him.. its not right.. you and your boyfriend can get the buzz back.. if you love eachother you will always find your way back to how things are supposed to be.. just tell him that you feel like you guys are changing and you want it to be like old times.. just let the other guy go.. he isnt worth it and if he is trying to break you and your bf up he cant be that great..|`|AA11455037	you should feel bad and you are going behind his back...Are you sure that this new guy is just not Lust? When you have been in a relationship for sometime ,it begins to get comfortable and some time loses that buzz as you call it,but this new guy is giving you a new buzz,however after you are with him for 2 years that buzz will get comfortable too....You need to really find your feelings and figure out who you love and let the other one go..If you choose your current boyfriend that has lost that buzz,then do not tell him about this new guy just dump him and continue your realtonship with your current guy...if you choose the new guy then break up with the current boyfriend,don,t string him along///|`|AA11604216	Break it off with your current boyfriend.

Be careful.|`|8ossSEMNaa	If you really love your boyfriend, you need to cut off ties with this other guy. That situation sucks because you can't have that "new" feeling forever, but then again, if you're interested in someone else, that could be a sign that you're not all that happy in your current situation.|`|Lq60BUfPaa	Generally pleasure seekers find each other, joining forces to make noise and raise dust.

You need to decide how you would feel if you lost your boyfriend. If he's worth hanging onto then you have to stop seeing the other guy. It's hard at first but within a couple of weeks that 'buzz' starts to fade.|`|e18eebfc86c953bb5034cf217f506683aa	I've been in that situation recently..i had a girlfriend for 3years but had a strong feeling for another girl..<br>  <br>  what i did was, i broke up with my GF and told her that I am not happy anymore with her..but at the same time, i tried to avoid this another girl..<br>  <br>  I just needed time to settle things on my mind..<br>  <br>  after realizing that, that was only a test for our relationship, i came back to her and told the truth..<br>  <br>  You need time for yourself..fix yourseld..you're in a big trap..if you don't control that feelings, then you may be broken..<br>  <br>  "what comes around comes around"..<br>  <br>  what if for example you broke with your BF and tried the relationship with that man and then realized that he was meant to come into your life and make you feel that you are for each other but leaves you behind after some time..then if you want to go back into your realtionship with your BF, it's too late....<br>  <br>  you are risking your love...you are risking your happiness and future..may be you are looking fir sme characteristicsthat are not present in your BF..or worse, maybe you are only projecting those characteristics to that man..<br>  <br>  you need time to decipher yourself..follow your heart..<br>  <br>  "There's no easy way of breaking someone's heart" - Anonymous<br>  <br>  "If you are meant to be with someone, it doesn't mean that you are meant for that someone NOW"-Dawson's Creek<br>  <br>  you will meet new people in your life and there will be a special person designed to be with you forever..<br>  <br>  you decide...<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  (hugs!)
ZMWoytmhaa	Apparently Gisselle goes through a lot of guys so you could hang on for a while and see what happens.

f69621832c284abd1971e2abce27e5b1aa	you could try flirting with her.

9b2c9fbacf1de45417983e585eadccbbaa	Not a good sign of his behaviour towards you. Because putting his arm around you , make him feel that you are "cheap" and can "touch, touch" type of girls. Tell him off and show some respect, unless you let him arm around and flirt.|`|AA11289875	It sound's like he really likes you.  Men tend to get touchy when we like a woman, this way it gives more of a connection.|`|y78mFbELaa	Just go with it and just ask if he wants to go out, life is short you might regreat it if you don't.|`|lGm3g5F0aa	Sorry, not enough info to tell yet.

Make it obvious that you are interested.. Get closer to her, by standing next to her with a group of friends (not making it obvious or anything) and try looking at her.. If she gives you an 'inviting' look, try saying 'Hi'. If she responds interested ask her something you already know. Like, "Don't you go to Edison High school?". That will spark up a conversation..|`|nq7qgoV3aa	line won't work <br>  <br>  make eye-contact with her <my best ideas><br>  <br>  p/s:  find out her background, then u decide which line is the most suitable for her|`|c034dwWXaa	start with small talk first...by saying hi how are you.... and go from there like ask her has she seen any good movies lately and if she said no then say something like " Im dont know if your seeing someone but if your not would you like to go see a movie or go get a coffee or lunch sometime?????"|`|aOD7iGM5aa	First of all don't call her a girl. Second if you need a line it probably won't work, women wan't sincerity and honesty.

Just like you don't want to be prejudge. Don't decide that all women act that this way.
THqNBbYXaa	Where you can find anyone now is a good question, but it's not the main question.  The main question is "How can I win her?" not "Where can I find her?"  I've met too many people (men and women) perpetually asking "where can I find someone" when in fact, they hardly spend any time on themselves...

cWAyOriWaa	It doesnt mean he doesnt care about you. It probably meant he couldnt call beacuse the call was so expensive, or maybe he was busy going on trips and sightseeing. 1 week isnt too long, but I know its not much fun when you dont hear from your guy. He was probably thinking about you though. Did he bring you anything back with him? I would think you know your boyfriend cares and loves you by the little things he does for you. My boyfriend bought me a teddy bear cuz Im scared of the dark, and maybe if he does sweet things for you, and makes you feel good about yourself|`|AA11093708	definitely he doesnt' love u and care about u, otherwise he wouldn't go on a trip or he would have been calling u every day. and u know when your bf cares about u without asking stupid questions|`|01ef0137587ead6164d9d3f4a67ef386aa	He cares about you but he loves himself more.

He may be very busy with his life. Talk to him and do not indulge in self doubt.<br>  <br>  Believe him, and ask him periodically if he is alright and he will tell u what is going on in his life at that moment that is keeping him so occupied.|`|DDAiFbXhaa	if it bothers u find another man that treats u the way u want to be treated.

fKUMDkbbaa	It is very possible that your friend might be thingking that if he moves forward and things don't work out, he could be losing a really good friend and losing a good friend can be scary and hard to do. I would suggest that you talk to him about it. If you're really good friends, you should be able to sit down together and consider all the options and really hear each other out. Remember, he may think that you having you even as just a friend is better than not having you at all.|`|AA12034463	i think its time for u guys to sit down and talk it out|`|AA12263138	unless, hes thinking twice, then hes not sure and he dont deserve you.|`|58ovTMMTaa	take him to the beach and if he doesn't say he loves you there then he doesn't love you|`|9f85ef94de6fee83bf69652cb32d082baa	scared, maybe. that's a a really big move ya kno|`|cde58727159fd5660d7cd2c9f7e1632aaa	HE LIES

El solo hecho de tu hacer este tipo de preguntas, es porque muy dentro de ti, sabes que no está bien lo que te ocurre. No le des más largas al asunto, es muy fácil para él tenerte a ti en México y a la otra en Argentina.

And you'll do fine, and you guys can be good at it with eachother. lol, you'll be fine, good luck. :)

b08f23f64cf67ed7e34f8ed0781dfd16aa	Sometimes they get mad at you or their pissed off for no reason at all.<br>  Sometimes they ask you questions about that one topic their jealous about and we tend to ask it in a happy and natural way so guys wont figure it out.<br>  But we dont show it that often, we usually go home and cry.

b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Yes. My FIL. Although he's not as horrible as some people's on here, his personality can really irritate me to the point where I get so exasperated even though I really feel like I can't say anything. He is opinionated and wants to do things his way, including coming to our house with a generous offering of plants and landscape shrubs that he insists putting where HE wants them. At one point we thought my daughter had a hereditary birth defect (that my son also had) and were preparing for non-surgical treatment once she was born and he told us basically to forget that and get the surgery, which would have been totally unnecessary. I am still fuming over that one - why would I want to subject my child, or myself, to something that I don't need to? And he, of all people , should understand, as a former doctor! Sheesh. <br>  <br>  While my husband tells me 'just tell him to butt out' I can't do that. I should, but I just don't feel comfortable doing so, even though sometimes I'd like to scream at him. LOL|`|7G4hisdzaa	That's why so many people move away from their parents, lol.  You are normal.  <br>  My FSIL is the one that makes me cringe.  She flaunts her money so badly...do I really need to hear 4 times in a phone conversation that she's buying my FBIL $10,000 rims for his birthday?  No mention of what they look like or anything just the cost.  Or how about how much she spends on other stuff??  REALLY?|`|a56a406aaba268997057d38313eb29b0aa	No, I haven't had this issue with family member but I do have it with my wife's best friend. I'm the kind of person that usually gets along with everyone, but, it only took a couple of hours after meeting her that I just had to leave and go to another room for a while. I politely excused myself and wasn't rude about it. But After a year of avoiding her my wife knows better to invite her over while i'm there. I'm not sure why but this gal just really gets under my skin. You shouldn't feel bad for feeling what you do. My wife and I just had to realize that we can't and shouldn't expect to get along with everyone of the others friends. I hope i helped in some way. Take Care..|`|ckd18jUMaa	It's the same between my mom and I. It's so normal, people have different personalities, that's all. Just make sure that you're there for her when she needs you, because even tho your personalities clash, which is only fair, no other woman will ever love you more than she does, believe me!<br>  <br>  ... and then again I'm also sure, and this I see by my own example, that the years will make you understand her personality better, on one hand, and on the other hand, what will happen to you is that you will become a lot more relaxed about things in general, no longer being so bothered about what she says or does... I mean that's what maturity does to you, you suddenly become superior to things and learn how to laugh about it instead of feeling so bummed, and that usually plays a great role at healing stormy relationships with people that you love, exactly!!<br>  <br>  You can't choose your family, what you can and will in time learn to do is to be lighthearted about the way your family is, and love them for what they are and laugh about theirs and your own faults!<br>  Good luck with getting there! LOL :)|`|eWObKmBSaa	Many, many people say that and feel guilty.  NO, my husband and daughter are psychology majors and they both say, you must protect and do what is correct for yourself.  I too, can visit with her sometimes but she gets on my nerves.  My sister is the same way, she is annoying, so I just do things with her sometimes, not always.<br>  You have to preserve yourself.  No, telling her would not help things, she won't understand.<br>  I finally realized that my mother raised me the way that she did, is because that is how she was raised.  I guess her mother and her didn't get along either.<br>  My sister has a very, very bad marriage because of the negative and other ways she was raised.  <br>  I had those things in me too but i acknowledged it and got help so my marriage because of Jesus, not me, my marriage is under Jesus and I go to Him for help, in prayer.<br>  So, make your visit short, when you want them, call her daily and just tell her that you are busy.  Because life is a busy time for us all.<br>  Tell her that you will sometimes come visit and do for about 1 hr or so once a week or two.  Go to dinner.  If you stay at her house, she will complain about things that need fixing.  My father is gone, so no one does her stuff, except if my brother or husband do them.  Taking her away from teh house, is a treat for her too.  My mom has her own car but I do not ride with her, she is too old in my opinion to drive.
ckd18jUMaa	You were right to leave the message. Actually I know people who would have done a lot more. I know I would. From what you're telling their behavior sounds unacceptable! There is absolutely no excuse for such a behavior! It is their mother we're talking about... I don't know what kind of relationship they had with their mom, even tho by what you're telling it might have been quite stormy, but nevertheless the 3 of them seem to be old enough to understand the meaning of their mom passing away and therefore having to put what ever issues they might have had behind!!! It doesn't sound like mature adult behavior to me, on the contrary! It is your sister, you did what you had to do. Because before being her mother, wherever she is (God bless her soul),  she is your sister, first of all and foremost!! I would have done,at least, exactly what you did, at least!!!|`|Sxlcyua5aa	I am so sorry for your loss.   The last thing you all needed was to have family issues on top of a difficult situation.   You did nothing wrong.   Her kids are adults now and they need to act like adults.   Just don't worry about it.   Put it out of your mind.   Losing their mother will make them grow up, because...........they have too now.|`|l0opvMfGaa	i was sorry for the tragic death of your sister<br>  i hope they will handle the situation very well|`|wvzQObahaa	i really don't understand their behavior . it seems they weren't on good terms with their mom while she was alive  . i suppose they all were suffering of broken  family bonds  ..but that is no excuse to take such a harsh stand at the final good bye ..i think you did the right thing trying to get them visit their mom at the hospital during her last days ..this is the LEAST they can do for a mother !! YOU DID THE RIGHT THING ..somebody had to do it !!|`|Bu6kTnLfaa	i think you had expectations of other people- when you expect something from other people you will get hurt and suffer- there is alot that may have gone on that you may know nothing about. maybe she asked them secretley not to visit or they were hurt by her. either way it was and had to happen that way. You can care for them - but you cannot make their decisions for them. You can talk to them with care but never push people to do what YOU think is right because you may not know the whole story that has been played out. You are a good person for caring- just dont overstep your boundaries by tellin gpeople what to do- offer a suggestion and if they dont take it accept it for what it is as again you may not know the whole story------equinimity|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	I can't understand the attitude that her children took but you did nothing wrong and you must accept that they have different priority's than most of us.|`|eWObKmBSaa	Your telling them that someone should be ther wasn't bad.<br>  They were hurt and scared and didn't know what to do.  Where was her husband?
EQ8HCI0Haa	If your in love, your just different, everything about you is different, from your speech pattern, to your eye contact with people, your confidence level is high, and its just an amazing feeling, so ppl can see you and as soon as you interact with them, they notice all this stuff..(which gives the assumption of you being in a relationship), <br>  <br>  why i think like this is because i have noticed this in ppl in love.. and now im noticing this in myself since i fell in love a few month back.. !|`|eV2MU9edaa	well... it can be just a guess<br>  <br>  good luck|`|IqqaA2wIaa	yes but it wont do any good when he is 1200 mis away....i married someone else.....men should pursue ....if they dont, then they dont care|`|DhUMjZxtaa	no..|`|pRTFjaK4aa	well, i wouldn't fall in love for my friend, for instance, this girl back in college.  but, if i happened to run into her i'd talk to her.  but, that doesn't mean i'll fall in love with her.|`|KctBmSNtaa	Um, it depends how close you are to them. And how obvious your facial expressions are.|`|taSJfoUAaa	if u were good friends maybe but other wise probably not or u  like eachother maybe idk ummmmmm ya|`|seqEdwwnaa	no i honestly dont believe they can tell if you are in love or not....everyone has a different way of showing it...they dont know how you do if they havent been around you for months
bGwLMEnJaa	I'm guessin your from the city, or maybe not? <br>  <br>  Looks like you don't have much choice about having a few friends that you choose and have no problems, like  a kid from a small town (ie me)  The real problem is the "clique" thing. I'm sure thats all you know. I'm guessing respect have alot to do with it. The most respect anyone can get from someone thats intelligent is through words. Say the right words, and people will respect your ground. If they don't, then pick the ones who care and respect you the most. Thats also know as "POWER."  Fighting can bring positive results, but not the most beneficial or meaningful in the long run.|`|uA4tJuZbaa	I'd try to remain neutral, but if you can't...<br>  Choose the group that you feel most comfortable with and that you think will stand by you and stay your friends during tough times in the future.|`|CPZA5qrGaa	You are mature enough to know you are capable enough to have friends in both groups. When one is forcing you to choose,...that <br>  would be the group to educate in the field of friendships.<br>  Friendships are more powerful in numbers and not less than.<br>  If neither side doesn't get into trouble then there shouldn't be any reason to choose. Try explaining to the groups you like both groups and you want to be part of both groups.|`|PyRxe9B2aa	Start your own group. Only let people who can get along with everybody in. Make being a smart and good looking person necessary to belong. Call yourselves  a great name and let in as many people as you can. Put out people who start trouble. Give it a try.
K4bJgTF4aa	I was 13 when my brother got married.  i was the junior bridesmaid.  It will make her feel proud to have her own title.|`|x5avs3gnaa	I would probably consider anyone 14 or under to be a junior bridesmaid, but you could totally just call her a bridesmaid.  Really, it's just a title. She's still going to be in your wedding and so it'll be special for that.  Besides, I think it's just so that people know when they look at the itenerary (if you print one) that she's in there as a bridesmaid, whether it's junior or not. It's just a formality. Good luck.|`|TnHl3Heoaa	a junior bridesmaid for sure. at 13 she wouldnt even have the womans body needed to wear a bridesmaid dress.<br>  the age line is typically at 16 or 17.|`|KfKr3hUmaa	13, a bridesmaid.

Anyone 16 and under should be a jr. bridesmaid, in my opinion.|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	I would ususally consider 16 or older to be a bridesmaid, but if your sister is your only attendant, I don't see that you need to make a distinction.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	10-17 is a junior bridesmaid. 18+ is a bridesmaid|`|3c8GsRvUaa	18 to be a brides maid cause they need to sign the document and she can't legal then if she not 18.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	Junior, not ever close.|`|q8eue7CRaa	Being old enough to be responsible to help financially and emotionally and all of that. A 13 year old would be a junior bridesmaid. I'd say 18 and up is bridesmaid (maybe if they are mature, a 16 year old could be bridesmaid). I'd think you'd need to be able to drive, have a credit card, and be all 'grown up' to be a bridesmaid opposed to jr bridesmaid. (And having the body to fill out the adult dress.)|`|f547b0547924b21590b8ffb102004fdeaa	Does it really matter what you call her? She's your sister and she's one of your two attendants. I would just classify her as a bridesmaid, but that doesn't have to mean anything in particular about how she's expected to help. Normally, if it was a more distant relative and there were several other adult bridesmaids I would consider a 12 or 13 year old a junior bridesmaid. My sister is 16 and she will be my maid of honor. If I had gotten married last year when she was only 15, she still would have been.|`|fb52aec114b2a6279348a5cf16976b41aa	Normally I'd say jr. bridesmaid, but since she is your sister, and the only bridesmaid, just call her a bridesmaid. It will mean a lot to her too. You could call her the maid of honor too. You'd have a matron of honor, then a maid of honor. No bridesmaids. That would work and both would feel special. Your matron of honor would stand next to you and then she would stand next in line.|`|87pV5lvZaa	A junior bridesmaid.  I would consider someone a bridesmaid at age 15.<br>  <br>  P.S. In response to a previous post: only the maid/matron of honor has to sign the wedding certificate, so she alone would have to be 18 or older.  (Good point, though).|`|heCuvfPSaa	I would have to say bridesmaid....But you choose it's your wedding.

a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	some girls mistake drama and fighting all of the time with love, also it lies within your self worth, thinking this is all u deserve out of life. maybe u think the good men are boring, and u need this in your life to be happy. sometimes the heart wants what the heart wants no matter what the circumstances might be. are u young and just haven't had much experience with men? everyone has their own idea of what they want out of life, and don't really care if they are abused, or if they have financial stability. doesn't make u bad, just foolish. because sooner or later u are going to realize that this is just such a waste and u will realize that u have to give up so much when u settle for someone who Drinks all of the time, and who lives with mom. maybe its because u also like this lifestyle because birds of a feather do flock together. they are alike in their likes, and their habits.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Do you want your ex because of who he is (good qualities) or because you enjoy being with an alcoholic.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with loving someone because of who they are, even if they happen to have a drug/alcohol addiction.  I suspect the "normal" guys you were with didn't do it for you because of who they are/were, not because they weren't abusive alcoholics.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	It definitely falls back to the parent thing.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	some possibilities:<br>  you are bored with your life and you are looking for excitement in the form of drama in a relationship.  <br>  <br>  You need to the "the healthy one/the together one" or "the martyr" in a relationship and this may be why you are only attracted to substance abusing losers.  it's a type of munchausen-like disorder.  You may get off on the sympathy you get from outsiders because of all the suffering you do in your relationships.<br>  <br>  You may be repeating a dynamic from your childhood that you had with one of your parents.  The subtext will be something along the line of "if I can get him to do ____, then I am lovable and worthy of having a decent partner and mommy or daddy was wrong."<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  Daddy issues also come from the father just not being involved in the child's life.  He can still be married to mom but if he's working all the time and never present in the home then it can and does have the same effect on certain personality types as dad disappearing never to be seen again.  Also not all bad relationships are about "daddy" sometimes it's about "mommy".<br>  <br>  But I'll trust you that you have a healthy relationship with both of your parents and that you don't have "daddy or other parent issues" then I'm going with the boredom theory as my first choice.<br>  <br>  Think about what you want to accomplish in your life.  Once you have a clear idea of what it is you want and you start going after it then the excitement of pursuing your dreams should take over for the drama.<br>  <br>  If you have a clear idea of what you want out of life and are actively pursuing it then I'll go with the martyr theory and say that you need to be standing next to a loser so that you look better by comparison or because you get a thrill from people feeling sorry for you having such rotten luck with men.<br>  <br>  making poor choices in partners is not always about a bad childhood.|`|QCmRRbABaa	It is very confuse to be in a relationship with an abusive man, until you learn how to handle out the problem.

Or check your local library for self help books on co-dependency issues / disfunctional relationships. Sounds like you definitely have some co-dependency issues. Or you want to fix this guy.  I am not judging because I have been in a disfunctional relationship in the past and was so caught up on the idea of things working out instead of realizing the facts. It becomes like a fantasy of what you want things to be like instead of what they are. It is a hard pill to swallow to admit when you have problems as well.

You spent five years of your life with this man and don't want to throw that all away, but the hard truth is, it's very, very unlikely he will change. Even after you left him he still hasn't made any positive changes in his life. After I broke up with my abusive ex (I also didn't have any issues with my father) I decided not to date ANYONE for at least six months so I could clear my head. I learned that it's ok to be single and I rather enjoyed it. I made up my mind about what qualities I wanted in a man and stuck to them. Just because you date a few guys and it didn't work out doesn't mean there isn't anyone else out there that will work out. Give it some time.

That is who he is, and that is what he values.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	first you are right you should never be terrified second he thinks you were going out with someone else this was a warning to you my advice look else where you are on a dead end road|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Well, well, where do I begin.  Your terrified of this guy, he has been violent with you, he has been arrested a few times, but he justifies his behavior with telling you that he loves you, a lot.  Do you not see any red flags here, because I see so many I can not see the future for you.  Abusers have a wonderful way of making everything they do to you, your fault.  My dear, your in for a wild ride, that's true, but I would not be surprised if it is not in an ambulance, but hey, at least he will tell you how much he loves you as they load you up to take you to the hospital.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	WTF is the matter with you?<br>  <br>  This guy sounds like a FIRST CLASS LOSER!<br>  <br>  5 years down the road you'll have three kids with this bum and he will be beating your azz and you'll be on here asking us "How can I leave him"???<br>  <br>  Mark my words!
0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Don't get sunk into his "I Love You's." It's just an excuse so he can continue getting pissed off at you. Don't ever let him GRAB YOU, he does not rule over you, and if he hangs around with his "Very rough crowd" than you can certainly go out with YOUR Friends. Violence does not make for a good relationship.....Dump Him. You have answered your own question.|`|cA3DDRGraa	He will never change. If you like the way you are living then stay with the S O B. If you don't think you can do this the rest of your life, then leave is funky ***. I would have been gone 6 months ago.<br>  <br>  gram|`|AAgX0SDcaa	If you are scared of him now, just wait until you marry him. Men like that are possessive as it is, give him a piece of paper called a marriage license and he will believe he owns you like a piece of property.|`|di6p10Ifaa	You need to understand something. This is not about love at all. Love is not being okay with abusing someone or accepting abusive behavior. Don't mistaken his controlling ways for love, that is a huge mistake many women make.<br>  <br>   This is about control and obsession. This relationship is clearly unhealthy. The best thing to do is just to get out now before you are legally tied to this man and are pregnant with two black eyes. My dad was abusive to my mom. They went through counseling and he was better but he just went back to his old ways after about a year or so. I could slap my mom for staying and exposing us to that. I don't know why she didn't leave. Get out now before it gets complicated.|`|AA11509996	He acts like a violent animal beating up people like that...and you still want him? It sounds like he'll beat you too if you give him a good enough reason in his sick head. <br>  <br>  He has issues, your mother has issues and you have issues if you stay with him....CRAZY!|`|ow4Ec8eqaa	All I can say is GET AWAY  FROM HIM SOON.  You think you love him but it's all a fantasy and a need being met.  <br>  Honey, value you yourself.......<br>  You deserve soooooo much more.<br>  God loves you and you are precious and priceless to be <br>  dealing with this mess.<br>  Take care.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	you asked this before. Like i said last time dump him.  find someone else. get out as soon as you can|`|Ka7CVRYsaa	THAT'S NOT THE WAY LOVE GOES.<br>  YOU NEED TO FIND SOMEONE WHO WILL TRULY LOVE YOU!!!!<br>  LEAVE HIM AND YOU MAY HAVE TO PUT A RESTRAINING ORDER!!!|`|80A6iHoGaa	I think you should probably leave before you get hurt or even killed...GL|`|vCZuh3oDaa	Run away.  Fast.|`|BNNzCqhIaa	You are in a dangerous situation and you need to get out of it as soon as your safe- and you need to make sure he will not find that you are asking people these questions (delete your browser history hide your passwords etc) I worked at a domestic violence shelter not too long ago and all too many women described the first signs like you have just explained. I know it's not as simple as walking out because the cycles of a relationship like this are addicting and hard to escape from. He might not be a terrible guy but if he's already acting like this, imagine what will happen when you want a little space or when he gets more comfortable with you and loses his temper. There are several ways you can leave but I must warn you to do it carefully. Call the national domestic violence hotline at 1.800.799.7233 or if you are disabled 1.800.787.3224 (TTY). Even if you don't think it is domestic violence they will give you tips and support. No one can tell you to leave but you need to figure out what is best for yourself. You have your whole life ahead of you. You don't want to get hurt or have your family get hurt or your future children. Be careful and know there are a million people out there who will support you. Feel free to email me as well. I may not know exactly what you are going through but I'd love to help support you through it. And remember to delete your search history/cookies etc. Good luck. There are people out there to help you.|`|x5avs3gnaa	It sounds like you need to try and get out of the relationship (taking careful steps not to make matters worse - you don't want him coming after you, but you can't stay in the situation either). I would suggest getting supportive friends and family on-board and have them help you figure out how to go about doing that. This guy sounds like a creep and who's to say that he would not get more violent with you if you guys ever got into marriage or had a kid or something like that. Good luck.|`|zyAr5BIMaa	If your this scared you should really consider leaving. Anyone who grabs you and makes you scared of them is not a healthy relationship.|`|d27c5Bodaa	Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire? You would be Latika in this situation with that chief thug guy. I don't think this guy really loves you, I think your just something to have for him. One day you should just leave, move out, go to a different state, change your phone number and NOT tell him. Like you said you're only 25, fix your life while you still can. <br>  <br>  I think by randomly grabbing you and holding you against a wall a couple of times he's realizing that you're not permanent, you could leave at any time and the longer you take to leave the easier it'll be for him to keep you there. Remember you're your own person not his. Don't be tied down.|`|d5e2cf1011c4b52a77043737e2ec0ea7aa	You're weak & setting a bad example for women everywhere.  Your man sounds like a p*ssy.  He thinks he's all bad @ss & intimidating?  LOL!  Does he kick puppies too so he can feel powerful?  You're an idiot.  Sorry.  Is there even a question here or are you just trying to get sympathy?  What do you mean "what did he mean by doing that"?  Uhh, I wasn't there.  Did you ask him?|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	and your still with him  WHY??? you not only need to stay away from his crowd, you need to stay away from him.  move out, change your phone number, do whatever it takes to get away from him.  he has forcibly restrained you more than once.  that isnt love, thats a scare tactic.<br>  <br>  leave honey.  ANY bit of violence against you is too much|`|QVJ0CwNtaa	You're right, you don't need to be scared of someone who is meant to love you. Thats not right.<br>  <br>  I grew up with a stepdad who did the same sort of things as your bf is doing, and its all about control. They like to feel needed, they like you to be theirs, and dont understand before violence that you aren't just for them, you aren't in exsistence for them however much you might love them - you're in control of your own life, and i know it's hard, but don't let him control you.<br>  <br>  I am guessing that what he did the other night holding you and staring at you before you went out is just another sign of the control and possesion he wants over you without really realising what he is doing is because of this. You deserve to go out with your friends and I wasn't there obviously, but from here it seems that it was an attempt to get you to stay like he felt he had the control and he expected you to check with him first. Well done for still going out - <br>  <br>  In my opinion, growing up in a household and both observing and going through being pushed around and belittled - if you stay you'll get tinier and tinier. You might not realise until its so bad you're half the person you used to be - so well done for recognising now. The next step, in all honesty, is to get as far away from that man as possible. Get your money and go. Move to a friends or back to your parents for a short stay before you can get on your feet again, and don't give him a second thought. He is supposed to love you, protect you, and he is treating you wrongly. <br>  <br>  What if things escalate? Not only could he become physically abusive towards you, emotionally abusive, make you financially dependant on him (hiding joint money, credit cards etc) he will stop you having a life. The previous episode will be the tip of the iceberg - what if he makes you have no contact with your friends, family and therefore outside help and support for the abusive situation you may find yourself, and he'll will moniter your internet activity, your money, the messages you have sent from your mobile and will be the only one with the keys to the windows and doors. This might seem like a very serious case of abuse, and it is, but you never know what the future holds - especially if you're terrified of the man who is supposed to love you.<br>  <br>  You don't have to do anything we say. But listen to what everyone is telling you. You CAN get away if you want to or feel the need to. It might take a bit of planning and living with friends of family for a little bit, but wouldn't it just be worth it? And remember, if he physically abuses you no matter how much you love him it's wrong for him to do it and you don't have to keep it secret - call the police and get yourself some protection.
Uwj2mUgkaa	If you like his personality, give yourself some time to grow physically attracted to him. If you love him, you'll find yourself attracted to him. A lot of relationships start out like that.|`|m2WGmGXjaa	It depends on how shallow you are really. For some people the personality is enough for them, they love them for exactly how they are. For other, more shallow people they need that physical attraction or it'll never work. So really you've got to decide whether YOU believe if he's, well for lack of better words, good enough for you in your eyes and whether or not you can be without that physical attraction.|`|GrCj35muaa	most attraction starts with physical appearance and grows from there. however it can work the other way around. If you really care about it, he will grow more physically attractive to you.|`|ZfHCnWAnaa	I think thats going to intefere in the end. If you just like his personality, then you and him should just be friends.|`|H3h4j4aKaa	if you like him then there is nothing wrong|`|a6j0cwgqaa	I think you have the right idea! the reason that is said is because if you're not physically attracted to him, you may have the tendency to cheat!! If you are loyal 100% then its fine!!|`|gLXzVbm8aa	i think its ok because a lot of cute guys are jerks so i would rather date an ugly guy who will treat me right|`|ixDTI97Aaa	Attraction works differently for women than for men.  Men feel physical attraction first - everything else follow after that.  Women tend to focus on the emotional, intellect and mental first.  The physical attractiveness happens last. <br>  You have the basis of something really good.  As you become closer, his inner beauty (that you see now) will expand to the rest of him.<br>  Relax and enjoy!|`|zrARzUTPaa	no its perfectly ok to not be attracted to your bf....as long as you like him for his personality and well being. looks arent everything...but they do help|`|ojiO3svoaa	i spent 2 1/2 years with someone i was not pphysicallyattracted to. in the end i did need that connection.|`|SjD1aKT5aa	At the end of the day if he makes you happy who cares about looks too tough.<br>  <br>  :] Kiki
cuIX13BKaa	When I (yes you guessed it....a Virgo) fall in love..and that is NOT worn on my sleeve btw.....it always is never love at first anything. It is usually either a comfy hello or one of those..."That poor guy...how does he handle it..he must be really smart!" kind of thing....I can be in love and not realize it for months. This is the truth...I have no time for BS flirting, as all of that crap has to be undone....but once I fall...it is the echo of the memory of 'The Voice' ..... I cannot deny that fact..looks come last to me. Compassion first...honesty all the goodies! It is much like walking down the street and getting hit in the head with or by a brick ~ it was always coming, I just didn't quite see it before it knocked me to the ground....once in love I admit it right away....for i have nothing to lose...at that point...I say" Guess what...the strangest thing hhappenedto me...." and proceed with the story. Not one time have I been told to go away ~ I do NOT fall easily. I may be a fallen woman...but as of the moment I have not fallen now ~ in fact i am desperately trying to fall OUT of it.....I am very into public displays of affection, laughing, impulse...all of the atypical anti Virgo things ~ and I love it that way..I am faithful, carry a secret to my grave.....and care beyond belief that love can be so incredibly wonderful.<br>  <br>  Garbo|`|08y217Rdaa	Sun sign astrology is weak. There are many aspects that you need to consider. And "ice" is not the correct term here. I feel many things, for example. I just do not show.|`|ixDTI97Aaa	When they start taking care you.  They will org anise your things, your schedule, your washing, etc.  They will also start criticizing the way you do things, say things or even think -suggesting ways to do it better.  This is all done as a way of making your life easier and better.<br>  Be careful - not all virgo's are shy - most of them will take a while to warm up, but then they really cook!|`|4YK4tBW5aa	When you were born has nothing to do with it. Astrology is superstition. Maybe ask in the astrology section if you want some answers from true believers.|`|SjD1aKT5aa	True say Melanie, and I wouldn't know what there like in love.<br>  <br>  <br>  :] Kiki|`|YdjU4KqBaa	if you are a virgo then you know better than any of us .. and if your bf is a virgo ..again you should know better .....|`|hKyOUVXIaa	I have never seen one in love. They usually hit a girl fast and hard and then leave her once she falls in love.<br>  <br>  The Virgo men I have met are made of ice.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Dammit Jim, I'm a doctor not an astrologer.<br>  <br>  Ask in horoscopes, we're just Dr. Phil up in here.
451749b90771b2314d051b59fda1e3eeaa	Uhm, yeah I suppose you could really love him, but you must have not been thinking about him or his feelings at all when you did that. The best thing you can do is come clean with him and just see what happens. It may not work out or he may give you another chance..that all depends on how he takes it and I bet he will not take it very well at all...|`|AA10717784	tell him cause you you did not love him enough to do that to him if you love him how can you do that to him he may take you back he may leave you it is up to him|`|34e9e9fe0d4bc19d020a1064cd382799aa	no.....if you did that you have no right to stay with you're boyfriend......and you should feel bad.....that was WRONG.....if you're boyfriend knows about this i don't think he should put up with it.....oh and 1 more thing you must not really love him or you wouldn't be having    ual relations with your so called "friend"<br>  <br>  i didn't mean to offend you in any way.....|`|8IzOPJuoaa	yeah you can! that other girl is dumb. but you did make a HUGE mistake. i mean i personally wouldn't take someone back who cheated on me. but you need to tell him and you need to tell him it didnt mean anything. it's gonna be hard, but it might work out. if not then you really messed up :/ sorry. then you just need to move on.

Anche con la sorella c'è stata un'amicizia bellissima ma da quando si e sposata e cambiata tantissimo e allora ci si sente poco,mentre con lui e rimasto un bel rapporto,anche se ormai abitiamo in città diverse,ci sentiamo sempre ed ogni occasione e buona per stare insieme! Poi ho un altra amica che l'ho conosciuta a scuola e lei pensa è diventata mia zia! Perchè si è sposata con un mio zio, ovviamente molto giovane io ho 24 anni mio zio 30!E quindi con lei fino ad oggi i nostri rapporti sono ottimi,ma non perchè e diventata mia zia ma proprio perchè tra noi c'è una bella amicizia! Il resto degli amici con cui giocavo quand'ero piccola,non so nemmeno che fine abbiano fatto.Con alcuni quando ci incontriamo ci si limita al ciao come stai,niente di più!

CPaRXWfFaa	Un rapporto come tu dici "perfetto", non può essere che finto (ma cos'è poi la perfezione) ?, dove uno dei due si adegua troppo all'altro.  I  rapporti reali sono fatti anche di scontri, di incomprensioni che possono sempre essere risolti se si è disposti ad incontrarsi più o meno a mezza strada|`|0mDPQ841aa	meglio un rapporto sincero e complice, gli alti e bassi sono normali a volte.|`|542f8d66d4753604f5acba25ba21767daa	Io preferisco il primo, qualche litigio, incomprensione o divergenza ogni tanto anima il rapporto. Quello perfetto non esiste, o per lo meno lo è solo perchè qualcuno si piega al volere dell'altro... è impossibile che due o più persone la pensino sempre sempre sempre allo stesso modo... quella volta che c'è veramente un'idea contrastante è il bello che scoppia...|`|Ew29qRBnaa	una via di mezzo!|`|MfBTNvpNaa	alti e bassi.........i rapporti veri sono come le montagne russe...un attimo sei in cima e l'attimo dopo scivoli in basso....|`|QRBlCix9aa	io ho avuto tutti i 2 rapporti che dici tu... io credo che sia meglio il secondo... è chiaro il rapporto perfetto non esiste ma mi ricordo che con the love of my life ci capivamo alla perfezione e se avevamo dei problemi li risolvevamo tra noi...|`|YUep2a1daa	l'amore non è bello se non è litigarello mi diceva mia nonna...è meglio conoscersi che mascherare le cose!!! quando verranno fuori sarà troppo tardi!! preferisco stare un giorno male con la mia ragazza, almeno sto problema si risolverà e si potrà andare avanti!!

L'amore si dice che non è bello se non è litigarello, ed è vero, perchè si ha l'occasione di scontrarsi per discutere di un qualcosa, non rendendo il rapporto piatto. E poi a me non piacerebbe se tutti fossero d'accordo con me, perchè non ci sarebbe quella bellissima cosa che si chiama personalità e ci rende unici...<br>  Ciao e scusa per l'altra risposta, non avevo capito la domanda, c'era un "non" che non avevo letto<br>  Ciao|`|2BuIRozmaa	quando un rapporto è troppo perfetto non è vero.....e vuol dire che qualcosa non va.....in un rapporto vero...ci sono come dici tu...dubbi e incomprensioni....un bacione|`|01a703d1ed8fbad2ebc681927bc31cb0aa	Preferisco la prima ipotesi, il secondo può andar bene all'inizio ma alla lunga diventa un rapporto piatto e monotono, che gusto c'è a fare una discussione se poi l'altro ti dice sempre si ok.|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	sai preferisco un rapporto burrascoso...sono fatta così!perché così io e lui ci scontriamo..ma dopo la riappacificazione é dolce!!!a volte ci picchiamo anche (per gioco)|`|Qh3DA27paa	Se per perfetto intendi finto, ovviamento è meglio il rapporto vero.

gtTDYsiBaa	just start by asking her how it was and if she had fun, also say that you missed her!|`|3zJ3eWteaa	So where there any mother f'in snakes on your mother f'in plane?|`|QUzPJJcnaa	you should start off by asking her how her vaca was so shes not silent for the first half of your conversation and then u slip in the joke after that it should be a smooth conversation =)|`|wmSSkOeZaa	Say something that is a joke but yet a compliment.  Like, if she's been to the beach, say " Hey, while you were at the beach, we had really cold weather here."  She'll be like "Really?" Then you can say some comment like, "Yeah, you were gone, so all the hotness was too."  Or something like that....you can figure it out.  If you guys aren't quite on that level yet, just start out w/ something caring-- how much you missed her & whether she enjoyed her trip.  Good Luck!
87777f14a4e8685001a8b52b4b5a8ec7aa	I would say take her to her favorite restaurant. Open her doors, pull out chairs, don't ask her to pay for anything. don't pressure her into anything. perhaps bring her some of her favorite flowers...ask permission at the end of the date to kiss her but don't be offended if she says no..|`|MOiYxeezaa	If the weather is nice, find something to do outdoors...make some of her favorite foods and have a picnic at a park, go walk on the beach if there's one nearby, that sort of thing.  If she's into art or history, take her to a museum.  If she's an active girl, take her hiking or go rent some jetskis.<br>  <br>  Basically, find out what she likes and try to do something creative that incorporates it.  There's nothing wrong with dinner and a movie, but it's pretty standard fare.  Also, don't go overboard with flowers or tell her that you love her, that's coming on too strong for a first date.
RGtLhZV0aa	Wow thats really romantic!!! thats really a great place to ask her! Before you go down say "your a fantastic girl and I really like you..will you be my girlfriend?" if theres enough time.. if there's not, shorten it up a bit. Good luck!!!    :)

HkvpUR7Zaa	Dolce Tali...lascia stare Melissa...forse lo fa solo perchè non ha altro da fare e quindi un motivo valido non ce l'ha.<br>  Certi utenti che denigrano gli altri solo perchè magari hanno opinioni diverse dalle loro non sono degni LORO di rimanere su Answers.<br>  Io non conosco questa Melissa, quindi non posso sputare sentenze su di lei, posso solo avanzare delle ipotesi, nemmeno con una granchè valida tesi. Se qualcuno conosce questa Melissa ha tutto il diritto di difenderla o meno.<br>  Posso solo confortarti con queste poche parole...per il resto non posso fare molto...comunque è successo anche a me, ma io sono stata direttamente bloccata senza un perchè.

Chi sa confrontarsi civilmente, chi si confronta ma realmente non lo accetta (e vuole la ragione dalla sua parte) e chi invece proprio non sa confrontarsi e blocca gli utenti. Ma questi ultimi, se non sanno confrontare le proprie opinioni con quelle altrui...cosa stanno a fare qui in Answers???<br>  Answers è un luogo per dare e ricevere consigli, scambiare opinioni, sogni, interessi.

z9ebZQN7aa	secondo me perchè amare è la cosa più bella del mondo,  e quando lo scopriamo per la prima volta non riusciamo più a farne a meno. Quindi quando le cose in amore vanno male sentiamo la mancanza di quelle sensazioni così forti, del cuore che ti batte a 2mila battiti al minuti, delle farfalle nello stomaco. Quando hai sensazioni così forti, così belle, così intense, non riesci più a farne a meno, ne senti troppo la mancanza.<br>  Una persona che non ha mai amato e non amerà mai. per paradosso. sarà sicuramente più serena delle altre, vivrà una vita piatta ma stabile mentre le altre hanno i picchi di entusiasmo e delusione.|`|0a7261584683b7e3c7cbc59a20ecc9b3aa	è vero che fa anche soffrire. però forse dovremmo misurarlo a posteriori.<br>  <br>  mi spiego meglio. credo che per poter esprimere un giudizio serio sull'amore, dobbiamo valutarlo esaminandolo a lungo termine e trando un bilancio solo alla fine. <br>  Sono convinto, cioè, che i nostri nonni siano più attendibili di noi (con tutte le dovute differenze generazionali)<br>  <br>  ciao|`|9rQcwjV9aa	Ecco, riflettiamo con il sommo Virgilio il quale  nell'Eneide attribuisce all'amore, forza di vita, azioni insensate, dolore e sofferenza:<br>  <br>  "Crudele amore, a che cosa non costringi gli animi mortali!

noKGdVjWaa	Ciao dike, ti rispondo esattamente come ho risposto ad un'altra ragazza che ha posto la tua stessa domanda.<br>  Innanzitutto sono convinta che l'amicizia tra uomo e donna possa esistere. A patto che si rispettino certe regole e che ci siano i giusti "ingredienti" perché possa funzionare: reale fiducia, enorme rispetto e ovviamente se non c'è attrazione fisica è meglio ancora.<br>  Difficilmente quando c'è reale amicizia, scatta il desiderio di avere qualcos'altro; ancora meno l'amore.<br>  A qualcuno è accaduto, quindi è possibile. <br>  A me per fortuna mai, ma in tal caso reagirei con molta serenità.<br>  Col mio migliore amico, ad esempio, ho uno splendido rapporto di amicizia di lunghissima data e di fiducia e rispetto estremi. Di conseguenza ho la libertà assoluta di parlargli sempre apertamente e senza giri di parole.<br>  La prima cosa che gli chiederei e' da quanto crede di provare certi sentimenti per me.<br>  A quel punto è logico che se mi dicesse "sono innamorato di te da anni", raggiungerei la conclusione immediata che non è mai stato un vero amico, ma solo un uomo innamorato, che si accontentava di starmi accanto, cercando il coraggio dentro sè per dichiararsi. <br>  Capirei, ma sarebbe una grossa delusione. <br>  E glielo farei presente...<br>  Nel caso in cui invece mi dicesse che il suo presunto amore è nato di recente, cercherei di fare in modo che indaghi sui propri sentimenti, per essere proprio sicuro che sia amore.<br>  Amore è una parola grossa e a volte ci si puo' confondere, perché magari in quel momento si ha bisogno di affetto e si idealizza, fino a credere di amarla, una persona come la migliore amica, solo perché da lei ci si sente compresi etc.<br>  Preso il suo periodo di riflessione, che puo' essere piu' o meno lungo, sono sicura che avrebbe le idee piu' chiare.<br>  Nel caso in cui sostenesse ancora di amarmi, gli direi chiaramente che non posso contraccambiare il suo sentimento, volendogli bene come ad un fratello.<br>  Poi sparirei per un po' e farei in modo che tramite magari altri amici in comune lui si distragga e pian piano ne esca.<br>  Non mi allontanerei per comodità, ma solo perché non potrei piu' aiutarlo e consolarlo da amica nel momento in cui divento la donna che ama e vuole da me ben altro che una pacca sulle spalle. Se gli stessi appiccicata, soffrirebbe ancora di piu' e riuscirebbe a dimenticarmi con piu' difficoltà.<br>  Mi dispiacerebbe rinunciare a lui, ma non potrei certo pretendere che ricopra egregiamente il suo vecchio ruolo di migliore amico se mi ama follemente, solo perché io vorrei aiutarlo o perché avrei bisogno dei suoi consigli e della sua comprensione. Da vera amica, quale mi ritengo, lo lascerei andare e lo farei esclusivamente per il suo bene.<br>  A volte fare la cosa giusta è difficile e bisogna mettere da parte il proprio egoismo, ma paga sempre alla lunga per come la vedo io.|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	io ho un migliore amico maschio...ma purtroppo ehhehe...é anche il mio ex.... potete rispondere a questa domanda?<br>  <a href="http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070710055904AAYsiy1&pa=FYd1D2bwHTHwLL5mE.g4RdJBzgeBpMK7oJjrR5UEtljReg--&paid=asked&msgr_status=">http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|uSwUEBgqaa	Ti rispondo citando un film che mi è piaciuto molto, "Harry, ti presento Sally".<br>  Lui dice che uomini e donne non possono essere amici perchè il sesso ci si mette sempre di mezzo. Lei gli risponde che non è vero, che lei ha un sacco di amici maschi, ma lui ribatte che è lei a vederli come amici mentre loro la vedono in tutt'altro modo. Allora Sally chiede: "Vuoi dire che un uomo può essere amico solo di una donna che non trova attraente?!" ed Harry risponde:"No... di norma vuole farsi anche quella!".<br>  Ti basta come risposta? Baci!|`|391b29c41d910719a245984ae1bb4794aa	Succede quasi sempre che tra migliori amici, lui si innamori di lei. Vedi, il maschio è per certi verso molto territoriale, molto legato al branco: stando insieme agli altri maschi si garantisce sicurezza e potere. Capita naturalmente che trovi in una ragazza affinità tale da non sentirsi vulnerabile e quindi sicuro allo stesso modo, per lo meno parlando da un punto di vista puramente superficiale. Solitamente, ci si trova talmente tanto bene, che comincia a pensare che il rapporto sia qualcosa di più che amicizia. Ma, si tratta di due persone. Se dipendesse da lui, certo, stareste insieme. Ma dipende anche da te. Cosa ti dice il cuore?<br>  <br>  Se ti dice che siete solo amici.. Beh, non dargli modo di illudersi o di fraintendere.|`|8jUu3kKFaa	io ti dico che esiste l'amicizia tra uomo e donna, anche di stampo molto profondo. solo che questo discorso vale per la donna, per l'uomo a quanto pare no! ovviamente poi ci sono eccezioni ed eccezioni. ogni persona ha il suo carattere pertanto interpreta il sentimento d'amicizia secondo il proprio modo di essere. se ne sei sicura che lui si sia innamorato di te, anche se a te lui non interessa da quel punto di vista, io ti consiglio di parlarci....e ricorda una cosa: sono sempre le burrascose storie tra "migliori amici" quelle che possono durar anche tutta la vita! ciaooooooooooo|`|bgxdgV6Eaa	a me è capitato....il mio migliore amiko mi ha detto ke mi ama da sempre...io ci sn rimasta male e gli ho detto ke se è cosi allora mi ha solo preso in giro x tt questi anni e gli ho dtt ke nn lo voloevo piu vedere...adesso è tornato tt come prima piu o meno...xò ho capito ke l amicizia tra uomo e donna è vera solo se lui è gay!..se no spera solo ke prima o poi succeda qualcosa tra di voi...|`|d89da3d9bb2a9f9541c3b04235906ebeaa	Che brutta situazione..beh se non si prova interesse..bisogna dirgli la verità..cioè che non ci sarà mai niente..viceversa nascerebbe una bella storia..io l'ho sempre pensato che l'amicizia tra uomo e donna non esista..alla fine uno dei due si innamora...|`|15a7ac94d38c6ce8b5d58c439c6b189aaa	credo che a volte l'amicizia fra uomo e donna sia davvero sincera... però questo non è uno di quei casi... è la cosa più brutta che può succedere, perchè rappresenta la fine di un'amicizia, sia che tu ci stia si che tu non ci stia... non so che dirti... solo che mi dispiace...|`|ATtQuYWXaa	be se tenessi alla mia amicizia cercherei d evitare d andare a creare un rapporto che va aoltre l' amicizia perche di solito fatto questo passo nn si torna +indietro...cmq secondo nn esiste l' amicizia tra uomo e donna...|`|Ez5xIueOaa	Capisco il tuo amico perchè io sono nella sua stessa situazione...Comunque anninak88 ha ragione: fagli capire che non è ricambiato, ma non abbandonarlo e stagli vicina x fargli capire che comunque non ti perderà mai come amica!<br>  1bacio|`|L5FM2LH4aa	ma visto che lo chiedi e gia un segno d'insicurezza <br>  di conseguenza ti consiglio di allontanarti da lui<br>  finche non hai chiarito le cause della tua insicurezza<br>  perche se tu cedi alla tentazione con questa tua insicurezza<br>  ti garantisco che durera ben poco<br>  <br>  poi decidi tu|`|dD4u3bLHaa	beh....spiegagli che non c'è nulla da fare...o ke si è preso 1 cotta momentanea...non abbandonarlo però..sei 1 amica o cosa????stagli vicino e non illuderlo mai magari passerà e sarà meglio di prima!!!!|`|fyEcJwhqaa	ma va? che bella scoperta...tsk|`|pRgviCP1aa	è una tragedia...per esperienza ti dico che al 90% l'amicizia è destinata a finire, perchè da parte dell'amico non c'è più il sentimento di amicizia, ma altro e passare del tempo insieme equivale a farlo soffrire ancora di più...
dbdfeec6ba21a9dfee0e4320ca771c87aa	cara mia io ho un problema simile: quest'amica mia io la adoro da morire, non so perché, ma c'è qualcosa che mi lega profondamente a lei...lei fa quasi come la tua amica, è parecchio opportunista, spesso e volentieri si sente superiore, è parecchio lekkasedere con i prof (siamo entrambe brave a scuola ma lei ha manie di protagonismo mentre invece a me non frega + di tanto, anche perché in questi anni scolastici ho vissuto molto nella competizione, lei evidentemente no, quindi ha ancora questi atteggiamenti particolari)...ma c'è un fatto...sono io la gelosa! forse perché sono del cancro, e questo segno zodiacale è molto geloso delle sue amicizie più importanti......poi c'è 1 altro lato che mi rende più gelosa ancora...se vuoi conoscerlo contattami in privato...però non riesco a staccarmi da lei!<br>  anyway, te non sei sbagliata assolutamente, l'opportunismo è una assai brutta belva, e te lo dice una che ci ha convissuto per 1 sacco d'anni con amici str... che io ho sempre aiutato negli studi e che mi parlavano male alle spalle come dei vigliacchi...e nel frattempo osannavano altri miei compagni di classe anch'essi bravi, ma che non aiutavano nessuno e non prestavano oggetti personali scolastici come facevo per esempio io...me parevo 'na venditrice ambulante!<br>  fatto sta che sarà forse lontanamente vero che a far del bene un po' ci si rimette...ma io non demordo perché il Signore mi assiste e continuerà a donarmi amore che io effonderò a chiunque mi sta accanto...nel bene e nel male...|`|5WfIMwtLaa	fai bene....evidentemente non è una vera amica se è gelosa,dato che le vere amiche non sono gelose,ma gioiscono con te !<br>  p.s.se usare il telefonino per lei è una perdita di tempo,a che ce l'ha a fare?|`|8jUu3kKFaa	che palle palline, perchè esistono ancora personaggi del genere? io metterei in galera chi li autorizza a mandarli in giro...cmq io ho avuto un esperienza simile...ma la tua non è amicizia dal principio! lo dici tu stessa: "amicizia di convenienza"... io ti consiglio di lasciarla cuocere nel suo brodo....non cercatela più, tanto non risponde no? fate da voi se avete problemi. chi fa da se fa per tre! se lei è racchia e sola evidentemente è perchè i ragazzi sanno come è fatta. lasciatela stare. se vi cerca lei trattatela con freddezza. <br>  ricorda che l'invidia è una brutta bestia, l'invidia predispone a mettere i bastoni tra le ruote....e tu mettigli fuoco a sti bastoni! falla uscire in silenzio dalla tua vita! se poi lei tornerà all'ovile datele un'altra possibilità. se  ricomincia la tiritera allora è il caso di lasciarla perdere per sempre.<br>  ciaoooooooo|`|HCjDYTzWaa	evidentemente avete un concetto dell'amicizia troppo diverso, hai fatto bene, anzi benissimo|`|3z9UR5Osaa	no non fai bene, continua a frequentarlae a diventare matta per lei, massacrando il tuo orgoglio e perdendo il tuo tempo......<br>  <br>  <br>  ....ma certo che fai bene! che domande! e mandala a cagare vah, dille tutto in faccia eanche che non la vuoi sentire....|`|7b6a5381ec758397a34814a88ff6a13baa	NON PENSARE COSI  sii serena con te stessa e cerca sempre le persone migliori  l espressione è spesso lo specchio del animo  non lasciarti andare  e sii  te stessa  fatti rispettare e ti rispetteranno se no,  si cambia e si lascia al vento cio' che non si merita  chi non mi vuole nn mi merita è un detto ma la vita sa regalarti anche momenti belli  ciaooo  baci|`|8M6dJhCKaa	La stai criticando è non hai ancora capito che non si fida in generale delle persone e che si sente insicura, che per difendersi vorrebbe stare da sola, ma che non riesce e teme proprio questo.

j1fg008Yaa	Cara Lady, ti rincuoro. Anche io con la mia attuale signora abbiamo litigato fino al giorno prima (il giorno del matrimonio non ci siamo affatto sentiti fino all'altare :-))))), del matrimonio. Si litigava su tutto a partire dai posti da assegnare al ricevemento fino al ritiro delle bomboniere, fiori addobbi etc. etc. La risposta al tuo dubbio è semplice, difatti sono talmente tante le cose da pensare e organizzare che alla fine la testa scoppia e facilmente si manda a qual paese chiunque. Cmq ormai ci siete. Auguri|`|KZzHJR7Zaa	io sono solo fidanzata, però da 4 anni... credo che un pò sia normale, almeno me lo immagino: controllare che tutto sia a posto, la chiesa, i confetti, il pranzo e il vestito!! credo che l'agitazione sia molta e sopratutto ansia...<br>  ...sai che farei sinceramente al tuo posto? in questo week end andrei a dormire da un'amica e far una festa tra donne (un pigiama party), e poi il giorno dopo andare tutte quante al mare o in montagna, dipende da dove vivi.. almeno ti "deconcentri" da tutto, può fare solo che bene! :)<br>  ehi, ...AUGURIIIIII!!!!|`|QBtfIeltaa	E' la fine del fidanzamento e l'inizio del matrimonio|`|WUYm4lB9aa	Nessuno ti ha regalato delle manette .|`|1256b7d8dcb0382d3b0d9f09e71de601aa	è la tensione nn ti devi preoccupare ... dopo la cerimonia c riderete sopra...|`|28fe23576ff5b7e8d3dd613ae1394d8caa	Sicuramente é lo stress, poi vedrai che passa.....Auguri!!|`|30d2c07b6c691f1843b14949f6b7234aaa	io so k si tratta della cosiddetta"sindrome prematrimoniale"ovvero quel periodo di tempo molto vicino alle nozze in cui si litiga appunto col proprio partner,ma superata la sindrome..tutto passa..;) auguri.|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	è normalissimo!! succede a un sacco di gente!!|`|b92ce56e61622f173abcee5dea2ba8ddaa	Non ricordo con precisione, ma tutte le sere ripassavamo al telefono le cose che erano da fare, e quelle da aggiungere.<br>  Qualche litigatina ci sta, si e' piu' tesi ...... l'abito, la cugina ...... la zia ......... una spesa improvvisa, ...... non accentuate ora queste diverse visioni dei problemi, ne avrete tempo dopo, ma non sara' piu' necessario, sarete in viaggio di nozze ..... dove andate ?<br>  auguri|`|2y6dHPpyaa	quanti anni hai?da quanto tempo state insieme?sei innamorata di lui?<br>  <br>  cmq stai tranquilla..l'importante è ke ti sposi.<br>  è una grossa fortuna!!!<br>  il solo pensiero di passare la vita da soli è deprimente.<br>  tu hai trovato l'uomo giusto.<br>  il vostro litigare è solo dovuto allo stress.<br>  passerà.|`|4Ad1nPyyaa	e successo lo stesso pure a me ma è dipeso tutto dalla tensione dei preparativi e dalla paura di non riuscire a chiudere tutto per il giorno fatidico.

6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Estas seguro que la compu esta da?ada? no seria algo de ella para alejarse más de ti, porque tu mencionas que ella no desea nada más contigo.<br>  <br>  Te aconsejo que este mes pienses más en ti, ya que veo que la idealizaste mucho y ella a ti no, o tal vez si, pero por la distancia ella tal vez penso que era mejor separarse. Si tienes la oportunidad consigue su numero telefónico y la llamas desde un centro de servicio donde no te salga tan costoso, o compra una tarjeta de esas que venden para hacer llamadas a otros  paises y no son costosas, habla con ella, dile que si desea algo más serio contigo, que tu estas dispuesto a viajar. Dependiendo de lo que ella te responda, tomas una desición. Si ella te quisiera de verdad, se iria a un cyber y chatea una vez o dos veces a la semana, así que el que quiere puede porque yo lo he hecho cuando no tengo mi compu.<br>  <br>  Te deseo lo mejor amigo ya que te entiendo más de lo que crees, ya que la persona que amo esta en otro país también aunque chateamos todos los días, hablamos por telefono, nos vemos en la camara, pero no es lo mismo, falta lo carnal, lo fisico y no tanto lo espiritual que es de lo que nos enamoramos. DE LO ESPIRITUAL Y NO DE LO CARNAL.<br>  Y pienso que es lo más importante, lo espiritual que lo físico.<br>  <br>  Suerte y espero todo llegue a un final feliz. Y NO TE ME DEPRIMAS OK, que lo que es del cura va para la iglesia es decir que si ella es tuya lo sera contra viento y marea y aunque este lejos. Acuerdate que el amor rompe barreras y distancias si los dos se aman.<br>  <br>  Bye y besitos.  y te envio una estrellita para que no estes triste, acuerdate que las cosas pasa por algo, a lo mejor ella no te conviene y tienes a tu media naranja más cerca de lo que piensas y no te haz dado cuenta.|`|m7zjaA1Qaa	amiguito si kestas colao super enamorao eeee, yo sabs ke te recomiendo buscate un jovi, juega al futbol, ala play lo k sea pero estate entretenido, y pco poco iras pensando menos en ella.<br>  <br>  un besito y suerte|`|47265630cd64aaf5dfae85cfb1430ff9aa	uy ke retedificil te la pones<br>  <br>  pues date una vuelta por su pais...y convencela en persona<br>  despues si las cosas komo ke ves ke funcionan buscas como kedarte|`|a2c22536cd5bda250cdd4cf4c38b5385aa	valor amigo el tiempo cura todo y todo pasara mejor entretente en una actividad o sal a pasear o que se yo tan solo mantente activo y poco a poco iras dejando ese recuerdo en el pasado suerte.|`|f7418727ed3bbf8595e81a3439c02134aa	haciendo algo que realmente pongas todo tu responsabilidad,como hacer una cirugía,o atender un parto,no tienes tiempo de pensar en otra cosa.t.q.m.|`|spfKuZbpaa	wow esta historia la conozco!!!|`|6FirEY3Waa	Te comprendo,amigo,yo he estado como tú,se sufre un montón y parece que nunca mas vas a poder dejar de amar y pensar en esa persona que cuanto mas piensas mas la adoras...primero yo te diria lo que he hecho:buscarla,ir a su pais,y decirle todo lo que sientes,(tambien puedes hacerlo por carta),has preguntas directas,concretas,así puedes tener una respuesta clara.<br>  Si es no,no te desanimes,aunque parezca que jamas saldrás de esa pena,el tiempo cura todos los dolores,incluídos los del corazón,los que nos producen los amores no correspondidos.<br>  No te encierres en casa,busca a tus amigos,diviertete<br>  eso te ayudará,y cuando tengas ganas de llorar llora,eso<br>  alivia.Veras que con el tiempo la herida cicatrizará y encontraras a tu chica del alma.<br>  Animo! y suerte.Un besito|`|PIOIgdcaaa	huyyyyyyyyyyy <br>  huyyyyy  huyyyyyy, <br>  <br>  ya me asustastes amigo!!!!!!! dime Quien eres?

Non è che lei si comporta in modo anomalo, quello è il suo vcarattere, la sua natura e se a te non vè è segno che non c'è alcuna affinità tra voi ed è il caso che tu frequenti amiche che siano un tantino più compatibili con il tuo carattere.

Obviamente se tienen que cuidar, porque si no planean casarse pronto puede que algo salga "mal". Lo mejor para decidirse a hacerlo es hablarlo, preparase y estar concientes de que despues de que lo hagan ya no se puede deshacer, y eso va a crear un vinculo entre ustedes muy importante.

Malo si se te cayera algo, o se te pudriera AQUELLO(eso solo pasa si no usas condon), no es malo, no es cuestion de religion ni nafa de eso, es cuestionde madurez, de confianza con tu pareja, sde estar segura de saber que eso es lo que quieres y de hacerlo con la persona correcta, con la que sepas que no te arrepentirias despues, por que es algo que no olvidaras jamas,<br>  SUERTE|`|vl1IFbDkaa	pues solamente si estas segura de que sera tu proximo marido sino pues despues te lamentaras y frustraras pero no veo ningun problema si estan seguros de pronta boda adelante y disfruten a lo maximo y asi perderan miedos y ademas empezaran a conocerse mas en ese sentido pero siempre haciedolo con amor y por amor para que asi sea siempre y no lo vean como una necesidad o se haga despues una costumbre siempre por amor|`|yIo3q3Csaa	malo porque????  si dos personas se aman no le veo lo malo el que expresen su amor fiscamente antes de casarse o aun sin casarse.|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Siempre y cuando esten seguros de lo que van hacer y de los cuidados preventivos como preservativos y esas cosas para evitar un embarazo, CREO QUE NO ES MALO.

Si sos católica, hay todo una fundamento que te avala y explica cuál es el sentido de la relación sexual, y tiene que ver con la idea de que Dios, ahí continúa su obra creadora: en el amor de los dos haciéndose uno y permitiendo la voluntad de Dios para el inicio de una vida nueva, es decir un hijo. Pero si no es así, no tiene ningún sentido mas que el de sacarte las dudas, probar si va a funcionar, y todas esas cuestiones......|`|LWBc8bdtaa	no, yo espere 8 a?os para casarme, ni loca hubiera aguantado todo ese tiempo sin tener relaciones.|`|P2ThY9NMaa	Por supuesto que no... Eso es una cosa que impusieron algunas religiones para mantener controlada a la humanidad, el tener sexo es algo natural, y mas aun cuando es con alguien a quien se Ama, como podemos pensar que Dios va estar en contra de algo que es totalmente natural y que es un acto de Amor, cuando es el quien nos creo de esta forma.- saludos.-|`|USjCWMqJaa	yo creo que no es malo, pienso lo importante que son las relaciones sexuales en un matrimonio y creo que si no hay feeling en ese campo en una relacion debe ser muy dificil sostener una pareja. Con esto no estoy diciendo que tenes que probar con todo el mundo antes de casarte, ni que no es lindo llegar virgen al matrimonio, simplemente me pregunto: que pasa si uno se da cuenta, despues de casado, que en la intimidad sexual con esa persona no es lo que se esperaba???<br>  Es un dilema...Que hice yo? Hice el amor con mi novio cuando sentia dentro mio que era el hombre con el cual queria compartir el resto de mi vida, y con el me case. No creo haber hecho mal, no me siento que peque ni nada parecido. No tube relaciones con otra persona, le soy fiel, lo respeto, y lo amo... no creo que Dios este enojado conmigo por eso...<br>  Cuidate y cuando tomes una desicion importante: sè racional y no solo emocional...|`|ddPs385eaa	es una forma de demostrar el  amor creo q para casarte debes amar logicamente!!! luego ya le encuentras el placer y disfrutalo!!!|`|pb0BLh5Zaa	No es malo... es rico|`|u1SDnpFtaa	no cuando lo o la amas y eres corespondido(a), el preoblema es cuando no es asi

You tell him it's okay to live with you and when he goofs off with his sister, you tell him to get out and get a job...and you want to "get back at him"? <br>  Why are you being like that?  Is it not possible to sit him down like an adult and tell him that it's not working out?|`|Z0KQenm9aa	well you need to tell him you shouldnt have yelled out what you did... that him twisting your foot hurt ... that youre angry about the situation but you cant keep going the same path especially since you lost your job... what does he suggest? Of course, something has to be done... and he is 31... No sense in getting back at him, that is just childish and serves no useful purpose... you are the one who enabled him to remain in his lifestyle so take responsibility for your actions and come up with a plan for yourself... hell have to take responsibility for himself.|`|eWObKmBSaa	First if the lease is in your name, why do you leave?<br>  <br>  Second place you should NOT be paying for a place for him to stay.<br>  <br>  If the lease is in his name, probably not if he has no money, MOVE NOW><br>  <br>  IF the lease is in your name, is it up soon, if not GET HIM OUT of your home immediately.  YOu do not need to support your 31yr old brother for one more second.<br>  Stop doing for him, tell him to leave, now.  Give him about 1 day to 1 week and get him out.<br>  Get him out.  It is your place and you need to get him out.<br>  IF the lease is up, like in 10 minutes then wait it out.  OTherwise, tell him to leave NOW< THIS DAY|`|rkFVxFb4aa	Wow, all your doing is enabling your brother to be a loser. You need to kick his *** out and make him realize that he just can't live-off other people, otherwise he'll just keep using you and won't do anything to help himself. Don't feel bad about telling him to get out and get a job, it's the truth why should he be embarrassed? If he was embarrassed maybe he'll get his *** off the couch and contribute something to society. I would kick his *** out is what I would do!|`|mDDUsNG9aa	You should have taken your foot and kicked him square in the *** out the front door!!!!

oJx1sSPxaa	Unfortunately no. The abuse which you are absorbing is a character flaw of his. What comes out of his mouth is probably only 20% of what he is actually thinking. In other words, 80% of the time, he is holding back what he REALLY wants to say. Even if you got counselling and eliminated his outward attacks on you, you have to remember that he is just suppressing his true feelings. This will build up inside him until he blows up, by physically hurting you or saying things so vicious, that you will be damaged forever. You need to get away from him, BEFORE he does any more permanent damage. There is a reason that he in such a dark place, and he would be all to happy to drag you down with him...GL...Kes|`|DwRMnOeAaa	no. there is no such thing as help for an abuser. the scars that the abusee has will never leave. they are there for life. if you are in that relationship, you need to leave. and now. often times, verbal turns into something else which can lead to something very very very serious down the road.|`|c8ef4322c406fcac9b274cbadd912acbaa	No, walk away.|`|fisHNMu4aa	Don't let him abuse you in any manner. Leave him and let him learn his lessons.|`|KdvJmRFeaa	Although many people will say no it is possible if you address it early in the relationship and let him know that it is bothering you....If he doesn't stop after that then it is not worth it.....I know from personal experience!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|VoIxGZUlaa	Usually when someone is verbally abusive to someone means that the person is frustruated with themselves and finds it easy to release their frustruation putting you down...this way he or she is feeling superior to you. You are used as a punching bag and his or her medicine. It sounds cruel but it is what it is. Now will the person change? Well the person has to want change or have an incentive to change. Not too many find self benefit to change because like I said you are their medicine. So why change? You decide...You have to VALUE yourself if not you will wait for changes to happen not knowing what's out there.|`|a5a192b21d7f125dd5dcfd1d00174384aa	No..its only the begining...next will come the physical abuse..its a pattern....get out before it comes to that...good luck|`|d285ade74e02512f86bb9f2a1996a62eaa	No. I have been in a relationship where I was verbally abused all the time. People always say oh they can change, I'll make them change, truth of fact is, when a man has already begun to be this way it won't stop. He will have the seniority over you and make you feel weak. He'll try to bring you to lowest point he can. He'll start verbally and it will turn into physically and emotionally. I work in a mental health facility, I know. Be strong and if your a beliver let go and let God!|`|ElHyqPcraa	no. leave him. it'll will only get worse and maybe even turn to physical abuse. leave asap,  if he's not adding joy to your life and is abusive, why are you still there?|`|52c5c675a3451b42e18d06bc6551dc2daa	No. NEVER. People don't change for their partners. If he does change it'll be for himself b/c he realizes how he is, not b/c u want him to. And don't kid yourself...nothing you can do will make him respect you. Move on. The longer you stay the more he sees that he can get away with it. Every minute longer you stay, you validate his behavior.

LLNlyaFaaa	keep your head up little sister i know how you feel honestly i really and truely do things will get better for us don't worry Daddy was just an ****** to begin with if he doesn't want anything to do with us it's his problem not ours so yeah just keep your head up it's a new year and new day things will get much better and don't forget the sun will come out 2mrrw bet your bottom dollar that 2mrrw there'll be sun!!|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Things will get better in time. Please find someone you can speak to. A teacher or school councelor or someone else trustworthy. Talking is the best option.|`|A5U4EgPJaa	Cheer up, life's what you make it.  Some times us parents are so caught up with our selves we forget what our kids are going through.   I know you have to be young and you might have to grow up faster than you should.   I am sorry that your dad doesn't visit or call you.  You need to sit down with your mom and tell her how you feel, I am sure she will give you the right words to make you feel better.  You also have to support your mother, she might be going through a lot.   Good luck and I hope you find peace soon.|`|jrdtQi04aa	You dont even have your father's phone number?  Wow, no wonder your mom cant really settle anywhere.  Is he helping her out at all?  You may not know.  Look, sometimes life is hard, and stuff sucks, but you have to help your mom out right now, too.  She may not want to move either, and she may have to because of finances.  Look at it as an adventure.  Find a way to make it better for you and your sister.  Try to be there for her because she is probably really upset too. It's hard for you, and I feel for you, but there isnt much you can do but try to get through this the best way you can.  Try helping out your mom and sister, and it will make you feel better.|`|zmkflyoWaa	There is a point in every ones life when they think Why does things always happen to me. It seems as if every one else has good luck but you. I would write your mum a letter and tell her exactly how you are feeling. Then leave it in her room. Don't hold back. Mums aren't always mind readers. Good luck|`|AXbdNdPzaa	You need to talk to your mom, your dad, and possibly a school counselor.  Good luck.|`|twVyisGnaa	I'm so sorry about all this.  Maybe you can make arrangements for you and your sister to stay where you're currently living so you can finish high school there.  As for your dad, find someone who may know his number or you can find it some other way.  Try to have positive thoughts of you and your family staying where you are.  With thoughts, anything can be accomplished.  Think about the 2 things in your life that have been going good for you so far.  That could help your optimism a little more.<br>  <br>  I recommend you 2 books that could really help you out and possibly make you feel better about this situation:<br>  <br>  The Secret by Rhonda Byrne (most benificial for you)<br>  A Piece of Cake by Cupcake Brown.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope things work out for your favor.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!

Mzh3SG8Daa	Il tuo ragazzo ha trovato la frase più squallida e banale che si possa dire ad una persona per finire un rapporto...<br>  Per me è solo una parentesi "estiva" vuole farsi il suo viaggio tranquillo ....ma nello stesso tempo lasciare la porta aperta per una continuazione della vostra storia...al suo ritorno..<br>  Ovviamente non puo' chiederti di andare con lui è come andare al ristorante e portarsi la bistecca..<br>  Se è giovane è normale abbia voglia di fare esperienze per quanto bene ti voglia...ma la novità è sempre più allettante...se invece è un uomo..allora è proprio finita e sta cercando di fartelo capire tra le righe....<br>  Sta a te decidere se lasciargli la speranza di una tua eventuale disponibilità....<br>  Se non riesci..chiamalo tu e digli basta...a quel punto forse si renderà conto, se veramente ti ama..e se vale la pena di far finire un rapporto solo per una vacanza...ma devi poi, essere ferma nelle tue decisioni...e non farti abbindolare da 2 coccoline....sarebbe ricominciare da capo la prossima volta...e perderebbe stima di te....<br>  Sotto sotto agli uomini piacciono le donne di carattere..ricordalo..|`|CUqxNV6haa	purtroppo non credo nella pausa di riflessione...è già spia di qc che non funziona...se tieni tanto a lui cercate di capire cosa non va nel vs rapporto e di trovare una soluzione. Altrimenti...fatti forza e supera il distacco; cerca di distrarti e di non lasciare momenti vuoti nelle tue giornate...così pian piano il tempo passa e pure il dolore si affievolirà...mi spiace, pure una mia amica si trova in quella situazione...già da 3 mesi!|`|NHQLA17Jaa	Mi dispiace dirtelo, ma sinceramente come pausa di riflessione mi pare un pò lunghetta...Oltretutto per esperienza le pause non servono un granchè, se c'è un problama va affrontato, non agirato, per questo non bisogna isolarsi, ma PARLARE! Forse si sente opresso e sta semplicemente scappando da te, ma per non ferirti preferisce aspettare e vedere se le cose cambiano...Perchè non gli proponi di andare INSIEME a maiorca (poi perchè città della perdizione? se uno ti vuol tradire non serve che vada fin li, risparmia e ti tradisce sotto casa^^'). magari questa tua iniziativa può aiutarvi ad aggiustare la situazione....buona fortuna!|`|QPKe9SN2aa	il mio ex ragazzo è andato a ibiza, per lo stesso motivo voleva stare solo.. si , infati, talmente solo che l'ho lasciato perchè mi ha fatto le corna tutto il tempo del viaggio. me lo confessò lui.. trai un pò le tue conclusioni<br>  a proposito.. è un'ex orrmai!! baci|`|6OeRThqMaa	Purtroppo il periodo "vacanze" fà perdere molte volte il contatto con la realtà... capita sovente... anche a me è successo l'anno scorso con il mio ragazzo... non puoi far altro che aspettare... e vedere lui se torna sui suoi passi o meno... poi sarai tu a decidere se tornare con lui o no... certo che però sarebbe una situazione troppo comoda... farsi le vacanze da solo, e poi a settembre tornare come se nulla fosse accaduto... fai occhio a non farti prendere in giro...<br>  Un bacio!|`|I7IvtAoYaa	ah gli uomini sono tutti uguali. mi dispiace per te ma questi ragionamenti mi fanno solo incavolare...il tuo ragazzo è uno stupido per favore se non vuoi soffrire ulteriormente lascialo perdere e trovati uno degno di te!!|`|Rwep4RqHaa	Non lasciare passare troppo tempo!

E' stato cosi' sia quando l'ho presa io la pausa, sia quando l'ha presa un ragazzo con cui stavo, e le storie dopo sono tutte finite.<br>  Fatti rispettare, dai un'ultimatum, o con me o senza di me. Quando si ama veramente non vengono i dubbi, mai!!! <br>  E non esiste che si prenda il tmepo che vuole per divertirsi promettendoti poi di tornare da te..meriti piu' rispetto!<br>  Scusa la brutalita', ma io come te in passato ho creduto alle pause e poi ho aperto gli occhi, e vorrei evitare che gli altri facciano i miei stessi errori!|`|Zr0dcgABaa	io nn credo alle pause di riflessione...sn una stupida scusa... se prendi 1 pausa vuol dire che puoi stare snz di me e allora ciaooooooooooooo!!!!!!<br>  nn t fare imbambolare cn ste cose... apri gli occhi|`|jUA7wME7aa	tu concedigli il tempo che vuole...ascolta, nn gli andare dietro,nn lo chiamare, lasciagli i suoi spazi!!!Lo so ke nn è facile per te però se continui a ossessionarlo rischi di perderlo per davvero...Devi farli capire ke nn sei tu ke stai perdendo lui ma ke è lui ke sta perdendo te,se nn si da una mossa!!!Buona fortuna...Baci!!!|`|bS9q4Jtdaa	Avrà bisogno di un periodo di "libertà" e non metto in dubbio che si potrebbe prendere MOLTA libertà, perchè quando si vuole essere liberi, vuol dire che ci si sente incatenati e.....non lo considererei più tanto cotto di te.

And ask him why it bothers him so much.

Forse è il destino che unisce e che divide. Forse se si ama troppo si finisce col fare il proprio male e nn il bene degli altri. <br>  <br>  Cerca di uscirne almeno tu, io ci sto provando anche se in ogni momento sto male, male da morire, anche se ogni cosa che vedo è una fitta al cuore perchè l'ho gia vista e/o fatta con lui.

Busca el momento adecuado, es decir, cuando sientas que lo está pasando bien contigo y el contexto es favorable. Y planteáselo de la manera que lo sientes, hazle ver que ese sentimiento que ella te transmite es maravilloso y agradécesolo. Coméntale el caso de forma que ella no se sienta en el compromiso de responder, sino de COMPARTIR tu sentimiento. <br>  <br>  Por ello, mi consejo es que trates de quedar en persona (si es ella quien lo propone, mejor que mejor). El hecho de que ella acceda a quedar contigo en persona varias veces y de buena gana. <br>  <br>  Para estos caso, insisto, es más aconsejable ser directo que usar otros medios menos personales (y poco originales) como las flores y la nota. Eso lo puedes dejar para más adelante.|`|8b7941e8391ef2253d74ddfba4cd3042aa	Diga le: Estoy enamorado de ti como burro sin mecate.|`|FVDbztUdaa	se honesto platicale dile que es una persona especial que quisieras conocerla de otra forma mas que de amiga ya que ella es quien te interesa para compartir tus sentimientos que es la que despierta tu lado romántico y si porque no termina todo tu rollo con la pregunta quieres se mi novia? ya que todas esperamos oírla solo necesitas adornarla con el ambiente adecuado y el detalle perfecto de la rosa rosa|`|UFKNAJuSaa	Pues primramnt k tipazo ers pork ahorita n tods s preocupan x eso pero yo creo k el declarartl a una chava con lo tipico y una rosa es suficient.           mucha suerte

Habla de ti o sino preguntale cosas a ella, que vea que le interesas, preguntar no interrogar, así hablara ella y cuando coincidas en algo con ella empieza a hablar tú y  a dar tu punto de vista.. Habla sin pudor, que vea que no te cortas en contarle las cosas como si la conocieras de toda la vida.

bhlN57WQaa	Its natual to still have her in your mind. You guys split up in december and were together for two years! You will eventually stop thinking so much about her but not right away. This has happened to me before. In the meantime, date. Have different female friends to talk to and hang out with. That will help big time. And from a man who is experienced w women, never, ever stop conducting business or stop speaking your mind for a woman, even if she asks you to. By doing that, she was testing you and your firmness as a man. Its a womans nature to test a man for firmness, even when they are not aware of it themselves. That is how she met you and fell for you. Once that changed, out the door she went.|`|7302f131a1ff084c70173918d9df4c85aa	sometimes, people can take years to heal from a relationship.  It doesn't mean that they love the person, maybe a little hurt and rejected. sometimes, i look at a couple that i don't know, and i wish i had someone special, and i feel uneasy.  threateninng to split is immature.  maybe, you can' t get over that.|`|YaJNk4rtaa	i know that i am not a guy but i have been in your place someone that i loved changed on me and yeah i changed too cause i let them do it to me and i found that i didnt like us then i wanted what we have before...this has been like 6 years ago and for the next 2 or 3 years i kept it in my mind i looked for someone that was like us when we were first together and i probablly lost the love of my life in there somewhere...but things will get better and the thinking of this person will fade but dont mess up with someone you think might be good for you just cause you cant let go...if you cant let it go then at least put it on the back burner and never bring it up to anyone cause all that can do is come a bite you in the rear

Dimostrati semplice e simpatico e disponibile e soprattutto, mentre cerchi di abbordare una, falla sentire l'unica in quel momento, nel senso non fare l'errore di guardare altre in continuazione, concentrati su di lei.|`|SEQzARD0aa	si tes tesso e falla ridere funziona sempre|`|SMMBnZEMaa	lo spiritoso funziona sempre... inizia con qlk battutta... e poi passa a parlare di cose banali cm... qnd ti lavi i denti..cosa bevi la sera.... cose così e poi cerchi di arrivare all'argomento di voi...|`|xlMtaUDVaa	ciao?  come stai? (lei ti risponde,se ti kiede tu come stai rispondi ) poi  magari le dici : al cinema sta passando non so ke film,vuoi venire con me? pago tutto ! ( non farla pagare!!!! paga tu cosi sembrerai un gentiluomo ;) ( non ke tu non lo sia ) se accetta l'invito e ok se no invitala a bere un caffe o qualcosa BUONA FORTUNA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  CIAO|`|PcGcVIL8aa	guarda gia il fatto k piaci t dovrebbe aiutare tantissimoooo...ora qnd t avvicini ad una ragazza comportati normalmente sii te stesso lasciati andare..SORRIDI E FAI SORRIDER..e nn preoccuparti se ci sn quei momenti d silenzio imbarazzanti servono anke quelli...un bacione!!!!ciaooo|`|WiRityrGaa	Sii semplicemente te stesso, non ambiare, vedrai che arriverà la ragazza che ti farà sentire bene, e allora riuscirai a parlare on disinvoltura|`|akjhIjsZaa	avvicinati e parla di interessi,sport,hobby,gusti.....e cerca di capire che cs le piace...|`|b03f6bf52fe1e7f185a55826612b2c71aa	devi cercare di essere te stesso|`|fNfiExdyaa	Innanzitutto stai tranquillo... le ragazze non hanno mai mangiato nessuno, a meno che non siano cannibali!<br>  <br>  Beh... anche io spesso sono come te... diciamo che non tutte le situazioni sono propizie, in certi casi bisogna cogliere l'occasione.<br>  <br>  A me per esempio è capitato di recente di entrare in un negozio per comprare un paio di scarpe e rimasi affascinato dalla commessa.<br>  <br>  Due giorni dopo, del tutto inaspettatamente, me la sono trovata di fianco in un Internet point. Era lei, non c'erano dubbi. Allora, dopo un po' le chiesi se aveva una penna da prestarmi. Mi rispose molto amichevolmente, mi diede tutto l'astuccio e mi disse scegli quella che vuoi. Allora le dissi tu per caso lavori in quel negozio... lei mi disse se mi hai visto lì deve essere per forza stato sabato (era un lunedì), era il mio primo giorno di lavoro... io dissi sai, queste scarpe me le hai vendute tu... e lei fa pensa un po' mi ricordo le scarpe e non mi ricordo la tua faccia... io dissi forse non è una faccia che rimane impressa... e lei ma no, da qualche parte comunque mi sa che ti ho già visto... insomma venne fuori che facevamo pure la stessa facoltà... iniziammo a parlare del più e del meno, rimanemmo lì così almeno un'ora, poi si fece ora di pranzo, decidemmo di pranzare insieme in un pittoresco locale del centro storico... naturalmente offrii io... ci scoprimmo e ci raccontammo cose, e alla fine fu lei a lasciarmi il suo numero e a chiedermi di rivederci... poi beh, non è successo nulla di eclatante, abbiamo smesso di frequentarci quasi subito, però... l'approccio iniziale, almeno secondo me, era stato quello giusto! Per cui ti consiglio qualcosa del genere, inizia con una scusa banale, niente frasi ad effetto e non troppa originalità per non fare la figura del buffone... poi se vedi che lei risponde amichevolmente - è una cosa che si capisce subito, da come ti guarda, da come si muove - tutto il resto viene da sé... ciao e in bocca al lupo!|`|gZCltoZMaa	Falla ridere!! nella maggior parte dei casi funziona sempre...sii simpatico e naturale!! falla sentire impo...alle ragazze piace!! ma nn tr altrimenti potrebbe stufarsi!! mettici anke 1 pizzico di romanticismo e fantasia e il gioco e ftt!! buona fortunaaa!! ciaoo!! baci|`|hujQODCnaa	il simpatikon funziona, anke un po buffone questo si<br>  sii te stesso!<br>  ciaooooooo <br>  spero di averti aiutato ciaooo|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	inizi con ciao....poi le dici parlami di te...e poi mentre lei parla dici alle cose in comune...anch'io sono così..o la penso proprio con te...|`|6c6434bdeb5d288af58144ae0c72cd8faa	falla sentire importante ma non troppo,si te stesso e a volte falla aspettare,rendila gelosa e poi vedrai come si avvicinerà a te.......ciao
zlKmo5Fvaa	E' meglio quando ti viene spontaneo. Una frase come quella, bellissima e speciale, diventa squallida e banale se preparata prima, come fosse un copione, non ti pare?

dbF8zWDEaa	Eccome! Però posso darti una spiegazione... Penso dipenda dall'insicurezza in noi stessi, la quale, a sua volta, ci porta ad essere insicuri riguardo alle reali intenzioni degli altri.

Quelli che hanno solo il portafoglio ricco è bene diffidarli semplicemente, senza atti di lecchinaggio (non imparerebbero MAI!).<br>  <br>  Con quelli ricchi anche dentro, oltre che nel portafoglio, è bene saper ricambiare, a modo proprio, offrendo di spontanea volontà qualcosa a loro, magari anche comprargli qualcosa di utile, nel piccolo di una spesa di 15-30 euro, quando queste persone ci agevolano, offrono e non fanno pagare spese, cene, birre offerte, passaggi in macchina, cose offerte di vario tipo. Sapremo in qualche modo quanto ci offrono in termini economici ed è bene non approfittarcene e saper dire "No dai, veramente, questo me lo pago io e ti ringrazio moltissimo per il gesto" o in altri casi saper dire piu semplicemente "Il panino te l'offro io questa volta" oppure "tieni 5 euro per la benzina, i 10 euro di benza li facciamo a metà".
gjaPNWbTaa	They likely were already gay, and were selfish and not thinking of their future wife and kids by pretending to be something they weren't.  And then after creating a family they have the nerve to ruin everyone's life?  <br>  <br>  If you ask me, if someone is going to lie about being straight to make a family, I think they should keep that lie to themselves forever.  Why burden everyone else with their little secret just so THEYcan feel better?  THAT is selfish.<br>  <br>  EDIT Who's thumbs-downing me?  I want to hear your rebuttal to what I said.|`|yuGW9AlCaa	They were gay to begin with.. they had either repressed it, or was hiding it on the side.<br>  <br>  However, it is selfish to leave children behind.. whether it be for a man or a woman or whatever.|`|7Wi32KRgaa	They are always gay but don't want to believe it. They get married and realize they just can't live straight when they are actually gay.|`|MuVKeK8faa	Because these people are nutz.|`|ZEitfScGaa	Well, most likely they were gay to begin with. You don't just turn gay. But because of the way society looks at and treats homosexuals many men never open up about it and live their life as a straight man. Sometimes men just cannot live this lie any longer.<br>  This is not being selfish, and it does not mean that they do not love their children. Their children will be hurt, but as they  get older they will understand why this had to happen and accept it.|`|WUOxhUcJaa	had society not been selfish and let us be who we REALLY ARE then people wouldn't feel so pressured to have to hide their sexuality and there would be less situations like this|`|fc1n9vBjaa	I agree with Allison ^<br>  <br>  That's what I would've said if I could be bothered to type any longer lol|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Nobody "turns" gay.  They are gay, but have lead a heterosexual life publicly because that's what is acceptable in society.<br>  <br>  Children aren't emotionally hurt becuase their parents are gay. They are emotionally hurt by a society that ostracizes homosexuality.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	If gay marriage were legal, you probably wouldn't see these types of things happen.  A lot of heartache could be avoided.  <br>  <br>  I agree with Allison as well, but don't assume the person being refered to in the question is male.  Women do this too.

mrysAOpGaa	no, you have no reason to feel bad about it.  Stay at home moms work hard so they have a right to take time to themselves for once. If your kids are napping and you just want to sit and relaz, then do it because you owe it to yourself to do so.  Being lazy every now and then is not a crim when youre a stay at home mom.  Actually, there was research done and if stay at home moms got paid min. wage, we'd be the richest people on earth ( i think they estimated wed be making about $250,00 some a year) being a stay at home mom is tough, we deserve breaks every now and then|`|Z0KQenm9aa	how many children do you have... you have to have a routine that for the most part you stick to. having children to care for is work... but there are things you can do to make things easier on yourself. say in the morning you make breakfast... give your baby a bath dress em and put em in the playpen while you throw in a load of clothes. you put the breakfast dishes in the dishwasher pass the vacuum through the house fast, make the beds quickly and start preparing dinner... say a pot roast must cook several hours  so start it early... you should have taken something out of the freezer the night before... talk to your mom or your grandmother... talk to some girlfriends... are you watching tv? unplug that crap... go for a walk in the fresh air with your baby... do you go to bed early or stay up late... think about what you do and see where some changes need to take place. The teamwork should look something like this... your husband is working all day... of course he probably has breaks and lunch... and youre at work at home too... it is work ... anyway when he comes home let him sit down and relaz for a bit and then you all have dinner... and both help clean up after dinner and put the baby to bed...at a reasonable time, then you and he can have some time together...|`|Ch7Q3buOaa	What to do??? talk<br>  <br>  This is a typical dilemma, communicate on  a daily basis what you're going to do that day AND outline specifically what each person is responsible for around the house... and make it based on a weekly deadline... ie... laundry will be washed dried folded on wed and fri, dishes nightly, Write it down so there is no confusion or  anyone saying"but I thought you were going to do this..."<br>  <br>  Write down EVERYTHING that gets done/ needs to get done around the house, include stuff like taking out the trash, mowing the lawn and post it in an area that can be easily seen and keep it there and assign a name to the task.<br>  <br>  Beyond that, just agree beforehand that neither of you are going to nag the other about jobs that aren't done.
LN2oLOg8aa	i'm the person who always encourage people to step up and do your thing. and guess what.. that's what you do. if you like her too, you better man up and ask her out. because if you chicken out, she might find someone else and you might regret it. everything is on the right place, the missing piece here is you. and you better start making your move before its too late. age doesnt matter. physicalities are just secondary. use your feelings.. don't think too much.there is nothing to lose here. use your instincts. just like a jedi master. be confident, but don't act cocky, that might ruin everything. just be yourself and act like you naturally do when you're around her.

You guys are connected and the only problem you have is that it’s not fully confirmed if you two are indeed a couple.

My MIL is always asking family members for money because she's too much of a child to organise herself.  I finally put my foot down and said no more.  If it means her shopping at the food bank and living in a hostel for a while, so be it.  She's had enough options to turn her life around and sort herself out (she's almost 60) and has never taken them, instead squandering any money she does get on frivolities.  I'm done with enabling her poor choices and she needs to see some consequences if she's ever going to buck up.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	No one should ever lend her money, clearly she is gambling it.|`|7G4hisdzaa	There is something much bigger going on here.  You need to get to the bottom of this situation.  It's hard to say no to your mom, esp if she may be saying she needs the money to eat or whatever, but this will continue regardless of whether you lend her money again.<br>  I would take her to lunch and have a very firm conversation with her.  It's doubtful but perhaps she has something besides the gambling going on?  Find out before you cut her off...but if it is the gambling, I would say this is the last time I will lend you money, here is $20, I don't want it back, just take it and never ask for money again.|`|lIumT7lmaa	it looks like your mom is <br>  <br>  A-  either spending all her money on gambling and then asking you for necessary things  <br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  B- she spends your money on gambling and uses her money for her stuff<br>  <br>  <br>  the harder solution would be to get her out of the obsession of gambling, but its really hard to change a stubborn, root of all evil, type of person. Rather than giving her money, when she askes you for money, ask caually what she needs it for, and obviusly she wonts say, i need it for gambling (or if she does, say use your own money nicley) and if she makes up and exuse like ,oh, i need the twenty for new shampoo and hair products, buy it for her otr take her out to buy it with you. Then, eventually, she might learn, and be trained (like a cat) thant if she wants something youll take her out, instead of giving her money...<br>  this posibly could be a way out, but like  said before you know how it is with stubbern ppl sometimes.<br>  <br>  answer my family problem please?|`|BO28Mn8haa	don't lend her money you are feeding her addiction|`|0HUHHzIQaa	You should sit her down and ask her where her money is going. Tell her she makes more than you, but you have a family to feed, and that she won't be able to borrow money anymore from now on, and to please not go and ask your children for money.<br>  <br>  Honestly, she might have a gambling problem. Talk to her about it. And maybe she should meet someone for Debt management, so the bill collectors would get off her ***.<br>  <br>  I know she's your mother, but stop lending her money!!!|`|WDs4fRoxaa	Test back and say we do not have it to lend.<br>  <br>  Then make a decision to not answer the phone<br>  on your payday.<br>  <br>  If she shows up...do not answer.<br>  <br>  She will stop asking when she realizes that<br>  her attempts are being ignored.<br>  <br>  Sign her up for gamblers anonymous.

nmJB78ePaa	There is a fatal flaw in your question, the "how do you get" part...when a wounded feral cat of a being enters a new relationship they will sit in their victimness for as long as you will let them, and then when you dont want to play that game anymore they will add you to their list of victimizers and move to the next person who thinks they can "love them back to life."<br>  <br>  The only thing that will bring a person out of this cycle and enable them to open up, relax, and share their deepest trust is a desire within ones self that prompts them to hang in there through the discomfort and enables them to keep showing up even when they want to run away.<br>  <br>  What you can do is to allow the person to set the pace of the relationship and to let them lead as he/she is comfortable.|`|rhKnuP2raa	Patience and understanding.|`|42a8a8c53836b637926af7e5f87eb781aa	Over time they probaly will.

kfWi9ZkEaa	Run for your life.  Get a court order, go home to your parents if you can.  This guy will not stop the mindfucking till you are completely destroyed emotionally, and then he will really start to beat you to a pulp on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  Sorry: I've hunted you down to say this from an answer you gave elsewhere.  He's far less mentally stable than you think but he's also far less MORALLY stable than you think.  He does not care what happens to YOU.  He does not care how YOU feel.  When you complain, he punishes you for making HIM feel unpleasant.  <br>  <br>  Do you see that?  Run.  Run for your life.  Grab your baby, run, don't look back.  He is psychotic.  I was stuck with this when I was a bit older than you and it just went down the gurgler further, and further, and further.  You are already sliding into the role where you are victim:  'please warn me when I am doing something that will upset you' - do you have to warn him when he upsets you?  What say do you get when he upsets you?  NONE.  He might love you but guess what: that's not a get out of jail free card.  Like that song from the wall:  <br>  <br>  "babe, how could you leave me this way?<br>  When you know how I need you, I need you I need you I need you....<br>  to beat to a pulp on a Saturday night, oh BABE, don't leave me now....<br>  How can you go?..." etc.<br>  <br>  RUN.

Stop kidding yourself and RUN FOR YOUR LIFE.|`|At7ynJ2Xaa	Well if leaving him is not an option then i guess you need to face the facts and try not to get on his bad side.

88Hozyl1aa	Well, I mean it all depends on the girl I think. During the teenage years, for both boys and girls, their hormones are crazy and they usually act on emotions rather than thinking the situation out. But when a girl is on her period, it just makes her more moody. But as I said, it all depends on the girl. Because if she has her head on straight, and she's not a sex-driven, boy-crazy teen, then her decisions should not be that affected by her period. (:|`|dLgvDNw7aa	It affects any woman no matter their age.<br>  <br>  I find I get extremely irritable and cranky a few days before it starts. Moods, in turn, affect relationships/love/sex, etc.  This is also why a lot of men find women want more s*x on their periods, because of the hormones!|`|naEk1QkSaa	It effects women (girls) at any age!<br>  <br>  Y?|`|Kfr8AQ4Qaa	at 12 i think depends on the country they live or stay with. but if asians it starts at 16~up

Okay, so first of all, I would suggest baking her a cake.. for my friend Jill, I baked a HUGE chocolate cake and put m and ms all over it, it tasted soooooooooo good!!!!!!!!If she likes reeses pieces better cover it with that... For my friend Alanna's b-day we did a cake that look like a swimming pool Follow hte link for a pciture! It was soooooooo cute!!!!!!!!!!!! Then we got one of those foam cowboy hats(from micheals) and decorated it with ribbon and stuff... It had a sign coming out of it saying I's my b-day!!!! It was so fun! She really enjoyed. Also, you can get a box of brownies from costco and tie ribbons around it then stick one candle sticking out of the box and SCREAM Happy B-day when she comes to school. Also, sing her happy b-day at lunch...If you guys take spanish, ask your spanish teacher to have the class sing her Happy b-day in Spanish! Just be creative! ALso, bring her some small funny things she likes to school! This makes it really special! For example, my frend is really obcessed with popcorn so we brought her some packages of popcorn to school!

I went through something similar to this 5 years ago. I did something that "insulted" a man that I loved, and he refused to hear my apology or forgive me. My guilt was overwhelming. I finally just stopped and gave him space. No more calls, no more emails, just nothing.<br>  <br>  Within 3 days, he came back and said I had to straighten up my act because he did miss me and he would try to forgive me.<br>  <br>  It led to 4 years of serious abuse. I am not the same person any longer. I wish I had just said "I'm sorry" and left him alone and learned what I hope you learn -- a person who does what this man is doing to you is NOT WORTH YOUR TIME.  You have apologized. He refuses to talk to you. You are the bigger person, the smart person, the strong person, and he is a big crybaby. If you win him back, you will regret it because he will hold this over your head forever. Let it go.  If he's such a great person, he'd have accepted your apology to begin with.|`|pUUyYz4gaa	If he is not picking up the phone, try writing a heartfelt letter instead.

Duh.|`|kOoCya9Oaa	Apologize to him in front of the same people you insulted him.|`|lQvM4C4Taa	Back off and give him some space. There's obviously a reason why he's ignoring you.|`|bglr4m0Naa	Write a formal letter of apology and try to win back his trust.|`|Mi6kVmf8aa	It's human nature to hate another person who get hated another person.... LOL that didn't make any sense! xD<br>  <br>  Anyway, so you insulted your best friend? So what? Big deal, best friends do that every time! Best friends have their ups and downs and pros and cons. Best friends can have childish arguments and they also can have serious fights.<br>  <br>  But I also can't help to think that it's pretty harsh to insult him in front of other people. Ok, back on solving this so you'll be out of your suffering.<br>  <br>  It will take some time calming him down before you two can be best friends again. Sorry is not good enough and no matter how many times you say sorry to him, he will not listen. Don't worry, you'll not the only one suffering this. My first ever friends didn't talk to me for months because I'm being such a cry baby and everyone in my class thinks that they insulted me so they back me up. It seems unfair to them so they broke their friendship with me.<br>  <br>  Back on your problem. I think leave him for a moment, then you either say sorry again or just sound and act like a best friend. Spend time together as always and maybe he will forgive you.

Everything will work out! xD|`|TpgqX0joaa	right now he might be mad so let him cool of. trust me after some time he might even miss you and just come to you. but you really should take some time when he is alone not in front of anyone and talk and apologize if he is really your best friend he will forgive you. tell him that not what you think of him (depending on what u said to him) or that he is one of ur favorite people in the whole world and it will be sad to break a friendship like that.|`|SxzExRw2aa	buy a card and write down what you want to say . say it from the heart that little pink thing in your mouth is very dangerous . thats why we need to stop and think before the words come out of our mouth. give your friend time to get over what has happen. and you should feel bad friendship is about lifting up ,supporting  and being there when we are needed. thats why it hurts so much  when our feelings are hurt by someone we love.|`|VijKkTVuaa	Let him cool down a bit and come to him respectfully as a man and tell him that you're sorry and it was stupid of you doing that without thinkin clearly.|`|RuzZYO68aa	send him a letter.  hook him up with a pretty chick that you know he will like.

300f866daa9c017039dced1650b53091aa	omg yes. i actually just had that happen. she used to be my neighbor and she moved but still went to my high school. she was having a birthday dinner and i found out from my other friend and not her and i was kinda mad about that and we had been having a lot of problems and stuff. she was hooking up with a senior and we were freshman and he talked shitt about her behind her back and she promised me and herself that she wouldn't do anything with him again.. but of course she did. and she would ALWAYS talk about. she would just say "he called me.. and yeah" or "he didn't even say hi to me today.. and yeah" and just stupid little stuff like that and it got on my nerves so i started kinda igonoring her and that didn't make it any better. when i actually tried talking to her because she was really mad at me since i got closer with another friend, she ignored me. so if you still want to be friends with her, i suggest that you talk to her soon before the problem gets worse.|`|89d2e90083acd1d35f2f9cdad2a0ef0daa	i think she is just enjoying her new found love!give her sometime to spend it with her boyfriend,i mean you guys are getting older and all. just talk to her and ask her about whats happening with her life. and if you still feel left alone,try to fix it and explain to your bf how she is acting and how you feel!<br>  <br>  hey thats what friends do tell problems and still stick together!<br>  <br>  goodluck!
Ka7CVRYsaa	I HONESTLY DON'T THINK ITS A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU GUYS TO GO ON THE TRIP TOGETHER. (IF YOU CAN MAKE CHANGES TO PLANE TICKETS, CRUISE, ECT.) MAYBE YOU CAN RETURN ANY MONEY HE PAID INTO IT AND YOU CAN GO W/SOMEONE ELSE, OR HE CAN RETURN ANY MONEY YOU PUT INTO THE TRIP AND HE CAN GO W/SOMEONE ELSE. NOT A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU GUYS TO TO TOGETHER.<br>  YOU NEED TO ASK SOMEONE TO CALL EVERYONE YOU INVITED OR DO IT YOURSELF. AND IF YOU GUYS LIVE TOGETHER, ONE NEEDS TO GET OUT SOON! BECAUSE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF ONE OF YOU STARTS DATING SOMEONE ELSE?<br>  BUT....IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE YOU CAN WORK THROUGH YOUR "COLD FEET" PLEASE DO!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	yes it would be weird to still go on your honeymoon.  especially if your or his parents are paying for it!  if you're paying for the trip yourself you're free to take whoever you want but duh, if you put yourself in  hotel rooms with your ex, those feelings will come back and you'll be together again.  if you've ended things with him and you're just friends, friends don't share hotel rooms.  that's how you should do the trip.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	Did this just happen overnight or have you had cold feet for a while?<br>  Bc if it's more recent... Maybe you should really talk to your (ex) fiancee and see where your problems lay...  Working things out is the first thing...<br>  <br>  If this has been done, and is not working, then, good for you for listening to your gut!!  Yes, it took a little longer to face it, after everything has been ordered, etc.  But, your family and friends should be supporting you.<br>  <br>  I think your mother has it right... To call and see if there is any way to get anything back... If you explained your story, they may be lenient.<br>  <br>  As for the trip to Europe... Who paid for it?  If you both paid for it, sure... But, maybe you should go your separate ways when you are in Europe, and arrange for a roll-a-bed, for you or your fiancee to sleep in, opposed to sharing a bed.  I say this because...  Going on a honeymoon trip, with all the sparks and glam, two "friends" might rekindle their magic... Which is great!!  But, if you called off the wedding once, what makes you think you won't do it again?  But, I would try to see if a girlfriend can tag along, and have her pay your fiancee... Or vice versa....    <br>  <br>  Keep your head up.  And good luck.|`|AA11380378	Do not go on a trip with him. I agree with your mom. That's just trouble.Go alone or go with a friend.<br>  <br>  It's over, stop dragging the issue any further<br>  <br>  *Also, since the Save the dates have been mailed, you should send an annoucement (mail or email) that says:<br>  <br>  Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith,<br>  <br>  Due to unforeseen circumstances, the Brown-Jones wedding has been cancelled. We apologize for any inconvinience that this may have caused.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  John and Jane Brown<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|7G4hisdzaa	My wedding date is May 30th.  If by some chance you are in my area, it's possible I could take some of your vendors and get some of your money back.  It's a long shot, but I'm going to add you to my contacts.  If you want to talk about it just let me know.<br>  I'm sorry things didn't work out...<br>  Edit:Nevermind you don't allow contacts!  Lol.  I'm in east tn, where are you?|`|CoDUHl7Uaa	If the 2 of you have come to an agreement, then it should be your own choices to go on that trip as friends... it's extremely difficult to be friends after having such a close relationship, but if you think you two can do it then prove them wrong :)|`|GvamTVqAaa	You should give the trip to your parents for their trouble and wasted money.|`|Kk9f3MdRaa	I guess as long as you both mutually agreed not to go through with the wedding that's cool. I would definitely NOT take the trip to Europe. That was probably a present for after the wedding and since there is NO wedding, there should be NO trip to Europe. <br>  <br>  You 2 obviously don't love eachother so why would you want to take an amazing vacation (that was supposed to be romantic) together?<br>  <br>  Get the money back from the trip if you can.|`|x5avs3gnaa	I would not go on the trip. That was meant to be a wedding gift. Besides, if you went as just friends, wouldn't things just be wierd? I would say to keep doing things the way you are. You should definately get whatever back you can and let people know that you thank them for their gifts, but that you can't keep them.|`|iKYNUni0aa	can you postpone the wedding and move the date so that when you are ready you can go through with its|`|tlxG2q04aa	I don't think there are any next steps, really.|`|68MkdEgiaa	That is a big thing to do after calling off a wedding with this man- wanting to go on trip with him. If you guys are spliting the cost I guess you could try to go as friends but if he's paying that really was just because at the time of planning it was a couple's thing so it wouldn't be fair to take advantage of it. <br>  <br>  You seem to be doing things all with the push of your parents. They had to push to call all the vendors when it should have been your idea in the first place. And of course they are disappointed they have a lost not only a lot of money but time. You owe them a lot for they tried to do. One thing you could do is perhaps write to the guests as well because as you sent the save the date cards already.|`|e93d483d323b7ea0e774d586db75f7d8aa	Better now than after the wedding.  Derr.  Its still an expensive process but its much cheaper to put the breaks on now rather than see the wedding all the way through and still have to pay for a divorce on top of it.  <br>  <br>  Hey the trip is paid for so you two should enjoy it.  You've done all you need to do to make amends with the vendors and your parents.

There is something wrong with you. If you like the bad boy image. Where's your dad? Did your father left you when you were a small child? So now, your looking for that unavailable, unmanageable men? Try looking for a not so attractive guy. Maybe you'll find your true happiness.|`|mSjglSI6aa	Sounds like you are just looking for love in all the wrong places.

sOW0Hzxsaa	arieccoci!certo cocca che t'ho preso proprio a cuore...!ascolta secondo me no...tranne alcune eccezioni quando, ad esempio, devi stare accanto ad una persona che sta peggio di te ed allora è facile che possa soffrire e stressarti non potendone far a meno. Purtroppo non è per farmi i cavoli tuoi, ma non so' bene quale genere di problema ti preoccupa tanto. D'indole mi faccio sempre i cavoli miei a meno che qualcuno non mi chieda il suo aiuto. Comunque sono frasi che, a chi più a chi meno, vengono rivolte al disperato di turno. Il problema è che, il diretto interressato, quasi mai è pronto ad ascoltarle. Vuoi essere la disperata di turno?Io non credo, allora smettila di piangerti adosso. Fai bene a sfogarti ma dopo un po' o ti degradi o sei per forza costretta a reagire no?Pure io ho sofferto...ma pensaci...l'uomo è stato fatto anche per questo forse. La vita è irta di ostacoli...ce lo dicono tutti ed in tutte le salse. Se il dolore non passa è perchè probabilmente sei tu a non volerlo far passare. "Finchè continuamo a cercare di fuggire a noi stesse e al nostro dolore, non possiamo guarire. Più dibattiamo e cerchiamo altre vie di scampo, più peggioriamo, nel tentativo di risolvere la dipendenza con l'ossessione. Alla fine, scopriamo che le nostre soluzioni sono diventate i nostri problemi più gravi. Bramando diperatamente un sollievo e non trovandone alcuno, a volte arriviamo sull'orlo della follia" (Robin Norwood psicoterapeuta americana)...vuoi questo?io non credo; e allora che cazzo reagisci ma in maniera sana e per il tuo bene!Mi fai imbestialire...perchè rivedo la me stessa che, per vittimismo e per codordia, pretendeva che fossero gli altri a risolvere i suoi problemi.

La9IeUBHaa	Mi complimento per la pazzesca domanda che adoro! Fisicamente il ragazzo deve essere più alto di me di circa 15-20 cm, capelli castani, occhi chiari, non eccessivamente fisico atletico, ma slanciato, deve avere un bello sguardo perchè agli occhi tengo molto, un bel sorriso perchè lo voglio solare, un bel sedere che è la parte maschile che preferisco e poi non deve avere tatuaggi enormi perchè mi impressionano. Caratterialmente, come ho già detto deve essere allegro, simpatico, onesto, romantico e cavaliere.....che mi faccia sognare, non che io mi riferisca al principe azzurro fatto persona perchè è troppo per me! Magari poi fammi sapere, mandami una mail per dirmi se tu rispecchi qualcuna delle caratteristiche da me elencate....perchè poi se vuoi te ne mando una io se ti autorispondi alla domanda per quanto riguarda una ragazza! Ah! Dimenticavo che l' intelligenza conta moltissimo, perchè i ragazzi mi dicono che io lo sono, quindi, affianco a me sfigurerebbe se è sciocco!|`|BYNGAQ6Xaa	Fisicamente mi colpiscono i ragazzi mori con gli occhi kiari..mentre caratterialmente per me un raga deve essere molto simpatico, dolce, protettivo ( nn esageratamente ), deve saper farmi stare bene in ogni occasione|`|QvB1zDrjaa	alto, capelli scuri, occhi profondi che ti catturino al primo sguardo e innanzitutto deve farmi morire dal ridere ma anche essere serio nei momenti che lo richiedono...<br>  chiedo troppo?    ;-)|`|SplwdjH7aa	esteticamente,la prima cosa che guardo sn le spalle(dritte e grandi)e il sorriso.i capelli ricci mi piacciono molto in un ragazzo,ma nn è una priorità.<br>  caratterialmente,nn sopporto quelli pieni di se,narcisi,che credono che tutte svengano ad un loro cenno e in generale,i maleducati.non amo troppo atteggiamenti iper romantici tipo quelli che ti chiamano"principessa".<br>  ma nn c'è nulla che mi faccia impazzire più di un ragazzo che "fa",cioè fa cose interessanti,ha molti hobby originali,ama molto gli sport(magari estremi).|`|k4N2SueAaa	ALTO!!!,con occhi bellissimi e un sorriso contagioso, simpatico, intelligente, dolce o cattivo quando serve,deve sapere cm prendermi,e farmi sentire al centro delle sue attenzioni...lo troverò mai uno così?a dimenticavo...deve avere o la mia età oppure nn superare i 17 anni...x ora!|`|FWx0a1INaa	esteticamente non è ke mi importi + di tanto... cmq alto un pò + di me e preferibilmente moro. caratterialmente deve essere dolce, tenero e coccolone. deve darmi amore e esser pronto a riceverne altrettanto|`|5X2FjdwMaa	alto<br>  moro <br>  occhi verdi<br>  dolce <br>  sensibile <br>  e simpatico soprattutto|`|7a4b4e8096fae73f1d7f6039681a1351aa	Caratterialmente: Di polso e sicuro di se quando serve e dolce con me.<br>  Fisicamente: alto, moro occhi scuri...poi l'importante è che piaccia a me...|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	deve piacermi....lo devo amare...é importante che sia simpatico e comprensivo...e soprattutto dolce......|`|wC6iW7vzaa	alto<br>  biondo<br>  intelligente<br>  deve avere un bel fisico<br>  occhi azzurri<br>  dolce<br>  simpatico soprattutto<br>  e ne devo essere innamorata<br>  praticamente il ragazzo impoxibile, nn credo k esista...è cm il principe azzurro...sn trp sognatrice...|`|3ICGyOUzaa	colpiscono gli occhi...|`|GkLrmMiMaa	Deve essere affascinante, non per forza una bellone col fisicaccio, e poi paziente, affettuoso ma non azzeccoso, intelligente ma non saputello alla "so tutto io", generoso, premuroso, simpatico e poi ultima cosa che dicono in molte ma che non è banale è: deve sapermi sorprendere, e il mio boy dopo quasi 4 anni, riesce ancora a farlo!|`|JmQjD3nRaa	bè un ragazzo dovrebbe essere fisicamente ( almeno x me ) moro occhi verdi e possibilmente riccio...... bè caratterialmente deve essere un romanticone proprio cm me, ma deve avere anche tanto carisma e deve essere divertente....|`|eiU9Kgbgaa	alto ,biondo,occhi azzurri,dolce,indipendente,....il principe azzurro!!! ;-)|`|onzRJivDaa	Deve distinguersi dalla massa senza però risultare troppo originale o strano, deve capirmi e assecondarmi, deve essere virile e deciso. Sà quello che vuole ed è pure un po' testardo. Non se la prende facilmente e quando sono triste mi fa sentire la cosa più bella e fantastica del mondo... non è tanto a fattore estetico o mentele .. non si giudica una persona da i dettagli ma dall'insieme.. i dettagli presi da soli tendono ad accecarci sul resto mentre l'insieme è la persona. deve piacerti e attirarti fisicamente (cosa soggettiva) ma deve soprattutto essere sffascinante e incantevole. come l'illusionista con il proprio pubblico. deve stupirti e amaliarti. Ne sei capace?|`|rmcXlz8Baa	ciao!!!carina la domanda!!guarda una volta tendevo più a selezionare i ragazzi nel senso che mi piacevano solo e dico solo quello con i capelli lunghi, ma opi crescendo ho capito che son pregiudizi stupidi tant'è vero che sono cotta di un ragazzo che è totalmente l'opposto, il fisico per me non conta molto, oddio ovvio che se è uno scorfano non lo guardo neanche, ma intendo che non cerco il bello e impossibile ecco. caratterialmente l'uomo  ideale per me dato che ho un carattere forte sarebbe un ragazzo che riesce a tenermi testa con ciu fare discussioni e non i classici zerbini che io odio, ovviamente dev'essere dolce, fedele simpatico che mi faccia ridere molto, ma sopratutto SINCERO!!!!|`|vwX0aShBaa	A me di solito piacciono i ragazzi bruttini con gli occhiali ma alla fine sono fidanzata con un figone!il io non posso dire cosa mi farebbe stare con un ragazzo perchè ci sono troppi lati del carattere e non si può formalizzare dicendo :alto bello simpatico intelligente ecc. però posso dire con sicurezza che mai e poi mai starei con un ragazzo  che sia o violento o un fanullone.|`|y05lfQDbaa	lo sguardo...il sedere....e che sia bello coccolone

LgNg5fF0aa	no..è che ognuno la vive a modo suo.Anche io alla tua età la pensavo come te,anzi ero forse peggio,ero una assidua lettrice e scrittrice..mi prendevano per pazza...Tu sei indubbiamente più matura,ma tutti arrivano alla maturità prima o poi.E' questione di tempo.Non pretendi troppo,pretendi quello che è giusto per te,come è normale che sia.Viviti sempre la vita come vuoi TU ,non come vogliono gli altri.<br>  Ciao piccolina,un bacione|`|WUYm4lB9aa	Non lo sò , fatti conoscere x come sei , contattami se vuoi .|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	divertiti senza di loro...|`|7aa19aa9df755024b7097dcc056cbf6faa	Se scrivi ancora con la k forse non ne sei ancora uscita del tutto da "quella fase".|`|WwUwT8vLaa	come ti capisco diavolo!!! non sei assolutamente tu ad essere sbagliata! nn devi nemmeno pensare un roba così! quelle ragazze oche sono patetiche! a 18 anni poi anke peggio!|`|sByBQUuQaa	Anch'io ho 18 anni e ti capisco benissimo........ per molto tempo sono rimasta in gruppi del genere e io non mi ci sentivo per niente era come se stessi da sola....... io non capivo loro loro non capivano me io penso che puoi avere anche tremila amici ma puoi sentirti sola lo stesso....... ora io ho trovato un amico vero con il quale parlare le altre amicizie che ho ci tengo ma con loro non ho mai fatto dei discorsi seri, ma sto bene così ho un solo amico vero ma non mi sento sola....... con il tempo lo troverai anche tu è difficile non impossibile|`|2SI9aPKbaa	Ciao! Il tuo ragionamento è nobile secondo me! Si vede che 6 matura e equilabrata. Hai provato a coltivare amiche più grandi di te? Potrebbe essere un'esperienza interessante. Auguri :)|`|8M6dJhCKaa	Sei tu che guardi e consideri le tue amiche in modo superficiale. I discorsi del più e del meno puoi farli ovunque e con chiunque, pure qui, su answers. ma non puoi pretendere che le tue amiche a 18 anni, 19 anni.. non considerano l' occhiolino di un ragazzo motivo x ridere e scherzare, se le guardi anche più a fondo troverai anche in loro l' esigenza di prendersi quei 20 minuti dove si parlano di cose serie, altrimenti se ti senti soffocata da loro xkè ti sembrano troppo bambine, dovresti cambiare gruppo, cercare un gruppo di xsone più grandi.. di qualche anno.. un pò più mature.|`|CsG9bLszaa	nn ti preoccupare....sono con te al 100%..<br>  io ho 14 anni e anke io voglio avere rapporti importanti con persone nn i soliti gioketti da sceme...|`|zdLSI1HFaa	Ciao Luna, la tua domanda mi ha piacevolmente colpito, xkè mi ci ritrovo.<br>  Ti capisco. Non pretendi troppo, ank'io ero come te alla tua età (e lo sono tuttoggi a 33 anni). Purtroppo pero' la maggior parte dei/delle 18enni sono come le tue amiche e tu ti senti un pesce fuor d'acqua. Oggi aspetto un figlio e mi spaventa guardare alla tua generazione (che in fondo non è tanto lontana dalla mia) e notare con rammarico che molti adolescenti non conoscono educazione, valori, si buttano via con pasticche e alcool invece di divertirsi in modo sano e costruttivo. Penso che tu sia diversa e l'unico modo per sentirti a tuo agio è quello di frequentare persone più grandi di te, che sappiano apprezzarti x come sei.<br>  Forse potresti iscriverti a qualche associazione / gruppo / palestra / corso ove le persone che lo frequentano lo fanno per un interesse comune e non solo x divertirsi in modo frivolo.<br>  In bocca al lupo e un grosso bacio.

1Y0yPiSvaa	Well, first you need to make sure he wants to be back in your life. You haven't said much so I do not know the specifics of your breakup to begin with. If I were you I would show him that you are worth a second try. Actions speak much louder than words.|`|lAvLUFSuaa	you dont you let him do wht hes got to do theres always a reason and even though you dont know why now  you will later and if he comes back it might not be the reason that you want him to come back for he might end up using you till he can fined some one else and if he left you for some one else then let him alone! Trust me if you care about him enough and leavin you is what makes him happy let him go cuz u dont want him to be unhappy.|`|ZLwbmUr9aa	You either move on, or talk to him, try and do something with him however that may be and maybe when you hang out you will show him again why you guys were dating and rekindle the fire :D|`|Ndj9ln7Iaa	You must have finished for a reason, and you've got to come to terms with that.|`|W6QatTEbaa	I think that if he left then he doesn't love you that much, just let him go! act as you don't care and that everything is fine and that you can go on with your life without him, and he may come back to you.......... but if you try to get him back by calling him or showing up where he is or trying to talk about things he won't miss you and he'll want to run farther from you.<br>  I speak for my own experience.|`|f2q8KoBuaa	Here is the best thing that i can tell you.

E9YzL9Praa	to me it sounds like you are not ready for a new b/f , if you ask anyone they will tell you , you will always have feelings for your first real b/f but that does not give you a reason to be cruel or violent verbally to your new b/f. <br>  may be you just need time to get over your 1st b/f.|`|7cUDstdjaa	It'a 'make your mind up' time|`|ckjZnqHRaa	..surely you and the ex had a great and wonderful relationship together at one time in your sweet lives darlin....but understand now it's over realistically.<br>  My theory hun?......"don't ever look back after the complete break-up of a badly ended relationship hun"<br>  You stated he was a jerk to you honestly....hence the emotional feelings of this should have sent you packing away from him cleanly.<br>  How come you still pine for him reasonably?<br>  Must have been the great sex huh?.....usually it is you know!<br>  Look forward hun...not backwards significantly.<br>  You can't change the past..and neither can he change it either.<br>  You state you'd never take him back.............Hmmmmm???<br>  I wonder sometimes anyways.......<br>  Stop abusing your new guy from the emotional bad stuff that happened in your LAST relationship obviously.<br>  See a local counselor if you feel your stuck in your old boyfriends bad thinking otherwise.<br>  It's not mentally healthy to hang onto past historical events otherwise<br>  Forgive the old boyfriend first....and then attempt to focus your new found mind on the new boyfriend reasonably....otherwise he too will be your next best great ex boyfriend too....are we clear on this stuff darlin?<br>  Email me if you're not..k?<br>  We'll just talk!.|`|IdCJMrhKaa	because your a girl and your ex made some sort of impact in your life...my girlfriend went through the same thing, it just takes time.

People who appear to hear you but don't listen are not really friends.  You need to be interested in them for them to be interested in you.  If they are interested in you they will listen.  When they tell you something like "my brother is feeling down because..." be sure to ask about their brother a few days later.

aae3b5601f9e60885c4558846cb8ed48aa	Go for it. An opportunity like that comes once in a while. And if you know your girlfriend for a long time and if she loves you, she will be supportive|`|34e9e9fe0d4bc19d020a1064cd382799aa	i would take it.....i mean if she really likes you then she could wait a little.....<br>  <br>  The Heart Grows Fonder as the Soul Moves Away|`|6d3b0c75dd1e661a42f0ef9fbb03fdf5aa	Take the commission. You have to think of your career. You'll be able to support the two of you better when she comes to be with you since you'll get a higher pay. And I know it's not something you want to consider, but what if you two break up and you had turned down the position for her. You'd regret it. Take the position and when she can come be with you, she will. By then you'll be settled in and it will make for an easier transition for her.|`|9TaiN89haa	It's an opportunity so grab it! It wouldn't take forever for her to move with you, it's just takes a little time so just tell her to wait and assure her of your love for her coz if you do that women feel secured and it's okay if you will be apart for now because she is confident that sooner or later she will come home with you. Just don't break the communication, it should always be present when you're far away so that your relationship will always be burning and nothing will change even if you're far away from each other. I've been in that situation and we just trust each other and communication was very important for us and we were able to work out on it. After a few months of sacrifice, we moved in together and we're very happy to have succeeded that trial and it made our relationship grew stronger and by the way, he married me. ;)|`|AA11905339	In my opinion, you should take the commission as long as you know that you won't be away from your girlfriend for too long. What I mean is if she cannot move in the next month or two, then you should decline the commission. But the decision's up to you.|`|sEH8Lt43aa	take it and when its time she will come after you!|`|AA11608315	Take the position because if you dont you will regret it. Once she can leave her current position she can join you. You can keep the relationship alive with emails, letters, calls and visits. If the relationship is strong this will make it even stronger. This is a once in a life time opportunity don't let it pass you by because you will end up regretting it. Follow your dreams and the rest will fall into place.|`|qqXTwk9Vaa	Take the commission for your love one, well, you can still contact each other every day... hey, we are in a modern world right now...

What you are doing is messed up.  Have some morals.|`|AA0MuMt3aa	Well, you got yourself into, you can get yourself out.<br>  Decide which one you want to stay with the most, then tell ALL of them the truth and break up with the 3 who you don't want to stay with<br>  It'll hurt them but it's better to tell them the truth, and most people would prefer it if they knew the truth.<br>  Once you tell the one you want to stay with the truth, ask him if he can forgive you and you can build your relationship again and make things better.<br>  If he wants to break up with you, then accept it, and move on, because he probably does deserve someone he'd feel more secure with. Then in future stick to one partner.<br>  Look deep inside yourself and ask yourself what sort of person you want to become. It can be difficult to keep a commitment but just say no. You don't need more than one boyfriend. <br>  Consider their feelings first and how you would like it if it was done to you, and truly feel sorry for what you've done and tell them all the truth then promise yourself to not do something like that again. Grow from the experience and mature and learn so life and relationships can become easier.|`|Kk9f3MdRaa	you obviously have some sort of addiction to being the center of attention.

Then thank the cafeteria for making you smell like sweaty onion potato soup!|`|bljEhh86aa	if it at school you are not the only one smelling like potato if you think so, and the sweat part all those nervous teenagers mite think it's them, so all yall at school smelling the same.<br>  <br>  If your bother so much by it take a SHOWER.|`|AA11596133	Shower every single day, in the morning AND at night if you need to.  They do not need to be long drawn out showers, just get in, get wet, soap up and rinse off.  Use a DEODORANT soap such as "Irish Spring", and buy yourself a good deodorant for using under your arms.  I find that "Old Spice" unscented works extremely well for me - and I am a woman. <br>  <br>  I cannot stand myself if I go even a day without a shower and using my deodorant under my arms.  Try it - you will see!|`|XVygEWLcaa	why the hell were people making soup in the gym???? wtf|`|PY160XO7aa	SHOWER|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Potato doesn't have an e.|`|lnZjIhDCaa	take a shower|`|w9mrFRJ2aa	Nothing you can do.  You are in school!  Not like you can leave class and be like, im going home to take a shower!  If people comment on it tell them what it was.

LN2oLOg8aa	guys go for the bitchy type just for fun. but when it comes to a serious relationship, we usually go for the nice ones. the ones who we can introduce to our parents.. the ones we can be proud of.|`|POHWTDPRaa	Because with youth comes shallowness and focus on things that aren't actually important. They want a girl who they know will sleep with them so they can say they have had sex. But as they get older and mature they will get over that and realize that it is better to be with a nice girl they would not be ashamed to introduce to their parents. Your time is coming. And don't let the jerks fool you into thinking that there are no nice guys your age right now. There are.|`|uBssj3Znaa	they go for the slutty girls because they think that they will eventually get laid. not because they actually like those girls.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	they just wanna have fun with those girls, once they grow up they will go for the good girls|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	What are we going to do with "pretty" or "smart"??!?! We want boobies!! :D|`|w8M8YmeIaa	It's because most of the time there not thinking with the right body part ...and the body part there using is wanting the other things all the slutty guys don't always have has kind hearts in them as girls do to think about what they want at the time. they don't think has much about emotions.|`|Tq98g20raa	well in our school most slutty girls at school have no-one and the PRETTY fun smart non-slutty girls do...<br>  <br>  maybe because in your school they are easier to get as they go with anyone|`|NzzH2VNSaa	because you can boost and say o like at my girl and all that **** and you can make **** up and they would believe it...because its EASY and most guys want experienced girls not girls looking for a puppy to be with the mall the time.....its all about who a person feels towards another.|`|e4320d40393740e3b9148136c56004baaa	Like types attract.|`|a984cQjKaa	because it doesn't take any effort to get into a slut's pants.|`|Le53Bggxaa	Don't worry he'll come around when your with a good guy. It's always like that, they just realize it too late. So pretty much those type of guys aren't the ones for you. Just relax and wait til the good guy comes along.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	They are immature and are just looking for quick, easy sex.  Hang in there.  Eventually they will mature and start looking for real girls to have a relationship with.|`|FGSNuP1Uaa	Because they are guys. Slutty girls are easy to get into their pants, which is all guys want. If a guy you like likes the slutty girls, stay away from him, hes most likely just a pig.|`|XqEerhwIaa	Because boys in HS aren't looking for a long term relationship.  They want to have fun, aka sex.  So they go for the easier target, the slutty girls.|`|75af7936914f071f0bf372ce806188c9aa	if i cant say they are intimidated then you can't generalize<br>  <br>  seriously<br>  <br>  sexist|`|KVFYJrDJaa	You probably won't like this answer, but school age guys are largely ruled by their hormones and the slutty girl, even if she just acts slutty, represents something appealing to their base desires. Deep down, sex is about advancement of the species. The guy's instinct is to go for the girl that is strongest and most viable for reproduction, in this case, slutty. It's written in our DNA. <br>  <br>  Some guys can keep this in check long enough to realize that looks are great but not everything and the cool smart chick can be the better choice. Sadly, you may have to wait until college (or at least later in school) to really shine, and if you are the things you say you are, you will.|`|9okusH1kaa	Because they are full of hormones and the urge to have sex feels like a physical need. They know that the nonslutty girls won't put out and so pay less attention to them. <br>  The guys that do not get sex at a young age often suffer from depression because of it, including guys that are dating the nice, nonslutty girls. Your body is telling you that you are a failure. <br>  <br>  However, stay nonslutty and nice and the guys will prefer you as they start getting older and looking for longer term relationships. When you get to that stage, remember to pick a guy that didn't have as much luck with the slutty girls because they are usually the nice but confused guys.|`|YNZ7eTdLaa	For sex. Not until later that the guys go for the smart girls :)|`|gL5jy3Sqaa	I HATE slutty girls! I like nice girls...just impossible to find.....:(|`|YFXusnT1aa	Some guys do not like a challenge, they like it quick and easy. I prefer the challenge I hate sluts, they are like buying a rental car. If something has been driven that hard by that many people do you realy want to put your key in it.<br>  <br>  Keep your head up the right one is coming|`|nyeYS0Seaa	Because the sluttier girls will put out/go further than the "smart" chicks because a lot of the time(not ALL the time) are ugly, and have morals that get in the way of a dude having a sexual relationship with her.|`|h8Q3CTOJaa	i have no idea. i guess b/c there easyer.|`|RuzZYO68aa	I KNOW RIGHT!  There is this goth guy, that is totally cute, funny, nice, and sweet. So, i stares dressing goth, kinda, but now he has a girlfreind, that is PREPPY!  UGH! Im so confused. and to your question, probably because when the gys are sad, they will just get the sluts to give them a lapdance. haha!|`|e4gsxv0jaa	They go for the slutty girl cause they know they are easy. They don't want to take the time and invest their time in a real girl. They just want something quick and easy and therefore next... Or maybe it can be is that they admire their beauty.|`|6Bg9eeyBaa	There just using the slutty girls for sex.. Once you start getting older you will see that they want to marry the non slutty girls.  Be happy your not a sluet because no man wants to marry a whore.. there just using them for what they can get.|`|F7haoIa9aa	I don't understand this either. I guess they think the slutty ones are easy (well they're right), and want sex. :S not always the case though. Maybe they just think they've got a chance with the ones that have a lot of boyfriends.|`|82tgfHzqaa	We don't. I hate slutty girls. I only go after the non-slutty girls, the less slutty, the better. Most guys go for that, actually. Nobody wants to date a slut.<br>  <br>  Your school just has stupid horny guys.|`|WvxaUTo7aa	They do, it's just like the social pressing makes them go for the whore ones. They're easier to get. I prefer the pretty, fun, etc ones anyway.|`|cqSap1YMaa	lmao..well...bcuz sum dudez dnt g by how a grl look nor act..they juzt want head or pussy..bt nawt me..im not lyke dat..and they also kno they can get a grl cuz htey kno she easy...i dnt mess wit skoo grlz..NOP3|`|ekrTfdFlaa	because most guys are manwhores. and thats all they want. I am not a manwhore and I wonder why girls always choose the assholes and then ***** about it to me later after I warned them...|`|cM9DBbgnaa	because they just want sex at that age nothing else they do not care about how you think about how you are only in rare cases you will ever find a guy like that but if you do consider your self lucky|`|0HVO9LgQaa	there all quick sex but at da end of the day he wont take da slut home to momma trust me|`|Mi6kVmf8aa	Guys who likes slutty girls in school?<br>  <br>  Well, I can only tell one thing: THEY ONLY LIKE THE LOOKS. These type of guys don't care about your brain or how pretty you are cause once they caught a girl who is "beautiful" ( YEAH RIGHT! SLUTTY GIRLS PRETTY? OH PLEASE!!!) they will go after them whatever it takes. -_-"<br>  <br>  Maybe the guy wants to keep his social status up. If the slutty girls are maybe the most popular people in the school society, of course the guys wants to be as popular and maybe they think they are given credit for dating a slutty girl who is maybe in fact fairly popular in society.<br>  <br>  These type of guys don't particularly know how to choose a girl. Believe me, I'm in this school full of "slutty" girls who have no shame but to talk about sex and the guys are hot on their trails! I say, forget about the guys and search for a decent one. Maybe you'll get lucky that you will have a guy who rejected a slutty girl who wants him. xD<br>  <br>  Oh boy, THAT'S WHAT I WANNA SEE!!! XD|`|soNHKzK2aa	the ones that go for slutty girls want sex and know theyre gna get it!|`|FE3h7PtUaa	listen sweet heart  its the sex is generally better|`|IdCJMrhKaa	get noticed, if you WANT SOMETHING just go for it!  the worse that can happen is rejection and I am assuming that you are in high school, so these "guys" go for that type of girl are just horny and eventually they may or may not realize that life is more than just looks...or maybe they will end up with an std who knows LOL. Regardless try not to worry or look for someone else honestly your better off just living life and if "love" comes by lucky you.|`|30aa5de976060fdd634d869b5085021caa	how old are you, 15-18?

It's just plain normal at that age, our hormones drives us not our brain, we care mostly for looks and how horny they can get us.|`|At7ynJ2Xaa	Its not that they "like" the slutty girls they just know its an easy way of getting "some" but when they want a relationship they dont pick those girls cause well there slutty. guys will be guys and face it sex is the number one thing on there mind.|`|CPBstHUiaa	Not all guys are like that the guys who go for the slutty girls are just looking to get some and they will just hit it and quit it|`|l9r632b4aa	its a very easy answer! guys go for the slutty girls becuase they figure that theywill go farther with them then someone like a nice pretty non slutty girl would do! <br>  <br>  i hope this helped:)|`|wApfe0hoaa	guys want action. sluts give action. win win situation.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	no judge is going to take a kid from his mom unless the mom is a threat to the child's well being. he isn't going to win, but u do need an attorney, don't go to court without one, and don't sign anything. he will have to pay child support, and if your unemployed he will have to pay alimony to u for a time. make sure u tell the attorney about the abuse, and if there is any documentation like if the police were ever called on him, use that too. don't go near him, fight with him, hit him, because he can use anything like this against u.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Get an attorney NOW, the custody is almost always awarded to the mother, he is trying to scare you, he has no love for you he only wants you back so he can abuse again so whatever you do do NOT go back to him, he is a classic abuser CONTROLLER and you need an attorney NOW so you can go over all this, you will win custody though esp when the abuse comes out...|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Did you expect him to say he'd fight for custody and lose?<br>  <br>  It would be highly unlikely that he would be awarded custody.  Please consult a lawyer.  You're going to need one.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	First of all, good for you for finally getting you and your son out of that unhealthy home.  Now that you are out, do not for any reason go back.  If you left because of the abuse then take my word for it, it won't change, probably get worse.  Now as to the custody, it is a threat and a threat only.  What judge would give a child to an abusive natured man?  Get a good attorney now, don't wait.  Even if you aren't ready to file for a divorce you need to establish custody and child support.  If you can't afford an attorney, go to the Social Services Department in your county and get information on legal aid in your area.  Don't hesitate, he may beat you to it for one thing and for another thing you need to get child support established.  Good Luck and stay strong.<br>  Red|`|FtyLwqR5aa	Yes I been there where you are now. I can tell you this. Go get an order of protection on him and get custody of the child right then. You have to use old police records to get an order. They will order him away from you and the child or go to your local woman shelter. They will help you. They usually give you a 2 week order then you go back and get a 2 year order. I promise you that you will be able to have the child and full custody. He may have visits depends on you but they will help you with the custody. Right now neither one of you have custody and if he gets his hands on the child you may not see him again.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Why is he going to win custody?  If he has abused you then the court will need to know this.  Do you have exact dates and such?  You need an attorney asap|`|lavd3UHmaa	He is using emotional blackmail in hopes that you will give in and go back.  There is actually a book called emotional blackmail - it would probably do you good to read it.  <br>  You need to document everything - and never speak poorly of your husband to your kid, or to the courts - just give them the facts.  Otherwise, they will think you are being vindictive and think it be too hostile an environment for your son to be in.<br>  If you don't want to consider joint custody with your husband, you have to have good reasons for this - not just because he was an *** to you.  Especially since it wasn't physical, it becomes a more he said she said situation. <br>  Most of all, you need to stand strong for yourself and your son.  All he has against you is your ability to give in to him.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	He can say it all he wants - my ex did - but when it came down to it, I got full custody.  No matter how much he threatens, the judge is the one who makes the decision.  I would get an attorney ASAP.  Call your state bar association if you don't know of any.  Contact anyone who may have ever witnessed any of his mental/emotional abuse and have them document it.  If you have kept a journal & written down any of these episodes, it will be helpful as well.  <br>  <br>  Stop & take a deep breath - you are away from him.  The road will be tough, but stay strong for your son.  You CAN do it.  Just keep telling yourself - all he is doing is threatening you to try to make you back down.  Don't give in to his threats.|`|LVrqRCh8aa	I don't have experience, But the best thing to try to agree on is shared parenting. If he wants full custody, Fight him until there's no end. Get a good lawyer who know's what their talking about. Make sure their good though! I paid my lawyer $3000 and lost custody of my daughter who I raised the first 3yrs of her life without him wanting anything to do with her! Make sure you get a lawyer that only deals with child custody cases, I wish I would have done that now =[|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	If he abused you in ANY way, you can put that against him and he will not get custody. They do not award custody to the abusive parent.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	you have more rights than him.. but get a lawyer anyway to help you .i hope you win .. and you did the right think in leaving him .. good on you|`|gjaPNWbTaa	Get a lawyer.  You're headed to court.<br>  <br>  I have no clue as to your claims so I can't take a side.  But you are going to court.|`|ecd46de3f5db92b6d26c258002cf6b8faa	Get a job, lawyer, life. In that order and do not worry about the future.|`|PZStgtdKaa	Yes a job, lawyer, and a life sounds good to me.|`|e80UbgPqaa	I congratulate you on your strength.  It takes a lot to leave an abusive situation.  Check with Legal Aid or your local bar association for a referral to a low or no cost family lawyer.  Your husband may not actually want custody but is just saying so to intimidate or frighten you.  You may want to go ahead and file for custody now, anyway.  Both parents have an equal right to the child, absent any court order.  Stay strong.  I would recommend counseling for you - self esteem takes a bashing where there is abuse going on.  Of course he is going to make promises but most importantly, consider your safety and the safety of your son, first.  There is a national Domestic Violence hotline that can also give you additional information.  Call them at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).<br>  <br>  Best of luck and I'll keep you in my prayers.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Don't go back to him 10 years is long enough to take that kind of abuse!! You did yourself and your son a favor getting out of that way of life.  He may make promises to change but if he didn't change in 10 years then he won't change now they are just empty promises to get you to come back. Now he is threatening to take your son in a custody battle?  As long as you are a good and loving mother and the courts have no reason to believe otherwise he won't have a chance.  Seek advice from a lawyer but as long as you provide a stable loving environment he doesn't stand a chance!  Be strong and good luck!|`|Ct81ceD9aa	not even, look he is just talking **** trust me, even if he had the balls to take this to court, you can say that he abbused of you your whole time of relation ship, besides your the women. Look even if he promises you the world and the galaxy dont come back cause he will not change NEVER. he will keep abusing of you until you commit something stupid. So dont do anything, just keep your kid and find someone else or if your happy with what you have then keep it this way but whatever you do dont go back with him or let him winn....|`|jrdtQi04aa	Get yourself a lawyer.  If you cant afford one, go to the legal aide office, and see what your options are.  If you have any pictures of the abuse suffered, keep them.  If you have any witnesses to the abuse, contact them.  He is trying to scare you into coming back into an abusive relationship.  He may be nice for a minute if you go back, then he will come up with some excuse as to why you "made" him beat you up again.  I know that sometimes people fight.  I know that sometimes it gets physical, but there is no excuse for a man just beating up on a woman because he had a bad day.  It's crap, and dont go back for more!|`|5KZdTMPDaa	It is nearly impossible for a mother to lose custody of a child.  They have to be worst of the worst, and still might have custody. <br>  So lawyer up, and get prepared for court.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	Here is my advice. Never try to take a child away from one of the parents. If you think you deserve full custody, you are wrong. The child is just as much his as it is yours. Stop being greedy and selfish.|`|wJ0iLG0raa	some1 close to me went through the same thing.<br>  <br>  move country if u have to.probably best idea.dont let him have any contact with u whatso ever.after all he will take ur son and ur life.<br>  <br>  get out, and stay out of his life if u know u deserve better.|`|F6dApOJtaa	Do you have proof of how he treated you? If you don't, I suggest you get some if you don't plan on going back with him.|`|AA11518532	Get a family lawyer right away!|`|tlxG2q04aa	Give him back his son.|`|YtDp0wjdaa	shouldnt you have gotten advice BEFORE u decided 2 leave?  duh|`|9QeV07zJaa	He will win.

4L1c8kF8aa	He sounds to be a very controlling and jealous person, which is not good at all. PLEASE LISTEN TO ME... this mental abuse WILL SOON become physical abuse, if you do not take actions soon... RESPECTING A WOMAN STARTS AT HOME........... I have been in your shoes, and I have dated those type of men.... and I have been beaten on many times by those type of men who CANNOT CONTROL THERE TEMPERS........... baby, my best advice for you, is to leave this man alone, BEFORE HE LOOSE HIS TEMPER AND BECOME PHYSICAL ABUSIVE TOWARDS YOU, God will ONLY give you so many red flags before the rope break....... I hope you will take my advice and leave him alone until he get some help for his temper.... GOOD LUCK AND MAY GOD BLESS.................................|`|VSWl45cKaa	Your parents are right to be concerned and that red flag you think you see is real. You don't deserve to be treated that way and he is not the only guy in the world. He has big issues with coping and his inability to do so over an honest mistake. The constant monitoring is also a sign that you are a possession to him. You are beginning to fear him and he may be the type to get physically violent. <br>  <br>  Get rid of him as soon as you can! Have enough self-esteem to do so. You are still young and have many more people to meet in life. One of the males has got to be far, far better than this creep.|`|CRk1goz4aa	Well, the fact that are asking is a RED FLAG. And the fact that your parents are worried...doesn't that say something as well? You are right...at 5 months this relationship should still be exciting. My question is....how do you think this will be after a year, if it's already like this in 5 months? Don't you want to be with someone that will make you happy and compliment you? If he gets outraged on small things....what will his reactions be with big things? What if he hits you? What if he hurts you? Is this really what you want to be worried about? Leave now before you get too deep or fall in love and then can't stop.

You should still be getting butterflies, and I was going to say that the fact that you're writing this speaks for itself (but you beat me to that too!) <br>  <br>  take your own advice and go ahead and get out. it's really considerate of you to offer to wait another month, but frankly, i dont see the need. If this relationship had been going on for well over a year and you were just having these problems, then yeah, but for him to be that angry that much of the time after only five months? theres definately a problem. at the very LEAST it doesnt sound like he's cut out for a relationship right now. <br>  <br>  seriously, do yourself a favor and go head and end it. you sound too level-headed to have to put up with that sort of thing.

If its constantly happening, theres a few questions that need to be asked.<br>  Is he in another relationship too?  If so, dont worry too much.<br>  Did she break up with him?  Probably no reason to worry.  Sometimes things dont work out relationship wise, but they are better friends.<br>  How long were they together?  If they were together for a long time and still talks to him a lot, then id be a little bit worried.<br>  Talk to her...use your best judgement.  <br>  If he broke up with her, then maybe shes not over him.<br>  <br>  Hope all works out well for you!|`|34e9e9fe0d4bc19d020a1064cd382799aa	lordy me i know how you feel.....if she doesn't like you then she would break up with you.....i know because my boyfriend is talkin on the phone with this other      all the time and first he told me he liked her and then he told me they were just friends.....he made me cry for 2 days straight.....but what i did was to just tell urself  "this is not going to bother me" and that might help.....or you could tell urslef that you have her and not the other guy.....i hope everything works out.....|`|AA11645875	my boyfriend has this really good "friend" and they were always together but he saisd tht she was like his best freind, but i resently found out tht he had cheated on me with her before. and i didnt know tht he went out wiht her before he went out with me. the point is if she texts him ALOT it probley menas tht she probley still has soem feelings for him. it deppends on how long they were together and how good their relationship is.. if  she acted happy about it when they broke up then i wouldnt be as concerned but if she was hurt by it then she probley feels tht by textin him she still has some sort of conection to him.

AA11332088	This is difficult to answer because each person will have different priorities. Here's some important to me:<br>  <br>  - time spent together and apart (what each of you expect)<br>  - activities that will stay the same even though you are dating (such as nights out with friends), and activities that will change while dating.<br>  - sexual boundaries (obviously this is something that you should speak about when the time is right)<br>  - goals in life, for instance, going to school, having kids, money, etc. (this is super-important to discuss early, but not too early, because you don't want to waste time with someone who does not have the same goals as you)<br>  - trust (find if you two have the same thoughts about it)<br>  <br>  this is what is important to me, and my husband and I discussed these issues in the first two months of dating.|`|a5a192b21d7f125dd5dcfd1d00174384aa	You have to trust eachother...otherwise you have nothing!

4cTujQgqaa	I like guys who are:<br>  Kind<br>  Nice <br>  Smart<br>  Funny <br>  A Gentlemen<br>  Someone who can communicate and be socially appropriote<br>  Someone who has drive and takes the initiative<br>  ...<br>  <br>  <br>  But, regardless of your personality type, there are two things you can do right now that will set you apart from all the other teenage guys.<br>  <br>  A- Learn to be a good communicator. There are precious few things that are sexier than a guy who can make and lead a good conversation. If you can walk up to a total stranger and maintain a minimally awkward conversation, you are way ahead of the game. Next time you are at lunch, try walking up to someone and starting a conversation. When you do so, ask questions that cannot be answered with a "yes" or a "no", and think of questions that go with what they have just said.<br>  For example, if they tell you that they play soccor, ask them what position they play, how long they've been playing, how did they start playing, what made them decide to start, etc.<br>  <br>  B- Become a gentlemen (in moderation, of course). Nothing makes a girl's day more than when a guy opens a door for her. Seriously. It makes us feel sexy and girly and beautiful and wonderful.... making us feel that way gives you uber brownie points. So, the next time a girl is walking behind you, open the door for her, smile, and say "hi." <br>  <br>  As for asking a girl out: Walk up to her, or call her up, and say "Hey, I was wondering if you'd like to ..... with me ..... night (or day...)?" or some variation of your choice.<br>  It's simple, classy, and just right.|`|37bf70fa8fe362fbfc7092bad2750f82aa	i like a guy is nice and sweet and repectful  i am 17 year s old  <br>  that is very  sexy<br>  <br>  here is my email brittanycmptn@yahoo.com <br>  <br>  id u want to write|`|dk1NJcJeaa	well,if a guy were to ask me out i would want them to ask me out personaly instead of having a friend ask me!i like a guy who is nice and sweet but at the same time isnt falling all over you or in your buissines either! he has to be somewhat attractive but not full of him self, if you got all that, COOL!!!!!!!                                       <br>  <br>  <br>                                            Ps:im only 13 so if you<br>  <br>  <br>  dont like my advice SORRY!!!!!!!!!|`|a6XaTJBsaa	18 - A guy who is real and not a fake.

"claudia non tremare..non ti posso far male,se l'amore è amore..."<br>  Baci e niente paura,l'amore è bello :)|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	sei grande!!ad avere fatto questa domanda!!volevo farla anch'io ma mi vergognavo!!!!|`|jtBtdWLnaa	Il dolore la prima volta è sicuro al 99%, poi cmq ci sono ragazze che ne sentono meno o addirittura nulla perchè l'imene è più elastico.

o5hVaI1Naa	..solitamente chi tradisce lo fa perchè nel proprio rapporto di coppia c'è qualche problema o gli manca qualcosa.. a volte capita di farlo anche per paura.. si ha così paura di soffrire ancora che si tradisce per mettere in secondo piano il sentimento per quella persona.. questo è quello che è successo a me.. poi è normale che il traditore "implori perdono" poichè anche se il suo gesto è stato fatto per un determinato motivo, è comunque un comportamento scorretto nei confronti del patner.. parlare, questa sarebbe la soluzione migliore, no tradire!!|`|70d1a03069a5f8a6bfc2a2e792d5fd09aa	alla base c'è qualche problema in una coppia,poi ci sono alcuni luoghi di lavoro dove una parola tira l'altra e si finisce per tradire.dalla parte dell'uomo è chiaro che deve chiedere scusa se è preso dal senso di colpa.l'altra parte quella che a tradito il marito,chi lo sa' se lui è disposto a perdonare.io alla donna gli do' il 70% di colpa all'uomo il 30%.|`|d0673f63a5820b6f65f2567f6afc3f54aa	cosa voi che pensi che non hanno dignità|`|og8rQPwJaa	io penso che gli risponderei così:<br>  "caro XXX, visto che quella persona ti intrigava e volevi provare un'emozione nuova, ora non ti obbligo a tornare alla solita routine di coppia che ti ha dato tanta infelicità... non voglio rovinarti la vita... vai pure con la persona interessante che hai trovato...<br>  ma prima, voglio:<br>  1)la casa<br>  2)i soldi<br>  3)la macchina<br>  e poi puoi andare tranquillo.<br>  <br>  le percentuali, il50/50, 20%lei 80%lui, 70%lei 30% lui, 55%lei 45%lui...<br>  SONO TUTTE BUBBOLE.<br>  succede e basta|`|B5KlrBe7aa	Quel tizio è un egoista, perchè la sua giustificazione significa che per soddisfare il capriccio dell'emozione nuova è disposto a far soffrire la sua partner. A meno che (ma è ben difficile) non lasci anche a lei la stessa libertà di "sperimentare"! In questo caso, comunque, la colpa non è 50/50, dato che il traditore non ha attribuito alla moglie motivi di insoddisfazione, quindi la responsabilità è tutta sua. E' proprio in queste situazioni che si deve chiedere perdono, perchè si è giocata una parte attiva e irresponsabile nella vicenda. Diverso, ma non automaticamente scusabile, sarebbe attribuire il tradimento a un momento di debolezza o di scarsa consapevolezza (ad esempio, per aver bevuto troppo). Altrettanto diverso è il caso in cui la coppia decida di comune accordo di concedersi eventuali distrazioni, ma allora non si tratterebbe di tradimento (che presuppone sempre l'inganno e la menzogna) bensì di infedeltà.|`|NYKnt0tgaa	Bella domanda...se la colpa è di entrambi, perchè uno solo si sente in colpa? Io penso che chi tradisce non ama più da un pezzo...altrimenti non sarebbe facile andare in giro e intrigarsi di un'altro/a...|`|VqT3yuG0aa	sono brutti i tradimenti e secondo me la colpa non e 50 / 50|`|YiKSR1vsaa	Quando in una coppia ci sono problemi, non è mai uno solo a causarli..se si accetta di essere felici in due, si deve accettare anche che le cose non vadano bene..Per il tradimento, potrei dirti che il traditore chiede perdono forse perché invece di affrontare i problemi(appunto) in modo maturo con il partner, ha preferito tradirlo, calpestare la sua dignità e non rispettare un sentimento che fino a poco prima comunque c'era...E' la cosa più schifosa che si possa fare!<br>  <br>  Se nella coppia non c'è alcun problema?boh..non lo capirei comunque, qualsiasi siano le motivazioni, anche le più gravi..non fa differenza, penserei solo che è un gran bastardo/a!<br>  <br>  Sposato in cerca di emozione?perché la moglie non è in grado di darne?l'emozione che cerca qual é?l'inganno?!solo scuse..mi spiace ma proprio non lo tollero!|`|lJlWGXxuaa	Se nella coppia non ci sono problemi, probabilmente c'è un poà di noia... e quindi questo diventa il problema invisibile... se uno riesce a intrigarti, vuol dire che non ti senti abbastanza "intrigato" nella tua vita di coppia... però in questo caso bisogna essere sinceri e lasciarsi (nel caso estremo) oppure cercare di cambiare comportamento.........<br>  un traditore (sposato) che vuole "provare emozioni nuove" di sicuro non doveva sposarsi, promettendo mari, monti e fedeltà al proprio compagno! Bisogna portare rispetto per il marito(moglie)! E' una scusa qualunque "mi intrigava" e non significa nulla... si possono avere contatti "intriganti" anche senza andare oltre un certo limite di amicizia, si può fare anche con persone dello stesso sesso......................................|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	quando si é sposati...é peggio....sai é una cosa che mi chiedo pure io....perché oogni benedetta volta sembra che si pentano...e tornano implorando perdono....mi domando cosa li spinge a fare una cosa del genere....forse si dice 50 e 50 perché molti se ne vengono fuori con la solita frase...tu non mi ami abbastanza....oppure:a volte mi fai incavolare col tuo modo di comportati....ma io mi domando perché l'essere umano é così complicato??|`|d33ee0e641d7fd83f6f40a9eec018f1baa	chi tradisce nn ama....<br>  se si ama nn esiste nessun altro...<br>  e se ci sono incomprensioni meglio rompere un rapporto ma nn tradire, troppo comoda come scusa, così nel caso si ha sempre un passatempo....<br>  ciao

Quella timida è un pò più riservata, riserva sempre sorprese di se, tratta meglio le persone e non si rende inaccessibile ed aggressiva, conta l'intenzione di voler approciare i rapporti con le altre persone che anche loro si renderanno disponibili a frequentarla, a loro volta.|`|0Irw1mbKaa	La ragazza timida è quella che sarà tutta da scoprire.<br>  La ragazza socievole sara quella alla cuale dovrai vivere.|`|76f225e8ffc4d607367f43e0e5546d99aa	Be preferirei una ne troppo socievole ne troppo timida|`|PcGcVIL8aa	SECONDO ME PER I RAGAZZI UN PO DI TIMIDEZZA VADA ANCHE BENE STIMOLANDOLI NELLA CONQUISTA MA POI DOPO UNA FASE INIZIALE DOPO AVERLI CONOSCIUTI MEGLIO BEH LA TIMIDEZZA DEVE LASCIARE IL POSTO ALLA SOLARITà SE NO IL RAGAZZO OVVIO K SI STUFA E VA ALLA RICERCA D RAGA PIU APERTE!!!!L'EQUILIBRIO è SEMPRE LA CS PERFETTA!|`|q9WmGKaAaa	direi socievole ma non troppo da farlo ingelosire... :-D|`|uXMPuRXOaa	E' come chiedere se siamo di destra o di sinistra...

Le principali associazioni che questi termini evocano riguardano l'aderenza a certi modelli comportamentali (relativi al vestiario, ai modi di convivenza sociale, alle forme di intrattenimento, agli interessi) e al ceto di appartenenza spesso in qualche modo legato al luogo di provenienza.

If he's accepting of your religious holidays then he shouldn't expect you to convert since you don't believe in it.   There's nothing really wrong with a dry reception, and as for children... introduce them to both religions and let them choose on their own. <br>  <br>  If he's not very liberal and is strict, then I don't think the relationship would work because he would be too demanding of you.
rEEB3Viwaa	Parliamo di compatibilità, non di emozioni... sono due cose ben diverse... Essere compatibili significa saper affrontare insieme situazioni che denudano completamente le due personalità, significa riuscire a ricavare dall'altro tutto ciò che a noi manca per rendere perfetto ciò che ai nostri occhi appare come un idillio, significa contare ciecamente sulle capacità dell'altro e affidarsi a lui come un fedele affida le proprie preghiere a Dio, con la stessa speranza, la stessa fiducia..<br>  Essere compatibili significa amarsi anche laddove l'amore sembra non esserci mai stato...<br>  E qui capisci che non necessariamente parlo di amore, ma anche di amicizia (quella V E R A)..<br>  Quindi a parer mio solo quando due persone sentono di conoscersi veramente a fondo si può parlare di compatibilità...|`|57q7CJcXaa	2 me dp 1 po' d tempo...xò magari al 1 appuntamento se c'è la scintilla potresti capire subito ke siete compatibili...|`|KODd4bPjaa	secondo me dipende dalla persona..per alcune si capisce subito, per altre con il tempo..|`|QiXO0rd8aa	secondo me se t da emozioni lo capisci subito se si è compatibili con il tempo fidati!|`|SHSBYSogaa	il primo appuntamento è di solito falsato dall'emozione dal desiderio fisico dagli ormoni, certo se c'è qualcosa di più si sente subito ma la compatibilità di carattere si scopre col tempo conoscendo meglio la persona.|`|VtF35Kboaa	conoscendo la persona..quindi col tempo!|`|hxKRnmWXaa	a seconda...puoi capirlo subito, ma se la persona non si "scopre" completamente, puo anche volerci del tempo....non molto, ma puo servire!!!|`|l9CpyTUZaa	Con il tempo.|`|458a9b87e855c351c2c734a4721a1604aa	se si è compatibili si capisce col tempo..se una persona ti emoziona invece lo capisci subito!|`|Ka4vSTGcaa	io lo capisco subito, dal primo sguardo. e lo capisco quando mi sento bene ed emozionata e non vedo l'ora di rivederlo|`|O4ZtiUqaaa	bè di solito si dovrebbe capire dal primo appuntamento come capita a me!! xò boh..c'è gente che magari non si apre subito caratterialmente e ha bisogno di più tempo x farsi conoscere..solo che ci  vuole pazienza!! ma se non hai pazienza non è il tuo tipo e si ricade sul discorso di prima..che si capisce dal primo appuntamento!!!!!!!!|`|4QwK1vjuaa	scherzi?Ci vuole molto ma molto tempo x capirlo..|`|RFg3vWNmaa	si capisce subito se può esserci feeling...<br>  se sarà o no quello giusto si capisce solo con il tempo!|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	credo si capisca subito!!!!!!!|`|dJUzCAdgaa	La compatibilità si capisce frequentandosi.<br>  Al primo appuntamento si può solo vedere se scatta un'alchimia fisica e mentale|`|eb8dd95f53878aefd88d93f9e6324c68aa	ci puoi mettere anche anni, fidati!|`|v24gefGqaa	Io credo alle sensazioni immediate...

Although you say you do not want to date him I dont think you realise the possible repucissions it could have on your freindship, you could be left with noone to talk to.<br>  <br>  It will also put your teacher in a very diffucult position as sometimes teachers have to report this to senior members of staff just incase, this could be embarrassing, at the end of the day you have to think if it all worth it.<br>  <br>  Realistically nothing can happen, maybe you're just confusing liking asomeone with a very cose frienship and bond.|`|BJIIwQwJaa	every girl goes through the stage of liking their teacher. that feeling will die out soon, trust me. as long as another guy (your age) walks into the picture and likes you a lot, you will forget about this teacher. trust me. he has a wife, and child. believe me, he won't do anything even if you told him you liked him.|`|VymTPIOraa	PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE KEEP THAT TO YOURSELF.TRUST ME IT WILL BE FOR THE BETTER|`|eg2IVVUlaa	Give him a card for being a great inspiration.

You will get over it and find someone your own age.
U4u8C6EJaa	I guess there's two things we need to know. First, does the guy like her too? And second does your bestfriend know you like the guy? If your bestfriend does not know that you like him, try telling her, in my point of view, it would be beneficial if you let her know especially since she is your bestfriend. It may be a little hard to spill it out but then it's really better if you tell her than having her hear it from someone else, right?.. If the guy likes her I guess that's the time--the best time for that matter--to make room for your friend coz if the guy does not feel something for your friend, it's really unfair on you part, it's not really about being selfish. Besides you can't really push the guy to like your friend as well.  What if he really likes you but the you keep pushing him to your friend?|`|9f5630efa81ecd99b334342aa38765c9aa	well wait see how things go.|`|EzcXpKZGaa	i think that it be best if you told her that you like him as well. <br>  it's better if she hears it from you than if she hears it from someone else. if you were really her best friends you wouldn't keep something like this away from her. i suggest you talk 2 her in person.|`|8a03f9ea50aee60e6c76f4a1c8a1c7f2aa	That's  a tough one, good luck.|`|a88e34850d875043658e58173ef2c48daa	You and your best friend should talk this through and see if she like him as much as you.|`|b8bb831ebfe0b79c022f714c9b7d8031aa	let her and this guy be together. if that guy got back than it would not be your fault. let the guy decide.|`|sK3WBRVsaa	hi<br>  i think u should not do this. you must step forward and say that about your feelings.its different that she is your best friend but don't let anyone to come in between ur love. this way u r not justifying ur love and as well as friendship.

Te quiere tanto que ella misma no sabe qu'e va a hacer para que t'u le muestres los mismos afectos y ..... es ah'i donde est'as errado. Ella necesita ser tu 'idolo, porque t'u lo eres para ella, al ignorarla con despechos como est'as haciendo s'olo la hieres en su mundo de fantas'ias que ella tiene para ti. Chico, mu'estrale cu'anto sientes por ella y ad'orala como tu hermanita haci'endole saber que siempre en silencio t'u le perdonas todo porque tu la quieres mucho. REMEDIO SANTO !!!!!.

I mean, if living with your foster parents have not given you such skill is probably because they do everything for u.<br>  <br>  That is just an assumption. You know best if this assumption is correct or not. <br>  <br>  My suggestion is that you find a place not too far away, from people you trust, so that if you need help you may seek them out. This of course is if it is absolutely necessary for you to leave right away. <br>  <br>  Now, I personally, believe that if it is barable, you should stay with your foster family, or seek another (if that's possible), while at the same time seek someone who could teach you the skills you require to become an independant person, and once those are acquired, then you may leave. <br>  <br>  Again, all this advice is based purely on the information you have offered here. Be responsible enough to take the advises offered in this forum and apply them to your actual situation (I mean, take into account your complete situation) before applying them. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Kfr8AQ4Qaa	well i just want to share this thing to you. though its different from yours. i lived w/my parents til 24yrs.(im 29 now) i just decided recently to go lived my own for the sake that i have a son already and not getting married at all, now i live here in japan & strive hard for. its hard w/o my parents around but i get used to it... i cry everyday & every night but now that im settled here already i know i make right decision not only for myself but for my son too its crazy you know cause i dont know one no body here no friends and everything... but they are so proud of me (parents) and im proud of myself cause i thought i cant do it but then i just did what is right to do. <br>  I guess you just have to be strong cause living by yourself will make you "YOU". If your goin to be honest w/them and said that you cant do it then dont. dont push yourself hard, then if you dont want to leave there anymore then you have to be strong for your sake. choose right friends, choose right path. you will be independent sooner or later. if your still scared i guess you shouldnt leave the foster care. its ur decision dear.

Tell him this is your wedding too, and "we" should "compromise" on where we will be wed.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	my advice is leave him.  honestly, if he isnt willing to comprimise on wedding vendors (which is supposed to be both of your day) then what is going to happen when it comes to ACTUAL marraige problems?<br>  <br>    he sounds really controlling and like kind of a tightwad, especially if you offered to pay for part of all this.  <br>  <br>  leave him and find a guy who is willing to listen to you and learn to comprimise|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	BEWARE...he is setting the stage for what hel'll be like when you are married. Nip it in the bud before it's too late. You SHOULD have a say in choosing vendors, and you SHOULD have an opinion and if he can't handle that, than tell him it's not going to work out.|`|e9YFTyzZaa	Let this 'problem' be a WARNING!<br>  He seems Stubborn and Controlling and NOT willing to give you a VOICE!<br>  I'd let him pick EVERYTHING he wants and NOT show up for the Wedding.....in other words, "DON'T MARRY THIS LOSER"!<br>  It's only a HINT/Beginning of how (Controlling)your Married life will be!|`|GvamTVqAaa	Realize this is how it will be for the rest of your life and either deal with it or dump him..|`|x5avs3gnaa	I would suggest talking to him and asking him about it. It might be hard, but if you too could come up with a compromise, it would probably make things easier.  I know planning a wedding can be stressful, but it's a day for both of you, so both views should be involved, not just his.  Good luck.|`|JCAgvgTxaa	You write:  I just feel like my opinion does not matter and its whatever he says goes. <br>  <br>  And you want to marry him?  Why?<br>  <br>  You write:  How do I handle this?<br>  <br>  End the relationship.  Seriously.  If this guy is not interested in pleasing you and making compromises with you, then that will not improve after marriage.  End it now.  Go date someone who respects your opinions.|`|q8eue7CRaa	Is he like this with everything? Wedding planning is definitely stressful, but it shouldn't be a huge battle between you two! He'll be like this when it comes to raising a family and buying a house too, I'm sure. Be careful.|`|CkN4pgpCaa	Do some research on your own and present it to him.  Just tell him that you understand that he wants to save money, but the wedding is for both of you and your input is important too.  He may be concerned that you will go way over budget with the vendors.  So if you have some quotes from vendors that you have looked into that fit in with his budget, he may realize that he underestimated you.  Tell him that you want to work with him on this...  and he needs to trust you and listen to your opinions too.<br>  <br>  I really don't think that leaving him is necessary.  That seems sort of extreme.  Weddings are stressful and planning them is not romantic.  Lots of couples butt heads over who is working on what, budget, venues, vendors, etc.<br>  <br>  He's probably just stubborn about money and worried that this day will cost a fortune.  A lot of vendors (flowers and photography for example) sooo much more for weddings than other events.  I am shocked that people actually think you should leave him for this!  I will brave the thumbs down from them and tell you that you shouldn't, unless there are much bigger issues than this.
gLXzVbm8aa	i guess you will find out in 2 days|`|xbISxnmfaa	No she just isnt that into you.|`|d0wJRB2Saa	Yeah it does sound like she's loosing interest. Leave her behind, find someone who really likes you :D|`|37M3dkkRaa	maybe she is just busy. did she sound sarcastic when she told you that she liked how things were going? if she did, she may not like you that much. but if she wants to hang out with you, maybe its not because she wants to break things off. i know when i wanted to break things off with guys i just stopped talking to them, totally avoided them or i just told them. ...i think she's probably just busy|`|O0pYOOpAaa	It depends on the girl dude. If she is a fast paced girl then she could be very well losing interest in you. If she is a slow paced girl, then she might have well been busy. You get me.<br>  <br>  When I was in highschool, I dated a chick older than me. She was 16 and I was 14. She dumped me for a guy that actually put moves on her, unlike me at the time was still getting used to seeing boobs. I got to touch them before she broke up with me though :)|`|NzzH2VNSaa	it depends if she likes you then how can she lose interest i na week? en less you mess upped ...or shes banging a white guy to|`|EYt8H5N2aa	I think that if she was losing interest she would not have to get together and meet with you just to tell you. She could just ignore you. Maybe she just like that you guys are taking things slow. Prepare for the best and the worst at the same time and you should be ok. Some things may be going on with her but I can say that you should never ignore your instincts. Pay attention to them and prepare to accept the things that you cannot change!|`|ukVNUgPFaa	she may just be busy. quit being so insecure, girls def dont like that!! if she isnt into you, so what, there are plenty of her out there to replace her. to me it doesnt seem like shes going to break it off.  calm down, although its cute when you guys get flustered, its not attractive to new gfs.|`|NkcNlFgzaa	I honestly feel like I'm reading what happened to me. Dude, I guarantee she'll either hit you with the "let's just keep things as friends line" or tell you she's ready for something more. At least she had the decency to talk to you face to face. Alot of guys don't get that chance...|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	1.  talk to her<br>  2. regardless of your conversation (unless she dumps you) why cant you just hang out with her and enjoy the time together instead of ruining it with your emotional needs  <br>  <br>  life is too short man up!|`|1jIzBUkhaa	is she busy cause she works , you will know what is going on in friday. what ever it is , be a man.|`|ZmUGi9PLaa	Relax. just hang out with her and have a good time. If your worrying all the time your not going to be any fun to be with.|`|IdCJMrhKaa	just wait for friday, don't call her beforehand and whatever happens...happens. <br>  <br>  "there are plenty of fish in the sea"|`|JxNDTbS4aa	beak up with her before she does. it will save your ego.|`|K0URKfhvaa	yo son. shes bangin a black guy.|`|wJ6qa5dqaa	hey... at least she probably wants to tell you its over. i was seeing this guy for about 5 months. then recently he disappears. no txts, no replies, co calls, nothing. and when i txt and ask if things are ok, he said yeah, he's just busy with a lot on his mind. 2 weeks later i'm fed up with being ignored. he still won't say things are over. so i moved on, i said goodbye. and still nothing from him.<br>  <br>  so at least if she's going to end it, be thankful that you'll KNOW!<br>  <br>  [left in the dark]
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	unless something has drastically changed about him, u shouldn't go back. abusive men don't just change, and unless he has a decent job, and a place to live, its probably going to be just more of the same. words are cheap, they mean nothing what means something is a persons behavior and if they have made any real changes in them self. sure its always going to be flattering when an ex gets back in contact with u, sends u a sweet card, but it doesn't mean anything at all, only that he doesn't have anyone now, so he thinks u will come back to him. he is immature, abusive and very selfish and when someone forces them self on u when u say no, it tells u allot about his character, and how your life with him will be.if it were me i wouldn't even entertain the thought of being with him again, unless i liked torture.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	He became violent with you, choked you, and committed rape on you--even if you don't want to call it that.  He doesn't get a second chance.  <br>  <br>  move on and thank god you got away.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	Stay head while your at it. He will only do the same again to you and even worse. It is very hard to get out of that type of situation so stay where your at and let it go. Find you a REAL man.|`|UFOdwXgfaa	NO you shouldn't<br>  <br>  It's to late to say the I love you and I miss you crap. The damage is done. Move on dear|`|34b40Vu3aa	Answer: NO.|`|lN5d688gaa	a BIG NO!!!  he physically hurt you.  that's not good.  move on.|`|mRffo5G8aa	Several red flags here...Choking...living with his parents...abusive...forcing himself on you, which by the way is NOT intimacy...your conflicted.  Those are all red flags leading to the truth that you should stay away from this guy.  It seemed you started out right, friends first, but slipped into something less than a healthy relationship.  If you are satisfied with your life at the moment...disregard this man's invitation to revisit that unhealthy life and move on to what your future holds, based on your new and improved decision making skills.  Good Luck|`|9QeV07zJaa	I guess if you like the choking thing and forced sex. Sure, go for it. Maybe it will escalate into something even more exciting like a black eye or  a trip to the dentist. Of course he still loves you, you are easy to manipulate. <br>  <br>  Try another direction.|`|lzooHi0Baa	Second parts are never good.   Means, once bad, second time worse.   Please do not make this mistake.  If you need company or are insecure, do something else about it, but do not expose yourself to further abuse|`|uuopzkeNaa	NO !! an ex is an ex for a REASON remember that.|`|y4w6ybr3aa	Run..and cut all contact with this guy. He physically choked you!<br>  Were you pregnant at the time, did this have something to do with the miscarriage??<br>  Huge red flag|`|HlR7egIeaa	Oh sh*t girlfriend!!! Stay far far away! He CHOKED YOU and forced himself on you? Find someone who respects you and would never dream of hurting you. Believe me, they are out there. Even if they say they won't do it again, they usually do.  And just think, if he's that way with you... how would he be with a child?? <br>  <br>  Best of luck girl!!!<br>  <br>  PS> Love this quote lol:<br>  <br>  "Why would you ever want to marry your first husband? Its like finding sour milk, putting it in the trash for a couple of days, and then wondering... GEE, I wonder if it tastes better now??"

FKwuuiwSaa	If you're in a secure relationship and you think she wouldn't cheat on you, then what's the problem? The fact that you're asking this says that you either don't find her very trustworthy (because if she was trustworthy, she'd turn down guys who try to hit on her), or that you are insecure about yourself and don't think you're appealing enough to keep her.|`|WdW1ga14aa	Don't trip, there is nothing wrong with a girl having single men for friends.

You have to learn to trust your girlfriend, otherwise you guys have bigger issues than her hanging out with guys.

If she knows you're concerned, I'm sure she'll answer anything you ask her.  However, if you ask too many questions, you may appear too clingy or even nosy, and that's a turn-off.<br>  <br>  Look at it this way...guys are allowed to have friends that are girls, so isn't the same that girls are allowed to have friends that are guys?  I'm a girl and the majority of my friends are girls as well, but I like hanging out with or talking to guy friends just for a little variety and a different point of view.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|kvaS0MP9aa	If she's respectful enough of you she wouldn't take it as far as having drinks at there house alone. I don't know any male that wouldn't feel iffy about that. Its also the other way around, would she like it if you were hanging out with single women? Maybe you both could try finding other couples and hanging out as friends all together?|`|ZDqdYhdGaa	You can't control her life and you have to just trust her. If you try to put rules on her it will backfire and she will eventually end up leaving you. There are always going to be other people out there, and not just when hanging out with friends, they are everywhere you turn. You have to have trust and faith in her and let go of your own insecurities.|`|BnT7HNgtaa	I personally have many guy friends and am in a serious relationship that has been going on for almost 3 years.

My wife and I were married for 6 years before we started a family.  We both worked, made great money, drove nice cars, ate out regularly, traveled, partied, experimented, and had a pretty wild time.  <br>  <br>  But when we were tired of the hangovers and wanted something more, we tried for a baby.  And we were blessed with not one but TWO baby girls.  They will be 3 this year, but the last 3 years have been VERY rough on us with her not working to stay home to be a mom, me working harder than ever but earning less in a down economy, and having not one but TWO small children to take care of.   Now, a movie and fast food is about as exciting as it gets.  Can't believe we're actually the same people who used to get suites in vegas, have cocktails in ultra lounges, get lap dances at topless bars, and have sex in the back of limos while couples we met at the strip club did the same thing.<br>  <br>  So yeah........when you can figure out a way or find an answer that has suggestions on how to be YOU again while still being devoted parents, let me know.  But after 3 years of things being the way that they've been, going the way that they're going, and heading in the direction that they are heading with us drifting farther and farther apart as man and wife.........I sincerely hope there's a solution for both of us.|`|gmaCvh00aa	You can each stand on a cliff with a sheer drop between you and put the baby on a wire and make it walk.<br>  <br>  DREW BLOODSD SAID - Can't believe we're actually the same people who used to get suites in vegas, have cocktails in ultra lounges, get lap dances at topless bars, and have sex in the back of limos while couples we met at the strip club did the same thing.<br>  <br>  Just think of the fun you will have telling those stories to your twins someday!|`|gjaPNWbTaa	You don't have ANYONE who can babysit once in a while so you can just go out dancing or something?  <br>  <br>  Maybe find another couple with a kid and "trade" - no money involved - i.e. you watch their kid one night a week, they watch yours one night a week.|`|0HUHHzIQaa	Do you have a family member that could watch her sometimes?<br>  If so, you could ask them to watcher her for a few hours while you guys have a romantic night, even if it means staying in, having a nice supper and watching a movie --- spending quality time together doesn't have to be expensive.<br>  If you don't have any close relatives who could watch the child, and don't want to spend the money on a babysitter, try to find another couple in your situation, who might have a young kid too. What you can do is babysit for each other, at no cost. Could be every week one of the couple has a "evening off" and the other babysits. So if this week you'd babysit, the next week it would be your turn. Would give you an evening with your husband every two weeks just the two of you.<br>  <br>  You can go on walks with your child, play, give her her bath together, bring her with you guys when you go grocery shopping...lots of ways to spend time together as a family.|`|AA11518532	You should find different programs and events through your local parks and recreation department.  They usually have family events that are free or very low-cost.  You can also go for romantic picnics with your hubby and take a packed lunch with chocolate covered strawberries to a lake or the beach (if you’re close to one).  You can also just take walks, go hiking, and biking (alone or with the baby).  There are a lot of things you can do, it’s all about creativity.|`|8GfEEzzhaa	As a family - you can read to the kid children stories. She is of course too young to understand but it develops the brain very well in a baby. Also the babies get very relaxed when they hear voices (especially of their parents) in a calm setting (as in when reading stories). Apart from that when I was young my parents told me they used to build towers out of small carton boxes I would have great fun smashing them.<br>  Alone...have special dinners at home. Get friends to come over now and then. Thats again what my parents did on tight budget (I still don't have children, so I don't know first hand).|`|bS5dGxBtaa	Go out and explore nature.

i4bjQbPcaa	Go on ebay for your dress or go to a local college to get a trainee fashion student to do one for you in exchange for the pics in their portfolio.  You could also do this to get a cheap cake.|`|sGP6s7uraa	If you are having an evening wedding, keep in mind your guests will expect a meal and not just finger foods.  This is gonna cost ya.  I live in the States so I really can't help you with the venues or anything local.  Some advice I can give you, too, is to keep the guest list as small as possible, rationalize what is needed the most (for example, do you really need centerpieces or programs?), find a reasonably priced gown, have your FH wear a really nice suit, use flowers (if you want them) that are in season, use limited flowers and lots of greenery (makes a really fresh feel) and you may have to opt out on alcohol.  Good luck and keep reading posts here and you'll come up with some really great ideas.|`|7G4hisdzaa	Unfortunately I am in the US, so I don't know of a paticular venue that would work for you.  But here, I have found that my church is the best place--it's affordable too.  <br>  If you do a late wedding, make sure you plan it after dinner hours, otherwise your guests will probably expect a meal.  Start brainstorming on close family/friends that have special talents.  Is anyone a fantastic cook?  Anyone have a passion for music?  Any good photographers in the family?<br>  If a church doesn't do it for you, check into parks.  Your best bet will be one that has an indoor facility if it rains--tents here cost $1000, and that's just for the poles and top.  If you want a floor it's $1000 more.  <br>  Look for dresses at the end of this wedding season.  They will be marked down.  Also look during prom season, you can find great deals on white "prom" dresses.  Two of my friends bought from Penny's.  <br>  My fiances cousin is catering for us (thank god!).  We are buying the supplies at Sams club (a bulk food club), and she's making it ALL!<br>  Remember that you will probably have to rent a lot of your supplies, so if you start checking prices now, you'll be much better off.  <br>  Congrats!  Hope I helped!|`|8dd6iuwqaa	the best thing to do is to go to ezweddingplanner.com, because it has a budget built right in, and you can custimize it entirely. i don't know if they have a GB version. If you want to really cut costs, I'd suggest getting a wholesale dress, they've got some really beautiful ones at <a href="http://www.lightinthebox.com/wholesale-Wedding-Apparel_c1180." rel="nofollow">http://www.lightinthebox.com/wholesale-W...</a> If you don't want to pay the cost for catering, I would suggest getting a friend or family member to do all the cooking, and just provide the food, like stuff for tea sandwiches, or meetballs with a toothpick stabbed in them. There are a lot of good sites that can help you get a cheaper wedding, that'll still look amazing, you just have to go to dogpile or google and search. Happy bargin hunting! and congradulations!|`|3lxagSP7aa	i can tell you how I did mine, mine was so cheap. I rented the tuxes, and I bought my dress on ebay from china it was gorge and fitted custom made for me 70 euro the dress cost. I bought my flowers from ebay, they are silk but I was looking on the next website they do fabulous bouquets and deliver them fresh from 10 pound sterling. I bought page boys suit on ebay 30 euro. ebay is legend, i even bought all the balloons for reception for less than 30 euro and disposable cameras. We booked flights with Ryanair to Rome and booked into a hotel, Hotel King it was lovely, that cost 500 euro I think for four nights flights were 200 euro for us and a bridesmaid and groom,. The parents went but we asked them would theypay for themselves as a present. We got married in church san silvestro which is on internet for 500 euro and I founf out later you can rent horse and carraige like taxis there for less than 30 euro. we got taxi from church and to church 20 euro dont order chauffer as cost 45 euro each way just ask for taxi hour before in hotel. and we went to the abbey theatre irish pub in rome an got a meal for nine for 109 euro starters included. drinks are on offer when u get meal for 2 euro each. we had party at home booked into a cheap venue 10 euro a head 100 guests and a dj for 4 hours for 250 euro and we had blast let everyone else by drinks and the buffet food was supplied. Gretna was an option for me to but it less expensive to go to Rome, the weather was fab and our honeymoon was the stay we had fantastic picturesx

Make sure to have a towel under you, that way if you bleed you can clean up.<br>  <br>  Also, let him be on top. Its called missionary. Its better, tell him to go easy! With the thrusting, its gonna be a good experience for both of you, just use that condom & be careful. Take your time, don't rush. You need to spred wide, also so he can get in with out going in your butt. lol. Good luck & best wishes|`|xyxSIJ8kaa	My first question would be how old are you guys?  I know that 1 1/2 years seems like a long time, but it really is not comparied to losing your virginity some one you probably won't spend your life with.  Sex has turn into something that people do, just because...I'm with you for 6months...1year.... 2years....or 4 years.  My theory is that your personality changes every year and so do expectation of life.  But at least you are practicing safe sex.  The way I see it; if it did not work out leave it alone, it probably was a reason for it.

FpjfGM29aa	Ok i had the same problem. I thought i was falling for my fiance's sister and the wedding was a week away, but I realised that she was like my sister and I didnt love her like that. You are probably just think your falling for him because you and your fiance have been fighting alot lately. You probably do love his brother but only in a sisterly way. Trust me you will not think that you love him within a 3days or so. If you do then you are going to have to be sure that you really love him because your going to regret it if you break it off with your fiance. That is totally your dicision though. I hope you make the right dicision. Good Luck!
YcBuONAwaa	It seems as thought they are scared of their little girl growing up...they knew that sooner or later she would be interested in boys (they were hoping later rather than sooner by the sounds of things)...You should confront them and let them know that yes she is your cousin but she is also your best friend. You love her and would not let any harm come to her. They also might be afraid that because you are older you would have alot of infulence on her and i would say that she looks up to you alot...they would most likely be afraid that you may tell her things about boys and relationships that she is a little young to hear. Just sit down and talk to her parents and let them know that like them you have her best interests at heart too...|`|fam2zM4saa	All I have to say is screw her parents cause apparently they r judging a book by its cover!

My mom had mentioned that she wanted to get engaged there.  My dad being the smart man remembered this.  The morning he proposed, my mom woke up to a note.  It was a riddle.  The answer led her to another location.  The scavenger hunt took her all over town.  She went to best friends' houses, where the first met, had their first date, etc.  The last note led her to the Rusty Troller.  When she showed up my father was waiting in a nice suit and a candle lit dinner. <br>  <br>  My friends brother recently got married.  He met his now wife at college a few years ago.  They were in town one weekend and before going back were going to go to another city about 3 hours away to "see some friends".  They woke up very early, way before sunrise.  When they got close to their destination, he blind folded her.  When they got there he helped her out of the car and led her into a field.  When he took the blind fold off she was standing in front of a hot air balloon.  They got in and went up just as the sun was coming up.  He had given the hot air balloon attendant a camera before hand without her knowing.  When he went down on one knee the attendant was able to capture every moment.  He later developed the film and put it in a picture collage.<br>  <br>  I think both of these proposals are very fun and a great story to tell later on.|`|1abdaf34c4b381fdc79bbbaa61cd6d95aa	I haven't been proposed yet but when I do i hope that is at Disneyland.

All our friends and family knew, I asked her parents ahead of time.  Went to San Antonio, Tx and I proposed in front of the Alamo with some of our closest friends there.  I got on one knee after it had just rained, got my pants all dirty.  I did this because we were both History majors and are now both History teachers.

Cuando una persona se siente atraída por otra como consecuencia de lo que tiene o representa: riqueza, poder, clase social, etc. Es lo que llamamos el amor por interés.

La timidezza nn è 1 difetto.. anzi molte volte è qualcosa di molto tenero. Oserei dirti che mi piacciono i ragazzi timidi, sono così dolci! Ma come si sà..  il troppo storpia. Quindi la tua esagerata timidezza ti limita... <br>  Il fatto che nn hai mai avuto una ragazza, forse nn dipende da te.. ma forse dal fatto che nn hai trovato quella giusta in grado di farti perdere la testa e la timidezza. Ma c'è sempre 1 prima volta per tutti..   Fatti coraggio! Un bacio|`|F9T0tp4Xaa	tu! è perchè sei brutto come la fame! non te lo dicono perchè vogliono essere gentili, ma per sapere la verità, prendi quello che ti dicono e gira il significato! sei bello = sei brutto!<br>  sei simpatico = stammi lontano!! è così via... <br>  se vuoi una donna, o la paghi o l'afferri con forza! no alternative|`|OIN1AsNWaa	Per me cosi' un po si nasce<br>  <br>  Non so esattamente cosa nn vada in te, ma mi ritrovo quasi a leggere quello che avrei potuto scrivere io 7 anni fa quando di anni ne avevo 17 e non avevo ancora dato il mio primo bacio, un po  perche volevo che fosse cn ragazze "impossibili" ma soprattutto perche cn le ragazze in generale nn riuscivo quasi ad aprire bocca se non per dire qualche scemata da poco.Non ho mai avuto problemi di amici ma in quanto a ragazze ero il classico imbranato...per usare un eufemismo.E più passava il tempo e più diventava difficile da affrontare come cosa,anche io a farmi le stesse tue domande, a viverla sempre peggio...<br>  <br>  Poi quasi per caso l'incontro cn una ragazza tedesca (in vacanza)fece scattare il colpo di fulmine e non ci capii piu niente, ero perso di lei,e mi dimenticai quasi di essere impacciato (sicuramente lo ero ancora ma almeno mi ero buttato) e all'ultimo giorno con tutto il coraggio che avevo (e grazie anche ad un mio amico) la baciai e scopri cn sorpresa che lei non ci credeva quasi piu, che pensava che non mi piacesse perche in tutti quei giorni la sfioravo a malapena.Non ci potevo credere...<br>  Quella sera avevo fatto la cosa piu bella e allo stesso tempo irrazzionale (perche per anni mi ero detto che il primo bacio doveva essere con la mia prima ragazza vera,non cn una "meteora") della mia vita e cio' mi cambiò completamente la prospettiva delle cose<br>  <br>  Fu il mio giorno X.quello della svolta<br>  <br>  Da allora ho cominciato ,giorno dopo giorno (perche nni si cambiano certi atteggiamenti con uno schioppo di dita) ad essere sempre un po piu sciolto, meno rigido nei rapporti cn le ragazze,anche partendo dalle piccolissime cose.<br>  <br>  I consigli che ho letto sn tutti molto validi, ascoltali, cerca di uscire un po di piu e aprirti un po di piu cn gli altri, e se il primo giorno sembrera un impresa impossibile il giorno dopo lo sembrera di meno e via dicendo. <br>  <br>  Ricordati...DA COSA NASCE COSA<br>  <br>  Spero che arrivi presto il tuo giorno X|`|53ubAySOaa	Allora và, esci, cerca di sforzarti ed essere migliore. Bisogna fare un gran lavoro su se stessi! Pensa kee io ero così timida che quando mia mamma mi kiedeva di andare a far la spesa, mi eclissavo x la timidezza, poi ho deciso che così non andava e con molto sforzo, ho modificato quella parte di me che mi rendeva antipatica o sostenuta (a volte i timidi vengono percepiti come altezzosi). Ora, che di anni ne sono passati un po' dall'adolescenza, devo sire ke sn soddisfatta. Ho raggiunto un alto livello nel mio ambito lavorativo, sociale e personale. Devi tirare fuori la grinta, magari và a giocare a pallavolo, calcio, qualcosa dove tu possa confrontarti con gli altri coetanei.

SE AMA o NO SE AMA pero eso de medias tintas no va conmigo. Eso de que está confundida, porque? a que se debe su confusión?. Yo en tu caso le dijera que mejor dejemos eso hasta ahí que se dieran un tiempo para que ella reflexione que es lo que siente por ti en realidad, ya que tu no estas dispuesto a estar con una mujer que se siente confundida e insegura en cuanto a lo que siente por ti.<br>  <br>  Se que te dolerá, pero es mejor que tomes esta alternativa para que ella reflexione, y si es para ti, ten por seguro que ella solita te buscará y volverá a ti pero ya sin confusión.<br>  <br>  Es que piensas estar siempre con ella Y TENIENDO DUDAS? no verdad!!! por eso pienso que sería lo más conveniente separarse y darse un tiempo para reflexionar.<br>  <br>  Suerte y espero que todo se solucione.|`|yrJP4SmZaa	Tienes que ser fuerte y darte tu lugar, es decir deberias darle una leccion de una semana sin verla ni hablarle para que se defina y no ande con jueguitos de si pero no, o no pero si.<br>  Veras que saldra algo bueno, si te deja es que no te queria y si no te deja te dara tu lugar y no seguira con juegos para darte celos.  como ves? <br>  <br>  Muchas veces esto es lo que las mujeres necesitamos para saber lo que queremos.

Talvez quiere q luches x ella es vdd ya están en una relación y no se si eres detallista y esas cosas pero si sabes q a ella le gustan esas cosas ps trata con eso... <br>  <br>  Salu2|`|TljPklqRaa	Mira, tienes que ponerte firme en tu decición, ella no te puede manejar diciéndote que esta confundida, hoy si, ma?ana no, etc, etc. Si te dio motivos para no confiar en ella, tienes toda la razón, Si una persona me dice que está confundida, por mas que le ame y sienta morirme, le digo que tomaremos distancia unas dos semanas, tiempo para reflexionar, y que se decida, porque si sigues así, cada día te enamorarás mas, y después sufrirás mucho mas. Hay un dicho y es muy cierto, si amas a alguien, dejalo libre, si vuelve a ti, es porque es tuya,si no vuelve, es porque nunca lo fue.<br>  El dolor siempre va estar en toda relación amorosa, siempre alguien sale lastimado. Uno sufre mas que otro, mas si piensas que si te separas 2 semanas, ella puede conocer a otro chico y enamorarse. Mira, te lo digo por experiencia, cuando mi pareja me dijo que estaba confundido, yo le hice un lavado de cerebro, que no, que pasaría, que sigamos juntos, que eramos el uno para el otro, hoy, no se si estuvo bien, porque ahora tengo la gran duda que yo le convencí, y que le obligué moralmente a estar conmigo. Me arrepiento, milo veces no haberme separado en ese momento, si volvíamos, la seguridad estaría por siempre.<br>  Adelante, fuerzas, es duro, pero va ser mejor, no se puede basar y construir una relación afectiva en la desconfianza y en la falta de seguridad.
bdebe05e816b215289cee7783a9254a1aa	duh you feel alone, i mean, it's only natural for a human being to want some kind of company. There's nothing wrong, if anything, you're normal. In the immortal words of Emily Carr "You come into the world alone and you go out of the world alone, yet it seems to me you are more alone while living than even going and coming".<br>  <br>  The lonliness never goes away, what you have to do is find a way to appreciate the times when no one but you, is present. We human beings have to reglate our feelings, having an overexcess of anything, even lonliness, only depresses you. A girlfriend would help, yes, but there would be times when she would have to go home, and you would be alone once again, then you would grown to have a dependancy on her. I'm not saying its bad to have one, but don't get a g/f to ease your problem because then you'd just be using her so that you wouldn't be alone anymore and that'd be wrong. <br>  <br>  Don't think this sounds gay or anything, but I've always found that being in tune with nature and appreciating the small things, blades of grass, an ant, these tiny insignificant things, just sitting outside and watching the sunset by yourself, or looking at the clouds, you'll realize things. <br>  <br>  Being lonely isn't a disease, it isn't weird. It's the abyss of life. Once you realize it, you won't have the empty feeling inside anymore...then again, we're all different.  I can only help to a certain point: to make you content with yourself.|`|P0P5woHvaa	Find a friend that will workout with you.|`|jP54DIfHaa	its normal! i think ur just on of those people, that  other people dont c how great u r and dont notice u until they need u then they find out how great u r|`|pm13WgJyaa	u just need a gf

E' sua madre cavoli, è ovvio che non potrei mai essere gelosa. Lo sarei se vedessi che lo tiene tutto per se ma non si intromette, al massimo posso pensare che è un pò "appiccicosa" nn so nemmeno come dirlo, m aper il resto proprio no. L'ha scritta pure a me una lettera.

eS9n3Ew5aa	I think he likes you but he might ask you out when you are in collage with him or when you both are done with school. Dont worry though|`|185842ce667dc651a066e6f1c6d2c3fdaa	Well... there isnt really a way to tell if he likes you or not because we dont know much about the situation. what grade are you in? do you know him well? does he treat you different when your with him and other people? The college excuse is valid, depending on how far away he plans on going. but there still isn't enough to tell from. But your best bet would probably be to talk to him about it if you feel that strongly about the chances of a relationship. But the fact that college is a stressful time and you meet a lot of new people and such is probably a truthful response from him.

Don't be to much of a push over of a baby, we don't like that either.<br>  And above all and all be yourself don't pretend to be something you're not, we don't like that<br>  <br>  -Good Luck!

Plus, you can schedule time with your friends between the time with your boyfriend, and try to make time for both. Finally, you can try talking with your friends explain to them the situation, and then talk to your boyfriend, and if he is understanding your can tell him the other situation your have about your friends. There are so many ways you can try to work everything out with the both you just have to try.|`|pTCLvCHxaa	tell your bf you need time with your friends. after all, time should be distribute evenly btw friends, lover and family in order to achieve a balance. tell him you love spending time with him. but you miss good old time with your friends. promise him you will miss him. and when you are not by his side, text him often to tell him how much you are thinking of him. cheers.:)

AA10167700	The guy you are friends and co-workers with:  It seems to me that he is afraid of commitment.  He probably told you that he is ready to commit to you now that you are in a relationship, because it is safe.  That is why he said he doesn't want you messing up the relationship you are in.  I have a feeling if you left the current boyfriend for him, that your friend suddenly wouldn't be interested in committing again.<br>  <br>  Your current boyfriend:  I recommend sticking it out with him.  He may have had short term relationships in the past because he hadn't found the right one.  I would wait to see what happens.  <br>  <br>  If this friend of yours is really interested in having a relationship with you, then he should be able to wait.  If your current relationship doesn't work out, then you know that there is someone else who you can love and will love you back.  I wouldn't make a move and ruin a potentially good relationship.  Be sure you do love your current boyfriend before committing to anything yourself.|`|57NUdYvkaa	Well 2.5 weeks is a little early to really think about being in Love with someone. But that other guy probably is under the spell of " I want what I can't have"  If he didn't want you then chances are he won't want you again when your single.  I say stick it out with the new guy and see what happens.  Sounds like you really care for him and he cares for you.  If your ment to be with the other guy things will work out that way on its own.|`|wur42yPgaa	kick him to the curb.|`|g0x6xxnCaa	u dont love them! u must love something else they give you!

elNIDkRiaa	I am wondering why did it get cut short? Did he cut it short? If so, this may be a sign that he is not interested in you, which may be why he isn't responding - even though he said to email, he might have just been saying that. OR, maybe he is just busy. There is no real way to know, except to stop emailing him and stop im'ing him. It might be hard to wait, but continuing to send messages repeatedly is a bad idea - this usually scares people away. Just wait, and in the mean time, do not totally focus on this one guy, go out and meet other people too.

We live in a time when it's too easy to have access to people all over the world, but that doesn't mean that your supposed  to be with them. The world is a large place, and if you could talk to all of the people in it, you'd have a REALLY hard time trying to figure out which love to choose. Maybe the two of you should agree to a break.

"quieres ser mi perra?" jajajaja eso tambien era broma.. tu puedes decir "quieres ser mi chica ?" y ella dira.. esta bien y tu diras "Bueno" y encenderas un cigarrillo y te iras en la motoneta.. jajaja eso tambien era broma. <br>  <br>  Date cuenta, si haces lo que te digo esa chica no seria tuya, seria mia o algo asi.. pq yo soy el de las palabras osea con esto te digo, tienes que decirle las cosas claras en su cara mirandola a los ojos y no pedir recetas, Be Yourself...|`|3db2b8dd140b459a0104bc94aabaa59baa	Primero entérate si tu le interesas a ella.

Well anyway, i think that was a very nice thing that you admitted that to her. I dont think that you should just exit out of her life because shes sounds like an important person to you in your life.  I think that you should continue to spend time with her because it sounds like you might have a chance to win her heart. For right now maybe just give her her own space until her rejective feelings go away (roughly a week) and she will realize that she misses you and you can put the rejection behind you both. :)|`|34e9e9fe0d4bc19d020a1064cd382799aa	well i am actual in the same position as you friend here...i mean yes she does like you, but not that well. She may have liked you in the past but you never noticed so she gave up. You probably just waited to long. I know how you feel and i am sorry...but just explain to her that you realize she said no and that you will try to except that and move on.<br>  <br>  hope everything works out.....<3|`|0XCSQsf3aa	Say "You've been a great friend, but it's just too hard for me to be around you right now." She'll understand.|`|MpvD3kIgaa	Anger is a natural reaction to what you are going through, but if she really is as important to you as you said, completely removing yourself from her would be concidered bad form. Sadly, we cannot choose who we fall in love with and it is always more difficult when a friend is involved, I suppose you just have to realize that she isnt the one for you. I dont know if you are familiar with the term "twin flame". A twin flame is someone who resembles what your soulmate is only there is one thing that doesnt complete as a soulmate would  or for some reason you two will never be together. I think that is what you are facing now. Accept the friendship and continue the search for mrs. right
ZmDfryj4aa	you go up and ask her, "hey, do you want to hang out sometime"  better to try and get rejected than not try at all|`|25acaa544aa3128b1e2e446f3853de8baa	Tell her that she tastes like sunshine dust.|`|a46be6b854cf1fb903b113b530f0029caa	letter (slip into locker, give to a friend to give to her, etc.) e-mail, myspace.|`|zkCg1iosaa	Send her a nice bouquet of flowers to school and write on the card......I was wondering if you would be my girl? XOXOX (your name here).  If she doesn't respond then you know she's not into you, if she does...well its all good.  Girls love getting flowers and having their girlfriends know they got flowers.
PHgqrpakaa	Dude. be friends, tell her you like her wait and see what she says and then if she likes you back, ask her out. Any guy could get any girl if he wants. You have not Because you ask not.
O4uiA9xlaa	deep feelings freak girls out.<br>  say the second part, and like casual, i guess. to limit the damage if she does reject you<br>  <br>  but yeah man, you just need to like man up and accept rejection if thats what happens.<br>  <br>  its better to try than to just sit there wondering, you know?|`|WSuvJRdnaa	just be lik do u want to go out wit me, rejection is part of life so u just have to learn to deal wit it
UiQRzHhVaa	It depends. Is she a nice girl with a pretty personality or is her personality as ugly as she is? Don't judge people by appearence until you get to know them. She could be extremely nice. If she is then tell her you would like to get to know her better before making a commitment. If she's not, then turn her down politely by saying shes not your type or that you're into someone else. Hope that helps. :D|`|46d69ac196ec8f77645043afced7cd8caa	oh and you think your all that?be nice and tell her your seeing someone else and if your as hot as you think you are then you are probably seeing a slew of people.lol|`|WkA8UPflaa	Well maybe you should try being nice. This is a good way not to break that girls heart. Sometimes guys need to get a wake up call. Looks aren't everything! Try to just let her down easy, instead of acting repulsed.|`|8oYS0vhvaa	first of all;<br>  you're a jerk;<br>  and a couple other things come<br>  to mind;but those don't beling here.<br>  <br>  nicely tell her no & that you<br>  don't see her that way;i'm guessing that<br>  you're single;you're not supposed to see<br>  people that way;& you know what;<br>  if you were really that good looking;you wouldn't<br>  be single now would you?|`|AA10647950	Don't lie and don't be an gerk about it... Tell her no. If she asks why tell her she isn't your type...|`|MoRMNVMXaa	Please dont be rude to her! Those girls cant help it! They have enough crap on their plates. Just tell her no, but say it with a heart.|`|9XgKP3MSaa	yeah just tell her that ur seeing somone|`|AA10716447	just tell her you go out with someone|`|HpbIL5UVaa	just say  i dont wanna hurt you but i see you more as a friend...even if youd never be friends wit her like......oh how decieving<br>  <br>  xoxox|`|e3a64e0ec7a29fbfa8505ead0fab7a52aa	Please don't be rude to her.  Just simply tell her you are not interested.  Hopefully, that will be enough to make her back off.  <br>  <br>  You don't mention how old you are.  There are many times when the fat, ugly ducklings in school  turn into swans later in life.|`|fK7iLdcvaa	Tell her sorry, but you don't like her in that way...It's really as simple as that......|`|jABTNceLaa	just say no. its as easy as that.

TUUQQ5TNaa	You should get a bf, when you feel ready to have one. Dont have one just because everyone has one. Only you will know when is the right time.<br>  Ohh and this is my opinion about guys " they are trouble... stay away from them" lol <br>  good luck :)|`|6LvaJcxNaa	If u want one get one but don't get one or do anything that u don't want to do just becuz ur friends r doing it|`|NTUHvAiUaa	Not just because your friends so say no! If you feel they are too young im presuming you think the same of yourself so just wait, dont rush into anything!|`|TIvfXlX3aa	Don't get a bf just because your friends have/had one.  You have to find the right guy first.  Don't be a follower. Do your own thing, have fun being single while you can!
AA10569146	First,trust is the foundation to any relationship...without trust,your screwed.<br>  <br>  Second,dont let your imagination run wild with these thoughts of him going to dump you. Let it play its course and see what happens|`|82644bccb70a7c26bc7e26b7794db8f2aa	Stop being paranoid or you will be the one that splits you  up.|`|0VBmjTJQaa	Its horrible when you feel this insecure. I met my first true love at 16 and i was with him for 15 years but in the real early days i felt same as you, fretted about everyone and everything, accused him of alsorts, never trusted him....and i really had no reason to act and feel like this, its only now i'm a lot older i realise it was my own insecurities. If you carry on eventually he will get fed up of this, don't spoil what you have got. It may last forever, it may not, who know's? If its meant to be then its meant to be, just try and relax, enjoy yr time together and if he really hasn't given you cause to not trust him then stop fretting! He sounds sincere from what you've said. There will always be jealous people where ever we go, sad things they are too, don't ever let them get the better of you, laugh at them, pitty them even and remember yr a unique wonderful person and this guy has chosen to be with you! Be happy and enjoy yr relationship|`|6Y6BRwDnaa	Trust what he tells you. Don't listen to other people. Quit acting jealous or you will drive him away.

i3c7J10xaa	Like OzDonna said - SAY SOMETHING- and for you losing weight, I hope your also doing it for yourself and not just her. <br>  I'm very into my training at the gym so to for a start, a high protein diet, lots of chicken breast, tuna, eggs, broccolli, anything that contains protein will help you lean up. But also make sure you drink plenty of water if you do this because to much protein can be hard on your kidneys. Also as well as doing weiht training get cardio in as well to help burn extra fat of and bring your fitness levels up. You might even want to think about taking some supplements depending on what results your looking for. Your health food stores are best for this and they give great advice on what is right for you to take.|`|AA12117677	well if she's not saying anything and you aren't saying anything no-one is saying anything<br>  say something!|`|ccBcszURaa	she is making a fool out of you.

Also confront the people who say that and just say "i don't appreciate what you are calling me, you may have seen me but you do not know me". Of course say it in your own way. Be yourself, do what you think is right.<br>  <br>  Im not popular myself but i can understand... The man above obviously doesn't care for peoples feelings.

Get to know eachother on a deeper level so that he will fell that even if you alls relationship does not work out that yall will still be friends. Just don't put pressure on him to make him fell like that he has to chose to go out with you or just be friends. He might just need to know that it would be ok for him to take that leap into the next level.|`|yrS8E3fXaa	YES! he has a big crush on you! you can really tell. awwww he seems so sweet. i say you try giving him some clues :)

He's playing mind games, and obviously doesn't know what he wants. And he has a girlfriend. Who's to say he won't do that to her eventually when he gets back with you?

DD6q5Rp0aa	It sounds like you may not like her as a girlfriend.|`|kXhAERt3aa	Ryo O is right - you gotta learn to relax.  If things are meant to happen, they will.  Understand that you are being told the girl ALREADY likes you - so you should just treat her like one of your existing friends - friends can date, happily!  I married one of my friends - we've been married for 17 years so far!  So you should try to be empathetic and sympathetic to the girl, but relax.  She is trying to get closer to you, not give you grades like a prize bull at the State Fair!  Try to watch her and when she is tense, you can lighten things up with some humor.  She was probably attracted by your smile, so try to at least smile at her.  It takes practice to seem- and eventually to even be- calm when you are not.  Fortunately, it sounds like you do get a number of girls to work your charm on, so keep working  on it - try to see ow nervous the girl is, even if she hides it well.  That can make you more relaxed because you want her to be relaxed too.|`|7I7D3OQvaa	If you don't accept yourself for who you are and how you are than don't expect the girls too either. :P|`|6fmKU9SLaa	I would say your nervous!Try ti talk to her if you like her back then ask her out.Your just nervous.If you dont like her in that way tell her and maybe she wouldnt be so rough on ya.Hope this helps.|`|ZCZqteeEaa	Well first of all it takes a lot of courage to tell a guy that you like them. Second, if you like her then you should tell her that you do. If you don't, just go up to her tomorrow and just be normal. Laugh and make jokes...because if you dont then it might get akward and then she might not talk to you as much as she used to.|`|yrztd96Waa	You're probably nervous. <br>  <br>  But if you're not yourself, then she isn't really liking you, is she?<br>  <br>  Just act natural, I guess. Don't care if they like it or not.
WD2WtX9raa	They overanalyze things. It's a pain.

16b3340f6b3002b4cd5a1b38e48064f1aa	If you're looking for "The One" then why waste time with women you don't want?<br>  <br>  I have to say, I appreciate your honest question and I'm sure you're a decent guy, but i take offense to your point of view,  I think it all goes back to the rediculous notion that single moms are "used goods" or "tarnished" or "looking for a new daddy".  I mean it's your life and if you don't want to marry someone who has children then that's your decision, but I think it's based on some pretty shallow thinking.<br>  <br>  I have to ask; if you're looking for "the one" then why would it bother you that single moms want serious relationships, ie - also looking for "the one".<br>  <br>  And for the record, not all single moms are looking for serious relationships!  Many just want to have fun, have someone that they can go out and shake away the stress, and just not be someone's Mommy for a few hours.<br>  <br>  And I have to say, I don't like your attitude, it kinda sounds like like you think any woman should be grateful to have you.  In reality, it takes a special kind of man to be worthy of being a part of the lives of a single mom and her kids.  I'm a single mom of 2 and very grateful to have found a man that is special like that.  If you're not up for the job, then do yourself and single moms a favour and stay away.|`|VyuseWb2aa	whoa, you have dated to many women... single moms wont really accept you, serious so try for single women who arent married yet|`|sZFLtCbdaa	You should exclude women with children. It gives them false hopes because you already admit that she wouldn't be the one. I say this, because it isn't fair to them. Not every guy is cut out to date a mother with child. Same with girls dating. Not every one of them is cut out to date a guy with kids.<br>  Be more selective and don't rush to date someone for the sake of just going out on a date.|`|LunOlt6baa	As a single mom I can tell you that most single moms do not date to make friends but are more oriented in the thinking that they want to settle down. So if you do not want anything serious with a woman with kids it would probably be best for you AND them to just avoid dating anyone with kids all together, it will save both of you frustration later, as many woman, even those you tell up front that you do not want anything serious, most woman think they can "change your mind".  As for the friends with benefits, it sounds great in theory , and some woman can achieve this but most get feelings and the friend with benefit thing can get complicated and ugly , not a good idea. Unless you are very explicit with the "this is sex only"..sometimes we need to be told more than once..we think we can change you remember?? :)|`|cUj1hIP2aa	Well it sounds like to me your putting up a wall that might be hindering you from finding The right one.  You said yourself you have had great company with them.  I think the prob is not you dating single mothers the problem is your tude when you go in with the idea they can't be the one bet she is right under your nose and you got the blinders on.
iGm94j3yaa	Does ur boyfriend know 'bout him? It's not considered cheating, but if ur thinkin' 'bout it then u should let ur boyfriend go. Obviously u like something 'bout this guy that's why u still talkin' to him. It's leading him on. If u really wanna stay with ur bf then u should consider stop talkin' to the other fella.|`|MgBsv2tKaa	NO if its just talking there is nothing wrong at all Hopefully you are not flirting and leading this guy on cause even though thats not considered cheating its a step away from it. Make sure this guy knows all your intrested in is friendship so it does not lead to anything else.|`|T79ToGMeaa	How old are you lol?, I'm betting a very young teen therefore it doesn't matter because none of your relationships will last lol.|`|ujU26jrRaa	Your just talking right..even if you like the other guy right now your just talking..|`|zsokOkzJaa	no cheating only if u are doign sexual thinga and talking baout sexual things to him such as "oh i wanna do you lets hook up" that would be verbaly cheating|`|VyuseWb2aa	the choice is up to you... and yeah it will be cheating on your guy... but i would suggest to stay with the boyfriend you're with
StUH7amRaa	ask him how hes doing and whats new with him. if he doesnt mention a gf then maybe its not just friendly|`|WXaIA6vMaa	It depends on what your feeling about him are. If he has struck up a conversation, just because he is your ex there isnt anything with a simple conversation. Also, if your afraid of something leading off somewhere you dont want things to go, I would just make small talk, then slowly break the conversation off. But of course, this is from my prospective.
6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Amigo deja pensar, dejala que siente tu falta, que te a?ore, no la busques más, aunque te muerdas los dedos por llamarla. Pierdete de su vida para que ella reflexione.<br>  Hazle sentir tu falta, tus atenciones, tus detalles como la rosa, en fin todo. <br>  <br>  Y dejala que ella solita si de verdad te ama, te buscará. Ya lo verás y si no lo hace es porque no te quiere o ya tendrá los ojos puestos en otro y eso amigo NO TE LO MERECES TU NI NADIE.<br>  <br>  Te deseo la mayor de las suertes y ojala la chica recapacite.<br>  <br>  SI AMAS ALGO, DEJALO LIBRE, SI VUELVE A TI ES TUYO Y SI NO VUELVE, NUNCA LO FUE.<br>  <br>  Ten fortaleza de espiritu y no la busques porque más bien la aburriras con tus constantes llamaderas por telefono y visitas. DEJALA para que piense en lo que perdio.<br>  <br>  Sigue adelante tu vales mucho, tienes buenos sentimientos y piensa que fue lo que a ella no le gustó de ti para cuando vuelvan si es que vuelven no lo vuelvas a cometer. Y si no vuelve, buscate a una que si valore todo ese amor que solo tu tienes para dar.<br>  <br>  No serás el único que le haya pasado eso. Tomalo como una experiencia más de vida y aprende de eso ok.<br>  <br>  Besitos y cuidate y sobre todo VALORATE. y no mendigues amor ok que no te lo mereces....de esa forma...sino que te amen sin necesidad de tu arrodillarte o rogar...eso no es AMOR.<br>  <br>  Y si ella te busca de nuevo, por favor deja esos celos enfermizos que ya sabes no te dejan nada bueno y destruyen el amor que te puedan tener. Y menos sino tienes motivos para celarla. OK CAMBIA AMIGUITO PARA QUE NO LA PIERDAS DE VERDAD y si aparece otra NO LO HAGAS DE NUEVO. Ya verás que ella se la está dando de dura contigo jejej y cuando recapacite volverá a ti...y ahí tienes que demostrarle que has cambiado o mejorado esos celos enfermizos que también te hacen da?o a ti. TODOS LOS CELOPATAS SUFREN Y HACEN SUFRIR...Muerdete la lengua cuando quieras pelear por celos, acuerdate de este momento y así irás modificando tus celos...<br>  <br>  SUERTE Y BESITOS Y QUE TU NOVIA RECAPACITE SI DE VERDAD TE AMA.<br>  <br>  NO LA BUSQUES YA HICISTE TODO PARA QUE VOLVIERA Y TE PERDONARA...AHORA LE TOCA A ELLA. jejje ponte duro para que sufra un poquito ella también.|`|9aea4c6da704c5e97102d52e9e39fbdeaa	Ya acepta que no te quiere...<br>  y que no van a volver juntos...<br>  <br>  así de simple, buscate otra, hay más peces en el agua no es el único..<br>  <br>  Total ya aprendiste la lección.<br>  <br>  Un saludo|`|Cx02rYIaaa	En primer lugar debes de dejar de atosigarla, ella ya sabe que estás por ella. De esa forma se sentirá mas agobiada. Deja que pase el tiempo, intenta no agobiarla, ni declararte mas. Si ella realmente te echa en falta volverá.<br>  <br>  Y aprende una cosa, nadie es poseedor de nadie, eso es vital, para que en el caso de que vuelva, la relación pueda funcionar.
