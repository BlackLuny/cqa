yWUQUjx9aa	It will make you sleepy, it will take away your nervousness.    Diazepam is incredibly safe. The only reason Dr's are so careful in prescribing it is because of the abuse potential.  You will be fine, the medicine will help you.    Good luck with the MRI|`|Yu7y6yfraa	It will Relax you; that's it.        Like Tisker said, it is not dangerous.  Doctors have to be careful because a lot of people abuse it.    I take 10 mg each day for tremors in my hands.  I also take 20 mg a day of Paxil.  No problem.    Try not to worry too much.  Your doctors obviously want to help make you comfortable.  Just let them do all of the worrying.    Valium is just a FDA approved version of the natural herb, Valerian root.

6ri6UGsoaa	Well, sweetie, I understand. I really do. I have a nervous 'shiver' I do sometimes...fortunately, it looks like a cold chill, so I have it rather easier then you do. I will say this, probably going to a specialist doctor and/or counselor would help you. Nervous Tics happen because you (obviously) anxious. You may find that if you can uncover the root cause of this condition in yourself, you may be able to overcome it. I also want to tell you that I understand why you are lying to your friends: but think about this, if they are true friends, you should be able to tell them about this and have their support. That's what you need right now, after all! Good luck and hugs!
AA12218624	you can eat protein or carbs before you work out but make sure whatever you do eat, you wait at least 45 minutes before you work out. this will give your body enough time to not only start digesting but to also give your body the nutrients so you have that extra energy to actually work out. after you work out, it is best to eat some sort of carb. but make sure you eat carbs made from whole grains. whole grain bread, pasta, or even fruits and vegetables. those will help restore your glycogen (energy resources) and make you feel less sore after working out.|`|gCvMS2KEaa	good question i wanna know too|`|db7c12ce76ff7d75c1b0331c96a016afaa	after.    I find that eating before exercise (right before) will make you puke. Something to do with re-directing blood to the muscles and away from your stomach so the stuff just sits there undigested for too long.    I know even WATER will make me barf if I drink too much before/during exercise.    eat after you cool down. And drink sparingly during.|`|Ss0hpUDRaa	u shouldnt eat too muc hbefore becasuse u might get cramps but u could drink like a quick smoothie or sumthing. u can eat afterwards though|`|EyRnTHaUaa	After, hands down! Your heart rate is up, your metabolism is up. You'll digest easier and more quickly. By all means don't go have a cheeseburger but something light and healthy with lots of nutrients and protein. Most importantly make sure you keep extra hydrated after each workout.     PS before will not only make you puke but your body will be having to split between digesting and your work out. Not to time effective. If you are strictly doing strength training having a protein shake, bar or piece of fruit is not only fine but may prove beneficial!|`|4pofGorlaa	You need to eat a little something before working out to keep blood sugar levels ok. However, you only want it to be a little bit, as you don't want your stomach using up too much blood. You want to keep the oxygenated blood for your muscles, which will be working hard. You simply cannot exercise intensely on a full stomach.    Post workout, you will need food to recover. The more intense you workout, and the longer, you will burn more calories and a good amount of them will be from muscle glycogen storages. These storages will need to be replenished, so you don't feel like crap and have energy to workout again the next day.    These storages are carb based, so you will need to eat carbs after working out for few hours. Combined with 10-15% protein to ensure protein synthesis (muscle growth).|`|Hi9cg4rJaa	definatly before!|`|5hOyGhspaa	before, and eat stuff like pastas and breads.|`|i6nCGSGTaa	Before:  -Anything really.  Protein is very good, carbohydrates will give you the energy for the workout, but really anything.  Stay away from your sugars, because that will give you an initial boost, but then you could feel a slight crash midway through.    After:  -If you are a weight lifter, obviously you will want your protein.  Lean meats: turkey, fish, chicken (not fried or broiled).  Anything with substantial amounts of protein in it, to build back those torn muscles.  Milk is always good.  I make a sandwich with mounds of turkey and ham.  NO MAYO|`|eUFW55X8aa	well, if you are going to do cardio exercise then you don't need to eat before because you will run out of breath very fast,,but it is always a good idea to eat a fruit like banana's 90 mins before cardio. for cardio exercise you only need water to drink coz you will be sweating. however, if you are going to do weight training then you must have a fruit right before you start your workout coz you will need glucose in your system to maintain your muscles to workout. so eating couple of banana's before weight training is a great help as they provide enough energy to workout for 90mins. good luck and i hope i helped.
k7lsDHB1aa	maybe because of our body makes  sperm very fast and that sperm is stored in our body and when u have too much it will be easy to come out especially when you sleep and have a dream about sex.if u have this problem try not to wear underwear just pajama while you sleep and don't cover your underwear area with too many layer of blanket.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	In your dreams!|`|LGkb4xibaa	sex starts in the brain.

Imagination is possible in dreams and daydreams as my friend does: he meets a girl and tells her what all he would do for her if she is willing and giving in. Both of them get satisfaction, but he describes picturesque which I cannot, it is an art! His girlfriend says, it seems, it is sensuous than real physical encounter when they get it.
fCrR8T3Zaa	Sounds like a migraine headache.  2 extra strength Excedrin's, a bandanna tied snugly around your head front to back, (indian style) and sit up in a darkened room until the aspirin kick in.    Ibuprofen is good for muscle pain, but for headaches, nothing works like Excedrin's.    This is how I have dealt with the migraines I've had.  Good luck.|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	If you have a migraine headache it could be your diet.

If you still have it in the morning, I would go to the ER or to a doctors office. I had a bad migraine that lasted almost a week. I went to the doctor, but he just sent me with doctors orders to the ER. He couldn't treat it in his office. Man, were those drugs good. It stopped the pain within a few hours. The doctor can prescribe better stuff than the OTC meds.

WSFpZwKzaa	Good gosh, what a bunch of reactionaries!!     If you drink gasoline, you'll gain incredible strength within a matter of mere MOMENTS.  You'll feel so amazing that you will think you can conquer the world--because you CAN!!  Your muscles will grow with the quickness of a thousand galloping stallions made of sheer power.  Your hair will become thick and wavy and you will suddenly gain a cleft in your chin so deep that masters of Zen buddhism will ponder whether it actually has a bottom!!    You will gain the ability to move automobiles and to hear babies crying from as many as 12 (twelve) miles away!!  You will also be approved for any number of credit cards from the merchandiser of your choice.  You will never have to stand in line anywhere again, either.  People will make way when your arrival is heralded by a dozen winged seraphs plucking harp strings and singing songs written specifically FOR YOU by JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    That's right...all of this by simply drinking GASOLINE.  The government does not want this secret known, however.  Think of what the world would be like if ALL people drank gasoline and became so completely incredible as a result!!  Goodness ME!!    Incidentally, I would recommend mixing the gasoline with milk before drinking.  This will not only enhance the flavor, it will protect your delicate esophageal lining and your stomach and intestines.  (Not that you will necessarily NEED this protection after drinking, due to the fact that you will basically become a super hero at that point.)|`|lbfYYmMRaa	GET TO THE ER RIGHT NOW.

So make sure you have asked her to show you what she wants you to see before you smoke her. I have found that sally likes a jet flame through a water pipe. I believe it is because the active compound is oil based and the jet lighter burns more before it pulls through. This method produced wonderful experiences with just one pipe, using sal straight from the plant. (dried of course)|`|aVxUT1cYaa	Make sure you hold it in for a LOOOONG time. Like 30 seconds. Salvia, unlike weed, needs quite a bit of time to fully absorb into your lungs.|`|aLMSN18xaa	All i can tell you is that the stronger the salvia the crazier the trip is. I smoked that a couple of times but the first time i felt lost, and it makes you sweat like crazy in a matter of seconds. I don't recommend you keep using just try it a couple of times and quit, and i don't doubt that someone could go crazy on this **** from prolonged use.
AA12218624	i have heard that apple juice is a good thing to drink if you are constipated and it can serve as a natural laxative. miralax is also supposed to be a good powder that you can take everyday to help you go to the bathroom as well. i guess it depends what your goal is.    i was told this by a few doctors to take when i had...problems and nothing else would work...including eating more fiber.|`|i6nCGSGTaa	No.  A natural laxative is anything that contains high amounts of dietary fiber.  This can be found underneath the carbohydrate tab on the the nutritional labels of all foods.  Foods high in fiber, are certain vegetables, beans, some cereals (bran), and certain fruits (apples).  The biggest one is broccoli, you eat some of this combined with other high-fiber foods, you will set!
nb8X0u4Haa	You just sound really sensitive, and emotional. Which means you're effected by the things around you to a greater extent than most people. However, if you continue to cry everyday, it could mean that you have a hormone imbalance and you should go to the doctors to tell her/him how you feel.|`|5cSD8mcZaa	First of all, how old are you? Early teen years can be the most stressful years of anyone's life. These are the years when everything you think or do becomes a question mark. "Am I normal?"    If someone close to you has died, moved away, betrayed your trust or otherwise disappointed you, then you are not alone.     Intense feelings, like the remembrance of breaking up with someone, can hurt so badly that the only way to express how you feel is to let go of the tears. When we "feel" what someone else has been through, we sometimes cry for them, feeling their pain as if it was your own.|`|XeQNqE0eaa	ughh so do i,  crying at old shows,  crying at er shows,  i cry if my brothers even  crack a mean joke at me.  ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  i hate it.  but i also heared that crying is actually  good,it releases some kind of chemical or somthing  in your body.  haha goodluck|`|iJK4FAOdaa	i think it is normal and if some people barly cry i think that means the dont get moved easly (i cry alot myself too)|`|au9MvNQDaa	ur just emotional - welcome to my world!  try looking up a lot instead of down  when you look down you become more in touch with your feelings  if you look up it prevents you from connecting with your feelings  my counselor taught me that :)|`|K5IOSGXAaa	It's normal if you are reading/watching something sad every day !!

OUNu4golaa	hey girl! don't stress over it  everyone's body changes differently.  im 16 years old and got mine when i was 13. you'll get it eventually...don't worry about it. plus i think only one of my friends told me when she first got hers [now we talk about them all the time] because honestly for most girls its uncomfortable and they feel awkward talking about it...so don't feel left out or something if someone doesnt tell you. but just remember you are a very unique individual and when your body is ready to get its period, it will. just as a hint i would carry around a pad with you [if you have one] in your backpack or purse just in case so you dont get caught by surprise at school.  but when you do get it...CONGRATULATIONS! Welcome to womenhood!!!!!|`|rv5MWaBcaa	well my sister got her period at 16..  so i guess that you will have to be very patient.|`|EBKPbkj7aa	god, trust me girl.  you do not want your period.  it's such a pain.|`|yJlbJOlNaa	make her a period cake.

Good luck.|`|S1jddreQaa	I really think you should let her mom take care of her pads and crap like that.    I know how you feel. I got my period when I was 14 years old. I had it last of all my friends. Trust me, you should NOT feel left out. Getting your period changes almost nothing! All it does is create something else to stress about. When will you get it? Well I have no clue, and you don't either. There is NO way to tell when you will get it. I had all the signs of getting my period when I was 12 years old, but I didn't get it until I was 14. Since you are almost 13, I think you'll probably get it soon. The average age girls get theirs is 12-14 years old.|`|BLQsD0w5aa	Your period will probably start very soon if all of your close friends are getting theirs. When certain girls are really close to one another, and hang around each other often, their menstrual cycles become the same. (I work with all girls, and our periods always happen on the same week of each month..it's weird!) So, I'd say yours will begin soon enough. Be ready! Make sure your mom buys plenty of pads for you.|`|oluzjSgjaa	if your friend hasnt got any pads she can use folded up toilet paper for now.   but buying pads is no big deal really. its all part of life and growing up.    The menstrual cycle begins during puberty, usually about two years after breast budding, starting with first ovulation (which is pretty undetectable) and then showing itself with the first period, called menarche. Most young women now begin to menstruate between the ages of 9 and 16. If a young woman is seriously underweight, malnourished, excessively dieting, overexercising or has an eating disorder, that may delay menstruation because a certain amount of body fat is needed for menses to occur. For the big skinny on periods and menstruation, see On the Rag.    Vulval changes: Like with the penis and testicles for boys, the vulva grows larger and will start to look more pronounced than it did in childhood. The color of parts of the vulva often changes or becomes darker, and our inner labia become more obvious, both due to growth and because the other genital changes alter the way the mons sits atop the vulva.    Body size and shape changes: Through the course of puberty, the body will both grow taller and change shape. Generally, around menarche, young women will have done much of their peak growth in terms of height and bone mass (while for young men, height and bone mass growth tends to be what's finished last).    As body shape and size develops, it's typical to look a little weird, or feel like you're wearing someone else's skin for a while. The extremities, arms and legs, feet and hands, often grow faster than the rest of the body, for instance. As your hips are widening and you're building up body fat (which you need to menstruate and fully mature), sometimes you may find you look or feel pretty awkward, and that body fat decides to live in weird-looking places for a while. By the time you're through with your teens, it'll all even out.|`|W3bcdCymaa	I got mine when I was 12 but I knew a couple of girls who didn't get it till they were 15-16. You should just be happy you don't have it yet! Trust me! Now with that girl that didn't tell you she was prolly just shy about it and confidied in her because she had hers too and she could relate to her. Don't take it personal, when you get yours you are gunna feel like "what was the big deal" So just relax and take it one day at a time and enjoy your child hood b4 you become a women.|`|J5bmlm9Yaa	soon hopefully, i was in this same situation not too long ago.

Herpes simplex II is genital herpes, it does recur in out breaks and is more severe strain of the herpes virus.

Anyways, wrap it up with bandages or go see a doctor for it. If you can't feel it,then it probably IS broken. If u don't think u can handle it anymore and u can't wait for an appointment, u just go to the ER, and u'll be fine. Ice it for a couple minutes at a time, 5 times, for 3 days. It should get better when u let the heat on it so that the blood flow will increase after icing it the 1st time. Do this several times, each time after you ice it. Each time u ice it, ice it for 20 minutes. Follow those steps if u don't wanna go to the doctor's or ER. Hope your toe gets better! :)|`|Co9I2OMSaa	go to a doctor, they will see if it really is broken, if it is the only thing they can do is wrap it up so you don't move it so it can heal, other than that there really is nothing to be done about it|`|oyvRHQmaaa	see the doctor....get an xray.....|`|e3LzkOvGaa	if you cant move or feel your toe then its broken|`|Jwnk4LPgaa	I don't really think there is anything you can do but wrap it up.

Now you're thinking to yourself "well it was an easy paragraph to write."  Yeah, because you aren't stupid.  Stupid people can't write cohesive paragraphs.  There isn't anything wrong with your brain.  Believe it because it's true.  You don't have brain damage.  You don't have anything.  You're just socially anxious.  You have the physiological ability to function, but it just isn't happening because of your anxiety.  I am anxious too, and it sucks.    I'd suggest finding a therapist who you like.

There's a simple answer to your social anxiety, always look people in the eye, no matter how much you don't want to. But the key is to not blatantly stare at them, blink once every couple seconds so they don't think you're trying to hypnotize them. (also nod, smile, and so forth) A conversation is done when the person stops talking, haha. Or if they turn their attention to something else. I wish you were still in school so you could try this, but just sit down next to someone you've talked to before, or anyone you think is cool for that matter.

Don't let it disable you and keep you house-bound; your life can't go forward that way.  With the help of someone who cares about you, go to a doctor about this; maybe tell the appointment person you need time for counselling so the doctor will take time with you.  One of the biggest symptoms people with depression have is SHAME.  It's a symptom, not necessarily a reality.  And just a comment, I had trouble with what I thought were inane questions, too, like "How are you?" and the "non-answers" until I decided to see these as greetings, rather than real questions and answers. Answer back with the usual answer and tell yourself what the 2 of you are really doing is just saying, "Hi".|`|e50e2aed37e3608ec2d0b15df914d19daa	Get connected with God Almighty with repentance and faith, and you will have healthy self-confidence to live a normal and delightful life.

Just come to Jesus with genuine repentance and faith and you will be saved for eternity.  Heaven is wonderful beyond description and forever without end.

xNkmK0SHaa	I had my first bout of the triad (vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss) in the early 70's.  It was diagnosed (by GP) as "viral infection". Prescribed Antivert (which did nothing).  The symptoms left in about six weeks and I gave it no more thought.  In or about 80 or 81, I noticed intermittent tinnitis.  No big deal.  Long story short:  in 84 or  85, I was working with a really astute doc in an emergency department.  She and I discovered, simutaneously, that I had been reading lips without knowing it. I was about 50 years old at the tme. I immediately (that day) saw an ENT doc and had subsequent testing for everything from allergies to brain disorder. At that time, I had 40% loss in one ear and 60% in the other. It scared me enough that I took sign language classes for  a couple years.    Well, I had those tubes put in my ears and the hearing improved significantly.  It was at that time that I was given the diagnosis of  Menier's.  The tinnitus came and went,  but the vertigo never returned until 1993. At that time I was a new widow and having other symtoms that made my phyician consider that I might be having"mini strokes".  I was 58 at the time.  About 400 tests later, it was decided I had a "virus' and stress reaction (no **** - widowhood sucks). The vertigo left, but the tinnitis returned and has never totally left.    In 1999 I realized I could hear very little .  I was tested, etc. and recieved a hearing aid for each ear.  Last year I had to get new ones as the initial ones just weren't doing the job.    I continue to have tinnitis intermittently.  I have grown so accustomed, I almost never notice it.    I function very well for an old lady (71.5 years).    Now, aren't you sorry you asked ???|`|OqcTPhiSaa	Hi :)    I answered your other question, but I don't know anything at all about mienere's disease :(    It seems to me that whenever a person is facing the possibility of an extreme change due to health reasons there are several steps involved. The first one being a serious gathering information (or wrapping your brain around what's happening).    If I were in your shoes I'd look for a local association that deals with hearing loss, and I'd try to read everything I can on the diagnosis. It's going to take some serious time to really begin to understand what you're up against, I think.    Also, I'm thinking you're going to have to go through a time of terrible stress as you accept and adjust to this thing that's happening. That's not going to feel very good, but it is probably normal.    I really think you're going to raise your daughter just fine. I'm positive other people have done a smashing job raising kids even without being able to hear. You're just going to have to learn what works for you, as well as what doesn't work.    I think it'd be a great idea if you could network with other moms who have lost their hearing too. It's really important to not be alone when you're having to go through something like this, and it would be a great way to get tips and advice as well.    I'm really sorry this is happening to you. I know it's a lot to deal with, but I hope you'll make the most of it. Take extra good care of yourself. That's the best thing you can do :) Everyone in your life will be happy if you're happy!    Big hugs!!    E|`|fEkKuGlEaa	My former roommate had Meneire's disease and while they did tell her she faced possible hearing loss later in life her main problems were vertigo and all that went with it.     She had a diet as free of salt as possible, and caffeine free as well. Any time she overdosed on salt (like Italian food) she paid for it with a bout of vertigo and had to take Valium until it was over. Perhaps a change in diet would at least tell you something. If the diet change causes the vertigo to cease, you might be on to something. If the diet change doesn't affect you, it's time to look further.     Best wishes to you in getting a diagnosis.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Mienere's disease doesn't cause hearing loss. To much salt in the diet causes water in the inner ear and it's the cause of imbalance. Both my son, age fifty and my daughter, a surgical nurse at forty eight have Mienere's and have coped with ot by avoiding salt in their diet and use a substitute.      Your climbing the wrong tree.

k7Pd7Glqaa	I have read that alot of different types of birth control will cause you to gain weight.  Tips for you:   eat smaller portions of food, even if you have to eat 5 or 6 times a day.

Exercise, and stick with the smaller portions.|`|PrS7So5Yaa	Some say birth control makes you gain, but I've been on depo provera for 5 years and I've managed to lose 110 lbs... so I can definitely say No, it doesn't make you gain weight.

Calculate your BMR at www.caloriesperhour.com and make sure you eat at least that many calories. If you exercise your surplus should be higher than your BMR. So if your BMR is 1300 and you burn 300 in exercise you need to eat 1600.|`|TwWuCGUEaa	yes birth contol makes you gain weight

Or will you file it away under Trivia so you will know the answer in case somebody ever asks you?|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Good heavens. That just gave me all SORTS of interesting and unusual visions...     I mean unless you got a real low-hanging pair, how on earth could you weigh them on a mini-scale w.o your penis adding to it?
NwnzUPc4aa	Sounds like you won't be baton twirling you hockey stick anymore.  Mission accomplished.    You just have to wait it out.  Your muscles become sore when your muscles switch from aerobic (with oxygen) to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism.  The byproduct of using this other energy form is called lactic acid.  When this builds up in the muscles, it causes pain.  The best way to get it out is to flush it out with lots of fluids (water, water, water).  Drink up!    Good luck.  :)|`|4htyTXJSaa	the pain will go away, its mostly because you never worked those muscles before, or its been  a long time since you did  a exercise like that
TeLMouDCaa	They're taking x-rays--if it's a plastic piece about 6 inches long, holding a rectangle object--they're taking "periapicals"--usually of one or two teeth to see the root of the tooth. If it's a cardboard tab you bite on, they're taking "bite-wing" x-rays--shows decay in between your upper and lower teeth in one shot.  Some people gag, some don't--try raising your legs a little off the chair--takes your mind off of it.|`|j9mN8Sz5aa	That's an x-ray of your teeth so they can see what's happeing with your teeth under your gums! :)|`|AA10648678	When that stick like their whole hand in your mouth for x-rays?|`|GBFhC35aaa	If they are made of this gooey stuff and are mouth-shaped, those are for making retainers specifically for your mouth.|`|DdxNkQZZaa	Its some plastic rubbery thingy, I think.
gkqmrIAGaa	Getting braces is much different now then it used to be. You can even choose a color of braces that you want. Lots of kids have them and it makes them stand out in a good way. You are not going to look ugly at all. You have no need to be nervous a good dentist knows what he's doing and will not cause you any pain. Remember these braces are for your future and a beautiful smile for the rest of your life. Try to remember that everyday. You are lucky your parents are doing this for you as it is very expensive and some parents don't care or can't afford them so they grow up with teeth that don't look nice llike yours are going to. Good Luck!|`|Op37pHd3aa	if you dont like the idea of getting metal braces suggest invisalign to your orthodonist. Its around the same prices as metal braces and no one can notice if you have them on AND you can take them out and put it back in.|`|mwbas9QKaa	Braces are really normal now and no one looks ugly in them. Your lucky you can get braces and have nice teeth because some people can't afford that. My braces don't look bad at all, and neither do my friends.|`|ml5ozsTvaa	It hurts at first...not really hurt just a bit sore then u won't even know between having braces and without braces. About the ugly thing...I doubt you'll ugly (it's in you mouth)..when i had mine, my friends called me brace-face(as a joke really) and my brother called me train tracks, but i never cared...now i have perfect teeth and people comment about it and...you'll be thankful and pretty!!!|`|yqy5xfSbaa	don't worry at all. They don't hurt that much really, the inside of your mouth kinda gets swollen and ur teeth hurt a little the day after, but it doesn't hurt as bad as the spacers you get before they put the braces on. And almost over half of teenagers have braces, no one will think you're ugly, a lot of people at my school have braces. don't worry.
oluzjSgjaa	basically it depends if she is ovulating.  does her vaginal discharge change its consistency over the weeks?  if you ejaculate inside her , there is always going to be some risk.   but if she is not producing an egg, then it cannot be fertilized.   but you need to know for sure, before you take that chance|`|9f072b8d4c4bdd8c8692346722929479aa	if your not ready dont do it.. kids are a big responseability more then you can imagine.. people think its like having a dog but its nothing like it.. dont do it your too young to ruin your life.. im 21 and no where enar ready for a kid. i wanna travel and go out without dragging a baby with me.. dont do it your too young enjoy your life.|`|2xlwJaITaa	Yes, and you know about pre-ejaculation right?|`|AA10327722	Wear a condom if you don't want a kid.  The quick draw method doesn't work.  She can get pregnant off your pre-*** too.  If she hasn't had a period in 8 months and was pregnant, you would know cuz she would be getting fat.|`|xXhXY1bdaa	uh 18 and 26?    buut uh you might wanna tell her to get a pregnancy test or go to the doctors to talk about her 8 months of not having a period..    and she could be tricking you into having a kid.|`|8JkMsnAoaa	Yes.  You get your period AFTER you ovulate. So she is a time bomb.|`|P8vt2aLhaa	Yes she can still get pregnant You need to take control of the situation and use a condom if you are not ready for kids yet. If you Truly are not ready for kids you should not have them and if she loves you that much she should respect that!

I don't always give them cold medicine unless they really need it.|`|zSo7fvGKaa	chicken soup!  it actually helpss  and otherss :)  just see the site  hope you get better by the wayy!|`|4TKyMlZcaa	Well, "Cold" is pretty vague.  Runny nose? Sore throat? Coughs? Sneezes?  I dunno what you have, exactly, but there's something my dad does that helps him.    This is what you do.  Get a small bowl of water (tap water's fine), and make it salt water (assuming you have some salt in your kitchen).    Now, this might sound weird, but helpful.  inhale that water with your nose. gently.   We don't want you to like choke and cough like crazy for 5 minutes.  then just blow it out on the sink.    Next, for the throat, gargle. Just put some of that salt water (a new dish. you dont want something in your mouth that was once in your nose)  And simply gargle.  It does help.     I dunno any tribal or amazonian or chinese herb stuff.  This is all I know, but I hope it helped.    Hope you get well!
xEoR8igxaa	Here is a link to a Guide about asthma that links to the Web's best sites on the condition. Check it out, it should be a big help:  http://www.findingdulcinea.com/guides.to...|`|aCdya2qkaa	Hi, you have asked 3 question, I will do my best in giving 3 answers.      what is it?    Asthma is a very common chronic disease involving the respiratory system in which the airways constrict, become inflamed, and are lined with excessive amounts of mucus, often in response to one or more triggers.    How does it effect you?    Environmental tobacco smoke, especially maternal cigarette smoking, is associated with high risk of asthma prevalence and asthma morbidity, wheeze, and respiratory infections.Poor air quality, from traffic pollution or high ozone levels, has been repeatedly associated with increased asthma morbidity and has a suggested association with asthma development that needs further research.     If you have it?    No, Thank God. My cousin has it and my Grand ma, they require Inhaler, some people lunge get stronger for some people they get worse.Using the inhaler regular, fitness play a big role in life, helps the respiration system, taking sports activites and keep away from a smoker home.|`|gmxz8kxfaa	Hello. I was born with asthma and had it all my life.   Its funny how it works sometimes actually though it   reacts different to different people. For example some people can have asthma and not have it affect them more then twice in there life others like me however it can affect all the time. It tends to act up in more colder weather for most people. It compresses the lungs and causes that person to start wheezing and ..can kill someone not so often but very possible . There's no cure for asthma there is only  treatment... abuteral inhalers flovent inhalers adv-air and at home respirators.
Yn6pM2Xyaa	Lorazepam was definitely somehting that was prescribed in the office for patients who were extrememly nervous.  They usually took it about 1/2 an hour before the procedure.  It was used to make them less anxious about the dental work to be done and was from my experience very helpful to the patients.  As an assistant and receptionist I heard who crazy scared people were before procedures and even if their fear was not rational or realistic to the work they were about to have done it was real to them and so if the lorazepam helped then all the better.  Best of luck with your surgery tomorrow, I'm sure everything will go just fine.  Take it one step at a time and you'll get through it.  It really isnt nearly as scary or painful as friends will have you believe, people tend to blow things way out of proportion when they tell stories!
2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	Moisturizer has alcohol in it so it will cause burning if you put it on an area that's been shaved.  Dryness will also be a problem as well.  By now it has probably diminished, but for future, don't put moisturizer on newly shaved skin.  And drink lots of fluids.|`|b9DhpqhUaa	You definitely have razor burn but its no big deal. You probably need a better razor, and next time use more shaving cream. Soap works but sometimes its not as thick and your legs wont react as well as with cream. I suggest you use some hydrocortozine cream until you get some stubble back, lotions and moisturizers will cause pain....good luck
zddIYf9vaa	its nothing serious, it will get better with bit of rest
3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	Go to Walmart, Target, or your nearest drug store and get yourself Secret Clinical Strength. It's a prescription strength anti persperant that is available over the counter. If that does not take away your excessive sweating, then nothing over the counter will. If you still can't get your sweating under control, see a doctor, there are things they can prescribe you to help you keep the odor and wetness under control.|`|kqMDKMhNaa	If you haven't tried using the clinical strength over the counter antiperspirants (not deodorants...antiperspirants), then the next step is to see your doctor and get something prescription.  If that doesn't work, you can get botox injections in your pits that will stop underarm sweating.
2U8F93g1aa	It depends on a few things really...  1.  How much fat do you have on your body?  THC gets stored in your metabolites so the more fat you have, the longer it will remain.  2.  How much have you smoked recently?  If you haven't been smoking much besides just the one Sunday you mentioned, you might be ok... maybe.  3.  How fast is your metabolism?  A fast metabolism will clean your system of THC very efficiently.  Personally, I'm 6'1" 140 lbs with an insane metabolism.  Ive been tested a matter of 1 week after HEAVILY smoking for months straight and I tested negative :)  4.  How much water do you drink?  If you drink lots of water, that will help get it out of your system faster.  Other things that help include niacin(which is in lots of energy drinks and can be purchased in pill form OTC), and there's even drinks that head shops sell that will get it out of your system very fast.  Be careful though, if they suspect something is up, they can test for whatever they use in those drinks.  Also, if you drink too much water, it can really dilute your pee and that can make them suspicious.  5.  How much do you work out?  If you regularly work out, you can get it out of your system relatively fast.    If you fall under the average category in all of these questions, expect it to take about 3 weeks.  To be safe, most people should assume it will take a month.|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !    If you're wondering how long marijuana stays in your system after smoking, it depends on how often you smoke. Light users -- those who smoke a joint once in a while -- will have a negative drug screen after a marijuana-free week. Heavy users -- sometimes called "stoners" -- may continue testing positive for a month after their last bong hit.|`|KrHVvwKiaa	28 days,  The dr would have to test for drugs, which they dont do regularly.  Besides, telling your dr wont get you in trouble--he cant tell others about it.  Bottom line is to be truthful with your dr, its the only way they can help you|`|2385b0f95f7a8506cf9464941118514eaa	Technically, they could tell if they did certain tests on you. To see if you had any drugs, they would need to do blood tests. Cardiologists usually take EKGs and look at your heart with special machines. If they wanted to check certain levels (ie. cholesterol, blood cells, triglycerides, etc), they would need to do blood work (which is drawing less than a pint and sent to a lab for testing) at least a week in advance to your appointment.     So, if you haven't done any blood work done you're probably fine.     As far as how long MJ stays in your body, that depdends on many factors that differes for everyone. Metabolism plays a huge role, including how much water you drink, and a few other factors. You might be clear.|`|tFVyfvS3aa	UP TO 30 DAYS.. WELL IF THEY WERE TESTING FOR ILLEGAL DRUGS I WOULD WORRY BUT YOUR DOC JUST CANT TEST YOU WITH OUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE..WITH OUT A COURT ORDER MANDATING TESTS YOU WOULD HAVE TO GIVE PERMISSION|`|yeSeoIbjaa	The active compound present in cannabis is THC, it is oil based and fat soluble, therefore traces remain present for up to 30 days. Most other psychoactive compounds are nitrogen based and can be out of your system in 2 - 3 days.|`|2MkLB52Paa	About three weeks but even then there will still be traces of the substance if its you, get of it before you do your head in. It will put you on a fast train to no where.|`|NhF9sM5jaa	it can take up to a month for the traces to leave your system depending on how much/how often you smoke it    but if that is not what your doctor is testing then don't worry    i had blood and urine taken at the doctors with weed in my system and they didnt say anything
3S0WRhWCaa	Using words like "starve" and "binge" indicates an unhealthy attitude toward food.|`|TwWuCGUEaa	what ur doing just make u gain weight|`|hGQlPTd2aa	starving yourself and binging only makes you gain weight. if you want to stay thin, i suggest eating healthy and exercising regularly|`|mvos4z0Daa	I'm not going to come on hear and say "ANOREXIA" because I would need to know you for that. However, be careful spitting out those words. Starving and binging are unhealthy and will slow down your metabolism, can lead to malnutrition, and serious long term physical and mental effects (bone, muscle, and tissue problems, increased risk of psychosis and related mental illnesses, and heart problems). Also, having nothing in the stomach for that long can cause ulcers from constant acid buildup in the stomach and none of it being used. Talk with your doctor about this, this is surely an unhealthy way to manage your weight and diet. Only a psychiatrist who has met you and understands your whole situation can truly say if it's an "addiction" or not.
UZxeBrxQaa	Are you concerned about your girlfriend's testicles?    Epidermis is an inflammation, and an infection caused by bacteria may not be the cause.  From experience I know it can take awhile to clear up, say seven to ten days.    Nasty problem.  I'd avoid sex, or use a condom, just to be safe.  Women have this "thing" about guys infecting them with disease.  They have no sense of humour about it.
j44s2gqAaa	Are you gripping it in a different way?

GSUvlHIbaa	I had shingles a few years ago and the rash appeared first and then I started feeling sensetivity all around the rash. It was painful!!!!!|`|31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	they might come either one first or both together.  It is a worrisome thing.|`|2b076701991fe0ec4cefa9fc66914174aa	Early shingles symptoms can include:    Headache   Light sensitivity   Flu-like symptoms without fever     Itching, tingling, or extreme pain where the rash is developing may come next, and the pain can be moderate to severe.    So the rsh will develope first, then the pain.

AA10625089	When you wear your backpack do you use only one strap slung across one shoulder (could be the reason why your neck hurts) or do you actually wear both straps? Also, when you're wearing your back pack do you stand up straight and tall or do you tend to round your shoulders put your head down? Could be why your neck hurts. My neck and shoulders hurt all the due to the heavy lifting and my height (or lack thereof).
KToEYmwWaa	I used to take prozac and I always drank (not excessively).  what will happen is that the Prozac makes the alcohol hit you really fast and then it cancels out the effect of the medication for the next day.  If you don't mind being all anxious the next day have a few drinks but no more than that because you will get really drunk really fast.|`|CZ1nO9C9aa	When I drank while on Prozac I had no tolerance and got smashed after less than 10 shots.  It killed the effects of Prozac also, so I was basically paying for lower alcohol tolerance, not an antidepressant.    There've been numerous studies that show that Prozac (and just about every other SSRI) doesn't work if you drink alcohol with any frequency while on it... unless you have like 2 drinks max.    As for safety, I'm not really sure.|`|2VsmOU7zaa	Yes it will affect you. It doesn't matter how long ago you took it, it's still in your system. You are not supposed to drink while on anti depressants because your liver wont process the alcohol like it should. While your on the meds, your liver has to open a little bit (so to speak) in order to filter the prozac like it should. Therefore if you drink, the alcohol will not get filtered properly and you could die of alcohol poisoning. That's the reason that you're not supposed to drink alcohol on anti depressants. That's why people who take anti depressants feel very drunk on one or two drinks.|`|EyRnTHaUaa	Im assuming that you have your mind set on drinking and just want to know how bad it might be...    Interactions between your selected drugs - Prozac (fluoxetine) and alcohol (ethanol) (Moderate Drug-Drug)  GENERALLY AVOID: Alcohol may potentiate some of the pharmacologic effects of CNS-active agents. Use in combination may result in additive central nervous system depression and impairment of judgment, thinking, and psychomotor skills.    Im female, 21 5'5" 115lbs. When I was on prozac and drank it was terrible. I had never had a hangover before this and hand one each time regardless of how much I drank. It also completely impaired the prozac which caused a severe panic attack which landed me in the ER at one point while I drank. So note that you may experience more anxiety the next day.     In the beginning it made drinking more fun b/c the prozac intensified the effects of the alcohol so drink less than you normally would. For me 2 drinks was the equivalent of 6. I have heard for other ppl the exact opposite where they don't feel the alcohol at all so be aware of that too so you don't end up with alcohol poisoning.     Also if you are just starting this med it takes around 2 weeks to build up in your system!!!
Ir51Eb0Kaa	Your weight could affect your period. Both under and overweight. Stress and different changes in your life could also affect it. Some girls are irregular during the early years in their cycle and then later on they become more regular. Good luck ?|`|ZiHcxJv7aa	I`s pretty common. I got my first period when i was 15,and for good few years it was irregular, like i would usually get it every other month or so.It should be normal,because you`re young, and your body is still maturing and getting "womanly" . But, you should go see the doctor, just in case, cuz women are all about hormones, so if your hormones are messed up, then you skin breaks out, hear thins, nails...and dont even get started on mood swings and nerves ;)|`|kdTyaBmeaa	right there with you. except mine would last like two months|`|7xNlABgSaa	You don't have to have your period, so it doesn't matter. I was the same way in high school and was forced to get on B.C. then removed myself when I gained two extra months and decided there is no proof that no periods are the cause of endometriosis. I only had 4 periods a year in high school before the pills. Don't worry about it. It could be growing spurts, anger, sadness, fear, anxiety, or any fluctuation in body fat.

WupyR6UEaa	As far as I know, there is no interaction between Cymbalta and Ortho Cyclen.  If she is that concerned, do you have an all night pharmacy where you live.

You are correct that if the Dr. knew she was on birth control, the drug would not be prescribed.  Tell her not to worry.    Rx Tech

If you have sugar doughnut or bagel breakfast your blood sugar will rise and then sharply decrease and you will feel tired.  Eat more protein, especially at breakfast. If you're tired during the day it is better to have a protein or complex carbohydrate snack not a high refined carb snack.  Whole grains, nuts, cheese, turkey or protein shakes are good choices.      When choosing carbs, it's particularly important to keep in mind the distinction between simple and complex carbs. Simple carbs are digested more quickly and raise blood sugar levels faster and more dramatically. Complex carbs, on the other hand, take the digestive system longer to break down, and so they enter the bloodstream more slowly, raising blood sugar levels gradually. This will sustain your energy.      Eating any type of carbohydrate food triggers the release of insulin to clear the excess glucose from the bloodstream. But eating a highly refined carbohydrate, particularly a substantial portion of white pasta or a large bagel, can cause the pancreas to pump out even greater amounts of insulin to help restore normal blood sugar levels. If the insulin clears the glucose too quickly, blood sugar levels plummet. When blood sugar levels drop precipitously, the stomach and brain send out hunger signals that compel you to eat more food (glucose) to raise blood sugar levels again.|`|PrS7So5Yaa	Apples are as good as coffee for making you feel alert.

zddIYf9vaa	From the density of photoreceptor cells in the retina, it has effectively ~62,500 pixels/mm2 in the fovea (the central part you actually use to "look" at things) and ~5,000 pixels/mm2 in the peripheral retina.    The fovea is about 1mm in diameter, so it has an area of ~0.8mm2, and therefore has ~50,000 pixels (0.05 megapixels).  The peripheral retina has an area of ~4000mm2, and therefore has about 20 megapixels.    So the human eye has roughly 20 megapixels. But this is not a fair comparison, as they human eye is vastly superior to digital cameras in a number of ways:    - it has a 160 degree field-of-view, while most cameras have only a 35x50 degree field-of-view.  - it is sensitive in a intensity range (measured in log Lux) from -6 (a candle-flame 1 mile away on a dark night) to 5 (direct sunlight). CCD cameras can only operate over a range of three log Lux intensities.  - it fires at 500 frames per second, while CCD video cameras are only around 50-100 frames per second.    Your brain receives and processes about 72 gigabytes of information every second from your eyes alone.
VCIZJQCJaa	yes it could have very easily led to a flare up.there will be situations in live you will have to learn to avoid or spend little time in them.strong chemicals,can also be a trigger, this should pass,soon,if not please call the doctor just to check in.|`|PZLqQkstaa	Don't worry.

If you can't give up the dew, try taking calcium-magnesium tablets. They helped me when I had this problem. Also, next time you go to the doctor ask him about the possibility of having Acid-Reflux and getting treated for it.|`|cr2KKT6Naa	mt. dew has alot of caffine. so stop drinking it . drink water.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	Mountain Dew is one of the worst soda, pops, cokes, whatever you call it where you are from that you can drink.

Hwg0nji2aa	that is not small it is an average size.  7 and 5 is good and it will still grow|`|9xhIEzAKaa	Damn boy,   ten inch minimum to ride bitches these days|`|581AaVoJaa	yeah but even with a 4in penis u can please a girl u just have to know how to use it|`|FT2dOlZEaa	That is not small at all. That's huge. I'd love to have your size for sure. You should be proud of yourself. Here are the basics:    The average length of an erect adult penis is about 5.5" - 6".    Its worth remembering that the average adult penis is 'designed' to fit the average depth of the adult vagina which is also about 6".     There is no normal or average size for a soft/flaccid penis because they vary enormously. Some guys shrink a lot more than others when soft. You can NEVER judge how big a guy will be when he is erect from his soft penis size.    The average girth of an erect adult penis, that is the distance AROUND the penis measured at the thickest point, is about 5". Anywhere between 4.7 and 5.2 is normal.     Most penis growth happens between the ages of 12 and 16 with a subsequent slower rate of growth until the age of 17 or 18. Sometimes up till about 24 or 25yo.    Approximate lengths for under 18s are:  At the beginning of puberty 2.4   12 to 13 ....... 3.0" to 4.0  14 to 15 ....... 4.0" to 5.0  16 to 17 ....... 5.0" to 6.0    To convert to cm, just multiply the number in inches by 2.54cm. For example, 5 X 2.54 = 12.7 So a 5" penis is 12.7cm|`|weO0vDYgaa	yeah thats more than enough (i think)|`|oYSDEWrfaa	I have news for all the guys who ask this question. A woman doesn't "need" a man per say to reach an orgasm. Penetration isn't even necessary for her to reach an orgasm. Keeping this in mind there are still average preferences for penis size. You seem to be fine to me. What I would worry about is how you treat a girl more and your ability to understand her needs as well as your own. Personally I think romantic involvement is best when a guy understands the emotional aspect of sexual relations.     Many of times orgasms are more mental than physical that is why the size is not always important. Unless that is all a guy has to offer is his penis then I can't see this being something to worry about too much. I understand this is going against popular belief but it's true. I am not saying that there is not a definite "PLUS" to a good size penis but it certainly does not make the difference between a good and bad lover. Some guys with bigger penis's might very well be horrible lovers and smaller one's great lover's. It's a matter of perspective, maturity, and sexual exploration.     If you are hooking up with women you don't really know then to them penis size might matter. If you are in a relationship then the other components I mentioned are more important. I am not going to lie, I do personally know of some girls that won't sleep with guys who are smaller than certain sizes but they certainly are not the majority of women and I don't think those are the kind of women you should be goaling yourself for but whatever floats your boat.     Im sure you will learn more about this in time.     Good luck    ~Ms. K|`|Nsw1IcuRaa	i think your finee ;-p
Yn6pM2Xyaa	there are two kinds of ortho... preventative and corrective and depending on what the nature of her 'problems' are with how her teeth are and what needs to be done to them depends what the dentist needs to do.. in this case it sounds like he's planning on corrective.  Also note that some of the younger children also might have gotten all their teeth in early.  If parents of your cousin disagree they should by all means seek a second opinion but at this point what is waiting a few months going to do if she is already being made fun off (which is so wrong on so many levels but thats a whole other story).|`|3meIiIsmaa	The dentist would know what she needs done - she's 11 - so she shouldn't have to wait very long.  If you don't like this orthodontist's prognosis - sees another one for a second opinion.
j9mN8Sz5aa	He wants to hang up a picture on your teeth!|`|GBFhC35aaa	Because your dentsist is a very evil man who loves to drill holes in teeth and make people miserable. (just kidding, of course).

I8b66BvSaa	I guess so mate, I looked up the average a while ago because I was thinking the same sorta thing about myself, and around 5.5 inches - 7 inches is average for an adult. So 6.5 is technically above average slightly, and that's for an adult. A lot of girls aren't bothered as long as it isn't really small though anyway if that's why you're asking.|`|29TiPrpuaa	lol, good for what?

k3qKIXQ9aa	Absolutely not, all anti-depressants do is release serotonin to stop you from being depressed.    It does not, in ANY way affect  your other emotions at all|`|4uB0bbhnaa	no...    Anti depressant will help your physical symptoms as well are the unwanted emotional ones    you are still a human being an will have the 'normal'  emotions of all human beings    they will also lift your mood and make the world seem a better place|`|NWwKrrC3aa	No! I thought this too. But its not true, i've been on them and am now off them after a successful course of taking them. They have helped so much, and i am sure they will help you.

The most important thing to remember with antidepressants is they won't work straight away and it might take you a little while to find the right one. Antidepressants can't change who you are or how you feel, they just help the physical reactions to depression - So you will still get upset, or have bad days, but it helps to stop it feel like it's the end of the world or there's no way out.     It's important to find a doctor you trust, and you can always talk to them about your reactions and how you're feeling and adjust your dosage or switch medications.     Good luck and congratulations on getting help.|`|wpjeOLaBaa	It is doubtful, modern day drugs are designed to do  job alone, and not mess with anything else upthere!!!!!
X4kCc14Maa	Put ice on it. Take a motrin, it will help the swelling go down. Are you still able to have movement in your hands/knuckles? If so, I would wait for a day or two and if it still hurts, I would see a doctor as soon as possible. If you have insurance however, I would go to a doctor whenever possible if it's bothering you at all..|`|0BkJg5KKaa	That's fine, if it's still swolen in a few days ask a professional. If you hit something hard like that the body will try to defend itself.|`|sdYoRJnUaa	Apply ice to it for 20 minute intervauls every few hours. Take advil / asprin to take away some of the pain / swelling.  It should start going down by tomorrow, if its not getting any better within 2 days i'd see a doctor may be a slight fracture.|`|mS0ulYUoaa	um no its not actually go to the doctors i dont want it to get worse it sounds really painfull|`|t1rn1jDBaa	it is normal if u punched something very hard|`|RT1HAmWEaa	just rest it, if its swollen it will usually turn a few different colors before going back to normal, usually a yellowy color for me. but if you are desperately concerned than go and see your GP.|`|rftEZA50aa	You may have a small fracture. go doctors|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	You may have cracked something.|`|wREWRilkaa	definatly go to the doctors, it could be infected or even a broken knuckle....|`|5k9XizbMaa	You probably broke it, go get it checked out.|`|D1G4H83baa	see a doctor...i punched a guy in class once and i thought i just bruised my knuckle....then 3 months late wentto the doc and they xrayed it and said it was broken, but i got lucky cuz it set in the right place......just see a doc to be safe

Iv3QRoZiaa	You really need to talk to somebody. If you trust your band teacher then talk to him. You really need to let your parents know about this. This is serious and you need to get help from someone. Please find someone to talk to!!! Good luck to you.|`|Hrl8NNOQaa	Well, to be honest anyone who is over the age of 18 and who is the school district is going to tell your parents, but I am sure that they will tell them when you are there.  I would speak to this teacher that you apparently respect as a role model. I would ask to speak with him privately, and then I would mention to him that there are somethings that you would like to discuss. Tell him that you are dealing with issues and the only way you know how to handle them is to cut yourself, and that you would like to receive help for it.|`|0BkJg5KKaa	Well, normally I would say stop. But if it's a serious problem and you cannot stop then you need to tell someone, they should help you, it's just like say your best friend threatened to kill themselves because they thought no one would miss them, when you would, you would tell someone to try to make them see sense.  I think it's better your parents find out sooner, rather than later.

Or the time when i spent my entire night eating ketchup chips and watching the High as F**K song on youtube. Grandmas kisses video wasn't bad either.|`|WNTzcc6saa	That is such a ridiculous question to ask here. People smoke because their peers pressure them to, because they like the sensation, because it is a habit, because they wish to explore the hidden realms of their mind, and I could go on. If people do or don't, that is their personal choice, but asking about an illegal activity like that on a prominent website can't be smart. Ask your friends.|`|OZVg6Un5aa	NO.   I've never done it, and don't plan to.  I personally think that weed is for idiots who have no lives or any other way of having fun.    When your high, what do you do? Just sit around and do nothing all day? probably.    And all weed does is eff up your life. I've seen so many of my friends get involved with it who either end up dropping out, or getting involved with other more dangerous drugs.  Not to mention it can really mess up your brain.    Sure it makes you laugh non stop, but you could do that without being high and get REAL enjoyment out of it.    Now give me your reasons for smoking weed.

XEtESkISaa	No. You cannot force someone to seek medical attention. If they are unconscious and cannot make decisions for them self, then you can call 911 and have them treated. Also, if you call an ambulance, they are able to persuade people.|`|qmBE8DQKaa	I am not a professional, but I would recommend you explain to this "adult" how their not seeking medical attention affects and/or hurts you. They might decide that your well-being is important to them and give in to your request.  Otherwise, unless their not seeking medical attention can cause immediate danger to others, what a person does to him/herself is their own business.|`|v2ZBawa7aa	No.  As long as they are mentally able to make the decision, they can refuse medical attention.  If you call 911 on someone and they refuse medical treatment by the paramedics, they can sign an "Against Medical Advice" form to refuse treatment.  If someone is in the hospital and decides to refuse further treatment they can do the same thing, sign an "AMA" form and leave the hospital.|`|C4AUC5vGaa	You can't force them but maybe you can strongly persuade them.    My supervisor was really worried about me. She saw something that I was doing that seemed strange to her. I didn't think anything was wrong, and was not going to see the doctor. One day I went into work. She handed me the phone, told me the clinics phone number, and wouldn't let me work until I had an appointment. She even covered my shift so I could go to the appointment. I was really mad at first. But...what I found out from the doctor (or will find out) could have saved my life. I was grateful that she somewhat coerced me to go. I gave her a big hug and said thanks.

My mother and I had always been so close.  And she had hardly ever been sick enough to go to the doctor.  It was overwhelming to me.  The surgery went well but upon restoring full blood flow to her brain, another artery was weak and it ruptured, causing her to bleed completely out and flatline on the table.  They used what she now calls "the jumper cables" to bring her back.  After that they had to take a peice of her skull out and freeze it because her brain was swelling.  They put her into a drug-induced coma to limit brain function and keep the swelling down as much as possible.  I had never seen her sick and when I walked into the room and saw her laying there, swelled as she was, with tubes and wires running in every direction, I almost fainted.  My big brother had to catch me before I hit the floor and he carried me out of there.  That was the worse thing that had happened to me.  I had always been so sheltered.
aiBOMU9kaa	Your eyes have obviously changed since your last exam and glasses.    You need to get another exam and have your lenses updated. Only the results of an eye exam can determine how much they have changed.    And there are no exercises that are going to help restore your vision. It has changed because you are growing.
kxwWfjFKaa	It depends how advanced the cancer is when they find it, and usually when it's in the lungs, it's somewhere else in the body too. But that is not always the case, of course! My grandpa stopped smoking when he was 50 after smoking since he was a teen, and he's now 75 and perfectly healthy. Your lungs can regenerate after you stop smoking, so as long as you do not smoke anymore, I don't think you have to worry about damage that has not already been done.    The symptoms of lung cancer would most likely be difficulty breathing, and pains in the chest. However, it could just be a general sick feeling.|`|a4kTbjfeaa	Symptoms of lung cancer are not specific and include cough (may be bloody), difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, weight loss, chest pain. If you have a history of smoking and these symptoms the doctor may want to check for a lung mass. Some lung tumors are found incidentally on x rays or CT scans which are done for other reasons. Lung cancer is diagnosed with a CT scan which shows a mass. A bronchoscopy and biopsy (either via the bronch, CT guided or open) are needed to obtain tissue to determine the type of cancer so that treatment can begin.   The symptoms are very nonspecific so people chalk it up to a cold and don't seek medical treatment which explains the late stage diagnosis.   Here is more info on lung CA:   http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/lungc...
aO0JSbHTaa	First off, let me make this clear; it does not matter how long you are in the gym or how long you work out. It's about how intense the workout is for you as an individual.    If your goal for walking is to burn calories and speed up you metabolism and you don't have much time on your hands, I recommend that you increase the pace in which you walk so you can walk less(saving time) and still burn the same amount of calories.    If it is only one day you're missing, don't worry about it as much as you are, you'll be fine. you wont gain 20lbs for missing a day. But if you feel like you really need to workout, then make today your rest day and workout tomorrow.|`|uUvV7eadaa	no, skipping one workout will not effect you. good luck on your recovery.
iGRXt2Wvaa	You must of strained the muscle or pulled it, because your muscles in your knees aren't used to the workout, therefore they havent adjusted.   Simply stretch next time.  To make the pain go away try a warm bath, warm cloth or heating pad|`|7U6xwZx9aa	more than likely you pulled something, but nothing to worry about, just don't push it too far...:)  or maybe you sprained it....somehow *smiles*|`|AA11506348	It sounds like you have some inflammation.  I would start by icing it (20 minutes at a time) and taking Ibu profin or Advil.  See how it feels in the morning.  If it is still painful, then I would start researching the knee joint and/or go to a doctor.|`|liHpJvVfaa	You should try using an elliptical machine. They are the best for not straining your knees.
yPJMdeYPaa	its called you bump into something and it bleeds inside without breaking your skin so it leaves a briuse. duh shacarlian... we leared that in mrs. Pratricia Penos class.|`|8e172b6b03562dfb30dd48d18dae04baaa	http://webmd.com|`|sxmQSpagaa	if you lose your appetite, it could be something emotional. the bruising and pain are caused by your body not getting the vitamins and minerals it needs to fully repair itself.     for people who can't eat much, doctors tend to suggest the BRAT diet (bread, rice, applesauce, and toast) and I would take a women's multivitamin.     make sure the multivitamin has B6, B12, and Iron in it.    try to go for walks and spend time redeveloping your appetite by eating light and only what sounds good. in time it will come back!
a4kTbjfeaa	If that diet worked then no doctor would recommend chemo which is a toxic treatment. Chemo is used because rigorous scientific research has shown that it is effective in many types of cancer. Eating a raw food diet will not substitute for chemo.|`|AA12066269	Fruit and vegetables may help to prevent some cancers but they won't cure an existing cancer.  A good friend died 4 years ago after giving up on chemo and trying a raw food diet.|`|FYUHJyvpaa	Well, your best allies in the fight against cancer, the fruits and vegetables. Over the past 30 years, more than 250 studies have evaluated the relationship between these plants and the disease. 80 have found a protective effect unequivocal. According to most studies, those who consume too little and have a risk 1.5 to 2 times greater chance of developing cancer. This effect could be explained by the action of different components: fiber, vitamins, polyphenols ... Several studies put forward including the role of antioxidants such as beta-carotene, vitamins C and E or selenium.|`|Q4ggnG0waa	I guess he'll die healthy, soon.
3urQfMffaa	Anger Management For Dummies  ACT on Life, Not on Anger  Getting Over Getting Mad    I recently checked these books out bc I'm having anger problems too and way worse than you.|`|G9VBTg47aa	You need to take time to quiet the mind IMO.|`|ub6641d2aa	Invite Jesus into your life and ask him to help you.|`|axdgDiGMaa	try an anger management course and see what they reccomend for you|`|Yl1eAhamaa	study diplomacy and slowly start to practice it. diplomacy will teach you how to maintain a balanced conversation and not blow up and go to extremes. anger is part of the animal that is inside all of us and it likes to act up and start growling but then we are acting like an animal. so learn how to not like an animal by educating yourself on how to behave like a human and keep that growling animal chained.  close your eyes and look inside and find the softest spot you can find in there. look at this soft spot. remember this spot. then when u get angry. remember this soft spot preferably before u get angry. this will remind you that there is softness inside and that you can be gentle if you wanted to. so know well this softness so it is easy to remember. look inside to find it for a minute or so whenever u get a chance then you will get to know this softness just as well as u know your anger.
rv9nDch2aa	Girl, I think that you are having your period.

AhO0Uoppaa	its got to be moved back into place so the bone will heal straight.Then eaither taped to another toe or it might have some kinda splint attatched to it.   Its gonna hurt, dont listen to the person who said it wont.But it will be quick.    It depends on your toe about the "re-setting" or setting...re setting means its got to be broke so its gonna heal straight.    If its gotta be "set" then that just means the toe is gonna be put in a straight position so it can heal straight.|`|FklngtvCaa	it must be put back in its place to heal properly.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	You have to splint it.  Typically though all you can do is tape it to the next one and let it heal on it's own.|`|KaAXJJo8aa	it means it has to be put back as close as possible in the correct position and splinted to allow it to heal properly.|`|LiOOF1Plaa	It means the doc needs to apply a splint on the busted toe. Casts are almost never used on toes, because they heal so fast. The toe location and nerve endings with blood circulation, assists healing greatly.|`|8ZoSSslFaa	it means that they have to put  your toe back in the right place for it to heal|`|x42Hz54taa	it means the bone needs to be put back into propor place before they put the cast on so it heals into normal position    it doesnt normally hurt      (((i dont know why i got 3 thumbs down... considering im right. ive broken many things and they always say "set" and thats what it means. plus, thats what all the rest of you said))))|`|Fd02NWmhaa	ask him for details.|`|PN7XMglOaa	It means he or she has to tape that toe to the next one unttil it heals . Sorry , but that is all you can do with a broken toe .|`|eaPEkOxtaa	he means that its ready to be broken again lol its to easy to break toes:P|`|FWnRZ8yMaa	It means that when the bone in the toe was broken or fractured it was "un-set" or, moved. The doctor will probably forcefully move it back into place, it's nothing to be worried about though it's better if you do it sooner than later.|`|dTEbLgvEaa	It means that it must have been broken pretty badly because usually broken toes are not set.  At most they are taped to an adjacent toe for a while to give support.|`|OnRQ3Erfaa	they will have to put it back in place or if its not that bad it will heal by itself and they cant have a cast forn you they will only give you wraPPING AROUND IT|`|gsQU85fIaa	all the dr can do is set "realign" your toe but it will never heal
sw2R5A9iaa	the scans no longer use a pure iodine contrast.  speak to your doctor about the exact allergy.|`|tYutrD8Taa	probably because you are allergic to it.  :-)  j/k    the amount in garlic and salt is nothing compared to how much full strength iodine was probably in the injection.  so that may be why.|`|450539d29675dc973b0ec09791ed6c66aa	Because you are allergic to it.That was a larger amount of iodine that what is in salt.
AA10350894	Yes, if your testicles "died" they would have to be removed or they could become Gangrenous (rotting decomposition) and the resulting infection would most likely kill you. You would then be offered synthetic testicles made from the same materials as artificial breasts and would have to take hormone therapy to maintain your Testosterone levels.|`|lkNJNnlSaa	why would they have to take them out?|`|441GSyaMaa	Erm... how would they... die?    I think they'd just stop producing sperm, not die, shrivel up and ... turn mouldy|`|AA12155452	Have you been up all night working on this one?   But I can tell you that the aliens don't have a problem there .... they are all extra-testicular ..... lol  ......... anyway, testicles don't die, they become subject to a 'dropped bollock' .....|`|GLEGh4N0aa	i dunno... but wana hear something thatll make you cross your legs??  it only takes 12 kilo 2 pull your bollox off. might even trap em in the night, turn quickly and kabloom theyre gone.   a man told me that wonderful piece of information btw. strange man.|`|lrpG23Ycaa	youre weird|`|YuH1olZCaa	The only way your nuts can "die" is if you "die" as well.|`|5580828d87e34f27c0a85291cf4a20c4aa	They just simply drop off...lol|`|zBKUS5hxaa	Hopefully this is just a hypothetical question and you're just engaging in a little fantasy.  In answer, yes.  It would be necessary to remove any of the remaining tissue to keep from getting infected.  The exception is when castration is done the way that it's done on livestock.  Very small and strong rubber bands are clamped high on the scrotum above the testicles.  The blood flow is completely cut off and eventually the remaining bag (testicles and all) below the rubber band just drops off.  This is called "band castration".  Please don't try this at home.  This is for cattle.  Not people.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	lolz.. look it up buddy|`|LoKJBLF1aa	There is usually a deflating of sack ceremony with bugles and bagpipes.|`|vjqXsVRnaa	If for some reason you had to have your testicles removed prosthetic implant would be inserted into the scrotum (sack)|`|swbS13Xmaa	Youd be left with an empty sack. ask santa on december 26th.
ae3e1d351362ce2aa8644626c2d77f9caa	You know what they say about people with cold feet, they need socks lol, no it means that you have a warm heart. If you have a partner, just put them on your partner to warm them,  failing that an extra blanket wrapped round them that always does the trick, and if not then stick to the socks hehe|`|axgsykquaa	socks dumbass socks|`|hlOqDkj6aa	I don't know, but it will certainly be a.....feat!

RXI8ImdIaa	It depends on what type of master's degree you obtain, and I think there is additional certification to get, kind of like how you need a degree and the NCLEX to be an RN.    There are master's degrees in several areas of nursing and they are not all advanced practice.|`|Sozc3MyFaa	You need to attend a nurse practitioner's program (which will grant a masters) and then take & pass the national exam in order to be  a NP.
AA11176387	since this is in the alternative medicine section, I am assuming you are looking for an herb or natural supplement as opposed to a medical drugs    the herb feverfew has been very useful for migraines.    Use an organic tincture    Example (herbpharm is a good brand that is both organic and a tincture)..    ________________    why organic?  It is 7-10 times higher in the phytochemicals that cure and prevent disease found in plants     _________________    why a tincture it is much easier absorbed than useless herbal capsules and extracts more potent chemical than a tea    what dose..the standard dose for herbal tinctures (liquid extracts)  is about 60 drops 3-5 times a day or use the doing on the bottle B UT modify it into a children dose using Clark's rule explained at this link    for instance if the adult dose (150 lb person) is 30 drops, a 75 lb child would use 1/2 of 150 dose or 15 drops..a 50 lb kid would use 1/ of the 150 lb dose or 20 drops a pet for instance weighing 15 pounds would use 15/150 or 1/10th the adult dose so in this case of 30 drops, the pet would take 3 drops or 1/10th    here is the link to Clark's rule and further advise on children    http://curezone.com/schulze/handbook/CAD...    here is more info on feverfew    and here are more remedies and suggestions including the diet    http://altmedicine.about.com/cs/headache...      http://www.pcrm.org/health/prevmed/migra...|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	excedrine ..1/2 the adult dose depending on weight of child ..ask the pharmacist he can tell you the exact dose ..as far as alternative meds ..I found nothing works for a migrain..although "feverfew" if taken daily will prevent them from coming but not take one away|`|l1ULKxclaa	I take vicadin for mine|`|c0342d26192961a8e86c337c0610b25aaa	Ask the Child's Doctor!!!!

lLC7Cf2zaa	Don't give him Pepto at all - every - because it has aspirin in it, which can cause some terrible complication and illness in children esp. if they could possibly have the flu.  But that doesn't sound like the flu b/c the flu is an upper respiratory illness and you're referring to a stomach virus.  Either he is having a reaction like food poisoning (check his peanut butter and it's sources) or a stomach virus.  It really isn't that right time of year for the stomach virus but I guess it's possible.  It's flu and other respiratory virus time.  Did he eat or drink something that he is allergic to or doesn't agree with him?  Been into any cabinets where drugs and chemicals are being kept?  Does he have a low fever, too - because if he does, it's a virus.|`|9alN3sCTaa	dont know if pepto is good.  but the pedialite is good. watch for a fever. go to a doctor tomorrow morning.    to avoid the flu, wash hands often and keep your hands away from your face(mucous membranes)|`|uDUvrLM0aa	My 4 year old had the flu last weekend. Scary stuff. Pedialite is good and try some crackers...my son now believes crackers are the cure to stop throwing up, lol.|`|o8Xfn2bfaa	Just make sure to give him sips of pedialyte or water as often as you can so he doesnt get dehydrated. Does he have a fever? If he does you might need to see if he can keep down some children's tylenol. Just try keeping him hydrated!!! If he seems lethargic it could be a sign that he needs to get to the doc to receive fluids. Good luck!|`|OpZehgpwaa	he probly just ate some bad food thatll happen. it shoud subside in a few days at the most. but sum kids tylenol will help too.
AekVyLneaa	Sometimes when you vomit, the vomit can go down your windpipe. Your windpipe and esophagus are right next to each other.  When anything besides air enters your windpipe, it can make you feel like you can breathe.  This occurs quite frequently in the elderly and people who have swallowing problems (dysphagia).  The food comes back up from the stomach and enters the airway.  Sometimes this can lead to what is called aspiration pneumonia.  Since you did get better it is most likely that you did not get aspiration pneumonia.      Another reason as to why you may have felt as though you could not breahe, it that your mouth and nose are 2 main passages for breathing.  When you are throwing up and throwing up, you are not breathing properly.  Your body is going through its' natural process of getting rid of the bug by vomitting.    I would not worry about getting sick again.  This just may have been a one time deal.    When I was pregnant for my first child, I encountered pretty much the same situation as you.  It is pretty scary but nothing bad ever happened to me.|`|LpXQgOjCaa	I did that last time i had the flu. it was so scary, i was trying to scream for help but i couldnt so i fell from the chair and hit my head and my mom came running in, it was really scary. . im not sure if its normal though.|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	I'm sorry you had that experience.  I've never had that experience but I'm sure there are other people who have.  Luckily, you puked again and it cleared.  So you're ok!  If it starts happening again, keep you head upright until you feel the urge to puke in the bucket or toilet then just lean over, don't put your head upside down.  Make sure you have enough fluids intake - try Gatorade or the low-sugar kind if you can handle it without throwing up and doing  2 or  3.  And just try some saltine crackers until you feel better.|`|7d92fea894a319f966b40ae7494fa5a5aa	I did that when I had Whooping Cough, it's the worst thing, you cough until you vomit, then you can't get your breath.  You'll be ok though, I don't think you need to go to the doctor.
UOZP4Ma5aa	It depends on what you eat, some foods stimulate the taste buds longer, while others not, color influences a persons perception of what it will taste like, bright colors in nature denotes danger,  some colors like green denote food that is off, for example if you made eggs and colored them green, people will not want to eat it although it will taste the same
hHSsMyNpaa	No.  Its called orthodontic relapse.  You will need to redo some/most/all your treatment.  Thats pretty tough.  The other responder is right don't try to force anything as you could cause damage.|`|nGOf6OT9aa	omg same here!!!i wore mine for about 2 days it hurt soooo bad i took them out. I go to the dentist in april so i have to start wearing them before he sees my teeth. im going probably try this weekend and keep them in for a little while then take them out and repeat. you should do the same. i might have to buy a new one if it doesnt fit at all. if it hurts still keep them in because ur teeth r moving good luck|`|f25136f77bb8e33b645c3b0896a24e5baa	You might be able to, but the retainer will be tight. The retainer will not move your teeth back into their original position, but it will keep them from moving further out of alignment. Alternately, if the retainer doesn't fit, you could get one of those athletic mouthgards from Wal-Mart for about $1 and wear it at night. You have to boil the mouthguard and then put it in your mouth so it will conform to your teeth. This would keep your teeth from moving anymore.|`|YUV9SNBuaa	I never had real braces but just got done with invisalign, which is like a series of retainers that slowly move your teeth. They warned me that you can never move your teeth too much in too short of a time or you risk actually losing your teeth! They can become disconnected from the root! I would imagine in 2 years your teeth have moved a lot. Maybe you could try them on to see how tight they are but really I would only recommend seeing the orthodontist for real assessment. It's not worth it! Good luck!
P7ctol89aa	E-mail me, k.sordo@gmail.com.  I'll show you some exercises that will correct your flat feet.|`|JFo1tiaQaa	Flat feet means you are excessively pronating which puts a lot of pressure on your feet- in turn this can cause foot pain, knee pain, hip pain and even lower back pain. I would def suggest getting custom made orthotics. Your health insurance may cover it- an out of pocket expense would be about $130-200 dollars. It is well worth it.    Also, you may want to work out the plantar fascia (the bottom of your foot) by taking a tennis ball and rolling your foot over it.     Finally see a chiropractor about your foot pain. Not only can they suggest and fit you for orthotics, they can also look for misalignments in the spine. Hope this helps.|`|M5XjqI40aa	See an orthopedist for arch supporting shoe inserts.
voaMM1GQaa	Mental:  -A stronger sense of Calm. You slowly gain the ability to retain your composure in stressful situations.  -A Significant Increase in your focus level. Holding a difficult position for minutes on end requires one to pour all of their willpower into keeping balanced.    Physical:  -You get ripped. My Instructor, after years of yoga (she is 40) is completely and totally muscular. No steroids, weightlifting. not a body builder's body, but she is definitely not someone you want to run into in a dark alley!    - You can attain a keen sense of balance over time. I can now balance on one leg for quite sometime without falling, thanks to Yoga.    Social  -Confidence-the sense of peace and the physical body you develop from yoga is more than enough to encourage yourself to put yourself out there, accept regret, and embrace success in your relationships.    - Yoga isn't like kickboxing. you hardly move, but in the holding you gain great power. The patience required is more than likely to spill into your other life, making you a more complacent and friendly, not to mention overall happier individual.      I hope I helped :)
WlwAEOE5aa	The common cold is with us year round. Since people tend to stay indoors during the winter the germs/virus get spread easily. The dry air from home heating dries out our nasal passages also making us more susceptible.|`|VBdXray0aa	Doctors on TV say it is because of being indoors cooped up and too close too often with others who are ill.  Artificial heating is extremely dry and dehydration makes us more receptive to colds, flus, etc.    And yes, lack of fresh, circulating air.  I have seen articles on this, too.  I am of the opinion that we should bring back the very noisy but healthy steam heat registers.
K4zsztkRaa	Yes it is okay, after a while you won't get sore anymore, the frist couple times are tough but take a hot bath and take some Advil etc. IT will help a lot but it's okay to work out when sore, you just have to leave yourself with a 24 hour rest period at least.    Also you aren't going to do much for your body if you aren't n a strict high protien low fat diet.    Also just do as much weight as you can handle, if you don't want to do more then don't, but don't make anyone force you to hurt yourself. And also if you are doing things to the point where you can't do them with good form, then the people telling you to do this are morons. If you can't lift the weights with propor form because they are too heavy you will hurt yourself. And when you injure yourself it can be perminant dammage in most cases.    Just make sure you aren't pushing too hard.    -Connor
ZfhVGgVMaa	No lips usually do no swell when they are chapped.  The lips are pretty much the most resilient spots of the body to heal.  You will be ok  Put a soft cream on it like petroleum jelly and you will be ok.  The softer the cream the deeper it penetrates.  If it swells a bit you get Angelina jolie lips, you can try it out

Does it itch for them?  Like, do they go around scratching it?  it may only be extremely dry skin in this fine winter weather we're having.  have you tried putting vaseline or aquaphor or baby oil on them to see if that helps to clear it up?  or it could even be a fungal rash.  if you think that may be it, then i recommend lamisil.  it works really well.
tG5Ff534aa	i would say it's a problem if you aren't careful.  i went through a phase like this when i was a teenager (i'm not sure how old you are), and i can't say it's ALWAYS a problem because in my case i stopped doing it eventually.      there are obviously better ways to deal with stress/anger/anxiety like exercising, punching bags, writing, talking to friends ect.....     but just be careful that it doesn't become to often and you aren't cutting too deep.  by all means, i'm not saying doing this is a good thing, i'm just saying that i went through the same thing and it's possible that it doesn't turn into a major problem.  i also wouldn't call it "no big deal".    just be careful and take care of yourself.  if it gets worse or keeps continuing and not getting LESS frequent, than you should seek help|`|Zm1RnZd7aa	whoa!!!! if you want attention try hanging out with some friends. or maybe find whatever makes you upset enough to cut yourself, and eliminate it from your lifestyle. if you can't totally take your stress inducer out of your lifestyle, try finding a hobby that you enjoy and helps calm you down. i used to know a girl who cut herself, until one day she took it too far and almost killed herself! you should not really resort to cutting yourself|`|e61e97ce7197ef3797fdc64f3b935342aa	Yes, all cutting be it "big" or "small" IS a problem. You need to look at why you cut and to do this you should call your doctor. If you only cut "lightly" at the moment believe me, this will increase in severity and frequency. You need to get in Control of this before it spirals out of hand.

AA11124121	This is the reason most stop heavy pot usage.    It speeds up your pulse, and heart rate goes up.  Since your thoughts are dancing around you think  there must be something wrong with you, that maybe  you're dying, or worse, going crazy. Suddenly, it's a little fuzzy hearing things. You feel like you're in a play, looking at yourself from somewhere else...talking is an issue, because you feel like you're reading from a  play. This is not fun, but manageable. Lie down, close eyes, breathe slowly.    It's a panic attack.   Mild chemical psychosis. Even though the pot wears  off, it's psychological effects linger..for days.  Your pot smokin days are over..and it's ok...  just learn that noone ever died from an attack...unless they ran  out into the street and got killed by a car..  Get to work, work hard, curb the booze, learn to cope with life without a crutch...and you'll be fine.  Remember, booze has it's own set of issues too..

If you're stressing out about the pot affecting you, your thoughts about pot may actually be causing those symptoms. Sometimes, the day after smoking, you feel what they call "burnt out," which is just feeling sleepy and out of it. It goes away the following day. Try to de-stress (probably not by smoking pot :) and you might feel better! Or talk to a therapist. That's always a good idea, no matter what's going on in your head.|`|QXlvr4zBaa	Honestly I think the weed has nothing to do with it. If you mixed it with other drugs, yes.

My answer is: good question.  You aren't allowing a simple message so I've come here to talk to you.  Your written "symptoms" of drug use are more or less the obscurations of enlightenment. We don't need anything to be enlightened, we need not...meaning all the stuff we are needing, has to let go of. If letting becomes a stress it becomes a new part of the mind mess that hides enlightenment.  Confused? Good, confusion is good.  Do not think about the confusion and you'll notice that the confusion ceases.   That's the "trick" of it all. Stunningly simple.  A word of amusement, we don't really have a vocabulary to talk of enlightenment. Is easy to talk of what it is not, but the IS....Now is enlightenment, and now is always new, changes, flows.  If you want a simple taste of mind stillness, and it'll only be a brief taste at first, go somewhere quiet, eg.your bed at night, listen to the ssssssssssssssss of the silence. It's the silence. This sound is always present, just like the now is. Attention on this sound stops thoughts. If thoughts arise, listen to the sound and the thoughts vanish.  Purpose of this exercise is to have control over your mind, instead of it controlling you.  The silent stillness is the peace from where all real growth occurs.   All the best fella.  Si

Hq6nSl1Qaa	Obviously you are asking because you are having some kind of reaction.  So let's make sure you understand what it is about.    Lactose intolerance means that your body doesn't produce the enzymes that convert lactose into a usable sugar.  Since you don't absorb and utilize the sugar, bacteria will.  As a result, you'll get some combination of an "upset stomach" gas, nausea, vomiting, etc.  The way to test this is by drinking lactose-free milk, where the enzyme you may be missing is added to convert most of the sugars for you.    Since the bacteria used to make cheese convert most of the lactose into various organic acids that you can still digest, you shouldn't have problems with cheese.    Some people have glyco-protein allergies that are the result of pasteurization.  The lacto-casein complex can be a potent allergy trigger akin to most food allergies.    Take a look at the table link below and see what the average lactose content is, then experiment to see if there is a threshold where you start getting allergies.|`|UkhaWSz4aa	Drink a lot of milk and see if you get sick?...
P2eJQSzMaa	It may mean that the 'gun' is your 'protector'.  'Running' means you are staying clear of danger, watching your every corner.    Just watch what you do a little closer.  Since you seen yourself at your house, holding a gun, and running.  Watch yourself with what happens at home. Since you where at home, it must happen there.    I'm a young medium and I see/hear about different types of dreams like this, then try to put myself in their position and help them understand what it may mean that connects to their life somehow.    I had a similar dream.   I was running from something/one, than found out it was me.  I don't run much either in real life.    The next day, I was having a bad day and found ways to fix things that weren't working out, and haven't had a dream like that since.    Hope this helps.  ~Amanda L.G.|`|pcPcuQGNaa	To see a gun in your dream, symbolizes aggression, anger, and potential danger. You may be dealing with issues of passiveness/aggressiveness and authority/dependence. Alternatively, a gun represents the penis and male sexual drive. Thus, the gun may mean power or impotence, depending on whether the gun went off or misfired.

Also, your immune system may not be able to fight off certain strains of viruses that could be affecting you.  It is really hard to say from just the description.  The best thing to do is have the doctor do a complete blood workup the next time it occurs and maybe you can determine the cause.  Make a list of everything you can remember eating at the onset.  Then, compare the list to everything you have eaten the next time after that.  Many people have food allergies and can experience viral-like symptoms.    Shayde could be right.

It was a year or more before I could tolerate hot or cold liquids! It turned out he fractured my tooth while grinding out the old filling . It was about 10 years before I found out it was fractured. Occasionally If I ate corn chips , a small fragment could become wedged in the fracture and the pain could last a day or three... Since the fracture, I went to two different dentist before the second one noted the "fracture" to his assistant on an Xray . I asked what tooth it was, sure that I already knew, and he confirmed it was the one that I had been so sensitive.   If he wont see you , find another you can trust .
edFyHFRhaa	I did a program similar to Atkins and lost a similar amount in my first week however, it doesn't continue at that rate. The first week you mostly lose water however, you should also only weigh yourself once a week, not every few days. You weight can fluctuate dramatically from day to day so stick to weighing on the same day & roughly the same time each week for a more accurate result. You say you have lost 8lbs so far but give it a few more days and that could change to 6lbs... it's dependant on food intake as well as water consumption and whether or not you're retaining water.    Another thing I will mention is that these diets make it extremely difficult for you to maintain the weight you will lose. I lost about 30lbs in a relatively short period of time but have since put it all back on and more, almost overnight. Also, the fat that I have put on is different to before... it sounds wierd I know but before, I didn't have a lot of cellulite, now I do.    I understand how helpful Atkins can be for an initial boost in weight loss but I do feel you should try to find something more healthy to follow for the longer term or you very well may end up regretting it. I will never do that diet again - eventhough I lost so much.|`|jnneaHtgaa	That is normal. You just lost water weight.|`|hmtNNo7Haa	Actually, you don't have to diet per se to lose weight, the only method that clearly delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a small number of free trials left, it was highlighted in Fox News and CNN.

pzLDXL6gaa	There's no reason for circumcision. Your condition is probably frenulum breve - ask about frenuloplasty (loosening the frenulum, not removing it) before they actually do a frenectomy. It would be silly to remove the whole foreskin just for this. More healing time needed and loss in sensation.    You could even have a tight foreskin, have you tried stretching it at home? http://circresearch.googlepages.com/tigh...

Keep your foreskin. Also, if you have an erection, and are still young, your foreskin probably will not be fully retractable, which is fine, it will get more retractable when you get older.

If you are not hard, and it still does not go all the way back, then ask the doctor for some steroid cream to loosen your foreskin. I heard there are stretching exercises you can take. I do not want you to get cut because I care and do not want a fellow male to suffer circumcision.|`|K4zsztkRaa	I think you should stay uncircumcised because sex feels alot better uncircumcised, plus there isno reason to get circumcised.

They just want to make money and force their beliefs on their patients when it comes to circumcision.    What do you have exactly?  is it phismosis or is it a frenulum breve, afrenulum breive can be fixed with a simple cut, and not a whole circumcision, that would be your best option.    As for phismosis don't let a doctor talk you into getting a circumcision untill you have tried stretching excercises with a steroid cream.    I think you need to exsplore your options more. And remember just becuase they are a doctor doesn't mean they are smarter than you. A lot of doctors don't know how to treat foreskin problems so they just cut it off. I think you should ask the doctors about steroid creams, My friend had a tight foreskin and needed that fixed and the creams worked fantasic, even tho he went to three other doctors that told him the creams would never work. Well they did so just because they say that doesn't mean it's true.    -Connor|`|jOFRD9sLaa	Don't do it.|`|Yb99bIdnaa	Doctors in the US aren't trained in how to deal with foreskin issues, so they just amputate it whenever something crops up. Whether this is frenulum breve or phimosis, it can be treated without circumcision.    You can't undo a circumcision, so take your time on this decision, and get a second or third opinion! Find a doctor who was trained in England or Europe, where circumcision is rare and they know other treatments for foreskin problems.    As to your question: The reasons you should stay uncircumcised are many. Since you'll be making the decision yourself I'll skip the human-rights reasons and cut to the chase, as it were: Sexual please, for your and your eventual partners, is very much affected by the presence or absence of your foreskin.     I'm trying to stay within the community guidelines while giving you enough information to answer your question, which is difficult! Basically, many sexual problems that women blame themselves for (inadequate lubrication, soreness or pain during or after intercourse, inability to orgasm from intercourse) are strongly correlated with their partners being circumcised. Essentially, male circumcision affects female pleasure.     The only reason you might want TO get circumcised is that some girls (who're ignorant of foreskin) think it looks better.|`|FpiwrF5paa	well iknow this is weird coming from a 15 year old girl but.... dont get the foreskin removed... as long as you keep it very clean and always wash ... the sexual experience will be much better in the long run...|`|i6RlYFo7aa	girls don't care, i have asked  and there are other alternatives to this minor propblem, you can stretch the skin (look up stretching excercises) and get a steroid cream so that the skin loosens up and retracts all the way    there are no benefits to circumcision, you'll end up with a dried up penis head and an ugly scar    and before anyone brings up that BS hygiene issue;  both cut/uncut giuys need to wash their penis, neither is cleaner than the other|`|u8CFwtyMaa	Circumcision (or genital mutilation, to give it it's correct name) is very rarely necessary.  If you can pull the foreskin back, and clean under it, there is no risk of infection, trust me, I've lived with a foreskin lot longer than you, and had no problems.  The only benefit is to the bank account of the surgeon.  There are other surgical options, and it will loosen with age, but you can probably resolve the problem yourself, by stretching it.  Do it in the bath or shower - the hot water helps to soften the skin.  Insert a clean finger under the foreskin, and gently pull it, don't do it so much that it hurts, as this can cause micro tears, that then heal with scars -not what you want.  It will take several weeks before you see any results, but keep it up daily and you'll get there  Pulling the foreskin back whenever you pee will help, as will masturbating.  Hope this helps|`|I7r6y2rgaa	honestly im 15 and am circumsized and id rather it be like that in my opinion it doesnt look something that would come from a dog. i like mine circumsized and i dont think the "feeling" changes at all it is if anything cosmetic and i personally would do it.|`|CNW6eAjoaa	The last thing you need is to be circumcised.  Your doctor should not even have mentioned it.  At this point, you should be very firm and tell him/her it is not an option.  Follow the information and stretches in the links below and you will be fine.  Save your foreskin from being cut off.  You will never regret it.  The doctor may tell you circumcision is the only option but his actions are being driven by greed and lack of understanding of how to treat an intact penis.  Go to www.norm.org and read about the reason and the function of the foreskin.  You will also see that the idea of circumcision being better is a myth propagated by the medical profession because it makes a lot of money performing this unnecessary procedure.  You can read up about why your skin is tight, and how to perform the stretches to loosen it.    You can also ask your doctor, (perhaps find a foreskin friendly doctor) for steroid cream that will loosen the fenar band of the dartos muscle (the ring of muscle that forms the closure) and make retraction easier.  Circumcision is like driving a thumb tack with a sledge hammer.  You just cannot help but do more harm than good.  I can say personally that a foreskin is better.  I was cut as a child, and am now restoring my foreskin.  Since I have started restoring, things are way better, even with the limited growth I have so far.  Information is your best weapon in this matter, along with a very firm 'No' to your doctor.  Good luck with this and if you have questions, please feel free to write.|`|cSmUqspWaa	Don't do it!

They're telling you that that's your only option because they know you're young and think you won't know any better.  Go with Connor above me, in trying stretching exercises and creams first.  If neither of those work, then a preputioplasty or frenuloplasty, is a simple solution to your problem which doesn't involve cutting off about 3/5ths of your penis's skin.   Foreskin is where all your pleasurable sensations will come from, so you definitely don't want to cut it off. Plus more girls say that sex with an uncircumcised dude is better than sex with a circumcised penis, it assists in intercourse much better sealing the juices inside the vagina instead of drawing them out as a circumcised penis does.  In a preputioplasty, they'll just make a small incision in your foreskin then sew it back together, you lose nothing in the process, they just make your foreskin looser so it can glide and retract properly.  In a frenuloplasty, they extend the frenulum so it doesn't inhibit retraction by being too short.  You need to insist to your doctor that you want a preputioplasty or frenuloplasty, depending on which is inhibiting the retraction of the foreskin, if he keeps denying that, then find another doctor, one that understands the intact/uncircumcised penis.    The links I have provided will show you what the procedure is, and how to get one. So check up on that, and keep your foreskin, you won't regret it.    -KH|`|a454ee46524abf792eec0686abd82584aa	You should have been advised to stretch it first and given a prescription for a steroid cream (Betamethasone 0.1%) to put a tiny smear just on the tight bits. The cream speeds up the stretching process but won't do anything if you don't stretch.  Here's how to stretch.  http://xsorbit28.com/users5/foreskinforu...  If it's a tight frenulum a frenuloplasty is an option but only after you try stretching. A frenuloplasty legthens the frenulum with a z-shaped cut, without removing any of the highly sensitive tissue. Removing the frenulum is not a good option as it is one of the most sensitive parts of your penis. Circumcision should be avoided and is almost never really necessary.  Adult males lose 15 square inches (40 square centimetres) of skin in circumcision, over half the skin of your penis. You lose the gliding action as it slides on itself during masturbation and sex. You will suffer bruising, perhaps some bleeding, and the swelling from the disruption to the lymph system goes on for up to six months. Removing the foreskin turns the surface of the glans from an inner mucosal membrane to outside skin. Newly circumcised adults usually go through some weeks of intense discomfort as the glans is constantly exposed to rubbing on clothing, until it develops a thicker keratin layer and becomes less sensitive. You must abstain from ALL sexual activity for an average of six weeks. Some men like the final result but others complain of loss of sensation and miss being able to slide their foreskin over the glans. Circumcised guys often have little or no movable skin left and are forced to masturbate using lube or rubbing dry, without the loose skin. There is no going back if you dont like the result.  A recent study has shown real differences in fine touch sensitivity between circumcised and intact penises and that the most sensitive parts of the intact penis are those that would be removed by circumcision.  Don't let them do this to you. Some US doctors only offer surgery as treatment for any small foreskin problem. It means nothing that they told you it would be that way for life if you don't have some sort of surgery. Other options should be tried first. If you need a referral to a foreskin friendly doctor NOCIRC http://www.nocirc.org/centers/ or Doctors Opposing Circumcision http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.o... may be able to help,  Geoff
249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	i. Eat more calories    This involves some calculation. The approximate normal daily caloric requirement for an average male who performs light activity is 2,200; for a female, it is 1,900.You need to eat around 1,000 extra calories per day to gain less than half a kilo a week.    Do the math. Eat larger portions and eat at least five meals a day.    Your actual caloric requirement can differ depending on your height, weight, activity level and your body's metabolic rate.    ii. Make smart choices    For example, choose dairy products, Eat foods with high protein content such as beans, pulses and peas, and foods with high starch content such as potatoes, rice and tapioca.    *  One hour spinning = perfect body    iii. Protein is important    Increase your protein intake. Your body needs a lot of protein to build new muscle. But since most of the calories for weight gain comes from carbohydrates and fats, do not replace them with protein.    iv. Snack a lot    Consume a lot of high-calorie snacks (not junk food) such as cheese sticks, milk shakes, muffins, dried fruits, yoghurt and breakfast bars.    *  healthy Ayurvedic mantras    v. Fluids help too    Drink a lot of fluids that supply nutrients and calories; milk, fresh fruit juices and energy drinks are good examples.    vi. Intensify workouts    Aerobics are great, right? Not for weight gain!    You need to exercise really hard and intensely to gain muscle mass.    *  Is walking better than running?    vii. Weights are the way to go    Focus on free weight exercises (which do not require machinery) that target your large muscle groups. For example, you need dumbells, not fancy gym machines.    Free weights put the most stress on muscles and stimulate the maximum number of muscle fibres.    The best weight training exercises for building muscle mass are free weight exercises like squats, dead lifts, bench presses, barbell rows, pull ups and bar dips.    These exercises are best done under supervision, but they don't need machinery.    viii. Space out your workouts    If you have a high basic metabolic rate -- which means you expend a lot of energy even at rest -- you need short intense workouts instead of long periods of low-stress activity.    *  Are carbs bad for you?    ix. Creatine?    Creatine supplements can help some athletes gain weight. It is not known if it is because it gives them spurts of energy or because it adds water weight.    More research is needed in this area before Creatine becomes that magic pill. Creatine supplements are available at all major health food stores, but do not take it without consulting your doctor.    x. Be consistent    It might take a long time, usually a few months, for the weight to actually show. Some people get frustrated and quit when they fail to see drastic results.    Your body will only responds to a consistent schedule. No weight gain programme will work for you if you are not regular.    Heredity does pay a major role in determining your weight. Effective weight training and a smart diet can help you exceed your genetically predetermined weight.|`|8lx7EWivaa	There are different types of framed people. Even with shorter people. I know a guy who is 5' 4"  at 210lbs. That guys is short and of a stocky frame. You on the other hand are a small framed guy. Gaining good weight is like losing weight in the right way. With losing weight its not healthy to simply starve yourself. But with proper diet and exercise a guy can lose weight easy. Now you can get lazy and eat hamburgers and fries every night right before you go to bed. You'll probably gain weight but not good weight. Judging from your age, and stature you seem to have a good metabolism (ability to burn calories). If you want to gain good weight this is what I would suggest. Get up in the mornings and eat a healthy breakfast, go for a jog after about 30-45 mins. Eat again soon as you get back. At lunch time, if you're still in school, eat only things high in protein ( meat, beans, eggs and milk). Trade off your desserts and veggies for those. After you get home workout, with free weights only, for at least 45 mins. Right after that eat alot of protein filled foods again. Try to get your hands on some type of protein shakes or weight gainer supplement. Drink those after you workout. Lifting weights is vital for guys with higher metabolisms to gain weight.  Not only will you gain good weight but, short or not, you will turn heads. Good luck kid!!|`|iyFceEz3aa	eat some bigmacs and whopers and junkfood and dont excersice|`|OFyW6gtmaa	Fast food wont make you gain weight if you're naturally underweight, it will just make you unhealthy. I am very underweight for my age (19) and all my life i have had trouble gaining weight.. If you're a smoker, quit.. as soon as i did i gained weight. Otherwise, go to a healthfood shop, ask for the best weight gain minerals and they give you this stuff you mix in with milk, kinda like a milkshake.. and it does work.. You just have to take it reguarly.. everyday.    Hope that helped and good luck!

ysfuV4DIaa	As embarassing as it is, I think you need to tell a parent and go to see a gastrointestinal specialist.  They will probably put an endoscope up your bum to check things out and try to find the problem.

I've researched and some of the side effects that have been mentioned include depression, heart disease, hypertension, irritability, slower reaction times, slurred speech, tremors. etc|`|lJKdoEpxaa	Honestly, when I was around that age I never really slept either. I believe it is a hormone thing, or so I've read. Usually when you're younger you have more energy and you're very restless. Unless you drink a lot of soda or eat chocolate a lot, the caffeine could be the case too. I wouldn't worry about it because I never did and eventually grew out of it. Symptoms from not sleeping can vary to aching muscles, headaches, dizziness, hallucinations, and etc.

I would say you could call this chronic, but that is not a bad thing.  Orgasms can be a stress release, and that's why many people do it.  The only time that it would become too much is if you start ditching your friends to go masturbate  Than that would be a little overkill.  But health wise there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  I guess its better than having sex and possibly getting pregnant.  Hope this helps.  And by the way, I researched this.|`|33l3blvsaa	hun therez nothing wrong with that!!!    man all i can say is if you had a man & you sexed him that many times he wont be able 2 keep up;)|`|HPiFrjfCaa	When you first start to do it then it's not weird to do it all the time, but after a while the urge to do it should wear off.

AA11506348	It depends on several factors: age, number of previous sprains, and the degree to which you have sprained it.  A minor sprain at the age of nine, say, would probably recover in a day or two.  I've sprained my ankles (all minor to moderate) many times in my life.  I never used crutches, but I did elevate and ice them.  So, if your ankle is not hurting you and you can apply weight to it (10 days is more than enough time for most minor sprains), then feel free to take a few steps and see how it feels.
2qpzoNGpaa	I would ice it a lot.  From personal experiences i have pulled a few muscles and icing them for a while really helps.  Maybe a few days and it should be fine, but remember to ice a lot and when ur at home just rest it as much as you can.       Hope you feel better and this helped!|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Heating pad and lots of rest.|`|AA11506348	Pulled muscles usually feel better when you stretch them.  I can't recommend any stretches without knowing which muscle you pulled.  It should be back to normal by tomorrow.

A4JLewBRaa	most likely you have edema, which is an accumulation of fluid. Ice is always good to reduce edema, so you could put a bag of ice/frozen vegetables on your knee for 10-15 minutes at a time. Ice will also help with the pain. Use ice after exercising, not before, since that would restrict your movement during activity.   It sounds like you definitely have some issues with your knees. See if you notice any activities that make them feel worse or not as bad, and avoid those that worsen the pain. If the pain and knee locks continue or get worse you could go see a doctor, who could give you some feedback. Have him send you to a physical therapist if he doesn't help much, and the therapist could apply some treatment that could really help your condition.|`|KktkViZ4aa	acupuncture! had my knee messed up, needle yes not painful to me at all|`|dM8EyL6caa	Sounds like fluid build up. Can be very painful, you need to go to a sports medicine doctor and have your knee looked at by a professional and to have it drained. It is very painful but they can give you pain meds and numb it before the procedure. Good Luck!
uwBRwINvaa	Anything sticky or chewy. With the spacers i would stay away from sticky food..like laffy taffy and like bagels and stuff. The spacers feel like you have a piece of meat stuck in your teeth and braces just feel weird until you get used to them. the orthodontist will go over everything that u can and cant eat when you get them on...Good luck also make sure you do everything the DR tells to you to do cuz i had mine on for 5 years and because i was to busy playing outside and having a good time my teeth still don't look right. GOOD LUCK|`|cOZOnQOUaa	popcorn|`|MwkR695Gaa	they will give u a list of stuff u cant eat. i would stock up on jello and soup though cause when i first got mine on i couldnt eat anything hard for about a week. also it feels like ur teeth have grown out ward idk its really wierd u get used to them though. the spacers feel like a piece of meat and when choosing ur colors try to avoid yellow and white they stain and make ur teeth look bad. when u choose ur bracets they will give u a choice of silver  gold or clear. GO WITH CLEAR the other ones make u look like u have a grill on. hope i helped good luck|`|2BYTgbSiaa	Stay away from hard or sticky foods.  For a complete list of foods not to eat when you have braces, see this link: http://www.bracesquestions.com/static/br...  When you break things, your treatment can take longer so be careful!
GAQiSiuzaa	Like this:   http://mx.youtube.com/watch?v=DLV6jaZFLr...    I do not believe that there's somethings wrong with you. Everyone is up to the eggs, but there are people more sensitive and others not so much.  For the most sensitive, (2% to 10% of the people), the sensory contamination high levels at which civilization has arrived, are unbearable and the neuronal personal blockade is tremendous, until someone teachs you how to modified the brain.  You need patience and practice.       I am accoustomed to use the silence at night, before sleeping, to put in practice my training-unlearning-mybrain. I can tell how its functioning with me, an im feeling each time better.      Id spend the biggest part of the time learning to breathe. I searched a lot of knowledge of breathing in the internet. And that's was going to be my goal, to manage, to know exactly, what was doing my brain in each moment.  So I began to treet my lungs as if they were a scientific physical exercise experiment, using metronome measuring the inspiration and then more slowly the espiration. In some time later, I began to felt comfortable, and could retrieve the "good form" of respiration in question of seconds.     Thus and all I continued getting angry about llittel things. But observate that if i was breathing correct, my brain functioned well. So the following months my "Main Problem" was "Remembering myself", that when finding me in troubles, I must remember to breath as i had learn. So I passed a time Remembering to remember to breath when troubles,  And now I am in the final steps of the phase, and I begin to Remembering myself to breath...Now Im stronger, I hope it helps you, and excuse my english ... good luck|`|LoKJBLF1aa	hormones.dont worry about it, kid;you and millions of other 14 year-olds feel very similar to yourself.it will pass.|`|axdgDiGMaa	No. you're just pre- preparing yourself for the real world. take some time out and be a kid, cos it only happens once and if you miss doing stuff  with your friends now, you're gonna regret it and want it back later.|`|ukIxLr07aa	I don't think theres anything at all wrong with u.

OQIP89zuaa	I always wanted braces, until I got them.. lol    No they hurt none at all while getting them on, the wors part is the bad taste of the glue.    They do hurt a lot afterward though, I am not going to lie. It is like and aching pain, really annoying, and the brackets annoy the inside of you mouth because they are not smooth like your teeth. Take some medicine and it will help a little. Don't worry about it though, it isn't as bad as some people say, and pain varies in different people      hope this helped, and be prepared to brush your teeth well everyday after you get them on, under, over, on top, around your brackets, you don't want to get cavities under the brackets!|`|zSo7fvGKaa	there's no big preperation...  and it does not hurt  except afterwardss  u wont be able to eat and chew :/  and thats good you want them! :D  haha but im sure ull be happy when u get them off and have nice straight teeth :)|`|3qBO5A4aaa	Wear chapstick before you go in cause your lips will become very dry trust me!

So, u might not be able to chew stuff. I used to have straight teeth, its just that it is buck. that's why i needed them. From what i heard from my dentist, if u have teeth that are in and out or overlap each other it will be more painful. Make sure u really clean ur teeth well after meals, it is vital that u do that. If u dont, u might end up have infected gums. if u really are getting braces ask ur dentist how to clean them. my dentist didnt realli tell me how to clean them and now i have infected gums and im trying to cure them.

fj3sHFfRaa	CORRECT ANSWER: Your metabolism will catch up with you sooner or later. Breakfast is when your body really starts to get active, so if you don't eat breakfast then your body will get only slightly bigger. im not saying, "don't eat because it will make you skinnier." im saying that you need to eat, even if it is just a granola bar or something.

You have a high metabolism enjoy it will it last.|`|aGRJOdR8aa	So what's the problem? Do you want to gain weight or something?  I'm really skinny too. My friends tell me this everyday, to the point that it gets annoying, and I've actually wished I were fat in the past. They say that if it weren't for my wide hips, I would probably look anorexic. I can't really gain weight and I don't exercise and I eat a lot of junkfood. My therapist has said that it's probably because I have a fast metabolism. Maybe you do too. Some people are just born naturally thin; I got it from my mom's side. I suffer from lack of self confidence and low self esteem though, and the most thing I hate about my appearance is my arms. They're like little sticks, so my therapist suggested eating pasta.  You don't seem to have a problem. You're just thin like me. If you still feel like there's something wrong, maybe discuss it with your doctor the next time you see him. It wouldn't hurt to make sure. :)|`|wjvRODjUaa	You probably just have really good metabolism|`|NGk5IrWWaa	omg, eat yor veggies ya scurvy cur!|`|tsj1so8eaa	u think ur skinny but actually..ur fat lol|`|BEYxJ4O0aa	hymm i wish i was skinny my fat *** keep gettin bigger everytime. damnn|`|ENIQAxDhaa	Hereditary maybe?

Good question.    Not everything has to do with the way you eat and sleep or how much exercise you get. Sometimes, it just boils down to the good old GENETICS.    I have a friend who is just the opposite from you. He exercises, eats very healthy, yet he is over 350+ lb.....and he's not tall.    You may need to grow into yourself. You're still young, and my bet is that you wont be like this forever.

Even though they don't always taste pleasant eat fruits and vegetables and eat three normal sized meals a day. Now please don't be offended by this because i really am not trying to but are you anorexic? I had a friend who was and from your description you sound exactly alike. Well you should probably follow the tips above and it might be a good idea to talk to your doctor about nutrition. Ok well i hope I didn't offend you and I hope I helped. ;0)|`|ONooURxIaa	Your problem is how you are eating, and to a certain extent what you aren't eating.  If you don't eat for long periods of time, your body thinks it is starving.  In order to conserve energy, your body wastes muscle and basically destroys your muscle tissues.  When you come home and stuff your belly, your body (still thinking it is starving) tries to conserve as much as possible and stores as much as possible as fat.  Luckily, you are young and your body is burning so many calories that it burns off the fat during the day.  So, the result is you stay skinny because you can't gain muscle, but you have a high metabolism so you don't get pudgy.      Eat more frequently first.  Then try to add add more nutrients by eating fruits and vegetables.  Then find something active that is fun, and do it.  It doesn't have to be a sport; it just needs to involve moving around and being active.|`|5DnMOp1yaa	you must have a fast metabolism.

Your'e only 13 years old you'll gain weight as you get older.It's your genetics, if your family has a history of being skinny then you'll be skinny as well (that goes the same for overweight people)  But if you dislike being skinny then I would suggest that as soon as you leave middle school for high school (the summer right before your freshman year) that you start working out because people are gonna be making fun of your physique (girls don't like skinny guys!)  If you want you could join a sport and start working out. I also suggest this book called "Scrawny To Brawny" it goes in exact details as to why you are skinny and gives you a diet and exercise program to help you gain muscle weight.

Even when you   notice a recent difference in its smell, it is not necessarily an infection. That change may be   linked to a specific moment of your menstrual cycle because the smell of your vagina can vary   depending on the time of the cycle.  Becoming familiar with the healthy smell of your vagina can help you determine when there is   a problem. Changes in vaginal smell occur throughout the menstrual cycle but can also result   from yeast infections, sexually transmitted infections, Trichomoniasis, Bacterial Vaginosis and   some other causes.    Vaginal discharge is clear or milky white when a female is not on her period. During   menstruation, this discharge keeps the vagina clean. Healthy vaginal discharge thickens and   increases when you are sexually stimulated, when you are breastfeeding, or when you ovulate.    The female body has a natural method of cleansing itself and does not need the aid of   douches or scented sprays. The use of scented sprays can irritate the vaginal area and cause   a disturbance in the vaginas pH balance. Cleaning the vagina with unscented soap on a daily   basis is a good hygiene practice. Avoid using scented soaps, bubble baths or sprays and   make sure to pat the vaginal area dry with a clean towel. Scented tampons, sanitary napkins   and toilet tissue are not good to use either. Bacteria grows in wet, warm, and closed areas so   avoid wearing wet clothes or wet bathing suit for an extended period of time.    The most common cause of vaginal odor is bacterial vaginosis, resulting from an overgrowth   of organisms normally present in the vagina. The symptoms include a strong fishy odor, pain,   burning during urination, grey or yellow discharge, itching or vaginal redness. The odor    usually a "fishy" smell  may be more obvious after sexual intercourse. Bacterial vaginosis is   not considered as sexually transmitted infection but it exists at higher rates among women   who are sexually active and who change partners often. Treatment of bacterial vaginosis may   include antibiotics.|`|9feb9dde822ec8fd717c1378b7d61045aa	Your private parts should never smell fishy unless there is something wrong.

WupyR6UEaa	How long have you had your period?  How old are you?  If you have recently started your period, it can take sometimes a year or so to regulate.  If you are older 30-50 you could be going thru pre- menopause.  If you have been under alot of stress, that can also play games with your hormones.  You might want to make an appointment with your Dr. just to make sure you don't have any problems.    Rx Tech|`|W3bcdCymaa	I would say your hormones are outta wack, so just visit your regular Dr. and he/she will probably perscribe you with birthcontrol to regulate you, he/she will also make sure that nothing else is wrong with you like cysts or polups. But I had the same thing and they just gave me Yasmin a low dose hormone birth control... so you don't get any funny side effects or gain weight!|`|nn68oyzdaa	you need to go see your doctor. i've heard of this kind of thing with cysts on the ovaries, but only your doctor can diagnose that.|`|AA11113671	could be your hormones, pregnancy, cysts, etc. just see your gyn to be on the safe side!
Ml3PLvzWaa	Do you feel judged by those who do not know you?  Your problem may be your insecurities and your cares for how others view you.  Your friends accept who you are and do not judge you, so you feel comfortable to share yourself with them. To get more comfortable around strangers, I would recommend you gain confidence in who you are, it is then that you will stop caring about their views. Or if this is a difficult task, you can always try finding out how it is you want to be viewed by people, build knowledge on your "role", and go in with confidence. Say for instance you want to be the jokester of the group, how would one go about that without any jokes.|`|jH8hIB0kaa	This will come as you gain confidence. Listen closely to what others are saying. When you hear them say something positive, tell them that you are in agreement with them. This will make both of you feel good. Stay away from any gossip. As you say positive and complementary things about others, you will learn how and what to say. This will give you confidence. You will then feel comfortable speaking and the shyness will go away over time. Good Luck!|`|nc1whD2Daa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com. There are people there going through situations similar to yours. They are great for advice and encouragement.     The process of Self Reflection has truly changed my life.heres my profile. http://www.letsreflect.com/profile.php?u...     The trick is staying positive and surrounding yourself with positive people. You are capable of great things! I believe in you. Best of luck.|`|LeUjXVy7aa	hm..maybe doing something you've never done before? that will make you more outgoing i guess...playing some sports can raise confidence...idk. doing new things.|`|Es4KWGCuaa	Start with just going to random people and talking to them, when you're around your friends. Maybe people who are off by themselves, at a party, work, something like that.   To make sure it's not just when you're around your friends...when you get comfortable enough to walk up to someone when your friends are near, just try when they're in another part of the building....  Then it will sort of snow-ball.

In your case, that's what you want to achieve so you might give that a try.
CZ1nO9C9aa	No, not all guys can.  People with Asian and/or Native American genes generally have less facial hair.  There are white people who can't grow beards though.  I have relatives who can't, and I also can't, and I'm an adult, and we are all white.|`|68r4mmOnaa	Umm race does not matter that much,  it might but barely. It depends on genes, some people barely shave, from every day to once a week.|`|jxM8FRXHaa	You still should have baby hairs. Try shaving the area once a week so that the baby hairs grow back thicker until it turns into real visible hair.|`|O9RFT8cmaa	um it depends on the person|`|96OGpAVlaa	I think all guys can grow it, yes. But they grow different types. Oh, but I live in Brazil and I have to say that the pure blood Brazilian Indians don't have any facial hair. And I have heard that Asians have less body hair too.  I'm 14 years old and I already have a mustache and some beard in my chin, and it's black. But I don't think this is so important. It's better to don't have something to shave.|`|AA12022261	it probably is|`|zOIgzIy4aa	not every guy can grow whiskers. i wish i could,nt.
dxUSc7g6aa	I'm not sure it has anything to do with the infertility. My husband is infertile and his smells like every other mans' I've been with. And some of them have kids now...    Maybe those men ate similar diets. That's usually the cause for different smelling and tasting ejaculate.
Kl1h5dCaaa	Can I come through the midlife crisis with you???    My Husband is going through one. He thinks he can buy a little 2 door sports car.... I seriously wonder about him.    I think take it in your stride. Greys, that's what hair dye is for. Dye them hot pink, and set a new trend.|`|DvrpBX4saa	Here's a secret...I started getting grays at the age of 10! I now have about 20% of grays on my head full of black hair. I dye my hair every two months. Shhhh!    Lauren, I think that guy who went gray at 9 is my soul mate! Please give me his name.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	Dye it!|`|Jqg7Hvfiaa	My friend had the same problem, same age.  25.  He found out his grandfather had the same problem, it's not because of the age....it's genetic.        Get some gray hair removal product or dye it and cut it once a month still it stops being gray.|`|tjImPvzOaa	Dye them back to their color.|`|reO9Dgmsaa	AGH!!!!!!  I found one this year and flipped out (just turned 26 a few months back).  :(  Just dye it honey, and no one will ever know!  I knew a guy who began going gray at age 9.  SO odd, but it happens sometimes.  *HUGS*      **LOL Lighty!  I would email his info to you except he's a scumbag!  ;)
dfyZf6cWaa	my link has more info on this stuff but i do not mind helping you out on this.    most importantly stay away from high fructose corn syrup as best as you can one important reason is because it keeps you hungry and always craving for things, second anything labeled 'light,lite' or 'diet' reason why because they replace it with a pesticide aka aspartame which can cause really serious frequent headaches aka splenda.      best thing try to eat organic and whole foods any processed really isnt good and its pretty much fake food, real food tastes so much better =].    more chicken and tuna and the awesome steamed veggies (but go for the kind where u do this on the stove instead of microwave, the Mw kills nutrients you need) yes this is a big list and you do not need to make drastic sacrifices but these are options to gradually get into.    greatest drink of all water and lots of it, like purified, if juice get organic or make it yourself or just eat fruit =] hope this helped, o yea at least 20 mins of cardio, and try to get in some interval training, cause good nutrition+being active=weight loss and gaining muscle and being toned.     if walking, walk outside for an hour a day, youll shed like crazy|`|BZMD5jEuaa	An easy 15-20 pound is by drinking more water and cutting out pop. Eating healthy.Your diet is the biggest factor in loosing weight at an older age metabolism isnt what it once was. Other than that hitting the gym getting some weight lifting and cardio will help out alot.|`|kVNDuTIYaa	The key for losing weight is easy - consume less food and exercise more often - the problems arise when we in reality try to put that into practice! There are lots of opportunities to fail in the big wide world don't you think?! The one thing that really delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a handful of free trials remaining, it was reported in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I melted away 20 pounds, it really does produce success!|`|S4qLj0CCaa	ok you would have to eat all healthy  eat   tuna  wheat bread  rice  fruits  vegitables  salad  tomatoes  and you should do a lot of cardio workouts do this around every day 30 -60 min every day and eat healthy no fat foods no sugar.  when picking out foods look out for total fat make sure their is under 1 percent and watch out for the calories and sugars.
n6zqu8gKaa	yes it is normal and that was not a gross question|`|bIaywrBCaa	It is normal unless there is a large amount of hair. Thankfully I have light hairs you can barely see and very few of those.|`|D79fcdPWaa	don't worry that is totally normal some girls are a little bit more hairy than others|`|79677842fc75f4c703b1a6bba9de5d48aa	dont worry. your not gross and you dont have a horomone imbalance. it perfectly normal|`|e7307c17e7293ec6e48fd95beeea15abaa	You and your question is NOT gross. Nipple hair on guys and girls is normal. Some have more than others. Just pluck it out. You are OK.|`|gZn622dEaa	Don't worry it's natural.You can always try shaving it.=)|`|CdfqJyYCaa	idiocy is a worse thing then a few hairs|`|TTsVhHq4aa	it's perfectly normal. don't be grossed out or alarmed.|`|TurlSdfZaa	omg i hav the same problem and was wondering the same thing so i kno how its freaky|`|S5AQEsxjaa	urr finee.  jus shave them.|`|mQDWD0yYaa	my gf has some hair, its fine. you ok. as long as its not like supper hairy, then start worrying.    but just pluck em, thats what my gf does. it not unattractive or anything|`|JmsnX0lSaa	i would like to say that sis normal, and be nice. But gross! FREAK!!!!!!!!|`|hmAVpz5qaa	it is normal you can use a little facial bleach to conceal but only leave it on for like 45 secs no more and DO NOT CUT OR SHAVE IT|`|T3sAhZ7oaa	No, some is normal. LOL Even though it is embarrassing.
36Ps6EO7aa	Well the one bad thing about excessive masturbating is that you can get so use to the feel of your own hand and yourself to achieve orgasm, it can become very difficult for women to get you off when you finally start having sex.  This is a common problem for men who masturbate too much.  Add a little anxiety and nerves to the mix and it can really be hard.  So if I were you just use some reasonable self control and wait until you have a woman's mouth, hand, and vagina to help you achieve orgasm.  There have been cases of men who almost cannot come from another person except themselves.  I just read a post on here about a woman complaining about her boyfriend.  her one comment is he can't get off with her, yet he can use his hand and achieve orgasm in minutes.|`|deYDbVDSaa	First, you won't last two weeks before you masturbate again. Also, your body constantly produces sperm and semen, you will not run out. To look at it a different way, when have you heard that someone ate so much they ran out of spit?
qT8DXfguaa	Honey, your period can very well happen once a month even if she just started. It sounds like you already experienced your first period in November without cramps, which are so common, they are almost a given in every period. Then again, there are some lucky women who never experience camps. What you had two days ago ALSO sounds like your period. Don't worry. Strange colors like black, brown, pink, and awful smells are totally common. The fact that you were getting mad for no reason and that you felt like you were about to cry are common symptoms of PMS. Totally NORMAL! Your hormones are slightly out of whack, but otherwise, you are yourself! If you feel comfortable enough, talk to your MOM, hon! She could probably make you feel better. If not your mom, at least a school nurse or an older woman you feel comfortable talking with. This stuff is personal, and a woman's first period is not something she should have to go through by herself.  Otherwise, welcome to the club, girl!|`|bIaywrBCaa	It can be sporadic at first. You are probably having a period now. Talk to your mom about it and go with her to buy your supplies. I was 11 when I had my first one and bought my first bra.|`|uHCIxJmqaa	most likey it was or ur body getting ready to start it!!! goodluck in for long long time of inconvience lol.|`|OzysopqGaa	Yes, you are having your period.    It sucks you got it so early.|`|y8mRKy2vaa	Well sweetheart it sounds like a period you should tell your mom and let her help you good luck|`|f109woUbaa	Brown? Possibly.  It's possible you may get your period soon...Or it is your period. I just got my period a year ago. You're ovulating possibly?|`|onCRgkOXaa	yes it does sound like your first period talk to your mom itll be okay. some pads will do the trick. sweetie its ok.|`|7GiO4wqCaa	yes thast your period|`|xAdOhtaoaa	your about to get it for sure ! good luck on becoming a woman !|`|Y6IuB97haa	the dark brown stuff was probably your period - i pretty much did the exact same thing you did, but my mom did laundry and noticed and said something    what i would do though, is talk to your mom or someone you know and can talk to about something like this, i think its kind of odd that there was such a gap between them    if it was your period, your stomach hurting was cramps and the frustration could be pms    but pretty much, talk to someone who is there with you and see what they think, i would imagine the one in november was your first and this one was your second|`|GqTSa85daa	Yeah, welcome to the joys of being a woman...Not|`|rzsxk6Rzaa	It very well could be, and probably is at your age. Your period can be pretty irregular for the first couple months nad will probably get heavier, get some pads, or tampons, there not so messy, and try ibeprofin (advil) for cramps, or if there really  bad midol works the best. Also the blood sometimes is a dark brown color rather then a bright red.|`|6pUfBBIBaa	yay ur a women.... yep.......i hate PMS though.....|`|EDXh0tk9aa	While a lot of girls are irregular, others have a period month and don't skip any.    Sounds like your period was in Nov.|`|K2rSr7eoaa	Congratulations - you're a true woman now!!    November sounds like your first - the first year can be difficult though because a lot of girls its so irregular like that, eventually you'll get it once a month though and even be able to predict when its going to come... I suggest taking notes so you can have an idea when to expect it (this can prevent embarrassment down the line)  do you have a calender in your room?? you could just put a star on the days it starts and ends.|`|iyhMF4HKaa	Dark brown discharge = ****|`|CZLpTU8iaa	2 days ago! Your a women now! Welcome to the club!|`|TurlSdfZaa	yeah i think it is cause thats wat happened to me|`|pPVgd0n3aa	you would have had one every month since november.i'm 11 also and i started last summer.|`|GxZVZLlHaa	It was your period both times! It's not a one time thing, you get it for almost the rst of your life. It will be irregular for the first year or so, so if you get it then don't for a few months that's normal. My first period was in August and my second wasn't until like January.|`|MKCt93Sfaa	Yep. It was. That was how it was for me when I first got mine. Its stinks at first but you start to get used to it :) Hope this helps :D     (Midol helps if u can't stand the pain any longer)|`|saqpxW6Qaa	2 days ago....cuz if it was the one in noember, u would of had it in december too on the same day...so it was most likely the one 2 days ago!!!!      PS-Nice topic...lol|`|L6dlLJE8aa	It def could be! I would sit down with your mom and tell her wat has been going on and see wat she says but keep an eye to see when it comes and with all the symptoms too yes it could be but ask your mom.|`|zUhYQyUNaa	YEP.|`|iLIUoM3aaa	when you first begin your period its very inconsistent and changes in color and texture ( i know that seems gross).     It is completely normal for it to not come every month and change in duration for the first year (sometimes longer).    Teen Midol really helps with cramps. Hopefully that is all you are experiencing, if  you ever experience pain during urination - that is something different - which you should definitely get checked out.|`|b1Yaz2o2aa	if it was wow u have short period and my first time when i was 10 i have pains for a few days but i didnt think much of it and i woke up one morning with a big blood stain on my underies so idk|`|LCVlq04raa	It sounds to me like the one back in November was actually your first period. And the one in February was another period. You're still young, so your period may not become regular for over a year still. What you're experiencing is normal. You will probably just get these little light periods for a little while that don't last more than a few days. And they probably won't come every 28 days either. They will be very sporadic for a while. But sometime within the next year, it will probably start to become more regular. I know it's frustrating right now, because you never really know when it's coming. So you should just keep some pads on hand all the time just in case. Maybe even put some in your backpack to go to school. That way, you're always prepared.
3SNhXpf0aa	Just set the treadmill at an incline and go for about 45 min. You will burn about 400-500 calories, depending on how fast you go.|`|zddIYf9vaa	first of all, if you havent done this already and have bad knees    you need to drink lots of milk daily and walk for few miles till your legs become stronger. then start jogging when you are good at it, start interval trainning    interval training is  warm up for about 5 mins. Sprint for 1 min, then run for about 3-5 mins then jog for few mins, redo the steps 3-5 times, depending on your stamina. fastest way to get fit, better than jogging for hours and hours.    there are no such thing as losing weight and looking good without excercising, and if there were they are bad for you, so stay away from them. do NOT ever take pills either.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	You  can really get a good workout without running on a treadmill.  The best thing to do is to set a lenght of time you want to walk.  Lets say 30 minutes.  Warm up for a few minutes, then walk as fast as you can for 5 minutes.  then slow down a bit and put up the incline to 2 or 3 for 5 minutes, put it down again and walk faster.  keep repeating.  eventually try and walk most of the time with the incline alternating speeds and incline (work your way up to the highest).  By using the incline and walking at a decent speed you can burn just as many calories as if jogging.  Using the incline really burns fat.  You can also use small 2 or 3 lb weights for a part of your workout, doing different arm exercises.  I do this, its like killing 2 birds with one stone.|`|x1FyqVKLaa	:) I do bodybuilding and often do my cardio after lifting weights and I use the eliptical because it is lower impact.    It depends on what your goal is. I assume you are trying to lose fat or lose weight?    I usually keep my heartrate around 60% of my max...which is good for fat burning. You can find your max using a heart-rate calculator on the internet.|`|WzTY4cmYaa	Hey Emily    I plan on starting using my treadmill from tomorrow like i used to.    I used to get on the treadmill for 30minutes 5 times per week,  & you will notice how toned you become over time - i did    I really dont like doing long periods of  time because it gets so hot so sometimes I'll do 15 mins, have a drink, than do the rest
WgqP4yWNaa	You shouldnt get one from your book bag,usually the germs would be spread by,sexual interactions,just be clean and everything should be fine|`|CBfGXLvKaa	I really dont think so...Usually spread through sexual contact if you were gonna spread it.. Usually germs survive best on warm surfaces and so Im sure your book bag is fine!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	you can spread a yeast infection.  good handwashing doesn't need soap as much as it needs warm water & lotsa friction.  see your doctor for treatment for the infection.|`|rbuBNDJbaa	What is yeast?  Yeast is a fungus scientifically referred to as Candida. The specific type of fungus most commonly responsible for vaginitis is Candida albicans. Yeast is commonly present on normal human skin and in areas of moisture, such as the mouth and vagina. In fact, it is estimated that between 20%-50% of healthy women normally carry yeast in the vaginal area.  http://www.medicinenet.com/yeast_vaginit...
PfE6bg5iaa	ibuprofin would make your blood clot more/faster... so would foods rich in Vit K. You could try more tylenol (don't take more than directed, ibuprofin can do some nasty things to your stomach) or eat some broccoli, might slow the bleeding a little... but you probably won't notice a difference    So, you don't have to worry about bleeding out just yet.. but you can become anemic due to a heavy period. You'll be alright hunny!    You should call your doctor tomorrow and see if they think you should be seen, it's not so serious that you need to go to the hospital tonight    Good luck!|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Take some ibuprofen. That will lessen the blood flow according to my GYN. If you start to feel faint then you should see a doctor. Heavy periods every month can lead to anemia.|`|68fmDJqIaa	You could be hemorrhaging or just have a heavy flow anyways... I'd talk to your mom about it or women who's had it for a while and see what they think.|`|BLQsD0w5aa	That's happened to me before. It was awful! I feel bad for you, but I think you'll be fine unless it stays really heavy for more than a few days.|`|qATc02Zwaa	I would try using tampons . Maybe a regular one the work so well and you feel so clean and you can't feel blood dripping any where   I just started using them you can't feel them at all..|`|XgaBxHkVaa	That is interesting but, I don't think you should get worked up over it. Worrying about will do you now good, it will only put bad thoughts in your head. What i would suggest is to wait and if your still, talk to your mom or a friend.|`|UJFNd1pmaa	holy cow.  thats like some kind of record or something  you should talk to your mom|`|rv5MWaBcaa	jesus christ.  well, if it is your fist time.. then i think it would be okay.. cuz i got alot my first time    but just tell your mom about this okay

sMMKBfQRaa	sounds like it could be sprained/broken as you have difficulty moving it.  I would suggest going to an emergency room to get immediate care, but calling 911 is far from necessary.  This is not a life threatening situation.

zYSL9i7Haa	It can be almost an addictive high to constantly be replying to all of these things...but since it may be getting a little out of hand for you, you might need to take a step back and ask yourself if it is really worth it. Unfortunately, most people who look to pick fights on these groups won't budge with any amount of reasoning. Do you want to waste your time on people's arguments? Consider taking a break from Facebook- stay away from the groups or just deactivate your account for a week.|`|CZ1nO9C9aa	All politicians are butt-kissing lowlifes.  Every election is going to be between two lying idiots.  None of these politicians give a crap about you or me.    Also, don't let political ideologies box you in.  Think for yourself.  You don't have to pick a side on every issue just because the media presents two sides.|`|tJa60S4Taa	stop joining these groups|`|2385b0f95f7a8506cf9464941118514eaa	don't go on facebook? lol.|`|4b644d3e9fa1328649e31b2870d579ccaa	Oh, don't be affected by such kind of discussions.  It's just for the sake of argument.  With that, you will develop your reasoning power.  And who knows, one ot these days, you will become a lawyer and can join any kind of debates.  Just keep abreast of the world's development so you can join in all the topics to be discussed.    If you really want to quit, simply disappear from the group and find a more constructive and healthy hobby that can keep you in good shape.  Take care and GOD BLESS THE CHILD :)

2je6Mhkoaa	I'm pretty hopeless myself.  I feel exactly the way you do - so don't feel alone!    I've overslept by about five hours before.  It sucks, but it's happened.    One thing that helped me was a christmas gift I got a few years ago.  It's called the Sonic Boom! by sharper image.  It's a SUPER loud alarm clock, and it also has a vibrating disc that goes under your pillow, so you can not only hear it, but feel it.  I don't think sharper image carries it anymore, but I did find this one on Amazon:      http://www.amazon.com/Sonic-Alert-SB300-...|`|V4JLwTVyaa	I'm just about as hopeless as you.  I keep my alarm clock on the other side of the room so I have to get up and get out of bed to shut it off.  No smacking it and rolling over to go back to sleep.  But still, sometimes I end up with only minutes to spare.  Fortunately, my work starts at 3 AM and when it's that early in the morning the lights are all green, there's no traffic on the roads, and speed limits become merely guidelines.
fbMdbMIEaa	Nope. A lot of people have that problem.|`|RNHwOLWfaa	It's no different from any other addiction.  Drug addicts don't go to bed without their drug of choice, why should you|`|e50e2aed37e3608ec2d0b15df914d19daa	Yes, it is not normal. You will live a delightful life without hurting yourself by being connected with God Almighty.     God loves you, and you are precious to Him. The Son of God died on the Cross to save us from condemnation, and qualifying us to Heaven.  Just come to Jesus with genuine repentance and faith and you will be saved for eternity.  Heaven is wonderful beyond description and forever without end.  Never miss Heaven for anything of this troubled world. Life on earth is short and uncertain.  Get right with God before it is too late.  Best wishes for happiness and Heaven!

aNlT1NRqaa	First, tell your mother to butt out. Your future is yours to choose.    Now, you seem to be collapsing under the stress of college and maternal griping. You don't need to jump into a relationship, but you do need to socialize. (Wo)Man is a social creature; we can be loaners, but we're better with interactive stimulation. Don't concentrate on love, marriage, kids, or the picket fence. It's not for everyone. I'm sure if you go out with people from class, dorms, local music or art scenes, etc., you may find a guy/girl who feels something similar to what you do.    My uncle married a woman because they had similar interests. I wouldn't do it, but it's worked for them for the last 15 years.    You may end up unmarried, but that's not the worst that could happen. I never planned to marry (didn't avoid it, but didn't look either), but I ended up meeting my wife & we've been happy. I was a loaner when I was 21, 22, 23, 24. My wife tolerates my quirks, so it works.    Now to the being happy with yourself. When you're happy the way you are, you're more open to others and more likely to find the good in someone you might form a relationship with. That relationship may never end up in marriage, just respect, but that's fine. How many people end up in 10+ yr relationships, have 3 kids & never get married?    Do what makes you happy and things will work themselves out.|`|RUKh37e9aa	Relationships are not a necessity. But they help when you feel lonely or when you need someone to talk to. Its good to have someone around sometimes.|`|Cn4wRWueaa	Everyone is different.  In my case, I've had relationships and realized they are not for me.  The majority of the people I know in relationships seem to be unhappy with themselves first and foremost.  They seem insecure to me because they need that other person.  Marriage is a way for the government, lawyers, and many private sectors to make money so they push it on people.  I said the **** with the image of society, dumped my girl, quit school, started a business and roam the earth solo.  Never been happier.  Most of these people will continue to follow this path of the "ideal" way to live and end up sheep like the rest!    BTW...I smoked BUD for 2 years straight, which changed my whole point of view, then quit and I'm on the straight and narrow.  It opens minds my people.|`|uYuaCyKaaa	Well, I honestly didn't read the whole background. I'm a 14-year old Cuban-American, but I know a few stuff here and there. In my opinion, it depends on your personality, social issues, etc. When it comes to relationships, you can't be too general. Someone can be perfectly happy by themselves, but that is a rare case. In life, most of us need to let things out; anger, joy, ideas, views, affections, personality, emotions, and so on. Others are better in keeping them to themselves. Those people are also rarely happy. I've been there, and being surrounded by people that you can relate to and have a good time with is ideal. I'd consider that a relationship. Any mutual passing of ideas and (what stated above). So, relationships are not necessary, but they sure make the world go 'round. For example, if it wasn't for the trading relationships between countries, states, cities, villages, and individual people, we'd be stuck with very little satisfactions and have to, say, eat whatever is in season. A relationship would improve you range of food, and ultimately your own health.|`|xbISxnmfaa	Yes you make some great points. Some people just cant stand to be alone. Nothing is wrong with not wanting to get married and have kids. Yes society does put too much emphasis on love. It also sounds that you have some personal issues, such as your depressed. Your mother is harassing you, you majored in something you hate, you say your going to make a crappy salary.  You need some positivity in your life and to get rid of the negativity. With your major would getting a masters degree help you get a job in something you would like or no?|`|xpiGWrdMaa	Relationships are supposed to help you to grow. Learn about yourself while learning about others.  It is believed man can not be complete without a woman.

In my opinion, the only thing you can really do is wait. I know that sounds like the last thing you want to do, but once your done college, you can explore certain oppurtunities and discover what you REALLY enjoy doing and what you want to do with your life! Don't think of it in the way that we are all going to die, so whats the point! The point is to live our life happy, doing what we want & love, and making a difference in the world or someones life. Yes, I would agree with you, love and relationships seem to be very overated these days, but I am currently in love, and let me tell you it certainly feels great. Being with this person, makes me feel like I matter and makes me feel great about myself. Maybe thats just what you need! But anyway, about your mother, sit her down and tell her how your feeling about it and tell her that you just want to see where things take you and find out yourself. She should understand. My suggestion for you is too look around and take the time to discover what YOU really want in life: what kind of job? what do you like to do? what would you like to do before you die? You only have one life to live so why not enjoy it!

POzCKBzvaa	I think like any drug they can have bad side effects. But they did wonders for me. Completely changed my life.   Sadly I probably wouldn't be here without them.|`|QfTEYT3zaa	There are so many different anti depressants out there for so many different situations.     They've worked for millions with lots of different issues - some people take them for 6 months to get over a bad spell, some people are on them for the rest of their lives.     They also have side effects that are different for everyone. If you're thinking of taking them you need to speak to your doctor. There are other things you can do as well if you're not keen on anti depressants like cognitive behavioral therapy.|`|W2z5dCrmaa	Most antidepressants knock the crap out of your sex drive and sexual performance, making it impossible for many to even have an orgasm. others can't even get it up, which for a young Dude can be more depressing than the issue by which he was first depressed.    The medical and pharmaceutical industry needs to do way more work in dealing with this side effect which seems to have been overlooked in level of significance and not given near enough consideration. Have these two groups with their heads in the clouds and their hand in your wallet lost touch with everyday human reality?    What is one of the most important things in life for a 15 to 30 year old male?    Du!!   Could it be his sex life and feelings??    Way too many Dudes go off of their meds. for this reason and get into instability because they are wanting their sex lives back. It keeps happening over and over with the same Dudes for the same reason.     I think that many of the mental health care crowd wears Lilly white gloves and has forgotten what sex is, or else they are in denial.       Maybe Marry Jane Murphy can give an answer? Check the adds on the right hand side of this page. Haha!    Me! :- )|`|FeIKFNhIaa	Happiness is just a chemical in your brain. The anti-depressants give you that chemical.

You won't necessarily be happier or sadder, just balanced.    The problem is that they can have the exact opposite effect. Most of the time they work great, and someone prescribed anti depressants can feel great. But with every antidepressant there's a chance that it worsens the effects of depression in a person, often making them suicidal. Of course if this happens, you need simply to tell your doctor immediately and stop taking them.|`|WJWW7NXaaa	There's a lot of side effects associated with them. These vary between the different brands. Commonly they have been known to cause nausea, insomnia, anxiety, restlessness, reduced sex drive, dizziness, weight loss or gain, tremors, sweating, sleepiness, fatugie, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation, and headaches    This is a link to a site with a list of the available tablets and associated side effects... http://www.helpguide.org/mental/medicati...    All medicines have a risk of side effects though, its important not to think about what the warning on thebox says because then you'll lok fr these symptoms and imagine they are there.     They do make things worse at first but after the initial bad stage passes they do help.     Depression, as you probably know, is a chemical imbalance in the brain. They work by physiologically correcting this imbalance.|`|P5ZNPyW4aa	A lot of medications affect people differently, so if someone starts taking  the wrong one for their body, it will be bad for them.  However, they can be very helpful and I would recommend them for some people.    The problem is that they're given out like Skittles at a candy store.  Instead of getting pills, most of the time people need to change their environment.  Anti-depressants are taken to balance the chemicals in the brain so people don't feel depressed for no reason.    See, you have people like a family member of mine who is VERY emotional due to a very very bad childhood, and he is so distraught that he does need the pills JUST to function.  (He said if he didn't take the pills, he cried when his kids went to school because he'd miss them too much, or he'd feel REALLY upset for making the TINIEST mistake)    But people who are having bad days every once in a while because work is stressful or they have problems that can be changed, I don't think pills are right for them- a life adjustment would benefit them more and be healthier.|`|AA10136343	I've been taking anti-depressants for years and the only thing that they have done for me is make me sleepy.  Other than that,  I've experienced no help to my problems.|`|FFAUPk9Haa	Anti depressants work differently on each individual. You need to discuss this with your Dr.. Together you can find what works for you. I took ant depressants years ago and they made a world of difference for me. But, again, My Dr. and I discussed this in depth and he prescribed what he felt would work for me. And it did work great. I also have heard horror stories about these medications. Just talk with your Dr.. He knows best.|`|WgR0rZ0Haa	:( + zoloft = :))))))|`|1KeeZNuCaa	Yes, they really can work, but it can be a matter of trying different ones with the help of a doctor, to see which one works for an individual.  Some people have side-effects, others don't.  If you're trying one and you feel worse, go back to the doctor.|`|5HTylrjGaa	Antidepressants work to some extent, depending on what you're trying to treat (anxiety, depression) and what type of depression you're trying to treat (major depression, minor depressive episodes).    The most popular antidepressants (Zoloft, Cymbalta) work by not allowing a certain chemical in the brain to be destroyed or reabsorbed. So because it stays, it can do it's job, which is to make the parts of your brain that keep you happy work.    In some studies, some people have actually become more depressed or sucidal while taking antidepressants. No one knows why this is. It might be because when you take them, you are changing your brain chemistry like I said above, and for some reason in some people that throws their whole system out of whack. Or it might be that these people have untreatable depression that's just getting worse so it makes it seem like it's the antidepressant's fault but really it would have happened either way. More research is being done on this.    However, antidpressants are not a CURE. They only treat the symptoms, and usually not 100%. It's not like taking Tylenol for pain and then it goes away. The best treatment is to use antidepressants and work with a professional to figure out what's causing the depression or anxiety and what to do about it in addition to medication.    Cheers.|`|fwMFJkFJaa	If you get the right ones they work so well and you never want to stop. Now if they are wrong then it will cause all kinds of different problems.|`|6j8d7TZTaa	When you first start they watch you for a few weeks. then you go back and adjust depending on how you feel. they have different kind but sometimes it calls for a combination of them to work.

cjaphGaoaa	lol that's how it is with me. I'm constantly trying to come up with schemes like that lol.     I know this is sort of gross, but if you are a good actress you can pull it off easy.    Say you have a bad stomach ache. then, secretly, get up and get a large bowl and fill it up with 1 or 2 cups of water. put an egg in it and swirl it around so it doesn't look like an egg and add food coloring, chew some chips and spit them out in the bowl and you've got yourself some vomit. you can change the recipe and make it as gross as you want. the chewed food is the best because it really looks real.       this works as long as you can fake the stomach ache. this is great because then you don't really have to barf and stuff.     remember to not get caught making the concotion! that is the most important to do!

JHlS5VDMaa	Prozac does not need to be tapered when discontinued after extended use (>6 weeks).  The only antidepressant in this class (SSRI) that recommends tapering is Paxil. The elimination half life for Prozac is rather long: parent drug for chronic use (3 months is usually considered chronic or extended use) is 4 to 6 days.  The metabolite- what your body breaks the parent drug into, is an average of 9 days.  In other words it will take approx 9 days for half of the blood levels of the drug to be eliminated from your system.  Of course since this medication is metabolized in your liver if you have liver impairment it will take longer for your body to clear the medication.    Many times Buspar can be given concurrently to counter act the sexual dysfunction that can occur with SSRI's.    With out knowing what you have been switched to it is hard to tell how long your new med will take to reach its full therapeutic effect. Most patients are counseled to take the antidepressant for at least 30 days, and in some cases 60- in order to obtain and (more importantly) maintain maximum blood levels- so you may not notice a change in thoughts or moods immediately. What ever you do don't get discouraged, these medications modify the chemistry of the brain by either blocking or by assisting the brain in its use of various chemicals and their receptors- serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine ect.   There are a few antidepressants that cause low incidences of sexual dysfunction: Bupropion (Wellbutrin, Zyban), Nefazodone (Serzone), and Mirtazapine (Remeron).  The tricyclics, like Elavil, also have a low incidence of decreased libido, but they tend to cause greater drowsiness.|`|f43ec9175e6ff594263397529d524231aa	How soon the Prozac is out of your system will depend on how fast you metabolize it.  For some the side effects go away in a few days others it can be a few months.  Most antidepressants take 30 days to be fully effective.|`|mvos4z0Daa	This doctor that abruptly stopped you on prozac to go to another med is an idiot. You really should have tapered down and deald with the sexual dysfunction for a while and you would not have these side effects. You also are risking "brain shocks", a sense feeling like actual electric shocks in your head especially when turning the head, which could be permanent. However, if you've been off the prozac for about a week and aren't having the shocks yet, don't worry about them. The withdrawl effects can last 3 weeks to several months depending on dose, your body chemistry, etc.|`|kKACyAM8aa	I've always been under the impression that as soon as you miss a day the brain has to restart.

To prevent spreading the infection to the good eye or to others, the infected eye should not be touched with the hands.  - It is important to wash hands thoroughly and frequently to prevent spreading.  - Make-up and handkerchiefs should not be shared with an infected person.  - Contact lenses and eye make-up should not be worn until the problem has been resolved.  - Used make-up must be thrown away if the patient has been diagnosed with infectious conjunctivitis.  - Clothes, towels, pillow cases and anything else which may have come in contact with an infected person should be washed.  http://rxinsider.com/monographs/pink_eye...

nkTKIXcBaa	I don't think peanuts themselves can actually "get" salmonella. The reason why the peanut butter in your protein bars was labeled contaminated was because the machine parts, or something else that came into contact with the peanut butter, in the peanut butter factory (those must be an AWESOME place to work) in Georgia had salmonella bacteria hiding out on it. Probably because it wasn't cleaned correctly. The salmonella bacteria then got sealed into the gigantic bags of peanut butter that were shipped to the makers of your protein bars.  So basically, the salmonella bacteria isn't actually in the peanuts, it's just hiding out in the mixture of pureed peanuts and oil and whatever else is in peanut butter.|`|yyHybME0aa	terrorist poisoned our peanut butter products.  so anything with peanuts in it, don't eat it.

If you are deficient in potassium perhaps you need more fruit and vegetables as well as bread, cereals, pasta, rice and nuts.|`|bSqzbDPFaa	have they checked your sodium levels lately. very high sodium levels can cause seizures.|`|SAUrYW0Daa	Speak to your MD & ask if you can be getting twitching, tremors, muscle jerking can be a side affect of the Lyrica.  Has the Lyrica made your seizures worse?  Ask your MD if low potassium affects one's seizure threshhold.    Low potassium usually causes dizziness, nausea, feeling sick.    However, if you find that drinking SmartWater or Gatorade help, use it.  You are also getting other electrolytes in those drinks...sodium & sugar.  You can also try potassium supplements of 99mg.    Since epilepsy is affected by electrical signals in the brain & potassium is part of the electrical system, there may be something to what you say.    Google:  mayo clinic>>drugs>>Lyrica  Have you contacted the Epilepsy Foundation?  They are a really good agency with lots of info & support groups.    As you describe it, it sounds like you have a form of epilepsy.    Sorry.  Take care.|`|Sozc3MyFaa	If you had a potassium problem severe enough to cause seizures, you would have many more of the more common effects of hypokalemia (low potassium) such as heart irregularities & weakness.  It would also not be normal and abnormal within hours of itself.  As far as I know, EMTs do not test the blood for potassium, only glucose.  There is not enough potassium in Smart Water to make that big of a difference either.  This sounds like very recalcitrant epilepsy.

As the right nostril is connected with the Sun, inhaling and exhaling through it will produce heat in the body. Therefore, such pranayam is very useful in winter and monsoon and for diseases like cold, wherein heat is required. Do this ten times or more every day.  Sometimes  headache is also caused by heat where the liver is affected or by overworking of pancreas resulting in migraine. In such a case,  practice moon pranayam: For increasing coolness in the body, close the right nostril, inhale and exhale through left nostril whilst counting 1 to 4/ upto 10 later. The left nostril is connected with the moon. It produces coolness in the body. Therefore, such pranayam is useful in diseases like fever, sunstroke in summer etc wherein coolness is necessary. Do this 10 times or more every day.  For removing excess heat from the body: (a)Take as first thing in the morning 1 teaspoonful of hariki churna( harde powder-powder of terminalia chebula retz )plus 1/2 teaspoon of sugar for 8 to 10 days continuously, then twice a week. This will keep the bowels clean.  (b) Soak powder of 15 black pepper plus 2 teaspoonful of crystal sugar   i 1 1/2 glass of water. Blend them and sip all as first thing in morning for 10 days. After 10 days, add 5 almonds to the blending and drink it for further 10 days. This is very useful even in jaundice, psirosis, sunstroke etc  In case of severe pain, continuous pressure can be given on finger 1 and 2 and thumb with the help of clips or rubber bands which must be removed before the fingers became blue. It has anaesthetic effect: If continued pressure on the points  is applied for more than three minutes, it creates an anaethetic effect on the organ connected with it.  If it continues inspite of all the above treatment, it could be serious. Press on point 3" above the earlobes of both the ears and if it pains it, problem  could be some in the brain.  "May all be interested in helping others: And may all the people be Healthy and Happy."

3b799e3d18df0e460b9a42cf6e25aba5aa	As some have answered, it takes a different amount of time to withdraw from different drugs and it may depend on how long they have used them.    Then, it also depends on whether the person is only in to detox or whether the person is also in to get treatment as this takes longer. Of course, as far as treatment goes, how long of an inpatient treatment a person may get also depends on how long insurance or someone else will agree to pay for.    I'm sorry I have no real answer for you. I hope that something I have written has been helpful.    If your b/f has parents who are involved with him, they might have some idea of how long he will stay in detox.|`|gRsuXxkbaa	detox is normally 24 hrs|`|7NwayX8daa	Hey girlie!

Maybe ur boyfriend is in jail by now.|`|cASB8Sh3aa	Depends on what they were abusing and how much they were abusing.  The more of a drug/alcohol a person uses daily, the longer it can take to detox them.  Typically the harder the drug and the worse the withdrawal, the longer someone will be in.  For example, someone shooting large amounts of heroin daily may be in more time than someone who snorts cocaine daily in moderate amounts.  It is a balance to make sure the person survives the detox procedure since withdrawal can kill.  Typical detox times range from 3 to 8 days.|`|450539d29675dc973b0ec09791ed6c66aa	Normally about 72 hrs but some things can stay in your system longer so it may be longer.

CZ1nO9C9aa	Ketamine is a dissociative drug.  It makes you hallucinate so intensely that you feel like you are physically in some other galaxy.  Your mind and body separate.  You are basically more than schizophrenic while you're on it.  And it's illegal, except when used on animals for surgery ... because that's what it's for.    I've never heard of "Ketamin"    If your headaches don't go away soon, then go see a doctor.  He'll give you some meds.  If they don't work, then he'll refer you to a neurologist who can make sure your head is ok.  If your head isn't okay, he can treat it.  If your head is okay, then there are medicines out there for headaches.
HVuIZP7Raa	If you starve you will loose weight at first but as soon as you eat your body will take the food and put it directly into fat storage because it thinks you will starve it again.|`|rsxXzJDhaa	no i am pretty sure it is not a good idea to fast    you should talk to your doctor    or your parents if you want to     or a school counselor  they could help too|`|hnPgpulzaa	Look. I have fasted before on water for 7 days. Sure, I lost a lot of weight. I lost about 15 pounds in those seven days. But it was the most stupid thing I have ever done! Now my metabolism is so slow anything I gain weight at the drop of a pin. And I gained the weight back almost just as quickly as I lost it. So it will just be a depressing experience that will further mess you up. You just have to eat less and work out more. It's the only way. I'm not some person who googled an atricle about negative effects of fasting, i have experience and I'm telling you you will regret it.|`|EamhENYJaa	I think you should make a modest goal to change your diet just a little, say eat 10% healthier.

We al go through ruff patches in life. I think after reading what you wrote that you are a Christian. If so try talking to God and just ask him about it. It may sound crazy but he will talk to you if you let him, what I mean is dont just ask him things just put on some soft music sit in a comfortable place or lay on your bed and imagen a quite place. For me I use the beach and just picture Jesus there. As for soft music I find piano music works well or things like trickling water and such. I  also have some music that I wrote that I lie kas well just whatever soothes you. But ya its ok if you dont here any thing. Try not to think about al of the things goig wrong and think back to al the good things that have happend.    Now as for the weight thing. Not eating will make you lose wait but not the kind you want to lose. First your body wil start to eat away at your muscle and then after that it moves to your fat reserves. So not eating will be bad for your dancing. May be try running. If you cant or don't like running try walking a couple of miles and work your way up. Doing tons of ab stuff by the way though its good and will strength your abs it wont make you a noticeable amount slimmer. the best way to lose wait is running, swimming, or biking. these all get you into a zone where you burn fat really quickly. You  need to get your heart rate up though in order to really get a good fat burning work out. Ab work outs are good though dont get me wrong i do 8 min abs every morning but without other excersice they dont help a ton. Dancing also burns a lot of calories and fat so that is good. I would not worry that much though 153 is not over weight. Now if you really feel you must cut down on eating I suggest eating 5 small meals a day. This means a small salad at each or somthing this is the best thing for oyur body. 3 normal portioned meals make you over eat at each meal and skipping meals makes you over eat the next time its best to just monitor your self by eating small meals. Hope I helped you some. God bless|`|5cSD8mcZaa	At your age, I was bigger and taller than every other girl in school. I used to wear sweaters to cover up the bulges and never enjoyed a single minute of those years.    Your self-esteem seems to be tied up with your view of food as the enemy, and therefore, if you want to feel better about yourself then you must avoid the enemy. However, food is not your enemy.     Sometimes, we girls beat ourselves up until our insides are black and blue. We insult ourselves. We deny ourselves simple pleasures. We martyr our bodies so that we hope one day we will look at a magazine and say to yourselves--hey! I look like that now! But that day will never come if you stop eating, will it?    I am 100% for the caring friend who loves you so much.|`|4b644d3e9fa1328649e31b2870d579ccaa	Oh, stop crying! If you will continue crying and feel sad, your tender muscles will sag.  Because your emotion is in total wreck.  Why worry?  Life is so beautiful.  Always wear a smile on your face to greet the day full of love, hope and cheers.  Eat fruits and vegetables plus drink 12-15 glasses of water per day.  DO NOT DRINK CARBONATED DRINKS, SPICY, SWEETS, FATTY AND SALTY FOOD.  Try this in 3 months.  Then tell me the wonderful result.  I was very fat 5 years ago.  When I did all those stuff I've mentioned, I lose weight from 75 kilos to 62 kilos in 3 months.  Now, I am on my 4th year and 5 months, maintaining my weight from 56kilos to 58 kilos.    So, do cheer up, kid.  Promise me that you will wear your most beautiful smile everyday, ok?  GOD BLESS THE CHILD :)|`|3aOCjv3qaa	You can't stop crying because you keep worrying about your problem and you are suffering from malnutrition. You need to start eating healthy. If you don't, you'll first lose muscle mass which means you'll look fatter but weigh less.|`|iIdbPkHuaa	It sounds like you are crying because you are upset with your weight.  You know that you can't just stop eating. If you starve your body it will save every calorie you take in as it goes into starvation mode.  You will not lose weight by starving yourself.  Eat healthy & exercise and you will be fine.   Please do not stop eating.  Your friend is looking out for you, you should be thankful you have a good friend like her.  Speaking to your counselor at church is a good idea.  You could also talk with your school counselor, and possibly your parents?|`|e50e2aed37e3608ec2d0b15df914d19daa	Lord Jesus Christ is your best Friend. He will see you through this life till you get to Heaven someday. Just look to Him always if anything bothers you. He is always near and dear to us. He knows all our problems.    God loves you, and you are precious to Him. The Son of God died on the Cross to save us from condemnation, and qualifying us to Heaven.  Just come to Jesus with genuine repentance and faith and you will be saved for eternity.  Heaven is wonderful beyond description and forever without end.  Never miss Heaven for anything of this troubled world. Life on earth is short and uncertain.  Get right with God before it is too late.  Best wishes for happiness and Heaven! (www.spiritlessons.com)

Everybody's body is made different, so what if your not skinny as a stick, your beautiful no matter what. When you stop eating your body freaks out so as soon as you do eat again it retains all the fat because it thinks your not getting enough food and you need fat to survive. So in the end your just making yourself weigh more.|`|dc460f6168bc2ee3d4ab9b2e847777e0aa	you have crazy hormones. and yes, you need help. talk to your parents, councelors, anybody, but reach out for help.  you can not get through this alone.|`|TsSv1PGZaa	Your friend is trying to help you by telling your dance teacher.

Starving provides temporary weight loss, but eventually it will come back with more, even if you eat an apple. That's just how our body works. Try to consume 6 small meals during the day. Like yogurt, fruit, boiled eggs, pretzels, 100 calorie snack packs. I have a weight loss issue too, but I choose to be fat. Cuz if I really wanted to lose it, I would be doing what i am telling  you. But anyway enough about me. Take care of yourself- you only get one body in this world. btw my daughter's name is taylor and she is 10 and a little overweight.

edFyHFRhaa	Lysergic acid diethylamide, LSD, LSD-25, or acid, is a semisynthetic psychedelic drug of the ergoline family. Its unusual psychological effects, which include visuals of colored patterns behind the eyes in the mind, a sense of time distorting, and crawling geometric patterns, have made it one of the most widely known psychedelic drugs.    Methylenedioxymethamphetamine is most commonly known today by the street name Ecstasy. MDMA's (ecstacy's) experiential effects are more consistent than those produced by most psychedelics, and its euphoria appears to be distinct from most stimulants. It is also considered unusual for its tendency to produce a sense of intimacy with others and diminished feelings of fear and anxiety.|`|hiY7CCc7aa	Acid makes you hallucinate  Ecstasy makes you feel on top of the world and your sense are hightened, taste, touch, feel everything feels 100% better|`|lUzQfXM6aa	you use a needle to use acid, and LSD is just a pill.

So my personal advice would be too seek help from anyone who you know has your best interest. One other lesson i want to share, whenevr you get through your depression you will realize that escapism can help to perpetuate your problems in life since it is an escape from life and to grow and to overcome your problems. Seek help from those u know who care about you. and i would advise seeking a therapist and meds. One final note, never feel ashamed for taking meds for an anxiety disorder. It does not make u weak. To deny yourself help is to say ive already given up so never give up, never.

ONooURxIaa	That is the point of creatine.    Here's how it works...    Your body uses ATP to contract your muscles, when it does it becomes ADP.  Creatine binds with Phosphate after digestion to make CP.  ADP  takes the P from CP to become ADP....therefore more creatine means more ATP which means more energy for your muscles which means more reps.    Knock out as many as you can.  That's the point.  Creatine gives you the top of fuel you need to do more powerful pushups where you push up off the ground, called a plyometric pushup.  Try it.

Pain that does not go away is your body's way of telling you something is wrong, you need be seen by a doctor.|`|8376bdc87fccc5f06632449f618f2e8eaa	You could be having kidney, abdominal or cyst issues. You should really go to the doctor to get checked out. I had the cyst issue and it hit me all of a sudden. It was sharp shooting pains in my lower stomach (near my hip bones). I was doubled over and in tears. I went to the ER and they did tests for all of the things I mentioned above, until they figured out it was a cyst.    Like I said, you really should go to the doctor.
nNv4AGh6aa	Does this have anything to do with the question you asked a few weeks ago....    "How bad is the physical pain of becoming a Vampire?  I love vampires and i love twilight and i was wondering how bad the physical pain was of becoming a vampire? like what hurts how bad does it hurt and is as bad as the movies show it is?..."    If you have now turned into a vampire and have discovered how bad the physical pain is by being one, maybe you should get hooked into a Vampire.org  that could help you during this transitional period of your life.|`|IimOXTrwaa	just give more details.    and maybe if it is in ur stomach u just drank too much water     it has happened to me be4|`|TlQW67MFaa	well we need to know where the pain is..  and how it feels..  go see a doctor if you are in that much pain. sorry i wish i could help more you just didnt give enough details
asX2hxFXaa	Eating only 400 calories a day will result in long term damage.  If you do it for one day, it's ok, but you need to get back to about 1500 or so.    One huge glass of really cold water won't do that, but drinking cold water does burn calories (about 50).  Drink 6 per day -- that also helps you flush out fats.
EqJ2adW9aa	in theory yes. but doing both may take longer to get stronger but its worth it. they wont look all bulky. they'll be lean and ripped. much more attractive to the ladies =)|`|oTHGgowsaa	YES. Aerobic activity is counter-productive to building muscle, so you should pick one or the other.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	No you shouldnt stop jogging.  Everyone needs to do cardio wether it is to loose weight or become muscular.  By jogging it will burn off the fat you have on your body and will show your mussels better. If you want to cut down on the jogging and do more weights, you could do 20 minutes of jogging, that would be about 2 miles, at 6mph and work on your speed to run faster and burn more calories???????|`|I6BBptQCaa	Yes, running just burns calories. To put on mass you need to have a surplus of calories. I guess you could keep running if its what you like, but you would just have to eat to make up the calories that you burn. So its basically counter productive unless its something you really like to do, in which case just eat an extra meal after you finish your jog.|`|O1QDrdDoaa	runnin is very nice, but if ya want to step up your muscle mass, i would suggest a pro-hormone builder, helps you add weight and build muscle, you take that for a month and then ease off for a month, i gurantee you'll see results. or if you do wanna go that route, you could do protein shakes, muscle milk and what not, very nice to add lean muscle
AA11375099	It depends on the type of cancer that makes up the tumor.  Some are hormones dependent and some are not.  My wife felt a lump in her breast in December of '07.  She forgot about it and had it checked late June of '08.  So within 6 months it was diagnosed at stage 2B.  Which means that it had grown to 4.78 cm. (about the size of a fifty-cent piece).    The team of doctors that looked at the mammogram thought the tumor was very aggressive.  It was a "triple-negative" tumor and did not depend upon hormones to grow.  So, it grew faster.  Once it gets to a certain size it begins to spread to other parts of the body.  My wife's cancer moved into her lymph nodes.      They found a non-cancerous lump in her other breast.  It had not grown at all.      I hope this helps, it just depends upon the conditions that are there that are ripe for the tumor to grow for example how much sugars does the patient digest?  Tumors love sugar...it speeds up cell division.
BxXlRHn2aa	stack up a few pillows and lay your foot on it with an ice pack.  Put a cloth in between the ice pack and you ankle so it doesn't get too cold.  When you have the time, go out and a wrap.

Do not put weight on it and you may want crutches      hope you feel better!|`|mDILmAXqaa	pain pills|`|4Gt3ZVqsaa	Take pain killers and buy a support brace or a wrap and wait for it to heal.|`|xpgzFRX1aa	pop some pain killers bro. like the heavy duty ones you need a prescription for. plus itd be realy fun|`|AA11211411	doctor or go to the ER before u make it worse|`|fbMdbMIEaa	Ice and elevate.

If you knew that something hurt anywhere on your body and you thought even the slightest bit that it would get worse, then you really should've stopped playing. Unless your're stupid, you would've have stopped and put ice on it and see how it did, then it would've made it sooo much better, that you most likely could have made it through the rest of the game. Anyway, I would recommend a doctor. Or, if you don't have time or strength to go, then you could find some way to elevate it, put ice on it at the same time daily for about three days, and try not to put weight on it unless it's an emergency, bathroom, eating, etc.,etc., you get the idea. I hope your leg gets better and that it all works out!|`|KEUuLH3zaa	Ice to stop the swelling, then heat to increase blood flow, then go to the doctor and get an x-ray and anti inflammatory pills. Stay off it as long as your doctor recommends, ankles can become recurring problems if not taken care of properly.|`|bJ61uKFEaa	Go to the doctor and get a little cast for it!!    put ice it until you get there!|`|9bQaSCngaa	cut it off|`|H0LfFGmlaa	If you can bend it or have a rolling motion with it isn't broken. Elevate it, don't walk on it, and put ice on it to get swelling done.

Later use heat.  An ankle brace is good too.  In the future, have more respect for your body.

(11801185) was a conflict between the Taira and Minamoto clans and in late-Heian period Japan. It resulted in the fall of the Taira clan and establishment of the Kamakura shogunate under Minamoto Yoritomo in 1192.    The name "Genpei" (pronounced and sometimes romanised as Gempei) comes from alternate readings of the kanji 'Minamoto' () and 'Taira' (). The conflict is also known in Japanese as the Jish-Juei War (, Jish-Juei no ran?),[1][2] after the two eras between which it took place.    It began with Minamoto support for a different candidate to take the throne, in conflict with the Taira's nomination. The ensuing Battle of Uji took place just outside Kyoto, starting a five-year long war, concluding with a decisive Minamoto victory in the naval Battle of Dan-no-ura.
n6zqu8gKaa	it is not going to be regular for the next 2 or 3 years so you might not get it in like another month.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	It takes a year or two to become regular. So you will have light or heavy periods. You might skip months too.

CNW6eAjoaa	Follow the information in the links I have posted.  They deal specifically with stretching your foreskin.  Yes, you can tear your skin and you should avoid this at all costs.  If you stretch and there is pain, stop stretching.  There should be no pain at all in these stretches.  This is also a time thing, so if you think you can speed it up by overstretching, you will do more damage than good.  Overstretching can cause micro tears in the opening which heal over with non elastic scar tissue.  This just makes the problem worse.  If you choose, you can go to a doctor and ask for steroid cream made just for this purpose.  It helps to loosen the frenar band which is the closure at the end.  Do not even let the doctor breathe the word circumcision.  Be very firm about this and tell them it is not an option.  The last thing you need is to have your skin cut off by some hack with a medical degree.  You can also do these stretches before you go to sleep at night, and before you get up in the morning.  You should see results in two weeks and full success in 3-4 months.  Do not try to rush it.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Dont' force it and it's unlikely to rip or tear. Pull it back gradually each day. Here's a helpful link: http://circresearch.googlepages.com/tigh...    Harriet|`|i6RlYFo7aa	only the frenulum can tear    i told you to look up stretching excercises and see your doctor so he can prescribe you a steroid cream to fix this minor problem|`|s9deNhXLaa	Ripping is a possibility, if it rips then you will have a circumcised penis.|`|68r4mmOnaa	If it tears, you might be in some trouble. Never stretch it. It might be a possibility but I hope not, it would probably lead to over stretched and lots of pain.|`|TGjM9F9Waa	At first it may feel tight, or like it might tear. It wont. Human skin is extremely malleable and can be stretched to incredible proportions. just keep...uh...practicing and it will feel more natural.
WupyR6UEaa	I would think that you conceived on September 8th, but there isn't that much difference between the dates, it could be either.  It all depends on when we ovulate, and each person is different on that also.  I knew when I got pregnant because my husband went hunting for 2 weeks, and I got the test results when he was gone.  Congratulations on your new miracle!  Hope all goes well with the delivery.    Rx Tech|`|GR07LyyTaa	take the first day that you started your last period and count 15days.. that'll give you a good idea. thats what the dr's did for me.|`|43610f61e745e21fe38388296de975f9aa	No one can really tell you the 'exact' date you concieved... or be certain when the babys gonna come. Doctors make educated guesses on the information you give them. The only way an ultrasound is off is usually if you're measuring bigger or smaller than what most women do at that stage in their pregnancy... If it really bothers you then ask your doctor. Ps... If the 8th was the last time you had sex then id say thats when you concieved. If you didnt have sex after that then it seems impossible that you concieved.

e60910afcb632aae09c5ff7f00635a4aaa	Usually itchy teeth is related to inflammation in the periodontal ligament.  You can try rinsing with warm salt water and taking ibuprofen (if you are not allergic and you can tolerate it) 800 mg (4 tabs Advil) every 8 hours. This dosing helps to reduce inflammation|`|idBqkqUSaa	Your teeth cant be itchy. LOL???  Only your gums. Try rinsing with warn water. and dont drink anything hot, with anything cold.

Most people are petrified of leaving home.  This is natural and once you're there I believe that you will find that you worried for nothing.    Remember people are great every where you go, just depends on your attitude.   If you need warn your roommates, in a joking way, of your problem.   Most likely they won't care and like you regardless     Have Fun in College  Louse|`|cV22kVBUaa	You can pass gas while you walk. Little by little.  As the constipation, try to get as much fiber so it will go easier.  If you have to urinate, go when there is less likely students going to the bathroom or you can go to the toilet seat to pee where there are walls surrounding you. You don't have to pee in the stalls.|`|QbOYIixuaa	You are a human. Yes, it is uncomfortable to pass gas or poop knowing someone might notice. You share a public bathroom in college, trust me, other girls are just as concerned. Just try to pass gas alone. And as for pooping, girl, your body can't help it. Do it quick, spray, and get outta there. It's life, lol.
uSk1IS0iaa	healthplans.my-age.net - here is my health insurance plan. As I remember they can provide such a service.|`|USoqyjaAaa	Unless she can get coverage through a job, she could look for a less-expensive high-deductible plan.  I'm sorry that she ended up in this situation.  Does she have a job or any job skills?   Any money set aside for an emergency?  No life insurance?  I would encourage anyone whose family could face this situation to buy life insurance now!  Term life insurance is dirt cheap and could have prevented this.     The other place she could try is free clinics if your community has any.  There is also a program called the Breast and Cervical Cancer Program that she may qualify for.  It provides pap tests and mammograms with followup of any abnormal findings.  Call your local health department for a referral.

pwr5thrFaa	I suggest that you put on a pair of latex gloves again, and lube up the index finger on your dominant hand, and gently examine your rectum once again. Gently try and scoop out your rectum whilst gently massaging the area at the same time.  This may help stimulate your muscles to evacuate your bowels.    Failing that, I'd suggest using a suppository to empty your bowels, they aren't difficult to use, once again wearing latex gloves, lube up your glove and anus as well as the end of the suppository and gently insert it.  Then just sit on the toilet and wait for it to do its job.    I'd definately also be seeing a doctor asap, as there may be something else wrong.|`|oHSzktF4aa	Do the rubber glove thing again.|`|gZn622dEaa	oh man that sounds bad.I think your constipated It's best for you to go to the doctor for a solution and I think it best for you to go before something bad happens.=/

MpTZjdLJaa	relieves stress   and u get some good exercise|`|4zQEvzCsaa	There are many!  1: 30 minutes of sex burns the same amount of kilojoules as 15 minutes on the treadmill.  2: If you have sex 3 times a week for a year, 6 Big Macs can be erased from your record.  3: Sex increases a womans' level of oestrogen which, in turn, makes our skin more supple and hair shinier. In essence, it's like a very effective anti-aging cream.  4: It lessens a mans chance of developing prostate cancer. Studies link the amount of times a man ejaculates with a decrease in incidence of prostate cancer.  5: It's like a happy drug. Studies have found that someone who has sex regularly is less likely to be depressed.  6: It lessens a womans' chance of developing endometriosis. A regular climax for a woman clears out all the germs and bacteria which would otherwise cling to her fallopian tubes, causing endometriosis.  7: During sex, the body releases endorpins which act as a temporary painkiller for all things sore. Experts say regular sex boosts your immune system leaving you less attractive to germs and bugs.

Years ago I broke the small bone that goes from my little finger to my wrist and never had it checked. A month later it was still bothering me to turn my hand a certain way.  When I finally had it checked, I was told it had been broke, but had now healed (improperly) and there was nothing they could do unless they rebroke it.  Today it still bothers me when I turn my hand to some positions.

Yl1eAhamaa	they may help a little. but u need to work on your system for real improvement.  first thing u have to learn is to stop. just in the middle of doing anything stop. just like when we are writing something there is a full stop. then we start writing again. this is what is happening in your mind. you are writing volumes upon volumes of books. but no where there between any sentences is there any full stop.  so stop between doing anything even for a couple of seconds and then continue. slowly you will be able to make longer stops.  this is teaching the system how to take breaks and not run without end.    second close your eyes and look inside you and look for a soft spot it could be anywhere. anywhere you feel softness inside. stomach is usually seems soft but it dont have to physical. it can be a little space that dont feel physical. just a soft or blank area. this spot will be like the letter A of the alphabet in your education about your system. this soft spot or subtleness now compare it to your stiff jaw and neck muscles and your rattled state of mind. it will feel like a little relief compared to all the stiffness. now everyday you have to make this spot bigger and bigger as if blowing air in a baloon. so from a little dot make it the size of a penny then the size of nickle and then a quarter and so on. in time this subtleness with grow in volume and one day it will be at the level of your overblown mind. your mind rite now is like an overblown baloon. so keep making bigger and bigger this baloon of softness and subtleness until you can feel it all the time anywhere doing anything.  once it becomes a part of you just like stress is a part of you then you will feel balanced. and not whacked out like u feel rite now. the softness is lost from your life. just imagine if you were soft like a pillow the stress that hit you wont rebound but will be absorbed in the softness. work on it like a kid.|`|NEC5lNXraa	go and buy some meditation cds. or better yet. go buy "the secret" they have it in a book, cd's and a movie documentary type thing.     if u want to know more info on what that is google "the secret" or "the law of attraction"

This website has some really good information, and there is also a link within the article that has more top information.     There is a good chance of complete recovery with this type of cancer. The responses are variable in terms of how you will react to the therapy. A Hospital stay isn't rare, but it also isn't certain.     If you've handled the treatment well so far there is a good chance you will continue to do so. However, if you do have any side affects that are bad you'll want to be vigilant and take care of them immediately, since your immune system is comprimised to a certain extent.     Good luck

The next thing you will notice is that the face shape will change, boys will get a fuller jaw, women tend to get higher foreheads and longer faces.This continues till about 21 years of age or so.     In your case you might not have had that growth spurt yet. Ask your dad if he can remember when he noticed getting taller. Provided you are eating properly and getting enough excersise, you should have that spurt soon. It has been proven that kids who don't eat properly will not grow to their potential.   So eat healthy, do some excersise, and be patient!|`|vokUdMCsaa	you should tell me your yearly height chart   but this is how it should go    14 5'7  15 5'9  16 5'10 1/2  17 5'10 3/4  20 5'11 1/4    wait 3 months after march thats when you will get your last spurt|`|w9J25hq9aa	You will not stop growing till you are around 18.

jWmnSXlLaa	Your not alone this is a trigger for many people with panic attacks. Are you right in your life with God? I am only saying this because maybe it has been on your mind. If so maybe some of the fear will go away. Sometimes I fear death then other times I am ready to go "home".|`|ParFJxnSaa	Although treatment for panic attacks is shown in section 8, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris (learn, and practice them, anyway) it seems more sensible to use the following technique, to avoid the triggering thought process. But first; examine your belief system, or lack thereof. Even if you maintain no religious beliefs whatsoever; there is another way of perceiving reality, including personal mortality, through the use of Quantum Physics, in which the direct implication is that for every event which occurs in this universe, at a particular time; in other universes, which "split off" from this one, every tiny fraction of a second. So, in other universes, you are already on your deathbed, or long buried, and in others, the "other you's" will continue to live on. Now, all those others are at least very slightly different from you, some very much so, and others unrecognisably different. There are many implications involved  in this, particularly when you "run back the clock", and consider exactly how you came to be here in the first place.     How we evolved from simple, poorly self replicating molecules. We share a common ancestor with not only animals, birds, and fish, but also trees, fungi, and bacteria. This is largely a world of single celled creatures, (prokaryotes) certainly in number, and by weight. They don't die, in the sense that animals do. Their cultures live on. Because of the way our senses work, we tend to feel isolated in our bodies, seperated from the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of others. We therefore consider the end of our own life to be the end of everything, when in fact, it is but the end of one tiny facet of the totality of life on this planet. Because we have evolved from animals, we have inhereted a survival instinct, and to help us through the many dangerous situations which abounded in times long past, our distant ancestors were evolutionarily selected for the massive boost of speed and power created by the release of adrenaline, in the "fight, or flight" response of a panic attack. In a similar manner to the single celled organisms, our culture will live on, too.      Our mind perceives an end to existence, and immediately responds in its built in, primitive way, treating it exactly the same as an attack from a leopard. So, you have two options. One is to do what I have done, and keep on thinking about death, and what it really means, so that eventually your panic reaction is no longer triggered by such thoughts, or to use what follows to avoid considering your inevitable demise. > Doctor Wayne Dwyer once said: "Negative emotions are preceded by negative thoughts". It is important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately.     Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I'm never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even: "I can't do this/will never get over this!", even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that this is being generated from the negative part of your mind. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic".     In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method.|`|F8tQkDPcaa	There are 2 programs out there that are famous for treating Panic Attacks and Anxiety successfully.  They are: Panic Away and The Linden Method.    You may wonder, "Which one is better?" Don't worry, you're not the only one with that question.    The Panic Away program is more appropriate for people who can cope with their Panic Attacks or Anxiety well.

AA10190639	Many of us are looking to lose ten pounds fast, and many diet gurus claim to have the answer. The question is, how much do you want those ten pounds to stay gone? Wouldn't the ideal scenario be to be beach-ready at all times without feeling the need to follow starvation diets that are draining to mind and body both?    There is an answer, and it will seem like such a no-brainer, but so many of us out there have still not applied it in our own lives, that it deserves a mention...    The most important rule in successful weight loss definitely is no starvation! As logical and beneficial as crash-dieting may seem for that 'quick fix,' there are a myriad of reasons why this temporal and exhausting form of weight control is a bad idea.    Say you set a goal: You are looking to lose ten pounds in two weeks time, an absurd goal, but not entirely impossible. Those 14 days you spend taunting yourself by following a hunger diet will make you edgy and low energy. You're also likely to dream and obsess about the foods you are not allowed to eat. Those two weeks will feel like two months and not very fun ones either. It is almost guaranteed that once you wrap up those two weeks of self-torment (pleased with the notable weight loss), you will celebrate this by giving in to the foods you have been denying yourself. After your body has been functioning on a starvation diet for a while, your metabolism will slow down, which means your metabolic rate is lower now, and therefore burns less energy than it did before. Thus, once you start going back to your old diet, this will result in weight gain. The second setback is that during the crash diet you have lost both fat and muscle, but the weight you gain back is all fat.    Haven't we all been there? This is what causes yo-yo dieting. Starve yourself for two weeks and then end the program by 'celebrating' the finish, and finally being able to eat those foods you missed so much. This results in weight gain, leaving you displeased and ready for another dieting spell. The cycle can become endless, and is very unhealthy for both your body and mental health.    But you're dissatisfied with the conventional 1-2 pounds per week in many weight loss programs, right? Aren't we all? Nutritionist Mike Roussell and gym owner Alwyn Cosgrove have put together a powerful, fast and safe fat-burning program to help you lose weight much faster. Its called Warp Speed Fat Loss. Check it out!    Here are some tips to help you get rid of those ten pounds and keep them off:            1. Water, water, water. Drink water throughout the day, every day. A good indication of how much water your body needs is the following simple sum: Divide your weight in pounds by two. The outcome is the amount in ounces of water that your body requires each day. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, aim for 75 ounces of water a day.          lose 10 pounds fastWhy water? Your body is made up out of 60-65 percent water. Water is responsible for transporting important nutrients to the body's cells and transporting the waste out. When you are not drinking enough water, your body tends to save it. This is where water weight comes from, along with high-sodium diets and water retention caused by a woman's menstrual cycle. Basically, to rid yourself of water weight, you will have to drink water! It sounds almost contradictory, but it makes sense when you realize your body is holding onto it because there is a lack of it. You will be surprised how much difference just drinking enough water can make on your weight.          If you do not like the taste (or the lack thereof) of water, you can add slices of lemon or make your own iced tea with nice fruity herbal teas. Celestial Seasonings has all-herbal variations that are great for making iced teas. It is important to have herbal tea, and not regular tea, because regular tea contains ingredients like caffeine (which depletes the body of water).     2.          Eat, eat, eat...that is right, to lose weight successfully and lastingly, you must eat. This comes down to your metabolism. If your body senses you have not eaten anything for eight hours, it will shut down, to protect you from famine, it is your body looking after you. To keep your metabolism up, you must eat regularly, be it three main meals and two small snacks, or six small meals throughout the day. Just let your eating be regular and never go hungry. It will keep your body happy, your metabolism alive, which in its turn, provides the calorie burning. That's why we must be kind to our metabolism and not shut it down.          If you have yo-yo dieted in the past, do not worry. Your metabolism is not a function that will become incapable of revival once it has been shot. You can actually revive it! Here are a couple of important tips on how to wake up that calorie-burning machine:            * Eat breakfast. While it may seem that skipping breakfast is a smart way of eliminating some excess calories from your day,|`|NoT3WGaEaa	Dedication.|`|E2kx5kwjaa	Here is a simple checklist for a realistic weight loss programme.       1.

Include a balanced, low-calorie diet and regular physical activity in the weight loss programme.     4. Avoid slimming teas, drugs and pills except under supervision     5.

It's not really possible. 10 pounds a week is a 35,000 calorie deficit. So that's 5,000 calories you need to burn a DAY plus what you eat. Think about that. That's about 50 miles you have to run every day.     Trust me, go for a more realistic goal, like 1-2 pounds per week. Because it's VERY unlikely that you'll lose 10 pounds in a week. 30 minutes a day won't cut it. Three HUNDRED minutes a day won't cut it.

PAvYZJK2aa	it is actually healthy to masturbate|`|CNW6eAjoaa	It is time to dispel some myths about masturbation so you do no have to live out your early teen years with misinformation and whispered stories.  No, it is not bad to masturbate.  Many forward thinking health groups now admit it is good for you.  They note that it helps to prevent prostate cancer later in life, it increases the health of your reproductive system, it raises your heart rate for a while, and it leaves you with a calm, relaxed, stress free period when it is over.  There are many other benefits as well, and a little bit of reading with reveal these to you.  No, you will not go blind, nor will you get hairy palms, nor will you run out of your supply.  Your body produces semen throughout your whole life.  You can exhaust your daily supply but a night's sleep will replenish you.  Masturbating several times a day at your age is very normal, and everyone does it.  Your body will tell you when it does not want to do it again that day simply by not giving you the urge to do it.  It is a very common practice and everyone does it at some point in their life.  Find a quiet, private place and time where you will not be distrubed.

nNv4AGh6aa	Oh sweetheart, you very well may be starting to show the signs of BiPolar Disorder.  The big clues are the anger, irritability, and the " I can go days feeling much happier and energetic, than crash into this helpless place..."   Nobody wants to be bipolar. But thank goodness it is something that is now managed with much better drugs these days than even 15-20 years ago.   Ask you parents or school nurse, school counselor how you can get a full mental health exam and assessment.   Because if it is the onset of BiPolar disorder, it is much better to get an early diagnosis and treatment; rather than hoping "it will go away"; becuase it usually progresses to make peoples lives much, much worse than where you are at now.  Blessings, and seek the help you need. Please.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	It could be. Let me ask you this - what do you eat? do you use drugs, caffeine or alcohol ? Mood is tied directly to all these things. Make sure you eat every 3 to 4 hours and that it's something healthy. If you use caffeine, slowly stop. If you smoke weed or drink, stop. Make sure you get 15 minutes a day minimum of sun and exercise every day. And remember, you are a teenager and your body is going through major changes. You have tons of hormones messing with your mood all the time. If you continue to feel badly, try taking St. John's Wort, it is an herbal remedy that works well for many and takes the edge off depression and anxiety and mood swings. Take a B50 complex and multivitamin, plus fish oil capsules every day too. These all help with mood stability and depression. I don't think you are bipolar at all. They have many other symptoms that you don't describe that are more serious. So please calm down, take a deep breath, and try these suggestions. And of course talking to someone like a friend helps too.|`|cInZSw2Taa	no your not bipolar. your probably going through a teenage young adult phase it will get better i am bipolar and if you think  you are go to a psychiatrist and see i'm no doctor so don't take my word|`|ABjypA2raa	I would talk to the counslors if I were, they are there to help you. Plus they can help you figure out what is going on with you psychologically/biologically.    Also as a note...you may not realize it but people would be hurt and in pain if you did commit suicide. There are people out there that love you, they may not know what is happening to you but they care so please don't resort to that.|`|RIRa9hUjaa	Discuss your problems with your parents, even if you're legally an adult.  Then seek psychiatric care.  It sounds like you need it.|`|BtDGWKSNaa	bipolar literally means two poles.  you're depressed for awhile, then you're manic for awhile.  if you're experiencing quick and sudden mood changes (within a day) then you may have borderline personality disorder.  but i think you're depressed.  one of the major signs that i see is that you have lost twenty pounds.  if it feels like your throat is closing up if you try to eat, and if you do manage to swallow you puke, then you probably have some mental disorder, usually severe depression.  although, if you may respectfully consider this, you may be histrionic.  i won't go into details, if you're interested look it up.  it's just something to consider.  hope you feel better.|`|75JEN3doaa	sounds like your depressed|`|cV22kVBUaa	Your a teenager. Your feelings are wrapped up into an inconvenient time. It mostly happens to mostly everyone. If you are bipolar you will know because you get mood swings every hour or so. Just try to find something that may calm you down. Example, music. I use to get angry until I listen to music and close my eyes. Or writing. Something that occupies your time. It works.    I hope my advise works for you. Good luck finding your new hobby.

yNvA3Wreaa	You kill a virus by rendering it non-infective.  This just requires damaging it sufficiently--heat, ultraviolet radiation, or many household cleaners will do the trick for most viruses.  Cold viruses can be passed from objects such as doorknobs (objects that collect germs to be picked up by another person like this are called fomites), but the virus will die after a while because the environment outside the body is unfriendly for it.      In your body viruses are "killed" in various ways.  Your body is capable of killing infected cells, and also can produce antibodies that grab onto viruses and hold them for disposal.  Because we've evolved with viruses for millions of years the body has a sophisticated innate immune system that recognizes signs of viral infection and takes steps to destroy viruses, prevent their replication, and prevent them from being passed on to other cells in the body.  It is the innate immune system that defeats diseases such as a cold or the flu.  Your body also produces antibodies (part of the adaptive immune system) against viruses, but these are usually better at preventing reinfection than clearing an existing infection, and reach their peak after the illness is past.|`|nkTKIXcBaa	The only thing that's keeping viruses from being classified a living organism is the fact that they can't reproduce by themselves. Viruses can only reproduce using the mechanisms of other cells that they invade, so if you kill the infected cell, then that "kills" the virus that is now inside it and all the viruses that the cell would have made. After your immune system blasts all the infected cells, the virus is dead. Even though viruses themselves are technically not living, they're still alive (in my opinion) when they have cells that they can invade. The cells would serve as their reproductive mechanism. Take away that reproductive mechanism and they're not alive anymore. Also, take away their ability to invade cells and they're not alive anymore. Either method would "kill" a virus.  At least I think that's how it works. My biology is kinda rusty.    I have no idea about the saliva thing. In fact, I don't even know what part of the saliva would carry the virus. I guess they're suspended in the water? Just don't go rubbing your open wounds on dried saliva and you'll be okay - otherwise there's no point of entry for the viruses in the saliva, even if they're there and still alive.
W3bcdCymaa	It's just discharge it's normal, it's there for the vagina to clean it's self. A women will produce a small amount of lubrication when she is horny... so there could have been more when you went down there. You can touch it it won't hurt you it's toatally normal, if it grosses you out just ask her to wash right b4 you do it again, but it really shouldn't have a taste or anything. If you don't think that was it it could have just been toilet paper from after she wiped her self. Any ways hope this helped!|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	White clumps is usually discharge.

ONooURxIaa	You appear to be on a strict muscle gain program, similar to the regimen of a body builder.  This can be a very intense workout for your body and requires a lot of nutrition and rest/recovery.  Most true body part hypertrophy programs follow a "one body part a day" policy.  In other words, it looks like this:    Monday Chest,   Tuesday Back  Wednesday Hams/Glutes  Thursday Shoulders  Friday Arms  Saturday Quads/Calves  Sunday Abs    You get big by intensely working out one muscle group at a time, feeding it and letting it recovery and coming back bigger.    That is if you want to get big, but it does not make you athletic.  If you want to improve athleticism, you need to do a more blended routine using compound movements that involve training multiple muscle groups together.      As far as soreness, the only scientifically proven remedy is ibuprofen or naproxen sodium (alleve).  These are called NSAIDs and help reduce swelling which is one reason why you are sore.  It takes 2-3 weeks for your body to adapt to the workout regimen before it won't have as much cellular swelling (which causes the pain).  Here's the catch...the swelling mechanism assist in the anabolic aspect of muscle repair.  A study out of U of South Carolina recently showed that anti-inflammatories actually slowed anabolic muscle growth compared to subjects that did not use NSAIDS.    if you need more info, see my profile.|`|zddIYf9vaa	normally about 2-3days|`|AA12218624	it really all depends on just how out of shape you are. it could be a week or two before you start to feel normal again. but you're in luck because this is where glutamine comes into play. it can be taken by itself in a tablet form. it is also found in protein shakes. it is just a protein (that your body also happens to make) so don't worry that it's not natural or anything. glutamine basically helps your muscles heal faster than they normally would which makes you feel less sore and thus able to work out again.. or even move for that matter. oh and do not work out while you are this sore. your muscles are obviously not used to this and unless you want to be out of commission even longer, you need to give them time to heal. however, in the future, you can perform light exercise right after a big work out to help reduce the soreness you will feel afterward.     also, congrats on making such a big life change. your body will thank you.|`|4pofGorlaa	When you first start working out, it is common to get very sore. Soreness (DOMS = delayed onset muscle soreness) is basically the response to 'injury' of the muscle (good) due to eccentric contractions (aka 'negatives').    To help ease the pain, you want to lightly exercise the muscle the day after the intense workout, to at least get some blood flowing in it; this will help ease the pain.    On a side note, I would highly suggest trying to do a full body workout / circuit training instead of only certain muscle groups in a day. This way you allow your body to recover without feeling like you have to go do another workout while being sore.    You should not 'jump right in' with weight lifting. Start with weights that aren't too hard to do, maybe even easy the first couple of times. Your body is not used to the load, even if it can move it. This will help reduce soreness as well.    Edit to Add: Please do not start taking supplements. They are generally either useless/dangerous/costly for no reason. You are not trying to be a professional in anything, and with a healthy and reasonable regimen you shouldn't need any!|`|AA10327722	When I was going to the gym, the trainer said to work your upper body and then the next work your lower body.  The only thing you can work everyday is your abs and cardio of course.  Maybe your trying to do to much to quick.  Try cutting you work out in half and work up from there.  That's one thing that can make you sore.  Another thing is drink water like crazy.  It makes you not as sore.  You will always be a little sore after your workout but it shouldn't be that bad.  Hope this helps.

You have to do something about it so it heals. I'm 13 and have really bad hand tendonitis. Remember RICE---  Rest the affected area and avoid further injury.  Ice the area for at least 10 minutes every two to three hours to decrease pain and swelling.  Compress the area with an elastic bandage or wrap to minimize swelling.  Elevate the area to facilitate fluid drainage from the injured site.    Its been 9 months and mine still hasn't fully healed. Also, it may come back later in life. It sucks, I know. If its really bad get physical therapy. Good luck! =)|`|af2b8cb22a1ed77dda9500aaea60bf51aa	You comment as if "tendinitis" is not a good enough diagnosis. Tendinitis can last a long time and really be a bother. There are things a physical therapist can show you -- get an referral from your doctor. As well, icing often help reduce the inflammation. Use a bag of frozen corn or peas on the tender area. Acetaminophen can also help.     If you are not satisfied with the diagnosis you could get a second opinion and an x-ray.  But try the ice! Making the fist, by the way, immobilizes the joint and immobility helps tendinitis.

fShlKEfYaa	Hospitals will tell patients about hospice care if the patient has a terminal illness and not expected to live for more than a few months. Many patients prefer to stay at home under hospice/doctors care or to continue living in a nursing home so they could continue with regulat activities. Most people would like to remain independent and share the time with loved ones, rather than to enter a hospice where their family and friends are occassional visitors.  Art Buchwald, the writer, had checked himself into a hospice when doctors told him that he needed ongoing kidney dialysis and he has already lost a leg due to the kidney problems. But months later, Mr Buchwald was still alive, so he checked himself out of the hospice and went to his summer home.

Listerine is not alcohol free. crest is though.  ***eat ice and other cold foods to help with swelling. you can also take ibuprofen.

qXTX9jwPaa	There are several variables to answering this question. Just to name an average few:    1. You don't always die from a myocardial infarction/heart attack.  2. The timing of your heart attack maybe a bit slow in comparison to the seconds it take to land from a sky dive.  3. Taken into account that you are both neither extremely heavy or extremely light, it takes 10 seconds for you to cover the first 1000 feet. The speed seems to increase at approx. 6 seconds every 1000 feet there after.  4. Some people start a heart attack with pain that often is prolonged and spreads while others may have no symptoms at all.

zTj6bnIlaa	you'll be ok in a week , flu is not life threatening or that bad for a healthy 14 year old. Don't let this encourage you to have flu vaccinations next year, they don't work and will weaken your bodies natural resistence. In fact never have any jabs ever.|`|AA11388527	It would help if I knew how long you've already been sick to know how long you're likely to be sick.  While you cannot be diagnosed online, it may be flu and there's no cure.  Flu is self-limited, it runs its course then it's over.  Take it easy, move carefully and treat your symptoms.  It generally takes from one to two weeks to recover completely.|`|JINK3IHiaa	Usually 2 weeks.     Depends on the strain, some are mild, some can kill you without treatment.  Impossible, just got to let your body fight it.|`|ibvRasY5aa	go get some shots. i used to have the stomach virus and i hate it haha but iwent to the docotor to get some shots..wel a shot..it was big but worth it, anyways yeah they also said that powerade is really good  for a sick stomach.. i dont no if thats a proble. i bnever had the flu.. ouch hope i help. go to A DOCTOR!|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !    What are common flu symptoms?  Flu symptoms are usually more severe than cold symptoms and come on quickly. Flu symptoms include sore throat, fever, headache, muscle aches and soreness, congestion, and cough. The flu is caused by a variety of influenza viruses.    Most flu symptoms gradually improve over two to five days, but it's not uncommon to feel run down for a week or more. A common complication of the flu is pneumonia, particularly in the young, elderly, or people with lung or heart problems. If you notice shortness of breath, you should let your doctor know. Another common sign of pneumonia is fever that comes back after having been gone for a day or two.    Just like cold viruses, flu viruses enter your body through the mucous membranes of your nose, eyes, or mouth. Every time you touch your hand to one of these areas, you could be infecting yourself with a virus, which makes it very important to keep your hands germ-free with frequent washing to prevent both flu and cold symptoms.|`|ldpDzaolaa	sounds like a bad cold/virus. the cold virus can last up to a week, with days 3 and 4 the worst. You probably have sinus involvement that's why it hurts on the sides and your forehead, I had the sweats/hot/cold too. didn't have diarrhea, but can get it from swallowing all the nasty cough/phlegm. The flu will give a temperature of 101 or more, bad body aches, but you can have a cold virus with them , need to wash hands and face gently, apply neosporin or bacitracin to nose,upper lip, change toothbrush when symptoms gone, get chicken soup and Orange juice, zinc from GNC least expensive and treat symptoms with nyquil at night and dayquil for daytime. It will peak to the worst, then you'll get a good night's sleep and will feel better, for the sore throat, chicken soup and warm salt water gargles. take as much zinc as you want, 100mg or 150 and up the orange juice, try to push fluids as you make a lot of phlegm, so need to replace, try a heating pad if cold, do take a shower or warm bath just to clean up even if you don't feel like it, you will feel better, change pillowcase, keep kleenex by bedside and trash so you don't have to get up. yes, it's miserable, I had it 2 wks ago,thought I was gonna die, would have felt better if I did, too. but, I got better, try to sit outside in sunshine just for a few minutes even if you sweat. I hate the hot/cold sweats, you'll get better. there is no tamiflu antiviral for this one, just have to let immune system take over. put chapstick or neosporin/bacitracin on lips to at night, cause you tend to mouth breath at night.|`|m65xAqdmaa	You'll live!

jnuBYMAiaa	Generally, when you sleep nude the first few times, you're more comfortable mentally with clothes, for the clothes cover you up and without it, you feel exposed, which is typical. Sleep nude a few times in a row so your body can adjust to the mental changing. If after a while you still don't feel comfortable, go back to clothes. There's nothing wrong with sleeping nude and is probably better for airing out your genital area. Your body will adjust to the change eventually. Hope this helps.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Hell yes. Don't worry, your mind will get used to the idea before long.     You can just start with a top on... and take it off once you are comfortable or hot.|`|AA11522944	You should definitely sleep naked.

Possibly would recommend knowing where a good pair of unders are though in case of an emergency. Nothing worse than being rescued by firemen butt naked on the morning news when your house burns down - but totally recommend it!|`|P9hRxZTyaa	you should go with physical comfort on this one.  i use to be the same way years ago  but as you become more comfortable with your own body and sexuality the mental discomfort will subside.|`|ICZJak8taa	lock yr door as good as you can and go 4 it|`|yn9U1WExaa	well if the emotional discomfort is worrying about getting caught then just lock the door and sleep naked but if you cant lock the door or you cant get emotionaly comfortable with it i suggest just sleeping with boxers or something but i think you should be fine as long as you put a blaket on or something|`|8lNWNxmQaa	You know what would be funny, if you chose to sleep nude, and one of your friends or relatives yelled fire outside of your door...|`|ZHJUTlXwaa	I just wear satin boxers to bed.

AA10358331	Uh..eczema can only be cleared up with medicine from the dermatologist. There is no food that can clear it up. If its that bad you should be on some type cream to clear it.       Believe me, I know. I went through several years of bad bad eczema and after several different creams the dermatologists finally found one that cleared up my skin.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Water has nothing to do with it. Foods do not help eczema, they hinder it. What you should be asking is what foods start eczema. It could be the citric class, the veggies like the legumes, it could be the tomato class and everything connected with them. Strawberries, etc.          Your going to have to go down a list and se what makes you break out. One quick way is to see a dermatologist and get a food test. You could take a Benadryl but them you would be able to take any tests for up to ten days.|`|AA11414373	You need to look at what you are putting into your mouth as well as external factors that may be creating the rash and patches, but I have found flax seed oil which is very inexpensive, helpful in reducing itchiness as well as the inflammation.

Cigarette smoking while using the Pill increases the risk of serious adverse effects on the heart and blood vessels. This risk increases if you are a heavy smoker (15 or more cigarettes a day) and with age (especially if you are over 35). Women who use the Pill should not smoke.     Side effects of the Pill are generally not serious. The most common side effects include breast tenderness, nausea, vomiting, and spotting or bleeding between menstrual periods. These side effects often subside within the first 3 months. While more serious side effects occur infrequently, some medical conditions have been associated with Pill use, including:   Blood clots, blockage of blood vessels   Gallbladder disease   Liver tumors (extremely rare)   High blood pressure, which returns to normal when the Pill is stopped     You should not take the Pill if you have or have had blood clots, certain cancers, a history of heart attack or stroke, or are pregnant. Please see the Detailed Patient Package Insert for more information on side effects.      what if I take other medications?    Some drugs may interact with the Pill, making it less effective in preventing pregnancy or increasing the incidence of breakthrough bleeding. This association has been seen with rifampin, drugs used for epilepsy such as barbiturates (for example, phenobarbital) and phenytoin (Dilantin?*), phenylbutazone, and possibly ampicillin and tetracyclines. You may have to use nonhormonal backup contraception, such as condoms, if you are taking certain drugs. Be sure to tell your healthcare provider if you are taking or start taking any other medication, including nonprescription or herbal products.     *Dilantin? is a registered trademark of Pfizer Inc.|`|zKlhfwLKaa	SOLIDARITY.

9rn5qU60aa	shave! wax hurts SOOOO bad, although many say they get used to it. it really all depends on the man too. But shaving is just being clean in general, and allow everything to 'breathe' more. It's just good hygiene in my opinion.     Make sure you use a gooood razor or you'll be scratching yourself 2 days after shaving! or get nasty razor bumps that hurt. personally I would use the Gillete Fusion power razor or a good men's razor, they're always the best at getting the closest and most comfortable shave. I also use Aveeno's shaving cream.    Oh and some days you dont have to shave evvverrything. Just the bottom and leave everything above short and nicely trimmed, like everyone is saying.  just be well groomed no matter if it's clean shaved, or prickly. and yes....another tip... Shave WITH the growth of your hair! not against it. might not be as smooth, but you will get less razor irritation!|`|ZiHcxJv7aa	Ok, yes you should shave down there. Before my husband, i would shave it all, its looks and remains cleaner to me, but now i shave it all except the area above the clit,my hubby prefers it that way, usually shape it differently each time, jsut for fun, a V, heart, initial..  I  dont really like going waxing, cuz its expensive, $50 just bikini area,and you have to do it every 2 weeks at least..|`|VB3ZK5f9aa	It's a cultural preference.  In most places, and at most times, pubic hair has been treated as normal - which it is.  Just because very recently, in our culture, it has become more and more the fashion to have less and less pubic hair, doesn't give anyone the right to call someone "gross".    A girl or woman should be comfortable with her choice.  Literally comfortable!  If a lot of shaving or waxing is uncomfortable, limit it or stop it.    P.S.  Guys are horny.  A "fashion choice" is not going to stop him if he has gotten to the point of seeing "the style".|`|ISNdzRCHaa	Okay, there's no such thing as pubic hair being wrong. HOWEVER, these days, many men prefer shorter hair. I guess some prefer shaven completely, but that's really a personal choice. My boyfriend thinks it's gross, because it reminds him of a young girl, which is not appealing to him. Waxing HURTS. I would not advise it. Although, in my opinion, it's better than shaving, because the results last a lot longer since you get to the root of the hair.    The most middle ground way to go is just to trim it short, and shave the bikini line. Shaving the whole thing is difficult to keep up with. If your blade isn't fresh, it can lead to ingrown hairs, which can become infected. That's painful. The razor burn isn't fun either (no matter which way I shaved and with what razor, I always managed to get this. But I have VERY sensitive skin all together anyway.) Plus, regrowth of the hair happens very quickly, so if you don't want to shave every other day to prevent the prickly hair, I wouldn't shave all the way.    Edited to say: Pubic hair isn't dirty. Actually, it traps pheremones which makes men more attracted to you. That's why you grow it in adolescence when you begin to develop and get increases in estrogen. Also, it keep dirt and particles from entering into the vagina, sort of like the eyelashes of the genitals.|`|W3bcdCymaa	Well it really depends on the guy and what he perfers, But most men like it when a women shaves atleast some of it. When you shave DO NOT shave against the grain shave the way the hair grows or you will get really bad razor burn and ingrown hairs. And you can be creative with it and make differ shapes like  triangle or landingstripes lol! But just to start out just clean it up a little.|`|oJdyBSDHaa	guys love girls that shave or wax. but trust me shaving is less painful. hairy is just gross|`|GH369yrOaa	i prefer to have no hair. it makes me feel like im not clean. But thats just my own personal decision.     I used to shave but then it grows back like everyday and itches and everything. so i get waxed. Depending where you go it can be expensive. I pay $35 each time and go about ever 2 and a half weeks. sometimes 3.(depends on how fast hair grows) It stays smooth and clean. Lasts longer and after you get waxed the first time not all of it grows back. Just like waxing your eyebrows. not all of the hair will grow back. just some of it. So it makes it better than completly hairy.     If you have never been waxed before first time maybe first 2 or 3 times hurts then you get used to it..|`|NG4Z7eZxaa	hmm lets see i think waxing isnt a good idea. lol it hurts and yeah.. but shaving i think you should because it would be kinda nasty for a guy touching you down there and you having hair on it. but still its up to you. my boyfriend doesnt care if i have hair or not. lol =] hope i helpeddd.|`|CpILgVA8aa	Yes, if you have hair down there while ******* a guy he will be disgusted and throw up.  /sarcasm|`|FZEvHQqoaa	hairy or shave i still love the pu-ssy
YuPNVX9maa	Gym time, sweetie! First, get motivated. When you're about to eat a cookie or candy, ask yourself if you would rather just have this cookie and stay the weight you are, or whether you want to change and become thinner. Then go to a gym. I work out about 6 times a week, and i've found that cardio is best for keeping off the weight. Also, try interval training, which just totally melts the pounds off. for eating habits, try substituting candy with a healthier alternative. When I'm hungry, I have a fruit with natural sugar in it, instead of processed sugar. Foods like carrots and celery are filling but have basically no calories or fat. Or try drinking a cup of tea.|`|zLsj2NGmaa	There is a great free resource over at http://www.fastweightlosetoday.com - they have a whole lot of free articles and information where i am sure you can find the answers you are after - check it out.|`|0HOGn7njaa	join a gym! you are young so your parents might be willing to pay to see you get active. also, try a polates or exercise video. although they arent rigorous exercises they are good for the winter if you cant afford a gym membership or home gym.|`|MXWRtJ3Naa	Start doing rocky training.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRFiTwQwc...|`|24b83f678e7655178fc81d2732be81aeaa	Controlling your portions is a very important part of loosing weight and keeping it off. For example, whenever you go somewhere to eat and it offers 2 sides with the meal, only eat one; and if you MUST eat fast food get everything in the smallest size. And even though it may sound painful, giving up soda including diet drinks can help. Drinking things like water or milk are very good!  If you do decide to lower your portions, make sure you're not starving yourself! Eat what you need to eat :)  Another important thing is not to eat anything before you go to sleep. Breakfast should be your biggest meal of the day. This way, you'll be burning off the calories throughout the day. Your dinner should be your smallest meal since you're probably going to sleep and not work any of it off soon afterwords.    I was able to loose about 7 or 8 lbs in a couple weeks by doing at least most of this. And I didn't need to do any extra exercising!
AA10358331	Stress can affect your period, so it is possible that i effected your period like you were saying. If you wanna be really sure that you aren't pregnant, go to the doctor and get a blood pregnancy test done. Its a lot more accurate than a urine  pregnancy test.|`|k9LRu2blaa	if you had sex a week before your period, you may not have conceived until up to a week after that i believe is the time frame. and then a few more days for it to implant and the hormones to start producing. I'd wait 2 more weeks and test again.   although if you are really stressed, the missed period could just be a result of that. I know in the past when I've been overly stressed about school or other things, I've been either late or completely missed a period. Also you can fool your body into thinking it's pregnant and you'll get all sorts of symptoms that make you think you're pregnant if you stress about it too much. :) I've done that to myself too lol. Just try to stay calm the best you can and relax.

I don't have any issues with swallowing pills but noticed that the pills are 2-part capsules that easily pull apart so I'm guessing you could do that.

s2P3OWFtaa	Jumping rope is one of the best and most effective ways to burn fat/burn calories. They say 30 minutes of jumping rope (continously at a decent pace, both feet at once) can be equivalent to an hour of high-impact aerobics. This is supposedly about 500 calories for the half hour, depending on your weight, height, etc. I got up to 20 minutes of jumping rope during my hour-long workout regimen a few years ago and was in the best shape of my life.    Unfotunately, thought still in shape I don't have the indoor facility to jump rope anymore. And it is winter outside. But seriously, GREAT cardio workout. And 30 minutes without stopping takes awesome stamina. You are probably in great shape already and don't need to worry.

How tall are you and how much do you weigh? Your exercise routine is outstanding and you shouldn't do more. The only thing I see missing from your diet is protein. Do you take vitamin supplements or eat any sort of protein? Make sure you are getting at least 1200 calories of food a day at a minimum because if you don't, your body will go into self-preservation mood and that can actually make you gain weight. It does that by clinging to the foods/calories you actually do eat. Plus if you don't eat enough it messes with your metabolism.    My bet is you're too sensitive and over critical of your weight. I say this because I'm too. In everybody's eyes I'm not big in the least. But I'm my own harshest critic. At 15, please don't make this your top priority. You are healthy if you are eating a well-balanced, sensible diet and exercising on a regular basis. That is all you can do. Keep it that way. I'm sure you already look great.|`|pxjoEdL5aa	check it out with doctor.|`|JoBXcKwFaa	stop eating after 5 or 6 if worked fr me lost 3 lbs in 18 days

The crown of this tooth was forming about age 4 and may have been affected by a high fever or medications taken at the time.  This is a fairly common thing.  It's best to have it checked since malformed teeth can be more at risk for decay.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	continue to brush & floss and follow up with the dentist.
TZnoOezlaa	Every time I get a cold I get wicked heartburn that feels like my stomach and esophagus are on fire, mostly at night when I'm asleep or trying to sleep. The only thing that helps is a half a teaspoon of baking soda in a quarter cup of water. It tasted horrible but ten minutes later I'm fine again. I rarely get heartburn except for when I have a cold. Good Luck  p.s.This will make you burp a lot and rid the air from your stomach that wouldn't leave any other way.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	go to the ER.|`|ldpDzaolaa	because of the pressure in your chest from coughing, you  probably do have heart burn, try some tums or antacids while you have the cough. you might have it without the cold, so keep in check after cold is gone. everything seems worse when you have a cold.|`|fCrR8T3Zaa	All of that coughing can strain muscles and push the acid from your stomach up into your esophagus giving you heart burn.

rbuBNDJbaa	Marburg / Ebola  These two viruses are part of a group of viruses called filoviruses. They are one of the most lethal viruses known. The Marburg virus has a 25% fatality rate and the Ebola virus can have a fatality rate of up to 90%.     The Marburg virus first appeared in the summer of 1967 at a vaccine factory in -you guessed it, Marburg - Germany. Initially, three employees complained of the flu. However, the next day, their condition deteriorated.  http://library.thinkquest.org/23054/prof...  http://staff.vbi.vt.edu/pathport/pathinf...  http://library.thinkquest.org/26802/marb...|`|9MLPWdu4aa	check the cdc's website - and do a search for it.  the cdc has a listing of all outbreaks with numbers of infected/death/survival.    www.cdc.gov
dVJ3F6YFaa	I have nine years experience diagnosing Autism and Asperger's Disorder and I can definitely tell you that they are two different disorders, although they can be very similar.  They are two of the five types of Pervasive Developmental Delays. Two of the differences are in langauge and cognitive, or intellectual, functioning.  People with autism can be higher functioning cognitively or could have cognitive delays.  People with Asperger's disorder do not have any significant cognitive delays. Thus, a person who is high functioning cognitively could have either Asperger's or Autism. Another difference is in language, regarding delays or use.  Check out this article http://www.ehow.com/how_4723735_autism-a...      for more detailed information on the features of both and getting a quality evaluation.|`|gqXSzdNeaa	They are closely related. Some people say it depends on the "severity" of the symptoms.  Other people use the terms interchangeably.    Most people use asperger syndrome more commonly than HFA, probably because HFA makes it sound like the person would have no problems -- which is often far from the truth.    check out the links below to learn more about the autism spectrum.
831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	I have damage to my cervical spine also, from arthritis. The arthritis continually eats the vertebrae away and the discs slowly fall out (bulging) and have to be addressed with surgery. There are options if it isn't to bad but don't expect miracles. If the headaches, I also get spasms down my right arm) get to bad I take Re quip for the migraines.      I was put on, at the pain clinic, Cymbalta for long term relief and morphine sulphate for instant relief. I take Darvocet for long term pain relief also. I get upper dermals but the damage is so great ? I would be careful on horseback. don't gallop it'll shake your neck apart and jar you.       At 30, your lucky you didn't get it at a much younger age. Childhood arthritis can be devastating to younger people crippling them for life.
9rn5qU60aa	Yes, antibiotics can cause yeast infections because it kills natural bacteria that helps keep everything tidy! I was taking Ampicillin for acne and had to take probiotics every day, or eat lots of yogurt. It helps. You can buy probiotics from your local grocery store.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	Antibiotics can cause a yeast infection which is what it sounds like you have. Also, stress over being sick and taking antibiotics can cause delayed periods.   The yeast infection can be cleared up by getting Monistat at the pharmacy. Usually a 7 day treatment is recommended but they do have 3 day treatments now also.|`|5XeECI6Faa	The thick white mucus almost cottage cheesy and the itching sound like a yeast infection which you can get from antibiotics.

I would go ask a pharmacist to recommend something.  Most of the time they recommend Monistat 7  (Miconazole 7).  If you would feel better about it, you can call your Dr. and tell them you just got done with a course of antibiotics and see what they recommend.  There is a tablet you can take, but you need an Rx for it.  One way to avoid the yeast infection is to eat yogurt with live active cultures on the label.  If you are on birth control pills and sexually active, antibiotics decrease the effectiveness of the pill and you should use other protection.    With you being ill, it could delay your period.

If you are working out it will be less.  I am really working out now(running and weight training) and have lost 10 lbs and gone down 2 pants sizes.  I have toned up and lost inches than weight.    I would say 3 weeks if you are really working hard to loose would be a pants size.|`|AAaux2Ryaa	I would say about 3-4 weeks to go down a size.|`|TwWuCGUEaa	2 weeks|`|s2P3OWFtaa	That is hard to calculate because every brand/style can be a different size. Unfortunately not all sizes are the same. A size 0 of one brand could be a 4 in another. Don't go by pant size. Go by loss of inches. You could lose an inch or two in a week or so depending on your workout regimen/diet.    I, myself, fluctuate about 5-7 pounds during the year, but still fit in my clothes. I'm petite, 5'1" and a 0-2 size typically. (which by the way doesn't make me anorexically skinny. This is actually the size i'd be at a normal/ideal body weight.) Depending on the fluctuation the clothes might be tighter or looser. but I still fit in the size. I'd go by inches, not dress sizes or weight. Inches is the best and most accurate measurement. That and fat percentage.

AA11450325	HOPEFUL THESE ARE HELPFUL TIPS!!!    Step1 Wash all equipment in soap and water. Rinse with alcohol or antiseptic.     Step2 Put two tbsp. mild household detergent in half-gallon of warm water. Soak foot for ten minutes.     Step3 Cut out a square of 40% salicylic acid plaster, about the size of the wart, and remove backing to expose self-stick surface.     Step4 Apply sticky side directly on wart. Push down and cover with adhesive bandage.     Step5 Keep plaster on wart and keep dry for two days.     Step6 After two days, carefully remove adhesive bandage and plaster. The wart should be whitish.     Step7 Brush wart vigorously with old toothbrush, soap and water for one minute twice a day for two days.     Step8 Expose wart to air as much as possible.     Step9 Talk to a podiatrist about removing the wart with a carbon dioxide laser unit. After the doctor administers a local anesthetic, a focused laser light beam will vaporize your wart. Most insurance companies cover the cost of laser wart removal.     Step10 Ask your foot doctor about debriding your warts with a 30- to 70 percent trichloroacetic acid solution. Debriding often requires five or six treatments. If after the tenth debriding treatment, the wart still comes back, your doctor may consider surgically removing it.|`|aYiVn74saa	use salicylic acid|`|ldpDzaolaa	they can also freeze it off. you can buy same product by Dr.Scholls in Walmart pharmacy department, it will freeze it off and you can do several treatments, just read directions as it will heal as it says in the directions.

bjN4eaqUaa	Here are some tips for you  to handle this skin condition     keep  your skin moist  leave smoking and  alcohol  use herbs  which soften your skin before razor     These are the tips which are authorized by many skin specialist  and mentioned on many psoriasis related sites.|`|pWl7SHjTaa	it may be psoriasis, it i possible to have it in the bikini area (i think that's what you are trying to describe). and it sucks, i have been dealing with eczema for years. call and make an appointment with your doctor or gyno and have them take a look at it and they will probably, if it is psoriasis or eczema, will give a cream to put on that area (it's safe to use on the bikini area, just not down there down there). If you can't go to the doctor, try to use some cetaphil to keep it moisturized, but it doesn't help the itching all that great. sometimes with eczema or other psoriasis disorders, you'll get little bumps from irritation with the dry skin, especially when in a breakout. I have a spot on my arm that broke out so horribly with the bumps that i thought it was ringworm. But your best bet is to contact your doctor because I don't know about using the cream right on the vaginal area, bikini area is ok as far as know though.

Once puberty is over this doesnt work. As far as jelquing goes, I suppose it wont hurt you if you enjoy it, but it isnt likely to increase your size either. Just don't get sucked into paying for pills and other scams. I know it can make someone desparate for a solution, but there really isn't one. I am a person with a penile birth defect that does cause size problems, so I am very familiar with the issue you are facing.     The problem is that the penis is encased in fibrous tissues called the Dartos fascia, and Buck's fascia, and they have very little stretch. Changing the size or shape of those tissues with exercises or herbal pills is  impossible.      The good news is that you are a late bloomer, so it is very likely your growth has not stopped.

Its a rare tumor that forms on young people you brushes their  teeth only once a day, causing the food & sugars stuck on the enamel over night to seep through the gum gradually & going thru the hollow cervices in the jawline. So that will cause the lymph gland to swell up.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	a swollen lymph node???  see your doctor.|`|osoTq2dcaa	they are swollen lymph nodes they get swollen when you get a virus or are sick ... i have what your describing ... see your doctor|`|u70ecVvBaa	it might just be that your glands are swollen. but you should have it checked out just to be safe.|`|AA12025153	99.99% swelled lymph node..  causes : fever, catchinh a cold, flue, even right before your period..plus a handfull of non-lethal diseases..its your immune system fighting off a virus..it will go away soon..anywhere from a few days to a week or 2|`|BJ931YpQaa	This is most likely a swollen lymph node, which sometimes happens when you get sick.  You said that you had a sore throata couple months ago, which could have been Strep, which definately could cause inflamaiton of a lymph node.  But.... its been months.  I would go into a doctor, as this could be serious.  Another option is that they are small cists or fat deposits, which most of the time are harmless.
a4kTbjfeaa	The best person to ask is his doctor. The doctor can give you a better estimate as to how long the recovery will be (remember it is just an estimate). The social worker at the hospital can help you with the paperwork involved. Good luck!
Knz8iJSWaa	Life style changes including quitting cigarette smoking, curtailing alcohol intake, exercising regularly, and consuming a balanced diet with adequate calcium and vitamin D;       Medications that stop bone loss and increase bone strength, such as alendronate (Fosamax), risedronate (Actonel), raloxifene (Evista), ibandronate (Boniva), calcitonin (Calcimar), and zoledronate (Reclast);       Medications that increase bone formation such as teriparatide (Forteo).|`|iqGaNZTtaa	Diet, exercise and biphosphonates (eg.

aNlT1NRqaa	There's nothing as rewarding as beating the living SH** out of some A****LE who really deserves it. The next best thing is taking that frustration out on a defenseless exercise machine (it won't fight back & you won't get arrested - all kinds of new stresses).    Plus, exercise burns calories so you can eat that desert you love (another great stress reliever).|`|KEUuLH3zaa	So much so that you cant explain it, you have to witness for yourself...kinda like the matrix.|`|P8vt2aLhaa	Very important helps work all the stress out and opens the mind.|`|osoTq2dcaa	Extremely important|`|Oe2davbxaa	Helps you relax, perhaps release anger, and it slowly starts to feel good, I recently started working out, and i love the feeling now,    but i seem to get angry often i dont know why,     In normal excercise, YES one of THE BEST stress reliever,|`|MNqwUHypaa	i dunno. i just kick back and slug a few down. then i slug the tall jerk in the next room ever so often. i hated my daddy, too. i just cannot stand the pigs.|`|AA10116612	VERY|`|Y045t8zHaa	It isn't a stress reliever to me lol|`|DhUMjZxtaa	depends on the person.    it does jack sh!t for me.|`|X8V10toxaa	in all seriousness sex is the best stress reliever|`|WJUxHXsAaa	Pretty darn good you get in shape while not thinking lol hahahahaha|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	Personally I've found that it really helps. Swimming seems to me to be a good one because you work all of your muscles. I've always felt more relaxed and less stressed after working out, and especially after swimming.|`|WzYLX0Fmaa	It is very important. When you exercise, your body releases endorphins (powerful, pain-relieving chemicals) that lift your mood and relax you.|`|AtjlmByAaa	Exercise improves the circulation to the point where areas are stressed  and regular exercise will actually develop tiny blood vessels to deliver extra oxygen to the body and remove waste materials.  This helps you to cope with tense and stressful day.|`|mrrVtKGgaa	its really important|`|AB8nUS3uaa	very.. anytime i'm upset or stressed i love to work out because you can work out longer and not feel the burn because your mind is working so hard.. makes me feel a lot better when i'm done..|`|zFZLq3E6aa	Oh Boy...

It will help you sleep better, too -- and that's also a stress-reliever.    It will help to suppress appetite, as well.    Best to exercise daily early in the morning or mid-afternoon, if you can.  Mix the kinds of exercise you get so that you don't get bored with it.  But always be sure to do some cardio stuff at least 3 times a week.|`|iHMu4Jtoaa	Excersise helps the brain release endorphins, which is a chemical in the brain that make humans feel content and happy.  Higher endorphin levels lead to a less mentally stressed person.  Exercise also helps elimate the physical toll stress has on the body, especially for the heart.    If you ever have a downer of a day go work out, your mind will feel better for days.|`|l3rn0xwtaa	Exceptionally important.  Reduces blood pressure, get's your mind off little bothersome things, stimulates your mind, and actually released endorphines that are like a high. Better than drugs, alcohol, or sex.  Arnold Schwarzenegger says so.  Not good to argue with the Governator.
UOZP4Ma5aa	Yes most of them
ub6641d2aa	I also take 20mg of prozac every day along with a mood stabilizer for my bipolar disorder. Prozac has been a miracle drug for me and everyone else that I know has taken it. It stops my anxiety, makes me happy, and i feel as if i am actually not depressed anymore.     I did not tell my boss at work. Just because you are taking those pills does not mean that you cannot perform your job accurately. It does not affect me at work, so I see no need to tell anyone.  Honestly, since there is such a stigma around depression and the drugs to treat it, your boss could respond negatively.     You will definently feel better on Prozac. I sure did, and continue to take it. You will notice a difference in about 4 weeks.    Best of luck!!|`|yDJiiqcsaa	I'd ask about something milder. Did he mention Wellbutrin ?  No matter which medicine he prescribes, I'd only take half of the dosage at first- if that doesn't steady things in a week/two - then I'd take what the real dosage is. They prescribe what is the "average" dosage and some people are more sensitive to drugs and don't need as much.  I only take half of what is prescribed and it is fine.|`|AA11915664	prozac is an older and  pretty safe antidepressant. i have taken it mself for almost 20 years.  don't let the crap out there sway you. as long as you are under a doctor's care and report any changes to him chances are that this will help you feel lots better.   all drugs- even as simple as tylenol and aspirin can have side effects. no one should swallow a pill unless they have educated themselves on the pros and cons. best of luck to you. the depression does need to be treated|`|qC9rN17laa	don't worry to much about taking prozac, however it is important to seek counselling as well,medication alone is not enough.  good luck..    i recommend http://www.onlinecounsellingservice.co.u...  the counselor is kind and insightful,she has supported me with a similar issue
i6QkapaDaa	Hormones chick.  Your menstrual cycle takes a while to settle down sometimes years and noticing patterns will be better if you start to keep short diary of feelings. E.g 3rd jan 09 - head ache, not slept, v.tired, bloated, cranky.  And take this to your family doctor.  Don't get into the habbit of dismissing your concerns about your health.|`|aFSgdIlzaa	Strangely enough.    I get the same symptoms and it usually means my period is about to start again.    Don't worry about it, I mean if you get really worried about it and you still don't start your period in a fortnight or 3 weeks then if your still worried, go get it checked out or have a word with your mum about it.
QK5oaL4oaa	I use to not be able to swallow pills, eventually I got over it, but in the meantime I would suggest using liquid medicines whenever possible.     One time I tried crushing pills into apple sauce, and yes I could physically swallow it but it made the apple sauce taste terrible.     This website has a lot of useful ideas: http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1985....    One of the techniques says to practice with candy. It sounds like a good idea. Pills are weird because its hard to think of them like they're food, but if you can manage to swallow some candy whole you could probably move on to pills. Good luck!|`|ErcsrWtJaa	Crush the pill (if it is tylenol or ibuprofen or midol) put it on a spoon, pour honey onto it of a dolop of jelly. Put it into your mouth and swallow quickly. Take a big drink of water.  If you take it quickly, the pill will just taste like honey or jelly, but if you let it sit for any length of time the pill taste will over come the sweet taste of the honey or jelly.    You can also buy liquid pain relievers.|`|7xc8jgLXaa	ok taking a couple of advil or something to relieve cramps will NOT i repeat WILL NOT turn you into a drug addict...seriously. Just take medicines as directed and you will be fine.    As for swallowing pills, I'll share with you a trick my mom shared with me. If you want to get some practice, buy a bag of m&ms and swallow them whole (individually) with some water. A regular M&M is about the size of a caplet (the circular looking pills) which are what ibuprofen are generally.    good luck =)|`|OPgfyIABaa	Your parents are telling you exactly what you're afraid of: becoming addicted.    Don't worry!! Prescription pills are the ones that can OD. Just stuff like Midol and Ibuprofen are fine. Don't be afraid!! It's no big deal (:|`|RjCLLh6qaa	I have a friend that goes threw the same thing!  drugs that you take for pain they are NOT addictive so don't worry  and you can only over dose if you take more then 6 pills in 4 hours (deepends on the pill) just take one every 3 hours and you will be fine.   If the problem is that you cant swallow it try chewing it i know its grows but eat it with some ice cream  Hope this helps(:|`|zAhwN8ueaa	try crushing it and putting it in jello or pudding :)|`|R42KEhZMaa	i work in a pharmacy and trust me you wont get addicted to minor pain pills that are over the counter..only ones that are controls like vicoden or hydrocodone..etc..    and dont worry about overdosing..jsut follow the instructions on the bottle or box|`|SRmNJCdiaa	In your attempt to take a pill you may want to use something thicker than water.  Try a glass of milk or even a spoonful of ice cream or pudding.  That way you aren't feeling the pill in your mouth which is probably causing you anxiety just feeling it in your mouth.  Place it far back on your tongue and try again.
j4R5JLBAaa	Yeah Pot is a very potent and it's an illegal substance in US. But we should respect each others opinions/habbits as long as they don't affect/harm others in any way.    Many things been said and many opinions exist about legalizing it or not?    As of right now its still an open , undecided question ( some would wish it would be as simple as Yahoo.Answers;) )    For those of you seeking for new spiritual experiences I would recommend a Legal Herbal Smoking of such herbs as Salvia, Kanna, Wild Dagga, etc;)    More info on topic here: http://www.down-the-pipe.com/pages.php?p...

Jime0cdqaa	The worst pain I ever experienced in that area that I think you're describing. It's happened more than once and a couple times it was actually gas and some chewable gas-x solved it. The other time it was constipation and I drank this bottle of colored stuff called like citrosa or something. I'd treat for gas first. Also, try to lay flat and relax, even though that's not what your instinct is. You want to tighten up and roll up but that seems to make it worse over time. Also, try to relax, watch tv, something to stop thinking about it. When your body tenses up it tends to get worse. See how you feel in a few hours. I would try a stomach remedy first. If it starts feeling really bad maybe call your doctor early in the morning or if you feel its an emergency go to the ER.

Personally, I've found physical activity and religion are the two best ones to do.  I've been slacking on both though, and it will depend on the person.  You need to find the right religion or belief for it to work however.  I personally looked through every major religion and completely ignored the media and other people's interpretations, and just read holy texts on my own.  Even if you never follow one, it's a great project for yourself.    For physical activity, I'd go with weight lifting, even if you're a female.  You should also run but running is boring and you need to really have a goal in mind for it.  Competing is a great goal to have.|`|R16F9lPtaa	exercise  walking  and plenty of sex|`|INJSpV4haa	Go for a barefoot walk in a local park or in the woods. Bonus points if it is raining.

I remember that people that piss me off are like slinky's. Not good for much, but when pushed down the stairs they're fun to watch.    Okay, here are some things that help me. Working, whether for fun or profit, getting outside and playing like a kid with my kids, walking and let thoughts just run through my mind, journaling/writing my thoughts and feelings down (good insights that can change the stressors), sharing what has me stressed out with a trusted friend who listens and will offer support based on their own experiences, and certainly meditation.

Aej3lgQZaa	You get 4. They are smaller then your other molars. Between the size of a premolar and a molar. They do not cause sore throats.     I had mine removed because my mouth was too small for them, but I really do wish I had them. I feel it would be nice to be able to chew back there, and because they come in later, they tend to last longer than other teeth. I feel like a bit of an amputee although I never actually had my wisdom teeth. They pulled them when I was just starting to feel them under my gums.     I think dentists are a bit too quick to remove wisdom teeth, so don't get them removed unless you are sure you need to. Keep all the teeth you can!|`|VkXv4RInaa	some people are lucky enough that they don't get any. some people have more than 4. Most people have 4.     I had all 4 of mine taken out at once and although I was nervous and didnt see it necessary, I'm so glad I had it done. There is more room in my mouth now and I get less headaches and jaw aches. I used to have bad TMJ issues with my lower jaw and now that is fixed.    get them taken out|`|g7M1DxFCaa	You get four as said.  They take a long time to grow and can cause your throat to become sore because they make the gums sore right at the back of your mouth.|`|9ydlIWUNaa	everyone has 4 wisdom teeth, and if you get them removed, i'm sure it will be a bit painful for a few days. not sure whether it would cause a sore throat though. might wanna ask a dentist.|`|OTxCCXa5aa	Typically, you get four wisdom teeth, some people get less and occasionally they might get more.

Most people get 4 wisdom teeth.  They don't always have to be removed.  They don't cause sore throats that I am aware of.  Sometimes when teeth are coming in, you can get cold like symptoms.

The meat you eat should come from suppliers, not the wild. There are many processes that the suppliers have to go through to determine what animals are okay to kill, and those are only fish/pig/chicken/cow.    Also, humans who did not grow up eating raw meat will be very sick and likely never get used to the bacteria and worms in the meat.    P.S. your friend has problems.|`|aNlT1NRqaa	Heck no!    Raw meat has too many parasite, bacterial, and viral potentials. Who wants to eat something raw that could have lime disease?
L3j2HrsJaa	To be honest, I tried once several appetite suppressants, some teas for faster metabolism or something, natural pills that claimed wonders, and nothing worked really. Some did work for a couple of days at the beginning, but I think it was more psychological effect on me, like a placebo effect. But then, after a week or so, I always realized it just plainly doesn't work. And I really wanted them to work so badly.   I must say, I didn't try hydroxycut. I just lost my faith in this weight loss pills.  But some people do claim it helped them, so maybe it was just me. I lost my weight with eating less and walking more.   I think just try that pills for yourself, that's the sure way to see if it works or not:)
BJugETlOaa	Yes high fiber is healthy! just make sure you drink enough water or you will get constipated again, fiber sucks all the moisture out of things so water is essential. make sure to get your fruits and veggies too.|`|mG2lZRrXaa	High fiber diets are healthy. They decrease your triglycerides and prevent colon cancer.|`|Ndr7D8BJaa	fiber is good because the calories you consume are passed through your system, so you get some energy but you're not adding to your daily total of calories.
xGXyr9oIaa	well weed is really better than alcohol in all reality and scientific studies. it does NOT kill brain cells, (like alc) theres less wrecks with weed, people dont get as mad when on it as they do drinking, so less fighting, and the good thing is it only makes you lose your short term memory while your high on the marijuana, it does not permanently do anything to your brain :)     i love pot, and anyone who doesnt like it probably havent looked up as much information on weed as the people who do like it, for the simple reason that we are just trying to validate why pots not bad. either way i love pot!!|`|cKpg3HQaaa	i did 1-4 times a day for a while but ive cut back to 1-2 times a week now im a good boy :D|`|ub6641d2aa	Why the hell is this in mental health?

AA11176387	well, I used  30 rosewood several times but it did not look like that    I have medium to dark brown hair but getting quite a bit of grey..when I use the rosewood, it looks like the bright red at the bottom of the right hand one called 20 rb Caribbean mahogany.    It is real noticeable.  I like it better after it tones down a bit after three or four shampoos.    I once met someone who I chatted with online at a concert very briefly and I later saw a post she did when someone asked what I looked like as saying I had a strange color red hair..lol    I certainly like it better than the greying look and it is one of few non-permanent brands also more natural.    I tried actually to find a matching color to my hair but it either did not cover the grey or was way too dark..even though when I looked at the samples and compared it by holding my hair against it, it looked like an exact match..since my hair naturally has a reddish tint to it, these were the closest I could get and still cover the grey but they are way more red than my natural hair color.    I once tried another color which also worked out ok but forget what..cineberry sounds familiar so that may have been it..I might try that next time    Best of luck getting the color you like..if you don't like it it will eventually wash out.    I also leave it on my long hair for 20 minutes to be sure it covers the grey and I focus most of it on the front and sides and top using the whole bottle.

It's even helpful, some of my friends have to have nipple covers in their bras but I never have to worry about that.|`|oluzjSgjaa	Flat or inverted nipples are actually pretty common. About 10-20 percent of all women are born with them. Inverted nipples from birth are not medically harmful.     There are actually 2 types of inverted nipples.   Many health professionals may refer to shy nipples. A shy nipple can be pulled inwards, but at other times protrude. A shy nipple can point out in cold temperatures such as cold water, or can be brought out with some massage or stimulation.   True inverted nipples are present from birth, and do not protrude with cold or stimulation. The cause is usually from connections in underlying tissue, ligaments and the skin. Ligaments along the milk ducts, which connect to the nipples, are shorter and pull the nipple in towards the breast tissue.|`|R42KEhZMaa	my friend had inverted nipples...  she never outgrew it..but she said her bf never cared and neither did she..  everyones body is different..|`|CG1Yd8yOaa	some girls do have inverted nipples and it is no big deal. it's just how you are made. inverted nipples are only a problem when you breast feed a baby but there are things you can do to help then when it is time to worry about that. be glad they dont poke out all the time for everyone to see|`|5zjwOSe9aa	lol funny this guy was talking about her ex GFs nipple being inverted. yeah just one of them lol    Just had to turn her on and it pops out.

I guarantee you within 2 years of getting married you will want to divorce because he is abusive to you.  Don't allow it.|`|8Hlvv8a4aa	He must be Italian.|`|WRbbpRZzaa	I definitely think you should have him seek professional anger management.
XMA4BzuSaa	anger issues usually come from perceived control on his part. Loss of control, wanting control or all controlling. This could be a red flag for your relationship. You may think you know him really well and maybe you do. But, when it comes to seeing people for who they really are sometimes love is blind. Ask him to seek counseling (anger management) and see his reaction. If he agrees, it's saying that he realizes his issue. If he disagrees or goes off you might want to listen to those family and friends who realize there maybe danger here.  It's almost like those women you hear about after they've been beaten.  "I ain't pressin charges because I luv him. Y'all don't know him like I do"  The only difference is he hasn't hit you.   Again, have him get counseling. Marriage isn't always easy and if he has anger issues now, it will only get worse when things don't go his way.    Good Luck...|`|nIRMAVZ6aa	honey, read your first sentence...."im tryin to handle his short fuse".....that is his responsibility to handle, not yours. Lets look at the negatives.....he is verbally abusive (even at work), he comes from an abusive home, and he is the most romantic thing in the world after you have a fight. That is the classic story of an abuser. You may adore this man, but you are going to be a victim one day yourself....of domestic violence. It happens all the time. These are telltale signs that he is an abusive man. You better adore YOU......that is not love. Your family and friends aren't the ones who refuse to see.....you are!!! Tough love sweetie.....wise up and don't waste another day on him. You'll regret it one day if you don't. Good luck!!|`|AA10409227	Your family and some of your friends see a BIG danger sign that you do not see. Any guy who gets into fights regularly, and puts his fist into walls or loses his cool with you & on the job, has a serious anger problem. If you marry him & he doesn't get help FIRST, it's only a matter of time before he starts aiming his anger & fists at you.  I am sorry, but from your description it sounds like you are picking this kind of guy because you are rebelling against your parents lifestyle. Unfortunately, you may find that they are correct about this guy -- whether they are stuck-up or not. If I were you, I would tell this guy how much you love him, but that he needs to get professional help with his anger, or you will not marry him. IF he has these problems at work too, it's only a matter of time before it will affect his work or cause him to lose his job. If you love him, help him first. If he is too macho to understand & admit he needs help, he is the wrong guy for you, and you will face a life of misery if you marry him as-is. Sorry, but that's the way I see it. Good luck.|`|SGCLFbAHaa	well those r probably reasons he is so angry you could try to go on a vacation to calm him down or maybe go through theraphy or talk it over with him to get it all out    it will also be very hard to keep dating him where all of your friends and family are not too sure about him because you may not feel your doing the right thing, but if you do really love him alot then just keep dating him|`|QUCIdBp5aa	Unless he goes for some serious therapy, your friends and family are worried about you.  Children who are abused are more likely to become abusive themselves unless they undergo intensive therapy.  He's already showing signs and you guys aren't even married.  Take these signs seriously, please.    You say you see the "real" him, but you're already trying to make excuses for his fuse.|`|i6QkapaDaa	You are taught as children how to deal with emotion.  He has learnt agression. You can teach him differently.  When he is calm, calmly tell him how his anger makes you feel and ask him to try and address his anger in differnt ways. CBT psycholgy is best but I doubt he'll accept it.  Also drug and alchohol abuse has affect on mood also.  Take care of you and concrentrate more on your relationship than how your partner is percieved by others.|`|Vmim6dv0aa	People have a tendency to act the way they grew up.  The things you are saying are not good signs.  If you really love him ask him to seek professonal help to get to the root of the problem.  Talk to him about your concerns and definately don't get married until they are resolved and you feel comfortable.  Don't let him make excuses for his behavior and have a line that can be crossed, don't let him get away with things just because he had a bad child hood.  Follow your gut, there is a reason we have those feelings.  If you love him and are happy, your family is just gonna have to accept that or think to yourself do they have reason to be concerned?  As for age, it's just a number.

bCmqScVlaa	You're asking for quite a bit here.  I had cirrhosis, and was diagnosed with unknown etiology prior to transplant.  Later, after my transplant, they finally figured out it was PBC.  But I'm not a pharmacist, so I guess I can't help you.  Sorry.|`|W4whHKmxaa	About 1/3 of all patients who have cirrhosis  of the liver never really know what has caused  the disease.      Here are some of the causes that are known:  alcohol consumption, medication toxification,  chemical exposure, mushroom poisoning,  viral infections like Hep A,B,C,etc...  hereditary disease that cause excess iron  or copper to be retained in the body,  auto immune diseases like biliary cirrhosis or  sclerosing cholangitis, biliary obstruction or  malformation, metabolic disorders, cardiac  problems.      If you want to talk to a pharmacist, you can call  your local pharmacy if this is a drug related.  They are usually more than willing to answer  patients questions about any drugs they  dispense.     If you want to know more about a certain drug,  you can type the name of the drug in the  search engine and it will give you a wealth of  information.     Here are some drug sites that you can  look the drug up:  http://www.medicinenet.com/medications/a...  http://www.rxlist.com/drugs/alpha_a.htm    If you want to know more about cirrhosis of  the liver, here are some very good sites:  ttp://www.hcvets.com/data/hcv_liver/ci...  http://www.medicinenet.com/cirrhosis/art...  http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cirrhos...    Many drugs are very hard on the liver, this  includes over the counter medications and  herbs.  It is very important to tell the doctor  all medications that patient has taken.  This includes over the counter, herbs, herbal  teas, vitamins, minerals, supplements,  and prescriptions prescribed by other doctors.  The doctor has to weigh the pros and cons  of all drugs being given to the patient.  All  drugs have a long list of side effects and  warnings...there isn't one that doesn't have this.      I wish I could be of more help.
ParFJxnSaa	There is no simple answer; sometimes it fades, but it depends a lot on the cause. Ask yourself: "Why do I feel depressed, and when did I first start to feel this way: can I associate this with any recent change in my life?" (if so, it is probably reactive [situational] depression: counselling, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may be indicated, but most of life's adverse situations are resolved within 16 weeks, yet the medical criteria for depression, and the prescription of antidepressants is only 2 weeks!). Or, was it a more gradual thing, with no apparent cause? (a nutritional deficiency, hypothyroidism, environmental toxicity, or reactions to some medications, etc., becomes more likely as the cause). Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types. St. John's wort helps most people; tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe (neither should be relied on as a sole treatment).     It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective, but can work quicker than antidepressants, sometimes. A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as a commonly prescribed antidepressant, in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation. Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area). A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor.     (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. In the winter months, if not getting sufficient daily exposure to strong light, see http://www.mercola.com/ SEARCHBAR: enter: "vitamin D3", & Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, dont follow the typical normal reference range, as these are too low. The OPTIMAL value that youre looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at mercola.com - "vitamin D3; testing". Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements.     (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes minutes of exercise, daily, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression. (3.) Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain). (4.) Use daily, a relaxation method* and/or yoga*, and/or Tai Chi*.(5.) Initially, at least, some form of psychotherapy or counselling; later, perhaps either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy for, say, 6 months. (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule**.  (7.) As options, if desired, either a known, effective herbal remedy, such as St. John's wort, (get a German variety, if possible; local ones may vary in effectiveness. Perika, and Kira brands have been recommended as being effective. Take with a meal) or supplements, such as SAMe, or Inositol (from vitamin and health food stores, some supermarkets, or mail order: view section 55).     If 5HTP is used to boost serotonin levels, (which are low in depressed people) it is best taken with a high carbohydrate, minimal protein meal, like pasta, with tomato & basil, and avoid protein for 90 minutes, before, and after, to maximise the amount crossing the blood/brain barrier.|`|j6PrOaZgaa	dont lie.  get help.  i actually got put on an antidepressant today from my doctor  you really should just prescribed something. one of my friends did it and she is like a changed person, no lie. she is who convinced me to see my doctor.  there is nothing to lose. just do it|`|Yl1eAhamaa	you can feel better if you write an essay about your depression everyday. one day will come when you will have nothing left to write about your depression cause then it will be gone.  depression is like a new lover u want to be with all the time. u get lost in your lover so the best thing to do is write. preferably poetry but prose will do just as well depending on your style|`|0xR5UNRpaa	I used to be depressed.

Oh wait, cymbalta seemed to help a little, but it totally destroyed my ability to enjoy sex, and that was too much to give up, since i am married.  So it wasn't worth it.  It may have been a placebo effect anyway - I do get that from time to time.  my psychiatrist says it will be at least 30 years before they have customized medicine for the brain.  So I think I will die like this, with chronic and very severe bipolar mixed moods symptoms that are hell on earth and are intolerably painful.  I am like this over 1/2 the time.

8uiH6iRbaa	hey there i suffer from anaemia to    i have to take 3 ferrous sulphate tablets a day and have done for the last year and a half     anaemia is when your not producing enough iron and iron makes red blood cells and red blood cells carry oxygen around your body.    so even if you feel well and ok it doesn't necessarily mean you are so keep taking them until your doctor say's otherwise.    anaemia can cause pain any where in your body if its being starved of oxygen so it could be a possible cause     i always get chest pain and pains in my legs and feet due to poor circulation ( not enough blood flow due to lack of iron) and this can be very pain full.    i think you should get a blood test to see if your still anaemic and if you are follow doctors orders take your pills when your supposed to even if you think you don't need them !!!!! take them with pure orange juice as this helps your body absorb iron.|`|pRF5LLloaa	First off, you NEVER stop taking ANY medication without doctors orders!  that is really stupid!  Even though you feel better, the medication is still working.    Iron is NOT "made" in either the bone marrow or the liver.  Iron in ingested in the food you eat -- particularly red meats.  Iron is CRITICAL to making red blood cells, and red blood cells are made in the bone marrow.  But it is the kidneys that tell the bone marrow how much red blood cells to make.    Anemia does  not usually cause pain like that.  but your liver is the organ that destroys the used-up red blood cells.  if you have liver disease, THAT could be causing your anemia.    Since the kidneys tell the bones how much blood to make, kidney disease will also cause anemia.    You need to pays CLOSE and STRICT attention to what the doctor tells you. STOP TRYING TO TREAT YOURSELF.  You have far to much poorly-thought out information.  YOU are not a doctor.  Let the doctor do his work, and follow his orders exactly.    NEVER stop or change a medication without doctors orders!|`|iCzMOXOWaa	mmmm?i had anaemia when my kidneys failed and had to have ethoprotein ,and iron injections(intravenous),i dont think iron would cause any pain,not that i know of anyway!when my iron was really low i just got really tired and lethargic!

Try going to a free or low cost clinic to get help from a dr.|`|rYaqoPTHaa	Depression  By, David Watts    Depression grips with icy claws  Tearing painfully through flesh as it eats steadily towards the heart of its victim.  Depression goes from a feeling to a way of life as easily as a narcotic becomes a habit.  At least its something to feel.  Always there, to be relied upon in times of trouble.  Almost the antithesis of comfort yet comforting in its reliability.    Depression does not know joy or contentment as it smothers all.  Conquering and pillaging through a persons mind in a ferocious onslaught.  It is so very hard to fight and so easy to succumb.  It wants us all to give in.  It wants us all to let it control, destroy.  Until a person becomes a shell.  Walking flesh going through the motions of daily life.    The habitually depressed are the joyless.  Trying so very hard to obtain some feeling of happiness.  A small tidbit of glee from this icy grip of reality.  Booze helps a little but the bottle runs out.  Drugs help a little till the dealer gets busted.  Sex works as long as it works.  When its over, the vice of choice has run its course  its there.  Its always there.  Snickering.    Peering through the darkness.  Lurking in the shadows awaiting a soul to devour.  Stalking.  Trying so hard to break free.  Every kind word helps and every bit, even the tiniest sliver of negativity can send a roller coaster of pain.  Outside the wall is up.  Strength.  Stability.  Even honor.  Inside emotions and worthless mind banter reign in self destruction.    Peace is more important than understanding.  Others dont have to understand.  Just accept.  Help.  Please help.  Oh God help.  Or leave us alone.  Just dont make it worse.  The depressed are vacuums, sucking in all the good times  Trying to hold on in anticipation for the next one.  Hoping for some form of adoration that never comes.  Loosing hope    Love isnt real.  Joy is a farce.  Happiness is nothing more than a brief lean on a crutch.  (Depression cant mess with a high junkie.)  The roller coaster makes frequent stops.  Not sure where the end is.  Want to get off.  This ride isnt fun anymore.  It hurts.  Make it stop.  Must have peace, at any cost.  Dont have enough to buy it.  Peace.  Priceless.  Unattainable.      Observing others.  Lemmings.  Dont have any REAL problems.  Grandma said our pain is bigger than anyone elses.  Its a gargantuan chasm.  An ocean.  Space.  Big.  Depression is bigger than we are.  Thats why we are powerless against it.  Depression goes from a feeling to a way of life as easily as a narcotic becomes a habit.  What a way to live.    (I was inspired by the blogs)|`|8pw8qDjPaa	See a doctor.

ETiZd4vPaa	Sweetie, i've had this before! if you think calling the police is the right way to go, then by all means go for it! i wouldn't exactly stop you, because you have every right to do so. Do you know what is causing your dad to do this to you?    And, suicide isn't the answer, please do not kill yourself for what somebody else is doing to you, It will only look like you've given your life up to get back at your father.    In my opinion, talk to a relative or a friend about whats going on?  and if you think you'll feel safer without your Dad, then personally, i think you should pick up the phone quick!    i would also advice you to do it when hes not around, So he doesn't have an excuse to hit you once more.    The police will be on your side 100%, your dads in the wrong!    good luck!|`|Ir0Ync3iaa	I would suggest you pop in to the police station and talk to them about the options available. It's not always about getting people arrested. they can work with you and your family to rectify the issues that cause your dad to behave this way. I wouldn't dare to assume what the problem is and why he feels the need for violence but there is lots of help available to you and him. The first port of call needs to be getting professionals to work with you and your family to create the happy family that can be.    Good luck, I hope you get all sorted.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	it is illegal to hit people, I would definitely call the police and press charges, the ony way someone like that learns that he can't hit people is when he is made responsible for his actions.|`|ZKw46efXaa	of course you should call the police! nobody deserves to get beaten!|`|gTWgbpNFaa	talk to childline they are there to help you|`|pM1Qw0hUaa	You need to seek help very very quickly.

Don't allow it to happen.  How old are you and where are you?  Please e mail me in a few minutes.  I'm going to go now and find out who else can help you in this situation.

You've got your proteins, carbs, fruits and vegies...I assume grains are included. People all over the world eat this kind of diet every day and live healthy lives as a result.
dCF1UBUsaa	If you are hungry, eat something that is high in protein and low in fat, but make sure it's 1.5 hours before sleeping. Fruits are okay also, but they have sugars in them that will be stored overnight. If you are eating properly, you should be consuming 5-6 small meals or snacks per day, with the last snack 2 to 3 hours after dinner, 1.5-2 hours before bed. Right now I am trying to cut fat, so for my last snack I usually drink whey protein with water. It's only 110 calories and has 20g of protein, with only 1g of fat. Not having that snack isn't going to kill you, but the snack will help you fight cravings in the night and you won't store fat.|`|nDSLNnguaa	As long as you don't anything real heavy it should be fine.  Your metabolism works anytime you eat regardless of your activity level.  Your metabolism is also working while you are sleeping.  It isn't really a good idea to make a habit of eating unhealthy snacks right before bed but you shouldn't sleep hungry either.  There are so many conflicting theories out there that you should just do what you feel like you need to do.    There are even some dr's out there that recommend eating so many times a day (even if it puts you eating close to bed)    Like I said your metabolism works when you eat and when you sleep.    Edit: I will add that water is an excellent way to curb hunger.  If you feel it is too late to eat or you don't have anything light then drink some water before going to bed.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	eating right before bed makes you gain weight.|`|bAY9j21Paa	Its perfectly ok, and normal..

So you could probably eat something that doesn't weigh to much without gaining to a lot, if it's okay with you.|`|QWaspeg7aa	I can't sleep if I go to bed hungry so I do it all the time and it's fine. I think it's what you'd call an old wive's tale that you shouldn't do it.  I was told by a doctor once that the best thing to have is cereal (pref something oaty) and milk because this helps your body produce the chemicals it needs to get you to sleep.
ParFJxnSaa	STUTTERING - STAMMERING : The word "stuttering" is mostly used in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The word "stammering" is usually preferred in the United Kingdom, Eire, India and most other Commonwealth countries. Try deliberately slowing your speech. You could try several different talking speeds: 85%, 90%, 95%, and 100% Consider your current rate of speech as being 105%, a rate at which you stutter frequently. Go back to 85%, then slowly increase, in stages, until you begin to stutter noticeably: then go back to 85%, and work your way up to the rate before you began stuttering at a rate that you find unacceptable. Keep at that rate, for a good while, maybe later, risking stepping it up one more notch; confident that you can always work your way back up from 85% again.                    Think of it in terms of modem speeds on your computer: if that speed is set too high for the connection to the ISP, there will be problems. You may well be currently "overclocking" your speech modem: the difference between your brain speed, and the rate at which you are able to speak clearly and distinctly, without stuttering markedly, is the issue. A different suggestion is putting some marbles in your mouth.  STAMMERING:  I have heard that if you start to breath out just before you begin vibrating your vocal cords to make sound, that establishes momentum that helps reduce stammering. Good luck!

Some medications that other stutterers have tried include lorazepam, citalopram, celexa, and buspar.

Your mouth is always playing catch up. The key is to think what you will say first. Wait a few seconds then say it. Try reading out loud slowly. As you read word by word your brain will process it. The more you say the words, the more you will hear yourself say it correctly. Let me know if that helps.|`|pMKaf73kaa	I did TONGUE-TWISTER. Its fun too.

Don't try to over work it.      A tip for others dealing with a stuttering person...try not show impatience; look at them like you would any body else asking a question, no matter how long it takes.

3908da29f0769fb75937d8093758a4f4aa	False.  Being close-minded can indicate a need for control, or an avoidance of difference, or inflexibility of thought or feeling, defensiveness, denial, etc.   Mentally healthy people are open to growth, internally, and in relationship, and that means they have to be reasonably open-minded.|`|70c1c2e410f2cdd8e3cd8235784e9689aa	It could be true.  Depends on the person.  I do think having been diagnosed with a mental illness has opened my mind and compassion in a new way I never could have done without experiencing it myself.  But not having a mental illness is not necessarily going to make you closed-minded.|`|xUcjzYPdaa	I don't believe that this is true.    Mental illness isn't open mindedness. Mental illness is illness. It's a malfunctioning - usually of perception or mood.     Of course some people with good mental health are closed-minded - but that's not because they have good mental health. It's just who they are. It's difficult to be closed-minded about mental illness when you're mentally ill (although I'm sure people manage it), but mentally well people can be open-minded and accepting too.    Good mental health is the aim. You can be sympathetic to mental illness, and open-minded, and all sorts of positive attributes, whilst still being mentally well.|`|6YUxk7TDaa	Definitely false!

Obviously your chart should say that you had suffered a sexual assault and any doctor or nurse who sees your file would understand that implies you had no control over the situation.

I wish that no one ever had to endure a sexual assault.    You have every right to be angry at the nurse if she falsified documentation.  If she did not offer or advise you on any of those things then you should definitely let her boss know.  If you don't feel like it is something that you can do in person (though it might be good for you to do it in person) then write a letter.  Mail it to the nurse (if you know her name), her boss, and her boss's boss.  Falsification of documentation is very serious.    The reason they are supposed to go over these items with you has nothing to do with anything you did to be sexually assaulted.  You are right--you did not cause your attack.    They discuss safer sex (we used to call it safe sex, but sex is never completely 100% safe so the term was changed to safer mainly to prevent law suits) with you because there are many women who just don't practice it for one reason or another and it is dangerous not to, and after the attack you may be more apt to catch a disease due to tissue damage or to spread a disease you either caught from your attacker or already had (I am not implying you did have anything, but let's be honest that there are people who do.)    They discuss STI (sexually transmitted infection) and HIV risk reduction with you because there are steps you can take post-attack to reduce the chance you will catch an STI or HIV from your attacker.  Also, as mentioned above the risk of aquiring or spreading disease is greater when tissue is damaged.  If penile penitration occurred then they should have offered you emergency contraception.  The law makes it your right to decide if you want to risk pregnancy, especially from a sexual assault.  Smoking risks are discussed because it is a bad habit and whether you like to admit it or not, a large majority of people who use Planned Parenthood are in a socio-economic group that is more likely to smoke.      I don't know how to tell you how you can "get over it", but I know that just pretending it didn't happen doesn't help.  You should have counseling benefits through Victim's Services.  Call your local police department to find out.  And if you believe in God, then get deep in to prayer.      One thing I know about love, is that when you love someone you take them as they are--good and bad.  If a man loves you enough to marry you, then he will love you just the way you are.  He will not see it as disfigurement, but as a unique part of you.      This will make you a stronger woman if you let it or it can cripple you for life.  While you had no choice in the attack, you have a choice in how you will allow it to shape the rest of your life.  Fight back.  Fight for you!    Good Luck and God Bless.
xfpJGBfwaa	She has an earache, diarrhea and very bad diaper rash?  She should be seen for that earache and diarrhea.  As for making her comfortable, I think you're doing your best.  I assume you're using more powder than before, and allowing her to be diaperless for a half hour on the changing table to give her skin a chance to breathe.      Is there any chance of switching to cloth diapers for a couple of weeks?  I know they're messy to handle, but they would probably cause less chafing.  If the rash emergency is really that bad... maybe consider it.  Or just consider changing brands of diapers.  Maybe one of the pullups would have less chafing edges than a traditional diaper?  I hope it works out.    I don't think corn starch is a good thing to use.  Use talcum powder only.  Corn starch can provide food for a yeast rash.    UPDATE:  I had a long wait at the pharmacy yesterday, and sat around reading "The Pill Book" out of boredom.  It said that regular strength OTC hydrocorizone ointment is also indicated for use as a severe diaper rash treatment.  It said that the ointment is stronger than the cream, so find some Cortizone-10 ointment and give it a try - but it did say it would burn, so be prepared to give hugs.  Since she understands you, you might try to explain ahead of time that this might burn a little, but it will help more than it will hurt.      I hope she feels better and that it never comes back!|`|UAunAKdtaa	stop  putting baby  powder. it just sits there, absorbing the wetness, but not putting it away, and then it cakes arorund her legs. try using petroleum jelly. you know, the vaseline stuff. some smell like baby. i know it sounds weird, to put something moist on something wet, but trust me. my son had a diaper rash and i was putting that corn starch stuff, and my mom in law grabbed the jelly and  just smothered my baby's butt with it. put it everywhere,, making sure to cover up thickly. my son stopped yelping, and within a couple days, the rash was history. i used to use the vitacilina bebe cream, but its hard to take off afterwards, and it seems to burn a little. so use the jelly, doesnt matter what brand as long as it says 100% petroleum, jelly. dont confuse it with the petroleum oil lol   good luck and hope your little girl does better. try feeding her less fiber if she is doing diarrhea. try carrots and rice for lunch once, well blended. avoid beans for a while.|`|NcLV4Jmuaa	put something dry such as baby powder on the rash.  you need to go to the doctor so the kid can be treated the right way.  trust me, you don't want scars on your baby girl.|`|AA10953999	Stop bathing her you are drying out her skin.

Next put on a good cream to help the rash.  Don't put on the Nappy the way you usually do if possible leave it off but if you have to have it on wrap it round like a skirt, if she wees it will still soak it up but it will let the air get to it witch will help it heel and it will stop her from touching  her rash.  Then get her some thing for her ear you will need to take her to the docs.  good luck|`|qplvtCqIaa	Corn starch|`|YqYyXpTtaa	The best thing you can do is try not to soak her in water it will do more damage, only wash quickly and dry quickly then leave nappy OFF for a bit i know she might wee everywhere but leave it off for 5 minutes, its really important that it gets aired every now and then, you will see the difference, if its cold where you are put her near the heater when the nappy is off so she doesnt get cold, zinc cream is good, try putting sorbolene cream on it just after you wash her then when it dries put whatever nappy rash cream you have on it, she could be teething thats why she has this and also stop giving her acidy foods like tomatoes, oranges and anything acidy because when she lets it out thats is what burns her...

QK5oaL4oaa	Don't worry about it. I'm 20 and only just recently started timing my periods. You'll first be able to tell you're on your period when you go to the bathroom and notice blood after you wipe yourself. It barely stains your panties at that point (if it does at all) it won't stain your pants. Generally, I'll notice the blood around 6pm, and then the period gets heavier the next day. If you're just starting out (it sounds like you are) your period won't be that heavy at all. I wouldn't worry about stains even if you didn't notice it for hours.    I wouldn't put pads on before actually bleeding. Those things are expensive! Just keep some in your purse and then always bring your purse to the bathroom. Since you're expecting it soon, just don't wear white pants for the time being. Dark jeans are the best, as their fabric is thick in addition to being dark.     Most of all, don't stress so much. Oh, and I never get cramps, although a lot of women do. Just carry around some advil in your purse (along with your pads). Don't worry! Really, you're making a mountain out of a molehill.|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	Wear panty liners and always have a pad and some midol with you. Good luck ?|`|AA11113671	just dont wear the white pants for a few wks! lol. its weird, but i can tell just before its going to start, then when i pee, sure enough...!!|`|ixsUWp5Aaa	i always know when im going to start mine and u should too.  just to be safe just wear pantie liners or tissue if you dont have any|`|7x9lvbhAaa	is it your first time wear black underwear's just in case you get it so no one will notice|`|qMBf2vgiaa	YES|`|Vq6jHbkYaa	Are you expecting to get it for the first time? If you think it's coming you should wear panty liners.  The blood usually comes at a steady pace for the first couple days, but lightens up.  Not everyone gets cramps, I have only had like 3 cramps out of the 5 years I've had my period. But, I recommend you don't wear white pants!|`|rbkikcdYaa	Have you had your first period?    If you have think about the last time you period came and if you can remember an approximate date of your period.    If you cant remember when your last period was i would recomend not wearing white pants until your next period has finished.    Always remember the date that your period came and when it finished..  that way you have some idea of when your next period will come.    Some girls dont get the cramps and symptoms before a cycle.  So remembering the date always helps.    I would recomend that you wear a liner until you get you period. Its a precaution that everyones gone thru|`|TQrXAujdaa	the first day u get it    its like nothing at all.  and you'll be able to know if it's coming.|`|cSJ2xLJDaa	Your body gives you signals. Boobs might get slightly bigger/tender. A strange feeling in your stomach a few days before. Make sure you have advil or some ibuprofen. I usually take some before i get my period so i dont feel cramps which can hurt a lot sometimes. If you want to be prepared and never had them before and you cant tell wear pantyliners. They are cheap. And keep some pads in your purse. Def. stay away from white pants.|`|rwQiydoVaa	if u are afraid of getting your period unsuspectingly, i suggest u to wear  pantiliners. it is ok to wear it everyday of the month.   pantiliners are much thinner than a pad, so it will not be noticeable. they are used just like a pad. it has a sticky back that you stick onto your underwear.   they can be used for absorbing wetness and protecting your panties from normal discharge, perspiration, small leaks of urine and unexpected menstrual flow.  good luck!

XHnpraaxaa	Your diet is way far off.  You should not eat the same things each day or your weight won't change.  This is a known fact.  May I ask where your fruit is?  That gives you energy.  Where is your veggies?  You need them every day and the more the better.  Eat some of each color group.  Veggies and fruits are fiber and needed for weight loss.  Do eat protein and keep your diet below 2000 a day for weight loss for a guy or under 1500 under for a woman.  No excuse for lack of exercise.  You can walk any where or you can stay in an exercise with a tape at home or get yourself an exercise bike.|`|BJugETlOaa	You can do other things besides run. sit ups, push ups, squats, jumping jacks, you can also buy a jump rope.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	you need to eat within the 1st 15 min.

I am convinced that a little excercise it 100 times better than none if you want to loose weight. Grab your walkman and go for a walk, or call your friend while walking. Before you know it you will have walked a mile. Get 8 hours sleep a night to boost your metabolism. Eat oatmeal with raisins its WONDERFUL for filling you up. Body wraps help you loose weight fast, but replace the water you loose to help rehidrate your body. You should loose 2-3 lbs a week or else it is comming off too fast and will go back on too fast. This means 12- 18 lbs - this can be increased through increased excercise. GO DO IT and HAVE FUN!!!|`|Qby4QaV9aa	The best rate of weight loss to be healthy about 2 to 3 pounds a week so this is just a little high but not impossible.    You should eat more green vegetables and have a better varied diet and enure proper hydration - drinking about 2 to 3 liters water a day to flush the system and feel better.    Also - just because no access to park does not make it impossible to exercise. Walking anywhere or in-house exercise is possible you know.    Keep intake moderate to light, use more calories than you consume, improve your exercise to boost your metabolism and you will lose weight.

As for the more bleeding during certain days, it is completely normal. It will take a couple of yrs after puberty for ur body to "normalize". U can just wear pads that are meant for heavier flow. It called "overnight". Its reely long and super absorbent. Also chnage frequenctly. U can keep a nice purse/clutch with u to keep ur pads so u dont have to be embarrased carrying them arnd.|`|5b478a242969ee67691fa226064cfcd6aa	Sounds like you're probably going to be better off with towels rather than tampons. I find that the best sort are Kotex Night Time Maxi the fold up ones. They really are good and they don't cause the leakage that your experiencing at the moment. Also, don't forget that you will probably need to change three times a day minimum when it's heavy.    If you do want to wear tampons, you might be better off wearing them in the latter days of your period when the flow is lighter.    You will get used to the flow, it just takes some time.    Good luck|`|GqRNBTV9aa	If tampons ache you haven't insert them correctly or you should try a different size or type. I find tampons without applicators very difficult to insert so I always use tampax compact start from a small size but combine it with a tower just in case. Also experiment with positions, squatting, sitting etc. I used to have the same problem in the beginning. Normally you should be able to forget that you are wearing them.     Also a friend of mine wears some sort of shapewear knickers during her period. They help her with cramps and because they are so thick they make it easier to avoid embarrassing incidents. With baggy jeans and sweat shirt you will be ok and I doubt anyone will notice. Just get one that is relatively easy to get up and down so you want have problems going to the loo.|`|Y32OhOVoaa	I only use the applicator tampons ..    they are ALOT easier to put in    i dont like the other oness    good luckk|`|bM1TrzGjaa	Okay you poor thing. Dont worry with a little practice you can get this problem sorted out I'm sure.    First of all calm down when you are inserting it. You need to feel comfortable and calm or your muscles will tighten up stopping you being able to put it up inside snugly.  It's best if you stand strait, place one leg on a chair in front of you bent at an angle and other leg stays strait on the floor, then insert it from behind yourself.     Instructions should come with tampons on how to use them.    Try with a small size to get used to it while using a sanitary towel until you can work your way up to the maxi sized tampon.|`|h5xSfcT6aa	ok, if you can still feel it when its inside you, its not in far enough. thats it. so you need to push it up a little further, as far as you can!   you shouldnt be able to feel it at all when its inside you - thats whats great about them! you can completely forget you re even on!  anyway, dont give up! just push it up as far as you can. then it wont hurt at all.  good luck!  xxx|`|qfUnwHyFaa	when i first come on i tried small ones and they hurt me too   but then i tried the bigger ones and they were fine?!  pretty weird X   try the normal ones instead of compact x|`|c23b658ab35a3e3b168534baf3d6f942aa	Your heavy on the first days due to the increase in hormones being released to remove the old lining on the uterous, I use playtex super and they hold me pretty good if it is that heavy try wearing a tampon then wear a maxi pad as well to be safe..|`|ETiZd4vPaa	Tampons are something that takes getting used too!  i'm sixteen, and i started my period when i was 11!  and i still don't find them comfortable.  it might just be your preferred methods, and you might prefer sanitary towels, i sure do!  use the extra absorbent ones? its nothing to be embarrassed about, as nobody will ever know what you use.    And different peoples periods are of different consistency's, some are heavier than others,   day 1 my period is very heavy, and i suffer terrible stomach pains from this. Day two they're not as bad,  Day three, i'm light as it is my last day.   Its just your period, and your body type to why it is heavy  nothing to worryabout : )|`|scX6smKVaa	oh honey, unfortunately it will take a while for the muscles in your vagina to get used to "clamping" the tampon! I ached slightly when I first started using them but after a few months this will go.    If you can still feel the tampon inside you when you walk then you have not inserted it correctly.    I recommend you use the applicator ones first untill you get used to them.    Staceyx|`|aYoscopKaa	You should wear pads when you know your period is due and change them every few hours  Pads are way more comfortable and there are alot  more different types available. If you want to try tampons try different brands, don't try putting tampons in if you're not on your period.  Most importantly make sure you're "secure" and change it a every few hours  and don't stress! :).  Hope this helps :)  x|`|YK05Itmraa	Awww honey.    Right if you want to put in a tampon successfully then you really need to try and relax. It helps so much and trust me it really doesn't hurt at all. Once you are relaxed then just put it in. This should allow for it to be put in securely and accurately. You may still need to change it every couple of hours if you are heavy like me but as long as you wear a sanitary towell as well it should not go through to your knickers. Once you are 'secure' with yourself you feel much more confident and it will become a doddle!    Good Luck Honey :D|`|i6QkapaDaa	Don't where tampax for 1 portion of the 24hr day (i.e maybe night).   Just have a go with them once every month always with smallest size till you feel discomfort goes.  Use the higher absorbancy sanitary towels with wings, MAybe the night time ones for the 1st few days would be best.  Keep going to the toilet after each lesson to check.  Teacher should let you leave and if they don't speak to the school nurse or female teacher you trust and ask them to speak to that particular member of staff.  Wings do help with towels.  Bring spare underwear so you don't feel upset.  If none of this helps, speak to your Mum or Dad they may understand.  Remember its a natural body function.  Only pregannt or breast feeding women don't menstruate so everyone has to deal with it.  20 years after my first period I still hate them.
8SRjELNBaa	Remember that pasta is a carbohydrate.  Eating a carbohydrate before bed get's digested, and if the energy isn't getting burned it's just going to turn into fat.... So, rather, try to eat your carbohydrates in the morning & if you get hungry (like today) this late to bed (happens to me too), try to eat some sort of protein like some lunch meat or a small piece of chicken.|`|VSloQ8KDaa	Of course!

xUcjzYPdaa	Yes, they help.    You don't need to see these people. Like with any illness, you can choose not to get treatment, and they can't insist unless your life is in danger.    Personally, I wouldn't like to live with hallucinations. I think they would make it difficult to live my life. But if you want to live with them then that is your decision. You have chosen against getting help - that's fine, and you shouldn't be judged for it.     But equally, you shouldn't judge people who choose to get help, people who choose to get treatment for their illnesses. People do what's right for them - there is no universally right decision.|`|yazZH4khaa	They do not study for 10+ years to know nothing about people and their physical and mental health.

KOYC3XkJaa	Well, 2nd degree burns usually take several weeks to heal and you made several mistakes in the treatment of it. The first one was when you broke the blister and let the liquid out. Blisters are your body's natural band-aid and should not be broken. The next mistake was putting neosporin on it right away. You should never put anything oily or greasy like that on a burn for at least 12 hours as it traps the residual heat and can make the burn worse. Also, as soon as you get burned you should run cool water over it.  So, to summarize: 2nd degree burns take longer than a week to heal. The numbness is unusual though. It could indicate some nerve damage.  Now the other answer said to go to the doctor for antibiotics. You don't need antibiotics unless you have an infection, which you have made no mention of, but I do agree that you should go to the doctor. They can evaluate the burn, clean it, and get it properly dressed.|`|1lOzRfT1aa	If it's been a week off to the doctor you ,must go and get some antibiotics so march to the office you go

It seems unlikely that diarrhea is caused by these components of semen unless it is an allergic response to your partner's proteins.    Semen allergies are not common but do occur. It may be that you are allergic to the chemistry of your partners semen. If you have had other partners did you have the same reaction? If so you are probably allergic to swallowing any semen.    If you're too shy to see your doctor (which is my recommendation) you could simply stop swallowing. Also, they have these great flavored condoms at Wal-Mart or any grocery store. They come in great flavors for oral sex and he can go in the condom so you don't have to swallow.  Your partner should understand if it is bothering you to swallow and should compromise.

KbmP0xWhaa	okay well if you want to get into a relationship with a guy start slow. just go to a club or at school or how ever old you are it depends just have a chat with them nothing special. then keep on doing that for a while and make a few guy friends then you will learn to grow and understand how they think and act to everything while their your friends once your confortable with that then just go out somewhere where you can meet a few people, get your friends to introduce you to some of their guy friends and eventually if not sooner than later a guy will find they like you and give you their number or ask you out. then say yes - have dinner with them or something and then see i you like them or not if you do then keep on going if you dont then just say i'm really sorry but i dont think your my type - let them down gently but always at the end say but i still want to be friends and make sure you smile to confirm that. if you keep on going with the relationship you might end up getting more serious. and you can start with the kissing and then eventually every that comes with it - the moment the guy wants to go further than you do (which hardley ever happens) - walk away, it might be hard, but if they dont respect your choices they are not worth keepiing around. but just ease into it slowly and everything will be fine. their not that different to girls they just like sport and are more confident with everything. so just enjoy the time and have fun - dont worry if they like you or love you or what you look like, one thing i'v learnt from guys, they like you for who you are - not some fake copy of someone else. be your self and have fun !!    hope i helped, good luck :]!|`|AA11113671	love equals happiness, so you have to be happy!|`|AA12197891	you need to know that the other person have feelings, thoughts and ideas you are not the only one. think of it that you two are a balance you have one side and the other have the other half. you need to give in as much as he does and make sure that every thing is mutually accepted. it is ok to be different from the other person but don't let that difference push you away but on the other hand make it a cause to bring you closer.   live life, be happy and enjoy life...

He should not be trying to control your life. You should be living life how you want to not how he wants you to.    Every decision you make for yourself affects you only..especially about something like smoking.    In all seriousness answer this and then make your decision.    - Can you see yourself with this guy in ten years?    If not what is the point in wasting your time with someone that is seriously making you unhappy.    If it was me I'd probabaly pick my packet of cigarettes over a guy like that any day....|`|cSJ2xLJDaa	Yes and no.  Sometimes theres a weird thing that goes on between smokers and non-smokers. I dont think it should be a matter of choosing between smoking and having him as a boyfriend. Two completely unrelated situations. Because you got together when you already have been smoking it is unfair for him to ask you to do otherwise. Another thing is that he may be insecure (he wont let you talk to other guys) and smoking is another thing he isnt a part of. Then again you might have a weird relationship with this certain guy and he feels uncomfortable. So only you really know if he's dramatic. Can you put yourself in his shoes and talk it out?|`|GPUe13xXaa	No.  He just wants whats good for you.  Sounds like you two should try being friends before continuing this relationship.  I say this because it sounds like you both have issues that should be taken care before you move forward.

VnLaUS3Jaa	once i had a friend that was very obese and asked for my help to lose weight (i am an aerobics instructor and personal fitness trainer).    after asking my help, he kept getting candy bars and other junk out of the machine at work. he would try to hide them from me.    one day, as he was eating a little debbie, he realized that i was watching him and nervously, he asked if i wanted some of it.    i took it from his hand, walked over to the nearest trash can, and threw it away. in front of everyone.    a little harsh, perhaps, but everyone knew that we were training together and he had asked for my help.    i needed to get it through his thick skull that in order for me to be able to help him, he needed to get his eating habits in check. and i knew this would do it.    this guy may talk to you about his weight, and if he does and he has admitted to you that it bothers him, then i would do something to this extent for his own good.    luckily, i knew this guy would not be angry. a little embarrassed, maybe, but he was cool enough to see what i was trying to do for him.    if the guy you know lacks a sense of humor or whatever, i guess it'd be a bad idea.    good luck!

Yes, it's bad. Smoking does horrible things to your body.  2. Cigs are drugs  3. If you "stopped" for less than a week and then felt you "had" to have one, you're addicted. And drug addictions only get worse.    There are healthier ways of relieving stress.|`|hnsTDoyuaa	Absolutely bad. Apparently you are becoming addicted. Do you want to look like those horrible looking old people you've seen pictures of?|`|yyZ9cgNFaa	I think the fact that you have to ask if this is bad for you gives you the answer, usually when you know something is bad, you ask other people because you want someone to tell you what you want to hear.
tI1NHwfBaa	A lot of the controversy over this vaccine comes from the fact that some conservative religious types think it promotes sexual promiscuity.    Speaking as a very conservative, very religious type myself, I don't understand that.  Cervical cancer kills 4,000 women each year in the U.S.  90% of the cases of cervical cancer are attributable to the HPV virus.    If I can give my daughter a vaccination that's proven safe and can reduce her chances of getting a deadly disease or a painful, annoying sexually transmitted disease, then I'd be foolish not to do it, in my opinion.    I don't expect that my daughter will be sexually promiscuous.  We teach abstinence until marriage as an important value.      But still, things happen.  People make mistakes.  People get sexually assaulted.  The Gardisil vaccine doesn't eliminate every strain of HPV, but it apparently prevents infection by four strains that are the most common causes of cervical cancer.|`|YMgE5Ie4aa	i think that it is a good ideal it's for her protection, just like all the other vaccines that she has gotten. people make big deals over the littlest things, where there things going on that are far more worst.|`|7xNlABgSaa	it only prevents three of MANY types of viruses that causes hpv. It's pointless, she could still get it even if she IS vaccinated. Don't force foreign meds into someone else's body. Not cool.

Z2kIKVfIaa	I have experienced a similar problem throughout my years. I think it stems from a general insecurity/distrust with ourselves.     Whenever someone speaks two things must always exist. First, they must have something to say, and second they must know how to say it. The trick to communicating effectively is finding a balance between these two realities. It sounds like you are kind of having trouble with both of these though.     I would recommend listening as attentively as you possibly can when someone is speaking to you. Feel free to ask as many questions as you need to in order to figure out just what they are telling you. Then, when you feel that you have all the information you need, supply them with an answer that you believe is adequate. Do not worry about what they will think of your answer. Just be honest with yourself and speak your true thoughts. That's really all one can do. Good luck!|`|lZQAiRV3aa	Talk to family or friends about that one man. You need someone close to answer that!

PRECEDURE TO PUT ON BRACES  1. They put some glue stuff on your teeth.  2. They put in a plastic thing in your mouth.  3. They get the brackets and start putting them on your teeth one by one.  4. They shine your teeth with a UV blue light to harden the glue.  5. After they put on all the brackets on they put in the wire and put in the rubber bands (color of your choice) in.   6. Then they are done!!!     DO'S  1. Do brush your teeth at least 3-5 per day  2. Do floss everytime you brush.  3. Do if there is a loose wire or bracket or a wire poking you schedule a appointment ASAP  4. Do eat soft foods for the first few days.  5. Do cut fruit into small pieces.     DON"T'S  1, Don't eat hard foods.  2. Don't chew gum.  3. Don't stress over it.     FOODS YOU CANNOT EAT  1. popcorn  2. gum  3. carmel  4. apple (whole)  5. Ice  6.nuts  7. peanut brittle  8.hard pizza crust  9. corn on cob  10. ribs  11. chips  12. hard pretzels  13. hard rolls and bagels  14. raw carrots  15. beef jerky  16. corn nuts   17. suckers       Take Advil after your appointment so it doesn't hurt after 4 hours. Yes, it will be a bit sore so eat mashed potatos,soup,and yogurt. You will lose some weight while on that diet especially on the bottom braces for me. I lost 7 pounds. (It kinda scared me but don't stress over that).|`|vbAlVxtBaa	do not get in a fight with anyone... ive knocked out a hell of a lot of braces. and made a lot of lips bleed|`|OQIP89zuaa	The braces will help your jaw, it will straighten it out.      Braces do hurt the first couple of days, and it is hard to eat because putting pressure on hurts them. Take some medicine to take the pain away. It also feels weird on your lips because it isn't your smooth teeth rubbing against your lips. I would puff my cheecks out so that my lips woulnd't touch the brackets! ( :    When you brush with braces be sure to get under and above, and all around, otherwise you get groos stuff stuck everywhere... it feels good to get them all clean though. Maybe consider getting a water pick or whatever they are called. They spray out water and gets between the brackets!    Hope this helped, and don't worry about it!

AA12091376	Herpes and HPV are transmitted through skin-to-skin contact.  However, it is very unlikely that you would get it from a co-worker.  It would be more likely you would get either of these viruses from a sexual partner.  HSV and HPV can be transmitted with or without symptoms, while using a condom, and through oral sex.  Both are incurable and usually not included in "complete" STD testing.  You have probably never been tested.  20-25% of adults have genital Herpes and 1 in 2 adults have some form of HPV.    The bump could be an ingrown hair, pimple, or even a hemorroid.  However, you should go in to a doctor and get retested.  You specifically have to ask for the Herpes type specific blood test.  There is no FDA approved test for HPV in men unless you have visible genital warts.|`|AA10327722	If you didn't have sex with him or nothing sexual then your fine.  You are probably just paranoid bout it so you think somethings wrong with you.|`|fk9AvB25aa	Stds are usually passed on when you have sex with some one that has one. Since you didn't have sex with this guy who happens to have an std then there would be no risk of you having one.  If you haven't had sex with any one since your last partner then there is a chance that you are clean. But some stds can lie dormant with out symptoms for months and years after you contracted one. Even your partner could have had an std and not have even know it because some stds have very little symptoms. So you may want to get the bump tested for stds|`|PSQSAwSmaa	Yes. If you have come in contact with his semen, meaning you have swallowed it or had it come near your private area, you could have also caught the STD. In some cases, you may also be able to get it from having his blood mix with yours, such as HIV.|`|9947a1e51b6060e5a8842b07f5ecfa80aa	I wonder why they call it "SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED....."|`|DBg0yFSYaa	My guess is genital herpes.

Good luck, hon.|`|GrnIjiMiaa	Unless the STD went airborn (which doesn't happen) then you are fine to share a working environment with someone with and STD. If he has HIV, then you and your co-workers would need to know and be educated on blood born pathogens. Now, as for the sensitivity, I don't know what that could be. If it persists, I would definitely have the doctor check it out just to be safe|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	nah,i think you have a boil back there.  go and sit in a tub of hot water,see if the boil will burst?  get a test for herpes maybe?  the coworker describes gonorrhoea symptoms.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	It don't think it's an STD, but the only way you are going to find out what the problem is  is to see your doctor.
GrnIjiMiaa	A typical screening only includes chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and bacterial infections. Unless a sore is present for the dr to swab and test, they are not able to test for HSV.

My advice it that anytime you do go for STD testing, request testing for ALL STDs, and specify that you do want to be tested for herpes and HIV as well.  That way, there will be no question as to what testing you want to have done.     You can check the website hivtest.org to find free STD testing sites in your area.  Just enter your ZIP code.  If you have any questions as to which tests a particular site does, call and ask.|`|V6XVLbaGaa	herpres is detected in blood work.  also know if they find herpes, it could very well be the cold sore on the lip-kind.  make sure the test differentiates between the genital and the other type.

QK5oaL4oaa	Have you had your period long? If you've only had it a few times, I would say use pads. It took me a year (or maybe two) before my flow was heavy enough for tampons. If you use it when you're not bleeding very much, it gets stuck.     For future reference, TSS is extremely rare. I knew a woman who accidentally left a tampon in for about a month (the gyno found it) and she didn't get TSS. I don't recommend this, but if you use tampons as the instructions say, I can pretty much guarantee you won't get TSS.     When it comes to changing tampons or pads, I wouldn't say tampons are more convenient. (You have to take tampons into the washroom too). Just bring a bunch of pads, put it in your suitcase and keep a few in your purse (or pocket) and replace them after you use them. You don't even have to say anything, and if you do say something, everyone will understand. Hope that helps!|`|SGvVkkl5aa	yea use whatever you feel comfortable with.  im sure they'll understand if theyre both girls.|`|SghwXlQ9aa	Since you're not experienced with tampons, I don't suggest wearing them to a friends' house.

Their is no reason to be ashamed that you have your period. Having a period is uncomfortable enough, don't put yourself through any more discomfort by keeping in a tampon for 8 hrs. Besides, I've never bled light enough to have a tampon in for 8 hours. You shouldn't risk your health because your embarrassed that you've reached womanhood.|`|jb9guNo3aa	Well you should just tell them you're on your period regardless so you won't be trying to hide it. I think you should just use whatever you're more comfortable with. Personally I find tampons more comfortable, and like you said, portable.|`|JY07ZrLCaa	Your friends will definitely understand. When I used pads, even as a grown-up at work, I just stuck them in my big purse and took the whole thing to the bathroom. No one needs to know whether you're simply putting on make-up or actually changing a pad.|`|eXJOdwzcaa	can you not change your tampon at her house?  i mean pulling on it does feel weird, but you'll get used to it.  if you dont want to use tampons (which the chance of you getting tss is very very low, i wear them every time im on my period) then as soon as you get to her house with yourstuff just be like i REALLY have to pee, and just put your pads under her sink or in a cabinent if you dont want them to know. just sneak it.|`|eEueDxpCaa	both

It'll eventually go away, the outbreak is caused by not cleaning it well so it forms into a bacteria and the tissue will turn into a bump. Which is normal. Get Sea Salt and warm water mix it, get q-tip dab it in your ear. and twist the earring. and for faster and better you can always put on the ointment (bactene, Neosporion) they are good. the bump will go about 3 weeks. it can come back if you leave it untreated.

Mine is now almost full-body and I have a lot of complications.     I think that you probably don't need to worry about the long term effects of drugs at this stage - I do not know of any that have adverse effects involving the reproductive tract; the bigger problem is if you actually fall pregnant, because a lot of them can pass through to the foetus.    You mention a lot of different drugs and nerve blocks. Have you tried, or considered trying, a spinal cord stimulator? This works by sending electrical impulses through the spinal cord and interfering with nerve signalling. It causes a kind of gentle pins and needles through your CRPS affected areas, which is a lot more pleasant than the pain.    You fail to mention any kind of physiotherapy or desensitisation. I know that it hurts, but it's crucial. For desensitisation, you should start out at home with soft materials and rub them over your leg. Increase the pressure and the coarseness of the material as you're able. Warm and cool (not cold) water can be useful too. Also consider looking into mirror therapy and graded motor imagery - I'll give you a link for each and you can Google or email me if you want more information.

pzLDXL6gaa	Depends on the individuals. Most keep their original stance - circumcision is unnecessary and cruel, most people know that - but I'm sure some get caught up in the USA culture. Especially considering doctors and nurses push it at the hospital and sometimes in the past used to do it without permission.    Harriet|`|K4zsztkRaa	It really depends, my grandparents did only because they were forced too. Way back then boys were rutinly circumcised and just taken away and circumcised in some hospitals without asking the permission of the parents they were just done.    Now adays I do'nt think Immagrants would change their stance but that doesn't mean some can't.  Actually the US rate is getting closer to 50% and lower.    -Connor|`|ldpDzaolaa	My father has passed away, but I found out he wasn't.

I think it's better for health reasons. but some of that is based in jewish rituals etc.|`|4esOOErCaa	i don't really know. perhaps in the past when families moved to the U.S when they had babies they were advised by the doctors to circumcise their children (because in the past doctors used to believe it was better for you)    but now that its proved that there is no real benefit, they are probably reverting back to their tradition of not circumcising.. because europeans generally don't.     i'm swedish background and i'm not|`|kAHrcCL6aa	My ex was of Italian descent and he was not circumcised and neither were his 2 brothers. This was in the 1980's with their parents immigrants (not their grandparents), I think in the 1960's or one generation different they would have been. Circumcision is disgusting and wrong.
Ee0RvBK0aa	If your somewhere between the ages 11-14 give or take a few years it's probably puberty starting up. When hair begins to grow on the penis little white dots or just skin coloured bumps commonly appear. If you have not had sex at all, and your between those ages it almost definetly puberty. If your over those ages, then you might have contracted a penile infection. Which is almost exactly the same as a STD, except it doesn't have to be only sex transmitted.  It might not be that either, sometimes if your uncircumsised, poor penis cleaning can result in rashes, which are not contagious, you won't turn into a female, or anything extreme. Better cleansing of the penis can usually allow these rashes to heal within days. I would reccomend going to your doctor though if your over 15, just to be safe.|`|VhmBMJKxaa	Is is raised skin, like a line of tissue? Because that is quite common.    If you are not sexually active, then it is not an STD, as you said. As long as they do not hurt, you should be fine. But I would defenitely see a doctor if you experience any pain or the bumps get bigger.    It could also be a soap or lotion that you are using. The skin around the genitals is very sensitive.|`|LXxIxf13aa	may be a rash or hair is growing|`|CpILgVA8aa	Someone probably raped you|`|sCCjAKllaa	It sounds like some bumps.
nnBAnBOlaa	The FDA site has a list of the recalled products.
f4doqdSCaa	Stress could cause this, but it could also be something more serious, so you really do need to see a doctor, asap. Try a free clinic or something, but best to get things checked out. Always better safe than sorry. Could be a hormonal imbalance, cysts, fibroids, any number of things, but yes, you should be concerned, as obviously this is not normal.|`|MZMwJwDGaa	wowwww you NEED TO see someone PRONTO!|`|PkauhFMwaa	Nahh, I wouldn't be scared. I had the exact same thing happen to me, but I'm only 16. I went to the doctor, and she ended up putting me on birth control because she said it would 'control' my periods, and keep them on date.

Bleeding for that long is very irregular and unhealthy. You may have a hormonal imbalance which requires medical correction.  Constant bleeding is also an early warning sign of ovarian cancer, which would also be a medical concern.

It could be nothing but it is too risky to gamble. If money is a factor, you can always go to planned parenthood or a local clinic.     There are other people who experience this.

I have been dealing with weight problems for awhile now. I used to be your size than i started gaining weight for no reason and now i weigh 215. It sucks just be thankful you are healthy.|`|2d2b94501de98ea128e0950dfa1aea5caa	OK, obviously the doctor is focusing on the numbers, not looking at you personally. According to the BMI index, you do need to watch it. However, muscle weighs more than fat, and it sounds like you lead a healthy lifestyle, which means your weight is probably fine.|`|ZiHcxJv7aa	Dont get obssed with it OK, you`re fine. At first i though you are over weight, cuz i am 5.9 and my ideal weight is 140.   But since you are working out,that is muscle and that is good. I gained wight when i started working out too,and i was like ,WTF. but then, i asked this trainer @the gym an he told to not worry, cuz  that is muscle mass. ;)|`|QK5oaL4oaa	Your BMI is in the normal range even if you weigh 150. I'm sure you don't look overweight. I would suggest getting a new doctor. Personally, I've never had a doctor who would tell me to lose weight if I didn't need to, but I've heard other people who say that happened to them. When my mom was in her 20s, 120-130lbs and 5'5" one doctor told her to watch her weight, and she was disgusted.     Doctors are people too, subject to their own crazy biases. If you exercise that much, I'm sure you're fine. (Weight fluctuation isn't that great for your health, but exercising is a great way to maintain weight). If possible, I'd suggest getting a new doctor. If you would rather not, politely tell him/her that your weight is in the normal range and that you exercise frequently, and you would rather focus on more important health issues.|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	I think your weight is fine ?
R6IYY4miaa	A sleep hangover is a feeling that is similar to a hangover that you get when you have either woken up in the middle of your sleep cycle or when you have slept for way too long. An example of a time when you would get this would be sleeping a full eight or nine hours and then taking a three or four hour nap.
ub6641d2aa	I am in the same position as you. I am on Academic Warning, and I think Im on my way to failing out of college. I probably don't even have a 1.5 GPA right now. I was so suicidal last semester. I tried to slit my wrists so many times. Its embarrassing walking around campus and going to classes because I know that they can see the scars on my arms and they just know whats wrong with me. I stopped going to class because I thought people were judging me and I hated It. I was so stressed that I didn't eat at all and all i did was sleep around 12-13 hours a day. Not really much of a life. I feel the same way you do. I am diagnosed as schizo-affective which pretty much means that   im screwed.   I have a hard time talking to others like you.   My mom had to make all my appointments, I couldn't do it.  I have trouble talking to the cashier at Wendy's.  I know its hard right now, but I have found out that suicide is not the answer. I would try going to a doctor. I did and I am now on medicine and I am feeling alot better. I now have A's in all my classes and I am on my way to getting my degree in Psychiatry.    if you ever need to talk to someone that understands and knows what you re going through, feel free to email me anytime. I will try my best to help.  cassandra_m16@yahoo.com|`|BtDGWKSNaa	i have trouble seeking help as well.  but it seems to me as if you are suffering greatly, and you really do need to talk to someone about this.  maybe have your roommate come down with you to schedule an appointment.|`|QFf9phAmaa	suicide is no answer. try to make friends in your surrounding or try social helps to needy. visit a blind school,orphanage like institutions and try to learn them you will feel refreshed because you are better than them.|`|3aOCjv3qaa	Your University should have a psychologist or psychiatrist on site. I strongly recommend you visit that person. Also, I would consider the option of going to a community college. I was accepted to a top university but decided on community college instead. I got into an even better university thanks to that.    Whatever you do, don't choose suicide.|`|mYowSmC2aa	Coming from a "survivor", it's really not worth it to try and take your life. I myself actually attempted suicide back in High School for the same reasons you are feelings depressed and more. I put myself in a hospital ended up getting my stomach pumped and other things. It wasn't pretty... But after that moment is when I realized by trying that I not only hurt myself but everyone that cared about me. I didn't realize there were so many people that cared until afterwards. Believe it or not... There are people out there that love you and care about you... Maybe  you just need a break from college to figure out exactly what you want in life. Or maybe you should change schools, join some clubs. You can always meet friends in clubs =] If you EVER need to vent here is my myspace link... feel free to write me anytime!!! www.myspace.com/xxbtwxluckyxuxx    Just don't give up!!!! Everything will get better eventually.... Try checking out the other sites I sent you. STAY STRONG!!!!|`|yazZH4khaa	You answered your own questions in your last 3 sentences. You CAN and you HAVE TO!!! I just finished college and know how rough it can be. I also have GAD and social phobia- clinically diagnosed that is.   Please just get the guts to go and talk with your school counselor. What do you have to lose at this point in your life? Maybe this depression has manifested itself, and is limiting your true ability to study. Your counselor will probably tell you to visit a psychiatrist, and do so. I used to think that I would never have to go there, or never go if I had to. Well, a few years ago I gave in because life had me by the throat. I ended up on a SNRI and benzodiazepine and have felt 100% better. I still have days where I feel totally crappy and want to give up, but I attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. I used to be hooked on booze, methamphetamines, cocaine, weed, etc. Having any type of social network is crucial for everyone who is putting themselves out there for others. We have a doctor and a psychiatrist involved in AA; yes, they are in recovery also.   Do not be afraid because there are literally millions of people that suffer from mental disorders. Many of them never get the proper help needed, and they continue to suffer. Why suffer when there is help? Then you can get your focus back and get those good grades that you are capable of earning. This may seem impossible right now because I am making sense, so make some sense for yourself and just go talk to the right people. I did not type this for my health. It is because I care about you and I do not even know you. My email is available, so let me know how things are going with your therapist. I can even help because I have a psychology degree and have my own issues to deal with. Who better to listen to; someone who has the same problems?!

A previous answer follows:  STUDY TIPS:  See study, exam tips, and memory improvement in sections 13, & 41, at ezy-build, and find your learning style, and adapt. Join, or start study groups. Having a good, or at least, a well ordered memory makes study much easier, and less frustrating, so check out the memory improvement section in some detail. Motivation is addressed in section 28.     Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements*, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. Alternatively, you could go to the searchbar at http://www.mercola.com and enter: "krill oil". While you are there, enter "nutritional type", and eat more in accordance with yours. Exercise moderately, for 30 - 60 mns, daily. Google: "nootropics".     The supplements, DHEA & Phosphatidyl Serine are some that I have been informed are worth trying. Ginkgo biloba is often recommended, but has mixed reviews, so check the comparative strength, and buy from a health food, or vitamin store; ask what feedback they have been getting, and what else they suggest (write down, and check them out, later, through Google, WebFerret, or your search engine, before buying).

M7pYK1rJaa	Sometimes it's hard to figure it out without asking. So if you're going to ask, here's some tried-and-true advice:  I know this sounds really silly, but my doctor (who's currently 6 months pregnant) said that the nicest way anyone's asked her was by saying, "Cristin, have you lost weight?" She said that you can't go wrong with that one! It's always a compliment, no matter if the woman's fat, pregnant, or really did lose weight. If she's pregnant, she'll probably just laugh and see that you were trying to ask without offending her, while if she's fat, she'll think it's a compliment.|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Tony, that is one place you never want to go.  Don't ever ask a girl when the baby is due.  Chances are you will be wrong every time and will just hurt the feelings of someone that has put on some weight.

nnBAnBOlaa	It may be worthwhile to see another eye doctor, especially a pediatric ophthalmologist. The quote is from the 3rd source.      "Previously, eye care professionals often thought that treating amblyopia in older children would be of little benefit. However, surprising results from a nationwide clinical trial show that many children age seven through 17 with amblyopia may benefit from treatments that are more commonly used on younger children. This study shows that age alone should not be used as a factor to decide whether or not to treat a child for amblyopia."|`|iqGaNZTtaa	Ask a good ophthalmologist.

I understand that you need a stress reliever, but trying to get lung cancer is only going to add stress...not now, but 20 years or so from now, when you have a spouse and a child, and find out that you have a "spot on your lung".  A GREAT stress reliever is exercise.  It truly relieves you, while doing something good for your body.  Take up running, or tennis, or maybe join a swim team at school.  It will give you another focus rather than your problems, and it will encourage you to take care of your body rather than choose an activity that will cause health problems.|`|SU8z0TUoaa	As little as you are smoking, it is nothing to worry about. And 15 is plenty old enought o smoke anyway.|`|r1KTZBkraa	Smoking is bad for you at any age no matter what. It doesn't matter if you don't do it that often becuase it could still kill you.|`|aOcfAdevaa	You might develop lung cancer at an early age...if you were a boy i would say you become impotent by the time you're married..if you're smoking just smoke marijuana and quit the cigarettes..all the tar and nicotine|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	If you're going to smoke cigarettes, smoke the all natural kind, they don't have all the additives that the major cigarette companies put in theirs.   http://www.nascigs.com/?ticket_guid=08a5...|`|70c1c2e410f2cdd8e3cd8235784e9689aa	BAD BAD BAD.  First, it's illegal.  Want to go to jail over it?  Second, do you want the person who is supplying you to go to jail over it?  Third, there are many many other ways to destress.  You might not be "addicted" now, but you will be soon.|`|yUnQahGoaa	It's a horrible idea. B/C soon it'll turn into a few times a week then everyday and then all day everyday. That's how I started when I was 14. I'm 22 now and I wished I never started. I've been trying to quit and unsuccessful since I was 17. It's not something you want to do, so take advice from me don't do it! It's not good for you, it makes you smell bad it looks at bad at work and everything else and it's not healthy. Stop now while you can and never pick another one up!!!|`|9EdJHqKHaa	I am a smoker. It's a gross habit. I smoked since I was 13, and I will say this much, even if your body is young enough to heal from the damage of smoking, if you start now, even just once a week, it will escalate as you get older. I'm 25 now, and I still smoke. Everyone starts off smoking once a week or so, but it doesn't stop there. If you only smoke occasionally then your not addicted yet, so if I were you I'd stop now before it gets that far.|`|vbAlVxtBaa	if you arent addicted stop smoking cancer sticks just smoke weed its a lot  better for you a lot more relaxing and a lot healthier|`|Rg71zzjDaa	You fool. Stop while you might be able to. Smoking any amount f*cks up your lungs. Cigarettes are addictive, your fooling yourself. Keep smoking and take 15 to 20 years off your life. Cigarettes make you and everything you own stink. Slap yourself in the face and wake up!|`|gXne4VJcaa	Smoking isn't safe at any age. My advise to you, I am a smoker and I wish I would have NEVER started the habit. Once a week will turn into once a day, and one a day will turn into one an hour. I would steer clear of the cigs!|`|TX5uV9bIaa	The safest and best thing you could do 'to blow off a little stress' would be to exercise:  walk, run, jog, go to the gym, do an aerobics tape.  It actually processes the stress hormones and elevates your metabolism.  It also gets oxygen to your body and brain to help you deal with the issues.    I have never smoked, but my mother died of tongue cancer (from smoking) AFTER she went blind from AMD (also aggravated by smoking).  HER father was a doctor and died of esophageal cancer...after his best friend missed the diagnosis.    So I come from the shallow-end of the gene pool, where people die and go blind from smoking.  Makes it kind of hard to hear anyone thinks it's "safe".   I wish you a long life and peace.|`|vg1WARiIaa	you dont have to do any drugs to rget rid of stress. i know it feels that way (trust me i do im 15 also) just dont smoke, or do marijuanna or any of that bull crap other teens think is "cool" i mean really wtf is "cool" about dying at al early age and KILLING the ONLY BODY you will EVER get. Just for the sake of you life and those who care about you, dont smoke.      and to answer your question incase you didint get it from what i sai above YES it IS bad for you to smoke at that age...or ANY age for that matter.    i hope i helped you.  Have a great LONG life =P|`|JW0qV2cZaa	Yes you are like way smarter than a goat. Have you read what you wrote? Smoking is great for your skin btw!|`|AA12157801	You have just shortened your life by about 10 years, your lungs are starting to decay and will be caked with black tar, you will most likely be diagnosed with cancer in the future, your breath smells horrible, your teeth will be stained forever yellow, the dependency on nicotine will grow as you waste your money on cigarettes, and your life will spiral downwards into an abyss. Happy camping!|`|wbfBciSuaa	regardless of age, smoking isnt healthy. maybe you should try yoga or something to relieve your stress. yoga may benefit you physically and mentally. whereas ciggarettes will help you clear your head out maybe, but it is bad for your health.|`|3t9vHGdtaa	cigarettes are not the safest thing there one of the worst!|`|k0IuhwBSaa	I would not smoke if i were you because as time passes you will get addicted to it and it will become a very bad habbit..try doing something else to releive your stress like talking to someone or writing all of your feelings into a journal..try talking to your parents/guardian about this!|`|wa401B0raa	Don't do it there are many bad side effects. read thishttp://freehosting.tomaweb.com/quitsmoki...|`|iF5CS457aa	Don't smoke.    Seriously, haven't you ever seen a truth commercial? they'll called TRUTH for a reason.    AT ANY AGE, a young age is even worse!!!!|`|ELT9FldJaa	Never, ever, EVER do smoking to relieve stress. It doesn't. In the end, you'll only end up with more. And sure, you'll start only smoking once a week, but then you'll do it more, then BOOM - you're addicted.  And I wouldn't recommend it to anyone your age, and even anyone any age. Smoking is horrible for your health and your mind state.  Don't go down that road. Listen to music or do yoga or dance to relieve stress.|`|C4LT48CFaa	It is very bad because there is a good chance you will get hooked on cigarettes, after smoking for a while it will make you look aged when you get into your 20's.  It causes tiny wrinkles and makes your skin begin to sag.  Also most guys avoid dating girls who smoke unless they smoke too.  The smoker's cough is not sexy.    Try something else other than smoking to relieve stress, maybe exercise or writing about it?  Otherwise as an adult whenever you get stressed out you will want to smoke and that is not a good feeling because there are few places you can smoke as an adult.|`|j58h6NDiaa	Most people will tell you that it's really bad.  Do you really need someone to tell you the negative effect of smoking?    In reality though it doesn't matter much.  I remember being around that age and many people smoked.  Some I'm sure still smoke, but many have quit.      If you're really concerned about your health though, you'll find a better way to deal with stress.  I also think 15 years old is too young to be dating if it's considered a source of stress.  Figure out how to deal with it now, or your life is going to be a mess when you get older.    Also in response to whoever said it was illegal, it's illegal to sell to minors or let them smoke, but the laws are all designed to protect minors so it's actually not illegal for the minor.  Similar to how having sex while underage is only illegal if the other person is an adult, because the law is designed to protect minors.|`|yptfd3sIaa	I detest ambivalent answers. You are causing arterial (blood vessels, veins, arteries) damage. You are causing damage to the mood receptors in your brain.

I know life can be hard at times. Everyone has felt what you are feeling at some point in their lives.  There are far healthier means of relief of stress: try running, swimming, sports, taking up a hobby, or if you really feel the temptation for a vice, drink a little bit.  its still bad, but not nearly as habit-forming or bad for your body.  Trust me, drop that cigarette now while you still can!!|`|rbwgOoMHaa	It's bad for you to smoke at ny age!!! Smoking causes so many horrible and painful diseases like heart, lung, and mouth cancer. It also slows you down and causes terrible coughing. It also hurts people around you. If children breath in your second hand smoke, they can get black lung too! My advice, quit smoking forever!|`|uL7H0uouaa	Do not smoke, do not buy cigs, unless you want to help Comrade Obama's plan for SCHIP, of course the US will need 24 million more smokers to fund this,...but if not ,...then they will just raise the taxes on everyone,...yummy:)    Which they were going to do anyway,...enjoy|`|rl07Y2j9aa	Smoking is nasty at any age. The damage that happens to your body each time you have a cigarette cannot be erased. Quit now!     Try exercise to relieve stress.....it is much healthier. Yoga, dance, go for a walk, or just plain old jog around the house, so long as it is exercise it all works great! Don't worry if you don't have a dance or work out partner either....if you have a pet or a little brother or sister they think you are nuts when you do it alone and they love to join in or just watch....have fun.......no matter what you are doing ....exercise releases endorphins into your body which are feel good chemical messages....and they will relieve your stress and make you feel good.....|`|bwk2cXQ3aa	Smoking at any age is bad!

P7BQOKt3aa	Sometimes that can be a symptom of a urinary tract infection. However, I also get a similar feeling when I get constipated.|`|ZiHcxJv7aa	It could be the inflammation of the ovaries, cuz, thats where they are placed, around the pubic area.

Redness, itching, and a rash are common symtpoms. You can be a virgin and get these. My sister is a virgin and had one of these about a year ago. It was painful, sore, itchy and took awhile to go away. You'll be fine since you know it isn't a STD.|`|Q87xLOkdaa	Maybe it's cancer.|`|6lzTzT37aa	I get UTI's all the time. If that's what it is, you can make it go away by drinking a TON of water and cranberry juice (or taking cranberry pills) and eating yogurt. If you burn when you pee and feel like you have to go all the time, that's what it is.
GMBicsQVaa	Hi there!!!! I can tell you from being in sports all through high school not to worry. It's just your muscles being sore. I would take motrin first because it is an anti-inflammatory as well as advil. Aleve is as well, but you can only take it twice a day so if the pain comes back your out of luck where as the motrin can be taken every six hours. I would also take three or four over the counter motrin because that is equal to the prescription dose so it saves you a trip to the doctors.(The bottle will say to only take one or two.) In between doses if that still does not cut it, you can take two extra strength tylenol. Tylenol is totally different from motrin, advil or aleve because it is not an anti- inflammatory it is simply just a pain reliever. Don't worry about mixing the tylenol and the motrin either because that is what my doctor told me to do when my daughter was teething and she was only 1. Finally if that still isn't working use some ben-gay muscle rub on your sore spots. Remember...the more your active the better it will get...it won't be like this forever your body will get used to the activity and you will feel healthier. Let me know how it goes!!!!!|`|zoEvwmXCaa	You're muscles are sore.  Stretch them and the pain will cease.
ZIq2IzOmaa	If you have an infection, you do not need to remove your jewelry. Infections are treated with anti-biotics and proper cleaning of the area.     You do need to find quality jewelry that won't irritate your piercings, like surgical steel or titanium. You can find these at many body piercers or online.     Taking your jewelry out is not going to cure an infection. You need to see a piercer or a doctor for advice on treatment.     Once you have your infection cleared up, you need to clean your plugs every day or so (depending on your ears and what you're wearing), avoid touching your piercings with dirty hands, and allow enough time between stretches for your ears to stretch without tearing.     Talk to a piercer about how to fix up your ears. Don't just take your jewelry out and hope it goes away.|`|HUAYinN7aa	Yeah, if you want to start over once the infection is gone you'll have to go back to a smaller size because they will have already began to heal.|`|yazZH4khaa	It depends how long they are out actually.

FicyC2TXaa	At 16 your chances of having breast cancer are close to zero.    It's mainly a disease of ageing: 80% of those diagnosed are over 50, only around 5 % are under 40 and 0.1% under 30, and it's almost unheard of in under 25s.    Most breast lumps, even in women over 50, aren't cancerous, and many women have naturally lumpy breasts.

CciXZNYraa	Here are a few tips;    WHEN to eat for losing weight...     ? Eat (at least) three times a day.   Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course)   ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try.   OK, one apple after 18:00   ? Don't starve   Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health.   Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet.   ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.    WHAT to drink for losing weight...     ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day !   Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water!   This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks!   Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys.   ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed!   Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions.   ? Avoid those vending machines by carrying around your own healthful foods and leaving pocket change at home.    Exercise for losing weight...     ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good.   ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts...   I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss...   ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants!   ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.        Good luck!|`|90fb63f274c2515e9f3b2df5cb52d158aa	if you want to lose weight you need to stop eating junk food, get exercise and eat healthy food, you night not think your losing weight but wait a month or 2 and you'll see a big difference|`|9XmJPjXvaa	get the right diet. since you already taken fitness class your diet is the one you should worry about|`|VSloQ8KDaa	More power to you! good that you have decided to exercise on your own. Just make sure to exercise regularly and eat in small frequent portions. It is best if you have an exercise buddy for motivation.      example of a healthy meal:    oatmeal- breakfast  2 1/2 hours later  mixed fruits(yum)-snack   2 1/2 hours later  chicken salad(no dressing) mixed with nuts( healthy fat)  2 1/2 hours later  1 cup of cucumbers with lemon ( no salt)  2 1/2 hours later  pasta with an orange and SMALL peice of bread  2 1/2 hours later  yogurt|`|NaebmeYQaa	first of all you want to start with a colon cleanse or hydrotherapy this is not a joke most people have 5-15 pounds of undigested food in their colon get a minimum of 3 colonics this dramatically reduces the gut did you know if you are not having three bowel movments a day you are in fact constipated so this is number one. Make sure you are drinking enough water pure never tap at least 8 8 ounce glass a day this sounds crazy but most people are dehydrated and dont even know. Switch to 100% organic food your energy will be great and make sure you stop eating at least 3hrs before bed these are just a few things to start with and I know organic food is more expensive so here is a link to help and maybe help with other things   http://thejayway.maverick66.hop.clickban...

Weed is not dangerous, unless the ***** *** police get involved...|`|Jime0cdqaa	You should google the effects of marijuana, it can be dangerous. The herbal Ecstasy cigarettes are super gross and still bad for you but not as bad (I don't think) as regular ones. The reason being that they likely have less of the added crap that regular ones add. Your best bet is to look into each of these things individually.
gXne4VJcaa	Try to look for an Urgent Care/Walk in only clinic. Most towns have one, they are convenient and usually not to pricey.

COFPXYvZaa	work out and gain muscle. muscle weighs more than fat, so your weight will go up (and you won't be skinny, and you'll get stronger). work out in your school weight room or go to a gym. but DON'T go out eating fast food and f--king your body up. eat a regular 3-square-meal diets. they don't have to be big and full of food, but should at least supply you with nutrients (and to keep you from starving)    EDIT: I will agree with sexyslim that if you start working out a lot (lifting weights, treadmill, etc.), your appetite WILL increase. I always come from from the gym looking for something to eat. that almost never happened before I got my 24hr fitness membership. :D|`|oTHGgowsaa	You've got the same body type as me haha. It's not simple, you have to know what to eat, how much, and how often. Also, if you don't want your extra weight to turn into fat, you need to work out either to build muscle or just to burn off calories. Eat lots of calories, eat about six 500 calorie meals per day, more carbs and protein than fat. Protein and carbs both contain 4 calories per gram, while fat contains 9 calories per gram. Just get more calories than your body needs, I love bodybuilding, and there's a free program online at www.fitday.com which lets you keep track of how many calories your getting, what kind, and how much your burning and how your burning them. If you want to build muscle you should be getting 0.88 to 2 grams of protein per pound you weigh DAILY. And be sure to work these proteins into repairing and therefore building muscle tissue so it doesn't go to fat. Unsaturated fats like olive oil etc. are good for getting some quick calories, but try to eat lots of animal byproducts. Also, if your having trouble getting that many grams of protein per day, you might want to consider a suppliment. There are all natural ones like 100% whey protein, and that way you can get the protein you need. If you want e-mail me (thefreshprinceofvernon@hotmail.com) I'd be happy to e-mail you a list of weight-gaining foods and ways to work them into muscle|`|ycaloVnkaa	Gaining weight is about putting more calories in you than ur burning off. Start eating about 6 meals aday. They should be healthy meals such as veges, fruits and protein with a moderate ammount of carbs. Join the gym and lift weights. There is no real easy way of gaining weight other than eating alot and lifting heavy in the gym so u can gain muscles instead of fat.|`|VSloQ8KDaa	okay eat junk food....jk  i think you goal should be to tone up your body. That way you can have mucles too. Not just be gaining weight. If you want to gain weight make sure you eat three times a day and just eat a little more than the normal.|`|b3c2cbfebbcf569b9df31dc1b85a83d1aa	I was in the same boat, 135 lbs and basically was never hungry and was eating enough to get by but not gain anything.  Fast metabolism certainly wasn't helping either.  Once I seriously decided to start working out, like 5-6 times a week, my appetite increased immensely.  Now I have no problem putting away 3000 food calories a day.  Just eat a high protein high carb low fat diet, and lots of it.  If you can get yourself in a serious workout routine, you might want to look into something like Mass XXX.  This adds about 1000 calories on top of the food calories.  When I started taking that, I gained about 10 lbs in the first 1.5-2 months of use.  Gotta warn you though, gaining weight is not cheap.  I eat like $120 worth of groceries a week and that's not counting the GNC supplements which are quite expensive.|`|l3rn0xwtaa	Seefood diet.  If you see it, you eat it.  You've got all the testosterone you need.  Now you need, I'm not joking, about 5,000 to 6,000 calories a day in food. That plus a good gym workout routine will put about 5 pounds of muscle on a month.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Gaining weight & muscle is a two step process: you have to eat more and lift weights or engage in some sort of strength training routine.    The most important rule to remember if you want to gain weight is to eat more calories than you burn. Only by doing this can your body use the excess energy to build muscle. If you eat less than you burn, there is no way to gain weight, it's as simple as that. Your first step is to figure out how many calories your body burns per day. Use this calculator http://calorieneedscalculator.com  to get an estimate. Now eat more than you burn and you're on your way to gaining muscle.    Gaining weight is as simple as eat more than you burn but if you want to gain muscle, you also need to exercise. If you just ate more without lifting weights, you'd just gain fat and become unhealthy and overweight. When you lift weights (or participate in any strength training) you're actually causing some damage to your muscles.     When you rest, your body uses those extra calories to repair and rebuild the muscles. When this process is complete, the muscle is stronger and a bit bigger than it was before. You obviously won't notice a difference right away, but over time you will find yourself becoming stronger and bigger.    You need to keep your diet clean to gain the right kind of weight. Stay away from sugary and simple carb foods such as candy, foods made with white flour, soda and other junk. These foods will promote fat storage, something you don't need. Stick to foods made from whole wheat flour, oats, brown rice, lean sources of protein (chicken, some cuts of beef, fish), nuts, beans, legumes and protein shakes - yum yum. If you need more details, go to the Guide to Gaining Muscle -  http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/g...|`|BFLLJc7eaa	you can drink protein shakes. they dont taste bad. its what football players use and body builders use to get bigger. im on a Oreo one its 2000 calories. you can get it from your local vitamin shoppe. or whatever they are called where you live.|`|AA11098301	Eat more carbs.  Pasta, bread, etc.|`|XNx2PbIvaa	Your body has a natural body weight if you are at that weight then it will be hard to gain or lose weight. The best thing is to add muscle mass by lifting weights also you are only 14 that is a normal weight you will gain some as you get older.|`|0vX9yIoQaa	To gain weight and be healthy you need to consume more calories than you burn them every day from healthy, protein enriched, and nutritious foods and choose the right types of exercise.   Exercise a little like mild weightlifting so as to feel hungry, to eat more balanced food and to develop muscle.   Take tuna, salmon, flax and walnuts. They contain healthy fats like omega-3.   Take meat, fish, poultry, nuts, and legumes. They contain protein.   Take fruits, vegetables and whole grains. They contain carbohydrates.
Z82og7b7aa	The only healthy way to lose weight is simply exercise and healthy foods such as your fruit and veg, not many carbohydrates or foods with great amounts of fat :) i always used to use diets such a slim fast and all that but once i stopped using them my weight went back on straight away. These days i just eat smaller portions, and healthier foods and exercise and i have kept my weight off for a couple of months now :). All you need is the determination and will power :) Try and stick well within your 2000 calories per day aswel :) which you will easily do if you change your eating habits :). Also, if you try not eating your body will hold on to the fat for longer as your not feeding yourself and as a result of this your bones will weaken and you will be unhealthy aswel.    I hope this helps you :)|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn).     Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out http://calorieneedscalculator.com The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.    Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - http://straightdiet.com|`|pDGVTLoFaa	The reason diets do not work is that people deprive themselves of food and do exercises that will not fit into their daily lives they also want a 2quick fix" such as pills that do not work and are expensive. The way to lose weight successfully and to keep it off is to ignore shakes from weight watchers and the like and to gradually increase exercises into your day such as walking part or all the way to school just make sure you get to leave the house earlier and to eat normal foods but less reduce your intake every day but allow yourself to enjoy what you do eat if you have an attack of the munchies choose fruit to replace crisps and sweets but do not deny yourself completely. Aim to lose 1 to 2ibs per week as this is the natural healthy way and indeed only way.|`|uGVGmAbXaa	im only 13 but my mom nows i think i can tell you uhh my mom eats nothin but helthie organic foods and walks 5000 steps a day hope this helped bye!|`|78wnyPvZaa	hey if your not eating anything right now you may aswell try like a shake diet , i tried lipotrim last year , it was a bit hard but ya kinda get used to it , basically its 3shakes a day for women and 2 for men , or ya can have like soups , but i thought they were horrible ... anyway my first week i lost half a stone , its really effective if you stick to it but it is really hard, like your not allowed any food at all and your only allowed water or tea with no milk or sugar ! my two older brothers are obese and they both used it and lost about 8stone between them , they are still overweight now but there getting there like , it really gave them a headstart ! if you dont wanna do something drastic id suggest weightwatchers , you should lose up to 5 pounds the first week and 1-2 pounds every week after that :) good luck x|`|NKcKzPskaa	Calories is a large topic when it comes to weight loss. We need to know three things: the amount of calories in our food, the amount of calories a specific physical action expends every sixty minutes, and last but not least our own personal daily allowance of calories. The sole thing that definitely showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials left, it was featured in Reader's Digest and CNN. I shed 20 pounds, it definitely does produce success!|`|95s0Dlg9aa	What do you like to do physically? I didn't try to phrase that dirtily.  But do you like jogging? Sports, yoga. You can get tapes, a treadmill even b/c going to the gym all the time can get pricey. But if you like what your doing when working out there's a way less chance of quitting.  Eat healthy, if you just get rid of all the crappy stuff in your pantry and fridge, get stuffed before going to the market and try to put more vegetables in your life, you don't even need to workout. G.i. diet works good. It's like a 25 dollar book. Good luck. People differ, sometimes you gain muscle and gain or don't lose anything, or you eat some horribly unhealthy foods and gain. No, you don't need to workout like crazy. But if your stuffed, stop eating. Diets don't work, you give up on them. Just change the way you eat.|`|Rs2C52tAaa	Hi,    Well...    Make sure you don't over-eat. So when you eat only eat a little bit bit then eat more if you feel a bit more hungry. This because when you `scoff` yourself down with food, it takes 15-20 minutes to for your brain to realise that your food has digested and that you are full up. But when you have over-eaten then you feel a bit bloated because you have eaten too much... so then your stomach expands... and this carries on. So don't over eat.    For lunch take salad... or fruit. For tea have Milk and yoghurt or just ONE biscuit with low calories- (try 5 a day).    Instead of walking upstairs and downstairs, run upstairs and downstairs a couple of times then try to miss a step and run-up etc.    I hope that helps.x.
P8mwdv9xaa	The Doctor will probably tell you it will go away on its own, but see him anyway.|`|pXPdO2I8aa	No need to worry! Its a virus which will clear up(eventually) on its own.  You can have a good time squeezing the spots after a bath with clean hands-dont spread it around though-wash your hands after squeezing and put the dirty tissues in the bin.    Found the below info on  http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/2306896...  There is a good chance that a molluscum will go within 2-4 weeks after being firmly squeezed. If you do try squeezing treatment at home:  If you squeeze by using fingernails, ideally, do it whist wearing rubber or latex gloves to avoid spread of the virus. Wash your hands before and after squeezing.  It is best to squeeze mollusca after a bath, when they are softer.  Limit to a few mollusca at any one time.  Wipe up carefully and throw away the white curd-like material that comes from the centre of each molluscum as it contains infective virus.  If you use forceps or tweezers then sterilise them afterwards by putting them in boiling water or antiseptic

We keep a bowl of them at the front desk and clients are often surprised how good they taste (many times, they weren't even aware the candy was sugar free).|`|DzyCjYToaa	no, cos they have soo many chemicals put in them...  and they are soo expensive  anyway, it makes the idea of a treat non existent  so normal chocolate is the way to go!!|`|Mu6E3SF2aa	ewwwww no  besides it fun to be a diabetic bouncing off the walls from sugar  lol|`|utqHTagcaa	As long as the chocolates are from http://www.amberlynchocolates.com.

ee2ce7f4a4671d3a72fbfecf0348ee49aa	drink water at least 64 ounces it is absolutely necessary for fat burnig (chemically speaking) also eat a balanced diet whole wheat is the best, but don't wipe out your carbs still used the classic food pyramid but avoid all white pastas and breads (replace with wheat)  read up on your glycemic index it will explain better eating habbits.  Also you will gain weight for the first 3 months or so of training most people do.  Do not use your weight as an indicator of health it is misleading use your waist measurement in inches.  and start every moring with a 30min jog at least and move up from there.|`|BFLLJc7eaa	well. working out adds weight dont forget. protein shakes give 1000-7000 calories. since wrestling season is over im not really watching my weight im just working out but your should be averaging 2000 calories a day to lose 1-2 pounds a week.|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	your 16. just chill out and enjoy life.|`|ztke9DOPaa	just let the diet take affect|`|l0NRdN3Faa	You're getting more carbs with the wheat cereal, you're going to gain weight before you lose it, especially if you went from not eating at all to eating all of this. It sounds healthy, just keep it up, you'll tone up quickly.|`|TkCIUNxdaa	You are working out way too much if you are trying to lose weight and tone up....you are building so much muscle, that is why you are gaining weight.... it is true that muscle weighs more than fat... you want to do a lot more cardio (treadmill, running, fast walking, Etc.) to burn off calories, at least three times a week for at least 20 minutes at a brisk pace.... your diet is pretty good, although you might want to add a bit more variety to it.  I would take two days off during the week and work each body grouping just once a week instead of two... that should get you on the right track!|`|mLabzxnIaa	Wow your workout routine sucks. Your supposed to work on everything about 3-4 days of the week.|`|usPXkxKraa	Starvation diets make you GAIN weight, because your body freaks and starts applying alot of stored fat...    Try not to do too many excersizes- your body needs rest, along with hearty foods. Also, your workouts look more muscle-based than weight-loss based- Ride a bike, get a treadmil, get active, not just muscle-toning :-D  Good luck!!|`|Tt83sT5Iaa	it will work, just give it time, its cos if u used to be on a starvation diet, your body is making the most of all the food yur giving it.. diets take time, but it will work good luck x
kgk3Yz9Naa	if he loves you then he wont even mention them.....|`|jK5FXm6Naa	This is tricky to answer.  If you want an honest answer then personally I would a little, but that's all down to what we expect women to look like from tv and magazines etc. If this guy really loves you then he should be ok with it.  I guess it's the same with women, I know someone who stopped having sex halfway through with this guy as his manhood was too small....it's cruel but people are easily led by things which aren't necessarily as important as they think.|`|hZWup7xXaa	it shouldn't, if he loves you than he shouldn't care any less about them, i have them all over me. to get rid of the colour in them put body butter on them every night or morning, it takes a couple of months for the colour to go away but they are alot harder to see once it is gone.  hope this helps and good luck :)|`|GqRNBTV9aa	90% of women have stretch marks and quite a few men.

Scars are a natural part of life and really your sexuality is controlled by your mind not your body.  Generally if you feel sexy your giving off more of a vibe than your body image.  Noone has perfect skin etc and if they have they've gotta be pretty dull wrapped up in cotton wool not wanting to live there life.  I've had 5 kids and have a big scar running down my spine. Boobs that you can tuck in and plenty of stretch marks and it matters nothing to my sex-life.  Love who you are.

Qh2rc1DNaa	Step 1  Get plenty of rest.    Step 2  Drink plenty of fluids. Suck on an ice cube or flavored ice, or drink iced fruit juice or chilled clear broth.    Step 3  Dress lightly and keep the room temperature between 70 and 74 degrees F. Use a blanket if you feel cold.    Step 4  Take anti-fever medicines only when necessary. For children under 18 years old, use acetaminophen or ibuprofen. For adults, use acetaminophen, aspirin or ibuprofen.    Step 5  Give a child a lukewarm sponge bath for a temperature higher than 102 degrees F, but wait 30 minutes if you have given her acetaminophen. Wipe the child with a lukewarm washcloth or place her in a lukewarm tub for 20 minutes, then dry her thoroughly and check her temperature. If it is lower than 102 degrees F, don't continue with the lukewarm baths. If the child is shivering, warm up the water by a few degrees for the next bath.    Step 6  Know your medications. Some drug allergies cause fevers. If you suspect that one of your prescription medications may be causing a fever, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.    Step 7  Spread lip balm or petroleum jelly over the lips during the fever and for several days thereafter, since lips often crack and split during a fever.|`|wwzoqIvVaa	Put him into cool water or bathe him with cool washcloths.

f0d9913ce405e7a9de76fe44dcf46013aa	Honey, as long as it isn't taking you away from your life (i.e. school work is failing, you aren't going out with friends, or you just stop functioning) then there is nothing wrong with it. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. It is a perfectly natural thing to do.     As to sex not being pleasurable because of excessive masturbation, that is an out right lie. In actuality I feel it makes sex better because you already know what you like and you can guide the special guy to just the right spots. Guys will appreciate this.    One word of caution. I would steer clear of large objects. I've heard of young girls attempting masturbation with shampoo bottles or even coke cans (ouch!) this could cause serious issues with infections and tearing. Just keep it small and go with what makes you happy.    Good luck|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. Masturbation isn't the same as being with someone else.

If a person does that for a tension/physical relief by just physical manipulation and concentrating on enjoying the sensations it is considered a lesser sin (Catholic church) but if those activities include fantasies/thoughts about a particular person then in spirit it is considered "spiritual fornication" or "spiritual adultery" since sin starts in the desires/heart.  It's considered that you have committed that act in spirit and the only thing missing for the "real sin" is the opportunity/circumstances. It is "desensitizing your conscience" to get you ready to do the REAL thing -that is the danger.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Of course it is, almost all girls masturbate and it's normal for virgins and non-virgins    Harriet|`|5c70e4a7234f0be8642df55ef4a96e46aa	Of course.. all men do it.

BKOgIfwHaa	I believe if you don't want /have to time to start with exercise immediately, than I would begin with eating alot of fruit and vegetables and drinking lots of water..just having a glass of water sitting by you at alltimes, you will be amazed at how often you reach for it and just sip on it. Still enjoy the meals you like say for lunch or supper and make the other two meals and snacks loaded with fruit and vegetables.

You can actually eat normally in terms of quantity and quality. The difference between before and now is that you are trying to reduce calories and that should only reflect in the amount of calories you take. So what you need to learn is the kind of foods you can afford to eat in quantities that satisfy your hunger without accumulating unwanted calories. Fatty foods contain the highest amounts of calories followed by sugary stuffs.     -Chicken and Fish contain lean protein and are excellent as part of your diet. All forms of white meat that contains very little amounts of cholesterol should be part of your diet.  -Fruits - Fruits are going to be your very good friend from now on.  -Beans- Beans is an excellent food for weight watchers. It contains a lot of proteins but also has some high amount of carbohydrate. So do not eat too much of it at a time.  -Acai Berries- Recently there is this new fruit from the Amazon now very popular ever since it appeared on Oprah show. It is a high fiber content fruit that helps to create quick satisfaction and you actually stop eating.      Exercise !    If you are yet to know that exercise is important for good health, you are already living a high risk lifestyle. It's true! If you don't know, it only means you have been doing all the wrong things all these years and your case must be looked into urgently. Your muscles will become flabby and weak. Your heart and lungs may fail to function properly. What you dont now is that, you can even afford to eat all the wrong foods if your are exercising regularly. That means, lack of exercise may be killing you more than the cigarette you are smoking.    Weight Loss- As you must have heard before, you can not loss weight without exercises. It is improper to try to loss weight on diet alone. Exercise is responsible for burning your body fat to help you loss the it. Exercise is also a key to weight control because it burns calories.

That's probably because you tried to do too much. Just commit to 15 minutes a day. That's not hard at all. And don't do anything intense, especially for the first month. Take it easy -- do a few crunches, a few push ups, jog in place for a few minutes. If you do this every day, you'll burn 100-150 calories, depending on your size and metabolism.      ?  Replace a fatty snack with veggies. Potato chips, fries, anything that's greasy -- those are laden with calories. Fat is the most calorie-filled food type there is. If you eat a snack like this every day, replace it with cut-up carrots, broccoli, celery, or a salad (with low-fat dressing, not anything fatty).      ?  Have sex daily. One of the best exercises there is. Of course, you'll need to do it beyond your usual three minutes. If you can get 15 minutes of sex in a day, you can burn 150 calories. You also might need to find a willing partner. The exercise in the item above might help with that.
Aej3lgQZaa	He may be accusing you of being bulimic? Bulimics experience a lot of acid erosion due to vomit having a very low pH due to stomach acid.     Acid erosion can occur very quickly or very slowly. Depends on the frequency and strength of acid it is exposed to.     Dentin exposure is a clear sign of acid erosion.     It really does sound to me like your doctor is saying you are bulimic. I suppose avoiding acidic foods would also help. You don't have acid erosion without having acids in the mouth, so if it wasn't from food coming out then it is from food going in, although food going in doesn't have the extremely low pH that stomach acid does.|`|k4lDRT8eaa	well i myself have acid erosion and its quite embarrasing as my teeth are yellow due to over brushing, i would say use a soft brittle brush and if u are drinkin any fizzy drinks or orange juice try to use a straw or just chug it all in in big gulps. Sooner or later you will need caps or veneers caps are better, if you already have these then just get them fixed every so often. But it just means that if it was continous then you WOULD still have some teeth yet but they wud be very sensitive  if not sore  and very discoloured.

yDJiiqcsaa	While it's true that depression can strike at any age it seems prevalent at the onset of puberty. Hormones are STRONG chemicals and especially troublesome is the situation for females since there are several competing hormones that change regularly over the cycle.  This constant turmoil of hormones seems to cause a corresponding emotional roller coaster until the equilibrium is established.  Hormones don't simply regulate "plumbing" operations - they modify brain chemistry and thought processes.|`|8pw8qDjPaa	Any age. Depression can affect even a 7 year old or younger, it doesnt have to be just teenagers or adults.|`|91OVJtgPaa	I believe it depends on their life style.

Qh2rc1DNaa	You need to calculate your basal metabolic rate:    BMR Calculator    You use energy no matter what you're doing, even when sleeping. The BMR Calculator will calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR); the number of calories you'd burn if you stayed in bed all day.    If you've noticed that every year, it becomes harder to eat whatever you want and stay slim, you've also learnt that your BMR decreases as you age. Likewise, depriving yourself of food in hopes of losing weight also decreases your BMR, a foil to your intentions. However, a regular routine of cardiovascular exercise can increase your BMR, improving your health and fitness when your body's ability to burn energy gradually slows down.|`|aeVz0lrBaa	Depends on what you do. If you work on a building site then you will burn more than a person who works in an office and sits at a computer all day long.
jeztbF6naa	well...  i wouldn't recommend eating all that junk they advertise on tv. just simple stuff you don't have to wipe out all the junk food in your diet just limit your portions. stay way from all the greasy foods..fast food especially. its bad for your heart.   1. salad  2. milk  3. vegetables  4. blueberries (proven to help score higher on tests)  5. maybe smoothie shakes  6. vitamins  i wouldn't really see a need to seek a nutritionist for this that will just cost you alot of money and the same answers you can get from others. just keep it simple. you can eat junk food but cut down on your portions like instead of getting cheese sticks or fries as an appetizer get a salad. just think right.    god bless and good luck  brooke|`|zoH6rMCPaa	Fruits|`|nAvTMXmgaa	broccoli, tomatoes, carrots, belt pepper(every color), onions, garlic, sweet potatoes, potatoes.

Stick to a low fat diet and almost no saturated fat (cheese), whole grains, low fat protein (grilled chicken, fish, yogurt, soy, beans), give up butter and mayo and replace with olive oil.  Read nutrition labels on everything you eat.  Eat a lot of vegetables and no soda.  Drink water and 100% fresh juice.  No fried or fast food.   Everything you eat shouldd have some nutritional value.  Unlike carbs, these foods will keep you feeling full longer.  Snack on almonds (high in good fat and protein) instead of chips.  Eat triscuits with hummus.  Change your eating lifestyle and you body will adjust|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	Besides fruits, I'd recommend you eat any type of vegetables, lean meats (turkey, chicken breast), whole grains (wheat bread, wheat pasta), beans, low fat dairy (yogurt, milk, cheese), and make sure to drink plenty of water. Taking a multivitamin daily can help you get the nutrients you are lacking in your diet.

Please go and see your doctor, it may be that you have had an injury in the past (and forgotten about it) and the strain of lifting weights has triggered a response from the injury.     2. Stop training until you have a diagnosis of the problem, you do not want to make the situation irreparable.|`|xRvetiAMaa	You may have contributed to the pinched nerve condition with intense workouts. The purpose of the nerve system is to energize everything it supplies, including the circulatory system carrying oxygenated blood. It is likely you have "facet narrowing".    1) First see your Primary Doc (Internal Medicine MD) who will examine you & order xrays.  2) Test results will tell you what the condition is.  3) Barring invasive conditions other than facet narrowing (the bones surrounding nerves that can pinch when space is narrowed), your best solution is to find a doc who does Prolotherapy more than 50% of his time.  4 ) See http://www.totlhealth.com/painrelief.htm... and GETPROLO.com for more info.  5) Don't submit to surgery unless you're paralyzed.|`|M5w6CObIaa	yes definetly it can i injured a nerve and my back muscles started to atrophy its been  years since i had this

The meaning of fasting, is nothing to eat or drink! Especially chocolate.|`|c23b658ab35a3e3b168534baf3d6f942aa	No you should not eat at all since one of the things they test is blood sugar and that wont give them an accurate reading so best thing to do is not to eat, not you can drink water that is ok.|`|QWaspeg7aa	No of course not, it's a fasting blood test which means they will be looking at your blood after you haven't eaten for a set period so if you've eaten anything at all you'll have to reschedule it for another day (and not eat anything then!).|`|pRF5LLloaa	Depends on the test you are supposed to take.  if you are taking a blood sugar test, you're screwed. Fasting means just that - NO FOOD.    You need to call your doctor and ask him.  Let him make the decision.  No use wasting HIS time and your parents money because you have no self-control.    If the doctor says fast -- then you DO IT.  If you don't, the test could come back with a "false positive", meaning that it looks like you have a disease, but you really don't.  You then have to go through all that treatment (which may be painful) when you didn't have to.    Pay attention to doctor's orders, and DO NOT CHEAT.|`|011CjPOmaa	Probbaly not. It will effect the sugar and everyhting in your blood. Either do not take the test, or make it clear to the doctor that you ate some chocolate the night before so that he can judge whether or not to test you.
dCzoIUP7aa	I have exactly that type of thing. When I squat or walk up stairs and hills my knees grind and crackle. People can here it form 5 feet away. It even does it when I sit and swing my legs.    I have done physical therapy, swimming pool therapy, naproxin, Tylenol, cortisone and steroid shots. Surgery is the last option to me. It may make it better for a good 5-10 years but then it goes downhill. Then again it could backfire in 6 months. I have RPPS. It is when you Retro Patella and Meniscus are not in line and cause grinding and pain. The shots, swimming and continuous work have shown a mediocre improvement for me. However Glucosamine has helped a good bit as well. I have to get the one that isn't a sulfate based because I am allergic to sulfur. It is good, all natural stuff and can range in price but is never too bad on the wallet. Good luck.|`|oojO4WAraa	Duh - do what the doctor told you to do.

You need to go back to the doctor.  You might benefit from having it drained or a cortisone shot.  You might also need to have it "scoped" to see what is really going on.  You haven't really gained enough weight to cause a problem.  Over time, the knee will wear down if it's been previously injured and you'll need to care for it again.  Meanwhile, take ibuprofen in large amounts like 4 pills at a time 2 or 3 times a day - if the doctor says this is ok when you call them. :)|`|PaNqxZRtaa	Advil|`|KouNp7yUaa	tylenol, ibprophen, aleve, and tums|`|0RJWir9zaa	naproxin|`|TclyXi8qaa	Well if you haven't already seen your doctor then go and see him/her!

ufgv7oTjaa	Adding more fiber (either fiber supplements or more grains, cereals, etc in your diet) and drinking more water are the main thing to help stools pass through, although you could also take some probiotics daily to help with regularity as well.   Although if you aren't really constipated (which I would imagine you're not if you have a vegan diet), it's very possible you just don't eat enough during the day.    If you are really concerned, you could check with a nutritionist or dietitian to see if there is something in your diet you're not seeing that is the reason for the lack of BMs. Good luck!|`|AA11173395	Eat lots of raw fibrous vegetables, at least two cups daily, avoid dairy products, and drink plenty of filtered water.    Your digestive system obviously isn't functioning properly, which can lead to the accumulation of toxins in your intestines.  Also, since digestion directly influences the circulatory system, you aren't assimilating nutrients properly.    It is essential for maintaining health to move your bowels daily.|`|klOl7Q6Laa	start eating more dairy products. milk will do it to you. start adding more  fiber cereals.|`|5QQbJ9Cdaa	The healthiest way to achieve that is to definitely add more fiber to your meals.  Natural fiber, in foods. Personally I have tried:  whole grains, legumes, apples, oatmeal, peanut butter.  They work wonders and you feel good.|`|YbnqMe11aa	A Banana + Medium Black Coffee + a handful of Almonds.

Maybe during breakfast or a snack sometime throughout the day.|`|AksA9h3Aaa	You could try some herbal remedies...    Try eating lots of prunes, figs and other dried fruit..

Don't worry about it too much.|`|AA10301974	A heart murmur is nothing more than a sound. You won't know if it is serious until the results from the echo reach your doctor.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Hi Mom!    Heart mummers are very, very common.  Its a simple problem of a valve not closing fully in the heart.  Most individuals live with this all their lives with no problem.

Qh2rc1DNaa	The window alone isn't causing her throat infections...you need a bacteria or a virus for that.  It's likely that the air coming in the window is cool and dry.  That could be drying out her throat and making her more susceptible to infections.  Try placing a humidifier in the room to make the air moist, then you should be able to leave the window open.    BTW, if you get a humidifier make sure it's a cool mist kinda...not one that warms that water...that will grow bacteria.
688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	I had a very similar problem and went though years of inconclusive testing.  I am not even sure what the diagnosis really turned out to be, but I can tell you that Nexium helped me a lot.   After my doctor allowed me to be on Nexium for two years, my problem was completely gone.    For me, I'd start to cough, usually after a meal, but sometimes when nervous or highly active.  Then I'd gag, then throw up.  People probably thought I was bulimic.    All that vomiting is sure to do damage to the esophagus.  And Nexium claims to repair that damage.    If what you are trying now isn't working, ask your doctor if you can try Nexium.    I probably sound like a drug commercial, but it worked so well for me that I don't hesitate to suggest it to others.|`|jeztbF6naa	well i really don't know what to tell you.   i would HIGHLY recommend seeking another doctor.  have you ate anything unusual or out of the ordinary that you usually dont eat?  my guess would be food poisoning or try taking zertec if you think its allergies. what other symptoms do you have?   runny nose?  headaches?  sour stomach?  hot and cold?  fever?  drainage?
yHI6rfeUaa	I cannot stop laughing at your demand of an immediate answer.  Who do you think you are demanding people provide you an immediate answer?  If it is that pressing, you need to do your own research.    Now the issue to which you refer is urine that has not left your body yet and it just has not exited yet.      It is like water retention in a garden hose after the water is turned off.  Without pressure to drive the water out of the hose, it dribbles out slowly.    If you want to understand this more fully do your own research.    Finally, I suggest that at your age you learn to be more respectful when asking for favors.  If you plan to go through life with the desire to demand favors you will surely be disappointed.  People do not grant favors to those who demand.  This is basic human relations.|`|sxXoLSPxaa	relax and dont rush it. its natural.

FicyC2TXaa	There's no guaranteed cure for any cancer.    The problem with finding a cure is that cancer is not a single disease, it's an umbrella term for over 200 different diseases. The difficulty with finding a cure is that different cancers are caused by different things, so no one strategy can prevent them They all respond to different treatments so no one treatment can cure them, so there isn't a magic bullet that cures all cancers and there never will be.    But quite a few cancers can already be cured: seven out of ten children are cured of cancer; testicular cancer, Hodgkin's disease, and many cases of leukaemia can all be cured in adults with chemotherapy, most skin cancers are cured with surgery and many cases of thyroid cancer and cancer of the larynx are cured with radiotherapy.    Many other types of cancer are also cured if they are found early enough|`|ZZ5Rm406aa	Depends upon what stage it is and where it is.|`|0yTM98Odaa	It entirely depends on the type, if it is spread and what stage the cancer is at.

To understand better you should realize that cancer is a progressive disease which means it starts microscopically in the cells and starts to grow . . the cancer or tumor will grow indefinitely unless treated. So it stands to reason that the earlier the cancer is discovered and treated the more likely the patient will survive and be 'cured by treatment.'    The problem is that cancer can co-exist inside the body until it is quite large . . it than has the ability to metastasize and send out thousands of malignant cells into the blood stream or lymphatic system and travel all through the body. That is stage IV disease and that is when cancer becomes extremely difficult to 'cure' . . again treatment may eventually lead to the individual being 'cured' even at stage IV .. but it is very difficult and many patients die.     So, when you talk about cancer being 'curable' . . it is tricky because there is not one single treatment or protocol that can be followed that will lead to a cure for the disease . .instead the treatments are complicated, long, and toxic to the patient . . and not all types of cancer have effective treatments, especially the cancers that are aggressive.    Is cancer curable .. . currently with some types of cancer .. low grade and low stage a patient can be cured by early treatment. The earlier the stage and the earlier the treatment . . the better chance for survival.  The later the stage, the more aggressive the cancer .. the less chance for survival.|`|t27SvIPbaa	Please do not be like the rest of the poor brainwashed soles on here.    Cancer cures are repressed and closed down by governments because they are a threat to the pharmaceutical company's, as cancer is the biggest money making racket after oil.  If people became healthy the multi billion pound pharmaceutical industry would go bust.    The same people who control the pharmaceutical business also control the media which is programmed to label cures as quack remades or dangerous.  There are incidents of people with cures being killed or dying in mysterious incidents.    Think about it, in the 1960's they had the technology to supposedly land three men on the moon and return them without a scratch.  Yet with over a hundred years of cancer research, thousands of scientists working round the clock, billions of funding and they haven't found a cure yet?????????????????????????????????????... right, people are so gullible.

Study of his joke/wrong answer may lead to cure to cancer   -You or your friends who are interested can write e mails to me through this section by clicking my profile|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	Its maintainable.  No cure as yet.|`|QGuxbItCaa	Yes...but you have to die first.|`|T16Zmtc3aa	Yes.  Certain types of cancer have better cure rates than others.  It also depends on how far the cancer has progressed.|`|AfdyNi9Raa	Some cancers are curable through surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.|`|JJ60Ppdvaa	it can be surgically removed if its not malignant. unfortunately there is no cure, But an scientist has found a way to stop the cells but it only works in about 10%.   Chemotherapy is also used to kill cancer cells but its bad for other cells as well.|`|XXZFf1AYaa	Some kinds of cancer are curable, but even they depend on how far the cancer has spread and other factors.    Chemo is used to kill cancer cells and shrink cancerous tumors before removal by surgery, and sometimes it will eliminate the tumor altogether.|`|zD2NWrIzaa	if found early enough then most can be treated with good prospects , but not all unfortunatly|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	Some cancers are. Leukaemia can be cured in some children  There is a horrible cancer of pregnant women which used to be totally fatal and it killed very fast, called choriocarcinoma, but it can be cured now. It is very very rare, so don't worry about it, will you.  Some can just be cut out without recurring.
ZleVRevVaa	Drink as much water as u can and clean ur private areas with water everytime you pass urine.|`|oy7mNHJNaa	Ive found taking cranberry supplements helps.  Take one of those and an OTC product like cystex (analgesic to help with pain and antibacterial).  Make sure you drink lots and lots of water.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	They have a product called AZO that you can get over the counter. It stops the pain and urgency. I would take the antibiotics if you have enough. About ten - one a day for 10 days.|`|b6a1a2605fc16fc118c286edfa66c836aa	I beat a UTI with straight cranberry juice, not juice cocktail, just cranberry. Then I was taking along with that, those cranberry pills you can get at any drug store in the vitamin isle. Try that, pump the water too, it should go away. I had to do this because I didn't have any insurance to go see a doctor. Good Luck!|`|hZWup7xXaa	just drink as much cranberry juice as you can. what kind of antibiotics is it? it depends on what they are for them to help with a uti. i get them alot so i just try to drink a lot of cranberry juice. well i hope this helps and good luck :)|`|AA11503426	Firstly, don't take the antibiotics. They might not be the correct type for what you have. Plus, you will become immune to their effects and might end up with an even more serious infection next time. You shouldn't take antibiotics without them having beeen specifically prescribed.    Next, don't drink any more cranberry. This is acidic and will just make the environment for bacteria to grow more attractive (bacteria grow in acidic conditions).    Next, if you can get to a health food store, or order over the internet, I'd recommend taking some d-mannose powder in water. It is a natural sugar and will flush out the bacteria because they cling to this rather than to the bladder walls. Search for d-mannose on the internet, lots of different companies sell it.     Finally, drink lots and lots of plain water and sit in a hot bath (no bubbles) to ease the pain. Then use a hot water bottle to  ease the pain as well. Ibuprofen can sometimes lessen the pain a little too, until you can get hold of d-mannose.    I hope you feel better soon x    BTW, here is one site where you can get the d-mannose. But you can get it wherever you want - there are lots of sites.    http://www.waterfall-d-mannose.com/    EDIT: why am I getting thumbs down? I am genuinely trying to offer good advice.|`|SZFyKlWzaa	take cranberry pills and drink the juice. as for the antibiotics, those will help
iNQK27Qqaa	tell him to choose one of you, if you are not comfortable with him talking to her and he respects that and you. He should knock it off. People will tell you it is probably innocent. But i went through this with my wife, and this is just how it starts. Maybe he cant let her go. Whatever you decide to do definitely sit him down and talk about it.|`|5b478a242969ee67691fa226064cfcd6aa	From the sound of it, you need to stop worrying. It's you he's with not her. Your current jealous attitude though is going to scare him off. You don't know the whole of what went on in their relationship but obviously it's over now and by stopping them from being friends, he may come to resent you over it for years to come. You have to trust him if you want the relationship to work out.|`|0udjgaoBaa	You are crazy! There is a reason an "ex" is an "ex" theres no reason that he should be talking to her. You need to put your foot down who cares that hes a really nice guy he should be pleasing you not her! Give him that ultimatum otherwise sit there and be unhappy.|`|wLz4JVNaaa	I  think you should explain to your boyfriend that it makes you feel uncomfortable. Tell him that you trust him but aren't sure of what she's going to do and that you don't want to risk your relationship. Hope it helps.|`|xTxfmGxDaa	If you've been going out for 8months shouldn't you have trust in him by now? Calm down, if he really loves you he wouldn't do anything, and if not then it isn't real
GtR8WaI5aa	Well kid, i believe that you should tell his father.  You know that if he keeps going on this road, he will be really bad and maybe even die.  Look out for him and be there for him.  Tell his dad.|`|tLH9HZiqaa	Don't tell his dad. That will just cause more problems. Talk to him about it. And tell him how it isn't healthy. He is your friend and you should try your best to help him. Ask him why he is doing it in the first place? if it is because of self esteem then help him through it. do your best to get him out of this phase.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Tell his dad.  You aren't doing him any favors by keeping quiet.  He needs help.  It's an illness.  If he told you he had pneumonia but doesn't want his dad to know, wouldn't you tell in that case too?|`|Qh2rc1DNaa	Tell his dad...or if nothing else...as counselor....trusted adult...someone that can help.  Eating disorders won't go away. Even worse, they can kill.|`|B7fQ6dUtaa	Shout him buffet|`|MuAHhGi1aa	The best thing to do is tell his dad don't keep quiet because you & his family are going to get hurt if anything happens, don't hold back on what you need to do because worst things can happen if you don't take action before it's to late.|`|lCRJRoc9aa	i would say to talk HIM into telling his dad but if he still refuses say, "im sorry but if you're not than i am." just be straight up like that with him and he will see that this is really concerning you
T16Zmtc3aa	It has many potential complications: pancreatic infection, too little blood, bleeding, kidney failure, shock, lungs problems, pneumonia, diabetes, blood clots, digestive track problems...  These problems are caused from the premature activation of enzymes created in the pancreas.  This causes the enzymes to destroy body tissues and cause inflammation.  Pancreatitis is a very serious disease because it can possibly effect most of the major organs in the body.
G35SjmTiaa	Although Methadone when taken as directed is a very safe and effective medication it can be dangerous when combined with some meds and Elavil is one....  Combination of Elavil with methadone can increase TCA toxicity  (DeMaria 2003; Maany et al. 1989; Quinn et al. 1997;  Richelson 1997). Mixed reports of methadone increase or  decrease (Eap et al. 2002; Moolchan et al. 2001; Strang  1999; Venkatakrishnan et al. 1998). Caution might be  advised when using the drugs in combination with methadone  due to possible proarrhythmic effects.  http://www.atforum.com/SiteRoot/pages/ad...  BTW It is NOT synthetic heroin. People like the above poster jeopardizes the lives saved by MMT with their ignorance!|`|CGvjALPOaa	GET OFF OF METHADONE! it is very, VERY addictive and is basically synthetic heroin
4arnbpUCaa	Sit down like a woman?|`|tqu2SALHaa	This is a rather Weird answer, I am not sure but by any chance have you been born a Hermaphrodite, Because if you have i know what another Male feels like, i am a GP and i would like to discuss this in Private    markm2k8@hotmail.co.uk|`|1ed7defe3f711407d7c9dccdf69df04eaa	grow up man you are going to get abused bad with this question.|`|4DzPhJgKaa	What :o  you dont have a penis  use a pipe|`|OF98s0Xfaa	hahahahahahahaha .... WTF>????? dude r u castrated????if u r then .use a pipe or a drinking straw
s9AzdrNlaa	Simple - take the centigrade reading, multiply by nine then divide by five - finally add 32 - the answer is in farenheit!
7RQDM1HGaa	Your enamel might be fighting it off. See your dentist.    Try whitening trays. The AquaFresh ones are pretty legit I'm using it right now lol.|`|2v56dqbQaa	Check out your blood line?  I am half Mediterranean ( no exacts) and I will never have white teeth, if you smoke you will need to get your teeth clinically cleaned on a regular basis.|`|0PUhA2XLaa	It depends on the enamel of your teeth. Please visit your local dentist.|`|A96gJX8Laa	That's weird because when I used my white strips I saw results after couple days. Are you using the 5 minute ones or the 30 minute ones? I used both and I liked the 30 minutes ones better.
7be554591e8c040c7b5bfa762a5a2560aa	I have no idea, but if it is really bothering you why don't you go to the ER??? Maybe they can help.
7be554591e8c040c7b5bfa762a5a2560aa	I'm sorry,  I have had both knees replaced...but don't understand your pain at all.  If the doctors don't know...then  I don't know what  to tell you.   I assume you have seen an orthopedist?  But if the MRI  and the  other  tests show nothing....I just do not know what you could do.  My  answer to pain in bones or joints is always to get into the hot tub.  So maybe try that.  Go to the  Y, if you don't have one.  Or put a heat pad on the part that hurts then  wrap it around your knee  w/a towel  to hold it there.  Should relieve some of the pain.  Yes, there is always a small amt of fluid around all joints. Why don't you try wearing a much lower heel?  If it will save you this pain, it will be worth it...don't you think?  Oh, and by the way  I much appreciate your grammar and spelling and correct useage of the english language.  Sometimes when you read the questions on here,  you wonder if there are any  schools teaching english or spelling anymore. But there really is not excuse because there is  Spell check.  So does that mean they are so ignorant they can't even be bothered to check their spelling before exposing it to the world?  Looks that way to me.     I hope you find relief for  your pain, not a fun way to live.
CIwBOKCWaa	Well my guess would be that it was cold outside and you were running in the cold(and drinking Gatorade) you probably got like a little sick or something..I don't know.    I remember one time I during cross country,it was cold and I was running with my hood on my head and then when I came home I started puking and had a huge migraine.I couldn't go to pratice to the next day.  I was so mad...  I love running!!!|`|bJrT3EzQaa	It could be from strenuous activities such as running. This happens to me when I run etc. It could be your brain's getting alot of oxygen/blood and it's too much so your head starts pounding. Idk....i defitnitley don't know why your teeth hurt. Pay close attention to them while you're running. If things get serious u might wanna try a doctor....
HYOQfHbWaa	Often our physical patterns start showing the mental attitudes we hold towards life/something. I think your soul is summoning you to dig deeper into yourself and do things which are more closer and meaningful to your heart. Try having a more invigorating and creative attitude about life. Though mothering is a very huge responsibility, still besides being parents we have our own aspirations to follow. So It's all about discovering a little bit more about yourself which may lead to your soul growth.     Love and Blessings|`|yNMc5g7paa	Try exercising in the morning right after you wake up, but dont exercise too much.. just enough to get you kinda warmed up.    Also, 10 hours of sleep is TOO MUCH sleep. There is such a thing. Try to get maximum 8-9 hours per night. That should help too.|`|3AAtPzSaaa	might need some vitamine suppliemts, low iron...  go to the health food store get some mulitvitamins and iron tablets  see how that goes..|`|cvRscoQ3aa	probably because you do a lot during the day. Taking care of 2 kids doesn't sound like an easy job, it must be tiring.|`|h31I5hSAaa	your probably so worn out from looking after 2 kids!|`|P6NptCz8aa	You're getting too much sleep, that's why. Shorten it to 8 1/2 or 9 hours a night. And drink more water to help things get moving inside you.|`|AA11736322	Check your blood haemoglobin.    If it is below  10 you will feel tired whole day.|`|9ni90gyVaa	not tired just lazy|`|XwLjFq3Laa	everybodi has that same feeling. its just a mixture of stress and exhaustion|`|iAhCtXFIaa	too much sleep|`|fQuPOe3Haa	10 hours!! YOUR LUCKY!|`|f4doqdSCaa	Could be an iron deficiency or other vitamin deficiency. Could be a hormonal problem, thyroid problem or even depression. Nobody here is going to be able to diagnose you, you should see your doctor and have them run a couple of tests so you'll know what's what.  Good luck!|`|NENNHNVPaa	I use to be physically tired all the time.  A bit of blood work determined that I was anemic.   Started increasing my iron intake and I'm feeling much better.  Even my headaches are gone.|`|4b644d3e9fa1328649e31b2870d579ccaa	Yawning is one indication of having heart problem. Be sure to eat more fruits and vegetables plus 12-15 glasses of water a day.  Do some light exercise to keep your blood flow freely.  Always think positive and soon enough, you will overcome fatigue.  Last but not least, PRAY.  Take care and GOD BLESS.|`|f9327be4a79bbc4d70ce4347dc7ed8f1aa	because you have two children?
AA10975334	LOL! Pink army is right, if you are in a coma, you will generally wake up in the hospital with machines and IV's hooked up to you.|`|1JSblCBsaa	Don't you mean a brain fart? I think your question is positive proof of that.|`|9ni90gyVaa	becus u would wake up in a hospital|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Huh???|`|lGYIpU1Vaa	seriously..?
Q87xLOkdaa	You're conscious. That's how you know you're not in a coma.|`|l1d5UGTXaa	well are you inbetween two distinct ideas in a sentence...oh no wait that's a "comma"|`|5sAhoGalaa	You can't but on the safe side pretend you arent and make sure you make the right choices You would hate to find out your not and mess up your life!! haha|`|DioDPMWzaa	Well, considering you are awake and not asleep you are not in a coma. A coma is a condition like being asleep only you stay that way for a long time and you don't wake up for a long time. Thinking there is something wrong with your mind is probably making all the other things come up. Like the whole thing is all in your head. psychological. maybe you could be cured with a placebo.
YIs51Vp8aa	3 T is a great video!      You may do better with the "Get on the Ball" series.  It has a great core workout and also a total body workout.    For full sculpting and shaping there is a new program from Chalene Johnson called ChaLEAN Extreme.  You may really like that.  It is a very focused lean muscle building program that uses weight training.  The workouts are very efficient and effective!    Hope that helps!|`|fusc1cykaa	Yeah  or the Turbo sculpt, that is in the Blue DVD with the 5 workouts.
1KfbgBupaa	Keep the appointments and follow up with whatever tests are recommended.  This could be any number of things but you have to find out before it can be treated.
pIvN6TY7aa	Of all the cosmetic surgical procedures, a 'tummy tuck' is the most invasive.  It's not just a matter of taking in the skin a little bit.  There are significant incisions, affecting muscle tissue. Recouperation is not fast.  Really more than the average mother of a 2 yr. old would want to take on.    It is, of course 'elective surgery.' In Canada, it'll run you about $8,000.    At 17, your skin has elasticity and resiliance far greater than it will be in later years. A modest routine of healthy exercise should take care of it.    (If you want to know what "lots of extra skin" looks like, contact me. And mine is modest, resulting from going from 145 to 100 lbs. (meds) over a few months.)    If you were older, I'd suggest it wouldn't hurt to put a few pounds, to smooth things out some.|`|2jMFurDoaa	yeah, your gonna have to pay for it tho    if doctors fixed every mothers tummy after having a baby for free and if every insurance covered that then we'd all have flat smooth tummys.    but id suggest exercising first!!|`|WlnnsGM5aa	I would try doing exercises first, do situps every day, it happens to all of us.|`|JiqFFX1iaa	Go to the gym,    or take classes like polodi's or however you spell it  or kick boxing. i highly recomend kick boxing.    youll regret a tummy tuck.  they look soooo grose.
AA12228565	Do you have sex?  Mine did the same thing and one month later I found out I had HPV.  You might want to look into it if you do have sex.|`|ErcsrWtJaa	your BF probably had something on his fingers that you are allergic to. I think you should go to the doctor. Sorry.|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	His fingers were probably dirty. Make sure he washes his hands next time so you don't get an infection.|`|OLpWRv2uaa	He could have inserted into your vagina a strain of any type of bacteria.  Did he make sure he sanitized his fingers before he inserted them into your vagina?|`|f4doqdSCaa	Hmm... well, is it possible that he handled something that you're allergic to, before touching your goodies? Or it could just be some kind of irritant, rather than an allergy (hot peppers, for instance, can be very irritating). I'd say wash up with some mild soap and cool water, and perhaps try some cortisone cream. If it doesn't clear up or start to get better very quickly, you'll need to see a doctor, so you'll probably have to break down and tell mom, sorry. Hopefully it will be ok with the above advice.   Oh, if you think it's an allergic reaction, you could take a benadryl, that would probably help as well.   That's all the advice I've got, as I don't really have any personal experience with this.  Good luck!|`|NcLV4Jmuaa	it got hurt by your bf's fingernails.  keep the place dry and eat antibiotics.  you can't put anything down there as it is so sensitive.  keep it clean and don't wear underwear for a few days so it get better air flow.  avoid jeans.|`|LNBYoMCNaa	sticky fingers|`|jxQ9OFVnaa	you got cut and his dirty fingers gave you an infetion and thats y it hurts to pee and swolen i recomend a docter|`|EB5WIpdIaa	he popped ur cherry.  and thats reallyyyy abnormal.  go to a doctor, and tell ur mom. before it gets worse.|`|df14a975e88aa3ace30d8ccaf12bf3e6aa	Go to Dr, you can always claim you fingered yourself.|`|gUMonqNTaa	you probably have a yeast infection....you can cure this by buying a product at like walmart...|`|gXne4VJcaa	Try taking a warm bath, and tell your guy to make sure his fingers are really clean the next time he goes exploring|`|MekUlyGpaa	you need to go to the doctor   it could be a bladder infection or another source of infection or a std   sexually transmitted disease} you need to tell your mom   you don't have to tell her what you and your boyfriend was doing   try to make sure you go to the doctor don't continue to suffer
UbRmMH5gaa	Get help, sweetheart.    Some facts:    You need at least 1,000-2,000 calories a day to maintain healthy function. You burn calories all day long walking, sitting at your desk taking notes, typing on the computer, even sleeping.     Obviously, your body is not getting enough calories through the food that you eat each day and instead is eating itself. This is why you've been feeling tired and weak; your body is actually EATING itself. Scary isn't it?    Why aren't you eating? Why do you feel like you have to lose weight? Every woman is beautiful in their own unique way. It doesn't matter what anyone says about your weight as long as you're healthy enough to do the activities you want to do.     But it doesn't sound like you're healthy enough for anything right now. Am I right? When you want to go outside on a walk, you get breathless and tired.. almost like you're going to pass out. Right? Not healthy.     Get help. Talk to your mom. I know it's scary, but she's actually just looking out for you, baby doll. I was scared talking to my mom about a lot of things that I've gone through in the past, but telling her has always been easier than I thought. She will actually respect you more for being responsible and admitting that you need help.    I wish you the best of luck, girlie. Hang tight.|`|cyPw1ERHaa	um, your weight is probably fine but if you feel weak than maybe you do need to gain a little...    and girl don't make yourself throw up!!! That's just going to make yourself worse. Maybe just try to eat a little more for breakfast :)    and eat lunch too :)|`|AA12228565	You should get help.  Yes, I would say you are anorexic or possibly even bulimic|`|KbmP0xWhaa	yes, you do sound like you have the same symptoms of an anerixic person but without the looking in the mirror and thinking your fat. but if you eat more for breakfast and a little more at a time for lunch (so your body gets used to it again) and not throw up. then you should maintain a helthy amount of weight without getting fat or anything. just to keep looking not to skinny but not overweight.. hope i helped.    good luck :]|`|b6o0UzVXaa	sorry to say, that is anorexia and bulimia since you also use laxatives and throw up  im 15 too and weigh 100 but thats just from fast metabolism  i know its cliche but seriously talk to your mom about it and your doctor also  and um if youve lost 77 pounds when you were 101 to begin with, thats dangerously close to starving.|`|3b799e3d18df0e460b9a42cf6e25aba5aa	Yes you have the disease Anorexia and you need to see an adolescent psychiatrist right away! The reason that you are tired and weak is that you are starving! Please honey, you can get help with this. This is a very dangerous illness and people die from it!  Please show this to your mother.|`|f4df9712869843dd814c1e02d77242eaaa	you sound like you are both anorexic and bulimic.  you are way too little to be starving yourself and then throwing up what little you did happen to eat.  you need help.  and you WON'T be ok if you continue doing that stuff.  people need food for fuel, and if you eat more than 100 calories, then that's ok.  and you can't completely wipe out all fat because you actually need some fat.  what you are doing is dangerous, so please get some help.
kDgtpUY3aa	I had issues with my period being abnormal and turns out I have Graves disease. Sounds scary I know, but it affects the thyroid gland which controls the hormones in your body. It can be life threatening if left untreated for a while. Its something I would bring up to your doctor on your next visit though for sure.|`|AA11113671	sounds irregular, but somewhat regular... i guess youre semi~regular?
4aXVSSqjaa	Yes it will help but both of you have to use the medicine.|`|zqWuMcclaa	ok first of all who is they? If it is anyone besides a doctor go get tested self diagnosis will not help you! Take something in the meantime but go get check better dafe then sorry
VYWaL2graa	I think she's talking about aspartame. It has caused cancer in lab mice, but keep in mind when they do these studies they are pumping massive amounts into a tiny animal to see if they can get an effect.    I don't know the exact amount it would take to directly cause cancer, but it's something ridiculous like you'd have to drink 5 gallons a day for years. Something like that. I'm being too lazy to look it up right now, but if you drink it in moderation then it won't cause any problems. Just like anything else in moderation.|`|U3U0Kpimaa	thats a load of crap|`|SghwXlQ9aa	Lol I like how you call soda pop. Um, I've never heard this, but that's really interesting! And scary =/|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	Pretty much every f-ing thing these days causes cancer. Heck, you're probably on your way to getting cancer right now just by staring at your computer screen and reading this answer.    Take a nice deep breathe - and now you're even one step further. Ah, pollution, how refreshing.    So chill out and live life and don't worry so much about getting cancer from an occasional diet coke. Too much of anything can give you health problems. Heck, people die by drinking too much water.|`|DekGIOImaa	I am not sure what type of cancers it causes and what type of brands if any but my family and I used to drink diet soda (thinking that we are somehow saving calories) until I heard something on the news about it. I then switched to regular pop and we drink it in moderation. They say clear soda (pop) like Sprite,7-Up or Sierra Mist is better than the dark ones.|`|NfKxRUo7aa	jus bad aftertaste|`|aq3FmI01aa	No not that i know of drink it all the time(-=|`|AA10167390	well idk about that but it as actually unhealthy from the chemicals in it to make it " healthier"|`|UgDOkQKKaa	only if you drink, like, 40 cans a day. and even then its very rare.  brain cancer|`|qfSKgxDsaa	ya it can.  I knew someone that went tymperarily blind from it!  No joke, she got her sight back but it messed her up.  She doesn't drink it now of course.  But if you have one every ONCE in a while, you'll be okay, I do...probably have like 2-3 diet's a year, sometimes I just get the craving.  Plus I went to a nutritionist and she said that the diet cokes are actually worse b/c of what they sub for the sugar!  drink the normal kinds, or better yet, water :)|`|pmqv1oM3aa	yeaah its actually true. my dad is a doctor so he knows a lot about this. diet pop contains aspartane which is really bad for you and  can cause over 150 cancer symtoms. i suggest you should stop drinking pop in general. it's so bad for you. water is the way to go. pop: sugar, water coloring, aspartane, and all these stupid medical ingredients. hope this helped!|`|pqqJ5krjaa	doubtful, it can **** a child up if they have pku though.|`|yNMc5g7paa	Not cancer, but DEFINITELY diabetes.
BwVdNJc8aa	Look toward the works of Fiona Apple.

AA10261043	I would start with 20.  The first week is when your body goes through sugar withdrawal and switches over to burning your own body fat for energy.  This process will cause headaches, fatigue, and a feeling out being out there.  This is what's commonly referred to as 'The Induction Flu".      You will KNOW when your body is actually burning fat by a weird taste in your mouth (kinda sweet), bad breath, and a stronger smelling urine.  It is all temporary.  The most significant difference will be a loss of appetite, which will happily stay with you, and you will also get a burst of energy, like an endorphin rush.  After about two weeks, you will probably feel more "alive" than you have in years.    I've made the mistake of going back to carbs and even calorie counting (UGH!) about two times since going low carb 2 1/2 years ago, and every time I've learned the hard way that I feel terrible, depressed, and fatter by the minute eating carbs!  The experiences only reinforce what I believe to be true...Low carb is the only way of eating for me.    I've learned a lot of invaluable lessons from Lowcarbfriends.com  There are people there who have been succesfully low carbing for years and are full of knowledge, experience, support, and motivation. The transformation pictures of people are very inspiring!|`|6da5a77fa2ae9ecdc85aad0e7e8f2db3aa	Michelle, it depends on your own tolerance and activity level. starting at 20 grams and then working your way up is a good place to start.    You could use the Atkins induction list as a base and then building from there one new food item at a time:
t6MzMHouaa	You should make an appointment with a gastroenterologist.  In the meantime, you can try to figure out what triggers the emergencies.    Does it happen when you eat a high-fat meal?  Does gluten (wheat, barley, and rye) bother you?  What about milk and milk-products?  Each of these food groups can trigger bowel problems.  Also, stress can aggravate the problem as well (especially if you have irritable bowel syndrome).  So, for at least a week, keep a written record of what you eat, when you eat it and when you have to use the bathroom.    Then take this record with you when you see the doctor.  The information will be an enormous help to him (or her).  Good luck!|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Some people are like this, I live with one, I've lost many handkerchiefs along the side of the country road to my wife for this.

You should adopt nutrients/foods that help attaining stronger, healthier ejaculations. The foods that boost testosterone may help increasing the sperm count. The dietary supplements that help raising semen volume level are also thought to increase sperm count:    Zinc is vital for viable sperm count, motility and a high percentage of live sperm in the semen. Zinc is present in semen and therefore men can lose excessive quantities of zinc through ejaculation - therefore it is critical that zinc is replaced through the diet daily. Foods rich in zinc such as lambs, turkeys, barleys, wheat, oysters, beans, nuts, red meats, raw sunflower and pumpkin seeds are considered to be the super-foods that can help to increase the sperm count in men.    Vitamins C, E and especially B12 possess antioxidant properties and are thought to increase sperm production. L-arginine, L-cartinine (amino acids) those are found abundantly in spinach, seaweed (Spirulina), poultry and also in sesame seeds, tuna, turkeys, egg whites are thought to energize the sperms and also to increase their production without affecting any other body system.    But there is one thing you can do to do all that at once. More on it on source articles.|`|PWk6niKoaa	Use multi vitamins to promote extra energy

If you do it at the same time it will take twice as long and the result wont be any where near as satisfying.|`|ycaloVnkaa	Its hard to gain muscles and lose weight. One the one side ur muscles need energy to grow so u have to feed urself more which will more than likely lead to sum fat gain ( its uncontrolable).

A lil warmup cardio b4 ur lifting routine is fine.|`|MOSe9JYaaa	No.  Muscle burns more calories than fat.  It also weighs more so keep that in mind when you look at the scale.  Often when you lose weight the healthy way you will gain muscle mass and lose inches of fat.|`|RzcKTM4Haa	Not at all. The more muscle mass you acquire the higher your metabolism will run. That is resting metabolism as well- what you burn just hanging out on the couch.

If so, my story below may be of interest to you.    I CANNOT offer you any guarantees, but what helped me lose about 20 pounds in 3 months is an old, very inexpensive natural remedy that might sound strange to you. Put 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar (ACV) and 1 tablespoon of honey in 8 ounces of warm water and drink this mixture. Do this two (or possibly three) times a day. It may take a while to get used to the taste. If you really dont like the taste, add extra honey.     Use Bragg's ACV or other brands from a health food store, not stuff you buy in a regular grocery store. Also avoid the ACV capsules sold in grocery stories and drug stores. They are a waste of money. As I said, the ACV did work for me. For the 3 to 4 weeks, I don't think I lost an ounce, but maybe my metabolism was speeding up. In the second and third month, the weight started to come off.     ACV has been used for hundreds of years for a variety of health issues, so this is not the latest fad diet.

qZTIVDwqaa	I use to weigh 205lbs @ 5'5 when I was 16, I;m now about, IDK, 5'8'9, and weigh 159. I lost 46lbs gradually due to the fact that maintained an active lifestyle and started eating right, yes it is that simple. Stop drinking soda completely, or any other sugary drink. You'll drop weight like crazy, another thing stop eating fast food and candies and other obvious bad stuff. Nutrition is key to loosing weight!! Personally, living in Colorado, I hike and walk a lot, and that's how I keep my weight off and beef up my metabolism.

And at the same time try to diet a little, quit some of the bad junk food eating habits, eat fruit and vegetables but yet, get some protein, and vitamins are also good too, keep your body healthy, and drink lots of water, and stay away from any heavy lifting, stick to light weights to keep your muscles from deteriorating.|`|s4vb9spDaa	Yes it is possible.

Think of food as energy. Work out 1 hour a day. It doesnt have to be all at once. Try 30 in the morning and 30 at night. Cardio cardio cardio. Mix it up with work out dvds and the gym. Do some strength training to tone a little. Have a sensible diet. DOnt make yourself feel deprived just make smarter choices. So watch the calories. Drink water. It has 0 calories.

However, you also have to watch your water intake with the fiber. Make sure you drink 6-8 glasses of water a  day.  You may also want to consider seeing a Gastro-enterologist. He can help diagnose the cause of the pain. Could be diverticulitis. Could be inflammation in the colon - my son has this problem. Best way to know for sure - a colonoscopy. Talk with the GI doctor about other things to help with the constipation. I have been watching my fiber intake because I have IBS. I know that just before "that time of the month" I have issues with constipation. at the first sign of trouble, I take a stool softener. Stops right there. A doctor can help you find the right run for you. Caution, never, ever take stool softeners on a daily, long term basis unless under the direct supervision of a doctor.

Knz8iJSWaa	causes of bone cancer is still unknown but the risk factors are    A risk factor is anything that affects your chance of getting a disease such as cancer. Different cancers have different risk factors. For example, exposing skin to strong sunlight is a risk factor for skin cancer. Smoking is a risk factor for cancers of the lung, mouth, larynx, bladder, kidney, and several other organs. But having a risk factor, or even several, does not mean that you will get the disease. Most people with bone cancers do not have any apparent risk factors.     Genetic disorders     A very small number of bone cancers (especially osteosarcomas) appear to be hereditary.|`|AA10725882	What type of cancer?  There are hundreds of different types of cancer.    Most people who have malignancies affecting bones have a primary cancer somewhere else - such as lung cancer, breast cancer, and many other types of cancer that tend to spread or "metastasize" to the bones.    A small minority of people have primary malignancies that start in the bone.    There are a number of different types of primary bone tumors also.    The number of primary bone cancers in the U.S. for 2008 is estimated at 2380.  Compare this to 232,270 cases of lung cancers. (ACS data)  So you see there are 100 people with lung cancers for each person with a primary bone malignancy, and many of these people with lung cancer wind up having bone involvement.      No one really knows why some people develop primary bone malignancies.    We do know that most lung cancers are related to prolonged tobacco smoking.  There are far more people in the U.S. with lung cancers and breast cancers that have spread to the bones than there are people with primary bone cancers.    Other cancer types that often spread to bone include prostate cancers, melanomas, and renal cancers.  Multiple myeloma usually involves bone marrow and bone.  Lymphomas can invade bone.  Many of the 200 plus types of cancer can involve the bones.|`|r8rykCkGaa	I think it usually starts with another type of cancer.  My sister had breast cancer and had a mastectomy about 6 years ago.

The most common are prostate, breast, lung and multiple myeloma.|`|d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	No one knows why most people get cancer including bone cancer. However, despite the comments here bone cancer is often found in children and young adults . . its a type of cancer called sarcoma. There are over 60 different subtypes of sarcoma. A Sarcoma is cancer of either the bone, the muscles, the tendons, the joints, the ligaments, the fat, blood vessels, or the soft tissue in the body. It is a disease that affects the young more than adults . . so the type can be age specific.     Children, adolescents, and young adults can get several subtypes of sarcoma that attack the bone . . osteosarcoma and Ewings sarcoma are the most common types.    Adults generally have cancer that originates in an organ such as the lung or breast and than spreads to the bone . . so it is metastatic cancer and not a primary bone cancer. Children and young adults will get a primary cancer that starts in the bone.

Off of that, 1 U.S fluid ounce equals 29.57 mL. By multiplying 29.57 by 8, you get 236.56 mL, which is very nearly equivalent to 236.56 mg.

4tPtywKfaa	utill your a few years older, do NOT work out with heavy weight - it can damage growing bones and ligaments.  Instead, concentraite on intensity and max numbr of reps instead od packing on the muscle.  Working out is such a small part of the total package.  You can get the best results from in your kitchen!!!|`|deYDbVDSaa	That varies from person to person. You are more likely to rip a tendon than a ligament anyways.    You should pick the weight based on this: You can perform 8 - 12 reps. Once you can get to 15 reps, increase the weight. This is a safe zone where nothing bad should happen.
Q87xLOkdaa	Don't even start lifting until you're 17 or 18, because if you start now, calcium will build up in your muscles and cause you some serious problems later in life.|`|gGNKMqUNaa	if you intrested in bodybuilding,start it at about age of 15 for best  results    but if you want to go to gym now , pick up weight 1/5 to 1/6 of your body weight|`|T0P30Lpoaa	i advise strongly to not lift weights this early! You can actually do more harm then good as your muscles are developing and if you put pressure on them this early you are going to hurt the development, not just that but i heard that puberty could be delayed as a result.
QK5oaL4oaa	Since you're on birth control pills, keep in mind your period is not an actual period, but "the bleeding is brought on by the fact that she is not taking hormones during that time (a hormone withdrawal bleed)". I just think that's how your body reacts to the pill. Take it as a blessing, light periods are great!|`|rReZfNlEaa	Dang your lucky! lol Ive been the total opposite! GAWD I just want to die instead of have cramps for two weeks.. But I read on my birth control that after a while on the pill you have lighter periods.. So I think its normal but always best to ask a doc I guess
2sycPf8Daa	Mitral valve prolapse is often harmless. Most people who have mitral valve prolapse don't require treatment. If leakage is severe, however, the mitral valve may need to be repaired or replaced.   Mitral valve prolapse sometimes leads to mitral valve regurgitation  a condition in which blood leaks backward into the left atrium.     Though most people with mitral valve prolapse don't need surgery, your doctor may suggest surgery if you have severe mitral valve regurgitation with or without symptoms. The risk of severe mitral regurgitation is enlargement of your heart's main pumping chamber (the left ventricle). This can eventually weaken your heart, preventing it from effectively pumping blood. If regurgitation goes on too long your heart may be too weak for surgery.     Your doctor may recommend cardiac catheterization and coronary angiograms before surgery.   During a cardiac catheterization, a long, thin, flexible plastic tube (catheter) is inserted into your body. Dye is injected into the blood vessels of your heart. The dye is visible by X-ray machine. The machine rapidly takes a series of X-ray images (angiograms), offering a detailed look at your heart arteries to determine if you need coronary artery bypass at the same time as your valve surgery. Pressures in the heart's chambers may be measured, particularly if there is any concern about high blood pressure in the lung arteries (pulmonary hypertension) that might influence the decision to proceed with surgery.     Take care as always!|`|TORBP6QIaa	I think its time you had a review of your condition.  Make an appointment to see the Cardiologist and get a review echo and also a review of yur metoprolol...it may be something as simple as a change in meds or dose that gets you feeling better.

	you should probably quit tanning until the hair is growing normally. Use non scented lotion. BUT NOT ON GENITALS!! the upper pubic area is fine.  i usually tweeze mine. the grow in fine after. mine usually look like a white head (pimple)with a tiny black streak (the hair) going thru it. sometime you can pop them by scratching them off. or, like i said tweezing. and remember not to dry shave again. i have also learned if you shave downward first, then at downward angles, then upwards, it doesn't cause as many ingrown hairs.|`|PImvmP1paa	You will not have scars for pulling out in-grown hair with tweezers. I've done it before with my arm pits and legs.     You really shouldn't shave your public hair off. Pubic hair keeps out bacteria, helps with the production and release of pheromones, and with the way you and your partner are turned on.

AA12144656	Bleeding on the brain is very serious.  My dad is in the hospital now with this, only he took a fall and hit his head on a rock.  When your friend fainted he may have hit his head and this could have started the bleeding, or another scenerio is that he is bleeding on the brain and this caused him to faint.    The bleeding causes the brain to swell which is not good.  When blood touches the brain cells it kills them, so this is not good either.  Many things happen to them when this happens in their brain.  Motor skills change, their whole lives change as a result.    I'm sorry this has happened to your friend and to my dad.  They are still running tests with my dad.  How is your friend by now, I noticed this has been 2 days ago since you wrote?
XTgRwfJpaa	Diabetes can cause the loss of circulation to your lower extremeties.  It can cause loss of circulation to a lot of areas; the darkness in your toe should be looked at by your Dr.    One way of telling if you have good circulation is to see if there are still tiny hairs growing on the tops of your toes.  No hair means less circulation and blood flow.       You didn't ask, but it can also cause erectile  dysfunction (both diabetes and hypertension).    Diabetic neuropathy is what occurs when your lower legs and feet start to lose sensation and become darkened an painful.    Your Dr will be able to diagnosis you fully.  In addition,  If your great toe hurts...it might possibly be gout... lots of reasons to see your Dr.    Stem cell research can be helpful with Diabetes (once the government gets it approved).  The cells go to areas in your body that are unhealthy where cells have been destroyed and they begin the process of creating new healthy cells to replace the 'broken' ones.

AA10202388	What is your age?    Dieting or starving will hurt your internal health and decrease your resistance against disease, do not go on dieting.    Generally you gain weight because of fats deposits, just dissolve them. How?    Sensitive people like you go for losing weight by pills, starving or a particular type of diet items. It is good that you avoid pills.    Pills do not act effectively and for longer durations. Pills have many side effects for your health.    Starving weakens you and your defense system is also weakened. This makes you less resistant against infections and other diseases.    A selection of diet items generally gives you an imbalance diet which can cause many complications including some illness problems.    The best way is to lose weight by change of diet and your physical activities.      1. Reduce or stop to take oils and fats.  2. Stop taking sugar and glucose mainly tea, coffee & cold drinks. You can use natural honey for sweetness.  3. Stop taking potato, rice, corns etc.  4. Reduce wheat and corn as much as possible.  5. Take four glass of water (4 X 160ml) in the morning without washing your mouth, then wait for 45 minutes to take any diet. This will drain toxic material from your body and help in maintaining your health.  If you can, join a gym for instrumental exercise to build your muscles but it will be a slow and gradual process.      Take vegetables, boiled meat and fruits including sweet fruits like dates and mango.    And at the top of all:    Walk at least 40 to 60 minutes with spells of jogging from 5 to 10 minutes or more, if you can, twice a day. If you are not habitual of walk start with a walk of 10 minutes and increase gradually.    You can make necessary changes according to your age and activities.|`|aNlT1NRqaa	1.57m = 62"  96.2kg = 212lbs    First, go slow. Rapid weight loss usually ends with weight gain (often more than you lost). Lose the weight slowly by changing your diet and habits permanently and you can maintain.    Get regular check ups by a doctor to make sure you're not hurting your health. Start by drinking water, tea, or coffee (no sugar). No fruit juice (eat fruit, don't drink it) or power drinks.    Walk at a comfortable speed for 20-30 minutes. You can add more time / distance / speed as you get better. Keep exercise low / no impact. Avoid pre-packaged food as much as possible (the sodium & other additives will make weight loss more difficult). Cooking real beans, rice, pasta, or vegetables is much easier than many people think. Find an activity you like (if you can involve your boys - even better), like swimming, biking, tennis, skiing / snowboarding, etc. It will give you a way to be active without feeling like you're being forced to exercise.|`|x3EPqezJaa	to convert meters to inches, all you have to do is type into google "convert meters to inches" or whatever conversion you want.

It is a good thing to get checked every year just in case, even if you have used condoms. If you do not want to be checked, tell them you have not had sex. But the pap smear is not as bad as you think. It doesn't take long to do, and it hurts but not bad. I have one every 4 months because of HPV and I still get nervous everytime, but its not bad. But you really might want to consider getting it done!

You might see your doctor and tell them what you've written here - and plan what to do next.  Your doctor may put you on an antidepressant to combat the anxiety and depression - and refer you to a psychiatrist to try to find out what's causing the depression.     Antidepressants will fix the "symptoms" of the depression - but you also need to work on the "cause" and either get it resolved or dealt with.  That's where the psychiatrist comes in...|`|va3Ysr8vaa	Do you do anything before this panic attack occurs? anything you don't normally do?|`|aFC6bUysaa	Yes that's a panic attack. I have them too.

RveicBoSaa	You surely can! You will need the following:    1. Determination for losing weight: With determination you can overcome the frequent urges to eat the same kind of food that has harmed your body in the past. This is the first and most important requirement to "surely" lose weight. Remember, nothing is impossible if you have a head that is determined and a heart that is hopeful.    2. A "strict" weight loss plan: By strict I do not mean you need to starve yourself. By strict I mean, you will need to stick to it to have the results. Do not make it too harsh to tolerate or follow. Have a step-wise approach instead, i.e. start decreasing the consumption of junk food or similar unhealthy foods gradually. Its like "weaning off" from this kind of food.:)    3. Follow your plan on a regular basis along with regular work-ups. It can be anything from 10 minutes of daily running/jogging to 20 minutes of dancing on your favorite tracks. Anything that suits you chose that to condition your body to the same.    4. Include fruits and salads in your diet. They will aid in digestion as well as keep your hunger at control.    5. Drink 1-2 liters of water daily and reduce salt intake. This will remove toxins from your body as well as help in weight loss when you will be cutting down at salt that retains water and adds to body weight when consumed in excess.    6. Be positive and happy with what you do. It will boost your self-confidence, and will positively reinforce your weight loss plan.     I have achieved this and I am sure you can do that too! Good luck!:)|`|BtvlBwy1aa	yes you can. Totally, you just have to go to the gym more often. And I mean 2-3 times a week is a good start. Also, eating healthier. Just do it in steps.

zeUcqGGjaa	some uti's can give you pain depending on the intensity. if its mild, you might not feel pain but if its extreme, yes it would hurt while going ALOT! lol   ive had both kinds, for me the extreme was because i left it untreated/1st time i had it, i thought it would just go away when it was mild and it got really bad.    anyway now whenever i feel the symptoms comming on i take a cranberry supplement and i do not get it at all. if you want to not even get symptoms of it EVER, you gtg take a daily cranberry supplement, however for me personally i only take the supplement as soon as i feel the symptoms and it comming and it stops it on its tracks ASAP, for myself within 1 hour, it stops.       please take cranberry supplements rather than cranberry juice as cranberry juice are full of sugar and more expensive, and the level of crannberry in the juices are very low. ive been to the supermarket and some cranberry juices a 1litre bottle only has 5% cranberry juice wich wont do anything for you really unless you drink 5 litres of it. $2 per 1 litre bottle for 5 litres is $10 where the supplements is 60 tablets for $10 lol the supplements are really cheap, they come in different strenghts, majority is 10,000mg wich the pharmacist would recommed you take 2-3 of the supplements a day if you have the symptoms to ease it, however i bought the 20,000 mg one, *higher strenght supplement**and when i feel the symptoms i take one straight away  i dont have to worry about it comming back.     one time i didnt have cranberry supplements i got a uti and it got past the symptoms stage where it started hurting abit, so i went out and bought and took 2 20,000mg supplements in 1 day, one for breakfast and one for dinner and it went away completely that very nxt day. infact within 1 hour of taking the supplement i started to feel better. it didnt come back at all. i think for myself it works just as well as antibotics, however when you do read the box in the supplement it says if you have uti and youre taking cranberry supplements and the uti doesnt go away after  48 hours, you should see a doctor.       ALSO it is important to drink alot of water with the supplement as it would only help alot.|`|B24W8w43aa	It can take months, sometimes they never completely go away.

Can take days can take months.  But the thing to remember with UTI and kidney infections is drink plenty of cranberry juice and water nothing else.   Also remember not to eat spicy foods, aged cheeses, tomatoes, chocolate, and don't consume caffeine all these things makes it much much worse.  Wear loose clothes and take Vitamin C supplements.|`|mAp90hEeaa	Was the medication an antibiotic or was it pyridium to get rid of the burning sensation.  If you didn't take any antibiotic, you wouldn't notice any difference.  With the words "most likely", your results could have been unclear whether you had a urinary tract infection or not so, if your symptoms were caused by something other than a UTI, you would not notice any difference.  Most UTI symptoms go away in about 3 days.

AA12008538	One of the main benefits of yoga is to bring balance to the body, mind and spirit.  It is normal for us to be tighter on one side of the body.  Since we usually favor one side of the body in everyday activities like writing, cooking, driving, etc. the muscles on one side are used more often that the other--unless you are ambidextrous.    Yoga helps us bring harmony in our imbalances.  You notice that we each pose on both sides-- triangle, warrior, even lotus--making sure you cross your legs the other way.    To answer your question, stretching only one side of the hip will cause imbalances in our bodies.  There is a possibility that this can lead to subtle or noticeable side effects depending on how inflexible the opposite of your hip is.      I myself have a more flexible right side, and my right leg is slightly longer.  I always make sure I work more on my left side, but never neglecting my right.  If you would like to realign the length of you legs, try consulting a professional such as an osteopath.    Just make sure you do both sides when practicing yoga, working on both your strong and flexible side as well as your inflexible and weak side.|`|dfe0047dbae93a303100457a5f5a66d9aa	The Benefits of Yoga   http://www.askaquery.com/Answers/qn1621....|`|62e6c69fa3036305b6ccfd3a35c8547daa	because youre stretching your muscle.

AA11150336	Generally yeah .. but, if you are an active, healthy person and you watch what you eat and don't always eat junk, you shouldn't try to make your body have a schedule. Listen to your body's needs and respond to it in a smart manner. If you are starving sometime after 6, don't worry about eating something to tide you over. Your body does have a natural clock when your body is "shutting down" and when everything is slowing up. However, if you have the urge to eat after 6 it's probably because you do a good job of eating small things in between meals to keep your metabolism running and not "on and off" throughout the day. I say if you make smart choices and want to eat after 6, why not? It'll become pretty obvious if your eating/exercising habits are not working for you, and you can change accordingly if something becomes a problem. But, like I said, I would take into account what you're eating, how healthy/active your regularly, and how often you really do eat (actually hungry or just because?)|`|AA11094078	Yes, your metabolism is slowing down for night time rest.  Remember the following when dieting:      You already know how to lose weight.  You know that if you eat less and exercise more eventually youll see the pounds come off.  Whats getting in your way?  Why do you usually regain the weight you lost?  The answer to all these questions is the same Emotional Eating.  Simply defined, emotional eating means you eat to satisfy emotional hunger; it means you use food for comfort or as a way to cope with life; and it means you eat for reasons other than what your body needs.  Whenever you reach for a boredom-breaking snack despite your commitment, or whenever you eat to quell anxiety, thats emotional eating.   Whenever you binge after a fight, or double up on portions because your day turned sour, thats emotional eating. Whenever you feel that sharp craving for your favorite food, thats emotional eating.  When we eat during these times while on a diet, we believe the diet doesnt work or that we lack self control and then look for the quickest way to lose weight (fasting/diet pills, ect) after eating all we can since we already messed the diet day up.  Read the information below but remember that emotional eating plays a big part in why we dont continue dieting and why we regain lost weight and why we binge today and start a new diet tomorrow.  Best of Luck.      Every year Americans invest billions of dollars in weight loss diets and gimmicks, many of which yield few results. However, the lure of quick, easy weight loss is hard to resist. Despite ineffective tools, most hopeful consumers are willing to give the next weight loss fad a chance. If you're planning to start a new diet, it is important to remember the following information.  Food-specific diets: Have you ever tried the cabbage diet or the fruit-only diet? These are just a couple of examples of diets that promote one "specific" food that causes weight loss. No matter how much you think you'll enjoy ice cream at every meal, inevitably you will get bored with eating the same food repeatedly. As a result, you'll eat less food than needed to maintain your weight. This type of diet will not teach you healthier eating habits or provide a balance of nutrients, and consequently is not effective for long-term weight loss.    High-protein, low-carbohydrate diets: One of the most recent trends in dieting, these diets are based on the concept that carbohydrates are "bad" and that everyone has some degree of insulin resistance, resulting in poor carbohydrate metabolism. Many proponents of these diets suggest that including carbohydrates in your diet will cause weight gain. The reality, though, is that eating more calories (whether as carbohydrate, fats, or protein) than you burn will cause weight gain.    High-fiber, low-calorie diets:  Fiber-rich foods play an important role in a healthy diet. They are a helpful ingredient of weight loss efforts because they provide bulk to the diet, which helps you feel fuller sooner. Be careful, though: if you plan to increase the fiber in your diet, be sure to increase your fluid intake at the same time or you may experience cramping, bloating, and constipation. High-fiber diets will help with weight loss only if you restrict calories in conjunction with addition of extra grains, fruits and vegetables.    Liquid diets: Consumers face a couple of different liquid diet options. Your local grocery store and pharmacy sell over-the-counter liquid meal replacements, which can be expensive and frequently add extra calories to daily consumption if not managed carefully. On the other hand are liquid diets that require medical supervision. These diets are usually very low in calories and may result in metabolic abnormalities if dieters are not carefully monitored. Neither type of liquid diet should be used for long-term weight loss unless monitored by a health care professional. Radically changing your caloric intake in this way will not result in long-term behavior modification and healthy eating patterns.    Fasting: As a way to cleanse the body or jump-start a weight-loss program, fasting has been recommended for years. However, all that fasting really does is deprive your body of nutrients and decrease your energy, leaving you feeling weak and lightheaded. If the right nutrients are not available for your cells to use as energy, your liver will convert fat stores to ketones for use as energy (ketosis). Long-term ketosis can be harmful to your health.   No fad diet or gimmick will work magic for safe and effective weight loss. The following are some suggestions for ensuring a long-term healthy eating plan and getting your weight loss efforts off to an encouraging start:   Eat a variety of foods. Remember, a balanced diet will ensure that you get all necessary nutrients.     Get some physical activity every day. Calories in must be less than calories out to ensure successful weight loss. To keep "calories out" at a healthful level, make you get at least 30 minutes of physical activity every day.    Include sources of fiber in your diet. They will add bulk and give you a feeling of fullness.    Choose a diet low in fats, saturated fats, and cholesterol. You do need to consume some fat for good health. Aim for no more than 30 percent of your total calories as fat calories, of which no more than 10 percent should be saturated fat calories.    Choose foods moderate in sugars. Foods that are high in simple sugars usually offer little nutritional value and will add unwanted calories.    Choose foods moderate in salt and sodium. Remember that salt has been added to many foods during preparation or processing, so it's not necessary to add extra salt at the table.|`|70a43707807dc9900f19f111a38b3d42aa	yes,you are more likely to put some more poundage.|`|858fc42fbdb4ccceaf518a0e6d43d01eaa	depending on how much food you eat and i dont know why you are eating at 12|`|AA10719871	yes u do|`|dfe0047dbae93a303100457a5f5a66d9aa	Here is an article on metabolism:    10 tips to maximize your metabolism.  http://www.askaquery.com/Answers/qn1601....|`|8d3a08a8fdebf91c30b6d4d33ef64593aa	Yes it does slow down.

If you are having negative side effects, go get a second opinion, but I have to warn you that psychiatry is a very inexact science and doctors will tend to give you more and more meds to try to help w/your symptoms. it sometimes takes many weeks to tell if something is helping you or hurting you, but you have to be very firm and spell out your symptoms and side effects very clearly to your docs. Make them listen to you, they don't have to live w/it, you do.   are you getting prescriptions from more than one doc? get them all together to do a consultation so that everyone is on the same page when it comes to your care. best of luck :)|`|ec370d7fa1b96cfc57a3cf7e6b10eea5aa	Klonopin will have withdrawal symptoms.

1V5n74wPaa	Without actually knowing what you look like, measurements, BMI and the like its really hard to say exactly, but I will give give you the best knowledge I have. Without having a descent amount of muscle on your arms they will never be toned. Creating muscle speeds metabolism and where there is muscle ther is less fat, because muscle burns fat closest to that muscle, do a bulking phase for arms, yes they will get a little bigger int the beginning but in the end they will be what you want. 1st 3 weeks work your arms twice a week. Heavy weight 5 to 7 sets or 6 to 12 reps go to failure on each set for example 1st set go till you can not go any more if you can do more than 12 you need a heavier weight like 12 first set, cant do no more wait 2 to 3 mins. next you will probably only be able to 10 maybe 11, third set maybe 8 4th may be 6, 5 maybe 4 or 5. Thats great. While doing this mincrease your protien intake, aporx. 1 gram per lb of your weight. and do cardio no more than 20 minutes and no more than 3 times a week after those 3 weeks then you start toning (much lighter wieght) 3  sets of 15 DO NOT GO TO FAILURE now work your arms 3 times a week maintain protien intake or slighty lower but do not go over. Increase Cardio to 20 to 25 mins 4 to 5 times aweek, Follow this routine for about a month and your arms will look great!|`|9m9gHZhpaa	get some 5-10 pound weights and do some curls.

782a83c58a9fba0fd2dbd4e6675a56c8aa	 uma doen?a infecciosa causada por um protozorio parasita chamado Trypanosoma cruzi, nome dado por seu descobridor, o cientista brasileiro Carlos Chagas, em homenagem a outro cientista, tambm, brasileiro, Oswaldo Cruz.    Como se adquire?    Atravs da entrada do Trypanosoma no sangue dos humanos a partir do ferimento da picada por triatomas, os populares barbeiros ou chup?es, como s?o conhecidos no interior do Brasil.    Estes triatomas, ou barbeiros, alimentam-se de sangue e contaminam-se com o parasita quando sugam sangue de animais mamferos infectados, que s?o os reservatrios naturais (bovinos, por exemplo) ou mesmo outros humanos contaminados. Uma vez no tubo digestivo do barbeiro, o parasita  eliminado nas fezes junto ao ponto da picada, quando sugam o sangue dos humanos que por a infectam-se.    Outras formas de contato ocorre na vida intra-uterina por meio de gestantes contaminadas, de transfus?es sanguneas ou acidentes com instrumentos de pun??o em laboratrios por profissionais da sade, estas duas ltimas bem mais raras.    O que se sente?    A doen?a possui uma fase aguda e outra cr?nica. No local da picada pelo vetor (agente que transmita a doen?a, no caso, o barbeiro), a rea torna-se vermelha e endurecida, constituindo o chamado chagoma, nome dado  les?o causada pela entrada do Trypanosoma. Quando esta les?o ocorre prxima aos olhos, leva o nome de sinal de Roma?a. O chagoma acompanha-se em geral de ngua prxima  regi?o.    Aps um perodo de incuba??o (perodo sem sintomas) varivel, mas de n?o menos que uma semana, ocorre febre, nguas por todo o corpo, incha?o do fgado e do ba?o e um vermelhid?o no corpo semelhante a uma alergia e que dura pouco tempo. Nesta fase, nos casos mais graves, pode ocorrer inflama??o do cora??o com altera??es do eletrocardiograma e nmero de batimentos por minuto aumentado. Ainda nos casos mais graves, pode ocorrer sintomas de inflama??o das camadas de prote??o do crebro (meningite) e inflama??o do crebro (encefalite). Os casos fatais s?o raros, mas, quando ocorrem, s?o nesta fase em decorrncia da inflama??o do cora??o ou do crebro. Mesmo sem tratamento, a doen?a fica mais branda e os sintomas desaparecem aps algumas semanas ou meses. A pessoa contaminada pode permanecer muitos anos ou mesmo o resto da vida sem sintomas, aparecendo que est contaminada apenas em testes de laboratrio. A detec??o do parasita no sangue, ao contrrio da fase aguda, torna-se agora bem mais difcil, embora a presen?a de anticorpos contra o parasita ainda continue elevada, denotando infec??o em atividade.    Na fase cr?nica da doen?a, as manifesta??es s?o de doen?a do msculo do cora??o, ou seja, batimentos cardacos descompassados (arritmias), perda da capacidade de bombeamento do cora??o, progressivamente, at causar desmaios, podendo evoluir para arritmias cardacas fatais. O cora??o pode aumentar bastante, tornando invivel seu funcionamento. Outras manifesta??es desta fase podem ser o aumento do es?fago e do intestino grosso, causando dificuldades de degluti??o, engasgos e pneumonias por aspira??o e constipa??o cr?nica e dor abdominal.    Mais recentemente, a associa??o de doen?a de Chagas com AIDS ou outros estados de imunossupress?o tem mostrado formas de reagudiza??o grave que se desconhecia at ent?o, como o desenvolvimento de quadros neurolgicos relacionados  inflama??o das camadas que revestem o crebro (meningite).    Como se faz o diagnstico?    Sempre se deve levantar a suspeita quando estamos diante de um indivduo que andou por zona endmica e apresenta sintomas compatveis. Testes de detec??o de anticorpos ao Trypanosoma no sangue mais comumente, bem como a detec??o do prprio parasita no sangue, nas fases mais agudas, fazem o diagnstico.    Como se trata?    A medica??o utilizada, no nosso meio,  o benzonidazole, que  muito txico, sobretudo pelo tempo de tratamento, que pode durar de trs a quatro meses. Seu uso  de comprovado benefcio na fase aguda. Na fase cr?nica, o tratamento  dirigido s manifesta??es. A diminui??o da capacidade de trabalho do cora??o  tratada como na insuficncia deste rg?o por outras causas, podendo, em alguns casos, impor at a necessidade de transplante.    Como se previne?    Basicamente, pela elimina??o do vetor, o barbeiro, por meio de medidas que tornem menos propcio o convvio deste prximo aos humanos, como a constru??o de melhores habita??es.|`|eb9d82048552f27252c63113514865a3aa	complentando a resposta..     o barbeiro infecctado pica voce, faz coco, e quando voce vai co?ar a ferida o coco contaminado entra na sua circulacao sanguinea..    basicamente eh assim.

AA11879143	Do you mean Tourettes? I have a tic disorder which I developed in my late teens. There's something to be said for not shoving pills down the throats of children, but the child should have a say (for instance, I wouldn't medicate my illness now, but had I been twitching out of control in grammar school, the social consequences would have traumatized me for life). If not going the medical route, seek alternative therapies. To simply let it go is to sentence a child to a life of mocking, frustration, fear, and low self-esteem.|`|2f34b3e62c3ec015941c7cf2d3e79c4caa	Tricuspid Stenosis?

Weed is only going to make you more depressed and unmotivated and content being unmotivated (which is the worst thing for someone who is depressed!!) Lithium isn't too helpful with depression; it's usually used to control the mania episodes of bipolar.    Have you tried Lexapro?  Also, Elavil is" time tested" and often successful.      I can tell you the worst meds I've been on and would tell anyone to avoid!! (athough individual reactions vary greatly so they could be helpful)-- Abilify, Paxil, Geodon, trazodone (just made me sleep all the time), and Zoloft.    Depression is a monster.

Talk to your doc, especially about that combination of meds!  I haven't heard of multiple SSRI's being prescribed together.    If you need something to help you sleep before you get into a doctor (perhaps a different one), go with benadryl (spelling?).  It's the same stuff as in Dramamine for motion sickness and common in over the counter sleep aides.

D:|`|POtb9OOnaa	Aerie by American Eagle. If you don't have a store near you that carries them you can order online. I would recommend the "hannah" bra.

Now I am 22, and still wear 32a haha....some of us are just little like that. I like it though
QK5oaL4oaa	Haha, I don't remember! I did hit every bra size (now I'm a DD at 20), I don't know how long it took. It takes a while to figure out you need a bigger bra sometimes, haha.    At your age As are totally normal, and you definitely have hope. You're only 13! Why are you worrying about breast size? By the way, boobs can keep growing through college, so don't stress it. It really doesn't matter that much anyway. It's not as big of a deal to guys as you'd think (although it is an attention getter, but not in a good way, really) and small boobs totally have their advantages. (They don't get saggy, no back pain, clothes fit better... I could go on, lol.)|`|sICqdaDzaa	13: 32B  Now: 34C (still growing, and people in my family have huge boobs, blehh)|`|GgWrhISBaa	Hun, They'll grow eventually! :)|`|YmqcsPUoaa	im 13 and im 34C  and yea their real lol|`|eXJOdwzcaa	girl when i was 13 i was the same as you  then when i was 14 mine grew to a 34B  now im 16 and just got to a 34C.  mine just started growing rapidly one summer.   it was after my fresman year of high school.   im a sophomore now.    yours will grow, just give it time!|`|k9LRu2blaa	when i was 13 i was a 32a, then by 15 i was a 38D.

005ce78f83ddcf20a99b9e8641cc8ec6aa	I have read that as far as weight loss it's good to work out in the morning (before your first meal) because you will be using calories from your stored fat and not from the food that would otherwise be in your belly.     That's that.  But maybe it's best because then you get it over with ASAP - working out is a hassle.  I prefer to sleep on the bench to a bowflex in hopes I may do a sleep-workout...|`|c37ff6a8e682e9c2b880086846a4442aaa	It helps to get your metabolism going for the day.|`|e5be41fbbb9a7548355d568389f4cb65aa	Yeah that about the metabolism.

Be careful cause you will feel hungry throughout the day.  There are some who gain weight instead.  Split your meal into 5 times not 3.  Eat less each time.  half the potion you usually eat.  GOOD LUCK.|`|AA10410711	your answere is in this site and i do exactly the same and feel good about it.  http://www.bodybuildingforyou.com/articl...|`|AA12296557	It's all personal preference.  It can give you energy for the rest of the day but if you aren't a morning person you might not work as hard as you would later on when you are awake.  Exercise when it feels right for you.  That's what I do!
l5wziiicaa	It could be b/c you have been constipated, constipation can get so bad that it hurts to walk BUT I have had pains in my pelvic area before too, and it went all the way around to my lower back and it hurt to walk and even lay down.  I've been through this twice, it hurt to the point that it made me cry.  I went to the ER and they told me I was constipated but I wasn't, the first time it was my appendix, it had ruptured and I had to have it removed.  The second time it was my pancreas, it had inflamed.  Maybe you should see a Dr. if this continues!
VxINaY0Eaa	Possible? Perhaps. But highly unlikely you were pregnant. Usually toward the end of your period the blood does turn darker, browner, "like old blood," and sometimes even blackish. Yes very odd.     And sometimes there are gaps in between when you think your period is over but it isn't and you happily go without a pad then get the unpleasant shock of ruining your good panties.     Usually when you're cramping is when your uterus is really working hard to rid you of the blood. It's painful, it's irritating but serving a purpose. Then when you say you're not cramping it's because most of it's already gone & done with. The rest is just the remainder. The timing does seem long but not too unusual as every period is different. Hormones are screwy and can be affected even by how much stress you are under lately. If it doesn't quit or gets more bizarre, then make an appointment. But I bet it stops in 3 days or less. If having been at one time pregnant, you would've had alot more physical signs   along with alot more bleeding other than just "old blood.'|`|9735d5833f65114f4de1c4472750fa51aa	This could be something called implantation bleeding and could actually mean that you are pregnant now.  Implantation bleeding is a little bit of bleeding you get about halfway through your monthly cycle as a fertilized egg implants itself into your uterine lining.  Pregnancy test may be in order.  I have 4 kids, so been there, done that!  Good luck!|`|e8TEnoyKaa	This is normal. This is old blood that wasn't excreted while on your normal period.    If you don't want this, get on birth control.
AA11910088	If I were you I would drink lots of water cause your body needs it and thats what I do anyway. So go ahead and drink. Cheers=))|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Never heard of that before. If your thirsty then drink. if not dont drink. Unless your taking Seroquel. i was on 400mg and if i drank anything and didnt use the rr before i fell asleep id wake up in a pile of my urine lmao|`|wRtzGgRxaa	I don't think either way is going to hurt you, although drinking a lot of water before bed will probably result in a bathroom visit during the night.  You are not going to "cleanse" more by doing this.|`|7swefA6Paa	its fine because its just water and your body always needs it, but it might make you get up to pee alot
hSOEgpPNaa	I use it when I diet.  It gives me more energy to do cardio, and it supresses my appetite.  But you can't rely on pills to do the work for you.  You need to diet strictly, for example I eat basically just fish, chicken, tuna, cottage cheese and salads when I diet.  I only drink water.  I do about an hour of cardio a day along with my regular weight lifting.
ewGzIgVcaa	I recommend that you check if you have any other irregular symptoms. The bitterness is cause by a allergic reaction to a certain food or a bacteria. You might consider consulting a dentist or a physician to help you and treat that properly. You can always visit a dentist to help you with that. Changing the brand of your toothpaste may not a good thing to do.|`|37dbkLvEaa	Buy a new toothbrush|`|ia2oWu18aa	Hmm............|`|eDU5qFXjaa	Have you had your teeth cleaned lately?  You may have tartar buildup causing that bitterness.  Have a comprehensive exam at a dental office.

QawQ2usdaa	Oh definitely I am 5'3" and 160 and need to lose weight for wrestling and prom! here is my email if interested ...janayz@live.com.|`|AA10202388	An e-mail contact may be a moral support with some advices and may motivate you by sense of competition.    The bottom line is how much can you exert.    Here is a schedule for you and every one like you:    What is your age?    Dieting or starving will hurt your internal health and decrease your resistance against disease, do not go on dieting.    Generally you gain weight because of fats deposits, just dissolve them. How?    Sensitive people like you go for losing weight by pills, starving or a particular type of diet items. It is good that you avoid pills.    Pills do not act effectively and for longer durations. Pills have many side effects for your health.    Starving weakens you and your defense system is also weakened. This makes you less resistant against infections and other diseases.    A selection of diet items generally gives you an imbalance diet which can cause many complications including some illness problems.    The best way is to lose weight by change of diet and your physical activities.      1. Reduce or stop to take oils and fats.  2. Stop taking sugar and glucose mainly tea, coffee & cold drinks. You can use natural honey for sweetness.  3. Stop taking potato, rice, corns etc.  4. Reduce wheat and corn as much as possible.  5. Take four glass of water (4 X 160ml) in the morning without washing your mouth, then wait for 45 minutes to take any diet. This will drain toxic material from your body and help in maintaining your health.  If you can, join a gym for instrumental exercise to build your muscles but it will be a slow and gradual process.      Take vegetables, boiled meat and fruits including sweet fruits like dates and mango.    And at the top of all:    Walk at least 40 to 60 minutes with spells of jogging from 5 to 10 minutes or more, if you can, twice a day. If you are not habitual of walk start with a walk of 10 minutes and increase gradually.    You can make necessary changes according to your age and activities.|`|JAgnYVAiaa	Totally whatitdobabyboo020@yahoo.com  Im me =)|`|6kOYZsr6aa	The formula for losing weight is not difficult - consume less food and exercise more - the problems arise when we actually try to put that into practice! There are loads of stumbling blocks out there don't you think?! The sole thing which definitely worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it was highlighted in Fox News and USA Today. I shed 30 pounds, it definitely does work!
XXA3AvH9aa	they usually go hand in hand. if you are constipated, and you take something to relieve it, and it doesn't work, most people tend to try again and over do it. and by the time they have a BM, its too loose. and then you take an anti-D medicine, and then you take too much.. and its just a vicious circle. Many times i have have been constipated, over took medicine, and as soon as the hard stool came out, i had the runs and i hadn't even gotten off the toilet yet.|`|R5gmIjcIaa	a healthy diet should fix that, or you might have Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Go to the doctor.
IDgSVPBxaa	Because of tooth decay over the years my front 4 teeth up top are all veneers.  They do last long if you take care of them you can brush them like you would your normal teeth you can't eat hard foods because they could break off and if they do it will look weird compared to your real teeth.  This is how they did mine they chiseled all four teeth down to barely nothing then applied the veneer to my teeth, first they will match up the veneer to your real teeth that way it matches the color of your original teeth.  You will have pain and it will be hard to eat for a few days or maybe even a week but you'll be good and your teeth will look like you never had a gap or in my case never had any cavities or also I had no enamel on those four teeth as well.

YkovI0aEaa	you might be dealing with something that causes your muscles to shrudder which causes you to have pain.  It is a sudden thing that happens when you are high and suddenly jump down.  You should rest and even if you don't feel that much pain, you should still wait.|`|uC75y83Taa	It could be so many things.  Tendinitis hasn't been mentioned.  I think you should see a doctor tommorrow.  It doesn't sound like it's gonna go away by itself.  The doctor will refer you to a specialist only if needed. Hopefully it won't be necessary.  Good luck to you!  :)|`|XXA3AvH9aa	it sounds like you chipped the bone in your heel. see your doc. if i am right, they can remove the chipped bone.|`|DuSnV09taa	This can be bad because you put a lot of pressure on it.

That pain might be a high or low levels of thyroxine and T3, T4 HORMONE. check it out with your doc, then levothyoxine pills got me to  lose 10 lbs at first and now i am a successful dieter, have lost 40 lbs so far.|`|7yRGUtgMaa	Yeah it should be no problem|`|SnU8rQBkaa	yes|`|UNT6fL5Daa	Take it easy.|`|1STzdRWLaa	Sure-- if you are hungry, just eat a carrot or celery - they are good to munch on... Just because you are hungry doesn't mean you have to snack on chips or doughnuts! Keep healthy snacks in your kitchen.|`|3KK8aq8Jaa	A lot of people who experience fatigue or excessive hunger during a diet aren't getting enough nutrients. Try adding a multivitamin to your routine.    (If you're like me, make sure you eat before you take a vitamin or it will only make your stomach pain worse.)    A multivitamin will also help your metabolism and keep your digestive tract working properly.     Being on a diet sucks. May I recommend www.sparkpeople.com?

VC7PyH53aa	It is an extremely bad idea !!   Since you only have half of the original tooth it's only 50% as strong as it should be. Add a root canal which in effect kills the tooth and you have an extremely weak tooth. One bad bite and you will totally crack the tooth and will have wasted all the time and effort put into saving it via the root canal.   Get the crown done as soon as possible or risk losing the tooth.|`|UQwB3KM4aa	I am not a dentist- however here is what I know:  Yes, the rest of your tooth can be reconstructed with a filling,  but you will have better protection over time by having it crowned. Your canine takes a good deal of stress from chewing.  Your dentist should have offered the different options.    Good Luck!|`|UuqsWddhaa	I know a filling is a lot less money for you, but it sounds like you'll need a crown. If only half the original tooth is left a filling won't properly support the tooth. a good dentist would recommend a crown! I've been a dental hygienist for 4 years. hope this helps|`|Gv4hYyf2aa	A filling that big will break down quickly and leak, but you may get a few years out of it. I did it that way when I was young and as I got older, and could afford crowns, I got them. I have all my natural teeth.

Exv4AjqCaa	lol Clearly you dont have a mental illness    Just try and get a nap before you go, even if for 1 or two hours...a little will help.    And most importantly eat eat eat. Your body runs on energy, the mistake a lot of ppl sleep deprived is they eat less. Even if you're not hungry...just keep getting calories inside you for today, that way you'll feel more energetic. Defo try and have a good breakfast...eat snacks throughout the day etc. Get enough to drink etc    Caffeine will help to, hava coffee or something. Good luck|`|4TvbeXemaa	Neil is right , I have the same problem for 30years , I am a dentist so i have to be in my top concentration , so I work starting from 6 pm , so if you have this problem for so long , do like did ,stop forcing yourself to sleep . there is lot of people like us .

When you get in just tell them you had a late night, and that you're not feeling up to par, they should understand.    Thankfully, the fact that you're up and moving should keep you from falling asleep, but as a suggestion continue into work - most employers don't look too fondly upon sleep deprivation as a reason for calling in sick.    Just remember, it's only one day.  Do yourself the favor of not making a habit of it.
4bNDqf60aa	I don't think your ideas will bear fruit for times like these. All your have one in common which is money. Needy people need money but so do drug companies or accountants. To implement your ideas would require people to sacrifice their time and money which they are currently lacking. If you are to proceed with your mission, you need to have a very detailed proposal or more precisely, a business plan.     Without it, I would say you are in for a major disappointment.
ub6641d2aa	I have a form of bipolar disorder. I am also a psychiatry major in college, so I am very knowledgeable about this disorder. If you would like to email your symptoms my email address is  cassandra_m16@yahoo.com  I will try my best to help you figure out whats wrong with you.    After that, just tell your parents that you think it would be beneficial for them to take you to a doctor because you think there might be something wrong. They should be open to taking you to the doctor.|`|94NYYq5Haa	You can't self diagnose.  You'll need to ask your doctor.  The worse thing you can do is try to diagnose yourself beforehand.|`|QykYW3R7aa	BPD is usually used to stand for Borderline Personality Disorder, a personality disorder.  Bipolar is a mood disorder.    Bipolar is similar in nature but episodes of depression and mania are usually longer and change less rapidly.  Journaling is a good idea for anyone with mood/depression/anxiety problems.  Anyone really can benefit from it.  You can look back and pinpoint triggers, events, people, etc. that may cause your mood changes or negative reactions.  Be careful self-diagnosing.  I've done it too, and have found we tend to throw ourselves into categories to justify wwhy we act the way we do.  We read about certain behaviors and symptoms of a disorder and (conciously or unconsciously) try to fit ourselves into it.  I think this is human nature: wanting an answer or explanation.  If you do see a doctor, be as truthful and objective as possible.  They must rely on you for their diagnoses, so try not to go in with an agenda to get diagnosed with a certain condition (I am guily of this and it usually makes things worse).    Best of Luck.|`|NKurMFuTaa	In short, not really. You can have your suspicions, but it's easy to find any kind of symptom in yourself if you're looking for it. You really do have to go to a doctor to have any kind of degree of certainty, as they are objective and knowledgeable about the subject. Convince your parents that you need to go, and describe the bad situations that make you think you may be suffering from Bipolar Disorder.|`|KfkmB4X2aa	Nope, ya can't.|`|38cd2001db370470f6c63d16a4935bd6aa	Go to a phyciatrist, its your best bet... self-diagnoses often don't work and if you want help there are medicines that a phyciatrist can prescribe you. Your parents should be proud that you are trying to get help.|`|BtDGWKSNaa	a bipolar person will have "mood swings", sometimes lasting for weeks, sometimes days.  they go from a state of depression to a state of mania, and for some bipolar people they can experience both at the same time.  it is also somewhat common for bipolar patients to experience hallucinations.  depression feels like you're swimming in a pool of grey, and mania feels like you're high up in a completely white area.  if you have ever had extreme suicidal thoughts, or intentionally hurt yourself it is quite possible you have a mental illness of some sort.  if you are bipolar you will have to take a mood stabilizer, such as lithium, and an antidepressant as well.  bipolar disorder effects both men and women equally.  if you are experiencing these mood shifts over time (short periods.  if you experience these moods for longer than a couple of weeks you could have a different form of bipolar disorder.)  then it is definitely possible that you are bipolar.  i suggest telling your parents that you need to see a doctor, then have the doctor explain to your parents whatever is going on.  i hope it goes well.|`|va3Ysr8vaa	dude I thought I had the same thing.... try this.... don't have sex for a few weeks and see how you feel...    POIS syndrome|`|jREXwynVaa	It wouldn't hurt to do some online research of symptoms. Find the ones you feel apply to you and bring that to your parents. A lot of times parents can be very passive when it comes to things like this. Show them that you are serious about it and that you have a valid reason for thinking what you do and ultimately, as previously stated, talk to a doctor. That might just make it a little easier to get your parents to be a little more knowledgeable and understanding of the situation.
YLhwwndqaa	Dear Alex.   It sounds as though the untreated ear infections could be a possible source of your problem. In young children the infection is often Otitus Media, which can be painful and if untreated can lead to permanent damage. You may also have  hard wax would also add to your problems.  Ringing in the ears is usually called Tinnitus which often is associated with hearing loss but not always the case.  Whatever, you need to see an audiologist to get a thorough investigation of your hearing loss and possible causes. At your age it may be that it can be remedied, but if you allow it to continue it could be a permanent feature of your life.  Sorry that you have this problem, but hope the advice helps.  Maureen|`|Y1LTzXataa	Gross, I know, but it could just be compacted ear wax. You shouldn't stick things in you ears to get ear wax out because it can push it in further and make it get compacted. A doctor can fix this by syringing your ears with warm water
QK5oaL4oaa	A period is a good indicator you're not pregnant (although not 100% accurate, some women get their periods through pregnancies). Although, if you were wearing clothes while dry humping, you had pretty much zero chance of getting pregnant. I hear lots of horror stories about the crazy ways people can get pregnant, and I guess its kind of good in a way, getting pregnant is really not that easy. Most people have to try at it, and you're only fertile for a few days out of the month. I've never heard of anyone getting pregnant without having sex (penetration and all). Don't sweat it, and if you still are, just take a pregnancy test to make yourself feel better.|`|VbaLXvuMaa	Dry humping is cool!!!!|`|e8TEnoyKaa	you probably can't get pregnant from dry sex. the chances are slim to none. you're not pregnant. you're fine.
kV2tilJzaa	Yes. I have an intolerance to a protien in wheat (gluten), dairy (casein), and soy. But people on boards I read also have more threatening types of allergies to these things as well. These things make me sick but not immediately, more like a gradual build up of sick a few days later.

WHICH IS NOT HEALTHY.    go to the doctor if i'm not right.|`|ngz4s4VVaa	It could be a little fluke, something going off in your body, when I was 12, my first period was 2 months long. I went to the doc and she said i was losing too much blood and becoming enemic, so I had to take pills to stop it, and then birth control to regulate it. Now Im totally normal it was nothing serious but I dont think they ever really knew exactly what it was. Maybe its the same with you, but since you dont have periods it could be more serious. I suggest you call your doc up and schedule an oppointment so she can check you out, make sure your ok.|`|LyvvHREDaa	I think you should go to doctor.  But I think it is a usual problem

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	It is either an ingrown hair or a stopped up gland, which we have many of in our genital area.  If it is already sore, use warm wet wash cloths several times and day and just hold them on there.  Don't squeeze it as you can spread the infection and it won't open or you could get a staff infection in it.  You can put some peroxide or alcohol on it to keep it clean.  In a few days it will get so sore you can't touch it and it will come open on its own.  When it comes open, let it drain and try to get the infection to come out.  Sometimes when they are really hurting, sitting in a tub of hot water will cause them to open.  Once it opens it will get better, just keep it really clean and dry.    hope this helps..|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	It's a pimple or ingrown hair.  If you haven't been sexually active in any way then don't worry about an STD.  Since it is sore, wait a few days and see if it fully develops into a pimple or you can see the ingrown hair and treat it accordingly.|`|GgWrhISBaa	Oh yes you can get them "down there" I get them alll the time!

If you're a virgin, have you had oral sex? That can lead to a STD too. Boils feel like big pimples but they hurt.

Your best bet would be talk to your parents and go to the doctor because if it is a boil, chances are this won't be your last and they can give you medicine. Since you haven't had a period since December, it could be and STD. Just call your doctor and talk with them|`|03CxAT0jaa	eek... :( I personally don't know if you can get pimples there or not, but it seems like you can get them just about everywhere else so I wouldn't be surprised... I haven't gotten any there myself though.    I think your best bet would be to call up your hospital's advice nurse, they would know the most about stuff like that. Mine is Kaiser, so I just went to their main web page, got their number, dialed it up, got connected with one of those robotic voice things, and it'll give you instructions on buttons to press or might just put you on hold for a couple of minutes then connect you to an open advice nurse.|`|QYDYX9B7aa	It's probably just that.

TCpTlCTRaa	Unfortunately this acne medication can cause hair loss for several reasons. It causes a biotin deficiency. Biotin is a key nutrient needed for healthy hair growth. This medication can also cause a condition called "hyper-vitaminosis A" (over-abundance of vitamin A) which is a known cause of hair loss. It also reduces the size of the sebaceous gland. Without adequate sebum, hair may become dry, fragile, weak--and more likely to fall out. Lastly, any medication can cause hair loss, even if it's not listed as a symptom. You may not lose your hair but there is a chance that you will.|`|G8XzWMlDaa	I'm on accutane and a lot of my friends have been on it and no one I know have lost their hair.

9iOHAC41aa	It sounds to me like he was jealous. If i'm reading into this just right it sounds like he really likes you, but he's afraid of relationships (i.e. he's afraid of commitment) and if he were to go out with you he would have to have a commitment towards you.    A lot of guys would rather be single and be able to do what they want with who they want, when they want. I think it's sounds like that's where he is right now. I don't think it has much to do with you in particular, i think it sounds like he likes you more then he wants to admit to himself, and the idea scares him.    If i were you, i would recommend you just go to him and tell him that he needs to make up his mind. Tell him that if he doesn't want to be with you then he needs to stop keeping you from being with someone else. Tell him he either has you or he doesn't, it's his choice. I might throw in it's a one time offer so think hard about his decision, but that's my personality. It might possibly turn him away. Just tell him it's all or nothing, there is no in between.    If he's smart he will think through his options and make the decision that's right, even if it's not in his nature to be committed to one person and one person only.|`|kQ6x5Mokaa	made out, lol yea right you know you did the nasty|`|e8TEnoyKaa	he's probably just really jealous and doesn't want to admit to it. all guys are like this. and he wouldn't be jealous if he didn't like you.    he was definitely lying when he said he didn't have any feelings for you. maybe he likes you a lot, but doesn't want to be in a relationship for some reason.    he also could be upset with his friend because his friend knew that dylan liked you and he kind of betrayed him.    usually the rule with guys is, don't go out or sleep with your friends ex.

0f8aa18b82fb88db8d4d6494758ba7bbaa	I'm making a guess here, but you may be suffering from a form of panic attack syndrome.  It's been my experience that with PAS, people will oftentimes develop an irrational fear that springs from one identifiable event (or not so easily identifiable) that hits them with such force  that from then on, a feeling of dread comes over them each time they find themselves in a similar situation.  I had a friend who would clutch every time they were driving, but only when they went over a long bridge.  Another person I knew, who couldn't have been a more loving mom, had a thought once of picking up scissors and doing something to her child. She was mortified, but now can't completely get the offending thought out of her mind.  Is this what you're experiencing with driving.  If so, think seriously about this question:  was there a defining moment when you were driving or thinking about driving that this thought of killing someone or getting killed yourself "swept" over you?  I've discovered with PAS, that you might have had similar thoughts before and easily dismissed them, but at a particularly vulnerable point the same thought has much greater sway over you, and is frightening at that point.  What makes it frightening is that along with the thought comes the PANIC ATTACK or sense of dread, and we react to the instigating thought in a much more fearful way because of the sensation of panic that attends the thought.  Why it becomes difficult is that we often lose sight of the initial moment when this PANIC(or dread) first hit us, and especially fail to notice that we may have been uniquely (for us) vulnerable at that moment due to prior lack of sleep, excess caffeine intake, outside stress, painful life events, etc. Hope this wasn't too rambling an answer, but the things that best helped me were 1) letting the "feeling" that comes along with the fear wash over me rather that fighting it or trying to shut it off - it loses its sting that way, or 2) the proper antidepressant.|`|AA12291003	some fear is good - it keeps us safe. and now a days with all the crazy drivers out there- and other dangers- it might keep you more alert when you are driving. i wouldn't worry about it. avoid certain situations like holiday driving, or rush hour if you can.|`|432106b047ec50b1227921a91bd6232eaa	Car accidents are damaging events involving road traffic, particularly automobiles. ...particularly by American radio traffic reporters) crashes  kill an estimated 1.2 million people worldwide each year, and injure about forty times this number (WHO, 2004).

You may have ripped it a bit... if it is really red and oozing and irritated it may be infected, in which case you will need antibiotics.  So if it gets worse or doesn't get better or you get a fever go to a doctor immediately.

For example, we are able to overcome and adapt to our situations in addition to us thinkin outisde the box.  Another advantage is that the right side of the brain is the creative side since I am I talented artist just so you know.  Most lefties are creative in music, arts and many other fields that involve creativity.  Plus, we are special, I mean, there are few of us that are left handed so that makes us special (not weird, not sinister, not the minority) (dont believe what other people say and dont believe what the bible says).

AA11094078	Every year Americans invest billions of dollars in weight loss diets and gimmicks, many of which yield few results. However, the lure of quick, easy weight loss is hard to resist. Despite ineffective tools, most hopeful consumers are willing to give the next weight loss fad a chance. If you're planning to start a new diet, it is important to remember the following information.  Food-specific diets: Have you ever tried the cabbage diet or the fruit-only diet? These are just a couple of examples of diets that promote one "specific" food that causes weight loss. No matter how much you think you'll enjoy ice cream at every meal, inevitably you will get bored with eating the same food repeatedly. As a result, you'll eat less food than needed to maintain your weight. This type of diet will not teach you healthier eating habits or provide a balance of nutrients, and consequently is not effective for long-term weight loss.    High-protein, low-carbohydrate diets: One of the most recent trends in dieting, these diets are based on the concept that carbohydrates are "bad" and that everyone has some degree of insulin resistance, resulting in poor carbohydrate metabolism. Many proponents of these diets suggest that including carbohydrates in your diet will cause weight gain. The reality, though, is that eating more calories (whether as carbohydrate, fats, or protein) than you burn will cause weight gain.    High-fiber, low-calorie diets: As I've noted in many previous blog entries, fiber-rich foods play an important role in a healthy diet. They are a helpful ingredient of weight loss efforts because they provide bulk to the diet, which helps you feel fuller sooner. Be careful, though: if you plan to increase the fiber in your diet, be sure to increase your fluid intake at the same time or you may experience cramping, bloating, and constipation. High-fiber diets will help with weight loss only if you restrict calories in conjunction with addition of extra grains, fruits and vegetables.    Liquid diets: Consumers face a couple of different liquid diet options. Your local grocery store and pharmacy sell over-the-counter liquid meal replacements, which can be expensive and frequently add extra calories to daily consumption if not managed carefully. On the other hand are liquid diets that require medical supervision. These diets are usually very low in calories and may result in metabolic abnormalities if dieters are not carefully monitored. Neither type of liquid diet should be used for long?term weight loss unless monitored by a health care professional. Radically changing your caloric intake in this way will not result in long-term behavior modification and healthy eating patterns.    Fasting: As a way to cleanse the body or jump-start a weight-loss program, fasting has been recommended for years. However, all that fasting really does is deprive your body of nutrients and decrease your energy, leaving you feeling weak and lightheaded. If the right nutrients are not available for your cells to use as energy, your liver will convert fat stores to ketones for use as energy (ketosis). Long-term ketosis can be harmful to your health.   No fad diet or gimmick will work magic for safe and effective weight loss. The following are some suggestions for ensuring a long-term healthy eating plan and getting your weight loss efforts off to an encouraging start:   Eat a variety of foods. Remember, a balanced diet will ensure that you get all necessary nutrients.     Get some physical activity every day. Calories in must be less than calories out to ensure successful weight loss. To keep "calories out" at a healthful level, make you get at least 30 minutes of physical activity every day.    Include sources of fiber in your diet. They will add bulk and give you a feeling of fullness.    Choose a diet low in fats, saturated fats, and cholesterol. You do need to consume some fat for good health. Aim for no more than 30 percent of your total calories as fat calories, of which no more than 10 percent should be saturated fat calories.    Choose foods moderate in sugars. Foods that are high in simple sugars usually offer little nutritional value and will add unwanted calories.    Choose foods moderate in salt and sodium. Remember that salt has been added to many foods during preparation or processing, so it's not necessary to add extra salt at the table.|`|AA11612867	Homeopathic Treatment to Loose Excessive Fat and Weight :-  The safest and sure fire way to loose weight and excessive fat is PHYTOLACCA BERRY Q(Mother Tincture) 20 drops thrice a day in a sip of warm water half hour before or after meals.

If not you really need to go to a doctor anyway and have it checked out|`|62700224e32bab996f418005853f87b3aa	White fluid from the breast can mean one or two things either you are in fact pregnant or two it is possible to create this problem within the body by horomones that rise in level.You can in fact make things happen in your body to change your horomone level without really knowing that you infact are the one causing it to happen.Case in point you can think of being pregnant so hard that you will actually have all the symptoms without actually being pregnant.|`|f217823034cd16a1b6e7b24b7cea938aaa	No that is not normal.  Is there a chance that you are pregnant?  That is a condition that can happen when a women is pregnant.  I would seek medical advise from a professional Doctor immediately.|`|AA11316092	Why are you squeezing them|`|c868f8cd9becc472e7efad70518ab6edaa	My advice to you is quickly to see a doctor, don't feel shy.... is good to check with doctor, if you do feel shy, pls look for a female doctor.|`|762b06c63dd6ede1aebb5a5433b59c41aa	This is called galactorrhea, and it is not uncommon, but you probably want to see a doctor.  It is possible that it is caused by a hormone imbalance and she or he can test for that.  (Specifically, too much prolactin.)  Stop trying to make it come out for a few days, then check again -- this kind of thing can go away as abruptly as it started.
AA11112418	Just any cardio that burns fat. My doctor told me that there is no way to target fat in any area of your body. Fat burning happens uniformly across your body. Elliptical works, swimming works too. Just cardio exercise works, along with drinking water (drinking water helps tighten up your skin). Also start doing exercises that work the muscles in your sides and that may help too.|`|AA12280914	plastic surgery * sorry honey * good luck|`|159a34e97754808899837d23fbaddfa7aa	EAT * L E S S *|`|3e01a31d15abfc0a8fe60d5d794e2ef4aa	Eliptical is awesome, but a good cardio is excellent and raises the metabolism.|`|8f8066faf6f11ffc22c426f4de8ef7d3aa	3-5 minutes twice daily of lateral leg lifts combined with a healthy, low-fat diet and 50 minutes of brisk walking per day, no less than 5 times per week will end your love-handle misery.    lay on your side and bend the knee of the leg that is closest to the ground. point your toes on the leg you'll be lifting away from the ground. lift your leg and then lower it. repeat this process while tightening your stomach until you are unable to do another repetition. switch legs and repeat the process. finish out your love-handle killer set by doing ab crunches or sit ups until you are unable to do another crunch or sit up.

1e5e0853c6052a678f1a30684ccdddd6aa	No, it causes more harm then good.  If it worked, wouldn't it be headline news and wouldn't everyone know about it?  Be smart. Be safe.  Be healthy.|`|AA12395428	always go natural pills never work
AA10762620	as with any diet-you should consult with a physician concerning benefits and risks.|`|1e5e0853c6052a678f1a30684ccdddd6aa	Here's the deal with any diet:    You need about 2000 calories a day, on average.  For men, a bit more, for women a bit less.  Since you are above average height, and a male, let's say 2400 calories a day, just for normal activity...  Now, about 3200 calories will equal a pound... So if you exercise for 300-500 calories a day (based upon what you said above), and only eat 1200 calories... your net would be about losing 1/2 lb a day...|`|AA10513488	u will lose weight at a normal pace which is great!
1e5e0853c6052a678f1a30684ccdddd6aa	It depends what you do at the gym.  Tennis is awesome aerobic exercise that burns lots of calories - more so than weight training, generally speaking.  It is also better than treadmill and bikes...|`|ef59e672aac6dd3e1a55ee3a7d9c7ab2aa	Probably for people like me as I find the Gym so boring I could never stick to a routine. With something socal and competitive like tennis you don't realise you are exercising and so you do it often and the benefits result

Also cleaning your skin with a special soap for acne, with tea three or ex Clearasil, morning and evening. Use an liquid oil-free moisturizer. Use a cleaning mask once a week.  Getting sun helps(and salty sea if you can) or go to a solarium helps cleaning your skin. A tan makes acne less visible also, even a self tan or good make-up can help in a "crisis".|`|f4f5ddfe688737074f90ef1230e83949aa	Nothing is fast, but when I use ProActiv and minocycline from the dermatologist (or your regular doc can prescribe) I don't break out. All make-up should be oil free too. Also take vitamins and drink lots of water. Good luck!
AA11596041	Start out by doing alot of walking.  Try walking 30 min to an hour a day.  Increase your activity.  Cut down on the food intake.  It's just a matter of will power and self discipline.  You can do it, just stay motivated!|`|AA12381025	work out alot and cut sugar|`|313cc9ad0176de6c76482daa4620b809aa	about 10 lb per month|`|7e70b1a095d46b549cbdbef5b273fcc2aa	Diet wise-you should try the Cabbage Soup diet (u can look it up online). Doctors put patients on it who are about to have surgery and need to shed weight fast. Drink plenty of water each day, and exercise. Whether it's running, walking, dancing, swimming, or just getting outside and raking for a couple of hours, you should break a serious sweat each day. Good luck with it!|`|a9d029679c0e4be2d0f135f8e989e906aa	It takes a true commitment to change your lifestyle, not just burn through some fad diet; those don't work long term.  100lbs in 10 months is 1 pound every three days which is a healthy rate of weight loss.  Start by drinking lots of water, 64 oz minimum.  Next, eliminate (or close to it) those empty calories and stuff with refined sugars like potato chips, pop and so on.  If possible, exercise when you can.  Eat smaller meals, around 5 - 6 per day.  Don't starve yourself or your body will go out of it's way to store up fat which is the opposite of what you want to accomplish.  Also, don't completely give up the foods you love, just reduce how often you eat them or save them for treats if you exceed your goals.  Calories are the key:  You will only truly lose weight if you consume fewer calories than you burn.  Avoid the fad diets and don't get stressed out over it if you fall off the wagon or don't make certain goals.  It's a long process but it has a lifetime of benefits so take it easy and enjoy it.
AA10513696	No, there is no blood test for diagnosis of Bi-Polar Disorder. A good, diagnostic psychiatrist is the only test there is for a correct assessment. Good Luck !|`|aeb08e46ace6f24e619c41906f6fc42faa	No, unfortunately it can be diagnosed with a good evaluation. (It often is mistaken for ADD or ADHD). However, with good treatment (often with Lithium or newer drugs it can be effectively controlled. But there is no blood test.|`|AA12186300	My sister has bi polar and I think there is a blood test|`|AA11256123	There are no lab test for diagnosing bi-polar disorder (BPDO).  There is a pen and paper test administered by a psychologist called the MMPI that is very helpful in diagnosing BPDO and can help distinguish it from other diagnoses, but as far as i know it is not used much anymore. A good psychiatrist should be the one to diagnos BPDO. Strangely, BPDO has long been undiagnosed, under diagnosed and misdiagnosed. Psychiatrist are now getting very good at diagnosing bipolar disorder and suddenly it has gone from grossly under diagnosed to occasionally over diagnosed.  ~GaryRN|`|201a66c679c9427cd24bc4715a0214f5aa	YES there is!!!!!!!!  It's a Genetic testing for bipolar disorder.   To see if you carry a cerain "gene" that causes the condition.  I myself had some fluid tests that showed I was missing a chemical that my brain was supposed to produce, but was not producing... so the answer is "yes".  I've been BiPolar my whole life, and I'm now 46 years of age... If you wonder if you are BP, then please, see a doctor as soon as possible.  It's a terrible life to live without medication to control it.|`|AA11314116	Blood levels are done after you start the meds to make sure meds are where they need to be and no damage to liver,kidney,etc.

Or, exercise and eat sanely. Go to the gym, get a trainer and reduce your portions to less than 1,000 calories a day.|`|AA10079013	I did it not by going on a diet, but by changing my eating habits permanently. I quit eating sugar and refined flour and switched to meats and milk with less fat. I also started eating a lot of whole grains. The trick was to find healthy foods that I truly enjoyed so that after several months I didn't have cravings for the junk food I used to eat. Now that it has been so long I do have an occasional soda or cheeseburger, but not more than 2 or 3 in a month at the most.
AA11285707	It will heal. You just need to keep it clean and dry as much as possible. You probably should not have sex until this heals. It certainly can get infected, so keeping it clean and dry will help. You could also try putting a small amount of Bacitracin on it to combat infection as well.|`|AA10287254	oh man.....  he must of been fingering you hard.  but anyway....you should be fine just keep the cut clean and no more fingering or sex during the treatment.   OK, go to your local wal-mart or pharmacy and buy yourself some dermoplast, it is in a can, and that spray is for cuts,burns,etc.  it is also to relieve any pain.   i hope this helps.  this is just a suggestion, this is what they give us girls when we give birth.|`|b9a22eb3e90dda26043f23562f814fe4aa	You NEED to see a doctor to get on some antibiotics.  It will heal, but because of the location of the open wound, it is possible to get an infection or a disease.  Stop all sexual contact until you see a doctor (and if you are too embarrassed to see your family doctor, go to a women's health clinic or a walk in clinic).  For future reference,  make sure that your boyfriend has trimmed his fingernails and has clean hands.|`|71b0c2563fd262418efff1d3e86935b2aa	First, take a deep breath.  You aren't the first person this has happened to...  I am not a doctor or a nurse, but someone that has also had this happen... it's the same as any other cut, just in a really tuff spot.  When I had it happen I swallowed my pride and went to the ob/gyn.  She gave me a prescription for some creme to put on and it went away no problem... So if that's an option for you, that's what I would suggest.  If you've never been before, I could see how you would be scared, but trust me, it's something she's seen before.  If you don't know what to tell your Mom, get creative... you could fall off a bike just the right way and have the same thing happen...  Good luck and take care!|`|31d8ec4c7e1abf9b83b363ab92a7c294aa	I don't know who you are trying to fool, but you would n't get torn from that unless, he was using his whole hand. It sounds like you may have major trauma down there and that usually happens when something or someone is trying to force their way in. If something like this did happen with you then you need to let someone know that can help you. Either way, it sounds like you need to get to a doctor soon, yes you may need stitches.

About 30 percent of those who undergo VBG achieve normal weight, and about 80 percent achieve some degree of weight loss. Some patients regain weight. Others are unable to adjust their eating habits and fail to lose the desired weight. Successful results depend on the patients willingness to adopt a long-term plan of healthy eating and regular physical activity.    Retrieved from "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_b...

63826377e910a2e64668d6d21e304f94aa	I have suffered from Panic attacks for almost ten years and am now basically homebound. At the beginning of a panic attack I will get a tingly burning sensation that courses over my body then centers in my chest area.   The symptoms vary from each individual. I used to rely on medication to make it through them, but after going to therapy have learned great techniques to trick my mind out of them. One thing that has helped me, is whenever I start to have one at home, I immediately do something to keep my mind busy; be it play a game on the computer, do the dishes etc. Sitting around and trying to calm myself down with positive thoughts never worked for me.

Insulate your heat source with a towel so that it does not burn you.    Also, make sure you are getting plenty of rest.  The body needs sleep to heal properly, plus, sleep deprivation, even minimal, can lower your threshhold for pain.  So, lack of sleep can not only slow your healing process, but make you hurt more as well.    Eat properly and stay hydrated.  This will also help with pain and healing.    HOpe you feel better!

That way, your body burns the calories you ate in the morning throughout the course of the day. That doesn't mean you can eat whatever you want, though. Healthy, low-calorie foods are a good idea. Also, exercise is a must! I suggest running around your local track every day. To help keep you on the right path, weigh yourself EVERY MORNING! Good luck! (P.S.:About the smoking, you probably should try to stop doing that, too. It makes it harder on your body to function. Don't worry about that now, though. Lose that weight, then tackle your addiction! Good luck!)

The trick is to avoid putting too much pressure on your legs during pregnancy. Incorporate the following tips into your lifestyle even before you have a problem:     ? Exercise daily  even just a brisk walk around the block can help.     ? Elevate your feet and legs whenever possible: Keep a stool or box under your desk, and try to lie down on your left side with your feet elevated on a pillow when at home. Since the inferior vena cava is on the right side, left-sided rest relieves it of the weight of the uterus; thus decreasing venous pressure in the lower extremities.     ? Try sleeping on your left side with your feet on a pillow. Wedge a pillow behind your back to keep yourself tilted to the left side.     ? Before getting out of bed in the morning, put on special support pantyhose. By putting them on before standing, you'll prevent excess blood from gathering in your legs. Prescription-strength hose, known as graduated-compression stockings, are available from medical supply stores and pharmacies. These hose are as thick as two pair of normal pantyhose. Tight at the ankle, they get looser as they go up the leg, swuishing blood up from the calves and lending support to surface veins that nature neglected. If you don them prophylactically during pregnancy, they may help deter swollen veins. Unfortunately, they can't eliminate varicose veins you already have, but they can prevent them from getting worse. One caveat: These hose are likely to be uncomfortable, especially in hot weather.     ? Don't stand on your feet for long periods of time.     ? Don't cross your legs when sitting down.     ? Strive to keep within the recommended weight range for your stage of pregnancy|`|827240d3ae56fbdf8fd5cb67db5ce865aa	Go to a dermatologist or vein specialist.

In order to be sure, you can go to a doctor, ask him to tell you if you already stopped growing, and go for the X rays he eventually will order. Once done, if you do not have more chances to grow -not so difficult to determine- then it is always possible to go the hard way.  This means a surgery that breaks bones in your legs with at least two different techniques depending where you can go and how much you can pay.  The process takes many months to allow the enlarging of the bone scar that it will be forming by pulling both ends of the broken bones periodically and the enlargement of the muscles.     In the meantime, think if is worthy for a woman with a normal height to go through such a process, and in case of getting decided, have patience, ask for the wounds - less or more depending the used method - and expect to gain up to 10 more centimeters with the surgical procedure.

It may also be torn following vigourous exercise, trauma Or may be absent in certain women congenitally.......|`|faca3f6ccd6083c716bae8d5a5c390a0aa	When somone loses their virginity, it is assumed that the person has had intercourse with another.   The female has a membrane in her vagina called the Hymen.  If the Hymen is in tact or "not broken" that female is assumed to never have had sexual intercourse.  The Hymen can however,  "break" by other reasons as well such as masturbation with a held held device, or simply by some sort of trauma by other non-sexual means.  The term Virgin is most commonly used to mean that the person has never had sexual intercourse with another.  But others use the word Virgin to mean that the Hymen is still in tact, but since there are many causes for the Hymen to not be in tact, one could be wrong in assuming that the girl is not a virgin when her Hymen is "broken".

7f90fde3427a46e70c982bad0310bf58aa	It all depends the upon individuals. First of all, I don't know whether you R a male R female. No matter the penis size. All you must know is HOW 2 use it, WHEN 2 use it, WHERE 2 use it and WHY 2 use it, also finaly 2 WHOM 2 use it. Usually the normal penis size of a Man (universally) is 5 to 7 inches on very good erection and it is depends upon the individual too. As a Sexologist I have not seen any one more than 7 inch and other sizes all available in the store by the name of DILDOOS, which hurt the partner, then ends up in the ER. I always suggest 2 my patients the smaller size is the best, if it is the FIRST time sex in her life. If she starts with the bigger and longer size then she will have problem in her future as she won't be satisfied with the manof different size. Also you must know 2 satisfy a women the small pinky is enough and the matter is where and how you use it. I have answered some of this kind of ?-s earlier in this site. You must know one thing that still in this MODERN world so many people don't know how to have sex. That's is the reason we have SEX EDUCATORS, COUNSELS, SEX THERAPISTS.source is SIECUS also kinsey institute, Master's and Johnson's institute, Sinclair Institute etc. It is a universal matter. Regarding the color it is Ok to have any color, again all depends upon the your partner who accepts, it. Some people like black, brown, pink. But all about is what your gene was carrying- THE SIZE and COLOR. Be happy with what you have, if you R a Male and say thanks to the CREATOR. Bcoz I had a patient who seen a Dr. to enlarge his penis and got a Injection over the penis and end up in PRIAPSISM, almost for a week and came to me and I detumisised  by draining all the blood  from his penis. Be careful when you seek these kind of methods to enlarge the magic wand. Best of luck|`|66b515ba81d0ca208a573be61b904e63aa	I guess I would choose 12 inches, because 6 inches is just not enough to give me the big "O".  I guess it might be possible, but no man with that size manhood has pulled it off.    My current bf was only 5.5 until I made him do something about it.  We tried enzyte and it was ok (he got a little bit better) but he didn't really gain until he tried http://www.justonemoreinch.com  Now he is almost 8 inches and it is perfect.|`|08a2ece3bfd026fa0698779b84102ab4aa	donsent really matter to me how big it is, just as long as he knows how to use it, and color just as long as its not green|`|AA12224960	Well I don't know but why don't you try them out and let all of us know ...Numb Skull!!!....PS..... did i win........ did i win...... did i win?|`|24c70ddc0046f3d953aee21dabdb9664aa	6".

Peel back some of the skin and chop or grate about 1 1/2 teaspoons of root and steep it in a cup of hot water for 5-10 minutes.  Strain the tea.

Aspirin not only helps keep platelets from causing clots(by clumping together), but keeps your body from producing something called proteglandins. Prosteglandins can call out even more platelets(sort of like reinforcements) when a clot is formed, so taking that aspirin can really save a life.

5e759fa68d14e658cc0ab663d6c93207aa	A atividade sexual excessiva (defini??o da ninfomania em sentido restrito) s come?ou a ser considerada doen?a no sculo XIX, marcado pela repress?o sexual e a moral vitoriana. O neurologista Richard Krafft Ebing, que viveu em finais desse sculo, afirmou que os casos mais extremos podiam mesmo conduzir  morte. O psiquiatra Maresch deu-lhe raz?o ao documentar trs exemplos em 1871: dizia que as vtimas morriam de esgotamento por causa dos delrios obscenos.    Mas o que mais inquietava os mdicos era perceber as causas do problema. Os adeptos do movimento frenolgico pensaram que a origem estava no crebro e que as vtimas da doen?a tinham o cerebelo muito desenvolvido. A autpsia a uma ninfomanaca, contudo, mostrou que tal idia estava errada. Mais tarde, avan?ou-se com a teoria do tamanho excessivo do clitris, mas tambm se comprovou n?o fazer sentido. E assim, atravs do mtodo tentativa-erro, concluiu-se que a ninfomania era causada por distrbios psquicos.      A ninfomania  uma variante do comportamento sexual em que a mulher se sente compelida a mudar constantemente de parceiro, sem estabelecer um relacionamento estvel com nenhum deles, explica o psiclogo Gabriel Frada. Acima de tudo, a ninfomania est inscrita na personalidade da mulher. A sua inseguran?a profunda n?o lhe permite liga??es afetivas consistentes  o fundo psicolgico de base  o medo.    Hoje em dia sobram teorias sobre as causas da ninfomania, mas nenhuma delas  totalmente convincente. At porque a origem da ninfomania varia conforme os casos. Entre as explica??es dadas, as seguintes s?o as mais comuns: tentativa de compensar a priva??o sexual sofrida na adolescncia; inveja do pnis e desejo de vingar-se do pai; necessidade de compensar certas tens?es emocionais; nega??o de tendncias homossexuais; medo de frigidez; necessidade de ser amada e aceita.      Uma mulher com bastante apetite sexual n?o  necessariamente desequilibrada. Como assinala o psiquiatra Stoller, as rela??es sexuais s?o relevantes para a mulher ninfomanaca, n?o em termos de gratifica??o ertica, mas como uma maneira de satisfazer a necessidade de auto-afirma??o.    A mulher saudvel com bastante apetite sexual tem essa dota??o de viver com entusiasmo a cada rela??o e desejo de renovar o prazer alcan?ado. Na prtica, quando a mulher consegue dominar o seu interesse sexual indiscriminado e dirigi-lo para um nico parceiro, considera-se que o seu apetite sexual n?o chega aos nveis do que  tpico da ninfomania, diz Gabriel Frada.      A ninfomanaca, embora experimente excita??o, raramente chega a atingir o orgasmo, o que a deixa frustada e a leva a procurar novas experincias erticas. Uma libido excepcionalmente intensa pode n?o ser patolgica; os dotes superiores aos da mdia n?o tornam a pessoa anormal, acrescenta este psiquiatra. Quando a mulher com grande apetite sexual leva uma vida satisfatria em termos de afeto, profiss?o, relacionamento interpessoal e atua??o social, n?o necessita de qualquer tratamento.    As teorias explicativas da ninfomania n?o se limitam contudo ao campo da psicologia. Segundo alguns autores, a origem desta patologia reside por vezes em fatores de ordem neurofisiolgica.  A conduta sexual  regulada pelo sistema lmbico, situado no crebro. Enquanto o ncleo amigdalide e o hemisfrio esquerdo regulam a inibi??o da sexualidade, o hipotlamo e o hemisfrio direito elaboram a estimula??o e desenvolvem a organiza??o ertica e o orgasmo. Quando estas duas ltimas reas registram maior atividade,  provvel que se produza uma exalta??o da conduta sexual. A influncia  tal que, se um traumatismo afeta as reas citadas, pode em determinadas ocasi?es, provocar a ninfomania. Os neurotransmissores tambm influenciam o nosso comportamento ertico. Nas ninfomanacas, d-se uma hiperfun??o dos sistemas dopaminrgico e noradrenergtico (a dopamina e a noradrenalina s?o ativadoras sexuais, em oposi??o  serotonina e s endorfinas, que s?o inibidoras).    Nos tratamentos feitos atualmente, a psicoterapia est na primeira linha, uma vez que a doen?a  quase sempre de origem psicolgica. Procura-se que a paciente aprenda a vincular sexo e afeto, assim como a eliminar altera??es psicolgicas que costumam acompanhar a ninfomania  parania, ansiedade e depress?o.  Quando se suspeita de problemas de ordem neurofisiolgica, recorre-se a estimulantes da serotonina, para inibir o sistema dopaminrgico, tranquilizantes e antidr?genos para reduzir a testosterona, o horm?nio que faz aumentar o desejo. Segundo Gabriel Frada, porm, as tentativas para tratar a ninfomania com horm?nios n?o resultaram bem at aos dias de hoje.  Mas n?o deve existir a mnima hesita??o em recorrer ao tratamento, caso a mulher suspeite sofrer do problema: quando n?o h esse sentido de realiza??o e a mulher se autoculpabiliza,  aconselhvel a consulta a um especialista em psicologia profunda. A resolu??o dos conflitos internos permitir depois um desenvolvimento mais produtivo das potencialidades da paciente.

Building muscle will help you burn calories hours after you've left the gym. Both are essential to lose those love handles.  As for exercises, do crunches. Lay on your back. Bicycle your legs bringing your knees to your chest and alternate bringing your opposite elbow to the opposite knee. It's hard to explain, but if you can picture it, that exercise really works. You can also do isomertic holds. Put ankle weights on. Lay on your back again and lift your legs about 4-5" off the floor with your feet spread open about a foot and a half apart.

(desculpe a express?o  mas  a mais pura verdade   a nica forma mesmo! Amigo):  N?o acredito em nenhuma frmula mgica (medicamentos, acupuntura, tratamento psiquitrico, psicanlise, etc. - pode at ajudar, desde que voc queira parar, mas para que isso ajude no tratamento, voc tem que querer, e assim sendo, porque n?o parar por conta prpria?).   Eu comecei a fumar com 15 anos de idade, fumei at os 35 anos, (ou seja - durante vinte anos) ininterruptamente. Quando acordava no meio da noite ou de madrugada a primeira coisa que fazia era tatear no escuro para achar a carteira de cigarros e o isqueiro; e quantas vezes n?o sa no meio da noite ou da madrugada para comprar cigarros, pois os meus tinham acabado. Saia feito um maluco na cidade a procura de um bar aberto pra tomar caf e comprar cigarros; fumava Minister, mas naquelas alturas da madrugada o que achasse estava de timo tamanho. - Quando parei, aos 35 anos de idade estava fumando de 2-1/2 carteiras   3 carteiras num espa?o de 24 horas. Era praticamente um no toco do outro.  Todo fumante (+ as mulheres) tem (dizer ter) medo de fumar e engordar demais; isso pode acontecer, mas para isso voc tem meios saudveis de controlar (o peso),isso voc pode controlar tranquilamente,atravs de hbitos saudveis como alimenta??o,caminhadas, academia,etc.  Para finalizar -  minha histria foi a seguinte: aos 35 anos de idade, comecei a sentir                                    uma forte dor no peito, lado esquerdo, e achei que poderia ser  problema cardaco (isso h18 anos atrs - hoje tenho52 anos de idade).  Fui ao mdico, e meu eletrocardiograma estava alterado, e ele recomendou que fizesse o mais rpido possvel um Cateterismo, pois provavelmente havia alguma artria, veias, etc. entupidas, ou quase entupidas.  O outro exame, pois j tinha ouvido falar no Cateterismo, que o substituiria e n?o tinha nenhuma dor era um exame que s fazia em SP como o nome de Cintilografia Computadorizada! era caro e s fazia-se no Albert Einstein.  Arrumei um dinheiro, fui pra l, fiz esse exame e estava tudo ok  tudo perfeito com meu sistema cardiolgico como um todo.  Parti para outros exames mais simples, desses rotineiros que a gente hoje faz periodicamente, e qual era o problema?- Glicose alta-quase 300(o ideal  entre70 e 110)- no sangue- isto , eu estava com Diabetes tipo - II- e n?o sabia; o porqu da altera??o no Eletrocardiograma! Minha Glicose no sangue estava quase que o triplo do normal -  como se voc colocasse 12 pessoas num Fusquinha e rodasse direto, sem parar, com certeza ele iria arriar fundir; assim  o nosso corpo, uma mquina, perfeita, mas que ter que ser bem cuidada, sen?o...Adios...!  Tirei uns raios-X do meu pulm?o e depois de pronto o Mdico pegou um raios-X de um pulm?o sadio  a diferen?a: o pulm?o sadio tinha uma cor levemente cor-de-rosa, os meus pareciam dois enormes peda?os de carv?o! A ele explicou-me que se eu quisesse viver uma vida saudvel, e por muitos anos, teria que fazer 4 coisas importantssimas daquela data em diante: 1-Parar de fumar imediatamente; 2- Come?ar a tomar o remdio para controlar a Glicose (Diabinese  comprimidos tomo at hoje); 3-Alimenta??o saudvel (frutas, legumes, saladas, folhas, alimentos integrais, cereais e tudo que contm fibras; pois tudo isso ajudar na digest?o e  controlar a glicose no sangue; 4) Exerccios (leves) (caminhadas, andar de bicicleta, academias (esteira,etc.); de preferncia de manha ou  tardinha, pois o sol que ajuda no combate ao Triglicrides (entre 6 hs e 9hs, e, entre 16 hs em diante).  Nunca mais fumei, fa?o caminhadas todas as dias praticamente (pelo menos1 hora por dia) sinto-me otimamente bem, e minha glicose nunca mais passou dos 130, mas normalmente est dentro da faixa normal, como tambm o Colesterol e o Triglicrides, pois se a Glicose aumenta, esses dois aumentam tambm e  a que o perigo mora!  Amigo - essa histria  real, eu passei por isso, e hoje me sinto um cinqent?o com cara e disposi??o de um trint?o/quarent?o - mas sen?o tivesse parado de fumar - com certeza estaria a sete palmos do ch?o; e ainda pretendo viver bastante se DEUS quiser mas para isso tenho que me cuidar  se n?o a vaca vai pro brejo!  Espero ter contribudo coma sua pergunta e que ajude a resolver seu problema em para de fumar - Pense no teu amanh?, na tua sade, alm de que, coloque no papel quanto voc vai economizar parando de fumar, pois alm de estar queimando dinheiro - est queimando tambm a tua sade! - Pense nisso! Fa?a isso com F e Muita For?a de Vontade e ver que voc vai superar com a maior tranqilidade!  Um Grande e Fraterno Abra?o e espero ter sido til em minha resposta,e que esta lhe ajude a pensar melhore e livre-se desse vicio maldito que chama-se cigarro!  Fraternalmente.

AA11602174	I actually used to smoke until 2 years ago, I used to feel that nothing like emphazima, lung cancer, etc could happen to me or my familly. Until one day, my grandfather was diagnosed with lung cancer and emphazima, he was able to battle it for 5 years... One day he went to the dr, had an xray and the cancer had inflammed, they started heavy radiology and chemo treatments, they did another xray shortly after, the lung cancer had shrunk and was almost gone... what they didn't know was it moved to his lymph node and had already started progressing in his brain... The sight of what he had to go through, made me not want to smoke anymore!  He was miserable, after a few days, couldn't remember who anyone was... forgot that he needed to eat (he didn't want to do anything he didn't think he had to do)  Eventually it got so bad, he ended up passing away!  I just imagined, what if I go through this with all my children and grandchildren and husband?  I would not want them to see me like this!  So I decided for my families sake and for my health to quit... Hopefully you think about your kids, if you love them enough, you should be able to put down the cigarettes and not take a second look at them...  Everytime I thought about having a cigarette, I thought of how my grandfather looked from doing the same exact thing that I was craving...  After a while, I got involved into hobbies (bike riding, going to the gym is GREAT!, hanging out with friends who did not smoke more often, etc) eventually, your cravings go away and you sit and think, "What was I thinking?"  Hopefully this helps open your eyes as to how bad it can be and how fast problems can progress through your body...  Here are some programs if you need additional help  http://www.nicotine-anonymous.org/  http://www.givingupsmoking.co.uk/  http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/how2quit.htm  http://www.stopsmokingtoday.com/|`|AA11985089	Transdermal patches, starting with the highest, 28, then 14, then 7.

f7d33c04a72a7226a9f74dd65f7f929faa	Please do not try fad diets that rarely work in the long run and consider a healthy life style change.    The following healthy living recommendations will help you if youre trying to lose weight, tone up your muscles, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:    *1) Burn more calories then you're consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity minus the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF). A website that explains this formula in more detail and will help you determine how many calories you need to reach or maintain a certain weight is at http://www.primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/...    Get a diet and fitness calculator that you can put on your computer or cell phone. This will allow you to easily calculate the above formula, set goals, log your daily calorie consumption, and register your physical activities.     Set realistic goals for your ideal body weight. Here are two websites that will calculate a suggested body weight:          Adults: http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/body.ht...  Teens/Children: http://www.kidshealth.org/kid/exercise/w...    It is difficult and unhealthy to lose more than one or two pounds per week. There are 3,500 calories in a pound. If you eat 500 fewer calories per day for a week you will lose one pound. If you burn through exercise 500 more calories per day for a week you will lose one pound.     *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement.     Avoid High Glycemic Load Carbs (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as potatoes) and drink lots of water. Read this article for more information on high GL Carbs:  http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsou...    Do not try fad diets or diet pills. Here is an excellent food pyramid that anyone can follow: http://www.rayandterry.com/html/images/P...    *3) Exercise on most days by doing cardiovascular training and/or resistance training activities.     Read a book or find a certified trainer to make sure your doing all resistance training exercises correctly. A great book to buy that teaches you the resistance training basics is Weight Training for Dummies. A superb magazine to buy with resistance training routines that will not get you bored is "Muscle and Fitness". Signup for the free newsletter. An excellent free online resource is at http://www.exrx.net/    A good book to buy that teaches you the cardiovascular training basics is Fitness for Dummies.     *4) Get plenty of sleep. Sleep experts say most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night for optimum performance, health, and safety.     *5) Educate yourself continually on health issues and make a life long commitment to good health. A great free publication is Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005. A superb book to read is You The Owners Manual. An excellent periodic publication is the Nutrition Action Health Letter. A reputable test you can take to measure your biological age is at http://realage.com    Look at all areas where you can enhance your health. For example, make improvements in the quality of the air you breathe. Review outdoor air quality forecasts where you live and get an indoor air purifier. Send me an email or yahoo instant message to "gainbetterhealth" if you want an indoor air purifier recommendation and if you have any questions.    *Click on all the source links below to get the full benefit of the recommendations.

Eat from the food guide, getting lots of veggies and only eating whole wheat (preferably multi-grain) grain products.

I took off 90 lbs by going to weight watchers but I took it off slowly, ate smaller portions, ate higher fiber fruits and veggies, drunk lots of water, and got active.   There are a lot of weight loss programs out there and I don't know if you can afford to go to WW, but it is well worth it.I lost weight with WW after trying and being on every and all the weight loss programs that ever was. I just started out cutting out part of my fat and calories and then it got easier from there. I am 5'1" and weighed  238. I have 15 more lbs to go. So you can do it!|`|089b7a6e2947c4ac72e81faf6ca1e641aa	I would suggest a cleansing diet.  I did this and lost 11 pounds and 16 inches in 9 days.  I like the program since it works by giving your body nutrition through protein shakes with digestive enzymes and vitamins and then cleansing out the toxins.  We get toxins in our bodies from pesticides, preservatives, water, pollution, medications, food additives etc. These toxins enter our bodies and get coated with fat. To remove the extra fat, we need to get rid of the toxins through cleansing.  The program also has a natural diet pill to help your metabolism and curb cravings.  It works and it works fast.

As for ORAL SEX, this is probabally AS dangerous, if not MORE dangerous than vaginal or anal sex COMBINED. You are still allowing contaminated semen to enter your body, & STDs are even MORE contractable through the MOUTH than through vaginal or anal openings, as you are swallowing contaminated semen DIRECTLY into your main system, where it will begin to spread IMMEADIATELY, as opposed to vaginal or anal sex, wherein you may still have a SMALL amount of time before it enters into the body (UNLESS you have any open sores or blisters in or around the vaginal or anal area, wherein you might ALREADY be infected.).    Not only is oral sex more DANGEROUS in terms of RISKS, it's just plain GROSS anyway. ICK! Why would anyone want to swallow someone's SEMEN in the first place? Have you ever TASTED semen before? It's DISGUSTING! & after all of that, what kind of pleasure are YOU getting out of it? NOTHING! So, by all means, my dear, PLEASE do NOT preform oral sex on your partner, & if you do, PLEASE use a condom.|`|AA10493015	The Padian study suggests that AIDS is not sexually transmitted.

She should be more worried about just eating healthy. Eat lots of fruit and veggies, tell her to make water her best friend (8-10 glasses of it every day), but NOT to starve herself (the only thing that does is make you sick and tells your body to hold onto what fat it's got, becuase it thinks it's being starved).     honestly. Not preaching, and having been just this side of heavy most of my life (was NEVER one of the skinny girls) , I know how peer pressure can be. Just be healthy. The truth is, the only people who thinks she's fat is the one staring back at her in the mirror.

Cardio is a good way to do this. To tone the muscle you will need to do exercises to focus on the muscle, such a sit ups, leg lifts, leg presses, etc.     Also, keep in mind that some people will NEVER be able to achieve flat abs or the legs they due to genetics. Don't get discouraged if you can't get the look you want. You may not be able to because of your genes.

Carey explains, Many of these products are not licensed medicines. This means theyre not allowed to make certain claims such as speeds up metabolism or stops fat from being absorbed. This in turn means theres often a worrying lack of information on the packaging.  But the problems with over-the-counter slimming pills dont just stop there.  some may actually do more harm than good. Certain over-the-counter slimming pills may not be suitable if you have medical conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure, yet this may not be clear from the packaging with the result that women with these conditions still try them. Some may also interact with other medications. For example, taking a slimming pill that includes a thyroid-stimulating ingredient could interfere with prescribed medication for an underactive thyroid, potentially causing problems. Again the packaging might not make this obvious.  But unfortunately, a lack of information, little proof theyll work and potentially putting your health at risk is not the only price youll need to be prepared to pay. Most over-the-counter pills are extremely expensive, too, with the result that you can be sure youll lose pounds  but probably not the right sort!  Nevertheless, if youre still tempted to try an over-the-counter slimming tablet, there are plenty to choose from. Bear in mind that most of them recommend, or come with, a reduced-calorie diet plan and suggest taking more exercise, which generally explains why they result in weight loss! Bear in mind, too, that while some of these tablets may claim to be supported by research, this is likely to be a one-off small study.  for some examples.    Theres certainly a place for Xenical and Reductil in the treatment of obesity. If you think you might be a suitable candidate to try these drugs, see your GP for advice. However, theres little scientific evidence to suggest that over-the-counter slimming pills will help you lose weight and keep it off. You wouldnt expect vitamin supplements to compensate for a diet that contained no fruit or veg, and you shouldnt expect an over-the-counter slimming pill to compensate for a high-calorie diet and inactive lifestyle!  To lose weight safely and sensibly, you need to tackle the poor eating habits and lack of exercise that helped you gain weight in the first place. If you concentrate on making long-term changes to your diet and lifestyle, you wont need to resort to quick fix remedies. But if you still cant resist the fantastic promises, at least avoid those products that make outrageous claims. If a product sounds to be good to be true, then it probably is!  Avoid slimming pills if they  ? Promise a quick fix  sorry, but you didnt put the weight on overnight so you cant expect to lose it overnight!  ? Promote rapid weight loss  thats anything more than 2lb a week!  ? Suggest you dont need to change your eating habits or take more exercise  you know its not true!  ? Fail to come with dietary advice  or worst still, come with a faddy diet that cuts out certain groups of foods, considerably restricts your food intake or encourages you to eat vast amounts of one particular food!  Do slimming pills ever work?  Sometimes over-the-counter slimming pills can work, but this generally has little to do with their ingredients. Theyre more likely to help you lose weight because  ? They come with a reduced-calorie diet plan that generally provides between 1,000 and 1,400 calories a day and recommend taking more exercise. Its this that causes the weight to drop off!  ? You usually need to drink large amounts of water with the pills. This helps to fill you up so you feel less hungry and eat less as a result!  ?

And omega-3 is very very good for you!  I've also read about a diet that has you taking spoonfuls of extra virgin olive oil,  but I think I like swallowing pills better, thank you very much ;)

Do aerobics and lift light weights but do high repetitions (ie.  3 sets of 15 repetitions of leg curls).  Take a multivitamin once or twice a day and don't take any dietary weight loss supplements, as I think you are too young for that and those can be dangerous anyway.

Park in the furthest parking space from your office, favorite restaurant, shopping center, etc.  Start taking the stairs.  If you're a member at a gym, do a cardio workout on whatever cardio machine suits your tastes.  I prefer the treadmill, but that's just me.    Drink plenty of water.  It's good for your body and helps keep you feeling full.  Don't eat three huge meals, eat 6 small ones.  One serving of carbs and one of protein.  Throw in fruits and veggies when you can.    You will want to throw in some resistance training after the two weeks is up (I'm assuming you have something going on in two weeks) to help build lean mass and help increase your metabolism.

Its actually very easy to lose weight if you follow my weight loss tips.          * Be in right frame of mind        Before you can start any diet program you need to be in the right frame of mind. If you do not feel good about yourself you probably will not want to choose healthy foods. You cannot expect the act of going on a diet to make you feel better about yourself. The only way you can choose to eat a healthy diet to lose weight is if you have a positive self-image.        * Eat whole food        Top weight loss tips        Eat whole foods that are as natural as possible. When you eat whole foods that are full of nutrients your body will know how much to eat and how much not to eat. You do not have to count calories because your body is a wonderful machine.        * Eat fresh fruit        Eat at least two servings of fresh fruit every day. Choose whatever type of fruit is in season.        * Drink enough water        Drink the best weight loss supplement known to man, water. Most people do not know the difference from being hungry for food or thirsty for water. A great deal of times people eat when they should drink. Most likely you will not feel as hungry if you are getting enough water. You will be satisfying the thirst, which is confused for hunger. Water also helps you digest food better. Drinking water before you eat will help fill you up.        * Always chew your food        Always chew your food well. Chewing your food well will ensure that you get the most nutrients out of your food. Getting the most nutrients will satisfy your body therefore you will eat less. Another benefit of chewing well is that it helps aid in digestion.        * Take small meals        Eat small, frequent meals in a day. Large meals tax your digestion system, making it work harder. Taking too much time in between meals makes you hungrier for the next meal.        * Include protein at meal        Include good sources of protein at meal, chicken, fish, legumes, peanut, cottage cheese, eggs or yogurt.        * Shut off TV while eating        Shut off the TV whenever you eat  that includes meals and snacks. Studies show that we automatically eat larger portions when we snack in front of the tube, and typically those foods are high in fat and sugar, which means excess calories!        * Increase your physical activity        Increase your physical activity. Most people are over weight because of a lack of physical activity. Start walking more, bicycling, walks your dog for longer periods of time, swim, dance and leave the car at home when you can. Its important that you choose a physical activity that you enjoy because youll stick with it.|`|f9fdbdfe1a4779e06b08653b93477461aa	run every day, for 30-45 minutes|`|6a4d47592a37e6a598ab2a2e22b019b3aa	Stack up on more vegetables and fruits|`|4dbecb5a1808eb7060831f40031cf513aa	I lost 40 lbs. from January to March. 15 of the lbs. came off with a Colon Cleansing Liquid Diet I tried.

This is the fastest I have ever lost with other diets like Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, Medifast, Slimfast etc. Cleansing works by removing toxins from your body.  You get toxins from your food (pesticides, preservatives, food additives, colorings) water, chemicals, pollution, medications, alcohol, hormones that the animals you eat were fed etc.YUCK!  The toxins get coated with fat and remain in your body.  To remove the fat, you have to remove the toxins.  This system worked for me, maybe it can work for you too.

Una mujer desde que empieza a menstruar debe reconocer sus senos a mitad del ciclo para as detectar a tiempo cualquier cosa. Igualmente, despus de los 40 debe acudir a realizarse una mamografa.|`|00ac629ef1158c0725309b0877e9efcbaa	Ginecologa: TODAS las mujeres deben tener dos tipos de examen de glndula mamaria; 1o: AUTO-EXAMEN DE MAMA y 2o: MAMOGRAFIA. Estos exmenes NO son para detectar CNCER, son para PREVENIRLO. Estos exmenes NO te dicen si tienes cncer o no; lo que consigues con ellos es determinar la presencia de "Masas", las cuales pueden ser benignas o malignas.  1o Auto-Examinacion: (3) pasos; a) de pie frente a un espejo y visualizar-observar, b) Palpacin de Pie, c)Palpacin acostada boca arriba. (buscar por anormalidades)  2o Mamografia: Toma de fotografas de la glndula mamaria atravez de los Rayos Xs. (se observa por la 'existencia' opacidades)  Para detectar CNCER, debe hacerce con una Biopsia de Aspirado por aguja, dirigida hacia una masa en particular, ya detectada, y esto solo se hace para descartar la malignidad de la masa. Del 100% de las masas de seno, solo el10% son malignas, y del 100% de ese 10%, solo un 2% son mortales. Entonces si el porcentaje de malignidad es tan bajo, porque mujeres mueren de cncer de seno?. Pues porque no hacen los pasos 1o y 2o (PREVENCIN).|`|e9d67f49dc3191b70f7af4a8e9d8e7b7aa	Es altamente recomendable para aquellas con antecedentes en la familia directa con cncer en cualquier parte...o si sufrsite golpes en los senos....y es mandatorio a las mujeres cada dos a?os a lso 40 y cada a?o despus de los 50...
