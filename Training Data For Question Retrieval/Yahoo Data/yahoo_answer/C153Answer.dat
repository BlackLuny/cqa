cP0NnP6Oaa	you got her pregnant so that means you have sperm. grow some testicles for that matter breaking up with her is NOT the right thing to do. if you two arent ready for a baby then dont have sex or atleast use 2 yes 2 contraceptives like birthcontrol and a condom.  calm down have have her calm down she needs to take a test if she misses her period.|`|3818ade1cea66b6848cdf38542c206f3aa	no i dont think you should break up but it might end up that way .<br>  if she's talking suicide she might be afraid of what her parents might think or what shes assumed from them over the years .I think the right thing to do might be to find the time and sit down with or on a phone conversation tell them you might of got their daughter pregnant and that your concerned and dont know quite what to do and show your concern about what she said (thoughts of suicide )and maybee do this on your own dont ask for her approal before talking to them .so they can understand your situation and approach their daughter in a way that dont push her toward the bad (killing herself )type of way .i'm shure they would understand to a point .but thats what the situation is and what needs to be dealt with ...it might be quite stressfull but that might be a safe way in this situation for everyones benifit that no one get's hurt|`|v8F2UeXCaa	break up? youv got to be taking the mick. If she is pregnant and on the brink you think leaving her cope alone will solve anything? if she is pregnant you really need to consider if your mature enough to bring a life into the world because im not sure you are|`|AA12147036	Definitely don't break up with her.<br>  <a href="http://www.authspot.com/Short-Stories/The-Man-Next-Door.446407" rel="nofollow">http://www.authspot.com/Short-Stories/Th...</a>|`|x18w912Xaa	Breaking up with her will make it worse! Omg don't do that! You're her boyfriend, if you love her, you'll stick by her side no matter what, and make her realize that she's too important to her family and you to leave now. You two are 14 you have your lives ahead of you, whether you have the baby or not, your lives are not over! There's always a way to do things. And trust me, God wouldn't give you something you could not handle, and if she isn't, maybe this is a lesson learned to be a lot more careful next time, dear. :)|`|6ZUnRxV5aa	This is what happens when 2 very immature, irresponsible, CHILDREN that tend to engage themselves in an adult situation. For your girlfriend tell her to cut the crap if she decided to spread her legs and have sex especially with out any birth control than she should now face the consequence, same goes to you.|`|NtwlsAhUaa	well you can't just break up with her. just talk 2 her about it and i'm sure you will work things out. I am exactly the same age as you and we share the same birthday :) you just should discuss it with her and you should work something out.|`|1xGvmtb6aa	OMG U ARE ONLY 14!!!!! dnt break up with her cause that  just shows what type of "man" u are if she's are pregnant take care of her n the baby n trust me she wont kill herself she's just scared what her parent might say but i would too she's only 14|`|vQ5YXVycaa	definately dont leave her! that will only drive herself even more to kill herself. she will need ur support and the baby will also. just be there for her and be there with her wen she tells her parents.|`|1BnuJ5VVaa	OMG KIDS THESE DAYS. WAT EVER YOU DO DO NOT BREAK UP WITH HER THAT WILL PUT HER IN MORE DANGER. FIRST YOU NEED TO TELL A GROWN UP AND LET HE KNOW THAT SHE IS NOT ALONE<br>  <br>  <br>  DON'T BREAK UP WITH HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|5p0AW33jaa	don't break up, this is the time she will be needing you the most. you would have to be there to support her. it would be very unfair to her if your just leave everything like that. talk to her about this and decide what to do next. you have to be grown ups you know in dealing with this. hope everything goes well.|`|qIEhu6uxaa	I know you're scared, but you can't break up with her.  That would make it all worse and you don't want to leave her all alone in this.  Her parents won't kill you.  They'd go to jail if they did.  Therefore she will not kill herself.  You have to be by her side through all of this.  She needs support just like you do.  Let her know you're just as scared but that you're there for her.  You are both seriously too young to have a baby which means you're too young to be having sex.  If you make it through this, stop having sex!<br>  <br>  Remember that there is always the option of abortion (which I hate to recommend) and adoption.
kjgonYlgaa	Take a 2nd test. If negative then you should see a doctor and find out what's wrong.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Take another test BUT if your periods were a normal to heavy flow it was an actual menstrual period and you are not pregnant. Periods can be late when someone is stressed. I doubt you are pregnant.|`|3Boqr4Jjaa	Congratulation! or do the test again.<br>  <br>  RN|`|Pfge6j7Aaa	Some women have periods while they are pregnant
7VjhcEk8aa	No the size isn't equal to the month of your baby...If your baby is 5 months I would say you will need a size 3 or 4 thats what my baby wears...|`|Lz2N7D0yaa	When we started buying shoes for my son, we tried the shoes on first. He has wide feet, so getting the Wide ones fit way better than not getting them. He's now 15 months and in a size 6. So no, I wouldn't say it goes by how many months the baby is. Maybe he just needs a 4 :)|`|NXeLcbO0aa	il depend on t baby,is lso e a when thy ar toddlers.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	There's really no SHOULD.  It's like, what size shoe should a 34 year old woman be wearing?  Some wear 6, some wear 12.  <br>  <br>  Try on shoes, find one that fits him.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	my dd is almost 9mos old and wears a zero, a one is still a little too big for her foot, but will work....so i think they are all very different...she is petite though very healthy|`|OHq5gSjJaa	Actually babies feet can vary really widely...  A five month old could be wearing anything from a 2 to a 4, and probably some are even larger.  My 8 month old is wearing a 3.  At five months she was in a 2.  But again, feet really vary and it doesn't even necessarily have to do with how big the baby is.

AA11187287	omg my mom is always doing that like one time i was making pancakes and she just walks up to me and asked me if i was having sex and started freaking screaming at me for it amd later i found out it was because her friends daughter was pregnant lol it was so weird|`|Nt1Tz3zuaa	yes definitlyy my mom does this a lot too, it might just be her time of the month lol cuz sometimes she just goes off for no reason like your mom did. one time she was telling me to do chores and i went to go do them and she started exploding on me saying i should think to do them before she even told me and she shouldnt have to tell me to do everything and how am i gonna be when im older and on my own blablabla lol i think all moms have their crazy moments. :)|`|5tqh0akYaa	haha most likely im the one yelling. but yeah last this kid i just said hi to him and then he kept telling me to go kill myself and stuff i had to go talk to my counselor , i think he was a little coo coo in the head haha|`|Bcfw1rweaa	yup, my teach.<br>  <br>  apparently i was doing """art"""" projects in class<br>  <br>  ???
J3yUXKiyaa	Tell them you may be pregnant.  They'll tell you if you should or shouldn't have the shots.|`|irHF6CBPaa	You are not obligated to get shots it is a choice you can slimply say you don't want the shots After you find out weather you are pregnant or not get the shot or don't|`|HXh7u0lEaa	Yes some shots you can't have while pregnant, speak to you school about it. If you are not pregnant you probably can get your shots from your Dr after 28th.|`|bQTATDTyaa	You don't have to get them at all, you can choose. If they push it, it's safer to tell them you may be pregnant.|`|3Boqr4Jjaa	THIS IS AN ANSWER THAT ONLY YOUR DOCTOR CAN ANSWER <br>  <br>  <br>  RN|`|Pfge6j7Aaa	Tell them you don't want the shots for religious reasons cause then they can't make you get them.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Ask a doctor or the school nurse if it's ok to take those shots during pregnancy. Simple answer.
WxQFe0GYaa	We use cloth diapers, so I made my purchase of 24, and didn't have to buy more diapers until he moved up to mediums.  Worked out well.|`|AA11434640	I'm not a mommy (yet) but I don't think I'd stock up on diapers right away, especially if it were for my first child. How are you supposed to know what brand you and your baby are going to prefer? I think I'd experiment for awhile to see which ones work best. Just my opinion :)|`|uJJPFJoyaa	Just to get me started off I only stocked a couple packs of diapers, I only started off with several newborn packs and couple more in number 1's.|`|92529423230d8afd2de97a390c4c8c8faa	I stocked up on diapers with my last son but is was not by choice. <br>  I had my youngest son last year gift cards and diapers were pretty much all I recieved so I had no choice.|`|y3vozJ8Aaa	i wish i had more diapers... dealing with a newborn while doing errands is hard, very hard...  my husband and i figured out that our baby goes through at least 600 diapers in one month|`|NXeLcbO0aa	i didn't stock up, but my son was in newborn nappies for 4mths.|`|6783eff5fcc328b9527aa61f6d84bcf2aa	i didn't stock up either because i was told kiddos grow so fast.  my daughter grew slowly and we were in newborn diapers till she was at least 6 months old.  but she went through a growth spurt and we were hardly in size 1's at all.  i wouldn't have forseen that.  i'd get a couple packages of newborns because you'll be sleep deprived and not want to go shopping.  maybe size 1's if you think you'll have a big baby.  Costco will let you return them if they are within a certain time frame, i think it was 90 days.  forgive the lack of capitals, sprained wrist/arm here.|`|OHq5gSjJaa	One thing that is starting to become pretty common at showers is to have a diaper raffle game.  So you would include a little note in your shower invitatin that says something along the lines of, "If you would like to bring a pack of diapers, any brand, any size, for baby _____, your name will be entered in a raffle to win a $50 gift card."  (Or whatever you want the prize to be.)  I swear it was the best thing ever!!!  I did not have to buy diapers (other than a couple preemie packs when she was first born) until my daughter was almost 6 months old.  It saved me soooooooo much money.  And I found that the people at the shower were really excited to bring a small pack of diapers in addition to their regular gift for the chance of winning the drawing.  The chances of your baby being allergic are very very slim.  But if that were to happen you could always donate them.  :)|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well i got a couple diff kinds at my shower so i found out what kind i really liked...but, really, i wouldn't register for them; you will probably get some anyway, that way you can pick out a couple packs of diff brands to see which you like the best...in my experience with a couple of generic brands, they didn't measure up....they didn't seem to have the same kind of absorption and left wet right against her skin...and your baby may have a sensitivity to a certain diaper...so i wouldn't really stock up; maybe put a piggy bank in baby's room and put the money you would be spending in the bank, and after you know your preference you can really stock up ;)|`|rAkWoweOaa	I had a diaper shower and my son is 5 months old and only now am I spending my own money on diapers. I did have to go to walmart and exchange brands/sizes.|`|prqrQcd1aa	It's rare that a child is allergic to disposable diapers honestly. I'm the oldest of 5 kids, and have 3 myself. I know of NO kids that are allergic, and i've been around probably 100 or more of them. Not saying it can't happen, just saying it's not that common.<br>  When I had all my kids, I would buy a pack of diapers every other pay check, one less thing I had to worry about when they all came!|`|kDftsHXjaa	i am stocking up on diapers but not on only bewborn ones i would get a bunch of different sizes bc baby grows fast . i also registered for big boxes of diapers from babiesrus and target....diapers i hear become very very costly.|`|oDGpmkMaaa	I didn't stock up. smiply do to the fact that my kids grew so fast. I would just buy them pack at a time. But most of the time when we were home I used cloth diapers.|`|u94HOVz7aa	register for the fun stuff and leave the diapers up to you.  there's so much stuff out there that you wouldn't buy your self but is fun to get as a gift.<br>  <br>  and something to keep in mind:<br>  ALL my kids are allergic to GENERIC diapers.  and my sisters children are allergic to EVERY brand of diapers except huggies.  so i bought one bag of newborns and one bag of size ones of the pamper swaddlers (my personal favorite for newbies) then my son it turned out was allergic to these so i had to give them away and buy new ones.  if you can register for all brands free samples or just buy a small bag of the ones you plan to use to make sure your little one doesnt have a reaction and you are out a ton of money because you stocked up.  i wouldn't go generic for newborns though if you do buy some.
DCJAMtkHaa	...<br>  <br>  I'm a little confused.  If she's going away from the duration of the pregnancy it doesn't sound promising as to her keeping and raising the baby afterwards.  But I thought most birth parents gave the name choice to the adoptive parents.<br>  <br>  Coli-Ale looks ... strange.  And sorta ugly.  It's pronunciation isn't all that obvious either.  It's unusual, but I don't think it's "Wow that's pretty" unique.

J3yUXKiyaa	Breast is absolutely best, but you have to figure out what works best for you, your baby and your family.  Whatever works best for you and your baby's needs is the right decision.  Don't let anyone bully you either way (some will try).|`|WxQFe0GYaa	I think you should consider more strongly pumping, at least so he gets SOME breast milk for as long as you can.  <br>  <br>  But, you have to do what works for you.  Any breast milk will benefit him.  The more the better.  Try to think about what's best for him, not necessarily what's most convenient for you.|`|EyOzAeyraa	I was a lazy baby and somehow saw that bottles were easier then getting it out of mom's breast... so it is easier on the baby's jaw for the future because if he sucks on the nipple, or his thumb too much it will cause his jaw to grow abnormally.|`|6cN8aLnaaa	If you pump your breast during the time off as much as you can you can freeze the milk and then you will be able to give him the breastmilk for a little longer. I beleive it will keep in the back of a freezer for about three months.|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	sounds good, any amount of breastfeeding has its benefits|`|9tNr1RMfaa	Can you pump while you are at work? Some employers will give you space to do that, I would definitely check on that if I were you. I would also consider pumping a bit before and after work, as someone else has suggested. <br>  <br>  My mother had a career, and she sort of did a combination of all three: pumping, breastfeeding, and supplementing with formula. My twin sisters never had problems taking bottles from people, and they were fine with receiving a combination of formula and breastmilk. <br>  <br>  If I were you I would not completely stop breastfeeding at 1.5 months, I would consider pumping and maybe supplementing with formula (as a last resort). I have met many moms who do this. Some breastmilk is better than no breastmilk, and the longer you breastfeed (even if you are supplementing) the more your baby will benefit.<br>  <br>  *note: I normally do not advocate formula, but I would rather see someone supplement than completely wean a baby at two months. I just think that is too early to wean. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Lz2N7D0yaa	When my son was born, he wouldn't latch on properly. Not even the lactation nurse could get him on. I had to resort to pumping and bottle feeding. I was able to do this for about 3 months, then I started to dry up and went to all formula. I also worked with a girl who had her son the same time I did and she would pump at work on her breaks/lunch and put the milk in the fridge to take home. Breast Milk is best for baby!|`|smcWIZxPaa	i breast fed for a month and a half.  my milk supply was very limited to begin with because my son had problems latching on and i didn't produce very much because of it.  I would say that is a good plan, i'm not one of those people that says that breastfeeding is the only right way to feed a baby.  I'd say formula is fine for a baby and any breastfeeding will benefit him.  Good luck.  Plus the baby's father will love feeding him and it gives you a break too.  It gives him a chance to bond with others also. :)|`|B6ypWiTCaa	If I were you, I'd give him exclusively breast milk for as long as you can.  (There's no dispute that breast milk is better than formula, so if you're physically able to provide the breast milk that's my vote and would probably be what your pediatrician recommends.)<br>  <br>  Breast milk in bottles would be a great way to get him ready for formula and would also give others an opportunity to feed him so he gets used to that too.|`|iPMpWtG6aa	Great idea, breast feeding is not only good for your baby, but it builds a special bond between you and your child.  If possible, you should still continue to breast feed and bottle feed if your baby will do that.  That is what I did with my second child due to work, I couldn't pump alot of milk, so he had formula while I was at work and breast milk when I was at home with him.  Good luck and I wish you and your precious new bundle of joy a wonderful future.|`|2WbR3IvFaa	Not a woman but saw my the whole process with my wife. Breastfeeding for just a week is better than not at all. Do it as long as you can. It also helps you bond with your baby physically. If you plan on formula feeding when you go to work, you might want to try to start about a week before you go to work so he or she gets use to the bottle so she isnt thrown off right off the bat. GL|`|NXeLcbO0aa	sounds fine. but you can express and fill up bottles and leave them in the fridge.|`|N3jwE76maa	It can be confusing for baby to work between the breast and the bottle. The nipples on the bottle are different from yours. I was unable to breastfeed as my son was unable to latch on properly. I felt guilty like I thought I really should be breastfeeding.<br>  The midwife who came to see me the next day at home told me, the baby is losing alot by bottle feeding. So for the past 8 months I have been bottle feeding my little guy, and i don't regret a thing. I am able to get my husband to feed him (especially when i have to work and he doesn't), aswell as the rest of my family. <br>  Its more dearer to formula feed but in the end, it makes life a heck of alot easier.<br>  Good luck|`|n6XYYyoLaa	any breastmilk is better than none; and he will get the colostrum right off...if you won't be able to keep up with the pumping and all, i wouldn't feel guilty for using formula...millions have and are thriving on it; my dd is ffed and she is almost 9 mos old and has not even had a cold....a lot of it comes with common sense....nobody near your house that might be sick, was recently sick, etc....keeping their hands reasonably clean when they start putting them in their mouths, etc...goes a long way....dont let anyone put you down if that is your choice....|`|pJiTbIpYaa	It is a great idea. You are giving him the best start with your colostrum and slowly introducing formula. It will work really well. When i had my operation when my daughter was 3 months i couldn't continue breastfeeding. Lucky for us though we were supplementing with formula for about a month before the op because the stress was making my milk supply suffer. It is definitely a good idea to introduce it slowly. Best of luck to you.|`|kDftsHXjaa	thats kinda what i am doing but i will pump b4 and after work. (after my 12 week leave) breastfeeding is only the best way to feed your baby. i would only do formula if i had to.|`|u94HOVz7aa	that sounds good coodos to you for wanting to breastfeed while you can.|`|gvLjbVFJaa	You should breastfeed as long as you are physically able to. You can take your pump with you at work and pump on your breaks and during your lunch. I have no idea what sort of work you do, but i'm sure most employers would allow you to pump on your break. <br>  <br>  You say you won't have time to pump between work and the baby, but it really doesn't take that long to pump either. You could pump every three hours for like 20 minutes at a time and your supply will probably be fine. I breastfeed beforfe I go to work, and then pump a couple of times at work (that milk is for the following day, if I have to work, if not I bank it for later), and then resume nursing her at the breast. A lot of people will tell you that pumping is hard to keep up on, but really if you are driven to breastfeed, it's not that hard. <br>  <br>  Either way, any amount of breastmilk is good but the longer you can provide it the better.|`|prqrQcd1aa	That sounds like a good plan. Pumping milk isn't as hard as it sounds though. You do what works best for you and your child. That much breastfeeding will allow him to build up a good immune system to begin with. Maybe try pumping while you are home on leave just to see how hard it would actually be on you.<br>  I'm very lucky because I can take my children to work with me, I went back to work 9 days after my last child.. yup, i even had a c section (my 3rd one in fact) and I was able to nurse my child at work. <br>  I wish you the best of luck what ever you choose to do!
Szxce0uUaa	if its only been a week then you might not get a positive result for another couple weeks that is if you are pregnant
OHfZFR31aa	If you know he pees after playing with himself, next time you see him doing it, bring him in the bathroom so he pees in the toilet, or at least in the bathtub so it's not making a mess. All little boys play with themselves -- and they dont' stop when they get older either :-)|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Its ok all babies explore theirselfs, my son is 2 yrs old and I think his penis is his best friend lol, they say not to tell them not to touch it or play with it since infact it is theirs, and that it can cause them when they get older to think its something bad which it isnt. Try to maybe redirect him with something else like a toy or something.|`|2A6xFP81aa	wow that is quite a range<br>  <br>  he probably just needs more nakey time to play with his penis when it's not time to pee.<br>  <br>  he'll out grow it|`|8oKazGVGaa	i guess you'll just have to watch him closer but they normally figure out its wrong when they get a bit older it just takes a bit of time good luck
u94HOVz7aa	cant remember when my daughters did (they are 4 &6)  but my son is only 8wks and when he is upset and i pick him up he snuggles into me and nuzzles his cheek against my chest or shoulder just like when older children hug only he hasnt got arm control yet.  to me its the same as a hug, but no real actual hugs yet.  i am thinking my daughters were around 9 or months or so when they started to hug though.|`|6cN8aLnaaa	My little girl is only three months and it may just be that I WANT her to hug me lol but when I hold her facing me she will kinda hold on around my neck.|`|km6rtHPpaa	This is a very interesting question.. Now it made me wonder. I have two teens. And as hard I tried to rememember I wasn't able to... Now i am curious how people will anser this question.|`|S8x3eHQhaa	To the mom before me don't feel bad I can't remember and my don is only 2 LOL I think he was feeling bad or got hurt I remember crying and hugging
DW9Rw1fPaa	I have an 11 year old and 13 year old boys and they just don't care. I talk to them every day let them know it's offensive to other people to smell them. I hate to say it but I think when the interest in girls come they will start to change.  My sons wake up won't brush their teeth and they yell at each other about how each others breath smell and you know they still don't go brush. It's crazy...|`|1enIWBGnaa	Because they're busy being kids and kids just want to have fun.  Kids could care less about being clean and having clean sheets.<br>  While your son is in school - change his sheets.  Do not allow him to go to bed until he takes a bath!  YOU are the parent - NOT him.|`|EBKTyOAZaa	Eww weeks? My 10 year old gets a bath everyday. She gets herself all muddy playing with the boys at her school. If she went not having baths she'd be all dried mud. 4gods sake kids today.|`|hZf8aJkYaa	Age. Some kids are just like that.|`|SsfnitjXaa	I strip and wash the bed sheets myself and then have them remake them. Why would you expect a kid to do this?  Hygiene is a habit, not grooming at this age.  Children need to be trained at an early age how to wash their bodies, wash their hair and brush their teeth and then checked frequently.  That way by the time they are 11 they know what they are doing.  Parenting is more hands on then people think.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	I think its because kids have better  things to do.  lol<br>  <br>  I mean if you didn't feel "gross" by being dirty, or society didn't make fun of you for it.  Wouldn't you much rather go out and play than take a shower, brush your hair and teeth, clip your nails etc etc.   <br>  <br>  I do agree with the other mom who said its habit.  Just keep enforcing your rules about hygiene.  Maybe make a check off chart.  <br>  <br>  As for his sheets.  He's only 11.  Do it yourself, or you could be like me and physically nag him until he does it.  This includes following them to their room and watching them do it.  (I'm a bit extreme sometimes)   Plus boys seem like they are always more dirty than girls.  go figure?|`|fdxQlQZ5aa	yup well...Boys will be boys. I don't think many boys at that age really care too much about hygeine etc, they are always way too busy doing other things that interest them. My 14 y.o son showers everyday without me mentioning anything, always brushes his teeth twice a day. However, he wasn't ever taught or shown what nail clippers were when he was younger since he came from a neglectful family so I showed and did it for him just once, so he knew how. He was just biting his nails before.(I've only had him since October!  At around 13, 14 I think thats when they  start caring and realize the importance for general hygeine.|`|WTv4e753aa	I've got to be honest. I was and am still the same way. I sometimes go a week without showering. (gross I know)<br>  <br>  Sometimes they get so used to it, that they don't even smell it.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  My website <a href="http://bedwetdaywetsupport.com" rel="nofollow">http://bedwetdaywetsupport.com</a>|`|zx5zzf53aa	My little brother is 11 and is the same way... ugh. When he gets told to take a shower he throws a fit. All little boys are like this until they start liking girls and then they want to dress cute and bathe.|`|AA11540024	Boys will be boys!
H5i8BMh2aa	That sounds like a pregnant belly to me.<br>  A while back I thought I was just gaining weight too-<br>  But turned out it wasn't!<br>  <br>  Is the new "bigger" part of your belly really low down in your abdomen?<br>  And even when you suck it in, is it still kind of there?<br>  You might be pregnant.<br>  <br>  I know exactly what you mean about it hurting when you suck in for too long!|`|uJJPFJoyaa	The first weeks my belly protuded a little but still felt soft and squishy but after the 15-16 week for me it started to feel much more firmer.

I would go and get blood work done to see if u are pregnant.Do u get your period?|`|VuUz8NgKaa	When I was pregnant my belly was firm now it is a bit soft.|`|gzfr2Vvdaa	Yes, I can vouch for that.  I had gained a lot of weight and like a lot of weight.  Although I could suck in my stomach--it didn't really look like it.  I was planning to start a family later this year but surprise! I became pregnant last summer.  I did not think I was, but noticed my stomach more tight than jiggly and I couldn't suck it in.  The best thing to do is go to a doctor and have them check it out.  First Response is the best pregnancy test to take.  Hope that helps, and good luck to you!|`|ArDBlPKYaa	I carry most of my weight in my belly, but mine was stilly squishy and fat-feeling for quite a while....

Perfect because its a name that is not too popular and people will not say, 'oh we have 6 Maura's in our grade', like they would for Alex.<br>  Bridget is my favorite.

HSUfe3m7aa	In order for him to be involved with the child, his wife will find out, he won't be able to keep it from her. <br>  <br>  If you want him to be involved for the next 18 years, get him on the birth certificate, DNA test and a order for child support. He will be entitled to visitation with the child. He won't leave his wife so she will most likely be around for the visits unless she leaves him. It's his job to tell his wife, don't put yourself in firing range. The other alternative if you don't want him to be involved is just to cease contact.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is he's lying to you and lying to her. If you want him involved for the next 18 years, get a court order soon as the baby is born.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|SnanuNKiaa	the best advice anyone can give you is that you need to leave it alone. If you baby's father wanted you around then he would be with you and not his wife, Its the harsh reality but its true. <br>  <br>  Making problems between him and his wife won't make things better for you. best thing to do is move on with your life and find a man that will be there for YOU, not running around having his cake and eating it too.|`|jQwYoRCXaa	does he seem like he wants to be involved in his babys life? if not then hes not worth your time and doesnt deserve to be involved. you can try all you want to make him involved, but if his heart and time isnt there, your baby is the one that is going to suffer. im sure it would be harder to have a dad who is in and out of his or her life then it would be not to know who your dad is at all.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	It's up to you, but it doesn't seem like he wants anything more with you.  Some of these men like to play around and when they get caught they lie to their girlfriend or wife and nowadays most women are so naive that they fall for these lies.  Obviously that was a mistake.  The only thing you should expect from him now is financial support for your baby.  If he is married and has no intention on leaving his wife for you then you are wasting your time talking to him.  Get support from your friends and family.  Best of luck!|`|ca9dEvSAaa	It sounds like he's trying to keep you on the side. Does his wife know that he's talking to you everyday? That's wrong.<br>  <br>  Personally I think being pregnant makes us more vonerable and he's taking advantage of you. <br>  <br>  If I were you I would update him on doctor's appt and baby's health via e-mail. No phone calls, also his wife should be aware of your contact with him.|`|nZTnlgnCaa	give him an altaument tell him if you don't tell her you can't be in my life. and set it straight because if you keep talking to him everyday like you do he will probably think its all right to not tell her and you are like telling him to let his lying asse keep lying.|`|J3yUXKiyaa	Doc appt updates, that's it.  He's still trying to live two lives.<br>  <br>  Don't stop talking to him altogether unless he becomes abusive.<br>  <br>  He may never stop lying about it.  Just don't get back into an affair with him...even if he does wind up divorcing his wife.  He'd just do the same thing to you.|`|6ZUnRxV5aa	In my opinion, I don't see this working out the way it should. He is a married man and thats a barrier no one should mixed themselves into. He is most likely not going to include himself in the child's life, especially if he is lying to his wife that way .|`|lUSj480Oaa	I think you should only talk to him about the baby. But I would let him get into a habbit of him calling you more then you call him. Show him you really dont have time for games anymore. Youll see when you have the baby that your baby is way more imp then him and his wife. Just take it day by day|`|JvbvGtrBaa	uuuuuugggg i thought i had problems. <br>  if your really fed up with it, telling will deffinetly change things faster. it might even make her leave, or bring her closer to it. look if it's not gonna happen with you it's prolly going to happen with another woman soon enough he sounds like he would be the type to get his wife prego and cheat on her too. <br>  why not get it out there at the cost of what would he stop talking to you?  hes already not really there so just go after the scums child support  she'll find out eventually. if he did tell her about at least once you gotta give him credit it's not easy to live with someone once you've been honest about that.<br>  i don't know what to say listen to your heart and gut what does it want? ok if you've got his baby i think i know haha. <br>  i can imagine.  but what do you want?<br>  14 weeks<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: don't listen to chleo if anything he ruined yours.<br>  he doesn't deserve you or his wife|`|RiqNF0l1aa	Yes you should continue talking to him but not about you two just about the baby. You knew he was married and weather he loves his wife or not you shouldn't push it anymore. His wife is already going threw a hard time that he cheated on her and got another girl pregnant and you calling all the time is just going to make it worst. It really shouldn't matter if he is lieing to his wife or not he is the father of your kid. All that should matter is how good of a father he is going to be for your kid. That's it. Nothing else matters. You just need to put your differences aside and be mature about the whole thing and if he can't do that then maybe he shouldn't be apart of this kids life.|`|eya1WDS4aa	It sounds like you just want to get back at him by telling his wife you have been together longer then he is saying, but you have to think of it this way, by telling her its just gonna hurt her even worse. he needs to be the one to tell her not you and whats going on in there marriage is none of your Business. Yes you may be carrying his child but you dont have a right to get into their marriage. what he did is so wrong in so many ways, and as for you i just will keep my mouth shut. For now i would just keep him updated with dr.s appointments that's it. their marriage if they are working it out needs time to heal without you chiming in at every second. Sorry i dont mean this to sound rude, im just being upfront.|`|HO3mCsQwaa	he is not worth it! you need to move on, esp if he isn't willing to leave his wife or support your child financially. He is sleeping with you and his wife, do you  really want to be just that other women? You need to stop talking to his altogether!!! I am sorry but your just another women and if he really wanted you or to be with you, he would leave his wife.|`|Pfge6j7Aaa	I think you should forget about what happened between the two of you cause he is married. Yes you should let him be involved in the childs life and yes he should have to pay child support. but you should leave bad enough alone cause how would you feel if you were in his wife's position. Do you like it when you are cheated on? why would you do that to another woman?|`|NXeLcbO0aa	u have already kinda ruined the kids life by getting pregnant wit a married man, i don't think he wants to be involved with the baby, if  we you get a lawyer and file for maitanace.|`|1EB7fbxpaa	I would tell his wife the truth about you two and get child support from him. what an ahole!|`|1BnuJ5VVaa	Wow, I AM SORRY FOR ALL YOU HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH BUT SWEATY HE IS THE FATHER OF YOUR UN BORN BABY SOMETIME YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO ,TO MAKE YOUR BABY'S LIFE BETTER. YOU SHOULD TALK TO HIM AND TELL HIM THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TREATED THAT WAY AND IF HE CONTINUES TO ACT THAT WAY YOU LET HIM KNOW THAT HE WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE HIS CHILD. EVEN THOUGH IT ISN'T A GOOD THING TO GROW UP WITHOUT A DAD IT IS BETTER FOR YOU AND YOUR CHILD TO NOT BE AROUND BAD INFLUENCE LIKE THAT<br>  <br>  I HOPE EVERY THING TURNS OUT WELL|`|1qxhPyXzaa	If he won't admit to what's going on, he's not going to want anything to do with your baby.  I know, I was with a man for four years and he left me on the delivery table.  He didn't want his (i was told ex) wife to know what was up.  She found out when the paternity papers came!!  And he still has only seen her twice and she's 17 months old.  Love your baby and pray that someday he wises up.  But a hit and miss dad is hard on a little girls emotions.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Well, does he want to be invoved in the child's life? if not, I wouldn't bother.I would only update him when the child is born..send a pic and see what his response is.You cannot change his mind whether he wants to be in your child's life or not so don't stress too much about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|J3JClsuQaa	Well, it's easy to tell you what to do from the outside looking in... and here's my opinion.  1.  chalk this up as a life lesson, married men are a no no  2.   hit him for child support : )   3. if he shows an interest in the baby's life, then by all means support that... it's great if he decides to be involved      3.  even if he does or doesn't decide to be involved, when the time is right, you will eventually meet a man, who is not married, who does not believe in cheating on the one they love, and who will be around to love you and your child... they are out there and sometimes it takes time to find them AND in the meantime enjoy every second you'll have with your precious baby    Hope I helped, it's not the end of the world if he doesn't want to help out...
1z3C0R2Vaa	very normal good luck..........
ZNRZM2gOaa	OMG! Enjoy the time your toddler spends with you. He looks up to you for everything under the sun. It is you that teaches him all that he needs to be taught in many many ways. Through play too!<br>  <br>  Yes, it is most likely that it is because he is an only child.<br>  <br>  This time you have with him will pass in the blink of an eye!|`|7m6JBt3daa	I have an only child and find that when I give him at least 15-20 minutes of my undivided attention, he seems to be able to play better by himself (so I can get things done).  Does your child have enough things to play with?  I know that might sound dumb but I've noticed that many people don't really have a lot of things for their kids to play with.  I don't mean you have to buy expensive toys but just have things to keep them busy.|`|OffM2Ndiaa	Yes, get the kid a puppy|`|3oJL2Go3aa	I would play with him for a little bit. Maybe getting him a puppy would be a good idea. But you have also got to think you are going to have to potty train the puppy. Unless you get an older dog. That is the reason why we havent got one. My daughter is a year old and we have decided that we are going to wait until she is old enough to help out. Like taking the dog outside and making sure the food dish is full. Things like that. But your child is 5 so that is a good age. I would enjoy your time playing with him/her now because there is going to be a time where they are off doing things on their own and not seem to have time for you.
AtVRWrwCaa	There are 2 reasons you could be bleeding- implantation bleeding or a chemical pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I would suspect that what you have now is implantation bleeding. Since you got more positive tests than negative, I'd say you are pregnant. Don't be worried about the bleeding. This is normal for many women and is caused by the egg implanting into your uterus. <br>  <br>  If you really feel the need to test again, test once the bleeding has stopped. I am not a doctor, so I may be wrong.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|SnanuNKiaa	when you stop bleeding. Its possible that your having a chemical pregnancy so when you do stop bleeding try testing again.|`|1xGvmtb6aa	the same thing happen to me i even got my period but something in my body was telling me other wise so u never can go wrong with a blood test so i took it and i was pregnant so i asked my doctor why i even got my period so he said it was cause my body wasn't used it meaning the baby so it was like an abortion that my body was doing so check but with a blood test and with that u could never go wrong|`|3Boqr4Jjaa	You can have whats looks like a period but still be pregnant. You can test anytime.<br>  <br>  RN|`|dSobv28maa	Positives never lie<br>  false results do<br>  <br>  your pregnant|`|Pfge6j7Aaa	YOu could be having an early miscarriage
kUZPjf2vaa	When i was 5 i slept walked into the kitchen, opened the fridged and went to squat on the lettuce - mum yelled NOOOOO and i just got up (without peeing) pulled my pants up and went back to bed...<br>  <br>  My sister and i were on the trampoline and i kneed her she and i laughed so hard we both peed on the trampoline...mum wasn't too happy|`|QKWUSfq3aa	In 2nd grade I asked the teacher to go to the bathroom and she said no. I couldn't hold it and I peed my pants right in front of everybody! Talk about embarrassing!! My grandpa had to come pick me up cause my parents were at work. Now that I think back on it, what kind of teacher denies a 2nd grader a potty break! Meany Mrs. Gaston that's who!|`|zHXPxQgWaa	lol I have two. I was 11 and was sleeping in my bunk bed at my house when my little sister comes in my room. She climbs up the ladder lays next to me and goes to sleep. I wake up to a great warm sensation on my back and im like oooohh what is this. then shout eeeeeeewwwwwww!!!!! and cried and told mom.<br>  <br>  <br>  Im like 12 yo and im a deep koma type sleep. Im in a crazy fun dream and I had to pee in my dream. Iol so i had dreamed I went to a bathroom sat on the toilet and woke up to a warm lap.|`|vTra7n5baa	In elementary school, we had this thing called the Pee Club where members of the club had to watch you pee on the stump of a tree in this old couple's back yard in order to become a member.  We only got up to five members and were a clique at recess.  Nobody ever knew exactly how we became friends though because we had a "secret pact"!|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	i was sleeping in my moms bed when i was very young, and i woke up and had peed... so i woke her up and said "i pee pee'd in my middle"... "my middle" is what i called the middle of my mothers bed, where i slept between her and my dad. hahaha wow.
Qz7YtDXUaa	I did a research project on this in order to graduate and I did it all on Nursing, Midwives are Registered Nurses that take extra schooling to obtain knowledge and skills needed for that job.<br>  <br>  for more information search the internet for Nursing-Midwife<br>  <br>  that or something similar to that will get you more info|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	Being a midwife is something I'm considering as well.  I'm a third semester nursing student and I can tell you off the bat you will need to get your RN before you can become a midwife.  That's a few steps up and you have to continue your schooling.  I plan to work in OB for a while to see if I even like it.  If so, I will go back to school and go for my midwifery liscence.|`|3Boqr4Jjaa	Find a hospital school of nursing or community college that offers a 2 year RN program. Four year BSN programs are not as clinical as a diploma  program.<br>  <br>  Been there done that!<br>  <br>  RN
2tzn6Ad9aa	your the typical nice guy...girls want bad boys at your age lol. But yeah, being sincere is good though. Your not asking the right chicks,and the reason your friend got that girl is probably because that girl took it as a compliment so she felt flattered. You should get to know the girl before you ask her out first, because they might have been nervous. Take them out on dates, compliment them, and always look into their eyes and smile! Mmmm I don't know what else to say but Good Luck|`|G5TNYENAaa	Even if a girl does say no, there is no harm done so why not? If anything, the girl will be just flattered and like you more as a friend then she did before. Don't worry, SOMEONE will go out with you even if you're as ugly as Daniel radcliffe.|`|o2FJIXS9aa	I am probably old enough to be your mom, but I regret not going out with boys that were very sincere and nice to me when I was a teen. I had this whole stupid idea in my head that I couldn't consider a guy that was unpopular. I know that some of them are now successful and have great lives. I think that if you go on being a nice guy and not crude like some of your friends that you will find someone who will give<br>  you the time of day and more. Just be yourself and you will find the right girl. You will be the winner in the end for it.|`|08Ksc5Oiaa	GITERDONE!|`|CBhGz42raa	But being nervous is the most normal reaction. Some girls even find it flattering and cute :)<br>  Dont think about it at all just do it. Dont live your life second guessing yourself. Go for it life's to short. The worst thing is she says no,but chances are if she likes you but is too shy to say yes up front, you asking her will put you in her mind. And after a while she might consider :)<br>  <br>  If it's meant to be it'll work by itself,you wont even have to push it.|`|OIsaEGBSaa	"explode" make sure you clean your mess. You know what they say why use a girl when your hand is right there. Not my fault you are a shy and lonely kid. The key to confidence is not caring. What this means is don't be scared about what a girl might say or think. Good luck|`|iJdp9HDDaa	DO IT ******|`|p9r6sKx2aa	Boy...you better WHIP it!

kaqPSgTVaa	? I don't' get what the question is. Her doctor told her what to do and she's doing it right? Did her fever go down? If it didn't go down go to the ER but if it went down she just has a little virus and she'll be ok. Just make sure she drinks a lot of fluids and rests as much as possible.|`|q7kv0DbTaa	Drink 4 oz of aloe vera juice every hour oe every half an hour and the fever would be gone by the end of the day and aloe vera juice is good for the baby.

BDarMnDeaa	Try putting a humidifier in his room when he sleeps, that should help clear his nasal passages.|`|zDeEaja0aa	You can purchase a saline solution over the counter and use the nasal aspirator to clean out the nose. <br>  <br>  Using a Humidifier in the infants room where he/she sleeps.<br>  <br>  A warm bath can help soothe your baby as well as open the drainage of his/her nasal way. <br>  <br>  Home remedies and options that are over the counter for such a young infant are very limited. Depending how long the cold and cough has lasted, you may just want to call your doctor and schedule an appointment.|`|Yx5GlOJDaa	I don't know if baby is old enough for it you would have to talk to his or her doctor but there is a vicks baby rub, put a humidfire in his or her room, sometimes when you are trying to put baby to sleep if he or she can't sleep cause babies nose is really stuffy take baby into the bathroom and run the shower on ht water only and let the bathroom get full of steam and that will help their sinuses clear up enough so they relax and fall asleep sometimes that works!!!! also give baby some INFANT tylenol but concidering his or her age give baby only 0.6ml every 4-6 hours as needed and that will help with any fever, or discomfort and make baby an appointment to make sure baby isn't getting a ear infection or sinus infection. I have known some babies that got a sinus infection or a ear infection when they got a cold. Sorry if it sounds like i am telling you what to do cause i'm not but good luck and i hope baby feels better really soon!!!|`|N3jwE76maa	Use a humidifier in his room. Also before feeding him, get a damp, warm face washer and put it to the side of his nostrils. It should help clear up his nose temporarily so you can feed him.<br>  Unfortunately, you can't give him baby panadol yet. As much as it hurts, you need to let it go away by itself. You can go to your local pahrmacy and see if they can suggest something. Ours suggested a saline nasal spray to clear his nose.Also there is nothing for babies for a cough. My little guy had a cold at 6 months old and when he finally got to the point where only his cough was left, we couldn't do anything but let it go away.<br>  Good luck to you|`|5BNGu0Mkaa	use a vaporizer and our pharmacist recommended finding a vapor bath soap and use a little bit along with some saline drops.  we were told there isn't much to do for a 2 month old but if you notice that he is getting worse call your pediatrician and they will decide if they need to prescribe an antibiotic.  Hope he fells better soon.|`|UVwRSpDjaa	Foe the stuffy nose put a little sailine soulution in the nose and then suck it out w/ the bulb. For baby's you can't really do anything for them but make them comfortable. My son was born in winter and he had a lot of colds at a young age. My doctor suggested we buy a nebulizer ($50) and it works great for the cough and helping him breath.|`|afVuBANHaa	breastfeeding is hard when your baby has a stuffy nose. humidifier is a good idea also before you feed the child use the saline drops to clear the nose and suck out the snot with the bulb suringe they give you at the hospital. this will help alot while feeding. i do this at least 2 times or until the snot is cleared and they are breathing better. also do this before your baby goes to bed. and yes you may need to do this everytime the baby wakes and feeds. some kind of chest rub is ok to use also...like vicks. I know there are also off brand kinds that do the trick also...but really that is all you can do since they are so little. you want there little bodies to learn how to fight these things. good luck!!
6783eff5fcc328b9527aa61f6d84bcf2aa	forgive lack of capitals, sprained wrist.  i went with my kindergartners.  we get to go behind the scenes, see how they make things in the bakery, how they package meat, recycle boxes, etc.  the kids loved it.
GhrJVbFEaa	You are not a bad mother, just human. Many people (mothers and fathers) have a secret or open preference to the baby's gender. I will hazard a guess that for many men it is to have a boy and for many women, a girl. NOT ALWAYS THE CASE, of course. I secretly wanted a girl also - but I had a boy - twice. I can tell you that the second you hold that baby it all goes away...no preference is stronger than the love and bond of holding your new creation...girl or boy.  We are due with our third and this time we won't even be finding out the sex because even though a girl would be great - we want the surprise and know that we will be happy no matter what with a healthy baby. Sounds cliche but it is true, or it was for me at least.|`|QUFAKk1paa	yes|`|eMccVmBkaa	no....as long as you dont hate the girl then its fine!|`|iQ13PoEiaa	no, you'll learn to love your baby boy, no matter what.|`|Szxce0uUaa	no it does not. when i was pregnant with my youngest son i wanted him to be a girl sooo bad since i already had a boy but he wasnt and yes i was a little disappointed but as soon as he was born and i got to hold him for the first time i  fell inlove with him instantly and wouldnt want to change anything about him. now i have my 2 wonderful beautiful boys. if its not a girl im sure you'll be a bit disappointed but as soon as hes born and you hold him and he looks at you your heart will melt and you will love him more than anything. Goodluck!!!|`|Pfge6j7Aaa	With my first child I had my heart set on a girl too. I had the name picked out and everything. I was disappointed when they told me it was a boy. But you get used to it. My son is almost 2 and I wouldn't give him up for the world. I am glad that I had a boy first. He is so sweet and compassionate. but sorry I lost track of what I was saying. You will love you child no matter what I am sure and no it does not make you a bad mom for being disappointed that you didn't get what you wanted. GOOD LUCK!!!|`|RiqNF0l1aa	No it doesn't make you a bad mother. Every expecting mother has in their mind what they want it to be  but just because it comes out the opposite sex doesn't mean you won't love it just as much. Hey boys can be real fun. And besides if you don't have a girl this time there is always next time.........|`|lEGq1nzoaa	No, it does not make you a bad mother. Once you see the little guy you will be in love. Boys are so much fun. You miss out on tea parties and barbie but you make up for it with hot wheels and G.I. Joe. And dont listen to what people say, there are tons of really cute baby boy clothes. Everything that I got for my nephew had puppy feet attached! And boys tend to be easier during those hard teen years.|`|aYZXi6ffaa	Nope.  Relax and give the idea time to settle in.  I was in your same shoes and I have a little boy.  I can tell you he is my pride and joy.  I looked at all the fun things I wanted to do with my little girl and overlooked the awesome things I could have done with a son.  Your not a bad mom for this.  Children are precious gifts!  You'll love the idea sooner than later.|`|HXh7u0lEaa	Not at all it's fine to be a little disappointed at first. This is my 4th I was hoping for a little girl and I am having a boy, I felt a little disappointed for around 5 minutes then got over it I can't wait for my boy to be born.|`|mwSrzGwVaa	No it doesn't of course you may feel disspointed if you wanted a girl.<br>  But you will love him just as much<br>  And can always have a girl second time,<br>  I think every mother wants one sex and get the other then feel disspointed|`|vsFp9faiaa	no... just remember that everything happens for a reason<br>  <br>  so maybe next time you have a baby  its a girl and she will be lucky to have a older brother to stick up for her|`|1BnuJ5VVaa	OF COURSE NOT, THAT IS NORMAL YOU HAD YOUR HEART SET OUT ON A GIRL AND IT DIDN'T TURN OUT THAT WAY IT IS FINE I MEAN THERE IS ALWAYS A NEXT TIME<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S DON'T TELL UR CHILD THAT YOU WANTED A GIRL TRUST ME LOL|`|2WbR3IvFaa	No, once you see your baby face to face nothing will matter, you will love unconditionally.|`|RMYvrn1Qaa	No! 50% of people are disappointed with their baby's sex, I guarantee.|`|YG288fG4aa	Yeah|`|gpxcUtL1aa	Don't stress about it. EVERYONE has their heart set on one sex or another, whether they admit it or not.<br>  <br>  When you find out the sex in a few weeks, even if it's a boy, you'll be glad to see it's healthy.<br>  <br>  And when he (or she) is born, you'll be counting fingers and toes, not genitals.|`|2Mug8KaBaa	I cried when I found out I was having a girl... I wanted another boy... but once I had her, I wouldn't trade her for the world and SO realize that God knows so much better than us what we need in our lives!! My daughter is 7 and I'd never trade what she is for anything and she has brought so much joy to my life, more than I could've imagined! Anyway, you're not a bad Mom and you'll love your baby regardless!!!!|`|HOpzuukwaa	it does not make you a bad mother you may just be dissapointed about the sex at first but you will love your baby just as much as if it was girl!|`|uNQJXnEvaa	It's ok to be dissipointed at first as long as you don't always wish you had a girl if you end up having a boy|`|Z8AhDCWEaa	Even if it's not the gender that you were hoping for, you will still come to love your baby by the time it's born.  You will have hopes, but it is still your baby!  It will be sweet and cuddly, and it will love you no matter what sex it turns out to be.<br>  Just try to keep your mind open for now,in case it IS a boy.  What kind of things would you have fun doing with a boy?  Remember that you can still go to the park together, you still get to play dress-up for as long as your child will let you(even the girls get independant!), and you still get to have fun playing games and running around being a great mommy!|`|YF8Qe714aa	No! I wanted a boy sooo bad! I got a girl. It made me disappointed at the moment but it will go away. You will love the baby so much no matter what it is. I love my daughter more than anything and wouldn't trade her for the world. And that doesn't mean that if you end up having a boy you can't try for a girl next time!|`|axwdwiSuaa	No of course not! Everyone is entitled to what they would prefer. You're not disappointed because of their personality, you don't even know  the baby yet. <br>   It definatly does not make you a bad person, don't worry about it!=D|`|HSUfe3m7aa	Totally normal. I swore my second was a girl, but it was another boy. But I must say I am 110% happy it was a boy, they are so much fun. You will be happy once you see the ultrasound regardless, trust me :)|`|5fdgfNCRaa	No it doesn't make you a bad mother. If you didn't love your baby based on gender, that'd be bad. Disappointment is just a human emotion and it's okay. You'll be a great mother :)|`|xreWOKBYaa	You should love your baby no matter what gender.|`|2DRWQxP3aa	no. Your not a bad mother. compaired to this one mother your heaven. These two mothers gave birth on the same day. One had a boy and one had a girl. The one with the boy (i think) wanted a girl but none the less they went home with 'their' child. turns out the babys were mixed up and it wasn't a while until the girls mother got her back. The mother went public and said that she wanted a girl. Nice eh? imagine when the child is older and finds out his mother didn't want him. But don;t worry. many people want a girl but have a boy or other way around. It doesn't make you a bad mother. And congrats!|`|kUZPjf2vaa	Being disappointed and being a bad mother is TWO different things! Everyone feels a little disappointed some time or another - i was but in the end its your baby and no matter what the gender is you will love it! I was convinced i was having a girl which i wasn't too happy about (but still knew i would love it) and found out im having a boy!!! So ya never know :)|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	its very common to feel dissapointed over the sex, but naturally you will get more excited as you get further along. i have my heart set on a girl, and i feel i will be dissapointed if its a boy, but i also know i will be thrilled either way. good luck & god bless!! congrats on your pregnancy!|`|YVeZ8K6haa	Does this change how much you are going to love the baby when it gets here? Will you mistreat it because its not the sex you wanted? If you answered no to both of these questions then no you're not a bad mother.|`|nZTnlgnCaa	no. i mean if you totally would hat the baby because of its sex then yes but if you are disappointed then no. it's a totally different thing if you still love the child.......nope not at all a bad mother.|`|L2pkns9maa	No... no law against being disappointed. Just love this baby with all your living body, mind and soul... then you wont be a bad mother|`|ftvPJfEXaa	Well no but you should be glad your having one not everyone can have one.|`|OffM2Ndiaa	it all depends on how well you treat the kid when it comes out.
lUSj480Oaa	Yea its prob acid reflux. Drink milk. If you got it on hand add a little choc nesquik. Mmm I craved it every night before bed when I was pregnant lol.|`|L8TdPM0yaa	You need to throw up. The acid reflux is normal to all pregnent women though. I hope everything goes well with you and your baby!|`|2WbR3IvFaa	yes its natural|`|L2pkns9maa	Yes, most likely. Drink milk... and eat less.|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	it does sound like acid reflux...
olopisx7aa	Yes, that's normal for a stomach virus. You have no need to worry unless you start bleeding.|`|L2dDwEyXaa	yes you will learn soon that you can get all kinds of pains and symptoms that you don't think are normal but are, with that said i would say for you to call your OB i called mine all the time with any question i had i am sure they hated me over there but i had questions and worries that they sure did put to rest,and speaking of that you should get lots of rest till you feel better. good luck and congratulations!!!|`|AA11315360	Get seen by a doctor immediately. If you have been throwing up you may need to be hooked up to an IV to get proper electrolytes back in your system, especially since you are pregnant.<br>  So call your doctor or go to a hospital and get seen today.|`|jS6Qkj0faa	yes its totally normal- its your intestine spasming because it has been irritated by the virus. If anything was amiss with bubby you would feel the pain lower down in your pelvic area or hips.|`|YkzPfyp2aa	I would say yes because I went through it and the pain is probably the result of you straining when vomiting.  However if I were I would call the doctor to make absolutely sure.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	Yes and it is also normal for this stage of pregnancy. Your round ligaments are starting to stretch and it's uncomfortable.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	Yes it seems normal but a phone call to your OBGYN would set your fears to rest.
ZxV8FeiYaa	he couldn't, the penis goes inside the canal and doesn't reach the womb...<br>  <a href="http://bodyandhealth.canada.com/images/hpv/uterus_diagram.gif" rel="nofollow">http://bodyandhealth.canada.com/images/h...</a><br>  <br>  just remember to wear a condom, sperm can break down the 'wall' and cause you to go into labor<br>  <br>  good luck with motherhood!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	He can't poke the sac. Your cervix is what he's poking. It's physically impossible for him to hit the sac. Look up a diagram of pregnant women.|`|JP2h62qiaa	every one else has said it. He is hitting your cervix if anything and it is totally safe to do it rough.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	It's your cervix he's hitting because it's swollen and engorged. The cervix is closed tightly and will protect the baby and the sac.<br>  <br>  Later on you will need to tone it down a bit :)|`|BDarMnDeaa	It's just your mind. You're paranoid. There's no way that the sac can be "poked".|`|F3ArhTiRaa	no he's not.  nothing to worry about|`|ZzxxcFfsaa	yeah. my bf and i did the same when i was preggo, but he says things are fine as long as i did not feel any pain.
ZxV8FeiYaa	what kind of pants do you wear?,<br>  when I have a shower the heat effects my jeans and they turn my nickers blue and rub off a bit of color on my butt, I've been covering them with a towel and that seems to help|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Not normal, no.|`|YVeZ8K6haa	You really need more detail in this question? Are you pregnant? If so how far along? Do you sit a lot? I mean there is a lot of information needed to help answer this question to the best of our ability.<br>  <br>  But I agree with the first answer, if you're a smurf then yes its normal.|`|YG288fG4aa	Yeah everyone has a blue butt!|`|uNQJXnEvaa	no
ZxV8FeiYaa	the best thing is to get it over with, like when you first get your period<br>  a good idea is to come up with some words like "mum, I'm pregnant" and practice that, that way she can just spit it out without thinking about it too much and work from there<br>  and remember a mother loves her daughter no matter what!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|8RfmosODaa	It's better for her to tell her now and get it over with. Ask her if she needs SUPPORT and you can go with her when she tells her mama. Her mom would be more mad if she waited to tell her.|`|J3JClsuQaa	Yep, she's gotta "woman-up" and tell her... she's going to find out eventually...|`|C9QQPROkaa	She eventually will start to show so its best to get it out of the way now then later she will only be stressing herself out trying to keep it a secret and thats not good for her or the baby assuming she wants to keep it.|`|jQwYoRCXaa	tell her...its better for her mom to hear from her instead of someone else...not to mention her mom is eventually going to find out.|`|ftvPJfEXaa	9 months+Baby=Dead Pregnant Girl!|`|aYZXi6ffaa	She can't hide it forever!|`|FV2qx8V5aa	wow.. tough situation.. how old is she?? well heres the deal, in a couple months her tummy is going to start to show, and then her mom is going to know whats up and is going to be more mad that she didnt tell her!!! so shes going to find out anyway... tell ur friend that she needs to just get it over with... Moms always figure out a way to deal with it.. u just need to be a good friend to her|`|BDarMnDeaa	Well.. the mom is eventually going to find out due to the fact that her belly is going to start growing. She should just tell her that she's pregnant, her mom will be even more hurt knowing that her daughter lied to her for so long.|`|4VIjILk1aa	She needs to tell her mom because soon the mom will find out when she starts to show. Ask your friend if she needs for you to be by her side when she does tell her mom so you can support her.|`|mwSrzGwVaa	How can she keep it a secret? She will get fat, she has to tell her mum her mum will flip but end up being there for her, if her mum kicks her out or whatever there are places that will help her.|`|ZSchvX1Yaa	Is she really pregnant? Or does she think she is?<br>  Wel if she thinks she is, then take a test.<br>  If shes deffo pregnant. She will have to tell her mom.<br>  Sorry x|`|QIXSndBSaa	I think that she should defently tell her mom because as much as she might be mad ,she would still care about here daoughter.or another option is that she could have a abortion .|`|vHkIHbMkaa	tell!!!!!!! do you not watch secret life of the american teenager?!?!?!  its a good show.|`|YG288fG4aa	What a dumb question?|`|Vw1GzleKaa	TELL D MOM 4SURE CAUZE SHE WILL GET SO MAD BUT ANYWAYS THEY GET OVER IT SOON OR LATER SHE WONT STAY MAD AT U 4EVER THEY WONT STOP LOVING U CAUSE AT D END UR STILL HER DAUGTHER ITS BETTER TO TELL HER IN CASE U HAV QUESTIONS H IN NEED OF HELP OR AN EMERGENCY SHE LL BE THERE 4U|`|EQvFckORaa	<a href="http://innnanswers.freeallinsurance.com" rel="nofollow">http://innnanswers.freeallinsurance.com</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check
ZxV8FeiYaa	it isn't a crime, her family will probably be a bit mad at you but since your both underage you can't go to jail,<br>  and I don't think you'd be able to support a child on that money but surely both your family's would be helping out, I can't answer whether they want an abortion or anything like that, I think the best thing to do is meet with them a while after she tells them (give them a chance to cool of and think fro how this will effect them), you should probably meet them with your parents to!<br>  I reckon your girlfriend would want to keep her child and talk to her parents about it to, talk to her about it, the more you understand about how each other feels the better<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	no because none of you is older than the legal age.<br>  <br>  No they cant take your child. unless you are unable to look after them.<br>  thats good. But i do advise you to start saving from now. if you put $70 away a month. you will have $500 and something. that will help for a certain time. But you need to ask for supportfrom the government to help raise baby.<br>  <br>  her parents can push her to do what they want. But in the end - it is definitly both of your choices especially hers.<br>  So stay strong & fight for what you want.<br>  You are a really good person. Baby will be your blessing<br>  <br>  god bless x Take care of yourself & partner & baby inside|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You two are both under 18 so neither of you would be charged with a crime. You haven't commited one.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	no you will not be charged with a sex crime and you will need about $2,500/month to live on your own about $2,000 just to start buying baby stuff and thats before he/she is born. If you live at home a baby cost about $700/month or more. and no her parents cant make her get an abortion<br>  <br>  bottom line you need to make  A LOT more money|`|HSUfe3m7aa	I hope this is a serious question.<br>  <br>  No you won't be charged as you are close in age. You are minors however, I don't know how that will factor in.<br>  <br>  $30 is not enough for a baby. $30 just for diapers. Then add food, formula, medications, clothing, car seats etc.<br>  <br>  She can have an abortion without your permission. She could give it up for adoption without your permission if she doesn't acknowledge you as the father. You would need a DNA test.<br>  <br>  You will need outside help, you will not be able to support the baby on your own. This is an 18 year commitment that will affect your future life, wife and any future children. It will affect your income for a minimum of 18 years, you will pay child support and other expenses associated with raising the child.|`|YF8Qe714aa	I'm glad that you want to take responsiblity. However, $30.00 a week is no where near the amount you need to spend to take care of a baby. $30.00 is about 1 can of formula (mind you they go through these like crazy) diapers are about 12.00 a pack and you'll buy several of these a week, cloths, wipes, crib and all of those sorts of things. <br>  <br>  And no you can not be charged with any crime, by DSS can take the baby and probably will since you can't support it at 14. They might give it to one of your parents until you can support it yourself, but chances are you won't be keeping it. Not to say you can't fight for custody when you turn 18. Good Luck.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	For only 14 you seem very responsible, and I'm glad you're accepting responsibility. Unfortunately $110/month is not sufficient to support a baby, but it's a start. DSS will automatically be involved because of your age, but they will not take the baby away unless you or the mother give them reason. Her parents cannot force her to have an abortion if she's not willing to do it, nor can they make her give the baby up.. No you cannot be charged with any sex crime. You're only a year apart, no crime there. Make sure your gf wants to keep the baby as well, then decide on what you can do if her parents kick her out. There are lots of programs to help teen parents. Maybe your parents are more supportive and would let her and the baby live there? Be a bit more careful next time though. Good luck, I really mean it!|`|4VIjILk1aa	No you can't get charged with a sex crime and if you want this baby you need to get a job that you will make more than 110 a month. Babies are very expensive. They go through Alot of diapers. If you and your parents decide if you want the baby then she can't get an abortion or give it up. The baby is part of yours. Child protection services can't take your baby unless you are abusive or not giving the baby a nice home.|`|YO1w7gpiaa	You need someone to talk to.<br>  Start with your school counselor - and ask to find out about teen pregnancy and parenting.   <br>  You would do well to talk with an Alternative Pregnancy Center<br>  or a Crisis Pregnancy center (that does not do abortions).<br>  <br>  You will need to find out the physical, legal, and financial obligations you will be facing.<br>  <br>  There is a place you can call tonight    1-800-NEWLIFE<br>  They can speak with you briefly to help you have some idea of the issues you face.   Then you can be referred to a Licensed<br>  Christian Counselor in your area.   <br>  <br>  In the coming months you are going to need supportive people to talk with.<br>  <br>  Every baby is a Gift from God, and precious.|`|HXh7u0lEaa	I am pretty sure that you can't get charged because you're both minors and they can't make her adopt or give up her baby that is your girlfriend Choice. Why don't you go with her to a family guidance counsellor for some advice then you both can make an informed decision. In the end the decision is your girlfriends, the best you can do is support her through whatever she decides.|`|Idt6DUmmaa	no there is no crime, but you definately need to figure out something about money cause that $30 a week is nothing if your taking care of a baby... also she has a say in what she wants to do with the baby (abortion, giving birth) but i hope she doesnt consider abortion... good luck|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	30$ a week is enough for a days worth of baby supplies... idk what to tell you hun, you guys are way too young. you dont know what your getting yourself into.|`|TlFnIei0aa	Because your young also you can't be charged.<br>  No you don't earn enough to support them.|`|OJ0POy4Xaa	I don't think DSS would take the baby but you two need your parents to help you with the upcoming decisions. I wouldn't imagine there would be any criminal charges with regard to your ages. <br>  $110 a month might cut it for the first few months but as the baby gets older and eats more food, needs more toys, needs more clothes etc that's not going to be enough. It won't be enough when you two need your own cars and insurance, and a place to live, and groceries for yourself, and utilities....<br>  I'm not going to advise you on the abortion other than I hope that's not how this ends. If her parents try to force an adoption your parents can sue for grandparents' rights, or even custody on your behalf. <br>  But like I said, just leave the big decisions to the adults at this point, you and your girlfriend have already done enough. You're not ready to act like adults yet so trust whatever decision your and her parents make as they will have your, her, and the baby's best interest at heart.|`|vTra7n5baa	You won't go to jail for any sex crime based on that account.  But if you could go to jail for being completely stupid, then you would get life!<br>  <br>  $110/mo is BEYOND INSUFFICIENT for taking care of a child.  You need at least 10 times that!  A pack of diapers alone is 10% of that.  What about your education?  If your punctuation and writing capability are any indications of your level, then you will remain so far behind others.  How can you get a good job?<br>  <br>  Moreover, you are TOO young to have sex (let alone a child).  Here's why.  Sex is a huge responsibility that many adults don't even handle well.  To be responsible, and therefore better off, you have to do the following:<br>  <br>  1) Spend money on protection, toys, lube, etc.  This is NOT cheap.<br>  2) Get tested for AIDS and other STDs if you are having sex regularly.  Nerve-racking and also NOT cheap.  <br>  3) Watch out for pregnancy.<br>  4) Understand that sex is NOT always fun.  Sometimes it sucks.<br>  5) People can hurt you emotionally with sex in many ways.<br>  <br>  About the abortion: legally, it's your girlfriend's decision.  You can't make her stop one.  If she decides the carry the child to term, I suggest giving it away to an infertile couple.  It will be better off and receive a proper education and lifestyle, something you don't sound like you can give at such a young age.|`|Rry09MpTaa	1st of all having a baby is a lot more that 110$ a month also you can not be charged for that you are both underage. no her parents cant make her have an abortion its up to her and you. don't give up the baby if you feel you can take care of it BUT where are you planning to live and how are you going to take care of it? and will her parents approve. you have a lot to think about|`|hPVKMD4Iaa	My heart is out to you, seriously.<br>  <br>  Her parents could actually convince her to get an abortion, if they're the selfish kind and if they don't realize that there's over 3,000,000 abortions a year.  Think about that.  Yeah, they could because it's her body and her affects on her body, and you're not the one pregnant.<br>  No, I don't think you can get charged, if your/her parents help you with it and are involved in the situation.  You're way too young, child.  Think about this.  You're going to be only 24 when your child turns 10.  How could you even wreak this little girl's body?  She'll have strech marks, and stress, and what if her body is too small to handle it here?  NO, 110.00 is not enough money to buy food, diapers, ANYTHING!<br>  You're better off giving birth to it, giving it up.  You're not going to handle it.  It's a miracle in your life, but you're still in school!  What are you going to do, quit school?!<br>  Your life is ALMOST over before you have that kid.  Do you understand that?  You're going to wreak everybody's lives around you, get picked on, everything.  Horrible, just horrible!<br>  But, other than the negative facts, I'm impressed that you don't want to have an abortion and give it up, and be a good dad at 14.  Take the responsibility, and...good luck.  Have fun in the next 8/9 months!  Puking, complaining, oh, so much fun.<br>  <br>  -Hazel <3
JP2h62qiaa	All pureed peaches, carrots, peas, Green beans, apple sauce, prunes, banana|`|QKWUSfq3aa	At this age you just want to introduce single fruits or veggies. Apples, peaches, pears, bananas, Green beans, peas, carrots, sweet potatoes, squash. When I give my 8 month old fresh fruits and veggies I just cook them til soft in a Ziploc Zip/Steam Bag and puree until there are only maybe really small chunks. You even want to cook the fruits and I use a food processor to puree them for a 6 month old. Is this what you mean? You also want to give them one at a time for 3-4 days to assure there is no allergic reaction.|`|bC69zGPKaa	I feel that it is better to introduce puree vegetable to your baby first, rather than fruits, to avoid them developing a sweet tooth. Another kind of food that is very nutritious for babies are grains such as millet, buckwheat, quinoa and amaranth. You can just boil them until soft and blend them using a food processor. As a start, introduce these grains one at a time.|`|y8d38Sbgaa	Hi!<br>  I use the website:<br>  <a href="http://www.babyfood101.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyfood101.com</a><br>  to help me figure out what to feed my baby.

Naturally I freaked out which made him freak out, but called my mom and dad (a CNA and an EMT) and asked if he'd get sick if he had accidentally put it in his mouth. They said yeah, but just give him a little water and he should be fine. I don't think he put any in his mouth, but needless to say, I won't be letting him hang out in just his diaper anymore! LOL! edit: I use desitin on him and put baby powder over it. Only when there's a rash, though :)|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	I have to keep pants on my baby because he takes his diaper off constantly and tries to run around naked.  I use some products that I found online that are very effective and saves me money through a membership.  I use the lotion every time because not only does he get a rash sometimes, he has eczema so I have to keep his skin moisturized all the time.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	It's too cold for that right now. When he first came home from the hospital we did the skin to skin cuddling but I put a blanket over both of us.  I use Desitin Original when he actually has a rash and cornstarch powder at diaper changes.|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	When weather permitted I let my kids go in just a diaper whenever we were at home and they wanted to... <br>  <br>  Bag Balm..

My son likes to be naked so he'll take his diaper off (and he's only 4 mos old) <br>  <br>  I actually use dry air for diaper rashes, after you give your baby a bath let them play naked for about 15 mins each day and your kid won't get a single diaper rash.<br>  <br>  If your babe already has a rash then use a light anti fungal cream, try asking you doctor for one. Believe it or not but the diaper rash cream the doctor supplies is basically a more mild athlete's foot cream.|`|ItFYVwlDaa	Hanging out in the diaper is fine as long as it's warm enough.<br>  Athletes foot creme (anti-fungal) works very quickly on some bad rashes.  Keep the area as dry as possible and change diapers frequently.  Keep using the creme until the rash is completely gone.|`|h1AIzD9baa	as for the diaper.. all the time!! babies seem much happier with out clothes!! and i dont mind bc its less i have to wash..

45nSn7Rcaa	Without reading it all I can tell you that this girl is simply not ready/not mature enough to handle a job and it would do her good to get fired ...explaining very firmly as to why she was fired and why what she was doing or not doing was wrong.  Ensure she learns from this lesson.|`|o34YHLiraa	It doesn't matter if the relationship would be marred, fire her and get someone older. Clearly she is not doing a good enough job.|`|AA11315360	Fire her. She is a KID. Clearly she is not responsible and will not listen to anything you tell her. So you need to be the ADULT and just fire her. Just tell her that you wont be needing her anymore and thanks for her help. Do not explain. You are the adult and you say you dont need her anymore, end of discussion.<br>  <br>  Then find someone older. Late teens or early 20s.|`|zmpk29BLaa	1) I wouldn't worry so much about the shows. Anything thats on cable is not that bad. The boys wont be interested enough in Gossip Girl to pay attention anyway. <br>  <br>  2) Tell her not to be afraid to say "No" to the kids. Just say "Well if they try to persuade you, disipline them. Don't be afraid to tell them no. If you can't stand up to them, then I don't think this will work out because we need you to keep them in line while we're gone".<br>  <br>  3) Just ask her not to kiss them so much. Say "You know, there are a lot of bugs and things that float around kids, so for everyones health we don't want you or the boys getting too close."<br>  <br>  Hopefully that might help, if not, then just tell your neighbor that you appriciate her daughter's help but that you've found someone who is a little older (or something) who can take over.|`|EgdR7cfTaa	i wouldn't hire a 13 year old to watch my kid.....plain and simple.|`|j4Jr2rvHaa	Your kids are your highest priority. They take precedence over your relationship with the girl, or your neighbors.<br>  <br>  If she's not doing the job the way you want her to, ask her to step up. If she's still watching shows you don't want her to watch with your kids around, or giving them food you don't want them to eat, then she's not the girl to take care of them. <br>  <br>  Fire her. It's simple enough to do. Tell her what you will and will not tolerate (as you've already done) and when she breaks those rules, you can let her go. If anyone asks why, tell them the truth. <br>  "I asked her do to/not to do things, and she's not doing what I asked. I don't feel comfortable letting her take care of my kids." <br>  <br>  Her parents will understand that too. They wouldn't want someone taking care of their kids that makes them uncomfortable.|`|lzivF4Idaa	find a new babysitter.|`|0y64qUHOaa	She really is too young to babysit your children...

F3dWvVy5aa	Yes, my friend had most of her babys at 34 weeks and they were fine enough to go home with her. they were just 5 lbs though, tiny babies. My grown daughter is on percocet right now for the pain in her pelvis caused by her baby. As for me I wouldn't take anything I'd be too scared but I guess her baby is so low and engaged that it feels like she is being torn in half. Gosh I wish you luck, you sound so close just milk it for all you can. I did hear that loose Bm is sign of labor though I had lots of children and that wasn't one of my signs. every woman is different. Good luck!!|`|lKqRd94zaa	I don't know why you are on bed rest in the first place but that can make a difference in wither your doctor will stop your contractions or allow you to have the baby. I am also on bed rest I have been since I was 30 weeks due to excessive stress causing my contractions. I was even in the hospital for 2 days. I have been taking meds for the contractions my OB told me that before 36 weeks they would do everything in their power to stop my contractions from progressing but after that I would be having the baby if I started having contractions again. So it really depends on why you are having contractions. I would talk to the doctor to find out when you should stop taking your medicine and when to get to the ER. As for you other question I too have been a frequent visitor to the WC. I am now 35 weeks and my baby dropped about 2 weeks ago. My hips hurt so bad some days I can barely walk. Also lots of pressure on my cervix when I stand. But my OB says it's normal. She thinks I will make it to 37 weeks as well. As long as I stay calm and rest and I don't get upset or stressed out. But we will see the baby might want out sooner. Hope this was of some help to you.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	it depends on the situation to if they stop labor, but the sooner the better...i'd go to the er and get checked out

In science or whatever accidentally bump into him in the dark and for the class when he sits behind you flick your hair a lot and then do the bend and snap!!

Have fun. xoxo gossip girl|`|0xR5UNRpaa	Sit as close to him as you can without looking strange and desperate.<br>  "Accidentally" brush against his arm or something.<br>  When talking, look him deeply in the eyes.|`|Pxi5cCZAaa	look at him seductively during sex ed. <br>  <br>  lmao :D
TSsT8QGgaa	i have been in the same boat.  we were in a resturaunt with my children, my brothers family, and my father.  we had 4 kids under the age of 6.  we had a woman come over to our table on the way out and compliment us on how well our children behaved, and it was a TREAT to watch our family.  jokingly my brother and i answered "well we only beat them when we need too".  she laughed and went on her way.  I have seen the "new technique" (of explaining what you did wrong, sitting in the time out chair, etc) and it does NOT WORK.  <br>  Agreed i never "beat" my children,,but they did get a smack on the butt, sometimes a two finger pop on the mouth, or a swat on the hand for touching things i had told them not to.  im sorry,,,but discipline has went out the window.  I grew up with a "fear" of my mother that if i did something wrong or knew it was wrong,,,i was going to get in trouble.  a little fear to me is a good thing.  it made me think about whether i wanted to do it or not. <br>   I have had people give me dirty looks, and make comments under their breath, but then i have also had people compliment me on their behavior.  Kids today do not fear a consequence.  <br>  I decided to have children,,,i decided HOW i wanted to raise them.  It is not someone elses job to tell me that i am doing a good OR bad job.  worry about your own kid and leave me and mine alone.<br>  <br>  P.S.  my children were toddlers prolly about 3 or 4,,,,and when we were out shopping it was often a punishment to "grab the cart" they were told to grab the cart if they were touching things i had told them not to,,,they were told to grab the cart if they were touching and annoying each other (typical lil kids), they were told to grab the cart if they were wandering off.  I had a lady in line give me a dirty look and say "well i never".  i looked at her and said "excuse me".  she then proceeded to tell me how mean and abusive that was.  I never TOUCHED them,,,i never RAISED my voice.  i just said grab the cart and they did it.  To the kids,,,it was more of a "game" to see how did it first and how long they could stay there.  I just shook my head and told her she would "never" as they were my children and I would take care of them.  Now this is the same lady that looked like if my kids were running up and down the aisle screaming at the top of their lungs prolly would have called security on me.  sometimes it is a double edged sword.  you are a bad parent if you discipline you are a bad parent if you do nothing.  it all goes back to the old saying "you can please some of the people some of the time,,but none of the people all of the time"|`|2lDQktYjaa	When you say you "beat his ***", it just sounds wrong and aggresive.<br>  Plus he is only 20 months and you didnt say spank you actually said beat. So just think about what went through her head. You're not the best parent on earth like you seem to think, otherwise you wouldn't use such bad language. She doesnt seems like the best parent either, but tell me who is? I am not saying that you abuse your child ( hopefully, although you did say u beat his ***). But you should be able to recognize that the language u used was not very nice, and u were also rude to her, you judged her from the beginning. You wanted nothing to do with her from the beginning, while she just asked u a question politely.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	Well she had some nerve! She calls you abusive to your face then proceeds to drag her child across the room by his ankle? What a hypocrite!! She's completely clueless as to what is actually abuse.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	she reacted to your poorly chosen words, that's on you, not her. I hope you do not "beat" your child, I hope you were exagerating. If you had spanked in public you'd prolly be in jail atm.....|`|91ff4dbbfbd7827f11b99d3972e133e1aa	Yes, my parenting skills wre questioned by my relatives sometimes,<br>  my daughter is 20 today very well behaved young lady, but at that<br>  age, they can be spoiled rotten and parents dont know how to cope<br>  sometimes, I was at the postoffice 2 wks ago and this poor grandfather<br>  took his grandchild, he was about 7 but a big kid he was tall, wouldnt<br>  get up to leave, he was just sitting on the floor and the man told him<br>  several times get up, get up, and the kid was just imp;ossible, just like<br>  the lady dragging the kid thru the post office, a lot of peoploe were<br>  snickering, but I didnt think it was funny, and you could see the<br>  frustration in the grandfathers face, I went outside for a smoke and<br>  he came outside still dragging the boy, the grandfather was tired and<br>  panting, so I dont know if I did the right thing I asked the grandpa<br>  do you want him to grow up like that, defying adults? He said no, but<br>  his parents dont discipline him at all, you dont have to hit him or <br>  anything I told him but you do have to be firm, specially if the parents<br>  are leaving him to you, there has to be rules, dont you think so?<br>  So I told the grandpa can I talk to the boy, sure go ahead.<br>  So I looked at the kid and all I had to do was tell him Get up!! he got<br>  up and i told him if he loved his grandpa, he said yes. Your grandpa<br>  loves you very much but if you misbehave hes going to take away all<br>  your videos that you love so much, I think he was in shock, please,<br>  dont I want my videos and games, then were not going to throw<br>  ourselves on the floor anymore right, your a big boy, your grandpa<br>  could get hurt or fall. If he calls me im coming for your toys.<br>  I saw him the next week at the post offioce and the grandpa actually<br>  smiled when he saw me, he came over and said thank you, he did<br>  change a little, he doesnt thtrow tantrums as much and respects me<br>  more, the thing is most parents dont like other people butting in when<br>  they see their children either screaming at the top of their lungs, or<br>  throwing food,or just being disobedient, but kids sometimes do deserve<br>  a swat on the behind, not exactly in front of people but if you promise<br>  something either a reward or spanking dont back down or they just<br>  do it again. Parents turn a blind eye to what their children are doing<br>  its easider that way. I think youre doing the right think, that lady that<br>  your talked to in a few years will have to deal with much bigger issues<br>  with that child.|`|P5ZvEtQHaa	maybe you could have phrased it a bit better than beating his A**. but unless she didnt want you to answer honestly she should have not asked you. I think she would have been upset either way , even if you had told her you spank your kid. so don't worry about it. pretty sad that she lets her kid walk all over her but youre doing an awesome job . keep it up.|`|bo2cCAKkaa	Well you know what i think...<br>  I am Just like you. I do the same thing and my little one acts really well in public. I think she needs a reality check! I hate when people act like that too. She was just mad to hear what you do because her son was acting really bad and wouldn't listen worth a darn. I think a spanking is better than yelling. Yelling makes kids mad and not wanna listen to you. Spanking is like Oh My Goodness i better not do that again. I really think what you do is the best it teaches them allot.|`|j4Jr2rvHaa	Spanking or "beating his ***" isn't about child abuse. It's about setting boundaries. You're teaching your child that there is an end point to his bad behavior, and going past that point means unpleasant consequences. <br>  You don't actually have to hurt a child to teach them this lesson. You can achieve similar results using time-outs and taking away things they love, but occasionally a spanking will send a very clear message quicker and more efficiently.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, too many people are jumping on the child abuse band-wagon, and most of them don't have the first clue what they're talking about. That woman in the store sounds like one of them.<br>  <br>  It's all this child abuse crap that's causing so many of today's children to behave like that kid in the store. They have no limits, and do what they want, because they have learnt that their parents are not in control of them.<br>  <br>  Don't let her attitude stress you out. She's just another clueless person with uneducated opinions and a big mouth.|`|koxMcDHuaa	I AGREE WITH YOU, THAT BEING SAID I WOULD HAVE USED DIFFERENT WORDS TO TELL HER INSTEAD OF "I BEAT HIS A**"<br>  I WOULD HAVE SAID "I SPANK HIS REAR" IT SOUNDS A LOT LESS ABUSIVE. <br>  <br>  I DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO WITH ALL 4 OF MY KIDS, AND THEY ARE THE HAPPIEST SWEETEST CALMEST MOST WELL BEHAVED KIDS I KNOW. EVERYONE ASKS ME WHAT MY SECRET IS AND HOW I RAISED ALL 4 KIDS WITH SUCH SWEET EVEN TEMPERS, AND I TELL THEM ITS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE, SPARE THE ROD, SPOIL THE CHILD. AND FOR GOD SAKES BE CONSISTENT! I RARELY IF EVER HAVE TO SPANK THEM, (WELL BECAUSE THEY KNOW BETTER) BUT WHEN THE MOMENT ARISES, YOU WONT BE SEEING ME COUNTING TO 10 AND GIVING EMPTY THREATS. I DO WHAT I NEED TO DO TO GET THEIR IMMEDIATE ATTENTION. AND I PROMISE YOU THEY ARE BETTER OFF FOR IT. I DONT BEAT THEM, JUST ONE OR TWO SWATS ON THE BEHIND WITH A FIRM NO WILL DO. IF YOU KNEW THEM YOU COULD PLAINLY SEE THAT ALL THEIR LITTLE PSYCHIES ARE INTACT.|`|lTUXdbCTaa	It sounds to me like you're just wanting to vent, cause there's no real answer to that question. People can do whatever they want and alot of times it can be really frustrating, like in your case. It sounds to me like you're a good parent, so keep it up :)<br>  And if this lady asked your advice, she doesn't have the right to get upset when you answer her honestly. It's her problem, not yours.<br>  It is so sad that parents do that to their kids though, treating them like that. First of all, it's a kid, they can't be an adult when they are a kid. They are going to act like a kid. Secondly, it seems many parents today are uneducated when raising their kids, when all it would take is to maybe read a parenting book, or take advice from people who have been through it.<br>  Overall, don't get too upset about it. Learn from other people's mistakes instead.|`|o34YHLiraa	I don't know why people are like that... they think that any sort of spanking is automatically child abuse. And then their kids behave like crap.<br>  <br>  Perhaps your phrasing wasn't the best, but then again that is the same thing my dad used to say regarding my brother and I. If we were bad we got spanked, if we were really bad we got our asses beaten. It wasn't child abuse, it was discipline, and both my brother and I turned out better for it.<br>  <br>  Some people are just too wussy to discipline kids, and that's her problem, she shouldn't be making it yours.|`|zmpk29BLaa	Well she was probably mislead by what you said. Spanking is not the same as "beating his @$$".. she probably thought you were a child abuser.<br>  <br>  That said, I think if done correctly, displine can be done in the form of spanking OR without spanking.. any kind of effective methods that will keep a child behaved are good ones. You don't have to spank\not spank to get your child to listen. I would just tell that mother that if she ENFORCED the rules, whether through spanking, time outs, or whatever, that her son might listen better.|`|VHHis05Naa	You beat your child?

nZVmkZSBaa	If he has that rep, it obviously came from someone he cheated on. Yes, he's playing you. My friends and I actually got this guy for cheating on my friend. We took his wallet, and with a needle stuck a hole through all of his condoms. And we took condoms, filled 'em with water, pudding, and dog crap, and popped it on his head. He's cheating with like 5 girls, so we'll see what happens when they all get pregnant by him. And lmao, he's 15 and has been a 'manwhore' since he was 11, apparently.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	hes a player.<br>  he told you that some girl called him a manwhore? seriously?|`|Q5tq5WOKaa	He really is.

rAD0mL7Saa	no-one knows for sure, and doctors and midwives won't be able to tell unless there's dilations. It could be pre-labour, or just Braxton Hicks. To go into labour this early would put you in a minority, but it's very, very normal. You never know. If it just keeps feeling like you need to poo even after you have, that could be the beginning of labour (pre-labour). Every-one's really different, so length, strength and timings of contractions don't really mean anything. The general advise is wait and see if it goes away, or stays. It might never get more intense the whole way through labour, or it might. No-one knows, I'm sorry|`|JqfIJtvYaa	Could be, but if they are not happening on a regular basis or progressing, they could be braxton-hicks.|`|DoaMYpfMaa	all deliveries aren't the same.  be patient but if you are in allot of pain go to the doctor and make sure.  good luck!! is it a boy or girl?
jLI0IgWkaa	It's normal, as he has a very good memory, and being that he had a bad experience with her once, sees her as his mortal enemy, and does not want her to invade his territory -- so to speak.<br>  <br>  the only advice I can offer is to sort of break him into being freindly with the baby. What I mean by this, is to baby him at first, when he comes running to you, and hold him on your lap. then have the other mom hold her baby on her lap, and slowly move into proximity of each other.<br>  <br>  good luck .|`|z91eUdKvaa	This is normal, it is just like a phase my son was the coolest at daycare when younger but now he is shy and doesn't really play with other kids until he has been around them a couple of times every child is different and react to things differently the next time he might go right up to the chid and start playing you never know|`|wmcYHH3Maa	weird.<br>  my baby brother did that too, <br>  but he got over it.<br>  he's in preschool now and he has lots of friends.<br>  <br>  maybe he's just sad that he made her cry, and feels like its his fault or something.<br>  <br>  my brother took a toy from another kid and they cried, and my brother ran away and hid and i had to have the other kid tell my brother its okay, and he's forgiven before they could play again...<br>  <br>  or maybe hes afraid of getting in trouble.|`|6hIeLhN6aa	I'm thinking that this can be a child's phase.<br>  Everybody goes through certain phases.<br>  But i think you should wait it out.<br>  Maybe consult a doctor if needed.
l43NSgHyaa	I don't see the problem.   The teacher was teaching, probably about health and nutrition, and hot dogs came up.  She gave the honest truth and information.  That's what school is for.  So, don't go acting like the teacher brainwashed your kid, because she didn't.    <br>  <br>  It sounds like your child is old enough to make sound decisions about their health and I think it's perfectly fine that he declares that he doesn't want to eat hot dogs.  After all, he's sort of right, there is all kinds of crap in them.<br>  <br>  Your child is smart, he's making smart choices about the foods he's putting into his body.   That's really wonderful for a child!  As a mother, you should be proud and say, "You know what honey, you're right.  We shouldn't eat hot dogs that have a lot of processed crap in them.  I'm glad you're taking an interest in your health"<br>  <br>  So, I don't get what's the issue.  If you can't afford the more expensive hot dogs, then don't buy them and that's that.   But, is this the teacher's fault, NO.|`|a8IRxC4raa	You do nothing.  The teacher gave your child information. So you pick some other inexpensive ways to make dinner.   Here are some recipes to get you started: <br>  <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/recipes/inexpensive" rel="nofollow">http://www.recipezaar.com/recipes/inexpe...</a><br>  <br>  All the best.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	quit buying hot dogs period|`|prqrQcd1aa	I've known about these unappetizing things being in hot dogs for quite some time... I'm thinking since i was about 13 or so. I'm 27 years old now and I will still eat a hot dog on occasion. I think that the teacher was just teaching them health possibly. In health class you are taught how to eat correctly...what is good for you and what isn't.<br>  I would explain to your children that if they don't want hot dogs then they may not eat Lil, i'm just joking here. Maybe humor them and buy the ones they really want a time or two. Ask them if they can really taste that much of a difference, and if they can't then switch back to the cheap brand!|`|45nSn7Rcaa	The teacher was right...they did nothing wrong in telling the children.  If your child doesn't want to eat hotdogs unless they are the expensive ones, because of this and you either aren't willing to or can't afford to buy those ones...then the solution is simple.  Don't buy hotdogs anymore and your child won't eat hotdogs anymore.  So then there will be one less bad thing your child will be eating.  It isn't like children NEED hotdogs.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	No offence, but it's the truth.<br>  <br>  You can't *growl* at a Teacher, for teaching. It's their job. I am sorry, but it is the truth and you cannot change that.<br>  There are plenty of cheaper, nicer, healthier things your Child could be eating, so blaming the economy isn't cutting it. Hot dogs aren't that appealing anyway, so I don't get the big problem.|`|AMyZvgcVaa	I would buy regular hot dogs and don't let him see you making them and when you give it to him tell him that's its the expensive kind!! He won't notice!!!!!|`|GDnJYq0Aaa	um its a kid if he hungery he will eat. And if your worred he wont the punish him for that eating it|`|MeYILJeSaa	Well...you could stop buying hot dogs.|`|BINKHZKtaa	1.  hotdogs are not good for you.  Be glad he is not eating them.<br>  2.  Hebrew National are the best/healthiest kind of hotdog.  If you are so cheap that you want to stick subpar food down your kids throat that is your problem<br>  3.  There is a huge child obesity problem in this country (actually your son's generation is the 1st to have a shorter life expectancy than their parents generation).  Feed your kid healthy food.  Stay away from cheap shitt.  No preservatives, no trans fat, no hormones, no high fructose corn syrup, no fast food, etc.  <br>  4.  Since he is not eating shittdogs anymore, replace them with fruits and vegetables.<br>  5.  This is your kids health.  It will affect him for the rest of his life.  You set the foundation now.  DOn't be a cheapskate on this.  Health and wellbeing is not something you skimp on.  <br>  <br>  Since you have a problem with this I'm guessing you are overweight.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	I wouldn't worry about it.  My dad did the SAME thing to me when I was little.  I won't lie, I didn't eat hot dogs for like a year.  But after a while I forgot about it, and I eat hot dogs now lol   <br>  <br>  Just don't eat hot dogs.  You don't have to replace it with the expensive kind.   If your kid wants hot dogs, just tell him its what you have or none at all.   <br>  <br>  Anyway, if people knew about half the stuff that was in our food we'd all be vegetarians.  The teacher was being honest, so what can you really do about it now.  You can't ask her to lie, because that wouldn't be right.   <br>  <br>  Your kid will probably forget, or he just won't care after a while.  Good luck!|`|d9b1447951374df512b15ee98c0bf39daa	I would question WHY it was said first. My daughter has come home and told us some pretty wild things. They have a food class every month where they all make things. Last month was a receipe that called for peanut butter... so you can guess what she came home with that time. <br>  <br>  Now, should I get mad at the teacher for telling my daughter that a lot of people were getting sick and some were even dieing because of peanut butter? <br>  <br>  So find out why she told them this. The fact that it is true goes to her side but if there was no good reason then you have a leg to stand on.|`|qQsFTkWmaa	do you relise the level of Nitrate in your OH SO YUMMIE hotdogs can cause your son to go sterial...<br>  <br>  all the cast off meats little bits here and there the lining of the guts liver stomach... ect all get growned up and saturated with so many chimicals that they ARE DISGUSTING...<br>  <br>  my son is 9mth old when hes old enough he wil NEVER get cheap hotdogs.. if he whines and says he want to eat what the other kids cheap parents feed there kid i will be sure he eats ONLY the kosher hebrew brand|`|zmpk29BLaa	I think that was a little out of line for a teacher to say.<br>  <br>  There are lots of other cheap foods besides hot dogs though.<br>  <br>  When I was young and I first found out what was in them, I stayed away for a few weeks but after that I just didn't care anymore so I ate them. Maybe he will change his mind.|`|CrZxYK5raa	kids have the right to no what they are eating!<br>  I say if you can't afford to buy the expensive hot dogs<br>  then don't buy them at all. if you want one and he will not <br>  eat it then tell him to make himself a sandwich.<br>  all kids should no what they are eating it will help with better<br>  eating choices.|`|47M20WOUaa	I love love Hot Dogs one of my favorite foods I do not care what is in them as long as I do not see it in the dog then its fine by me. But if I were you I would probably lie to him how will they know the difference if you take off the packaging XD|`|o34YHLiraa	Just let it go, and tell the kid that the hotdogs are fine. Cook up beans and weenies for dinner tomorrow night, he'll probably scarf 'em down and never give it a second thought.|`|Q68wyCuMaa	It's not really a big deal, there's no need to go to the teacher and make a big deal out of hotdogs. just tell your kid that they are the expensive brand.|`|KCpGsN2faa	Don't be mad at the teacher for doing her job; informing her students. You really shouldn't buy hot dogs cuz they are pretty gross. There is other stuff out there to buy that's cheap and wayyy healthier than hot dogs.|`|rBq189W1aa	Maybe you should start giving your kids real food instead.|`|u66CkBJLaa	and whats wrong with that.|`|qtNCfrYdaa	hey i stopped eating doughnuts when my teacher told us that theres the same amount of fat in a timmy's doughnut as a whopper from bk. But I don't think that not eating hot dogs could be a totally bad thing if they're made with gross and unappetizing ingredients (i have no idea whats in them and i dont want to know). <br>  <br>  If this is like..a snack he eats regularly why not just find something more healthy and less expensive?<br>  <br>   Or...if u want him to still eat hot dogs but he refuses absolutely to eat the cheaper stuff, your gonna have to explain to him that, money is tight, and you cant afford to have these special hot dogs all the time. If he wants to eat them then fine, but he cant have them as regularity as he used to. It would have to become more like a rare treat he gets.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. =]|`|tRrzHOCRaa	im sure that like most of us you expect honesty from your child...well you cant fairly expect to get what you dont give...and just because this time it didnt serve your purpose im also sure you dont want a teacher in place teaching your son lies!!  so allow your son to be who he is alot of us are disgusted by hotdogs!!! if you cant afford the other kind then tell him and find other inexpensive meals...there are lots of them....one of my faves is fry hashbrowns with half of a tin of corned beef and add peas you can freeze the other half for later it is filling ,good for you and cheap!!add ketchup and kids love it! check online for more ideas im sure you will find lots!! then save hotdogs for a treat!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Sure. hotdogs are kind of gross, when you consider how they're made. BUt they're not going to kill you (as long as you don't eat like 57 of them in one sitting). So what was the teacher's suggestion, to eat tofu? I'm being sarcastic, but serious at the same time. Sometimes I hear the things my son's preschool teachers say (one is kind of 'flaky,' but I love her to death) and wonder to myself. While so far it's nothing bad, kids are still impressionable and sometimes make judgments - whether wrong or right - based on their teacher's opinions. When it starts to cross over into the realm of their personal opinion and beliefs influencing my child, then I have a problem with it (wait until he's older - I'm sure it'll unfortunately be the first of many episodes). <br>  <br>  Depending on how old your son is, tell him - hotdogs can be okay to eat once in a while. But we really can't afford to buy the expensive kind of food all the time because we're trying to save money, and there's nothing wrong with that, either. As I say to my son, "When you're older, you'll understand!" LOL|`|P544Sbmqaa	Yeah, that is true about the hot dogs.  Same thing with vienna sausages and potted meat and even some things like mixed cocktail sausages are made that way.<br>  <br>  This is one of those things where I figure a couple of dollars extra for better hot dogs is not gonna make or break me.  Of course, you have to be careful when you do that, but...<br>  <br>  But, this is your home.  Bottom line, you have the final say.  If you want to get the other hot dogs then get them and make that the end of it.
C9QQPROkaa	Calm down first off and think about your options one im totally against is abortion. I would suggest being the age you are to give the baby up for adoption its the best thing your life as you know it is over should you decide to keep the baby because its a lot lot lot of work honey really. You just need to concentrate on finishing school because you cannot get a job these days without a college degree and even then its complicated adding a baby on to that is not smart.<br>  <br>  With that being said this girl is only 15 years old and for anyone to come on here to call her names and insult her is just wrong especially if you have kids yourself. She evidently was not getting this advice at home or whatever her issues her in her home. That's whats wrong with people now and days so quick to judge and put down instead of encourage and lift up. She's going to go through a lot now and she needs to know that its still possible for this to have a good outcome.<br>  <br>  Hang in there hun.|`|F3ArhTiRaa	i think you're not.  you feel like your pregnant because you're afraid of being pregnant. the result is negative.  if you want a clearer asnwer try to visit your doctor or try another test.  if you confirm that your not pregnant, please avoid having sexual intercourse again, you're still young to do that and still young to be a mother.  that thing can wait at the right time, okay?|`|QBCh4kKcaa	You shouldn't have had sex then you wouldn't be in this situation and you wouldn't be [possibly] pregnant since you don't want to be.

da497b496d860db69805aee850404dcdaa	The main reason why LASIK should not be done on children is that their vision is not yet stable. Children often experience significant changes in their vision, since all infants suffer from mild hyperopia, which fades, while myopia often does not set in until children enter their teens or even later. The changing vision of children is related to changes in their cornea. If children have LASIK done, they will most likely need it done a second time later on. In addition, no good data exists on the effects of reshaping on still-growing corneas.|`|AA12221392	my son had surgery on his eyes to fix a lazy eye problem when he was 7, and it was wonderful. He used to have to wear these ugly bifocals, and was made fun of all the time for his nerdy glasses. <br>  <br>  He hasn't worn glasses since a month after the surgery, and has wonderful vision now, and you can see his beautiful eyes. <br>  <br>  It only took a few mintues for each eye (yes both were done) and he was fine in a day, he slept the whole night after he came home (was awke for a few hours) but was fine the very next day. We still had to put drops in and all, but I would do it again ...|`|reO9Dgmsaa	I am personally not a fan of Lasik for ANYONE, not just children.  Our close family friend is an eye dr and is horrified by it; we had a long discussion about it once.  Lasik thins the corneas, which naturally happens as you get older.  Seems to me that it's foolish to do that, since it's aging your eyes.  I wonder if we'll start seeing people with cataracts and things in their 40s...lol!!|`|fRYQfvNaaa	No respectable doctor would perform eye surgery on a child, their eyes are still growing.

I'd get an impression of their values, their phone numbers, maybe even a background check!  You are a priceless, rare pearl to your mum and you don't just toss the pearl and see where it lands!  Also, if you've been trustworthy your mum will expect you to continue to be trustworthy and you'll get more independent excursions as time goes by.  Good Luck!|`|RyW3wLheaa	I know this question is directed at mothers... but as a teen i would let my mum meet my friends a few times before i left, so she could get an idea of who they are and what they are like.<br>  But it might depend on the relationship you have with your mum.|`|AfUuMEqVaa	I have a better idea.  Rather than calling your mom every time you are going to do something or go some place, why don't you just take your mom with you.  I'm sure she'd enjoy the trip!|`|pULnfsmpaa	i would say yes.|`|D4fucNxeaa	I would let my daughter go if I had one....but then I would be a pretty liberal parent mostly.

lzivF4Idaa	6 months and counting. my son 6 month old has cystic fibrosis so it will never go away.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	ALL of Kindergarten!  But she was faking.  :(   We couldn't figure out what was wrong with her.  We had tests done, she was at the doctors like every other week.  Finally, with no help from the doctors, I just took a guess and said she was doing it for attention.   We made up a reward chart for going to school everyday, and she hasn't been sick since.  <br>  <br>  I hope your daughter is going to be ok.   Sometimes it sucks because a cold seems like it passes from family member to family member and never goes away!|`|nrqWwQBXaa	sick like with a cold my son gets really sick every ear when he has a cold. when he was 1 he was in the hospital deadly sick with rsv. he was there for a month and still sick when he got home. he is 5 now and has had a cold for the last 3 weeks he is finally getting better?|`|FiUprYsvaa	When I was in K, I was sick and missed about 90 days of school.

A couple weeks after removing gluten from his diet, he was fine.<br>  <br>  My daughter had influenza once that resulted in pneumonia.  She was sick for over 2 weeks.|`|i1CH2qD5aa	Depending on the sickness, my son had a reacurring ear infection in both ears that just wouldn't go away. The problem was it would only hit during the weekend and so we tool him to the emrg dept. every weekend for a month, finally i got him into the family doc and he said his immune system was so weak that he couldn't fight it off even with antibiotics. So he told me to give him supplemental drinks it worked for him|`|JivuAmfiaa	My daughter Kaitlyn caught some kind of Stomach bug and was sick for 4.5 weeks and her school ended up giving me a letter warning me that she had had too much time off and that they were taking legal action! I hope your daughter gets better soon, it's awful when they're sick!|`|llez7aU4aa	Well I don't have human kids, but once my cat was sick for almost a week. It turns out she had tuna in her nose so that was a easy fix when figured it out.
QKWUSfq3aa	You're right, if you wait til you're financially ready you'll never have a baby! I quit working when I had my baby 8 months ago. It has been an adjustment. I can't just go out shopping whenever I want now for new clothes or frivolous things or we can't spend as much fixing up our house but it is worth it. It just takes some lifestyle changes. Being smarter with your money and more thrifty. But I wouldn't change a thing! These precious month with her are worth more than any amount of money! You could sell Avon or Tastefully Simple. Also, the money I would have made working would have went to daycare so it was pointless to go back to work so I could pay someone to raise my child. Some people have no choice but I can't imagine dropping my baby off at 8am then picking up at 5pm and only getting to spend 3-4 hours a night with them before they go to bed. It's like a "nights & weekend" relationship. Who wants that with their child? Not me!! Good Luck to you!!|`|8yTP3jO8aa	I agree that you will never truly be "ready" if you keep waiting, but you also have to make sure that you are self reliant and sufficient.  It's one thing to say "I want to have more money in savings/a bigger house/another car/a boat" or whatever before having a baby, but it's perfectly reasonable (and responsible!) to say "I want to be able to pay our bills and not worry about having enough money for food/shelter/clothing".<br>  <br>  Selling Avon can work really well if you can build a strong reputation with people who do not already have a strong relationship with someone else.  I adore my Avon lady and wouldn't ever consider buying from anyone else unless she told me too (they were "subbing" for her), or if she were no longer selling.  So, if you can find an area that doesn't have strong attachments to someone, it could work well.<br>  <br>  But, since you're a teacher, what about private tutoring sessions?  You could have these in your home and be right there with your baby.  While the child is a newborn/baby, you can wear him in a wrap or sling while you tutor, and when he's a toddler you can let him safely play in another room while you tutor, or schedule your sessions when your husband will be home to help supervise.|`|aeee235e3c1c57b6a0b6dd8f24b75dcdaa	What hours does your husband work? May after he comes home, if he works days. You could find a part time cleaning job (3-4 hours) in the evenings for a few hours. This way he gets to spend some a lone time with the baby, and you get to make a little cash.<br>  <br>  Or maybe once your baby is a few months old, you could baby sit a small child (steady for a few hours a day) if not all week Mon-Fri. Then maybe 3 days a week.<br>  <br>  Some supermarkets need people to re-stock the shelves, at nights for a few hours. I'm sure you would like to enjoy your weekends, with your husband (once baby comes). But maybe you could work the whole weekend, and your have the whole week to being with the baby, shopping, cleaning and other stuff.|`|AA10106191	Check this article out, it could be of help:<br>  <a href="http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/CollegeAndFamily/RaiseKids/4realJobsYouCanDoFromHome.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Col...</a>|`|N3jwE76maa	My husband and i mainly live off his fortnightly wage, and i only work 1 and half days a week.

HSUfe3m7aa	No chance after 5 tests and your periods. Sounds like acid reflux to me.|`|gT31DB1caa	if you have had two normal periods (3-5days) and 5 negative pregnancy tests then the chances are that you are not pregnant. you most likely have acid reflux or indegestion. either way you should consult your doctor.|`|2WWEn2mZaa	What is with people and the HPTs? Dang people seen a doctor. Women at times feel the need to vomit and are not pregnant.|`|BDarMnDeaa	There are always chances of pregnancy.. if you are THAT paranoid go to your doctor. I don't think you are pregnant.. considering you got your period.|`|weadibPeaa	probably not this time around since youve had your period.. and since the tests all say negative|`|YkzPfyp2aa	Doesn't sound like your pregnant.  Perhaps the throwing up feeling is a a stomach flu or something your eating that doesn't agree with you.|`|L5ie6msYaa	very very very slim. the test is very accurate over 5 times is scientifically imposible that u are so dont worry about a thing. and drink pepto-bismol|`|Pfge6j7Aaa	You are not pregnant.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Hun. YOU ARE NOT PREGNANT! You CANNOT have periods while pregnant. GO TO A CLINIC they will tell you the same thing.
Ty4UC8GLaa	OMG! that's an awesome name!<br>  It sounds like a famous actor or something. I mean, you know when some actors have different names and they're hard to forget?? LOL<br>  thats a good thing.|`|IszydZIjaa	Well Kiddo,<br>  I think you should go with whatever your heart tells you.<br>  Just wait till you get a spouse. Child naming is something you both will need to come to an agreement in.|`|zzHWO4Haaa	I think it's an alright name. But Felix The Cat is the first thing that comes to mind... So in school he might get picked on about it for a while.|`|u2rYPblDaa	Ask yourself if your son would like this name when he get's older?|`|RfGTXlotaa	i like it its better then Pilot Inspektor :)|`|77YWNCV5aa	I think it's a very good name! Cute as s**t|`|2rOQyvaKaa	Felix the cat? Yes it's freakin weird. Why would you want to named your son after a cartoon cat?|`|1K7fe9lBaa	it goes good together,<br>  but i think phoenix is better.<br>  <br>  for some reason felix reminds me of a cat.|`|s4iVl04raa	Felix is a totally okay name! I love the name Felix, I've actually known someone by that name before. =)|`|igvUbqkyaa	I love the name Martin and the nickname Marty!! Felix is nice as well. I don't care for Fain though (unless that is the last name).|`|14JQ11AUaa	Nope, it sounds ok together.|`|drp30rf5aa	I LIKE it!  It sounds regal...|`|9ko5WUFkaa	Felix is not too bad, Martin is old but OK and works nicely with Felix.  Not too sure about Fain - it does seem a bit much and it's not like the kid has any need for three names.  The only time they'd ever use it is on official papers and it seems kinda pointless.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  To those that say he'd get picked on a school for the 'Felix the Cat' reference.  Why?  What kids from even this generation, let alone the next know of Felix the Cat.  My 4yo niece goes to school with a Felix and when I made a 'Felix the Cat' joke once she just wanted to know what Felix's cat was called...|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Felix is SO CUTE. I don't care for the middle name, but Felix is adorable.|`|Am54a7c0aa	It's ok, I don't mind it.|`|2CYfjPA6aa	I like the name Felix|`|j0Jkq4z2aa	its Oknot the best i think you could come up with something better : )|`|uVSQWygAaa	its ok, kinda cute. i would flip it and be martin felix fain.|`|F6g2iH78aa	i like that name!|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	I like it.
gT31DB1caa	they gave me steriods during my first pregnancy because my baby was measuring small for date the baby should still come at full term or like you said when he is ready but that doesn't mean he will be "ready" prematurely because a 32 week baby should be weighing in at at least 4 pounds
F8KmTbqjaa	It depends on what kind of blood test you have done.  A beta test shows the exact amount of HCG in a women's blood.  A non-pregnant women can have up to 5 miu so anything over 5 is positive, those are 99.9% accurate.  A normal quagulative (spelled it wrong but I hope you know what I mean) HCG test only shows positive if the HCG is over 20 miu (so it does not measure and exact amount) those tests are about as accurate as a First Response home urine pregnancy test, so about 98% accurate.  The thing with blood vs. urine is that blood won't ever be diluted like urine can be so therefore its more accurate sooner.  Last but not least there is always human error that can yield false positives or negatives.|`|FjGeKhY0aa	I don't know if there is anything more accurate than a blood test... I doubt that she was 3 months along and her hormones were that low that neither a blood test nor pregnancy test caught it... weird|`|IPsjE9Rpaa	Doctors will back blood test no matter what they say there 100% if the blood test says no then it's a no if yes then congratz.. PLAIN AND SIMPLE if you think your prego take a blood test.|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	100% accurate.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	usually 100% unless you have a medical condition thats screwing with your horomons or the lab made a mistake|`|qfSKgxDsaa	blood tests are very accurate|`|91db67023fc6e1186360fd9330d83699aa	I cant beleive this blood test are supposed to be accurate.
13hFRGN9aa	the white stuff is a sign of ovulation. (its not a infection) the follicles(eggs) are probably bigger then normal and that may what is causing pressure. if it doesn't go away in a couple of days then i would consult a doctor.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	I would take a test those symptom sound like pregnancy good luck.......|`|JI1EpWX6aa	Well the white discharge its an infection *down there*. and for the other stuff i recomend seeing a doctor.
9ko5WUFkaa	The girls names are awful - especially Calypso, Winnifred and Aileas.  Coraline is also bad, but the other second names for girls are OK, not great but OK.<br>  <br>  The boys names - well, they are a bit better but I still don't like them.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but you asked what I think...|`|igvUbqkyaa	I LOVE both Scott and Hugh!!! I say Scott Hugh or Hugh Scott!<br>  <br>  And I like Violette Coraline best for the girl.|`|6C24kJhaaa	yup those are names :) what do you mean exactly, like for your kid?|`|dN5BJeVpaa	I LOVE the boy's names. Especially Dorian.<br>  <br>  The girl's names are all nice - I especially like Calypso and Daphne.

When I hear that name I think of the game Twisted Metal. There not really my style but I love Coraline its one of my favorite names. How about Viola instead of Violette.|`|Ty4UC8GLaa	I only like Jacob Gordon and Winnifred Daphne. Though I think it'd be better if the names were by themselves. Like, Winnifred and Daphne.|`|zzHWO4Haaa	I like Cillian Scott, Dorian Arthur and Violette Coraline.|`|2CYfjPA6aa	I LOVE Cillian Scott!<br>  <br>  and also Winnifred Daphne, and Violette Coraline.|`|ZSlaNKEkaa	Callian Scott is a good name, the rest are ok but I'm not loving them.|`|RfGTXlotaa	not sure of Calypso... the rest are ok
qQsFTkWmaa	get a camera or even a video tape recorder... and leave the camera hidden or hide the recorder under the bed see/hear whats going on...<br>  <br>  <br>  take a long lunch at work and "suprise" vist the house..<br>  <br>  how does she act with her own baby... does she leave it to cry?? leave it in a dirty diaper?? seem unhurried to respond to her own childs needs..???<br>  <br>  trust your gut but it never hurts to take a second look|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Well, do you trust the baby sitter or your neigbor?<br>  <br>  If you trust your neighbor, fire her ***.|`|AA12221392	First do you have a older child as well? <br>   I would say as well just because a neighbor hears a baby crying doesn't mean she is doing something wrong,  but yes it could. <br>  <br>  Now another thing does she have a car seat for your infant? I would be more worried about my baby riding in a car without being in a seat then my child crying some.<br>  <br>  Now everyone say a nanny camerea, and I agree for more than one reason, first it will give you what answers you need to make a good descision, and second, if she is hurting your child , she more than likely is hurting her own child, and although this isn't your child, it is still a child that may need to be protective. <br>  <br>  But if your gut says something is wrong, then you need to get rid of her and then call someone that may be able to help her child as well. <br>  <br>  Remember in this world that we live in 30 minutes to one person is a hour to another, so forth . Some people view things very differently, and take things out of context of the real situtation, and some don't. But as you can see from y/a  board that we all have very different views as what is the right parenting, how long a child should cry, not to spank to spank,  and so forth. <br>  <br>  How well do you know this person that you left her with? did you check other people that she may have babysat for? Didn't you observe her behavior with her own child ?|`|F2wI6NGNaa	if there is any doubt or accusations from anyone about a babysitter get rid of her its not worth the risk if you dont your a bad mother in my oppinion|`|YF8Qe714aa	Buy a camera and hide it somewhere in the house where the baby is often.

Put it in the living room or wherever the babysitter should be the most so you can see whether or not she leaves the house and observe her interactions with your baby.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Dont say a word to her about it, it may only cause a big fight. i would trust your neighbor and just kick your friend to the curb and find a new baby sitter.|`|4zvjt5Cnaa	Is it really worth it to question it?

You need to try everything and eventually you'll find something he likes. If he's colic then nothing might help and in that case you might just have to let him cry.  Try and tire him out by playing w/ him and making him laugh.|`|Bux3LMmDaa	Apply Hing (Herbal Extract-available at all Indian Goods provisions shops) paste on the Umbilical cord disconnecting point(Dhunee).<br>  Child will get relief & sleep well.|`|N3jwE76maa	Just put him down and leave him.

Ugh!  I think u can guess why. :o)
AtVRWrwCaa	the fact that she is telling you what kind of job to have and how to raise your child is ridiculous. she is totally out of line. her job is to tell you how to take care of yourself during your pregnancy and keep yourself healthy. your job, money, school and time are none of her business. it doesn't matter how well she is trained or what recommendations she has. I'd see another doctor since she is telling you so many things that are not right/not her business.<br>  <br>  also- you are right. no weight gain during pregnancy is very unhealthy. I'd follow the instructions of your regular OB since she seems to actually know what she is talking about lol|`|gT31DB1caa	i have never had this kind of experience with a dr but if it was me in your situation i would just have to drive an hour. that dr has no right to judge you especially not right now.|`|dCIi9qf5aa	Unfortunately many people have crappy doctors. You have to examine this doctors heart. She doesn't have love for you. And she disrespects you. What you and your husband do or earn is none of her business. Don't listen to her. Hightail it back to your other doctor fast.  Its not that you are too sensitive. She was offensive and hurtful. And she gave you wrong Information. Every one gains some weight while pregnant. Just keep in mind that the more you gain the longer it will take to get it off. Go home and have your husband say to you "we/You have to go back to the other doctor cause of my insurance" Then let that doctor know that you cant come back because you husband said so. Being pregnant is a sensitive time, God doesn't like it when pregnant women are made to cry or feel emotionally upset. He pays people who upset pregnant women back. So for that doctors sake stop seeing her to spare her God's wrath.Don't go to anybody that makes you upset. When you get upset it releases certain chemicals that the baby's body shouldn't receive and just cant handle. Many babies come out "coliky" (crying for three months) when the mother has experienced violence or sadness. Have your husband and a neighbor travel the hour drive with you sometime, don't always go by yourself. Good luck.|`|fc3045470b792b9f04d696b7f2f9cd91aa	I would advise you to lose this OB, and fast.  How dare she insinuate anything, or make assumptions about how you are going to raise your child and about your finances.  That really is none of her business and it is grounds for finding another OB.  You said there are only a few in the area, well I would go for the next best OB.  This woman is going to stress you out during every visit you have with her and you really don't need that hon.|`|93b9efecd6ca82bff2f4e552457b1bd7aa	It sounds to me that this Physician has overstepped her bounds and were it me, I would "fire" her and retain the services of another physician. Is there truly only one Physician or Nurse Mid Wife on your insurance on your Insurance? If there are more than one physician who delivers babies on your insurance, then maybe try another one and see if you "click" better with the new Physician.<br>  <br>  If not, then is there anyone who you could stay with when your time comes close that is closer to your regular Physician? What does your regular Physician say about the distance? I know my Sister always delivered at one particular hospital and it is a good 40 minutes away from their house and they never had any problems.|`|Pfge6j7Aaa	IT sounds like the doctor you went to see has some unresolved issues of her own. If it were me I would find another doctor just cause I get annoyed at people like that to easily.I would say do what you feel comfortable with, see if your regular OB can give you a reccomendation on someone to go to in your area.|`|jKMH27gKaa	OMG that doc sounds horrible! NO doctor worth their salt will opine about a patient's economical status or whether it's okay to be a stay-at-home mom; in fact, it's not just unprofessional, it's rude. You're right, it's totally not her business. Go back to your doc an hour away -- or to another in your area that is less awful. Can your old doc recommend/refer you to someone else? Good luck -- follow your instincts and hold out for someone you feel confident about.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	you should be totally comfortable with your doctor, id switch if you arent
W1p6LetFaa	I thought the same thing, that it wouldn't make sense for my "period-like" cramps to still be in my lower abdomen where my uterus used to be, but it still feels the same!  I am due in 3 days, so my uterus is all the way up in my lungs, but I still feel the period like cramping down in my lower abdomen!  I can't explain it.  I don't know if it's that it is actually only cramping down there, or if I am just so used to uterine cramping being down there that my body doesn't notice how big my uterus is, if that makes sense...<br>  <br>  So yes, they still feel exactly the same for me!  Weird!|`|reO9Dgmsaa	I didn't notice any with my daughter until the round ligament pains at around 20 weeks, but this time yes, I have low menstrual-type cramps often.  I get a bit freaked out since I miscarried last fall, but I am staying positive and telling myself all will be well this time.  :)<br>  Good luck to you!
tF3iHmrCaa	I feel sorry for you.  That is all.
vw0qsY6Iaa	Easy, I would set sticky fingers up. Leave faintly marked money out when only you and her and your mom are home, and catch her red handed. Than she cant deny it and you have concreet evidence. Then I would give her a punishment she will never forget.|`|AMBPkEjXaa	Just dont give her money anymore for a while until she learns what she did is wrong|`|AfUuMEqVaa	This 11 year old child needs a counselor. She will get worse and worse  because she knows that she is getting you all upset.  Make an appt with a child counselor and tell him/her exactly what's going on.  When she knows that you finally won't stand for all this nonsense, she's bound to change, hopefully for the better.|`|lmGN2BrYaa	I like Blitz's answer.  When you do catch her sit her down and discuss the consequences of her actions, i.e., budget for the house, etc.  Have her help you with the budget and buying groceries, so she will know the value of things she consumes in the house.  Also, if she has access to money from her Dad, ask her to contribute to the household by buying her own clothes, school supplies, school lunches, etc.  She can and should also help with the recycling of the cans and bottles.  She needs a lesson, not a grounding.|`|sVbZEWveaa	I would go ahead and mark the money but in ways that are not very noticeable. Also at 11 years old she should not have that much access to money. I would also start taking her stuff out of her room. Maybe then she will understand how it feels to have someone steal from her. That would be a way to teach her a lesson. Take her stuff and hide it and see if she learns.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Don't leave money where, she would be able to get her hands on it.<br>  <br>  You need to be creative in, where to hide money that you know she won't look i.e. Go to a spy shop and, ask them for ideas.|`|IPsjE9Rpaa	It's really easy if she steals from a store or something you just take her to the store it came from and confront the manger and scare her and get them to say they normally call the cops ect ect... At home if she steals you take away piece by peice out of her room if she keep's it up you take her door off her hendges and take away all her privacy so she cant hide anything.... The door trick is the best one in the book it stop anything that they do because they want there privacy back.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	Marking the money is a good idea.  Stealing from her (not with the intent of spending it but just teaching) is also an idea.  Take her money and then when it comes up missing and she accuses you tell her that you do have it, just like she has your $20 and you wanted her to know what it felt like to be ripped off.  If she keeps stealing confiscate things worth the amount she stole until she comes up with the money.  I bet she "finds it" really quickly when a webkinz or something like that is on the line.|`|nZVmkZSBaa	That's a bad habit that should have been dealt with from the start. Now it's from family, later it will be from others. Just confront her; she should be nervous, not you. Just tell her that you've noticed she has a lot of money recently, and tell her some insane story about how you're moving because there are thiefs in the neighbourhood. Or, just say you're grounded. And obviously she will as why; just say, for taking things that don't belong to you. Then tell her after she writes a paper on what she took, her punishment will be over. That way, she will want to just confess. Good luck. x.|`|q1KSTbqnaa	well i think you definitely have to get to the bottom of this. firstly i would sit her at the table with you and mom explain to her that it is bad to steal and this is the important bit. tell her that some money has gone missing from That pile you mentioned, you are not mad and you are going to go out and when you come home you would like to see that the money is complete again. no questions asked. if it doesn't get returned , then explain that no money is allowed to be left around as there is a thief about.<br>   from then on keep all temptation away be hiding the money.<br>   i have bought a really small and cheap safe to do exactly this. a robber could just walk off with the safe under his arm but it is not meant for that. it is just a deterrent for the young ones in the family. <br>  it has worked so far !  good luck.
s6qgkfLxaa	The risk of miscarriage decreases tremendously after 12 weeks. I've had a miscarriage, eight in fact. None went over twelve weeks, so dont worry. You'll be fine.<br>  <br>  abdominal cramping<br>  nausea<br>  bleeding (light soometimes is ok)<br>  extreme pain<br>  <br>  (those are the main ones to worry about)<br>  If you have a miscarriage- you know.  I used to worry a lot but I gave birth to a healthy baby boy two weeks ago. the key is: dont worry
yp9rEMSraa	Just try and be patient if you can...it isn't as easy as everyone and your parents made it out to be those years when you were growing up....My first month i felt all the symptoms...my breast we sore, back cramping, gasy, pressure in the cervix area...i was late 15 days and just new i was prego but i was not...i would start taking prenatal vitamins to make sure that you are getting all the vitamins you need, try to eating healthy (both you and your mate)....remember that it takes some women up to a year to get pregnant and some longer...have fun when trying to conceive cause i have heard it will not happen unless everything is right...they have supplements for men if your partner wants to take them...some women don't get implantion bleeding so you might not ever get that....try charting your most fertile days you can find a bunch of calenders on the web for ovulation...or they have ovulation test kits and monitors...I wish you the best of luck and I hope you get prego soon...Baby dust|`|qfSKgxDsaa	you dont always have implantation bleeding...it could be too soon to have a postivie test.  Make sure when you take the test it's your first pee of the day and in the morning.  Think pregnant!  Wait a few more days and if you havent gotten your period do another test and or go to your obgyn (if you haven't gotten your period within 2 weeks)|`|nhhCow4haa	When taking pregnancy tests its best to use first morning urine (as in the first wee you take of the day when you wake up). You could do one tomorrow morning since your period is late. However the stress of trying to conceive could have made your period late. Also its not very common to get pregnant on the first go! Good luck|`|13hFRGN9aa	i would wait a couple of more days before taking a pg test.

Iu0AJDviaa	the biggest thing that kills pregnant women in america is murder.<br>  <br>  although it sometimes happens,the doctors are really good these days in looking after you.|`|6783eff5fcc328b9527aa61f6d84bcf2aa	sorry for the lack of capitals, typing with one hand.  in the united states it is very rare.  as long as you are in a medical facility, they are monitoring you.  child birth used to have a high mother fatality rate because of complications in birth and excessive blood loss and infection after birth.  the doctor's are looking out for that.   you are more likely to have a heart attack then die giving birth.  it's a very rational fear, it can be an exhausting experience.  i remember having many fears when i was pregnant, but in the end i was so excited to see my little girl (and be over with it) that those fears dissolved.  talk with your doctor's about these concerns so they can reassure you.  my doctor had never had a woman die giving birth in her career.|`|2WWEn2mZaa	In the USA it's EXTREMELY rare to die giving birth. But *Rach* is correct. The leading cause of death amongst pregnant women is murder by spouse or boyfriend. I heard that just today on TV.
e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	If gas was a symptom of pregnancy I'd have dozens of babies. Take a test.
AA11435295	firstly, this isnt even a question, its a statement. Second.. If you cant take care of the baby, you shouldnt be having sex. If you cant take care of yourself, then you shouldnt be having sex. If you cant take care of your 1st child, you shouldnt be having sex. Obviously, you shouldnt be having sex.. if you're not able to handle what comes out of it. And it may be your body but abortion should never, ever be used as a birth control. You are killing an innocent being, because you're a selfish whore.. who cares if your life is ruined if you have this baby.. it could be put up for adoption it could have a better life then you, which you dont deserve. You dont deserve to have the life/dream your parents wanted for you, you make your own choices and you made the wrong ones.. nobodies fault but your own.<br>  <br>  EDIT: dont listen to all the ppl telling u good things about yourself.. you are not a good person.. you do not deserve to go to college and no matter how much money you make you will never be able to support a child because you are a heart-less *** dumpster!|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Abortion is NOT a method a contraception. You messed up big time and need to take responsiblity for your actions. Its not the baby's fault and it shouldn't have to die because of your screw up. <br>  Please consider adoption. And make something good come out of this horrible situation you got yourself into.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Get on BC and quit being so careless. Don't murder an innocent baby because YOU chose to sleep with someone and not take precautions. What the hell is wrong with you? If you already have a child how can you do an abortion once, let alone TWICE?! UGH! People like you should have been aborted.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Sorry to hear use a condom next time baby are blessings from God but since you don't want them continue to use condoms good luck........|`|weadibPeaa	you are a masochist for even posting that on this board...get ready for the dust to fly lol|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	wow 18 and does not know that sex = pregnancy??? why not wait til your old enough to understand that you are killing a baby. dont give me the college and life is perfect the way it is crap. I was 19 with my 1st left college had the baby, my father died got pregnant again i am 22 and have 2 kids and NO COLLEGE DEGREE so dont give me the its unfair crap. suck it up have the baby, and give it up for adoption. I am just now at 22 going back to college online with a 4 month old and a 23 month old. I put my college on hold and took care of my kids. you had sex deal with the fact that you have to put it on hold. after you have the kid when its old enough to play on its own do an online college .<br>  <br>  EDIT: GET ON BIRTH CONTROL SO YOU DONT KILL ANOTHER BABY BECAUSE OF YOUR CARELESS LIFESTYLE!!!!!!!!!|`|reO9Dgmsaa	I'm not going to call you a sinner; that is between you and God.  But I do have to say, using abortion as birth control is VERY unwise for your health, and stupid as hell.  <br>  <br>  Give this baby up for adoption.  There are COUNTLESS families who cannot conceive!  Stop being selfish and do the right thing by THIS child.  This makes me sick. You do not have to tell anyone who the father is; just carry the baby to term and give it to a loving couple.<br>  <br>  And you may want to seek counseling as to why you are hurting yourself by having an affair.  Obviously you think nothing of your heart, and may even be depressed.  Someone with high self esteem does NOT sleep with an unavailable man; you are setting yourself up for hurt over and over.|`|E2UXN7J1aa	What is the question here? You seem pretty set of murdering your baby so should I really waste my time telling you how terrible of a person you sound like? I'm sorry, but some people I just don't have compassion for. STOP fooling around with someone who is married and be more careful when having sex if all you are going to do is have abortion after abortion.|`|eya1WDS4aa	First off quit sleeping with a married man. If i found out you where sleeping with my husband i would kick his butt then yours. Secondly quit using abortion as a form of birth control, keep your legs closed. third give the baby up for adoption its not right to kill a baby because of your mess ups.|`|HJbZHS2uaa	I think you should just go ahead and have the abortion.. You just need to stop getting pregnant(:|`|AA11315360	Is there even a question here? Why are you airing your dirty laundry online? If you want or need another abortion, ok then do it. Dont share it with the world though or you will get people saying horrible things to you. Keep it as a private matter. No one needs to know.<br>  <br>  Or try to have the baby and give it up for adoption. Thats always an option and no one ever says anything bad about women doing that. You can choose the couple who adopts you child and they pay for your medical expenses.|`|AztPvbauaa	I wonder where you get the courage to post such a thing on the Internet.but on a serious note that baby is not in anyway responsible for the outcome.please have him and either give him up for adoption or beg your parents for a last chance.when I imagine that baby peaceful heart beating it breaks my heart to think you are about to kill him.I hope this would change your mind and one more thing,stay away from that married man cause all he's doing is taking advantage of your immaturity.<br>  Almost 24 and 36 weeks pregnant with first child|`|OJ0POy4Xaa	You should carry the pregnancy to term and put the baby up for adoption. On average it takes a woman (even a pro-choice woman) 9 YEARS to emotionally recover from an abortion. I think you need to find a counselor to help you through this. This doesn't have to ruin anyone's life. Just carry the baby and let it live its life with someone who can't have their own and who would be forever grateful. It seems like it's the more painful decision but in a few years looking back on this you will feel better about it. <br>  Afterward, you should get an IUD or Depo-provera. You just need birth control that you don't have to think about every day like a pill or every month like a plastic ring. Keep it simple. <br>  And don't bother with married men, unless you are his wife a married man is nothing but trouble.|`|YpN50jFDaa	Oh my GOSH!  I looked at your past questions and noticed that you did not post a question about "should I have unprotected sex with a MARRIED man???"  I'm sure that you would have received a lot of "ummm...NO's"...and "What are you thinking???"  This is kinda like closing the barn door AFTER the horse has DIED...You have one child already...had 1 abortion and now will have another???  Did you have HEALTH at all in school...Were you sleeping that day you were supposed to learn about ways to get pregnant???  Oh...FYI...might want to keep your profile "private"...I was able to look at your past questions...My personal favorite was the STD one!  (NOT)<br>  <br>  Posted later...might I suggest another method of birth control?  It's the ASPIRIN METHOD!...Sit on a chair with your knees together...stick an aspirin between your knees and DON'T LET IT FALL...It's guaranteed to work!  (you won't be able to spread yer legs to have sex...in case you didn't understand this...)|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I think you need love and counceling. Reading this I see you are hard and down on yourself. Your self worth is low.<br>  <br>  Honey we all make mistakes in life. I've been through some horrible things that I don't even talk about. I went through a faze where I didn't care about myself or my body. I care now.<br>  <br>  I went to counceling for the terrible things that haunt me, and I turned my life around. I think you need to seek counceling. You need support not abuse. Email me if you want to talk.|`|JXsViDciaa	You have answered your own question/comment. You have to live with your own conscience. Live to learn from your mistakes and don't **** up again. I'm not necessarily pro-abortion but you have got to wake up and stop ******* like there is no consequence!  Believe it or not, there are methods of birth control...next time, try using one of them. Don't come here looking for sympathy.|`|AtVRWrwCaa	So whats your question? your doing what you need to do. (even though you could give this baby up for adoption) I don't agree with your decision, but I'm in no place to tell you what to do.|`|HXh7u0lEaa	It sounds like you have made up your mind. If you decide to abort, you really need to speak to the Dr about contraception so it can't happen again.|`|9e6a66fe8592d126c6b207054fb2fa7aaa	Sounds like you need to have one and close your legs for a few years.  When you open them again make sure it's with someone monogamous and use protection. No excuses after this you dumb@ss!|`|rlECRYwgaa	YOu are a sorry *** girl, shut your legs!   babies are a blessing, there's ladies that can't have babies that would love to adopt.|`|Pfge6j7Aaa	Abortion is the same as murder|`|vc67fw68aa	Great job! get an abortion and get another one ... ask about a discount card ... you know get 10 abortions get the 11th FREE! haha!<br>  <br>  Nice try ... smells kind of trolly ...|`|8DEiCLZUaa	You have 2 consider the life you do have & given your situation you can't have another baby. College is your best option & I hope you go & graduate. But you should stop seeing this man,if he already has a family he can't do anything 4 you or the baby you have at home. But once you have that degree in your hand,the world seems different,trust me. Your doing the right thing at this point. But please put more thought into your actions because there's always consequence's. Put everyting you have into your baby & your education. The reward is like nothing else. Best of luck little one.|`|ECegmuCRaa	its not fair, i beg my wife everyday to give me children, i want 7 of them..... she's not ready and i accept that, you just throw them away? babies are beautiful every way shape and form, what if your mother aborted you, that wouldn't be very nice, now would it? but you can have two abortions? find a non-married man, and use contraceptives ( spermicide is the best from what ive found, no plastic bag in the way, but i still want my 4 girls and 3 boys, and i want to make sure that I'm at least licensed to be a registered nurse when i start, and with my 3rd kid, i want to have my medical degree. that my listener is called family planning ( with success )!|`|HwcQYXxoaa	I'm glad you had the courage to put this type of situation on here, knowing a lot of these people were going to dog you for it.  Also I'm glad you'll ignore the negative responses.  Most of these people are pretty ignorant or clueless anyway.<br>  <br>  Secondly, I think you should get another abortion (since you sound like you are already going to anyway).  Focus on yourself right now, because if you get a good education...that leads to a good job, you'll be able to afford/support multiple children--and then you can do as you wish.  But for now, another kid would "put you out of business."<br>  <br>  Lastly, (and this is common sense) STOP having sex without a condom!  Have protected sex all you want--I don't even mind if it's with married men, just stop having unprotected sex.  I know it feels better, blah blah blah, but do you really want to put yourself into this situation a third time?  I'm not accusing you of being immoral, but having multiple abortions isn't good for your body or your wallet.  Just stop being careless about condoms..<br>  <br>  Plus:  You could get prescription birth control that would allow you to have condom-free sex.  Get smart girl.|`|UfhE3k1baa	Well, first off I just gotta say, yahoo answers pregnancy section is FILLED with expectant mothers and women trying very hard to become mothers, so unless you are in the mood for negative comments this is probably not the best place to talk about abortion...twice. Second, this isn't really a question, it is a statement. Again, do you want negative feedback? I am going to be polite and not leave any, I am sure you know what most of us are thinking. But a bit of advice, since this is the 3rd time you have found yourself pregant before you were ready, maybe you should consider birth control? LIke the implant or the shot, something you don't have to worry about everyday. Also, maybe you should stop sleeping with married men. Not only is it demeaning to you, but how would you feel if your husband was sleeping with a teenager?|`|dCIi9qf5aa	I"ll tell you what they told me. Dont use abortions as a contraceptive. How could you care more about his family than he does. Listen what the two of you are doing is going to be found out. Whether you know about it or not. In addition you deserve better than being the other woman. If you are attractive to him then there is someone out there who is not married and can and will love you without destroying his family's lives. You deserve your own man.Think. Where can your relationship go? No where. You'll always be on the side and his family will always come first. From experience you have no idea what he thinks about you. Especially having already having a child. Believe me what he thinks about you is not loving.Further, you want to play but you dont want to pay. Get out now because your feelings will only increase an it will be all the harder to be without him. end this relationship now. Don't discuss it with him,just stop seeing him and dont answer any of his communications. I bet you he will stop calling and go on with his life as if nothing happened.Don't you know most people meet their husbands in college? Its time to be mature and start caring about yourself. What you plan to do is not what you should do but what you want to do. You dont want to own up to your responsiblity and are going to kill your helpless(who cant say no) flesh and blood because you are not mature and dont want to own up to the responsibility.

ggfE4rlvaa	No, cheating is NEVER okay. However you could talk to your partner about finding a sperm donor. Maybe he will be willing to try that. Turkey Baster FTW!|`|VHHis05Naa	No.  I have a lot of respect for my husband and would want to go on the journey with him and not start my child's life on a pack of lies.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	Never! That's a sick thought! If you'd sink that low just to have a baby, then you certainly aren't thinking of alternative options. What happens if your partner suspects cheating and demands a paternity test and finds out the baby isn't his. Then you're stuck with a baby and NO daddy! You're obviously not thinking too clearly. If something is "wrong" with your partner, then maybe you should consider IVF or artificial insemination. Cheating is NEVER a good option. Also, you say there's nothing wrong with you, but there clearly IS something wrong with you. If you'd think it, you'd do it! Your man does NOT deserve someone that selfish! How do you think he would feel WHEN he finds out? Goodness... Grow a brain!<br>  <br>  EDIT: It sounds to me like you have S**T for brains and you're proud of the fact that you're a cheating, lying, B**CH bag S*UT! You don't deserve a good man!|`|NwVBautHaa	no i dont think cheating iswrong and it isnt  the answer maybe its not meant for u guys to have a baby ever take time out to think about that ..i was with some one for 6 years and never ever fell prego and after being single for a lil while i ended up getting into another relationship and fell prego 4 months into our relationship maybe god just wants to make sure its right doesnt matter how much he worships u u shouldnt abuse ur relationship for ur self fish  needs its different if u guys discuss it and hes ok with it then ok but have him try the male fertility test they sell them in cvs and a few other places im not sure what its called but its with the ovulation kits and tests|`|AA10057011	No|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	NO. i would tell him|`|2WWEn2mZaa	What a horrible, awful, dishonest thing to do. If you love your husband you could never be that dishonest, to him or a future child. Further more it's easier to test a man than a woman to see if anything is wrong. So why would anyone even think nothing is wrong with the woman and not the man? Just because a woman can have a baby one year does not mean that 4 years later nothing is wrong with her.|`|HXh7u0lEaa	I don't think I could keep that kind of secret and I would not risk it. Have you discussed with him about going to see someone about this so he can be checked too? If it is his problem maybe he would be ok with IVF using some elses sperm. I suppose it depends on your man and on whether you could keep a lie like that. I think the most important issue here is  the dangers of catching a STD by having unprotected sex would you risk that?|`|eya1WDS4aa	No i would not. I love my husband to much to cheat in him he is my one and only.<br>  if i did do this i wouldnt be able to live with myself. Their are other ways of getting pregnant without cheating.<br>  <br>  wow i feel sorry for your husband. What a poor guy to get stuck with someone like you. you dont love him enough, if you did you wouldnt have cheated and be lying about the kids.... your poor husband he deserves better.|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	thats horrible. first of all why would you cheat on a man that you love and want to have a child with. and second why would you pretend that the child is his if it is not? can you imagine how heart broken he would be? grow up before you even think about bringing a baby into this world.|`|nbSp469Waa	Nope, I don't care if I didn't like my husband very much or not, I would never make a man believe that a child was his when it really wasn't.  Eventually the truth would come out.|`|jS6Qkj0faa	umm NO. sneaky things like that have a habit of biting you in the butt later down the track.|`|gkXLT9Z9aa	i honestly wouldn't even think to do that. that's horrible.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	No, but I would adopt.|`|op3t8OtVaa	Flat out no. There are other methods of obtaining a child (like adoption!) and I would never cheat on my partner and then claim that the baby was his, I love him to much to do that and I still have my self respect.|`|Pfge6j7Aaa	How can you ask that???
1z3C0R2Vaa	i an sooo sorry to hear about your loss but with God help you will  soon carry your baby to term good luck and lot of blessing........|`|qfSKgxDsaa	they will test his sperm and look at your eggs and cervix and see what the issue is...it will go fairly quickly and they have lots of good suggestions...don't worry|`|UfhE3k1baa	I really do not know much about this, however I did want to wish you all the luck in the world and to tell you to hang in there! Every pain you go through will make that baby that much more special.
uMIvRRjoaa	Congrats on 2 &1/2 years of nursing! Ignore the ignorant answers. (FYI Nursing is beneficial for tooth and mouth formation.) <br>  <br>  You probably still have plenty of milk, but her latch is changing as she grows and probably your nips are getting their sensation back (I went through this myself, as well as having increased sensitivity around AF). Two of the most effective weaning strategies at this age are: don't offer, don't refuse and reducing duration. Used together they gradually reduce nursing sessions. Plus they can be educational! When she wants to nurse tell her you're going to count to 10 or 20 or sing the ABC's, then you'll be done nursing for now. If she's really not ready (and you'll know) to stop at that point you can do it again. You can count/sing as slow or fast as you need to for your comfort level. SHe'll gradually give up sessions if you keep her involved in activities (my daughter dropped far more sessions/nursed less during summer when were busy). She will wean eventually- I promise you. If you gently encourage her it will be sooner than it would have been though.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	One extremely simple step. You won't even have to write it down.<br>  <br>  Stop putting your nipples in her mouth.<br>  <br>  You're welcome.|`|8oKazGVGaa	tell her no shes old enough to eat and drink or go away for a couple of days so she has to eat|`|umGi6gTcaa	I'm litteraly in the same boat as you, one seat over. =)<br>  Here's how I cut down on nursing and how I hope to move along her weaning. I'd let her do it herself but I honestly don't think she will.<br>  <br>  Figure out how many times she nurses and how many times she might actually need it. Like a nip in the morning, a little for nap and then for bedtime. IMO that's what you have to wittle it down to. My daughter knows that we don't nurse outside. So if we're at the park she won't even bother to ask. Sometimes while visiting family she'll sign for it or lead me to the bedroom but that is rare.<br>  <br>  Distract, distract, distract!!! Play with her until you can't take anymore, lol. Tell her she has to wait 1-5 minutes then if she forgets don't remind her. When she remembers if you think she needs it then nurse, otherwise tell her 5 more minutes.<br>  <br>  Look for things that might set her off. Like I can not put my daughter on my lap facing me, she automaticly wants to nurse every time. If I lay down on the bed I have to lay on my stomach and distract her or she'll want to nurse.<br>  <br>  If you really have such a low supply, then is it possible to go away for 2 days so your milk can dry up and she can detox?<br>  <br>  Give her lots of attention, read, color, tickles and cuddles to make up for no longer nursing as much.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Congrats for nursing so long!<br>  <br>  Don't listen to the people who tell you to stop, chances are they didn't nurse their kids or if they did stopped at 6 months because they didn't want to any more. If they nursed for a year then they would understand better.|`|1795e9adbd644bbbce946795cd052957aa	I found that as my daughter became older, as long as she continued nursing regularly, there was enough milk to keep it from being painful.  Is she nursing on a sporatic schedule?  Or, could you be pregnant?  Or have thrush?<br>  <br>  At age 2 1/2 she is already well on her way to weaning, especially if you're not making much milk.  The lack of milk will be it's own deterrent.  <br>  <br>  If you want her to wean on her own, just be patient.  She will.|`|tluojTpSaa	there is an extremely easy answer, but you have to be very strong.<br>    It isnt good for the teeth to be breastfeeding or bottlefeeding at that age.  The child needs to get nutrition in food.  They dont need breast milk at that age. You need to just stop cold turkey.  <br>  I always think these questions are funny, because the answer is right there...just stop doing it!!!<br>  The toddler cries?  Offer a drink of cows milk in a real big-girl cup(or big boy cup).  Your kid isnt going to suffer thirst or anything, he/she has just gotten way to used to it, and the longer it goes on the harder and harder it will be!  <br>  Just try to sneak it out of your routine!!!  and try to sneak in milk and/or water or juice in instead.  If the child gets fussy, just change the subject, like"  Who wants me to read them a book?!"  or omething fun.<br>  It should be easy!|`|a7MPxSWYaa	I just wanted to say congratulation on your 2 1/2 breastfeeding years. You know you have given your daughter the best nutrition start you can give here when nourishing for more than 2 years as World Health Organization recommends.<br>  <br>  You could try offering your daughter a fruit or read here a book. My son loves fruits so that work well for me.<br>  <br>  I would not put something with a bad taste on my breasts, I want my children to think positively about the breastfeeding and I don't want to make the last breastfeeding-memory be a bad one.|`|91db67023fc6e1186360fd9330d83699aa	That is the only way you can stop her.Or something she is afraid of you can point her out that.2  1/2 is quite a big age for b/f.My son b/f for 2 years and i thought it was too much.It is because they get habit of sucking nipple.My son was scared of vaccums as he does not like loud sounds so i used a hand vaccum to push him away whenever he asked for milk.And within a week he stopped.|`|Mbgck2ifaa	Ignore the people who tell you she's waay to old to breastfeed, it's your choice to decide when she is too old/ to young for things. Anyways, the way i got my daughter to stop breast feeding was to feed her more regular food, and a lot of water to drink, she'd get full and wouldn't have any room  for milk. Give her filling foods like carbs, starches and proteins. I used cherrios, that baby gerber cereal and hotdogs cut into little pieces. Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  maybe you can help me with my question<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219214509AAWQ6ZV">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|F8KmTbqjaa	My friend just weaned her 2 year old and it was HARD for her.  You just have to cut back slowly and explain that Mommy is done nursing.  Just reassure her and cut back slowly.  The good part is that you can explain to her and she might understand, verses weaning a 1 year old.  Tell her that Mommy's milk is going away because she is a big girl now.  Good Luck.|`|OHfZFR31aa	She's not looking for milk but for comfort. You can still cuddle with her, but tell her that mommy doesn't have any more milk for her because she is a big girl. But that you will still cuddle with her before she takes a nap or goes to sleep.
LQuCb310aa	Playing with lettters. kids learn best thru the natural element of play when they are so little. Try magnets. Coloring a big A with a picture of an Apple...D with a dog and so on,. its much easier to remember something if it is related to something that actually matters to you...maybe m for mommy...The letter of their name with a picture of themselves....stuff like that.... just like numbers...same thing.|`|3c8GsRvUaa	looking at abc books <br>  written them|`|nbSp469Waa	I bought a book that had the ABC's in it, and we would read it a few times a day and every night before she went to bed.  I also taught her how to wright each one as I was teaching her to recognize them.|`|tluojTpSaa	The best way ever is to do nothing!!  If your child is not in school, why dont you lay off and just play with her/him?  thats what i did, and all of my kids are great readers!  Childrens natural curiosity will come out and they will ask.  That is when you should help.  Perhaps with an ABC puzzle.  My kids loved playing with the Lap Frog fridge magnet letter toy.  They get to put the letters in, and it tells the letter, plus the sounds that letter makes.<br>    I have seen children whose parents push them to learn things, and tose children are the ones who don't want to try to learn at all!<br>  However, if your child is of a preschool age, then i suggest the same things as above, only you have to be the one to initiate play, such as with a puzzle.|`|8oKazGVGaa	get a colourful poster every kit likes colour i had the sesame street one where it would have the capital letter and lower case with a character from the show next to the letter but i remembered it from the colours|`|9QF6GGyiaa	<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2283598_teach-child-recognize-letters-alphabet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2283598_teach-ch...</a>|`|ike3ZGSqaa	my son will be 3 (on monday) and we use the spongy letters in the bath but also we give him 'alphabites' (photo shapes) but let him pick which ones he wants out of the bag before going into the oven and try and get him to tell us the letters.|`|bDPULhpaaa	Say the Abc's with her showing her an object that begins with that same letter. So she can put the two together and maybe starting saying them.
P0Fjh59Eaa	it is possible. implantation usually happens between 8-10 days of fertilization. implantation can cause spotting, discomfort etc. but then so can just regular hormones from gearing up to have your period...esp the bloated feeling and the hunger.<br>  <br>  only thing to do is wait on the early preg test. if it comes back negative but she still doesn't get her period at her normal time she can check again.|`|1EB7fbxpaa	I didn't think you could show signs that quickly..I usually get like that before my period..Good luck though.
HXh7u0lEaa	I know discharge increases through pregnancy, I am 24 weeks and have white kind of discharge and no way near enough to soak through. Why don't you call your Dr/midwife and get some advice, it's probably normal as everyone is different but at least it will put your mind at rest.
5yIph0u5aa	I know there are ones that combine video and sound. I am a nanny and they are great you put a camera on the wall and can watch your baby on a little monitor that you carry around its like a normal monitor. You can get them at babies r us.|`|I7Sd9qd6aa	I know the angel care has the alarm and sound, but no video, but if you are getting a mat I swear by the BabysenseV, I had one for my preemie and it was a godsend, I just added a simple sound moniter and life was fabulous. I think you will have to combine a couple different ones, but it will get really spendy, the video moniters are 100+ and so are the moniter mats as well.
rAD0mL7Saa	Me too. Hence bagless vaccuums are the only way to go. Any one, what-ever. Any vaccuum with a HEPA filter is fantastic. You only need to replace the filters every six months.

They're all good|`|AOvtRBU9aa	Costco has a very cheap dyson for like 200 dollars if that's not too out of your price range. i think it's cheap since we bought ours for 599 (the animal) when it first came out.

Py1oiwYQaa	we posted our profile on www.parentprofiles.com when we were trying to adopt (3 yrs ago) and that is how our daughter's mom found us. There are a lot of profiles but I'm not a huge fan of the site because they have some rules I don't agree with (only married couples, no singles etc). However it is a decent place to start looking, and they have couples from all over the country. Also many agencies post their "waiting families". Our agency was in san francisco (adoptionconnection.org). <br>  <br>  If you do decide to contact a couple or an agency don't let them pressure you. It is a really tough decision and you need to take your time to make it. Also all the final decisions should be made after the birth and until you sign the relinquishment you can change your mind. It is really your decision to make. There are some high pressure people out that that will try to coerce you into making a decision, but there are also some very good people working in adoption (from my experience) who want you to make the right decision. The way our agency put it is that it is in everyone's interest to make sure it is the right decision for the natural mom, since otherwise the adoption may fall through. However i know some people that advised us to "do whatever we could to convince a mom to place her child with us" (not from our agency). This is definitely not what we did, but some people think like this so be careful.<br>  <br>  All the best to you, whatever you decide.|`|iVcaB9h7aa	The agency we used 10 years ago stands firm in their commitment to open adoptions.  They also have a very extensive approval process.  Here's a link to their approved potential parents: <a href="http://www.cradle.org/adoption/search.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.cradle.org/adoption/search.ph...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  As others have mentioned, open adoptions aren't legally enforceable.  The APs are honor-bound to keep the adoption open, but not all do.  <br>  <br>  You might consider looking for an agency in your area that has the following qualifications:<br>  <br>  are non-profit<br>  are non-denominational<br>  are COA (Council on Accreditation) certified<br>  are Hague certified<br>  are a member of the Child Welfare League<br>  have extensive approval processes for potential parents<br>  <br>  <br>  Let your fingers start to Google and see if you can find feedback on them. Talk to friends, neighbors, local Facebook groups or anywhere else you can think of to learn how they treat expectant women or women who have relinquished.<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you decide to do.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Hard times come and go.  Adoption is forever.  This baby needs his/her mother.  You should really talk to someone at a state agency about getting some help.  That way your little family can stay together.<br>  <br>  Open adoptions are not enforceable.  They use this to coerce women into thinking that they will have contact with their babies, but then the A-parents can pull out at any time without telling you.  Pre-birth matching is also another tactic adoption agencies use to coerce babies from mothers.  They'll tell you how much the couple wants a baby, YOUR baby, then if you change your mind, they'll tell you how much you've hurt them.<br>  <br>  Please think very hard.  Times change.  Money comes and goes.  Relationships end and begin again.  Giving up this baby means you'll never know for sure where they are, how they are doing, who is taking care of them.  YOU are what this baby needs.  You can give them something that no one else can give.|`|kf7XLE8kaa	Open adoption is not legally enforceable.  The adoptive parents could cut off ALL contact with you, and you would have no recourse whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Hard times are temporary.  Adoption is permanent.  Your baby needs you.  And s/he doesn't care whether  you're having a hard time right now - all s/he needs is YOU.  Your love, your warmth, and your boob are all she needs to sustain her.  And those are free.  There are many programs available to help you out.  Please, look into them.  Your baby needs you, not a stranger.|`|QTVUkLUNaa	You sound as if your in a real mess, i think you need to talk to someone about your situation, something no one answering your question now knows about, so it's dificult to advise, adoption may seen like the answer now but it's a permanent choice and something you may regret, your mid wife may be able help or advise on someone to talk to.|`|Afoabqblaa	Keep your kid.  You made it, you find a way to fulfill your obligation to it.|`|7z6BWoESaa	first of all I am sending a big *hug* I personally placed a child for adoption, I went through a local agency , I was able to go through some files and read about the people, we did not meet and I didnt have pictures of them. but I was able to pick from reading profiles, I was able to call the agency at any time during his growing up ask how he was doing, they would contact the parents and I recieved an update. It is a hard desicion but an extremely loving one. it worked out great for me but contact you local social service for information on the local branch that does adoptions, good luck!|`|DjlKqGDCaa	honestly you should keep your baby... but if you have to do it, go through a local place. online is NOT the safest place to do that. because of hackers and weird people that could do harm to your baby.
lTUXdbCTaa	Tell your doctor the truth. They can help you. If you really want to know, that's the best way to find out. If you're up to it, tell your mom too. I know it's tough, but you just need to be honest about it, don't be ashamed, specially if you already learned from your mistake. What happens, happens. And sometimes, you just have to pay for the consequences to learn and grow.|`|4GnzqUxzaa	Well if you haven't had a period since November they should be able to detect HCG in your pee and your blood.

Those are really the only options you have.<br>  <br>  ETA: the person below that said if you have done several tests and they were negative, you are not pregnant, that is WRONG. I was having many symptoms of pregnancy, yet 4 tests came out negative. I went to my OB to find out why my period was so late and all my tests were coming out negative and then found out I had been pregnant all along. The person that said to tell the DR, that was good advise.|`|SJPfjaS0aa	Even if you dont drink water, if there's a baby in there, they will see it so dont drink any water and if anything, they will send you back to the waiting room to drink if they need you too.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to take another pregnancy test before your scan. At this point, if you havent had a period since November and you are pregnant then it will be positive. I would tell your mom before you go in there. If its negative then you can be a little relieved and hope that everything is ok with your ultrasound.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|kRQDm9Oiaa	If you have done several test and they reveal negative then you are not pregnant.

Zr1eNX64aa	I would give it time. Of course I don't know the clod, but it sounds to me like he has some maturing to do too. If you Truly believe deep down that he isn't a total loser swine then you should stick with him and stand by him. Don't just sit there and let him be a total punk either though. Tell him you need him to be there more.<br>  <br>  I was still really immature when my wife was pregnant and I drank too much and just wasn't nearly as supportive as I should have been. I really regret that now. We went through some really rocky times during her pregnancy and for a good while after but we are both so happy that we stuck it out and she tells me all the time that I am the best father and husband she could ever dream of (which is nice :) <br>  <br>  So, if he's anything like me, he'll get the idea eventually and be all he can be. I think for us guys it can just be really tough to cope with it when we're not ready to come out of 'bachelor mode' when we suddenly step on the landmine of responsibility and sometimes it takes us awhile to pull our head out of there. Good Luck!|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	Welcome to a mothers world.  You play a very important role in the family now, even though the father does as well.  Being pregnant is a happy and wonderful time.  Don't worry about what you can't do because you will be able to do those things again someday.  You cannot change people.  Think about what you say before you do bring it up, if you do at all.  This sounds like a very common relationship.  Just think of that baby for now and take care of yourself.  Everything will fall into place.|`|0v7Msiznaa	im seeing a lot of answers that are not really nice.  I would sit him down and tell him how you feel.

Rather he was hanging out or not he has to be more aware of what he's doing  and how he's doing and whom he's doing it with. He's got to live for that child u are carrying . He needs to grow up and be a man about everything and stop running the streets. He may have the fear everyone feels when there having a baby for the first time. If he's acting out because he's fear full and clueless .Then u and him need to sit down over dinner and talk about the changes that need to be made and if he's gonna settle down and man up.Especially when u have the baby.|`|8RLGcshUaa	When I was pregnant, I felt the same way.

You're just jealous that he can smoke and drink and you can't now.  BEcause he does these things does not make him a loser at all.

Just take responsibility for your child and if he decides to step up and be a man then great!|`|mcehFtY0aa	He is acting like this with a new baby on the way.

I don't have a lot of friends, so maybe I'm just being clingy?"  I feel the same way about mine! I would just wait and see what happens after the baby is born.  Give it a month after, and see what he does with himself and see if he starts acting like he cares.  I'm sure its different for guys because they aren't actually carrying the child, so its not so real to him.  I miss kickin it too, and I think I get jealous, because i don't have many friends like he does and I just get to chill here pregnant.  Just wait and see.  When you're baby comes out, you will know what the right thing to do is.

That's usually the tell-tale sign.<br>  Another thing, you don't start urinating more often until you are 6-8 weeks along.  Maybe you're just hungry, have you ever thought of that? <br>  It sounds more like a cold then it does pregnancy.  You are probably overreacting, as most girls do when they think they're pregnant.  I'm not saying there's no chance that you're not pregnant, you should take another test.  I also have a question, if you took the pregnancy test too early, and you knew that there was a chance it could be wrong, why would you go out and drink just the slightest bit?  That's what harms a baby most in the beginning stages of pregnancy.  Just saying.
PYcJ52m6aa	Unfourtunately it is very common and well- just stinks! (Pun intended) I reccommend you get a copy of the Jenny McCarthy book Belly Laughs or The Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy and read thier takes on it. At least then you learn how to handle the embarassment! You also CAN take bean-o before all meals to help control it but stay as far away from Mylanta or Gas X as you can as these can cause an unsafe restriction in the blood vessels.  Following the flatulence will be the heartburn- buy a supersize bottle of Zantac 75 now so you are ready!

OTFZtGCaaa	I just did an orientation for opening up a day care center last week (but decided not to follow through with it for numerous reasons).<br>  <br>  Your situation is not uncommon.  Without criticizing the child, you can honestly tell the parents that it turns out that their child needs more attention than you’re able to give without having to take it away from the other children.  Let them know you have the well-being of their child in mind and you feel that if staying in your care (which is not an option as you have responsibility to the other parent’s children) it might inhibit proper development.  If you do it gently and respectfully (I’d certainly avoid the word ‘handicapped’, ‘off’, ‘underdeveloped’, etc. – as no parent wants to hear this … assessments like these should be left to health professionals), the parents - after possibly getting a little upset/hurt initially - should appreciate it.  <br>  <br>  It is not unlikely that this little boy was rejected at the one or other home/day care already and/or will be rejected in the future for the very same reasons you’re pointing out.  If the parents are not aware of the problem (yet), they will be very soon because they’ll (hopefully) get the same response from other providers … unless someone who doesn’t care as much as you do keeps this poor little guy in an exersaucer (which are illegal in day care centers anyways).<br>  <br>  Do not lie by saying you can’t have that many children (as it was suggested by one member).  First, you should have known upfront, and secondly it makes you look really bad if they find out that’s not true (which that’s easy to find out).  The same member also made a good point – she would want to know from the day care if there were any concerns.<br>  <br>  If your conversation with the parents goes over well, below are three resources that should have solutions for children that need extra attention (this option might be more expensive, but they might not have any other choice except of themselves staying at home with him).<br>  ? Department of Social Services/Licensing Office, San Bruno – 650-266-8843<br>  ? Child Care Coordinating Council, San Mateo – 650-655-6770<br>  ? Children’s Council of SF – 415-276-2900<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|hQMiSlvMaa	He is only 9 months for God sakes.  Obviously you are not a professional.  I would never leave my kids with you.

Then tell them that you know of another great sitter and offer to watch him for another week until they find another nursery.<br>  I would really try to avoid anything that says it's their or their child's fault for this - that could turn nasty. <br>  <br>  Sometimes a white lie is the best way to do things, especially to avoid hurting feelings or causing a scene.|`|G9ywiLqvaa	didn't you interview the mother of the child before you took on the job?  if you did, then she should've told you her child was a little 'off', and you would've known what you're currently facing.  <br>  but since this all seems like a surprise to you, then simply admit to the mother what you just told us and apologize that you cannot make the arrangement work any longer.  <br>  yes, you need to apologize.  after all, you did accept the job and now you're backing out from it, and the mom did trust you to be able to cope with it.<br>  <br>  yes, this will hurt her feelings but it's more professional to tell her what you think about her child.  she has a right to know.|`|1uvrkDWNaa	Be honest.

q0JTN9QAaa	You should have at least 2 for each day of the week.  It can be stressful at best to be a first time parent and until you make the adjustment your not always going to feel like washing bottles so you need to make sure you have lots of extras incase you get slack on the bottle washing cause your little guy is not going to listen when you say wait just a sec while I wash your bottle.<br>  <br>  Even with my wife and I taking turns when I got home from work it was hard  I unlike some men would take him as soon as I got my after work shower and kept him most of the night till bed time or I would pick up the house work that needed done.  I would do the one she told me because she had been home all day and deserved to pick what I did and what she did so as to keep the house from being her prison.<br>  <br>  But even with both of us hitting hard the bottle washing got kinda slack because you have to handwash them and we usually boiled them after they were used for a whole day. <br>  <br>  You have to respect the single parents I don't know how I got through it with my wife there every night.|`|fc9ecb5a900817a0bcf8f6fa3590baf3aa	I would just go with the 4 oz and 8oz bottles.

Then you are only sterilizing once a day.|`|aTyNsdApaa	If you feel like buying a bunch of bottles I recommend 12 count of 4 oz bottles and then 12 8 oz bottles. I would skip the 3.5 oz. My baby went from 2 oz to 4 really quick. I personally just went straight to 13 of the 8 oz bottles and then just switched out the nipples depending on what flow my baby was on. I like having 13 so I can just do one dish washer load a day or every other day, or my baby can stay the day and night at grandmas. The Dr. Browns are annoying to clean but better for your baby gas wise. My baby didn't have a problem with the cheap bottles from Wal- mart so that's what I bought. They also come in the 4 oz. and the 9 oz. I like them because they are cute, bpa free, easy to clean, cheap, and my baby can throw them on the floor or loose them. Most of the moms I know like Dr. Browns for the new borns but ditched them and went cheap when their baby hit 4-6 months. So you might want to buy just what you need for your new born needs.|`|8EHYNBNtaa	I am a mother to a cute 4 year old boy. He's lactose intolerant, so I had to bottle feed him soy milk.

I got a conception date of April 6th BUT that is an estimate and many factors go into it such as the length of a woman's cycle. The dates of wedding and when she might have gotten pregnant are far too close to be making any judgments. Simply put; it is very likely she got pregnant on her wedding night.|`|Szxce0uUaa	no i got pregnant mid march and my due date was dec. 20th so she is only a week behind me|`|PqSxN71Baa	I believe she is lying. They would have had to do it some time in March..i believe|`|1CryEnb3aa	I put in her delivery date and it guesstimated her conception date as April 4th.  So, this is pretty close.  All depends on where she was at in her cycle.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	Um NO it is true. Most women don't give birth on there estimated due date. They probably delivered her because the baby was ful term
ByedZiqmaa	this story is identical to mine only they refused my beta's.  i went to the er yesterday (i live in germany) and they told me that it was normal even though i have had 3 previous losses.  when you get your next beta done please send me an email and let me know the out come.  there is alot more to my story too but i dont want to get into to much detail since you have your own stuff going on but it sounds like your going through the same thing.  i am 4 weeks and 4days (approx) right now and the dr told me yesterday that i am 5 weeks and 4 days. which i know is incorrect since i use OPK's.. anyway please let me know your outcome.|`|AA10631745	I have two children, First pregnancy was normal in every way.

B9KwqnuDaa	Breastfeeding in public is not a huge deal for me. Most people don't even notice!|`|IkkYOehSaa	I have never in the 10 1/2 month that I have been breastfeeding my daughter had anyone ever notice or comment on me breastfeeding in public. At first it made me nervous, but I got over it and got really skilled with it. I never even got anything close to a weird glance.|`|bc9inzicaa	My son is seven weeks and i have not breast feed in public much; however, the few times that i have, it was okay.  Just made sure to cover myself well.  There has been a few times where i was at family gatherings and would take the baby to the car and feed him there (with a cover thrown over him to cover me until he latched on then just made sure my shirt minimized any exposed skin.-Could not feed in the house because of so many people coming and going from all the rooms--even the bedrooms).|`|lKsIKKm2aa	I don't have to very often, but when I do, I don't think anyone really notices...except for maybe other breastfeeding mothers! <br>  I don't really care though if someone does notice.. I'm just feeding my baby! And I cover up of course. Don't feel like people are judging you.. I know it's hard not to feel self concious. I did with my 1st little one.<br>  <br>  Happy Breastfeeding!!!=)|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I don't have a problem with breast feeding in public. It's 100% natural, so I don't understand how some mothers can be embarrassed or think it's inappropriate.|`|u94HOVz7aa	i always felt to exposed this is one of the reasons i chose not to continue to breastfeed among others.|`|7TYuCafDaa	I breast feed in public all the time. The shirts that I usually wear have a loose low neck line that I can pull aside when I need to feed my daughter. Also, If I happen to be wearing a tighter shirt or one that does not have a low neckline than I wear a cami underneath so I can pull up my shirt on top, pull down either side of the cami and feed my baby. I suggest getting a light weight shaw to throw over your shoulder to give yourself some privacy if you are a little shy about anyone in public noticing.|`|AOvtRBU9aa	I breast feed in public for the first time last weekend. I had no other choice because there wasn't a designated area and our car was too far away. It was pouring so I didn't want to run that far to my car. It was business as usual. No one really looked at me. We were covered with her baby blanket which was enough to be discreet. I caught a guy looking at us and smiling but not in a creepy way. He had a toddler with him. I figure he was just reminiscing or something. I would do it again. I'm not sure if I would ever do it without covering up. It was a lot easier than finding a place to warm up a bottle. My daughter has to have warm breast milk. She'll refuse cold milk. I was too lazy to defrost and pack milk, bottles etc.|`|lKXtfYFxaa	I was subconscious at first but after awhile I realize no one even notice.  I always used a nursing wrap.

rFtKFp03aa	I have triplets.. so I am hauling babies over the seats and through our Yukon and across the middle and blah blah blah.. it is hard! i know! <br>  I use to watch my nephew before I had the babies 9 months ago.. and I always had him in the middle and it is a pain.. I know.. and he was 13 months... heavy guy.. but I still did it.. because it was a small car and was safer... <br>  <br>  The side door is always so tempting..|`|AA10982164	I often put my granddaughter next to the door in the back seat, never the front. The car seat set more stable in the side seat of our car.<br>  <br>  May I suggest using the passenger side, you can see them better than if they were directly behind you.<br>  <br>  I am aware that the middle is the safest, but sometimes it just doesn't work, however, never put a rear facing seat in the front seat of a car. That means never, it can be dangerous for the child!|`|bc9inzicaa	My son is seven weeks and fourteen pounds so i completely understand your issue since I have a 06 honda accord and he is placed in the middle as well.  Poor guy, sometimes i feel like i am banging him around in the car seat as i am getting him in or out of the car.  <br>  <br>  I have been tempted to put him in the side seats but because of safety issues, i have not made the change.  My husband also refuses to put him at the side as well for the same reason since we life in California and there are lots of big cars on the road.  Also, my husband gets the baby in or out for the most part--i've probably done it about six or seven times only.   For now, my baby is in the middle and should we have another child, my husband is adamant that we purchase a SUV.|`|jYPeis3Saa	we keep our son in the middle always. he is almost 16 months and about 25lbs, hes a chunky monkey and heavy and can be hard for me to put him in his car seat i nthe middle, but its the safest so thats where he goes. <br>  <br>  when we have anpother child, they'll each be on the sides since you cant have 2 babies in the middle at the same time|`|zuIBmNTOaa	My son just turned 3 mos and I had him in the middle until a month ago.

Now I have 2boys and of course they are the only place they fit.. The sides! So I am of course the safest driver I can be when they are with me;)|`|mmBwNHcbaa	It is recommended that children sit in the very middle of any vehicle. If he is getting to heavy to lift then you may just want to change seats. A lot of infants out grow their carriers well before a year old. I recommend that you get a convertible seat (one that can be forward or rear facing). You can pick one up for as little as $50 at your local Walmart. Remember that no one seat is bad, just bad installations.  For any further questions on car seats and Car Safety. Please check out this website.

I work up a sweat sometimes since he is a good twenty pounds so I know what you are going through, but I still do it because I know it is the safest spot, my 5 year old and my 3 year old occupy the side seats.  Oh and I like your baby's name, My little guy (who is 5 months old) is named Nikolas.|`|fUvB4MGWaa	I have my five week old son's carseat on the side seat. It actually wouldn't fit in the middle seat at the proper angle :( If he is getting heavy, then by all means put the carseat on the side seat! You won't be doing anything wrong as a mother, or endangering to him. :)|`|I7Sd9qd6aa	The middle is safer, but our carseat will only fit on the side and that is with the seat all the way forward, our car went from 5 person to 2.5, lol.

S4Q6jO9waa	Rick Y, dont bother with your wills solicitor. They are probably good at what they do, but you need to see someone who has experience suing for hospital negligence.<br>  <br>  We suffered to because of a hospital in Sydney. Our child has brain damage because the hospital screwed up her treatment. Our bub had dangerous jaundice levels and they missed it and didnt start treatment until too late. She had kernicterus and had fits and then brain damage.<br>  <br>  Our local solictor told us he could not do the case becausr you need specialist lawyer who knows medical negligence laws. We asked him to recommend someone to us, and he asked some barristers, and then gave us a list of names of the lawyers in sydney who are good in this area. So we made a fews appointment s and saw a couplke of them and then decided which one we liked.<br>  <br>  I can tell which lawyers he told us to see. This is the list he gave us 6 years ago, so i dont know if these lawyers are still around, but you can try contacvting the Law Society NSW and they also can help you find a lawyer. This is the list of sydney medical lawyers- Bill Madden, David Hirsch, Tina Foukas, Karen stott, Fiona Read, Terry Stern. Firms- Cashman and partners, mclaughln riordan, charlton sherman, Slater Gordan.<br>  We saw Tina- lovely person and veery clever lawyer.<br>  Our case took years to finish but that is because the hospital lawyers fought really hard to make things difficult. But we won in the end, and our child has comepnsation money in a trust fund to take care of her needs for her disabilites.<br>  <br>  A warning- any lawyer who promises you that you will win lots of money etc before they even start investigations in your case , is not good. You need someone honest to lok at all your case and investigate it. Our lawyer told us from the start just because something bad happened to our baby doesnt mean it was negligence and you dont automaticly get money for it. It doesnt work that way. These cases are hard and can be emotionally hard battle to fight. So make sure you find lawyer you are comfortable with and who you trust. <br>  <br>  I feel for you cause we have been through it. But please know you can survive if you get the right help and support.|`|q0JTN9QAaa	Too bad your not in the good old USA if you sue a doctor here you will win even if you don't deserve too.  I am sorry for what happened to you.  The best way to go about it would be to call each local law office and check with them.  You will do better with a local lawyer than one from out of town because he will know the hospital, doctors, and judges.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	Why don't you go public with this.  Contact ACA or today tonight.  And in the meantime contact all the lawyers you can.  Some lawyers will say they won't help because they think they will lose the case and they think it would be a waste of time.  I am sorry to hear about what happened.  I hope your little one will be ok.  Take care|`|RJpF9ci5aa	sadly yes, it is hard and if it was not an emergency which sadly in allmost every laybour at some stage something seems not right but commonly things go fine by themselfs. i think if this doctor was not working i would assume he was on call which means if they need him he comes in? it depends where he lives, what time off dfay or night? it is very sad you have my complete sympathy.. i just mean he has his ways has a doctor to get completely out of it.. i tryed suing also i had my last baby they told me he was missing an arm and had diwn syndrom they induced me extremely early only to descover my baby was completely healthy exept the struggles off premature lungs ect.. i heamoraged also it was severe a doctor came in also about an hour late he did an internal and during that my partner started pushing the doctor and swearing.. the doctor had no gloves on and was doing an internal... hospitals are sneaky and get out off so many things especially in sydney.. the harsh truth is not many lawyers would be willing to stand up to a hospital.. in the end there's no point... try bell and partners.
LCBW8EEOaa	Pick a fun Disney song that you know really well.  That way, it'll be easier for you to maintain the correct tempo and hit the right notes.<br>  <br>  Some fun solo Disney songs are:<br>  <br>  Reflection (from Mulan)<br>  Go the Distance (from Hercules)<br>  Colours of the Wind (from Pocahontas)<br>  Part of Your World (from The Little Mermaid)<br>  Beauty and the Beast<br>  The Circle of Life (from The Lion King)<br>  You'll Be in My Heart (from Tarzan)<br>  <br>  Of course, it doesn't have to be Disney, but it seems like everybody knows these songs and would enjoy them. None of the songs I suggested are too difficult to sing, with a little practice.  There are TONS of karaoke versions of these songs on the Internet.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11296427	What's your range?<br>  <br>  <-- So important. Edit and i'll answer :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|y6e8kd4Jaa	try singing to different types of songs, ie, high pitch songs and low pitch,<br>  <br>  which sounds easier to sing? which sounds better?<br>  <br>  dont try doing a low song if your singing is high pitch ^-^;|`|W6vv68CVaa	try Put your Records on.. by Corrine Bailey Rae its nice and easy<br>  or... Bubbly by Colbie Calait thats easy too.<br>  pick a song you know well and that is in your vocal range. Also pick something that doesnt have too many super high notes or super lows. Or to many "tricks" for example vibrato.... <br>  I had the same trouble with my choir audition. good luck...
P0Fjh59Eaa	I'd love to introduce you to my almost 11 yr old son, who was conceived through that very way. <br>  <br>  YES you can get pregnant. ANYTIME you have sex you can get pregnant hon, protection or not. nothing is fool proof.<br>  matter-of-fact i'd love to introduce ALL of these idiots up above me saying "no" to my son...they all need a serious reality check!|`|1c0f793db881cd47badc0d00bd5bd1caaa	Short answer is yes, I don't know who you are and I don't want to be judgemental but you r question indicates that you really aren't at all clued up about the dangers of unprotected sex.  Please before you do it again or are pressured by your BF, read some literature and I don't mean Jane Austin.|`|9GUuVYinaa	Yes their is. No condom or no birth control will get you pregnant even if he pulls out. Pre-*** still has thousands of sperm cell that will get you pregnant. Be smart, use protection!|`|paHjJrrdaa	Yes, you can.  He could have pre-ejaculated inside you and neither of you whould know it.  And yes that does have sperm in it.  So yes, you can become pregnant.|`|ecfdaa0025f15f95c0f55c59a87b000aaa	Yes because before ejaculation there is always a seepage of semen which will contain live sperm. It is a risk. Also the withdrawal might be a split second to late and some will be deposited in you.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	Before he "cummed"?  Ok, yes you can still get pregnant as precome has sperm and is just as potent.|`|13hFRGN9aa	it may be possible. the first little squirt is the most potent. so if he did just a little inside you may be.|`|JjBwydymaa	Hunni the pull out method is not reliable...you really need to use contraception if you dont want to become pregnant! but it sounds like you dont.. so I would suggest you get yourself down the doctors and get on the pill or have the injection done!! Till then use condoms!<br>  <br>  Good luck hun x|`|d7SdhXm3aa	Yes.<br>  Just because the whole army didn't barge in doesn't mean a few eager soldiers didn't run ahead.<br>  <br>  Ah metaphors.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but yeah. Definitely is possible you're pregnant.|`|4Ovf0Gr8aa	there is always a slight possibility that you are pregnant when you have sex.. condom or no condom<br>  <br>  also .. pre-*** that he cannot feel coming out can get you pregnant|`|R1uFA7nKaa	Yeah its called the pull out method and its not a method at all cause it doesnt work.  You have a high chance of being pregnant.|`|9qymF2xlaa	Yes, and you could be pregnant with triplets or more|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	That's always pretty risky.|`|hmMb2oMOaa	Yeah.|`|fKzs6YuWaa	There is a such a thing as pre ejaculation....It is possible to get pregnant even though he pulls out, How the sperm is present and has been known to come out before ejaculation IS this sperm last for 72 hours outside the body (meaning where it is made) IF the man has ejaculated at anytime in the last 72 hours there is a CHANCE of Pregnancy! It would then be found in "pre-***". <br>  <br>  SO the answer is this YES, there can be sperm in "pre-***" and Yes, you can get pregnant, If you and your boyfriend aren't ready for a baby make sure you protect yourself. And always take care of yourself...Hope i Help|`|yKZQoLDoaa	Unfortunately even if a man doesn't insert his penis all the way, or withdraws his penis before ejaculation, a woman can still become pregnant. This is because 'pre-come' (the lubricating fluid that leaks out of a man's penis before and during sex) can contain sperm. If this fluid gets in or around a woman's vagina, it can find its way inside, and she can become pregnant. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Go to a nearby clinic and get things like the Depo shot, and Plan B. <br>  You can look up explanations online or ask when you get to the clinic.<br>  <br>  If you want to be extra careful have him wear a condom as well.<br>  <br>  And please, always, always have safe sex!<br>  You just never know....sweet dreams!|`|0k8IOdlzaa	Depends...if you swallowed his *** then you have a .100% chance of getting pregnant..bumhole .56% chance...on your backcheeks .0% in your eyeball .3%...so for safetys sake...eyeballs are always better to be cummed on.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Actually, to be serious...precum can contain small amounts of sperm. SO when he's riding you and you have about a ZERO % chance of knowing if he's really not cumming out of you...cause even with great control, he can still squirt a bit...and even then, the precum self lubricating gel that comes out of his penis head...you know the stuff...the stuff that you taste when youre giving him head...well that stuff has SPERM in it....Moral of the Story: "With great power comes great responsibility"-Uncle Ben Parker Translation: WEAR A CONDOM! I'm tired of my tax dollars going to fund teenage prerelease pregnancies. PEace OUT.<br>  <br>  Dr. Millanare|`|E0xuQFFnaa	It is possible because sperm comes out in his pre ***. I would start taking birth control if I was you to prevent further issues. I take seasonique its great I have no side effects and it gives you your period every 3months for 2 days and its light. Which means more love for your bf.|`|ms4sXzLhaa	Yeah, mostly probably cuz of the precum which is to clean out the old sperm inside and some of it can still be... "alive", that drips out before the sperm.|`|ebhu7ABvaa	I do it often. I know it's risky, but I hate condoms. They're too tight and can't feel the girl as much. Always came better. But I wouldn't recommend it to others.|`|DYlsqrMcaa	no way! its called the "pulling-out" method. its just as effective as a condom if not more. i use to to it all the time in high school.|`|OEv8gjPxaa	theres always a chance, unless your on the pill or used contraception you can get pregnant|`|Boubyng3aa	Yes, pull out is not a good method to use, it is very risky.|`|pKyi2GCqaa	quit sleeping in health class. YES.|`|Kmzxqt8taa	yepp u can
PymLdXM8aa	Hunny its completely normal i think , especially for us being first time Mom's. I slept with my daughter until she was 6 MONTHS old....lol. For the same reasoning as you. My husband spent MANY nights out on the couch haha. Although she started sleeping pretty much through the whole night at 3 or 4 months, except the occasional wake up for a quick feeding then passing back out which everyone told me the only reason she did that was because i was right there. Then i just lied and told my husband that she was still nursing at night because I couldnt sleep if she wasnt with me. SO finally at 6 mths we started trying the crib and she took to it pretty quick. Now shes 8 mths and I hold her and give her a bottle and she falls asleep around 9. I put her in her crib and she sleeps til 9 in the morning. And if she does wake up before I know shes not ready she'll whine for a minute or two then go back to sleep on her own and will  also nap on her own.So dont let people tell you that if you keep letting her sleep with you then it will be harder to get her to sleep in her crib because thats not always true. Just do what feels right to you hunny and ENJOY being able to sleep with her... i miss it :( Once they hit like 4 or 5 months things get a little crammed between all three of you, haha.<br>  <br>  GL and dont worry about what other people say is right or wrong, just do what you feel is right. Gl and congrats|`|5yIph0u5aa	Very normal you are suffering from seperation anxiety it sounds like. She will be fine you can always check on her from time to time if it would make you feel better. You could also get a monitor w/ video on it and that way you could watch her and see her at the same time you can get them at babies r us.|`|I7Sd9qd6aa	OMG you bet it is! when I moved my daughter into her room because my snoring would wake her then she would wake me and it got to be an ugly cycle, she was absolutely fine with it. ME on the other hand not so well. I laid in bed and cried. I was so sad and lonely without her there. I actually felt abandoned, lol. Now I am glad to have my own bed back. As is my husband if you know what I mean, lol. It gets easier in time. I still nap with her so I can get that snuggle time we both need. Just be patient and You will get through this.|`|AOvtRBU9aa	It's normal to be paranoid. If I were you I would just move her crib into my bedroom. you won't create a bad sleeping habit but yet you will get a good night sleep knowing she is safe. You can move her crib out of your room as she gets older since the chances of SIDS reduces significantly. GL|`|B9KwqnuDaa	It's your maternal instinct. Babies need to be close to their mommies. She was in your womb for 9 months and now she is all alone in a different room. Logical, I think not.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Of course this is normal. Every mother worries about these things... and it's not bad at all if they do. After she's been sleeping in her crib for awhile, you'll eventually get used to it.|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	Of course it's normal.  It only gets harder as you nurse longer.  I'm at the end of the weaning process of my 15 month old son and he is a fighter, but they become independent very quickly, just stay on track and don't give in.  I've always been like that.  I have to hear and see everything when I'm not in the room.  It's ok to be a little paranoid but just take it easy.  This will be hard for you too but yall will make it through.|`|u94HOVz7aa	i couldnt sleep without my babies in my room with me for the first 4 month.  but with this one he will probably stay longer since my only other option is put him in the living room or in with his sisters (although their room isn't big enough to add crib too) but i am happy with him in my room and dont have an issue keeping him there.  i don't think i could handle putting any of my babies in their own room before they were 4 months and i only did it then because their dad wanted to sleep at night again.  (i'm the one up with the babies 95% of the time)|`|gnIEDg6maa	6 weeks is not very old.  Whats the rush to get her in her own room?|`|tA7WDLm4aa	totally normal.  after about a week of her sleeping and doing well you will be over your fear.
tLGbtmGsaa	You didn't describe what the rash looked like but it sounds to me it is a heat rash.  When you bath him make sure you dry him thoroughly in those places where he is more affected.  This will reduce the severity of the rash.  I don't use baby lotions however I do use sorbolene or petroleum jelly on the places where my twins develop the rashes and it really helps.  It is possible that he is also allergic so what you did was a good idea.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if it has been more than a couple days,  i think i would have a doc look at it; if it seems to be worsening in warm moist places, he could be developing a yeast infection of the skin, which will take  a different cream...esp with one so young i would want to confirm it was just a laundry allergy....but i am on the paranoid side when it comes to my dd's health..|`|B9KwqnuDaa	My son was/is like this. I use calendula lotion and it clears up almost over night.
aZwaCKgdaa	That is a tricky question....for both pro-choice people and pro-life people.  I personally am pro-life (but politically, my stance is a bit more complicated). <br>  <br>  I believe that once a fetus is viable (at or around 24 weeks), it should be given rights.  The legal definition of death is the lack of cerebral brain waves -- I believe the legal definition of life should be the same (the onset of cerebral brain waves).  This occurs at about 24 weeks -- the same as the point of viability.  From this point forward, I DO believe the fetus should have a right to life.  At this point, a woman may choose to terminate her pregnancy (through BIRTH, not abortion), but the child can be given a chance to live.<br>  <br>  Now, holding a mother liable for substances she puts into her body is a much more sensitive issue.  What about an epileptic woman who needs medication to survive, but it increases the chance of birth defects?  Should she be held liable for any harm to her child?  What about a child who is born with a defect without the mother ingesting any harmful substances?  Should she be subjected to an increased level of scrutiny because of this?  <br>  <br>  Ideally, yes, I think babies should have rights, even before they are born.  Unfortunately, balancing the babies rights with the mother's rights can be very complicated!<br>  <br>  Interesting question!|`|bc9inzicaa	That is the reason why CPS is around...to try and protect the children who cannot protect themselves.  However, the question of implementing a law to protect the unborn in regards to abuse is pointless (not to be mean), but how will it be enforced?  I just hope that every mother to be is aware of the risk they are putting their child in when they down the bottle of vodka, snort that line of coke, or shot up the syringe filled with heroine.|`|hpnZ8awvaa	I'm not against abortion or anything, but yes, i think they should make a law to try and stop people from using drugs while pregnant. Because if a woman cannot stop using drugs while pregnant, then what are her chances of getting off them when the child is born?|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	Absolutely! I can't get more in depth, have baby in my arms I'm trying to get to sleep so I'm typing with one hand.|`|dN5BJeVpaa	Well yeah. As long as the child is planned on being born. <br>  <br>  I'm pro - choice, so I mean, at first I didn't want to say yes because I thought this was going to be a pro - life, pro - choice thing. <br>  But when you put it as a woman who PLANS TO KEEP baby, but neglects and puts it at risk by using drugs - that shouldn't be tolerated.
UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	I don't believe it would.  I know how stressful 3 kids can be and sometimes stress lowers your drive.  Find quality time with your husband and yall stick together.
P0Fjh59Eaa	No, there is no need. <br>  <br>  It takes 8-10 days for implantation to happen...meaning that you didn't become technically pregnant until 6-8 days after getting the shot.|`|lTUXdbCTaa	Please tell your doctor! And don't abort the baby. Let your doctor help you.|`|Fw1di2cBaa	When you had the shot you were barely pregnant, meaning the egg probably hadn't implanted itself into your uterus.  I doubt anything would be wrong with your baby.  But before you make such a huge decision, ask your doctor what it does to the baby (if he even knows).  I had surgery when I didn't know I was pregnant, and you aren't supposed to, but nothing was wrong with my baby.  Now she is 7 years old.|`|JEZ5j86Iaa	My dr told me not to get pregnant for at least 3 months after the rubella shot because it can effect the baby and cause a number of birth defects.  I do however think this is something you should talk to your dr about.  Good luck.|`|EIVEQxdSaa	PLease don't abort, talk to your doctor im sure you are not the first person this has happened to? he can sort you out Congratulations xxx|`|a19e78a9bb9de477a5b7313049dd2c65aa	how do you know you are 2wks pregnant?|`|w2HXX6Uvaa	Do not have an abortion, it is so wrong!

AA10982164	It is really so unusual to have some slight bleeding during a pregnancy, but it really bears watching. <br>  <br>  Slightly reddish/brownish isn't as much of a concern as bright red blood. Another thing to watch is the amount. Are you mostly spotting or is it more like a period? <br>  <br>  If you start having cramps or other types of abdominal pain or start bleeding heavily, I would go to the emergency room. If you just continue to have small amount of blood, I would take it easy. Lay around, no lifting and no prolonged standing. Call you obstetrician tomorrow and tell them, find out what their guideline are for you to go to the ER in case your bleeding changes over the weekend.<br>  <br>  Both of my daughters experienced bleeding during their pregnancies and delivered full term, healthy babies, but do take care.|`|K0iskcyHaa	No bleeding in pregnancy is "normal" despite what you may read on here, go to hospital straight away and get checked out, it may be nothing but may be something! try and get a ultrasound to be sure all is well.|`|mFQydvncaa	it could be nothing or something if your having cramps or worried i would call doctor now.

zDeEaja0aa	I totally understand what you are going through my son gave up morning naps at 5 months and having been taking one hour long evening nap a day since. He still gets up once at night for a feeding and he is out of this world starving (At 14 months).  During the day my son will fight all naps tooth and nail full blown screaming no matter what I do. I finally just gave up on the naps and let him do his own thing and he has been much happier since and goes down for the night around 7:30 pm pretty well. Some nights off and on he gets up many times and cries and it appears like no real reason My only conclusion was the fact my son was teething oragel and Tylenol seemed to help the fussiness. <br>  <br>  If oragel or tylenol doesn't seem to help trying a teething ring or damp hand towel put in the freezer. <br>  <br>  Also consult your pediatrician|`|OI3bf4yjaa	He could be teething. I was going through the exact same problem with my 6 month old, and it turns out she was teething. She wouldn't sleep either, because her little gums were in pain! Your son's gums are probably too. And let's face it.. everyone is irritable when they don't feel good. Try letting him suck on a cold rag.. that will soothe his gums. I did that with my daughter, and she eventually fell asleep after crying for maybe half an hour. <br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, I'm sorry I wasn't much help!! Good luck|`|rAD0mL7Saa	you can try putting on music for him that he's known since his time in-utero that he likes, you can try massage (some babies love it, some hate it), you can try lying down with him until he's asleep. As hard as it is, don't worry. Every baby sleeps when their tired, and an over-tired hyperactive baby usually has a long sleep when they do eventually sleep. Sounds a bit hard on you though. Is he being fed enough solids? He should be having 3 meals a day of normal home-cooked food that's blended and baby porridge or museli and fruit for breakfast. The cry-out method is dangerous and abusive and studies do show apart from psychological damage and insecurity (you just train them to not show a reaction or else there's a punishment) there is an increased SIDS rate. Often you can't PUT babies down to sleep. Just wait until they fall asleep or scream to be made comfortable. If he falls asleep on the floor, just wait until he's properly asleep and put him in his bed. This may sound odd, but I've never been able to get any of my children to sleep in a cot. I've got a toddler bed with a railing with a mattress on the floor next to it, and they put themselves down to sleep, and crawl/roll out of bed when they wake up. I heard they were dangerous for babies, so I used the cot, but they just wouldn't sleep. Neither of them. So the cot pretty much got used for clean washing most of the time.
AA10334348	I think he's just a sperm donor.|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	Nadya has admitted that all 14 of her children were conceived through in vitro fertilization.  She says that she has blocked tubes and therefore cannot conceive naturally.  The sperm donor was a friend of hers but he was just that - a sperm donor - and (at least in the state of CA) the law is very clear about sperm donor rights.  They have absolutely no claim to the children and also have no legal responsibility for the children.<br>  <br>  She obviously has some sort of mental issue.  No normal, responsible adult would bring children into the world under her circumstances.|`|AA11812653	he's just a sperm donor.  Usually sperm donors are not responsible for the offsprings.  It should be a mother's responsibility.  In this case, it should be the doctor's responsibility, the one's who implanted all those embryos into her.  She already had 6 kids! And what does it matter if she couldn't conceive naturally, she has 6 kids to begin with!  I feel sorry for all those 14 kids, they have a nut for a mother who can''t support them and pay attention to all of them.  I could go on, but I won't.

The cost is very low and the medical services are very good in India.<br>  <br>  My cousin and her husband got their IVF treatment in India through the Indian Med Guru in India and is all praise for this company. She is a known case of PCOS.She is a very happy mother of a baby boy now. She just paid 2500 pounds for the full IVF treatment in India for which she was quoted 8000 pounds in private setup in UK.<br>  <br>  Indian Med Guru is very famous in India. I read a lot about them in the newspapers. I have also read about a Chinese couple who planned surrogacy through the Indian Med Guru. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery and infertility treatment like IVF, IUI, and ICSI abroad for low price. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery and treatment  can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.indianmedguru.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.indianmedguru.com</a><br>  Hope this helps.

TTx7nUulaa	that's all they do.. just put monitors around your belly and check out the heartbeat. They may also give you a remote that you have to push every time you feel the baby move.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Thats it, they put the monitors on your belly.  They mark how many times the baby moves in a certain amount of time, the heartrate, and any contractions you may be having.  They may also do an u/s where they check the amniotic fluid, babies practice breathing, babies reflexes, movement, etc etc...  Those ultrasounds, the techs will score out of 10, they'll explain what that is if you get the ultrasound.  But other then that it really is just lounging and having the two monitors on your belly.  Goodluck|`|LkEQYdrraa	Normally a stress test involves walking on a tredmill and they gradually increase the incline. Chances are they will put someting on your belly when you are pregnant|`|SdFtat2Zaa	i has stress test a few days before delivery.

I don't know why I imagine that...-shrugs- |`|Qn5mn99vaa	I love it, it's one of my daughter's names! She is only 2 1/2, but she is very outgoing, loud and sometimes a little crazy (but then again, what toddler isn't?!). |`|bdG9i0tQaa	I think she will spend her life spelling it for people, correcting people's spelling of it and seeing people spell it Christina.|`|SOlSTznYaa	I like it :)<br>  <br>  I think a person with this name sounds athletic :)|`|b9HTkRDbaa	i like it|`|SIrmqu5maa	I think it's okay.

cdFhaLmEaa	I got up in the middle of the night to eat and I had insomnia, both very unusual for me.  My nipples were also swollen (different than usual premenstrual breast tenderness).<br>  <br>  I'd hold out until 2 days before you expect your period to test.|`|3fk6bTMxaa	Nausea is a pregnancy sign. Reach for a high protein snack and a glass of water as soon as you feel nausea coming on. Most women are aware they are pregnant before they can test. Pregnancy signs below. G|`|rLDB7ZwJaa	In order for it to work properly you must defaecate on the HPT.  You get quicker and more accurate results that way.|`|4xAZMuAKaa	you can use a HPT the first day of your missed period.As far as feeling off,well don't get to excited cuz if your trying to get pregnant your mind will actually convince your body that your having symptoms. Although you don't normally start feeling any different until about 6-8 weeks along.Thats when the morning sickness usually kicks in. it is different for everybody but I'd definatley wait until you have at least missed a period before I took a test and then I'd make an app. with your Dr. for them to do a test as well.Good luck!!!|`|tou1MIZUaa	other early signs are;<br>  breast fullness or tenderness<br>  mild dizziness, especially when getting up quickly<br>  <br>  Some pregnancy tests can be used up to 5 days before you expect your period.  That is now, so go to the store, and find one of those that say they can be used before your period.  If you get a negative result, don't give up yet, wait a few days, and use a HPT again.  It takes a while for the hormones that they measure to build up to a level where they can be read.|`|jnmeaUoBaa	take the HPT 3-4 days before you expect your next period...<br>  <br>  I was extrememly hungry and pee'd every 5 mins..<br>  <br>  I was also really tired.|`|wGG69Avjaa	you can check in a few days at least wait to the 7th. my early symptoms that i ignored were pain during sex, headaches, constant fatigue, my stomach felt like it was doing flips. i thought i had the flu. i worked at a daycare and was always sick with the kids. it was common for me to miss a period. so i didn't really pay it any attention. i couldn't take it anymore i was miserable. but when i went to the doctors i was elated with the news that i was 6 weeks pregnant. now i have this amazing 14 month old daughter that made all the sickness worth it. good luck and god bless|`|7kxrFFyoaa	ignore him.. and report him.<br>  u can test 4-5 days after implantation or 10-12 days after ovulation(earliest).. but it might not be accurate until the day of ur missed period.. i would wait until the 6th or 7th of oct and take a test! good luck!<br>  www.peeonastick.com has lotsa great HPT info!
tz3yxpzhaa	it actually just depends on the school you go to & how their rules are set up.|`|E7ViD8EWaa	They're either failing badly and the teacher asks them to come in on Saturday, or its a punishment.|`|U4U9EvCqaa	BIIIG TIME trouble<br>  did you do sumthing?|`|AA11355733	you either dont do one of the punishments as in detention or something or you just do something REALLY dumb to get into that big of trouble|`|0e233b9ffe94c161a83614727ce58f03aa	At my school its when you are failing a class or you broke the rules<br>  Like if someone was cheating or something.

bvgQV9lMaa	Reception/infant  yes I have noticed they got bigger, but not all do. They may not be moles, could be a dark freckle.   I had lots of freckles  (over my nose mainly) when I was younger but now most have faded but I have got a couple of darker freckles that are not moles. Also new moles develop over years sometimes.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about those little moles.  If they change you will notice.|`|AA10624857	I am mom to 4 kids who are now 29, 27, 24, and 11, so yes, 3 of my children are now adults. I need a bit more clarification on your question. If you could go back and add some additional details that would be helpful. I don't know what "Reception" is. I also don't know what types of "moles" you are talking about. We have the genetic disposition for moles on both my side and my husband's side of the family so all 4 of my children as well as my husband and I have moles on various parts of our bodies, but none of us have moles on our faces. So, if you could expand on your question that would be helpful.
ZuhvDanxaa	O my goodness!  you are so right.  It goes by so fast.  My baby will be six months old tomorrow.  We were just talking about it during dinner.  We realized it every time we give him a bath, we put cream on him, we dress him up. My partner and I does everything together as much as we can when it comes to our baby,  and we are amaze each passing day how our child is growing so fast.  Lots of his cute clothes doesn't fit him anymore, splashing in the tub, jumping on his bouncer.  It's just amazing.  We are enjoying every single minute that's why time flies by so quickly.|`|zmbeIbx7aa	Yeah I listened to them when they said it went fast because I didn't want to miss a thing so I have a lot a lot a lot of pictures. My son is 16 months old and it has flown by I was getting out his infant clothes and couldn't believe some of the things he use to fit in. Unbelievable. I think it goes by so quick is because you are enjoying watching your little one grow and do new things that you are always waiting for the next thing for them to do. I finally realized that it was going fast when he grew out of his first pair of shoes.|`|TQScv7Tcaa	NO wayyyyy, my daughter is 17 months on Monday and sometimes i still feel like a new mum. If i get the chance to have another child i will taking time out to savour my babies every moment, because i sure didnt with my daughter (and regret it BIG time).<br>  <br>  I dont think it goes by any faster than before but that you have something to gauge time on.<br>  <br>  I think when my daughter first sat was an ahhhhaaaa moment for me...she was about 5 months old and i just lookes at her and said "where did my little baby go?" and i have been saying it ever since :)<br>  <br>  I knew time went fast with a baby as i have 13 nieces (one is OMG 19 on Sunday), but when people said it goes so fast blah blah blah i was just like "yeah yeah whatever" and now i am one of those people that are saying "ENJOY IT IT GOES BY SO FAST " lol :)|`|l0YvaYTDaa	My son has been a challenging baby.

Lol it dragged! I knew after he was born time would go by fast but it changes when it's actually your baby. It's going by much faster than it did with my nieces and nephews. Kaden will be 9 months in 2 days and I still can't believe it.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	I didn't think it would go by at all fast.  Some days it just felt like they would last forever, and then wammo she's talking about boyfriends haha.  <br>  <br>  I agree with the other guy.  When your happy life goes by fast, but when your struggling it seems to go by slower.|`|DNygQdmVaa	It goes by so fast because your enjoying it so much.<br>  I realized it went by too fast when my preemie boy turned one.<br>  <br>  No i never really gave it much thought when people told me to enjoy it because it goes by so fast|`|MeYILJeSaa	I knew it was going to go by fast-my pregnancy went by fast and my baby is getting bigger even faster. :( Time flies when you're having fun.|`|kr0IgpDeaa	NO -  TIME - NOW - NO
8e78ab3e9f61fd825a86ea5e1c7c2e92aa	Call CVS or Walgreens they can tell you if medications can be taken together.|`|mqHL4UcRaa	I'm not sure if you can take both of those together, and I wouldnt fully trust our answers. I would call the nurse and ask her. She will know :)<br>  <br>  What you can do for your sinuses for instant relief is get a sinus rinse from your pharmacy. It's about $12 or so. It's basically a saltine solution that you shoot up one nostril and it comes out the other nostril. It cleans ALL the gunk out of your nose so you can breath again. **It's not nasal spray, but sinus rinse.<br>  <br>  Theres also a natural nasal spray that has some sort of tingly mint feeling. I'm not sure what you call the ingredients, but it helps if your nose becomes dry.|`|36PrVK7Oaa	OMG do not take that stuff while u r preggers !!|`|RsFxgN4Gaa	Claritin and Sudafed are not the same thing nor do they do the same thing. Claritin just helps to keep your body from reacting to allergens. Sudafed treats the reaction, or symptoms of the allergens (hope that makes sense).<br>  <br>  They are safe to take together.<br>  <br>  I'm 7 months pregnant. I take zyrtec daily for my allergies and I also take tylenol sinus severe for the runny/stuffy nose and headaches I get from my sinus allergies.<br>  <br>  If I didn't take the zyrtec I would be alot worse off!
6qjeneB7aa	It's interesting and unique. Only thing I don't like is that it reminds me a little of ziti...but that might be because I'm hungry. :D One of my favorite names comes from my favorite TV show, Law and Order: Criminal Intent - wow, we both like cop shows too! haha. The name is Alexandra Kathryn - Alexandra (Alex) after the character Alex Eames, and Kathryn is after the actress Kathryn Erbe.|`|TmAj5gUZaa	Honestly, I'm not crazy about the name Ziva.<br>  <br>  As for middle names, since it's an unusual name, it may be advisable to go with a more common middle name, such as Lynne, Anne, Marie, Claire, Leigh etc.<br>  <br>  I am assuming that the first syllable of Ziva is stressed (i.e. ZEE-vah not zee-VAH).  In this case, if you want to get more original with middle names, I would suggest choosing a two syllable name where the second syllable is stressed. Some ideas that come to mind are:<br>  Nicole<br>  Michelle<br>  Noelle<br>  Eileen<br>  Celeste<br>  <br>  As for TV shows, according to tv.com, it's likely NCIS, although I have never watched the show myself :)|`|tOaZcxQXaa	mmm. im not sure i like it.<br>  <br>  what about Delaney,Dalena,Akeisha,Aliana,Azlynn,Zay...<br>  <br>  I dont know if you like these name but they are unique.<br>   Hope i helped :)|`|XpXoalmFaa	Ziva Lee<br>  Ziva Zen|`|CeEnwf9Vaa	How about Ziva Chalee'|`|zTfMdChTaa	ziva chalee.

Anyway, it is none of your buisness.<br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|wnkoTEqVaa	talk to a teacher.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	Go to their house when you know he's going to be out some where.<br>  Or maybe contact the school counselor. He won't know it's you.<br>  He needs help, i've had friends that used to cut themselves and I did myself.<br>  Just be supportive of him. Maybe something is going wrong in his life and he needs help. Try to be there for him and try to find out if something is going on, cause I doubt he's doing this for fun. He may already be addicted to cutting, this is serious..|`|6gthdHpnaa	Don't tell his parents, they don't even know you and might not believe you. Talk to a school guidance counselor about what you saw, hopefully they will be able to do something to help.|`|Inc78M0Raa	Tell the school nurse. She'll tell his parents, no matter what she says. That's what happened to my friend. The nurse told her she would tell her parents about her hip piercings, but she told her parents anyway.|`|8cd6d1064a8d6379febc6914e867a26baa	Tell the school nurse, she will contact his parents.|`|k4gXIxJNaa	Definitely tell a teacher, consul er or mentor. Suicide is serious and cutting is a form of it. It may of just been peer pressure but it may not and if something happened, knowing you could of helped him would be really hard to deal with.|`|55aba19c6c9d9f4e98e2303268e9a73faa	Go to your school teacher or counselor. Tell them what you told us, and that you're not sure if he really is cutting, but that he has a history of contemplating suicide.<br>  <br>  Just tell the teacher/counselor you want to be anonymous, and let them go from there. It's their job to contact the parents if a teen is possibly hurting themselves, or planning on hurting others. They aren't allowed to tell who came forward, so you should be in the clear.<br>  <br>  But, think long and hard about this. If you're that worried and concerned, the definately tell someone.|`|yas23v7laa	Well first off you should tell a school counsulor, tell them exactly what you saw and exactly how it made you feel, also tell them that you dont want that person to know that you were the one who told on them, the counsulor will be forced to talk to that student and will also be forced to tell his parents. this will get you out of the picture and this way it is deff going to get taken care of. he will eventually get the help he needs and you wont have to do any talking at all. hope i helped : )

AA10381258	I would make it clear that you are going to be very uncomfortable in the car that far along in pregnancy, plus he'll be stopping like every hour for you to pee. I can't imagine the aches, plus you have a higher chance of getting blood clots in the legs during pregnancy if you aren't moving around a bit.|`|4QCYjPYhaa	I am 31 weeks and have been traveling my entire pregnancy as my husbands job doesnt keep him in one place long and I have joint custody of my 2 daughters from a previous marriage, anyhow, I drive to and from weekly to where ever he is at.  It has yet to be more than 8 house from home but its miserable on me, even just the 3 hour drives,  In the car is when I have the most braxton hick contraction and it hurts my back, by butt and legs.....I would absolutely fly if I had the option to especially when the distance you are going.
nVQGpvuoaa	Actually it is. <br>  All the toddlers I encountered with can't say the letter "L" she will learn it.

If she isn't past it by 6 then I would bring it to your pediatricians attention.  <br>  But we had the same issue with our son, only he couldn't say his "R"'s.  He would say Willy instead of Really and Wide instead of Ride.  We were told that when he began to spell and read it would go away.  When they study individual sounds and see the words they are pronouncing incorrectly they get it.  We struggled with our son to the point of frustration and then one day he came home from Kindergarten and said "MOM!  Guess what I found out today??  One of our spelling words is Really (and he said it right, which got my full attention)."  He said "Did you know that it isn't Willy?  It starts with an R!  And R says rrrrr!"  I was a little put off at first because my gut reaction was "Duh Sherlock!! I have been telling you that for years!"  But, I just acted like he discovered the coolest thing on earth.  I then began practicing other words he had trouble with to speed the process up of him saying his words right.<br>  So, once she starts learning what all the letters say and how to put them together to form words, she will have an "AH HA" moment and it will dawn on her that she is saying these words wrong and it will correct itself!<br>  So, enjoy that cuteness!  It should last a few more years!  :)<br>  <br>  OH, and we learned the hard way... Don't correct her too much or make a huge deal of it... and don't let anyone tease her about it... that can cause a stutter.  Just let it happen, it will come.<br>  <br>  LOL-edit:  My sister with all her kids had to Froggies (with a long O sound) instead of Frog or Froggie because it would come out F-u- ... you got it.<br>  Also truck would be said ***** so they called everything a car or a big car, lol. <br>  You gotta get creative... kids are a riot!!!|`|6RGnG1ukaa	It's very normal. She may just have a lisp. Nothing to worry about, nothing at all. Maybe you should take her to a speech therapist, just to ensure that it is a lisp. It could be taken care of very easily.|`|87WOSjwgaa	It is very normal and sooo cute!!!! Enjoy it mommy!|`|1o820L3Daa	Yeah, my daughter did the same thing. It turned out she had a slight lisp, I took her to see a speech pathologist, and I wa told, to remind her to keep her tongue bhind her teeth when she spoke, and curl the tongue up with you make the letter L sound. If you know what I mean, My daughter now speaks clearly, but she is very young, so just correct her when she says it, and you should be fine.|`|TBYEQi64aa	yeah, that happens.<br>  <br>  I'm aspiring to be a speech-language pathologist, because I had speech impediments growing up. <br>  <br>  My mom tried to get me to say "smuckers," but I couldn't. Instead, I replaced the "sm" sound with an "f." My mom used to get really angry at me and beat me. <br>  <br>  Now that I think about it, that was child abuse.

4p9sBdyTaa	You will have about 5 small tubes taken at the first appointment, it isn't a big deal. It is just one small prick.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Yes. I had 5 viles at one time and 3 agian later on the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  It's no big deal, just like a regular blood test. No overnight or anything. It's for the pre-natal panel, iron levels, HIV testing, and all that.|`|NMCOMYD5aa	yes my first appointmen i had 9 tubes drawn and it was not an option they usd a butterfly needle(tiny needle somthin like a iv)and i go it drawn out my hand..im really scared of needles so it was hard for me|`|jOyzcJd7aa	I was suppose to have about 10 tubes but the lab guy just took eight, they take so much blood so that they can check for HIV, AID's and some other stuff which is VERY important to know for a pregnancy. No they don't use an IV, it's a very quick process. No one can really tell you your chances on a c-section it all depends on how big the baby is and the situation. & That's all I know so far! But I will say it will all be worth it once you see your baby's face!|`|HFKVREiUaa	they drew 4 large viles from me, you can ask for a baby needle to have your blood drawn. if you say no to the test then you are saying no to prenatel care and the dr.will probley refuse to see you.

My advice for shopping is to remember not to go to excess (if that's possible!). We went a little crazy on outfits. Then our baby grew so fast that he was only able to wear some of the things we bought him once or twice before he had outgrown them!<br>  <br>  I like the Web sites listed here.

There are always the other things like bottles, diapers, baby monitor ect ect. Just walk around the baby section at any store and you will see things. We started buying things pretty early and just always check to see what is on sale when ever we go to the store. Don't buy too many clothes...babies grow really quickly! Also keep an eye out on craigslist and ebay. I found so many great deals on craigslist. A lot of people try to just sell old junk on there, but if your patient you can find great stuff in excellent condition.

It helps him fall in love with reading when he/or she is older.<br>  Get some Mozart or baroque music and play it and make sure its not too loud you might damage his ears.|`|UNXf7lZZaa	In my opinion, its a little early for you to be shopping for the baby, but whatever floats your boat. By the time your little one arrives I'd recommend you'd have bottles, formula, diapers, clothes, etc. You'll also need a place for him to sleep such as a crib or bassinet. <br>  <br>  I hope I helped :]|`|uPIo574Baa	Crib, clothes, toys, food, diapers, lotion..
N4JUrdbsaa	Well, if you like her, then tell her, and don't be afraid of rejection. However, you can't be surprised if she says no because if she is your best friend, then that's a cause for trouble. It's difficult to make the switch from best friend to girlfriend, especially since she is gone for school. <br>  <br>  If she says no, then not only should you not be surprised, but you shouldn't feel any negative feelings towards her. You don't make the choices for her, and you chose to tell her. Don't resent her. Try and continue the friendship...and forgive and forget. Even if your heart aches for her, well...I'm not saying get over it, but I am saying that you'll have to move on.|`|7AnY9IePaa	Be open and honest with her ask her out the worst thing she can say is no.|`|TI3RWrVLaa	if the girl is not interested in you dont wast your time, its a numbers game love comes and goes, dont waste your time on a stupid broad who cant make her mind up go talk to her friends|`|56f3734734f9e06ae4bfa7076ac45038aa	Honestly....its probably better if you didn't get into a serious relationship. All that happens is at first its the typical "I love you. youre so perfect." and then as time wears on...and you get deeper into the relationship...you develope trust issues...you start doubting each other...you will push each other away...you will hurt each other....and when its all said and done...and you two have gone your seperate ways...all you're left with its contempt and heartbreak.<br>  <br>  dont get involved.|`|aWPQXoIAaa	Whoa....she is playing w u. Girls LOVE knowing that they have someone wrapped around their finger! It's an insecurity thing. If u want to give her the benefit of the doubt, just tell her exactly how u feel and tell he u want to be w her. If she makes ANY excuse or if she has a boyfirend she is not willing to break up w for u, then u know that she really only thinks of u as a friend and u need to move on.

nKXTjqQWaa	For ME, no more than two years. But that is just my opinion. For some mothers and babies they are comfortable with mush longer than that and that is ok. I will probably try to wean by one year. I think any amount of BFing is good for the baby and if a mom can make it to a year that's great, if not, it's not the end of the world.|`|u94HOVz7aa	I believe you should breast feed as long as you and the baby feel comfortable doing it.   not that i am a testimate to that i have an issue with breastfeeding in public and have never been good at pumping so i always end up switching to formula, but always wish i could over come my issues so i could breast feed longer than i did.|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	Like most other posters said, a baby should be breastfed as long as mutually desired.  It is a decision that is up to the baby and/or mother.  When the mother decides she doesn't want to anymore or the baby self weans.|`|rqwXqmyTaa	I only breast fed the first month.  I think it should be however long the mother wants to do it.  With the exception of breat feeding an 8 year old.  I think 1-1 /2 years old tops.|`|XRCGaQW5aa	I think that that is a personal choice between the mother and child I myself think that you should let the child self-wean when they are ready. My daughter self weaned at 18 months. I think that over  5 it gets kind of weird but I think it's a very personal decision to begin with.|`|fMilDRgLaa	I really think it is up to the child and what mom feels is best for her child. A child will naturally wean itself away usually by the age of 3 if it has not done so already.

So for me, I'd say about 18 months is right.|`|LWXRVO5Haa	It is recommend by the American Academy of Family Physicians that a baby drinks its mothers milk for the first two years of life.<br>  <br>  Why?

UNXf7lZZaa	I think they are both good names that fit.<br>  When I hear these names, (and this is just me) I think way back to like 1800's or so and I think of a queen and king. I have no clue as to why I think like this, but in my opinion, I think they sound somewhat like names to be found near royalty. In other words, I think they both go together well.|`|0e5c9397c23c99399180fbb44de5ac85aa	They remind me of royalty also, haha. (Maybe because of Queen Elizabeth and Princess Diana, and Prince Henry, haha. Don't know of an Allen though)<br>  I think they're good names, actually!

kVBDpAMTaa	I honestly don't think it goes away for some people. I am 6 months and still getting morning sickness, not everyday now though.|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	It varies from person to person, pregnancy to pregnancy. It could go away any day or could last all pregnancy. With my first it lasted until 14 weeks and I truly hope it goes away sooner this time around. I'm ready to have my stomach removed so I don't feel this nausea anymore.|`|HOdblqIkaa	it varies because no pregnancy is the same. it should subside in the next few weeks but its possible to continue all throughout the pregnancy. mine ended around the 20th week but every once in a while i still get it. now i have horrible heartburn, hopefully you get the pleasure of avoiding that!|`|AA10015577	Everyone is different but morning sickness typically subsides by the second trimester, but be warned that some women experience it longer or for even their WHOLE pregnancy.  Good luck!|`|MOsStEbqaa	It can last up to 13 weeks. That's when it is supposed to stop or at least get better.

Xrwvu5Uraa	you can get pregnant any time of the month<br>  whether you are on your period, ovulating or not.<br>  so the answer to your question is, yes.|`|eu6UQElYaa	yes.  pregnancy is most likely anywhere from 2-3 days before ovulation until 2-3 days after ovulation.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	yes and being closer to those days make it easier... you can get pregnant any day of the month unless you are on the pill and using protection... <br>  <br>  good luck|`|dYOpKvOCaa	you can get preggo anytime|`|jkDbDjcRaa	You can get pregnant at any time of your cycle.<br>  It's not common, but it happens.|`|77NzfiVkaa	You can get pregnant ANY time!! Why does nobody know this?|`|wnxOXBuKaa	You can get pregnant any time. Those three days are the days you are most fertile...<br>  <br>  Which means if you're a fertile mertile, don't even SMILE at a man during those three days *haha*<br>  <br>  Remember in Math class how they would draw a graph of statistics? <br>  Well, that's basically what it is. Imagine a line graph that shows your likely hood of getting pregnant. <br>  <br>  It would be lower and then suddenly around the days you ovulate it would jump up and then back down again...but always have the chance of being pregnant inbetween. :-P|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Absolutely.  As a matter of fact, you can't get pregnant UNTIL you ovulate, although sperm can live inside you several days, so if you had sex 3 days before you ovulate you could definitely get pregnant from that.|`|sIpWVCItaa	you never know exactly when you ovulate. it could be a day earlier, a day later, or whatever from what is predicted. its just an estimate in general. not exact timings.|`|sw08ARSZaa	Yup. Take a home pregnancy test. If it shows positive you are definitely pregnant. If it shows negative, go to a family planning clinic and get a blood test to confirm.|`|ZDqdYhdGaa	You can get pregnant at any time, the 3 days is just your most fertile time. I have known girls to get pregnant at all sort of days throughout their cycle.|`|E4WGxzXzaa	yes you can|`|5MJlsORUaa	definetly|`|Bxvs28oBaa	yes|`|4eFOgso6aa	Well you are suppose to ovulate any where from the 12th thru the 18th day after the first day of your last period meaning you start your period thats day 1 then you are usualy fertile during that 12th thru 18th window but your egg can still be somewhere in your womb so its possible before then or after then to get pregnant. And by the way sperm can live up to like 2 days if I'm not mistaken in your vagina so its pretty risky if you dont want a baby to have sex just using the calender as your guide. You should have a period every 26 -28 days so if you are late I would get a test and if you are not pregnant and dont want to be then try condoms,spermicide,birth control, and if there is an "oops" a plan B pill is about all your only option which you have to do with in 72hours. Good luck!!|`|vvdq1QHoaa	You can get pregnant at anytime during your cycle but it is just easier during that 3 day period. I found a good site that can explain everything about getting pregnant afterward. <br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.babyhopes.com/articles/afterovulation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyhopes.com/articles/aftero...</a><br>   <br>  Hope this helps!|`|Egg3sJULaa	i believe you can to make sure you may want to go to a site that shows what days you can concieve by putting in the day of your last period. Just go to google and type in my fertile days.|`|qJDdvybeaa	Of course.  Don't listen to that 3day mess.  Some people get pregnant just by thinking of sex to hard.  To be 100% use a condom and forget the math|`|W6ai3hopaa	You can get pregnant at any time during your cycle. I would recommend getting plan b from your local pharmacy as soon as possible.|`|7aVPODR8aa	Yes you can.|`|wRyX3A7Oaa	any woman can get pregnant any day of the week.... It don't matter what stage you are in your cycle, certain days just give you a better chance at concieving|`|AA11265057	Yes|`|VU5IPr1Waa	OF COURSE|`|xBBrHN3Faa	uh ohhh. In 9 Months your going to have a Jr.|`|oaw7ssT7aa	yes|`|qbwSpiimaa	It's been a few years since I had my last child, but as memory serves me, I believe that sperm is able to live inside your uterus/fallopian tubes/etc. for about 3 days.  That means you could have sex 3 days before ovulation, or 3 days after ovulation, or anywhere inbetween, and still possibly get pregnant.  Have you thought about using an ovulation predictor test?  When my husband and I had been trying for a year to get pregnant with our first child, I finally decided to use a predictor test.  I used the first one, got a result that said I was ovulating, so we had sex that night.  About 2 1/2 weeks later I was taking another kind of test.  A pregnancy test that turned out positive!!!   Good luck to you! :)
CSysSbnlaa	Harvest is cool. I didn't even know that was a name! Don't let anyone say that you should name your daughter something normal. Because if you do, your daughter could be considered normal.

However, it may be associated with some conditions like PMS, High prolactin levels. This symptom alone cannot confirm pregnancy and the only way to confirm is to take a blood test or do a Home pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  To know more about early symptoms of pregnancy and the confirmatory tests, read this article<br>  <a href="http://www.dubaimoms.com/ArticleInfo.php?aid=45&cid=2&sid=6" rel="nofollow">http://www.dubaimoms.com/ArticleInfo.php...</a>|`|9bhZVJ61aa	I noticed a change in my chest before 6 weeks gestation.|`|sDAnuaBYaa	Yes, you could be pregnant.

PTdy6TWRaa	You need to find a way to break the ice. Maybe talking about a mutual interest would get you started. He might really like you but not know how to get the nerve up to tell you. If you could be more at ease then it would put him more at ease too and he might open up more.

b2acf57f08fe6f558c997db984a74b15aa	Wait for several weeks after baby is born.  When the stress of taking care of the baby starts to get "normal" then the two of you need to get together and talk about this.  You are probably going to want to be around your family during this time rather then be with him.  Plus not only is he going to have a baby but he's moving and moving is stressful on top of getting together with you and suddenly being a dad.  I would wait.  He needs to adjust and so do you.  I hope your family is a good support network.  :-)<br>  <br>  Also talk to him about this.  Communicate so he knows what you are thinking and you know what he is thinking.  I'm surprised that he got excited about this so fast.  It took my husband about 7 months and we are married.|`|0edad872accfa7019b8218de1c740bcbaa	It's definitely best for the baby to have his/her biological father.  I know you feel scared right now and don't want to do this alone.  If the two of you aren't even friends to begin with, it's very hard for the relationship to work.  There are so much stress in raising a child and having a family.  My husband and I got a house together, and that move alone brought us so many arguments at the beginning.  Another question is, how much do you like each other?  Is he eventually going to move on to another woman later on?  Moving to another state is a huge dicision.  Would he consider moving to NC to be with you and the baby?  It would also help to know what old you and the guy are.   Sorry I had so many questions, but this is something you should think about.|`|XMm0XR75aa	make a list of the pros nd cons gd luck x

AA10624857	This depends on some factors.  First, by "babysitter" do you mean that you are a teenager taking care of children on an occasional basis at the children's home?  Or, are you a child care provider, meaning you are an adult and care for these children on a regular basis in your home?  I am going to assume you are a teen caring for these children on an occasional basis because you don't know how old the children are plus if they are "9-ish" and 7-ish" you could only care for them on weekends since they should be in school during the week.  I am a licensed child care provider in my home.  I charge by the hour with rates that are $3/hour for 1 child with a $1 sibling discount, so 2 children in the same family are $5/hour.  However, I typically take care of the children at least several days per week.  If you are caring for the children as a teenage babysitter, than you can easily charge more per hour, especially if you only do it once in a while.  Another factor that comes in to play is the area in which you live.  Some areas are economically able to support child care fees that are more, but others aren't.  The best thing you can do to see if your rates are comprable is to do some research with other care providers in your area.  If you are a teen, ask around to friends you know who babysit and find out what they are paid.  If you are an adult child care provider, call around to other daycare centers and homes or do some research on line to find out average child care costs in your area.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	8-5 and they are 7 and 9... I'm assuming this is the weekend because otherwise they'd be in school and wouldn't need a babysitter. <br>  It comes out to $40 for the day. <br>  <br>  When I see stuff like this it's why I like a sitter that can tell me upfront "I charge $$ per hour and for each additional child living in the home is an additional $$ per hour paid in advance" so I know. It's when sitters usually just say "pay me whatever or it doesn't matter"  that they are taken advantage of.  Regardless of what business you are in you should set your rates according to your area and stick to them. Babysitting is no different. That way there is no "debate" or "discussion" on your fee, it's known up front that you get $$ per hour.  Something you might want to think about before you take any more jobs.|`|280e5454382ec7c1fde696aa492e2c7faa	I think you should at least get paid minimum wage. Honestly age has some but not all "say" as to how much you get paid. It depends mostly on how well behaved the children are. If the kids are monsters then ask for more but if they just sit and watch T.V all day then 5 dollars is not too bad.|`|PNPg9Ytkaa	it depends where you live but I would say that is about fair... at the age of 9 and 7 you really don't have to do much they are pretty independent... not if it was a 2 and 3 year old that would be different

cqgWkdPtaa	the reason he gets so sleepy is because formula is a lot harder for his system to digest than breastmilk is. This means that his body focuses on trying to digest it and therefore, he gets sleepy and goes to sleep while his body digests the formula. Try to keep him on breastmilk (expressed or straight from the breast) as much as possible, its a lot easier on his little body.|`|L8peUnIPaa	Breastmilk digests easier & faster than formula so breastfed babies typically want to eat more often, where formula fed babies tend to sleep longer at a time, b/c the formual lasts longer in there stomachs<br>  OB/GYN RN & mom|`|ZDMDSCL0aa	some formula feed babys will sleep better. that means nothing. breastmilk is better. a baby that needs to be fed every hour or so will be healtier

Tanti auguri.|`|SZpsGrlJaa	ho avuto anch'io un distacco di placenta,mio figlio ora ha 26anni e sta benissimo,allora mi avevano detto di stare a riposo ,non sforzarti fai solo le cose che non ti affaticano,segui il consiglio del medico prendi le medicine che sono importanti e vedrai che andra' tutto bene.in bocca al lupo|`|lwbuR3REaa	stai a riposo assoluto, niente sesso finchè non ti sistemi!<br>  Tranquilla che passa, ma devi stare a riposo però!!!!|`|gGeE4lkjaa	se sono 2 mm, con tanto riposo e la cura che ti hanno prescritto dovrebbe andare a posto...stai tranquilla|`|CAvKXa63aa	2 mm sono poco,quindi nn corri grossi rischi,ma stai a riposo mi raccomando.<br>  la mia amica aveva 10 cm di distacco è stata ricoverata 2 settimane per forte emorragia ma ora va meglio!|`|AkBHacS5aa	Ciao! Io sono a 11+1 della seconda gravidanza e anche a me l'hanno riscontrato un paio di settimane fa: mi hanno messo a riposo (ma con una bimba di tre anni e mezzo non è semplicissimo...) e mi hanno assicurato che in un paio di settimane tutto tornerà a posto (ho l'eco di controllo il 20). Anche io sto usando il progesterone, che però per altri problemi usavo già da prima.<br>  In bocca al lupo e stai tranquilla, è una cosa molto frequente e abbastanza facile da risolvere.|`|jXoeQ3A4aa	Intanto stai tranquilla perchè 2 mm è pochissimo!!!!! di quante settimane sei??? io quando ero di circa 6 settimane l' ho avuto di circa 4 mm ed è bastato il riposo per mandarlo via quindi stai tranquilla !!!!! non sarebbe preoccupante nemmeno se fossi a gravidanza avanzata basta un po' di progesterone è veramnete minimo!!! Auguroni
jaT35u4oaa	No way!<br>  <br>  I took my group of preschoolers to a 3D movie a few years back ( Shark boy and Lava Girl ) and I was worried about the younger ones ( 3 years old) - but they LOVED it, and watching their reactions was hilarious!|`|RtiDXKcaaa	idk if it will hurt their eyes, but if its like a kids movie like monsters versus aliens then yeah. lol but not my bloody valentine in 3-d|`|o65klEwWaa	My 3 yo went to a 3D movie the other day (Journey to Cenre of Earth) and loved it. We didn't have to wear special glasses.<br>  <br>  She has also been inside an interactive 3D movie display at a museum and loved that. But then she is a movie-buff. Some kids could be scared by it.<br>  <br>  A classic 3D movie aimed at kids is Barbie Pegasus, but you have to wear 3D glasses which my kids hate.|`|987923b8a7fffddd6d84106ce71d68a3aa	If it's a scary movie, then yes. If there is such a thing as a kids movie in 3D that may be fine.

dR4QN0gHaa	Swaddle her. She will sleep in your arms because it is warm and comforting. If you swaddle her really tight it will give her the same feeling.|`|NnWC1lxdaa	maybe shes not a back sleeper. i know they say to put them on their backs is safer, but my firist baby slept on her belly, my second baby slept on his back. and my 3rd baby slept in the swing the first 2 months of his life, and now all 3 of them are good sleepers. maybe she will sleep on her side? i have a daycare baby who will not sleep on his back but will sleep great on is side, since that is how he sleeps at home with his mom.  i would just try different sleeping postions, you will fine one that she likes and she will sleep great. since she has slept with you before maybe the reason she slept good is because she could hear you sleeping/breathing, try putting a fan in her room or a white noise machine and see if that helps|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	She's in need of contact, sleeping on her back makes her feel helpless..so to speak.<br>  So firs tof all you can swaddle her, so she'll be snuggli and then you can try again, also you could get a sleep positioner, it not only keeps your baby in position safely but the sides provides the baby with a sense of comfort, it reduces her space and feels more secure. You can always try and place her on her side if she prefers that. It is also safe. My daughter never liked sleeping on her back, but we realized that she was fine sleeping on her side so that's what we did. <br>  <br>  Look here's the sleep positioner I was talking about :<br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=4645524" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a>|`|Mr6U1TiHaa	maybe the matresss on the crib is hard....get her use to it, never let them sleep with you, it is dangerous and a pain in the bud..my sister never used her crib and now the baby is almost 1 year old and sleeps between my sister and her husband, ..if she cries just let her, put on her spacifier and dont let her see you, eventually shell go to sleep.. or you can buy the j&j bedtime bath and lotion|`|494a7a701dcb960d4740e929d5b8b41daa	I would try swaddling her.  I had the same sort of problem with my son (who is now 14 months).  We were so excited to have him that we held him ALL the time.  It made it so he got use to only falling asleep in our arms.  So we had to retrain him to sleep by himself.  With swaddling her it will give her the extra warmth she feels when she is being held by you.<br>  If you are worried about her sleeping in your bed because of rolling over on her there are these little beds called, "safe and secure" that Walmart sells.  It has raised sides that are ventilated.  The little bed worked great with our son.  he felt near to us and we could not roll on top of him because of the raised sides.  He slept in that in our bed during the night until he was 3 months old.<br>  Congrads! on your daughter!|`|d092475deaa61dba856bb6c8d78f69d3aa	Try using a baby sleep positioner. They're about $10 at Wal-Mart and it seemed to help alot with my daughter when she wouldn't sleep on her back in her crib. The feeling of the positioner on her legs or back helped her stay asleep. Putting her on her side worked too.|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	Swaddling works wonders.  You can even get a swaddler blanket at most stores like Wal Mart.  We swaddled our baby until she was 3 months, and could break out of it.  She didn't like to sleep on her back either, but when she was swaddled she would go right to sleep.|`|vimB7Rhqaa	you can also roll some soft towels or a fleece blanket in to the shape of a "u". put the baby inside. it works in the neonatal icu...|`|EcdelIHtaa	thats probably because u pick her up as soon as she starts crying<br>  just let her lay there crying so she can get used to it
6Knhikr1aa	If you look, almost everything says to consult a doctor if you are breastfeeding. That's for insurance purposes. That said, you should avoid diet pills while breastfeeding, but your baby will be fine if you took one pill. If she is latching on, then you should try again! Breastfeeding can be hard and no one tells you that. I believe more women would do it if people were just honest and said it's not a walk in the park all the time! But it's excellent for your baby and also for you. If you would like some help, e-mail me. I am breastfeeding my 3rd baby. This will be my 6th year or breastfeeding if you include all three boys. I've had a lot of problems, but worked through them and it really was worth it. I'm SO glad I kept it up.<br>  So, short answer. Your baby will be fine and keep nursing!|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	my dr told be that any OTC medication you take will say that. they have to cover their butts just in case. it doesnt actually mean it is dangerous for your baby. i wouldnt take any more and call about it tomorrow.|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	It is probably fine...if you'll notice, even pre-natal vitamins tell you to consult a dr. if you are pregnant or breastfeeding...it is a liability thing.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	The baby should be fine.  It does contain caffeine so that's probably where the caution is coming from on the label but look at the other ingredients. <br>  <br>  But if she latched on like a champ you should definitely give the breastfeeding another try.  It will take roughly the same amount of time you haven't been breastfeeding to build a supply again-if you stopped 2 weeks ago it would take about 2 weeks to build your supply again.|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	I'd say you are probably fine, but it wouldn't hurt to check in with your doctor tomorrow.  My doctor told me that most meds have to say "Check with your doctor if you are nursing or pregnant" because they can't test the meds on pregnant or nursing mothers so they don't know what the effect is.  It may have no effect.|`|ROEBagSraa	What you take your baby will take i would stop breast feeding just today i would phone your doctor tomorrow and they will tell you what to do i would allso keep on breast feeding when you get the all clear try not to worry theese things happen good luck|`|JsEd4H0raa	She really should be fine. They just say contact your doctor because they don't know what it will do to pregnant women and breastfed babies. I wouldn't worry. If you are really worried call her doctor in the morning.|`|PNqwhlq9aa	Don't worry she will be fine. I would just stop one or the other but the little bit that she got today wont hurt her. I would say keep breastfeeding that will burn lots of the baby fat and it is better for you. Just drink LOTS of water ( 2 to 4 liters a day). Also if you breastfeed you wont have your period another plus :) but be careful you can still get pregnant.<br>  Hope this helped and congrats!|`|b6NhNXWMaa	I would stop taking the pill and try again with Breastfeeding, your baby should be fine if it was only one pill. To make you feel better call a couple pharmacist today and then your doctor tomorrow. =) Good luck.
AA10107473	It's preeclampsia. The high BP and swelling should be enough...add the severe abdominal pain (which is the tell-tale sign) and there should be no question.<br>  <br>  Get a 2nd opinion. This can be VERY serious for you and the baby. Take control of the care you are getting and make sure you have the right information to make a decision. <br>  <br>  You didn't say how far along you were. If it's late enough, they will probably want to induce you.  If you are less than 37 weeks or so, they may give you bed rest or talk about an early C-section.<br>  <br>  Don't wait. Get an 2nd and 3rd opinion.  Good luck to you.
de103785bc2af3eaeb12cf72d96e7f9caa	If you weren't charting or testing, maybe you ovulated earlier in your cycle?  It could also be multiples, or rarely a molar pregnancy (which it probably isn't.)   I'd say you've got a good chance at twins though.  Congrats!  :)|`|8wVj8odOaa	I'd say there's a pretty darn good chance you are having multiples.. that or someone messed up the calculation and you are further along.|`|KIZVWREHaa	you could be that is one sign . usually thought the doctor will mention this .|`|b2acf57f08fe6f558c997db984a74b15aa	Fun.  Are you really, really sick???  I don't know if it means that your having twins or triplets but It's going to be on their mind during the ultrasound.|`|E0SJx3Csaa	that is too high even for multiples, either you are further along than they thought or you may have a molar pregnancy.

Are you changing him after he pees and before the diaper gets saggy and loaded down?  It varies for my 22 month old.  If he has a lot of fresh fruits its a lot.  If he eats more than one banana which is a lot - he's a little monkey, I swear, he poos less.|`|p6429zGOaa	I have two little boys and its about four to five diapers each.|`|d0oldPEJaa	I have an 18 month old son and he goes through 4-6 diapers a day.|`|LSJyE4d0aa	Probably around 4|`|150235381859c05acd2860d60d189ed1aa	I change about 10-14 diapers a day.

I asked my doctor they said the pregnacy hormone was just weak at the time, but you are most likely pregnant.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	Pregnant. If you test tomorrow at the same time, the line will be darker. There probably wasn't enough hormones in your system on tuesday and by today there was barely enough for it to show up.

703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	I think it's wonderful she hasn't yet been taken in for an induction or c-section. Has she been in for nonstress tests?  I did two of them during my baby's one week of lateness.  They hook you up to a monitor and give you a little button to push every time the baby moves, and it helps them know if the baby is okay.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry just because of the lateness, though.  Up to 42 weeks is considered okay.  My daughter ended up being 9 days late, and I went into labor on my own.  I'm SO glad I didn't get induced, as I may have ended up with a c-section, which I really didn't want.<br>  <br>  Hope the baby comes soon--good luck!|`|3OmihLtYaa	only like 5% of babies are born on their due date. She should really speak to her doctor about being induced. My doctor was talking about the possibility of being induced a week before my due date. Hey my mother went 18 days late with me and I am fine!
lRq81lu7aa	Take the group to do some activity.  Like a paint-your-own pottery place, the mommy can make stuff for baby's room and everyone else can make something for themselves.  Take her to brunch or lunch and give her some small baby gifts, like the usual clothes or bath items.<br>  <br>  Or if budget is an issue, just take her to lunch and all pitch in for one big gift.<br>  <br>  Either way, I'm sure just having the support of her friends is the greatest give you can give.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!  Have Fun!|`|sFNNDqhGaa	You could do a get to know you game, so even though it is small people get to know each other better. Here is a printable one you could use, <a href="http://partygameideas.com/baby-shower/printable_shower_games_1.php" rel="nofollow">http://partygameideas.com/baby-shower/pr...</a><br>  <br>  Or consider an Advice type (like the View) format, where guests are asked in advance to offer advice on keeping the baby quiet, etc... (get creative). Then take the advice and place photos of the event and advice in a scrapbook. <br>  <br>  I found a list of games and activities, these may inspire or give you ideas.

We did 1 where we filled a bag with 10 differant baby items...& let everyone feel what they were w/out looking & they had to write them all down..it's more difficult then you think...We also measured the pregnant girls tummy with ribbon...& with out showing the guests passed the ribbon around & they cut the ribbon the amount they thought was rite & who ever got closer or hit the write width won a prize...you don't need alot of people for any of these games!!|`|PNqwhlq9aa	Have everyone bring there baby books or pics. and have a fun time looking at them and giving the new mom to be some baby book ideas!
4iXL4C6paa	I wouldnt respond, he doesn't deserve a response, wait until your child starts getting his check and then if he still wants to talk, respond then.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i would message him back and say "i will not talk to you about the legal situation we are in. you have not been here for me or our child since ---. I do not know why you would try to get in contact with me now. Our court date is not far away, we can talk then, in the presence of legal supervisors."<br>  <br>  best of luck hun<br>  <br>  EDIT: the only reason im telling you to message him back is so that he cant be like "i messaged her and tried to get in the babies life but she wouldnt respond or let me blah blah blah"|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Why are you afraid to reply to him?<br>  <br>  Unless you threaten him, there is nothing he can nail you for.Try it.Perhaps he was a scared boy running from his responsibilities.It happens often.<br>  <br>  If he already knows about the child support hearing, I would respond to see what he wants.Just don't get wrapped up if he wants to talk you out of it (sounds like thats not going to happen anyways)<br>  <br>  <br>  He can only have his rights terminated if he signs his rights away.If he wants to have a relationship with his son, why would you want to stop it? better late than never.Your child deserves to know his father and paternal family (granted his father is going to be in his life for sure and not in and out)<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I wouldn't reply but I also don't know what he said. After a year you have no obligation to do so. He can wait until you go to court. If he chooses to end his parental rights he will have no obligations to your child. No child support or anything. I'm not sure of the laws in your state but after a certain point they can terminate them without his consent. And I also have myspace so I can keep in touch with friends and family. I actually reunited with a friend on it.|`|n3IoftMFaa	DO NOT CONTACT HIM. Don't respond to him at all.<br>  <br>  How old are you? Myspace? Really?<br>  <br>  <br>  Get a lawyer and be an adult. You can create your own bad luck.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	Don't contact him back! I know it's killing you but just wait for court. He probably is only gonna show interest because now he has to pay for his child. Trust me, he won't take him away. <br>  <br>  FYI: You can't terminate his parental rights unless there is a parent willing to adopt. Judges just don't do that. You might be able to get him for abandonment but I don't know. Get a lawyer!<br>  <br>  Also, child support and visitation do not go hand in hand. If there is a visitation order in place, you have to abide by it even if he isn't paying. If you don't, he could take you to court for contempt and then possibly get more time with your child.|`|14S2PmqEaa	My daughter is about to turn 6.  She has never seen her sperm donor either.  Do not respond to him.  It just makes the situation worse.  Wait until the hearing and say what you have to say in court.  If he wants a relationship with the child he can file for visitation. He cannot terminate his rights just to get out of paying child support.|`|5duq5DHnaa	Ignore him.<br>  <br>  I don't know how it works where you are but here in GA no contact or even attempted contact in a year or more is basically a termination of parental rights. But thats means no child support. Be aware that paying child support means that he gets visitation. Pick the lesser of two evils. Just don't talk to him.|`|P7q9cNaiaa	I would not say anything to him. You don't want ANYTHING to mess up your court case! I also just think it's ironic that he hasn't spoken to you in a loooong time, then he speaks to you a month before the hearing? he's probably trying to get evidence against you.|`|fiUF4cAXaa	I wouldn't respond back to him. He hasn't spoke to you all this time then all of a sudden he writes you? Could it be because you are taking him to childsupport and he wants to sweet talk you? My ex did the same thing to me and I wound up dropping the case. When the case was closed, he didnt talk to me or the kids again. So I reopened the case and now recieve child support from him. Don't fall for any sweet talk or *** kissing. Remember, it is not about him, it is about your child.|`|p8UOAGSEaa	I feel like if you really don't want to have any doings with this guy then, NO don't respond to him, remember you didn't push him out of your life HE did so it is not your fault that he NOW a year later wants to step in and write you, huh, how phatetic! you should put your myspace private and block him, if he really cared he would have gotten in touch befor now! Hold your head up and take care of your baby, I am a mom of 4 so I can relate. Let the judge tell him for you!
1SGl03Zlaa	If you are going to use bumpers you should look for the breathable ones since they are not as much of a risk for sids.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	yes-mesh or i had a friend who wove a thin fleece blanket in between the slats. it was really tight so it wasnt able to be pulled out and it wasnt fluffy so her daughters face wouldnt smoosh into it. i have thought of doing that myself because my 2nd son was so wiggley when he sleeps! (like me unfortunately)|`|aJLx0nhNaa	We don't have bumpers but we thought about mesh when my son went through a period of rotating himself in his crib (while swaddled sometimes!) and then getting his legs "caught" between the crib rails.  They weren't actually caught, but it stressed him out.  I didn't get the mesh and he stopped doing it that often and it stopped bothering him that much.  Now when I go in in the morning occasionally I see two little feet dangling through the crib rails.<br>  <br>  I have trouble imagining how a baby could break a limb that way.  If they get caught, they scream bloody murder.
28WJwHf4aa	I don't care what race, color, or sexual preference someone, or a couple, is. If they are able to open up their hearts and home to a child, then they should legally be allowed to. There are too many children in need of a family. Why not give them that?? <br>  <br>  I think the reason people may be against it is that it goes against what they believe in (whether it's religious or not). Some people are not as open as others to change in the stereotypical family. Some people are strict "God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve." It's too bad that this mentality is still part of today, but you can't really change some people mind's.|`|8058fcf2650f54ecf2f7caea81639d08aa	many people are ignorant about gays and lesbian and think they shouldn't be able to adopt or marry but if they just educated themselves they would learn there isn't anything that makes them bad or less parents than a heterosexual couple... they won't 'turn' their children to be gay like some like to argue...<br>  they love, they argue, they hurt inside, they get happy about life as we do.. i say some are better fit to be parents then some straight people i've seen.|`|nESfk0bXaa	How about this?<br>  <br>  Adoption is NOT about the PARENTS--it's about what's best for KIDS.<br>  <br>  Wow!  What a concept!<br>  <br>  I think adoption should be like a hefty insurance policy--kids get what they LOST.<br>  <br>  A mother AND a father.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	I usually ignore all requests for homework help, but since you're preparing in advance and only asking for an angle, I'll offer my opinion.<br>  <br>  Adoption is not a right.  This assertion is largely press generated and completely inappropriate.  When adoption becomes a right of prospective parents, adoption will forever change for the worse.  The government is charged with protecting individual rights, and if a right to adopt exists, everything else including the needs of the child and the preference of the natural parents will necessarily be set aside to uphold the 'rights' of prospective parents.  The right to adopt is not currently recognized and that should not change.  Adoption should always focus first and foremost on what is best for the individual child.  The debate should focus on whether individuals should be afforded an equal opportunity to adopt.|`|bc9inzicaa	I personally see no reason to oppose homosexual couples adopting.   The purpose of an adoption is to find loving parents and stability for the child.  So what if the parents turn out to be two moms or two dads?  As long as the child is well cared for and loved that is the most important thing.|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	I believe it doesn't matter if your gay, straight, transsexual, bi, or anything else, as long as you qualify it doesnt matter!! People need to get over it, it's there decision and gay people ARE allowed to adopt, it happens all the time!|`|VzXSC8fiaa	I'm for it as well, but people do not take into consideration tolerance.<br>  <br>  Children are cruel, they will tease you about anything, having two parents of the same sex is a ticket to harassment. This leads to psychological and physical abuse on a daily basis from peers. <br>  <br>  That is the only down side I see about it.
dAQHWvY0aa	This is not gross. It's human, and it's a girl thing. It sounds like it was a cyst, more so than a miscarriage if that's something you are worried about. Did you keep it? or discard it? If you did keep it, just take it with you to the gyno. If it's discarded, no worries - They'll probably do a D&C just to be sure everything is okay, and you'll likely go for an ultrasound to check out your ovaries and where the cyst may have been before it dislodged. If it's no longer there, it will be significantly easier for you to conceive as cysts are known for causing troubles there! <br>  I hope this puts your mind at ease, at least a little...<br>  <br>  EDIT - I didn't say a cyst would STOP you from conceiving - but they are known for causing problems.|`|Bxvs28oBaa	I am sorry to hear that.I belive it was a sist.Hey ,cist won't stop you from having babys.I had cists too and now I am 32 weeks pregnant having a baby boy!|`|9BeGtZAiaa	Sounds like cervical polyps.<br>  Look it up.<br>  See a doctor.<br>  And take very hot showers.<br>  Or dear, kindey stones. Are you sure it came out of your vagina? Because passing something like that through your urethra would cause a bit of bleeding and a hell of a lot of pain.<br>  Oh and the ER are so supposed to make sure you're ok. wtf.<br>  <br>  Best of luck sweetie.
TQScv7Tcaa	I started by adding it to her foods at about 9 months, then at 11 months started putting 2 oz in her bottle and was planning on increasing but got frustrated and by 11 months and 3 weeks she was on whole cows milk and we have never looked back. i think if you have been giving your daughter dairy foods without any reaction she will be fine but if you feel it necessary to do it gradually then go for your life:)|`|Bz8tcAOyaa	My little sister was just started on whole milk right away. She finished up her last container of formula the week after she turned one and the change didn't bother her a bit. (However, the change from the bottle to sippy didn't go so great!)<br>  <br>  As for your daughter, I think you've made the right call. Just keep on gently transitioning her into drinking whole milk ans soon formula/breastmilk will be a thing of the past!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you both :)|`|UghJ0XROaa	I did the 2 oz of milk to 6 oz of formula. It took my daughter from 11 months to 15 months to finally take to straight milk.|`|XOtOMncwaa	I started with one ounce of whole milk and the rest formula, and every 2 days I increased the milk by an ounce, and my son never seemed to be bothered by it, he loves whole milk now, and I found that worked the best for us...
kQEnJpOvaa	Under shirts, onesies annoy me!|`|PE0oyIWtaa	onesies, otherwise their stomach are always popping out.|`|SzPqKdBuaa	I still put my little girl whois also 15 months in the onesies (the one's with the snaps).|`|bKmv7ez1aa	my 19 month old still wears onesies. i like them because u don't have to worry about his t shirt  hanging out of his pants.|`|5dca67bd0dd4aa9a8ea84176747ecb36aa	Bradley still does and he's almost 20 months old.  The long sleeve ones are great and the short sleeve ones are awesome under his pajamas at bedtime.|`|K7f3B4scaa	Once in a blue moon I'll put her in a onesie but she usually wears t-shirts. It's so much easier for me since she is at that stage where she hates to get her diaper changed so I have to be quick about getting her clothes back on. So not having to snap anything help out alot.|`|FMnh59C4aa	No more crotch snap when out and about.  I find regular t-shirts more practical for nappy changes and potty time. Plus he likes to try putting on his own shirts and pants, so regular ones are easier for him to learn.  He's also outgrown most of his onesies, at least in length.  But yea, he still occasionally wears them at home.    Lately though, he likes to pull his shirts up in public.  For that reason I may consider switching back to onesies... lol|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	We still have a few onesies that he wears on occasion with sweats if we're just at home... but most of his 'going out' shirts are just regular. Onesies seem to get too tight on Caleb because he's long... granted the alternative is having his belly hang out of a shirt without snaps (which is the route we usually end up taking) ...mostly because it's easier. It's hard enough trying to do the few buttons on his shoulder these days, added buttons on onesies are a hassle now and I STILL always manage to stupidly get off track with the snaps, even tough there's only 3. So the point of my rambling is to say we still do a little of both, but definitely fewer onesies these days.|`|q595MhH8aa	My 15 month old daughter wears onesies still! However, sometimes when we are out and about, it is more practical with just a regular shirt!!|`|TQW5E6olaa	My 19 month old wear onesies and tee shirts, depends on the outfit or the weather that day.|`|Me4kGy3Baa	well. she's wearing onsies and tights everyday, because it's cold and snowy.  I am honestly getting sick of those, i think it's time for big girl undershirts now.  she's on size 18 months and they are small for her, sometimes i leave it unbuttoned.  so i can get 24 months size onesies....or i can skip it all and go to regular undershirts.      i find my little girl is outgrowing everything, clothes, shoes, bottles, etc, shes only 15 months but she seems mature ever since i found out im pregnant.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	Yes he does! I'll probably stop putting them on him when the summer comes (he'll be 18 months...the maximun size I can find which he is in now).    ETA: He wears onesizes.|`|r52rfBkeaa	My son wears both.  He has cute little boy outfits that are shirts and pants and then he also has onsies that I put him in with a pair of color-coordinating pants if it's warm outside (all of his outfits have long sleeves).  I haven't had a problem with the shirts, no belly sticking out or anything.  I actually think he prefers those...|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	I did, i stopped at around 21 months.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	Since he's been 15 months, he mostly wears t shirts, but occasionally I'll put a long sleeved onesie on him with a t shirt over it.|`|0QYIbn1saa	Eli still wears a onesie.  He is quickly outgrowing them though, the 24 month ones are getting too small!  I'll be switching to undershirts in the spring :)|`|s30Duwdraa	She still wears onesies.      I actually prefer them because it prevents her shirt from riding up and getting a draft.  We live in Ottawa, Canada and it is pretty darn cold in the winter!|`|E5CnUdhsaa	my 14 month old does as i find her trousers rub if i dont but i plan on putting on vests soon instead but she just pulls them out and they rub anyway lol|`|kyEPS7xCaa	Both.|`|ztug2gLjaa	no not anymore...she's been going on the potty lately so I can;t use them.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	Every now and then he will wear a onesie by its self, but not under another shirt.|`|B4Cz1vUEaa	We use both.  It depends on what he is wearing. When it is cold, I prefer the onesies because it keep his tummy covered.
jNQbVDHSaa	well,it depends on baby. many of the posts are the best shots where they edit the crying
PQxXh4Q7aa	My son is a left-handed 7 year old and he like the lefty scissors better.|`|kzyEuRroaa	I'm a left handed adult and still find that the left handed scissors are way better than the ambidexterous ones.

ueDqd80daa	It's her 16th birthday, it's a pretty big one! I'd say get her something small... but meaningful. Bath and Body Works is always a good solution!|`|T09RNC12aa	Nah, would seem a bit wierd. Maybe just a card to be friendly, i'm sure she would appreciate that :)|`|NAkQdoYlaa	A box of chocolates and a card! You don't know her very well so it's a nice gesture but not over the top!    Good luck! :-)|`|7JifOuGCaa	no i think its sweet, get her perfume if i was you, this wont seem weird at all, it just shows you were thinking of her, i would do the same if i was in ur boat|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	A card would be enough.|`|b10aMPdOaa	How thoughful of you.  Go for it.  How about a nice bath set.  Can't go wrong there.  Good luck|`|ISKM1z8iaa	I would say a card and maybe a small present. Not more than a couple of quid.|`|LDLTjNCraa	Just get her a card.|`|em8A42Bqaa	I think that it is okay.  A card and a small gift set or something.  Nothing huge just a small gesture would be nice|`|snsRyuqyaa	Well a bit weird seeing as you hardly talk but if you want to a card is a nice gesture with some chocolates|`|6gthdHpnaa	It would be nice of you, but just get something small. Ask your boyfriend if you're not sure.|`|09xCfB9Faa	just get her somethin that you would like. I doubt she wud think u was weird jus becuase u got her a present for her birthday. If you dont no wat to buy her maybe vouchers would be a better idea or just a card.|`|t2XOjDy4aa	I think it would be a bit odd. I wouldn't worry about it. You are so young. It would be different if you were in your 20s, and you knew her. That is not the case . Save your money, or in your case your parents money :)|`|qKY3GZEJaa	no i had the same problem im also 13 bin wid my bf 5months , his sister had hur 16th birthday and i only say like hi uk ect.. i got her box of chocolats nottin too big , she thought it was cool and were accually pritty good mate now ;)
prqrQcd1aa	If you get that w-2 form, then yeah, file taxes. You can claim EIC for the child and actually get all of your federal taxes back, plus some extra as well! <br>  You can get the forms online 1040 are the ones you want to look for. <br>  Go to www.irs.com to get them.|`|EMKuBql8aa	You first need to call that job up and insist on a W-2 form. Once you get that, you can go on turbotax.com and they have something on there for free that helps you do your taxes, it is very simple and self explanatory. If you made more then $500 you legally have to file or you will owe back fee's and penalties.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You get them back depending on how you file. If you have the return go directly into your account, it's 8 to 14 days. But if it is sent to you through the mail, it can take up to 3 weeks. You didn't work much, so don't expect too much back.<br>  <br>  Do them now, you have until April to file them.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	there is always a point to doing your taxes, you paid the state and federal government money, now it's time to get that money back. Ypu can do your taxes as soon as you get all of your W2 forms from your employer(s) once you have those just go down to your local post office and you can pick up all the needed forms.
IkuZj0Lbaa	I started having braxton hicks contractions about 35 weeks. He didn't drop for me until I was 37 weeks, but he decided to come back up a bit lol. Pressure and pain in the pelvis is a sign of dropping. Normally when you start going to weekly appointments your doctor should check your cervix everytime. I've been in early labor for the last 2 weeks, thought he might come early, since I've been 90 percent effaced and two cm dilated. :) But he's lazy and doesn't want to come yet lol.|`|yB5go5wbaa	He may have dropped, but they can drop weeks before you actually give birth.  I've been carrying very low my whole pregnancy and he's been head down too, and I'm overdue!    The hurting is likely the baby's head bouncing around in there, but he's protected from the amniotic fluid in the womb :)  As they get bigger, their heads feel like they're going to fall out...have the doctor check though - it's worth it (and encouraging) to at least know if he's dropped or if you're dilated at all!|`|s6stLtvLaa	Your doctor might check your cervix anyways.  And if your doctor doesn't, you could ask.  If you are feeling pressure in your pelvic area then your baby has dropped.  That doesn't mean you will go into labor anytime soon.  The same goes for the braxton hix contractions.  You could have those weeks before you actually go into labor.  When your doctor feels your cervix he/she will better be able to tall you where you are.  at 36 weeks my doctor striped my membranes to try and get me to go into labor (it was either I got into labor or have a C-section at 38 weeks).  2 days later, my water broke.  My son had been sitting low for a month prior and I had been having braxton hix contractions for weeks! not to mention at 35 weeks I started loosing my mucus plug.|`|cfdooGylaa	Well at 35 weeks your doctor will probably check your cervix anyway. Just tell him that you have been feeling a lot of pelvic pain and pressure. It does sound like the baby has become more engaged and this stuff is absolutely normal. No way of telling if you could have your baby early though. Good luck.
IGfnrfGPaa	I got one big box of of pampers swaddlers in advance, that's it. It contained 200+ diapers and I figured that would be enough for a few days until I could get more. I did not register for diapers, but for other useful things (clothes, toiletries, pack & play, vibrating bouncer, etc) <br>  Congrats on the little one, Good Luck!!!|`|jQwYoRCXaa	i personally wouldnt stock up again, i did with my first. she ended up outgrowing them faster then i could use them. not to mention when she was first born she wore premies, so i had to go buy them...not that big of a deal, but i had to drag her out in november. my son however wore the same size dipars for months and months...all babies grow at different speeds...also you never know what brand you want to use...i have had people recommend pampers, luvs and whatever other brands. i personally love huggies supremes, but thats me.|`|1bnhwGACaa	im going to buy some and we are doing a raffle at my shower if you bring a thing of diapers your name gets put in a drawing for a prize (gift card ) i remember how many diapers my little guy went through i am going to buy size 1 and 2 for now and maybe 2 of 3 so i have them<br>  most likely your baby wont be allergic|`|AtVRWrwCaa	That is surprising that Walmart wouldn't take them... hmm... lol<br>  <br>  I'm planning on stocking up. If my baby ends up being allergic and I'm in the same position as your friend with no receipts, I would flat out give them away or donate them. There are plenty of people out there who will need them if I don't. <br>  <br>  If you feel more comfortable buying them yourself though, go for it!<br>  <br>  Good luck with your baby!|`|1qxhPyXzaa	With all three of my kids I stocked up with about 6 pkgs of newborns, 10 of 1's.  Between breastfeeding and having sleep and plays we were pretty well sent for like 6 months!!!  Didn't have to worry about money, or going out at the last minuet.  I recommend it to all my friends, it was a savior.  As for the allergy, very few babies are allergic.  And as for the registering thing, let them buy the "fun" stuff and you buy the diapers.  When I bought them I taped the receipt to them  ( I bought one each trip to the grocery starting as soon as i knew I was PG).  I didn't have any trouble exchanging without a receipt.  Good luck and best wishes!!!!!!!!!

prqrQcd1aa	YES, Cora was on Ablify and it worked great for her, her dosage to begin with, as well as any one else that i have known with bi polar disorder has always been 5-10 mg to begin with. That usually solves the problem and they don't need more...usually! She had a lot of weight gain from this though and I had to take her off of it. This is not common in adults though, so maybe since your son is older it won't be a problem with him either. <br>  <br>  At first she was given concerta along with the ablify i can't remember the dosage as she was taken right off of it for the simple reason it was making her "cycle" as you have read about. <br>  <br>  Abilfy is not only for bi polar but also for scizophrenia, it is an atypical anti--psychotic. (that is it's drug class)<br>  <br>  Ok, on to his diagnosis... conduct disorder is usually the 'initial" diagnosis that they give to a child going through these kinds of things, as more help is gotten and more observations are done, then they go to the ADHD, ODD types of things. That is too what they did with my child. ODD is a "conduct disorder", just as bi polar is a mood disorder.<br>  <br>  Cora's treatment plans for this do not include her ADHD side for medicines. She is on an anti depressant (effexor) and an anti psychotic (geodon). ADHD has many of the same symptoms as bi polar does, but exit out the depression... and bi polar the sypmtoms are worse, and last longer, especially in children...or they can even be more like rapid cycling in children.<br>  <br>  Major depression is not bi polar. That is Manic depression.. they use to call bi polar disorder manic depression. Major depression (if diagnosed correctly) is something different than bi polar disorder because there is no "manic" side to it, but once again sometimes the doctor's diagnosing this don't see that manic side. <br>  <br>  Yes, a doctor should have looked at any family history of "mood disorders" when making a diagnosis on your son.. they did with my daughter. <br>  <br>  You know my email if you need to get ahold of me! :) Hope things are starting to look a little better!|`|pnL5WTXMaa	adhd and bipolar are frequently confused because the symptoms especially in children are very similar. i don't know how old your son is but this may be the case. i would have him OFF the ritialin. ask for a mood stabilizer - maybe abilify will prove helpful. i've heard good things about it and i am not a pro-med type - good luck.
OJ0POy4Xaa	I had one in for 2 years. For the first 6 months or so my periods were kind of "off" but then straightened back out. Sex was same as before, no pain. <br>  I really like it. I only got it out because I'm planning my next baby. I would get it again but my next will be my last so I'm going for something permanent. I do recommend it a lot, it is the most convenient birth control I've ever heard of.|`|NQGpw0x4aa	i assume you're getting mirena . . .<br>  <br>  i got one inserted on december 2nd. i've never had a kid. it hurt so bad for the first month. now after i have an orgasm i have severe pain. but you won't feel it during sex and it's increased my pleasure. it could be different for you with the pain though because you've had a child. and mine is in it's correct position (i've had 2 sono's to check it)|`|91db67023fc6e1186360fd9330d83699aa	Iud does not interfere in sex.I had it for 4 yrs and now again after my second baby its been 1 month after that its fine.Iuc secrets hormone that may show some period or early pregnancy like symptoms but still it wont effect your sex pleasure.I used iud both the time and its perfectly fine.
fbWfvjkWaa	I asked the nurse that just did my blood pregnancy test Tuesday that and she told me if they took your blood from the long red tube than they can do up to 3 or 4 tests with that blood but if they used the little purple or green one than that is only one test. Hope that helps.|`|R36nThwLaa	yea, they keep it....

Its just so hard switching from a lifestyle of carefree giddy-ness about the planet to suddenly my daughter's never going to see a polar bear, you know?

n3IoftMFaa	It is diarrhea - watch it for a couple of days. make sure he is drinking - breast or bottle?<br>  The only colors you need to really freak about are red (blood), white (white blood cells) and black (bile or old blood). Clay colored poop is also bad but not a "run to the doctor" bad.|`|kxmp3M58aa	well i think you and ur baby should go to talk with a doctor and i am not meanint that in a mean way
b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	If you just began taking the metiformin for PCOS It may take a few months to work.  I know that it is hard when you want someting so bad.  The good thing is you have found the possible cause of your infertility and with proper treatment pregnancy will most likely be in your future.|`|7uqOSZNKaa	i cant answer this question, but i just wanna say i feel for you right now x Just don't give up. i will keep my fingers crossed for you x|`|4DoXomHZaa	What if you don't ovulate? Then you try again next month.     Getting yourself so obviously worked up over somethign you cannot control will not help you conceive. Stress hormones can affect cycles and you may very well be delaying or preventing things.    Relax. Just keep having sex and be patient. Mankind can only mess with Mother Nature so much. Sometimes she does not cooperate right away.|`|DDswEgtZaa	maybe you ovulate late, that is how i am.  I get a +OPK on CL19 and ovulate on CL 21.  Hang in there and keep testing and BDing.  Try not to stress out too much and let things fall into place.  Good luck and baby dust to you!
Coc593Ikaa	For what it is worth, I'm a doctor. Not that kind of doctor, but a doctor nonetheless.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Not all of us can afford to see a doctor for things like those questions. You must have proof of pregnancy to get state help with medical care. 200 to 300 dollar appointments for false alarms are to much. Just ignore if you are irrated with them.|`|HXh7u0lEaa	I agree these questions can be annoying because you get so many, but I also understand that some people don't have insurance to go to the Dr (in USA - very glad I live in Australia and have medicare) or they really want a baby and just can't wait for a pregnancy test. After all the answering of questions on here is optional just ignore the do you think I am pregnant? ones.|`|F3ArhTiRaa	if you're getting paranoid sometimes your mind doesn't work well so even if you know what to do you seem to ask and ask anybody.  just try to understand them.|`|IPsjE9Rpaa	If you think your preg take a damn blood test it'll tell you 100% yes or freaken no!............|`|Pfge6j7Aaa	SO what exactly is your question???
256cVXsmaa	nope me and my boyfriend were dating for 3 years using the pull out method EVERYDAY.  Now I am pregnant 3 years later...  Sometimes people are just very lucky, sometimes not so lucky.  I consider myself lucky that I hadn't gotten pregnant for 3 years, I was so irresponsible with sex.  But look at me nowwww|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	...its not surprising but you should be careful...just in case  get on birthcontrol or use condoms      my husband had been using the pullout method with bc for 2 years before we found out ...|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	Not really. The rhythm method worked for my husband and i for quite awhile.|`|YSoBO3tpaa	lol.....yeah i never really use a condom either...but its glad to here that others do the "pull out" cuz i starting thinking i might be not be sterile on a few ocassions where i couldn't believe she didn't get pregnant... .|`|a732cc20369212fe385773a398cdf5b8aa	first off the pull out method is the dumbest form of birth control because even though u havent yet you can definitely still get pregnant even if he is pulling out there is pre *** still going into you that has like millions of sperm in the pre *** he can pull out when he pre cums it just happens so my suggestion would be if u dont want kids go to planned parenthood they have free birth control|`|ueDqd80daa	You're lucky! I've been with mine for 6 months and now I'm pregnant!|`|NAzAmFDnaa	since you are only using the pull out method, you must being trying to make a baby.  why are you trying to get pregnant before you are married?  please don't insult those people who know how to use responsible birth control.  I hope your boyfriend doesn't leave you when you do become pregnant, and I also hope you don't live in Michigan because I don't want my tax dollars to go toward your welfare and WIC when you do get pregnant.|`|e7bc222fa0b57adc181abe207a015454aa	It's only a matter of time until you will be pacing the aisle in front of the pregnancy tests!   If you don't want to get pregnant, then I would suggest being smart and using some birth control instead of bragging that you made it this far without getting knocked up.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Yes, that is very uncommon.  There are of course many other factors that play a part in this such as his sperm count and how fertile you are.  Some people don't pull out at all and try to get pregnant for years with no luck.  But every person I know who used the pull-out method got pregnant in less than a year.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	you just got lucky, and you WILL get pregnant.   dont jinx it, get on birth control.|`|N6XTcGejaa	not suprising. it is risky but sussecful on a lot of people.|`|Lx5vYz9jaa	yeah it worked with me for about 3 years and then i eventually got on birth control and then i got pregnant... (which was fine because we were talking about having a baby anyways)  but once i got on the pill he didn't pull out anymore.|`|qicxk5GMaa	no.  i was with my fiance 8 years doing the same thing and never got pregnant until 3 months after we tried.|`|D6asmqFVaa	don't count on it too much longer.|`|RVCeDnsvaa	not really, i've used this method before without so much as a scare. i will say that i have friends that were not so lucky using this method. I completely agree that the pill is horrible and unhealthy for women.   you should try alternate forms of birth control.   My bf and I used vaginal contraceptive film and sponges and never had any problems.   they are just like having sex without using anything, except with the vcf, you get discharge from the spermicide following sex. the sponges however are virtually mess free and it still feels like you are using nothing. i personally love these.  good luck:)|`|eEK3m1aXaa	Not at all.   When my husband and I were dating, we used that method for over three years and I never got pregnant.       ~_~|`|gx4s68s8aa	Not really- my husband and I used it for 18 months without getting pregnant.  We were unsure if we wanted kids yet, so we thought if it happens it happens.  Then we realized we were ready for a baby and we got pregnant quickly tracking my cycle.    So after our daughter's birth, I found out that I couldn't go on birth control pills again because of a clotting disorder discovered while pregnant.  So after I was done breast feeding (and on the mini pill) we used the pull out method -one time.  And that one time got me pregnant, even though I was almost 35 years old at the time.    So now I am 31 weeks pregnant with baby  2.  Thankfully we were likely going to try for another baby, just not as soon as it happened.    So bottom line- if pregnancy would mess up your life a lot, then stop using the pull-out method.  If you don't mind getting pregnant, then go ahead and keep it up.
sVbZEWveaa	I have a 17 year old and I took a very different kind of parenting. I was definitely a friend at first and then that is where the trust was built. Your niece is already showing that she can't be trusted and even though you are not her mother you are the one that is there and you have to take control even if she doesn't like it. It doesn't matter that is her aunt or not her aunt. You are in control and you need to reel her in. Her going out is a privilege and if she is not going to be trusted then you can't go out. Be her friend but also show her that you are there to take care of her and that you are not always going to be a friend. I am a friend before I am anything. I hang out with my 17 year old. Her friends text me and I talk to them I have them as friends on myspace but when it comes to my child doing something stupid I will not allow that. I know that kids will be kids but what there has to be is parental respect and right now you are the parent. Put the rules and make sure she follows them and the more she is able to follow the rules the more privileges she receives.|`|yV373JUiaa	You know what I am helping out my boss's family right now because they were in a similar situation. "ava" her niece didn't like having rules so another family member took her in because they  said my boss "julie" was abusing her by setting limits. <br>  <br>  Well she is now back with Julie only she is now 15 and pregnant because everyone wanted to act like her friend.<br>  <br>  There should be rules, but make sure they are out of saftey and nessesity. <br>  <br>  She should have a weeknight curfew, you should always know where she is. <br>  <br>  She can can up a day of the week that she spends at her aunts (or two if you feel she deserves it) and she lose that day if she happens to be grounded on it. <br>  <br>  One of the best ways to talk to a teenager is to talk to them like an adult. If you come at her with rules and your tone is condesending she will put up her defences and ignore you. Just explain over a cup of coffee or something that she needs to have some rules.|`|jO9ybkv0aa	Most of the teenagers think that they are right in all things. <br>  <br>  You should extend your patience and love. I know that she feel that you care. <br>  <br>  Just always be at her side whether in good or bad times, always be open and ready to give advice. <br>  <br>  Try to create harmonious relationship.<br>  <br>  Good luck and God Bless...|`|gonBCGpNaa	She sounds like a normal 14 year old girl who is balking at rules. Their lives are about being social, going places and seeing friends. Kids get grounded-it's good that you and your husband are setting rules and sticking to them. Being consistent is very important, especially with a teen. Make the rules, and be prepared to deal with the resistance she'll have to them. Try not to be annoyed with her. She sounds like she's been through a lot and needs understanding, consistency and love. Hang in there, it's awesome what you're doing for her!|`|h4LdsMjPaa	I'm 14 and I want to always go somewhere, but never can. I think staying up late like this every night doing homework, deserve to go out. I dont think I should go out EVERY night because thats wrong but friends are the most important thing right now you just have to trust that there not going to do something bad. To much freedom can lead to a bad thing. I like to hang out with friends but I would love to hang out with my parents more often. there always working. So if you are around her a lot she better injoy that because thats something I don't have.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped you.|`|mWcZFT9paa	Be honest with her regarding your intentions, stick to what you say you will do, ie - follow through consistently.  <br>  <br>  But most importantly in my opinion is to use positive reward far more frequently than punishment.  This is hard to do, somtimes, but you have to giver her opportunities - even tiny ones to do something good.  Then the reward  can be as simple as a little praise.  A few kind words, or just take a moment to talk about anything she wants to talk about.
7VJcd5YLaa	Since my daughter's birthday falls with Easter (this year is her 8th - and a very important one for us as she will become eligible to be baptised on her birthday/Easter), we decided after seeing the amount of Easter Bunny/birthday stuff that comes together (we did that for two years - and that was enough for us!) - and the potential loss of the spiritual nature of Easter - we celebrate the Easter Bunny stuff the week before or week after Easter - depending on how her birthday falls - this spreads everything out and allows the fun of candy, etc. without it overshadowing our day of worship.<br>  <br>  Now that they are older and some kids have commented on the oddness of the Easter Bunny's visit not being on Easter Sunday - we have them write a letter each year requesting an appointment for the day that we have chosen as a family.  Works fine for us.<br>  <br>  Bravo on wanting to keep Easter as a sacred day!|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	I don't see anything wrong with that.  I grew up in a Christian home, and they felt it was important to seperate the Christmas ideas.  Eve was always about the religious stuff and Day was all about Santa and presents.  They never really seperated the whole Easter thing...but I can see how that'd make sense if you are religious.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I don't think there is anything wrong with that at all! In fact that is the way it should be if you are religious. Easter is actually based on a pagan holiday, and now days we rarely even celebrate what it's "really" there for. It is as over marketed as Christmas is, and I don't think that is right either.|`|EMKuBql8aa	That's what we do cause we feel it is important to focus Sunday on religious activities, not something that is essentially a fun game. <br>  <br>  I think it is perfect, well, maybe I'm biased cause we do it, lol.|`|UMRdHuuVaa	AH love, easter bunny and easter are two peas in a pod.|`|Mm5NsrF8aa	I think you are over thinking! It sounds like you do want to celebrate both the bunny and the resurrection...don't make it more difficult or confusing for all involved. Your child will be more excited about the fuzzy bunny, eggs, candy etc, for the next few years...so what? As long as you celebrate the religious side as well they'll get it as they grow up with all your traditions and teachings...As soon as they are in school they'll be arguing with the other kids, no the Easter Bunny comes on Saturday, not Sunday...or that Santa comes tomorrow when Christmas is 2 days away...We did have Santa come on the 23rd one year before my kids were in school because both my husband and I had to work early Christmas Day, and we didn't want to miss the Christmas morning Santa gift excitement!|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Go for it!  <br>  <br>  We don't really celebrate the Christian religious part of Easter - we go more for the spring/earth renewal/rebirth angle, so bunny fits in just fine for us on Sunday.  But, you should create your own traditions that work well with your family.  <br>  <br>  Check out your local park district, too.  Odds are they'll have Easter Bunny stuff going on on Easter Saturday, anyway - making it all make more sense for your child over the years.
PFO1jxZGaa	well my daughter is 18 mos and she does it because she thinks its funny. She will strech her legs straight and not let me take her diaper out or she will arch her back and move her butt around... So I would guess by the time she is potty trained she will stop :)|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	this is a temper tantrum thing. sounds like you have a very smart little boy on your hands that already knows how to manipulate you.  i would just look him in the eye and say, no. a firm no & then he'll prob. fight you on it because it doesn't sound like you've set any boundaries with him.  just be consistent and it will work.  you are in control, you are the parent.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	*lol* He wants to go, go, go!    http://www.kellymom.com/pantley/pantley1...  Im sure youve all been there. By the way, David is my son. Like you, I got very tired of this. And then I discovered a better way:        Parent: (Picking up diaper and holding it like a puppet, making it talk in a silly, squeaky voice) Hi David! Im Dilly Diaper! Come here and play with me!        David: (Running over to Diaper) Hi Dilly!        Parent as Diaper: Youre such a nice boy. Will you give me a kiss?        David: Yes. (Gives diaper a kiss)        Parent as Diaper: How bout a nice hug?        David: (Giggles and hugs Diaper)        Parent as Diaper: Lie right here next to me. Right here. Yup. Can I go on you? Oh yes?! Goody goody goody! (The diaper chats with David while hes being changed. Then it says, Oh, David! Listen, I hear your shoes calling you  David! David!    The most amazing thing about this trick is that it works over and over and over and over. Youll keep thinking, Hes not honestly going to fall for this again? But he will! Probably the nicest by-product of this method is that it gets you in a good mood and you have a little fun time with your child.    When youve got a toddler this technique is a pure lifesaver. When my son David was little I used this all the time. (I now use it with my youngest child, Coleton, who just turned two!) Remembering back to one day, when David was almost three, we were waiting in a long line at the grocery store and I was making my hand talk to him. He was hugging my hand and looked up at me and said, Mommy, I love for you to pretend this hand is talking.    Another day, after I had called David to the table for dinner a number of times, he calmly looked up at me, chubby hands on padded hips and said, Mommy, why dont you have my dinner call to me?    And suddenly, the peas on his plate came to life and called out to David; he ran over to join us at the dinner table.    A variation on this technique, that also works very well, is to capitalize on a young childs vivid imagination as a way to thwart negative emotions. Pretend to find a trail of caterpillars on the way to the store, hop to the car like a bunny, or pretend a carrot gives you magic powers as you eat it.    Its delightful to see how a potentially negative situation can be turned into a fun experience by changing a childs focus to fantasy.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	It is NOT a boy thing :) They do get through it though. Keep some small toys or books that you only show him during change times so they are novel and exciting. Good Luck.|`|r5R2nstRaa	of course he'll grow out of it! maybe you should try to make changing your baby into a fun time. sing a song while changing. obviously he's not liking the experience. so be gentle, try not to get upset when he's not being still. if you over react, the he will too. good luck!|`|xL16bC3waa	No there is nothing abnormal about this. My 6 os old does the same thing, she is a girl though. They have learned that they can move and roll, so they always want to when the timing is bad. For example when you put clothes on them. Yes, he most likely will grow out of this. It is something that a lot a babies do. I have 2 and they both have done it.|`|3KyVMVncaa	Ha ha!!! Nope, sorry, its just the beginning! My daughter is 17 months old and runs away while I try to change her. Try to distract him by letting him hold a favorite toy or even something he isn't allowed to hold like a phone or remote. That worked for my daughter. Good luck!|`|qStmw7qgaa	Nope.  My 8 month old niece does the EXACT same thing.  It is pretty much you are keeping them from playing and moving around.  They just want to be Mobile, so when you need them to hold still, they don't want to.  My niece has almost squirmed herself off the changing table.  She just didn't want to be contained.|`|7009418e24ad1def37deaede6f243f56aa	Probably normal for some babies. Good news is he will be trained fairly soon, hopefully.|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	LOL awww lil man. Yes he will grow out of it soon. My daughter thinks pamper changing time is funny time she kicks her legs and laughs and she only 3 months old...    I wouldn't say its a boy thing but most babies are that way I have no idea why|`|WG941bbDaa	I've taken care of alot of children...and no I wouldn't say it's a "boy thing"  I think it's just a baby thing..lol.  I've had all kinds of babies do this to me..lol.  I think it's just a phase.  All the kids that have done this to me see to be around the same age.  Don't worry...stick with it!
p2Njf5gBaa	I loved my boppy from day one.  It was great for nursing, my son would snuggle up next to me in it and I would have my hands free to read.     I used it for tummy time as well, and that worked well.   When my son was learning to sit, I would sit him in it for support.  It was really great for that.    When my son switched to bottle and held his own bottle but didn't like to be held, I would lay him in his boppy to drink his bottle.    When learning to crawl he loved to crawl over it over and over again.    I also like to snuggle with it and use it as a pillow on the couch.  I have had tons of use for it,  it has been in our living room and travels with us from my sons birth until right now, he is 12 months old.|`|FplTPoAyaa	We used a boppy when our baby was young.  I used it to feed her (I laid it on my lap and used it to prop up my arms).  We also used it for her tummy time...she was able to hold her head up more easily that way.  I didn't find it to be a necessity, but it was nice to have around.|`|333c5241bfa6c1a5e5841be0e72681faaa	The boppy is one of the coolest tricks of the trade.  You can use the boppy to help baby with tummy time, to help prop him up for feeding himself a bottle, or to provide a barrier so he doesn't roll away unexpectedly.  When my daughter was learning to sit up on her own last month, the boppy was excellent support.  I have three and use them all.  They're just very convenient tools, almost like a 3rd arm we all wish we had.|`|YEqQZgs5aa	I have 2, I breastfeed and my baby is 3 months I used it for maybe the first week and have not touched it since???  everyone else I knew swore by it???  I use a rolled up towel to put under him where he hates being flat on his tummy, I put it across his chest just under his armpits - Same as a boppy and much cheaper... I wouldnt waste your money - OR if you really want on they have generic brand ones... not sure where to find them!    Good luck
FVD1tpLeaa	Well it certainly wouldn't change the way I feel about them.  I'll love them to the ends of the earth and back regardless.    I may be a little sad, only because I know too well how difficult it can be for gay people out in the world at times.  Knowing that they will be discriminated against is upsetting, but I plan on raising very strong individuals, so I know that they'll be able to handle anything the world throws at them.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	w'ever|`|44OH7Si6aa	Cool, at least I don't have to worry about teen pregnancy  They are still the same kids I gave birth to and have been raising, as long as they end up with someone that makes them happy and treats them right I don't care what gender that person is. I would like to have some grand kids latter on in life though so they still have to make that happen somehow|`|faPKwClPaa	It would not matter to me.|`|PlmT4lHXaa	Wouldn't care as long as they were happy and if anyone picked on them id beat their @$$|`|s1zitZMOaa	The gender of whoever my child grows up to fall in love with is the least of my concerns. I care about things like my child being   -happy  -kind  -a decent human being  -getting an education  -living  a  good life    My daughter's sexual preference just isn't an issue.|`|QZBGIOygaa	honestly i wouldn't care that much, i would worry about prejudice from other people, but that is just because no mother likes to see their child suffer.  My son is now 6 and if he turns out to be gay, it really doesn't bother me at all at least i wouldn't have to deal with the daughter in law LOL.|`|r07BwhO1aa	I would not care, I would love my child regardless.      It is not my place to tell her how to live her life, it would just mean no more sleep overs!!  LOL|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Same way I'd feel if he ended up straight. I'd love him and tell him to be good to his partner and make sure his partner is good to him.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I would say good for them|`|lSAdkvDFaa	the same as before he said he was gay! I'm an advocate for equal opps' so I dont care as long as he's happy.  x|`|NAzAmFDnaa	I would be perfectly fine, not disapponted at all.  I would only worry for my son's saftey and might advocate that he not "come out" to his peers until he gets to college where people are much more open minded.  We live in a close-minded community and he probably wouldn't find much peer support here.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	it is ok with me but sad for them   ppl are mean to gay ppl so that would be hard|`|1cYPOJkqaa	It's so nice seeing all these supporting parents. I'm planning to come out to my parents soon and it is great seeing about 20 parents saying they love their kids no matter what.     But obviously I'd love my kids (not that I have any yet) if they came out.|`|8ss15aSOaa	I would let my child be who they are and support them with it.  Gay or straight, love them all the same.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Would love him just the same.  I'd only worry about other people messing with him or her.|`|mEftCx29aa	Well my mom new i was gay but i changed due to church and still changing but I Know she was devastated|`|nfzQkvqraa	I would feel the same way I felt before I knew that my child was gay.|`|LvywvZSeaa	I think that I would be disappointed, but I would never let them know that. I do now, and I always will accept them for who they are. I would love them gay or straight. It may make me uncomfortable, but I am sure that the way I live would make some people uncomfortable too. I love my kids, and i would support them no matter what, bottom line.|`|0QYIbn1saa	As proud of him as i would if he were straight.  A good parent doesn't judge their child on their sexual orientation.|`|YrjkOttiaa	Wouldn't bother me in the slightest.  I love my daughter no matter what.|`|i2wbADHbaa	I wouldn't care who they were sleeping with as long as they were happy and healthy and looked after themselves.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	The same as I would feel if my children turned out to be heterosexual.|`|rlhsdcAXaa	I'm 16 now but in the future when I have kids and one of them came to me and said that they're gay, I'd still love them no matter what.|`|2e21f9ec23823826237a754b253ac6faaa	his choice..|`|18e6c6ba7e558bb945b46902f7a5f9fbaa	truth i would be a little disappointed but i would never let her know how i feel as i would be happy knowing shes happy and that's all that matters|`|hmhrHqD1aa	Theres nothing wrong with being gay. Modern day its becoming more noticed and understanded. Dont flip out, you'll just scare them which could lead to something stupid. Good luck|`|BEXwAnxwaa	I love my children, if they are gay or straight doesn't come into it at all, wouldn't bother me in the slightest, at the end of the day they would still be my children and i will support them no matter what.|`|fdceaa401c42420a6b05129fc81a4757aa	I can hand on heart say I wouldn't be bothered in the slightest. I have two boys and as long as they were happy and being safe, I say each to their own x|`|a35650a2d4dd8438b175c12703752380aa	To be quite honest i wouldn't care if either of my boys turned out to be gay as long as they were safe and happy and their partner loved them as we do then that's good there are far worse things in the world than gay children
IKpYZqAiaa	KayCee Rich|`|35JIECGRaa	KayCee Rich ... seems more like a name, and less of an initial (KC).|`|Am54a7c0aa	Kaycee, even though I don't like it but it is more of a name than KB.|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	KayCee.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	kaycee alone is better, but your opinion matters more because this is your baby.|`|igvUbqkyaa	Well KB is not a name - those are initials, so I guess KayCee, but I really don't like either.|`|4VE5hQIhaa	deyanira,carmen,isabel,sofia,graciela,el...|`|B7nqTcttaa	KayCee Rich I guess, KB would be better spelled out...

b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	The same people give me crap for having three ... so don't worry, you're not alone. I am so sick to death of hearing "Why would you want more?!" or "You're brave!" or (before we got pregnant this time) "Oh, a boy and a girl, the *perfect* family!" It's enough to make me want to smack some people. They love to offer opinions on your fertility and parenting, etc. as if they actually have a say in the matter.     Just roll your eyes and walk away! LOL|`|vue9NOhYaa	I have only one child, and to be honest, I can't recall anyone ever giving me grief about it.  They may have asked if I planned on having more, but nobody was ever shocked or offended when I said no.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	People everywhere believe they have the right to not only have but VOICE an opinion on everyone else.  Gets old, doesn't it?  Lest you think you are singled out, let me tell you that I hear all the time "You have HOW many kids?"  People can not understand why anyone would  want to have more than two or three.  I get it too, so you are not alone.  Do what I do~~~  smile and pretend that you don't even notice they are being insulting, and then turn around and go live your life in happiness.    Works for me.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	PPL need to mind their own damn business. I dont have any, I dont want any. My choice, my business.     I always get criticized for it.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	I was an only child and it sucked but hey you are the parents not them.  Lol they dont have any say in it and need to shut up honsetly.  I think i'm more imaginative and get bored less than other kids do with siblings though, so theres perks to both.  Yea  no matter what theres always criticism about everything isnt there...?  I dont know if they are jealous its just not the way they do it.|`|W8UZebRWaa	People gave us stuff for it too. I just tell them look it's my body and our choice. I was sick the entire pregnancy and we only want one.  End of story, if they don't like it thats fine.|`|nhp2yh0Vaa	Its okay to say you only want one kidd buttt.. u cant predict the future and shouldn't say anything about the future because u dont kno wat god has in store for u and if u dont belive in god den soorry idk wat to tell ya.   why are they so shocked idk? its not that shocking to say u only want one kid and they wont be lonley cussins friends but until he or she is that old den the parents  should always be around never leave him with a baby sister ughh!|`|s1zitZMOaa	People who are the grief giving type will always come up with things to give grief about. We've got one and we honestly don't know if we'll end up with more than one or not. Our daughter is adopted and so we really don't know how things will end up. When people ask us if we'll have more we just say "we're more focused on raising the one we have now at this point." - cause at this point that's pretty much the truth.     Plus, I know a woman who when she was going to adopt her second child her brother told her she shouldn't because "having a sibling can ruin your life" - yes, her own brother told her this. So some people obviously think it would be better to be an only child.|`|61eadcf38f72b14203ed398198796d52aa	I always get people saying "Oh, I thought I'd only want one after my first too, but you'll change your mind".  Occasionally I will point out to them that even if I do change my mind, it won't matter because I got fixed, and then they launch into how horrible my doctor is for letting a 29 year old woman with a 43 year old husband decide to have a tubal ligation.     As far as the "it's not fair" business - I like to point out that even though your kids may play together, it doesn't really net you anymore time because when there are two, they fight - I have been to my friends houses who have 2 kids, and all you hear is "Mom, (s)he's touching me", "Mom, (s)he's touching my stuff", "Mom, (s)he's looking at me funny, make him/her stop!" - and I will never have to deal with that.  I think their arguments are thin at best.      There are positives and negatives to both sides, but I have never heard the parent of an only child tell the parent of multiple children that they made a mistake having more than one.  I don't understand why parents of more than one child can't extend the same courtesy.      Anyway, when it comes to bringing a life into the world, I would rather err on the side of caution - if I am right and we really do only want one, how "fair" would it be to the second child?|`|32747dcd374c857319720ae0aa088b0faa	I have 2 kids, but wasn't planning on more than one (life is full of surprises). I am always stunned at how many people actually think how many kids other people have is any of their business at all.    As my oldest was 12 before baby number 2 came along, I often heard such talk over those years. I was over it the first few times people who barely knew me thought it was ok to spout such stuff.  I just started saying, in a very matter-of-fact manner, "We don't want more children, and we don't feel the need to have more just because others think it's the thing to do. We're happy with our life the way it is, and have no plans to change anything about it." Then I would launch into a whole different subject, letting them know that part of the conversation was over. It always worked.|`|dDVAUA9saa	My sister's theory on this is: while you're in the hospital giving birth, people ask you when you're having the next one.  Then you have the next one and again, people are asking you while you are in the hospital when you're having the next one.  Then you have three, and people say OMG three kids, you must be busy!    To each his own, some people want one others want 10 and others want none.      "do you think maybe moms of multiple children are a little jealous of the freedom that comes with being a mom to one?"  Absolutely not.  I would hope that if people have more than one child it was a conscious choice and was because they wanted more children.    Edit - Oh yeah, and have you ever seen the look on people's faces or heard the comments when you tell them you're not having ANY children??|`|yPNvecc7aa	I think you should just tell these people to mind their own business.  I also think you shouldn't dwell on it this much.|`|27f16a1a2275258802b78014bc189e59aa	people are shocked because they think you're SUPPOSED to have more than one child. i say more power to you, not overpopulating the earth. better to have one child you'll love and care for than like 14, you'll hardly pay enough attention to!|`|AA11537580	I am always asked that and I always say we can only afford one|`|XCrtAUTpaa	bc they think it is so hard to be an only child or something i suppose but id think it matters bc its ur choice not theirs|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Probably because some of us have great relationships with our siblings and when mom and dad are gone, all you have left is your sibling(s) in your immediate family.  I couldn't imagine life without my siblings and many children I knew growing up as an only child always wanted siblings.    However, I agree it is no one else's business what you do but I don't think they are trying to butt in, I think many people just think it's great for kids to have siblings.    I am having a second child because I think it's important for my son to have a sibling, I am doing it more for him than myself.  However you may not feel the same and you are entitled to your opinion, it's your life.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I was never lonely nor did I want a sibling. All I ever saw was siblings fighting and being mean. No thanks. So, my son will be an only child unless something very unexpected happens (you know what I mean) but I would not plan another baby. I think only children are more independent and introspective. Also more sensitive since they haven't spent their lives dealing with sibling rivalry.|`|faPKwClPaa	I know what you mean.  For reasons that are all our own, my husband and I will be stopping at one baby.  However, people just can't accept that.  They have no knowledge of our financial, mental, or marital situation, but they apparently feel it's within their right to tell us we're making a mistake.    Even funnier is when it comes from someone with a couple of kids, most of whom are complete screw-ups.  "You should have more than one!" says my husband's brother with three kids, one of whom is a knocked-up teenager, one who is going nowhere, and the other who, God help him, will escape unscathed.  Their marriage is a sham, and they've filed for bankruptcy at least once that I know of.    But, yeah, thank God they had more than one kid, huh?  That's CLEARLY been a smart move...|`|1WRB7RPNaa	i would just lie and say, oh one day, we dont know when yet, usually that makes them quit.
XD42367paa	I've always noticed that growth spurts seem to come in multiples of three. <br>  <br>  3 weeks, 6 weeks 9 weeks 12 weeks/3 months<br>  <br>  6 months, 9 months 12 months 15 months 18 months<br>  <br>  and then they sort of start to slow down a bit.|`|14JQ11AUaa	Yes, at 3 months they have a growth spurt and again at 6 months, 9 months.
prqrQcd1aa	Tell your mom it's time to get your brother some help before it is too late. He should not be allowed to do these things, and it sounds as if your mom has just given up on it. Tell her to tell his doctor what is going on, so he can be evaluated. At the same time your mom has to put her foot down and not allow him to step all over her. Yeah he may be big, but you know what, he is still a child and needs to act like one. He is manipulating your mother into submission because he knows that he can and it's not cool. Talk to your mom about this and how it makes you feel. Tell her she needs to get help for him before it is too late!|`|32747dcd374c857319720ae0aa088b0faa	This is the kind of thing she should have nipped in the bud long before it got to this point. It's not going to be easy now.    I would make him go to counseling and anger management, as well as set rules with specific punishments and then enforce them. If he refuses these things, his other option would be a delinquent petition to whatever court handles delinquent youths where you live. And yes, she can file such a thing without criminal activity being involved. Maybe your brother would like to go to a court-ordered boot camp to straighten out if he won't do it on his own.    It's natural for her to be sad to a certain extent, but she should really be MAD. She has to take control now before it's too late. She WILL regret it if she doesn't.|`|0hTvKlD5aa	Is your brother depressed? Some of the behavior you described sounds as if he could be manic depressive, or at least as if he has an anger problem. Maybe your mom should take him in for an evaluation.      Other then giving advice, there's nothing anyone can do, really. I hope things get better, but it also sounds like your brother is suffering here, too. Good luck~|`|XCrtAUTpaa	tell her to send him to boot camp or SERIOUSLY lay down the law no family should have to go through that bc if that continues there is a large chance that he will start abusing u and ur mom she needs to cut him off of everything(games going to friends etc) bust his *** and if he starts rampaging call the po po's (if  its really bad)or she needs to make him sit out on the porch no matter the weather and if he decides to leave then report a run away  he may act like that bc of the single parent thing and maybe he should try counseling or a sport|`|5sHcB4wuaa	so many kids are ungrateful, for all the things their mom does for them. I am 19 years old and im a guy i also have a sister only she is a year older, and i was reckless and disrespecting my mom at that age too, its hard to control yourself because testosterone is making you go nuts. But every time i went out of line my dad was there to put me back in my place, it was not until i was about 18 years old i started to realize that all the things my parents did for me it was all for my own good,  i think the society is the one to blame, i actually have a friend who is 19 years old he still lives with his mom and whenever he does something bad she slaps the **** out of him, that's what your mom should do, if he will retaliate send his *** to boot camp|`|CPZA5qrGaa	The boy needs therapy and some serious anger management classes.  Perhaps he'd rather live with his bio./father? Call him and have him help in the situation. His father might be out of the house,  but surely, he isn't out of your brat's life.|`|C5pVfdzwaa	That sounds exactly like me and my twin brother.  They're buttheads any way you try to explain them.    If he doesn't go to school, SHE can be arrested.  She might look into something to the effect of boot camp.  If he won't go to school and he won't listen to her, there's nothing she can do really other than get help from somewhere else.  Its not like she can lock him in a cage.  She doesn't sound like a bad mom, she just doesn't have the particular skill she needs to help him, but she does also have to protect you.    My brother broke my jaw, and I always regretted not calling the police.  If he beats up a woman, he needs to be in jail or somewhere away from you as a punishment.  He will get a nasty wake up call when he doesn't have the option of laying around and being a controlling jerk.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Honey, we can't help this situation.  Your mom is the only one who can.  She needs to set limits for your brother and enforce them.  If she has allowed him to act this way this long, it probably isn't going to stop anytime soon.  Sorry.      *what you CAN do though, is take notes. Remember when you have your own children what happens when children are allowed to be disrespectful and lazy.....change the pattern.|`|8bf22a7b300866a77ba08f820aaefdcaaa	You need to tell her that she needs to smash his gaming system right in front of his eyes.    That'll teach him.

HF97Rs9qaa	I got a manuel. I have not gotten to use it yet but I got it because I have heard a lot of women say that they prefer it to an electric Medela.    If you use it for pumping once or twice a day then I heard they are great. But if you need to do all day pumpings I would go with electric.    The great thing about anything manuel is that there is no batteries to refill, no worrying about something breaking and needing to replace it and it is easier to wash and keep clean!|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	We had one, but I got it thru a corporate lactation program, so got a great discount.  If you or the fathers company has a lactation program, you may be able to get it too.  Their HR dept would know.    But for $55 , if its used, just get new attachments.    Oh, and I was happy with it, although I cant say I have anything to compare it too.  But never had any problems.|`|kzyEuRroaa	I have both a manual one and an electric one that was given to me by a friend.  If you are only occasionally pumping, the manual pump will be totally sufficient.  It is only really neccessary to have an electric if you are having to pump all day, as the manual will take a little bit longer.  It's easier than my electric because I don't have to get it out, plug it in, set it all up and pump, I can just attach the storage bottle to the pump and go.|`|Def3uk2aaa	I was thinking of getting one too, for the same reasons.  I've heard nothing but great things about them (check out the reviews on the canadian toy's r us website).  I just noticed them in a flyer on sale at walmart (canadian) too!  I'm not due till beginning of march, but i'm going to get one anyway!
AJ10p6M0aa	IDK.  I think adoption is the greatest gift of love!  I love my step son as much as my daughters that I gave birth to.  The idea that adopted children are loved less than biological children underminds the entire concept of blended families.  Kudos to you for loving enough to grow your family in a less conventional manner!    Also, "real" gets on my nerves!  Being a biological parent doesn't make you a real parent!  Loving a child with all your heart and being able to do anything for them makes you a "real" parent!|`|7ouqu8f4aa	Honestly, their just judgmental jerks. I believe if you take a child into your own home with open arms and love them unconditionally as if they were your own blood, I think that is the most beautiful gift you could give to the child in need. I don't think anyone has any right to judge you for having such a big heart to do so.|`|Jjxg87YBaa	In my opinion I think adopting children is the nicest and kindest thing a person can do. I agree with you if you adopt a child you have the same love for them as if they were blood related. I think people don't understand is that they "made" such a wonderful beautiful child and have       unconditional love for that child because they created him/her. I think what you do is wonderful.|`|VELnLnIKaa	the everyday ignorance in this country is truly astounding congrats on all 3 of your lovely children|`|PlmT4lHXaa	Wow, people like that are idiots. Those ARE your own children, just because they didn't come from your sperm doesn't mean that you are not their father. Nurture (environment) is half of the development -with nature (genetics) being the other half- so the kind of father you are to them impacts them in a HUGE way... no matter what people try to argue, mannerisms and personality are not all innate, a lot come from the kind of household you are raised in.    Some people who are involved with the adoption process are against it because of all the corruption that can be involved. Some believe that adoptive parents are "baby stealers" who brainwash birth mothers into giving away their children... now, this may be true in some cases, but for the most part I think adoption is great thing, provided that the CHILD'S best interest is priority.    You sound like a great father who adopted for the right reasons. Some people just don't understand, and never will understand, and you have to just accept those people are ignorant and focus on being a loving dad.|`|sDHxandWaa	No idea....I think adoption is a great thing for people who can't have children for whatever reason.|`|H6RnpYtXaa	Maybe Bcz the child wouldnt know his real parents|`|b81H0vlYaa	I don't think they are against it, just that they don't understand it.  I want to adopt some children eventually, too.  I want older children who have less of a chance of getting adopted by someone else.  I think it takes a special sort of person to take in a child and love it as their own.  That is why they don't understand, because they wouldn't do it themselves.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	no idea. adoption is great for people who don't have kids and kids who don't have parents to take care of them. Real parents are the people who love and care for the child.
GFzDwIk6aa	You're children's names are very nice. I especially like Lily Claire and Isla.  All the names you like for girls are also lovely. My favourite out of those is Madelyn Grace, and if you spelled it Madeline, it would have an L and and I in it.  Jake Aidan and Jesse Luke are quite cute, but I prefer Jesse Aidan.  Not too fond of Liam.  Isabella is nice, but youre right abnout it being similar to Isla.    Consider:  Amberly Sophia  Camilla Marcheline  Cora Isabella  Alessia Claire  Matilda Rose    Milo Avery  Matthew Aiden  Salen [SAY-luhn] Issac  Camden Zachary  Jackson Nathaniel  Talan Broden|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Of the girl names you have listed, I like Madelyn grace the best.  Of the boy names you have listed, I like Jake Aidan or Liam (but, not Felix)  How about Liam Jacob?  As far as another girls name goes, I like the name Talia that you have as a middle along w/Addison which I don't like.  How about Talia Meagan?  Good Luck!|`|LMFOUJZhaa	I luv Addison and Liam  Your kids names are very cute also  I agree with you that Isobella is to close to Isla|`|2h913O0Saa	Why do your kids have double barrelled names?    Madelyn Grace = Madelyn  Marcia Addison = Marcia  Saffron Amelia = Saffron or Amelia  Addison Talia = Talia    Boys:   Jake Aidan = Jake or Aidan  Reuben Jacob = Reuben? HAHAHAHA!  Jesse Luke = Okay.  Liam Felix = Liam, Felix is a cat name/|`|aYlxodqIaa	For a boy, I like Liam Felix. But for a girl, I'd like to go for Lilith Imogen. Just a personal opinion.|`|zbjaBgyEaa	I really like the names you've chosen - especially Lily Claire, which I think is super gorgeous.  They're all pretty classic and pretty uncommon names.  I really like that, don't get me wrong.  But several choices you have for girls are quite popular (Madelyn and Addison).  So the names just seem a little out of place.  I don't much care for Saffron - it's a little hippy, a little strange.  Marcia's nice but it's sort of dated.    What about using Amelia (which you have as a middle name)?    Other names with "L"s and "I"s.  Elaina, Sylvia, Natalie/Natalie, Alice, Camilla, Julia/Juliet/Julianna, Willow     I love Liam Felix for a boy.  It's both a favourite name of mine, and it still fits with the other' kids names.  I think it's a stellar choice.    I agree with you on Isobella.  Too close to Isla.|`|DvDjij1jaa	My Opinion I don't like the names you suggested for girls names i would suggest.  girls.  1.Kayla  2 Mikayla  3. Abby  4 . arron  boys .  1.dylan  2.thomas  3.Camryn|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Liam Felix|`|JcVHhFZbaa	For a girl i would consider Madelyn Grace becuase thats just adorable and for a boy i would consider Reuben Jacob because that really fits and thats cute too. um... my aunt has five kids and they are hard to work with so my best of luck to you.|`|nOzQUsToaa	Lily Claire 9  April Vivienne 12 =) it's gorgeous   Tobias Maximus 8  Isla Sienna 10    Liam is very cute and goes well with the other names. Oliver would also be nice.  How about Jocelyn, Violet, Willow, Madeleine, Coralie, Noelie, Hazel, Olive, Clover, Melody or Nell for a girl?
F47MyGDSaa	I have three siblings (one older sister, 21, me 18, one younger sister, 16, and one younger brother, 13, almost 14). But when we were younger, my 21 year old sister and I would always go at it. But as we got older it got better, but my older sister (the one who's 21, her name is alicia, and the 16 year old is courtney) they purposely try to hurt each other's feelings. <br>  <br>  Alicia is so good at getting courtney to feel bad about herself. And I think about twice alicia has lied to my parents about something courtney has done, which wasn't true. One was when Courtney got her license, they have a rule where you can't have friends in the car for 6 months, and Alicia told my parents that she saw courtney driving with her friends, and they all stopped at a restraunt, and it turns out courtney didn't even have the car that day, but Alicia wanted to get her in trouble.<br>  <br>  But yeah, overall, sometimes siblings can be a big pain in the rump!|`|08Ksc5Oiaa	Quite.  *drinks tea*
osXURDjraa	It  might be that he is having night terrors can last up until 5 years of age and can go away/appear before then but basically a child screams or cries really loudly in their sleep self consciously and not realising they're doing it then often forgets their scary dream also. However maybe you should check that he is not getting hungry or uncomfortable in his sleep. Or maybe he is just sad :(|`|UghJ0XROaa	Probably just an unpleasant dream|`|AA10330995	He is in a deep sleep. Just REM cycle. Babies need this deep sleep. Nothing to worry about.|`|6U4sl15uaa	That was when my baby started crying in her sleep too but she never woke from it. It was very mild I couldn't help but make a joke out of it and say she must be dreaming about some one taking her bottle or toys away from her. but any way if she ever cried for more than a min or two then I would check on her I didn't want her thinking I was gone and she was alone or her learning that every time she cries she is going to get attention|`|DZeswuTwaa	Call your pediatrician.|`|N3jwE76maa	He's most likely having a bad dream.

I would suggest that you speak to your HV or Midwife because changing milks can lead to tummy problems and your baby is more than likely just going through the many growth spurts that she will encounter during the first few months x|`|2s5WSVbPaa	It depends on your reason for wanting to change, could you be more specific, is she sick alot etc.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	My HV recommended waiting til at least six weeks old, as SMA White is harder to digest.  Although I think on the tin it says suitable from birth.  I waited til 10 weeks old when the SMA Gold just wasn't satisfying him anymore.  Before this, I upped his milk to 7oz every three hours.|`|qjDxKXENaa	why do you want to change? you dont need to change unless she is a hungry baby... My little girl is nearly 6 months and still on sma gold.|`|xL16bC3waa	Your baby is never too young to change formula. If the baby is having issues with the milk you need to let your pediatrician know. This could be a sign of a milk allergy or maybe the baby is having digestive issues. There are so many forms of formula on the market, only you and your doctor can help determine which one is right for you and your baby. I went through about 5 different formulas in 6 mos with my daughter,she had severe milk allergy and had to have some special hospital medical formula, but she had a severe case.
WrUTuQdlaa	Smart kid! Feed him beans and cheese for a complete protein. Or eggs.|`|3KyVMVncaa	Oh boy, I know what you are going through! My 17 month old hates meat too. As long as you are giving him other sources of protein he should be fine. Google sources of protein and you will get a big list of good foods. Eggs are a great source! Hard boiled are my daughters favorite.  My daughter started eating chicken again but only if I give her some honey to dip it in. Hot dogs are also usually a kid friendly choice, give him some ketchup to dip and he will probably eat it. Just make sure you cut it up in small pieces for him so he doesn't choke. Kids love to dip things.|`|vue9NOhYaa	It's fine.  Toddlers often go through spells where they don't want to eat a particular food.  Just keep offering a variety of foods, and he'll eat enough to stay healthy.  He really doesn't need a huge amount of protein.  If he's drinking milk, that covers most of his protein needs.|`|r52rfBkeaa	My 15 month old is the same way.  He's just never been a big meat eater and I think it has to do with the texture (maybe still too tough for him to chew).  He eats eggs, peanut butter, beans... lots of other sources of protein.      Also, we went to Wendy's the other day and he SCARFED 4 chicken nuggets.  I know that fast food isn't ideal for kids, but I was so proud that he ate meat!|`|whk10FeYaa	he's a vegetarian, why is that so wrong?|`|r5R2nstRaa	check with your baby doctor just in case, but im sure its just a phase. substitution is great what you are doing since you cant get your son to eat meat. it will work out fine as long as you continue to do that. i would start looking up vegetation books to get a good look on the foods you can use so you're not giving the same thing all the time. good luck!|`|zLKsBm1Uaa	A long time ago my parents had the same problem.  My milk was even cut off at school--the doctor told my parents to give me nothing but meat to eat. Then when I was hungry enough I would eat. Two days later they gave me vegetables and my milk at school.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Are you giving meat you prepare, or comercially prepared meat?    Will he take eggs, dairy, or lentils/beans?    Are you still breastfeeding?|`|dsxDysQZaa	my oldest is now ten but when she was a baby till about 2 years ago, she was a vegan. she is healthy and now finally she will eat all but fried chicken. i am sure he will be fine. give him nuts, peanut butter, soy, things like that and talk to his doctor. see what other foods contain protein for him.|`|XqIqz52Paa	he is a vegatarian.
44OH7Si6aa	Sometimes women don't dilate at all until they are in labor. I didn't dilate at all before labor with my second child. I had my daughter at 38 weeks, dilated to 3 cm after 6 hours of labor. Stayed at 3 cm for another 7 hours. They came into the room saying we needed to have a c-section decided to check me one last time, in the span of about 20 mins I had gone from 3cm to the full 10 and was able to deliver naturally  Semen is supposed to contain a fatty acid that helps soften and dilate the cervix so you could always try having lots of sex and see if that helps for your next appointment.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	we not even checked b4 we 40+wks so wouldnt know   baby wont come early baby will come when he/she ready   you will drive ur self mad trying|`|MtC3CWZraa	If this is your first, you'll probably efface (i.e. your cervix will start thinning) before you dialate.    I'm nearly 38 weeks and have been dilated at one for two weeks, but my cervix has been getting progressively softer and thinner though.|`|NLxcfGplaa	I was not even dialated at 40 weeks with all 3 of my kids.  Had to be induced all 3.  But don't worry just let it happen don't be upset.|`|XjHXgGU2aa	dilation doesn't tell you anything. There are women who're dilated 2-3 cm and they sit on it for 3-4 weeks, even go over their due dates sometimes. Then there are other women who can have their water break and have the baby that same day with no prior dialtion of the cervix. I'm 39 weeks today and not dilated what so over. I do hope that I'm not overdue but it can happen overnight or anytime in the next few days. You're only 37 weeks so don't worry about it too much - babies only come when they're supposed to and are fully ready. I wish you best of luck!!|`|qmmu6hv5aa	i'm going to my 37 week check up today and i'm really praying i'm dilated, i went last week and wasn't but i was fully thinned, i'm the same as you i have the feeling he's going to come late and that thought makes me sooo anxious|`|IkuZj0Lbaa	I started to dilate right after my 37 weeks started..about halfway through it. I was at 1 and then six days later went to two...I'm still at two. I have 8 days left and am ready for him to come. :)
Mj1qhzcIaa	I have given up charting for now...but when I did chart I would just barely wake up using an alarm clock and pop the digi thermometer  in my mouth and wait till it beeps and then go back to sleep. If its a BBT it does store your last data so ths way I could enter it much later.   This method was pretty good and worked well to give a more consistent chart. Atleast 3 hrs of sleep is enough and although it does vary a bit if you went to bed late, had a more stressful day, etc the ovulation rise is mch sharper and these factors do not mess with the pattern at all. So 'same time' is pretty much the mantra! Good luck!!|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	As long as you take your Temperature first thing when you awake it should be effective in your charting.|`|0BC2WTyoaa	I charted for several months and at first I was using the temps when I had the most amount of sleep.  I wake up at odd times through out the night ( new puppy)... when I was doing this my charts were erratic.  Overall they ended up making sense but were messy looking.  The month before I got pregnant I started taking my temp at the same time every day.  If it was a weekend I would still set the alarm and then just go back to sleep after taking my temps.  This really helped my chart make sense and the temps to be consistent.    EDIT also if I woke up before the alram I would resist the urge to take my temp until the time I was supposed to and this worked better for me.|`|HCmAoNjzaa	Thanks for asking this question! I have often wondered the same thing because on the weekends I stay up much later and sleep much later! I actually quit charting because of this! I can't wait to see what answers you get!|`|RE6GBw0Baa	hun iv been trying to chart this past week and its ended up being a non starter lol.     im trying this month with opks.    i can never wake up at the best of times and slept through my alarm over the weekend.    hun i wish i could help ya but im stuck 2 lol xxxxx
e7bc222fa0b57adc181abe207a015454aa	I think you should follow your heart.  Who cares how big your house is?  As long as it is big enough to hold all the love you can give out, what else matters?  Things always have a way of working out, this will, too.  So if you are ready for another baby and the feeling keeps nagging you, then have another one!  You are responsible, you can pay your bills and your children are everything to you, so go for it!  Good luck!|`|fZfVM1unaa	You facilitate a polysyllabic vocabulary while articulating thoughts in complete sentences.  We need more of you.  The criminal degenerate miscreants in this country are reproducing without thought or care and if people like you don't do something about it decent people like us are going to be F*CKED out of existence.|`|2eU0b396aa	you might want a bigger house (imagine when the kids are older, can you picture a bunch of noisy boys running wild??). But follow your heart. :)|`|bfmHsu36aa	I know this is a short answer, but it's not the size or your house or where you live it is the memories you make there. If everyone is ok and happy, then why not :)|`|DBpte2RDaa	I am probably going to say some of the same things the others have already said.  You and your husband should do what you feel is right.  It is none of anyone else's business.  In the future, I would suggest that you not discuss having children with anyone other then your husband.  This is a big decision, and some things should remain private.  Other people will always have an opinion.  Again, this is a decision between you and your husband, and nobody else!  No one else can tell you what is right for you and your husband.  No one else can know what is happening inside your home.  These people don't walk in your shoes.  They don't live in your shoes.  As my mother would say, "Some things are better left unsaid."  Do what is best for you, your husband, and family.  Best of luck to you all!|`|EtCRnDJMaa	First of all you should not listen to what people tell you!!!  If I did, I wouldn't have my youngest (3rd) daughter.  My mom says, you don't need anymore.  I wonder what she'll say with baby  4 if  I get pregnant again?  Ha ha!  My girls all share a room too, because I am staying in my dad's house while my husband is overseas.  This wont be forever, but I can't put off having any more babies either like you can put off on the house.  Sure things are tight, but the kids don't mind at all.    If you want another baby then have one.  You don't need to explain yourself to anyone.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	If you can adequately feed, clothe and love your children, why not? You don't need a big house to be happy.     I live in a housing situation (provided by my husband's employer) where I cannot choose where I live, so we take what we are given. We just moved to a nice two story, olddddd house that is small but cozy, last summer. About three weeks after we moved in I found out I was pregnant - total shocker. Three bedrooms, one bathroom - so it can be kind of cramped. But someone will have to share a room. That's the breaks!     I wouldn't worry too much about what other people say - if you're comfortable, then that's all that matters. After all, it's YOU raising those children, not THEM.|`|yB8djbeNaa	i would wait a bit get a new bigger house and then have another baby|`|QrSFskUpaa	You guys really want a baby but you said that you don't have a big house and alot of money. I think you need to consider these 2 things. I think you should wait...2 isn't enough for you guys? why don't you guys focus on the 2 little ones that you have for now and decide later if your situation got better to have another one.|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	Well depending on what the baby is you can always double up 3 kids to a room and not have to add on. I really think you should do what you feel is right for your family. Just dont tell others around you until you are pregnant so you dont have to hear their junk
rhPCJfeuaa	Yes it does.  I understand that accidents happen, but at what point does one learn from their mistakes???  At what point do they own up to it and work their asses off trying to make things as right as possible.  You tried to help her, others have tried to help her.  You just can't help someone who doesn't want to help herself.  Who refuses to put her children's needs above her own most basic desires.  And as far as you calling her your friend, she wouldn't know what a friend was if she fell over one.  She just uses her friends and everyone else in her life.  You didn't name her or give out her address.  You vented a bit in your question, because you're frustrated and disappointed that she refuses to get herself together.  If taking her in with her child and never charging her anything for a year isn't being a friend, I don't want to hear what people think a friend should be willing to do. There's a difference between being a friend and continuing to be someones sucker.|`|AA11315360	I dont think you are a good friend to speak to negative about her. You should stop being her "friend" because you clearly dont think anything positive about her.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Well, there are no rules about who can an cant have kids.  To each their own.  On the other hand it does disgust me to see and hear people talk crap about their so called friends, and to see how cold hearted and down right mean people can be.   If you have two sets of parents, one with money but not alot of compassion, rude and nasty.. and another with a big heart and not alot of money.. i guarantee the person with less money will have healthier happier kids.   It is much more discusting to see someone talk so poorly about a friend.|`|UMRdHuuVaa	So dont call yourself her friend.<br>  <br>  Its a bit slack of you to call yourself her friend and come on here and bag her out, either you are or aren't her friend.<br>  If you want to do something, help the kids - she is a big girl and can obviously fend for herself in some way or another.<br>  Lets just hope the poor baby gets taken off her and is looked after.|`|AzP7uoIraa	I have to say thats the kind of thing that got our country where were at. People having kids and not being able to educate them or give them proper attention, i would tell her that it goes against you moral and ethic principles ...........or iff your feeling generous, make a huge impact on her kids lives, if you care enough help raise them its not their fault!|`|IoQF4g1Gaa	I have to agree... That's just sad! <br>  <br>  You should tell your friend gently & honestly how you feel. Honesty is always the best policy! Explain to her what situation she's putting herself and her children in, and maybe help her look for a new job to support her family?<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|rqJSk1omaa	Sounds like this woman need to be sterilized. Maybe you could talk to her about seriously considering ending her reproductive abilities.|`|48zcmDYlaa	I agree, All they do is abuse the welfare system and get every check known to man and several known to apes.|`|rTaaIXSuaa	You are considering her your friend yet you are on here bashing her? What does that say about you?<br>  Judge not lest you be judged.|`|92529423230d8afd2de97a390c4c8c8faa	You are not her friend. Instead of coming on here and bashing her you could offer to help her with the kids.|`|hZf8aJkYaa	yes|`|rBq189W1aa	Yes, it does.<br>  <br>  The couple down the street from us have apparently just popped another one out. I don't think either of them have ever worked a day in their lives.<br>  <br>  Not only are they unable to support their kids without government assistance, I strongly doubt they're any kind of decent parents; she looks like she's constantly under heavy sedation, and I've often seen them walking down the street with him screaming abuse in her ear.<br>  <br>  "i can't stand my friend i think she's filthy and disgusting for doing this to her kids and i cannot stand any woman who pops out kids that they cant care for."<br>  <br>  Yet you keep calling her your 'friend'. I do not think that word means what you think it means.|`|iwB3jbfiaa	Yes! ! I am 16 years old, and my mother is the same way. I do not live with her, i live with my dad's parents, she gave birth about a week ago, and she lives with her mother who is the only one who works in the house. My mother and her sister do not work at all, my grandmother cleans houses to make ends meet even though she has hepatitis B from a pre-'80s blood transfusion. My aunt who also lives there has two children and she takes care of them, Even with as much hard work as my grandmother puts in, she is on government support and gets $400 in food stamps a month because she is the only one that works and has to care for two lazy grown women and three children. I know he is my brother (well half-brother, the father is in jail for drug trafficking) but i wanted her to get an abortion. I have good reasons for this,my mother was (and maybe still is) a drug addict that is in no condition to take care of children, her body is in terrible condition for housing a fetus, he's a week old now, was born 4.5 lbs. and has to have open heart surgery.At the very least, i think she should give him up for adoption to a family that can take very good care of him. Also, she is still married to my father even though they have not been together in 16 years. She hasn't worked in about three years, she is a high-school dropout, and depends on her mother to take care of her.  And she claims to love him. In my personal opinion, if she loved him, she would give him up for adoption so that he can have a better life than she could provide for him. Sorry if my answer makes no sense! But honestly, my family makes no sense!!|`|G9ywiLqvaa	yeah, i hate people who can't afford to have kids have kids.<br>  <br>  but i hate to have you as a friend even more.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	What I am suprised at is people who make their kids suffer with them rather than getting a abortion or giving the kid up for adoption.<br>  <br>  They are selfish.
SEzIkGNiaa	I think its very important to eat as a family.  In my family, we do eat together at dinner times.  Its a great time to talk, and discuss what we did that day.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	we eat as a family the vast majority of the time, and the rest of the time (as when someone is traveling for work or working late or one child has a commitment elsewhere) we'll eat as a family minus whichever person had to be somewhere else (which still leaves plenty of us).    i think being together as a family and having dedicated time to focus on one another is important.  i think mealtime is an easy time, but not the only possible time, to do that.  we have dedicated reading time together at the end of the day which we also use for some conversation.|`|AA10811784	I come from a family that always ate together at dinner time. I think it's a great way to talk about everyone's day. In our house, there didn't seem to be any other time of day where we could do that.     My husband on the other hand, came from a family who ate whenever they were hungry. They rarely even sat at the table, let alone together.     At our house now, I try my best to have us all eat at the same time. My husband still has a hard time with that because of the way he grew up. He is getting better at it though.|`|KHZLPldraa	I grew up in a home that at 6:30pm your butt better be at the kitchen table, so my children are learning the same thing.  I think for us (I work outside the home all day) it is a chance for catch up on everyones day, we discuss what we are wanting to do on the weekend, etc.  No tv during dinenr either.  The time line is flexible as I am not always home at 630, but when dinner is done we are all at the table together, and it is instilling in the 17 month old how families interact.  My almost 13 year old if daddy is out past dinner time wants us to wait until dad gets home to sit down to eat, so I must be doing something right!  :)|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	It's of PRIME importance! We do, every day as a family, no matter what. Usually lunch and dinner on the weekend, too.  We also make time in the evening just to talk and catch up, even if it's a half hour, but we are all together. Usually, for us, it's more though...|`|AA10494763	I have mixed feelings about this.  As a kid we did not have dinner as a family.  Mom said dinner was done you ate when you wanted.  I liked to finish my homework before eating  so then i could lay back and relax the rest of the night .  We had the occasional Sunday dinner and of-course big holidays.   I think my brother and I are well adjusted and we do fine.   Our parents talked to us all the time about our days and school. Nothing set in stone and they never talked about their days to us and i never cared about it to ask.   I am a parent now and we do have dinner together but that is mainly my wife's doing.  I really still don't see the point. I much rather take my diner in my room and realx after a long day. My daughter will join me when she finshes and we hang out.  My wife insist we eat together and talk or even look at a TV show together|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Maybe not every single day but I'd say like....4 times a week its really important.  It gives them memories later on of that and teaches them to treasure family.  Plus you hear about eachothers days and know whats going on in eachothers lives i think its great.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	unfortunately most days we dont..   My mother works  7am-3pm(one week a month) and 3pm-11pm (the rest of the month)  So we rarely eat diner with our mom...  My sister eats diner with me..but my brother doesn't..he is autistic and hates eating at the table for some reason...and he never eats what we do anyways..    Honestly we dont do much as a family anymore...sad to say ... :(|`|3d1XRIzkaa	I think it is very important for a family to eat dinner together, at least as much as possible. That way they can discuss what went on that day. Also, talk about family matters.|`|s1zitZMOaa	I think it's very important. I was raised in a family where we always sat down and had dinner together - it was the one time of day when we were all in the same room and could talk about our day and stuff. So now my family is the same. We set the table, sit down and eat. We all talk and it's nice. The only time we don't eat together is when my husband is out of town. Sometimes I do feed my daughter whatever she wants and then put her to bed. Then I eat whatever I want in front of the tv - it's my consolation for not having him around to help with bath and bedtime :)|`|r52rfBkeaa	I think it's extremely important for all of the reason mentioned already, but I've also heard that family dinner helps prevent obesity, promotes positive self-esteem in girls and so many other things... I saw it on a commercial for Swanson (don't laugh), so maybe checking out their website can shed some light for more reasons why we should eat as a family!!|`|XgejRqWsaa	unimportant, there's loads of other things a family can do together. we never ate dinner at the table. i dont think we even had a table...|`|505c28ffab4b949ab353bc9f3870e311aa	I think that it is very very important.  It teaches your children to communicate as a family, it expands there vocabulary, & your time together as a family is priceless.  It really means alot!!|`|wipJ9OE7aa	I think that it's very important to eat dinner as a family. Given that families spend so much time apart with parents being a work and kids being at school all day. It would be the one time where everyone can come together and spend time with each other, talk about the day, and what went on.|`|yB8djbeNaa	I think eating as a family is very important|`|WirFwirLaa	Nope, my husband attends college 2 hours away and only makes it home 1 weekend a month. So usually my little boy & I eat with my parents.|`|RVCeDnsvaa	me and my bf are expecting, and I already think it is very important to have a least a few dinners as a family a week. this ensures time to catch up on what is going on in everyone's lives and teach the child the importance of family bonding.   I think that if my family would have taken the time to eat dinner together more often that our family would be much closer.|`|Ar6wD9Oeaa	on a scale of  1 -10 ... i'm gonna rank it a 15.    and both my kids are 1.5 and 3. I think its just important to establish a routine. We eat dinner, clean up do bath time and get in bed.    And its very important to me to eat at the table. i grew up eatin dinner in front of the tv and i hated it.|`|p07RwZK2aa	I think it's really important.   However I have four kids under the age of 6, so they eat at about 5pm and my husband doesn't get home until about 7pm.     But we all eat together on weekends|`|OxFV92hJaa	With my husbands schedule, it works out to where he is home all but 2 days a week for dinner. It's highly important to us, and we do virtually everything as a family. Occasionally one of us will make a quick run to the store by ourself or with just one of the kids, other than that they are always with us.     Most evenings we have dinner, clean up and simply relax. Kids go down for the night at 8pm, and that leaves a few hours for him and I to cuddle up and watch a movie, or talk, or whatever we want.     With our parents it was always a free for all, grab what you want and eat wherever whenever...that sucks. So we enjoy doing it as a family now that we have one lol.|`|5fMAvu5naa	Giving away my age but when I was growing up everyone sat around the table and ate very meal.We talked about anything that happened and school.Now days with our schedules, it isn't happening.We work different shifts but we work.Usually we do on our days off do eat together and talk about the events in our lives.It isn't "Leave It To Beaver," or "The Donna Reed Show", but it works at least in this day and age.One important thing the television was not allowed on during meals.Plus we all helped with the dishes which was another time to talk.|`|N8rOFOuDaa	I think it's important, but my family never does it. My parents are divorced, and I live with just my mom and three younger siblings. So most of the time, my mom doesn't even make dinner.  I think it's plenty important though. I wish my family would do some things as a family like that, but the kids never listen to anyone. So that could never happen. =|
prqrQcd1aa	First no, i don't think that your son's friend is a little person. It is common for kids to be that far apart in height at that age.. trust me i know when i was in 6th grade i was 5ft 3in. There were many kids that were a foot or more shorter than me. I started having growth spurts at a very young age, and also hit puberty early. I stopped growing by 8th grade.     How is dwarfism caused.. there are several causes, i will send you a link!   http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/symptoms/d...|`|2eU0b396aa	no. dont freak out. when I was in.. 6th grade i think, I 4"9. someone in my class was 4"3, but he got a grotth spurt and he;s fine|`|aOCfLAJJaa	No, dwarfism is ABNORMALLY short, not 4'-6' out of the average.     UNLESS he has bone or hormonal problems, like his parents are both 6'8".     Just like gigantism doesn't mean a few inches taller (I'm 5'11", half a foot taller than the average)    Edit: IF you are THAT concerned, there are supplements that can help.  L-Dopa, GABA, Melatonin, 5-HTP and Galantamine can help hGH secreation (which increase IGF-1 levels too) and induce sleep.   Add things to his diet like "100% grape juice" and you can prolong his growth period (grape juice deals with blood estrgoen levels, letting him grow longer).|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	You would know by now if they did because of other shortened body features, not just being short. They are usually very distinct features that you can't miss - have you seen the show "Little People, Big World" on TLC? They have various forms of Dwarfism (the mom and dad, and one child) and it's very obvious. I think in your son's case, you would have definitely noticed it by now.     http://www.orato.com/files/imagecache/st...    ETA: And BTW, the boy in the blue shirt and the tall boy with curly hair are twins. :)|`|aCUHzMrmaa	You sound insane...the shoes look fine lol i think you'd KNOW if your kid was a midget.  If your that concerned take him to a doctor although i'm pretty sure they might think your insane as well.|`|zwsdYR3Vaa	No. They're both fine. Don't freak out. You do have a thing called Paranoia!|`|nfzQkvqraa	You have a thing for the picture of those shoes huh?  This is the second question I've answered recently regarding those shoes.  I'm sure your son is fine.
6Knhikr1aa	I had a shower with the first two. Not with the third. I felt I couldn't possibly use any more stuff!<br>  I had all boys and yes, the way they grow I STILL have plenty of clothing that's only been worn once or twice! I reused toys of course. Nothing really I coudn't reuse...<br>  Yes, the older two boys share a room. They choose to.<br>  the first 2 were 3yrs1mo, the 2nd and 3rd were 2yrs7mo. I don't ovulate until they completely wean, so nature planned them for me ;-)<br>  They were very excited, after the honeymoon period wore off, it took a little more adjusting. But they all love each other a lot! I think the fact that I homebirth helped a lot. They were part of the process and got to be there for the birth rather than me just bringing some strange baby home. I recommend letting them be as involved as possible and being around the baby as soon as you can.<br>  Something else I found helpful was telling the older child it was their job to show the baby where the "nuh nuh's" ( nursing) were. That way they could sort of pass it on to them. This meant a lot to them and they really felt like they had done something important.|`|EMKuBql8aa	1. My wife had a baby shower for the youngest but not the oldest because we lived where noone knew us (I was in the military)<br>  2. I have a boy and a girl but we can still let them share a lot of things, like white onsies, socks, toys and so much more.<br>  3. My kids share a room now (boy and a girl)<br>  4. They are a little less then 16 months apart (15 months and 3 weeks to be exact)<br>  5. My daughter was so young when my son was born that I think she thought of him as a toy and by the time he was old enough for her to realize, she was so used to him that it didn't really matter.<br>  <br>  Prepare for little to no sleep for the first 6 months if they are close in age like mine. Bathe them together, it's easier (when the baby is old enough obviously), Involve the oldest as much as possible. <br>  <br>  Good Luck and congrats!!|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	1. Yes, but for number one I registered, had 2 showers, one at work, one with family and friends, and they were big, whereas with my second child it was a small luncheon of 8 close friends<br>  <br>  2. Girl & Boy....but still reused car seat, swing, bouncer, pack-n-play, bath tub etc. I had gotten unisex from the get go<br>  <br>  3. No, no need<br>  <br>  4. 23 months<br>  <br>  5. sometimes very interested, other times could have cared less about baby brother :) Overall it is going well.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i will have ashower  for both I am 27 weeks along <br>  girl thatis 20 month boy coming<br>  they share a room for a  bit <br>  2 yrs almost to the day  not sure yet how shell react|`|2SKd9996aa	I have 7 children but never had a baby shower, however, I do not think there is anything wrong with having a shower for each pregnancy. Every new life deserves to be celebrated and honored.<br>  <br>  I have reused clothing for same sex children but baby gear such as car seats, baby bath tubs, bouncer seats, etc. have always been bought again (I buy 2nd hand usually) because they take up so much room. I did go out and buy the Soothing Center swing for my new baby which was about $200. None of my opposite sex children have ever shared a room. My kids' ages are :14, 12, 10, 7, 4, 13 months and 5 weeks.<br>  <br>  All of my children have been wonderful with each new addition (Yes, I have been lucky:-)|`|4iXL4C6paa	I have four children, they are 6,3,2, and 5 months.  I have had 2 baby showers when I was pregnant with my first child and my third.  I have reused so much stuff lol, my daughter are 3, and 2 so I reused clothes, walkers, jumpers, seriously everything lol, my children have always reacted real good to the new baby, they try to help out and I have never had any problems of jealousy or any of that.|`|dPULl5hjaa	1.  No baby shower for either child.<br>  2.  not applicable<br>  3.  Yes, shared a room - one in crib & one on toddler bed<br>  4.  3 1/2 years<br>  5.  Our daughter was happy to help with our son|`|01Mu3wUeaa	1: Yes, I am going to have a second baby showe since i'm having a girl this time.<br>  2: Yes, basic stuff like crib, bouncer and some unisex clothes.<br>  3:They will each have their own room.<br>  4:My son is turning 2 in Oct. and my little girl is due in four months.<br>  5: Not there yet lol.
mc6YtaRbaa	They will use a trans vaginal ultra sound to determine how far along you are. This early they are very accurate so it won't be a problem.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	When you have your first ultrasound your doctor will be able to tell you how far along you are.|`|AXwLhT5Uaa	Your miscarriage would be like having your period, when they calculate approximate due dates they ask you for your first day of your period and then add 14-15 days, so this would make you about a month pregnant. Looking at the pregnancy calculator from school if today (Feb.3rd) you are pregnant 4 weeks you are due around Oct. 14th. Or another way is to take the first day of your period subtract 3 months then add 7 days & one year. Remember to take your folic acid to avoid neurotube defects (like spina bifida), your baby is developing it's nervous system right now, a very sensitive time & make sure you eat well to ensure a health baby.
wGrRvFePaa	If you've had TWO periods, on top of FIVE negative tests, you ARE NOT pregnant. Ever notice how people say they are "late" then get worried if they are pregnant? Well, you've had two periods. You aren't pregnant.|`|2oD2AtiWaa	I am in the same freak out situation as you, so I understand the paranoia. If it helps, seriously, just go to the doctor and get it checked. It'll set you at ease. The Internet has a ton of stories--3 months pregnant and still getting periods! No symptoms! False negatives!--which will send anyone into a major stress fest. But, these situations are rare, and if you took proper precaution, the laws of probability are on your side that you are not pregnant. <br>  Best of luck!|`|kjgonYlgaa	Test are very accurate.  Showing more false positives than negatives.  If you took 5 that were neg.  don't worry !  but I would stop having unprotected sex so you don't keep worrying about these things in the Future|`|7jEY7Z2waa	hahaha you worry way to much.. You need to calm down and forget it.|`|edHTskosaa	My aunt had her period for the first 5 months of her pregnancy so she didn't even know she was pregnant for the first few months because she was getting her period...she just thought she was gaining weight. But she suffered from fybroids tumors.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to go see a doctor and get a blood test which is the most accurate test. Don't stress though. You probably have stomach pains from being nervous. I hope everything works out for you.|`|tRrzHOCRaa	hi  in answer to your question if you dont have other symptoms you are just worried for nothing probably....but opposed to the other answer you got yes some women still have a period or two..which i know from experience..it is due to some woman still ovulate ( ever hear of fraternal twins!!) but it is very rare...so unless you have a few symptoms dont worry!! and if this doesnt make you feel better get a doctor to examine you|`|kWAm7syDaa	<a href="http://getinall.palacebet.com" rel="nofollow">http://getinall.palacebet.com</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check|`|FwQ8Y8kGaa	It wasn't funny the first time.....|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If you've had periods YOU ARE NOT PREGNANT! Pregnant women do not get periods. In very very very rare cases women bleed a little in pregnancy but it's never like a period meaning the bleeding is very light or just spotting.<br>  <br>  You are not pregnant.|`|AA10358331	If the test has come out negative 5 times then I'm sure that you aren't pregnant. Plus you've had your period twice. Stop worrying, your not pregnant.
kaqPSgTVaa	If he only came NEAR her vagina and none got in then she is fine. If this happened within the last 72 hours she can get someone 18 years old to go and get the Morning After Pill or Plan B from the pharmacy. If it happened more than 72 hours ago there isn't anything she can do but wait.<br>  <br>  It's unlikely she got pregnant though.|`|1f752716589c1a69f4c3bcbb582d7a9caa	omg <br>  i think as long as it didnt touch ur private area den she is good but just in case she should take da pregancy test <br>  tell  her  i said gudd luck|`|I1ru7yrKaa	well there is a little chance but nothing big. Tell her to take a test & next  time Practice safe sex it don't matter what kind<br>  <br>  qud luck<br>  -Nellz.
SJx9IWWtaa	I don't think they should be fine with it!  Kids have feelings too!<br>  <br>  But I do expect them to deal with it.  That sounds harsh, but I'm the parent and I make the rules.  Tough luck.  Just because someone else is coming into the family doesn't mean I would love my kids any less.  They don't have to support me with flying colors, but they do need to respect my future spouse and me!   <br>  <br>  If I said that I would NEVER remarry, then I'd just have to apologize and stick my foot in my mouth.  <br>  <br>  Parents have feelings too.  Maybe he said he would never remarry because at the time he thought he never would.  Maybe he down right didn't want to remarry.  Then he moved on and found someone worth getting married to again.  If you don't want him to get married again, tell him that.  But don't expect him to call off the wedding because of it.   Why not try being a better person, a accepting that he is getting remarried.  You don't have to like it, but you can be there for him.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	1: I understand how you feel.I don't think he can expect you to be happy about since.<br>  <br>  2: He needs to be happy too! He ISN'T replacing your mom by marrying someone else...nobody can replace your mom.But he also cannot go on through life without a mate if he doesn't seem that fit.<br>  <br>  You don't have to support him but you also cannot be rude about it to him or her because it is not your decision.Don't be so hard on him.He is engaged because he found someone he loves and he wants to spend the rest of his life with her.What is so wrong about that? <br>  <br>  Give him a break.I am sure your mom would want him to be happy.Still, not saying you have to be the jolly little girl that he might want you to be, I know I wouldn't be happy if my parents married someone else but it is also not my decision.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|sPOm6xifaa	i don't necessarily think they should be "fine and dandy" but i do think its gonna be a big adjustment time for everyone. It makes it harder for the kids if the new parent is not understanding of their feelings and tries to play head games with the kids,such as not allowing them time with that parent. What makes it even harder in situations like this is when the parent always sides with who they just married.It does alot of damage to kids and their gonna need a lot of therapy.|`|50WCN0graa	No, a kid should not be expected to feel fine and dandy about their parents remarrying. That is a hard change.... hopefully, the parents can understand that a change like this is hard on their kids.<br>  <br>  At the same time, if the kid is ready to try and move past their hurt, anger, sadness, etc. (all of which may very well be justified feelings depending on the situation), then that can make the transition easier on both them (the kid) and the parents.<br>  <br>  One of the hardest parts about growing up is realizing that your parents aren't perfect, they mess up, they make mistakes.... In the long run, I think kids want their parents to be happy (just like parents want their kids to be happy), even if it hurts like heck that the parents are getting remarried. <br>  <br>  As hard as it may be to watch a parent get remarried, I think life is actually better for the kids when the parents have someone else in their life to love and care about. When parents are happier in their personal life, they are generally better parents.<br>  <br>  All that said, a kid should not be expected to feel fine and dandy about remarriage. Hopefully, though, the kids will do their best to make lemonade from what may feel like a real lemon.|`|EMKuBql8aa	I think a child who truly loves his/her parent would want them to be happy. And it is unreasonable to expect someone to spend the rest of their lives alone because of something most likely said out of anger. The child should be happy, but probably needs some time to get used to it, an adjustment period.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Mind me asking how old you are?? Answers can vary depending on your age.<br>  <br>  Look, I read some of your questions and it sounds like you are confused and have had a tough go at life. I'm sorry you are hurting, but in one qestion, you mentioned turning 18 next year, so as a 17 year old, you need to try to be an adult about this even though it is hard for you. Have you tried to sit down with your dad and say, "I support you in this, but I am just having a hard time imagining you with someone else, and I think I needhelp with this?" It is unreasonable to expect him to never remarry, you are old enough to like boys and one day want to get married and those feelings didn't go away for your dad. One day, you will go away either to college or moving out and he will be alone if he doesnt have a spouse, you don't want that do you??|`|J3JClsuQaa	I understand your pain because you love your mom, but depending on how long it's been ya gotta give your dad a break.  You want him to be happy, don't you?  You know he loves your mom too and always will... and if you think about it... Don't you think she would have wanted him to be happy too.  Give him and her a chance, try to understand it from his side...  and Good luck... I lost my mom young too, so BELIEVE me, I understand...|`|prqrQcd1aa	I've never been married before, so i'm going to have to say yes here!<br>  <br>  I have seen some of your other questions on here before. I know you are not comfortable with your father getting married again.. Can I ask you why?|`|rTaaIXSuaa	It wouldn't be fair to assume your kid SHOULD be fine about you remarrying. That all depends on their age too.<br>  I have been single for 10 years. By choice. <br>  I decided to put men on the back burner and just concentrate on raising my kids. Reason being is that I didn't want to get into a relationship when my kids were young, then have them develop a relationship with the man, then we split. They had been through enough at such a young age and couldn't put them through hell again.<br>  Both my boys are now 17 and 19 and know that I deserve happiness and are glad that I am getting married. My daughter 13, however is not so happy about it. It has been me and her for the last 10 years and is having a hard time adjusting to having a man all of a sudden step into our lives. I understand and we are taking our time with her and working it out. I know in time it will pan out.|`|Mm5NsrF8aa	no, of course you are going to be full of lots of different emotions when your dad remarries...he should not have promised never, but at the time I'm sure he said it to comfort you.<br>  you are sounding very selfish for not allowing your father to find happiness with someone new, someone besides you, someone besides your mother...you cannot know how much a husband grieves when he loses a wife and has to raise their child without their partner...you should be able to find acceptance and support for your father. A second wife does not replace your mother. You need to talk to a professional about your difficulty with this, no it's not easy. But not being supportive of your father's future happiness, calling him a liar, and not being happy about this are all expected emotions that you have to get over, to work through...|`|8WOzftFuaa	wow seriously your 17... I know its tough to deal with your parents splitting and re-marrying but you know what you are almost an adult, do you think your daddy should wait around for you and not have a life of his own??<br>  <br>  I'm sorry unless you are hoping your parents will get back together, you cant control his life lke in a few years you wont be around and you will be living your own life so why cant he have his|`|AA11104372	If I ever got divorced, I wouldn't expect my kids to be fine and dandy with my re-marrying.  I imagine they would be very upset by it.  That's why, if I were in that situation, I would wait until my kids were in college before I would consider re-marriage.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	I think the child should want their mom or dad to be happy, and respect their decision.  As long as the person they are marrying is not disrespectful or mean to the child they should accept it. My dad got divorced from my mom 10 years ago, he just remarried and it is so great finally seeing him happy.|`|92529423230d8afd2de97a390c4c8c8faa	No I don't think your children should ever be fine and dandy with your remarrying whether you said you would remarry or not. I was a teenager when my parents divorced and  I was an adult when my parents remaried and I was not "handy dandy" with it.|`|64OsCr8laa	if the kids are old enough to understand love and understand a mother has feelings to then yes i would expect them to be ok with it,. but if you are like 8 or 9 then i would understand some problems arising but 14 and older should understand and know things|`|jLI0IgWkaa	no, you don't have to be happy. He wants you to be happy, because he's thinking of his happiness, and you're not being happy with his decisions makes him feel guilty about it. and that diminishes his happiness in this marriage that he so wants. You can just continue letting him know, that you're not happy, and why you aren't happy, and that you don't feel comfortable at all with his current choice of a wife (especially since you feel she's slutty, and doesn't care too much about you.) Let your father know that you feel that he's choosing her over you, and that makes you very sad.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck . I wish I could make things better for you.|`|GjpU7aBbaa	I'm 13 and when my dad got remarried it was absolute hell for me. His wife really screwed up my life and has hurt my whole family and ruined my relationship with my father. If you are marrying someone you know really well and have been with for a long time that helps. If they act well together and like each other is an important thing too.
aJLx0nhNaa	If your doctor said it was impossible to be pregnant did he also say why all those tests were positive?  I mean, if you're really not pregnant, there must be a medical explanation.|`|yB5go5wbaa	Hmmm.  It definitely sounds like you are, it's rare to get a false positive, let alone 7.  I have watched shows where women were told it's impossible to get pregnant and then they do get pregnant (and some don't know it for nine months).  I would schedule an ultrasound to be absolutely sure.  Congratulations if you are!|`|zSABr7praa	I've heard of false negatives, but never false positives!  Congrats :)|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	Weird. God said it times to bless you with a child. Good Luck.|`|7C9Ett7Caa	You definately have HCG in your system, which means your pregnant.. My aunt has PCOS and they told her she could never have kids..she has a son and is pregnant with a daughter, so that shows you right there that doctors arnt always right. If I were you, I would act as if i were pregnant for a couple weeks (meaning no alcohol, drugs, medicines, etc..) and after the couple weeks, schedule an ultrasound. I think you definately are prego!! Good luck!!|`|OQb533GPaa	If you read the fine line on the paperwork that comes with your pregnancy tests it explains that it is possible for a false positive.  You could have something like endometriosis which can give you a false positive . . . otherwise, yes, it is rather rare.    If you are going to an OBGYN, he/she should be able to tell right off the bat if you're pregnant just by doing an ultrasound.      Hopefully you have been blessed and are on your way to mommihood.  :)|`|znjl6WrWaa	well it sounds to me like you're pregnant. Your doctor should schedule an ultrasound to verify pregnancy|`|yB8djbeNaa	I would go to another doctor the chances of 6 positive urine tests and a positive blood test being wrong are ridiculously low.  I would say you are pregnant|`|FgAPXhVRaa	I hope you are pregnant... I have never heard of false positives!! Congrats if you are!! :)|`|eU5Eth2aaa	No such thing as a false positive!  Congrats on your little miracle!|`|BMGEi0yCaa	Firstly, I honestly don't think anything is impossible. I've known people who were diagnosed with cancer and given 2 months to live, and lived for years and years beyond that. I've known people whom were hit by cars, fell into a coma, and whose families were told they wouldn't survive and if they did, they would never be the same. Yet, now they're walking around today, almost as if nothing ever happened. So, nothing is impossible in my eyes.    As for getting 7 false positives, that is EXTREMELY rare. In fact, it's rare to get 1 false positive. So it definitely sounds like you're pregnant. Congrats! =o)    If your doctor is too stubborn to believe it, I think it may be time to find a new one. Good luck and congrats again!|`|dbafItLvaa	Miracles happen!  Congratulations, and good luck!|`|96f1438ccfd49dc1a27e3e2cb9700945aa	It depends; I think it says right on the box that conditions such as PCOS could give you a false positive result. I know that certain fertility drugs using hcg  and certain conditions including cysts can give you a false positive result also.    I would ask the gynecologist for an ultrasound to confirm. Good luck!|`|jZPv153Jaa	i would call this a miracle!!!! you are prego congrats. . . . . !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ox6SXta4aa	I am SHOCKED - you would think the doctor would know if you were pregnant with the hysteroscopy.  But the only other reason a test comes up positive is because of a tumor...doubtful.  I would say you are or you were...time to have the doc do an ultrasound and 'see' what's going on.|`|7f5af7e7fb02a50e93290cbababdc097aa	7 positives?? Congrats!! If your doctor is refusing to believe it and won't look into it, please find another doc. Congrats!|`|t2XOjDy4aa	There is no such thing as a false pregnancy. Good luck with the new baby :)|`|sfYY9QGVaa	I think I have told you this several times already, but just last month I had 8 positive hpts.....EIGHT!!!! And come to find out, my blood test and u/s was negative, I was not pregnant and I have not been able to find a doctor yet tell my why that would have happened. And I didn't misread my tests, I showed them to several people who saw the lines when I did the line tests and they gradually got darker and even had 2 or 3 of the digital tests say pregnant. So good luck to you and baby dust, but thats just what happened to me. Talk about heartbreak.    -Addition; and I would also like to add that the same day of the negative u/s I was checked for tumors, fibroids, PCOS, cancer.... basically everything you could think of to cause a positive and had NOTHING wrong with me....
GhZWcFSNaa	yes with this 1 m so scare that i,ll go late m already 38 weeks and 3days.and m scare all the time.|`|W1p6LetFaa	I have a very strong feeling that my baby is going to be late and have pretty much always "known" this. But I guess we'll see.  I'm due in 3 days... And still showing no signs that this pregnancy will ever end, haha.  I haven't lost my plug, I'm only finger-tip dilated, my cervix is still very high, and my baby hasn't dropped yet.  But I guess I could be pleasantly surprised!|`|Lprtz2A9aa	I was worried mine would be early. Both me and my brother were 6 weeks early and all my cousins had they're kids 3 weeks early. I ended up having my son exactly 3 weeks early.
2f49jsLpaa	We send letters for our children's first-mothers (translated into Korean) and photos to the adoption agency in Korea, and they're placed in our children's file. It is unlikely that they will ever reach them, but we want them to be there just incase. Our children will also be able to access these files once they are old enough and travel to the Korean agency. I think it will be a nice thing for them to have too.|`|VFifg9FEaa	This is a great idea.  My daughters we both in foster care in China, so we write letters to the foster family. They are the girls first families in a way.  We keep copies of the emails we send.  I guess if we ever do get to meet the bio moms we will have copies for them. <br>  <br>  This is also a great way to do a "baby" book for their whole childhood.  These letters will be great for the APs to read in 20, 30 years from now.|`|3i7hufq4aa	I will definitely want to do this when our kiddo is finally joined with our family. It breaks my heart knowing there is almost no possibility of discovering her true origins, but if writing letters to her mom opens the door even a teeny crack, then who knows what Good Things may result.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	I'm not either but I think its a wonderful idea. Like you said even if there is only the slightest chance of one day finding their mothers it would be something you would have for her. <br>  <br>  Even if you never find her it would still be something nice to have for yourself to be able to look back over and remember all of those little things that can be forgotten. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't have thought of doing this but one day I think its something I would certainly try to do for my kids and their moms.
b1WMcGQ0aa	When I was breast feeding, I occasionally had a beer. I pumped a bottle before hand, so that even though you are supposed to wait a few hours, I waited about 5-6 hours at least and just fed my baby a bottle in between feedings. I know this is weird, and I read other moms comments on this, but Guiness actually increases breast milk. I am not kidding! I had one and my breast milk production really increased!<br>  <br>  My baby never acted any differently by the way.|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	No I have never noticed a difference in how my daughter acted, b/c I am always responsible about it.<br>  I normally have my 1-2 drinks after she has gone to bed for the night..or Ill have a drink right after feeding her..if I want to have more, then Ill just use some stored BM to feed her<br>  ..<br>  o and..I believe it says on kelly mom<br>  one drink is considered a 4oz glass of wine..or one beer. No hard alcohol though|`|hbOFDysJaa	I only had a glass of red wine.  Other than that, i "pumped and dumped".  I hate that terminology, but in this case I had to use it.  :)|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	I have three kids who all breastfed for at least a year.  My oldest nursed for 14 months, my next for 2 1/2 years, and I'm still nursing my 18-month-old.  I have been nursing and/or pregnant for the last 6 1/2 years, and while I do give up alcohol while pregnant, I don't think the occasional drink while nursing is harmful.<br>  <br>  I have had drinks with all of them.  Obviously, I didn't breastfeed while trashed, and I don't think I had any alcohol at all until they were at least a couple months old (probably closer to 6 months).  I have had 1-2 drinks and nursed normally throughout the night and never noticed a difference in their behavior.  If I'm just at home, I might have one drink once a week or every other week (like a glass of wine with dinner or a beer with my husband on Friday night), and my 18-month-old still nurses throughout the night, and I've noticed no effect on him.  Sometimes I wish it would help him sleep better, but no such luck.  ;-)<br>  <br>  If your child is sleeping through the night, you could have about as much as you wanted because you would be sober by morning.  As long as you are sober enough to drive, you're sober enough to nurse.  Truly, not much alcohol gets into the breastmilk, and once it's out of your system, it's also out of your milk, so there's no need to pump and dump.<br>  <br>  Enjoy that glass of wine!  :-)|`|AA11757270	I've never had more than one here or there when I was breastfeeding, but despite all the old wives tales, alcohol actually reduces milk production.|`|Bz8tcAOyaa	I haven't met any yet.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	i dont really but once every 3-4 mons i may have ONE last week i ahd a margarita and fed my daughter 2 hrs later was maybe still buzzed slightly...she slept better lol but i wouldnt recommend it.|`|UghJ0XROaa	I have went out to dinner with my husband and had a glass of wine with dinner and neither of my babies ever acted differently. I have had a couple at home. I would breast feed Shyla, she would go to sleep, i would have a glass, so by the time she woke up there is none in my system. I would not want to risk anything more than a glass of wine.
AA11021960	Absolutely... I have three, 11 yrs, 8 yrs and 7 months old.  With our third we told ourselves to really relish in it and enjoy every second because it goes by way too fast.  And now at only 7 month I am really missing it, lol.  It went by faster, it seems, than my other two did!  He won't lay in my arms and cuddle and coo..  instead he will wriggle out of my arms to get on the floor and go go go.  I also miss how tiny they are when they are newborn.  We actually were talking today and I made the comment... Mommy needs to get in shape to have one more before the 'gates close' on the factory, lol.  I have all boys and a girl would be cool, lol. (or another boy, really don't care, lol)<br>  The trade off is that I may not get to snuggle a whole lot, but I do hear "Mom, your cookin is great!" or  I get little pictures and notes that say "Mom your the best Mom ever!".  I also get told I am beautiful a lot (which mommy really needs to hear sometimes, lol)|`|6RGnG1ukaa	Oh God yes. My children are 2, 4, and 6. They are so cute. It's wonderful to watch them grow up though, and see them age, healthy and happy. But I think every mommy misses her baby "being a baby".|`|92529423230d8afd2de97a390c4c8c8faa	Yes of course I miss my baby "being a baby".<br>  My baby is nine months old and my oldest son is ten years old.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Yes :( I loved holding my baby and rocking them and feeding them. Why oh why do they have to grow up?|`|rrMYRLpXaa	I'm sorry; I'm not a mother, so I may not be eligible to answer the question but...<br>  <br>  I have a sister who's 10+ years younger than me. She's 2 years old now. <br>  Although I still do snuggle with her and kiss her as much as I did when she was younger, she seems more determined to escape from my grasp. When she was younger, she would be wrapped up tightly in a small blanket and wouldn't be able to move so I would be able to hug her as long as I wished, but nowadays she resists and breaks from my hugs in 5 seconds. <br>  <br>  This question is very nostalgic indeed...looking back, it's amazing how much she's progressed and grown. :)|`|9qjgKq6caa	My baby is going to be 8 years old very soon, so to see you ask this question with a 5 month old made me smile...lol.  Yes I wish they stayed babies (my oldest is 10) but mostly I am glad to see them growing up so healthy.  I still get lots of hugs and kisses from my youngest and occassionally my oldest will sneak one in.<br>  <br>  :o)|`|M6c0hUefaa	I know. My daughter is almost 11 months and used to LOVE falling asleep on my chest almost every night. Now, she'll hardly let me hug her when she wakes up from her naps. :(...
MpKjfGGaaa	I've heard that its possible to still get your period for up to 2 months after you become pregnant, you just wont be menstrating an egg. You should probably take another pregnancy test or go see your doctor.  Good Luck!|`|hrEQXFdYaa	I hear of pregnant women having periods or bleeding quite often... I too bled a tiny bit but not normal and wondering the same thing...|`|xzh8r0jIaa	thats how it happened for me    when my period was suppost to start i had it for a couple of days very light, then around implantaion a couple of weeks later i spotted for a few days, then it stopped
OJ0POy4Xaa	I think if your ultrasound looks good then you and the baby are fine. There is some truth to 20 weeks being a better ultrasound, but with my 3rd child (5th pregnancy) I was bleeding at 14 1/2 weeks and the ultrasound showed placenta previa, so problems definitely can be detected if they are there. <br>  You've made it past the first trimester, your odds of this pregnancy thriving are very good. <br>  Just try to relax. Easier said than done, but still. <br>  Congrats!|`|7C9Ett7Caa	Girl, calm down! lol<br>  Im sure ur baby is fine. Alot of the online sites say ur baby should b around 1 ounce, but thats only the average.. Ur probably just gonna have a big healthy baby. Fetuses, at every gestational age, grow differently. <br>  Please dont stress urself out, stress is not good for the baby, and not good for u either. Just try to relax.. Soak in a warm bath with soothing music, read to ur baby, get a pedicure, etc..<br>  Congrats on the pregnancy!!|`|HSUfe3m7aa	Oh honey. Welcome to motherhood. You worry for 9 months, then 18 years after that. All babies are different weights at different times. If they said everything looked good, they meant it. They can tell signs of things being wrong before 20 weeks and if there was ANYTHING amiss, they would order a level 2 ultrasound to get more detail.<br>  <br>  You and your baby are fine, relax and try to enjoy :)|`|UVwRSpDjaa	Just know that your normal and everyone ...everyone gets worried and paranoid about the baby being healthy. I know I did and still do. You'll always worry about your child even when he/She is here.|`|dc500182581d351f03c845444a3479f5aa	You got the next 50 years to worry about your kids ..<br>  Try to relax and enjoy it
1z3C0R2Vaa	Wait and test in a few days good luck...........|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	It is normal for your cycle to be a little out of sync when you first stop taking the pill.  It is actually better to wait a month or so to try to become pregnant after discontinuing the pill.|`|4DoXomHZaa	Your body is out of whack because it was used to mega doses of synthetic hormones that suddenly aren't there. As we get older our body has different ways of reacting to things like this.    Your period is probably delayed due to the pill and the stress hormones you are creating in the desire to get pregnant.    You only have a 20% of getting pregnant each month so I'm afraid you will need patience.|`|9ke35LD0aa	Yes it is normal the same thing happened to me and I went to my doctor she said it was normal getting off the pill and your cycle messing up.        GOOD LUCK WITH A BABY KEEEP  TRYING :)|`|AA12300309	I'm in the same boat right now, only my period is 4 days late and I took a hpt 2 days ago and it was negative. I'm going to wait til friday to take another, as that is when I'll be a week late. I've been off the pill for 3 months and my cycles have been regular, coming every 30 days. I don't know what's going on either, hopefully we'll both get our answer soon. If not, maybe a call to the dr is in order for us both. Best of luck!
GLfsQ9P7aa	Everyone is different but I think some of that is bloating. I'm about that size now and I'm 19 weeks :)  .. you have a cute bump tho.  Congrats!|`|vc67fw68aa	Did you get a sonogram>? If not they can check your date and they can see if you have 2 in there ... <br>  <br>  You dont look bloated but you could be ... then again you could be having twinkies ;]<br>  <br>  either way you are fine as long as your doc says your healthy ... I looked 5 months when I was 3 months but my baby was huge~ [my husband is 6'7'']<br>  <br>  could this be a posibility too? Dont worry so much and enjoy your belly now ... soon it will be a blur :[<br>  <br>  Good luck~|`|K2jT1z5jaa	To me you look futher along. Although it could be bloating <br>  <br>  Around 16 weeks belly.if it your first yes you look bigger. <br>  <br>  i would go with bloating  or more than 1<br>  god bless|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Are you sure there is only 1 in there?  If so then it has to be bloating.
Cqgv9Wx1aa	I have 4 children and with each pregnancy i suffered with headaches . My other symptoms were going off hot drinks , certain smells would make me feel ill (leather and strong perfume!) and I was sooo tired for the first 3 months.  I think its too early to take a test , probably wait to see if your period is on time .|`|KozoNqpsaa	Wait until the 7th or 8th and if it doesn't start, take a test then. Make sure you do it first thing in the morning!|`|NLxcfGplaa	it is probably to soon to tell.  but wait and see if you have your period.  if you don't take a test|`|ueDqd80daa	You sound just like me.....I avoided the symptoms for 8 weeks and realized just last week that I'm pregnant! If you're hesitant about taking a home-pregnancy test, go see your doctor! (don't worry, I don't trust them either! I went straight to my doctor)|`|N6XTcGejaa	wait till you miss a period and test. common pregnancy symptoms are listed here http://www.easyninemonths.com/pregnancy_...|`|FlvxzFN6aa	Your timing should have been pretty good for getting pregnant, bang in the middle of your cycle. It's a bit early to get any symptoms yet wait and see if you miss your period and take a test then - I got a weird metallic taste about a week before I was due, but as I wasn't planning on getting pregnant at the time so didn't realise it was actually a pregnancy symptom. Good luck and welcome to the Pudding club if you are pregnant too.|`|HHSMEigzaa	my period is due on the same day as yours and i'm going thur the same thing. My symptoms are a little different then yours. For the past couple of days i have had a nasty taste in my mouth and my mouth has been watering alot more. Today i just start feeling really tired. i have also been using the bathroom alot more but i also been drinking alot of water cause i got a uti from out of no where. I'm take a test if my period don't show and you should too.    Hope everything works out
077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	This is allot easier, requires no surgery what so ever and it permanent and as effective as getting your tubes burned.      http://www.essure.com/|`|bQk0vpfSaa	geez, im not sure. I would just ask your doctor.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I'm not sure but when I was looking into that I found that it is much simpler if you get a cesarean section because they can tie your tubes through the same incision and then you only go through one surgery.  Your doctor will know a lot more about it.|`|96f1438ccfd49dc1a27e3e2cb9700945aa	My cousin had it done right after the birth of her son; he was born in the afternoon and she went in for surgery the next afternoon. She spent a few hours in recovery because of complications, but went home the next day with the baby. It was done through the belly button so no scar, but she did mention she had some discomfort & pain a few weeks after giving birth (more than her friend who'd also given birth during the same time through a second C-Section); I don't know if it was related to the actual birth or the surgery, or the fact that she had the surgery after giving birth. Good luck.|`|bTzw1JDwaa	I don't recommend getting your tubes tied. Everyone I know that's done it strongly regrets it.
ZDqdYhdGaa	Yes but it is dangerous for the baby. There really is no reason to not wait it out. If 2 fathers are in question it will be hard, especially if the father wants to be there for the delivery, but it would be selfish to risk the babies well being to put the parents mind at ease. Wait it out!<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Congrats!|`|b3dbc99139f2374f30ad1ee8aae5245faa	Yes. Two different testing methods can be gathered from the baby while still developing in the mother's womb. One test, called chorionic villus sampling, is conducted only between weeks 10 to 12 of pregnancy. This test involves retrieving a small sample of tissue from the placenta. Another test, called amniocentesis, is performed between weeks 15 and 18 of pregnancy. This test involves passing a needle through a mother's abdomen to the womb in order to withdraw a small sample of amniotic fluid. . The collected samples are then forwarded to a laboratory for examination. Although technically possible to confirm paternity with these tests, the risk of harm to the developing baby--although remote-- should be considered. For this reason, it's generally advised that paternity testing be postponed until the child is born, if possible.|`|Yx5GlOJDaa	Yes it can be done but there are risks with doing a procedure like that. It can rupture the membranes which would put the mother into preterm labor if she is under 38 weeks. Your better off waiting until after the baby is born and than have a paternity test done if you feel like you need to.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	Yes but good luck finding a doctor willing to do amniocentesis just for a paternity test. Wait until the baby is born and have it done then. They use the mouth swab method and can do it in the nursery before Mom & Baby leave the hospital.|`|lzivF4Idaa	yeah but it poses risk to the baby, just wait it out.|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	Yeah, but its pretty risky.  In general if its just for a paternity test and not a genetic test then they will have the parents wait until after the baby is born.

You are all sisters.  I don't think there is anything dirty about it.|`|AA10309649	I don't think that's a problem. You're sisters after all.   In the olden days, that's what people did.

Instead of having to take four showers, one after the other, you take one.|`|TmphBGSfaa	that's..  odd ?|`|tg9D0tVGaa	i guess its okay if thats they way u were brought up  i mean thats how they did it back in the day  but its still kinda weird|`|34d78d63496145ce5e1641251800b598aa	me and my sister who is my age have taken bathes together since we were young.. when i was 20 we still did every once in a while.. no big deal to me|`|4dQjVb59aa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|yqAwWO4uaa	No it's not okay.  And you feel weird because it's not normal for a 15 year old boy who is growing sexually mature to take showers with 3 young women who are related to him.  There is probably some attraction physically as well and you know in your mind that you shouldn't be excited by them.  Also, most 15 year old boys are still unsure about their bodies and are uncomfortable showing them off to anyone.   How much of a hurry can you be in where the 4 of you need to share a shower?  And what do your parents think of this?  Is full nudity in front of your family members a regular occurrence in the house?|`|5wt0En1Zaa	It's fine if you do it once or twice.  Many people go to public showers where they see everyone naked!  But then if they keep wanting to do it, it's not right.  Even worse if they touch you etc. this is NOT ok.  They are not allowed to force you to do something you don't want to do  Plan when you want to have a shower to avoid this.|`|xZvzLztZaa	It's definitely unorthodox at your ages.|`|rhzyzEteaa	um.........................................  are u a girl or boy?    im a girl, and im 16. my 9 year old sis wont get a shower by herself wen i babysit her so i usally hav to climb in and shampoo her hair T.T  but i have my clothes on and i dont actually get a shower ................  so yea.............no|`|2Lz7jFxwaa	I totally can understand why you feel  weired about it.

MCeh0uIaaa	Jan, there is something wrong with you. First off there is a time for plurals and there is a time for singulars. Second, gays, lesbians, and bisexuals don't all act like that. Lastly, you can't be pressured into being gay...|`|x4uGfC4oaa	No one can pressure anyone into being gay. It's a personal choice.|`|YkSPMvg5aa	So, by your question, you are saying that gay and bisexual people don't brush their teeth, don't know how to dress and don't brush their hair?

Maybe a little chat with her will do you both good and discuss a few things with you of whether she is a lesbian or bisexual.    Hope i helped =)  x|`|7qAlZRHmaa	Im not none of them but I have went through a phase where i would do that. You would need to talk to her and ask her about stuff like that and tell her that you are open to it if she is gay because if a mother is not supportive of there disicion then she will hide stuff from you even if you are not supportive of it tell her you are but i think its a phase alot of girls go through it|`|ZWUBlIfoaa	how is that being gay?|`|Y0ffbZKraa	Alright here we go    1) Getting dressed up one day and not getting dressed up the next does not make you bisexual or a lesbian. A lot of people do that.    2) You cannot be "pressured" into "becoming gay." You are gay or you are not, end of story. No one can MAKE you gay.    3) It doesn't matter if she IS gay or bisexual. She is still a human being, and she is still your daughter, and she still needs love and support - especially if she has to face all the homophobes in the world.    4) Calm down. To reiterate, getting dressed up one day and not getting dressed up the next does not make you gay. This isn't a big deal. You should talk to her about brushing her teeth, getting cleaned up, and wearing clean clothes though. It's just basic hygiene.|`|ClbJXmr6aa	i go to school in sweat pants all the time|`|Sjb4jauxaa	that's not being gay. that's being lazy. most teenagers are. and even if your daughter is gay, you should accept her for who she is and not judge her. and if you didn't know any of this, you dint really know kids very well, do you?|`|KHx03e6baa	I only ever wear a dress if i'm a bridesmaid. If i get married i will wear a dress but that is it.     I'm not gay. I wear jeans and never wear makeup unless it's a special occasion.     I have a boyfriend who is fine with the way i am.     You daughter is just feels like a tomboy somedays and a girly girl the next.    I don't wear clothes to make a fashion statement and i don't want to conform to the social standard so i wear what i feel comfortable in.    I also went through a phase when i was 11 of not brushing my hair. And even now sometimes i wear clothes for two days in a row.|`|Z7dShLRLaa	WTH?    Idk. It jsut means your daughter doesnt have very good hygiene.  Ew    LOL. It doesnt mean she's gay. HOW IGNORANT.    Gays are actually very clean people LOL. No ofeensive intended.|`|2a6KI95Vaa	She's just trying to figure out who she is A girly girl or someone who lives sports and wants to be athletic|`|AA11311675	So being lazy is part of being bisexually gay?|`|256cVXsmaa	why are you associating wearing sweatpants and not getting ready for school with being a bi or a gay person lol??? soo strange.

She probably is just sick of school and doesn't want to get ready everyday.  It probably has nothing to do with her sexual preference.   And also if she is bi or gay than you have to just accept that because it is your daughter and she needs your support.  I doubt she is bi or gay though just because she likes sweatpants =]|`|vVd4pw35aa	lol sorry that was dump...|`|fWWYc2UZaa	newsflash: gay people wash their hair and brush their teeth. they also change clothes.   anyways, maybe she just doesnt feel like getting all done up and stuff every morning? maybe she wants to impress a guy, who knows. it's really none of your business.|`|rE9J1DqTaa	Are you saying that bi's, gays, and lesbians are dirty and that they dont clean themselves. If thats what your saying then your an a$$.    your daughter is probably  just going through a phase theirs times when you just are being lazy. You shouldn't let her go to school with out at least brushing her teeth her breath probably smells. Gays Bis and Lesbians aren't dirty.      Oh and you cant be pressured into being gay. Most of the time your born gay you cant just say i think im going to have sex with the same sex.
jaP0TANdaa	Some doctors (many actually) will prescribe Clomid to help with a short luteal phase along with prometrium (an oral progesterone supplement) or progesterone suppositories. Personally, my luteal phase is typically only 10 days. From what I've read, this can cause problems and most doctors will state that anything under 12 days could be an issue (though some say it's anything less than 10 days). I started taking Vitex this cycle to try and help... and it did! In just one cycle of taking Vitex I ovulated sooner than usual (on CD11 instead of CD16) and my luteal phase was extended by two days (up to 12 days this cycle). I can only hope that continued use will just keep making things better as Vitex is known to have a cumulative effect over time. That's a personal choice for you though. Many doctors will go ahead and see and treat you if you can confirm/prove a luteal phase defect. So, you can go to the doctor and get medical intervention, or you can try the Vitex and see if that helps out. Good luck to you and tons of baby dust your way.|`|gdnL63ngaa	That means you have not enough progesterone to get a thick lining to support a fertilized follicle.    It should be longer. I had to take progesterone suppositories as well as an oral med with in-vitro.    Talk to your doctor about this as its very important|`|qgJDdCiHaa	I ahve what appears to be a short luteal phase, on paper. It's not as consistant as one might would hope for either. It's been as short as 5 days and as long as 11 days, but there is hope. I've had 5 healthy babies, so either my body just isn't showing a thermal shift til much later than my actual ovulation, or somehow, I've managed to get pregnant and have 5 healthy babies anyhow. Clomid as someone already mentioned is for ovulation, but there are a few options to keep your progesterone levels up. There's suppository and I think there's an injectible form as well, which you would have to keep up until the baby is well implanted and can start manufacturing it's own via the placenta.|`|4DoXomHZaa	Clomid is for women who are not ovulating properly, it will not affect your luteal phase.    And a short luteal phase does not prevent you from getting pregnant unless it is very very short.
qBJLuCO0aa	dunno just does... except in a leap year than it has 29 days|`|pXSKSS3daa	All months contain 28 days. :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/442/how-come-february-has-only-28-days" rel="nofollow">http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read...</a>|`|p0prrzf2aa	i have no clue..<br>  <br>  your suppose to have 365 days in a year, if Feb had more days it wouldn't equal to 365 anymore?<br>  <br>  that's just my guess :)|`|7VJcd5YLaa	This all goes back to the Romans who named the months of the year after their emperors (Julius Caesar  - July, Augustus - August).  The men would take more days for their months, by stealing days from the February.  <br>  <br>  When Pope Gregory "fixed" the calendar, things were a real mess, the months stayed the way they were, and since February was the month with the fewest days - it was "given" the leap day every four years.
8rFLi29xaa	You poor thing. Sleep deprivation is awful. In my experience, some babies are just crap sleepers, and some are good sleepers, some need lots of help to learn how to sleep, and some just do it naturally. My daughter, 9 months, needed lots of help and still does sometimes.     Ok so here is my thought. Your daughter is relying on sucking on the bottle to get herself to sleep. She probably isn't hungry when she wakes, at least not every time. You need to teach her to fall asleep in a different way, on her own, so she can get herself back to sleep without a prop each time she wakes in the night. A dummy would just be another prop, so I would ditch that.     I had this problem and I'm sorry to say that the only thing that got anywhere near to sorting it out did involve some crying. It didn't feel right to me to leave my baby to cry on her own, so what I did was this: put her in her cot at the beginning of the night after her feed, but awake. That's really important. She cried. A lot. But eventually she went to sleep. When she woke up during the night, I would pick her up if needed but not feed her. Mostly I tried not to pick her up. But she knew I was there. She cried a lot again, but a bit less each time. After 3 mights, she slept through for the first time.    I have to be honest and say things are still not perfect, but they are a lot better.   Your daughter isn't 'playing you up' as one other poster has suggested. She's not trying to manipulate you. She just doesn't know how to put herself to sleep and gets cross and frustrated.   You could also try an earlier bedtime, say 7.30 pm. This sometimes helps and your daughter might actually sleep longer rather than just waking up earlier.   Best of luck - it's hard and makes you sick to hear of all these newborns who sleep through the night - I know, been there, got the tee-shirt!|`|r5R2nstRaa	really this is just part of mother hood, have you tried singing, a nice bath, reading a book? if you get your child into a routine bed time every night, then you can be okay. if nothing else works well then there is really not much else to do. you'll get through it as your child gets older. good luck!|`|U3jS5k9eaa	When you find the answer please let me know Lol. My little boy is just over 10 months and is still very restless at night, like your little one this has continued since birth. Mine eats loads during the day but still drinks 2 or 3 6oz bottles during the night. I am aware that he doesn't need to be fed in the night but otherwise he refuses to go back to sleep and its an even longer night :) I permanently feel like a zombie but hope he will realise VERY soon that night time is for sleeping. Good luck hun xx|`|E5CnUdhsaa	is she waking up to eat?? is it possible that she wants more in the day? maybe put her to bed after a bottle earlier like 7pm so that you can then feed her agin at 10pm. then you can rule out hunger. if not then persevere without the bottle it will work eventually with a long lasting solution.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	At that age she is perfectly capable of going through the night without eating for 12 hours.    She is playing you up.  Seriously, put her to bed t 7pm and shut the door,  Stop going in to see her!  She will soon get the message.|`|RuHtOvnJaa	wow finally some one in my shoes isnt it annoying our older babies dont sleep like sum of these newborns who apperntly sleep 12 hours grr lol my 8 month old son hasnt slept once through the night he like yr daughter wakes every hour sumtimes even every half an hour for a twist he goes down at 8 and by 12 he is in my bed as thats the only way i get him to stop crying. he still wont sleep all nite even in my bed but sleeps a liitle better. have u tryed this i know co sleeping is not rite but wen your on the edge!!! i have constant bags under my eyes and get about 3 hours sleep a nite if im lucky. but while he is in my bed for some reason he sleeps later in the morning we rarely get up b4 8 and this morning it was 9 lol and that is with no feeds as i stopped his bottle at about 5 months as i knew he didnt need it and he wud still wake up all the tine even if i fed him so i knew it wasnt hunger. anyhow my advice wud be maybe give co sleeping a go it works for me wey better then in his cot all nite cos then i really am up every half an hour but while hes in my bed its every few hours and i just put dummy back in and he gos straight bak down im sorry this was longggggg bit of advice but good luck!!|`|1f8c660f42fb2996d0008deba351015daa	My son has been a crap sleeper from day one as well.  Very few naps during the day, maybe an hour total.  He goes to sleep at 9pm and gets up by 7am at the absolute latest.  He slept through the night all by himself at about 4 1/2 months but that went out the window at about 6 months.  I'm still trying to get him to sleep through the night again.  I am not a fan of the CIO method; especially when other members of the family are trying to sleep as well.  I usually start out by turning his noise machine on (usually the ocean waves do the trick, but he's also a fan of the rain storm) and putting his pacifier in his mouth.  But in the end, I will do whatever it takes to put him to sleep.  Sleep deprivation is just part of the "mommy job description" right now.  I figure I'm not going to be doing it when he graduates from high school, so in the meantime, we may as well all be as happy as possible.|`|GPW6HUZFaa	It's possible that she is teething.  You could try giving her infant tylenol.  You'll have to ask the doctor how much is recommended for her weight though.  My daughter is teething and tylenol helps her.  She's 7 months old too.  I'm sorry you're not getting any rest at all.  Are there any family members who are willing to help out a little so you can get some rest?|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	Give her a nice warm bath with J & J bedtime bath, rub her with teh lotion as well and read her a book. It works for me and my baby is 3 months|`|nnKtP60Oaa	I'll feed my son rice cereal around 8:30 then give him a bath and then he'll pass out until he wants to nurse around 2 am....then he's good until about 6 am...|`|9kMJJ1giaa	I do not think you should give her any medication, with out consulting with her doctor first.  Have you talked to her doctor about her sleeping habits?  I am praying you do have someone who can come and help you out with getting some rest yourself. Hang in there and remember, they are only little once!
acO6BCGwaa	Try reading her a story before bed, and tell her she can have her binky after the story and only if she needs it.  Try to read until she falls asleep.  When she wakes up after nap or the next morning, make a huge deal out of how she was such a big girl and slept without her binky.  Also reward her the first time or two (a snack, prize, special time with mommy, something simple).  Hopefully she will be ok with listening to a story without it, having you right there with her being the one reading should also be comforting.  Eventually she will be fine without, even if you only read a short story and she doesn't fall asleep during it.  For the first week or, you'll need to read until she is asleep.  Make sure she doesn't know where you keep the binkies.  Good Luck|`|bPHU2JKaaa	awww sorry i cant help i have a 16 month old that loves her binky i cant break her heart but good luck|`|AA11327039	My daughter is now (yes I'm embarrassed) almost 4 and she still gets her pacifier when she sleeps.  She has only had it for bed time only since she's been 1.    Anyway, when I took her to the dentist at 3 years old I was sure they would say that I should take it away, but what he actually said was that her arches don't really like up properly but with continued use of the pacifier the way one would suck on a pacifier would actually pull out the arch that is not lined up properly so he actually said she could keep her pacifier. (Go me!!)    I plan to let my daughter keep it as long as she wants it.  She only gets it when she sleeps.    I would suggest to just slowly limit the amount of time she gets it until you've phased it out completely.  That  means to let her have it to fall asleep but after an hour or so, go in there and pull it out of her mouth.  After months of that, take it away after about a half hour, then 15 minutes and then just be done with it......good luck.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	My son [2 years old] needed to get rid of his binky. What i did was got all of his binkys and hung them in a tree and told him that the binky fairy was coming. The next morning there was a special toy in the bag. [like teddy bear to sleep with, bunny, blanket etc.|`|Qd0sFMdHaa	don't take it away... just cut the end off of it so that it doesn't function the same way... if she can't get the suction action she's used to, she won't want it any more. cut the end off the bulb of the binky and give it to her. she might use it for a few more days and then realize that it's not working the same as it used to. and she won't be able to cry about not having her binky.|`|145RUNQHaa	If you want to take it off her nicely you will have to wait a while longer she s not ready it would just break her heart right now whatever you tried.when she gets a bit older the time will come when she will have a better understanding and be more willing to let it go if you leave it out for father christmas in exchange for presents.right now she is just going to be devastated.i know you worry about teeth but if she just has it at nap times it will be fine it probably falls out of her mouth when she sleeps or her mouth will be open a bit more so it won t be pressing against her teeth.don t get too worried over it no matter what anyone says millions of toddlers have a pacifier as a night time comfort without any lasting problems.|`|HvoOeTVuaa	I noticed that several people suggested snipping the end off of the paci to make it less desirable.  To me, that would weaken the structure of the paci and create a choking hazard.    Instead of clipping the end off of the paci, I think it would be better to only give your daughter newborn pacifiers.  Do not buy her large pacifiers because she will never get over her "addiction".  If you give her the small newborn pacifiers she (hopefully) will lose interest.    GOOD LUCK!|`|2qjgS99Qaa	haha... sounds like my daughter.  It is really hard getting them off the paci.  But this is what i did.  her favorite character is Elmo so i went out and bought her this elmo so she can sleep with it. She slept with the paci the first night and no elmo then the next 2 nights i let her sleep with the elmo and the paci then the 3 night i let her have the elmo and not the paci she cried for a lil while (5 min or so) then she was over it.  now she is paci free!!! =) also try letting her lay down with her sippy cup with her favorite drink she will drink that till she is tired and fall right asleep this worked a night i lost elmo at target. good luck!|`|awOLJjR6aa	I had to do it and I hide it and he just lost interest.|`|Tvq32ptlaa	my brother (now 32 y/o) had this problem, my mom said I was no problem to break.  I used my mom's technique on my own son when breaking him of the habit.    Get rid of all but 2 (always good to have a spare until 100% broken).  Take a scissors and snip off a small piece of the end.  Every couple of days or once a week cut another piece off. until she can't hold it in her mouth anymore.  By then' she "should" be over her need if not {hopefully} sooner.    She may like it a bit more for a couple day's because she'll be able to suction it over her whole tongue but the smaller it gets the harder it is to use and it gets less appealing.    Good Luck!!!|`|kmQqbxpQaa	Below is a great site that I think you will find comforting.  Basically, as long as your child stops before her permanent teeth come in, then she is fine.|`|mLWYHm2vaa	My son is 18 months and I had the same problem, except with nursing. I started trying to wean him at 12 months, and after 5 months of trying different things, i had to finally say ok it's time to go cold turkey. The exact same thing happened with my older son. You should start by throwing all of the pacifiers in the trash. If you don't have any to give her, you won't be tempted to give in when she is crying at night. Tell her the pacifiers are all gone and that she's a big girl. Kids that age can understand quite a bit. You may have to put up with some (or a lot ) of crying but after a few days she will probably not even care about having one. It may seem mean to just take them away cold turkey but for some kids that's the only way to wean them from something. You can also give her something else at night when she's wanting the pacifier, like a doll or teddy bear. Good luck|`|1c32b2a7f08aa2dc2fd8c1ccbe87d1c6aa	The day after Christmas last year, 2008, we cut the tips off of my daughter's binkies.  She turned 2 years old - 4 days later on 12/30.  She actually threw one away all on her own after she tried to suck on it and it wasn't the same.  The other one, she ended up throwing away also but it took her 5-10 minutes.  She did really good.  For about a week after that, she would ask about her Binkie and we just reminded her that Binkie was yucky now and we had to throw them away.  She never cried at night for it, occasionally during the day.  It's been over a month now.  Once in a blue moon, she'll mention it and then 2 seconds later she forgets about it.  I was not a fan of cutting the tips off, but it did work for us.  Consistence is the key.  If you take it away for 1 night, then you can't give it back the next, you'll just confuse her and set her back that much more.  Be consistent!!!  Good luck!|`|AA11755924	I made it into a game.  We all gathered all the picifiers together and held them in our hand.  Then I told them a little talk about how big boys don't use foofoo's, (that's what we call them) see mommy?  Mommy doesn't use foofoo's, and daddy doesn't use them either.  It's time to throw away all the foofoo's b/c your a big boy now!  And throw them away in the trash, together.      The first night it will be tough - when she asks for it you just say, "remember your a big girl now!  We don't use those foofoo's anymore!"  Hugs, kisses, and good night.    Don't cave in!  You have to stick to your guns...now she knows that all she has to do to get her foofoo is to cry for an hour.

Then when i had an expected pregnancy with the third, i can say it was difficult for all of us. i took lesser time for everything because i had a job also at that time, and attending to all the kids became more and more stressful. it all takes a toll on your relationship with the husband, the kids and yourself. so i can say take time if you decide on having another one, you give your body a nice long recovery too.|`|Lprtz2A9aa	Taking care of two babies at the same time can be hard. My step son is 13 years older than my 1 year old second son. My brother and I were 1 1/2 years apart and we fought over everything.

G1ZgTqNcaa	The more you pump, the more supply you will create.  Also, you need to dual pump.  When I first started pumping, I did one side at a time.  When I spoke with a lactation Specialist, she said to pump both sides at the same time and it will increase your supply.  It did!  After about a week of pumping both together, my supply almost doubled each pumping.    Good luck!|`|RVCeDnsvaa	try to pump in between feedings. your body will think that you are needing to feed the baby more often and will instinctively increase the milk supply|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	Pump it every 2-3 hours even when you are not feeding baby|`|z7a9F4HNaa	the more your child will nurse the more milk supply will increase.|`|44OH7Si6aa	http://breastfeedingbasics.com/html/incr...|`|vue9NOhYaa	The simplest answer is 'nurse more'.  And without more details (how old is your baby?  How often are you nursing?  Are you pumping as well? Why do you believe your supply is inadequate?) it's hard to offer more advice than that.|`|333c5241bfa6c1a5e5841be0e72681faaa	Let your baby nurse as much as possible.  Pumping will help too.  The more nipple stimulation, the more milk you will produce.  Always empty your breasts.  Be consistent about nursing and/or pumping.  Don't diet and massage your breasts if really is a flow issue and not a production issue.|`|mgLb5Yohaa	All the above is correct: nurse or pump more. Also, your caloric intake is crucial! Don't forget to continue your healthy snacking in between meals, whether it be a yogurt, boiled egg, cheese and crackers, when your calories are low, milk will be low! Also, a tea with the herb fenugreek is known to help increase milk supply, as well.     Pump in between feedings, and remember your calories are still important. Happy breastfeeding!|`|AA11327039	About 10 - 15 minutes after baby nurses make sure you pump both sides for an additional 10 minutes.      Drink lots of fluids    I have read (old wives tale, maybe) that eating oatmeal increases milk production.
ZZzQLjaKaa	As long as you are measuring correctly for your week, then your weight is not as important. If your Dr felt you needed to gain, they would certainly let you know that. My second pregnancy I still had plenty of baby weight from the first pregnancy. I only gained 12 pounds, because I really did not "need" to put on a full 25 because believe me, I had plenty of fat stores. To look at me, no one would believe that I had just gained 12, because my tummy was still enormous.|`|fa447c4475a222c409f5813c593490c3aa	they say that is you were overweight before hand you probably won't gain much in your pregnancy|`|5l5eCRdOaa	That;s normal...every pregnancy is different!!  You are OK!!|`|gKmrp2oyaa	I don't know if you are overweight or not but that sometimes has something to do with not gaining. I'm 31 weeks pregnant and overweight. I've actually lost 10 pounds since the beginning of my pregnancy. I saw my doctor today and she said I still haven't gained any weight but she isn't worried because both me and the baby are growing. If your doctor isn't worried about it I wouldn't worry about it.|`|44OH7Si6aa	If Your doctor isn't worried, you shouldn't be. If you have the weight to lose it is better for you to do so. Being overweight while pregnant can cause lots of complications both during the pregnancy and the delivery. You should be proud of yourself and yes other women do lose while pregnant but many times it's hard to do since it is so acceptable to eat whatever you want during this stage of your life.|`|FgAPXhVRaa	I am the same way. My doctor is not worried either. He said that my caloric intake has changed and what I am eating now is better than what I was eating before! I am not worried at all and actually am really happy. I have basically maintained my weight, besides loosing 15lbs and am happier! :)|`|xzh8r0jIaa	you should have gained alittle from the baby  you must not be eating or something,|`|48f05721032a07151098ef338560718eaa	The same thing is happening to me. i simply try not to weigh myself.

LiPoEBenaa	*Ducks and covers*  You probably shouldn't post this on the "pregnancy/parenting" board. There are way too many hormonal pregnant women on here. I don't think there is a way you can not have it put on your medical record. When you do plan on having children later in life the doctors and staff will need to know about it so they can prohibit any complications that may come up due to having an abortion.    Edit: since you're also under 18 I do belive you will need parental approval correct?    Edit: You have OTHER options. You just don't wanna face up to those other options. I'm sure your mom would be more proud that you gave another family a chance (or even her) for that matter...rather than go behind her back and have an abortion. Your medical records aren't private until your considered an adult. You aren't an adult, my friend and if your mom suspect something she can still have your records pulled and find out what you did.|`|9EkFrApiaa	This isn't me being hateful but you might not be informed.  There is sufficient evidence that unborn babies DO feel abortions.  Abortions suck the baby out piece by piece (arm, leg, eye ball).  The babies heart rate increases dramatically during an abortion, this is how we know the unborn child feels it.  There are MANY people who will adopt you baby.  Consider this and watch Juno.  Also, contact a crisis pregnancy center.|`|bTzw1JDwaa	I don't recommend you get one at all, and especially from someone who isn't a doctor. If it's something your ashamed of doing then put your baby up for adoption. I'm barely 18 and i'm having a baby. There's a plethora of stress, but that doesn't mean my baby will reep the consequences of MY ACTIONS! Your baby shouldn't have to either.|`|IkuZj0Lbaa	I am not going to blast you or anything. I don't believe in abortion, but I am going to give you some info.  Here are some side effects of abortion.  Blocked fallopian tubes  Weakened cervix  uterine scarring  damage to the woman's reproductive system which may make her unable to conceive in the future.   Every child deserves a chance. If you don't want the baby, give it up for adoption.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I don't live in England, so I don't know where you can go.  However, I do know that having an abortion needs to be on your medical record for future reference for other doctors and other procedures that you may need.  If you ever do decide that you want to have a baby your doctor needs to know about past pregnancies, including this one.|`|Lx5vYz9jaa	this isn't a good section for you to try and get this sort of advice.  go to www.google.com and type in abortion.

In order to have a abortion in the UK I think you have to have it signed off by 2 doctors and also have counselling to make sure you are happy with your decision.     Try the nhs website it may tell you a bit more information. Also tel your mum or a friend you can trust so that you don't have to go it alone, and don't let all the people on here give you grief, I was never in the position you are so I wish you the best x|`|AA11611129	I don't live in England either, but I just want to tell you I understand.  I'm 25, but my son's father was not supportive and has never been involved from day 1. Like you, I first considered abortion because I didn't think I could do it on my own.  I know you are considerably younger than me, but my sister had my nephew at 17 and managed just fine. She is now 31 with a wonderful husband (not my nephew's father) and a great job. She did it and so can you. Nothing is impossible. Just make sure before you go through with an abortion that you've truly weighed all the options and what the consequences could be for each one. Abortion may seem like the only answer, but just make sure it's truly what is right for you. You don't want to regret it for the rest of your life. Good luck hun.|`|2QGwjL7Caa	their are abortion pills but they are expensive and  some clinics do free abortions and they don't tell ur parent some cost around 100-250 dollars to get one done. im not sure where or how ur abortion clinics are cause ur in England and every bodies is different but if it is ur choice good luck. u should maybe tell ur mom even though she may get super pissed, but she is ur mom and they going to help u no matter wat. if u get this abortion or if u find a way . get birth control pills and it will prevent this from happening again. good luck 2 u hope this help|`|zSABr7praa	http://www.adoption.org.uk/agencies/regi...

But when you post a question that could be perceived as naive people will have their opinions.<br>  <br>  In any case, you are not helping yourself by posting an argumentative question and saying people are, "god damn rude."  You're mud slinging right back and appear to be just as inconsiderate as those who irritate you by using offensive language.

kjgonYlgaa	When was your last period?  You would have been most fertile approximately 12-16 days after the first day of your last period.  Don't worry about things you're not sure about.  Some tests give accurate results 3-5 days before your first missed period.  wait for this time frame then test again.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's pretty early for symptoms yet but they could be. It's not out of the question. You really need to wait to test until the day your period is due. If you test before then for most women it's far far too early, even with the early result tests. Around the 24th is when you should know for sure.|`|AtVRWrwCaa	You could be pregnant. I'd wait another week or so and take another one. Most hpt's can be taken 5 days before your missed period, so if you are expecting your period soon you can take the test sooner.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|rwKlOTOraa	Take a test in a few days, but you probably have nothing to worry about.

It is inaccurate before 17 weeks to guess the gender.  I was told at 12 weeks at my ultrasound that I was having a boy only to find out at 20 weeks that they were wrong.|`|aohKqXraaa	My doctor would not tell me of my baby's gender until I was 20 wks along, because there is much room for error before 16-20 wks.  However, early on I did the chinese chart, the quiz on babyzone.com and the ring on a string wives tale, all indicated girl.. and at 20 wks my doctor confirmed it is a girl. <br>  <br>  I don't know that I'd be 100% secure if your doctor told you a specific gender at 12 wks because I know someone who's doctor told her at 16 wks she was having a girl and he was wrong.. a later ultrasound proved the baby was a boy.|`|76bf45b9051438addb6557cde36959cdaa	It may be possible to find out at 12 weeks but usually not likely.  The only way to tell is an ultrasound and your doctor will most likely not do that on your first visit (although some do). Ask your doctor when they will schedule the ultrasound (usually between 16-20 weeks) that is the best time to find out.  <br>  Or you can go to places like Fetal Fotos and pay out of pocket (like $70) and they can tell you but be advised they are not doctors and don't know anything more than how to work the scanner.|`|QCUPeW8aaa	No way possible.<br>  I had my first ultrasound at 12 weeks and the baby is shaped like a peanut with small arm buds.<br>  Basically if anyone trys to tell you they know the gender its a guess because the genitals are not even formed until around week 16 and for boys it can take til week 18 to form correctly.<br>  So basically every baby looks identical until they get there genitals so this is impossible.<br>  You'll just have to wait it out!|`|PYafv6gSaa	chinese birthing cahrts there is heaps of things but you never really know until you have a clear ultrasound usually thats about 17 weeks and over

OQnRP6xVaa	I had two children by the time I was 21...and had my tubes tied at the birth of the second one.<br>  <br>  I raised them and when my youngest was 17 I still wanted to be a mother! My husband and I did a Fly-by the IVF idea and to be honest it really was Not for me... First of All I had a big problem with the idea of injecting myself with medications approved for treating prostate cancer! And all the other chemicals that just so happened to cause my body to behave abnormally enough that I would produce an Unnatural number of Eggs... <br>  <br>  Besides, I really DID NOT want to be responsible for CREATING a life that might in anyway have special needs. I just didn't like the Risk that my desire to be a mother would cause a child to live a life with a disability or in anyway less quality. I simply could not justify spending the estimated $10,000 (if it went well the first try) to Create a life that may be difficult for my child.<br>  <br>  Instead my husband and I chose to adopt Siblings--we believed that if there would be No Biological relationship between Us and Our children it would be nice if our children were biologically related to each other!<br>  <br>  One path for that...and with a few hoops and some steps we currently witness the sibling bond (and rivalry) of our children adopted from foster care. Our children are special needs and we chose to give them a growing up family rather then create a child that may have been special needs.<br>  <br>  We are happy we made this decision...even if it has been a difficult journey.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	I would definetly adopt. me and my husband a few kids of our own and when the baby gets a little older we are planning to adopt even though we are both fully capable of having our own kids. I think it would be great to give a chid a home that needed one.it doesnt matter if they were my dna or some strangers dna they would still be my child.|`|256cVXsmaa	Adoption, but certainly not if it was just your second choice.  That adopted baby shouldn't ever be a second choice just because you are infertile.  I think adoption is amazing, giving a baby a potential great life!|`|Izn1ye9Raa	I am thinking of doing the foster to adopt program as soon as I God willing get a job next year hopefully and get an apartment complex built over my mom's garage.  I don't think an adoption agency would let me adopt a kid if there were 5 bedrooms and the child would be sleeping in my room with me.  I am doing adoption, and also plan on having bio children as well.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	My first thought would be, "Wow, I have 2 great kids- why the heck would I want anymore?" <br>   <br>  I would never adopt, because I am adopted and know the pain that goes along with it. If you want to be a parent again, try foster care.|`|j0xfBk5Caa	I wouldn't do either. I would love my two children and devote myself to raising them. <br>  <br>  Oh an loose the mine, mine, mine attitude. Children and living, breathing, feeling beings not handbags that belong to people.|`|ee7335f3bdae606bbfe534bef63fe2e0aa	I would but I have always wanted a large family.|`|7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	No, I would not adopt for that reason. I would not do IVF either. (I am seeking out sterilization right now) I would adopt to help a child, not to fulfill my own desires of having a child, but my desire to help children in need. That is why I am not involved with adoption or fostering at all right now. Right now I am not capable to be involved unless it is through volunteer work. When my own children are grown and out of the house, perhaps then I will be ready. I do not think I could take a kid away from their family though.  I would rather foster just to help families get their act together. If a situation came up though where the child's parents did not care anymore and the child is old enough to decide where he wants to go to after all other family options have been exhausted and the child decided to stay with me, I will consider it out of the best interest for the child. <br>  <br>  Children are not possessions, by the way. Yes they are your children, but for the best interest of the child, saying mine mine mine is a crazy idea, especially in the situation of adoption. Children who are adopted need to know they were adopted and they need openness with their family if available. With the attitude you show in the additional details, you may not be able to handle it when your child goes to find their family if you hide the family from the child.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	You have 2 amazing, smart, gorgeous children and that's why you want more. <br>  <br>  That's the problem.  Your children are part of you and you know what to expect with them. An adopted child will not look the same, act the same, may not be as intelligent or may have emotional/physical/mental abuse. Are you prepared to adopt a child that will ask where they came from, why they were given up, why you adopted them, etc?  Are you prepared for therapy, counseling, angry outbursts, depression, etc?  Are you prepared for the feelings of neglect and abuse and lack of love that these children often feel?  Can you afford another child and all the emotional "baggage" that comes with one?  Even an infant can have issues as they get older. They ask more questions than an older adopted child.<br>  If you want to adopt a child to give them a good, stable, loving, nurturing, understanding, forever home - then do it.<br>  If you just want another kid cause you are infertile - don't. You already have 2 wonderful bio children.|`|w2NA1KuXaa	I'm there.  I have 2 daughters, but am infertile now.  My husband and I had wanted a baby together, but that isn't to happen.  We won't do IVF because my body is nuts enough, and we don't want to monkey with stuff like that.  Adoption hasn't even been an option.  We would much rather be happy with the 2 wonderful kiddos we have than mess with my already stressed out body or participate in an industry I don't agree with just to fill my need.|`|tbKZLynQaa	We have two bio kids and are adopting.  Not because we can't have more, but because we want to help children who dont have families.  We're adopting two older kids, ages 4 and 9.  If you're going to spend all that money on either ivf or adoption, you might as well put it towards adoption.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	Been there, done that.  I did not consider adoption.

jPxkg7vKaa	Explain this situation to the doctor and express your concern. <br>  <br>  But also give the medicine time to work. Your baby is sick and it's not an easy experience. The only way he can express himself is to cry. It sounds as if you're doing what you can medicine wise. Keep on with that. <br>  <br>  Perhaps a warm bath with some Johnson's Bedtime Bath will help soothe him some and help him to sleep. Does he take a bottle still? If so, try mixing some baby cereal in with his formula. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|FXs0yBLEaa	he may need tubes in his ears. I remember my mom told me I had to get them in mine to drain the fluid.

He has tubes put in both ears at 3 years old. He has not had any more troubles since. Double ear affections causes the child to hearing to be muffled and prolonged dbl ear infections causes speech delays because of the muffled hearing.Watch what type of antiotics they give because there are some that causes childrens pernament teeth to be discolored.(tryclicine,i think) You hang in there,if he gets a fever before your ear doctors appt. take him to hospital and demand a specialist!!! You can look up one ,check to see what hospital he operates at, from his office and go to THAT emergency room and ask for him.

Xrwvu5Uraa	1.) I'm only in my second trimester still soon to be into my third, but I think so far that I like the second the best because it's when I could eat the most and not feel sick in the stomach. Other than some back pain and constipation and sleeping issues, the second trimester has been great! Also, I figured the third would be when I started to get really big and all my second trimester problems would just be worse!<br>  <br>  2.) It's a scary process, but it's awesome to see your body change and know that you have another life creating inside of you. For me, the best part is seeing how much bigger I am actually getting, it's quite amazing. The feelings inside when you can feel the baby move are also the best, uncomfortabe at first for me, but, you get used to it so fast!<br>  <br>  3.) I'm nervous. I think all expecting mothers are nervous, especially if it's their first child, which this is my first. I am extremely anticipating the arrival of my little girl though, sometimes I wish she was just here already!!! <br>  <br>  4.) Well I am 21 now, and was 20 when I found out I was pregnant, so my family was kind of shocked, as was I. But, everybody is so excited.<br>  <br>  5.) N/A<br>  <br>  6.) Yes I have changed my diet, eating more veggies, fruits, and protein. I also have gained 25 pounds so far which is kind of a lot (at 25 weeks) so my doctor told me to cut out some carbs and fruit juices. My cravings aren't for anything too weird, but mostly candy and snack foods.<br>  <br>  7.) This is my first pregnancy.<br>  <br>  8.) Me and my fiance agreed on the name Madison for our little girl. We had a baby book and went through each of the names that we really liked, it didn't take us long before we really liked/agreed Madison.<br>  <br>  9.) I think she will be amazing!<br>  <br>  10.) I think I will be everything my parents have been to me plus some! <br>  <br>  11.) I'm not really sure, people say wait until you see the change in yourself after the baby is here, so, I think it's something that expecting mothers just wait and see how it feels/happens.<br>  <br>  12.) Well I'm not one yet, but I am a preschool teacher and love kids, and always have. I think it's probably the most rewarding feelings in the world.<br>  <br>  13.) I am 25 weeks pregnant (6 months)<br>  <br>  14.) A little, but I know if I do what I need to do and what the healthcare professionals/doctors tell me everything will be fine.<br>  <br>  15.) I am pro-choice. I believe that a woman has the right to decide what to do with her body, not the government or anybody else.<br>  <br>  16.) No.<br>  <br>  17.) My fiance is already a father from a previous relationship. He is very excited for our little girl arrive as well! I know he is a good father and can not wait to see him interact with our baby.<br>  <br>  18.) I didn't find out I was pregnant until I was about 11-12 weeks, which is pretty late than normal! I was completely shocked like I said before, but I am doing everything I am supposed to. I just want June to be here!|`|HOdblqIkaa	1.

How do you feel, in general about having a baby?<br>  -for me it went something like this: terrified, over joyed, confused, nervous, now im just kind of waiting it out. <br>  <br>  <br>  4. How do other members of your family feel about having a baby?<br>  -my family has no idea yet (we dont talk) my boyfriends family is ecstatic! they cant wait to find out if its a boy or girl and they all want to make sure they take off work to be there for us <br>  <br>  <br>  5. If you have other children, how do they feel about the arrival of the new baby?<br>  -i dont have any my boyfriend has 2 from a previous relationship but they are too little to understand what is happening. my baby right now is my dog and he loves children but i dont know how hes feeling haha<br>  <br>  <br>  6. How have you changed your diet?

If you name your baby, how did you select his or her name?<br>  -weve picked out 2 names, one boy one girl. the middle names (Jean or James) were picked because they are family names (Mine, my moms, my grandmas, my ggrandmas middle names were all jean. my boyfriend/dad/grandpa all had james)<br>  the 1st names were picked because we liked them<br>  <br>  <br>  9. What do you think your baby will be like?<br>  -well weve already heard from ultrasound techs that he or she isnt shy which is making it really hard to keep the sex a secret. and judging from the amount he/she moves im gonna say theyll pretty much just come rolling out when the time comes. <br>  <br>  <br>  10. What will you be like as a parent?<br>  -nervous and over protective for the 1st couple years. <br>  <br>  11. How will you change in some significant ways after the arrival of this baby?<br>  -ill have to be way more responsible with my money<br>  <br>  12. What else would you like to tell me about your experience or thoughts about being a parent?<br>  -my biggest fear right now is dropping him/her especially after a bath. <br>  <br>  13. For how long had you been pregnant?<br>  <br>  14. Are you scare about any abnormally that might come later on your pregnancy?<br>  -i have quite a few people in my family who have downs syndrom and my boyfriends mom and mine both had difficult deliveries so those are my biggest worries<br>  <br>  15. Do you believe in abortion? Why or why not?<br>  -yes. i believe if a woman doesnt want a child but cant bear the thought of going thru with the pregnancy only to give the baby away she should have to. there is the rape argument. if the baby or mother is at any danger during the pregnancy.  its a touchy subject i try to avoid when i can because no one agrees with anyone.<br>  <br>  16. If your baby comes with an abnormally will you abort? Why or why not?<br>  -i wouldnt. i am too far along right now to even consider it and ive grown quite attached. i know how hard it is to work with disabled children and i dont know if can just give up after ive worked so hard with others. it doesnt seem fair to me.<br>  <br>  17. What does your partner feels or think about being a father?<br>  -this will be his 3rd and he cant wait because the first 2 he doesnt get to see-their mother has full custody and moved out of state. he cant wait to be a real daddy instead of just the birth father which is what his ex calls him to their children. <br>  <br>  18. Please explain me more about your pregnancy<br>  -the 1st few months were difficult. i am a full time student and right now have no job(boyfriend owns a company and i have money from family accounts) i got bored alot and ate way too much. i didnt know if i wanted to be a mom so i considered abortion but by the time i got to the clinic and had the ultra sound i just couldnt do it. hearing the nurse say "its not a shy little one" just hit home for me. sleeping sucks to be blunt. i pee so much that i honestly think i should move into the bathroom when im at home. i have constant cravings and always want to go out to eat which isnt healthy for me or my wallet. i babysit my boyfriends neice(1 month) and my friends son(2month) and everytime they cry i just worry im gonna do something wrong and hurt them. i cant complain about it too much, only the normal aches and pains and the fact that i dont have as many clothes to fit my growing belly. only 13 weeks to go!|`|9FztHceJaa	1.1st trimester<br>  2.nervous,kinda scared<br>  3.excited,wanna shop<br>  4.happy,first time to make it this far<br>  5.first baby<br>  6.yes no caffeine, not many spicy foods,chinese,pickles,resses <br>     (hate chocolate)<br>  7.its been easier <br>  8.its his fathers name<br>  9.the best he can be i want to keep his options open and give support<br>  10.i hope to be good only time will tell<br>  11.hope to become more mature get a career<br>  12.first baby hope to have a good labor <br>  13.9 mths<br>  14.not now at first yes<br>  15.no thou shalt not kill<br>  16.no same as above i will pray for strength and guidence<br>  17.hes happy this was planned<br>  18.its made me happy to create life|`|W1p6LetFaa	Wow, this is going to be a mouthful.  I don’t know if my answer will fit!  For background info, I am 24 years old, married for 2 years, and expecting my first, a little girl, due February 23.<br>  <br>  1. What trimester of pregnancy do you think is or will be the easiest for you?  <br>  <br>  My second trimester was certainly the easiest.  The morning sickness eased up, I started to look distinctly pregnant (instead of just pudgy), but still felt great and had plenty of energy.  I loved my second trimester!<br>  <br>  2. How do you feel about how your body is changing during pregnancy?<br>  <br>  It is very hard.  You have to accept the fact that you have no control over your body anymore and this was hard for me.  It was also difficult to watch myself get bigger and bigger in a world that tells me that I should be small.  I had to get past all of my selfish desires for my body-image and accept the fact that my body is doing something beautiful for my child.<br>  <br>  3. How do you feel, in general about having a baby?<br>  <br>  To be honest, it varies from day to day.  In general, I am so excited that I can’t sleep at night.  But I’m also terrified.  Am I really ready for motherhood?  How can I be the best mother to my child?  It’s such a scary yet exciting time!<br>  <br>  4. How do other members of your family feel about having a baby?<br>  <br>  My parents are excited, but which my husband and I hate waited until we were a little older.  My in-laws, however, are ecstatic. My sisters are the most excited of all.<br>  <br>  5. If you have other children, how do they feel about the arrival of the new baby?<br>  <br>  Not applicable.<br>  <br>  6. How have you changed your diet? What about “cravings”?<br>  <br>  I haven’t as much as I should have.  I take my prenatal vitamins and I am more conscious about staying hydrating and eating more fruits/veggies, but other than that I eat the same as I used to.  I haven’t had too many cravings, but I usually give in to them when I have them, just in moderation.<br>  <br>  7. If this is not your first baby, how has this pregnancy been easier or more difficult than other pregnancies?<br>  <br>  Not applicable.<br>  <br>  8. If you name your baby, how did you select his or her name?<br>  <br>  I wanted a name that is not common, but it not unusual, kind of like my own name, Karen.  I don’t know very many people named Karen but it’s still a very “normal” name, and I want this for my daughter as well.<br>  <br>  9. What do you think your baby will be like?<br>  <br>  I think she will be stubborn, like me.  She already does not like her space invaded and kicks me very hard when she is squished or pushed around, haha.<br>  <br>  10. What will you be like as a parent?<br>  <br>  Hopefully like my in-laws and not like my parents.  My in-laws are patient, listening, never reacting out of anger but always trying to get to the heart of the matter.<br>  <br>  11. How will you change in some significant ways after the arrival of this baby?<br>  <br>  I won’t have control over my life the way I used to, because it’s not about me anymore, it’s about my family.<br>  <br>  12. What else would you like to tell me about your experience or thoughts about being a parent?<br>  <br>  I have loved being pregnant and I cannot wait to be a parent.  It’s the scariest thing in the world to me right now, but I am already willing to die to save this baby and I have never even met her face-to-face.  It’s scary to love someone this much.<br>  <br>  13. For how long had you been pregnant? <br>  <br>  I am 39 weeks and 3 days pregnant.  My estimated due date is in 4 days (February 23).<br>  <br>  14. Are you scare about any abnormally that might come later on your pregnancy?<br>  <br>  I am terrified that something might go wrong during labor.  But then again, plenty of women give birth every day and nothing goes wrong, so there is no sense in losing sleep over it.  <br>  <br>  15. Do you believe in abortion? Why or why not?<br>  <br>  No, I do not.  I believe in the sanctity of life, and that life begins at conception. Therefore all abortion to me is the selfish murder of an innocent child.<br>  <br>  16. If your baby comes with an abnormally will you abort? Why or why not? <br>  <br>  Well, it’s too late for that now, but no, I never would if that happened in my next pregnancies.  There are too many blessings that come out of the hardship of handicapped children.  I’m not saying it would be easy, but I’m saying it would be worth it.<br>  <br>  17. What does your partner feels or think about being a father?<br>  <br>  He cannot wait to become a father and get to hold his daughter in his arms for the first time.  Every night before we go to bed, he talks to her and tries to convince her to come out now (since I’m full term) so he can meet her.<br>  <br>  18. Please explain me more about your pregnancy.<br>  <br>  My husband and I were not originally planning to get pregnant so soon, but were thrilled when we found out we were expecting. I have loved being pregnant and personally cannot wait to do it again.  But then again, I have had a very easy pregnancy compared to most people (not that it was easy, no pregnancy ever is).  I have never been more tired in my entire life, I threw|`|giRRCXU4aa	1. What trimester of pregnancy do you think is or will be the easiest for you?    My second trimester was the easiest. I was sick as a dog my first trimester and now that i'm in my third i'm huge and uncomfortable, and sleep is very hard to come by.<br>  <br>  2. How do you feel about how your body is changing during pregnancy?<br>  I feel great. It was a little awkward when I first started showing and I just looked pudgy but now that you can definitely tell i'm pregnant it's a lot better.<br>  <br>  3. How do you feel, in general about having a baby?     I'm very excited. I love getting things ready for him. It's amazing to have a life inside of you.<br>  <br>  4. How do other members of your family feel about having a baby?<br>  My family is very excited about the baby. He's spoiled already.<br>  <br>  5. If you have other children, how do they feel about the arrival of the new baby?      I have no other children.<br>  <br>  6. How have you changed your diet? What about “cravings”?  My diet is pretty much the same as it was before. I crave ice cream all of the time but I definitely don't let myself have it much.<br>  <br>  7. If this is not your first baby, how has this pregnancy been easier or more difficult than other pregnancies?    This is my first pregnancy.<br>  <br>  8. If you name your baby, how did you select his or her name?   I actually had a few names picked out and I've narrowed it down to one. I picked a name that would flow nicely with my last name and one that isn't too weird or too common.<br>  <br>  9. What do you think your baby will be like?   Well, we are all biased. My baby will be gorgeous and amazing. Funny. All of those things we imagine.<br>  <br>  10. What will you be like as a parent?   I think i'll be a great parent. I love kids.<br>  <br>  11. How will you change in some significant ways after the arrival of this baby?   I think I will definitely pay more attention to the things around me. I might be a bit more uptight, but what parent isn't some of the time?<br>  <br>  12. What else would you like to tell me about your experience or thoughts about being a parent?    Pregnancy is stressful, and it's long. I can't wait for him to be here and to be able to hold him. I can't wait to see him smile at me for the first time!<br>  <br>  13. For how long had you been pregnant?    I'm 34 weeks pregnant. So i'm in my 8th month, almost 9th month.<br>  <br>  14. Are you scare about any abnormally that might come later on your pregnancy?    I think we all worry about that at some point in pregnancy. I have faith that my son will be just fine.<br>  <br>  15. Do you believe in abortion? Why or why not?   I don't believe in abortion. Killing anything with a beating heart is murder.<br>  <br>  16. If your baby comes with an abnormally will you abort? Why or why not?    I haven't had to deal with this but I think that most women would choose not to, if the baby had a chance at survival.<br>  <br>  17. What does your partner feels or think about being a father?   He doesn't. But, that's a whole different story.<br>  <br>  18. Please explain me more about your pregnancy.    Thankfully it's been pretty easy. I worry about everything, and I think that's because I don't work so i'm at home to let my mind wander. I can't wait until my son gets here!|`|qaMrAspCaa	1. What trimester of pregnancy do you think is or will be the easiest for you?<br>  <br>  Second!<br>  <br>  <br>  2. How do you feel about how your body is changing during pregnancy?<br>  I feel fine, what's going to come will come and there is nothing I can do to stop it...stretch marks!<br>  <br>  <br>  3. How do you feel, in general about having a baby?<br>  Excited!!! Excited!!!<br>  <br>  4. How do other members of your family feel about having a baby?<br>  They are all so excited also, and can't wait to meet him<br>  <br>  5. If you have other children, how do they feel about the arrival of the new baby?<br>  no other children<br>  <br>  6. How have you changed your diet? What about “cravings”?<br>  I actually have a very strict diet because i have gestational diabetes. So I can't really give into my cravings....although I do crave fatty, greasy foods. So it's probably best that I am forced to have a good diet.<br>  <br>  7. If this is not your first baby, how has this pregnancy been easier or more difficult than other pregnancies?<br>  n/a<br>  <br>  8. If you name your baby, how did you select his or her name?<br>  I put together a list of boy names that I really liked, my husband went through the list and crossed off anything he didn't like, and we were left with Clark!<br>  <br>  9. What do you think your baby will be like?<br>  Calm, beautiful, amazing, wonderful, soft, funny...<br>  <br>  10. What will you be like as a parent?<br>  A very laid back parent.  I'm a go with the flow kind of person, take it one day at a time, no use in worrying about what you can't control.<br>  <br>  11. How will you change in some significant ways after the arrival of this baby?<br>  I don't think I will change, my husband and I are home bodies to begin with, now we wil enjoy being at home with baby.  But he might get us to go out and do more things...oh, and we will need to visit family more than we normally do.<br>  <br>  12. What else would you like to tell me about your experience or thoughts about being a parent?<br>  It's scary to think about being a parent before you are pregnant, but once you are faced with the reality of "I'm going to be a parent" you really will rise to the occasion.<br>  <br>  13. For how long had you been pregnant? <br>  35 weeks<br>  <br>  14. Are you scare about any abnormally that might come later on your pregnancy?<br>  nope. Like I said before, there is no reason to worry about things that I can't control. I plan to have an all natural birth with no medication or medical intervention. I will work my hardest to make that happen, but if things come up, i'll deal with it then.<br>  <br>  15. Do you believe in abortion? Why or why not?<br>  No, I know my baby was a baby as soon as he was concieved. He is my baby and some people think i'm extreme but I personally believe that abortion is a woman murdering her baby. If women are ready to have sex they should be ready for the responsiblity or at least be responsible enough to give it up for adoption.<br>  <br>  16. If your baby comes with an abnormally will you abort? Why or why not?  No way! I believe in god, and god will not give me anything that I cannot handle or learn from. Even if the Dr's said that he would have little to no chance for survival I would not abort because I know that there is no way a dr. can know for sure, and we would do our best to love and take care of our child for as long as we are blessed to have him <br>  <br>  17. What does your partner feels or think about being a father?<br>  He is over the moon, and can't wait to meet his baby boy.<br>  <br>  18. Please explain me more about your pregnancy.<br>  Not sure what else there is to say other then I've had a really smooth pregnancy even with my Gestational Diabetes, but maybe it's all becasue of my additude.

I think it will be difficult, but fun and fulfilling.<br>  <br>  13. 29 weeks and 2 days.<br>  <br>  14. Not really. Everything looks fine with the baby and there have been no complications. I'm healthy so everything should be fine.<br>  <br>  15. I don't personally believe in it, but I think there are some instances in which it is acceptable. For example, if a woman is raped and winds <br>  up pregnant, i could understand if she was not emotionally capable of carrying that baby until it is born and she can give it up for adoption. It would just be a constant reminder of what had happened to her.<br>  <br>  16. No. I will love my baby no matter what.<br>  <br>  17. He's excited but nervous.<br>  <br>  18. My pregnancy has been a bit difficult. Only because of the severe morning sickness and nausea I've had the entire time. Throwing up at least 3 times a day, every day is not fun.

At first I hated it...until i could see my stomach moving when he would kick. It seriously brought tears to my eyes the first time I saw it!<br>  <br>  <br>  3. How do you feel, in general about having a baby?<br>  Nervous-he was a little unexpected, but glad to be given this gift when so many people throw it away...or can't have children<br>  <br>  4. How do other members of your family feel about having a baby?<br>  I may have did things a little backwards, but they're excited to meet little Landon!<br>  <br>  5. If you have other children, how do they feel about the arrival of the new baby? no other children, but my dogs know something is going on!<br>  <br>  <br>  6. How have you changed your diet? What about “cravings”?<br>  I cut out starbucks and sushi completely...I microwave sandwich meat,  and I cut back on hot dogs. <br>  <br>  I have had cravings for pineapple, chocolate, and orange juice. I hate ALL of those! I was eating hot dogs out of the package with a slice of american cheese around them until my doctor mentioned hot dogs had to be cooked...it almost killed me!<br>  <br>  7. If this is not your first baby, how has this pregnancy been easier or more difficult than other pregnancies?<br>  <br>  <br>  8. If you name your baby, how did you select his or her name?<br>  My fiance and I hardly agreed on ANY boy names, so when we both loved Landon James, I knew it was a sign!<br>  <br>  9. What do you think your baby will be like?<br>  Good question...qiuet would be nice =) Happy! I feel so bad for the babies that never seem to stop crying....<br>  <br>  10. What will you be like as a parent?<br>  I would love to be as amazing as my mother was. Loving and caring, but not afraid to put my foot down. I'm not going to say I was never swatted for misbehaving!<br>  11. How will you change in some significant ways after the arrival of this baby?<br>  Less time for myself, obviously I won't get to go out as much, it should be interesting to see it I still make it to coffee dates with the girls! I know my nails won't be getting done every month!<br>  <br>  12. What else would you like to tell me about your experience or thoughts about being a parent?<br>  I didn't think I wanted children until I found out I was going to be a mom. The whole world changed for me after that.<br>  <br>  13. For how long had you been pregnant? <br>  Due the 23rd<br>  <br>  14. Are you scare about any abnormally that might come later on your pregnancy?<br>  Just labor!<br>  <br>  15. Do you believe in abortion? Why or why not?<br>  Goodness no! Why take an innocent life because you can't keep your legs closed? If you're not ready to be a parent, there are plenty of families out there that would love to be a parent. I was supposed to be an abortion, but my mom changed her mind and placed me up for adoption. I can't be grateful enough.<br>  <br>  16. If your baby comes with an abnormally will you abort? Why or why not?<br>  I won't. God gave me that baby knowing I could handle it. It's not up to me to murder a child.  <br>  <br>  17. What does your partner feels or think about being a father?<br>  Scared at first, but now excited...still a little nervous!<br>  <br>  18. Please explain me more about your pregnancy|`|tUy2bK78aa	can all you guys answer this question please<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090218121733AAArqkQ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|hKkcLmvEaa	1. Second trimester was easiest, was sick entire first trimester and have been in premature labor for most of third trimester.<br>  2. I feel pretty good about the way my body has changed. I think it is so worth it to have a child. <br>  3. I love children. There is nothing more true than the love of a child.<br>  4. Everyone in my family is very excited.<br>  5. I have a 7 year old son who can't wait to meet his baby sister. He always says he can't wait to hold her.<br>  6. I haven't really changed my diet much. I do crave tomatoes and tomatoe juice.<br>  7. This pregnancy has been a lot more difficult than my first. I didn't get sick once with my first and never had the first pain till my first contraction. With this one I had morning <br>  sickness for the first 4 months and have been having contractions for the last 5 weeks. <br>  8. My husband and I came up with a name <br>  together with some help from a baby name <br>  book. But we won't truly decide till she is born.<br>  9. I have no clue. But I hope she looks like me. My son is a spitting image of his daddy. I want a kid that looks like me. :)<br>  10. I don't think a second child will change me as a parent.<br>  11. I'm sure that by having 2 kids I will have to get a lot better at multi tasking, which I am horrible at.<br>  12. Being a parent is the hardest but most rewarding job a person can ever have.<br>  13. I am currently 36 weeks pregnant with my second child.<br>  14. We have had several scares with this pregnancy. An abnormality showed up in an ultrasound that is sometimes a sign of downs syndrome. We were scared but it turned out to be nothing.<br>  15. No I do not. I believe that abortion is murder!<br>  16. Absolutely not! Same as answer #15.<br>  17. He loves being a dad. Although there is a lot of stress associated with being a parent. Such as the financial aspects.<br>  18. Even though I have been in a lot of pain, I wouldn't trade it for anything. I can't wait to see my baby girl. 4 weeks to go!
8396838b128e2966c0c31ebdd32d0f49aa	Yes it gets better.  I used his method with my daughter and it works wonders.  Once they get used to the idea of a schedule and self-soothing they are fine.  Babies are surprisingly resilient and able to adjust to new circumstances rather quickly.  Don't let your baby's crying discourage you from sticking with this method.|`|UY3j47ozaa	I cant let my baby cry so these methods dont work for me....
PJLpvZQRaa	I told her about 8 weeks when morning sickness started settling in so they would understand when i wasn't well. I did it on a friday so i didn't have to see them all weekend and everyone was very supportive and happy for me!|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	I told him on a Friday, the day after I found out I was 15 weeks and 1 day.<br>  I told him straight away, this, I figured, would sort out any confusion later as to why I'm getting much bigger and moving slower lol.<br>  He was great, winked at me, congratulated me and said we'll see how things go and make sure there is nothing to harm mother or baby done.<br>  We have the same relationship as you do.<br>  <br>  Tips: Look them in the eye when your telling them.<br>  Seem happy about your pregnancy, towards telling him (tell them proudly).<br>  Don't fiddle with anything, just talk confidently.<br>  Tell him your plan for your pregnancy, like when its due, when youll have to take time off etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|h9AaGIYEaa	i know my boss on a personal level so when I returned to work I told her. I think its a good idea to let your employer know as soon as possible that way if you miscarry or have complications and you need to miss work they will understand,|`|seU9VwIJaa	I have a much different relationship with my boss. We often go for coffee together or go shopping, so she was one of the first people I told-over a text! She came over with a bottle of wine...and then realized she brought the wrong gift! =)<br>  I'd tell your boss sometime in the afternoon. I'm sure they'll be fine with it! It's not like you're stealing from the company!|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I told him at 15 weeks pregnant. :) I'd talk with him in person and be professional and friendly|`|hmQDjHs6aa	6 weeks 6 days|`|UKmZcA30aa	I had to find a job because i was pregnant. I went into the job open about being pregnant until i met the boss. she was scary. lol she made a big deal that i was going to be working and going to school. She didnt think i could do it, so i was not about to tell her that i was pregnant on top of that. I told my manager right away. She ended up telling my boss just before thanksgiving and i was due in the beginning of Jan. (i dont work directly with my boss so she couldnt see my growing belly) My manager said she took it good. She was shocked. I know my boss called me right after she found out but i wasnt able to answer the phone. In fact we still have not even talked about my baby and i had him 7 weeks ago lol|`|diEZW57caa	I told them as soon as I had it confirmed by a doctor and was told by the doctor to get my shift changed.<br>  I was working overnights and was told that working that schedule was making me too sick and I might lose the baby if I continued and that I needed to change shifts.  They were very angry (only because it's hard to find a decent overnight employee), but there is nothing they could really do about it.|`|ig0klGBXaa	the day i found out, they were cool with it because they didnt do it and they couldnt change it, and you should just flat out tell them.
mXEwfo4taa	healthquotes.awardspace.info - try this one. My wife had no problem with her insurance coverage while being pregnant.
L8eNBQelaa	you wouldn't have morning sickness so soon. i was 7wks pregnant when it started.|`|yjhpBM11aa	Sounds like your just getting sick. Morning sickness doesn't start until a little later in pregnancy. I got morning sickness really bad my first 3 months of pregnancy but it didn't start until like 5 weeks after I missed my period.|`|AA11089667	thats way too soon. around a month or 2 u will start having pregnancy simptoms , but thats if u are.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	You can have any symptoms after implantation has occurred, usually that will happen 5-12 days from conception....<br>  I would say it was a bit soon but I have felt a little sick a week or so after and been pregnant, we had a chemical pregnancy, not to say you will but still|`|R21aV2mLaa	i did not have morning sickness until my 5th week!! i dont think you would already have morning sickness, the bug is going around!|`|PYafv6gSaa	quiet early the sickness starts but it acn stop at 12 weeks or if your unlucky ages|`|i1CH2qD5aa	for my son i only had about a month of morning sickness and three days of actual vomiting but not until about the 3rd or 4 month. My daughter was a different story one morning i woke up had a shower and felt sick after,  I told my husband that I thought I was pregnant and I was, that was at 3 weeks and for 7 months I threw up everything, My doctor was mad because instead of gaining weight I lost 30 lbs. I forced myself to eat knowing that i was just going to throw it all back, but luckily she was fine.|`|8396838b128e2966c0c31ebdd32d0f49aa	You're not going to feel sick from pregnancy a week after sex.  You will normally start to feel it around the time of your next period the following month.
Z7V7AbBQaa	I have two children that had tubes the youngest was 18 month when we went to see the ENT and she decided  that my idea for to weight a few months to see if the fluid would clear on it's own. after a few appointments with the fluid not clearing she decided tubes would be the best bet.  <br>      My daughter was booked for surgery 5 days befor her second birthday. I walked my daughter to the or I went to the waiting room about 5-6 minutes later I was asked to go to the recovery room my daughter was awake and crying because she wanted out of the crib. I rocked her in the rocking chair they had for us and after 15 minutes she was then taken to the children's floor where she was given a Popsicle and after 2 hours later with no vomiting we were sent home. <br>  <br>  They do put them to sleep but the anesthesia is very light and they are only out a few minutes (as a mom it seems like forever) but it's not.<br>  <br>  My two were told not to get the ears wet till the tubes fall out about 6-12 months. If water dose get in the ear try to keep that ear down to allow it to drain It's possible it cause an ear infection but it's not a great risk unless the water is from a pond or lake.<br>   <br>  My daughter was a bit sleepy the day she had her tubes but was happy . Our ENT said the having tubes is the only operation where kids come out feeling better that befor since all the pressuer on the ear drum from the fluid is released. My daughter has never had an ear infection since having the tubes and she is now 5 years old.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	discuss your concerns with the ENT.
hbOFDysJaa	A positive can turn up negative, but negatives don't come up positive.  I spotted in early pergnancy too.  Good luck!!!|`|tJzlPhm5aa	I would say yes.  it's very doubtful to get a false positive.|`|GrUuRwk5aa	Yes. I spotted with my daughter and had a negative test. The test in the morning is accurate. They usually tell you to take the test then because the pregnancy hormone is strongest then.|`|yp9rEMSraa	your prego girl...you need to go to the doctor and see how far along you are....congrates that you are...the reason why you are testing positive and negative is because you are not to far along..the reason you are to test the first morning urine is because it is the strongest...when you are testing in the afternoon/night the urine is not carrying enough of the hcg...i would plan on being prego and set up an appointment....best of luck to you|`|AA10308264	Spotting is there in some pregnancies in the early periods.. however, it may also be somekind of infection.. Go and check out with your doctor, who would advise you better !|`|PlHjhwtAaa	Yes|`|ppVT5QC7aa	It is really too early to tell. Your mind could be playing tricks on you.If you are really wanting a baby badly your mind could convince your body that you are when your not. It could go either way. But good luck. I hope things turn out the way you want them to.|`|8d66833840588f215acfd75181564f0baa	I think you are pregnant, is it possible that the positive test were tests that detect the hcg earlier than the others? Wish you the best!|`|9b8278b3a9a556138153fbad211d8c67aa	yes
BSU9pNUWaa	Well there are more reasons than can be listed for the symptoms you have mentioned, although many do point toward pregnancy. Home pregnancy tests although high are not 100 percent accurate. There is also no garentee your doing it right, or reading it right. I would advise seeing a doctor to set up a full-proof test. If it's not a pregnancy he/she will also be able to point to some solutions for the symptoms you have exclaimed here.|`|Ngl0gBv5aa	well the question is if u had sex latley?|`|dYN3bdnKaa	It sounds like you are. I'd take a test if I were you.<br>  If it says negative, keep taking the test once a week until either it<br>  says positive, or until you get your period.<br>  <br>  If you miss your next period too, then go to the doctor!<br>  Hope every things ok though, good luck!|`|zv4qNmAlaa	erm...what he said.|`|c815f0954f0cc607a22f3e49bfd31b48aa	Sometimes there's a false positive but I would wait and take another test in a week or 2. If you have the time, you could go ahead and go to the doctor. Sometimes women have pregnancy symptoms because they're trying to get pregnant and it's sort of psychological.|`|LkOcJRRWaa	yeah if you had sex it is a possibility you could be pregnant.|`|SR04mlQQaa	points|`|aMXC0tDWaa	Sometimes it takes a while for a pregnancy test to come up positive... go to your doctor and tell him/her your symptoms.  They can test you more accurately than a drugstore test.  (But I have lots of little cousins and a baby brother, so I've seen lots of pregnancies, and it sounds to me like you are.)<br>  <br>  :)|`|AA10988719	well, the signs are there, unsure about the metallic taste though.  did you take the First Response test, that is probably the better one to take since you are only a little bit late.  otherwise, check out www.webmd and put in metallic taste as a symptom and see what comes up.|`|kml4wGw4aa	Yes Sweetie...ur pregnant...it takes exactly 24 days b4 a test will show up positive simply because you haven't developed the HCG hormone which is what detects the "positive"in pregnancy tests. But besides that...you have all the symptoms....not trying to scare you but the same thing happened to me and after a month...it was positive.|`|IGYa2yF6aa	It's possible, but very unlikely. Pregnancy tests are 99% accurate by the time you're 1 week late. But something else could be going on with your body that needs to be checked out. You should go see your doctor asap.|`|9lBe1JGAaa	Go see your doctor!!<br>  <br>  Yahoo answers people are no where near smart enough to give you an educated answer. You really need to see a doc to know for sure.|`|Vy8p3Qlcaa	Condoms.|`|MiTklhkWaa	Try testing again!Two weeks late that could be a yes.|`|2EIvAsZ6aa	did you have sex?|`|rTV5W9L2aa	Your perception of a metallic taste can be due to an assortment of metal mouth factors. However, the most common causes of the unflavorful taste of metal are medications used for treatment of:<br>  <br>  antibiotics <br>  kidney stones <br>  antidepressants <br>  prenatal vitamins <br>  anesthetic ~ lidocaine <br>  heart failure ~ captopril <br>  giardiasis ~ metronidazole <br>  CT scan ~ contrast medium <br>  trichomoniasis ~ tinidazole <br>  high blood pressure ~ captopril <br>  chronic alcoholism ~ disulfiram <br>  rheumatoid arthritis ~ auranofin <br>  low calcium treatment ~ calcitriol <br>  weight loss, diabetes ~ metformin <br>  Unhealthy oral hygiene may be the cause for a metal taste symptoms in your mouth, including:<br>  <br>  gingivitis <br>  periodontitis <br>  tooth infections <br>  Some other causes and diseases that may be causing your taste to be metallic are:<br>  <br>  cancer <br>  peptic ulcer <br>  food allergy <br>  lichen planus <br>  marine toxins <br>  too much iron <br>  hypercalcemia <br>  lead poisoning <br>  kidney disease <br>  copper overdose <br>  selenium toxicity <br>  mercury poisoning <br>  iodine intoxication <br>  acute kidney failure <br>  burning mouth syndrome <br>  Calcium carbonate supplements can cause you to believe that you are eating metal as well.|`|AA10308264	The tests may not always be true.. You must see a doc immediately for further advise. Moreover, so early in pregnancy you may not have tender breasts. Yes, bad tase & other problems may be symptoms. But your doctor will be able to help you in the case... Gud Luck..!!|`|18d85be6c3c9c020fcc70cb27704105caa	Best way to know for sure of course is to go see your Doctor or maybe go to planned parenthood  they can  help you . However the home pregnancy tests are fairly acute  but   they do not always detect pregnancy's very early on . again i suggest you go find out ASAP . Good luck .|`|92ZnxGzaaa	go to the doctors and have them test you, to be honest it seems like it, but it is possible that ur just nervouse, which is making your period late|`|PlHjhwtAaa	go to the doctor and get a blood test, you also didn't tell us when you had sex or if it was unprotected or if you are on the pill. we need more info or you need to go to the doctor|`|rv8fbSmeaa	The only way you are really going to know is if you go see a doctor. If you are pregnant it is important to keep that baby healthy. Go see a doctor right away.|`|JjUBlGWmaa	maybe, but girls miss periods all the time, especially if your a teen. But ya, if you really want to know for sure, call your doctor and have a blood test done|`|tM2XvQV0aa	just went through the same, but since you work yourself up, you actually are mentally delaying it. :) it just means ur period is coming.|`|vWZHeoJ1aa	Those tests aren't always accurate|`|ppVT5QC7aa	It is really too soon to tell.|`|8d66833840588f215acfd75181564f0baa	Go to the dr, let them do a blood test.|`|5p2AiZLWaa	yeah maybe..if you had sex.|`|R36nThwLaa	go to the docs.|`|iPpmhjR1aa	lol, "Points" .....me too|`|9b8278b3a9a556138153fbad211d8c67aa	yes|`|VRk2CKHZaa	you should see a doctor if u hadn't already i wouln't THINK so unless u had SEX|`|i2NFartOaa	ha your screwed
XOtOMncwaa	Children adapt pretty quickly. I haven't moved, but we do travel from time to time, which means extended stays in hotels... and my son who is 13 months never minds. He just walks around, checks it out, and learns his boundaries... he does like to test me when we get to a new place to see what he's allowed to do, and what he can get away with, but other than that we never have a problem out of it. I know it's a little different then moving into a new house, but you will be surprised at how quickly he adjusts... just make sure you keep all of his things familiar... same crib bedding, same toys, he naps in the same place, he eats in the same place... of course don't change his schedule or anything, do things like you always do in your home now and he should do just fine.|`|Bz8tcAOyaa	My little sister did terribly. She was extremely clingy and held on to her lovie more than ever. She asoultely hated the moving boxes and she couldn't fin any of her toys! She was 20 months at the time, so I guess everything just seemed a bit unsettled to her.<br>  <br>  Anyways, your son is still very little, so he probably won't be bothered much by the change.|`|EWETAH0daa	well over the summer my husband left the military and we stayed with my sister before moving down to NM. Both my boys did great. only a little More cautious of boundaries until they found them. my boys were 2yrs and 4-6 months|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	Our son was only 7 months when we moved from a one bedroom apartment to a large 2-story house. The only change I noticed in him was that he went to bed a few hours later than usual and needed more comfort when going to bed and for naps.
iMULlxdgaa	What the hell are Fenugreek pills...that sounds almost scary.  Are you supposed to be taking them during pregnancy?|`|g9ZFjl6paa	from what i found u shouldnt take those unless ok by a doctor.     this is one thing i found    fenugreek is NOT recommended during pregnancy. Studies are inconculusive in humans but in animals it has caused uterine stimulation and has the same effect as oxytocin, which is the hormone that causes the uterus to contract during labour.
CuCrGDuRaa	No, I have a different Rh factor than my babies and my doctor said the only thing that can cause is a possibility of miscarriage (but I had my shot of Rhogam so I'm fine).  It sounds like she may have PUPPP, but she should mention this to her doctor at her next appointment.  In the meantime, she should try taking warm oatmeal baths and moisturizing with unscented lotion.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	As mentioned, its probably PUPPP... although I hope she was screened to have her shot at 28wks for the RH factor... if the baby is different blood type her body may think the baby is foreign and attack it... a couple things she needs checked out...|`|IVNM1O5naa	No. It is actually a pregnancy induced situation, usually due to hormones. It has nothing to do with the RH factor. Take her to the doctor if it gets to be real bad.
DI25ZrcVaa	I understand what you mean by not letting her go through that pain becuase I have a daugher as well.    But at the same time, you did not keep your word.      And if she is prepared for pain and you are ok with your getting her ears pierce than I say go for it.  Also everyone is different, she may not feel the same pain you will feel.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	I think your daughter is being to stubborn and not listening to you. Where did you get them pierced? I've heard you can get your ears pierced at the doctor's office. You could also research online which place people think is the best and most pain-free to get your ears pierced.     You just didn't want her to go through that much pain! She shouldn't be so mad at you like she is. Tell her you will find a better place to get her ears pierced. I got my ears pierced like 8 weeks ago, and it didn't hurt like crazy, but it did hurt. And I was 14. I got them done at Claire's, BTW. The lady who went before me thought it hurted pretty bad, too.    It could also depend on the person whether it hurts or not. The fact that you already got your ears pierced but they had closed up might have had something to do with it, but I dunno.    Just look online for a place that people have taken their kids to and said was good and pain-free.    I would also have a talk with your daughter, though, and tell her how she is acting immature about it. You should both apologize to eachother. You apologize to her for promising to get her ears pierced but then letting her down, and she apologize to you for not listening. What if you had gotten her ears pierced? Imagine how much it could have hurt her.|`|JdqDauEDaa	Yes. You told her one thing then went back on your word. You were trying to protect her but she didn't want protecting.     My parents were firm and unyielding. No pierced ears. Ever. I still have no pierced ears. My point is not about the piercing, but about being firm. If you say yes, mean yes. If you say no, follow through.|`|8bf22a7b300866a77ba08f820aaefdcaaa	Let her do it. Have your her dad bring her if that's what needs to be done.    Getting your ears pierced feels like nothing.    You told her something, so keep your word. Be a role model. Do you want her becoming a liar?|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Yea i'd probably be mad at you to lol. If she really wants them done let her. If it hurts she will deal with it. That's part of growing up. I've had my ears re-pierced after they had closed and I thought it was worse than getting them done the first time.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Erm, yes I think it is justified that she is mad at you.  You said she could get it done. Got it done yourself, and then didn't let her.|`|GUswFG2Raa	Yea. You lied to her.|`|yPNvecc7aa	Well I think what you did is wrong and I agree with your daughter. You can't agree to give her something and then bring her that close to getting it, and then take it away.    I hope you at least took out your new earings and aren't still wearing them. You should let her dad take her. She says she can deal with the pain, so let her. Let it be a lesson to her if she can't take it.|`|jN3pRKkEaa	Yes, she should be mad at you.|`|AA12321868	Yeah, I agree with the other replies here. What you did was pretty ridiculous. You won't be calling the shots for your daughter all your life. You should have let her take her turn and make her own decision as to whether she can handle the pain or not. And seriously, it doesn't even hurt that much after 5 minutes. Besides, young people tend to have a higher tolerance for pain than older people.     It really hurts young people when those they look up to bring them so close to something they really want and then snatch it back at the last minute. Imagine if you were in her place. How betrayed would you feel?|`|n3Mk3cvCaa	often times kids can handle pain more than adults. I think you should apologize and take her tomorrow just warn her it will hurt.|`|JjBtgSixaa	Let him take her.  You promised her and you were truthful with her, let her get it done.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	Yes she is justified in being mad at you.|`|AA11755924	mom, how could you do that?  You just told her you were going to do one thing, and completely took it back at the last minute.  Let her get her ears pierced!  That is really selfish of you!  I'd be mad at you too if you were my mom!|`|2Y0WXtyNaa	Honestly I would be mad. I do understand that you don't want her to inflict any unnecessary pain on herself, and you sound like a really good mom for that, but as long as you warned her, she knows it will hurt and she is prepared, I say let her go for it.|`|64CjdY3Vaa	You should have let her get them done. She knew it would hurt, and that was okay with her. You needed to keep your word! That's just not fair to her.|`|doizXjdDaa	Getting ones ears pierced does not hurt that much. It's no worse than getting a shot at the doctor's and you let her do that - don't you?  I think you're being way too overprotective here.    How old is your daughter? If she was about 5 I would understand. Regardless, if you were having doubts you shouldn't have told her she could do it i the first place.
mLWYHm2vaa	Since he does to you and your husband I would say it's definitely just a comfort thing. If he was just doing it to himself and had only been doing it for a short time I would say ear infections. But it looks like you probably have a kid with a thing for ears :) My son liked to put his hand in my arm pit. It started at about nine months when he would nurse, and eventually he would do it anytime he was near me, or anyone else. It's just a comfort thing.|`|Ez4d9g3vaa	One of my sons played with our ears when we held him, it was soothing and helped him to fall asleep.  When we would put him to bed awake, he played with his own ears.  For him, it was comforting.    If your son has only been doing it for a few days, I would consider ear infection but if it's been a long time, it is probably just a comfort like some kids use a pacifier or a blanket or a teddy bear.|`|iMULlxdgaa	he most likely has an ear infection.  Take him to the doctor!|`|1WRB7RPNaa	ear infection?|`|m2aznd8xaa	its just something that comforts him. as long as he aint in pain or an ear infection and its just out of habit.my daughter likes to pull on her hair when she has her sippy cup and to go to bed and shell pull on mine too. not forcefully but its like having a blankie or a binky. that is there comfort. it very normal.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	I'm sure you've thought of this already, but have you had his ears checked lately?  With my kids, pulling their ears always meant pain in the ear.    TX Mom|`|rE15gSFraa	Sounds like it could be an ear infection. Have him checked by his pediatrician just in case.  Otherwise it could be just a habit, not to worry. Good luck!|`|AA11281588	rash? tell yo doctor|`|ztug2gLjaa	might be ear infections.  Have you talked to his docotr about getting the tubes in the ears...that will eliminate the ear infections to nothing!|`|27d56c06ceccc45d5e89e737fce397ddaa	he probably has an ear ache, i'd take him in and have it checked out  though it could just be a little extra fluid in there bugging him|`|lUSknAQtaa	lol really funny. I say that because my little cousims werent able to go to sleep unless they rubbed there moms ear lobes and theres and that was a comforting way to go to sleep. Its funny because all of her kids did this before sleeping..they eventually grew out of this at the age of 5. I would say dont worry abou it too much. Now if this has just started to happen recently then I wuold say take him to the doctor to get a check up he may possibly have an ear infection, or fluid build up.|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	AT first I though ear infection but if he pulls on yours and hubbys to he may just be playing. I would have him checked to be sure but it may just be a game to him|`|e241bb5ca60328ab4d08ef938b8dfe20aa	Does he seem irritable? If not, it's probably not an ear infection.  It's probably just soothing for him to pull on his ear.
GcZRN4kkaa	20 Ga-squillion dollars. They make you pay for offsprings nowadays, what with the credit crunch and all.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Honestly, if you have to ask, then you are not financially ready for parenthood.  It costs what it costs.  If you want a baby you don't think about it too much.|`|3MelQFxOaa	Obv. the age of the baby makes a difference, but for the first couple of months, ill do the figures for you, and once they get older, remember the cost of food and diapers are more expensive. (maybe about 50 dollars most a month)    1) Diapers-80 diapers a week, about 3 packs of diapers, so about $60  2) Formula (if breastfed nothing) about  $100 a month, depending on the brand also. This is brand name formula, if you go with target or walmart brand, say about $50 a month  3)Clothes, burp cloth, bibs, etc. $50  4) Destin, soap, laundry liquids-$40  5) Diaper genie refills- $10  6) Misc. $100 (toys etc.)  7) Doctor (figuring copays about 20 dollars) - $30 (also include 10 dollars for med. just in case)  8) day care $150 a week(thats cheap!!)     You are looking at $990-$1000 a month. (plus your car gas bill will go up with all the running around you will be doing)   I hope I helped, and it will be cheaper, if you breastfed, and you stay at home, but if you can not do one or the other or both, thats completely fine!|`|4ksa4lhWaa	That's really hard to say.      It can be any where from 200 - 500 it all depends Formula is expensive that's 25.00 a can right there.  Breast feed much cheaper and better for baby.  Also clothes diapers, wipes, doc visits, shots, Tylenol, all kinds of stuff you need.      Learn to be thrifty.  By your diapers at Costco. 250 for 40.00 bucks and get the wipes also there.  If your baby likes it get the off brand of formula, also by lots of onies in white. Get a pack n play instead of the whole crib stuff.      (have a shower)  invite everyone you can....|`|08d3778f46ccb1088efa36be8edafa91aa	The big variables are daycare and medical costs. Things like food, diapers etc are only about $1000 for the whole first year. But if you have daycare, it can be upto $12,000/year. And depending on your insurance, medical bills can add up as well.|`|DIZKlxNraa	it depends on a baby.. some babies get more sick.. others don't.. some eat more, some less. Some babies are breastfed some are formula fed.|`|rPoy1AI9aa	a whole lot of money.  my baby was eating a can of formula a week.  25 dollars a week for that.  then diapers, wipes, doctors, child care/babysitter.  clothes, lots of it cuz they keep growing.  stroller, car seat, bottles, i know theres gotta be something im missing.  but thats pretty much it.    found a website     http://www.surebaby.com/costs.php
G2auAv1Saa	I would take a look at her diet. Eating a lot of artificial flavored foods can effect her mood. Take notice of everything she is eating and if you notice a high intake, start to reduce them and see if that helps.   -I am not a crazy new age mom, but I do believe in this- most of the stuff in what kids eat was not meant for us to eat in such quantities.|`|SNllynBiaa	Most 4 year olds don't completely understand death so when your daughter says that she can't really mean it because she probably doesn't fully understand death. Explain death to her but follow up with talk about Heaven.|`|1WRB7RPNaa	she is 4 years old, where would she even get the phrase, i wish she would die?? take her to counseling|`|H4FMzagxaa	send the kid to a doctor, it couldn't really make things worse.    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|YLgdMXiQaa	Tell a doctor|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	she does sound like she has the family depression ..she is sad ..anger is not an emotion it is a symptom of unexpressed saddness.  She is hurting so deeply she has no other way to express this than striking out on the people she loves the most. 4 yr old have no coping skills ..they just react. I would really try a childrens therapist and ..dont let them put her on drugs. Play therapy ...art therapy ..not drugs|`|NAbioaNmaa	Just young kids, try to explain how bad it is. She will understand as she gets older. Grandma knows :)|`|E5rhAaLGaa	Woah!!!  Sort her out. Now!  Do whatever it takes, be strict!  She can't act like that. if you don't teach her the right way, you cant complain.|`|NAzAmFDnaa	My daughter is 4 and if she had that type of behavior I would be RUNNING to a psychologist.  She seems to struggle with her negative emotions.  If she can't learn to cope with them, she might have more difficulty the older she gets.|`|1dRYxFZHaa	Your child has demons probably being drawn to you by symbolism around you, those who speak can only say what they've heard.    She had to have heard these things, she probably heard them in school, other kids talking about horrid parental split-ups and BAM a demon passes from their kid to yours.    She may take years to rid herself of it if you don't help now.    First bind away demons in Jesus's name, get her used to praying in the name of Christ.    I can show you how t o exercise the demons, contact me.|`|58WCrqe1aa	She has problems and needs help.  Your 'spanking' obviously doesn't help.  Why the hell do people hit kids?  Wtf? Pisses me off!  Get her help and stop hitting her!|`|I6dcRgD6aa	i would first examine what kind of diet she is on. Sometimes children have allergies that make them depressed such as to milk or they get hyper from foods with red dye or they feel horrible after eating an egg. There used to be a man named Dr. Sheldon Smith who went on talk shows & told about this. Find a website of other parents who have been through food allergies & see if this applies. I have sugar problems & I know I started getting mad last night but it was past my time to eat. So try to be calm so she will be calm & treat this as something that will be resolved with the proper care. Keep asking what others have done to change the child's behavior in natural healthy ways. Actually, I am not sure what section this is in but I would also to to the alternative health section & ask what they recommend.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	Wow! Well you really need to go to a psychologist!|`|WoxMH0wZaa	Take her to a psychologist now...don't wait. Your husband is right.     She could very well have a behavior disorder, especially with the history of your family. They will be very thorough with your daughter and she won't get labled for something she'll grow out of. If she grows out these behaviors then there will be no need for a label.     You need to get this taken care of right now! It will be so much easier and better for everyone if you do. If you don't, it will get worse and worse and you won't be able to control her any more.|`|deU903Iqaa	i think she may have autism. I would also maybe be slightly stricter, not being mean but sounds a little spoilt.|`|xr9C8dktaa	i think you should take her to a child psychologist immediately.  that behavior is not normal for a child of that age.    edit- usually the best thing that works is time out but you have to be consistant in using it otherwise it doesnt work. most ppl dont do it correctly then say it doesnt work. the thing is i think this goes beyond that. i dont think your child has depression. she is too young i think. but she definitely sounds like she has some kind of behavorial disorder. she just seems to have tantrums but there are much worse behaviors.   -Hurt herself or others and animals  -Frequent tantrums and arguments   -Consistent hostility towards authority figures   -Little empathy and concern for others.|`|yznZqcznaa	Sorry I just saw you said spanking and time outs do not work.  I think that punishing her needs to be consistent so that she knows it is never acceptable to make comments like that.  I would also start taking toys from her, continue with time outs and maybe take away desert, if you have that in your family.  Also talking to her very frankly and letting her know that her behavior makes you sad and that unless she can behave she will have to play by herself.  I think that taking her to see someone might be helpful to you both.|`|ARmhMq5laa	when she says stuff like that..don't give her the :O omg look because i have noticed some little kids like that **** and will do it more to see your reaction.  don't take her to anyone you'll just lose money..don't show reaction and keep spanking her when you need to even though you think it doesn't work.  tell the other people in the family also to do this..and allow everyone she knows to spank her because it takes a village sometimes.|`|tRUoj8cPaa	You better consult a psychologist. May be too much attention are given to grandma and the poor girl is feeling neglected. Take care.|`|01odBlpjaa	if your husband would like to see a child psychologist, why would you stand in the way of that? your child's behavior is obviously upsetting a lot of people and something should be done. in my opinion (i don't have any psychiatric credentials, sorry) i think you should take her for an evaluation. it won't hurt anyone.|`|FsDcrFDiaa	I believe that children of that age don't exactly know what they want.  Not to accuse you or your family of anything, but most children don't posses the intelligence to come up with stuff of that nature.  There might be somethings being said around the house that she is picking up.  Maybe people are arguing or maybe she hears it from the television.  Your daughter might not realize it right now, but if she were to ever lose any of you she would be heart-broken.  As for the grand-mother thing, your daughter might be expressing herself through aggrivation.  She needs attention and possibly through the saying "i wish you would die" comment she really wants the attention from your mother.  Im not completely sure about any of this.  But i can tell you love your daughter very much. Keep showing her support through everything she does.  Sorry I couldn't help anymore.|`|HJcIKFOPaa	The key is second and third opinions. I was taken to a psychologist as a small child. I believe the first visit started at three. I threw tantrums that lasted for 15 minutes, screaming like someone was beating me. I kicked and bit, and the trigger, my mom asking me to pick up toys. SO she took me to the Dr. asked me to come sit down and talk to the Dr. my reaction a fit...the dr. diagnosis...abuse. I can say with out a doubt I was not abused. I also never saw that Dr. again. Was I depressed, yes. There were events leading up to that, which caused depression. If an adult can't cope with depression can you imagine being a small helpless child, confused and depressed? The only label placed is the ones you give her...She might grow out of it...but what if the Dr. does a metal toxicity test and finds that high levels of metal in your daughters blood are causing these outbursts? The solution could be easy. Whatever you do get more than one opinion!|`|1po7rtiwaa	I think you and your husband should get your daughter evaluated by a psychologist. Surely it wouldn't do any harm, and may even be a huge help. Try asking your husband to talk to your daughter about how she feels about her grandmother - it may be that she can talk to him? Just a suggestion. I'm sure that there are other parents in the same situation.|`|maH06XLNaa	I think you should get her evaluated before you go off whipping her and giving her time outs, just in case its something she cant help. She Will probably grow out of it if its behavior disorders. She can get medicine for it. But, if its left untreated it could worsen. If there's nothing wrong with her, i would defiantly work on controlling her temper. There is books on controlling your children and ways to help with it.    I hope every thing turns out of your you, your daughter, and your family.|`|85vDqn6naa	Sounds like the 4 year old runs the house, children learn from their parents/caregivers.|`|01XVg7g7aa	I think that the best idea would be to take her to a psychologist because  that  is quite disturbing. If she does need  the medicine it will help but if she doesn't it will have no effect however if it is depression and they say it's finding the right combo of drugs then just let them treat your daughter. If that does not work i personally would have her baptized or have an exorcism.     I really hope it is just a phase....good luck.|`|GKINbVhsaa	little kids are bad period. some learn faster than others. they sometimes say stuff that they don't really mean. When I was little I was a pretty bad kid. I said nasty things and I had a big lying problem. The thing that helped alot was getting things taken away (not being able to go to camp, no TV, ect.) and spankings... really painful ones lol, but after it was over they would hug me and kiss me and tell me that they only did it because the loved me, not because they are bad. I remember those spanking hurting like no bodies business, but it really worked. I behaved better, but I still did bad stuff sometimes just because I was a little kid. Now that I'm older I appreciate how my parents raised me because it made me more responsible as an adult and showed me that every poor decision I make has a consequence, which makes me a wiser person.    I do not believe that spanking children is wrong, they need to be.  I think its wrong to not punish children because then they never learn anything in life.|`|BKEtBGKKaa	4 is old enough that she knows when something is good and when something is bad. You need to explain to her that it is not acceptable behavior to wish that someone is dead. You can also talk to her about what it means to be dead. A simple start would be to take away a dear toy and ask how it feels that her toy isn't there. If she's really tough, she may say that it doesn't bother her. Keep the toy hidden for awhile and reintroduce it another day - or a week later. If she is excited to see it, remind her how it felt to not have it. There are ways to explain right and wrong and she will start to understand. Be consistent and loving but don't give in.|`|UmVjp0Pqaa	Try a less aggressive approach, don't be soft be firm. It sounds like she doesn't like it when something doesn't go her way or if she is not the center of attention, for example now grandma's moved in you have some one else to talk to and not her. Its hard to give advice because everyone different and obviously we do not know the child. However I think you need to communicate more with her, make sure she understands what hurts people mentally and physically and find a way to understand HER! get her to draw pictures of what she feels (if she can and is old enough) Or just talk to her, she seems to be more clever than you realize. You need to give her a routine. If she gets a temper tantrum treat her the same each time. you could try taking things away until she learns to behave or even blanking her and completely ignoring her until she stops and once she does stop then talk to her like shes an adult. she needs to learn shes more likely to get her way by behaving  and talking then by having a tantrum, treat her when shes good and don't give in when she is bad!!!!! It may be a phase but if you let her carry on it will be worse when she is a teenager. If you really can't cope fine sum help maybe a family support worker, just someone else to talk to for you and for her!       but that's my opinion, you know deep down whats right for her, make sure its your choice and not just because I or anyone else have said you should do this or that!    I have no children, but i work with children as a gymnastics coach so i understand them quite well but other than that i have no source just an opinion.
c9cEZGfraa	not normal. i think your mom did the right thing. you're old enough to know better.|`|256cVXsmaa	I am not trying to be mean or give you a "stupid comment" but this is very very very wrong.  Do you understand that you are not supposed to engage in any kind of intimacy with any member of your family, it is incest.  Why were you guys licking eachother?    I feel like this is fake because who wouldn't no that this is completely wrong.|`|hswTS1jVaa	No, that is not really normal.|`|gKllAGmnaa	no it was not right for her to punish u because u do wut u feel is right.  if i had a sister the same age id lick her too and she give me a ******* so witeva ur mom is a *****|`|HOdblqIkaa	Its normal for growing girls and guys to be curious about their own bodies as well as other bodies but feeling up your own sister and letting her go down on you is not normal. As for your punishment.. I don't know what I would do if I saw my kids playing sexually with each other but I would sit you both down and explain that its something you just can't do. Wait a few years till your older and if you feel the need to do something go do something more productive.|`|rE9J1DqTaa	Ummm INCEST much. Thats gross. She's your sister not your boyfriend/girlfriend. I hope this is fake but yeah ewwww. your mom did the right thing but she should have separated u and your sister for a month instead. Why would you wanna lick each other. GROSS|`|q1cqgVVSaa	try to go to a pastor to minster to you. it is not right, people are blinded thinking it is normal but it is not. try to explain to her what you think is wrong.|`|t2XOjDy4aa	I hope this is fake, because this is very disturbing. If this is real, this is incest.|`|jojKjhUcaa	Yea you need to be punished you know better...... and you know you know better.|`|xZvzLztZaa	Any incestuous relationship is wrong.    If your family is religious, you could talk to a clergyman.  Otherwise, consider psychiatry.    In the mean time try to refrain from your inappropriate relationship, for both of your well beings.    Good luck,  Micah|`|Sjb4jauxaa	this is really wrong|`|rlhsdcAXaa	This is not normal behavior for twin sisters.|`|fTvVEMVtaa	yeah thats not normal...  its one thing to look at ur twin's body...but to feel and do other things like that...its too far.
yB5go5wbaa	I've felt flu-like symptoms before I've gotten my period, before I found out I was pregnant, when I actually was getting the flu, and now, before I'm supposed to have my baby...    You could be preggers, but the problem is that most of the symptoms of pregnancy are pretty similar to PMS symptoms that a lot of girls get.  You could take a test in a few days to be sure!  Good luck.|`|em8A42Bqaa	I felt like I had the flu when I found out I was pregnant at 8 weeks.
AA11327039	I would suggest to rent one from the hospital and ask the lactation consultant there for help.      If anything, make sure you get an electric double pump.  Always pump after baby nurses (like 15 minutes afterward to increase supply)    Don't expect to pump any measurable amount within the first month or even two.    Always nurse baby first because the baby is much more efficient than any pump out there on the market.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Anything by Medela is good. I love my Medela pump in style. It's a double electric pump. It's worth the money to get a good one, the cheap ones are a waste.|`|r5R2nstRaa	yes they are expensive. but buying a cheap one is wasting your money because they don't work as well of course. i've tried both manual and and non. i prefer electric the best. you can set the pump on your comfort settings, and wont get tired pumping. easy place to get one... walmart! the brand i would prefer is graco, or evenflo. both well name brands, and trust me, are great! good luck|`|r52rfBkeaa	I bought the Avent Isis manual pump and I loved it.  I didn't go back to work w/my son so I didn't need something that was going to be quick.  I nursed most of the time and pumped when we were going somewhere or if the baby missed a feeding.  I loved it and it only cost about $35 at the time.  I'm pregnant again with  2 and plan on getting a new one again!|`|igJJ37Tjaa	Electric dual from Medalla is awesome.  Check with your insurance as can cover them, mine did w/ doctors prescription.  You will want this when your milk comes in as it is painful and the pump will help let down before feeding and start inventorying!    Best luck!|`|wTeJulT5aa	I have the Avent Isis Uno electric pump.  It also converts to a manual pump.  It's nice.  I didn't really get to use it though...  I do use the Avent bottles.  I really love them.|`|YEqQZgs5aa	I waited till a few weeks into breastfeeding before buying one  but I ended up buying an ameda purely yours pump, I returned to work when the baby was 2 months, and am strictly breastfeeding it was SO worth the extra money to buy a good one, the Ameda ones are alot cheaper than the medala ones and same quality...  I use Evenflo bottles with it, they fit fine and I couldnt be happier with it...  I pump 3-4 times a day for over a month now... I got the backpack set, came with 6 bottles, its a double pump, works with a car adaptor as well as batteries, came with a "cooler" pack to hold bottles in and came with a manual pump as well, I paid a little over 200 bucks for it all and it has been worth every penny!|`|AJ10p6M0aa	I loved my Ameda Purely Yours double electric pump.  It worked great.  Skip the fancy bags that are offered with the pumps, as you don't need them.  I tried battery pumps and manual pumps as well of different brands (the Purely Yours can run on battery power or be used manually as well as plugged in) but never found another one that worked as well for me.  Important things to look for are variable cycle control and vaiable suction control.|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	I have a breast pump that I used once and no longer use nothings wrong with it I just rather feed her from me so that we have that intimate time together.    I can send it to you if you like all the parts are there and I will send it to you for FREE
Fei8s7vdaa	You'll be just fine at your job with a healthy pregnancy!!  We often think that we have to stop doing our jobs and exercise less..etc but it's not the case.    Your job should understand that standing for a while may be a little achy on your feet as you get bigger and should offer a chair or give you an extra sit down break here and there.      Plenty of pregnant women have jobs that require standing, like hairdressers, waitstaff, housekeepers...etc  Just make sure you're doing what you feel you can do.  If it gets a little tough on the toes or the lower back, just take a 10 minute break.  Your job should help you stay safe and comfortable during pregnancy or else they're not a very good job!
qX8EFFVtaa	There really is no reason for you to get checked out unless you guys are having trouble conceiving, in which case they would need to check a sperm count on you.  Some family doctors can do it, but all urologists do it.  Don't take this the wrong way, but all the man needs to do is produce quality sperm.  Quit smoking, cut out alcohol, and eat healthy food, you can even take a men's multivitamin.  But, there have been plenty of guys who have procreated while they were drunk, smoking a cig, eating a cheesebuger.  LOL!  The point is unless there is a problem conceiving, you don't have much to worry about.|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	Well this is hard to answer with out more information.  Like how old are you and your wife.  How long have you been trying.  If you are in your 30's and have been trying for more than a year.  I would see your general physician for you.  Have your sperm count checked first.  If that comes back normal, then have your wife make an appointment with her OBGYN.  The reason I recommend that you be checked first?  It is a quick and easy test.  All the testing on women is more in depth.  Hope this helps.|`|7uqOSZNKaa	first stop is ur normal family doctor. u didnt say much about ur situation or how long u have been trying for a baby but if u dont want to do the whole wait, you can buy a male and female fertility test kit from boots for about 70pounds for both. good luck|`|fvNVtRDNaa	You  both  need to see ob/gyn doctor.|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	If her obgyn refers you both to a fertility specialist then you'll need to get checked out but typically they rule out the woman first with the obgyn and tell you to give it some time but either one of you can ask for a referal at any time then they do an in depth check on both of you
AA12181093	I gave my son Gerber baby juice.  I watered it down a little, giving him 1 ounce of juice & 2 ounces of water in his bottle.  Gerber's one of the few 100% juices on the market.  I chose apple first, then pear, then apple-cherry. Some blends he liked better than others too.      I wouldn't give an infant straight juice until after they're a year old.  Especially if you're balancing his/her eating solids.      Juicy Juice isn't for infants, despite what other parents will tell you.  It's too strong for their under developed digestive systems.  I'd wait to give that one after 1 year old.|`|bgGKsXmZaa	my was 4 months n i gave him juicy juice punch but watered iy dwn alot! like 4oz water 2oz juice|`|3klIx1Egaa	pear or apple made by heinze. and i would recomment watering it down. put three quarters juice, and one quarter water|`|nDh31823aa	Jack Daniels cranberry.|`|2qjgS99Qaa	apple juice. nothing else!! and welchs or i cant remmeber the other brand but if you go to target and under the baby foods there are little plastic bottles of all types of juice, they are all the same brand but they have alot of different types i gave my daughter and sons apple half apple juice half water then when they started getting older and i knew it wasnt messing with their tummy i would put less water.|`|uDmZFFqgaa	If you get the Gerber's baby juice you do not have to water it down.

I would advise that if you were to enter a private agreement for an arrangement to purchase a home this way that you get a real estate attorney to insure things are set up correctly and use an Escrow account to insure your payments are made on any Loan the landlord may have as--it's often the case you pay them and they end up in foreclosure without your even knowing it.<br>  <br>  If you can find the down payment and maintain a house payment there is always the possibility of obtaining an FHA Loan. These loans are generally for homes under a specific value.<br>  <br>  If I were you--I would reach out in your community... Make your NEED known as widely as possible. Talk to the Pastors of the Churches, send a Press Release to the News Editors--ASK for Help because this is your family! These are your siblings and YOU want to step up you want to provide for them and love them and Need some assistance. You can open a Bank Account for Contributions and set up a PayPal account... There is Nothing Wrong with Asking for Help! You are not responsible for this NEED but want to assume responsibility for your siblings... There will be people who are willing to Help If they Hear your need so do not fear asking. Send a letter to the Masonic Lodge near you -- ASK them for help.|`|u66CkBJLaa	SECTION 8 HOUSING AUTHORITIES FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES.I WAS ON IT AND MY RENT WAS 900 AND WITH MY INCOME AT THE TIME WAS ONLY 343.00 AMONTH.I LIVE IN CALIFORNIA I DON'T KNOW IF ITS THE SAME WHERE YOU LIVE.IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE JUST E~MAIL ME.THERE IS A PROGRAM IN SECTION 8 CALLED F.S.S FAMILY SELF SUFFICIENCY PROGRAM TO BUY OWN YOUR OWN HOUSE.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	What you are doing for your siblings is very nice but im sorry if you cant aford a big enough house for all of them to live in then how are  you going to aford to take care of them and feed them? you cant just always assume that the government will be there for you to fall back on and give you money.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	apply with the state housing authority and explain to them your situation

F3dWvVy5aa	Yes i totally bled for a week. I had to take a week off work. I even called planned parenthhod a few times to make sure the amount was normal, it seemed like a lot. I went shopping with my mom two or three days later we had to leave because I passed a clot. it just scared me a little. But I was really okay, it just bled alot and was fine after that. I also a  year later had a son so she will be okay.
gT31DB1caa	not sure that the cops could do anything unless she is underage and the alcohol is still in her system however you could call department of human services and report her|`|IPsjE9Rpaa	I would call this girl thats a friend thats really buff and tell her what the girl was doing and she would gladly come over and knock her block off by me saying that give her a blue eye to remember it by and take off before cops come... =)     When she's knocked out your write WHORE on her forhead along with baby killer... =)...   Hope she burns in hell... Doctors say its ok one glass of wine.... everynow and then but shots...|`|JM6veEXwaa	This is exactly why abortion should be legal.  This girl does not want the baby.  <br>  <br>  The alcohol won't kill it, but most likely the kid will come out deformed or stupid.

I knew a girl that drank for her pregnancy and her baby was born with low oxygen . It had to be in a n oxygen tent and She had a bluish color for awhile.As the baby girl got older it was quite evident that she lacked a lot of intelligence and her mother had to put her in homes most of the time. It was a sad situation.<br>   She could really hurt her baby from doing that. I probably would have gotten mad and called the cops as child endangerment. Someone should tell her parents or something, I think she has no idea how special a child is and until she sees it she won't realize what she did.|`|q0VxNQSRaa	. I think its far to late to do anything man. the baby is long gone . <br>  i would def consider calling the police and they should reffer u to someone that will do something about this.|`|d3GUVXjlaa	Immediately call the cops!

I never heard of a situation like this lol, i have heard ppl doing coke and having crack babies but they dont usually know any1, but idk.... she is a selfish whore.<br>  <br>  dan beckmann im pro choice, but what she is doing is absolutely  absurd and tht has nothing with pro life, tht is actually being selfish and killing a baby tht she is willingly having rather thn having the abortion. And if she does have the baby, it might have defects, which isnt fair because she chose to have the baby thn abort it.<br>  <br>  personally tho i wud never abort a babay but see nothing wrong with others doing so, unless there rich snobs who have a sturdy lifestyle, or banged up teens.

LBfD7tbHaa	yes.....|`|oiJITSNZaa	YES!! DEFINITELY!! Don't have sloppy "sex" and not worry about being pg! It only takes one tiny sperm to become pg!|`|PWqrphukaa	For your sake I hope not. I wouldn't wish teen pregnancy on anyone. It's hard enough when your in your twenties! It's pretty unlikely, sperm doesn't survive long out in the open, but if you're really that concerned you should buy yourself a pregnancy test. It is possible. You also might just be so stressed your making your body skip a period! Do yourself a favor, if you're going to be sexually active, be safe about it.|`|44o198Zeaa	yes, there is a possibility.  Go get a pregnancy test and talk to your parents.  I know it is frightening, but talk to them.|`|7a57235219ee07bdfd4f569a85d2a3e3aa	You are a kid yourself. Dont waste our time. Thanks.
UfhE3k1baa	Clomid stimulates ovulation. You need to make sure it is your problem and not your husbands, because if it is his all the ovulation stimulation in the world won't do you a bit of good. You are prescribed it through your doctor, but I can already tell you they do not hand it out like candy. Risks of multiple births with Clomid are higher then they would like, so it truly is for infertile women. it has alot fo side effects, but I do not have my information with me, google it and you will find whatever you need. What you do need to know is your ovulation cycle, your husbands sperm count, etc. Do at home ovulation kids. Your cycle days start from the first day of your period, a normal ovulation occurs around CD 14, so test from CD 9-17 to be safe. Have sex at the appropriate times. If that does not work, get your husband tested and yourself. If you want a baby this badly you should be more then willing to do some work with your OB. Again, they do not just hand this stuff out, but I guess every doctor is different.
2SKd9996aa	No, it will not affect an already existing pregnancy. It simply prevents the egg from implanting. I took the plan b within 72 hours and ended up having a healthy baby boy.|`|IK5PoN4Laa	The plan b pill is a multi-faceted pill.  It acts like birth control, so it will prevent you from ovulating.  It also weakens the walls of the uterus so it cannot support a baby.  It also regulates certain hormones from the brain that would encourage the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  It is not really an abortion pill since it is not even a child or a fetus yet.  If any pro-life asshat wants to come in and debate that it was, I have some good arguments.|`|F3dWvVy5aa	No its okay it just stops you from ovulating but if you already ovulated you could still be pregnant. Lots of women on here are pregnant after the plan b. You just have to beat the clock to ovulation is all when taking it.|`|7W8mw4qoaa	NO.|`|AtVRWrwCaa	its definitely not an abortion pill because if you take it while you are pregnant- nothing will happen. the plan b pill just stops ovulation to prevent pregnancy after sex.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	no, it prevents pregnancy and it causes heavy bleeding and cramping sometimes|`|8ELfnTODaa	no it's not. it's pregnancy prevention. <br>  <br>  it makes the uterus slippery so a fertilized egg cannot implant. it's still possible to get pregnant and to avoid this situation again i suggest you get on some form of birth control. i've heard good things about the nuva ring
gT31DB1caa	if she had sex on 12 14 15 days of the cycle there is a chance that she could be pregnant as ovulation occurs on days 12-14 of your cycle.|`|1CryEnb3aa	You have to give us her first day of her last period to even begin to answer this.  You can count 15 days from the first day of her period and that would give you the possible day she ovulated.  Hope this helps.
UfhE3k1baa	Sweety, you just need to calm down. I know it is so scary. It took me 2 years to get pregnant, I am 6 weeks along and I am just a nervous wreck. My whole goal in life is to make it out of the danger zone. I also think about all the things that can go wrong with my baby. But stress is not healthy, we both know that. Did you know if you make it to your 2nd trimester you are like 90% likely to carry to full term? You are doing everything right, your doctor would have told you if something is wrong. If you are that worried ask about getting all the tests you can get that are not risky for the baby to calm your nerves some. Just take a deep breath and think good thoughts. You will have a wonderful, beautiful and healthy baby, just keep your head high and be happy that you are so blessed already!|`|u66CkBJLaa	AWW SWEETY EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OKAY.WHEN I HAD MY MISCARRIAGE I WAS LIKE 'IAM NEVER GOING TO HAVE SEX' BECAUSE I WAS TERRIFIED IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.WHICH IS NORMAL.1 MONTH LATER I GOT PREGNANT.I WAS IN YOUR SITUATION.IT WILL BE ALRIGHT.NOW HES THREE YRS OLD!|`|NwVBautHaa	look im going tho the same thing just try to think positive and just know that u are blessed  with another one thats how i look at it
2SKd9996aa	Yep, heat it until it is steaming and then listeria is no longer a risk. I was given a pamphlet from my Dr. when pregnant about the risks. Because your immune system is weaker when pregnant, you are more at risk. There are people who have actually died from listeria but it is rare. But, in short, yes, you are supposed to heat your lunch meat when you are pregnant.|`|IdoZbO39aa	Not safe - its the nitrates in cold meat that is not good for you when you are pregnant.|`|lJd5OET6aa	REALLY?? its bad??? Oh God I didnt know that im 11 weeks and I eat cold sandwich turkey almost everday!|`|l43NSgHyaa	Don't eat it!!!   Lunch meat can hold bacteria that can be harmful during pregnancy.  With that said, there are *some* lunch meats, that you can eat in moderation.   However, they must have no MSG or added preservatives.  They must be 100% natural.    But, that's so rare to find when it comes to lunch meat.  So, I'd just stay away from it all together.|`|60c7b85533ff654ef788c2cbd51c8788aa	Oh for Pete's sake...EAT THE FREAKIN SANDWICH!!!|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Heat the meat until steaming and it will be fine....BUT, I've had a few sandwiches from subway since I've been pregnant, the thing is, there is ALWAYS a chance of listeria pregnant or not, so the risk is low, its just worse if you get it because you are pregnant and can harm the fetus too.|`|Coc593Ikaa	Yes, heat it until it steams and then cool it back down. Try putting the meat in a baggy and then soaking it in ice water. Then you don't have to wait too long for it to get cold again!|`|zPYyGw8oaa	when I was preg, I had subway/sandwiches once a week and was fine. even my doc said not to stress about it...eat your sandwich and relax :)|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	If it's bad then you should throw it out and go get subway.  I just can't replicate their sandwich no matter what I do.
AA10953561	Kids are very rewarding and will change your life forever. I don't necessarily think my daughter is running my life, but I have changed a lot of my habits since becoming a parent. The most important aspect of being a parent is giving your child a routine. Kids need routine or they turn into little terrors. My daughter is six (and I'm 30 weeks pregnant with another little girl). My daughter has always gone to bed between 7:30 and 9:00 at night. Generally we aim for about 8:00. Now that she's in school I'm up at 5 every morning so I can get the both of us ready and out the door by 7:30 and have her dropped off at school by 8:00am. I'm a full time college student and I do tutoring at the college as well. I'm a SAHM during the summers, but the rest of the time I'm not. <br>  <br>  As a parent you put your child's needs before your own. Your child needs a bath, so you put off yours until late at night when you're bone tired from working all day then taking care of him/her after work. It's definitely easier with two parents in the home, but with your husband doing shift work, the majority of child-rearing will fall to you. Mine was doing the grave yard shift for the last year before his office decided to close down and he's now being laid off. So at night I was the only one there to take care of our daughter. During the day he needed to sleep. He'd pick her up from school and watch her until I was done at the college, but other than that the majority of the work fell to me. Not that I'm complaining, but with your husband working such strange hours it'll probably be the same with you.<br>  <br>  Having children will definitely change your life. It's important that you continue to do at least one thing for yourself. My honey likes to play role-playing games (sort of like dungeons and dragons). So once a week he and a bunch of friends get together to do that. I am a writer and once a week I have a critique group that gets together and reads one another's work. The rest of the time is devoted to our daughter and maintaining our relationship.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Good luck to you!|`|OI3bf4yjaa	It's pretty obvious that it's hard work! I wouldn't trade it in for the world though. I love being a mother. I can tell you this, if you do decide to have children you won't be worrying about your job. You'll be worrying about your new baby. I know that I was SO involved in my job before I gave birth, and I eventually quit because I wanted to be at home with my daughter. I didn't want to hire a babysitter, I wanted to be the one who raises her. <br>  <br>  As for the "baby this, baby that". It's not ALWAYS as bad as people say it is. All babies do is eat, sh*t, and sleep. (Pardon my french)... but it's still hard work. You won't have as much free time as you used to, because you'll have to look after your babies needs...but I personally find that fun. Believe me, being a parent is the best thing in the world.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	Yes it's constantly "baby this and baby that" lol. You're taking care of another human being!<br>  <br>  We have four children and yes, I continue to have other things in my life that I "do". I have much less personal time but for me, it's totally worth it.  It's not a death sentence, it's parenting.  I chose to stay at home after the 2nd child was born. I will say when you have 2 or 3 young children, your time is more limited. When they get a little older and more independent, you have more time for yourself. <br>  <br>  I promise you that if you have a child, your "choices" will change. My husband works odd hours as well, sometimes on call, and working would be nearly impossible for me until my kids are in school full time. <br>  <br>  When you keep odd hours, child care can be a huge issue.<br>  <br>  Children are time consuming but each family is unique. If you and your husband have a good relationship and are able to support each other, things will work out. <br>  <br>  If you don't think you can deal with the loss of personal time, maybe you should wait a while. <br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|aAPkpuhqaa	It has it's hard times but theres more good times. I never regret them at all. I dont feel like it's baby this and baby that. I can still do things i want to do. Some things I just choose not to do. Because I am a mother now and I have to be one for my children. Make sense? And is my life ran by my kids? hmm...Im not sure. I just know that they're like my sun. I need them and without them I'd be lost.|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	It's very hard and trying, but I wouldn't trade it for a million dollars.  I love I get to chase mine around the house all day.|`|d9b1447951374df512b15ee98c0bf39daa	Kids are as much fun/work as you allow them to be. I changed my schedule so that I could be home for my kids during the day and my wife would be home at night. <br>  <br>  This has caused some lapse between her and I but it was a choice we made. As the kids get older then I can move my schedule around again. <br>  <br>  Things have been hard, but when my daughter runs up to me after school (I pick her up) and jumps into my arms yelling I love you Daddy and squeezing me so tight I can hardly breath... oh yeah, its worth it.|`|Szxce0uUaa	yes its hard bein a parents especially if you work full time cuz when you arent at work you are having to take care of the baby though it is very rewarding a child takes up alot of your free time. its hardest for the first few months but once you get you and the baby on a routine it becomes alot easier.|`|EBKTyOAZaa	Really difficult, but rewarding. I love my girls!<br>  <br>  ?u Michelle<br>  ?u Malana<br>  ?u Brandi.
lTUXdbCTaa	My best advice would be to just gradually be away from them for longer periods of time. They need to cry and even scream sometimes to learn that they will be ok.<br>  In this situation, if you leave the room, they cry, and you come back to comfort them, it is telling them that 'if I cry when mom leaves, she will always come back immediately."<br>  You are going to be away from them at times, and they need to understand that you WILL come back, maybe just not right away.

mFQydvncaa	its not a good idea to rely on that, they should have known she wasnt that far by looking at the baby, the boys parts dont drop till around that time, even at 18 weeks when i went they wernt exactly 100 percent, the best time is from 18-22 weeks, yes they can tel as early as 15-16 weeks, but tell your friend not to buy anything yet and personally she shouldnt have wasted her money its best to have that 3d later in pregnancy  so you can enjoy the full benefits,|`|lJd5OET6aa	the tech knows how far along you are you cant lie to them! lmao|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	you can lie all you want to a teck, but the moment they start to look at the image they are going to know who far a long you are..|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	They say 19 weeks is most accurate.|`|ETvV9aypaa	i dont kno if thats possible the tech will know how far along they are after looking at the baby after a little while.. but yeah the further on u are the more chance u will kno obviously. but they say u will definately kno at 18-20 weeks congrads and good luck|`|1jwbQaZTaa	i think 13 weeks is way too early to determine the sex.. the sex organs dont usually develp enough to see until 18-20 weeks.|`|Coc593Ikaa	Well, I can tell you that my 2D one that early was not. I had one at 13 weeks and the tech said it looked like a girl. Well, I can tell you that she was wrong. I've had 3 ultrasounds since which clearly show that I am having a son. The first of these was at 17 weeks. But aside from that, I had a chromosomal analysis, so I know 100% that I am having a boy.<br>  <br>  ADD: Agreed. Maybe the tech was just trying to be polite by not pointing out the lie? But I can't imagine them not noticing how tiny the baby was. Or how underdeveloped for its "age".|`|SJPfjaS0aa	Wether she lied or not, the tech would know the real date by the development of the child. I'm sure they probably gave her an EDD.<br>  <br>  As for the sex of the baby, I have 2 children and I did a U/S with both of them at 13 weeks,3 days. I was told 'girl' both times and I had 1 girl and 1 boy. It happened to be the same technician too and both times she told me its about 70% accurate until you're over 20 weeks then it becomes 95%.
u94HOVz7aa	tylonal, vasaline are all good but dont forget to cleanse it daily how i did it was in the morning and evening i would get a bowl of warm water adn a washrag  then when i changed his diaper (while the just wet diaper was still under him) i would ring the rag out over his circ.  helping to wash off all pee and any blood on it then if any poo was there i would gently wipe.  my son's dr. said just use warm water no soap but to wash a couple times a day to prevent infection but not to use baby wipes to clean it they were ok on the surrounding area but not directly on the incision.|`|cSmUqspWaa	A bit late to worry about pain; you can't give a baby anaesthetics or pain killers.  Just keep cleaning the faeces and urine every few minutes, and hope he doesn't get any permanent scarring.<br>  What ever induced you to mutilate your baby boy?|`|lKsIKKm2aa	Didn't they tell you at the hospital? I'm totally against circ so I've never had to deal with that problem. Sry! First answer sounds about right though.<br>  <br>  The baby can't feel it?? Yeah okkkkk!!!<br>  So stupid...so stupid...|`|Szxce0uUaa	tylenol and and put some vaseline on it with some guaze so it wont stick to the diaper and just watch it make sure it deosnt bleed.|`|q1YDp1y3aa	How about just not doing it at all? There's no reason to put your baby boy through that kind of pain, or the risk of infection- there is no good reason to circumcise! The loss, the pain, and the threat of infection are all really good reasons not to do it at all. -Neb
OI3bf4yjaa	It actually breaks my heart. My sister and her husband have been trying to have a baby for over a year now, and she is completely broken. Just seeing these questions how women - even young girls.. are getting pregnant and they're thinking of abortion. It upsets me and kind of makes me sick.|`|0ac02757252bf3673e5594f1927600faaa	wouldn't it be great if someone could bring those two groups of women together, so the ones who don't want children could place their babies with the women who want and can't have them.|`|ob7jTC5Caa	I'm actually more irritated by the things I see in person than what I read on yahoo answers. I tend to stay away from the "could I be pregnant" questions because it seems like there are a hundred a day.<br>  I get irritated with the women I see or personally know who shouldn't be allowed to have children and they pop out more than one.<br>  For example my ex sister in law is basically the worst mother ever.  She refuses to take care of her kids, watch them, anything and now she got pregnant with baby number 4 from some random guy and decided she wants to watch 2 of her other kids and my stupid brother in law pays her to watch her own kids. It's not fair that she is allowed to have 4 yet some people can't even have one on their own.<br>  That makes me sad.|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	Yes, there are several questions on here recently I would have liked to comment to but wouldn't want to get reported.  Sometimes I just have to keep my comments to myself because I'm pretty straight up with people so I just stay away from those.  You are right though.|`|HFWLYMD6aa	Yes it's horrible, in this day and age we have alot of information about contraception, and it's very easily accessible. why they can't use protection is beyond me. I've been on the pill since i was 18.|`|aZxbMKRCaa	its really sad.. isnt it<br>  <br>  you can only imagine how some children are going to be brought up aswell.<br>  <br>  people need to take responsibility of their actions
bc9inzicaa	Completely up to you, but if you are questioning it, then maybe it is not the right time yet.  <br>  <br>  It is hard to deal with an infant and toddler at once.  I have a seven week old little boy and last week i also babysat my 18 month old nephew.  One child was great; two was a handful.  My husband and i were contemplating on having our second when our son turns two; but from this experience with my nephew and baby, i am seriously reconsidering it!|`|bjNgMocPaa	I reckon you should wait until this 5 month old is at least 1 and a half to two years.<br>  I would just focus on the two children you have now. <br>  Especially with this economic crisis|`|w2HXX6Uvaa	When it comes to family planning I would suggest you go to God about it. When it's time, it's time. If it wouldn't complicate your life why wait. As from previous experience you now know it's not so good to wait for a long time. If you feel it is too soon, just wait maybe a year or so.|`|PWqrphukaa	Well I think that there's no such thing as too soon if you're both ready for it and want it. Buuuut it sounds to me like you are having second thoughts yourself. If you think it might be too soon then it probably is.|`|1f752716589c1a69f4c3bcbb582d7a9caa	i think u should wait to have another baby i think u need to relex n take are of da 2 beautiful children u have now|`|5ItOGyVHaa	my son was 7 months old when we got pregnant again. they are now 5 months and 21 months. and yes some times it is hard. but since you already have a older child. i would have to ask how does the 5 year old interact with baby. is she helpful in every way? <br>  <br>  since mine are so close i some times wish i had more time to spend individually with each of them. but i also know that they are the best of friends and love each other. the oldest is just right to help with smaller duty's like throwing diapers away. <br>  <br>  if you want another one and think you can handel it, then go for it. once you learn to juggle it all, it is great.|`|uezILpQcaa	The final decision is up to you, but, personally, I would wait at least two years. Some friends of mine have kids who are less than two years apart and say it is really hard. They wish they had waited a little longer between them. Also, because I've studied child day care and child development I have learned that children who are less than two years apart can increase the risk of SIDS. <br>  <br>  So, if it were me, I'd wait. Don't think I handle two children that close together.
de103785bc2af3eaeb12cf72d96e7f9caa	Beg your doctor to induce you with pitocin.  (Don't really do that.)  You're almost done, so just hang in there.  Just in case you come across some advice stating to take castor oil - don't use that stuff.  It can cause your baby to pass his/her first bowel in utero and get that stuff in their lungs.|`|ZGcNgRX0aa	raspberry tea<br>  or wear you best pair of knickers, murphy's law says your water will break in them thus ruining them.|`|ilLPvvU7aa	Ha ha!  Love La Belle's answer!<br>  <br>  When I was overdue, sex worked for me.  Not sure if it will help bring it on if you are still a week off though.  Its the orgasm that brought on contractions, so if you don't feel like you're up for it, ask bf/hubby to get creative for you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
cEtxBb7taa	if you are more then 4-5 cm dilated you can't be sent home anyway.  Most places you will have to be at least that to get an epidural in the first place.  that is why.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Because most doctors are on a schedule and want that baby out, I guess. I'm not sure if they wouldn't let you go home, but chances are they'll turn the Pit back up and try to stimulate contractions again. I've heard of it slowing labor down, which can lead to c-sections, but never stopping it completely. BUt I think depending on what stage of labor you're in, they probably need to get the baby out, depending on its stress levels. Too long in the birth canal and it might show signs of distress and pass meconium. <br>  <br>  This is generally why they only let you have an epi after a certain point, because otherwise it will stop labor. Or at least they should. Otherwise you're definitely labeled with 'failure to progress' (which really isn't you, but the drug's fault, often times) and you'll have a c-section. Perhaps they might let you get up and walk around, etc. to get it started again, but sometimes I think doctors have laboring women so scared that something will happen that they threaten a section and that's it. <br>  <br>  It doesn't happen for everyone, but is probably one of the main reasons for failure to progress, which is a definite reason for c-section. It also depends on the baby's position - slightly posterior can cause intense back labor, and if the baby's hands are up near its head that can also cause it to have trouble coming down the birth canal, too. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.birthingnaturally.net/barp/epidural.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.birthingnaturally.net/barp/ep...</a><br>  <br>  ETA: Using Pitocin is like a vicious cycle, when combined with the epi. Pitocin ramps up your labor, causing stronger contractions in most women, and leads to more frequent epidural use, which can then slow the labor down again. It's like a chicken or the egg thing. It doesn't happen for everyone like this - but is probably one of the leading causes for the incredibly high c-section rate in this country (What are we at now, 33%?) - because of augmented labors.|`|1CryEnb3aa	I believe if you are in "active" labor they keep you.  If, you are dilating and everything is moving forward and then wham it stops.  They will not let you go.  You body is trying to get the baby out and it comes to the point where it needs help.  So, the Dr's will not let you go past a certain point and will take it by c-section.  This would be considered medically necessary.  You do not want your baby sitting in the birth canal too long.  So, the dr makes the decision to take it by c-section.  I had a cousin who's labor did exactly this and they let her go with out a c-section and his skull was totally flat on one side and his forehead was shaped like a football.  They rushed him to x-ray and did tests on him.  This shouldn't have happened.  He ended up ok, but how freakin scary!|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Good question, I don't know the answer, but i will be checking back to see if anybody else knows.|`|690279cb7caa51056d2e306c73dae94faa	I don't think so. They tried to force me into a c-section and I told them no, I wanted to have a vaginal birth.  I got my epidural at 6am and while that was happening, my water broke.  I was at 5 cm after all night.  I stalled at 3cm the night before around 8pm.  After my epi, I stalled again then they gave pitocin.  Of which my daughter didn't like.  Her heart rate went down whenever they'd admistered it.  I convinced them to let me to nipple stimulation which worked better.  Around 11pm that night I finally gave birth.  Boy they made me pay for not getting a c-section.  They took my baby away for 3 hours while I waited nervously in my room.  I wasn't allowed to leave.  It wasn't very fair.|`|aTyNsdApaa	Usually if they give you an epidural you are already admitted to the hospital and things are well on there way. But if it does stop why not get a little help and make things progress. I don't know why you would want to wait any longer? It's been 9 months already...I don't know why people get mad when the doctor breaks their bag of water or they get put on pitocin. I was induced I had my water broken an epidural and a little dose of pitocin and 6 hours later a happy healthy baby in my arms.
UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	My sex drive increased...  All the sex I wanted no chance of pregnancy, is a fantastic aphrodisiac...

lJd5OET6aa	well my sister had cysts on her ovaries and they told her she wouldnt be able to have kids but guess what 2 months later she was pregnant! now the odd periods might affect it because you never know when your ovulating but you can always take medicine like chlomid that makes you ovulate. I would look into maybe getting the cysts removed?? i dont know maybe they arnt dangerous.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	true story...i went to school w/ a girl who had cervical tumor, but they caught it in time and removed it, but they told her she'll never be able to have kids. she started taking birth control for her irregular periods...<br>  <br>  2 years after the tumor was removed, while still on birth control...she gets pregnant. now has a healthy baby boy.|`|dSobv28maa	Im going to the doctors march 2nd to ask her the same thing. I went 5 months without one and she gave me pills to "jump start" my period. That was in October and its once again a no show. im worried about conceiving too. When i go to her in a couple weeks i'll have to let you know what she says. Good luck to you.. and me too haha

Paxton is v. much a boys name but when you pair it with Harper it screams girl to me.  Maybe with a very boyish 2nd middle name it might sound better:<br>  Paxton Harper James or Paxton James Harper <br>  <br>  i think Paxton James Harper sounds better because it almost looks as though Harper might have been your maiden name or something that u just wanted to add in there.

Q5tq5WOKaa	When was your last period? You can try this method: 7days before menstruation and 7days after,you are infertile.If you have done sex within that period means you are safe.Example: if you're period came last Feb.7,non-fertility started Feb.1-6,you don't need to use any birth controls.and Feb7-14,still you are safe.That's if,you're menstruation is regular,meaning if you have a 28days cycle.|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	Wait until you miss your period.. then test. Wait at least 2 weeks.|`|Xwr2LKCSaa	wait about 2 weeks. trust me it will feel like fooooorever till 2 weeks get there. make sure to get 2 test atleast. take one in 2 weeks, then the second one save it for a week after that. just to make sure.<br>  <br>  if he didn't bust in you, you rprobably not pregnant. but pre-c. is what catches everyone off gaurd.. you know.soo next time just to be careful try using a rubber ;)
P0Fjh59Eaa	...wow! just WOW!<br>  <br>  of course that wont help NOW! it only takes 8-10 days for a fertilized egg to implant into your uterus. the birth control pill is not a plan B pill...which is only effective 24-48 hrs after unprotected sex. <br>  it can potentially abort a pregnancy to take the pill while pregnant, but that is VERY dangerous as well as it can cause blood clots etc.|`|uh5DlJzqaa	Well in theory if you hadnt had sex and your not pregnant now and you start birth control then yes you will NOT get pregnant. WELL Birth control works only 99.9% but you get the idea|`|Qz7YtDXUaa	No, Birth control doesn't work that way the pill and condoms are meant to PREVENT not terminate an excisting pregnancy, so if you are already pregnant then it won't work, and the Plan B drug is only effective for 24 hours (I believe) after conception. You can take it (and it is best to start taking it) now to prevent this in the future|`|Fw1di2cBaa	Yes.... unless you got pregnant a week ago.  It is too early to tell.  If you find out you are, stop taking the birth control immediately.  You should be able to take an accurate pregnancy test in 1 week, or you could go to the doc and get a blood test now.

If you are not pregnant remember this experience and take the proper precautions in the future, condoms are cheaper then babies.|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	Could be either but maybe call your doctor to be for sure.|`|R1uFA7nKaa	nope doesn't sound like you're pregnant.|`|AA10982164	When your periods are irregular, it is harder to tell if your pregnant. <br>  The periods of nausea make it sound very possible, as well as the mood swings, which in my experience were worse in the early stages of pregnancy. With one child, I got a sore belly in the very early stages.<br>  <br>  Your best bet would be a home pregnancy test. <br>  <br>  In the meantime, treat yourself like you are pregnant. Don't take any medicines except antacid and tylenol. Eat as well as you can, and be sure your getting plenty of liquids.<br>  <br>  Do not smoke and don't drink any alcohol. <br>  <br>  If the test is positive make an appointment to start prenatal care asap.<br>  If it is negative, continue to treat yourself as if you are pregnant, because it could just be too early to show up on a test, although if you have been nauseous for weeks, it should be far enough along to show up on a home pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  If you continue to have symptoms and  don't start you period soon, go to the Dr. If your not pregnant you could still have some hormone imbalances.|`|YkzPfyp2aa	The only sure way to find out is to get a pregnancy test.|`|iGrj5lS5aa	pregnancy test|`|6zuoRhFvaa	i think you should definetly take a test. and take one every week until you get your period. <br>  <br>  other questions to ask... <br>  <br>  have you have unprotected sex? if so, you want to wait at least two weeks before you start testing. <br>  if not, have you started or stopped taking birth control lately? that can always make your periods irregular and give you weird symptoms. <br>  <br>  personally i can relate, i thought i was pregnant for symptoms similar to yours (weird bouts of nausea, weird stomach pains, extreme moodiness) every test i took was negative, even went to the dr for a blood test; turns out i wasn't pregnant, i'm allergic to dairy.

uAiKpNumaa	i have a new baby cousin who is 11 months old and one if the smartest downs i have ever seen,when my aunt was pregnant they ran a test and told her it might have downs she was upset but she told themshe would love him no matter what.consider it to be so early i do not think he will have a hard life considering what he has already conquered upon birth he was diagnosed with lukiemia we almost lost him but now he is well on track and only a month behind normal babies his age. John has downs but Is by no means "ugly" i swear to you he is one of the cutest babies ive ever seen  i have pictures on my myspace if you would like me to send you one you may email me i know for a fact that my aunt would never put john throught surgery to make him look "normal" unless it was an issue like a child with a severe lisps would have.<br>  It would never be considered and i know this.No, i believe downs are gifts they can be the sweetest children youll ever meet honestly. If a parent is bothered that there child looks downs they dont deserve that child b.c they cant help it and changin a kids looks will not change the mental disability of the child|`|XjYy1k5Xaa	Your questions are really well written and organized. I do not know anyone who can answer these questions but maybe you can find some answers or some sources that you can email. <a href="http://www.nads.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nads.org/</a> I with you the best of luck on your project assignment. Can I read it when you are finished? It seems so interesting.
PWqrphukaa	With my son I got him to sleep through the night by just letting him cry. My doctor said to wait 10 min and then just talk to them and rub their belly, but DON'T pick them up. Then just repeat. It was hard not picking him up, but after a week of that he slept through the night EVERY night! I never appreciated sleep so much.. lol|`|z9gjrAVQaa	Try putting her to bed an hour after you normally do. and don't let her take a nap too late. say give her an 30 minute nap around 3 or 4 then keep her up as long as you can. that way she'll be more tired.|`|luDdXgfEaa	try taking her a bath before she goes to sleep. Also check with her doctor, maybe something's bothering her. My son was the same way and it tuns out he had bad allergies and needed medication. Good luck!|`|rUnwBQ6oaa	It happens that few babies sleep longer time as they grow up, but few don't. Check if you baby is hungry when she goes to sleep at night. Feed her enough (solids + milk/formula). Make sure her tummy is full and doesn't hurt (so that she doesn't become gassy !). Put her to sleep and maintain silence after she goes to sleep.
GWveqx61aa	from day  1 to day 7 you should have your period, around day 14 you should ovulate, if the egg gets fertilized then about 7-14 days later the egg will implant into the uterus. if you are not pregnant than on the 28th day you will get your period. with some women this varies, not every woman has a perfect cycle, but it will most likely always happen about 14 days before your period comes so if you had a 35 day cycle than take 14 away and thats around when you ovulate.hope this helps|`|7a57235219ee07bdfd4f569a85d2a3e3aa	2 weeks before your expected period.|`|LBfD7tbHaa	!4 days before your period''''''|`|t8HPCzrOaa	its depends on your cycle everyone is different if you have your period every 28 days youlll most likely ovulate on the 14|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	Everyone's cycle is completely different. an "average" cycle is 28 days, but some have shorter and some have longer. my cycle is every 31-33 days so i know i usually ovulate around day 16-20.<br>  <br>  try googling Ovulation Cycle for answers.
