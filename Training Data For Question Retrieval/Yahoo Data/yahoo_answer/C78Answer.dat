dPGKde90aa	estuve leyendo las respuestas y te contestan cualquier cosa. te explico un poco como funciona en argentina el tema de las condenas penales. si te condenan por ejemplo a 12 a?os y sos primario tenes derecho a la libertad condicional con conducta y concepto penitenciario bueno a salir en libertad con los dos tercios cumplidos, o sea 8 a?os. si sos reincidente no tenes ese derecho. en los casos de prision perpetua tambien existe esa cifra de los dos tercios para los primarios, pero en la reclusion perpetua es mas larga la pena. para los reincidentes no hay nada salvo el articulo 17 que les permite salir a trabajar afuera cuando ya les queda poco tiempo de condena. la ley del dos por uno dice que se computaran dos dias de prision por cada uno cuando el proceso supere los dos a?os. a partir de esos dos a?os se te computan dos dias por cada uno detenido desde ese momento hasta el final del proceso. esa ley tiene rango constitucional y fue incorporada por el pacto de san jose de costa rica. su logica dice que un reo no tiene la culpa que un estado demore mas de dos a?os para saber si el imputado es culpable o inocente.|`|ciut6Dlcaa	Depende del Codigo de Procedimientos Local|`|0qPEDIyEaa	Hola, depende del pais, en Argentina existe el 2 x 1, que te cuentan como 2 a?os, cada a?o que estes sin condena efectiva, o sea, cuando estas preso, pero todavia no determinaron la sentencia. Cuando la determinan, si te dan 10 a?os, pero 2 estuviste detenido sin sentencia, ya tenes 4 a tu favor<br>  Saludos|`|54d690bd86efcad12c060cac8139fe34aa	La cosa no es asi, todo es en relaci√≤n a las actividades que realices adentro, porque si te la pasas todo el tiempo acostadote rascandote la panza no haces meritos para gozar de ese beneficio, debes trabajar en algo productivo, tomar cursos, hacer labor social, solo entonces te empiezan a tomar en cuenta el tiempo en tu favor y no solo el tiempo real que pases encerrado, (demostrar que realmente te estas rehabilitando).
AA10045620	Yes, you need permission from the father to go to another country.  You would probably have to go to court, with a good reason, and ask that they change the name.|`|KKaggQr7aa	You cannot remove father's name from child's birth certificate once its issued. The only way Father's name section can be left empty if child is born illegitimately (without wedding bond) and u declare at the time of issuance of Birth Certificate that u don't know who the father is. Once father is identified, his name is there on the Birth Certificate forever.<br>  <br>  Each time u want to take ur daughter out of the country u need his permission.
vp8806Eraa	In this exact example, it would never happen.

It was a government job.  I had way more seniority, education and licenses then he yet he was promoted one grade above me.  <br>  To your point, CEO pay has to be reigned in.  It constitute stealing.  They ( through bogus compensations boards) set their own pay and benefit package.  Much like congress.  For an individual to get 100 million dollars for 3 weeks work is grand theft!  I as a stock holder (supposed owner of the corp) would never approve such nonsense!  Would you?|`|qjH3Tigbaa	His model doesn't Bankrupt the top 5%, you have to realize hes not taking all of their wealth and making everyone have equal pay.  That is NOT how it works.

For the REcord I dont agree with it either I think it is wrong.|`|RtHq6y78aa	My husband makes more money than his "boss".  He's in the Investment Industry.

How would he know how businesses run?|`|whE5OQ26aa	Well, have you seen what these people have been paying themselves recently?<br>  <br>  That's why the economy has been destroyed. I hate to tell you, but you cannot have a properly functioning economy if a small percentage of people are hoarding money by paying themselves an exorbitant amount. That means there will be less consumption in the market. That means there will be less sales for business.<br>  <br>  Which is why Republicans will figure this out soon. If you don't yet, I understand, but your beliefs will die hard. People need to have money to buy things from you. It's common sense. You can't give people that have $15 million another $5 million. It doesn't create jobs! They save it, or blow it on crap!|`|AA10811674	Well let me put it like this. One year when we didn't get a raise our CEO was making $68,000 per hour. His name was Gerald Levin at Time Warner.|`|xagiOb80aa	Yes, actually I have.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	You obviously don't understand President Obamas economic policy,.
nZ2fxLumaa	No, it is not against the law.  Not in the person's best interest, financially, but some people have more money than sense.  If you are highly abusive, profane, or interfering with the officer in the performance of his duties, then it could be unlawful.  It all depends on how it goes down and if it can be articulated on a report and in a court of law.|`|1N2RCOJAaa	yeah it is but atm i cant think of the exact charge.  Dont do it.....its basically the same as hitting a cop.|`|R0sS6cOuaa	Nope, you can walk up to a police officer and tell him to go f---himself.  Now doing it while on  a stop is a guarantee way to get that money fine, and I will nit pick every single detail that I can find to add more to the citation.|`|VmIRQJP1aa	No, there is no law that prevents you from calling an officer a name, however, it is disrespectful and if you are already getting the attention of an officer the chances are you've done something either wrong or highly questionable. Therefore, by calling an officer a name it is likely they will find something to charge you with.|`|g7gOoX0vaa	they might not charge you for that, but a lot of cops will look closer at your situation and pick off things that normally would be ok. you can say what you want, but they will make up some bs if you say things to them.<br>  <br>  its the usual situation with cops. if you do something that is not illegal that they dont like (swearing at them), they will bust you for something else that is marginal.|`|jEAs4vx7aa	No it is not illegal, but as others have said they will get you for every little thing....... and don't forget - you may beat the charge but you can't beat the ride (to jail).|`|kHIv6OO5aa	It is very possible he/she could arrest you for:<br>  Disturbing the peace<br>  Disorderly conduct<br>  Harassment<br>  <br>  I am not sure if it would hold up in court, but I dont think something like that would be worth the trouble. Not to mention, judges would not be very found of such behavior.|`|d7WkQnEZaa	No. You have freedom of speech, but there is some form of harassment. Idk it always depends what you say. If you call him a *****, fag, or some derivation of a sexual based insult it's sexual harassment. In order for him to actual arrest you for normal harassment, I have no clue. Just don't do it. They will always find a way to nail your ***.|`|764424668e9ca7895662bf58fe93a9d0aa	No, being disrespectful to a cop is not against the law. Be careful though. It isn't hard to go from being disrespectful to being threatening or disorderly or a breach of peace.
hhJrwRNdaa	Where did you come up with that?<br>  <br>  Don't you have anything else to do are you really that bored.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	You just made that up.|`|PtHThRoNaa	Post a link please.

63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	he is only hurting the children by not letting them see the other family and yes she could try getting grandparent rights through the courts .. i am not sure how the UK works but some places hereion the states the grandparents do get some visitation rights<br>  Good Luck|`|6aw3naCNaa	Well you can try and get some custody but at the end of the day, the Kids dad has all the legal rights huni.<br>  <br>  The dad might think you will take the kids to see their mother, which from the sounds of it is a bad idea.<br>  <br>  I understand what your sister does is nothing to do with you but for the moment i would just stick to the supervised Visits, he must have his reasons!!|`|8xMhLMoRaa	Grandparents have no legal rights to grandchildren, which can be a very sad state of affairs in a case like this. I think your mum should do what the dads are asking, and to see them supervised at first, and after a few visits, they will see that your family is loving and reliable and not at all like your sister and hopefully, you will be able to take the children out sometimes. Because of what your sister has been like, the dads are probably only looking out for their children, and they might not know that you and your mum are nice people. They can learn this though.<br>  <br>  I wish you lots of luck with this, your sister's children are lucky to have to to care about them.|`|AWSmknxLaa	no|`|oVhKGw3Maa	Lets face facts here(as you have told them to us). Your sister is a drug and alcohol abuser. You tell us she has a boy friend who is violent. And you are wondering why they authorities have placed the children with their natural father. You have said that the father will only consent to a supervised visit and not in the company of your mother. I can draw my own conclusion as to why he demands these terms. You should be grateful that he allows any visitation rights at all,given the circumstances.Before you start banging on about yours or your mothers rights, start thinking about the children,s  rights. They have the right to a peaceful uninterrupted life, free from drug addicts and certainly free from violent men who have no connection to the defenseless children.You are old enough to be aware of things, so stop thinking about what you want and start thinking about what the children deserve.As I have previously stated, just be glad he allows the mother anywhere near them.
CmG8oTH0aa	Well, it was not meant to be dumbed-down, it just that Bobby Jindal has no real clue.<br>  <br>  How does one ask what is "volcano monitoring"?<br>  <br>  Is that not one of the most direct ways of communicating?<br>  <br>  I mean, how can you misconstrue "volcano monitoring"?<br>  <br>  I guess when Mt. Saint Helens erupted, mr. jindal just didn't care or understand.<br>  <br>  You would think that a governor from LA would be intune with the dangers of Natural Disasters.<br>  <br>  So much for the new GOP.

I'll tell you.   It means the market expects long rates to boomerang.    That means the Fed will have to choose between hyperinflation and raising the Federal Funds Rate, i.e., it means that it will soon no longer be able to finance the recovery by resorting to the printing press.<br>  <br>  It's amazing to me that so many people believe in man-made global warming despite Hansen's inability to predict the climate, while so few people have even heard of Austrian School Economics, even though they've amazingly predicted the bubble(s) (housing, oil, etc...) and this crash.|`|CNSGz12zaa	It was embarrassing to watch.

Rush makes a good ventriloquist and Jindal the perfect Dummy! Rush is the REAL voice of the party! If this is what we have to go against in 2012--Bring it on! This speech was the worst I have seen in response to a Presidential address in years....and did you see McCain in audience for Obamas speech, the poor old guy must be getting feeble he could not even stand up! He was probably day dreaming about riding in Obama's Helicopters. The ones he so ungraciously brought up the other day. He probably wants Obama to take a horse and buggy like they did in his day. The Republican offered nothing but the same....the same old thing that created the economic crisis...Keep on giving these speeches and our SUPER MAJORITY will be in place shortly!|`|dHjya1Yoaa	Maybe it's because he realizes that the majority of Americans barely have an 8th grade education.... :/ <br>  <br>  <br>  GED is tested at the 8th grade education level not the 12th... :/|`|HcFHLGIaaa	Jindal can improve his speaking and oratory skills.<br>  <br>  Obama can't change his soul.|`|AA11963685	Jindal knows his audience, of course he dumbed it down.

He has publicly apologized to the IRS, who now report to him, and have accepted his apology. Spending $300k on a grape museum in upstate NY is not pork barrel spending, but shovel ready project that may be the final straw to us roaring back from this Republican created crisis.

Christians are not to judge. others may, but i won't. you don't know her plight, why she resortrd to ivf, why she didn't just say "throw them away" about the potential children. it may not fit our idea or ideal as a way to have children, but is happened. she should be supportrd, not scorned. our lovely government kills enough afghans, iraquis and pakistanis daily. paying for eight to live is of little concern to me. <br>  <br>  by the way, sperm are produced daily. a woman has a fixed number of eggs in her lifetime. fertilised eggs are a niche higher in her mind than the egg she loses every month.|`|BO28Mn8haa	because there are only a certain amount of womens ovum before it's all gone where as men produce millions and millions of sperm|`|tdIuoIc1aa	Octomom is a conservative quack.

That octomom has mental issues.|`|kyTBaYFlaa	why freeze em, use em now, spread the wealth, go for it dude.|`|SSLekPAnaa	Octomom is a liberal quack. Nothing more, nothing less.

If you ejaculate in the toilet today, you have a fresh supply tomorrow.<br>  <br>  However, women are born with a finite number of eggs and that is all they will ever have. On average, a woman will only release about 400 mature eggs in her reproductive life. Men can release hundreds of millions of sperm with each ejaculation.<br>  <br>  Taking all of this into consideration, I think it's fairly obvious that the supply and demand put a much higher premium on the woman's egg than the man's sperm. But to go a bit further, an unfertilized egg is not life. It is a resource with the potential to become life, but it is not alive on it's own. A woman may consider her unfertilized egg(s) to be precious life, but that doesn't make it so.|`|dcd11iUwaa	you cant guarantee that all of your sperm will be suitable for fertilization.<br>  odds are only 10% will be suitable to produce an inseminated egg.

While there are many justified criticisms one can offer of Mr Obama, financial profligacy are not among them. Travel is part of the job. Mr Obama may be more impressed by the "nifty" quality of having Air Force One at his disposal since unlike many former Presidents, he did not grow up in a "jet setting" family making frequent use of private aircraft. But he is also intelligent enough to realize that he has 4-8 year to enjoy the "nifty" gadgets that go with the job and not use them whimsically just for personal pleasure.

whE5OQ26aa	I've never liked people on Wall Street, and their attitude during the economic crisis has convinced me these people need to be thrown out. They are a bunch of cliquey guys who think they are the only ones allowed to screw up in life and get paid.<br>  <br>  I'm tired of listening to their propaganda about poor people on welfare.

Do you really think that I should make foolish investments and lose money?  <br>  <br>  What you regard as 'Wall Street' is nothing more than all of the people who invest their money.  The drop in stock prices is the result of millions of individuals seeing Obama's policies as bad for the economy and moving their money into places where it is better protected from poor economic conditions.|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	You need to explain what you mean.  By itself, your question makes no sense.  I wonder who or what you think "Wall St" is.|`|CBx6qHztaa	Haha...what?<br>  <br>  You should ask why Obama keeps opening his mouth and scaring investors.|`|HcFHLGIaaa	Do you even have a concept of what Wall Street is?<br>  <br>  Are you aware that individuals by the  thousands have been liquidating their portfolios since BO became president?

We want the Federal Government to do what it is supposed to do and nothing more.  We want people to be free of excessive taxation and government imposed regulations.  We believe in private property rights. We believe that the power to govern comes from the Creator to each and every American as a birth right.  We only lend it to government officials as is necessary and will take it back as we see fit.<br>  <br>  We assert that our rights come from God not from any government and are unalienable.  That means they do not come from the government and no government can take them away or limit them.  We believe the Founding Fathers created the Second Amendment to guard against Tyranny not for squirrel hunting.<br>  <br>  So, yes, we will continue down the path of the Constitutional Government our Great Founding Fathers left us.

ASXeYOjAaa	"Seem?" No. It is observably a fact.<br>  Of course the president's words have an effect on the stock market. The market "reacts" to expectations about the future so when the President promises things long proved to do harm to economies, the market gets squeamish.|`|AA11312653	Does it seem like the Big Players who are able to manipulate the stock market are trying to bully, blackmail, browbeat, or otherwise bludgeon the new administration to continue being "the permissive parent" who lets them do pretty much as they please, and having a little tantrum that "the strict parent" is now in control and will demand that they account for their destructive and reckless actions of the past 8 years?<br>  <br>  Remember, the Dow and Nasdaq are not indicators of our general prosperity. "The Market" is where the Big Guys have their high stakes gambling and it is purely incidental that we Little People make a few dollars here and there with our side bets. Our Corporate Media continually tells us that "The Market" is something that something we should be constantly concerned about, but consider that Our Corporate Media has also convinced gazillion parents that they must shuttle their children to and from school lest the children be abducted by evil strangers. The actuality is that it is more likely children to be struck by lightening during the school commute than it is that they will be abducted by a stranger. Our Corporate Media promotes a point of view based on fearfulness rather than on realistic assessment of risk. <br>  <br>  The Big Guys will eventually tire of their little temper tantrum and resume playing their game. The Little People will no doubt suffer, while the Big Guys never so much as miss a meal.|`|fKFvzlzQaa	The stock market was ridiculously overvalued.<br>  <br>  the stock market is in the process of reaching a more realistic value.<br>  <br>  I doubt that Obama has much effect on that one way or the other.|`|AA10719402	The stock market and the economy are like spoiled children.  They want their candy and throw fits when they have to take their medicine.  Obama's plans are medicine for the economy.<br>  <br>  We are on the verge of a great depression and investors are bitching about how stocks are going to do over the next few weeks or months.  It they are scared of risk they shouldn't be in the market.  If they want to minimize their exposure they should be putting more of their money into the lower risk investing  (the commercial paper market for the next year would help the economy and protect their money), but instead they just want to complain that the stock market isn't stable enough for them to make money consistently.  It is crazy IMO.  With stock prices low you can make a lot of money on very small investments in a few years when the economy bounces back, but the reality is most investors follow conventional wisdom off the cliff in stock market downturns.   I really don't care about them.  The collapsing market is redirecting money from those investors too lazy or arrogant to work to keep it. <br>  <br>  I do feel bad for people who have been laid off and have no choice but to cash out their 401K now, but I don't feel bad for people who are just panicking and taking a 401K bath rather than leaving it to bounce back in 3 years.

Remember that Bush had made no major policy decisions by this time in his presidency, and think of what Obama has done.  In my opinion, with all that he is doing, it is amazing that his numbers have not dropped more, which is typical for ANY president.|`|56db1a8e5fe3dfc4d4fbbbff987d0191aa	Yes they are dropping, people are realizing that the great "change" that was coming was actually "coins".

Bell Laboratories from New York was the first company to bring out a prototype of a solar battery into the market."<br>  <br>  And the US invented what we know as the automobile today, the gas powered car.

Although the Chinese invented rockets over a thousand years ago, it would be reasonable to say the the US (or USSR) invented space travel.  That is, the technology was brought to practical application.<br>  <br>  In that vein, the practical silicon solar cell was a product of Bell Labs in the 1950's.  For decades, the US was the leader in semiconductors, including solar cells - which leads to Obama's point.  China, Japan, and Germany make most of the world's solar cells, now.  What he wants to do is recapture a leadership position in the energy fields.  I'd like that, too.  It was sweet living here when the USA made all the world's best stuff, and "Made in Japan" or "Made in China" meant something inferior.  That's the main point.  It's pointless to pick on a minor detail such as the nationality of the person with the original concept.|`|AA10798839	Who invented first car, airplane and radio what is one more misconception.

ceac5e1af44045f0a37db88050efe019aa	Instant runoff voting basically means voters number the candidate in order of their preference which means that there is no need to have a runoff since whoever gets more number ones wins.  This process would save a lot of time, money, and political reputations in the long run, but there would be some expense to change over from the current system of voting. Also, it might give voters two votes instead of just one. IRV isn't "bad"; like most things it has positive and negative aspects.

XAlCd8Ebaa	Because we've been hearing his name a lot as a potential GOP presidential hopeful. Many assumed he was being put out there as such simply because he didn't look like the usual Republican. Since Palin was clearly used simply because of her gender, we assumed Jindal was being used due to his ethnicity.

"want to be President?

She already had 6 kids prior to being artificially inseminated and she is both unemployed and unmarried.  Not to mention she is living at her mom's 3 bedroom house and collecting unemployment checks.  This is more than just "another welfare mom"...this is a moral and ethical issue that demands legislation.  There needs to be a federal statute that makes it impossible for people who are artifically inseminated to receive any monetary support from the government.  If you can't afford to be artificially inseminated in the first place, then why is the government rewarding her with money to raise her kids after they are born?  Also, the doctor should be banned from practicing medicine for life for agreeing to put all those embryos in her knowing that she had no means for supporting them once they were born.|`|zmmP52P3aa	ding! ding! ding!

There are two real problems to me, dealing with the doctor and the fact that she chose to carry to term the multiple embryos rather than selectively abort.  They should never have implanted her with that many, and there should have been an agreement to abort if there were excessive implantation's.<br>  I think California and other states will now need to create some guidelines as to the availability of in vitro. They may also need to institute a psychiatric evaluation before having someone eligible for the procedure.  And the number of embryos implanted should never go so high.  The ethics of that doctor are rightfully being looked into, but laws have to be created to back that up.<br>  What you can't do is allow income to dictate parenthood.<br>  Since she wasn't on welfare at the time, its no ones business but hers.<br>  If she had had one infant we wouldn't be reading about her.<br>  She may very well have to go on welfare now, who is going to hire her as a single mother with fourteen very young children?<br>  <br>  We all, especially in the present economic climate, need to understand that you can lose your job and go on welfare, that doesn't mean you should have the children you already have  taken away.|`|oojO4WAraa	Because she had them implanted, and had multiples.<br>  <br>  Somehow having 6 embryos implanted seems different than just having irresponsible sex.

How's that for prudent investment by Brown!<br>  <br>  Just to scare you that is Ôø°3,400.000.000.000 debt we collectively owe.  <br>  Assuming that attracts an interest rate of 5% that is an additional Ôø°17,000.000.000 being added per year!<br>  <br>  The Government does not have any money.  Their money is "taken" from us in taxes.  So watch the taxation go up dramatically after the next election!<br>  <br>  Every family now owes Ôø°200,000, with interest of Ôø°10,000 a year being added.  At this rate you, your children, your grandchildren, and even your great grandchildren are going to be paying it off! <br>       <br>  The Government do not have a clue what to do!  There is no money in the kitty for any serious "bribes" for the general population! <br>  <br>  By the way - it is going to get worse!  Please remember this at the General Election.

And the government should be blamed for not realising that a recession was inevitable.<br>  <br>  But a stimulus cheque is pointless.

He has to clean up Bush's 8 years of messes first!!|`|BRyRtQSvaa	I am, I got 4 years of "I told you so's" coming!|`|JLayHNZCaa	Yours is foolish pride.  I am proud we elected a man who is doing the right thing for our country right now.|`|T0pkW783aa	Oh, yeah!  I am proud to always do my research before voting for anyone.  Red flags were all around on Obama but few chose to listen, other than listening to his speeches (saying nothing but having a great presentation).  When you don't know anything about a candidate and still choose to support him, then you pay a very big price when he destroys the Nation with his Socialist CHANGES, big spending and raising of taxes.  The broken promises are taking place every single day and the doom and gloom is in the forefront of the news.  Obama wants you to be so scared that you will trust him to pass those bills immediately to save us all.  What kind of nonsense is it to rush through massive spending bills without even reading or knowing the details???  I have great pride in the America I knew and loved and great fear of losing so many freedoms by putting a Socialist, Marxist loving man in charge of everything.  It will take many decades to recover from this travesty!!  I can't stand the man or most of his cabinet; especially Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid.  Biden is worthless, as well and puts his foot in his mouth on a daily basis.  This is not a leadership team but one who is on the path to destroy the Nation as we know it.|`|b931753da53fa7c2b1a6ae8598d475b8aa	You'd never know that there are 42 million, at least, people who didn't vote for Obama...don't worry,..they are not happy either,...and all they tried to warn against, will soon prove to be true..it is now.|`|lUO6wLGAaa	No.  But I'm extremely proud of not voting for his predecessor, either time.  Or his father, for that matter.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	I felt that way for 8 years, and now I feel proud that I did vote for our current President.|`|yrDqtazLaa	I'm proud to know that more than half of America didn't fall for the same crap for the THIRD time in a row.|`|8zOdKD7Qaa	me I voted Mccain and proud of it|`|wdBY1fWaaa	You said it. Me too. I'm glad I'm not part of this marxist agenda. I was just hearing today how they are going after soft toilet paper as a contributor to global warming and destruction of the earth.<br>  <br>  What the hell are these no growth marxists talking about? Ok, I want to see them get serious about what they preach. Go outside, grab yourself a nice big piece of bark.....then use that next time you're in the toilet. Yeah, just save cutting the tree down all together. I want to see these libs practice what they preach. Bunch of morons.<br>  <br>  These people hate America, they hate progress and they will use any tactic they can (ie. environment) to pound their marxist agenda ideas into peoples heads. It's like they want this big utopia....you know, everyone walking to work in their burlap sack shirts (all natural) and growing our own food in our driveways, because we don't have cars anymore....not flushing the toilet to save water, so your house smells like crap, but hey you're saving the planet! Yeah, and not eating any beef because that causes global warming as well. We'll all just eat rice out of a bowl after we come in from working in the rice paddies all day shoulder to shoulder. Yep, sounds like North Korea huh? <br>  <br>  You think I'm joking but that's about what it's like.<br>  <br>  Added: Here is a concise summary of all the liberal answers on here - "Bush, eight years....bush....change....eight years...Obama." Yep, there you go.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Consider the options, I am definitely proud that I DID vote for the current President. <br>  <br>  In any case, do you REALLY think that America is going to "fall?" Shows how much faith you have in your country. And I thought that Republicans were supposed to be the "patriotic" ones. In any case, this begs another question: HOW do you think America is going to fall? Economically? Because the economy began to fall under Bush's watch, not Obama's. So how can you say you had nothing to do with it? Hmm...|`|riidLMeTaa	I don't agree with the America falling bit;  I prefer to think that the U.S. is self-correcting.  After these four years, more people will realize that the grass isn't always greener on the other side.  Bush wasn't a home-run as a prez, but he also wasn't as bad as most libs would have you believe.  Once America elects someone who isn't as far left or right as the current prez and his predecessor; or if you prefer: someone with some common sense (highly unlikely, most of those shy away from politics, but still), then this country will start making real progress.  Which, of course, will then in turn be undone by the next idiot elected.....|`|AztCTaQlaa	for all of you saying that you have 4 years of "I-told-you-so's" saved up I just wanna ask.... Do you think he will last that long? lol<br>  <br>  I say as much as I DIDN't vote for him he sure has alot of @#$ to wade through and he is trying... so I'm not saying i told you so but I'm just sitting back to see what he does and hope that @#$ doesn't rise up and get all over me (like most americans)|`|2OUDYHwoaa	What a joke he already has proven to be though it's not a funny joke. His total lack of leadership qualities is so obvious and embarrassing for our nation. His promises have been a lie and his idea of change has been exactly what we don't need|`|oLDeOuIWaa	Yup, he'll spend us out of a country pretty soon. You'll start to see states secede because they can't keep up with the federal mandates and taxes. This is the end of the United States.|`|7o3DMzXQaa	"but when America falls, we can truly say with pride that we had nothing to do with it"<br>  <br>  i think you are getting ahead of yourself|`|6QOKsVaPaa	Yep I am, I pat myself on the back every morning then turn the TV on and cry when I see my stock crashing.

He's obviously on something, probably crack.<br>  <br>  The dems, as part of their vile smear tactics, used to constantly spread rumors about drug use by Bush.  It was all lies of course.  But here we have Obama showing up in public, on camera, looking like some crackhead being busted on cops.

cfcuBxdsaa	if you have already filed the defamation of character lawsuit have your attorney introduce it into court along with the custody battle if the defamation suit has not been filed and assigned a court document or case number then you have to wait for a seperate hearing on the case.|`|1021f7b7dd4b55793a7f4d6f9e547c85aa	The short answer is, in MOST cases, you can sue almost anyone for almost anything at almost any time. Winning the lawsuit is a different matter. The only way to determine how substancial your case is would be to know and investigate all the facts and accusations in the case. Best thing to do is contact a reputable attorney for a consultation.|`|f4ef0b3a83cc1af75c8cb10f391cb5c9aa	Think of your child and quit attacking each other. <br>  <br>  Not all sex offenders are child molesters.

SIKuOevVaa	We should keep all Republicans out of the White House until they admit the following:<br>  <br>  1. You cannot govern a nation of over 300 million with "small government."<br>  <br>  2. If a free society will not help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.  (JFK, 1/20/1961 and still true today)<br>  <br>  3. You don't have to agree with a woman's choice, but you damn well better respect her right to make it.  You wouldn't let someone tell your wife whether to have a child, so why should you tell anyone else?<br>  <br>  4. There is no provision for a high-speed rail line from Las Vegas to Disneyland in the Obama stimulus plan, and there never was.  Stop lying about it!<br>  <br>  5. The Republican plan on, well, everything these days is obstruction.  You guys have no plans on, well, anything, so don't say you do, because you're lying -- again!<br>  <br>  6. A Republican criticizing the federal government's response to Hurricane Katrina is like Alex Rodriguez criticizing another player for steroid use.  Pardon the pun, but it doesn't hold water.<br>  <br>  7. You guys were kicked out of office not because you "betrayed your conservative principles," but because you held true to them.

t3QAaSN9aa	Democratic thinking is obviously not monolithic.  Byrd is a 91-year-old conservative Democrat from the old school.

It comes in handy!<br>  <br>  As for the Europeans, their situation is different.  They live where the countries are smaller and the neighboring countries have different languages.

Most Republicans are conservatives, and most Democrats are liberals. It's a common stereotype.<br>  <br>  Conservatives like things the way they are and like tradition.

The market started to become weak (after 6 boom years under conservative government I might add) very, very soon after the democrats won control of our government during the midterm elections.  But the real investor panic didn't start until Obama became a real possibility as our next president.  A bit of a rally when it seemed McCain might win...then BOOM, a 300 point gap down overnight when the election results came in, followed by a HUGE 700 point plunge.  Again, the market tried to rally around 8,000 on the off chance that Obama was only kidding about what he planned for our economy and might just sit on his hands a bit.  Then he passed his 1 trillion dollar stimu-waste free money for crack heads bill.  BOOM....another 1000 point crash in the stock market.  Up to that point, there had been real talk that the market had bottomed out....which is a sign that a recession is about halfway done.  And our economy is strong and would recover, except for the efforts of one man....Barack Obama.<br>  <br>  Last night, he put forth another half trillion dollars of extreme waste....on proven failures....alternative energy that doesn't work, never worked and never will work....when we need OIL, free healthcare for illegal aliens (whom he plans to offer amnesty to soon), and more money to education.....as if the US doesn't spend 20 times what every other westernized country spends on that already.  Any guess what the market will do?<br>  <br>  Wake up!  The real world consequences are that YOU will likely be, and remain, unemployed and have a very good chance of becoming a homeless person out on the street.

Charges will be filled by the District Attorney and you will receive notice when to come to court to testify. If you call your police department, they can tell you what he was charged with. Don't worry about what he is telling people, your testimony, the police testimony, and the evidence (pictures) will speak for itself in court if it goes to trial.|`|0a3a0d81fa8d7a297abb8625fa7800beaa	You need to contact your local District Attorney's Office to see if in fact he was arrested. <br>  <br>  It sounds like your state complies with the same laws as my own on Domestic Violence arrests...but it never hurts to make sure!<br>  <br>  Your DA's office should have a D/V representative also who can help guide you through the process.<br>  <br>  The main issue to address first is to see if, for sure, he was arrested on your complaint!|`|2bW6Iks9aa	To press charges, if a police report was done, you need to call the prosecutors office and tell them you want to follow up with charges.  If your ex keeps doing things to you, you need to document everything.  Phone calls, emails, physical violence anything at all.  Never hesitate to call police when something happens.  When a report is done that does not mean that the prosecutor will automatically file charges you must follow up and let them know you wish to proceed with charges.  Good for you for standing up and reporting it. You are much stronger than a lot of people.|`|75NmeGKeaa	You don't need to press charges, you reported the assault, which falls under domestic violence. Your ex was arrested by the police upon establishing probable cause (your statements, the visible injuries). <br>  <br>  Your ex is charged by the prosecutor. In most jurisdictions, you do not have a choice as to if charges will be pressed or dropped. <br>  <br>  You may have to testify as to what happened in Court, depending on if the case goes to trial or if there is a plea of guilty.<br>  <br>  I would suggest also getting a Protection Order against your ex to help ensure this does not happen again.

In fact many scientific "FACTS" turn out to be frauds.<br>  <br>  The world is flat, Peltdown man, Eugenics, Global warming ( soon to be proved) science has a history of fraudulent "Scientist" who use hoaxes to prove their ingrained belief.<br>  <br>  Religion has had the same problems that is true but the facts are that religion doesnt base itself on hard facts it bases itself on faith.<br>  <br>  Many scientist in the last century have actually found religion instead of disproving it. The facts that there are many things in the universe that dont actually make alot of sense. <br>  <br>  Albert Einstien " God does not play dice"|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	Freeman Dyson, the famous British theoretical physicist, once said, <br>  <br>  "Science and religion are two windows that people look through, trying to understand the big universe outside, trying to understand why we are here. The two windows give different views, but they look out at the same universe. Both views are one-sided, neither is complete. Both leave out essential features of the real world. And both are worthy of respect.<br>  <br>  Trouble arises when either science or religion claims universal jurisdiction, when either religious or scientific dogma claims to be infallible. Religious creationists and scientific materialists are equally dogmatic and insensitive. By their arrogance they bring both science and religion into disrepute. The media exaggerate their numbers and importance. The media rarely mention the fact that the great majority of religious people belong to moderate denominations that treat science with respect, or the fact that the great majority of scientists treat religion with respect so long as religion does not claim jurisdiction over scientific questions."<br>  <br>  I tend to agree with that statement, rather than crudely worded insults such as your question.|`|sI3kqp7xaa	"Science can purify religion from error and superstition; religion can purify science from idolatry and false absolutes. Each can draw the other into a wider world, a world in which both can flourish‚Ä¶We need each other to be what we must be, what we are called to be."<br>     - Pope John Paul II<br>  <br>  Having science as your only "religion" is blind.|`|5PIgZ7tFaa	It will take a breakthrough in scientific brain research. My question is: why do voters keep reelecting the same brain-dead career politicians (of both parties) and expect things to improve?<br>   There's simpletons on both sides. It just seems that right-wingers need frauds like Rush Limbaugh to do their thinking for them. Guys like Limbaugh or Hannity only appreciate science when it supports their ideologies; which isn't very often. <br>     It falls to the people with inquiring minds to keep the uber-conservatives from running amok. Those clowns would stop the space shuttle flights because a spherical Earth makes no sense, and thus, orbital space flight is impossible around a flat pancake.<br>       At any rate, a lot of people want immediate and visible results, and that doesn't always happen with science. If they're going to fund something, a lot of conservatives want to see a weapon come out of the research. That's why Reagan cancelled the Superconducting Supercollider; there was no guarantee that the scientists could blow the Russkies to kingdom come.<br>     Education and science always take a back seat to the military.<br>  <br>      Just my thoughts...|`|1AgD0dsBaa	There are many ways to examine your question. 3 come to my mind. <br>  <br>  First the Ultra-conservative is not always a religious person. There are many Conservatives who also believe in the needs for science. Science is an essential in our society. Science gives answers in many ways from ancient history to modern medical break throughs. So I would not consider that all Ultra-Conservatives are closed to Science. You may quote it to the ultra-religous. IE- Generally people who belong to the Church of Scientology would follow this model you are proposing. <br>  <br>  Second, that also depends on what group of religious people your are talking about. Buddhist, Taoist, Christians, Muslims. Hindu's, the list goes on. Religion gives society structure and is very cultural for old cultures. So persecution of someone who has a strong spiritual belief should be respected as your opinion should also. <br>  <br>  Third and finally, science is vast and exploratory, their are many different applications that can find us answers and some-times it can't find us the answers. Faith in something is not a bad thing to have. I believe your question implies the rhetorical idea that those who have faith are weak? or people of faith are blind? In some cases this can be true, but there are many scholars out there who are very open minded. So both work hand and hand. It provides a foundation for those who seek truth, wether it be in the spiritual side, or on the factual side. Both Spiritual faith and Science are good. Not one or the other is really evil. <br>  <br>  Its extremist that make it hard to work with, that's all.|`|hilEWrDYaa	You let me know when scientists finally make up their mind if a glass of red wine per day is good or bad for my health, then get back to me.

You apparently conflate "racism" and "fascism" with a refusal to debate.  You mention "fascist and undemocratic tendencies" separately.  However, one wonders whether they are the same thing to you.<br>  <br>  It is one thing to criticize a refusal to debate - I might join you there.  But if you're going to debate, you would do better to at least know the terminology that is central to the debate.  Look up "fascist" and you will find a deeper meaning than what you seem to attach here.<br>  <br>  More generally, and on your last question, I don't know that "hypocritical" is the right term.

He knows he sounds incoherent and awful without a teleprompter, so that probably helps him, but no, I don't think he writes his own speeches because he doesn't know enough about issues, especially national defense issues, and Iraq and Afghanistan, to be drafting his own speeches.|`|5eUdOI1Baa	I'm not really sure because I thought it was widely understood that Jon Favreau writes his speeches for him.|`|otYOxmnuaa	Because they all have the same component -- they say a lot w/o saying a thing.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	Because he probably has a lot of input in to them.

That was 9 months after he took office.  Now, Obama has been in office one month and the conservatives are saying the economy belongs to him.  Well, if that is the case then Bush owns 9/11 lock stock and barrel.  Bush let 9/11 happen.  He did not protect this country from the terrorist.  Obama hasn't been in office long enough for any of his plans to take hold yet.  I'm willing to bet by the end of the year, after Obama's policies are allowed to work, we will be getting out of this recession and the stock market will take off, upwards and onwards.  There will be no help from the conservatives.  Then they will probably want people to believe they had something to do with the recovery.|`|BQ4M9ODnaa	This is the Obama Recession.<br>  <br>  One Term Barry owns it, and has owned it since January 20, 2009.<br>  <br>  Since Jan 16 the last business day of the Bush presidency, until last Monday 2/23, the Dow Jones stock average has dropped 16 percent.<br>  <br>  THE MARKET DROPPED 16 PERCENT on Barry's watch.<br>  <br>  I have not checked how much more it dropped this week but I know the market is down.|`|3c4f882068fe82ffb0aabccdbc8d106aaa	Greed and corruption by both the corporations and citizens both share an equal blame in this mess.

Every new Presidential Year their has always been a surge.  But back in Oct.08 when people figured Obama could actually get elected it has been downhill.  That is a clue to the clueless that most economist and business people are not going to risk their money because they do not believe in Pres. Obama.  Why you knuckleheads blame Bush is beyond me, He wanted more over sight and warned the DEMOCRAT Congress that FM&FM needed more oversight.  No one listened so we have the housing market of America destroying the entire world's economy.  The money Bush spent on the Iraq war is penitence to what Obama has already spent in less than 2 months.|`|mBt5VgtHaa	Great! I hope the market drops another 17%. Those stocks are overvalued.

Consider this:<br>  <br>  93 percent of the Republican delegates are white (up from 85% in 2004)<br>  68 percent are male (up from 57% in 2000)<br>  Of the 247 members of the congressional Republican caucus, none are African-American and just five are Hispanic.<br>  In the previous election (Bush vs. Kerry) - Bush received 70% of the white male vote.<br>  <br>  Those who voted democrat for this election were overwhelmingly female, minority, and young (35 and under).  Other demographics (those with the most money, highly educations and so forth) favored democrats.<br>  <br>  It is no secret that the republican party is basically a white party.  One look at the delgates or the audiences at the conventions say that.  The republican leadership themselves recognize that.  Jindal and Steele are the exceptions to the rule.  If you are a minority and a republican, you are an exception to the rule.<br>  <br>  It seems to me that many of the white republicans that I've spoken to take offense when this is pointed out.  I think it is because they think that when people point this out, they are calling them racist.  I don't believe that, but I do think that many of them tolerate overtly racist elements and sentiments in their own party without complaint.  Many are more than willing to accept racism as long as the republican party remains pro-life and pro-gun.  But they have no idea what it is to be actively denigrated.  Or, what it feels like as a black person to hear "Barack the Magic *****" and know that it was sent around as a joke.  Or, what it feels like as a hispanic person to hear people say such negative things about immigrants from Mexico (which is why so many hispanics left the republican party).  Or what it feels like to look at a convention where there is no one of color and have the speaker say "this is the REAL america." (I'm paraphrasing here.)  <br>  <br>  I do think there is a small, but somewhat sizeable group of republicans who really don't care - who feel that the republican party is the white party - and they don't want it to change - they want to turn the clock back in America.  I think that the rest of the republicans know that they can't win without this group and they don't want to alienate them.<br>  <br>  But, I don't think that many of the republicans who are not in leadership realize that times have changed.  It isn't just the election of Obama.  And it isn't only the demographic shift (more minorities, less whites).  It is in the hearts of people.  You can't take it for granted that every white person is going to immediately vote for the white candidate.  Nor can you take it for granted that blacks will always vote for the black candidate.  (Remember, in the very beginning, Hilary Clinton had a significant portion of the black vote - and if it weren't for Iowa, we'd probably be looking at President Clinton right now.)  While I personally don't believe that republicans will lose every election from here forward - I can see some major victories in the near future - mostly in reaction to the democrat victories.  But, I do foresee that it will be harder and harder - particularly if they keep alienating everyone who is not white, christian, straight, and conservative.  That knocks out a lot of people.  The leadership sees this and wants to change and I think they are trying to do it quickly and on the surface - but they don't seem to be willing to do the deep work needed to really make a change in the party.  I think that if they do that, they'll alienate those who really are racist.  But without getting the people on board at a very deep level, the changes will not take root.  I just don't think that the people are willing to do that.

I think we should use the money China lends us to pay for the rocket damage, that came from Gaza, in Israel.|`|ipWRgKetaa	No, I don't. Because that money will go straight to Hamas who will, in turn, use it to line their pockets and buy more weapons to attack Israel. <br>  <br>  And by the way, Israel didn't cause those attacks, Palestine did. Sort of a 'We'll lob rockets and mortar on your towns during a cease fire' sort of thing going on over there. But you can feel free to ignore that.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	No. It is a humanitarian message....and I think it is Obama's way of trying to convince the world that the U.S. is still a power...and also trying to convince American Jews that he has not forgotten Israel...while at the same time babying the Palestinians.<br>  <br>  Obama's tendency to cater to all points of view is unsettling to me. I would rather he take a stand and leave it at that rather than to try to please everyone. That would be transparency.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	HAMAS thanks you!<br>  <br>  Better rockets!<br>  <br>  More bang for the Buck!|`|m3jb9qjdaa	no more than we should be paying for all these non-working lazy liberals to sit at home and watch oprah all day long.<br>  <br>  You don't pay for me puddle of crud.

Did you marry him to help him get a green card or did he deceive you for this reason? If so, don't help him cause that's considered a fraud and you can get jail time for it. <br>  <br>  If you feel that your marriage was genuine, you can write a letter because it is true that both of you entered the marriage in good faith.  <br>  <br>  I don't wanna be negative but it might happen that he makes up a story just to get you to write a convincing letter. It sounds like you don't really know this person...if you really don't, don't do it.<br>  <br>  If this guy marries his girlfriend, he can get another green card based on his marriage to the other lady if she is a US citizen. That's also a possibility.

California like most of the Country is experiencing growing unemployment.  There is a flip side like the State of Florida that has no State income tax but incredibly high property taxes.  When you loose your job in Florida, you still have to pay some of the highest property taxes in the nation.  Well, until you can't pay them any longer and than it's just another foreclosure bringing down the prices in the hood.

There have already been cases of armed incursion into our territory by those transporting drugs.  For those of us who live in border cities this is a real concern.  There have been many drug related killings in Tijuana,  and for those of us who live in the San Diego area, that's close enough for concern.  <br>  <br>  Another concern is the perception of rights.  Do you believe that your rights are inherent, and not bestowed upon you by the government, or that your rights are granted by the government?  If you believe the latter then you have made yourself a subject of the government, and not a free citizen to which the government must be accountable.   The Second amendment does not grant us the right to bear arms.  The founding fathers considered the right to bear arms to be an inalienable right, and put the second amendment there as a reminder to future generations, and to ensure that it wasn't infringed upon.|`|REiQzRB3aa	The funny thing is, they blame gun shows here in the U.S. for fully-automatic weapons being used in drug related activity, which cannot even be purchased unless you have a class III firearms license.

What incentive do federal politicians have to actually decrease the violence?  Large scale problems such as this increase their prestige since it generally becomes accepted that they must provide a solution.

6Gfz125Paa	The main constitutional argument for gay marriage is based on the equal protection clause, which says that the government cannot discriminate on gender (among other things) unless there is a rational basis.  This was the same argument used in Loving v. Virginia which was about interracial marriage, and has been used to strike down gay marriage bans in 3 states.|`|FDVuAiHOaa	Well, the US Constitution should not be involved - this is a states' matter only.<br>  <br>  I think it is a violation of civil liberties based on discrimination, constitutionally speaking.|`|TpdVba4baa	Marriage is obviously not defined in the Constitution, which is why there have been proposed amendments about defining it. I for one am all for civil rights, and am glad that we are coming closer to equality. But you have to draw the line somewhere. Gay marriage goes against the principles this nation was founded upon. What I mean when I say draw the line is that the issue of Civil Rights has gone too far. Gays will soon be having their own civil rights movement, and while many will tell me it doesn't affect my life, I still dread the day that this immorality is made legal.|`|lTx8Hoheaa	There is none<br>  <br>  "The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. <br>  <br>  One's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections."<br>  <br>  Supreme Court, West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 1943|`|YCL50xgnaa	The constitution protects minorities from the tyranny of the majority.

In the minds of the writers of the Constitution, both are laughable and would never happen.  That is why they never specified what constituted marriage.  If someone suggested two men or two women wanting to marry they would have laughed and laughed, or had the person who suggested it committed to an insane asylum.  The writers didn't include laws prohibiting ridiculous things because they didn't foresee people attempting ridiculous things Now people are trying to shove buffaloes down rabbit's throats and saying that it's normal.|`|fsEr4x6oaa	marriage is defined as a union between an man and a woman. That is why gay marriage will not pass. The definition. I guess if the gay people keep putting down the people that have a different view than them then they will get their way. We can always change our values to accommodate the minority. ie. abortion...|`|lhJ6Gv53aa	no plain and simple!|`|LVPpeUwkaa	Religion is not a place to hide,<br>  The Constitution is no place to hide.<br>  Democracy is often in conflict with itself-both equality and individual liberty are important democratic principles, but they may conflict with each other. For example, equality tends to favor majority rule, but equality threatens individual liberty in situations where the majority may want to deprive the minority of its rights.<br>  <br>  The children of Adam are limbs of one body<br>  Having been created of one essence.<br>  When the calamity of time afflicts one limb<br>  The other limbs cannot remain at rest.<br>  If you have no sympathy for the troubles of others<br>  You are not worthy to be called by the name of "man."<br>  <br>  There is no compelling reason why same-sex couples should be excluded from the institution of marriage and its benefits.  A comparison of the features of successful same-sex and opposite-sex relationships is unlikely to reveal any differences which justify the restriction of the marital status to heterosexual couples.  The factors contributing to successful heterosexual relationships apply equally to homosexual relationships.  Love, trust and commitment are integral to the success of both types of relationship. <br>  <br>  Also, the contention that marriage has always been viewed as  a heterosexual institution is itself false.  Same-sex marriages have occurred with relative frequency in the past, both  within Christian and non-Christian communities.[14]   Those who claim that same-sex marriage violates religious ideals will be surprised to learn that the Catholic Church, which has been extremely vociferous in its opposition to homosexuality in general, approved of same-sex marriages for over 1 500 years, only ceasing to perform them in the nineteenth century.[15]  Throughout its history the Catholic Church developed over one hundred liturgies for same-sex marriage,[16]  at least one of which still remains on the official syllabus of approved ceremonies.[17]   As procreation within the marriage union was not possible, the ceremonies emphasised the companionship of the couple rather than the procreative aspects of the relationship.[18]  In the face of such evidence, any assertion that same-sex marriage offends religious values cannot be sustained.

You could always volunteer for a deployment before your next PT test and get in shape overseas.|`|3380c837a43038d78b48114287ccf919aa	They're bluffing. They could discharge you, but won't. The guard needs people too badly. I haven't seen it happen in my 6 years with the guard regardless of how fat the soldier was or how many times they failed. Retention is more important. Sounds bad, but that's a fact. It isn't dishonorable if they did discharge you though.|`|0suKUsrwaa	I really doubt that they will discharge you for that. I have a boyfriend who's in the National Guard and he has taken his PT test about 5 times now and failed everyone of them. His Sergeants are helping him by running along with him and training him every once in a while. So if your Sergeants really care then they won't just kick you out without at least trying to help. But just in case they do discharge you that WILL NOT be a dishonorable discharge. It will be general with honorable status.

AA11206283	Nope.<br>  In California, wages, with some exceptions (see table below), must be paid at least twice during each calendar month on the days designated in advance as regular paydays. The employer must establish a regular payday and is required to post a notice that shows the day, time and location of payment. Labor Code Section 207 Wages earned between the 1st and 15th days, inclusive, of any calendar month must be paid no later than the 26th day of the month during which the labor was performed, and wages earned between the 16th and last day of the month must be paid by the 10th day of the following month. Other payroll periods such as weekly, biweekly (every two weeks) or semimonthly (twice per month) when the earning period is something other than between the 1st and 15th, and 16th and last day of the month, must be paid within seven calendar days of the end of the payroll period within which the wages were earned. Labor Code Section 204|`|48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	One additional applicable rule is that if the law requires any act to be done within a certain time period, and the last day falls on a weekend or holiday, then the time for performing that act is extended to the next day which is not a holiday.  (Code Civ. Proc. sec. 12a.)|`|AA11162709	The woman there is correct. It is called constructive receipt. It means that if payday is the 15th then the paycheck must be made available by the 15th.

T8nap2Pnaa	Well, depending on when the graduation ceremony is, it may already be too late. But maybe not. According to the information on the State Department website at travel.state.gov, it currently take 17 days to get a visa appointment in Manila. Then, if you are approved, another 3 days for processing, meaning printing up the visa and getting it back to you.  So, if you applied today, it would take 3 weeks to get a visa, if you are approved. Check out the information on the embassy website on how to apply: <a href="http://manila.usembassy.gov/wwwhniv1.html" rel="nofollow">http://manila.usembassy.gov/wwwhniv1.htm...</a><br>  <br>  Since US immigration law regards all visa applicants as intending immigrants until they prove otherwise, it may be difficult for a 19 year old to get a tourist visa. You, and your mother, are required to show strong social and economic ties to the Philippines that would bring you back after a short trip to the US.  If you've traveled outside of the Philippines before, that would help. But it can certainly be difficult for a young unmarried woman to show strong ties. If you have time, you could try to get a letter from your brother's command supporting your effort to attend. At least that would show the interviewing officer that this is a real event. However, letters of support will not usually be sufficient to sway the interviewing officer, if he is convinced that you won't return.

4d09752df09a2ec257796ec20d7c524eaa	I think that the founders of america would be in agreement that in time of terror one has to give up certain freedoms because it helps accomplish the greater good. The greater good being protecting others. Flying is a pleasure, not a right. If I must wait, I wait. If I am shady and the Gov. taps my phone, it's for the greater good. If I have nothing to hide I am fine, if I am a bad guy, others are saved from harm. The Bill of Rights and the Constitution are not documents that allow us to committ suicide. Thomas Jefferson would want us to be protected as a free society instead of letting bad guys have the same rights as good guys. The only way to find the bad guys are for the good guys to give a little.|`|8ea80947ebbeca6e927152810bb81c64aa	It is important that for us who have freedom to observe the basic human right of equal treatment and punishment. Just because those who choose extrimism disregard these principles, it does not give us the right to treat them the same way they treat us. Most of these people are extrimist because of their consequential background that they are taught of one thing and that one believe is twisted in the hand of a mad man. <br>  <br>  For example, many of our service member that was caught by them were tortured and killed, this does not gives us the right to do the same, because if you think about it, they are doing the same to their own people, by killing their own neighbors that are off a different believe even though they believe in the same religion and God. <br>  <br>  Think about it, what if those Sunni Muslim and Shia Muslim that are killing each other were Christians? How many different Christian believes are there in this world? There's the Catholics, Protestants, Mormons, Lutherans, Baptist, Pentecostals, and Jehovah's Witness to mention a few. Say for instance all these different denominations are saying that one of them is the right and correct way to worship God and all else is fraud and should be terminated. <br>  <br>  That is what is going on in the Muslim world. Terrorism is just another way for the to express that they should be heard in a wrong way. <br>  <br>  Protecting human rights is easier said than done, for many of us have emotions that is stirred by media who are bias in their opinions. It only takes one to show compassion and forgiveness and passing it along that one can achieve the goal to preserve and protect human rights while countering terrorism anywhere in the world.

tAmzvFdVaa	Welcome to felon world, 2008!   when I was seeking employment, nobody would hire me and I became very frustrated.  then I found out about a place ran by the county.  Ours is called the Business Workforce Center.  They had a list of employers that would hire felons.  I don't know if this is in every county, but you can check with the unemployment bureau for your state.  Other than that, I know painters, construction workers, and masons usually hire off the street.

All three have adopted the philosophy of repeating the great lie enough so that the masses will believe it; a philosophy ripped directly from Mein Kampf.|`|pOjL5dWeaa	investors.com, Rush, Hannity, Herritage.org, and thousands of internet sights including y/answers! <br>  <br>  The media that you are talking about is ABC, CBS and NBC, together with hundreds of newspapers and magazines whose news is worthless to listen to! |`|16bfd4d38e8341b3f96f18af75d3b484aa	We get our information from radio and from places like Fox News.  There are also a few newspapers that don't lean to the left.  There are also a lot of great conservative books.  <br>  Oh-- almost forgot Glen Beck, the only worthwhile show on CNN.|`|Tts9ID4oaa	You are incorrect.  We don't claim all the media has left wing bias, only the MAINSTREAM media is overwhelmingly liberal...a fact even the mainstream media agrees with.|`|AA10071482	Conservatives get their news from Ann"I'M rally A Man Coulter & Rush LimpBalls.

Fox News has many and  Glen Beck on CNN.|`|FPSiozgwaa	Fox news is the most notoriously biased news source out there.

Like the website of Hugo Chavez has this to say about someone who hired Obama to lead his multimillion dollar organization for 3 years.<br>  <br>  "Bill Ayers was the leader of the revolutionary group and anti-imperialist The Weather Underground which led the armed struggle of the U.S. government for over 10 years from inside the bowels of the empire."<br>  <br>  Bill Ayers is an advisor to Hugo Chavez.|`|tP8W6Q1Qaa	I wake up and pull it straight from my bum.<br>  <br>  <br>  clever question tho - two points - but seriously, there are tons of smaller news and foreign news stations. Witnessing first hand and don't forget AM radio. |`|SWkaGJpgaa	We get our info from all the same sources. It's just that we aren't simpletons who see no bias in the reporting. Ultimately, even leftists have to base their reporting on some fact. We see the fact, and we ignore the obvious bias in how it is reported.<br>  <br>  You can claim that the media isn't biased, but that's not what the facts say. Study after study has shown that most newsrooms have more self-identified liberals / Democrats than conservatives / Republicans, often by significant margins. If you don't think that leads to an unconscious bias in the reporting, you don't know a thing about human nature.<br>  <br>  Bernard Goldberg's book "Bias" was about this unconscious liberal bias in the newsroom, and how he, as a liberal, finally was able to see it for what it was.<br>  <br>  So, basically, you need to learn to discern fact from opinion, and learn to recognize bias when it occurs.<br>  <br>  I'm under no illusions that reporting on Fox isn't biased to the right, why are you deluding yourself about the rest of the media? Because they're all biased.|`|XxSj6AsBaa	Your question is fundamentally flawed in the way it is stated.  Not all media is liberal, just the overwhelming majority of it fails to report unbiased news.  There are still media outlets that just report facts, which BTW is what they are SUPPOSED to do.  Relying on CBS, NBC, ABC is no better than getting your news from Pravda.  To answer your question therefore, Republicans do not have it both ways, they are simply better at discerning where to get news from.|`|9eBruYtqaa	i don't know about anyone else, but i watch bbc america for my news. i get the washington post for my newspaper. i have gotten information on both candidates from their websites and votesmart.org|`|wc8SebFgaa	I'll have to say that cnn and msnbc  are the most bias<br>  I do listen to fox occasionally<br>  they seem to do a better job of reporting down the middle <br>  maybe a little to the right though--maybe|`|ppQ8lqKeaa	These people, who, by the way, are not what I would call "conservative," but are Republican loyalists, tend to listen to pundits, not journalists. The pundits figure out for them what's going on, and tell them what to think. <br>  <br>  This is partly due to the disinformation techniques of the Bush era, partly due to the fact that everybody's circuits shorted out during 9/11, and partly  because certain people are intellectually lazy, and dismissing the "liberal" news media makes them feel superior, in some way. <br>  <br>  The "liberal" media organizations are, of course, all under the control of giant corporations, and not particularly liberal. <br>  <br>  But the owners, managers, editors and reporters of these outlets, who are educated and fundamentally decent, have had more than enough of Bush admin lies, are tearing into McCain and Palin, and doing it with nothing more than the facts at hand.  <br>  <br>  They should. That's their job and their proper function. |`|IzHfbWtiaa	Can't have it your way either! Conservatives get their info from Fox News the fair & balanced news network!

To have a realistic chance, McCain needs to win 90% of the undecided voters.  I just don't see that happening.<br>  <br>  As far a Palin is concerned, I think the excitement and sheen surrounding her has faded, and we're left with a likable, but not all that knowledgeable, politician.|`|el8yX5q3aa	YES SHE DOES!  Holy cow...she is strong and runs a state etc.  What are you talking about.?  Her state has THRIVED and PROSPERED under her.....<br>  <br>  But now Obama is talking about giving money to people who don't pay taxes...(where is this money coming from?????).......so you can pay anyone to vote for you.  People are used to standing around with their hands out and taking credit and money and everything that is given to them...whether they deserve it or can afford it NOW...so why wouldn't they continue their own character assassination of themselves and take money to vote for HIM?<br>  <br>  |`|I7sS4w0maa	Not an Alaskan Snowballs chance in Arizona<br>  <br>  To the ones who say he has a GREAT chance of WINNING<br>  <br>  Here is the Latest Poll<br>  <br>  Electoral Votes 344 Obama<br>  Electoral Votes 167 Down From 175 Yesterday McCain<br>  Electoral Votes 207 To WIN the PRESIDENCY<br>  <br>  Still think he has a Chance??|`|X43O3JdMaa	maybe...... but i want Obama to win|`|AA10910418	  It ain't over until the fat lady sings. Democrats<br>   have already tried to register more people in<br>   some counties than the population....that tells<br>   us something is wrong here. If Obama will<br>   produce his birth certificate, we'll then know for<br>   sure if he can legally run for president. Some<br>   say he was born in Kenya (even his relative<br>   told that). If true, he can't be president here.<br>   And, I really like Sarah Palin.

Its like a bush clone|`|5hxWSezPaa	I love it!  "Slight" - talk about overconfidence!!  HA!  <br>  McCain has a great chance at winning.  Obama has his candidacy riding on failure - economic failure and military failure.  The war is not much of an issue anymore for Obama to talk about since even he admitted that the surge he opposed worked.  And, as for the points he picked up in the last two weeks of stock market turmoil, they are fading fast after the record rally of 936 points today.  |`|91DpXQ88aa	the race card is his ace in the hole this country will never elect a colored president|`|JiMG2iYjaa	Yes, I hope he does win the election.  His VP is not just a hockey mom, HELLO she is Gov. of Alaska how much leadership do you need.

He articulated a whole bunch of other reasons to support Obama that didn't haven't anything to do with race.<br>  <br>  I think you're the one who is playing the race card because you assume that the only possible reason Powell could be endorsing Obama is his race.

Why work and better your life when you can sit around collecting a fat government check every week?<br>  <br>  The people who own businesses won't be recipients of redistributed wealth.

You think that he's going to take money from the filthy rich.  Believe me, those who have obscene amounts of money won't lose a dime under Obama.  They know how to survive.  <br>  <br>  So you think everyone is going to open up their own business if all they can make a year is $250,000?  We don't even know if this is gross or net.  Can your business have employees?  If it does, that 250k is very easy to hit.  Disposable incomes--I can't wait until you see what you get with this guy.  I am so happy I moved to the hills of Appalachia and stayed little enough that even Obama won't tax me so much.

If those taxes are raised he will do even LESS.  and that's sad.  They need their money as much as we do.   He deserves to be rewarded for his hard work.

This market seems to succeed as long as energy prices rise and we find out more info about the environment. <br>  <br>  So this, along with the markets we do need to succeed, will not only slow in growth, but they will raise lees of the necessary capital to grow, and e will end up with no sectors in the market growing.<br>  <br>  This leads us to the second problem: One of the [many] causes of this current market failure are the facts that there are (or were) too many incentives to borrow money, as opposed to saving and investing. <br>  <br>  Now if over borrowing on behalf of the consumer is the problem, then why would we invest our savings in a declining market? <br>  <br>  To reap the rewards of huge capital gains!<br>  Oh wait, the gov is going to raise taxes on that.<br>  <br>  So we end up in this rut where Wall St. needs capital and the government adds one more dissincentive to invest.|`|rpajoT0raa	lol<br>  good point!<br>  Maybe introduce a retrospective "greed tax" based on previous gains, and residual wealth, that contributed to the current disaster.

I'm sure that will be a profitable buisness in the following years.|`|INJSpV4haa	If no one is going to have any capital gains in the next few years, then what are you harping on about?<br>  <br>  Regardless of who wins, the next president is going to have to raise taxes. One will raise taxes on the middle class. The other will raise taxes on the very wealthy and on corporations.<br>  <br>  You all decide which plan suits you best.|`|412f5c4577c7348963b5d87096943298aa	Doesn't matter. Capital gains taxes right now are ridiculously low. A raise won't mean that much to the types of investors that will be affected. Paying 25% instead of 15% for investors making $500,000 a year won't cripple them.|`|FGWEHVZ9aa	Its better the capital gains that no gains at all lets work this problem together Remember Together We Stand Divided we Fall<br>  help this country reverse directions vote wise<br>  Obama/Biden 08|`|MiB5fhePaa	Apparently you've forgotten the difference between realizing a gain and recognizing a gain.|`|sNWQ3qTFaa	The way the economy is right now, there won't be any capital gains<br>  <br>  <br>  McCain Palin<br>  Before its too late|`|B3H034Vtaa	We have no worry here, no one will be making any capital gains.|`|k6TjuQRdaa	LMAO!!!! as if anyone will have the chance too!<br>  <br>  |`|Kpx66Bmdaa	Even if we will not see any real gains in perhaps the next few years, people will get slammed when the market does break. This defeats the purpose of buying a home or business, and I for one will not invest if I have to pay exorbitant taxes to support Obamas pork and earmarks. Taxes in turn bring down the real estate values, so if it's going to bring down your property value why would anyone invest in the first place? Not only does it lower property values, property taxes also go up. I moved to a democrat controlled state and my property taxes went UP an ADDITIONAL $400/yr...what an idiot I was. Not only did my property taxes go up, I paid more capital gains here on a house that is 25 yrs. old over a home that was brand new when I first bought a home.<br>  My previous residence was in....Arizona (McCain country), my current reresidence is in....Colorado. So, if people think  it's going to be better under Obamas taxes and the democrats... you better think again.<br>  EDIT: if you plan on flipping any of those foreclosures in the future, under Obama and the democrats you can expect to get slammed with exorbitant capital gains taxes, which defeats the purpose if you're paying more tax and decrease your return. Come on people, wise up.|`|NQMdIYkCaa	The Democrats, bringing us to our knees since 1976.

This is the case with all services.  <br>  <br>  The one exception to this is the Army's Warrior Transition Course -- it is a 4 week program to teach former Sailors and former Airmen the Army way of doing things -- but it assumes you have completed a full tour and were fully trained in your previous service.<br>  <br>  (Don't believe the crap Justin M is feeding you former Marines joining the Army in a Combat Arms MOS will go through basic again -- former members of other services who were fully trained just do a short refresher course and then on to AIT, nobody of any service has to repeat basic.)|`|tJjOfBtYaa	i think so since he will be going into the air force, but talk to a air force recruiter and he will be able to tell you for sure |`|i3DF8dLeaa	yes..if you go thru marine corps boot camp then you dont have to go thru again when joining another service...but since he is prior service the air force probably isnt gonna take him, due to the fact that they are over staffed and payin ppl to leave or go to the army...|`|mxiNAKPbaa	yh
AA11494150	No, a speeding ticket will not disqualify you.|`|f9No4eRBaa	Everyone speeds!  No, it should not prevent you from becoming a nurse. Make sure the fine is immediately paid.|`|9Uc7gYjIaa	The best thing to do is call the place where you need to get your license to nurse. They would be the number one source to ask just to be on the safe side. Though it would seem silly if they said no since nurses are in such demand. You might however ask the courts (where your ticket came from) if they will allow you to take a traffic school class. If so that would help you to avoid your insurance going up and a point on your license. I just took a court approved On Line traffic school class with <a href="http://www.TicketRelief.com.Very" rel="nofollow">http://www.TicketRelief.com.Very</a> fast and cheap. Just make sure the courts give you the green light to take the class and it's court approved. |`|mNsl9GG9aa	Yes, Virginia is very strict on speeding tickets.  No, getting a speeding ticket absolutely will not keep you from getting a nursing license.  Just make sure you pay the ticket on time so you don't get a bench warrant.  Either way, it still won't keep you from being a nurse.  They look for felony charges.|`|ub81CyeLaa	how about we state the question this way, "How/Why would a speeding ticket prevent me from becoming a nurse?"

It basically a test to show what jobs are available to you and what bonuses may be offered according to the scores. Only until you  physically swear in are you considered in the military. I would think after he swears in they most likely would want him asap unless theres a possibility that he may request to leave on a specific date. I joined the army when i was a junior in high school and they had me leave for basic 3 weeks after graduating high school.hope this helps and good luck|`|UCNPFSw8aa	It depends on what branch he wants to join and what his MOS/AFSC or rate is. <br>  <br>  Edit: Well, Security Forces is an AFSC that is undermanned at the moment, so his chances of leaving pretty soon are pretty good.|`|9ujZijBPaa	It could be a week.

mlDV1Xsqaa	Well, it varies, but I will give you an example of my schedule. We never usually work the same number of days in a row. We usually have one month of days, or two weeks of days, then one month or two weeks of nights. During seasons that are not busy or days that are not busy we work 8 hour shifts, during the pretty busy seasons we work 10 hour shifts, and when we are very busy we work 12 hour shifts. However, these can turn into much longer shifts, as a lot of us seem to get the worst calls towards the end of a shift. Be prepared to have to unexpectedly stay late, and maybe even come in on some of your days off to do paperwork. <br>  Hope this helps, and good luck!|`|ftELrRJraa	Various, 5 on 2 off 8 hours, 4 on 3 off 10 hours, 3 on 3 off 12 hours, 4 on 4 off 12 hours. 3 on 4 off 12.5 hours.  I have seen and worked them all in the past 28 years.   I like the 12's the best.  Its the shift rotation from days to nights and back to days that is the hard part. |`|8567eea50ee05006e45298c8a269c261aa	Depends on the agency.  We work eight hour shifts.  We rotate (days, afternoons, midnights) every 28 days.<br>  <br>  As the new officer, expect the worst shifts with the last pick for vacation days and days off.|`|JU3OwbD5aa	It varies between departments.  The department I plan on applying to does something like 5 days on at 10 hours a day, then 4 days off.|`|nlQLzJljaa	Either 4 days of 10 hr shifts and 3 days off or 5 days of 8 hrs and 2 days off|`|FNAbmZGOaa	Depends the town. Also, new officers get their shifts switched a lot but as you become more veteran in the department you most likely will have the same shift everyday so you don't have to change your sleeping habits anymore. In my town in New Jersey this is how shifts go.<br>  <br>  Work 4 days then the next 4 days off, and so on.<br>  <br>  6am-5pm<br>  3pm-2am<br>  8pm-7am<br>  Each with a half hour break.|`|21Ls5XFPaa	Depends on the agencies.  When If first started, we worked the same shifts 30 days at a time,  The we went to rotating every week.  Other depts work permanent shifts.  Check where you want to apply and see if it is something you can live with.  I will say, rotating shifts are difficult for a family man.|`|AA11494150	That will be determined by the department. In addition, some departments rotate you from midnights to afternoon to days, other departments post shifts by seniority. Days get picked first, followed by midnights, and afternoons usually go last. <br>  <br>  Some popular 8 hour shifts are 6 on/2 off and 6 on/3 off. For the 6/2, your days of rotate Mon/Tue, Tue/Wed, Wed/Thur, Thur/Fri, then Fri/Sat/Sun. The 6/3 is a straight rotation. You only get one weekend off a month on 6/3, and one weekend every 5 weeks on 6/2.<br>  <br>  Some departments do 10 hour shifts also, usually 4on/4off or 3on/4off followed by 4on/3off. <br>  <br>  Twelve hour shifts seem to be the most popular. There are 3on/3off, 4on/4off, and 2/2/3. <br>  <br>  Our department works 2/2/3, and we like it because it is every other weekend off, Fri/Sat/Sun. The week starts on Monday, so week 1 you work Mon/Tue, get Wed/Thurs off, then work Fri/Sat/Sun. The next week is just the opposite.
G2auAv1Saa	I have also spent years working for those less fortunate than myself. On an ambulance, at a mission, in a hospital and a nursing home. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that, and I am a Republican. It is not evil. What is evil it to force someone to help more than another, it is evil to have to support people who can fully help themselves but choose not to. We have to have taxes, but in this country where we want to tout everything as equal we all need to pay the same percentage of taxes, and if someone wants to help more then that is wonderful. |`|5iuQ9ILZaa	You are welcome to help as many down trodden as you wish<br>  <br>  Just don't do it with our tax dollars|`|c2f7b7e7c197d88a1a3ae7caa8ff6fc2aa	There is nothing wrong with helping people.<br>  Everything is wrong with doing it with tax dollars. Tax dollars are not voluntary, the government does not ask you to pay taxes, they put a gun in your face and take them by force. That is extortion, tyranny, slavery, and yes, it is evil.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with having sex. Everything is wrong with having sex at gun-point. The difference is consent. See how something beautiful is made evil when freedom and consent is removed?|`|0lV2C78xaa	The issue they have is with people who can help themselves who refuse too. They don't realize that we are against this too(isn't everyone) and we should come together rather than fight to assure that help is given to those who do need it.<br>  <br>  Kudos to you :)<br>  <br>  <br>  And its a shame that some people assume that most/many of the needy aren't really needy. These people are the type that would prefer to have a new car or a new XBox rather than help someone eat tonight. What happened to compassion?|`|p2AG6CnGaa	That is so untrue.  It is you profession and you get paid for it.  BEsides that. republicans tend to donate more from their take home pay to charity as well as their time.

Thanks for what you're doing.<br>  <br>  However,<br>  <br>  Thinking that Republicans don't want to help the less fortunate is Democratic ignorance at its best. Or Democratic Politicians at their best. Who don't give a damn about the people in their party; they just want to fill their heads with lies and stupidity to keep them in their place and preaching their message of a Glorious Utopian Communist Country. I used to be one of those until I used the internet to research the crap they say and try to do.<br>  <br>  Republicans want to help you. But they want to help you help yourself. Not force another Government mandated service or department down your throat. Dems want everything to be mandated and controlled by the government. That's not free will. That's the opposite of what this country was founded on.<br>  <br>  And how do they pay for all these mandated programs? Taxes. And More Taxes.<br>  <br>  What the dems think is that those who have more money should give that money to the government to create services for all the citizens. From health care to welfare. But where does it stop?!? In their eyes it stops with a USA where everyone is equal, everyone makes the same amount of money, everyone pays the same. the same the same the same. Sound familiar. It's communism. It's socialism.<br>  <br>  And while it sounds nice, it doesn't work. You have a welfare system that pays enough for a family to live comfortably without having to go out and get a job then you get a family that won't go out and get a job. And the children of that family do the same. And there children do the same. Look at France. You can't get fired. You get fair wages. So no one goes to work. No one tries hard. There's no competition. There's no market. There's no opportunity.<br>  <br>  Health Care?!? Have you BEEN to a DMV? Now multiply your worst experience at a DMV by 10,000 and introduce a heart attack or broken arm to the equation.<br>  <br>  <br>  
vDafDiOraa	That's because people think Fox News supports the republicans, when in reality NBC/CNN/MSNBC/etc are so far left, Fox DOES appear to be right.<br>  <br>  But if you do your research you'll see Fox reports accurately while all others are terribly skewed.|`|USfjlrLNaa	I watched "Hannity's America" program last night and if you can honestly say it was just reporting, then i feel for you.  That wasn't "just reporting", it was a story, that may have had honest facts, but was presented in way that was insincere and slanted.  It wasn't just, "here are the facts, make up your own mind."  It was, "believe what we say or your stupid and we will all be moved into a communist/socialist/terrorist state if this guy is elected to be president.  Saying he has terrorist ties is one thing/ saying he IS a terrorist is another.  That's fear-mongering.  If they had just reported the facts, I would have listened more, but they had to put on people to call him, "Barry" and say he IS a terrorist and he IS a socialist and he IS a black nationalist.  That's not fair and balanced.

A racist, KKK supporter who wrote a book against Obama that has WIDELY been criticized and debunked by every major source out there as false, speculative, and disgusting. In Corsi's book, he actually uses his own statements in the past as 'sources' for his new book. I.E. I could say "McCain slept with a unicorn" here....then write a book and quote YAnswers for my source that McCain is an adulterer and has sex with animals. They have no alternative opinion or source, just whatever Hannity wants to believe.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	They don't report accurate news at all. You will have to watch others such as CNN & see what accurate is then go to them to see the difference. The twist things with words that make things inaccurate..they are owned by an Austrailian man who paid Newt Gingrich $12 million dollars to have a law changed so he could by up more air waves then he was allowed to have before.

Fox is nationally known to be a huge conservative media outlet... it's not even considered a major network because of its bias.|`|uBqYq4CMaa	Because they often report hearsay as news.  They run with a story, spread it as truth and never fact check it, which is bad practice for news organizations.<br>  <br>  They had a habit in the past of having one of their reporters as a guest on another network make a blatantly false statement, and then citing the other network as the source for the statement, so as to make it look credible.  All news agencies spread propaganda to some extent, but Fox is less concerned with accuracy then sensationalism, and obviously supports all the positions of Rupert Murdoch with its journalism, which frightens those who pay attention.|`|G6yyceAxaa	It is ok to report something questionable, however if you report on one candidate doing something, and the other candidate is doing it also, and you somehow "didn't notice" then that is being biased.<br>  <br>  I think they should all stick to the issues, We are not going to get far with "We are Mavericks" and "Oh, he lived near a domestic terrorist".<br>  <br>  |`|lbAftZFmaa	Actually what they do is not accurate. They distort facts. They have some "liberals" on their network that basically get paid to be shouted down. There is a lot more rhetoric and alliteration than facts on Fox News.

No. Ohh I guess that is for the other networks to do since Fox news is too lazy to do a fair and balanced job|`|vTy2JtB3aa	FOXNEWS saying they are fair and balanced is the problem.

LWzrCu5caa	Consider Randy Cunningham,  first missile ace of the Vietnam War.  (There were only five American Aces during the entire war.)<br>  <br>  To be an Ace you need five confirmed shoot downs of enemy planes.  Not just enemy planes but fighter planes.  It does not count if you shoot down a transport or even a bomber, it has to be an enemy fighter.<br>  <br>  Considering that we can now shoot down enemy planes at 50+ miles and they can do the same,  it will be very hard to confirm shoot downs.   And it will not be a mass of our fighters vs theirs as both sides will have rather limited numbers.   Add to that the surface to air missiles and who is to know what shot down what?<br>  <br>  I think in the future we will not see any more Aces,  unless you allow them to count any enemy aircraft,  even old WW II prop jobs,  Helicopters,  UAVs and carrier pigeons.  |`|AA12384876	as of current america has no enemy aircraft to contened with over iraq or afganistan. a modern day ace may be possible but it would be hard.  five fighters is alot considering there arent any masss air battle anyway. fighters go up in fairly small groups now compared to the ww2 or vietnam escort packages. n as to ur question about cannons, almost all fighters carry cannons. f-15, f-16, f-22s, f-18s. typically its the m61 vulcan which is capable of 6000 round per minute. n which bullets r 20mm armor peirceing high inceredy( armor peirceing explosives) each. the fighter only carries around 480 rounds of ammunition but a quick burst is all thats needed. firing onlyone round woulbe be extremly hard but as with anything a well placed shot can down almost anything. a burst is more pratical though. older migs n other planes have larger calibers, ranging from excess of 20mm-about 37mm rounds. n about migs there still out there. mig is a company not just a plane. there r newer formiddle migs out there. check out the mig 29. n as far as training google air force red flag. hope this helps|`|pwdv08hVaa	obviously the "ace" status can only be earned in real combat

Supporters contend that it is actually more numerous but composed predominantly of persons less willing to voice political views in as forceful a manner as the Christian Right, possibly because of the aggressiveness of the Christian Right. Further, supporters contend that the Christian Left has had relatively little success securing widespread corporate, political, and major media patronage compared to the Right. In the aftermath of the 2004 election in the United States Progressive Christian leaders started to form groups of their own to combat the Religious Right; The Center For Progressive Christianity and The Christian Alliance For Progress are two such groups that have formed to promote the cause.<br>  <br>  Other common leftist concerns such as pacifism, social justice, racial equality, human rights, and the rejection of excessive wealth are also expressed strongly in the Bible.|`|ZFm7O7Etaa	They aren't.

The group was dedicated to stamping out communism around the globe.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jzQtw1kATj1xCqPcAmwgCKDtNpDQD93LGSJG0" rel="nofollow">http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jzQtw...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  The World League for Freedom and Democracy (formerly the World Anti-Communist League) is an international right-wing political organization founded in 1966 in Taipei, Taiwan, under the initiative of Chiang Kai-shek. It was founded with the aim of opposing Communism around the world through "unconventional" methods. It had eight regional branches, with a presence in up to 100 countries on six continents. The honorary life chairman of the WACL was Dr. Ku Cheng-Kang, a senior leader of the Kuomintang (KMT), and the president of Taiwan's National Assembly.<br>  <br>  The U.S. chapter of WACL, the United States Council for World Freedom (USCWF), has been one of the most active branches. USCWF was founded in 1981 by Major General John K. Singlaub. This branch has generated controversy, as it has been found to have illegally supplied firearms to guerillas in the Iran-Contra Affair and, in 1981, the USCWF was placed under watch by the Anti-Defamation League, which noted the organization had increasingly become a point of contact for extremists, racists and anti-Semites.[1]<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_League_for_Freedom_and_Democracy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Leagu...</a> <br>  <br>  |`|5Wc1vDshaa	Yes.

Logic will be Car Washing companies buying each others to increase their size if they don't change their ways to work<br>  <br>  I can't see them cutting benefice without trying something.<br>  If the productivity at work isn't increased, cutting people is like sending consumers to concurrence. This concurrence will see an opportunity if you increase the costs. and it can even push more consumers to wash their cars themselves.<br>  <br>  That means the employer to keep his previous profit and even look for an increment will develop the productivity at work. So people will work more or develop technics and buy tools to work better and faster.They ll go this way first cause the more reactive one will buy the less reactive in future<br>  <br>  Its true they can already do it without the new taxes but that ll force them to focus on their activity and they will easily try the investment in cash and time most have delays<br>  That's not something new in industrialization and it now takes more and more place in the service sector and small companies which are predominant nowadays<br>  Investments r good for economy, credits to healthy company r good for bank system and these new tools can help with new jobs or new companies.All of this meanings new taxes income.<br>  US have still a margin looking productivity at work index of developed countries especially with Services|`|a74b14a2df8f491b94ca062ec6bd8e23aa	I have a friend who works at a factory who I mentioned this to because he thinks Obama is the patron Saint sent to save us all...and after urging this friend for weeks, he finally went and asked to appease me....after getting the run around from the employer it finally came out that hours would have to be cut in order for the company to keep operating--no layoffs, immediately, but hours would be "trimmed".

This is obviously a case of you having NO IDEA why this country needed the financial system to be repaired before we could move forward. Economics is a perfect circle, if one part of the circle is broken then the entire system comes crashing down. Fixing the financial side and putting into place safeguards to prevent future disasters was a necessary thing to do. You obviously didn't have a 401k, mortgage, pension plan or mutual fund that was affected by this "bailout" It was crucial and vital to our country to fix this horrendous blunder commited by the greed of wall street. <br>  <br>  As for Obama's plan, he wants to eliminate Bush's tax cuts to corporations and anybody making over 250,000 a year because as economists have proven their tax cut does NOTHING to stimulate the economy. He wants to continue with the tax cuts for people making less than 250,000 a year because the middle class needs the money and will actually stimulate the economy with it. He wants to end the war in Iraq which will bring billions of dollars back into our economy and end the wasteful spending. He wants to seek alternative energy to lower our dependence on foreign oil. All of these will help to steady the economy and within a few years balance the budget for the first time since the last Democrat was in office. Taxes are necessary in this country, but how their allocated and spent is what will decide if our lives will be better or worse. |`|c4a12b4159512248edfdbea403dcfa2eaa	Where have you been for the last 6 months that you don't yet know the answer to this very basic question?

It was basically a check for 700billion.  Sure the amount has gone up, but I don't think that (and yes I am actually siding partly with McCain on this) either candidate knew what to do in this situation.  They were being pressured by their parties to vote yes, and they themselves didn't have a better soloution to the problem.<br>  <br>  I believe that the reason that America feels that Obama can do a better job dealing with the Economy is simple.  McCain has made it clear in comments and in actions that he doesn't understand the economy, and his answer to helping out the economy?  Save your money and don't leave beyond your means.  He's not taking into account all the 'fat cats' and big businesses who has gotten the nation into this crisis in the first place, but he's telling us we have to help fix it.

You are also somewhat of a simpleton:  I've lost a job because of this economy.  Do your homework before sprouting off.<br>  <br>  I admire your values -- I share them, in fact.

Ummm, running a country requires paying attention to future trends. We're WELL on our way there. Why don't you read about the Great Depression. History repeats itself. It's like Deja Vu. The failure of the Hoover administration (the guy before Roosevelt who left the presidency in disgrace) was because of that selfish shortsighted view that you hold. Here's the problem: your neighbor's welfare (and the welfare of other Americans in general) SHOULD be in your interest. Why? because when they fail, you fail. Everything is interconnected. If things continue to go the way they are, you will need to rely on the government. There will be no house to heat. And just because you don't know anyone who has lost jobs because of the economy doesn't mean it hasn't happened. Look beyond your small world.

I still don't feel my taxes should continue to go up to support lazy people, they can call it unprivileged, they can say it's lack of jobs, but the hard truth is we make it to easy for them to sit home, doing drugs,supporting men with there food stamps, and we provide lw rent housing that they destroy .  and complain about the conditions.

Why are you people talking about this when the economy is sliding further into the hole and Europe is sliding right along with us?  When we still don't know if the bailout is going to work?  When the Taliban has been "unusually" angered by attacks?  When we lost hundreds of thousands of jobs last month and nearly 1 million this year so far?  Do you honestly think this is more important than that?  I don't care who the president is - be he someone who doesn't like white people who will be checked by the white congress and is, therefore, unable to act on his hatred or a white guy with robes hidden under his bed who will be checked by the white congress and is, therefore, unable to act on his hatred -  as long as these issues are addressed.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	You immediately got attacked and someone said "stick with the issues."  For the record, racism IS an issue and one that plagues the American people...therefore a huge issue. In addition, Rev. Wright preaches hate against the U.S., so it IS an issue. Also, keep in mind that it wasn't the FIRST twenty years of his life he sat in that pew..so it wasn't that long ago. Furthermore, until exposed, he worshiped the man and vocally and on camera thanked him for his "counsel" and support. He performed Michelle and Barry's wedding (Barry is his given name) and baptized his children. Something tells me that if I posted a question asking about McCain's ties to a church that is known for racism, people would be outraged. I guess simple logic is escaping the tired and weary.|`|hJiWqnf5aa	Yes, it sure does. I went to a Holy Roller Church with my Sister one time, and I knew in 5 minutes, that they were all crazy as hell. You can't tell me that Obama sat in that church for 20 years, and didn't know they were all a bunch of racists. Obama is either a Racist, and he loved evey minute of it, or he is dumber then a box of rocks. Either way, I don't want him as my President.Obamas followers might buy his BS, but I'm not buying what he is selling. Democrat for McCain/Palin 2008. |`|4fqaQRnIaa	Actually Rev. Wright was the only one standing up and telling the truth about the causes of 911.  One of the few in America who dared to do so.  An honest man with guts.<br>  <br>  <br>  I watched the FOX clip that was broadcast to millions and then I watched the full clip.  FOX made Wright look quite insane and this is what will stick in people's minds and, unless you go hunting for the full clip and find the truth of Rev. Wright you should not be commenting here at all because you'll just be spewing FOX ignorance and impoverished style of reporting.<br>  <br>  It's my considered opinion that Rev Wright would like to see the US become a great country rather than the rogue nation it has been for the past 40 years.  It takes people like him, who speak the truth that will push this country forward while the liars like Bush and his administration will drive this country into the ground while they get rich.<br>  <br>  I don't find Wright's preaching style something I would like; but I can't ever see myself 'speaking in tongues' either.<br>  <br>  <br>  There seem to be a lot of white racists here again today.|`|x3S96oU7aa	Because it wasn't a racist remark that's why.   Most of what the Good Rev Wright says was the truth about how blacks was treated in the Good Old USA.|`|FXoCtVBRaa	I think it does. There's no way you can sit in a church for nearly 25 years and not notice that the pastor is anti-American and racist.|`|F6NZaYyQaa	Yes. He is racist.

But as everyone says, let's put it in the past because he doesn't feel that way anymore.  Whatever.  I have never actually heard him renounce Rev. Wright and his garbage - he just makes excuses for him.  I don't care what anyone says.  I don't believe that I want a racist whitey hating man in any position of power much less as President.  Hatred is not good in any shape or form and if he has attended a church for 20 years that talks about hatred with such passion then it has to of rubbed off on him.  Not to mention all those ties to muslims. Did you know that Obama  has strong ties to people in Pakistan?  Did you know that Al Quaeda is now hiding in Pakistan regrouping and getting ready to strike again?  You should think about that while you ponder that there are such bigger issues to worry about right now than whether our future possible president is a racist.  |`|qpYOEi7Oaa	yes.....or it really proves that he is truly a muslim that did not even want a choice for that so called christian faith under Jeremiah Wright...

However, they both are going to be viewed as the worst Presidents.  They'll just keep each other company on the bottom of the list.|`|KhBmlaefaa	Jimmy Carter of course. No President could be any worse than him, not even Obamanation.|`|AA11369432	Bush ,  For Sure. We did not go broke under Carter. That's for sure. WE did not enter a war under him.|`|AA11540917	bush - by far the worst|`|bA0sLHnlaa	I think Carter's worst flaw was he was somewhat naive.  He was handed the mess left by Nixon / Ford,  The economy sucked but the economy of the current president term is usually the result of the prior term.  He was perceived to be soft on the military, but when he took office it was right after the end of the Vietnam war and the cold war was settled down (before it flared up again in 79).  The US at the time was not all that gung ho about a big military.<br>    Actually he was highly intelligent, as a graduate of the US Naval academy in nuclear engineering.   During his presidency he approved funding for many weapon systems that were vital in the Gulf war, including the Tomahawk cruise missile, and the F-117A stealth fighter.   The best Reagan gave us was the B1-B bomber (which has been obsolete from its inception) and "Star Wars"  <br>  He took a lot of heat for the Iranian Hostages, but really he had no options, people forget that the Soviets were right next door at the time so it wasn't like we could go invade Iran.  After the failed rescue mission that costs 8 solders lives (and since Carter couldn't control the sands storm that caused the accident), he had no options but negotiations. <br>  The hostages were freed on the day of Reagan's inauguration, but Reagan had nothing to do with any negations.  In the end, Carter did what he promised, he brought them all home.   <br>  <br>  I think Bush has done far far more damage that we even know at this point.   His incompentence is the laughing  stock of the civilized world.|`|rS4Gkw1daa	Carter had his blunders like ALL Presidents do, but his foresight about our much needed energy independence goes overlooked. He wanted our country to invest in wind and solar energy and Reagan did away with his ideas. If our government would have listened, we wouldn't be talking about the $700 billion dollars we send to other countries for our oil. We would have been 30 years ahead of the game.<br>  <br>  So, my vote goes to the C avg. jack-@$$ who has ruined our country's image. |`|9ujT56Maaa	As bad as Bush has been, Carter was easily the worse president of the two.<br>  <br>  Of course, he's also the only one of the two that's going to Heaven, but that's immaterial.|`|SfPx4BTLaa	Carter for sure was the worst. Obama wants to copy Carter's foreign policy and that is a big mistake.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	Carter|`|lCW3Worpaa	Bush, hands down.  And I'm a Republican.|`|4KtPFzz5aa	Bush by a landslide!

This was pretty much the death of most of the US wind industry‚Äù (see ‚ÄúAnti-wind McCain delivers climate remarks at foreign wind company‚Äú).<br>  <br>  Reagan gutted Carter‚Äôs entire multi-billion dollar clean energy and energy efficiency effort. He opposed and then rolled back fuel economy standards. Reagan turned all such commonsense strategies into ‚Äúliberal‚Äù policies that must be opposed by any true conservative, a position embraced all too consistently by conservative leaders from Gingrich to Bush/Cheney and now to John McCain....<br>  <br>  |`|x7NL8YMDaa	both|`|B2lZ93zLaa	Carter, He did not have the intelligence to understand he was in over his head.  He tried to handle everything himself.  It was an unmitigated disaster.  The economy, the military, and the overall feelings of Americans.  I was young but I remember thinking I had no future and things were only going to keep getting worst.  That is why the only politician I have ever respected is Reagan.  He turned us around from that 4 year nightmare.  All the rest of the politicians are crooks and thieves, both parties.  Jimmy Carter was a well meaning man, but his incompetence almost killed this country.  |`|F4x8n8eCaa	i saw that last night also~!<br>  <br>  it seems that the republicans tested Carters stance and strength, and he blinked, so they proceeded to walk all over him after that~!<br>  <br>  IF they would have listened and RESPECTED his decisions we would not be in the mess today, he had great foresight on the energy issues and foreign policy's, but in fact it was the republicans running the show~!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  oh ya, BUSH SUCKS~!!!!|`|25a5352ee7f39b2d80675708936598eeaa	Carter was a worse president.

I think the UN needs to actually form a well-trained police-agency.|`|2FA9qNHzaa	Actually, without even watching your video, I can say that the military police are a strong force in the military.

I feel that, perhaps in another 2-3 years would be a better time for the US to hand over control to the Iraqis again|`|L0Dp5uYWaa	No, we shouldn't be policing Iraq, but we kind of were left with no choice considering the police force and army they had were too corrupt and incompetent to function on their own.<br>   <br>  I would like you to explain or show me how we've failed though, I know many many Iraqis and American service members would disagree with you on that one. I sure do.<br>  <br>  We will let the Iraqis care for themselves once we are confident they can do so and won't let another Saddam take over.|`|AA10275501	absolutely they should be taking it from here!<br>  we're in recession and heading for a further dive economically.....it's time for us to take care of ourselves and let them do the same!|`|Ba6lYx9Xaa	Failed? You must have never been to Iraq?|`|5vw7S7ZJaa	When the USA went into IRAQ at first they sacked every single civil servant, including the police force and the armed forces. Who did u expect to do it. Thats probably a main reason why the USA was hated so much. Why they disbanded the iraqi armed forces, who firstly didnt put up much of a fight, and were ready to undertake poilcing duties etc is strange. Why go inot iraq, then sack 200,000 soldiers from thier jobs. These people relied on these jobs to feed thier families etc. So think of this, your an iraqi soldier, you get the sack, cant get a job in warring iraq, have to feed yourself and family and sunni militants or whatever offer you 500 bucks to kill an american soldier, who represents the organisation who made you redundant. Now these unemployed soldiers know where weapons are stored, or already have them. So what do you do?<br>  <br>  Anyway thats enough ranting....<br>  <br>  You are right in one aspect, the defence forces are not policemen. They are too different and demanding roles. But who else was going to do it while the country went to hell?<br>  <br>  It takes years to build an effective police organisation, and when recruiting centres were being blown up at regular intervals that doesnt help.<br>  <br>  Awards should be given to the brave local people who undertook this Mammoth job, while under the threat of execution not only for themselves but for thier whole familes. Hundreds of iraqi police force members have been executed in the streets over the last few years, including being beheaded.<br>  <br>  its only after deals were done with the warring factions has the insanity calmed down abit.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|beMYY8Jcaa	Not legally without a SOFA, or Status of Forces Agreement.

Now, people don't pay taxes on the health benefits they get from work. Obama's statement gives the impression that $5,000 is all that workers will be getting to help them pay for a health plan, but that's just what the federal government will provide. Economists say most employers would still contribute to their workers' health insurance. The Lewin Group, a health care consulting firm, found that by taxing health benefits but providing a tax credit, the average family would come out $1,411 ahead.|`|ED433Q6Yaa	obama is a christain. is what pastor the way of a christain and what about obama being part of that mindset for twenty years. maybe obama is not a christain but he says he is.|`|k6TjuQRdaa	Mind you...they shove Christianity down peoples throat.<br>  <br>  ONE ANSWER FOR THAT...they know they are the WORST kind of Christian so if they try that route, it makes them sleep better at night.<br>  <br>  |`|b91777f1aec0cb5be14c157f389d8a9faa	Christians aren't Christian.|`|BREf9KOwaa	He used to drop napalm on poor people.....you really think he's gonna get teary-eyed over some poor people in this country....|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	My sound card is nonexistant so I can't hear what BO was saying to get that response.

The tax credit covers 30 percent of the costs of switching one or more traditional petroleum pumps to E85, which is an 85 percent ethanol/15 percent gasoline blend.<br>  <br>  -After a number of inmates on death row were found innocent, Senator Obama worked with law enforcement officials to require the videotaping of interrogations and confessions in all capital cases.<br>  <br>  -His first law was passed with Republican Tom Coburn, a measure to rebuild trust in government by allowing every American to go online and see how and where every dime of their tax dollars is spent.<br>  <br>  -Obama created the Illinois Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income working families in 2000 and successfully sponsored a measure to make the credit permanent in 2003. The law offered about $105 million in tax relief over three years.<br>  <br>  -Obama joined forces with former U.S. Sen. Paul Simon (D-IL) to pass the toughest campaign finance law in Illinois history. The legislation banned the personal use of campaign money by Illinois legislators and banned gifts from lobbyists. Before the law was passed, one organization ranked Illinois worst among 50 states for its campaign finance regulations.<br>  <br>  -As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Obama has fought to help Illinois veterans get the disability pay they were promised, while working to prepare the VA for the return of the thousands of veterans who will need care after Iraq and Afghanistan.<br>  <br>  -He traveled to Russia with Republican Dick Lugar to begin a new generation of non-proliferation efforts designed to find and secure deadly weapons around the world.<br>  <br>  -Obama has been a leading advocate for protecting the right to vote, helping to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act and leading the opposition against discriminatory barriers to voting.<br>  <br>  - In the U.S. Senate, Obama introduced the STOP FRAUD Act to increase penalties for mortgage fraud and provide more protections for low-income homebuyers, well before the current subprime crisis began.<br>  <br>  -Obama sponsored legislation to combat predatory payday loans, and he also was credited with lobbied the state to more closely regulate some of the most egregious predatory lending practices.<br>  <br>  -Barack Obama introduced the Patriot Employer Act of 2007 to provide a tax credit to companies that maintain or increase the number of full-time workers in America relative to those outside the US; maintain their corporate headquarters in America; pay decent wages; prepare workers for retirement; provide health insurance; and support employees who serve in the military.<br>  <br>  -Obama worked to pass a number of laws in Illinois and Washington to improve the health of women. His accomplishments include creating a task force on cervical cancer, providing greater access to breast and cervical cancer screenings, and helping improve prenatal and premature birth services.<br>  <br>  -Obama has introduced and helped pass bipartisan legislation to limit the abuse of no-bid federal contracts.<br>  <br>  -Obama and Senator Feingold (D-WI) took on both parties and proposed ethics legislation that was described as the "gold standard" for reform. It was because of their leadership that ending subsidized corporate jet travel, mandating disclosure of lobbyists' bundling of contributions, and enacting strong new restrictions of lobbyist-sponsored trips became part of the final ethics bill that was signed into law.|`|6032e3d0bdd995632bc1d55b490aba3eaa	Socialism huh.

Would you ask his mother?  That is basically what you do when you get your "facts" from ANY politician's webpage.  They are DESIGNED to make the candidate look good.  For example, the tax plan you are referring to on Obama's website is talking ONLY about the federal income tax on wages.  Sure, Obama's plan would cut taxes on wages.  This would not impace 80% of American, though, considering that it is almost 40% who pay no federal income tax now.  It also would be countered by many of his increases in taxes.  97% of those who currently pay income taxes pay a part of them on capital gains, on which Obama wants to nearly double the tax rate.  Also, currently if you sell your primary home, and the value is less than $250K single/$500 for married couple, you have no tax consequence.  However, Obama wants to get rid of that.  So, if you bought a house for $100K ten years ago, and you sold it for $175K under Obama.  You would see your $75K of gain taxed at 28%.   So you (and $175K is typical for lower income families) would lose $21,000 under Obama's plan.  <br>  So, when you spout of Obama's plans, you are referring to ONE tax type.  Obama would be increasing taxes across the board.  Even many of those who pay NO federal income tax currently would see taxes that they have not had to pay, such as selling their home.|`|EoCS4Yxxaa	mcman|`|kpzwPnWPaa	the first one|`|VNcxe3Hnaa	Neither will help people get out of debt as that's not the president's job.  However, both candidates have a plan to restructure the tax brackets.  McCain proposes the single largest cut for a tax bracket, though it will only effect a small number of Americans (those making more than $200k/yr, but not the highest bracket).  Obama's plan involve cutting income taxes for about 80% of Americans while raising them on the highest bracket (whom current pay the smallest percentage).<br>  <br>  This is the closest I can come to a proper yes or no answer.  In actuality, if the income taxes you pay chaning by 1-2% actually determines whether or not one is in debt, then that person needs to better plan their finances.<br>  <br>  Neither candidate has a plan to end war.  In fact, the situation the Bush administration has got us into makes it very difficult to actually end the wars we're fighting any time soon.  McCains stance is to stay in Iraq until the objective in that region is accomlished, with no mention of what to do elswhere.  Obama's plan is to reallocate troops to Afghanistan and Pakistan, reasoning that this is where Al Qaeda is actually cetralized.  The plan still calls for a 'residual' presence in Iraq as the country builds its own defensive capablity.<br>  <br>  My opinion:  Obama's military plan actually seems like it would bring an end to the war sooner by hurting Al Qaeda where it would hurt them instead of just providing a defense for Iraqi civilians for an indefinate amount of time.  |`|qNGhtSPvaa	well so far i've heard that Obama wants to end the war but McCain wants to keep the war so if we end the war we're not going to pay as much taxes. idk who will help people get out of debt though. hope this helped. :) personally i think Obama is going to be ( if elected) a better president then if McCain would be, so i'm going for Obama. :)|`|AA10747402	My suggestion to you, if you really are serious about knowing more, go to youtube and look each candidate up.

I believe everyone who is capable of work should be working and not sitting on their couch in their designer clothes, eating steak, playing games on their XBOX 360 (or Wii), gathering checks from the government. There's a difference between "charity" and "handout".  <br>  <br>  Just because I can afford to pay for the roof I'm under is no reason for me to think I have to pay for someone else to afford theirs when they were irresponsible.|`|F2ygsPEbaa	First of all, I don't have a problem with helping those less fortunate than me TEMPORARILY.  I have problems with people who think the government owes them a living and who absolutely refuse to provide for themselves economically.  Do you know how many people in this country refuse to work despite the fact that they are capable of doing so?  Secondly, I also have a problem with government waste and inefficiency.  My observation is that charities are much more effective in getting help to the needy without wasting a lot of the resources in endless red tape.<br>  <br>  While a tax deduction certainly is an incentive, it is not why I tithe to my church.  I do so because I have been blessed, God calls me to do and it is the right thing to do.<br>  <br>  If my taxes got lowered, I would give away even more to charity.  Charities have proven time and time again that they are much more efficient in doing things than is our government (although granted, most charities don't have the resources the government does).<br>  <br>  The biggest argument against your question?  THINK FEMA!!!!!!!  Another outstanding example of government in action.|`|cb0e94e3fb43566c50cac1d8f0ff3169aa	Yea, donating $1000 to charity so you can take a $500 tax deduction makes great financial sense. You‚Äôre obviously a produce of public education. <br>  <br>  If you want to help the poor then volunteer at a soup kitchen. <br>  <br>  Taxes are bad, no matter who's paying them. They‚Äôre used as a punitive measure. Wherever they're applied that particular activity decreases. That‚Äôs why taxes are so high on cigarettes. Lower taxes actually increase tax revenue. It works every time it's tried, JFK did it, Reagan did it & Bush did it.<br>  |`|cBT7pS0maa	More taxes on companies means stuff with cost more, also raising the gas prices.<br>  <br>   So in the long run it's not helping anyone out.|`|5hxWSezPaa	Not a double standard at all.

I like to know what my donations are going for.  Let me ask you a question- Do YOU want to pay more taxes to help out the less fortunate?  Because obviously your nominees don't give much to charity- have you seen the percentages?  I hope you realize that Obama's 1 trillion that he wants for all his programs has to come from somewhere- & since 700 billion that we had to borrow for the bailout is unavailable and Obama has said he doesn't want to cut any of his plans- where does he intend to get the money?  Cutting taxes to 95% of American's just doesn't work- the math just isn't right.  Hopefully you realize this.  It's going to be on every single one of us who work- while those who just keep popping out newborns for the welfare are the only ones who will benefit.

Did you question a bunch of Republicans?  More likely you are just as close-minded as you accuse the right of being.<br>  <br>  I think it's foolish of you to call an entire group of people callous and selfish based on some politician's diatribe (and, regardless of how you feel about him, Obama is no more honest or caring than any other politician).<br>  <br>  Don't you get that Obama's rhetoric is just designed to be divisive?

You only get the effective tax rate off.  For example if you are paying 35% in taxes, and you deduct $100 from your income as a charitable deduction, you only are not having to pay $35 in tax that would otherwise be taken from the $100 you earned.  So you are still giving up $65.

Not a good combination. |`|FKN9kBvLaa	Because people are finally seeing through the condescending lies and scare tactics that Republicans HAVE ALWAYS used to get elected.  They can also see that McCain (like Bush) is not very bright.  He spends more time ragging on Obama for what he did or didn't do, because he has no real solutions himself.  He knows that we know that he supported the majority of the dumb @ss decisions Bush made, so his only chance is to scare everyone into believing that he is the lesser of two evils.  It would be hilarious if not so pathetic.<br>  <br>  "Edit" Excactly Karen!|`|bd7388851727f8e5810b81c40752ffb1aa	Those advertisements?  He is trying to appeal to a voter's worst side.

QYcXNOKOaa	I think it is a political ploy that the republicans are using to scare the people into thinking Obama is something that he isn't. Redirecting people's minds off of the relevant issues, while making Obama seem like the boogey man.<br>  No matter what it is, it is sick and perverse.Very disturbing.<br>  I imagine they are sorry that they planted those people out in the audience. They must, indeed have been very desperate.<br>  peace.|`|V9s2dRdDaa	Yes, we all need to calm down a little.  I am conservative but not a bigot.  I don't think Obama is an Arab but because of his lack of experience and poor judgment, I do consider him a risk for leading this nation at such a critical time.  The "race card" has been played by the democrats in selecting a dark skinned man.  That's right, "a dark skinned" man.  In my mind he is not black, he is half black.  The democrats have run him as black, therefore playing the race card. McCain is no Messiah either but he does have a heart for service and with his experience should make a fine president.|`|158103f542667e7053e0cf3db0d604bfaa	Don't you realized that most networks (TV/media/newspaper and even Yahoo) are pro Dems?

4713a7c1b906526b10a8a0d692819231aa	Palin has two assets that scare most of the people when they are in the same person: being beautiful and being capable. That's why she's criticized. They forget she's a self made woman, no rich or powerful family behind her success, she made it by herself, she's a winner and some don't admit it, they want another Rice or Hillary, so far away from Sarah bright career, built under hard work and not only empty words. She's not only theory, she put her hands on, at work, at career, caring of her body (she's a runner), at her family and kids. |`|sTTzXCsgaa	So you care about what the democrats think?<br>  <br>  Do you have a crush on her or something?|`|FcZU29W6aa	Have you seen her interviews with Charles Gibson and Katie Couric?  She does not know what she is talking about.  She said she had foreign policy experience because she can see Russia from her house!  I dread the thought of her becoming Vice President.|`|0pPT2HqKaa	You have a valid point. But Palin is out of the mainstream, she is not up on issues that face Americans living on the mainland. She didn't even know what newspapers to read, she couldn't name a supreme court ruling that she doesn't agree with, she doesn't know the complexity of our foreign policy and blah blah blah.<br>  <br>  Hence, she is a great small town sheriff (gov.alaska) but i don't think she is ready to be #2 in the FBI (vp of the US) |`|15b68e83c3ef9d01d0153600c96e7fe3aa	Dude, there have been many women governors and majors, like Governor Ann Richards of Texas.<br>  <br>  People don't come down hard on Sarah Palin because she is a woman. They come down hard on her because she is a nutcase religious freak (casting out witches), a constant and continuous liar (Road To Nowhere, International Experience Because She Can See Russia From Her House), a person with unscrupulous ethics when it comes to holding office (the investigations and findings about her fraud, her misuse of office, etc.)<br>  <br>  I'm neither a Liberal or a Democrat and I think she about the most embarrassing thing to happen to the Republican Party in years.|`|d03d1f6a713407f3a6dbe8c90e096997aa	That's ridiculous.

Being Mayor does not qualify someone for being President, regardless of whether they are a man or a woman.|`|bxA9ZfYVaa	I'm a woman and this doesn't bother me a bit! People are questioning her as a person, not as a woman. Why does everything have to be a sexist reason? |`|o2WEoWp5aa	Well, I'm not a woman, but it does bother me. It bothers me, not just because her experience is more relevant than Obama's, she and Obama have almost equal experience. She's only going to be the VP, not the President, so it upsets me that they would even dare question her experience level. Now, what bugs me even more is that people (including other answerers of this question) attack her for things that are completely based on their own prejudices. Calling her stupid? What proof or facts are there?<br>  <br>  This isn't to say that I am a supporter of either McCain or Obama, it just really angers me that the only thing that people can say about her are either extremely hypocritical (experience) or completely misogynistic (calling her stupid or an air-head).|`|59JS5lnhaa	I love how you edit your "experience" of the other candidates.  Especially Biden's experience.<br>  <br>  Biden: chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he served as Chairman of the International Narcotics Control Caucushe, he was a Member of the New Castle County Council, and he served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee which led to the creation of the Violence Against Women Act. At least with Biden as VP I know that if I get raped he won't make me pay for my own rape kit.<br>  |`|Cf4Ywe23aa	Sarah Palin is an incompetent, ignorant, polarized, fundamentalist woman who is against the rights of women and is completely unqualified to lead the country. If a woman with reasonable values and beliefs were running I'd be behind her 100% but the fact that she's a moron means that I'd never vote for her.<br>  <br>  It has nothing to do with her being a woman.

She is not the best candidate for the job.  <br>  Although the State of Alaska elected herr to take control, "Because she is the fresh face", a lot of them are regretting this and I can guarantee, she won't be elected again.|`|1RTwcBXraa	Doesn't anger me, just makes me laugh at the Dems on who they think will change anything for the better. If he was white and saying the same things most would not be voting for him. It is not really about what he knows or says but more about his appearance.|`|JuL1jGS8aa	I'm pretty sick of them dogging Palin. They ( Obama ) expect transparency but are unwilling to give it. She is completely qualified to hold office,( more than Nancy Pelosi too ).|`|0wdEcNk1aa	With all of that executive experience I wonder why she needed 4 days of "intense preparation" for a single debate? And I wonder why she is under investigation for abuse of power (not really, I see a lot of women with power to this). She is the governor of a state that consists of ice, tourism, and pipelines that aren't in use! WHOW, so much experience there!<br>  <br>  As a female, she better be head and shoulders above the rest, and she isn't. Being a female doesn't give her a bi, it just means that she has to work harder to play in the boy's club. I can't see it. By the way, who is taking care of her children while all this is going on? Talk about skewed priorities. As mother, a famale, and someone who has had to work in a predominately male arena, i can't stand her. To me she represents everything that is going wrong with the families of this country.
fSlZQzS4aa	The good of somebody else does not seem to be a priority even though a nationalized system is probably the only way to get universal coverage.|`|rI6xYwhcaa	Jeanie in the bottle is right on some accounts.<br>  <br>   Essentially,  health care is better for those who can afford it (privately). If  you are talking about state sponsored care, then the UK beats the USA in terms of how well it handles issues. the UK has a better "mass health" plan than the USA. The hospitals in the states are underfunded for their needs and everyone is going to the emergency room for issues that dont need emergency care? Why? Because they have no health insurance to get minor health problems fixed and the ER is where they must go. <br>  <br>  In terms of private care the USA beats the UK. If you can afford it, you can get world class  service, but this is IF you can afford it.  <br>  <br>  I feel really sorry for those who think health care is a right or mandatory, as far as the USA is concerned those ppl can just roll over and die. Its a rather sad situation.|`|caefe9fcecf0459fc50d20cbc39f206faa	The complication of medicine compounded by our 'melting pot' of cultures - each with a different set of values - makes our health-care system all but impossible to compare to those of most other nations. <br>  <br>  I always look back on the cost-side (supply-side, I guess) of the equation. When I lived in Asia (again, can't compare absolutely), seeing a doctor was far cheaper - pharmaceuticals and all - than here...and it was NOT subsidized. Most schools, even, were privately funded. <br>  <br>  The U.S. is just too freakishly expensive. There is no reason within reach of the average bachelor or master's degree holding, professional - study as we may - for the excesses in price. They're just there. <br>  <br>  When an inexplicably-high cost causes a child or elderly parent to go without basic medicine and die, silences are broken. And with GOOD reason. <br>  <br>  Good question. No easy answer. <br>  ...|`|0wdEcNk1aa	And it isn't a well working system at all. There are so many people that can't get the most minimal health care in this country that it is sad. What it amounts to is that the healthcare indutries has gotten too greedy for its own good. And it is an industry. The insurance companies, phamacutical companies, hospitals, lawyers even, are all making massive amounts of money. The doctors have to charge more to cover their insurance costs, the patients have to pay the doctors and the insurance companies. The medications are priced outlandishly. And if you don't have money to pay all of the above, you don't get medical care!|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Ignorance and being set in ones way.<br>  <br>  <br>  Too many people just don't get that they are paying for the un/under insured in this country via taxes already.<br>  <br>  Education is lacking in the US big time. <br>  <br>  Nobody should be making a profit off of the health of individuals but we have unethical lobbyists fighting for the monetary rights of stockholders and executives within the health care industry. <br>  <br>  Ethics and morality is at an all time low in the US. <br>  <br>  The people hit the hardest are the women that are self employed. They pay a lot more for a policy with less coverage or no coverage(like maternity) than what an average employee/employer pays combined.|`|XRYAfxpTaa	Health care is far better in the US than most European nations. <br>  Take the UK for example, where my friend had to wait almost 10 months for a very necessary hysterectomy which would have been done here in just a few days, following diagnosis. As a result of the delay, she had major and avoidable complications.<br>  Lab testing in the UK is far substandard than in the US. Here, people with conditions such as diabetes and heart disease are monitored with frequency, especially when receiving medications that can affect the liver or kidneys. A friend in the UK is tested once a year, when here the doctor would monitor much more closely, and with one of the drugs he takes would be tested every 2 months. <br>  Many hospitals in the UK are filthy in comparison to US hospitals, with substandard equipment and  lacking modalities of treatment readily available in the US with the exceptions of BUPA facilities. <br>  Many people I know in the UK carry BUPA or other private health care coverage to avoid using their national health, it's delays and substandard care. <br>  Many Europeans, if they can afford to do so, travel to the US for higher quality medical care.<br>  <br>  Actually, the US has a special visa category..a B2 visa for medical treatment. The majority of those visa applicants are European.  Those who can afford the quality of care. Those who don't go to South America for cheap care, or they go to Hong Kong, Thailand, the Phillipines, or India. There is a term for them...medical tourists. In Europe, Poland and Slovakia are attempting to attract patients from other nations to cash in on medical tourism.<br>  <br>  Kelly L misunderstood me. My friend needs testing every 2 months. But he is British and is allowed testing only annually under their National Health. As a result, he has had numerous complications which were expensive to correct, more expensive than testing and adjusting his meds would have been. But that is typical of socialized medicine.|`|k6TjuQRdaa	Jeanie out of the bottle..<br>  <br>  well, you just let your jeanie out of the bottle. good for your friend who has the $$$ to go to the doctor every two months. I can afford to go MAYBE 2 times a year. that goes for me and my kids....<br>  <br>  my husband and i both work jobs. we pay OUTRAGEOUS healthcare premiums and our copays are now at $350 a person per year and going up. GET A NEW JOB, you say???  HAHA!!!! yeah, because that's happening for anyone right now. that's a good one.<br>  <br>  PLUS thank your friend for me....the fact that he's using so much insurance money and his once every two months visits is why WE GET TO PAY SO MUCH FOR HEALTHCARE.<br>  <br>  .....oh boy. the intelligence of Repubs is just amusing. |`|bVY81LJsaa	The current health care system is full of fraud and is only going to get worse as long as we continue to believe that insurance companies can handle our money better .

ce84d2b43eeaa43b06f1ec3a8a2c5910aa	These claims like many others the far right have made are false and misleading. What's true is that when a politician (McCain) have no legitimate issues or answers, they attack the person and encourage others to do it. This is just another such attack to take the peoples mind off the real issues. Go to this site and read the entire article. It will answer you question with a certainty. <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/citizen.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/cit...</a><br>  Strangely I answered this question a few days ago but can't find it among my answers.

But then again, tea-leaves could be wrong.|`|Y4Ye3OLOaa	Only people that believe it are the desperates. |`|tdQTZPI7aa	He was born in Hawaii, one of the fifty states.

He is stonewalling the effort instead of producing the documents. This issue will not be dismissed.

UCNPFSw8aa	Hey, I'm going to MEPS on Friday too! What branch are you planning on joining? I myself am a bit worried about MEPS (I hate doctors) and don't know what to expect. Well, good luck!|`|rF0zUeKvaa	Well, first you'll take your ASVAB if you haven't already taken it yet and from there you'll get your AFQT (score) and call your Recruiter to tell him/her what you got...also to check in that your doing okay mentally and physically...<br>  <br>  Then you'll be taken to some sort of hotel where you'll get paired with another girl that will probably be in the same branch...you'll relax for the night, eat a nice dinner, ATTEMPT to fall asleep (My night at MEPS I did not fall asleep for one minute, my allergies were killing me and I was probably more nervous than you, XD) ensuing the morning you'll have to wake up EXTREMELY early and you'll get on a shuttle that ventures to MEPS...from there you fill out barrages and barrages of paperwork, give blood for testing, urine sample, doctor comes in and checks out...er...what's going on down there...and so and so forth with exercises...my day wasn't as bad as I thought...just pay attention to details, KNOW your social security and be proud of your decision that your there...after the very long day you'll finally see your branch's Liaison (someone who tells you what jobs you qualify for, etc, etc...) and he'll ask you why you joined, what you want to accomplish...etc...and AFTER that...you'll get to the coup de grace...choosing your job...choose wisely don't just choose the flashy job with the sign-on bonus...after that you'll get some of your branch's goodies (back-pack, water bottle...shirt) and a good lunch then you'll go home with your Recruiter...<br>  <br>  Yeah, a mouthful...sorry for the wall-o-text here but that's basically what it is...Good luck, even with flat feet you'll do great! |`|0sMpo4dEaa	Ok please stay calm, you will do fine. You will do paperwork, urine sample, bloodtests, eye tests, duckwalks...and lots of other "fun"stuff. You will learn the art of patience, but make the most of it, its something you wont forget. I dont know about the feet thing, sorry, but i know you can get in with flat feet. The best of luck.|`|AA12384876	imma a dude, but i think everything similar. um ur gonna wake up at 3:30 if u stay at the hotle or arrive there in the morning via recruiter. ur gonna get on a bus n go down to the mapes station with all the other people. ur gonna wait outside in a long *** line n go through a metal detector n put all ur bags through screening. ur gonna set them ina  room and gonna go to a desk well there gonna give u some sticker that says ur intended branch name ect. then ur gonna get a lil breifing, a breathalizer test. after that, there gonna check ur hearing through a sireies of beep test, ur vision, depth perception, color ect. ur gonna have to do sometime of urine test. then ur gonna have to go talk with a doctor to make sure everythings alright(sux *** for dudes). gonna check if u can do certain things. just remeber every answer is gonne be "no, none ,never" then ur gonna have to do a bunch of stupid exersices including the duck walk, n the feet thing idk, every single one of us got marked down for that, so idk..i dont think its a big deal. n then u get ur contract, talk with a job consler, swear in and wait for ur recruiter. good luck. its not that bad, it suxs but its more boring than suxs justa  long wait...good luck!|`|bK3X99gPaa	You have nothing to worry about. Just be prepared to be very PATIENT. My MEPS lasted hours and hours, endless tests and paperwork. You have nothing to be scared of, I'm sure of it. Just remember to try your best think positive! Good luck!
oQZ0ktvCaa	It irritates me to a degree, but on the other hand, people vote the way they do for all sorts of reasons. I voted for a guy for my county board once solely based on the fact that he goes to my church. I didn't know the first thing about the guy, but I recognized his name when I saw it on the ballot. Obviously I'm a lot more informed about the presidential candidates, but some people aren't. Lots of people aren't that interested in politics/government, and there's no way to force interest. There is a large number of people who are informed, though, and it seems to me like more people are interested in this election than the previous one, so I see that as a good thing.|`|bkav003oaa	Some things annoy me - like people taking the time to repeat erroneous and inaccurate information about the candidates.|`|Wyt8vBPPaa	I agree to some extent. Canned answers are lame, but these "stereotypes" also tend to be true. In general people are voting for Obama because he represents a new, fresh face in politics and the possibility of change. McCain has been in office for a long time and while he has thought for himself on issues throughout his career he's still a Republican and will probably stick closer to the party line. |`|k6TjuQRdaa	what does annoy me is how many people have actually given specific reasons for obama....yet all i hear from republicans is a bunch of racist goo for reasons to not vote for obama.<br>  <br>  where's the good reasons to vote mccain????|`|p2AG6CnGaa	There are many people out there who are parrots and don't do research for themselves.  Get used to it.  People will never change.|`|jKWVulvraa	Nope. |`|Gu8oZNNTaa	It annoys me a lot.<br>  <br>  Obama will not bring any significant "change" to America - he won't be able to get anything done seeing as how the whole system is corrupt and we're in a huge financial mess.<br>  <br>  Also, McCain won't do anything to "reform" Washington. He said that Sarah Palin would "reform" DC politicians and whip them into shape - are you kidding me? <br>  <br>  Neither of these candidates‚Äô claims have any supporting arguments or real reason to believe them.
LVbP0j3saa	I agree, do as you feel and don't do as others do. The Marines I know are mostly in law enforcement when they get out, because they did not do anything but infantry.(that was all that was offered to them) The Navy has many high tech fields that will give you a broader level of opportunity when you part with service. One problem you may run into right now is that alot of people know that, and the Navy and Air force are full according to my nephew who just joined the army.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong I have alot of friends that are ex-marines and in combat they are the 1st to go and the last to know. semper fi ! marines<br>  <br>  Without all branches of service and the heart of the american fighting men and women - we would not be here today. No matter what job they provide: cook, water purification, medic, or infantry. They are all essential in the role they provide.<br>  <br>  You have to ask yourself what can I do and what do I want to do in the future. Think about that before you committ to any branch and diffantely before you see a recruiter. You sound young and they will tell you what you want to hear, to get you where they can put you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck...<br>  <br>  P.S.  to the gentleman above on the Coast Guard.<br>  <br>  The Coast Guard is currently patrolling harbors at home in their effort to stop terrorism. Plus in 2003, they were also in Iraq patrolling the waterways in bluewater(sea) and brownwater(rivers).|`|fa3d85cd6757cf3c69585e170182c5bfaa	 First, All branches of the military are in the war on terror, not just the Army or the Marines.<br>  <br>  Secondly, the only way that you can judge which branch is better is to actually have served in them. Marines are always going to say the Marines are better and Navy is always going to say that Navy is better.<br>  If you feel that the Navy is what is calling you, do it. If you would rather be in the Marines do that. The choice is really up to you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|ceTK41IIaa	I've been raised in a Marine family, and I can tell you that once you go in and finish boot camp and earn the title of a Marine, you will have accomplished something that NO ONE can tell you you didn't work for. You will have it to look back on and be proud of for all your life. If you want to learn more about the Marines, you can look at www.marines.com. They have very good information on everything they offer.|`|XrCSXJoYaa	All branches are deployed in support of the war on terror except for the coast guard, as far as I know. I don't know if it's true, but I've been told marines don't get to pick their job. Join the navy if that's what you want. It's a big decision, so don't go do something just to prove a point to other people.|`|7888f96d18d4c6c451be532960d1cdd0aa	If the Navy is what interest you then it should be the Navy you choose. Each branch of service is different but all work hard in one aspect or another. I grow up an Army brat and joined the Air Force. We all pick on the other branches but we all are out there doing our jobs .|`|fNaDL2D1aa	Well, Marine has the most restricted proportion of jobs for women. Navy also doesn't allow women to do many jobs. Army restricts too, but they have the most amount of jobs. <br>  <br>  I'd talk to a recruiter from each branch. See where you qualify. What do you want to do? Figure that one out first.|`|oNg8zGi8aa	I was in the military and unless you need a job real bad do not join .
398587d073be2044e73ae194ff808b61aa	Obama's just going to make sure that those who are his voter base don't ever get out of their current mindset that they can't do anything by making sure they wear that label of "victim" with pride.  Keep them trapped, blame Republicans, and it's a guaranteed voter demographic, because they continue to believe what the Democrats feed them.<br>  <br>  All the little sheeple get in line, ride to the slaughterhouse on the liberal stock trailer, and because there's a little sign that says "Republicans did this to you!" before they get to the actual slaughter, they blame them.  They don't look at who their actual shepherds were.<br>  <br>  Obama's part of the most ineffective and unpopular Congress EVER.  If he and his party were going to bring about CHANGE as they keep harping, then why haven't they?  They've had control of everything except the White House, and Bush didn't stand up to them all that often.  <br>  <br>  McCain/ Palin '08 because they're the lesser of the two evils.|`|k6TjuQRdaa	You're why we are in the mess we're in now. You're too dumb to pick up a newspaper, and obviously only get news from 5 minutes of FOX.....turn off your Reality Shows and actually try to educate yourself before opening your mouth.<br>  <br>  then again, go ahead, Vote for Obama if you truly believe these things. I just hope you're smart enough to be operating a vehicle on the same roads I'm driving on.|`|u4xSC0HCaa	All you have to do is let him have any money you make...  you know, if Obama wins, change is all we'll have!<br>  <br>  Obama has promised a lot that he can't give.  It's a wonder that people still listen.  Kerry was more genuine, and I didn't vote for him either.|`|n98LqKiBaa	Nope that's not what he's saying. You shouldn't listen to the cons they're called that for a reason.|`|uQlr6jUhaa	Yawn....<br>  <br>  Next.|`|G2auAv1Saa	Only if you're popping out kids. <br>  Don't even worry about the free college- smoke dope and enjoy yourself. |`|tP8W6Q1Qaa	LOL nope Obama won't but the taxpayers will! <br>  <br>  Sad thing is it is pretty darn close to being true. If you work you don't get hand outs. |`|6JQUIZFTaa	No.  That's just words..Obama has never followed through on a campaign promise.  Check his record.  Our government is flat broke, like the European government is too!  If Obama gets in, you will become one of the workers, just like in other Communist countries.  He is a Communist, plain and simple.  Go ahead and vote that Marxist in and I will see you on the labor crews, along with the rest of the sheep.|`|A0825FVZaa	Your question is Not a funny one. His voting base consists of people who actually think that to be true. He can only make promises, and those that he is making will be hard to fulf ill. Has anyone questioned, if he kept any campaign promises when he ran for Senator of Illinois?|`|sTwTXixXaa	I hope you use the "free" college.  Because you need it if you formulated an idea like that.|`|6mLj2x8Iaa	hmh no wonder you are republican. <br>  |`|8cee89129dada555e68d08fe2985fbd5aa	I hear Obama will have horse face fix dinner for you and wipe your @zz after you are finished , take you to school on their donkey, let you live in a run down camp and do not even think about getting ill because you wont be able to pay the bill, and do not be looking for money because you wont need it you are not getting any...|`|HNqBEllPaa	It's very true you should go to work, so you can pay your bills, go to college, and find ways to improve the medical insurance.|`|215JR99paa	That's not a very good reason to go for Obama, maybe you should look at his policies, actions, his visions!!<br>  That's why I'm going for Obama!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Obama/Biden .......... Get use to it!!|`|ba5ed5efc0a430ba83c52b6ed0224188aa	  You got to move to Iraq and hope Mccain wins.  Bush pays iraqis not to work and to be good citizens.  Mccain will keep us there and continue Bush's welfare plans.|`|AA10091004	Nope, sorry, you're going to have to get off your cellulite riddled @$$ and work like the rest of us. |`|PndL1lfcaa	He wants you to believe that. |`|zf1q8c1faa	haven't you heard!  he's going to throw people like you in jail, and use you as slaves!<br>  <br>  8-)|`|EGpDq57kaa	From what he says it's true<br>  <br>  <br>  MCCAIN/PALIN
vBwH8X8caa	One is available.  I cannot tell if you qualify for it.  If the Secretary of State denies it, you can petition the Circuit Court for one.  The Circuit Court cannot do anything until the Secretary of State denies an application, but sometimes the judge is more lenient than the bureaucrats.<br>  <br>  Generally, if you have a good job and it is a first offense, you can get a restricted license to drive between work and home without too much trouble.  If you are a repeat offender, or have had more trouble while your license is revoked, you're likely to have to wait a while for  a restricted license.  If you are a really bad apple who has not learned his lesson, you'll have to buy a bicycle.|`|C5UUltHtaa	What was it revoked for? My co-worker got his restricted license but it was only to drive to and from work to home. (Sterling Heights, MI) He was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol but still it took over a year on probation before they let him even drive restricted.
Qjb1qRbYaa	She was physically there and did an amazing job.  She was on the same stage with Tina at the same time and it was well done.  She later was on the News portion of the show and I could not stop laughing.  <br>  <br>  SNL had their highest ratings in 10 years.  This lady is a Rock Star!  Gets highest ratings of all the debates.  Got the highest ratings of any of the convention speaches (democrat or republican)  Gets the biggest crowds at any of the rally's on the campaigns.

Whimped out I think.<br>  They got the highest ratings cause people think she is an idiot and like to watch people screw up.

I don't know if I disagree with her appearing on a show like this, I always think that in order for someone who is being made fun of on a constant basis to end that, making fun of yourself is one of the best ways to do so. If you can laugh at yourself you are very disarming. She probably appealed to a few liberals with her appearance, maybe they'll vote for Palin now... lol<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|mvVhbY1Gaa	Yes she was there. Personally as a McCain supporter I do not approve of this. This country is facing some of the greatest troubles ever and these people are parading around on stage joking around. Millions of people are suffering as a result of these morons in office and they are cracking jokes wearing tuxedos at expensive dinners in NY city..

HELLO...<br>  GOD is here, and GOD is a part of this and he is watching , because we have freedom of choice, and we can choose to follow his word or NOT. If we choose wrong, we will suffer the consequences of our decisions. This Nation was built on Religious Freedom.<br>  Christians also have rights, and Christians are the majority in American. How can you be Christian and vote for someone who supports Abortion or Gay rights, when it is forbidden biblically?<br>  I will never understand that mentality.<br>  |`|bMiMBc1haa	I was always taught in school that our constitution requires the separation of church and state.  Maybe Dubya amended the constitution, but didn't feel he needed to inform the American people cause he's the decider.|`|niD66AbCaa	No, nowhere in the Constitution does it specifically state there is to be a separation of church and state.|`|K8Ca1sU3aa	If a candidate wishes to profess his or her faith during their campaigning, that's his or her right.

Yo have to be Christian in order to be president (they mad that clear bashing Obama bby lying saying he isn't) but you can't say prayer in school.  We no longer say in God we trust and we're even taking it off the money, yet you have to be Christian to be President.  How stupid does that sound??  Congress basically made Obama denounce a rapper named Ludacris for a song he wrote reffering to McCain.  The government never cared about rap!!! As many songs that were put out there, when they find out there's a black man running they care now...  Yeah the lyrics were wrong but did McCain denounce the KKK for guaranteeing that Obama would be killed...No! These are just some of the games politics play.|`|TYW2OQM5aa	No, the constitution doesn't prohibit free speech but I'm sure you'd just love to take free speech away from those Christians wouldn't you? <br>  Maybe when Obama gets in office he'll be able to Wright to help him get Christianity made illegal. <br>  <br>  Thanks for trying to take away the freedom of speech from others. <br>  <br>  Maybe they'll keep God Dam* America though. Just as a favor for Wright.|`|GFdppnFHaa	Read the Constitution, Amendment I: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof....."<br>  <br>  The kinds of things you mention aren't covered by the Establishment clause; they don't represent the government getting in the business of religion.   This isn't China or North Korea.   People here are free to say such things.  <br>  <br>  In our country free speech allows such things, just like it allows some nut in CA to hang a Sarah Palin dummy by the neck in his front yard.|`|Nzyxpo19aa	Please quote the passage of the Constitution that prohibits this. I guess I am ignorant of the Constitution, or I just missed the part that limits what a candidate (or anyone else) can say in public. In fact, I seem to remember some small piece of the Constitution that kind of, oh, I don't know, GUARANTEES a person the right to say whatever they want. But, then again, I'm no scholar.|`|8YjutSI2aa	no.. freedom.. freedom of speech.. we can say what we want.. do what we want.. if you want to not talk about God.. then you ignore it.. if people wanna say stuff about God then you gotta learn to accept it or learn to ignore it.. it's your problem.. not mine.. in the end, it will still be about God.. after you die.. you can come tell me what afterlife is like.. good luck on your afterlife.. Besides, America is founded by Christians and it is Christian nation.. if you don't like it, you can move to China for all I care.. under GOD is in the America pledge.. |`|OhoWnH7Daa	Because campaigns are about getting to know the candidate and their personal views...<br>  <br>  I for one want to know if a candidate has religious views that may interfere with rational thinking while in the execution of the office for which they are running.|`|MiB5fhePaa	Because we have the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which says that people, including campaigners can SAY what they want to say.  We can't institute a religion--the First Amendment also prohibits that.  But the candidates can SAY what they want to.|`|6mY1rIjdaa	The Constitution protects free speech, it doesn't prohibit it.  The political candidates are not speaking on behalf of the US Government, they are simply asking for your approval and vote.|`|08d154fda6c6ff1caf16d3e74e42e9a3aa	if its tax-payer funded, yes, but not if the statements have been dug up from videos of non-campaign related events.|`|rSTqDjxKaa	Do you have any clue about what you're talking about?|`|k6TjuQRdaa	because it's the only way Republicans can get the NON wealthy business owners to back them....|`|sGpEe35Haa	NO.Peace|`|G2auAv1Saa	No. The constitution protects freedom of speech and freedom of religion. <br>  The only thing they can't do is if elected they can't make everything believe their religion. |`|AA11622716	No, the constitution provides that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.  That means that no law can prohibit the candidate from saying whatever he damn well pleases.  The clause about religion applies to congress, not to individual members of the government.  While no law can prefer one religion over another, the individual members of the government can say whatever they please, as long as they don't pass laws the prefer religion or restrict speech.|`|ipWRgKetaa	No. The Constitution established freedom OF religion in the United States and protects our right not only to practice our religion but to speak of it as well. In fact, what you suggest or believe does two things. It suppresses free speech and it suppresses an American's freedom of religion. <br>  <br>  But this is typical of liberal thinking. Liberals want to use the Constitution to suppress rights, not protect them. And yet they see themselves as the tolerant ones. Pretty interesting.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	Candidates are allowed to be religious and to profess whatever religious viewpoint they want. They can say that god is behind anything. What they cannot do is say that they will try to change laws so as to base them on religion.|`|e2104bb6f4cd0597228a673340a9a643aa	No, the Constitution does not prohibit candidates for political office from talking about their religious beliefs.<br>  <br>  The separation of church and state refers to prohibiting our government from establishing an official religion.|`|35ZJauLkaa	Actually the constitution bans government from religion not religion from government

Hopefully in 7 years we will have mastered alternative fuel so that would be wasted money (see pickensplan.com)<br>  <br>  Do you really want the government managing health care seeing how they have managed to bankrupt the country and screw up the global economy. Sorry, I will take my chances with my PPO.<br>  <br>  Legalizing drugs in general would help the economy in more ways than you think. In addition to the extra funds from sales. We would break the drug lords, which would cut down on gangs and gang related crime. It also frees up all the prison space that we pay out the woo-hoo for that is holding the drug dealers. <br>  <br>  Flat tax is a good idea if you can come to an acceptable number. Obviously $10,000 in tax would break some ppl but for others it is pocket money.<br>  <br>  Cutting spending would be great. I would recommend the first cut be in forgein aid. If my kids and my neighbor kids are both starving, I am feeding my kids first. With all the problems we have in America (not to mention we are 11 TRILLION dollars in debt!) we need to start at home.<br>  <br>  Not fighting pointless wars is also a great idea. Refer back to pickensplan.com. If we don't need forgein oil we have options on how far we need to go and how much we need to put into it.|`|PKfh0jhLaa	There must be first and foremost an alert and informed population.<br>  Otherwise its hopeless!<br>  <br>  The Present administration has succeeded in Damaging AMERICA so seriously, that we will be hard pressed to recover.<br>  <br>  SAVE THE REPUBLIC! |`|NqNbIp2caa	1. - limited impact if any. Oil from drilling will not be available for decades and will not impact prices significantly.<br>  2. - possibly a small impact from reduced imports if it is legal to grow locally and some tax revenue along with reduced policing costs.<br>  3.- negative impact. A flat tax means moving the tax burden from the rich to the poor. The poor have the highest propensity to spend and the lowest propensity to import. The rich will not spend additional money, nor will they invest it in an already overcapitalized economy.<br>  4. - this is debatable. We do have a population significantly less healthy than many of our peer nations - and spend a far greater proportion of our income on healthcare than any other nation. As such benefits will come from a healthier workforce and more money spent on other sectors - assuming we can successfully model the best elements of what others do.<br>  5. It would depend largely what spending. Despite the denials of conservatives public spending DOES contribute to the economy. In an overcapitalized economy government spending can direct money into unutilized capital (look at the money Halliburton makes off the public sector).<br>  6. Agree with this.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	You are all over the place with this list.  How can one have Universal Health Care and cut spending?  Universal Health Care would bust the budget for good.  America has never fought a pointless war.  A Flat Tax done correctly is a great idea.  Drilling for oil and gas as well as building nuclear reactors is the only way to insure energy independence.  Legalizing Marijuana would be a nightmare.  There is no way to control it.

Your list is really good side the Universal Health care and legalizing marijuana. <br>  <br>  Socialist Health care=High Taxes, and a burdened system <br>  <br>  Legalizing marijuana despite some very convincing arguments out there for its legalization, I think would be a bad idea. When people are doing weed there is always the loss of motivation to be a productive person involved. People who smoke weed tend to loose motivation and tend to get lazy and start not caring about important things in life. Also you know there are going to be people who are going to go overboard on weed and do stupid stuff. Legalizing weed does have its economic advantages but overall more people are going to loose motivation and more people are going to do stupid things as a result of it.

scuxVXGMaa	As an air-to-air platform, the F-22 was built to be second to none.  It is the only aircraft either flying, or on the drawing boards, that commands a decisive advantage in:<br>  - low observables (stealth)<br>  - sustained supercruise<br>  - agility<br>  - sensor fusion<br>  <br>  No other airplane combines all of these advantages into one package.  The F-35 for example, will combine stealth, and sensor fusion to rival those of the Raptor.  But it is an air-to-ground weapon first, and an air-to-air fighter only second.  It will not come close to the Raptor in terms of either supercruise capabilities, or raw agility.  Similarly, the Eurofighter Typhoon commands an impressive thrust-to-weight ratio and excellent wing loading, providing with with agility in a dogfight that could easily rival that of the Raptor.  It does not, however, command the same kind of supercruise capability when loaded with missiles, nor can it be mistaken for a stealth design, nor has its sensor suite yet been developed to the point where it could compare to that of the Raptor.<br>  <br>  The one gap that does still remain in the Raptor's suite of air dominance capabilities, is the absence of a helmet-mounted sight and high off-boresight missile combination.  This is an acknowledged shortcoming.  Many of the older USAF and USN fighters are in the process of being retrofitted with the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), which when operated in conjunction with the AIM-9X high off-boresight missile provides them with a decisive advantage in many visual range engagements.<br>  <br>  The F-35 will be the first aircraft to be mounted with the next generation Helmet Mounted Display System, which will feature a binocular display and a wider field of view than its predecessor.  It was always planned that the F-22 would eventually be retrofitted with the HMDS.  Until this happens, however, this will remain the one element of its sensor suite where the newer F-35 will have an advantage over its older sibling.|`|uurgL3oZaa	The F-22 also has vectored thrust so it can turn a lot tighter.|`|ZhNCvhqSaa	Considering the F-15 was designed and developed in the 60's and 70's, that's like asking if an old Lamborghini Miura could outperform a Lambo Gallardo LP560-4.<br>  <br>  The F-15 is my favourite fighter jet (closely followed by the F-4), but the new generation of planes are just so much more capable in pretty much every aspect. They're more reliable, more fuel efficient, they're quicker accelerating and faster, more maneuverable at high and low speeds, they have far more advanced weapons and avionics, the pilot support systems allow higher human performance thresholds, there really is pretty much no place where an older plane has an advantage, except in cost.

kELOzS8Faa	Does electing Obama count as a terrorist attack?|`|Kmrl0FX8aa	I wouldn't be surprised. Supposedly 911 has a bunch of conspiracy surrounding it. I think a president would allow it to make himself look better when he does something to retaliate.|`|WZYri1Aoaa	Does the government have the legal right to commit terrorist attacks?  Not as such-- the Constitution is pretty explicit in its condemnation of violently oppressive government, and the second amendment was written explicitly for the purpose of allowing "the people" to overthrow an unjust oppressive ruling body (that is why the second amendment was WRITTEN... that is NOT why we still HAVE it, by the way).<br>  <br>  Having said that, there are lots of legal ways the government (federal, state, sometimes local) can "oppress" people for various reason and get away with it.  It was perfectly legal to oppress African Americans in the American South in the 1950s.  It was wrong, but it was legal.  Eventually the practice of formal oppression was legally abolished.<br>  <br>  A better question: WOULD the government commit a terrorist attack on America?  Hm...  You could argue that when Roosevelt allowed the Japanese to bomb Pearl Harbor (which he did, and everybody knows it, though he was a great president) he was acting like a "terrorist": he allowed a lot of innocent sailors to be killed in order to jump-start US involvement in WW II.  If he had not done so, the Allies might very well have lost the war.  Could he have prevented it?  Almost certainly.  Do his ends justify his means?  Now, THAT is a more philosophical question.  Was he a "terrorist"?  Was it "legal" for him to ignore the incoming Japanese planes?  It was perfectly legal.  And America entered the war.  What counts as terrorism?  Pearl Harbor finally made America feel afraid of a very real enemy, one to the east and one to the west.  Granted, Roosevelt didn't launch the Japanese planes.  But the outcome was the same as if he had: P.H. galvanized an indifferent America, at long last.  Call it terrorism if you want to.  I call it extremely difficult decision making.  <br>  <br>  No, the government does not have the legal right to terrorize its own citizens.  Does it have many tools at its disposal to produce the same effect?  Certainly.

He has great, novel ideas that will uplift America from its roots and restore our standing in the world. He will work to unite ALL Americans regardless of race, gender, faith, lack of faith, political party, etc. He is about creating justice and opportunity for all. Obama wants us to be more involved and care for others as we care for ourselves. Here is a good quote from Obama:<br>  <br>  "In the end, then, what is called for is nothing more, and nothing less, than what all the world's great religions demand -- that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. Let us be our brother's keeper... Let us be our sister's keeper. Let us find that common stake we all have in one another, and let our politics reflect that spirit as well."|`|AA11634525	@ Patty582---All polls show that Obama is best suited for president as the economy is our #1 issue.

We're in a country where:<br>  <br>  A) the least conservative first name any President has had is Ronald.  <br>  <br>  B) We have never had a president without an English, Scottish, German, Dutch or (recently) Irish surname. <br>  <br>  Names matter.  I've said from the beginning that Obama's name will work against him on a subconscious level more than any other factor.  I honestly think that may be why people are trying so hard to make him Kenyan or Indonesian in their minds.

a5fb058c06535370bbdc0e9afa7e3ab3aa	1) He is an extension of the Bush white House Policies<br>  2) He had been associated with Banking deregulation in the 1980's which resulted in the S&L fiasco that cost us $124 BILLION to bail out.Associated with the deregulation of the banking industry with the likes of his economic czar- Phil Gramm. Result $700 Billion to bailout ( sound familiar)<br>  3) His behavior is off. Look at his reaction to this financial crisis. First the fundamentals of the economy are strong, then 2 hours later, we are in crisis. he suspended his campaign and then claimed he was not going to debate, then he went to the debate, claimed he was not "phoning it in" yet that was what he did. claimed victory for the House passing the bill on Monday ( oops).<br>  4) he chooses a running mate based on a single phone call. No regards as to her "experience" and possibly being one heart beat away from the nuclear codes of this nation. HIs judgment is a definite problem.<br>  5) He is dishonest. He claims he supports the environment, yet his voting record shows he has voted against almost every initiative out there to research alternative fuels, clean up the Everglades in FL. Claims he suports veterans yet he is on record voting against supporting vietnam veterans.He claims credit for trying to regulate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. If people dug deeper they would see<br>  a) He never wrote any part of the legislation. <br>  b) The legislation would have weakened if not remove all regulations that had been  in place<br>  c) The bill was shelved by the Republican led committee in June 2005. John McCain signed on the bill May 25, 2006 11 months later.<br>  6) He is demeaning to women in that he has made jokes about a woman being raped by an ape, voted against equal pay for equal work and voted against the violence against women's act .<br>  7) His health care plan can put an additional 20 million people into the ranks of the  uninsured. His plan calls for a $5000 tax credit to replace a $12000 insurance plan from an employer <br>  8) His economic plan stinks. Less regulation, more tax breaks for the rich|`|pXg0SqiSaa	1. He used to be a centrist, but now he is as far right as you can go.<br>  2. He has an issue with telling the truth.<br>  3.He is very much PRO war, and we can't afford another war as a country.<br>  4. He keeps spouting off on how the surge WORKED, well if it worked why are our troops still there.<br>  5. He executed horrible judgment in picking Sarah Palin, which only adds to my list because I couldn't vote for anyone that picked her.<br>  6. He is running his campaign in ways he said he wouldn't.<br>  7. He is weak on the economy, obviously stating he knows nothing about it<br>  8. He is weak on Immigration.<br>  9. His stance on the war needs to change, but he can't admit he was wrong.<br>  10. Keating 5.<br>  11. He votes against veterans.<br>  12. He is number one on the list of senate members missing votes. He missed 420 votes out of 655.<br>  13.He opposed the Equal Pay Bill for Women, Said They ‚ÄòNeed Education and Training‚Äô Instead. This is humorous and I am a Man.<br>  <br>   I have a lot of respect for the man concerning his service in Vietnam, but I don't think he is fit as President. As a Republican I could name off numerous politicians that I would vote for over Obama, but John McCain is not on that list. My points list is much larger if I include my other smaller issues with McCain and my issues with Palin.|`|AA12048731	Did you know McCain was still married to his recently injured first wife,when he abandoned her to marry Cindy?<br>  <br>  In early 1980, John McCain was a man in transition -- and in a hurry. <br>  <br>  Nine months earlier, at a cocktail reception in Hawaii, he met a glamorous young heiress named Cindy Lou Hensley and, by all accounts, fell instantly in love. McCain spent months flying from Washington to Arizona pursuing this new relationship. Soon, the 43-year-old naval attache and his 25-year-old sweetheart were engaged. <br>  <br>  There was only one complication: McCain was still married. <br>  <br>  Carol Shepp McCain, then 42, had endured much in more than 14 years of marriage to John. She had raised their three young children alone while her husband languished in a North Vietnamese prison camp for 5 1/2 years. Her tribulations grew immeasurably after a near-fatal car accident that immobilized her for months and left her scarred for life. Despite their reunion and physical rehabilitation, by the late 1970s the McCains' marriage had begun to crack, as John engaged in what he later termed "dalliances" with other women. <br>  <br>  Now it was being torn apart by his relationship with Cindy Hensley. McCain didn't hesitate in bringing his marriage to a swift end. <br>  <br>  According to public records, he and Cindy received a marriage license in Maricopa County, Ariz., in early March 1980, four weeks before his divorce from Carol was final. A judge in Florida dissolved the McCains' marriage April 2, entering a default judgment after Carol failed to respond to three court summonses. John and Cindy were wed six weeks later, on May 17. <br>  <br>  This rapid-fire sequence of events raises a question about John McCain's path to the White House: Would he be where he is today had he not changed his life, and his wife, when he did? <br>  <br>  <br>  washington post 10/5/08<br>  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con..." rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con...</a>|`|edf9eaf4edead5f2cc34733a4e2e9d47aa	-Inconsistent on energy issues.<br>  -Voted for and still supports the war that has been proven to be a lie.<br>  -Lack of economic aptitude. <br>  -Represents a fading portion of America.<br>  -Near death (I'm serious, that is an issue).<br>  -Endangered America by choosing Palin, who has absolutely no foreign policy experience, or any other experience. <br>  -Has a well-known temper.<br>  -No plan on healthcare.<br>  -Continue Bush education policies.<br>  -His use of smear tactics and race baiting.<br>  -His campaign has tons of lobbyists.<br>  -He isn't a maverick.<br>  -Continue failed Bush Doctrine.<br>  -Threats against Iran.<br>  -Unwillingness to engage in diplomacy.<br>  -Political grandstanding at the expense of our economy.<br>  The list goes on...|`|QH6KUKxlaa	he wants to overturn roe v. wade<br>  his track record (and sarah palin's) indicates he does not respect the rights of the gay community<br>  sarah palin<br>  he has not differentiated his policies from bush in any real manner<br>  he wants to cut taxes for the wealthy again<br>  there is no foreseeable end to the war with him as president<br>  he doesn't have a solid energy plan to turn around this country's dependence on foreign oil<br>  he does not support environmental issues<br>  he will cut funding for the national forest service<br>  <br>  i could go on and on, but i'll stop here|`|AA10699687	I don't like him mostly because of his stance on the war, alternative energy, and because he picked Palin.

He is proving that he is capable of doing anything to win no matter how vile, no matter how dishonest.  He threw a desperation pass on the VP choice.

WPXxQTnCaa	This depends on if you are a regular reservist or a 90 day reservist.  If you don't know, chances are you're a regular reservist.<br>  <br>  90 day reservists are college students who can go to boot camp over the summer, then the next summer they go to SOI (School of Infantry).  They are called this because they don't spend more than 90 days activated.<br>  <br>  If you are a regular reservist, you will go home on 10 days leave after boot camp, you will be given the oppurtunity to take Recruiter's Assistance for an additional 10 days, then after that you will go to SOI for two months.  Once you have completed SOI, you will go home, get nasty, and enjoy 28 days of liberty each month.

8RflQ9DVaa	He was someone that talked to Obama at one of his rallies. Then, at the last debate John McCain brought him up 22 times trying to make Obama look bad. The media went crazy. Joe's real name is Sam, he owes back taxes and isn't what he said he was. Turns out he's not a licensed  plumber, but a plumbers helper. There is some talk that he is related by marriage to Charles Keating, but after some research I'm not sure if that's true. He got his 15 minutes of fame and McCain is probably sorry he ever brought him up. In any case.... you didn't miss much..|`|EFwElvRhaa	A regular guy, who had the unmitigated nerve to ask Obama a question about his tax plan when Obama was campaigning in the street in front of Joe's house.  <br>  Joe didn't go looking for Obama, Obama came to Joe.  When Obama answered his question he told him he felt it was a good thing to spread the wealth around, so too bad for you Joe, but you will be taxed more if you make more money.<br>  It was all taped, so, when Obama's response backfired because people don't like the idea of working hard, and then having their money taken to redistribute it to those with leaden behinds, Obama and his crew started ripping into Joe and digging up any and all dirt they could to cause a distraction.<br>  That response was easier for Obama than trying to explain what he meant by his socialist answer.<br>  <br>  Definitely a way to discourage anyone from asking a pointed question.  Ask and you will be destroyed!!|`|k6TjuQRdaa	someone the Republican party tried to use to gain the "typical American voter"....<br>  <br>  they goofed as he hasn't paid his taxes. lol!!!|`|fBvhkalFaa	Sorry Republicans, he doesn't represent this average American.  i pay my taxes and don't lie about buying a business.|`|kq6sdjXuaa	A dumb meathead.|`|c3DHTyeZaa	The guy who outed Obama's socialist leanings ("Spread the wealth around").

DQlZIzAFaa	late-term pregnancy. some states define it as a human child at 6 months, others define it as a human child at conception. most abortions take place in the first three months when the baby could not have survived outside the womb. in fact, 6 months is when it can (with medical help, of course), so that's why Laci's child was a "human" and not just a fetus, she was i think 8 months or so?|`|c425bd77add075a97bdceeb9591a73bbaa	In CA, abortion is legal in the first trimester, and only in special cases after that.<br>  <br>  Laci Peterson was in the last trimester when she was murdered.  So it was considered a double homicide since the baby was developed enough to survive ex-utero, outside the womb.|`|B4O3f8w6aa	You have to have an understanding of the law. Abortion is legal, and murder is not. Only a Mother has the right to decide.|`|YJnj54tHaa	Yeah, I don't have an answer for this besides the legal system loves to throw itself in loops. However,  I agree with your message.|`|Yq5Fg85Waa	He killed his own child, he chose to do so, his wife had no say in the matter, the mother chooses to have an abortion not to have he boyfriend , husband kill them!|`|wQMWeiHxaa	That's a good question. Maybe because the mother did not give consent.|`|AA11622716	A homicide of a fetus is possible only if the fetus is viable - capable of living outside the womb.  That is also when abortion becomes illegal.  If you see something inconsistent there, it is because you don't understand the law surrounding homicide or abortion.|`|ZzHE0lvtaa	If I remember right, I believe they deemed his unborn son Connor to have been viable to live outside the womb, I think she was close to delivery when she was murdered.  
vIO2jWu9aa	as an AMERICAN, you should vote for McCain|`|AA10811674	I guess that if you only voted for Christians who observed all the tenets you wouldn't be able to vote for anyone.

Did God outlaw self-defense, of self or country, or third person? <br>  <br>  Since you bring up Christianity, what about "eye for an eye"?<br>  <br>  Ending a threat from those who would harm us or other innocents is a far cry above feticide and infanticide. <br>  <br>  As a Christian can you vote for a person who believes death of the unborn is a "choice"? His own state, IL, defines a human being as anything past conception, in their murder laws. <br>  <br>  That is, if you don't think you have to come out of the birth canal to<br>   be "human". If so, c-section babies are free game. Or if you don't think you have to go all 40 weeks...if so, premies are fair game. Let's say life begins when the heart beats....that's 4 weeks past ovulation...or 2 weeks past a missed period.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	You are an embarrassment to this country<br>  <br>  People like McCain are the reason you have the right to express your idiotic views<br>  <br>  Do me a favor, go to any base in America and call the service men and women " murderers"<br>  <br>  Have someone videotape it as I want to see you searching the ground for your teeth|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	I don't care who you vote for, just keep your religion OUT of my government !!!|`|9ujT56Maaa	War happens.  We're only a few centuries removed from when the church itself started massive wars against non-believers.  I don't think you can equate the killing in war to killing on the street.  Every true Christian would fight to the death to defend what they believe, why should we begrudge it when people do the same for nationalistic reasons?|`|9L3nbXl4aa	Due to the evil present in the world, war is neccessary at times to protect our freedoms. Lets take this scenario more personally: if some gang came into your neighborhood and took it over, and started torturing and killing your friends and family, would you just say, oh well, I'll just let it happen. I don't think so.|`|1fb7aea767ff3f9acc21f4f310b2ee94aa	Mr McCain was acting upon orders from his senior officers who were acting in defense of our country.<br>  There is nothing in the Bible, either Old or New Testaments regarding actions on orders from higher authority.<br>  All power given on Earth is of God, therefore, no problem in voting for the right candidate, Senator McCain.<br>  <br>  |`|SS1VReF0aa	Abortion kills more than war.<br>  <br>  War is killing someone that wants to kill you.

McCain and Schwarzenhagger where the ones who passed the assysnine laws that made it legal for homosexual marriages which is why the Muslims had a problem with San Francisco.  I helped bring and a few all American friends helped bring about the salvation of San Francisco.  There was a terrorist plot to blow up San Francisco with a giant bomb, this was thwarted by understanding that men don't marry men like that, and women don't marry women like that.  Peace comes through understanding.  If you work against your enemy you work against your enemy.  It is okay to be Christian but keep in mind that there are others on this great earth that follow other beliefs and to respect those as well.  The belief that McCain committed adultery I know nothing about but if he did he most likely has a form of Jhondis due to the nature of this STD.<br>                                        -Vote for Tom Thunderhorse<br>                                         Paid for by my brother<br>  <br>  |`|4v1keWo1aa	Consider two tenets of our Chrisian beliefs.

How could he joke and sing about bombing Iran?<br>  <br>  And Palin uses her faith just like she uses her little baby--as a stage prop.<br>  <br>  |`|DypTl9Zdaa	How in God's name can you actually post such an ignorant question.  In a time of war it is not considered killing.  He was doing what his President, his Commander in Chief told him to do (who was a Democrate by the way).  He was fighting for our freedoms and for his country.

And he should be respected for that. There is a difference between illegal and rogue act and something done in the line of duty. I personally do not feel that Christian principles would be against such action. <br>  <br>  An example of something against would be: Senator Stevens. If he really took bribe and stole (essentially) then I would not vote for him.<br>  <br>  By the way, I am not Christian. And otherwise I am not McCain supporter.|`|VW0l6UcBaa	Being a Christian doesnt mean you should or should not vote for somebody.  You should vote for somebody based on what they believe vs what you believe.  Nobody should ever say, "Christians shouldn't vote for Obama" or "Christians shouldn't vote for McCain".  You should look at their issues and decide, "Is this who I want running my country?"  and "Does this guy/girl meet up with my own beliefs and values?"  <br>  <br>  About the "killing people" thing.  If you are a Christian, you most likely believe in the Holy Bible.  Several times in the Holy Bible.  GOD, told his people to enter a city and kill every living thing within.  War is not murder.  War is sometimes necessary and quite appropriate depending on the situation.  I'm sorry if you disagree, but those bombs that McCain dropped on those people probably saved as many or more innocent people than those that died.    It sucks but that's the way it is.  <br>  <br>  If you walk into an alleyway and stab somebody for thier purse, that's murder.  <br>  <br>  If you kill your spouse for cheating on you, that's murder.<br>  <br>  If you are lying in bed at night and somebody breaks into your house with the intent to steal your property and/or hurt/kill your family; and opt to defend yourself and your family but while you're struggling with the person he/she ends up dying.  That's not murder.  That's defending you and yours.  <br>  <br>  If you are a soldier and your country is at war with another country and you are ordered to kill someone or have to kill someone in defense of your own life and your country.  That's not murder.  That's warfare.  |`|AA11446519	most christians are not very "christian like"<br>  <br>  CAT said, "So in your scenario, all veterans are murders" can we define murder?  what is murder in one scenario is justifiable in another.<br>  if you sat in an ambush in the jungle waiting for an person to come along, in the free fire zone and you shot and killed that person, maybe that is justifiable, but if you sat in the same ambush and waited for a particular person to come along and then you shot and killed that person is that premeditated murder or justifiable? <br>  <br>  hard  to say it depends on the situation every time.  john McCain dropped bombs to make the enemy quit doing what they were doing. If what they were doing was defending their country was that right or wrong?  hard to say. |`|SRvCbAWlaa	McCain and all who fought in the Vietnam war were in no way "protecting our country".<br>  <br>  And it is a well know fact that most of the people who died and suffered in that war were innocent civilians.  North Vietnam did not threaten our country in any way.   We jumped into a war that did not affect us because of the politics.<br>  <br>  Because of this war, many babies died.  <br>  <br>  Religion should not color your vote.

Right now, only those who had an approved application from before April 2004 are being given their residency visa.<br>  <br>  You can shorten the waiting period by becoming a US citizen; which means your wife wouldn't need a visa number.

Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity ... will respect the less important and arbitrary ones ...

To arm the citizens so they could overthrow their government when it ceased to represent them.  Knowing this, it is obvious why a corrupt leader or government would seek to abolish the second amendment which reads in part "the right to bear arms shall not be infringed."  Infringed means to encroach or trespass.  That means NO LAWS REGARDING WEAPONS ARE CONSTITUTIONAL.  ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION, IF YOU CAN BUILD A NUKE.  IT IS YOURS.|`|AK4Iw118aa	I got a very good question for you.<br>  If you believe in such reasoning then why do you have a problem with abortion ?

BUT...I'm also pro choice.<br>  Both of my positions have one important thing in common : freedom.|`|QM2A6rBlaa	In the anti gunners eyes it will accomplish everything. They think all crime will magicly just stop. Never mind that gun ownership in this country is at an all time high, yet in preliminary FBI statistics for 2008, crime is continuing on it's downswing.<br>  <br>  Never mind the fact that in every state that has enacted a right to carry law, violent crime has been reduced...every one. Florida which had he first, saw a huge reduction in crime, and quit tracking the number of crimes commited by people liscenced to carry after two years, because the numbers were so low they were not worth tracking.<br>  <br>  Never mind the fact that guns are used in self defense far more each year then they are to commit crimes, so guns actually help more   people protect themselves each year.<br>  <br>  Never mind that the strict gun laws emposed in Chicago and D.C. have done nothing to deter violent crime, and the crime rate in each city actualy jumped drasticly after people were banned from owning handguns.<br>  <br>  All of these are facts, easily verifiable by looking at FBI statistics vs availibility of guns, yet facts and truth are the nemesis of the anti gunners. They only have emotion and lies to rely on. The asssault rifle ban is a joke, as assault style weapons before the clinton ban were only used in 2% of crimes commited with guns. Yeah really kept the streets safe. In reality right to carry laws have done more to curb crime then anything, and this has been verified by interviews wih prison inmates. 30-40% said they have abandoned potential victims for fear the person was armed.<br>  <br>  Count is typical of the anti gunners...no facts and cannot even anwer a simple question that can't be anwerd with "guns kill people".<br>  <br>  I see many of the other anti gun slogans here also..<br>  <br>  It will cut down on accidental shooting deaths of children? Wrong<br>  How many kids drown each year because they are not supervised?<br>  Are we going to outlaw swimming pools?<br>  How many are hit by cars because parents aren't paying attention?<br>  <br>  It will keep them from re arming...lol stupidity<br>  <br>  Guns are meant to last along time..it is very hard to break one. Also what is to keep criminals from smuggling in weapons? They do it with drugs, so why not weapons. Laws are only effective at stopping law abiding citizens from doing the wroong thing, they have never stopped criminals.<br>  <br>  I will use slew as an example as the knowledge of the typical anti gunner- "Automatics are illegal in california" Guess what they are illegal in the whole united states, unless you have a very expensive special liscence...you probably meant semi-automatic, there is a difference.<br>  <br>  Semi auto's must be legal, because you talk about the "first 3 clips"...guess what semi auto's are the guns that use clips, so either they are legal or you were breaking the law.<br>  <br>  "shooting sideways seems to have an advantage for the target" lol the only thing studider then shooting this way would be upside down.<br>  <br>  However I have yet to meet a anti gunner that can argue usin facts from an indipendent source, like the FBI, and not just "guns kill people" type statements, which are easily countered with logic.

It is much easier to force policy and take control of a country in which the populace is not armed.<br>  <br>  Our forefathers wrote the 2nd amendment not so that we could defend ourselves against criminals, but so we could defend ourselves against the government attempting to take rule of this country from the PEOPLE. An armed populace is much more difficult to subdue than an unarmed populace.<br>  <br>  You will be told that you are safer without guns, it is for your own good, things will be better, trust us.

It might be a reason to excuse a foreigner for his opinion, isn't it? The main problem as I can see it is that it is extremely difficult to keep a balance between multiculturalism IN the country and to effectively promote its own national interests abroad. If considerable proportion of the population identifies itself with a different cultural, religious, linguistic and political tradition it inevitably leads to the conflict of interests so to say. You can never be too multicultural, too politically correct. You are always asked to make one step more again and again. Absolute, complete cultural tolerance has an opposite effect; instead of uniting people it divides them. It takes away a sense of the country and unity turning the country into a transit area of an airport. Where are you flying to, passengers?|`|fyhl3TQgaa	Not the laughing stock, surly?

But, definitely leave his mom out of out. She might be upset initially that you didn't resolve this with her outside of court, but in the end it really comes down to the two of you, and if he's 20, then he's a big boy and needs to take care of his own problems/debts. <br>  <br>  Good luck.

In no way would I expect or accept any payment from her; (this is something her son did).  I would tell his mom that I would like to maintain a friendly (or the same) relationship that we have with her and any other family members I knew.<br>    -I would talk to my friend and tell him I feel awful he made the decision to handle this the way he did.  I would not tell him anything you heard or learned from the discussion with his mother.  I would not say too much but rather take the high ground.  I would not want my friend to feel pressured and then make another promise he most likely break.  Frankly I would say very little and cut the conversation off as politely and quickly possible.   <br>  <br>  In my mind our relationship has changed from friend to acquaintance.   Going forward I'd always be civil but he has taken himself off the short list.    <br>  Being an adult is about age but as you are experiencing behavior is what actually defines adulthood. <br>  <br>  The used Xbox 360 from a business stand point, homeowners insurance‚Äôs deductible will not cover it, you‚Äôve tried collecting.

g5pLCOm3aa	how about a STIMULUS bill instead of a SPENDING bill...<br>  <br>  how about a bill without PORK AND WORTHLESS EARMARKS?<br>  <br>  how about letting the economy just "play out"<br>  instead of deepening our debt...? I know thats not an option at this point but just saying...<br>  <br>  I am not an economic specialist but I do have common sense.|`|y3XaJhhAaa	People love to complain about the porkulus, but that's the only way.<br>  <br>  We're in a major problem with unemployment, and consumer confidence. <br>  <br>  Millions are unemployed, and millions are using their benefits to get a check every week. Its draining money, state by state. Putting every state in major debt.<br>  <br>  The only solution for the unemployment is to hire more people. But how do we do that? We have to spend money to employ them. With no money, people can't be hired.<br>  <br>  The second thing that's a huge problem is consumer confidence. People tend to be more conservative with their money now. They are afraid to lose their job, and with the rising prices on everything due to inflation.<br>  <br>  If our government would encourage people out market was OK so they'd spend more, our situation would be a lot better, but not completely out of the woods.<br>  <br>  There is no other way to get out of this problem besides spending massive amounts of money into our work force. Republicans believe tax cuts for Americans would stimulate the economy, but we've been doing that for years and its not working. WE can't keep doing stuff that won't work, trying something different is the only way to get closer to the solution.|`|PtRmhxU9aa	I'm thinking that a significantly smaller bill with less pork could have been used to entice US companies that send much of their operations overseas to bring the jobs back into THIS country. This could even have helped the auto manufacturers - who have many of the parts made outside the US and only assemble the parts here. The plan would have to include (as the current plan seems not to) strict guidelines as to how the money is to be spent to improve the businesses/employ Americans... no exec bonuses, and no stock-piling of the capital like the banks did.|`|Z5QL6THYaa	It is in a coma.

The U.S economy is based on consumerism. When the last stimulus package was given out the majority of people paid off debt or banked the money. If another stimulus package is given to the general public, it should be given in the form of a debit card. <br>  <br>  In the past during tough economical times the U.S. fell back on it's strong manufacturing industry. While most countries protect their industries, we look at ours in terms of profit to share holders only. <br>  <br>  People will never be satisfied with a small steady profit on their investments, instead they will look for the largest profit no matter how foolish or outlandish when compared to the markets average return over time.

Always a bad idea.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Leaving the extremely, EXTREMELY, expensive Iraq and Afghanistan wars, then raising taxes, and moving all money saved and/or earned toward paying down the National Debt.<br>  <br>  <br>  But since Bush trapped us in Iraq for at least a few more months yet, and Republicans trapped us in Afghanistan by not getting Bush to focus on terrorists instead of personal vendettas and oil, the plan I just laid out is fairly unrealistic.  It is the right move, but can't really be done.<br>  <br>  Obama's plan is the only other plan with a chance of working.  The Republican plan has already been proven a failure under both the George H.W. Bush Administration and the George W. Bush Administration.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, while people took Ronald Reagan at his word that he'd shrink government; he actually came in number 3 on the biggest spenders list.  And while he did lower taxes on everyone his first year in office, he raised taxes on everyone (except the top 1%) each successive year after that.  In fact, the tax rates under Reagan's entire time in office were higher than the tax rates under Clinton's entire time in office.  Yet both presided over pretty awesome times in the economy.<br>  <br>  So apparently higher taxes do work, as long as the money is invested wisely.  Since Obama is investing in the American worker and the American economy that Republicans and Democrats alike both believe in, I believe that would count as spending it wisely.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Add-on:<br>  <br>  And for the record, the stimulus bill was actually on 2% pork.  Now the new homeowners assistance bill coming down the line has significantly more pork in it; but unfortunately it is mostly Republican pork.  Republicans wouldn't back the bill unless that pork was left in it.<br>  <br>  Rather ironic, don't you think, that Republicans fought tooth and nail against a bill that was only 2% pork, but now won't back a bill that is nearly all pork (mostly because it is their pork)...|`|hv3gyI9Eaa	two ways the first is very,very easy,but is hard,we have to put in jail all the people who mess whit our future and take the money they use in politicians and bad people ?the next way is the one avaliable for all is put more good money in the hand of bad politicians and bad people.,they control our future?|`|AA11819105	Drill for u.s. oil build nuke power plants build oil refinery's and then give every tax payer 10,000$.

Ignoring the influences of property/money and an economy based on the most lowly, inhumane practices (slavery, etc)....the USA's democracy was still true to the cause.   <br>  <br>  America's democracy has NEVER been even within earshot of perfect, but it wasn't assembled by force.   It wasn't pinned together under duress, nor did it require props or puppets.<br>  <br>  You probably can't use that for your report, but those are just my recent thoughts.|`|RYQ3i0ZNaa	Well, to put it simply, when Saddam was in power the people of Iraq had very few civil rights. Now he's not around, they have the same rights you and me would expect - freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, the right to an education, equality etc. etc.<br>  <br>  One specific example: when Saddam was around you could not criticise the government - if you did you risked prison, or even being killed. Now, you can criticise the Iraqi government as much as you like (i.e. freedom of speech). Also, before there were no free and fair general elections - even when elections were held, Saddam would always win. Now everyone can vote, in secret elections, where you are not punished for choosing to vote for the opposition.|`|lVKwnFvjaa	The Iraqi Government can legislate as many high and mighty civil rights as it wishes - they are of little use to a citizen confronted by a terrorist armed with a Kalashnikov or scimitar and they can not help a person annihilated in a suicide bomb attack. Saddam, for all his faults, at least kept the country under control, and the only people who incurred his wrath were those whose agenda was different to his - mostly, as I understand it, members of the Shiite sect pressing for an Islamic republic.<br>  <br>  Saddam at least kept Iraq looking West, not East. The eventual upshot of the Invasion will be, however, "Iraq, the carbon copy of Iran"!<br>  <br>  Vivre le incursion? NON!|`|lYkvps54aa	Because America re wrote the Iraqi constitution and put their own people in power.|`|jWTZfP4naa	people lost the right not to die|`|9j2k2KeZaa	no it  f u c k e d things up even more|`|9P3uKmPlaa	The people of Iraq had NO civil rights when hussein was in power, they do now. That's a pretty dramatic change. Saddam and his son's regularly killed and tortured people in Iraq for no reason other than they felt like it.<br>  <br>  If you need more links google it, it isn't hard to find.|`|65ee940d9c7e50d5aad318e0d8096478aa	Under Saddam the Ba'ath Party ruled.  These were the smaller Sunni Muslims who ruled over the Shia Muslims.  Sunni's and Shia's have a certain antipathy to one another - so whilst Bin Ladin is a Shia Muslim, he was very unpopular with Saddam's Sunni Muslim regime in Iraq.  So we went to war on an absolute lie.  Al Qaeda was not a problem in Iraq until we invaded - then the backlash started.  Wouldn't you feel upset if you were a country divided - like Scotland and England - a certain antipathy toward one another then in come the Russians to invade us both.  You wuold also probably unite with the Scots to inculcate violence against the Russians.<br>  <br>  Abu Ghraib existed under Saddam - Abu Ghraib prison continued to exist under the American occupation.  Political prisoners continued to be tortured - albeit with slightly different ideologies in place - so different people may have been tortured.  We had human rights atrocities perpetrated in Iraq under our occupation.  Look up Lindy England and Charles Graynor - and what ever you do do not believe that this was some sort of low level aberration - this was done at the very highest level - England and Graynor was just the fall guys.|`|iwckOLB9aa	It was better with saddam.<br>  <br>  either way people died but with America more died and everything got blown up and people are still getting bombed and shot at.

EvU7PpZuaa	In the UK forces you have to join and complete your probationary period first (2yrs). After that I would suggest spending time working the beat and gaining experience. I spent 8 years on the beat before becoming an AFO (Authorised Firearms Officer). <br>  <br>  Obviously you have to wait for vacancies to come along and then submit an application which has to be backed by your line managers. The competition is stiff due to the large numbers that apply. I had to submit a general application followed by a further application giving examples under specific skill headings. After this we were all subject of a paper sift, where numerous candidates were discounted at the first hurdle. We also had a fitness test, which admittedly was fairly easy. After this came an interview before the successful candidates were selected to attend the next available firearms course. <br>  <br>  The firearms course consisted of five weeks, split between shooting and tactics. It was fairly testing and if you failed a classification on any weapon you were instantly binned from the course. <br>  <br>  I have been a firearms officer for 4 years and can honestly say I love the job. I mostly work the ARV's attending and dealing with spontaneous firearms incidents. This can be the most testing work because preplanned jobs cater for every eventuality. I also get involved in preplanned jobs as well. In any downtime we patrol in the ARV's and deal with normal police work. We get involved in pursuits and make plenty of arrests. We generally hand prisoners on though as we have to stay available for any deployments.<br>  <br>  The pay is no different to any other officer, whether that be a beat officer or other specialist officer. The pay is rank and scale related. You basically get a pay rise each year until you reach the top payscale in that rank. <br>  <br>  Previous weapons training or experience is not essential. It will be different from weapons training in the army because the job is very different.|`|gPvOcB6oaa	Your psychological tests would find your enthusiasm for carrying  weapons a danger to you and your colleagues, so you would be put on traffic duties helping old ladies across the street etc|`|a4f625e9943640ad9aec7382d7bcfe89aa	You first join the police complete two years probation then in principle could apply but unlikely without further experience that you would be considered.Armed officers in the police are first and foremost policemen if you tried to join and stated you main intent was to use guns then it is unlikely you would be employed.|`|9T09iprPaa	you will have to work your way up from being a Reg Hollis type cop first before you even think about being Dirty Harry, you have to have what it takes to be even considered, sounds to me you havnt even got as far as Hendon Police Collage yet, its not easy to get in at the moment, i was advised if i wanted to join up the best way in was to be a comunity support officer as this was the place to be when a vacancy came up, and my interests were not set as high as yours, i was up for being a motorcycle cop, im to old now as i am almost 50, but you can choose a lot worse as a career choice, you might find that your friends will stop talking when you walk in the room as the saying a cop is never off duty tends to ring true, but you will soon find a new circle of friends with the job|`|3412c63f053570e6bf7bced0cc10f281aa	Most importantly you will need to prove how quick you are on the draw.

And that's a big turn off .|`|CEiyYCqaaa	Republicans are shooting for votes by affiliation. By being affiliated with the bible belt they've secured those votes out of blind loyalty. People who pride themselves on affiliation rarely care much about the politics, rather they care about themselves and their culture.<br>  Racists and hate mongers that listen to Rush Limbaugh are also closet party members.<br>  <br>  Neocons the "persuasive movement" (Irving Krystol) is simply a group of people seeking support thru persuading people to join their group or affiliation. It really has nothing to do with party guides or agenda other then making money thru political manipulation.<br>  <br>  Most notably George Bush and the whole Iraqi/Haliburton Oil schtick.<br>  <br>  The idea around neocons is simply put, if you or anyone can gain political power and manipulate the public into supporting you, then you can gain a lot of money and power.<br>  <br>  Nondom.

I think that the religion enthusiasts definitely do cause the party harm and paint a pretty big target for the opposition.<br>  <br>  As for the attacking Rush Limbaugh factor someone eluded to earlie, I think that he is good for the party.  Right now the conservatives don't have a leader and we need one bad.  Rush is our leader.  I know that he is a polarizing figure, but his speech that he gave at CPAC was dead on.<br>  <br>  The person I would like to see lead the Conservatives by 2012 is Mitt Romney.  Romney is equally as articulate as Obama and is a true Conservative.  However, because of the religious factor and Romney being Mormon he will have to work hard to have people (independents) look at him as someone other than a religious wacko.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	I am an agnostic fiscal conservative, and I think the religious right in my party are now defined as Neocons.

For those who think we don't, try living without us and remember that when you are sleeping, we're out patrolling the streets and keeping you safe.<br>  <br>  Now, in answer to your question, there are hundreds of different tasks we are expected to carry out and I probably won't be able to list them all in a short space of time but to give you some idea the following are a general list.<br>  <br>  The protection of life.<br>  <br>  The protection of property.<br>  <br>  Keeping the Queens peace.<br>  <br>  The prevention of crime by way of patrolling the streets and offering crime prevention advice.<br>  <br>  The detection of crime when dealing with suspects for offences.<br>  <br>  Investigating crime by conducting interviews, gathering evidence and creating files of that evidence for court hearings.<br>  <br>  Dealing with traffic related offences.<br>  <br>  Dealing with public disorder, usually caused by alcohol abuse.<br>  <br>  Looking for missing persons.<br>  <br>  Dealing with sudden deaths by attending the scene of the death to take charge of the body and look after the deceased until they are taken to the local mortuary.  We then have to prepare reports for the coroner and do further work if necessary in relation to the circumstances surrounding the death.<br>  <br>  Dealing with issues surrounding the proptection of children and vulnerable persons.<br>  <br>  The prevention and detection of terrosism.<br>  <br>  Assisting other emergency services with incidents such as forcing entry to an address to save a life or blocking off roads to allow other services to work safely etc.<br>  <br>  I could go on but we are usually called upon for all manner of things.  some of the things we deal with are horrific, Some are more mundane but we do this because we want to and we are also expected to deal with things we see whilst off duty all for less wages than some more mundane and less dangerous jobs.|`|5nitBxpBaa	I live in the U.K and the police here are too concerned with their petty conceived grievances against members of the public who have no way of defending themselves to be of any actual use in real crime prevention and the IPPC is there solely to cover up police excesses,they have no other function whatsoever.I am not allowed to to be truthful in my answer,because Yahoo will delete it,as they have done to others who have attempted to tell the truth.and I don't mean that they used abusive language either.Yes,just about everything that the first person to answer this question said.|`|M9VMBBpBaa	I once heard "it is not what a police does, but what he might have to do."

TItRpckpaa	You sign a contract when you first join. You decide the length, min is 2 years now I think, you can do 2,3,4 all the way to 6 years. I reccomend 3 years you get a big bonus and youmight change you mind while your in, thats what happened to me.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Also, be advised no matter how long you sign up for you have an 8 year obligation to the Army. So if you sign up for 3 years active, you finish that and you go home. You will then be part of what is called the "inactive reserve", you dont drill or do anything but in a time of war you can be called up for the remainder of that 8 years to deploy, and I do know some people in the inactive reserve who have been deployed so keep that in mind. Also, you might get stop-lossed which means if your unit is deploying in november, if your ETS date (day you get out of the army) is after september 1 you have to serve another tour, this happens to a lot of people.|`|Nejnh1Bqaa	You are in until you are released,  usually at the end of your enlistment plus any inactive reserve time.

When she ditches school to see you, she is committing what's called a status offense (truancy). If her parents disapprove of the relationship, they (could) say it is because of your influence and file a complaint for "contributing to the delinquency of a minor". Any charges for allegation of sex would be at the discretion of the prosecutor (if she is not of legal age) according to your state statute if he/she thought they had a legitimate case. Restraining orders are normally limited to cases of harassment, stalking, domestic violence, etc. (violence or threat of violence)<br>  <br>  The secrecy/dishonesty is probably what has her parents concerned. Put yourself in Dad's place if it were your daughter given this scenario, what would you think????

K7pdGITWaa	Saya ingat sebuah esay yang ditulis oleh Jakob Sumardjo yang berjudul "Zaman Emas Indonesia". Sebuah artikel yang saya kira bisa mewakili pandangan saya.<br>  <br>  Berikut saya berikan petikan artikelnya :<br>  <br>  " Saat itu presidennya tegas dan keras, tidak takut mati dan tidak takut kehilangan pendukungnya. Hatinya baik, tidak ada pikiran uang sama sekali karena sejak bayi sudah kaya-raya. Ketegasannya mendapat dukungan seluruh rakyat miskin di Indonesia, yaitu dalam melenyapkan korupsi, kejahatan dasar yang membuat negara ini hampir saja pecah belah."<br>  <br>  "Para pemerkosa dihukum seumur hidup. Dua kali memerkosa dihukum mati. Di mana sila Perikemanusiaan dalam Pancasila? Jawab presiden, Itu semua dilakukan demi perikemanusiaan. Bukan perikejahatan!"<br>  <br>  "Impian tata temtrem kerta raharja, adil makmur ternyata bukan omong kosong dongeng anak-anak. Kuncinya hanya satu, tembak mati para maling negara, entah jemaah maupun perorangan. Ibu Pertiwi akan bersimbah darah para penjarah, tetapi itulah syarat kesuburan."<br>  ...|`|IPqNw34Haa	setuju <br>  <br>  untuk koruptor = hukumman cambuk atau hukuman mati|`|AA10077811	KITA KURANG PROPORSIONAL MEMANDANG KORUPSI.<br>  <br>  Seolah korupsi itu kejahatan terbesar yang tidak ada tandingannya. Padahal korupsi itu cakupannya sangat luas. Bahkan kita semua pernah melakukan korupsi. Lihat saja yang sepele-sepele: Datang tidak tepat waktu (korupsi waktu), mau membeli barang di toko tersebut asalkan harganya didiskon (kolusi), membawa sanak keluarga masuk ke kantor tempat kita bekerja (nepotisme).<br>  <br>  Padahal banyak sekali kejahatan yang juga harus diberantas, misalnya: Mur dan baud jembatan, tiang listrik dan rel kereta api yang dicuri (mengancam nyawa ribuan orang!), pembalakan liar (yang bisa membuat tanah longsor dan membunuh banyak orang), narkoba, dll.<br>  <br>  HUKUM HARUS TEGAS.<br>  <br>  Saya sangat setuju jika hukuman keras dan tegas diberlakukan pada para pelaku kejahatan. Tapi tidak hanya kepada koruptor. Pengedar ganja juga tak kalah besar dosanya dibandingkan dengan koruptor. MASALAHNYA: Di Indonesia terlalu banyak orang yang ingin populer. Salah satu jalan termudah adalah menjadi "pengamat" di media massa. Contoh: Apapun yang dilakukan pemerintah tentang harga BBM dimata pengamat ini selalu salah.<br>  Menaikkan harga dibilang menyengsarakan rakyat.<br>  Tidak menaikkan harga dibilang tidak peduli pada kas negara.<br>  Menurunkan harga dibilang mencari muka agar dipilih lagi menjadi presiden.<br>  <br>  Jelas-jelas berdagang di trotoar adalah salah. Tapi malah dibela. Polisi Pamong Praja yang akan menertibkan malah dilempari batu oleh oknum mahasiswa.<br>  Calon kepala desa-nya kalah, pendukungnya ngamuk melempari apa saja, termasuk kendaraan yang lewat. Wajar dong jika polisi melakukan tindakan keras, karena pengendara mobil itu juga punya hak hidup di Indonesia. Tapi polisi malah dilempari batu. Lalu besoknya para pengamat busuk ini berkoar seolah dirinya paling benar. Menyalahkan aparat dan tidak pernah menyalahkan massa yang mengamuk, seolah hak asasi itu hanya milik demonstran, sedangkan polisi itu cuma robot yang tidak punya keluarga dan anak-anak di rumah. Di mata pengamat busuk ini, nyawa seorang demonstran sangat berharga, sedangkan satu kompi polisi mati semua bukan masalah.<br>  <br>  Saya sudah capek mikirin republik ini. Terlalu banyak orang yang sok pintar dan bisanya menyalahkan orang lain. Tidak pernah orang seperti ini mengajukan usul kepada pemerintah, dan memuji pemerintah jika berhasil. Orang ini justru diam, lalu segera mengkritik apapun yang dikerjakan oleh pemerintah. APAKAH KEJAHATAN ORANG INI LEBIH BAIK DARIPADA KORUPTOR?<br>  <br>  Pikirkan baik-baik.<br>  <br>  SEKARANG KITA AKAN MENERAPKAN HUKUM CAMBUK? Hehehe... Di luar sana banyak LSM yang sudah pasang kuda-kuda dan memasang speaker TOA. Atas nama HAM (dan dibonceng semangat anti Arabianisasi), mereka pasti akan menentang habis-habisan hukum cambuk. Kalau perlu menggelar konferensi pers.<br>  <br>  Jika republik ini kelak hancur, yang menghancurkan itu justru para pengamat dadakan yang mengatasnamakan HAM. Catat ini!!!|`|Vn0XsJlLaa	hukum cambuk?? q rasa kurang cocok untuk negara kita.di samping kurang bermanfaat dan memberikan efek jera pada pelaku.harus lebih kejam lagi.dipermalukan aq rasa lerbih tepat.seperti memakai kaos tahanan korupsi serta keluarga mereka jg d pampang karena jg plg tidak menuikmati hasil korupsi tersebut.korupsi lebih kejam dari membunuh ato mencuri.bila d neg arab sana mencuri saja d potong tangan apalgi korupsi.karena korupsi membunuh bangsa kita secara perlahan dan menyengsarakan rakyat kecil.kayknya d indonesia aj yang para pejabatnya gendut2.lihat d luar sana kurus2 kan.tanya kenapa???|`|a42J2Vmbaa	Apa pun hukumannya saya mau minum dulu. [Glek ... glek ...]. Saya lupakan dulu kata cambuknya. Bagaimana mau jera jika seorang bandar narkoba bisa mengatur jaringannya dari dalam penjara ? Apalagi koruptor - koruptor yang 'terhormat' ? Jangan - jangan bisa shopping lewat mobile nya dari dalam penjara dengan hasil korupsi yang dia peroleh. Yakinkan dulu hasil korupsinya kembali utuh. Jika tidak ? Sita apa pun yang bisa disita termasuk sendal jepitnya. Jangan biarkan dia dan / atau keluarganya menikmati hasil korupsi sekalipun badan terkurung penjara.|`|abkS1qpUaa	Mengenai korupsi emang sudah menjadi mata rantai yang tidak bisa terputus. Jika koruptor mau diberantas, kita masih punya tugas untuk memberantas orang2 yang notabene penegak hukum. Bagi saya, hukuman mati tidak menyelesaikan masalah. Terlalu cepat dan tidak ada efek jera bagi dirinya sendiri maupun untuk keluarganya. Penyitaan aset dan harta lebih efektif, karena efeknya perlahan, biar koruptor merasakan dari yang punya duit banyak trus miskin semiskin2nya.<br>  <br>  Koruptor bukanlah pelanggar HAM, Unsur HAM itu hanya bisa dilakukan oleh negara secara sistematik dan meluas. Krn tidak memenuhi unsur dalam UU No.39 tahun 1999, koruptor tidak akan bisa dikategorikan sebagai pelanggar HAM dan tidak akan pernah untuk dihadapkan ke Peradilan HAM secara nasional maupun internasional. Instrumen dasar HAM yang kemudian disadur dalam UU No.39 tahun 1999, tidak menempatkan koruptor sebagai pelanggar HAM<br>  <br>  Penjatuhan hukuman mati tidak melanggar HAM karena negara sudah dipercaya untuk membuat suatu peraturan perundang2an untuk melindungi warga negaranya. Toh, penjatuhan hukman mati tidak sembarangan diberikan, smua itu tergantung dari besarnya kejahatan dan dampaknya.|`|fU4pJ0XTaa	semua itu tergantung manusianya itu sendiri,seberat apapun hukuman yang diberikan tapi kalo dr diri org itu sendiri gak berubah buat apa,krn kalo org udah enak pasti kesananya akan selalu pinginnya enak terus n gak akan pernah jera.kalo perlu hukuman mati aja krn org itu telah menyakiti org banyak dengan mengambil dengan paksa hak seseorg|`|fergexgmaa	kalo menurut gw ngga,<br>  <br>  karena pada pasal 28a UUD 1945<br>  "Setiap orang berhak untuk hidup serta berhak mempertahankan hidup dan kehidupannya"<br>  <br>  -berarti hukuman mati ga boleh sebenarnya.<br>  <br>  Pasal 28I Ayat 1 UUD 1945<br>  "Hak untuk hidup, Hak untuk tidak disiksa, hak kemerdekaan pikiran dan hati nurani, hak beragama, hak untuk tidak diperbudak, hak untuk diakui sebagai pribadi dihadapan hukum dan hak untuk tidak dituntut atas dasar hukum yang berlaku susrut adalah hak asasi manusia yang tidak dapat dikurangi dalam keadaan apapun"<br>  <br>  kalo yang ini hukuman yang sifatnya menyiksa itu ga boleh, dan HAK ASASI MANUSIA pada pasal 28I ayat 1 tidak dapat dikurangi dalam keadaan apapun.<br>  <br>  Dan seluruh hukum dibawah hukum UUD 1945 yang menyimpang UUD 1945 harusnya DIHAPUS.|`|zM1VIsJ5aa	Korupsi dan pencurian tidak pernah berakhir, tapi bisa dikurangi. Hukuman badan tidak cukup baik untuk membuat para koruptor jera. Kebiadaban ini tidak cocok untuk zaman modern sekarang. Sama dengan biadabnya hukuman potong tangan yang disuruh tuhan islam untuk para pencuri.<br>  <br>  Orang indonesia perlu bicara lantang dan bukannya membungkam diri sendiri terhadap kejahatan yang berlangsung di depan matanya. Masyarakat dan anggota keluarga sendiri perlu mengucilkan para koruptor dalam waktu tertentu, termasuk dilemparkan ke dalam bui.<br>  <br>  Masalah yang mendasar adalah hukum belum berjalan secara optimal di negara primitif seperti indonesia.

Only time will tell about how Obama did.  Remember when judging Presidents history is still judging Washington, let alone Bush (either one), or Clinton.

Becker says that in that case, spending could do more harm than good."<br>  <br>  "Some of Becker's colleagues are more emphatic. John Cochrane, a finance professor at the University of Chicago's business school, published a detailed paper this week on the topic. He sketches an argument for lower taxes right now - instead of higher spending - while simultaneously whittling down the budget deficit. <br>  <br>  Another option, he says, would be for the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury to print more money and issue more bonds. Cochrane writes: "Some economists tell me, 'Yes, all our models, data, and analysis for the last 40 years say fiscal stimulus doesn‚Äôt work, but don‚Äôt you really believe it anyway?' This is an astonishing attitude. How can a scientist 'believe' something different than what he or she spends a career writing and teaching? At a minimum policy-makers shouldn‚Äôt put much weight on such 'beliefs,' since they explicitly don‚Äôt represent expert scientific inquiry." <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/01/28/politics/otherpeoplesmoney/main4759532.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/01/2...</a><br>  <br>  "President Obama says that "economists from across the political spectrum agree" on the need for massive government spending to stimulate the economy.

We have survived this kind of thing in the past, but then again, these times are very different from anything we have ever seen on so many levels.<br>  <br>  I am hoping we can hang on for 2 years and then turn over the house.|`|H1If1jSNaa	Not very... going to take a lot of filabusters in Senate to keep our heads above water. Only have to make it until after 2010 elections though. Dem's will lose congress easy after all the "stimulus" (HAhaha makes me laugh everytime I say it) fails... we already know it will. Welfare and a train from Disneyland to Vegas will NOT help anything... too bad it only gets worse the farther you read into the bill. Is Pelosi up for re-election?

Unlikely.  I don't think it has to do with Obama, though... I think America has been heading in this direction for 40 years now.  Maybe you have a short memory, but things weren't looking so great in December, either.<br>  <br>  Countries don't stay on top forever.  They become corrupt, they don't take care of their natural resources, they get stuck in old ways of doing things, other countries get fed up.... Hopefully, as a nation we will come out of this strong enough to remain a good place to live, but I think change is coming, regardless of who our leader is.|`|2D6rM8Z0aa	Not very likely if we don't get off our ever widening butts and fight for the America our founding fathers intended.|`|ohgrMZDkaa	Hopefully until 2010, that way we can get the Senate and House.|`|7ccf6629153f5dc1724e3cd5d9ff7194aa	My Friend......as over 10 million more people decided we needed a new direction, I think we are stepping out at the right pace...we will now "Survive" as well as we were dying earlier...|`|2qQPBDlkaa	course we will... <br>  <br>  all it takes is another Reagan.. took 20 years to fully recover last time.. it may well take that long again.|`|k5X78IM3aa	Hopefully, America will be all the better because of the Obama "regime".|`|AA11151307	The obama regime?<br>  <br>  lmao<br>  <br>  Getting more and more desperate, aren't we?|`|aFC72tLZaa	Very likely, look at what he's done in 37 days, after 8 years of Bush erosion.  Feel foolish?|`|r7tWe5dqaa	I think regime is the right word. Our country was in bad shape when he took over and just looking for a solution. I think we were all too ready to latch onto anyone with a lot of charisma who had a plan. And now I think a lot of people are realizing too late that the plan was to destroy the very foundation of our country by making this a communist country with no money, no freedom and nothing we can do about it. You know Hitler did the same thing in Germany. Took a broke, starving and desperate nation and used it to his own end with nothing more than the charisma he was born with. And we all know how that turned out.....|`|66wdfDwPaa	Take a look at the stock market.  It has never reacted in such a negative way when a new president came into office.  Obama blames all of this on Bush.  Yes, Bush did some pretty stupid things, but nothing as stupid as Band-Aid Boy!  And Obama is creating this disaster.  He should let all of the irresponsible people whither and die out (sure, it will be painful), and stop interfering.  Oh, that's right, he wants Capitalism and Socialism.  The more government gets involved the more expensive it will be for us as Americans (but with all the Mexicans invading the country illegally, not sure what to call this place anymore...HELL)  Soon he'll make us say "Heil Hitler" when we see his picture.|`|pG9cufuHaa	Ok,<br>  No doubt we are in a bad place right now.. no doubt about it.. but come on people, WE ARE AMERICANS, we will make it through.. can't depend on the government but when have we really trusted them.. See we will survive and get out of this hole ourselves, and not with there pitty handouts for putting us here (which only by the way coulld make it worse on us. cuz Obama thinks he is a damn magician or something pullin money out of his ***..) it's just the way things are my fellow people, we will get through this, we will survive. as for the government they can all crawl back under what ever damn rock they came out from under from..|`|gc16g57Iaa	0.001% chance<br>  <br>  However, there is a fair chance that we may have a revolution back to the old policies that our founders intended.|`|MDgVPwU3aa	You survived the Bush Regime for 8 years "Eat the Rich" didn't you!

And if the stock market loses much more value, what is going to happen to the 77 million Americans retirement plans.  How will America support them.  Can you imagine the chaos of having that many people without income?  And from what I hear the market will only continue to get worse.  Obama could fix the problem, but he is out of control and not listening to sane advice.  If he is using his own judgment, then I know we are going down.|`|ZphAhwy6aa	lol it is over and we are toast...all you can do is take care of yours and do the best you can...To many Zombies waiting to be bailed out selling us out for there own agendas

If you are uncomfortable about entering into an agreement with someone the best bet would be to not get involved in the first place.
mr8isJoZaa	I am coming up to retirement from the military.  I have served many years and been to Iraq and Afghanistan and can say, yes, I have found my peace.  I had a dream, a goal that I was working for all these years, and it is finally becoming realized.  Once I retire from the miitary, I will move to my dream city and start my small business enterprise and forget all the bs of combat, but remember all the good friends I made along the way and be happy.  I only hope that everyone can find that small measure of peace.

I don't understand how something that has such a clear name "choice" can be consistently misconstrued as being forced upon others. People who support pro-choice do not tie women up and force them to have abortions; it simply means that the choice (to or not to have an abortion) belongs to the individual and that individuals' choice should be respected.<br>  <br>  Planned Parenthood does not solely perform abortions, they offer other services which, without, several women would probably resort to less than desirable measures. <br>  They offer adoption services, pregnancy prevention services and even counseling.|`|UvCA6ajZaa	Nobody is forcing anybody to do anything.

If every taxpayer were given the right to refuse to pay for spending that he found immoral, nothing would ever get done and the country would never function.

AA11163314	The first thing we have to do is we have to accept that the government cannot and does not create jobs.<br>  <br>  The next thing we have to do is we have to sit back stop blaming businesses that send jobs overseas.

All you have to do is cut the business tax rate by 15%.

VIhj7ghUaa	Why all this false importance placed on the stock market.  As its collapse demonstrated just as Enron and others have in the past, it has very little to do with reality and everything to do with perception and mob psychology, just as any other Ponzi scheme does.  Only Republicans believe the day-to-day fluctuations in the stock market "as a whole" (a phrase I also apply in pseudo-Italian-homonymic form to Republicans) have any deep meaning for the state of the economy.  And these are the same people who believe in the "Invisible Hand."  :P|`|MKrNZMVDaa	Wall Street ... a conscience? ...

(Winston Churchill coined that phrase.) Any time someone gets the jitters and starts selling his stock the rest of the herd follows, and a stampede ensues. And in the other direction too. If Buffett's buying then there's a whole bunch of others buying.<br>   Patience isn't exactly a virtue taught on Wall Street. It's a big reason why the economy is in the toilet. They want the quick buck instead of a solid investment. I think the market is in the process of shaking those guys out, and there are lots of bargains for someone with a few bucks and some patience.|`|AA10818613	LOL, but No.  Wall Street will never have a conscience or heart no matter how reasonable or honest Obama is.  If find it rather funny that Wall Street seems to be the only institution on the planet that likes to be lied too.  How else would anyone explain this mess?  The Gov't under Bush lied, the CEO's lied and the mutant talking heads calling themselves former traders and brokers on television telling the people to keep buying houses and stocks lied and they made a ton of money off all of us by lying and then taking off.  Maybe it's not just Wall Street that likes to be lied to but the entire country.  Oh the life of illusion, don't you just long for it again, lol.  LIE to me.<br>  <br>  LOL, one of the poster's below are saying that the market has no confidence in our new president.  LOL, do people actually think before they post?  It's the people who have no confidence in the markets or the economy and that's why it's going down and that's why we elected Obama.  The market is meaningless without a strong economy.  We should all learn that the market shouldn't be trusted.  Nor should the banks that are owned by stockholders be trusted.  They take too many risks.  Put your money into Credit Unions.  Their very model is far more safe for your money and they aren't on the stock market so they don't take the unnecessary risks that cause your money to vanish.  Their mortgage loan programs are far more healthy as well and require the lendee to have a down on the house saved before they buy that house.|`|DjdZOeUlaa	No.  The concept of a conscience is an alien idea to the stock market.

Because of the Bush Depression and the 8 years of R looting of America, I'll go along with some latitude.  But, we need to see improvement quickly - or Obama will be below Bush on the Presidents list and nothing but a footnote in history.|`|qXvFsnOcaa	Sorry, but it was Bush who brought America's economy down and forced Obama's hand. Obama would love to spend this money on education and welfare reform but he's got to spend it propping up the banking industry which Bush let collapse and the auto industry which went down when the economy went down.<br>  <br>  This spending is not nice and it's not wants Obama wanted, but it's what America needs right now.

vN2PUynoaa	Well seeing as he was not born here I guess he over stepped it long ago.|`|M0I56rVTaa	I don't believe ANY Presisdent has the "legal authority" to do anything. It all has to go before the House and the Senate. Very rare are the occassions that a President can "ORDER" for anything to be done.<br>  <br>  Not even in the military. Even though he is the Commander in Chief, NO soldier is obligated to follow an illegal order.<br>  <br>  So I don't think he has the "authority" to do anything.<br>  <br>  Plus, he can always say, " Congress approved/did it."|`|01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	Of course not.  Can you list HOW he has over stepped his executive authority?  It doesn't matter how it "seems" to you...
vN2PUynoaa	To my friend above... why would he have to show you, all you need to do is turn on the news or watch a tape of his his time while running for president. He says it like 5000 times!|`|0f0dac4f4bfb6a4b2d01df90fd84b3ffaa	Can you show me where he ever promised that there would be no earmarks? I honestly don't believe he did make such a promise.<br>  <br>  Peter Griffin: So you would have no problem providing a link if he said it five thousand times. So far no one has given me evidence he made this promise.
vN2PUynoaa	Well like all Democrats... he just flat out lied to the American people.|`|9P3uKmPlaa	Obama is a liar. How surprising, a politician lied for his own personal gain. Wow that's never happened before. We've basically put Al Bundy in office now you want to act surprised when he has absolutely no clue what the hell he is doing?

He just got in office not even two months ago. Try giving him two years and then say this. The kind of economic debt that we are in right now takes time, its not something you can fix overnight nor over a month. Look how FDR did it, it took a long time but he became one of the best presidents we have ever had. Its not time to judge yet.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	I'm reminded of the words of one Mr. Karl Marx, from his seminal work known as the Communist Manifesto.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Karl Marx believed that the government would gain too much power, mostly through back-alley deals with various businesses and corporations; and that this would give the government the wealth necessary to screw the worker, and the business world the authority to do the same.<br>  <br>  Who let that one happen? <br>  <br>  Karl Marx then said that the workers would be unable to take this oppression, and would move toward Revolution.<br>  <br>  Who just asked for a revolution?<br>  <br>  Karl Marx said that the workers would then establish their own government "of the people." This would be a temporary situation as this government cleared out the last vestiges of the old and corrupted government. When this was done, the workers would get rid of government entirely.<br>  <br>  Who is calling for revolution, so they can return power to the people, then shrink government down to practically no power?<br>  <br>  When one country (Russia) tried to do this process as laid out by Karl Marx, what emerged was a Fascist state (that only called itself Communist); and that believed that it was its duty to spread its ideas to the rest of the world through any means necessary, even war.<br>  <br>  Who has been calling for "spreading democracy" to the rest of the world, even through war?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Yet the three biggest spenders in American history were (in order from most to 3rd most):<br>  <br>  1) George W. Bush (R)<br>  <br>  2) Richard Nixon (R)<br>  <br>  3) Ronald Reagan (R)<br>  <br>  <br>  Ronald Reagan also happened to have raised taxes on everyone (except the top 1%) for the last 7 of his 8 years in office. The tax rates during Reagan's entire time in office were higher than the tax rates during the entire time Clinton was in office.<br>  <br>  The biggest expansion of government occurred in 2002, done by a Republican Congress and approved by Republican President George W. Bush (who came up with the legislation in the first place, mind you).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In every way, Republicans are following the Communist Manifesto to a T. Yet they show the same "big government" tendencies that they complain is present in Democrats, and the same "big government" tendencies that Stalin showed when he took what was to be the no-government solution of Communism into the total government control of Fascism.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  So perhaps you should channel one Mr. William Shakespeare, who once said, "We have seen our enemy, and he is us."|`|AA10352420	America like other countries is already on rapid move downwards. Thanks to the policies of various Govt and so called financial experts they have ruined the lives of millions of people who are trying to earn a living  to support their families.

I suppose I will just have to start making my own.<br>  <br>  The 2nd amendment "shall not be infringed"|`|AA11442722	The 2nd ammendment isn't about owning guns, it's about self determination. Whether that be defending your life and property from criminals, invaders or your own government. It covers not just firearms but also future weapons that will replace firearms, armor, communications gear and anything else that allows the American people to band together and defeat tyranny, injustice and defend themselves. <br>  <br>  It is about the ability to defend your ideals as well. Militia implies that independence that made us such a great nation, but that also so often needs defending. <br>  <br>  The only reason for a government to ban weapons is if that government doesn't trust it's own people. A government for the people by the people cannot distrust itself by deffinition. So if the government fears it's own people that means we have a government that has left the principles of Democracy far behind. That has something up it's sleeve that it knows will not be popular, so unpopular that it feels the need to disarm up to prevent us from doing something about it.|`|YbXSNgUOaa	At this point in time it would make it very difficult for us to maintain our freedoms over a young, and once growing nation. I visualize a nation without guns, like unto a African nation where the citizens are unarmed and his will be imposed ( someone like Attila the Hun).  If we did not have guns, the lives of our families would be in constant jeopardy, from droves of thieves, rapist, and murderers. Far too many people have had it so easy for so long, that they can not bring themselves to think about their life might change overnight, and I think that all the problem that we are having with our economy is a diversionary tactic to hide the real goal they have in mind. UN ARM THE AMERICAN CITIZENS.|`|Z7SwcxVDaa	I see a good move, so the young kid in school will be safe and won't have to be kill at  younger age.|`|U2qRvH2laa	I'm going to a gun show in a few hours.

You need to check to see if your neighborhood has any convenants that would restrict doing that. Also you need to check with your local zoning department to see if that is allowed.<br>  <br>  Anytime you operate something like that out of your house (ie. spray painting cars as a business, auto repair, etc.) there are usually restrictions in residential areas.|`|AWSmknxLaa	That is called industrial or at least commercial operations.<br>  <br>  That is not allowed in a residential area.

If you report this to the police they could ad more charges.  It might also help boost patrolling in the area.<br>  <br>  You are right that the cops aren't going to set up road blocks and call in a helicopter for this crime, but it's a crime and they will investigate.  Maybe you will get lucky and the guy will be caught.  With the police report the guy can be held accountable for what he did to your car and be forced to pay for the repairs.|`|bARPX1auaa	A true resolution is very unlikely, however a police report is sometimes required by the insurance company for the claim to be processed.<br>  <br>  A word of warning:  It's not uncommon for a crime victim to call the police to report a crime, and find themselves arrested for another matter.  Before you call the police to your home make sure you know and understand your rights and their limits.<br>  <br>  Watch the video "Busted: A citizens guide to surviving a police encounter" and visit the website www.flexyourrights.org to become educated as how you can protect yourself.|`|a8e1KcS2aa	You should call the police so they can document the vandalism - <br>  It will bring a few more patrols in the area for the following week or so, and they'll do a report so you can make an insurance claim on it if you choose to do so.

Also if you plan on filing a claim with your insurance company you'll need a copy of that police report. <br>  <br>  Remember police departments often distribute their manpower in the basis of crime reports.

AA12351337	You can just send the payment in then.  From what you described, you were wrong.  Yes, everyone does it, but you got caught, and the cop was right.  But, the other driver should have gotten cited for something.  For reckless operation or something, for not paying attention.  You can try and write a letter and send it along with your fine payment and put it "To Whom it May Concern" or something like that.

eulMjLtPaa	In general, you do not have to talk to law enforcement officers (or anyone else), even if you do not feel free to walk away from the officer, you are arrested, or you are in jail. You cannot be punished for refusing to answer a question. <br>  <br>  In some states, you must provide your name to law enforcement officers if you are stopped and told to identify yourself. <br>  <br>  You do not have to answer any questions. You can say, ‚ÄúI do not want to talk to you‚Äù and walk away calmly. Or, if you do not feel comfortable doing that, you can ask if you are free to go. If the answer is yes, you can consider just walking away. Do not run from the officer. If the officer says you are not under arrest, but you are not free to go, then you are being detained. Being detained is not the same as being arrested, though an arrest could follow.|`|WUsnC6LJaa	There are many situations you may not be aware of where every one of these answers can be yes.  Can an officer come up and talk to you?  Yes, just like the mailman and the electricity meter reader.  He is no different from anyone else when it comes to consensual encounters.  If he wants to raise it to the level of a detention, he will need more, but not a lot.  So you're on your own property drinking beer.  Is that legal?  Probably not.  Most cities and counties have ordinances against drinking in public.  Even on private property you can still be in public.  So can he ask you to go inside and put the alcohol away?  In that circumstance yes.  Or he could arrest you instead!  Sounds like a pretty nice cop to me!  As far as asking you questions about something you don't have a clue about, it's called police work.  If they're trying to find information about something that happened, you talk to the neighbors or just people in the area that may have information.  That's how crimes get solved.  Lighten up and realize it's not personal.|`|K2ecmzInaa	A police officer will be able to do anything in his power to control the situation. They may ask you to step out of your home or vehicle in order to control the situation better. <br>  <br>  A police officer can question you on your private property. <br>  <br>  A cop cannot harass you for "no reason". However, they can question you. It is your decision whether or whether not your cooperate. <br>  <br>  If you feel you are the target of undue harassment, contact your local police station and speak with a shift supervisor. Or file an official complaint with the department.|`|c6e4f1055e2cd01c39d43355e5af4d01aa	The cops can do what ever they want to. They get away with murder! Literally murder! Just watch the news. They will try to trick you into unknowingly give up your rights. Look up flex your rights.com and watch the videos. Then go to you tube and watch the film called the rise of Americas police state. The best way to protect yourself from the police is to know your rights. Believe me, we all need to be protected from the police!|`|AA11909745	You have a number of short questions so I will answer each one<br>  <br>  Can a cop force you to step into public space just to get full authority?<br>  Yes he can...but you do not have to, you can simply say, Sir, do you have a warrant for my arrest, if he says no but he can get one, say " Ok then please get one, because I am not answering any of your questions until I receive the advice of my attorney'<br>  <br>  Can a cop question you on private property? Yes....he can, but use the same answer as above.<br>  <br>  If I am drinking beer inside my property can a cop ask me to go inside my house and drop the alcohol can? Yes he can ask you to do this, and if you have been making a noise and a neighbor has complained he then gains the right to come on your property to protect the publics iinterest and peace to ask you to get rid of the alcohol and go inside, if you fail to do this he can arrest you for disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace.<br>  <br>  Can a cop harras you for no reason and ask you questions regarding something you dont have a clue. Sure he can, and again, you have the right to either say, "I dont know", "I do not wish to answer your questions without my attorney present" if you feel your answer might land you in hot water. <br>  <br>  As to your last question, based on the questions you asked it appears that you and your friends are not exactly being the picture of the perfect neighbor where ever you live, you appear to be young, and possibly rebellious, this is like a magnet to the local cops, they have probably got a few complaints from people where you live and you have now become the focus of their attention. Remember, cops are like all of us, they would rather get paid and not have to do much, the calls regarding you and your friends have probably disturbed their coffee breaks more than once and now they make it a point to jack you up when ever they can, and they can do this, because as long as they do, it shows the neighbors that they are doing something. So my advice to you is what ever you have been doing, take a break from it, lay low and below their radar so to say and they will forget about you.
IcTBvG0saa	Once you are asking the same question again, I will give you the same answer :<br>  The Serbs are the last population in the world that should have been suspected of genocidal behavior. The Serbs were just defending themselves. Read about the public relations campaign against the Serbs by Ruder Finn, which recruited the leaders of prominent Jewish organizations -- a betrayal of the Jewish people whom these leaders claim to represent<br>  <br>  After reading the following report, I am sure you will rephrase your question ( which is anyway absurd ! ). Who killed whom. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hirhome.com/yugo/ihralija1.ht..." rel="nofollow">http://www.hirhome.com/yugo/ihralija1.ht...</a><br>  <br>  edit:<br>  RobertK, US and Germany media started that meaningless war, US and Germany media used these words, 'peace keepers' were sent to Sarajevo and made money from bloodshed ....doesn't matter if muslim or Christians or atheist were killed - 100 000 people were dead for no reason ! Every life is precious !|`|04021fc4881460602edfbe93dc6ae44eaa	The correct way would have been: "Bosnian Serbs killed Bosnian Muslims." By that time, the Bosnian muslims called themselves Bosnian Muslims. Today their name is Bosniacs.<br>  <br>  Robert K, I am sorry to hear that your poor Muslims suffered so much. Perhaps if your Germany and USA hadn't created that war in which they threw the Muslims against much stronger Serbs, 100,000 people would not have been killed. The Muslim bastards went for the bate to have a country under their central command, with so many Serbs in the same **** with them. I applaud to Serbs for having killed the double of what they lost, and for having won 70% of the territory before Dayton. Wars suck.<br>  <br>  I have no idea what genocide you are talking about? Was it when the Dutch allowed Serbs revenge for having protected Naser Oric?|`|DyeKk9HKaa	Because the media then and now cannot never decipher who is what, when, why, and how. Bosnians who were being killed were Bosnian Serbs, Bosnian Croats, Bosnians of Islamic faith, Bosnians of no faith as well as other slavic people from other parts of what was then known as The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The slavic Bosnians of Islamic faith if you call it that, were the poor, innocent victims according to the media, when in fact muslims were and are responsible for more cowardly deaths and suicides than any other faith worldwide. Bosniaks need to quit playing the victim and take responsibility of the Serbs that they killed back then.

So logically low taxes is a core part of our culture. As such being patriotic and American means you cannot be for large taxes. It runs against our culture, our history and the very concepts this nation was founded on. <br>  <br>  As for offended, I was quite offended by that comment, more so by Holder's comments, parts of the pork fry they called a stimulus package and especially by the frequent attacks on the 2nd ammendment that have been the signature of the Obama administration so far. <br>  <br>  As for the copper, hopefully in exchange those who gave you the copper got lead in exchange :) Lots and lots of lead.

But I'm not arrogant enough to assume the worse without waiting to see what happens. Fact is that his plan is similar to the New Deal, and despite some revisionist history floating around by non-professional historians with obvious political biases, the New Deal worked! So I am going to wait and see what happens before I pass judgment. If it works, great! If not, then I'll work to vote his butt out and try someone else next election. That is how the system works. <br>  <br>  Besides, all the detractors moan and whine about it, but none of them have a better idea. The only other idea I have heard was "cut taxes." Well, guess what? Bush already tried that for years, and look what happened. Hmm...|`|D5A9JUDMaa	The same FOOLS who took it upon themselves to ASSUME that "their vision" of CHANGE was what Obama was offering......<br>  <br>  Are the SAME people who though that "sharing the wealth" was a great idea.....

(My apologies to my cat). Any fool should know that you never, ever raise taxes during a recession - or at any other time. Sure, Obama stands up there mouthing his platitudes about "We're only going to raise taxes on those earning $200,000.00 a year or more. Everyone else will get a tax cut." Well duhhhh. If a person is smart enough to earn $200,000.00 a year then my money is on that person being smart enough to think: "You know, I can live just as well on $199,000.00 a year and save a bundle on my taxes." <br>  <br>  Lets not forget Obama's plans for "cap and trade" on carbon emissions. He stated in a Jan. 2008 campaign speech that: "... under my cap and trade proposals electricity rates will necessarily skyrocket ..." Now isn't that great news for lower income people? People are already struggling with rent or mortages and putting food on the table and gasoline in their cars and here comes a plan to slam them even harder with higher utility bills. <br>  <br>  I hope everyone who voted for Obama will be happy with a reduced standard of living and less personal freedom.<br>  <br>  I've giving odds of 99 to 1 that in 20 years Obama will be called the worst president ever.

Cn1tSHLpaa	And they had a Republican President (Eisenhower) when they started it...<br>  <br>  (Locke is wrong...I suggest a history lesson for the ignorant neo-con:  "The United States entered the war to prevent a communist takeover of South Vietnam as part of their wider strategy of containment. Military advisors arrived beginning in 1950. U.S. involvement escalated in the early 1960s and combat units were deployed beginning in 1965. Involvement peaked in 1968 at the time of the Tet Offensive. Despite a peace treaty signed by all parties in January 1973, fighting continued. In April 1975, North Vietnam captured Saigon.

I am a firm believer in the truth of Scripture, which strictly and expressly forbids it in several places. There is no other way to put it.<br>  <br>  I know that this is a very unpopular stance on this issue but to say anything else is a lie. <br>  <br>  Like I said I would not call my kid a sicko, but I would not be supportive of it either. not at first.

I don't care how many thumbs down I get it's nasty and it's not why God made man and woman.  If he had wanted us to be fags he would have made Adam and Steve not Adam and Eve.

After all, it isn't like it was a choice, it would just be what she is. But, most importantly, there's nothing wrong with being gay.

VcyAeRGfaa	You have a serious claim, and some pretty serious damages.  In the interest of full disclosure, I am a lawyer, but still you really should hire a lawyer.  A decent lawyer should be able to get you more than you will be able to negotiate on your own, even taking into account the contingent fee, which for a case like this shouldn't be more than 35%.<br>  <br>  The lawyer will investigate the reason for your baby's death and if it was caused by the accident, line up experts to prove that the accident was the cause.  Lawyers also have access to databases that can tell them what damages were awarded in other cases like yours (including jury awards and settlements where the information is available).  You theoretically could access that same information, but it costs $$ and frankly you need some training to know what you're looking for and where to find it.<br>  <br>  If you are determined to go it alone, do some work to get your doctor's opinion on the extent and severity of your injuries, the amount of physical limitation you will experience going forward, possible future medical expenses, and possible causes of your baby's premature birth and death.  Write detailed demand letters to the insurance company and attach copies of your evidence (medical bills and records relating to the items mentioned above).  And ask for a lot.  Just to give you an idea, if your chiro costs $100 per visit, and you need 12 visits per year for 35 years, that's 42k.  And if the premature birth and death are causally related, you're talking about big damages.<br>  <br>  Again, though, get a lawyer.  Because this is a big $$ case potentially, they will either try to get out cheap (because you are not a lawyer, and they have a huge information advantage against you) or, if you try to hold out for a worthy settlement, they will defend vigorously and you will be in over your head.  There are complexities to this I can't explain easily -- how insurance limits come into play, for example.  Get a lawyer.|`|SHARt1k3aa	Well, what happens now is the insurance company will contact you and offer you a settlement.  If you are happy with it, accept, if you aren't tell them you aren't happy with that and to go back to the table.  If you aren't happy with any of the offers, then you should get an attorney.  I would say for permanent damage you should receive a very good sum of money, so don't' settle for 25K or anything like that.|`|VjgqZetcaa	It doesn't make any sense that the person in the back seat was at fault, which is what you said has happened.  In any case, you may have a claim (against whoever caused the action) for any and all damages and injuries you suffered.  If you believe your claim is worth any amount of money beyond small claims court, then it is worth contacting a lawyer to take care of it for you.

AA10123414	"Can my ex-landlord sue me for "damages" if I never signed a lease?" - Of course, on several levels:<br>  1. You lived there. Your living there signifies your acceptance of a landlord/tenant relationship. A lease is not needed to establish that relationship.<br>  2. You caused the damage. You also indicated you were unable to remove the stains.<br>  <br>  Your current choices:<br>  1. Pay the $400<br>  2. Go to court, most likely lose and pay $400 plus court costs.|`|fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	First answer is correct.

Not having a lease is irrelevant.  Your dog did damages...you are responsible for those damages.

And their former friends will laugh at them and say that if they deserved to have their health care costs covered, the insurance company would have paid for them. ‚à†¬∞)|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Actually that's a myth, <br>  <br>  There was a since discredited Harvard study that said that back in 2005<br>  <br>  But the methodology of that study was proven invalid.<br>  <br>  They considered bankruptcies that occured, after the main financial earner in a family was accidentialy killed, as being health care related.<br>  <br>  IE: father was hit by a truck and killed, wife had to declare bankruptcy because she didn't earn enough to pay for the home, well that study said that was health care related.<br>  <br>  They also said that any bankruptcy that had more than 1,000 dollars of unreimbursed health care cost in the last year, was because of health care.<br>  <br>  Considering most families WITH insurance, have 1,000 dollars worth of unreimbursed health care cost each year, when you add in yearly deductables and co pays.<br>  <br>  Yes I know Obama quoted that study, <br>  <br>  Which makes ya wonder, knowing it had been discredited, even by Harvard university itself, <br>  <br>  Why would Obama quote from it?|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	Because they don't care if you go broke and die.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	The US federal government runs Medicare, which is essentially universal healthcare for one segment of the population.  Medicare is a textbook example of inefficient, ineffective management of resources.<br>  <br>  Prove to me that the US govt can manage Medicare effectively and I'll grant it may be possible for the US govt to manage universal healthcare.<br>  <br>  There are problems with our healthcare system... some pretty big ones.  But I think a government run healthcare program for everyone would be a disaster.  Even if it works in England, or Canada or Japan, doesn't mean it will work here.<br>  <br>  After all, our government can't manage to figure out an efficient system for Medicare recepiants.  What makes you think they'll do a better job for the entire population?|`|7e57c76aff7f3e7081be9fc8781ee45eaa	I am not willing to die because health care is rationed, so that someone that is unemployed, or has less education or skills (hence less income) than me can have equally crappy care.  It's not to lower everyone to the lowest common denominator so that the people at the bottom of society can be lifted up.  Why should me or my family get any less care after I PAID FOR IT?  Furthermore, why should I have to be forced to fund the government's program, while also paying for a private plan if I want better care?|`|rfjtgIBmaa	with Obama's health care rationing they will die so bankruptcies will decrease|`|otYOxmnuaa	They aren't healthy -- mentally at least...we all know by now that you need health insurance.<br>  <br>  Necessities in life:<br>  1.  Health Insurance<br>  2.  Water<br>  3.  Food<br>  4.  Shelter<br>  <br>  In that order.<br>  <br>  Wants in life:<br>  1.  24" spinners<br>  2.  Ipod<br>  3.  I-Phone<br>  4.  CD collection<br>  5.  65" Flat Screen<br>  <br>  I think it'd be interesting to take the opposite side of Michael Moore's documentary w/ everyone going bankrupt and explore the front side like:<br>  <br>  What transpired the day they stopped buying health insurance?<br>  <br>  Or why didn't they get insurance in the first place?<br>  <br>  How many consumer products did they have in their home that would have covered health insurance costs?<br>  <br>  Were they driving a new car?<br>  <br>  Were they in a house or renting?  How much was rent?<br>  <br>  Did they have a job when they needed two?<br>  <br>  People who are proponents of UHC always leverage the outcome...which is devastating, no doubt about it.  The stories are absolutely horrific.  But just as we have the freedom to make good choices and bask in those successes, we have the freedom to make poor choices and wallow in those consequences.  I feel bad for them but it all could have been avoided (for most).<br>  <br>  Do we go after the car company if somebody gets in a car wreck and get thrown out of their car, only to die later b/c they weren't wearing their seat-belt?  <br>  <br>  It's amazing that people can't wait to get UHC when it's failing all around the globe.  Basic care is great -- anything beyond that is terrible...which is why users from different countries fly out of state to get their specialized care.  <br>  <br>  The U.S. actually has their own system in Medicare, which is 40 billion in debt.  Without drastic reductions in user benefits, we'll be 20 Trillion (with a T) in debt in 50 years.  Canada is having the same problem...as are some European Country's.<br>  <br>  I propose we mandate health insurance and make it criminal not to have it -- just like we did with car insurance.  Premiums will fall -- hospital costs will fall...and we'll all be insured and receiving great care.|`|QI74CxD0aa	Yes, you are right. When catastrophic illness occurs, people often find out that their health  insurance does not cover it.  That defeats the whole idea of insurance, which should be to protect against catastrophic risks.<br>  <br>  Instead, health insurance covers a lot of run to the doctor behavior and discourages people from taking responsibility for their own health. It is really a system to make sure that the health providers get paid by spreading around the costs of  health care which is not catastrophic. <br>  <br>  So, it does not keep people out of bankruptcy when someone  has a debilitating accident or illness.|`|Fyq5nK4waa	It doesn't matter how much money we put into health care, if people do not change the way they live, no amount of money can make them healthy. We are an inactive, overweight country than cries poor me.  People need to get off the couch, away from the computer, exercise, and eat healthy.  This will lower our health care costs, which will allow enough resources to cover health problems that are not created by self indulgence.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	You won't solve it with universal health care.

Some say that you can win the Presidency by just being on the ticket.  This is a disparity.  What you need to do in the next 30 years (you must be 35 Years Old To Run For President) is start scouting out a public service career and break into the national scene by running for your congressional district.<br>  <br>  During this congressional term, you'll have to be active and ready for a bunch of One-Minute Speeches.  Make sure to capture the heart of your party, as well as win some debates through votes.  After your first term, run for the U.S. Senate in your state.  The requirements vary from each state, but make sure that the Incombent Senator is not in the same party as you.  Primary fights can drag on and on without any unity within the party bands on election day.<br>  <br>  After maybe two terms in the Senate, after gaining some notoriety in the Senate, and perhaps a chairmanship position, go for the gusto and run for your party's nomination for President of the United States.  Remember that in order to get a good, public position on the Election Day ballot, you'll have to trudge to your party's nomination.  This also assumed that you fall under the constitutional requirements to run for President.<br>  <br>  As a suggestion, you may want to concentrate on grassroots movements on the internet.

Maybe I'll run into you someday... here's what I'm doing.<br>  <br>  First, ask your social studies, history, or civics teachers this same question. <br>  <br>  Then start watching the news and paying attention because school really is no joke, and most of it is relevant- believe it or not.<br>  <br>  Identify where you stand on issues and STICK TO YOUR PRINCIPLES! If you agree with everyone, then you'll be thrown to the dogs. Sometimes its ok when people talk bad about you.<br>  <br>  Listen to adults speak, and let them ramble when they talk politics because they have actually lived through much of it.<br>  <br>  Finally the most obvious part: Get involved in the community. Volunteer as much as you can and hang out with supportive friends. Help people, and don't worry about money.

An FBI recruiter once told me join the military, get a security clearance, then apply for the FBI before your enlistment ends. <br>  <br>  I spoke with another recruiter and they told me to get a Master's degree in Accounting, Business, or Public Administration. After that they said be a police officer for three to five years.<br>  <br>  And there you have it.|`|AA11315360	Very hard.

DXXpHKupaa	It is said that something unified now, with time, will again divide.<br>  <br>  This was bound to happen again.<br>  <br>  The people have effectively lowered themselves to being sheep of political parties as opposed to shepherds of the nation because they consistently fail to correct their own issues.<br>  <br>  This was a flaw in human nature-wired either by a careless creator or spontaneous occurrence.  No matter, it's there and we have to deal with it.  <br>  <br>  And to deal with it we must understand what drives men to rally around such people and causes.<br>  <br>  Freedom has so many meanings-applicable to almost any field or endeavor.<br>  <br>  Freedom in this case, is most often sought from responsibility and blame-not from persecution and tyranny.<br>  <br>  So to, with our nation as we see now.<br>  <br>  People join these parties first and foremost to belong and to have someone else to blame.  Anything organization, any dogma, no matter how virulent it may be, is more preferable to the masses than nothing at all.<br>  <br>  Many are not aware that we have a Communist party.  We even have a Monarchy party in the United States.  Since these are less desirable, few join them, instead going to the larger parties of the Republicans and Democrats.<br>  <br>  Why do people need to belong?  Because that is our nature.  We are social animals, and we desire not so much being led, but more so being part of something greater than ourselves-such as a political party.<br>  <br>  Here is where the divide comes in.<br>  <br>  A movement like these does not need to believe in any sort of God, but it does need to believe in a sort of Devil-a great opposer, on whom all faults can be blamed and all misfortunes are attributed.<br>  <br>  The Republicans have the Democrats<br>  The Nazi's had the Jews<br>  The Communists have the Capitalists<br>  <br>  So long as another entity can be blamed-we can escape that blame.  This is why one party states often suffer frequent revolts-they have no one else to blame.  The weight of the masses is too much to bear for a single party state.<br>  <br>  But with two parties, a state can maintain itself-rightfully or not.  Don't like the Democrats?  Join the Republicans!  Don't like the Republicans?  Join the Democrats!  There's plenty of blame to give and none to take.<br>  <br>  And this is what happened after the American Revolution.<br>  <br>  There were the Loyalists and the Revolutionaries.  Two groups vehemently opposed.  When the Loyalists were defeated more or less, there was no one left to blame for any mistakes becoming of a new nation.  So a divide was deemed necessary.<br>  <br>  From the outset, we divided ourselves.  Better to blame half of our own nation than even shoulder one fault on our own-that is the prevailing thought process today.<br>  <br>  There is comfort in this divide for the fanatically ignorant.  As much as the Conservatives despise the Liberals and vice versa-the victory of one over the other would bring about eventual depression when the weight of the nation rested upon the victor's shoulders alone.  They must find a new Devil to alleviate this burden.<br>  <br>  That is the truth.|`|rYE9VLQdaa	I agree, I read through the politics and think how many left and right extremists must really hate democracy.

Not many things are more important than what our government is up to, yet many seem to not care. Those people in office aren't smarter or better or even less ignorant than the rest of us. The fact is that they are just people, and as we all know people (even the best of us) are flawed, and imperfect. As such, we the people, must keep them (all of them) in constant check. If we do not, we will loose it all.

AA11909745	It appears that you have some issues with the police in your state.<br>  <br>  My best advice to you at this time is for you to retain a lawyer who is skilled in handling this kind of thing. And, tell him EXACTLY what went on at the last few times you were in court and the EXACT circumstances of your ticket.

I do not feel represented by anyone in our government to be quite honest.  Whenever there is a "good guy" that goes into office and truly has a desire for change to make things better for the people, it isn't long before they are whipped into shape by the political machine that is our government and astonishingly they become quiet and just go along with whatever comes down the pike.  <br>  <br>  My son did a paper on powerful governments throughout history and it was amazing that most of them did not last very long after about a 200-year period - the main reason - power and greed on behalf of those in charge.  It's very sad and perhaps there should be a revolt on all our part to get things back to some semblance of true government for the people - not for special interest groups or lobbyists or those who have all the marbles!

However, if a man succeeds then it is obvious that their achievements are largely due to their own work, not the help from "a woman." Women nor men contribute to someones success.

You have a right to challenge the administrators findings and present your own findings called rebuttal.<br>  A lot of schools are never challenged on their so called Administrative rules and get away with everything.<br>  Due process has to be followed by all agencies.

Forbid agency persons who have an interest in the case to sit in the hearing and decision making process of the outcome.<br>  <br>  4. opportunity to present conflicting testimony, evidence facts etc.<br>  <br>  5. Must state for the record all findings and conclusions of laws about guilt or innocence.<br>  <br>  6. present a formal avenue to appeals.<br>  <br>  7. Prepare for a judicial Review of matters if necessary.|`|AA12134591	Your proper route to a hearing in this matter would be through the school board.  The shear fact that you ask for a hearing on the matter will cause the Principal and others within the system to make dang sure that they have THEIR end of the charges well defined before this ever happens...<br>  But, make damn sure that you have a good case for your defense before you go before THESE people... because, if you don't...and you are seen by them to be guilty and wasting their time... they will more than likely hand down a judgement that will make the 5 day thing look like a holiday at Disney !!<br>  <br>  ? ////|`|hcKoFZ3Daa	If you didn't do it, you simply tell the principal that you didn't do it. He suspends you and you would say it is not fair because you didn't do it. Make him believe you with your evidence. If he still doesn't believe you, just let it go. If you really want to make it a big case, go to the school board.

This is referring to the Patriot missiles currently set up in Israel which is the 1st line of defense for that country should they ever get attacked by any surrounding countries (like Iraq in the 1st gulf war) He really exudes the sentiment of "screw Israel" with his foreign policy rhetoric which makes the muslim/arab countries surrounding  Israel salivate.

And as far as Obama's name goes, do research. His father was from Africa, mother and family from America. Are we not the "melting pot"=America?

ea053a21443b3b6de2f7175812b6ac91aa	We don't have peace, our commerce is entirely driven by debt, every relationship with every nation is entangled in webs of deceit and coercion, yeah, I'd say we have failed. <br>  <br>  But then again we have also not followed Jefferson's other advice, that we need a revolution every 20 years.   (I'd probably change this to 50)  We've been having technical revolutions but no political revolutions.   <br>  <br>  That's why everything Jefferson saw as a danger in our system has become reality.  <br>  <br>  We won't get back to sanity unless the power distribution in America were completely overturned.   This will not happen by choice because the population is too ignorant.  <br>  <br>  However, it could easily happen due to resource shortages.  Lots of people are rooting for this because the alternative is the obliteration of the natural environment that actually sustains life on the planet.   <br>  <br>  In the long term, civilizations(especially pretend ones, like most of them) are always punished for their faults.   <br>  <br>  As such, the outlook is grim.

ee7afa2284dbb71d60c6d9445eb13af8aa	The depression only ended because of WWII. Obama will continue his escalation of the war in Afghanistan and probably engage Iran as well. This will serve two purposes: (1) save the economy and (2) create another diversion to yet again take massive control over this country's citizens and businesses and get away with it.

Millions of people benefitted--some (Republicans) wanted people to starve waiting for the economy to pick up.  The Tennessee Valley Authority opened up the Ohio River valley and upgraded the quality of life for millions in that region.  There are many examples of good things from the New Deal.  The stimulus currently will keep many first responders in their jobs (who would otherwise be laid off), and will help with construction projects.  This is ALWAYS done during a downturn, when private investment can't supply enough jobs.|`|GPBWSVQHaa	The 'gains' you see in your source chart expand up to 1937, the bubble popped AGAIN in 1938 because the government ran out of money to use.

PUT THAT IN YOUR DUDKA AND SMOKE IT COMRADE!!!|`|hhJrwRNdaa	The indicators are ample enough to already show the flaws in this fruitless effort to restore this economy.<br>  <br>  A dent has not been made to curb or even slow down the decline. Fact is the DOW has fallen over 2000 points since Nov 28 ( shortly after the election) when it was showing some signs of stability.<br>  <br>  When the "New Deal" was put into effect a major effect was felt the day it started and the economic situation immediately started on the up swing.<br>  <br>  It's difficult to contrast the two. The economic down swing is the same in principal but the people are not.<br>  <br>  It is impossible for the office worker who is without a job to even think about taking a job working in the infrastructure rebuilding as a cement worker and the government has to many handout programs that support their decision.<br>  <br>  Under the "New Deal" if you didn't work you didn't eat. Not so today.

SHtTPBieaa	Rush Limbaugh is a fat rich drug fiend that tells Americans to be more responsible and have better self control.  While sounding like he isn't insanely rich himself he makes the proposed tax increases on the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans (just a repeal of the Bush tax cut, not an actual increase) sound like an increase on all of us.  He's all for tax breaks for the wealthy because they bless us little folk with jobs, yet for all his wealth he employees very few people in real meaningful jobs.|`|54601f6ca2b038fe7a92154c08ebd2c9aa	I think Rush is a great face for the GOP.

There is no reason to. Everyone with 2 brain cells working knows that it's going to take time and pain to resolve this crisis. Obama and others are working on it.

He manipulated the Dem's into voting for him. Got the Dem Natl. Committee to not count Michigan and Florida so he could beat Clinton in primary races. I think he is terrible, but all he ever said was he was going to "change" things. Total bankruptcy with no hope of recovery IS a change. Total socialism IS a change. I guess he was telling the truth.

That being said any time a woman finds herself with an unwanted pregnancy she and only she should decide if termination is right for her, any crack pot that claims a cluster of cells has more rights than the person carrying them has no right to decide for her. Her body, her choice.|`|zejFr1Ciaa	My guess is if your getting the tub with a brother who's old enough to do that there's more going on than just taking a bath together.|`|Msd9PiRGaa	She's bullshitting you. Something else happened that she's not telling you.|`|fTIFiK3oaa	I can't really tell you what to do in this situation. However, I can tell you that this is a very unlikely scenario. First of all, if a guy did something like this in the bath tub, wouldn't he let the water out after he was finished? Second, why would she get into the same water that he washed in. For one, the water is unclean and two, it's just plain weird. <br>  <br>  In my honest opinion, I think this girl is addicted to drama. She wants someone to be interested in her life. What she doesn't realize, she doesn't need to say something like this just to get attention.<br>  <br>  I agree with you, something else happened and she just isnt letting on. She needs some serious help!|`|diCASlUXaa	It's not a good idea.  Best she tough it out and have the baby.<br>  <br>  and I don't think this scenario is medically possible.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and if someone's trying to kill you, of course you have the right to defend yourself.  (that doesn't mean you have the right to use excessive force). <br>  Like if a 20 year old with a gun was being attacked by an 80 year old......the 20 year old has the right to defend himself/herself, but doesn't have the right to shoot the 80 year old who's probably not a dangerous threat.|`|7a052f4b82dc236860d3d7bc3540fcaaaa	Its up to her entirely.  A life is a life however it is conceived and whether or not the women wants to take on the responsibility of making that life is entirely up to her.  If there are any circumstances which she considers appropriate for termination then she should be given the opportunity for that choice,|`|tf2rU7xCaa	I don't think you can get pregnant that way, because sperm are sensitive to pH/environment changes and would likely die before reaching her.|`|E9yH3tWMaa	I consider the circumstances irrelevant. If an unmarried woman wants an abortion, it should be available on demand.|`|xhSsby6Taa	first, why is she bathing in the nasty water her brother bathes in? second, no - murder is never okay.|`|ZphAhwy6aa	I would call Harvard, they would pay good money to prove something like this is possible...|`|sNPjBNEqaa	yes, i'd say that was okay<br>  as is abortion for rape victims in my opinion,<br>  but the decision is up to the individual, some people just have abortions for unplanned pregnancies, so i guess it's up to whomever is pregnant..

eulMjLtPaa	There are several issues that the court is deliberating.  One is about equal protection under the law (and if it has been violated); another, more pedantic one, is if Prop 8 is an amendment or a revision.

I saw the arguments with the CA Supreme Court yesterday and everyone made interesting arguments and I must say, Ken Starr's arguments were very good.|`|c07v7O80aa	The process is under way to determine if it's lawful. Ultimately, since it's a pretty fundamental equal protection claim, it will no doubt be heard by the Supreme Court, and we will see how they interpret the Constitution. That will be the law. It is certainly possible to frame a church/state argument to go along with the equal protection claim, but it's the weaker claim, since while there can be no State religion, a majority may and sometimes does vote their religious beliefs on public policy issues. You can't really separate that aspect of religion from popular public policy expressions. But the answer to your question is, "We'll see."|`|r8drw5Dcaa	It never was run by the Church.<br>  That's not to say they didn't believe in god, they didn't think that anyone would dismiss god all together.<br>  In other words it was unthinkable that anyone would question the existence of god, but they just didn't want one religious organization to be controlling every-ones right to believe in god the way they wanted too.<br>  <br>  Being gay is not the norm, I don't care how you word it or justify it, it's just not right in the eyes of god, and it's not right in the laws of nature.<br>  <br>  I don't care if they love each other, some people love their pets sexually, should we allow them the same rights as gay people, how about pedophilia, other people have sex with women's shoes; these are all not the norm and would fall into the same category.<br>  Personally I want gays to do whatever they want, I don't care.<br>  As long as their not in the "closet", they won't be breeding with their "Cover" mate.|`|vwtANn8aaa	the declaration of independence isn't law, the constitution of California is, and it currently has an amendment that bans gay marriage in the state. so, its very legal.<br>  <br>  and if the majority of voters believe what is written in the bible, thats fine. they can vote according to what they believe regardless of where they get thier beliefs. <br>  <br>  the idea of separating church and state was established to avoid a situation like they had in england at the time we gained independence where the king was also the highest clergy in the church of england. americans wanted to avoid having the head of state also be head of the church. it doesn't mean that our laws can't bear semblance to biblical or other religious laws.|`|VNBJoC89aa	I guess the answer a politician would give you is that the Declaration of Independence was simply what its title implies: a declaration asserting our independence from Britain. It only stated the opinions of the founding fathers. Though many aspired to have a country in which "all men are created equal", they never would have added this phrase to the Constitution because it would have illegitimized slavery, preventing the southern states from signing it. That's politics.|`|K8guFb2paa	I agree that Prop 8 is bad.  But the Declaration of Idependence isn't a Constituion.  It was a very well-written letter to the king of England.  It was a way for the colonists to outline why they didn't like what England was doing.  So technically, according to the Declaration of Idependence Prop 8 isn't illegal.  It's a crappy bill though.|`|zj91sSsuaa	Being gay is a medical condition, and yes it can be corrected.<br>  I have explained it MANY times on this site.<br>  So if the condition is treatable, how does that entitle one to certain rights?

However, I think right-wing denial of science (a phenomenon not limited to climatology) is more due to theological reasons. For climate change, they believe the universe is 6000 years old, and was created specifically for humans. As such, they don't accept that humans could ever due anything to substantially harm the planet - because to them, God will take care of it. Besides, Jesus is coming back soon anyways, so... Use it or lose it!|`|LLnNjH94aa	You're less than a fool if you think only Republicans don't buy into Al Gore's nonsense.|`|kNJbZeCgaa	no, they are intelligent enough to investigate the claims by those who are proponents of GW, and they realize very quickly that it is  poorly researched and psuedo-scientific in its conclusions.  In addition, the most vocal proponents, often who are employed in the public education systems, or are ultra-leftist/liberal in their politics, are utilizing the half truths and flawed conclusions to further their own political agenda.  Lets see, in order to 'fight anthropogenic GW', we must impose governmental controls on private companies to limit their profits, control the way they do business, and redistribute the wealth to all-remind you of any politicians you might have heard of??

We don't have enough historical data to even determine that it's real, and what is there is sketchy at best  We've even got some scientists coming out with the idea that we're headed for a new ice age.  Many won't even call it global warming any more because they can't support it so it's referred to as "global climate change".  If we don't have the data to determine beyond reasonable doubt that it's real, or even get the scientific community mostly on board with the same story, then we can't effectively combat it.

We get up, go to work and do it all over again the next day. We don't have time to hug trees or protest. We don't want to be taxed over a phantom issue. We want to actually enjoy the money that we earn.|`|mlZahKNqaa	Yep, that's why they're against global warming. I'm 'for' global warming myself. I don't like being cold.|`|zJecdxXcaa	Get with the program, guys.  Scientists are telling us now the problem is global cooling.|`|f32fab1eea4e11e137dd528a9ce02f4faa	You're for global warming?  I think you misread your pamphlet.|`|xhSsby6Taa	no, they (we) are against it because it's a myth|`|m9MMxjyjaa	no such thing....|`|JNvjPoCSaa	As posed, your questions, I do not believe can, be answered.<br>  <br>  If I extrapolate from what you have written as questions what I presume you are asking then, hypothetically, I must rewrite the questions I presume you are asking:<br>  <br>  Are Republicans not supportive of initiatives regarding ‚ÄòGlobal Warming‚Äô because ‚ÄòGlobal Warming‚Äô is caused by wealthy countries such as the United States?<br>  <br>  <br>  My answers: ‚Äúno‚Äù and ‚Äúno‚Äù.<br>  <br>  I did not know they were against 'Global Warming', but if that is the case, it may be because they live in areas that are already warm enough.<br>  <br>  First I would not conclude that any one party is for or against initiatives regarding ‚ÄòGlobal Warming‚Äô.<br>  <br>  ‚ÄòGlobal Warming‚Äô has become a term defining ‚ÄòClimate Change‚Äô as primarily ‚Äòman-caused‚Äô. The difficulties (in my opinion and oversimplified) begin with the numerous short cuts taken for such a conclusion, leaving out data which was not convenient, not available and some simply avoided.<br>  <br>  ‚ÄòClimate Change‚Äô as a term, was not intended to define a cause but rather to address plausible and likely hardships which will arise from changes in our climate.<br>  <br>  Historically men have lived through two small ice ages in the last two millenia with a period far warmer between them than anything we have had since the second of them ended around 1600. That alone should ‚Äòraise a few eyebrows‚Äô when it is suggested that mankind with our industrialization causes ‚ÄòGlobal Warming‚Äô since industrialization only began in the 1800‚Äôs.<br>  <br>  Am I suggesting we should no longer worry about what we put into the air, water and landfills?, no, of course not. In fact I believe what this country and many of the other ‚Äòwealthy countries‚Äô have done toward betterment has produced many wonderful improvements since the 1970‚Äôs, but there remains lots of room for improvement.<br>              <br>  Unfortunately ‚Äòcauses‚Äô such as the ‚ÄòGlobal Warming‚Äô type are not working toward such goals, not in the absolute sense. Almost all I have been able to see are ways for people to make money off those who feel guilt toward what they contribute in the way of pollution. The reflexive type approaches toward such endeavors have (so far) been doing nothing other than increasing the same problems they are supposed to address (new problems in same categories only worse) and creating additional financial stress to economies which were already soon to be in the trouble we are in today (as a whole, most countries). <br>  <br>  Please understand that I am not suggesting this as the soul cause of our economic woes, far from it, just another component.<br>  <br>  Whether man existed on the planet or not, the Climate would continue to change as history has shown, as Geology has shown, as Science has evidence and as we see today.<br>  <br>  Should we do something about it?, you had better believe it. <br>  <br>  Should we toss money into the ‚ÄòGlobal Warming‚Äô system?, absolutely not! <br>  <br>  I suspect the most difficult part in addressing the true issues will be finding those who will actually work toward preparing our countries for the future and not simply pilfer the funds for themselves or their ‚Äòfriends‚Äô.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, if someone is supporting ‚ÄòGlobal Warming‚Äô as a cause, they have most likely figured out how to gain power or financially from it.<br>  <br>  <br>  toad|`|EdnQBmxZaa	Newsflash...India and China emit more greenhouse gases than the US.  Also, it is no longer global warming, but rather "climate chaos".  The problem with climate chaos is it can never be refuted...the climate constantly changes. This is just a clever way to tax us.

When George Bush was elected (correction appointed by the supreme court) there was not as much complaining from the left as I ever hear from the right. And that election was stolen, fact! The right has complained all through the years of prosperity during Clinton's administration. Now the country has experienced the fallout of 8 years of extremely poor government.<br>  <br>  What you are doing is dividing the nation, NOT supporting your country. The right complains about the left not supporting the troops. Well you are not either.

Bush and McCain have terrible tempers.<br>  5) he will think TWICE before sending my husband, my father, my american brothers and sisters out to war.<br>  7) UM HE'S THE ELECTED PRESIDENT SO GUESS WHAT?

Because of the sin of homosexuality, so to me, if GOD is against homosexuality, I think anyone who calls themselves a Christian, and supports gay marriage is a hypocrite.  I believe in the traditional family values defining marriage as between a man and a woman, and I applaud the voters in California for overturning the gay marriage law.|`|POfAilFfaa	i also will be answering your questions in order:<br>  <br>  i have no problem with Conservatives as long as they don't have a problem with me<br>  <br>  i am concerned about any minority group that has been discriminated against ussualy by the conservitive end of the table especcialy homosexuals because even though the separation  of church and state is one of the foundations of our country they can still not be married.<br>  <br>  i also dont like the phrase fix them, would you like us to fix the blacks as well? thats just down right wrong. and god has no place in government.<br>  <br>  ill wrap up my answer with a quote from the great mark twain: "go to heaven for the climate hell for the company"<br>  <br>  see you in hell|`|lHDff8Braa	Wow, get off your high horse.<br>  Some of us liberals believe in God too!<br>  <br>  It's questions/rants like this that continue to have me believe that conservatives are arrogant, intolerant and ignorant.|`|q9PVawNyaa	Two very important things in the Bible.<br>  <br>  1: All sins are equal.<br>  2: Judging others is a sin.<br>  <br>  According to the Bible you are just as much a sinner as a homosexual.<br>  By your logic you will burn in hell.<br>  <br>  You fail to realise this.<br>  You are ignorant.<br>  Enjoy.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	Why are you so concerned about the homosexuals as well?<br>  <br>  To tell you the truth, you people see far more "concerned" about homosexuals than liberals. <br>  <br>  "Why can't we begin to worry about how to fix them?"<br>  <br>  Because nothing is wrong with them. They are just gay. It's not a disease, it is a sexual preference. <br>  <br>  "How to make them follow in the path of god?"<br>  <br>  It's a free country, they don't have to follow any god if they don't want to.<br>  <br>  "Don't you understand that you are all going to hell? Non-believers will burn in hell!...Science is ignorant."<br>  <br>  Science is what gave you the computer you are using to post this nonsense. Without medical science there is a good chance you would have died already. Did you ever have to take an antibiotic? If you did, there is a possibility that you might have died without it. You are telling me you want me to believe in an imaginary place, and then telling me science is ignorant in the same breath.<br>  <br>  And another thing:<br>  <br>  If you people paid half as much attention to "Thou shall not kill" as you did to "It is an abomination for a man to lie with a man...",  I might have some more respect for you.|`|fL0wHyNNaa	I'll answer your questions in the order you asked them.<br>  <br>  I tend to dislike social conservatives.

The believe crazy concepts like the federal government basing policy on the Bible.<br>  <br>  Liberals love America for its freedom and equality.  We are concerned that homosexuals, who can not be discriminated against by law in almost every other aspect of society, are not allowed to enter into legally binding commitments of love with each other.  We have a hard time accepting the inequity that straights can marry but gays can't.|`|67dWrrH9aa	Are you enjoying those mushrooms?/<br>  <br>  <br>  Well I support gay marriage because anything otherwise is discrimination. Anyone who thumbs down this is ignorant and needs to reform their societal thinking. People are BORN gay. It's been countlessly proven. Since marriage is a right given to "all" humans, By denying them marriage is basically telling them they do not deserve to be human. This is just like not allowing blacks to marry. 40 years ago, blacks couldn't marry because the "BIBLE" said that it was wrong. Anything can be formed from the bible. NO ONE SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE A SECOND CLASS CITIZEN. It's all human rights.|`|b6c9b3f40f9ac8337ea22396c739b02faa	I do not for one instant believe that wanting to be as altruistic as possible and spending my life trying to help people less fortunate than I am will ever result in eternal damnation. Jesus did not surround himself with the pious; he spent his days trying to help the public, most of whom were considered lowlifes and sinners. It is people like you who have completely misconstrued the Bible and what it means to be Christian who will be paying for their misdeeds for all of eternity. It is not your place to pass judgement on anyone else; only to do whatever you can to help your fellow man and YES... that includes those who sin (which all of us do, whether you want to admit it or not).|`|U9Cy79anaa	Looks to me like conservatives are the ones concerned about homosexuals. Why do you get so uptight over sexual sins? God's a busy man. He has the whole universe to run. Don't bother him with these trifles.

Front row seats here i come.|`|eeGn51Oiaa	It's such an honor to answer God directly--the holder of all knowledge. <br>  <br>   Just a few questions for you: How did Noah keep all of the animals from fighting? Were dinosaurs real? Also, did Adam really bite the apple? And, when did life appear on Earth? Oh yeah, the earth is only a few thousand years old. I love you sort try to get around that question by never giving a direct answer to it. <br>  <br>   So, you think that 80% of the world's population is going to hell. What a God you believe in. Go pray to your God that plans on burning 4 billion of the world's population. I give God more credit than you.We have a separation of Church and State in this nation. Keep your religion out of my life. If you hate gays that your thing, but don't say that they have no rights because your God also hates them. Liberals don't care what you think about religion. <br>  <br>  We have to do what is just here on earth and let God sort it out--you don't speak for God. Discrimination is wrong. The world is not only a few thousand years old, and you don't know what "God" thinks about gays. Did God speak to you: If so, get the help your sort needs. <br>  <br>  PS: Clinical studies have shown, time and time, again that homophobes are easily aroused by naked pictures of men. Just like that senator who, one month before said gays are morally wrong, tried to have gay sex in a bathroom where children could have walked in. Oh yeah, it was just footsy. Sixty-year-old men play with other mens feet while sitting on the tiolet all of the time--sure!!! Those who hate gays are often gay. Why do you care about the gays so much--what did they ever do to you? Why are you so concerned about gays--what does it matter to you what two people do behind a closed door--if it doesn't hurt you or anyone else. Get over yourself.

bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	In my opinion he is harassing you. I do not think his lease trumps the law but you did sign the lease, (without reading?) Be very careful of this landlord and be sure you document any and all dealings with him.|`|BHBQPFzlaa	The answering machine message suffices. Otherwise you could just ignore your messages, and not open any mail from him and you could prevent him from accessing his own property. <br>  <br>  Cigarette burns and other damage to the property could be grounds for keeping part of your security deposit, but not to throw you out.<br>  <br>  VT law trumps the lease, in all respects. Even if he says "you relinquish your right to ____ under VT law" in the lease, it doesn't matter. State law supersedes all legal agreements.|`|eulMjLtPaa	If your landlord tries to comes in without good reason to the point you feel harassed, you can sue your landlord. The judge can order your landlord to pay you for your "actual damages" . She can also order the landlord to stop coming into your apartment without good reason and without fair notice. If you have a lawyer and you win a hearing, the court can also order your landlord to pay your lawyer fees.<br>  <br>  He cannot write something into the lease that violates Vermont state laws.|`|RJcVtLAxaa	I once had a landlord who did the same thing. He would come in at odd hours without even calling. Once a friend of mine and her boyfriend slept over, and he walked in on them having sex. We eventually moved out.|`|c6e4f1055e2cd01c39d43355e5af4d01aa	Your land lord is in violation. Get an alarm system. Call your local sheriffs dept.|`|7ot3Rqgpaa	He has to make contact with you. How else is there any confirmation you got the notice? If no contact is made he has to try again at a later time when the two of you confirm that he is coming to "inspect"<br>  <br>  If the furniture moving isn't in your lease then he has no right to say anything. If it was not written in what you signed, he can't just add things.<br>  <br>  Same with the smoking, if it wasn't written in the lease that you signed, there's not much he can do about it. You could even smoke in the house if there is nothing about smoking in your lease.<br>  <br>  As far as you signing the lease saying 24 hours and VT law being 48 I'm not sure which one would hold. My guess would be the lease because that's what the two of you agreed upon.<br>  <br>  I do think that he is harassing you. Is your lease almost up, is that why he says that he is bringing in perspective tenants? But from what you wrote you haven't done anything wrong it just seems like your landlord is a real pain. You should ask him what exactly needs to be inspected so often and for him to gather all the things that he has left behind in the apartment. After all you pay rent you shouldn't have to store his things or be worried about your landlord constantly wanting to pop over for yet another "inspection"|`|F6yfJSr9aa	It sounds like your privacy is being violated.  You should probably consult with a lawyer. When I had a legal question, I used quicklegalanswer.com. It was fast and very cheap. It helped me with my legal issue, I‚Äôm sure someone over there can help you with yours. Anywho, best of luck!!  Let me know if I can be of more help!!|`|ZQxCcG6qaa	if there isn't anything in the lease then your not breaking the lease.<br>  state law trumps tenant leases.<br>  <br>  you should inventory everything you own so you know if things are missing after he leaves and im not sure on this but i THINK you have to be at the residence for him to inspect...<br>  <br>  your best bet would be to talk to a lawyer to make your neither you or your landlord are breaking any contracts and that he is or is not doing anything wrong.<br>  <br>  you could also ask the landlord if theres any reason for him to inspect do often. ususally ( i live in PA by the way) landlords inspect once a month, same day every month..maybe you could work something out with him...ask him if monthly inspections with notice would work for him since your uncomfortable with all the inspections and find no reason for him to be so untrustworthy of you.
todJGCP8aa	I think some of these posters live in la-la land|`|C2HHfun2aa	You must get you info from the mainstream media and left wing blogs.<br>  <br>  Clinton gave Bush a softening economy. Then 911 threw the economy into a full recession. If Bill Clinton had taken Osama Bin Laden one of the 3 times Pakistan offered him then 911 may not have happened! <br>  <br>  The TARP bill was written and pushed by Democrats and they would have shut out Republicans altogether if they could have but they knew that TARP wouldn't work and wanted Republicans voting for it to give them cover so they gave them a few of the things they wanted. <br>  <br>  Then Bush enacted tax cuts to help stimulate the economy. As soon as the economy started turing around the Democrat party and their propaganda wing the mainstream media immediately started saying the it was the worst economy in 50 years despite that unemployment was lower than anytime during the Clinton administration.<br>  <br>  Bush and the Republicans realized that there was a problem with Fannie and Freddie that was caused by Democrat policies and corruption and tried 11 times to do something about it before it harmed the economy. But everytime Bush or the Republicans tried to reform Fannie and Freddie the Demcrats and mainstream media defended their policies and corruption.<br>  <br>  The first stimulus that Bush did was a giant waste of money and never should have happened.<br>  <br>  In the last two years Obama became a Senator and the Democrats controlled both houses.

The unemployment rate in that sector is now 21.4%, almost double where it was this time last year.<br>  <br>  Service-sector employment tumbled 375,000. Business and professional services companies shed 180,000 jobs, the fourth-straight six-figure loss, and financial-sector payrolls were down 44,000.<br>  <br>  Retail trade cut almost 40,000 jobs, while leisure and hospitality businesses shed 33,000 as households curtail nonessential spending.<br>  <br>  All this since Obama won the election in November.  Because of Obama's policies, anyone who has a job is afraid to spend money and the less they spend the more companies have to lay off. <br>  <br>  But Obama's budget more than doubles the national debt held by the public, adding more to the debt than all previous presidents -- from George Washington to George W.

otYOxmnuaa	Did your son report him?  If not, I doubt it...if nobody knew how would they have taken the proper steps and followed proper procedure to make sure it didn't happen again (suspend/expel)?<br>  <br>  You could probably file assault/battery charges against the kid...or at least file a report to prevent it from happening again w/o consequence.<br>  <br>  Or you could let your son sort it out/work it out -- make his own decisions/moves...it can be character building.|`|49491d4026350f4de724cb49c3744085aa	that is so sad.  our children are supposed to be safe at school.  find out what your school district's policy is on bullying and then head to the administration office.  i hope your child is okay and that you get the situation resolved real soon.  peace.|`|3149d8c79c2c2fd573c8fb1acb44e350aa	I am not sure about the lawsuit but you can try and press charges against the people who hit your son. Also talk<br>  with the school principal about what happened to him.<br>  Tell him you will hold him accountable for the safety of<br>  your son. Good luck. I work in a school and bullying is<br>  sad to say normal. It is hard to stop but keep complaining.<br>  Be a squeaky wheel and don't let up. If nothing is done then<br>  look into another school. Good luck with this.|`|u1DDrXO2aa	I doubt you can sue the school...although i do know you can take it to the school board and get him kicked out of school period.Good luck..sry you had to experience this!!!|`|AWSmknxLaa	What did the school do ?  nothing<br>  <br>  Sue the parents of the kids that hit him.<br>  <br>  Sueing everyone is not an answer. <br>  <br>  Geeez|`|SDhKNBBkaa	A school scuffle and you want to sue?<br>  <br>  Your son will soon be in the big world where he will have to look after himself...|`|OsWHFih1aa	Nope! It's not the school that beat your child up but another child like yours. Before you think about suing, you should visit your son's school and speak to the principal to get the matter resolved, you might learn some interesting things your son did to other children who's parent did not jump to sue the very school your son is going to.|`|F6yfJSr9aa	I think you can sue the school.  You should probably consult with a lawyer. When I had a legal question, I used quicklegalanswer.com. It was fast and very cheap.

Bank of America and Citibank are about to tank.  GM is going under.  While what you're doing is commendable, it's not enough to completely turn around the economy.|`|EzsnkxgVaa	The Republicans threw the election because they knew that they would never be able to fix the mess they made.<br>  <br>  History is littered with instances of the Democrats mopping up after Republican Presidents.<br>  <br>  (I mean Sarah Palin...really...)|`|AA11042510	Obama is 44 years old.  too young and unexperienced.

"Never let a crisis go to waste"...isn't that R. E's favorte expression?<br>  Economic wizard?  He's got a cabinet full of experts and treasury secretary who are the "best available to handle this crisis."  Naturally, none of them seem to pay taxes...but...I guess we need crooks in this time of crisis.<br>  How much of the "crisis" is created in order to get a power grab?  What is real and what is imaginary?<br>  The President IS able to affect the economy through his policies.  It can be done quickly.  Thus far, as you can see in Wall Street...who doesn't care if you're democrat or republican...they only go by results.  They think he's ineffective.  More people will lose jobs.  His own budget office indicates that the huge spending bill wasn't necessary and will delay the economic recovery.<br>  Americans will pay for this folly..and their grandchildren.  If we continue along the foreign policy...our children and grandchildren will pay with their lives.<br>  Thank you for your thoughtful response ("George Bush").  Two more...Barrack Obama.  Keep in mind we've already "Stimulated" the banking industry under GWB.  We've got "Top" men on it now.  Why do we need even more?

93M8Vccvaa	You are not being sued. Apparently no one took time to read and understand your question.  Frank is the defendant and your are the complainant. What this means is it looks like the city has filed some type of charges against Frank on your behalf. I repeat, you are not being sued.|`|qwaWd14vaa	Why do you have insurance? Get with your company and they should be representing you on your behalf.|`|KL1FQhJ9aa	Sure sounds that way, sorry to hear that.  I would contact the court admin office that you got the notice from and speak to someone who speaks plain english.  I know those summons are a bit cryptic.  Good luck, and sorry you ran into someone who could not handle the situation like an adult, you know, by being up front with you.|`|08903d0d28d85088f82efbb4397761cdaa	Yes you are getting sued. If you had insurance just turn it over to your insurance company and let them take care of things. Thats what you pay insurance for|`|AA11909745	Sure seems like Frank S is suing you to recover the damage to his car. Or even to him if his medical payments were not entirely covered by your insurance company. <br>  Frank S might also be suing you for loss of wages, if he was unable to go to work for some period when he had no car or was injured.<br>  Go down to the court in your area and see the Clerk of The Court, and ask to see the case that has been filed against you, if you do not understand what it says have the Clerk explain it. <br>  OR...get a lawyer...<br>  actually, the best idea is to do this it might cost some money but at least you will not be completely at the mercy of the lawyer who Frank seems to have hired who filed the case against you !!!

K2ecmzInaa	Your future employer should cover the cost of your pre-employment drug test. Should they not, the cost may be anywhere from $25-$75 depending where they send you.<br>  <br>  But like I said, your future employer should take care of it.|`|K4Y76H3qaa	Your employer is responsible to pay for the test...They will send you to a place in which they have an account and they can be billed.<br>  If you fail and you would like to have it re taken...Then you must paid.  The amount is from 35-80 pr test, depending on the lab|`|TCZz2OKvaa	I thought drug tests from independent labs weren't that expensive -- $20 or something. <br>  <br>  I'm wondering if you're afraid you'll test positive.  I never took one, but I'm a lawyer and have had clients do it.  The cost may vary by states.  Look up independent labs in the yellow pages and ask them.  Or find a social worker and ask them.    Maybe you want to look up how long these substances linger in your body.  Weed (THC) can linger for a month or so.  And don't try to dilute the sample by drinking excessive water.  A dilute sample is often considered positive because it looked like you were trying to BS them.|`|9kKX7IpRaa	Most companies will send you to a drug testing site and it is billed to the company.  Some smaller companies let the new hire pay for the drug test and if it is negative they reimburse him the cost. The bottom line is that most companies will pay for the drug test. <br>  A drug test can cost anywhere from $45-100, depending on where you are tested.<br>  With your added info the city will pay for your test.|`|kadNaNg9aa	u can buy one at most drug stores for between 25-50 dollars otherwise to have a lab do one it will cost around 500 dollars but if u are doing it for the company as a pre-employment drug test they will tell u when to go and cover the cost
XdGjhbfMaa	I don't know if they're required to install the carbon monoxide detectors, however I can tell you that they have to have a unit that produces heat and I'm almost certain that it has to be a furnace, not a fireplace.  It doesn't matter how much longer winter is.  It sounds like that basement isn't even legal to rent out, in which case you'd be entitled to every cent of rent that you've paid.  Definitely pursue this with whatever authority governs housing in your municipality as well as the state of West Virginia.|`|4uhyxMnmaa	I am SOOOOOOO glad that you did have the CO monitor installed!<br>  <br>  You need to research WV's law on housing & landlord/tenant issues.  Contact your local legal aid society to determine if representation is readily available w/o hiring a private attorney.<br>  <br>  Locate a WV tenant advocacy group, if possible.<br>  <br>  Contact the bldg. inspector of your municipality immediately.  Ask to get a copy of the inspection report & Certificate of Occupancy (CO) the landlord  is required to obtain before renting/leasing the premises.<br>  <br>  The landlord is required to maintain the habitability of the premises during the term of your occupancy.  Specific requirements for the installation of the CO monitor will be determined by local ordinance; again, the local bldg. inspector will educate you on this.<br>  <br>  This is a matter of the "implied warranty" that the premises are suitable for the use intended.  <br>  <br>  Without a working heating system adequate to maintain stated temps (for example: 70 degrees) between certain dates (for example: October 1 to April 30) in a location of a certain "design" temperature (for example:  15 degrees), the premises would be considered a "sub-standard dwelling" & illegal for occupancy, particularly in exchange for rental monies.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure it would be relevant in your city, but you might also want to research the International Property Maintenance Code, as revised in 2003.  It's a very reliable standard for general discussion & it's available online.<br>  <br>  You will also need to obtain a written report from the Fire Chief.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!  Kiss your daughter for me!|`|aAGcYAsNaa	In NYC it is the responsibility of the owner, or the developer acting on behalf of the owner, in any case where a Certificate of Occupancy will be issued. Then again, in NYC a basement apartment would, more likely than not, be illegal. My advice: get a battery operated CO2/Smoke detector - responsibility is irrelevant: they can save your life, and they're cheap enough.

Gm1LOjpXaa	In CT, reckless driving is punishable from at least a fine to a maximum of 3 years in jail. <br>  <br>  I find it very hard to believe that one would be put in jail for that unless someone was injured or something was damaged.|`|RJcVtLAxaa	Wow that's crazy. You're unlucky, however I don't think you can go to jail unless somebody was injured. I was pulled over for doing 110 in a 65 before, all I got was a $328 ticket.

"Murder" implies that the homicide was committed with malice aforethought, aka premeditation. You can have negligent homicide and it isn't murder.<br>  <br>  The differences are mainly technicalities in regards to intent. A homicide investigation is an investigation in a death that was considered not accidental or a suicide but once they get enough evidence the DA might charge the defendant with Murder 1, Murder 2 (aka depraved heart murder), Manslaughter, or Negligent homicide.<br>  <br>  Murder 1 intent factor: Malice aforethought, as in you intended to take someone's life on purpose.<br>  Murder 2 intent factor: Extreme disregard for someone's life like playing Russian Roulette, etc. The main difference between Murder 1 and murder 2 is that there was not a conscious premeditation in Murder 2.<br>  Manslaughter: Could be a heat of passion killing like walking in on your spouse in the act of adultery, or it could be vehicular manslaughter sometimes if it was just really reckless like driving drunk and killing someone.<br>  Negligent Homicide intent factor: Extreme carelessness like skiing way too fast down a mountain dangerously and accidentally hitting someone and them dying as a result of the impact.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	Your state may vary but in general:<br>  Murder is an overtly criminal homicide.<br>  Homicide is simply the legal term for ANY killing, even lawful self-defense, but is also sometimes used as a "catch-all" term when the specific crime is undetermined - as in a "homicide investigation" that will eventually become some degree of murder or manslaughter or be dismissed as lawful. (manslaughter is generally killing someone through an act which in itself may not be a crime - like some dumb-*** stunt.)|`|e3c2ed462851c4c6d6796055b93e6970aa	Homicide means unnatural death of a human.
