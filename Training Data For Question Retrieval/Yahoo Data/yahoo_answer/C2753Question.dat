20081108145249AASOkTC	Pets;Dogs	:( fleas on my puppy...?	I have a morkie (maltese/yorkie) and has just recently been infested with fleas. I also have a lab mix who might have them too.   My question is: How much would flea medication cost for the both of them? Like Advantage? My mother in law gave me a supply of it a long time ago and her last dose was given to her in July.       So for my morkie (only 5lbs)   And my lab (45lbs)      The cost of each? Also what can I do for them until friday when we can pick up the medication? They've both had baths and now we're limiting their time outside.      And will I have to make a vet appointment and have them seen or can I just call the vet and pick it up?

20070424182449AA3zPFn	Pets;Dogs	Why don't dogs get the common cold?	I have gotten the flu or a cold THREE times since New Years. It's really starting to irritate me, but I look at my dog and she never seems to be sick (I know, I'm lucky because fixing a sick dog can be expensive). But, anyway, my point is: Dogs don't seem to get a common cold-type virus like humans. Is it because they don't interact with other dogs as commonly as we do with people? Is Kennel Cough the dog equivalent of a cold? Just curious!

20081115181611AAZkBdl	Pets;Other - Pets	What should i do about my horse?	Ok...my horse Rowdy has a behavior problem.  When i kick (he is a western speed horse and leg pressure doesnt work with him) him to start moving or go faster he does a sidekick. I have tried everything from taking the saddle off and checking for thorns/stickers, lunging, using a crop, and massaging his shoulders and tummy. His gaits are perfectly fine and his legs arent swollen. He has NEVER acted like this before. I dont know if he is just tired of me kicking him to get him to go or if he was just having a bad day. I know for a fact that he has no health problems because he just got checked by a vet very recently! Im kind of worried that he may keep acting up like this. I am going to ride him tomorrow to see if things get better! PLEASE give me some advice and/or tips to resolving this problem! He is a GREAT horse. If i cant kick him or use a crop with him, i dont know what else to do! I will try round pen work tomorrow. I NEED TIPS! Thanks for your time everyone!

20070729151326AAXaOxr	Pets;Dogs	How long can kennel cough last?	I adopted a pom on June 2nd and that night I noticed a cough. I called the breeder and asked if it was kennel cough because I knew it was contagious and I had another dog at home. She stated it was not kennel cough and sent me some clavamox to treat it. She also said that she had all her shots the day before we adopted her. After a week she was no better brought her to the vet. Vet said she thinks it was kennel cough and put her on antibiotic and bronchodilator. Did not help brought her back again vet put her on new antibiotic and gave her a cough medicine. Each bottle of medicine is forty dollars. I am on my fourth bottle and she is still coughing. I'm wondering what should I do now.

Lately though she has become diabetic, had to have a radioactive iodine shot for a hyperactive thyroid (which is now hypo-active and needs to be medicated) and I believe she has skin cancer as her skin is covered in tumors. The vets need to do a biopsy, which is more money on top of the monthly expenditures. I'm just not sure I can keep it up... I would love some help!

The only thing is that the place is pretty small--but I would LOVE to have another kitty.  Are companions very beneficial to cats?  I hate that he's alone all day.

But I also want to take her old skeleton, and some dead crickets out, and I want to change her water bowl, but I'm afraid I will hurt her. I also turned the heater off, and turned her UVB lamp on. How long should I keep the light on? I will also mist her aquarium. What else do I need to do to make sure that she heals safely? When can I feed her again?

20090130150741AAJQ8VH	Pets;Cats	One of the stray cats I feed on the streets was hit by a van. How injured is she?	She was hit when she dashed across the street. I believe I noticed a sudden slowing down of the van but it drove off. I could not see the point of impact but heard a loud 'BOM'. She took a hard tumble, got up and carried on sprinting just as fast and immediately went under a fence. She wasn't wobbly or unstable at all. I checked the impact point and immediate area and there was no blood. She could not be heard or found in the surrounding area too. There's a very small possiblity the 'BOM' was goods in the van slamming when the driver hit the brakes. Van was going about 70 to 80km/h Could she sprinted like that with any broken bones. Could she have any internal injuries. Usually how do cats react immediately after impact ? I''m so worried now.

20090130162808AAuKp1j	Pets;Reptiles	Fire belly newt question?	Highlander our baby newt was hatched last march. He's very active swimming and walking around on the bottom of the tank. He is fed live brine shrimp as that's the only live food I can get for him. He has grown considerably since hatching but his tail looks nothing like the adults and he still appears to have gills.    He has a " land " area in his 10 gallon tank but he never is seen out of the water. He spends a little time on plants close to the surface but he's never out of the water.       I've read that baby newts are supposed to have a terrestrial stage in life but he hasn't reached it yet.  From the books I've read they're supposed to be mature at 2 years. Does that mean he'll look like an adult newt in 2 years or sexually mature?      Is my newt lagging behind. What should I be looking for.    I'm finding it hard to find informative websites most of them give very little information.       He's the only survivor out of 12 eggs. How can I ensure that more survive if my newts lay more this spring.  Also some of my friends have asked about getting baby newts from us if we have more eggs. what age would be good to rehome them. As eggs? as tiny newts? after a few months? or after a year?

20090130184730AAic3U7	Pets;Horses	Horse's Joints In Cold Weather?	Lately, we have had a lot of cold, wet, snow weather. My horse is getting older, but is not aged yet. He is worked on a regular basis, and is extremely happy.    But, with the weather, he has been sooooo stiff. It takes him 40 minutes to an hour to warm up, and become not so stiff. Once he has worked out of it, he is fine.    His joints (mostly around his hocks) take the toll. He has a stall that he is kept in during nights, and whenever it is rainy/snowly/bad weather. But he still gets cold and stiff. He has a huge stall, and plenty of room to walk in.    Is there any products I can use to help keep him warmer, or stop the stiffness?  Or is there a service? (acupuncture, massage, ect)    I understand what you say, but he has a huge stall.  The dimensions for the stall are: 12ft x 12ft and he has a walk in field attached to it.  http://s240.photobucket.com/albums/ff32/...    I don't have a good picture of it, but there is about half of the room in the field thing.    But this only happens when it gets cold. He is fine in the summer, sping, and fall. He only gets stiff in the winter, when it has been cold out.    When I put leg wraps on him, they don't reach up to the hock/point of hock. That is the part right between the lower leg (where you would put polo wraps) and the part that would be a thigh on the humans.

20090130195626AAHUQ7p	Pets;Dogs	What do I do with my destructive lab?	I have had a lab pup for a month now. She is 10 months old. She is crate trained. I was keeping her in a kennel up until this week when she figured out how to open her kennel. She has destroyed my house two days in a row. She is incrediibly gentle and sweet believe it or not so I would really like to keep her. I have already had to spend almost a hundred dollars in repairs. Going crazy! She was in a plastic kennel with ametal door. Now I think i probably need to get a all metal kennel?  I believe she has severe separation anxiety. She sleeps with me but when I go to work she has to be in a kennel. I leave at 7:30 am and get home at 5pm. I know that is a long time for her to be locked up but i have no choice. In an attempt to keep her active I do walk her for a long time when i get home.  I take her to the dog park on Sat and Sun. I can't go during the week because it is a far drive.

20090130181811AAmi6ck	Pets;Dogs	Questions about my dog- and training. very broad-please help?	Hi- I have a 6 month old Maltese named Louie. We've been having some problems with Louie as far as house training goes. We've recently moved so for awhile I was attributing these problems to that. We moved into a larger apartment with my fiance's family to help them out-  Our move definitely disrupted Louie's house training and we had to begin a new routine.    Also my fiance's mother is home with him ALL day (she has a Chihuahua who is "paper trained" although it's more like she's trained to urinate and defecate on anything that slightly resembles her potty pad.)   I felt Louie was getting a lot of mixed messages from everyone in the home as to where it is okay and not okay to go to the bathroom- SOO finally I decided to start his "crate training" over...we have sort of a little gated area we leave him in...and his feet only touch the ground once he's outside- First question I'm a little worried that he is going to see the mother's dog peeing inside (everywhere she wants) and begin mimicking that? Is that a possibility? Should i be worried??   Second Louie started peeing literally anywhere even in his "home" so i finally took him to the vet (today) to rule out everything (i was beginning to get sooo frustrated with the poor pup) He did have a pretty severe UTI and is now being treated. So i'm now feeling horrible for him- But am glad we found it.   Any suggestions as to what we could do? Training advice? And will he mi mick the other dog?

20090130181715AAaikOu	Pets;Dogs	How to shut my dog up.... he keeps barking...?	kay, well my dog's name is Sarge and he's a beautiful tri-color basset hound. but he's insanely stubborn (as the breed is). he barks and cries all the time and never shuts up. we walk him, feed him, do whatever and always give him plenty of attention. he's got everything he needs and more. and we even discipline him (not by beating him) for whining and barking. and this is real bad problem too. he does this all the time. and my dad works at night and cant sleep when he barks all the time. Sarge picked me as his person (even though bassets are more family-oriented dogs, he chooses me over my parents). my dad sees this and wants me to fix the problem. and his has stated that if his whining isnt fixed soon, he'll get rid of Sarge.    now i dont want to see my lovable oaf go. we've already gotton rid of one dog for agression issues. can anybody help me? i love Sarge more than any other dog in the world. i couldnt stand to loose him.     p.s. as beautiful as Sarge is, hes a complete idiot. no joke. i know im gonna here somebody say that dogs are smarter than they appear, and that bassets are intelligent because theyr born hunters...but trust me, hes pure idiocy. i love him, but i face the facts. crying and whining arent the only stupid things hes done despite training.    also, one of things that sets him off is seeing me. in fact, he even know when i get home from school and cries until i go see him. he just want to be with me all the time. i love him, but i cant spend every minute of the day with him.....

I found this saddle pad.     http://www.aretesaddlery.com/tack/tack/s...    Do you think it will help? or should i get a horse chiropractor in to try and help him? The saddle i currently use never seemed to cause him pain until i had to switch girths due to a break in one. Could this have a factor in his possible back pain? I know, lots of questions, but this is an area i don't know much about and any advice to make him more comfortable is greatly appreciated.

I didn't overfeed, the water is clean, and everything in the tank is new. My father just went out to the petstore to get medicine, and when he came home, I told him that I searched online and told him that we should change the water first and remove the filter before we put the medicine in. Then, he yelled and threw a fit at me, and said "with these chemicals, all we have to do is put them in and that's it!". I still wanted to do a water change but he got pissed and told me to do everything myself. Great. I've never had a fish tank before. I've never done a water change before. How do I do one? I have this stuff called EasyBalance by Tetra. Do I use this on the new water?      Please, someone help. I COULD take my fish back and get a refund, but I like this oscar way too much... I want to save him!

20090130195149AArr1ib	Pets;Fish	Interesting thing! =)?	A month ago I posted a question here about my two goldfish..which I knew I have one male and I thought the other one is female( I was right). The male is fantail goldfish (orange) and the female is a comet goldfish (white with the red dot..) I asked here,if it's possible that he wants to breed because he was chasing her and stuff..most people said that that's not really the reason..that he's being territorial and stuff..well one morning I found a big surprise. At the bottom of my tank were all these eggs..they were already orange..so I took some of them out..They ate all the ones I left in the tank (du uh,they eat everything =). NOW after 5 or 6 days I have little goldfish fries. About 20 of them. Right now I'm just waiting for their process.. to end so I can feed them. I'm sure they will be beautiful =)    I never used heater..I don't even have one, I wasn't planning anything and here it is. My fish chose what,when and how =)

20090130192945AAbL2R6	Pets;Dogs	My friend's dog has a people-biting problem... any help?	My boyfriend lives with his best friend and the best friend's girlfriend (I'll call her Sally). The girlfriend has a German Shepherd mix that's about two years old (I'll call him Rover), and the dog has a serious problem with anyone who does not live in the house.      Anytime I come over to see my boyfriend, I have to be wary of the dog because he is so protective of Sally. If Sally walks in the room when I'm sitting down and doesn't come too close to me, the dog is fine. But if Sally walks up to me or if I even get within ten feet of her, Rover runs up to me and will either stare me down with an aggressive-interested look or bite me! Sally punishes the dog, but it's not working because this has been going on for a year now.      Lately I've been taking matters into my own hands, and while I don't feel good about it, I've hit the dog on the nose when he bites, and if he looks like he's going to do anything, I make myself look larger and tell him in a strong voice to leave. It's works, but none of the aggressive behavior has changed! I still get bitten on the hand, leg, and butt, and Rover's almost gotten my face. It's gotten to where I can't even get up and walk around a room unless Sally is out of the house because Rover is so protective.Once she's gone, he's fine, but as soon as she comes in the room or back home, he snaps. The worst thing is that Sally doesn't get it (she's not the brightest crayon in the box) and she'll walk up to me and chat up a storm and make all these gestures with her hands. Next thing you know, Rover's tried to bite me and all Sally can say is "No no!"      How can I convince her to get the dog trained or rehabilitated without hurting her feelings? Sally does tend to take things personally, especially when it comes to Rover, but I can't take it anymore. I shouldn't have to be on guard when I visit my boyfriend, and I shouldn't have to stay away from that house just because one dog is protective-aggressive of an owner that refuses to train him, but I don't want to be there one day when he decides to possibly attack me. Sally works at Petsmart, so you'd think it'd be easy to get some training sessions. Also, the dog isn't neutered, and I've suggested to my boyfriend that they do that, but they don't have the money..... so what should happen?      (There are three other dogs in the house that are nothing like this. I don't blame the shepherd part of the dog - there is a full shepherd in the house that's as sweet as sugar. I also don't blame the genetics - the dog's sire also lives in the house and is a great old dog!)

He's one of the most show offy horses I've EVER seen and it's getting to the point where I'm tempted to sell him because he rears more then he listens. Let me tell you alittle about him first:   He's really had no real training except how to walk on a halter and he doesn't even really do that well   He's almost 17 hands, easily 16.1.   He has a bit of a temper, he gets frustrated when teaching him new things and usually paws or rears   Someone has been on his back ( Uncomfirmed) and he was gentelmen?   He IS a naturally sweet horse, only horse I know who loves to give kisses and will stand for HOURS just so you can scratch his ears. I was able to pick up his hooves with just a tap and trim his mane, ears, tail and whiskers while he was free standing with just a lead over his back.      Now for the info on the rearing. Flash has attacked the farrier. The farrier picked up his front leg and he was rearing up, bucking and striking out like he was completely untamed. They ended up having to tranquilze him but now, I can pick up his front feet fine, it's just his backs that he's having a hard time with.    Flash also has a tendency to rear up at his own shadow, he sees it and rears up then takes off but not really in a spooky matter. Sometimes he'll rear before he takes off, sometimes he'll just rear to rear but the most dangerous times is when I'm walking him and he rears up beside me.    I had him in the barn, about to go out and he reared up right in the door way, no warning at all. Ears forward and everything. Another time I was walking him and he reared up and gave me a push. I wasn't hurt, I don't think he was trying to hurt me but it did knock me a few feet. The first week we got him he reared up and slammed his hooves down. I just don't know what to do with him anymore to fix this. Can I honestly say I CAN break him if I can't even handel him on the ground? He is a spooky horse, he doesn't like strange noises or cows because cow's make him rear too. Just like everything else....      Note:   WE ARE GELDING HIM!!!!!!! Thank god... He's just NOT worth keeping a stallion. We bought him for his moves, not because he would make a good stud.   He is eatting 1 scoop of 10 percent pellets and 2 flakes of Bermuda Grass on 24 hour turnout   We are planning on getting a trainer when spring comes around and it isn't so DAMN COLD x.x -hates snow-
20090130200148AAGu7lx	Pets;Reptiles	Why is my baby redtail boa so calm all of a sudden?	My young red tail boa has cloudy eyes, indicating shedding, so i put him in water to both clean him and help him shed, but then his temperment changed from an active snake always trying to get away, to a calm sulking like one and he just relaxed on my shoulder for like 15 minutes straight barely moving other than to wrap halfway around my neck and chill out. why?
20090130200603AAVPdJE	Pets;Cats	Do cats get nasal allergies like people?	My cat goes through periods where he is stuffy, has a runny nose, and sneezes snot all over the place (in my hair, for example). I have bad allergies year-round, and I've noticed that his nasal issues consistently appear on the days when my allergies are at their worst. Could he be suffering the same type of allergies?      I mentioned this to my vet and she scoffed at the idea, but didn't offer a better explanation for his sneeziness. I'm wondering if my vet could be wrong. Because if she IS right, and it's definitely not nasal allergies, then I want to find out what the real problem is.      Note: I give him a quarter Clotrimeton when he's really snotty and it seems to help.
20090130201231AA0eKLh	Pets;Dogs	How do people live with dogs peeing and pooing inside their home?	I have been watching Victoria Stilwell's "It's Me or the Dog" and I am amazed how people can live in a home with dogs peeing and pooing everywhere.  I don't mean puppies which are being trained.  It is natural that they will have accidents.  I am referring to fully grown dogs which should, if they had been properly trained, known better.      The show the other day was 2 Greyhounds (gorgeous dogs) which were gated in the kitchen overnight and every morning and when they returned home there was pee and poo all over the kitchen.  Video footage showed the dogs walking through it and then jumping up onto the kitchen benches.  How can people live like that?  It makes my stomach turn just thinking about it.  My own dogs have been trained to stay out of the kitchen altogether - let alone not peeing and pooing through the house.      The stench must be stomach turning in their homes.        How can they live with this every day of their lives?

20090130201931AAG2gQl	Pets;Dogs	I've had my pit bull puppy for a few days now, and i was wondering...?	If he should have a long nose. I got him for christmas, but my aunt took him a few days after I got him, because she lived on a farm and he needed running space.Well, he started chewing and she gave my baby back! And i was wondering why he has a longer nose then all my other pit bull's i've had. Will he grow into it? Or is that normal? His mom was a blue nose APBT and his dad was blue and white... And when i first got him he had a blue tint, but now its almost black..Along with his nose . I need help!
20090130200514AAwPcI0	Pets;Dogs	Why does my dog lean against everyone?	She's a 10 month old blue tick hound mix.  She always leans her body against those she is familiar with, to the point that if they move she stumbles over.  Why does she do this?  Of my three dogs, she is not the dominant and does not see herself as dominant over us.
20090130202000AAtqqQ7	Pets;Dogs	Re: My dog with pyrometra?	The odd thing is.... She never and still does not act sickly.  Her physical activity and personality has always remained the same as it ever has.  The only reason why I allow her up the stairs is because she always has to be with me.  If I don't allow her up the stairs she puts more stress on her body then when I don't allow her upstairs.  I have slept downstairs on the floor to be with her so she wouldn't go up the stairs.  But when I need to go up, she wants to come with me.  The gate upset her more than it did to help her.  I have called the doctor.  I have spent over $2400 in the past couple of weeks to get her well.  Times are tough right now.  Went from being successful to not successful.  The only reason why she has had treatment thus far is because I agreed to wipe out $54,000 in past child obligation so my ex-husband would finance the surgery as I don't have the money to.  She had an appointment set up for tomorrow (Saturday), but she continues to see different doctors at the same vet clinic.  I demanded she see the Surgeon instead of different doctors.  All they could do was give me Monday.  All I want to know is ............Is my girl going to die?  Is this infection better since it is now clear?  The only reason why I never had her "fixed," was because my other dog who did get fixed died during the operation to be fixed.
20090130202616AARAPJp	Pets;Dogs	Getting dogs not to bark?	What are the best training tools to use to get dogs to stop unnecessary barking.       I like the fact that my dogs bark when a stranger approaches the house... but I'd like to minimize the rest of their barking... they bark at the neighbors, animals, random sounds, et cetera.      I've tried bitter apple spray and it hasn't worked.

20090130200501AA1V4qW	Pets;Dogs	Why does my dog do this?	My dog when given a treat will usually run off to the bedroom with it and eat it immediately. When we give her a bone , she instead will run around with it in her mouth, showing it to us every few minutes. If we go to work she will keep it and only eat it when we get home. She only does this with a bone because she is the greediest dog in the world and will usually wolf down everything  ASAP We are really curious as to why she does this with only some treats and not all and when she does it, why she does it. Any ideas?
20090130201633AAaUuKq	Pets;Cats	Why are my cats fighting?	Two of my male cats , Ace 2 yrs & Jester approx 8months, go outdoors. they both are not fixed yet (but will be real soon!). when they are inside they are comfortable with each other and get along good...but when they are outside Ace is mean to Jester. Normally when another male cat is around our place Ace does what my faince and i call the Death Meow right before he gets into a fight (which is why we try to keep ace inside until he gets fixed at least). I didnt think Ace would do this to Jester, but he did and thankfully i got to them before anything bad happened. Why is he giving Jester the Death Meow when they get along inside???

20090130201715AAj8hiP	Pets;Reptiles	My leopard Gecko is too Retarded.?	My leopard gecko is a female and has been living for about 2 - 3 years. She weighs about 37 grams and she doesn't want to gain anything. All she eats is crickets, ive tried mealworms and super worms, all she does is lick them. She eats about 5 large crickets every 2 days and still nothing happens. She also sheds really bad, meaning she doesnt eat he full skin i have to help her peal it off sometimes. Also she needs help eating sometimes, because shes slow and misses when she dashes for them, so i have to hand feed her. Any solutions to anything would be a help..
