I've gone back and forth on this most of my life, and finally decided to look at the death penalty system in action.  A lot of what I found surprised and disturbed me.  Sources below.<br>  <br>  Most disturbing is that innocent people have been sentenced to death.  Lots of them. 130 people wrongfully convicted people were sentenced to death and were lucky to be exonerated and released, eventually. DNA, available in less than 10% of all homicides, can’t guarantee we won’t execute innocent people. Obviously, if someone is convicted and later found innocent you can release him from prison, but not from the grave.<br>  <br>  A big surprise: The death penalty is much more expensive than life in prison, and it is well documented. The high costs of the death penalty are for the complicated legal process, and the largest costs come at the beginning, for the pre trial process and for the trial itself. The point is to avoid executing innocent people.<br>  <br>  Families of murder victims are far from unanimous about the death penalty. However, even families who have supported the death penalty in principal have testified that the drawn-out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative. <br>  <br>  Life without parole, on the books in 48 states, also prevents reoffending. It means what it says, and spending 23 of 24 hours a day locked in a tiny cell is not a picnic. It costs less than the death penalty. <br>  <br>  The death penalty doesn't prevent others from committing murder. Homicide rates are actually higher in states and regions that have it than in those that don’t.<br>  <br>  There are serious risks with speeding up the process. Over 50 of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade. Speed up the process and we will execute innocent people.<br>  <br>  The death penalty isn't reserved for the worst crimes, but for defendants with the worst lawyers. It doesn't apply to people with money. When is the last time a wealthy person was on death row, let alone executed?<br>  <br>  Unless you ignore all these things, it is hard to support the death penalty.<br>  <br>  Sources:<br>  Death Penalty Information Center, www.deathpenaltyinfo.org,  for stats on executions, reports on costs, deterrence studies, links to FBI crime stats and links to testimony (at state legislatures) of victims' family members.<br>  <br>  FBI   <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/table_04.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/tab...</a>  <br>  <br>  The Innocence Project, www.innocenceproject.org<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcosttestimony.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcostte...</a> page 3 and 4 on why the death penalty is so expensive<br>  <br>  And, for statements of victims’ families:<br>  <a href="http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statements.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statement...</a><br>  www.mvfhr.org and www.mvfr.org|`|dbKj55akaa	I am for it, they deserve to die.

I believe in the bible it says:<br>  God said, "Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth.…To you it will be for meat." … And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. (Genesis 1:29-31) The Bible predicts some herb's prohibition. "Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times, some shall … speak lies in hypocrisy … commanding to abstain from meats which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.

The legalization of cannabis would free up tax dollars spent on imprisoning non-violent offenders whose only crime was simple possession. <br>  <br>  Furthermore cannabis has industrial uses as well; an acre of hemp produces nearly as much paper as an acre of trees, the difference is it can be regrown yearly. Cannabis is an excellent source of cellulose, which is used in many applications including the production of plastics. It can be grown throughout nearly the entire US, it is an extremely hardy plant that requires little pesticides. <br>  <br>  Not to mention the possibility of taxing it like what is done with alcohol or cigarettes. This all relies on individual responsibility of course. Just because it is illegal does not mean it is difficult to acquire. Anyone who believes that it is more physically, or socially destructive than the drugs currently being manufactured and sold wholesale on a daily basis is a moron.
NnUAXyCGaa	Obama, just like all communists, wants to kill the goat.<br>  <br>  "kill my neighbor's goat"<br>  An old Russian fable involves two peasants who live on neighboring plots of land. One peasant owns a goat; his neighbor does not. One day an angel of mercy comes down from heaven and speaks to the peasant who has no goat. The angel offers him one wish, anything he wants. The peasant makes up his mind immediately. “Please kill my neighbor’s goat”’ he says. Such jealousy has broad political implications. Millions of “poor” would only by too happy to see a new regime sweep away the success that has let a few of their neighbors amass wealth. Rather then obtain equal wealth, they want equal misery by saying “Please kill my neighbor’s goat.”<br>  <br>  The Marxists appealed successfully in much of the world. "Why shouldst thou sit, and I stand?" Social justice will be attained, the poor are told, when they have unseated the affluent and supplanted them in their possessions. Such doctrines have devastated most of Asia and Africa ever since the Second World War.|`|qRlPRJ1Jaa	No i dont believe it. It is wishful thinking.

AA10300394	He's not going to go to jail.  Burglary is among the highest crimes to recidivate (Bad grammar, I know), and many burglars commit hundreds of burglaries before they are caught.  Even then, depending on the time of day and who was in the house (if there was anyone) he might get time if he gets caught, but incredibly doubtful.  $500 is a small-time burglar.  He's probably going to be placed on probation (level 3) and he'll be back out burgling homes in your neighborhood in no time.  Sorry boss, the truth hurts. =(<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: What the guy said about setting a court date and what-not is giving you false hope.  It's the way the justice system is supposed to work, not the way it DOES work.  It's a shame, really.  If they even catch the guy, they will TRY to plea him out, as again, non-felony (under $1000) burglaries are common offenses.  Again, it depends on what jurisdiction you live in, but he's going to catch a sweet plea bargain regarding probation and restitution.|`|9q2RmVHRaa	It depends if the person had any priors and what the crowded conditions of the jails in your area.  The person may only get community service.|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	If they actually catch him they will set a court date and they will have a bail hearing. He will be bonded out on his own reconnaissance and the prosecutor will compile a case against the robber. If they can prove he was armed, he will go to jail. If not and it is his first offense, he may get up to 5 years probation and perhaps 90 days - 6 months jail time. And he will have to pay restitution for any damages done against you. <br>  <br>  If the prosecutor can link him to multiple burglaries, then if the thief will probably plead out and the case will never make it to trial. However, if that is the case he will serve a sentence based on his plea bargain. If he provides details that implicate others or leads to additional arrests, he will be given a reduced sentence depending on the amount of information he shares.

They see my shotgun in the hands of a gang member and my pistol being used in a drive-by. Never mind that I am almost obsessive about gun safety (gun safe, trigger locks, and my kids all have firearm safety training) and that it is more likely that some creep will steal my car to use in a crime than one of my guns. Never mind that I haven't even gotten a parking ticket in over ten years and that I would not turn a gun on another human being unless forced to in order to protect my family. I'm a pickup truck driving, gun toting, Christian, right wing wacko. Or at least, that's what Sean Penn says.

Get UP.  Excuse me?  Don't you have someplace to BE?"). I can see from the posts here on YA that it doesn't matter what happens to us or how President Obama handles it, there are a good number of Republicans who are so laden with hate, that they will never rally around him or give him credit, but these are the ones who think THEY are the true Americans.

bqJgdcfLaa	The Big 3's problems are competition and demand.  Japanese cars have been cheaper before (even if they haven't been recently) and are cheaper to make (largely because of the lower wages of foreign workers).  Then there is the problem of the US makers having made the wrong kind of car, while the other companies were building brand loyalty with the right kind of car.  And worst of all, there is this current economic situation where no one is in the situation to be buying cars in the first place.

It means "after this therefore because of this." Just because Obama became the Democratic nominee and President as the market fell, does not mean that the former caused the latter. It could be that the latter caused the former. Or, there be a third cause to both. Or, it could be a mere coincidence, and the two are totally unrelated (considering the bubble has been inflating for decades, and the run on money markets began September 12th, that is the most likely option).<br>  <br>  Now, to illustrate, the US Dollar has been gaining over the same time you mention. The forex markets are generally a better gauge of investors' sentiments towards the long-term prospects of a country than the stock market, so I could easily argue the inverse of your position.<br>  <br>  Additionally, if I were to use the same illogical line of argument, I could assert that the relative resiliency of US equities is a result of institutional investors' confidence in the Obama administration. Oh yeah, US stocks are down a lot less than many foreign markets, if you didn't know.

There is an article in there about how BILLIONS have been lost, stolen, or scammed from us in Iraq while Bush was in charge. A lot of it went to bogus companies that we paid to build schools and such. For example: $24.4 million was spent in an electricity venture that was paid in full and never built. $15 billion in Pentagon payments to contractors could not be accounted for. In one 2005 report, $8.8 billion meant to help rebuild the country went missing. To make matters worse, our government, late in 2008, fired several top fraud monitors within the Iraqi government , making it easier for people to help themselves. All of this is happening while Iraq is sitting on $90 billion in oil revenues. But it gets worse...they aren't using their own banks. They are depositing it in other countries. In 2007, The US Treasury paid $435.6 million in interest payments to the Iraqi government for the $10 billion in surplus oil revenues they have stashed at the Federal Reserve Bank in NY.|`|A6rm7ExXaa	to answer tghe who was running america thing everyone knows it was DICK CHENEY <br>  <br>  also bush is a dumbass obama has noyt been in power long enough to blame anything on him so you all need to shut your ignorant mouths|`|GIxvzkA9aa	President Obama is responsible for all American economic faults at this current point in time.

There can be numerous violations per inspection, so in theory the fines can total hundreds of thousands of dollars. However, this is the maximum and rarely does OSHA give the maximum fine. Fines can be from $0 to $70,000 per violation.  A $0 fine is called a "de minimus" violation.  Just a slap on the hand.  OSHA determines fines on a case-by-case basis.  Factors include: History of violations (first time or repeat offender), seriousness of the violation, attitude of compliance (was the company really trying or not) and how quickly has the problem been resolved after the inspection.  <br>  <br>  Employers also have the ability to appeal findings and fines to several different levels.<br>  <br>  Here are two links that offer FREE resources to help you understand in plain language.<br>  <br>  Free Introduction to OSHA DVD & Workbook:<br>  <a href="http://www.osha-safety-training.net/free.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.osha-safety-training.net/free...</a><br>  <br>  Several free publications, including 3 about OSHA inspections:<br>  <a href="http://www.freeoshainfo.com/pubpages/general.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freeoshainfo.com/pubpages/gen...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

AA10138269	Ignorance.|`|YupMCYHlaa	People throw both of those terms around, 'socialist' and 'leftist', these days without much regard for what they actually mean.  For 30 years, Republicans labeled as 'liberal' anything they didn't like or anyone they disagreed with.  After 30 years of that, the word lost its meaning altogether. So in the last election they upped the rhetoric, they started throwing around words like 'communist', 'socialist' and 'marxist'.<br>  <br>  These words are not meant to stimulate conversation, the exchange or consideration of ideas.  They are meant to quash conversation.  If someone says something that deserves some thought, Republicans say "Oh, he's just a leftist' (or socialist, or communist) and that is taken to mean "Don't listen to him, nothing he says could have any value."<br>  <br>  For instance, anyone who calls Obama a 'socialist' either doesn't understand Obama very well, or else doesn't know what 'socialism' is, it's just a bad-sounding title, and they don't like him, so he must be one.<br>  <br>  We've gotten to the place where left and right don't mean what they used to.  The most socialistic president in the history of the western hemisphere is probably Cesar Chavez, but no. 2 has to be GW Bush.  He socialized banks and car companies.  A real capitalist would have let them fail, and let the chips fall where they may.  In terms of dollars spent, Bush is probably the biggest socialist in history outside the USSR.<br>  <br>  Also Republicans have practiced 'military keynesianism' for decades, pushing govt. money through the defense industries to stimulate the economy.  That is certainly socialistic since the big defense corporations, though privately owned, are non-competitive and largely unaccountable, and the money is not really spent for defense.|`|IG8s8UnSaa	Yes, there are people on the right who embrace socialist programs.

The only thing that socialism has ever done is retarded progress and freedom. I suggest before making such a bold statement you might want to read up on the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx, the founder of the socialist ideology, which, in case you again haven't done your homework, is the ideology in which Obama was educated. Continuing on that note, socialism isn't just an economic policy, it is THE POLICY. THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLS EVERYTHING, TAKES EVERYTHING, TELLS YOU ONLY WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO KNOW AND GIVES YOU JUST ENOUGH TO SURVIVE ON. <br>  <br>  Communism only works in a perfect world, a utopian one where everyone is nice and obeys the rules and is happy with their lot in life and loves their country and nothing else. Communism/socialism is in complete and utter contradiction to the human psyche, and because of that it will never work. <br>  <br>  We aren't there yet because we started on the complete opposite side of the spectrum, which is a conservative democracy. But, we are drawing ever closer with every law, tax increase, press conference, and social program that Obama and the SOCIALIST ruling elite throw at us. <br>  <br>  They tax the successful to death to give their money to the ever growing welfare class, demonizing the successful along the way, buying up every vote because we are still a so called "democracy". They take control of businesses and industries with the "good" intention of helping out the American "worker" (straight out of Karl's Manifesto). They control the media so you only know what they tell you so any opposition can be discredited, and, of course, they take away your right to bear arms so any armed resistance can be easily stamped out. <br>  <br>  Does this not sound familiar?

Since he may be making accusations of you doing something in California, you will likely need to defend yourself in court. You may hire an attorney to represent you and you may not need to go to court or will only have to come once.|`|AA11622716	If he can show proper service of the lawsuit, and you do not respond, the court will issue a default judgment in his favor.  He can then convert that to an Illinois judgement for collection (if he wishes).<br>  If you get notice while you are in Il, and it is a small claims action, you can move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.|`|OiAl6w48aa	Well, before he can take you to court, he has to serve you with a copy of the complaint.  If he doesn't know where you are, he's going to have to spend some money to find you.  Its not cheap.  Granted, there are exceptions to the "personal service" rule, but no court will allow him to proceed without detailing what steps he's taken to find you.  <br>  <br>  I doubt its going to be worth the money and effort for him to sue you over some alleged vandalism.|`|z9ey2Uqkaa	He needs to show service of process, meaning you were properly notified of the suit.  If he does that, and you ignore it, he will win a default judgement and be able to pursue collection of damages anywhere in the country.<br>  If I were you, I would call the clerk of the court for the town.  Explain to him that you have heard second hand that your neighbor intends to sue, and you want to make sure that you get notice and the opportunity to defend.  The clerk may be able to give you some options, or he might not, but you should try.  While you have the clerk on the phone, ask if your neighbor sues you, whether you have to defend in person or whether someone can show up to defend for you, and if so, whether that person must be an attorney.  Then call a friend or a local lawyer to go to court for you.  If you are calling a lawyer, he will know a lot more about the local legal system than i do, since I don't live and practice there like he does.

We had to hire and attorney and find him, then we had to serve papers on him in order to get custody. Thank goodness he took our side in the whole mess. But here in Florida, if you know who the father is, then you have to have him served with papers that you are seeking custody of the two children. It doesn't matter if they were married or not, you have to find the father and have him served too.|`|8cN4e8Vmaa	I think it would be safe for the children to get custody I don't know what the situation is. But it should be written by the judge who the children should reside with and when visitation days and hours between a mediator or whatever their called. It's just safe for the children. I remember my son was taken my his father and I got so scared because the judge ordered him to stay with my son at his mothers house. And he took off to his house far and I didn't have a car to go and get him. When I called the police they couldn't do nothing because I didn't have proof of the court order.

There is no law prohibit watching street race unless you are the driver of one of the cars they might arrest you.|`|sA7DuUUBaa	the polcie would come by and pick pocket you for free cash in the name of a ticket (pan handleing for the state)|`|qubLyvcRaa	You might get into trouble.  A lot would depend on the where, what, why, and how of the circumstances.  Disturbing the peace?  Disorderly conduct?  Unlawful assembly?  Chances are that if you're not impeding traffic or creating an unsafe situation, you'd probably just be asked to "move along" (don't give them any crap!).  In the last few  years, many municipalities have made watching an illegal "contest of speed" a violation to try and reduce such activities.  If you spend some time watching street racing, it would be in your best interests to see what the city, county, and/or state laws regarding your viewing such an event would be.  Back in the 60s, we were a bunch of Connecticut kids who would travel the 5 miles to race on a section of IS91 near Springfield, Mass.  The layout was perfect; there was an on ramp,  then a few hundred yards up the highway was a 2nd on ramp.  Two cars would enter the highway at the first on ramp slowing down traffic behind them.  The racers would get on the highway at the 2nd on ramp, line up and go.  At the time, there was a company that made a battery operated "Christmas tree" that attached to the cars antennae, which made the whole process a lot easier and quicker.  The 1/4 mile ended at an overpass where we wquld stand and watch the races.  We actually had an "A" dragster offload, get on the highway, run, pop his chute and get back on a trailer, all in less than 3 minutes.  There were times that the State Police would actually join us on the overpass for a short time and then shut everything down by having an FD pumper spray water all over the quarter.  Note that most of this happened 2-3AM and there was a lot less traffic 40 years ago.|`|AA10300394	Run faster than everyone else.

You just pay a fine.  However, if you have enough to be suspected of being a dealer, the punishment is still severe and includes jail time and a high fine.<br>  <br>  An example is the state I live in, Minnesota (a democratic state).  I got caught with a small amount of marijuana 5 years ago and I just got a fine.  No criminal record for it.|`|vHs2syZKaa	Never.

Just special interest things they add to the big ticket that they know might pass and add things for their people.

People expect to see a certain amount of money deducted from their paychecks for a pension plan, health insurance, or 401(k).  (You will probably never see that Social Security money again.)  But it really hurts to see huge sums of money taken out of a check to pay federal income tax, especially when you know that a lot of that money will be wasted on some of the nonsense shown below.<br>  Additionally, some of your money will be given to people who are too lazy to work.  In 2002, the federal government spent $522 billion on low-income assistance programs.*  That's half a trillion dollars per year.<br>  <br>  How Your Government Wastes Your Money:  <br>  <br>  Investigators randomly sampled 300 Department of Agriculture (USDA) employee credit cards.  They found that, over six months, 15 percent of them charged a total $5.8 million in personal expenses that included Ozzy Osbourne concert tickets, tattoos, lingerie, bartender school tuition, car payments and cash advances.<br>  <br>  A sweet deal for 'official' felons.  James A. Traficant Jr., the former Democratic congressman convicted of racketeering and taking bribes, is wiling away prison time painting colorful pictures but also able to collect a congressional pension of nearly $40,000 a year.  He is one of about 20 former senators and congressmen with felony rap sheets who can receive the taxpayer-financed benefit.<br>  <br>  VA employees rack up $2.6 billion in credit card charges.  Veterans Affairs employees last year racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in government credit-card bills at casino and luxury hotels, movie theaters and high-end retailers such as Sharper Image and Franklin Covey — and government auditors are investigating, citing past spending abuses. … On at least six occasions, employees based at VA headquarters made credit card charges at Las Vegas casino hotels totaling $26,198.<br>  <br>  Yet Another Federal Project Out of Fiscal Control.  The total cost for [The Capitol Visitors Center] originally was to be about $265 million.  It already is up to $554 million and counting.  The new grand opening was supposed to be September 2008 but now the Government Accountability Office is reporting it may be done in November with a final cost of $621 million. … There also is the largely overlooked question of whether the CVC should have been built in the first place.<br>  <br>  GPO profits go to bonuses and trips.  When the government's main printing agency booked $100 million in unexpected profit it went on a spending spree:  large bonuses to top managers, trips to Paris and Las Vegas, and an official photo of the boss that cost $10,000.  The bonuses, some nearly as high as $13,000, and travel are raising questions among congressional investigators and Government Printing Office officials about whether the agency is misusing its newfound wealth and whether it received the proper authority for some of the larger compensation payments from the Office of Budget and Management.<br>  <br>  Cities pay huge salaries despite fiscal crises.  A city nurse earned $350,000.  A fire department battalion chief pulled in more than twice as much as the mayor.  And a municipal park ranger took home $188,000 in overtime on top of his $71,000 salary.  Such generous payouts were criticized for hastening the fiscal downfall of the city of Vallejo, which narrowly averted bankruptcy this month.<br>  <br>  Pentagon Paid $998,798 to Ship Two 19-Cent Washers.  A small South Carolina parts supplier collected about $20.5 million over six years from the Pentagon for fraudulent shipping costs, including $998,798 for sending two 19-cent washers to an Army base in Texas, U.S. officials said.  The company also billed and was paid $455,009 to ship three machine screws costing $1.31 each to Marines in Habbaniyah, Iraq, and $293,451 to ship an 89-cent split washer to Patrick Air Force Base in Cape Canaveral, Florida, Pentagon records show.<br>  <br>  Examples of Government Waste:  The federal government cannot account for $24.5 billion spent in 2003.

Los palestinos, muchos de los cuales abandonaron sus tierras cuando la fundación del estado sionista (para vivir refugiados y como ciudadanos de segunda clase en otros países árabes) consideran que la conmemoración es la de una catástrofe.<br>  <br>  Desde estas dos perspectivas tan opuestas y tan hostiles diríase que los planes de paz y reconciliación auspiciados por Estados Unidos --una de cuyas tantas ceremonias protocolares tendrá lugar en estos mismos días-- constituyen un reiterado ejercicio de futilidad en el que ya muy pocos creen y menos aún le prestan atención. El conflicto entre palestinos y judíos tiende a perpetuarse frente a la indiferencia de los occidentales.<br>  <br>  Para los musulmanes, sin embargo, la presencia sionista en Palestina constituye una irritante laceración --a su orgullo, a sus principios, a su fe--; y para los judíos este encono que se manifiesta en la actualidad con intermitentes acciones terroristas es fuente de intranquilidad y de peligro que no pueden darse el lujo de desconocer.<br>  <br>  Los mahometanos, que ya una vez reconquistaron Jerusalén luego de haber estado casi un siglo en poder de los cruzados, aspiran a que la historia se repita y que el surgimiento de una gran potencia islámica en la región, capaz de enfrentar y derrotar a Israel en el campo de batalla, terminará por darles la supremacía. De ahí que muchos de ellos apuesten actualmente a la carta de Irán, aunque, al mismo tiempo, se sientan recelosos de la preponderancia del chiísmo. No es un secreto que el fundamentalismo iraní tiene un proyecto hegemónico regional y que utiliza de peones a varios grupos terroristas, en Irak, Líbano y Palestina. Los árabes sunitas se encuentran ante la alternativa de plegarse a los dictados de los persas o resignarse a convivir con Israel. Parecería que, de los dos, lo último les resulta el trago más amargo.<br>  <br>  Israel, por su parte, sabe que se encuentra en un riesgoso umbral en el que su existencia está en peligro; umbral que podría medirse por el tiempo en que Irán llegue a adquirir o fabricar armas nucleares. Teniendo en cuenta lo peque?o que es territorialmente el Estado judío, cuando los iraníes hablan de barrerlo del mapa no están haciendo una metáfora. Puesto que las intenciones belicosas iraníes son bastante obvias, no es temerario pronosticar que Israel --hasta ahora la única potencia nuclear del Oriente Medio-- debe haber contemplado, si es que no decidido ya, el atacar a Irán antes de que ese país pueda convertirse en una amenaza real. Es de prever que una decisión de esta naturaleza difícilmente se llevaría a cabo bajo el liderazgo del actual primer ministro israelí (tenido por muchos como un hombre timorato) y que encontraría muy escaso respaldo en Barack Obama, si éste resultara electo a la presidencia de este país. Luego, un ataque israelí a Irán --que necesariamente involucraría a Estados Unidos-- no se produciría antes de las elecciones en Israel (que casi seguramente llevarán al poder al radical conservador Benjamin Netanyahu. Si Obama fuese electo (algo que no creo y que espero Dios no permita), Israel estaría muy tentado a atacar a Irán antes del cambio de gobierno en Washington el próximo 20 de enero.<br>  <br>  Sin demérito para las aspiraciones de los palestinos, creo que no debemos dudar de parte de quién debe estar nuestra simpatía y solidaridad en este conflicto que se avecina. Si sólo fuera porque Israel representa la avanzada de nuestra civilización en medio de una región bárbara y uno de nuestros aliados más leales, su supervivencia, próspera y segura, debe contarse entre nuestras incuestionables prioridades. Además, gracias al peso de nuestro legado histórico, en Occidente todos somos judíos.|`|jtbPeoqDaa	incorrecta porque causo muchas victimas inocentes podria<br>  n haberlo creado en otro territorio en el hemisferio austral<br>  bien alejado de esos conflictos|`|9972a3e99fa6adb6e254df788e4ae679aa	desacuerdo con la primer respuesta, aunque beneficie a los judíos, no era su tierra, era de los palestinos, eso se llama ROBO<br>  <br>  y su creación fue un ERROR, UN ROBO Y UNA OFENSA|`|BWPg5acaaa	La decision fue correcta pero infortunada, correcta porque los Judios son historicamente los que poblaron esa tierra.<br>  Desafortunada, porque se realizo de una manera ineficaz.<br>  Los dos pueblos tienen, tenian y tendrán derecho a gozar de su pais, de un territorio y de un gobierno soberano.<br>  Los Ingleses, que durante la segunda guerra fueron los que ocuparon esos territorios, sin negociacion válida con nadie mas que con sus aliados decidieron otorgar esos lugares a los judios. <br>  El holocausto, hizo que el mundo entero se sintiera obligado a reparar, que irreparable era, su proceso y acepto sin chistar la decision Inglesa.<br>  Nadie penso en ese momento que de crear otro estado, Palestino en ese mismo momento, podrian evitarse los problemas posteriores. Nadie los tomo en cuenta.<br>  Con el tiempo ese puchero no aguanto la presión y estallo.<br>  Los ingleses abandonaron la zona y se armo lo que hoy vemos.<br>  Crear un Estado Israeli, es un acierto, en la medida que se permita la creacion de un Palestino.<br>  El problema es que hoy, el proceso se ha enconado en forma tal que no hay forma de resolverlo.|`|QbA3dKoQaa	Hola, tu pregunta es polémica porque es algo así como que ?la decisión de crear al mundo fue correcta o incorrecta?... pienso que todos merecemos vivir. Lamentablemente ese lugar esta lleno de sangre y una guerra que no termina, lo que me da sentimiento es que son los más inocentes quienes pagan tanto odio: Los ni?os. Israel no es la diferencia en el mundo en que vivimos, es solo uno de tantos resultados del odio que ha contaminado las almas de muchos hombres. Que lastima de veras.. porque el ser humano tiene tanta capacidad de crear cosas tan hermosas y desperdicia su energía en auto destruirse.. ni los animales hacen eso..

No me canso de aclarar ciertos errores q leo cuando se toca el tema de Israel y los palestinos. Palestinos eran considerados los fenicios, los moabitas, los arameos, los filisteos, los cananeos. Estos pueblos eran habitantes de la region q llamamos Palestina. El pueblo judio, cuando salio de Egipto, se afinco en esa zona y libro una serie de guerras contra algunos de estos pueblos, fuera para expandir su territorio (moabitas y cananeos) o para defender su independencia (filisteos). Jerusalen fue levantada x manos judias y no x palestinos. Fue un judio quien dio su vida para q se le perdonaran los pecados a la Humanidad pero viendo como estamos ese sacrificio fue en vano.<br>  <br>  Ahora, durante los primeros siglos de la Edad Media, el territorio de Palestina estaba ocupado x el imperio Bizantino. Entonces se produjeron las invasiones musulmanas quienes conquistaron la zona de Judea y Palestina y la mantuvieron hasta q los britanicos decidieron darle a los judios su independencia, como siempre debio ser.<br>  <br>  Los palestinos de ahora, son un pueblo q provenian de Jordania. Como estos vivian buscando la separacion de ese pais, el gobierno jordano los agarro a todos y los expulso. Los britanicos, q por ese entonces dominaban la zona, los acogieron y decidieron q vivieran en Jerusalen y algunos territorios q historicamente le pertenecian al pueblo judio, xq estos hacian siglos q convivian con los musulmanes. X lo tanto, Israel historicamente es due?a de esa tierra. Solo la franja de Gaza nunca fue parte de ellos sino de Egipto.<br>  <br>  No estoy en desacuerdo de q el pueblo palestino tenga un pais, pero si estoy en contra de q lo hagan con fundamentos mentirosos y con odio religuioso. El pueblo de Israel tiene todo el derecho a tener su territorio, xq de los pueblos q en la antiguedad poblaron esa zona es el unico q sobrevivio a invasiones, ocupaciones y genocidios.|`|xoqMspT1aa	Incorrecta.<br>  Los edomitas invadieron a Palestina para crear un estado satanico.<br>  Los verdaderos judios no apoyan el movimiento zionista por ser de naturaleza satanica.<br>  <br>  Mis 2 centavos.|`|HqrU4FfQaa	Un error, porque desplazo a centenares de miles de habitantes de esa region en beneficio de un grupo que no habitaba en la misma|`|fHGgKWHDaa	Fue correcta.

Asimismo existen varias agrupaciones no gubernamentales de ayuda a las víctimas de violaciones. En la Capital Federal, la Policia Federal Argentina, cuenta con un Centro de Orientacion a la Victima de la Violencia Sexual , solo llamando desde cualquier telefono al número 137, (llamada sin costo o gratuita), donde la víctima recibe la contención y ayuda necesaria por parte de un grupo de profesionales medicos, psicologos, etc. No se de donde eres tú, pero creo que en todas las fuerzas policiales hay personal femenino que puede ayudarte.

PRUEBA 2. Tomando en consideración la densidad poblacional para hacer un promedio justo, ?en que ciudad hay en promedio más gente endeudada pagando coche nuevo para presumir? Aunque no necesiten un coche nuevo y no tengan a veces ni para comer. PRUEBA 3. Sólo observen por que personajes hemos votado para que nos gobiernen. PRUEBA 4 ?En que ciudad el vehiculo de atrás presiona al conductor del otro vehiculo para que se pase la luz roja del semáforo sin importarle que haya peatones atravesando la calle? PRUEBA 5. ?De qué ciudad es típico encontrarse nacos levantandose la playera, muchos de ellos choferes de transporte público sin el menor respeto a sus pasajeros? <br>  PRUEBA 6. ?En que ciudad en promedio ves más gente arrojando basura desde el coche?<br>  En promedio, ninguna ciudad tiene tanto naco como el D.F. En parte quizá se deba a que la facilidad de obtener ciertas cosas hace que el individuo se vuelva arrogante y sienta que lo merece todo y lo sabe todo. Aquí hasta el gobierno está compuesto de barbajanes, irrespetuosos y fantoches que son todologos.<br>  Amigos de provincia, ojalá algún día cambien el concepto que tienen de nosotros. Estoy a las ordenes de ustedes y nuevamente les ofrezco una disculpa y que Dios los bendiga.           candenac@yahoo.com.mx|`|de928cbb4115a28040246befca84fbe8aa	Mira, en el fondo de todo este asunto lo que prevalece es la inconformidad de los que menos tienen (no estoy hablando de dinero).<br>  El Defe?o, por no decir chilango, ha tenido todo el tiempo por vivir en la capital, las mayores oportunidades de empleos, por la oferta y la demanda los mejores sintomas de aprendizaje informal es decir de la calle, necesidades de supervivencia, actuaciones a la defensiva, pleitos y asaltos y aunque super poblada, por esa misma necesidad tambien una competencia de supervivencia del mas fuerte hacia el debil.<br>  A eso agregale que cuando van o vienen a la provincia, se sienten super dotados y consideran a los "provincianos" como nos consideran los gringos a todo el país y a los mexicanos, ciudadanos subdesarrollados e inferiores a ellos y por lo tanto confunden la hospitalidad y costumbres de provincia como sinónimo de servidumbre y de ignorancia.<br>  No se trata de matar chilangos, no,  son ciudadanos mexicanos como nosotros que si lo meditas un poco nos deben causar otro sentimiento dadas las condiciones de vida que la mayoría tiene.<br>  Vida de amontonamiento, vida de desconfianza, vida de inquietudes e incertidumbres, de pobreza, de desesperación, distancias enormes en la que el tiempo parece volar y al llegar tarde al trabajo ocasiona pérdida de dinero, intransegencias y falta de criterio de parte de los que pueden. Impotencia. Castración.<br>  Se pierde el humanismo, se pierde la sensibilidad y te vuelves indolente hacia el dolor ajeno. Impera la ley del mas fuerte.<br>  Los mejores equipos de futbol (negocio donde se lucra con el fanatismo de las multitudes) los mejores lugares para divertirte, para pasear, para distraerte, en fin, por ser la capital de la república las mejores oportunidades para todo.<br>  Lo que no se quiere ver, es que a pesar de todo ésto no todos pueden disfrutar sin problemas de ellos, es decir debes tener un automóvil para moverte, dinero para disfrutarlo y comodidades para entender lo que es vivir bien. O conformarte con lo que tienes mas cercano a tu domicilio.<br>  En lugar de tenerles lo que crees que se consideran como  sentimientos de rechazo, piensen un poco y mejor cambiale el nombre,  como que nos causan  pena el conocer  como viven, sin poder disfrutar del tiempo en su tiempo, del sol y del aire no contaminado de algunas provincias y en cuanto a las oportunidades de trabajo pues ya vendrán tiempo mejores, pero poniendo todo en una balanza, yo creo que se inclinaría hacia la provincia y no hacia un lugar donde ya no caben, y por ende consecuencias desesperantes, como transporte, basura, smog, delincuencia, enfermedades infecciosas en el aire y además, distancias enormes, y viviendas aglomeradas.<br>  También debemos decirlo por que nó, cuentan  con las mejores universidades, mejores centros deportivos y de recreo, infinidad de escuelas por las propias necesidades internas y la agudeza del lenguaje desconfiado y de doble sentido desarrollado  por el mismo afan de sobrevivir.<br>  Por algo a de ser, que la mayoría de ustedes cuando nos visitan, extra?an y comparan la provincia en cuanto regresan a su jungla de concreto y valoran sus verdaderas necesidades.|`|lFOGVUZUaa	Los chilangos son como una plaga, salen de su ciudad y creen q pueden hacer de mexico todo suyo, son prepotentes y muy pedantes; incluso cuando los chilangos se mudan a otras ciudades "mas seguras y limpias" las dejan mas sucias y comienzan los asaltos, los robos y los secuestros.<br>  <br>  Tambien ensucian nuestros destinos turisticos y el mas importante de todos Acapulco, q está infestado de chilangos cada fin de semana.<br>  <br>  Ademas realmente son los parasitos de Mexico, porque tienen todo subsidiado, los impuestos de todos los mexicanos solo sirven para mantener a los chilangos; y esa politica centralista se me hace muy injusta.<br>  <br>  Aparte conducen super mal, creen que los dos carriles de las carreteras son para ir a 60 km/hr, se te atraviesan a lo bruto, se pasan los altos todo super mal.<br>  <br>  Deberian mejorar su actitud.|`|YX5SZAOkaa	si es verdad   soy de provincia y aqui hablan muy mal de los chilangos, dicen haz patria mata un chilango.|`|da68de4f3964b75191c3b3bc24e4c8d6aa	son tan fantoches,tan presumidos,como higados.......creen que tienen la razon y conocimiento de todo y que viven en el centro del universo|`|3901e70639fcf33624dcdb92f77a782caa	Por absoluta ignorancia.<br>  Los "provincianos" no saben, desconocen, ignoran que el 95% de las personas que habitamos esta ciudad somos hijos de padres y madres que vinieron de  provincia en busqueda de un mejor nivel de vida.<br>  Y de alguna forma lo consiguieron.<br>  Durante siglos la ciudad de México ha sido el Polo de Atracción no solo de inmigrantes de origen Nacional sino del Extranjero.<br>  Es conveniente no olvidar que despues del "holocausto" Mexicano la población nativa fue reducida a no mas del 10% y se tuvo que "importar" personas de otros pueblos del interior de la Nación para mantener el ritmo de desarrollo que esta importante capital ha tenido historicamente.<br>  Y el problema del rechazo a los capitalinos no es un fenomeno exclusivo de México, se da el mismo en casi todas las poblaciones que compiten con sus propias capitales.<br>  Sin embargo la Ciudad de México ha sido "victimizada" por campa?as de desprestigio ya que desde el terremoto del 85, fue tal el impacto en la mente de los capitalinos de la entonces "ineficiencia deshumanizante" de los gobiernos en turno (PRI) que subitamente entramos en un estado de Conciencia que nos coloco como la ciudad mas politizada y dinamica socialmente del País.<br>  !desperto el gigante Azteca!.<br>  Y eso no les gusta para nada a quienes de esta ciudad hicieron toda suerte de corruptelas dejando de ser terreno propicio para mantener cotos de poder.<br>  Paradojicamente los chilangos somos discriminados en todo México... pero los chilangos somos hospitalarios con todos los Mexicanos cuando vienen a esta hermosa capital.<br>  Asi son las cosas.<br>  Bienvenidos.|`|7624df5388ec698a49b7f13a8cf30bb5aa	haz patria mata un chilango|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Soy chilanga y vivo en provincia. Creo que en parte el odio hacia los chilangos viene de que todos los servicios, la cultura, los poderes políticos y sociales están concentrados en el Distrito Federal (Chilangolandia). El centralismo además provoca que muchos chilangos crean que el Distrito Federal es el ombligo de México. La intolerancia es deleznable. En ningún caso se justifica. No debemos olvidar que la población originaria de la Ciudad de México, en comparación con los millones que la habitan es minoritaria. El Distrito Federal está poblado por miles de millones de migrantes de toda la República Mexicana, Latinoamérica y el resto del mundo. Es una de las ciudades mas cosmopolitas que existe. Odiar a los chilangos es odiar al resto de la humanidad. Lo digo porque he estado en reuniones de norte?os que viven en la Ciudad de México hace ya muchos a?os y siguen despotricando contra los chilangos, siendo que ahora ellos son mas chilangos que yo. Porque yo vivo en provincia. Irónico no? El odio a los chilangos es racismo puro.

Es en verdad una injusticia, ahorita por dos autos tendré que pagar $6,000 pesos, han dicho que lo están estudiando haber si lo quitan, pero también han dicho que es la mayor fuente de ingresos del gobierno, así que no lo quitarán, yo creo que al menos deberían de disminuir el monto, ya que en verdad es altísimo...<br>  Saludos!|`|0e70e1373bf1c9b8a256fc59b648355faa	es que depende del auto que tengas, obvio si tienes un modelo reciente, o un auto del a?o 2007, tendrás que pagar más, pues tienes dinero para comprar autos del a?o, entonces no hay problema en pagar 2000, al a?o.|`|RGW16lc1aa	Pues es cierto que no debemos pagar ese impuesto, hasta lo han de ver como un pago tonto en otros paises|`|uFpzJv62aa	Pues déjenme decirles que en México es el único país donde se paga por tener un coche, en ningún otro lado hay y raíz que vieron que fue una fuente importante de ingresos y además de corruptelas es por eso que lo han hecho|`|SDHvDNGJaa	A mi se me hace un impuesto no justificado, sin lógica.

Esto es por un lado.<br>  <br>  Por otro, los gastos que causa la inmigración ilegal son inmensos: salidas de divisas, gastos de inversión en el departamento de migración, servicios educacionales y médicos que toman también habitantes ilegales, "mercado *****" (ingresos por alquiler, compra de automoviles y demás que no son declaradados), etc. Son otras causas.<br>  <br>  Por supuesto que la inmigración ilegal aporta también beneficios a la economía, pero como muchos gringos solicitan, una inmigración temporal legal serúia mucho mejor para ambas partes.

Es más probable que por andar medio grifo a uno se le olvide cómo llegar a algún lugar que el hecho de que vaya a chocar.<br>  <br>  4- ?Nos hemos puesto a pensar cuánta gente sobria mata al volante? De hecho, hay quienes matan al volante por estar "ebrios de estrés".<br>  <br>  5- ?Por supuesto que el alcohol es más peligroso que la mota! Dicen que los "mariguanos" se ponen violentos: ?Qué ignorancia! La gente violenta es violenta, le meta a lo que le meta.<br>  <br>  6- La sagrada Biblia habla constantemente del uso de la mariguana (cá?amo aromado) en fiestas y ceremonias... ?será que por usar la mota son ritos satánicos?<br>  <br>  7- Desde que comencé a fumar mota, mis calificaciones pasaron de mediocres ochos a brillantes nueves y dieces... ?en serio! creo que me ayudó a absorber conocimiento de un modo más fluido.<br>  <br>  8- Entonces, por favor, no consideremos a la mariguana una droga peligrosa... es algo tan inocente como una taza de café, un cigarrillo.<br>  <br>  9- Obviamente, lo mejor sería no drogarse, pero uno tiene que llegar a esa conclusión POR SUS PROPIOS MEDIOS, y ningún hijo de vecino empistolado tiene por qué meterse en los asuntos de nadie.<br>  <br>  10- Lo malo es que la mota la venden en la misma tiendita que la coca, las pastillas para dormir, éxtasis y ácido que, aunque uno está muy en su derecho de consumirlos, sí son un peligro para la salud. Si despenalizan la mariguana, mucha gente que acaba envuelta en drogas peligrosas, no tendría ni por qué enterarse que existen. De hecho, he tenido que conocer el submundo urbano para conseguir mi inofensiva mariguana. Triste pero cierto.<br>  <br>  11- Si quieres saber cuál es el golpe letal que se le puede dar a los cárteles de droga: LEGALIZAR LA MARIGUANA.<br>  <br>  12- En un mundo dominado por la fuerza y las armas, deberíamos mejor preguntarnos por qué son legales los diamantes, el coral, los abrigos de pieles, la caza de foca en Canadá, la tala sin control.... por qué, sin deberla ni temerla, nos metieron el IETU (un horrible y estúpido impuesto de 16.5% más sobre los ingresos... cosa lamentable para el peque?o empresario).<br>  <br>  13- Con un sacacorchos puedes hacer más da?o que con un porro... si no, mira lo que hizo el loco asesino de Tokio.<br>  <br>  13bis- Pero, como es muy probable que nada cambie y que sigamos con miedo a despertar la conciencia en nosotros mismos... no importa, déjenlo así...

Estados Unidos no lo permitiría, la iglesia católica a?oraría los donativos cuantiosos de los narcotraficantes y muchos políticos corruptos buscarían otras formas de ingresos ilícitos. No todos podemos ser líderes obreros para disponer de mucho dinero en forma discrecional y sin transparencia.|`|TuXgNRAYaa	Mi opinión es que debería de despenalizar el uso de cualquier droga y alcohol ya que el humano es libre de hacer con su vida lo que le plazca, además se ha demostrado que seria periódicamente una forma de disminuir la tensión social y la violencia que tanto aqueja al país. y  demás la desaparición del contrabando y narcótico, al disminuir sus precios elevados.  ya que el humano desde sus inicios ha hecho su de las drogas como parte de la vida. y una  ley no ara mas que aumentar el morbo y la sensura a algo tan normal. Mejor el gobierno habrá que mejorar la condición del ser humano para que lograse la autosuperacion, pormedio de la cultura, deporte, familia, empleo  y  así no caer en la felicidad falsa de las drogas.|`|V6zEqxpZaa	No se puede permitir eso, si  vemos como esta la sociedad hoy en dia en donde los robos son el pan de cada dia, donde los jovenes adictos a una droga proceden primero a conseguir un arma y empezar a delinquir solo con el pretexto de consumir sus drogas para olvidar sus penas, y eso que no estan a la mano ó a la venta en cada esquina, que va a ser de nuestros hijos que pueden caer en esto, si sabemos que es un vicio dificil de salir, y que va a ser de nosotros si vamos a estarnos cuidando mas como sociedad, yo creo que si se hace esta propuesta se bajarian mucho los precios de estas drogas y estarian mas a la mano, pero los narcotraficos no se acabarian, solo cambiarian de nombre y despues solo serian reconocidos como personas empresarias. Pero los da?os que ocacionan quien los va a pagar, solo la sociedad.|`|VtPDfrMiaa	para grandes problemas grandes soluciones el fenomeno de las drogas es algo creado por nosotros al prohibir  la producción, comercializacion y consumo, si se despenaliza se acaba el gran problema como sucedio con la prohibicion de alcohol en los EUA en los 20"s nuestra vision puritana no nos permite ver que quienes estan interesados en combatirla son precisamente quienes se benefician del gran mercado de la droga.|`|a916f0cb416e5946465efb324f70ce23aa	Yo estoy seguro que si las drogas "TODAS" fueran legales, en ese momento se acaba el narcotráfico ya que, el ser narcotraficante actualmente significa mucho dinero y poder.<br>  Si las drogas fueran legales y a los narcodependientes se las recetara un médico y pagaran impuestos al comprarlas, ya no sería un negocio tan atractrivo pues ya no ganaría el narcotraficante tantísimo dinero.<br>  Actualmente el vendedor de drogas tiene el poder de sobornar a todo el que se le opone y si no lo hace simplemente lo mata, y  queda impune,  pues ya tiene comprados a los jueces.<br>  Además al no ser un gran negocio los vendedores de drogas ya no tendrían el aliciente de invertir unos pesos para enviciar a los jóvenes y ni?os, ya que no verían redituada su inversión como lo hacen actualmente.<br>  Los narcodependientes que ya existen se irían extinguiendo solos por consecuencia del abuso en las drogas.<br>  Dejaríamos de tener tanta corrupción en las policias y en todo el sistema judicial a nivel mundial. No me digan que el FBI o Scotland Yard o la DEA son ejemplo de policias honradas.<br>  Logicamente no sería cosa de solo decir ya las drogas son legales, deberá haber un mecanismo para hacerlo y solo se necesita descubrir y exhibir a los políticos que están coludidos con los narcotraficantes ya que  son ellos los que no desean que las drogas sean legales, pues se les acabarían las carretadas de dinero y poder que actualmente reciben.|`|def42c7ce0ffde5fb4bd15538615c23faa	Seré honesto al comentar que no entiendo estas preguntas, vamos quisiera saber el beneficio de obtenr opiniones, si esto tendrá algún impacto en nuestros gobernantes y hagan algo al respecto, por otro lado existe mucha ignorancia en las oipiniones, no digo de todos, pero algunas son tan absurdas e inmaduras. Probablemente la despenalización lograría:<br>  1. Control sobre la venta y el consumo de drogas.<br>  2. Se acabaría el narcotráfico. <br>  3. Evitaría probablemente menos adeptos a la drogadicción, ed; ya no cabría el concepto de lo  más prohibido es lo más querido.<br>  4. En el caso de la Mariguana se daría un uso terapéutico en el tratamiento de enfermedades terminales, además  de darle uso en la industrtia  vestido y confección, la ropa es hermosa y más térmica que el algodón.<br>  5. No se gastaría  en contrarrestar el narcotráfico, lo que sería un ahorro para la nación y establecer programas de educación  en materia de drogadicción.|`|j1N0VSrraa	Estoy a favor de la despenalizacion, hay muchos puntos a discutir en esta postura, por falta de espacio sere breve; primero reconocer que esto no terminaria con los consumidores pero si los reduciria enormemente, ya que uno de los atractivos de las drogas es su caracter prohibido, eso es es lo que seduce a muchos de los adictos; segundo definitivamente la violencia que genera el trafico ilegal de drogas se terminara, no habria razon para ello, ya que el ser de uso permitido los precios se desplomarian y todas las mafias perderian el interes en este jugoso negocio de envenenar a la gente, el gobierno se ahorraria millones de dolares en recursos de todo tipo, armas, vehiculos, tecnologia, y lo mas importante en vidas humanas, policias, agentes, militares, lo interesante seria poder contar con el consenso de todos los paises involucrados tanto productores, de transito y consumidores, es decir desde Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru pasando por toda Centroamerica, Mexico hasta los Estados Unidos y Canada.<br>  Simplemente Imposible!! pero valdria la pena, si se logró el NAFTA porque no un acuerdo antidrogas, por el bien de nuestros ni?os y jovenes, por el futuro del mundo.|`|lfXAMdiwaa	Si despenalizaran las drogas se acabarian los narcotraficantes?<br>  Se acabarian los pedofilos?<br>  se acabaria la prostitucion?<br>  se acabarian los drogadictos?<br>  se acabaria la pobreza?<br>  se acabarian los asesinatos?<br>  se acabarian los problemaseconomicos de la sociedad?<br>  se acabarian las crisis ambrunas en el mundo?<br>  se acabarian los politicos corruptos?<br>  se acabarian los divorcios?<br>  y se acabarian tantas otras injusticias?<br>  CLARO QUE NO!<br>  POR QUE SON A VECES TAN TONTOS QUE CREEN QUE CON HACER UNA LEY SE ACABARIAN LOS PROBLEMAS.<br>  Cuantas leyes en nuestro pais existen y los problemas enumerados anteriormente parece que se desarrollan exponencialmente.<br>  Hasta cuando tomaremos conciencia de que la drogadiccion es un rpoblema que parte desde la base de la familia. si tuvieramos familias sanas, en todos los aspectos.<br>  tuvieramos gobiernos sanos, leyes sanas, hijos sanos, sociedades justas.<br>  Se acabarian todos lo problemas de la humanidad.<br>  Ha pero n,o eso no es negocio.<br>  Diganme ustedes el hech de que haya legalizado el consumo de alcohol, desde ese entonces se acabaron los borrachos?<br>  Claro que no!<br>  a ver desde ese entonces se acabaron los accidentes por el consumo de alcohol?<br>  Claro que no.<br>  Alguno de ustedes a sufrido la perdida de un ser querido por causa del alcohol?<br>  Alguno de ustedes a perdido a un ser querido por causa de las drogas?<br>  Entonces por que le esta pasando por la cabeza el hecho de que se legalize su consumo.<br>  O LOS LEGISLADORES ESTAN TARADOS O LLEVAN UNA BUENA MOCHADA.<br>  ESTO INCLUYE AL GOOBERNADO DE CHIHUAHUA.

Realmente la única solución para evitar que el consumo se acabe, es la educación desde el seno familiar, es ahí donde se debé trabajar con los hijos informandolos de las consecuencias que lleva el consumo de drogas; además de dar cari?o, comprensión, ayuda, orientación y preparación de nosotros los padres para ser capaces de dar está información a nuestra familia. Porque las autoridades podrán lanzar las mejores campa?as, las mejores estrategias para detener a los Narcotráficantes pero sí el consumo no se termina, no le veo otra solución. Gracias y Feliz Día!!

But if we have some dumba** Lyndon Johnson the second in office who decides to invade either Russia or China, we could not really win. It would turn into another Vietnam, chasing an enemy through lands that we were unfamiliar with, dealing with Russia's scorched earth policy and the Russian winter, not to mention the thousands of Chinese refugees. If it just turned into a naval war, the U.S. could probably destroy both countries with 2 aircraft carrier groups. Of course if there were nukes, the only winners would be the cockroaches.

Overwise Occupation alone will never work and would be suicidal for US occupation and landing forces and her Allies.

AA10554035	First (right now), if you haven't already... go to www.annualcreditreport.com and look up your credit history. Print it out (or at least copy and save it onto your computer). Then, put up a flag on your account... There should be instructions on how to do this on the page (at least there was when I did it... you may have to call and report why you are flagging your account.) You need to do this NOW to keep from them opening up accounts in your name (but you need to get your credit history from that site before you do this, because you won't be able to access your account after you flag it). <br>  <br>  From there, well... If you know who did it, then that should help the case. But... otherwise.... I really don't know what else you can do besides reporting it.

Not the other way around.<br>  <br>  We need to get off this "It's your fault and not mine" horse that we're on now, and understand that we are all Americans, we are all to blame.

We were greedy, buying houses and cars we couldn't afford ASSUMING that they would continue to go up in price and we'd sell, making a killing.<br>  <br>  Well, the golden goose is dead and we need to pull together and fix this, not sit there and complain that everyone is at fault but ourselves.|`|SjVvx32paa	Every Republican tax cut has resulted in record levels of revenue--it's known as the Laffer Curve--reduced tax burdens on businesses and individuals incentivizes increased economic activity.  Not all that complicated a principle, but lost on most ignorant sheeple brainwashed in our Marxist public schools to beleive that higher taxes=higher revenue.  The opposite is usually true.<br>  <br>  Budget deficits have always been run up when we've had a Democrat Congress, especially under Republican Presidents who have often failed to restrain the wild spending of Democrats--as is the unfortunate case with Bush Jr.  Did you forget that the President does not write the budget, nor spending bills?<br>  <br>  And if you really want to be cynical about any party's truly nefarious agenda of economic sabotage, google "The Cloward-Piven Strategy."

Yes there are a couple of items that you could call stimulating but most of it is just plain PORK and spending.<br>  <br>  In the end it makes no difference if his package works or not because in the end we will still have to pay for it as our national debt skyrockets.<br>  <br>  Now to be truthful I am not worried about losing my job as I will be retiring next year so if I get laid off tomorrow or I retire it will not make any difference to me.<br>  <br>  You should look at the polls (not that I rely on them) but most people are in the opinion that this bailout will be a failure and are starting to see Obama for what he really is, a socialist, I think that 2010 will show many Democrats losing their seats in Congress. If we could get rid of Pelosi and Reid I would be happy even if they were replaced by other Democrats.<br>  <br>  You seem to have more confidence of this working than even Joe Biden, in his own words he says that there is a 30% chance that it will not work, my guess he is shooting to low at 30% but has give that estimate to protect his own A@@|`|8a47bf1d6854793a25a251563ff9d837aa	If the stimulus works then the GOP will hurt themselves far beyond repair and they won't see public office for a while.<br>  <br>  Right now the GOP is playing russian roulette and they can either get massive success from no republican support or it can lead to their own demise.<br>  <br>  The GOP better pray that this bill is a massive failure or they will be written off as a dead party in the history books.<br>  <br>  The majority of the money is going towards education, the second majority of the spending is going towards healthcare, and the third largest portion is environmental sector.

bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	The Court, in a unanimous opinion written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., held that Schenck's criminal conviction was constitutional. The First Amendment did not protect speech encouraging insubordination, since, "when a nation is at war many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight, and that no Court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right." In other words, the court held, the circumstances of wartime permit greater restrictions on free speech than would be allowable during peacetime.<br>  In the opinion's most famous passage, Justice Holmes sets out the "clear and present danger" test:<br>  "The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent."<br>  This case is also the source of the phrase "shouting fire in a crowded theater," paraphrased from Holmes' assertion that "the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic."<br>  As a result of the 9-0 decision, Charles Schenck spent six months in prison|`|AA10504968	The United States Supreme Court ruled in a 9-0 decision (Written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes) that the First Amendment rights to freedom of speech does not protect speech encouraging insubordination when a nation is at war.<br>  <br>  Look also in Eugene V.

Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes writing in another unanimous decision stated..."Freedom of Speech has it limitation in such that one cannot scream fire in a theater full of people."

yAXrsQiFaa	I would talk to an attorney about your rights and how to protect yourself.|`|fQ2veTIhaa	Well .....the folks above have given good level headed advice ......<br>  follow it and stay in contact with the police ......|`|aNDxKN2zaa	Here is my opinion, renew the restraining order right away. That Email would have been a violation of it. Notify your local police department about the situation and ask them to extra patrol your house if you feel threatened. Document, save and print everything he does. If he emails you save it, calls you and leaves a message, save it. Anything save it somehow. This way when it continues and you  feel threatened you can take all you have to the police and he may be able to be picked up for stalking you. If you have any of his stuff get it to that neighbor and tell him to return it. That way he has no reason to contact you. If you keep it there is his reason to contact you. Do not let him slide on anything.  The police were right he did nothing wrong, yet, but compile it.|`|uIAHkm0Naa	wow, i thought giving out someones SSN was illegal, but i guess not. you can sue him for slander for saying that the neighbor raped you, but thats a little extreme. i would get a taser or gun just to be on the safe side. also you can probably drop his belongings off somewhere and then tell him to pick them up at a later time.|`|epbzW5N8aa	If the restraining order is still good, it has been violated.

Why you would want him to change color with a staining media (dye), I don't know, but it doesn't sound nice.<br>  <br>  Not only that, but in a legal sense, whoever you said the first to could legally do whatever necessary to stop you from carrying out your threat, up to and including killing you, since you were threatening deadly force.  They might carry the burden of proof to show that you did, but it's still within their right to do so in response to your threat / assault.|`|7BVyV4Fdaa	It could be used as a verbal threat, which if said in front of the wrong person can be used against you. It's not necessarily against the law to say something, unless there is a serious threat against someone's life.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	threats are unlawful. the first one is a threat, the second is wishful thinking, and bad thoughts towards a person. so the first one yes the second no.|`|7abc8a12212468a52586c2c62d6edd72aa	The first statement is a threat.<br>  The second statement is not a threat.|`|u5y8kE81aa	"i wish he would dye" isn't a threat so..|`|1WAeB8gfaa	Yes to the first statement<br>  <br>  No to the second|`|1m2ISbjOaa	"I'm going to stab you" could be considered a threat, but wishing something bad on someone isn't against the law.|`|cts6S8vRaa	No,but if you commit a crime you're going to be interrogated.|`|aa5wzF9caa	well the first one is counted as a threat so yes the second one is ok.

People aren't classified, missions are.  If he was some sort of intelligence operative HIGHLY unlikely as an Ensign unless he was aircrew working surveillance, then he would've been killed/lost in a "training accident"; which was the standard way to admit losses during the Cold War.  I point you to RB47, RB45, and RF84 losses over the USSR and N Korea for examples.<br>  <br>  But your question has conspiracy theory written all over it, so any use of Occam's Razor (I defy YOU to look that up), and 24 years of military experience, many of those spent in very close-hold programs won't convince you.
5rL4njnxaa	I have an idea.<br>  <br>  The businesses that say lowering taxes creates jobs.  Fine.  You don't get the tax break unless you can point to a new job created.  If the money goes to excessive executive compensation of a Swiss bank account, they get no tax credit.|`|X01FnN3Faa	Compare taxes in Countries like Mexico and China to most of Africa.   Africa has high taxes (despite high poverty), but has no industry.   Sad to say there is cheap labor, in abundance there, but not many jobs.<br>  <br>  Personal taxes aside, taxing businesses and people for making money and being productive is silly.  We should tax consumption.   Even people making money under the table, selling drugs/contraband, and working here illegally ALL consume.|`|alQ5wIVqaa	Yes. Companies pass taxes to the consumer.

It's not a group to be taken lightly, especially someone who'd wear a sign to try and tell others they happen to be in this whack job group.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	Threatening the president, no matter who that president is, is a punishable offense.  There are other ways to express one's displeasure with a president's policies.  Let him take up his harassment case with the ACLU.  Maybe they'll be sympathetic but I'm not.|`|33ppbrMJaa	Such a crude, violent, silly sign has nothing to do with Free Speech. It is just more of the brutality that Republicans seem to thrive upon.  When I read these posts, I shudder at the society you Republicans seem to want. Whatever gave you the idea that you have the right to  curse and threaten other human beings, just because they believe differently than you?<br>  <br>  You may be Pro Life, but you sure aren't anxious to put out the money needed to support babies born to parents without the education or intelligence to care for their chidren.  The Conservative idea of gangs of hungry children flooding the streets of our country is a good indication of just how Pro Lifers feel.   <br>  <br>  I am not an advocate of abortion, but I sure wouldn't force a rape victim to have a child, nor would I force a 12 year old to have her father's baby. Let your own 12 year old do this, if you'd like, but don't ask my 12 year old to live this way.  <br>  <br>  Barack Obama is our President now.  Conservatives lost the Election because their ideology failed and brought on economic and military crisis. You had your chance and you failed. Cry about it all you want, but don't include our President in your terrible, violent signs.|`|zftm6qkKaa	Only you cons would protest someone getting arrested for shouting fire in a theater. BTW, why do conservatives believe that only rich women should have access to safe abortions?

Just because you shoot your mouth off with an opinion doesn't mean it corresponds to the legal reality. Nor can people say speech was incitement to riot - there was no indication of that here.  He engaged in protected speech, and the government unlawfully infringed upon his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. There was no compelling state interest served in silencing this man. <br>  <br>  I would like to see the ACLU pursue this. <br>  <br>  As if someone planning to harm the President is going to wave a sign around. Give me a break. Sounds like some local Barney Fife just felt like exerting a little power.|`|Ca8i226Xaa	Obviously not from the answers you got. With most liberals they only care about free speech when some far left America-hater is not allowed to speak his hatred for the USA. Otherwise, libs don't care about it.<br>  <br>  I disagree that this was a threat against Obama; it was clearly just showing the man's opposition to abortion. However, he could have thought of a better way of expressing his opposition to Obama's expansion of abortion worldwide.|`|ffJcrsmLaa	That's ridiculous that the cops took the sign away. It's his Constitutional right to display that sign. I would imagine that the ACLU probably will get involved, as they should. And I really don't see how that sign would constitute a "threat" to Obama.|`|sn5334Kqaa	Liberals only get involved when it is a stance they agree on.  The ones that preach tolerance the loudest are quickest to try to quash people that oppose their views.  Most liberals lack the cognitive ability to entertain a thought without accepting it.|`|aFC72tLZaa	The idiot police officer didn't know the meaning of abort.  They finally apoligized to him and asked him if he wanted to file a complaint.  Another example of conservatives spreading lies because the Dems won.  Sorelosers!|`|19L99wvCaa	His sign was in very poor taste, though he has the right to display it.|`|d0836e0785bb7c6faea2b62558249361aa	Liberals are only outraged when you disagree with what they believe.|`|X9VDzvo4aa	There's a difference between voicing your dissent and threatening the life of the President.  You don't get to do the second thing.  I didn't like it when people said "kill Bush" and i'm not going to change my mind now that Obama is president.  You can use any words you want to say "the President is wrong and I don't like him" but the game changes when you start suggesting violence.  Can you not see that gaping chasm of a difference?

That's why I'm VERY pro birth control and sex education.

I think kids these days need to be taught more about contraceptives rather than abstinence, since that doesn't help anyone at all. And multiple forms of contraceptives, not just a condom. Birth Control pills or shots as well. <br>   Also, even if abortions are made illegal, it will only mean that more girls will try and abort the fetus themselves, possibly injuring themselves. <br>   I don't like the idea of an abortion being used as birth control. If a girl is a **** and keeps getting pregnant, and keeps getting abortions, that's not right. However, things happen - rape, heat of the moment, broken condom, being the 1% that other forms of contraceptive doesn't work for.... for them, abortion should be considered an option. <br>   In short - if you don't like abortions, then don't get one, but don't try and shove your beliefs about it down other's throats.

I think we're all for reducing the need for abortions, with the use of contraceptive and eduction, etc.  But contraceptives fail, rape and incest happen, and pregnancy should not be compulsory ever.

BzsI4SaCaa	Yeah you definitely don't have to confront people in court in order to get a restraining order. The only time you will have to confront them is if they contest/fight the RO. It's all about paperwork. First you would have to fill out a request form for a RO at the County Clerk's office in the County Building. In the form you can keep your information confidential and give the information of the person/people that you are filing the RO against. This information has to be correct in order for the RO to be served. You can pay someone to serve the RO, or have someone you know do it. It has to be signed by the person serving it and the person receiving it. In the RO you have to put down different instances where the person has harassed, or caused any kind of harm to you. Once this form is completed you will go in and have a sit down meeting with a judge (in his office, not court) and he will approve or deny your request and can sign the form. You are given enough copies for you, the defendant, and one copy must be returned stating that the defendant has been served with the RO. If you don't feel comfortable having someone you know serve the RO go to the place where the defendant is and call the police to serve it for you. When the police serves the RO it is on file and doesnt need to be brought back to the County Building. Hope this helps....sorry it's long....

Actually it's about 10%, with navs/AWDs etc making up another 10% of the AF officer corps. But it's a very valid question. There's three major hurdles you've got to jump:<br>  1- Bachelor's degree<br>  2- Complete an officer training program (Academy, ROTC, OTS)<br>  3- Be accepted into and complete pilot training "SUPT" in AF-speak.<br>  To get to #3, you gotta have 1 & 2 complete.  In other words, if you can't get accepted into an officer training program-you're done.  The easiest one to do is ROTC; first two years are like any other college class-you only incur a commitment the last two.  ROTC has scholarships available as well.  The hardest is, as you probably know the Academy-however the Academy has the most flying training slots assigned to it each year.  So many in fact, they didn't fill their quota a couple years ago.  They only accept <400 out of over 5000 applicants each year: you need to be on your game (high GPA, sports, student gov't, JROTC, etc) to even have a chance.  Officer Training School (OTS) is designed for enlisted troops who wish a commission, but they DO have slots available for non-prior applicants.  OTS has the fewest flying training slots.  OTS also runs about one board for non-technical degrees each year.<br>  Major:  AFA flying is concerned doesn't matter.  In fact the board doesn't see your academic major and wouldn't care if it did.  HOWEVER:  if you're considering an AFROTC scholarship, or an OTS bid-you better consider majoring in Engineering, Math, or CS/IT.  <br>  Assuming you get into the officer training program of your choice, then comes the SUPT selection process.  You will apply for this around your 2nd/3rd year of ROTC, or with your OTS application package.  The board looks at three things: physical, AFOQT scores, and your civilian flying history and letters from active/retired aircrew etc.  If you tube any one of these areas-you're done.  But you can apply every year until you're 27 1/2.<br>  Physical:  CURRENT standards are 20/70 correctable to 20/20. No colorblindness, depth perception, astigmatism or night vision issues.  No history of asthma since age 12, no cardio, diabetes hi/lo blood pressure (Lo BP is waiverable).  No hearing issues; no periods of unconsciousness >5-7min since age 14.  Ht:  64-77" sitting 33-44".  No CHRONIC sinusitis/hay fever seasonal's OK (Springtime in Deutschland just used to kill me-but I digress...).  No emotional/mental issues you've sought treatment for as an adult.  Surgical correction is accepted, PROVIDED a waiver is approved.  <br>  AF Officer Qualifying Test:  It's like the SAT/ACT test. There's an aircrew section that tests your ability to interpret data and visualize in 3D-I believe there's also a basic hand/eye coordination test now too.  High scores are better<br>  Other stuff:  JROTC participation, Civil Air Patrol-outstanding AFROTC record all help.  Civilian flying experience is also VERY positive, as are letters from active/retired aircrews attesting to your "rated potential".  ANYTHING you can list here moves you ahead of the others, PPL, student license, glider license, loggable time-I made copies of my logbook for my UNT application.  Flying time also helps with the AFOQT too.<br>  Stuff you can do now:<br>  - Study hard.  Sure your folks tell you this every day, hourly in my case, but a high GPA is a key for an Academy or even ROTC scholarship.  Also good study habits developed now in your 1st yr of HS will help a lot in college and at SUPT.  Now you've got a reason to put in those hours.  Also, take what you enjoy obviously, but try to get some AP/Honors classes too.  ESPECIALLY the calc series and chem; these are the traditional killers for academy cadets.<br>  - Get in shape/stay in shape.  Sports are good, even intermurals; anything to show you're well-rounded.  If you can get a position of leadership/varsity that's even more impressive.

Get up to speed on what the AF does, its inventory, current missions etc.  This way you can speak intelligently to an ROTC interview board, Academy board and aircrews, when it comes time to ask for recommendations.

If we don't address the real problems that are developing we're going to be faced with a world situation that will dwarf such BS as this political circus we're being treated to here. The young people in America are astonishingly naive about what's taking shape around the world (and here) and are taking for granted the safety we've had for these past 60 or so years. We're entering a time of threat that has no precedent in mans history, and our youth (and most women) think a few domestic adjustments are all we need to "change" things. I suggest you (all of you) turn off Oprah and MTV for a while, unplug your lazy kids computer, and take a focused look around you. We're in trouble friends, and if we continue to respond to the serious worsening with fairytale solutions we're not going to survive.

We assume that they are like us, and in doing so we allow ourselves to ignore those attributes they have with which we are uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Neurotic projection is perceiving others as operating in ways one unconsciously finds objectionable in yourself. <br>  Complementary projection is assuming that others do, think and feel in the same way as you. <br>  Complimentary projection is assuming that others can do things as well as you. <br>  Projection also appears where we see our own traits in other people, as in the false consensus effect. Thus we see our friends as being more like us than they really are.<br>  <br>  <br>  Example<br>  I do not like another person. But I have a value that says I should like everyone. So I project onto them that they do not like me.

We can thus criticize the other person, distancing ourselves from our own dysfunction.<br>  <br>  One explanation is that the ego perceives dysfunction from 'somewhere' and then seeks to locate that somewhere. The super ego warns of punishment if that somewhere is internal, so the ego places it in a more acceptable external place - often in convenient other people.<br>  <br>  Projection turns neurotic or moral anxiety into reality anxiety, which is easier to deal with.<br>  <br>  Projection is a common attribute of paranoia, where people project dislike of themselves onto others such that they believe that most other people dislike them.<br>  <br>  Projection helps justify unacceptable behavior, for example where a person claims that they are sticking up for themselves amongst a group of aggressive other people.<br>  <br>  Empathy, where a person experiences the perceived emotions|`|0jmVA50Jaa	Anyone who tries to label our President in comparisson to Hitler is really ignorant to the fact.

His list of accomplishments are literally ZERO, & at current rate this list may dip into the negative numbers.<br>  Think about this for a moment... what would happen if Obama dropped dead from a heart attack?  Biden would be our next president immediately.  <br>  What would happen if Steven Hawkings died today?  Who would replace him?  Where could you go to find another Hawkings?

While Obama stumbles around waiting for his orders from the feds Bernanke, Ron would be issuing orders to Bernanke & the fed reserve.  Yhat's the "diff"!<br>  Some may try to "decoy" Obama but I believe most think that Obama simply lacks the credentials & shares a bogus philosophy to boot.  Truly, & I'm not being sarcastic, I see Obama more in the role of an insurance agent.

Obama even sued CITIBank as a lawyer for ACORN so as to force them to make such loans to deadbeat blacks and hispanics, illegal aliens, whoever wanted to participate in the hate-whitey racial shakedown of our financial institutions.<br>  <br>  It's all part of the Cloward-Piven Strategy of Orchestrated Crisis, a Saul Alinsky-ite Marxist scheme intended to overwhelm the capitalist, free-enterprise welfare state with ungodly amounts of entitlement demands and overburden it until the entire economic system collapses.  The strategy was actually outlined by two professors, Cloward and Piven, who as acolytes of Saul Alinsky ("Rules for Radicals") advocated it in order to bring about communism in America--"change."<br>  <br>  BTW, Obama used to teach Alinsky's methods at the University of Chicago!

pnkyubEAaa	The con's include being away from your family (if your married) or friends for extended periods of time. If you're on a ship, count on being away for a couple of months.  If you're single, it's not a big deal unless you have a girlfriend or boyfriend.  My girlfriends would usually be my ex girlfriend whenever I returned from a 2 month patrol. Aviation is much better.  Our longest deployments were only 3 weeks, and they are always to exotic locations (Aruba, Puerto Rico, Colombia...)  Pay is low on the enlisted side at first, but much better for officers. But factoring in the cost of medical nowadays, the fact you will get it for free means you're equivalent pay is actually much more than it appears.  The food can be very good by the way.  It's hit or miss depending on how good your galley staff is. Sometimes, you'll work 16 or 20 hours in a day. You'll have to miss meals. You'll work on holidays many times.  But I've always found one thing.  The Coast Guard always rewards you with lots of time off to make up for the hard times.  Especially in aviation, I would say, overall, I have more time off than my civilian friends.  Crew rest is a big issue, so we have to get time off to make sure we're on our "A" game when we're flying.  One final point.  I work with members of the Navy, Marines, and Air Force.  Almost everyone has said they wish they knew about the CG before joining their respective service, and several are in the process of filling out the paperwork to cross over from their service. They're doing this even though they'll have to go down a rank, some of them 2 ranks. Even the hardened Marines admit they wish they'd known about the CG. The CG is a good deal.

60f46466d2dd728810388e09955b9b12aa	sorry too say they will not get a visa,better not to try and waste time and money.<br>  <br>  no value for the letter from the school regarding ur bf and family.<br>  they have to try by themselves for a tourist visa.|`|a57f3452d9ef1f62cbcc55c95fd107c3aa	No. Your relatives and boyfriend have to apply Visitor's visa on their own at US Embassy in Haiti. Consular Officer is the only person who can approve their visas. You can send invitation for the graduation. But that's all you could do. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1262.html" rel="nofollow">http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/...</a>|`|04Te5gzzaa	Yes, it's possible that you have the school write an invitation letter for your family but I doubt it will work for your boyfriend since he is not related.  Even then, with the invitation letter, there's no guarantee that they will get visas.  It all depends on the likelihood that they will decide to remain in the US illegally.  At the visa interview, they will have to provide some proof of strong ties in Haiti that they will return...like owning property or a business or showing a large balance in their bank accounts.  Without proof that they will return, they probably won't get a visa.|`|f73e29492e4cdf4bf4b9851c100a1fd1aa	Ok - Contrary to what people believe, the type of vehicle your boyfriend is attempting to get is one of the easiest visas to obtain. Non-immigrant visa (anyone who does not plan on immigrating to the US) are MUCH easier to obtain than a immigrant visa (someone who plans on living here).<br>  <br>  Your boyfriend needs to apply at the US Consularr Office in Hati for a B-2 Visa. He will need a valid passport valid for atleast 6 months after his contemplated date of stay upon admission into the US. Upon admission into the US, he will need to prove that he plans to leave the US prior to the visa expiring (return plane ticket does the trick).<br>  <br>  Keep in mind the B-2 Visa (Visitor Visa) does not allow him to work, it is for visiting only. It will allow him to stay atleast 6 months in the US but not more than 1 year. Of course, he can leave before 6 months, but that is the minimum it is valid for. He will need to apply quickly, the wait times can vary, but this is the fastest way in the US.<br>  <br>  You do not need any additional letters, etc for the visa or upon admission.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps, Good luck,<br>  <br>  <br>  ======UPDATE====<br>  To answer your new questions, for the B2 Visa, by law the minimum is 6 months regardless if he only intends to stay for 1 month. Unfortunately, there is no way around that, however it will not affect anything if he leaves after the one month. Generally, the B-2 visas are pretty quick to receive but it also depends on fast they respond to requests from the US Embassy. There is no requirement for non-immigrants to read/write english as they are not considered for residence to the United States. <br>  <br>  For the fiancee, you would have to be a US Citizen yourself (not sure if you are, assuming you are) and you will need to petition the K-1 Visa (Fiancee). That visa is only valid for 90 Days, and no extensions are available. Again, that visa is also quick to receive, however, if the US Government did find out that no marriage was intended, it is considered a Federal Felony under 18 USC 1324. Your aunt, would not be able to apply under the K-1. Depending on how the K-1 visa period ends, he may be ineligble to receive another visa (inadmissible) for a certain time frame. All in all, both visas are fairly quick to obtain for them, however, the B-2 visa would IMO be the best route to apply.|`|NFG9zF4zaa	You can always try, it's definitely not gonna hurt but there is never a guarantee that they will get a visa.

99Znmg81aa	Hard to tell.  The name of the file is Medicaid spending, but it isn't clear if that was supposed to be an estimate, or federal money, or total spent by the feds and states, or what.....<br>  <br>  As for Medicaid and illegal immigrants, couple of things: <br>  1) Medicaid doesn't cover illegal immigrants, and doesn't even cover all legal immigrants. <br>  2) AEMA, on the other hand, is Alien Emergency Medical Assistance.  It's not Medicaid - it's a separate funding source, separate program.  And it pays for exactly what it sounds like - emergency care for non-citizens.<br>  <br>  If you have issues with the cost of caring for immigrants (legal or otherwise) or are researching the cost, AEMA is the one to look at.

V3rdxOOTaa	any marines out there dont get me wrong  but I think recon is just the elite infratry unit they do the samething as infantry but have better training and concentrate more on extracting hostages and taking the enemy down like they always do. Atleast for me I might be wrong but I dont think theres really much diffrence from the infantry except is harder training and better skilled.|`|neFd6a4paa	Very, very difficult to answer. I might say Force Recon, because they take very experienced infantrymen, non-infantrymen who've made it in Recon Battalion (a step lower than Force Recon) and top Recon NCO's who are branching out. It also appears that Force Recon will also be drawing from MARSOC nco's who've completed a tour and are rotating back to the Fleet FMF before rotating back into Marsoc. That's a nice pool of talent don't you think? And not all of them are accepted!<br>  <br>  As for the Navy SEALS they have to take raw sailors (usually with no prior experience) and not only transform them into combatants, but train them to a very high level as special operators. Before that, they need to make them effective divers (which is very challenging physically and mentally) ----something that the other branches do, but it's usually something you work on AFTER you've proven yourself capable of being in the unit.<br>  <br>  The attrition is tremendous. However, the SEALS are held in such high regard that even olympians are trying out to become a part of them. The SEALS also draw the highest amount of college graduates (a lot of people in the military don't admit the correlation, but a degree is a good test of your ability to stick with something, and to learn) out of all the special operations forces that submitted that kind of information.<br>  <br>  <br>  So I'm really not sure how to answer it....Maybe SEALS, Maybe Force Recon. My bet is on Force Recon because of the level of experience a basic recon Marine brings to the table before he tries out for Force Recon. If they aren't already harder to get into, they'll soon be as the Marine Corps  misused and underfunded Force Recon for a LONG time and Force Recon was still highly regarded.|`|yKLBdoigaa	different jobs and different training. But I would put my bet on SEALS, I've read more books about their training and it seems a bit more intense.

fAaLjlI0aa	Your post is very difficult to decipher. Basically, from what I can understand, you signed a six month lease, which is up on March 8. You could have given him a 30 day notice of intent to vacate as of Feb 8. You do not have to wait until your lease expires, only until 30 days before it does. With the problems you describe, you could have moved much sooner, and made him pay for your child's hospitalization as well if he knew about the problems before the baby came ill. <br>  <br>  Does your lease indicate a 30- day notice is *required*? If not, you may not have to give him that much notice. You should contact the Tenant's Rights attorneys in your area and find out what your options are. It sounds like the property is not fit to rent, so you may be able to move out immediately without suffering any penalties if that is the case.

Single-mother homes are the leading causes of both poverty and crime, a statistical fact that has been known for 20 years.<br>  <br>  And one of the main causes of single-mother homes is welfare. Again, studies have shown that when welfare and other entitlement programs are increased, the rate of single-mother homes also increases.<br>  <br>  Cut back on those programs and it will force families to stay together for economic survival, thereby giving their children a dramatically higher chance of success in life.|`|H5Oz7oODaa	Poverty is a big issue. First of all, there are a lot of factors that causes poverty in society. The poor people poor have children, they are less educated than the other classes of society. Probably they will not have the oportunity to give a good school preparation for their children and then they will become jobless when they grow. And it starts again with their childrens. It′s a vicious circle. The government has to assist the poor people inside good programs to make them free from the poverty, but the poor people also must want to get out of it.

As society evolves, so do the circumstances that face it. Think about it, does any country, regardless of how popular or developed, have no poverty?<br>  <br>  The only exception that I have ever heard of is some ruler hundreds of years ago, in some European country, who was considered to be a horrible leader, and he had everyone who was at or below the poverty level in his country executed. A vile thing to do, yes, but he also singlehandedly eliminted poverty in his country.|`|PvqLMauCaa	The world bank.

3MM64geHaa	When was health care not for profit? You mean when it was not regulated? When we did not have so many different specialties to combat the health problems of the nation? Are you referring to the old west doc who just gave everyone whiskey for what ailed them? I just don't know where you are coming from other than maybe you just can't stand it that a man who spends almost a million dollars on becoming a doctor wants to make a good living.|`|AA11702773	It was never 'not for profit', what it was was far less regulated, and yes, as a result, cheaper.<br>  <br>  Ron Paul has a pretty telling chapter on this in his 'Revolution: a Manifesto', and from a doctor who never took Medicaid but gave free or discounted care when patients couldn't afford it, I think he has a pretty clear angle on it.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	There are two things that have affected the price of healthcare in America.  First, over the past 50 years we have come up with more and more technology, which is a good thing because it enables us to treat people more successfully, but which is a bad thing because all that costs money.  The other thing is the evolution of health insurance.  Although Blue Cross first arose in the 1920's, widespread health insurance did not come into its own until the '40's.  When health care was on a fee-for-service basis, costs were kept down because most people would not have been able to pay for it.  As more and more people got health insurance, doctors and hospitals began to raise their rates, since the insurance would pay more than the old fee schedules.  As the cost of medical expenses rose, those that had health insurance were OK, but those who did not were faced with higher and higher bills that they could not pay.  More and more they turned to public health facilities, and often could not even pay that bill.  And when people could not pay, that meant that the rates were raised on the insured, who were disconnected from the actual cost, to cover the losses on those who could not pay.  It's a deadly spiral that has brought public health to its knees and may well kill it.|`|tyvFUPOxaa	Health care like any other opportunity has always cost. In the past, people did not live as long as they do now, simply, because they could not afford health care. For American citizens, like the citizens of other countries, the basic law of supply and demand has dictated the costs of medical care in societies with limited health care resources and doctors.<br>  <br>  In the past, people used what ever medications or knowledge they had to survive their health crises. Walk through a cemetery sometime and read the tombstones. Learn how long people lived and how so many new born babies did not survive. And realize that without health insurances available, the patients and doctors bartered to pay for medical expenses.|`|AA11121510	Healthcare has NEVER been a not-for-profit venture in the United States. <br>  <br>  Decades ago, it was more affordable because we did not have expensive tests and the expensive drugs that we have today.  Of course, the downside is that more people died of diseases that are curable today.|`|KiLGNvLeaa	When I was growing up, Dr's still made house calls. and health care came with your job, and no one was tuned away due to lack of it(yes this was in America) It was affordable and it worked

The bailouts are saving the financial system, that is the value of financial assets, so not even rich people are   up in arms because without the bailouts they might end up with nothing.

gasquENMaa	This is a political hot potato here but I do want to add my two cents also. <br>  <br>  Until the mid 70's, the USA used what was called Civil Death. The convict was kicked off the face of the planet and had NO rights while incarcerated for a felony crime. Life was harsh inside the wire, amenities were non existent, the con had to work in a prison factory 8 hours a day for 15 cents an hour and the products made were sold on the public market to help reduce the public burden of their incarceration. The lifestyle of the time FORCED the convict to reconsider his ways and he made his own mind up to rehabilitate himself in order NOT to return to prison again after release. The recidivism rate in this time period was 15% ( that means 15 out of each 100 persons caught another number and went back to prison).<br>  <br>  Now the mid 70's comes and the liberals start looking at the penal system. The prison factories are torn down. Inmates ( no longer allowed to call them "cons", it might offend them) sit around watching 60 inch color tv's that the taxpayer provides, working out in the taxpayer supplied gyms or sitting in the taxpayer supplied legal libraries desperately pouring over the books for a loophole to overturn their case or search for a reason to file a frivolous lawsuit since it costs them NOTHING to file lawsuit after lawsuit. ( two examples I will use that were filed at my prison in the past years. The first one was that the chow hall only served smooth peanut butter and his digestive system needed chunky peanut butter. Filed for $25,000 for pain and suffering. DENIED. The second one was the stainless steel toilet caused an inmate's hemmorhoids to inflame, causing him pain. Filed for $50,000 for pain and suffering. DENIED. ( PS...the reason we only have stainless steel toilets is when we used to have ceramic ones, the cons would break them up and sharpen the pieces they broke off for weapons).<br>  <br>  Inmates no longer work in prison. They are assigned jobs like sweeping and mopping, working in foodservice or yard details. Absolutely nothing is being done to help reduce the public burden of the cost of their incarceration. Unlike the olden days, when a con was made to get up at 5 am each day to work, the inmate today sleeps in and develops NO work ethics or good habits that will help him when he is released. <br>  <br>  We now have mandated rehabilitative classes, courses and therapy. It may sound great, but keep in mind that only a person who WANTS to be rehabilitated will accept this and embrace it. 99% of the inmates today attend only because it is a hole shot if they don't. They don't care nor pay attention.<br>  <br>  The recidivism rate is an astounding 84% and the liberals are screaming "Look, we are saving 16 out of each 100". <br>  <br>  Our penal system has developed into a society where the inmates feel some massive sense of entitlement. They do not accept nor understand anything less because upper management is told to treat them with kindler and gentler ways. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the decision makers in the penal system are coming right out of college into midlevel or higher management positions. They base their collective decisions and judgments on college class modules which are based on how the average person feels, thinks and responds. Inmates DO NOT think, act, respond or behave like the average law abiding citizen. <br>  <br>  In the old days, a person started out walking the blocks and progressed through the system making warden in 20 years. They knew and understood how the criminal mind thought and dealt with them on their level. Not today. <br>  <br>  The one thing the liberals do not understand or believe is that "kindness is mistaken for weakness" in the prison environment. I am not saying to bring back a Shawshank Redemption philosophy, but until we make life harsh again inside the wire, the inmates of today will not fear coming back to prison. This is why we have a recidivism rate of 84% and it shows NO signs of reducing itself, despite all kinds of new rehabilitative classes that are being introduced on a weekly basis. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps and you can find it useful <br>  Source(s):<br>  20 years as a Corrections Officer in a max prison|`|BQdXnCcHaa	A lack of capital punishment.|`|O2fZVfPDaa	the recidivism rate is always going to be high.  In a system where incarceration is the nominal mode of punishment all country's have high recidivism rates.  Those country's with the lowest rates of recidivism usual back up laws with severe punishments carried out in public.  It's a psychological thing where if I know I will loose my hand for stealing that $100 jacket I'm going to think a lot harder about it than if I might go to spend a weekend in jail and pay back the costs.|`|jIONJZSJaa	Some countries have the "eye for an eye" mentality that keeps recidivism down.  Here however, we have a lot of drug and alcohol abusers, who are not treated properly.  They have an addiction and should go to rehab.  Our judical system thinks that this will go away with time spent in prison.  Clearly, this isn't working.  Also, its very hard to find a decent job once released from prison.  A lot of these people have paid their debt to society, but are continued to be looked down upon, treated like second class citizens.  So a number of them will return to their old lives because they are ultimately not being given the opportunity to succeed while trying to start a new life.

"If your not part of the solution, then you MUST be part of the problem:"<br>  <br>  The formula allows that a problem exists, and allows the possibility of a solution. But the formula fails to allow for dialog. <br>  <br>  Listen to Al Sharpton for an extended period and you'll hear the formula in his speech, but you will never hear him allow caucasians to choose for themselves which side of the formula they live on.<br>  <br>  And white people know this. So rather than being labeled a racist, whites will suffer from "white guilt" and jump to the solution side of the equation.<br>  <br>  So, you can be part of the solution by being not white, or by being white but placing yourself in servitude to the judgement of others, or you can be a racist. But you have no other choices, and you are not allowed to create other choices for yourself.<br>  <br>  That is the racism which America is brimming with, not the Klan.|`|oO4TUkVkaa	I never doubted one could be but the one they have voted into office should not be there.

India is already a nation of many countries conjoined together. <br>  <br>  Though we called it as India, when there is a crisis in a state, it is only the state people fight for it and not the whole of India. Example, the Kaveri river issue, Karnataka is not bothered about what the supreme court tells. Suddenly after a long sleep, the marathis have woken up and they started to beat the Hindians. In Assam, if any theatre shows a Hindi movie, the theatre will be burnt. Nobody can do anything. Many of the north  eastern states do not associate themselves as Indians, though they come under India. In Tamilnadu for the ongoing crisis, the hindian govt is not even bothered about Tamils feelings.  <br>  <br>  Therefore, we cannot call it as one India, rather we can call it as United States of India just like United Kingdom or UAE, where four counries are put together. This is the high time to amend Indian constitution to devolve and give complete rights to the states to act as a  seperate country. this should include managing their own internal and external affairs. Just like Quebec in Canada, which has got its own immigration policies oppossed to federal policies of the Govenment. <br>  <br>  In this present climate, INDIA has failed to manage and represent all the states. Therefore, all the states  should have their autonomy to take their own decisions under the federal govt of India which will act only as a security body  which should be called as United states of India. Probably like the European Union  where all the tiny nations come under the same treaty without losing their identity.|`|XQYD48MYaa	The problem is not different languages, but aristocratic gandhi family rule. <br>  <br>  Gandhi family is fucke*d up retarded people.

It is because the deciding factors arent the Tamil Nadu Goverment but the central Govt which is controlled by Hindian Politicians<br>  If it would have been a Hindi speaker who were to face a similar problem, an immediate aid and affort would have been made to make sure to save its people there.<br>  <br>  I am sick of the attitude of the Hindian Bollywood Goverment

The UK's lost 25% of it's buying power in the last few months because it's so exposed.  Look what happened in Iceland!!<br>  <br>  Which brings me neatly round to answering your question:  Iceland despite it's current situation is a strong country, if we allow if we allow them join the EU and Euro now they have the capacity to benefit the EU when the upturn comes.
Kl77Jjg0aa	This is from my personal knowledge and may not be 100% correct. <br>  <br>  My friend did his GCSE's and then went on to college to study "Public services" or something similar. I think that after that you will apply to the police force and spend around 18 months training before you become a police officer. The  you would undertake further training to become a mounted policeman etc. <br>  <br>  As i said this is from my experience and may be inaccurate. If you really want to join the police force i would recommend asking at a police station or your nearest collage. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!
f51xwGyYaa	Firefighters in cities earn very good money and have great conditions. It is quite hard to get in and few people leave. The pay is different in each state, you'll need to look at each State Government's site for exact figures. One thing to remember though... their base salary is low BUT they earn MUCH more through overtime, and other conditions, benefits etc. To apply you'd contact the department in any state or territory. I may be wrong but I'd guess that the ACT and NT would pay the most.|`|AA12074269	As raymondo said - the firefighters you have seen fighting the bush fires are mostly (95%) volunteers. In our area there are <10 paid firefighters but over 100 on the books to be used when there is a need.|`|8suJecV2aa	almost all are unpaid volunteers,  the only paid firefighters are profrssional experanced people whose skills are needed
tyvFUPOxaa	As reliable as a capitalistic society or one with alleged socialistic policies. <br>  <br>  I was in Iran in 1979. The Iranians were like violated virgins. They could not believe what they had become. And you could feel the electricity in the air from people who were suddenly freed from a brutal king and his henchmen.<br>  <br>  The problem with most non-Islamic people is their ignorance about the ways of Islamic people; and the problem with Islamic people is their ignorance about the ways of Christian people. And this applies to Jewish people and people of all other religions.<br>  <br>  We awaken every morning to sunlight from God, we put on our school or work clothes, we eat our morning meals, and we go off to work or to school. Each of our days begin with a morning and they end with a night, after we have all struggled with basically the same challenges. And the vast majority of us are from among the masses. We need fresh air, we need fresh water, we need nutritious food, we need education, we need work, and we need to be loved between our prayers to the only God. And we wonder why can't other people realize this...<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, what is happening everywhere? Be honest when you answer this question... The same things are happening everywhere as our governments seek to divide us and install false hate between us. The international bankers are exploiting us. And on and on...<br>  <br>  But the truth is, we have just become our own worst enemies because we are gullible and we allow ourselves to be exploited because we fear people who are different. How hopeless? How foolish? How dumb? We actually think we have all of the right answers...<br>  <br>  And the real Satan or Devil is thankful for our ignorances; after all, he has plently of equal treatment for all of us.|`|MnbUtKE3aa	Your answer is in the quran{Spell checker does not know how to spell it]This is a missionary religion that dos not take no for an answer.And ONE of their worst sins is to try to convert a Muslim to another religion.I don't think there can be peace with them until every one converts to islam.They do not consider islmic laws inhuman,But God's laws|`|AA11121510	Zero as long as they worship the religion of the devil.|`|hHGNE0IRaa	I don't understand what you are asking.

It shows the difference in Western Culture where the king or warriors are expected to sacrifice themselves vs. all other cultures where warriors and kings oppress the population.  Wherever Western culture goes, this is the defining characteristic.  <br>  <br>  Do not confuse Western Culture with Western Civilization, they are different.  Example, Japan is becoming more Western Culture, America is become less Western culture.<br>  <br>   Islam's culture, means  obey or "submission".  It is therefore impossible for them to live in peace so long as any resist what they believe is "islam".  Don't believe me.  Search the term harem on YA and see how submissive their women are.  Why?  Because even if you are the wife of a wealthy American businessman, you may be beheaded if you do not submit. <br>  <br>   Since wisdom comes from the YHWH, not allah, there are no wise members of the islamic society.

(Look how well they made out 4.5 billion dollars is coming their way for the spectacular way they handled the election for Obama!!)|`|NrkWd4Aoaa	The idea that voter fraud significantly affected the outcome of the 2009 election is in my opinion overblown.  <br>  <br>  You guys who are upset that the McCain didn't win need to take a cold, clear-eyed look at the fruits of the Bush administration... you are not that much different from those of us who lamented the outcome of the 2000 race.  Remember Florida????<br>  <br>  I wish that McCain had been the Republican nominee in 2000, maybe open primaries would have made that happen.  I, personally, like the idea of non-partisan primaries, but abuse can happen there, too.  Witness "Operation Chaos" = allowed by the rules but NOT designed with the idea of electing the best candidate, it was explicitly for the purpose of causing the Democratic primary to be as painful as possible.<br>  <br>  Everyone, in my opinion, is morally and ethically bound to choose in good faith the  candidate  who would make the best President.  Each person will decide which attributes are most important to this end.<br>  <br>  On the economic crisis:  <br>  <br>  What, exactly is YOUR SOLUTION as opposed to your CRITICISM?  <br>  <br>  The economic disaster that we are experiencing will be painful to solve AND to live through.

Chances are one of those sites is near someplace the person goes regularly!  Some cab companies have security cameras in the vehicles, a "silent witness" in case of customers that do not pay or assault/robbery of a driver.

We are not going to become less dependent on China but more if the economy tanks bc they own so much of our debt.

Having realistically recognized others' kindness as well as their faults, love is always focused on the other person’s welfare. We have no ulterior motives to fulfill our self-interest or to fulfill our desires; we love others simply because they exist. Attachments exaggerates others' good qualities and makes us crave to be with them. When we're with them, we're happy but when we're separated from them, we are miserable. These attachments are linked with expectations of what others should be or do. Is love as it is usually understood in most societies really love? Let's examine this a bit more. Generally we are attracted to people either because they have qualities we value or because they help us in some way. If we observe our own thought processes carefully - we'll notice that we look for specific qualities in others. Some of these qualities we find attractive, others are those our parents, or society value. We examine someone's looks, education, financial situation, social status. This is how most of us decide on whether or not the person holds any true value to us. In addition, we judge people as worthwhile according to how they relate to us. If they help us, make us feel secure, listen to what we have to say, care for us when we are sick, we consider them good people and it is this type of people we are most likely to be more attracted to. But this is very biased, for we judge them only in terms of how they relate to us, as if we are the most important person in the world. After we've judged certain people to be good for us, whenever we see them it appears to us as if goodness is coming from them, but if we are more aware, we recognize that we have projected this goodness onto them. Desiring to be with the people who make us feel good, we become emotional yo-yo's - when we're with these people, we're up, when we're not with these people, we're down. Furthermore, we form fixed concepts of what our relationships with those people will be and thus have expectations of them. When they do not live up to our expectations of them, we're disappointed, or may become angry. We want them to change so that they will they will match what we think they are. But our projections and expectations come from our own minds, not from the other people. Our problems arise not because others aren't who we thought they we're, but because we mistakenly thought they were something they aren't. Checklist: "I Love You if __________ " What we call love is most often attachments. It is actually a disturbing attitude that overestimates the qualities of another person. We then cling to tightly to that person, thinking our happiness depends on that person. Love, on the other hand, is an open and calm, relaxed attitude. We want someone to be happy, and free from suffering simply because they exist. While attachments are uncontrolling and too sentimental. Love is direct and powerful. Attachments obscure our judgment and we become impatient, angry, and impartial, helping only our dear ones and harming those who we don't like. Love clarifies our minds and we access a situation by thinking of the greatest good for everyone. Attachments are based on selfishness, while love is founded upon cherishing others, even those who do not look very appealing to the eyes. Love looks beyond all the superficial appearances. If we see unattractive, dirty, ignorant people, we feel repulsed because our minds want to know attractive, intellectual, clean and talented people. Love recognizes that regardless of the others' appearances, their experience is the same as ours: they wish to be happy, to be free from sufferings, and to do their best to avoid problems. When we're overly attached to a person, we're not mentally and emotionally free. We overly depend on and cling to the person to fulfill our mental and especially our emotional needs. We fear losing the person, feeling we'd be incomplete without him. However, this does not mean that we should suppress our emotional needs or become aloof, alone and totally independent, for that too does not solve the problem. We must simply realize our unrealistic needs, and slowly seek to eliminate them. Some emotional needs may be so strong that they can't be dissolved immediately. If we try to suppress them or pretend they do not exist, we become anxious and insecure. In this case, we can do our best to fulfill our needs while simultaneously working gradually to subdue them. The core problem is that most of us seek to be loved, rather than to love. We yearn to be understood by others rather than to understand them. In all honesty, our sense of emotional insecurities comes from the selfishness obscuring our own minds. We 'can' develop self-confidence by recognizing our inner potential to become a selfless human being with many magnificent qualities, then we'll develop a true and accurate feeling of self-confidence. And then we'll seek to increase love - without attachments, to increase compassion, to cultivate lovingkindness, patience, compassion, generosity, understanding and wisdom. Under the influence of attachments we're bound by our emotional reactions to others. When they are nice to us, we're happy. When they ignore us or speak sharply to us, we take it personally and are unhappy. But pacifying these attachments doesn't mean we become hard-hearted. Rather, without attachments there will be space in our hearts and minds for genuine impartial love for them. We'll be actively involved with them. As we learn to subdue our selfish attachments, we can have successful friendships and personal relationships with others. These relationships will be richer because of the freedom and respect which the relationships will be based on. However, our lifestyles and interests may be more compatible with those of some people more so than with others and that is alright. In any case, our relationships will be based on mutual love, mutual interests, and the wish to help each other in life".|`|fQ3d5iAWaa	here is one site: <a href="http://www.thefamily.org/dossier/statements/lol.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thefamily.org/dossier/stateme...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  and here is some add to it: Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.<br>  <br>   Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. or we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this will help.|`|yqXjJFipaa	black guys r sexy!

What also needs to be done is a big increase in the income tax rate for the top income tax bracket.<br>  Nothing creates the incentive to invest in the USA economy more than forcing the rich and big business to either give up 70% of their taxable income to the IRS or invest enough of it into the USA economy to drop them into the next tax bracket.<br>  Back in 2001, Bush told us that we needed to give tax cuts to the rich because we were headed into a recession and that it would give them the incentive to invest.<br>  Well, they invested, just not very much into things that would create jobs.<br>  So here we are with less jobs now than we had in 2001.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, your governor will take the stimulus money and even if he doesn't there is a provision in the bill that allows state legislators to overrule the governor and take the money.<br>  Your governor is just trying to show that he is loyal to the party and will back the party priority of Greed Over People.

a91372078e679ab6ed9d09c5de65376baa	Estoy al 100% de acuerdo contigo: Porfirio Diaz fue un verdadero héroe y sobre todo antes de que fuera presidente: Los registro de la batalla del 5 de Mayo dan nota que él fue una parte importantísima de la derrota de los franceses; ya en la batalla de la Carbonera en Oaxaca, el ejercito francés estaba bien armado y con mas elementos que los hermanos Diaz, pero éste les infringió una derrota que ahí comenzó al verdadera caída del Ejercito Imperial...Fue el artífice de que Juarez pudiera entrar victorioso a la Ciudad de Mèxico. Ya como presidente, organizó al país y lo llevó a lugares inimaginables al grado que a la Cd. de Mèxico lleva el sobrenombre de "La Ciudad de los Palacios" y el Monumento de la Revolución, era la pura entrada al Palacio de Justicia que Diiaz mandó construir. Su pecado fue: no saber retirarse a tiempo y cuando llegó la revolución Mexicana, el país se atarazó como 50 a?os. Una de las frases mas celebres de Diaz cuando dejó la presidencia fue: "Ya soltaron a la caballada: Ahora quiero saber quien la va a domar y a castrar"!

Estan de acuerdo con la pena de muerte mientras el verdugo sea otro.<br>  El sistema judicial estadounidense lleva al delincuente a una sesion de valoracion de la prueba, esto es que se establece si hay suficientes pruebas para demostrar que es culpable y solo entonces se procede a un juicio.

El objetivo de la cárcel es que el criminal razone que lo que hizo fue incorrecto y que debe pagar un precio por su crimen. La pena de muerte no genera readaptación social y no genera escarmiento en los posibles criminales, esto se ha observado en los países que la aplican que no ha disminuido el índice de criminalidad. Tampoco veo conveniente que los presos no realicen ninguna actividad mientras se encuentren presos, deberían ganarse su sustento día a día como todos lo hacemos. Existen varios programas en el que incluso empresas contratan a persona dentro de los reclusorios para que fabrique o manufacturen mientras cumplan con su sentencia, pero la participación es libre y se le devenga un sueldo al preso, la participación debería ser obligatoria y que el recurso generado sirva para resarcir el da?o a las víctimas de su delito.

Aún cuando casi todos los que te han respondido se basan en textos de Introducción al estudio del Derecho, la verdada es que se trata de un tema de Epistemología Jurídica (que ni siquiera se estudia en la licenciatura) o cuando menos de Filosofía del Derecho (que se estudia en el último semestre).<br>  <br>  La dificultad terminológica- conceptual de "Derecho" viene por varias razones. En primer lugar, existen muchísimas escuelas, doctrinas y corrientes dentro del estudio de las ciencias sociales. Esto sucede así también en las naturales y por supuesto, en las duras, pero esto deviene sin importancia (o al menos elimina el problema) debido a la contrastación o falsación de resultados (es decir, cuando una teoría no sirve para explicar un fenómeno determinado, o predice los resultados del mismo de forma erronea, es rechazada y reemplazada de inmediato); esto no sucede así en las ciencias sociales.<br>  <br>  Como no quiero hacer una respuesta que por abundante sea ineficaz, te responderé de una manera sencilla, aunque se pierda mucho contenido con ello:<br>  <br>  García Maynez nos dice,sustentado en la Fundamentación dela metafísica de las costumbres de Kant y la escuela clásica, que existen dos "derechos". Entendiendose este desde un aspecto objetivo y otro subjetivo, podemos decir que "Derecho" es el conjunto de normas imperativo- atributivas que regula la conducta externa del individuo y permite la vida en sociedad. Esto es, todas las leyes, pero no solo las leyes en sí, sino aún mas importante, los procesos de creación de las mismas, las "reglas del juego" del gobierno, la estructura y forma del estado,  que devienen del "pacto social" y se traducen en una constitución. Pero más allá de esto, "derecho" (y fíjate en la diferencia: una simple mayúscula) es aquello que DEBE SER en cuanto a que como seres humanos en general, y persona determinada en particular "merecemos" (como por ejemplo, cuando decimos que tenemos derecho a algo).<br>  <br>  Ambas concepciones están muy ligadas una a otra. Podemos decir que a primera vista, la segunda surge de la primera; es decir, que un conjunto de leyes, reglamentos, ordenanzas, decretos, hace que uno merezca algo, pero es al contrario. El tener derecho, es precisamente la razón y fuerza del Derecho en sí.<br>  <br>  Puedo ayudarte más, si lo deseas.

De acuerdo con la Constitución política de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, México es una República representativa, democrática y federal, constituida por estados libres y soberanos en todo lo concerniente a su régimen interior, pero unidos en una federación establecida según los principios de esta ley fundamental recogidos en su artículo 40, es decir, es la reunión de 31 estados y un Distrito Federal.<br>  <br>  2  ORGANIZACIóN DEL ESTADO <br>  <br>  Los estados adoptan en México su régimen interior de la forma de gobierno republicano, representativo y popular; tienen libertad para organizar su régimen interno y no tienen más limitaciones que las de no invadir las leyes y las facultades de los poderes federales. En lo que se refiere a su organización y administración internas, los estados son libres y pueden ejercer su gobierno conforme a sus propias leyes que en ninguna forma deben ser contrarias a la Constitución General de la República, sino adaptadas a los principios de la ley fundamental.<br>  <br>  De ahí que el Derecho mexicano se divida, con relación a la organización política de México, de acuerdo con una estructura federal y local. El Derecho federal está constituido por el conjunto de leyes que rigen en toda la nación y obligan por igual a todos los ciudadanos. El Derecho local rige en exclusiva dentro del territorio de cada estado de la República.<br>  <br>  El Distrito Federal, la otra entidad distintiva que integra la federación de México, es, asimismo, la sede de los llamados poderes federales, por lo que en el caso de que éstos se trasladen a otro lugar, su territorio, con los límites y extensión que le asigne el Congreso de la Unión, se convertirá en otro estado más de la federación. El gobierno del Distrito Federal está a cargo de los poderes federales, y los órganos ejecutivo, legislativo y judicial tendrán carácter local; lo ejercerán a través del gobierno del Distrito Federal de forma representativa y democrática, como establece la Constitución.<br>  <br>  Como tipo del sistema democrático representativo existe el régimen presidencial.<br>  <br>  3  LOS PODERES DEL ESTADO <br>  <br>  El supremo poder de la federación mexicana, se divide, para su ejercicio, en legislativo, ejecutivo y judicial según el artículo 49 de la Constitución. Dicha estructura implica, en consecuencia, que estos tres poderes se equilibren entre sí, limitándose unos a otros en tal forma, que se evita el desarrollo excesivo de uno de ellos en detrimento y perjuicio de la colectividad.<br>  <br>  El poder legislativo lo constituyen los representantes de la ciudadanía y es el llamado a formular las leyes que rigen en materia federal en la República Mexicana. Según el artículo 50 de la Constitución, el poder legislativo lo forma un Congreso General que a su vez se divide en dos cámaras: una de diputados y otra de senadores. Ambas cámaras tienen el mismo poder, puesto que representan al pueblo de México por igual. Sin embargo, cada cámara tendrá facultades exclusivas, las cuales se encuentran establecidas en los artículos 74 y 76 de la Constitución.<br>  <br>  La Cámara de Diputados está formada por representantes de la nación y la integran 300 diputados electos, según el principio de votación por mayoría relativa, mediante el sistema de distritos electorales uninominales, y hasta 200 diputados, que serán elegidos según el principio de representación proporcional a través del sistema de listas regionales, votadas en circunscripciones plurinominales.<br>  <br>  El Senado se compone de 128 senadores; es decir, de cuatro miembros por cada estado y el Distrito Federal; dos de ellos son elegidos según el principio de mayoría relativa, y uno será asignado a la primera minoría. Los treinta y dos senadores restantes serán elegidos según el principio de representación proporcional. La cámara de senadores se renueva en su totalidad cada seis a?os, por medio de elección directa.<br>  <br>  El poder judicial descansa en la Suprema Corte de Justicia, en un Tribunal Electoral, en tribunales colegiados de circuito, en tribunales unitarios de circuito, en juzgados de distrito, en el jurado popular federal y en los juzgados y tribunales del orden común de los estados, que actúan como auxiliares de los anteriores. El poder judicial es el encargado de decidir las controversias que se plantean sobre las responsabilidades públicas o privadas de los individuos. La imposición de penas es propia y exclusiva de la autoridad judicial.<br>  <br>  El poder ejecutivo federal lo ostenta un solo individuo, denominado, según el artículo 80 de la Constitución, presidente de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos. Está integrado por dos elementos: el titular del poder o presidente de la República y el conjunto de órganos que con él colaboran y le están subordinados (secretarías y departamentos). El presidente de la República asume una doble misión: una de orden político y otra administrativa. El carácter político del ejecutivo quiere decir que dispone del poder del Estado y que el ejercicio de dicho poder constituye el Gobierno. El carácter administrativo de su cargo viene dado por el hecho de constituirse como jefe de la Administración pública federal.<br>  <br>  4  FUENTES DEL DERECHO MEXICANO <br>  <br>  La ley, la jurisprudencia, la costumbre, la doctrina y los principios generales del Derecho. Como tales fuentes del Derecho, en ocasiones pueden tener fuerza obligatoria; pero dentro de este ámbito existe una preeminencia de unas fuentes respecto a las demás.<br>  <br>  México es un país de Derecho escrito y por este motivo las controversias judiciales del orden civil deberán resolverse conforme a la letra de la ley o a su interpretación jurídica. A falta de ley, como determina el artículo 19 del Código Civil federal, se resolverán conforme a los principios generales del Derecho. En los supuestos en que se produzca un conflicto de derechos, a falta de ley expresa que resulte aplicable, la controversia se decidirá, de conformidad con el artículo 20 del Código Civil, a favor del que trate de evitar perjuicios y no favor del que pretenda obtener lucro. El párrafo cuarto del artículo 14 de la Constitución, dice: “En los juicios del orden civil, la sentencia definitiva deberá ser conforme a la ley o la interpretación jurídica de la ley, y a falta de ésta, se fundará en los principios generales de Derecho”.<br>  <br>  5  LA JURISPRUDENCIA Y SU VALOR <br>  <br>  La jurisprudencia es la interpretación jurisdiccional del Derecho positivo que, conforme la legislación mexicana, sólo pueden realizar los tribunales federales. Para que pueda considerarse que existe una jurisprudencia aplicable, es necesario que la interpretación de la ley se ejecute sobre casos concretos, se repita al menos en cinco ocasiones y siempre en el mismo sentido, y dicha práctica adquiera un valor general.<br>  <br>  La ley de amparo establece como jurisprudencia de la Suprema Corte de Justicia las ejecutorias o sentencias de la misma, funcionando en pleno siempre que lo resuelto en ellas se encuentre en cinco ejecutorias no interrumpidas por otra en contrario y que hayan sido aprobadas por lo menos por 14 ministros. La jurisprudencia de la Corte puede interrumpirse o modificarse por resoluciones del mismo tribunal. Para que tal modificación surta efectos de jurisprudencia, se requiere que se expresen las razones que se tuvieron para variarla, las cuales deberán referirse a las que tuvieron presentes para establecer la jurisprudencia que se modifica. En México, la jurisprudencia de la Suprema Corte se convierte en obligatoria para todos los tribunales inferiores de la República, que deberán acatarla y aplicarla.<br>  <br>  6  JERARQUíA NORMATIVA <br>  <br>  Según el artículo 133 de la ley fundamental de México, la Constitución, las leyes del Congreso de la Unión que de ella emanen y todos los tratados que estén de acuerdo con la misma, celebrados y que se celebren por el presidente de la República con aprobación del Senado, serán la ley suprema de toda la Unión. Los jueces de cada estado se ajustarán a lo dispuesto por la Constitución, las leyes y los tratados, a pesar de la normas en contrario que puedan existir en las constituciones o las leyes de los estados.<br>  <br>  La jerarquía del orden jurídico en el Derecho mexicano es la siguiente: <br>  <br>  1. La Constitución; <br>  2. Los tratados internacionales y las leyes federales; <br>  3. Las leyes ordinarias; <br>  4. Los decretos; <br>  5. Los reglamentos; <br>  6. Las normas jurídicas individualizadas. <br>  <br>  <br>  7  LA CONSTITUCIóN, LEY FUNDAMENTAL DE MéXICO <br>  <br>  Toda la organización política responde al siguiente principio: la supremacía de la Constitución. Esto implica que ningún poder en México puede hallarse sobre la Constitución: ni el Gobierno federal, ni los estados, ni los órganos de los gobiernos federal o local. Por el contrario, toda autoridad está limitada por esta ley fundamental y a ella sometida.<br>  <br>  La Constitución es la norma suprema del país y todas las autoridades, sea cual fuere su jerarquía, deben ejercer su actividad de acuerdo a los mandatos y en concordancia con los principios que en ella se establecen.<br>  <br>  La Constitución política de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos vigente en la actualidad fue promulgada el 5 de febrero de 1917 y entró en vigor el 1 de mayo de ese mismo a?o. Está integrada por dos partes: la dogmática, que trata de los derechos fundamentales del hombre y contiene las limitaciones de la actividad del Estado frente a los particulares; y la orgánica, que tiene por objeto articular y estructurar el poder público, se?alando las facultades de sus órganos.<br>  <br>  8  LA CONSTITUCIóN Y LOS DERECHOS FUNDAMENTALES <br>  <br>  La Carta Magna de México garantiza y protege en sus primeros 28 artículos los derechos fundamentales, contenidos en el título primero, capítulo 1 de la Constitución Federal. El artículo primero de la Constitución declara: “En los Estados Unidos Mexicanos todo individuo gozará de las garantías (derechos fundamentales) que otorga esta Constitución, las cuales no podrán suspenderse, ni restringirse sino en los casos y con las condiciones que ella misma establece”. Este artículo garantiza la igualdad de los individuos para ser protegidos por la ley.<br>  <br>  Mediante las garantías consagradas en la Constitución, la ciudadanía hace valer sus derechos fundamentales frente al poder del Estado, trazando los límites de actuación de éste frente a los particulares. Consisten en el respeto a los derechos del hombre, que a su vez están constituidos por la facultad de los individuos para disfrutar de la igualdad, de la libertad, de la propiedad y de la seguridad.<br>  <br>  El juicio de amparo o juicio de garantías supone un medio de control de la constitucionalidad confiado a órganos jurisdiccionales. Trata de proteger a los individuos cuando la autoridad ha violado las garantías individuales. La figura del amparo en la vida jurídica es de gran importancia, ya que mediante la misma, como se indica en los artículos 103 y 107 de la Constitución, los particulares no quedan desamparados a merced de las autoridades, toda vez que el objeto de esta clase de juicio es resolver todas aquellas cuestiones que se susciten por leyes o actos que violen las garantías individuales; por leyes o actos de la autoridad federal que vulneren o restrinjan la soberanía de los estados; y por las leyes o actos de autoridades locales que invaden la esfera de la jurisdicción federal.<br>  <br>  9  LAS LEYES EN EL DERECHO MEXICANO <br>  <br>  En el ordenamiento jurídico mexicano existen otras normas de rango inferior respecto a la Constitución, sobre las que deben tenerse en cuenta los extremos que siguen.<br>  <br>  Los tratados internacionales que estén de acuerdo con la Constitución deberán ser celebrados por el presidente de la República con aprobación del Senado. Son de cumplimiento obligatorio en todo el país.<br>  <br>  Las leyes federales son creadas por el Congreso de la Unión, es decir, por el poder legislativo federal al objeto de que sean aplicadas en todo el territorio nacional.<br>  <br>  La ley orgánica, regla jurídica que no reglamenta o deriva de ningún artículo de la Constitución general, tiene a pesar de ello que seguir el espíritu de la misma en todas y cada una de sus disposiciones. Como ejemplo podemos citar el Código Civil o el Código de Comercio.<br>  <br>  El decreto, como acto del poder ejecutivo referido al modo de aplicación de las leyes en relación a los fines de la Administración Pública, es de igual forma la disposición de un órgano legislativo que no tiene el carácter general atribuido a las leyes.<br>  <br>  El reglamento, en cuanto es una disposición de carácter legislativo, expedida por el ejecutivo, debe aplicarse a todas las personas cuya situación quede bajo su campo de acción. El objeto de los reglamentos es facilitar el mejor cumplimiento de la ley, por lo que no pueden significarse en contra del contenido de la propia ley.<br>  <br>  Las normas jurídicas individualizadas son aquellas que se refieren a situaciones jurídicas concretas o particulares. Para algunos autores no se trata de normas jurídicas en realidad, sino de actos jurídicos regidos por normas jurídicas. Se consideran normas jurídicas individualizadas, los contratos, los testamentos, las sentencias y las resoluciones administrativas.|`|1834afc6dfcfdc19879678d9a302ddefaa	congunto de normas juridicas  que regulan a la sociedad|`|19cf127193f2b79e6f4d5cdb66ba43c6aa	Derecho: son facultades y obligaciones que debido a la propia naturaleza humana tenemos desde que nacemos o nos constituimos y aún antes de nacer (cuando estamos en periodo de gestación), las cuales el Estado las reglamenta a través de leyes.

Ante tales actos, podemos exigir que el autobús nos transporte a un lugar determinado, o que se nos deje entrar al cine para ver la película. Adquirimos la propiedad del periódico y perdemos la del dinero que hemos pagado por él. En otros casos, el alcance jurídico de los hechos es aún más claro: nos quitan la cartera y acudimos a la policía para que se inicie una actividad dirigida a descubrir al culpable y se le imponga la pena correspondiente; compramos un apartamento a plazos sabiendo que contraeremos una deuda, y que si no cumplimos con ella seremos demandados ante los tribunales.<br>  En conclusión en todos los casos expuestos podemos exigir de otros una conducta determinada, u otros nos la pueden exigir a nosotros. Pero para que esto sea posible, es preciso que exista un conjunto de normas o reglas establecidas en virtud de las cuales surja la posibilidad de poder reclamar a alquien mediante un Poder Judicial o bien de que se nos pueda reclamar por la misma via,  Si una persona puede exigir que se le entregue el periódico a cambio de su precio, es porque hay una regla o conjunto de reglas que así lo disponen, como también preceptúan que el vendedor pueda exigir el pago de la mercancía. La existencia de una regla o norma preestablecida es lo que da soporte jurídico, a todos los hechos y, de este modo nos pone en contacto con el derecho y hacen que nuestra sociedad no sea una CAOS o una anarquia.<br>  Si todos hicieramos lo que tenemos que hacer, cumplir con nuestros pagos, respetar a los vecinos, reconocer tu culpa cuando cometes una falta y repararla, etc….

6iI4xhFbaa	First, the Constitution gives the Legislative Branch control over regulating immigration.<br>  <br>  In 1864, A "Commissioner of Immigration" was created under the Secretary of State.  This person was to be appointed by the President.  It was part of the first attempt to centralize control of immigration.<br>  <br>  In 1882, an Immigration Act was passed to control immigration through state boards that operated under the Secretary of the Treasury.<br>  <br>  In 1891, the first comprehensive immigration law was passed in which the Bureau of Immigration, under the Treasury Department, was created.  Their operations would have checked immigrants in one form or another.|`|AA11702773	There was the Chinese exclusion act in 1890s, but I don't know that it took a 'department'.

lN6YpWH4aa	The federal government's authority is defined by article 1 section 8 of the constitution. Any power not granted to the feds by the constitution is reserved to the states or the people. So generally speaking the federal government has no right to interfere with our daily lives beyond the issues of taxation, interstate commerce, the military, copyright/patent law and the postal system. <br>  Also, the declaration of independence was the colonies' justification for rebellion against the British crown, it was not made into law.|`|3MM64geHaa	The constitution does not give them the right to control our lives as much as they do. They tax things that are not good for us in order to change our behaivors. They tell us we must wear seatbelts. Some want to control how much we weigh, drive, and what we set our thermostat on.  Many want to take our hard earned money and spend on things the govt has no right to interfere with. So, I guess my answer is no they do not have the right but they are growing stronger every day.|`|TT0rCi8kaa	That is, actually the function of Government, or did you not know? It says so whenever you get caught not doing what they say you got to do! What, are you six years old or something?|`|Z9jtdw17aa	I find it odd that some of the same people who say a government has no business in our daily lives supported the draft during the Viet Nam conflict and are perfectly happy to see some government official stand between a woman and her doctor in some of the most personal and painful choices she is ever going to make.  They also cheered when Terri Schiavo's husband was interdicted by CONGRESS from carrying out his wife's wishes in 2005.<br>  <br>  Situational ethics are understandable, but they cause some serious hypocrisy.<br>  <br>  The Federal Government is generally expected to promote the general welfare, protect the peace, negotiate with foreign powers, and regulate interstate commerce.  "Promoting the general welfare" can be interpreted very strictly or very generously.  The pendulum on how it is handled tends to swing back and forth.  Some administrations are very interested in things that affect and interfere with our daily lives.

u6ALw1gAaa	If the Officer perceived a possible threat.  Two men, one out of a car and another getting out of his car, in a road rage situation could be a possible threat.  People have been killed and badly injured in road rage incidents over the years.  Also people are known to carry weapons in their vehicles.  It is a huge Officer safety issue to have people getting out of their vehicles.  This was more then a stop sign incident it was a disturbance.  <br>  <br>  If you feel the Officer was out of line then your husband will have to file a complaint, not you.  You have no complaint.  My agency does not require me to even do a use of force report for drawing my weapon on someone since it is merely me preparing to use force not actually using it.  It is not considered a use of force until I actually do something more then lightly restrain someone.  If this had been my agency it would not even be considered a use of force complaint.<br>  <br>  Like Trooper I was not there and do not know everything the Officer perceived or knew but just because the Officer drew his weapon does not mean he was out of line.|`|QI74CxD0aa	It sounds like a situation in which innocent citizens can get shot by the police.    <br>  <br>  I can't imagine how that policeman in this situation could possibly think he was in danger to justify pulling a gun and pointing it at someone.  Your husband was not acting in a disorderly manner.  He honked when the other car almost hit him.   That is not illegal.|`|YbXSNgUOaa	I would think that the officer thought his life or somebodies else was in a threaten situation.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	The cop probably couldn't tell exactly what went on but because your husband was the one who honked and went, it may have looked like he was the instigator.  But the cop should have put his weapon away when he saw the children.  He should know that it is uncommon for people to commit crimes with their children in the car.  It does happen but not often.<br>  <br>  However, since the incident only produced stress, there is probably nothing you can do about it.  Crime is so rampant now and cops are in great danger every time they go out.  If he made an error, I can understand it but he should apologize to your children.|`|l9iGfpB4aa	It is not legal. You should have taken the officer's badge number and written a complaint. Now is this a racially motivated issue?  Was the person who ran the stop of another race? was the police officer of another race?  I'm just wondering... Sometimes law enforcement make assumptions.  I live in a town where the sheriff department has absolute power and that kind of thing happens a lot.|`|uIAHkm0Naa	yeah these people are pretty much right i mean cops can do pretty much whatever they want as long as they think it was "justified"..well i tell you what they can justify my white a s s !!!|`|T644csEIaa	that is definitely not legal|`|defae93221649626bf40294eaaa8ae9daa	Where was this? you didn't say. china or where??|`|cbIxKGZVaa	If you feel like the officer used excessive force file a complaint<br>  <br>  Whining about it on Yahoo Answers won't solve anything<br>  <br>  You will need to file a complaint through the shift LT and it will be handled IF your story is accurate and truthful<br>  <br>  Remembers cameras are everywhere now a days<br>  <br>  Remember the officer only has to argue that he reasonably determined a safety concern and nothing will come of it<br>  <br>  Seriously it isn't like he shot him or anything, it's okay if he wet his pants it happens|`|AA11494150	An officer can draw his gun anytime he can articulate a concern for his safety. The criteria is based on the officer's perception of the situation. As long as the perception is reasonable, it is justified. I don't know what was going through the officer's mind, so I can't say if it was reasonable. <br>  <br>  If you are not pleased, you can contact his supervisor.

That's totally different than being denied a vote.  In your case you need to hit the streets and rally around the cause of drumming up opposition.

The Illuminati and the all seeing eye never sleeps, its architects are all through the US government as well as the British Parliament.

The Conservative  worked very hard taking care of her house and her family. She was a happy little Conservative, and she sang happy songs as she did her chores.<br>         The Conservative  had three friends—a union boss, an welfare mom, and a politician—who lived very near her. Every day she watched her three friends playing, but the Conservative  didn't have time to play. She was too busy with her Babies and her house.<br>         The Conservative  started each day early in the morning. First she cooked breakfast for all her Babies. Then she made the beds and tended her garden. She cooked the meals, washed the clothes, and scrubbed the floors. She worked hard from morning till night.<br>         But her three lazy friends—the union boss, the welfare mom, and the politician—never seemed to work at all. They went for long walks in the sunshine, lay about in the soft grass, and spent their time reading stories and playing games.<br>         One sunny day the Conservative  was outside working in her garden. She was scratching around for food and found some grains of wheat where she was pulling some weeds. She noticed,<br>         "Who will plant these grains so that they will grow?" the Conservative  asked her three friends.<br>         "Not I," said the union boss.<br>         "Not I," said the welfare mom.<br>         "Not I," said the politician.<br>         "Then I will do it myself," said the Conservative .<br>         The Conservative  planted the grains of wheat. Soon the wheat grew up and became yellow and ripe. The Conservative  looked at the growing wheat and asked, "Who will help me tend this wheat?"<br>         "Not I," said the union boss.<br>         "Not I," said the welfare mom.<br>         "Not I," said the politician.<br>         "Then I will do it myself," said the Conservative  to her three friends. That was exactly what she did.<br>         The days went by, and the Conservative  worked very hard farming the wheat. She carefully planted the grains in a neat straight row and watered the field and hoed the ground and pulled the weeds. Finally the wheat was ripe and ready to be cut and harvested.<br>         The Conservative  showed her crop to her friends and asked, "Who will help me cut and thresh all of this wheat?"<br>         "Not I," said the union boss.<br>         "Not I," said the welfare mom.<br>         "Not I," said the politician.<br>         "Then I will do it myself," said the Conservative .<br>         The Conservative  worked from morning to night cutting the golden wheat with a scythe in her beak and threshing it with her wings. When she finished harvesting all of the wheat, she put the wheat carefully into her bag and loaded it onto her wagon.<br>         The Conservative  looked at the wagon filled with wheat and asked, "Who will help me take the wheat to the miller so that he can grind the wheat into flour?"<br>         "Not I," said the union boss.<br>         "Not I," said the welfare mom.<br>         "Not I," said the politician.<br>         "Then I will do it myself," said the Conservative  to her three friends.<br>         The Conservative  walked a long way into the village. She did not complain once, though the wheat was heavy while she pulled her wagon of wheat behind her.<br>         When she got to the village, she went to see the miller. "Will you grind this wheat into flour for me?" asked the Conservative .<br>         "Yes, surely," said the miller. "This wheat will make enough good flour for bread for all your Babies."<br>         The miller ground the wheat into fine flour and put it in a sack. Happily the Conservative  set out for home in her wagon, for now she had a large sack of flour to make bread.<br>         When the Conservative  came back to her house, her three lazy friends were waiting for her. She showed them the flour.<br>         "Now I shall bake some bread from the flour," said the Conservative . "Who will help me bake the bread?"<br>         "Not I," said the union boss.<br>         "Not I," said the welfare mom.<br>         "Not I," said the politician.<br>         "Then I will do it myself," said the Conservative , but she began wonder if the three of them were true friends.<br>         All the same, when the bread was baked and smelled delicious, the Conservative  asked, "Who will help me eat the fresh tasty bread?"<br>         "I will!" said the union boss.<br>         "I will!" said the welfare mom.<br>         "I will!" said the politician.<br>         They all would help her that way!<br>         "I am quite sure you would, but listen to this: I found the wheat. I planted the wheat. I tended the wheat. I harvested the wheat. I took the wheat to be ground into flour. And I made the bread.<br>         All these things I did by myself. Now my Babies and I will eat the bread all by ourselves!"<br>         And that was exactly what she did. "Cluck! Cluck!" She called her Babies to help her. They came and eagerly ate the bread with her. There was nothing left for the others.|`|d3gMoHmFaa	Bob K<br>  <br>  I think you have that backwards.

They are FAR more politically biased than CNN National.<br>  CNN National (US) has a lot of political commentary, just like most US national networks. However, CNN International doesn't have any political commentary and simply reports the news.<br>  <br>  Personally I prefer Reuters though. Reuters is the best News Network if you just want news about global events and the stock market.<br>  <br>  I'm really tired of this hyper-partisanship in the US. Liberals and Conservatives, both of them are idiots that rarely know what they're talking about. All they seem to care about are social issues like religion and abortion. George Washington once said that party factionalism will be the end of the nation. Perhaps he was some sort of prophet?<br>  <br>  Liberals and Conservatives are both idiotic and obnoxious.<br>  <br>  Edit: Lol at the idiots that think Fox isn't biased. Kids, you're delusional. All US national news networks are biased. Especially Fox and MSNBC. They're notorious around the world for being biased and often simply just outright lying for propaganda purposes.<br>  <br>  A US news network hasn't won any Journalism awards since the early 90s, and you know why? Because they're all about ratings and don't care about actual journalism anymore. That's what happens when entertainment merges with journalism.

If CNN were democratic, they wouldn't be biased, but if they are democrat, then they might. Also you don't have an example, and for people like me who don't even bother to watch CNN or FOX, then I don't have much to go on. If you're talking about Obama's preferential treatment, that's because he's being run by Soros, the Brzezinski clan and the Trilaterals, which don't have much to do with the Dumbocrats or the Repukes, actually more with the Repukes because they're more out front with fascism.|`|XsI7ISqsaa	yeah i saw them do a huge anti chavez report the other day making out hes a dictator because he won a referendum to remove term limits. they forget to mention half of europe, canada and australia dont have term limits. very pro conservative media outlet|`|EiQtzZHPaa	as a Republican i think it goes both ways,if a network that just told me the truth without political agendas were to Imerge i would jump for joy,i do not want to hear the opinions of there sponsors just the news thank you

I think all politicians server their purpose.  But not in a positive way.  They are all crooks, liars, thieves, and our dirty.  Former Governor Rod Blagojevich was one out of many people in government that should of got caught but didn't.  Arlen Specter is a conservative with liberal policies.

In case you hadn't noticed, Republicans fell out of favor, especially after the economic meltdown and of course the Bush presidency. <br>  <br>  It is theoretically possible that a very liberal Republican could have won but that person would have had to have been more liberal than the Democratic nominee, which would have been highly unlikely.|`|2f8fcc269ee1c0aaa19aed69d01a15ccaa	No he wouldn't of the media would of did the same thing they did to Sarah Palin.|`|w38AedkFaa	Obama was given a free pass by all of the media except FOX. He was never asked any hard questions and none of the media really reported anything about his past or voting record, what little there was. The Media goes all out to smear any conservative and their famlies. The Republicans were responsible for getting Obama elected by not sticking to conservative values and not putting a real conservative candidate at the top of the presidential ticket.|`|56db1a8e5fe3dfc4d4fbbbff987d0191aa	You are probably correct in some of your statement.  But, I believe he won because he was a democrat and even if he was white, he would have won with ACORN, NAACP, and those groups backing him and busing in the people to vote, and enticing them with free food to do so.  Those groups always back the democrat.  Al Gore almost made it when he ran against Bush, thankfully they did not bus enough for Gore though.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	just doing the demographics I don't think Obama would have won as a Republican<br>  <br>  BUSH legacy?<br>  terrible economy?<br>  too many reasons to mention~Change?|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	He probably still would have gotten the African American majority vote, but I'm not sure about everyone else.|`|wdBY1fWaaa	I don't know.

This is why he started pandering to the right, and picked Palin whose script was right-wing pandering.<br>  This along with negative campaigning costed them a large portion of the moderate votes.<br>  <br>  Obama ran a positive camapign for the most part. He engaged America and made them a part of his campaign. He made them feel that he was actually concerned about them as he always did with his constitutional breakfasts for his constituents.<br>  <br>  Anyone who thinks Obama won just because he was black and would have won even if he was a Republican fails to understand how politics and elections work in America.<br>  Along with the campaign situation, Bush pretty much doomed the Republicans to suffering  Democrat victory.<br>  Even Ruport Murdoch predicted a Democrat sweep in ate 2007.|`|XWQoVCXLaa	He has submitted his actual birth certificate you know. He would not be allowed to be President had he not and that is not something the government would take lightly, regardless of who the man was. And all those dark secrets you speak of did come out in the open during the election and he still won. Clinto, Bush 2 and many other Presidents had "dark secrets" that came out prior to their elections and they still got elected. People usually see past all of that. As far as him winning because he was black....I do not think so. I do agree he got quite a few votes based on the sole fact that he is black but I would assume that he lost an equal amount of voted because he was black. I think he won because he brought the message of change and people have been fed up with how our country has gone in the last 6-8 years. The financial crisis also did a big number on the Republican party. They came out with no potential solution to the problem and were also heavily responsible for turning out nice surplus into a huge deficit.|`|QCEHA6d6aa	No, I don't think people would have voted for him because of George W.

That is the only reason why people voted for Obama.<br>  <br>  The Republicans had learned from their mistake and will be waiting for their next opportunity.|`|rephaDjLaa	Of course not.<br>  <br>  President Obama was elected because he subscribes to Democratic thinking and represented an "outsider" perspective.<br>  <br>  And, no.

Their opinions might be colored by the fact that they're a male, but it seems that men are pretty equally distributed on both sides of the issue. This tells me that it has more to do with what their philosophical principals are to begin with more than it has to do with their gender. <br>  <br>  Oh, and I agree that people will always find a reason to cut you out of the debate if you're not pro-choice. They tell me I can't take part in the debate because I've never had an unplanned pregnancy. (I had a few scares and thought long and hard about my position.) Just because I use the most reliable form of birth control on the market doesn't make me unqualified to have an opinion.<br>  <br>  EDT: See what I mean?! I get a thumbs down for expressing an opinion on this subject and I'm a 24 year old female of childbearing age who was sexually active before it was a good idea to have a baby. Do you really think they'd want a MALE taking part in this debate? Not bloody likely. People just want to hear others who agree with them.

In the meantime, until they go through 9 months of pregnancy (and it's really 10) and all of the toll it takes on the body, never mind labor, I don't have the slightest interest in their view on what I should do with my body.

The stimulus package came out at midnight and they started to vote on it at 9am. Therefore, everyone who voted, did not read it as it is over 1,000 pages long.

Were you outraged then?|`|kl9tTmGLaa	Well, you can read legislation in a limited form on the Senate's website.  But he did LIE about having transparency of the White House.  I have ball gowns more transparent than he is.|`|nGoMNd7daa	YEAH!! u can't do that, its not even realistic!! hes basically saying that anyone can copy/print/paste or obtain goverment material. thats not xaclty rite. we should've voted mccain [i did] at least hes honest.|`|GvqOB5FLaa	yea welcome to politics|`|GSCD9vq3aa	When did he say that.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	We all know what he said.
hcc8fq7jaa	Sure, in the sense that he has no respect for the constitution, that he wants to consolidate power in Washington, that he's a political opportunist, and maybe even in the sense that he, too, will cause the country to be divided. Some record, huh?|`|HmvGOCyqaa	I do no think any president will go along with Lincoln. Obama will have his own stand in our history different from Lincoln, and any other president.

Probably so since they would have to send out rescuers to get you.|`|091ca1bd7e49158f5110601cac84ad3baa	NO. a mandatory evacuation just means that if you stay you are on your own and there won't be anyone around to help you if you needed help.

Your parents can get into trouble especially because you are still a minor.
9XJLlPaEaa	No, but the 3rd Amendment says that your home cannot be used to quarter soldiers.<br>  <br>  Also there is the whole due process thing that gets in the way sometimes.|`|Vu7kCPesaa	The closest thing to that would be Amendment 14 which states:<br>  <br>  "...No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall<br>  any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,<br>  without due process of law;..."<br>  <br>  People are never FORCED to leave during a natural disaster, but it is strongly suggested.|`|ODcB4zSdaa	They are not forced from their home with natural disasters. They are just strongly encouraged to leave. But on the other hand suicide is illegal.
5Ho518J9aa	Hey, Savage! Here goes: I think it will involve millions of Americans waking up to the fact that their Federal Government is so rife with corruption, that they no longer have any say whatsoever. I doubt many will realize that it is directly related to 30+ degree Freemasons called the "illuminati". These are the corruptors. Oh well.<br>  It will not look like the civil war, because the entirety of the people will be fighting in some way or another. It will be a guerrilla war, only the vast majority of the US military would never fire on the American People. The fact is, it will involve UN troops here on American soil. The biggest plus is that those blue helmets stick out like a sore thumb. I have one that I've used for target practice, they're really visible. A Japanese General was once asked why he never invaded the US, and he answered, "I would never invade the US! There would be a gun wiating for us behind every blade of grass!" Hence, why arms sales are up so high. The biggest challege would be the bickering at the Constitutional Convention, just as it was when our founders went through it.|`|028b4045d26c8c74302a643d0f4ae39daa	The next revolution will be a revolution of educated people against big government.  Where the people over throw the government from its powers and rip it apart, bringing small, centralized government back and fixing the economy in a proper way.  Instead of printing mass amounts of fiat money.  Then bailing out and stimulating people as well as large corporations and banks.  All this misappropriation of massive amounts of money being spent would be turned over, and the companies would have to either fold or use their own revenues.  The revolution might also bring about the separation of the two main political parties.  With the democrats trying to socialize everything, as the republicans try to enforce capitalism with neoconservatism.  Either way the country will be ripped down the middle like a piece of paper.  It will take allot longer to fix then previously, because the economy will be in a great depression and the people will be in an uproar.  The money won't have much value, and the markets will make the rich commit suicide and the poor once again at the bread lines.  Joyous capitalism with a socialist twist theres time to fix it.  But, will they?

KwDbR48qaa	I'll let you know right away that i am a liberal, and there are many reasons why this war was a mistake.<br>  <br>  First thing though, the freedom of the people there is a good thing, but the means we took to do it maybe was not as good. The war should not have been approached in the way it was. The low taxes we had while supporting the war was a bad idea to begin with. it was very foolish to do this. It was irresponsible and should have been handled in a more intelligent manor. <br>  <br>  Second thing, there are lots of other places in the world that need help. To run into iraq and say "Hurray, they're free" and then forget the countries that have fighting in africa or other regions of the world isn't a very good policy.<br>  <br>  The world dislikes us for many reasons and iraq is probably one of the big ones.|`|nVQqTPIFaa	It will be a mistake only if it doesn't resolve anything. Alot of countries dislike the USA because some of the governments have tried to force democracy on them. The reason Iraq was invaded is because of 911. If forces are pulled out now, then it will happen all over again. I live in Canada and I don't want it to happen again.|`|6bcLGit2aa	yes or no<br>  Iraq war is not wrong, but iraq be occupied by US is not right!<br>   What I mean we can go to iraq and remove Sadam and his gov/party power and we just leave there right away. We should not stay there  even one more day after sadam has been removed from power.<br>  Let their own people take care their own business. We just sent them the W-bill and collect money.

We egged them on, backed them up, then walkede away and denied having any part of it. Great plan, huh? Gee, I wonder how that backfired? Did you ever notice that in 1939, the Nazis held a huge rally in Madison Square Garden, but the Americans of Japanese ancestry were put into internment camps at exactly the same time that the Nazis were putting Jews and Christian dissenters into camps? Hmmm...I wonder why.....|`|lRmhwiYpaa	After 911 Saddam Hussein (who was always a thorn in the side of the US since Bush senior() <br>  <br>  No. The war in Iraq was not a mistake.  The problem is the US went into Iraq without the sanctions of the UN or a Coalition.<br>  <br>  The US could have kept sanctions on Iraq and keep them in the no<br>  fly zone forever.<br>  <br>  Haste makes waste.  The war in Iraq became our viet nam II<br>  <br>  also in Afghanistan President Obama just sent in 17,000 Surge<br>  of troops~so now this is President Obama's war instead of George<br>  W.

Our youth are being very misinformed by our liberal educational institutions.<br>  We know Iraq had weapons of mass destruction because our nation gave them to Hussein while he was fighting our war with Iran by proxy. When he chose to ethnically cleanse (fancy words for geonocide) half a million of his own countrymen, where do you think the poison gas he used came from?<br>  <br>  Those facts aside, the Iraq invasion was a UN action. Hussein refused to abide by at least 12 UN sanctions, threatened stability in the region, claimed he was aquiring nuclear weapons, and refused UN and world nuclear regulatory inspections. Not to mention he already had a history of attacking nations with oil interests 10 years prior.<br>  The invasion was warranted and justified. The people of Iraq are most definitly appreciative of our efforts there. <br>  Hussein was afterall tried and convicted of mass-murder in a court of his own country by their laws. <br>  <br>  You should do some research before offering narrow, uninformed opinions.|`|AA10187742	Get a clue about the Iraq War, or has the educational system and other venues been giving you lies also.<br>  <br>  Saddam is gone...........by the way, he did use WMD's on his own ppl, or have the books left out that fact.

IJTcGIG7aa	Definitely.<br>  <br>  Look at what our health care system has done to our manufacturing base.   It puts ANY COMPANY that wants to make something in the USA at a major disadvantage to any company building products in a place with national health care (EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE REST OF THE WORLD).<br>  <br>  This cost is absolutely unbearable to small business, especially if they only have a handful of employees (I know this FIRST HAND).   The price you pay out of pocket is astronomical and makes starting a business very tough, especially if you can't risk it (like if you have a family).   Our health care system is crippling to small businesses.<br>  <br>  It hurts big companies too.  This is what has crippled our auto companies with 3X the labor cost of its competitors.   It's health care for retirees....something that is covered by the state in Japan or Germany.<br>  <br>  But, yes, millions in America have had to file bankruptcy because they were INSURED, and the health care costs overwhelmed them.   OVER 50% of BANKRUPTCIES and many foreclosures are caused by this....it's a tragedy really.<br>  <br>  Also point out that the lack of preventative care for the uninsured results in MILLIONS of deaths.....since people can't go to the doctor (for fear of the bill) until it's too late....in the case of Cancer or stuff that could be stopped sooner.|`|AA11702773	No, since we would be carrying that cost, then, too.|`|wVik8Fo7aa	Affordable or single-payer health care would definitely aid the economic downward spiral.  A system similar to Medicare would be optimal.  Those 50 million people, who were uninsured during the Bush years of ignoring their plight, are now being joined by millions more who are losing their jobs ( medical insurance) and homes.  These unemployed will be seeking assistance from their state and local governments, who can ill-afford these extra outlays while facing a climate of uncertainty in their own budgets.  Affordable health care would indeed free employers to invest more and hire additional employees, as well.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	Most definitely.<br>  <br>  If affordable health care was available, it would lead to a big boom in the economy.|`|bTguVXMjaa	Yes, another benefit is that the average American worker would be healthier, hence less lost time from work due to illness, reduced exposure to colds and contagious diseases in the workplace, and happier, more contented employees, all contributing to greater productivity.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Whos going to PAY for it?<br>  <br>  So who are you going to ask to take a pay cut so it can be more affordable?|`|kE29abUUaa	Of course. Thinking otherwise is just naive. No one benefits from the current health care system in the US except insurance companies and the corrupt/bribed politicians that support them.<br>  <br>  The current system is a drain on the economy and is unethical in its treatment of US citizens. People in Costa Rica (3rd world nation) have a longer life expectancy than those in the US.<br>  <br>  The reason why insurance prices have risen so steeply over the past few years is because the last administration completely deregulated them so they could charge whatever they liked.|`|444pPdy5aa	nope they dont want affordable healthcare they want free healthcare. They feel they shouldnt have to pay for anything. They are black.<br>  <br>  Thats the most expensive "free" healthcare I have ever seen|`|85kWzSzuaa	No. Taxes would have to be raised to pay for "affordable health care."|`|qAL0CZIiaa	"Given"?<br>  <br>  Which magical fairy is coming to give everyone cheap health care?<br>  <br>  We can use sky money to pay for it too.|`|cO9lH8f6aa	Then the country would be bankrupt and senior care would be rationed.<br>  <br>  Bye granny.|`|6eoMqJF0aa	well considering taxes would HAVE to go up a lot  to pay for it would that take away spendable income.|`|ixOE0onnaa	yes|`|wdBY1fWaaa	Who do you think will pay for it? Yes, we will which means higher taxes. How can you not see that? Hey wow, it's just free!!!|`|BQdXnCcHaa	People cannot be "given" anything. The money has to come from somewhere, and the only place it can come from is from the people. <br>  <br>  The only way to put a cap on expenses is to either lower the standard of care or to offset the financial loss by forcing people to pay for it, even if they don't realize the benefits themselves.|`|fEyuafVNaa	Of course it would destroy the economy and the quality of medical care that Americans receive.  The American system is expensive because we use the latest technology and are at the forefront of medical advances.  If we give everyone healthcare for free, there will be no more innovation in the medical field and will lead to rationing healthcare as they do in Eurpoe.|`|4KlVkaDaaa	Probably.  One illness can empty a family's savings in a few months.  It's a glitch in the system, and it is the primary cause of personal bankruptcies.  And a guy who has to pay thousands for urgent medical care isn't going to pay his other bills if he has to choose between them.|`|AA11729751	"Given" affordable health care? Who do you think pays for all these government programs? Certainly not those who claim entitlement to them.|`|uef7Vmxkaa	Yes.  It would also let US companies compete on a level playing field with the Japaneese and Chineese companies to which we loose jobs.|`|VnxCg7iKaa	yes it would, but instead it is one more thing for chickensh*t (post 911) americans to be scared to death of|`|ZhBo2NsRaa	Who would pay for the amount that the people don't pay?

6IIErXlmaa	Exactly, people get a rush off of doing illegal things, it's the excitment of the possibility of getting caught. Killers will often purposly do things that result in them getting caught because they like to know they could get caught, as opposed to rejoicing in the fact they pulled off a perfect murder. Some sexual deviants dont really prefer child porn, but they will access it because it's highly illegal and there's a chance of getting caught. Thats the psychological aspect of it all. It's very odd but such are humans|`|e3c2ed462851c4c6d6796055b93e6970aa	There's nothing illegal that I want.|`|AA10819008	because some people get like a high off of the fear of gettin caught.<br>  sounds crazy but that's the way it is.  So if it's illegal it's the rush the excitement of possibly gettin caught or gettin away with whatever.

However, you can be deported if you were to be convicted of a crime, for example.<br>  <br>  Yes you have to pay taxes if you work in the US even if you are here illegally, and PR's have to pay.|`|a57f3452d9ef1f62cbcc55c95fd107c3aa	You do not have to become US Citizen.

Also, US Permanent Resident does not have same rights as US Citizen.|`|08d3778f46ccb1088efa36be8edafa91aa	Yes, you have to pay taxes if you have US income.<br>  You don't have to become a citizen, you can stay on your green card forever.|`|026463f641c91751757ddeacfc3bac71aa	if you don't want to become a citizen go back home.  if you do, we want you here as long as you go through the process that makes you a citizen.  how hard is that to understand?|`|f73e29492e4cdf4bf4b9851c100a1fd1aa	1 - Do you HAVE to become a citizen of the US if you move here?<br>  <br>  No.<br>  <br>  2 - For example let's say I came to this country legally and obtained a green card and I have a job and I pay my taxes <br>  <br>  That is perfectly acceptable and expected of you. However, obtaining an immigration visa in the United States will take you years. Unless you have some extra ordinary ability or in a field that is in dire need of employees, it will take you some time to obtain that type of visa. <br>  <br>  However, if you are engaged to a US Citizen, you can come on a K-1 visa as a Finance and tie the knot within 90 days and adjust to that of a Lawful Alien Permanent Resident (LAPR). However, for sole purpose of coming to the US for a sham marriage has serious consequences. And you cannot get a divorce within 2 years or you will be out of status and deportable.<br>  <br>  If you have any immediately family members, they can also petition you into the US. That is another fast route in obtaining an immigrant visa. Most non-immigrant visas do not authorize work. And the ones that do offer work expire within years and deem you inadmissible for a set period of time.<br>  <br>  3 - but I just never went through the process of becoming a citizen of the United States<br>  <br>  Actually, alot of LAPRS indeed do this. The naturalization process is old, long, confusing and sometimes costly. The US have LAPRS who never naturalized as citizens who have been LAPRS for 50, 60 and some even 70 years.<br>  <br>  As one poster mention, committing crimes will get you deported however fast, and cause you to eventually become inadmissible for entry into the US. <br>  <br>  Good luck,

Democrat Clinton had Jamie Gorelick create the wall that allowed the death of millions of Americans to stop the FBI from getting the information the CIA had about the Ryadi Family of Indonesia as well as his dealings with the Chinese gov't and selling them missle technology through Loral as well as what happened to Ron Brown, commerce secretary.  Interesting that forever classified information with military applications had to be approved for sharing through the state department then Clinton comes into office and changes this so the Commerce Secretary and decide what military secrets can be given to Communist Countries!  Amazing.  Clinton admitted that he was given Osama Bin Laden 3 times and refused to accept him even though he was in custody with the country requesting the US take him.  I don't understand why though Clinton's excuse was that he didn't know what to change him with in our Court System.  Obama is already making the same mistakes by letting Terrorists go and closing down Gitmo.  Foolish Anti-American Moves by Democrat Presidents.  What ashame.|`|AA10124897	This is old news...

While it is true that such a warning appeared in the Presidents daily briefing, it was one of nearly three thousands such warnings.  There was nothing in it to suggest when, where or how the plan would be executed.  What action could anyone have taken to stop it?<br>  <br>  Remember Jamie Gorlick?  She was the Assistant Attorney General under Janet Reno who created the "wall of separation" that prevented the CIA and FBI from sharing information.  Now, it is entirely possible that if the that wall was not in place, the threat the CIA had about airplanes and the information the FBI had about Arab student Pilots who were taking lessons on how to fly jet aircraft might have prevented it.  But event that is speculative.<br>  <br>  I wonder about the motivation for this article.

Child molestation is not a sex crime, it is a violent crime. It is no different than rape. Any person who can justify in their minds or hearts even for an instant, that violating a child's innocence is appropriate or acceptable UNDER ANY circumstances whatsoever is FAR too dangerous to be allowed to exist in society where they may have access to children ever again.<br>  <br>   If society doesn't have the stones or the stomach to simply dispose of these monsters, than I recommend a life sentence secluded from society WITHOUT the possibility of reprieve or parole, either in a prison or work camp of some kind, or some other type of installation where they can be directed to perform work that serves to benefit society in some substantial way. If it were up to me I would give them a choice if their victim survived the encounter. Their choice would be, work secluded from society in the facility of our choice, for the rest of your natural life, as long as you are healthy and fit enough to do so, OR be executed without delay. If their victim did not survive or is irreversibly physically harmed from the crime, then we simply dispose of the criminal.<br>  <br>  Why we in this society tolerate ANY degree of inhumane crime is absolutely beyond me, and what perplexes me even more, is how people can call that variety of tolerance "civilized". How some people manage to twist the whole thing around so that those seeking justice look like the barbarians, while the criminals end up looking like helpless victims, meanwhile the real victims suffer needlessly with the knowledge that no one will champion them, in addition to having just been victimized, and further agonize over who will be victimized next because of the lack of courage and principle of those in charge of establishing and maintaining the law and order of our society.

KKH9y0ECaa	I am sorry Jade has cancer, but I am as sick as everybody else of over paid celebrity nobodies many of whom have no talent and are only famous for being famous.<br>  <br>  It's not really Jade's fault and I don't blame her for trying to raise money for her children.<br>  <br>  It is the media morons and reality tv culture who seem to thrive on such idiotic publicity. I for one will not be watching Jade die on tv, and think it's time the over paid media in this country grew up.|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	No matter what your personal opinions of Jade are. She was in the public eye long before she got sick. The only reason she's still on our televisions and in all the magazines is because people are still interested in her, and a lot of people care. Jade has already made it clear that she's only allowing the media back into her private life because she wants to leave behind some money for her two boys. So she can secure them a good education and give them a better chance in life than she had. <br>  <br>  Like her or not, her reasons are very honorable this time. She doesn't have much time left in this world. We should all give her a break, and allow her to die with some dignity. You would surely want the same if she was a member of your own family. :-)|`|c9a6e2bf8a29a6984cae9499440a6756aa	I agree with you. Regardless of whether she's dying she's still an ignorant racist and her new husband is a criminal thug who beat a teenage boy with a golf club. Why on earth does she deserve such attention and praise when so many really decent and worthy people get diagnosed with terminal cancer every day?<br>  I just don't get it.<br>  Don't get me wrong, I am sorry for her and her family, the same as I would be for anyone else. But I'm not sure she deserves all this help when most people get nothing.|`|78Xb7enMaa	There is no 'fair' when it comes to terminal illness, Jade has chosen to endure her illness in public in order to earn cash to leave her sons. She has not received any preferential medical treatment and it seems as a result of the publicity more young women are going for smear tests. It's of course no less sad for each and every other person diagnosed with any terminal illness, particularly those with young children.|`|UOybpxsfaa	I am sorry to say what ever treatment she is getting the result will be the same  at least she is highlighting it and making people think|`|ef171dd047aae81269551ed2529400b7aa	Unfair, no, since she is inviting it.  I do find it to be morbid in a sense.|`|Ij02BDygaa	Yeah i think its a bit much, I feel sorry for the girl, She is young and has kids but there is people dying all the time, She is getting for example more sympathy than the 1300 gazans killed in January, But its typical of the media|`|XBYiHaWIaa	If every other person was IN THE MEDIA they would get the same attention, as they are not, they do not. That is just the way it is, Jade got lucky as she was already a celebrity, and is using it to her advantage. All celebs get special treatment, if you all want it, go out and get famous, if not, accept that you're going to be treated differently.<br>  <br>  Think about it, obviously if Jade wasn't famous none of this would be happening...who would you moan about then?|`|AA10328947	here here!!! she was just a gobby no-body from a crappy tv show, some months ago the papers were slating her , now look at em' snivelling little maggots. I wish the media and government would give ex-solders the same amount of attention.|`|Pd5PSXKUaa	it is fair but because she is a celeb she gets more attention but there are many more pple dying fro cancer alone without any1 to care for them|`|DiDCG9UBaa	no|`|NEkssyeAaa	You got a good point darlin but keep this in mind, Jade Goody is a celeb, I respect your Grandad but remember this in World War 1 there was thousands of soldiers and Jade goody is just 1 person.<br>  <br>  Media, reporters, new channels always want to get the 1st new shot on their newspaper, its money all involved at the end of the day. <br>  <br>  PUBLIC WANTS IT, MEDIA GETS IT!|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	thank you i know what you mean i have posted a question very similar and people just have a go say i don't have a heart of course i do you cant help but feel moved and shocked and upset that a 27 year old woman with 2 young kiddies will die soon, but since she has not really done much to become a celeb apart from show herself up on tv and become involved in a racist row (and no i don't think she is racist i think shilpa was as bad) but like you say why cant all cancer sufferers get the same fame fortune and money are their lives less worthless because they have not been on a reality tv show.|`|nUW4oioxaa	It would have been a lot fairer if she could raise awareness of what she is going through without the financial backing. She would probably have received a lot more respect.<br>  <br>  So she is doing it for her two boys but what use is the money when their new daddy hits someone else and ends up inside again. I feel for those children it must be really hard for them knowing that their mum is going to be departing this world. Now should be a time for them to be left to love and comfort their mum and vice versa|`|fJ7OeopSaa	Celebs have it hard, their lives being constantly watched and announced to the world. yes she was a gobby cow in big brother but now she is going through one of the most traumatic experiences a person can go through therefore she deserves the attention. And by being strong for herself, her children, her husband,etc she is an inspiration to us all.|`|UBBr2dt7aa	I kind of agree with you but in a way i disagree. I disagree because she is ill and at the end of the day they are trying to save peoples lives and it only seems like she is getting more attention because she is famous so everyone knows about it. People who aren't famous won't have everyone know will they because cancer is a common illness. In a way i agree with you because everyone goes through life with having loved ones die and other people are suffering with the same illness and they aren't getting any attention. But on the positive side at least people are getting charity money for it and its not just jade.

Those mountains are made for gorilla warfare, and the US is made for overwhelming odds on an open battlefield. What's gonna happen when we start losing six or ten times more of American blood on those mountains? In this perspective, Bush wasn't dumb enough to send our troops into those mountains where he KNEW they would get slaughtered by the hundreds. This could possibly be 'Bamas Iraq/vietnam but the liberal socialists in America will call him a "patriot" for sending our troops into a meat grinder.<br>  Sorry HumDrum, the mess is just changing neghborhoods. You see, you can change the players but you can't change the game.<br>  <br>  ask the russians if they "made it up", they left thousands of their countrymans bones in those mountains.

If they control the military and use them for things that hurt the US the Democrats won't protest.  Just look at the horrible war in Bosnia against the Serbs.  Per US records Milosovich had killed between 2,000 & 2,400 people that were against him politically.  Over 20% of his personal body guard detail were Croatian and Democrat Clinton said this was genocide and we had to go war without UN approval.  Interesting the Democrats always say we need UN approval.  Clinton doesn't get it and goes to war and Libs don't say anything.  Bush gets UN approval 14 times before going to war and the Democrats bash him for the war.  Obvious liars.  Democrat Clinton killed the Serbs for the Muslim Albanians and now the Muslim Albanians have destroyed and slaughtered all of the Christians including over 80% of all Christian churches.  Clinton once again has helped terrorism across the world giving the Muslim Extreamists another free country to opporate agains the US.  Amazing this stays under the radar by only being reported in well hidden places in the newspapers, usually on Saturdays.
QqxrVVnlaa	The left in the US seems to be a much abused term. They call liberals 'lefty's' or even commies. I think it's a reflection of how right wing mainstream US politics. The Democrat Party, and the liberals in it, are no more left wing than New Labour or the Lib Dems here in the UK. In fact, there is no way anyone could accuse the Labour Party of being on the left anymore.<br>  <br>  To me, being on the left means greater democratic control of industry by the working class. Public ownership of the means of production and greater control of the democratic process to make our representatives accountable. Better distribution of the wealth that is created by the working class and a progressive taxation system that makes people pay their fair share.<br>  <br>  However, I am far left and, while the above measures would suit me as a minimum demand, I wouldn't be completely happy until we've created a classless society based on the needs of the many, not the greed of the few.<br>  <br>  'From each according to their ability,<br>  To each according to their need'!|`|VfYvJypEaa	Liberals are not lefties , they're just misguided .

However, the Voting Rights Act and three constitutional amendments that prevent discrimination in granting the franchise have established in United States Supreme Court jurisprudence that there is a "fundamental right" in the franchise, even though voting remains a state-granted privilege. However, states are given considerable leeway when it comes to this "fundamental right".<br>  <br>  In Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000), the Supreme Court noted that, "The individual citizen has no federal constitutional right to vote for electors for the President of the United States," a logical conclusion given the history of the Electoral College. States do not have to extend suffrage to ex-felons, nor do they have to allow citizens to register and vote on Election Day.[19] In 2008, the Supreme Court upheld voter ID laws, claiming that the states had an interest in deterring voter fraud.[20]. While the Supreme Court has stated that the right to vote and the right to be a candidate are connected, they have often upheld state laws that make it difficult for independent and minor party candidates to be included on the election ballot.[21]<br>  <br>  Washington, D.C., not being a state, has been granted only limited voting rights by Congress, which controls the District "in all cases whatsoever", according to the District Clause of the Constitution.<br>  <br>  3) BO mentioned implementing mandatory community service for our young people of certain school ages, so what is your beef?<br>  <br>  4)when i worked in my high school/early college years, i was a checker/ bookkeeper at a grocery store and i saw daily when customers who recived food stamps come in and by the least expensive thing you could buy with the $1 food stamp to recieve coin change. they would buy several items using several differnt $1's to get enough change to buy beer/cigs with the cash. the 'regulars'  stopped coming to my stand, they did not like it when i tried to 'helpful' and suggest they consolidate the purchase and use a larger food stamp. also the 'regulars' would try time and again to pass expired or unauthorized(unstamped) wic vouchers.<br>  <br>  5)again, some are on assistance through no fault of their own, but there are those who do abuse the system and use their kids as a paycheck. <br>  i have an ex-brother in law who on purposely jumped off his roof and tried to break his leg because he thought if on disability he wouldn't have to pay my sister child support but still get paid. did not work.<br>  a few years later, working for one of the big 3 he'jfell' down a flight of stairs at work hoping to get BIG workers' comp from his then very wealthy employer. it worked until he bragged to the wrong friend and was found out. fine(repayment) and some  jail time for fraud.<br>  <br>  lazy(and a little crazy) for sure.|`|25Cu0kjFaa	Firstof all, go read the 13th Amendment. It specifically address some of the points you made by outlawing slavery. But, in order:<br>  <br>  1. You would force people to take a drug. What about those who have a medical condition that make Depro dangerous? what happens when a person who believes that birth control is a sin hits hard times? Sorry, the courts would through this right out. <br>  <br>  2. The right to vote is part of being a citizen, and can only be taken away by a court following a felony conviction.  Fail again.<br>  <br>  3. Again, you are treating people going through tough times as criminals. And how exactly are they supposed to learn a new trade or look for work if you are making them social pariahs?<br>  <br>  4. Alcohol and tobacco are legal. <br>  <br>  5. I'm amused at your "lazy by nature" comment. I was on public assistance due to cancer. A friend lost his job because the owner embezzled millions and fled. Neither of us is lazy by nature, we just hit a rough patch. BTW, there are rules for what you can and can't buy with Food Stamps and WIC.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but you attempt to "reform" welfare looks like just another neo-con attempt to criminalize and marginalize the poor. You'd treat poor people like criminals and deny them basic rights.<br>  <br>  Get out of my country, okay?|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	1. I agree with that one. If you can't afford a baby, don't have one. <br>  <br>  2. I don't agree. Everyone should have a right to vote. Most poor people don't vote anyway. <br>  <br>  3. I agree with the community service but NOT the orange vest that says welfare. Everyone should at least do a little bit of community service. <br>  <br>  4. I agree. <br>  <br>  5. I don't agree. They should be able to eat what they want. <br>  <br>  Not all people on welfare are parasites. Some of them just have really crappy jobs. And just because you were born into welfare that doesn;t mean you are going to be a parasite. Help the kids, but only help the parents if they are deserving.

So no one here can tell you any more other than it sounds great.  And I don't know about now, but 15 years ago, if you had a back injury you wouldn't be accepted into even the internship.

It causes permanent brain damage, ages the person using it by decades in a year and is more addictive than heroin or crack.  It has had some use when taken in small doses in pill form, but when smoked or injected it kills.  It's made from Drano, ammonia, road flares, brake fluid, and other nasty things and people put it in their veins.   The impurities in the drug come out of users skin in "bugs" which make them itchy and cause open sores and will also rot a person's teeth in just a few months.<br>  <br>  I've known addicts and I knew someone who was 7 months pregnant who had her entire bank account wiped out by her best friend addict.  Another addict stole $6000 from the company I worked for, and he was a meth head.  Addicts steal and lie and do whatever it takes to get a hit.<br>  <br>  Handy? I don't think so.<br>  <br>  As for the war on Meth, it has been kept in check by banning psuedo in the US and now most comes into the US through Mexico that has been imported from India and other countries.   Meth is not a simply drug to make like cocaine and the precursors can be eliminated by 90% easily.  There will always be meth, but it can be make much more expensive and harder to get.  One of the draws to it is it has been it is a cheap high.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.digital-immersion.net/meth/10yearsmethuse.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.digital-immersion.net/meth/10...</a><br>  <br>  Watch this frontline special on it:<br>  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/meth/view/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/...</a>|`|pRpgbuqiaa	It is not illegal enough, to put it simply. Most of the attention about crystal meth is about the users, who actually decompose from the drug in as little as three years. Very little attention is about the families and children of meth users, who often live in an extremely dangerous environment. Not only are meth users meanspirited and abusive, but they usually make the drug themselves. The drug is made with a disgusting combination of medicines and chemicals, and if it is cooked wrong it could cause an explosion. A meth user who puts his family in this kind of danger should get a much harsher sentence than what happens in the courts. Also, when a meth laboratory gets busted, street cops have to go inside a very toxic environment to investigate the scene. What are the costs of the health care of cops who have been in meth labs? It's probably in the hundreds of thousands. A meth user who cooks the drug should also be given a very harsh sentence.<br>  Lastly, meth should be considered more illegal than heroin. A person who does heroin one time has a better chance of recovery than someone who tries meth one time. <br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  I have friends who tried meth socially and they now complain that their minds have changed, and complain of having schizophrenia.|`|bjcjQ4zfaa	It shouldn't be. Meth addicts will get meth whether its legal or illegal. All prohibition does is make them criminals, and there fore waste millions of tax dollars to lock them up for a few years and spit them back out to their habits.<br>  <br>  Further more, what right does the government have to say what a person can and cannot do to their own bodies? Last time I checked the purpose of our republic was SUPPOSED to be to protect individual liberties. Guess I was wrong.|`|749a6586e68d3ab356d776176fd57b63aa	What answer would you like?<br>  pick one.<br>  A. The very chemicals to make it and refine it are lethal and combustible,even after the meth is made,the leftovers are toxic.<br>  B. At first,it enhances the mind,in focus,productivity,then it goes into a complete opposite direction.<br>              1.It re-wires the brain,adding more synapses and receptors(pleasure centers in the brain)<br>               2.This excites the brain and when the drug is gone,the brain slows down the process causing you to crash.<br>               3.This creates a false emotional base(due to the process of addiction)<br>  C.It enslaves the user,as after a while of use,your common judgment is compromised.<br>  D Once you reach this level of addiction,it is easy for people to use you,and make you do things you normally wouldn't do(for the drug)<br>  E. It destroys the world,and family around you,because the drug becomes more important than the drug itself.<br>  I could go on and on,since i was a user of meth since 1983 and finally quit in 2005 in November.It took a while to be able to feel emotions again,because Meth masks true feelings(see example #1)<br>  I was able to leave it because I was lucky and stayed in control(as a successful addict) and when you use it,as with any hard drug,there is a window of opportunity where you see your life and the raod your heading down with open eyes(a moment of clarity is what its called) once you pass that moment and you dont act,theres a good chance you'll die from use. I never got busted,had any real trouble from my abuse,until the day I chose to quit.I then seperated from my wife, lost my $950.00 a week job,and was a step away from being truely homeless.If your doing it,stop now,trust me,I'm not judging you,but I hate to see people have to go through what i have.|`|AjPbtm7oaa	It's illegal because the govt says it is.|`|epbzW5N8aa	It causes permanent damage.It is illegal because they are onlt trying to protect you against yourself.|`|4TD4xg5Xaa	Have you ever seen someone who constantly moves their lips and jaws and has black rotting teeth?

My state called 1st degree<br>  Then homicide while in a passionate state.i.e. unsuspecting husband finds wife having sex with best friend and hits the guy with a ball bat killing him. My state 2nd degree.<br>  Then what most call manslaughter, in my state 3rd degree. i.e. oops, I didn't mean to or think that tripping him on the street would kill him.<br>  <br>  rape is not murder, most places it is now called sexual assault. The name change expanded the definition greatly

The provided child care would have to be of a high quality not just a pound for kids while the parents are at work.  That if people are given jobs at private companies those companies must live up to a minimum level of workers rights and after a probationary period (say three months) that unless the work fare person is completely unfit for the job the company must hire them and if they are fired after the company must prove that there is a good reason.

Also in order to get cash assistance you need to work anywhere from 30 to 40 hrs a week in assigned work program that teaches job skills for real employment. Depending on the state this can be from 3  to 4 mos. Than recipients are required to do job hunting half of the time they would be working and listing these. There is also a 5yr CAP on Family Assistance benefits. That is if they do not get a job or learn a skill at the end of the 5 yrs they are still cut off. The only way around this is if they become disabled so they cannot not work at all. Note most, not all, disable can learn a new job skill that allows them to become self sufficient to some point but still need some assistance in food, medical or housing. As far as working as child care remember they not only need a background check but most do only earn minimum wage if they have no educational background.

I do believe in most of what you say, work for the benifits you recieve, drug testing etc. Some are on the program so they can go to school to better themselves and get a good job.  I do believe in order to qualify you should have to do SOMETHING to earn what you are getting however, not just sit around waiting for your check to come and kids to get out of school.  Even just go to school would be better.

We have millions of people from the rest of the world who try to come to The United States of America every year because we are a successful and prosperous nation and many millions of people in the world want to be part of our success and prosperity.<br>  <br>  Of course there are also those people in the world who envy us and hate us because of our success. <br>  <br>  It is too bad that there are people in the world who are so shallow as to hate us becasue of our success, however we do not lose too much sleep over that.<br>  <br>  It appears to me that you are one of those people who hates us because of our success.<br>  <br>  I will not lose any sleep because of that.<br>  <br>  Your hatred  for the United States of America is your problem, not mine.|`|YVJQ7Y4jaa	It is quite obvious that you hate the United States.

Did we have a shortage of Korean Nationals in the U.S.? How about Viet Nam?<br>  Did the U.S. have a shortage of rice? How many U.S. Military were killed in these wars? I agree with you concerning Iraq, we were there not to free the people but to secure the oil fields. I am not blaming the military, they were just doing their job. What about the Idiot Muslim factions who bomb mosques and kill innocent people? Suicide bombers? You would not have the luxury to ask these questions if Japan and Germany won the war, or if the Soviet Union attacked and beat the U.S. If you are against the U.S. save a few dollars and buy a ticket to where ever you would like to live.

There have not been a million death in Iraq since the 1980's where are you getting your facts from? There are only 27 million people in Iraq. If 1/27th of there population died we would have noticed. Nice try. distorting the facts will not help anyone. Learn both sides of the problem before putting something as stupid as this on the web. The majority of the civilians murdered were murdered by other Iraqis and foreign fighters coming to try to make a new Islamic strong hold in Iraq when the power vacuum that took place when Saddam was forced out of office. War is hell and some times people are in the wrong place at the wrong time. When crimes did take place by a very small % of the US troops, they were jailed. Good luck and never trust the government.|`|AA10783710	Far from being responsible for "crimes", our nation should be proud of how resolutely it has defended and fought for freedom.<br>  <br>  First of all, Iraq was embargoed because they refused to give up WMD's.  All they had to do was relinquish them.  They did not.  That was the decision of the Iraqi leader, who thankfully we have disposed of.<br>  <br>  The U.S. even made humanitarian provisions so the Iraqi populace would not suffer:  the oil for food program.  However, Saddam used most of this money for his own aggrandizement.  Again, not our fault.<br>  <br>  Fighting for our interests?  Oh yeah, like Bosnia is critical to us.  Somalia is like some gold mine, eh?  Grenada is our next Hawaii, I suppose?  Get real.  Stop listening to the foo-foo liberals who distort everything, and start taking pride in the U.S., the only country with the guts, the strength of will, and the resources to keep totalitarianism at bay.<br>  <br>  The U.S. does not impose its way of life on other countries.  Case in point:  Iraq.  Do you realize how exasperatingly stubborn, willful, and ungrateful the Iraqi government has been?  <br>  <br>  We gave them total freedom.  They wrote their own Constitution (we didn't like most of it), they elected their own officials, constituted their own police force, etc.  But to fulfill our mandate to keep order, we asked for some leeway because strict adherence to Iraqi law makes our job outright impossible.  They refused, saying it would impinge on their sovereignty.<br>  <br>  So keep all this in mind.  Also, I want to challenge you:  watch the video below.

We, as in the western world & not just America, are perhaps the most brainwashed of any, inducted into a consumerist fantasy world as young as possible & denied much of an outside perspective, as you can see by many answers here; what they call 'defense' others would label warmongering & this isn't including the economic tyranny America has wreaked all over either (ever wonder why desperate Muslims want to blow the West up?). This is nothing so simple as liberal/conservative, this is our-take-the money- &-run code of life. <br>  <br>  Many of us don't seem to realize the wars we step into fight on the behalf of some foreign population were caused by secret meddling in the first place, such as WW2,when  Wall street financed the German war machine, or decades later to team up with Saddam to antagonize Iran. <br>   <br>  I don't hate America. I hate the Machine that encompasses this planet & has always been the same whether capitalist or communist, grinding us up in needless warfare for money. America just happens to be the throne of the system right now,though that might change soon.<br>   ITS OUR WAY OF LIFE, NOT ANY PARTICULAR COUNTRY.<br>  <br>   There are many online resources to illustrate how this mind control takes place to disconnect the Western world from reality.

The bill provides all taxpayers with a deduction for State and local sales and excise taxes paid on the purchase of new cars, light truck, recreational vehicles, and motorcycles through 2009. This deduction is subject to a phase-out for taxpayers with adjusted gross income in excess of $125,000 ($250,000 in the case of a joint return). This proposal is estimated to cost $1.684 billion over 10 years."<br>  <br>  "Plug-in Electric Drive Vehicle Credit. The bill modifies and increases a tax credit passed into law at the end of last Congress for each qualified plug-in electric drive vehicle placed in service during the taxable year. The base amount of the credit is $2,500. If the qualified vehicle draws propulsion from a battery with at least 5 kilowatt hours of capacity, the credit is increased by $417, plus another $417 for each kilowatt hour of battery capacity in excess of 5 kilowatt hours up to 16 kilowatt hours. Taxpayers may claim the full amount of the allowable credit up to the end of the first calendar quarter in which the manufacturer records its 200,000th sale of a plug-in electric drive vehicle. The credit is reduced in following calendar quarters. The credit is allowed against the alternative minimum tax (AMT). The bill also restores and updates the electric vehicle credit for plug-in electric vehicles that would not otherwise qualify for the larger plug-in electric drive vehicle credit and provides a tax credit for plug-in electric drive conversion kits.

I would die supporting the office of the president ... notice I said the office, not the man .. and it doesn't matter who the president is, democrat or republication.  My allegiance is to the constitution of the United States and to it's people.<br>  <br>  Everyone should realize that our president can not pass a single law, he can not set the budget, he can't do very much. <br>  <br>  So everyone that complains about our last president should look to who makes the law passes the appropriations bills (that means who spends the money). It is congress.  That is who we should be looking at and whose feet we need to hold to the fire.  <br>  <br>  I'm very concerned because we have taken too many socialist steps in government.  We have nationalized our private financial sector, we have nationalized our biggest insurance company and our biggest mortgage holders.  We are well on the road to the United Socialist States of America.<br>  <br>  The free market place works. Our Congress should have left it alone.  Would the auto industry go bankrupt?  Sure. But so did the airline industry and it came out of bankruptcy.  Would a lot of people lose their jobs ... yeah, and they still are. <br>  <br>  The only thing our government knows how to do is grow government ... and they do that very, very well.<br>  <br>  Let our free market system take its lumps and it will hit bottom and start back up much faster then if government throws all this money at it because all that will do is drag out the recession.<br>  <br>  The great depression is a fine example, it would not have occurred, but for our government causing it:<br>  <br>  What Caused the Great Depression of 1929?: <br>  According to Ben Bernanke, the current Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the stock market crash and the subsequent Depression were actually caused by tight monetary policies that the Federal Reserve instituted at that time. <br>  <br>  What brought us out of the Great Depression ... World War II  Our government's "New Deal" similar to our present Federal Stimulus Package, for all its good intentions was UNSUCCESSFUL in pulling us out of the Depression.<br>  <br>  The Federal Stimulus package works out to about $1,700 for every man, woman and child in the US and it is expected to go much higher.  With our national debt at $10 Trillion that is $32,913.72 for every man, woman and child in the US.  And expected to go up.  Now take into account that when you use the population of only the working people in the US it means that each working American owes $66,401.00  ... and that does not include the 1.4 Trillion we just spent and the other Trillions we are about to spend, nor does it take into account the enormous interest payments we have to make on this debt.<br>  <br>  And, finally it does not take into account the ongoing cost of running this country each year.<br>  <br>  Yep, I'm pretty discouraged, but not our our country or our free market place .. I'm very worried about the people we keep putting in congress.<br>  <br>  I think Barack Obama is an honest, albeit left leaning man and I think George Bush was an honest man (but not the smartest) that tried his best.  The presidents are not the people that put us here, nor are they the ones that can get us out.

There is only a United States of America!" (the audacity of a man saying this on national television and using that to launch a presidential campaign while privately endorsing the exact opposite) and then left the church long ago. He isn't from a small village in Idaho. He is from the third largest city in the nation, a city of 3 million. He had numerous churches which did not have a racist at the helm to choose from. He didn't. This can only be because he either agreed with Wright's worldview or he simply doesn't have the courage, the leadership, to take a stand that would hurt him politically (Wright's standing in Chicago was a boon for Obama politically). Either way it is not what you expect from a president. <br>  <br>  so in retrospect to your questian, my answer is no hes acctualy been dooing quite the opposite of "good".<br>  <br>  another hypocrasy is him saying "change you can believe in"<br>  because hes bringing in alll of the old clintonite cabinet members, it seems Mr. Change is bringing in 4 more yrs of the last 16 yrs. what a hypocrite.|`|HDaqqS9Xaa	president is a very formal job. he should be wearing a suit and tie all the time like every other president did. just because hes black doesn't mean he has special rules. also, i think he did nothing right so far.|`|AA10187742	He should stop his campaigning and get to work.

If an officer finds you he will just do what is called a "Welfare Check", making sure you are okay and then they will take you out of the sustem.

Their website can be found here: <a href="http://www.security2020.com/security_signs_decals.htm." rel="nofollow">http://www.security2020.com/security_sig...</a>  In addition to fake security stickers, you can also buy fake security signs and even cameras. Fake signs and cameras may be more expensive, in the 20-30 dollar range, but they are proven to be much effective than just stickers. These signs and stickers are also available in both English and in Spanish.
S3ktbzDNaa	The Continental Congress was convened during the Revolution and drafted the Articles of Confederation, which governed the nation using a very weak federal Congress until the Constitution was ratified in 1781. That Congress, realizing the Articles were too weak, formed a committee to amend the Articles. That committee ignored it's original mandate and wrote an entirely new Constitution. That Constitution was ratified by votes in each of the original 13 states, which gave it the mandate of the people, and hence the authority to be the governing document of the USA.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Ag M, no silly, it wasn't pen and paper; it was quill and parchment.|`|jEqISBnQaa	Pen & paper.

When illness, fire, weather or other disaster occurred, the whole community came together and helped out. No one was denied health care due to lack of income.

A Trillion is a thousand thousand million.

Meanwhile the mortgage brokers people bought these homes through never had to worry if people could or could not afford them because they simply bundled them up in neat little packages and sold them off to foreign investors called securitization and they still got paid regardless if the people could or could not afford them or even pay for them. They had zero downside to their business. That wasn't bad enough though. Oh no.. They so utterly and absolutely destroyed the housing markets to the point that even people with sparkling credit and high incomes were put into loan arrangements that not even a Harvard Law professor could understand that secretly kept raising the mortgage payments at rates that at one time were completely illegal and it was at one time called loan sharking.<br>  Phil Graham, one of your "hero's" in the senate rushed through a little known and seldom covered deal (bill) on Christmas eve while everyone was at home celebrating that allowed Swiss banker UBS to illegally drain even more assets from our system and then allowed these billionaires to hide money in Swiss accounts where it is illegal in Switzerland to tell anyone who they are.<br>  So why should you pay?

RkfIPD7Iaa	Well sure.<br>  <br>  If a thief breaks into a home, and cuts his hand on the glass as he does so, the police can take a blood sample.<br>  <br>  If they suspect you did it, they can compare the blood sample on the glass to your blood.  If they are different types, you didn't leave the sample, this are not guilty.<br>  <br>  But many people have the same blood type, so the fact you DO match does not prove guilt.  They would need more for that (today they might do a DNA test if the crime warrants the effort), or look for other evidence linking you with the crime.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Blood testing is used to determine whether or not you are innocent or guilty of a crime|`|U3vVGSoKaa	If a woman, is attacked, and the attacker's lip is cut, and then some blood drips from the attacker's lip on to the woman, the suspect the police charge and eventually see in court will be proved innocent if there is a mismatch of blood types between what was left on the woman and the defendant's blood type. This happened at times before DNA.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, the prosecution will NOT prove guilt on the defendant if ALL they have to accuse the defendant is the same blood type, even if it is a rare blood type. The prosecution would need more "corroborating" evidence to prove the guilt of the defendant. The reason is that there are MANY, or very many, people with that same blood type as found on the woman who was attacked.  Therefore, many others running around on the streets could have been the attacker.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	If the blood type is not the defendants, he or she is eliminated.  If it matches, it is not proof of guilt because so many people have the same type.|`|VoTAmfYLaa	Watch more tv?<br>  <br>  I would guess it is more dependanet on DNA then Blood type in any case.  If the sample was not available at the time or cannot be compaired and would not be admisable then I guess that would be an example.....
l9iGfpB4aa	It depends on the state. In California it is not something you can have as an option.  It is a priviledge.  You may be eligible for house arrest depending on the crime committed,  criminal record, etc.  It is often offered by the dept. of probation and it costs! You need to first have a phone line solely for the ankle bracelet(device), pay activation and device fees, and there is a daily fee.  I knew of someone on house arrest once and it cost the family over $1,200 for 30 days, and this relative had never been in trouble.  It was for a DUI when he was a minor (alcohol level way under the legal limit, but as a minor there is a zero tolerance in Ca.) He was stopped because one of his car lights was off, he did not even commit an infraction, but  he never fully took care of and caught up with him 7 years later.

(The crazy real life chimp was shot by police.)<br>  <br>  The bill wasn't written by Barack Obama.  So, no matter what Al Sharpton says, it wasn't directed toward Obama, but Congress as a whole.

They'll need this for permanent custody.<br>  <br>  After temp custody is ordered, the court will order tests and visits for all.  They can request a guardian ad litem (a lawyer for the child) and that will help a great deal.  This lawyer only looks at what is best for the child.  <br>  <br>  Psych exams will show the maturity level of the mother and any other instabilities.  They will most likely want to observe her and then the grandparents interacting with the child.  This can be very telling.  Questions will be asked to determine how much they care for the child.  Who the doctor and dentist is? How often does she go?  When was the last visit and who took her?  Who cuts her nails?  Even small details like that can show who is really taking care of the child.<br>  <br>  For permanent custody, the judge will look at the recommendations of all who were involved.  The court has a person who interviews both too.  The people who do this for a living are very skilled at determining who is lying or telling the truth and given the age of the mother, she will not be able to get away with lying.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  The mother is lucky she has family who will care for her child. She is obviously not mature enough to have a child.  It might not be as expensive as you think.  Because the mother is 18, they will order that she pay for her own tests.  If she refuses, then she forfeits her defense.  The guardian ad litem's fees are split too.  The total cost (can vary wildly by area) can be as little as $3,000 and can go as high as $10,000.  Again, the mother's age is working FOR the grandparents.  If she was older and more stable financially, the costs could go as high as $25,000.<br>  <br>  They can always ask for payment plans too.  That is up to the people involved but it never hurts to ask.  Then I would ask all family members if they could loan some of it.  Even close friends. I would gladly pay for this if it was a friend of mine.<br>  <br>  If no help is forthcoming, have them go to Legal Aid to get a lawyer.  I doubt if the mother even fights it since she is so involved with her social life.|`|vFvI16P7aa	If it's that important to them and they really believe the child is in danger, they are going to have to "buck up" and find the money for an attorney.  They can't do it without one.  The only thing they would be able to do without an attorney is file a restraining order on behalf of the child against the mother.  If granted, it would give them VERY limited temporary custody until the full protection order court date.  Then they will need a lawyer anyway for the custody issue.  A guardian ad litem will be assigned to the child by the court to ensure the child's best interests are being looked at.  Legal Aid may be an option for a low cost attorney.|`|967aae0d16dea5cecb00409736b6dcb0aa	Like it or not, the maternal grandparents are going to have to hire an attorney and file for the custody. It is a long and hard and expensive process but it is worth it to ensure the safety of the child. <br>  <br>  My husband and I have had 2 of our youngest daughters children since they were born (10 months apart). Then their mother tried to take them with her when she moved in with this latest boyfriend 3 years after walking out of their lives. We decided to look in to him and found that he is a convicted sex offender who has to wear a G.P.S. device and an ankle monitor for the next 17 years. He had sex with a 12 year old and a 14 year old when he was 22. <br>  <br>  A second mortgage on our home and threats to her finally made her give them up but it cost us quite a bit of money. But it was worth it. We have had them all their lives, they are 41/2 and 5 1/2 now and we have severed all contact with her because she tried to sneak to court and get unsuporvised visits between the boyfriend and her children when she didn't have custody. She failed because I called his P.O. and told them she no longer has custody, but my husband and I sleep much better at night knowing the kids are safe. <br>  <br>  We have a picture of our grandson sitting on the sex offender's lap at his third birthday and if she ever tries to take them again, I will take the photot to his P.O. and have him locked up. She used to bring him over here to see the kids all the time before we found out about his being a registered convicted sex offender. We have a back up to the photo in a safe deposit box at the bank. We will do whatever is nessesary to keep these children safe. <br>  <br>  i wish you luck and will keep all of you in my prayers.

They can ask for permission, and if you consent, then all bets are off.  They can also look in the windows, and anything they see that gives rise to probable cause will allow them to arrest you and then search your vehicle under the plain view/automobile warrant exceptions, but they cannot open up your trunk.  When you are arrested in a vehicle they are limited to your "wingspan" any area that you can legitimately reach within the interior of the vehicle.<br>  <br>  You can refuse to blow.  However, they can arrest you (at least in CA they can, but I pretty sure that is a nationwide rule) for not cooperating with an officer conducting an investigation into suspicion of driving under the influence.  They can then take you to jail, and forcibly draw blood for alcohol analysis.  The thing is, that can also be to your advantage, because your BA may drop in the meantime.  There are other defense which can be utilized as well...but you can google "rising blood alcohol level" yourself to get a better grasp of these.<br>  <br>  Technically your right to remain silent does not kick in until you are under arrest and read your Miranda rights.  Staying silent during routine questioning would only prolong your stop, and may be seen as failure to cooperate with a police investigation. Therefore it is ok to answer routine questions, but always ask, that if by answering you are waiving any right to silence...<br>  <br>  one last thing....stop asking for legal advice on YA...and if you act on anything that is said here, including this advice, you are in jail out of your own stupidity|`|ODcB4zSdaa	You don't have to do anything while on the side of the road. They can search for reasonable cause. Or they can just go back to their car and get a warrant printed from the car. You can and are told to refuse by lawyers.  But they will have to take you in and give you a blood test. Often times by the time you get to the cop shop or jail which ever place they take you'll sober up plenty.  You don't have to say anything to them. You can remain silent but only problem is they will be suspicious your doing something wrong. But you don't have to do anything till they arrest you. Then you still have the right to stay silent till you talk to a lawyer.|`|uIAHkm0Naa	no they cannot search you unless you say they can or they arrest you and that takes probable cause.<br>  no you cant refuse to blow unless you want to go to jail and then they draw up paperwork to get your blood drawn to get Blood Alcohol Level.<br>  you can remain silent unless he asks you questions, but if he just asks for your license or insurance card then youre good.|`|YTG3bCeDaa	Do everything the cops says.

ZDyKFoinaa	years, there is no way to accurately judge how any one economic plan works without stepping back and looking at long term effects.  The economy goes up and down, that's a fact.  Now, when one president implements policy X they economy may go up or down that doesn't mean policy X was the catalyst.  Policy Y from the previous administration may have caused a ripple effect that caused any given drop or rise in the economy.  Its just that the media will blame it on Policy X no matter what.  generally it takes 5 to 10 years to really gauge how much good (or harm) any one policy mave have.  sorry, no instant gratification in this world.|`|AA11702773	Results?<br>  <br>  Destruction of the dollar you mean?<br>  <br>  <br>  Quite soon enough, unfortunately.|`|EJAvOHxGaa	I think you answered your on question.

AIsvSsEKaa	Fantastic question.<br>  <br>  I am a Registered Nurse. My opinion is that Health Care Funding is the single most important health issue. There is no need for a cure (of anything) if you can't pay for it.<br>  <br>  This is the only industrialized country in the world that doesn't have basic health care provided for all of its citizens. We are causing millions of people to suffer each year because we think it costs too much to pay for their health insurance. <br>  <br>  Every economist (conservative or liberal) says it is cheaper for the government to pay for basic health insurance for everyone than the current system. Today, if you are insured, you and your employer pay 3 times the value of your health care in premiums to cover the cost of uninsured patients at the local clinic or hospital.<br>  <br>  It is cheaper and healthier for everyone to have access to basic care.<br>  <br>  I have cared for countless people at the hospital who let their health go bad because they couldn't afford a doctor's visit. Then they wind up at the ER and it costs tens of thousands of dollars to care for them instead of a hundred dollars for a doctor's visit and some medicine. <br>  <br>  There is no excuse not to have a national health insurance policy. It is not communism, it's the best of democracy. Not to provide health insurance is a crime to our fellow Americans. <br>  <br>  We need to push for national health insurance now.<br>  <br>  I hope this adds to the conversation.|`|jEqISBnQaa	Define "critical attention"; it sounds like one of those Soviet-style, far-left wingnut phrases but I just want to be sure.|`|NlXdes2oaa	Ha, that is easy.  It is the health of this Nation and Obama just gave us AIDS|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Most people think Obama will give us "fee national health care".<br>  Won't happen and here is why:<br>  It has to pass congress and senate who get big campaign funds from the A.M. and the Insurance companies.Now if everyone is getting "free health care" the Government will regulate what doctors and hospitals can charge and health insurance will not be needed any longer.<br>  Many of these congressmen and senators have "blind trusts" which means they have money invested in stocks like oil, health insurance ,pharmaceuticals etc.<br>  They would lose too much money if they gave us free national health care, although it works for them just fine, they turn down many of the men and women who come back from war damaged by chemical exposures and such.<br>  I think medical care and medicine should be based on a say 10 an hr. job and frozen,then everyone could afford health insurance seeing it could be lowered to nmatch the new health care prices.Give some of the hospital ceo's a healthy pay cut to pay for it.Cover the doctor's mal practice insurance and bring it down by putting a 1 -2 million dollar cap on law suits.Also pay for their college loans and for anyone who wishes to be a doctor here in America, because they are doing a public service.

ivsKcwwvaa	Actually, this is the 2nd stimulus, along with a TARP bailout for banks and businesses last fall. Most likely a TARP 2 is coming also.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion, but I believe it probably was all conceived, years ago, then split into four parts (or more?), because of the expensive and manageability. . I find it hard to believe this all came crashing down overnight last fall. The U.S. economy is extremely massive and diverse, even a meltdown would take several years to reach down to where most of us are effected. So find it hard to believe they would not have seen it coming down from the top, several years ago.

For instance, if I remember correctly, the Nazis employed psychologists to devise procedures for exterminating people that would not weigh heavily on the executioners' consciences. The goal was to prevent their guilt from in any way inhibiting the exterminations. What they did -- and again, you'll have to check on this -- was break down the process of murdering someone into as many steps as possible to prevent any single executioner from thinking that he was the sole cause of the murder. That way, he is not responsible -- supposedly. One of Murphy's Laws is "If everyone is responsible, no one is."<br>  <br>  You might also tie this issue to the famous Milgram experiment. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_exp...</a><br>  <br>  The relevance for us today is that all human beings find the feeling of guilt unpleasant and are inclined to avoid it. An unscrupulous person will exploit this weakness. If you can find examples of how and when that occurs in modern American society, your report will offer great insight. The moral of your report, of course, is that we all have a responsibility to examine our own consciences.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  I just read that this is for your English class.

CSbSQfYHaa	Doug B makes a good point about Article 11 of the Treaty of Tripoli. The relevant line is "As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion;"<br>  <br>  To answer your question, the United States itself, as an abstraction referring to the common identity of its citizens and the principles on which it was founded, is secular. Many of its citizens happen to be Christian.<br>  <br>  I think a better question would be "SHOULD the United States be a secular or Christian country?" As much as I respect the U.S. Constitution, a document or the authority that produced it cannot decide what is right and wrong. Things are inherently right or wrong, regardless of what any document, even the Constitution, may state.<br>  <br>  In answer to that question, the United States should be a purely secular country in its civic and business activities and it should respect the right to religious expression in more private settings.|`|ilzMZNTtaa	The United States is a "Christian" nation in one sense, and in one sense only.<br>  It is certainly true that most of the Europeans who settled America in the early days were nominally Christians,   All Europeans at that time were nominally Christian, with very few exceptions.   Some of them were especially devout Christians who came to America primarily to be able to practice their version of Christianity in freedom.   The Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Plymouth Colony, and William Penn's colony are examples.   However, just as many or more early settlers came primarily to pursue wealth, to seek adventure, to have more opportunity to better their situation in life, or to escape political (not religious) persecution: the Spanish colonists, the Virginia settlers, the Georgia settlers and others.   Their Christianity played very little role in the establishment or governance of their settlements.   The Massachusetts model certainly had little influence on the later American constitution, since it was notorious for its persecution of fellow Christians whom it deemed heretical.<br>  Because many of the founding fathers were members of Christian churches, some Christians conclude that the documents they wrote establishing our system of government are "Christian," i.e., based on Christian principles.   Actually, at that time in America most of the colonies (later states) required membership in a Christian church in order to vote or hold office.   Several states even had official, "established" churches.   That is, everybody in public life was required to belong to a church.   Therefore, it is no surprise that the authors of our founding documents were nominal Christians.   It does not follow from that that the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are based on Christian principles.|`|QoTHYHfeaa	A simple answer: we are supposedly a secularized country, but really there are so many aspects of American politics that preach Christianity in some way. It is impossible for us to be a country with complete "separation of church and state" and that kind of sucks.|`|AA10742996	It depends how you define it. The majority of US citizens are christian (about 75%). So that would make it a christian country but the constitution does not establish a religion.|`|AA12117384	Although this country was established by Christians, and the majority of Americans are Christian, our governments are secular.|`|NnYHqaLuaa	It used to be a Christian country years ago.  It has become very secular today.  The country is going down the tubes.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Our country was founded on Christian principals and the Founders believed that all humans had certain God-given rights.|`|DgfEkFGLaa	Separation of Church and State protect the freedom of religion, bit the freedom of religion does not mean the complete absence of religion. So the United States is both secular and religious. Christianity was the founding fathers bases but all types of beliefs are present and practiced. Public Schools are not suppose to sponsor religious teachings yet can allow for community sponsored events which may include such teachings.|`|25Cu0kjFaa	No. The First Amendment of the Constitution guarantees the right of religious expression. The Constitution itself states that no religious test or requirement shall ever be needed for public office in the US.<br>  <br>  Shortly after we gained our independence, we signed and ratified the Treaty of Tripoli. That treaty explicitly states that the United States is in no way founded on the Christian faith.<br>  <br>  There is no state religion, and government run schools are not supposed to give religious instruction except in context as part of a history of social studies course.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Both. <br>  <br>  No, we don't have an established church, but most Americans are Protestant. We were founded on Christian Protestant fundamentals, but we wanted religious equality among all. <br>  <br>  But at the same time we are secular. We wanted a separation of church and state.|`|cae903cea51e27b7f33677a9e540a4b5aa	We are more secular then anything else, there is no established government church here in America.

1d521d1ad2fdf38cda15eff82d979ed9aa	If your child is born in the US he or she MUST have a US passport to legally leave the country. The US consulate or embassy where the father lives can probably assist in securing his permission.<br>  <br>  You should contact CIS to see about extending your visa or adjusting your status if you need to stay while that matter is worked out.<br>  <br>  If the father is not on the birth certificate or is unreachable, they do have processes to issue a passport. One thing that might happen is you go to a state court and apply for temporary sole custody of the child, for example. <br>  <br>  You should ALSO check with your own consulate or embassy to see what needs to be done to protect your child's right to citizenship in your home nation. And they may be able to help get the parental approval needed as well.<br>  <br>  Indeed, you may be required to get two passports, one from each country, to take your child home, but not all nations require their citizens have passports to enter the country.|`|T8nap2Pnaa	Immigration doesn't have anything to do with passports. that's the Department of State. I note that you only say the child's father is back home, not your husband. If the father's name is on the birth certificate, you will have problems getting a US passport, and perhaps one from your country as well, depending on where you're from. US passports for children require the signatures of both parents. Check out travel.state.gov and look in the passport section. there's a great deal of information there for you, including how to apply for the passport. Normally, the birth certificate will do, along with the application form.|`|AA10233093	Depending on your country of nationality, your child may be eligible for your citizenship. You shall contact the embassy, and they can issue him/her a passport or travel documents to go back to your home country.<br>  <br>  A child born in the USA is also a USA citizen by birth, so you can apply for a USA passport. It may not be easy to do if his/her child is not in the USA with you. Are you married to the child's father?<br>  <br>  If plan to go to your home country, a passport or travel document for your home country is required.|`|NFG9zF4zaa	If you have the baby here than he/she will be a US citizen and you apply for a passport here.

YsUnEnYqaa	It depends on the contract they hold. Embassy protection is severely mandated by the Department of State to the point that no additional accessories, besides their own, may be added to the weapon's they provide to the company.<br>  <br>  In the early days of Iraq (2003/2004/2005) it was not uncommon to see dudes in all different companies carrying whatever they could find off the black market, outfitted with whatever tactical accessories they could buy online. I've seen guys with FNFAL's, Sten SMG's, MP5's, AK's, 1911's, HK-91's, RPG's, M4's, Vietnam era M16A1's, you name it, it was here .... For awhile it was the wild west.... But only because things were that bad around here, you see, no one cares about rules when everyone's getting blown away day to day. As long as the contracts were being fulfilled, the second guessing and micromanagement tended to stay hidden within the large military bases. With stability comes supervision, and oversight. So you see much more weapons regulation these days as Iraq becomes more and more stable.<br>  <br>  These days, everything is very uniformed and contractually decided. The most common are M4's and Glock 9mm variants. Smaller companies with local nationals tend to have more AK/RPK/PKM variants due to the low costs. Though on certain other contracts in the Afghanistan AO that are VERY remote, it really can be and has been what you find, can acquire, with little limitations on what you can add to them out of your own pocket.<br>  <br>  However, at no time have you been able to bring your daddy's shotgun INTO the theater. Everything you use is either issued by the company, or was (and in remote places still is) bought through contacts on the local black markets. With the Soviet Union falling apart in the 80's and 90's, they sold tons of munitions out to anyone who could buy them. Nevertheless there was an endless supply of whatever you might have been looking for if you knew where to look.|`|5PIgZ7tFaa	Blackwater has changed its name.

Good luck...|`|kb6f3Sdkaa	As a court bailiff, I can tell you with certainty that a wrong address will not be grounds for a dismissal of the charge.  The law - and almost every Judge I know - allows for what are called "Scribner's' errors" on misdemeanor citations (i.e. color of a vehicle, relevant weather conditions, etc.).  Best advice: present yourself professionally at court;<br>  plead not guilty, waive your speedy trial rights and request a pretrial with the prosecutor.

DxqhcUvWaa	While it is legal for any person in the church to be the treasurer, it is best that the pastor, associate pastor and family members stay away from the cash.<br>  <br>  Jesus gave the example.

If there is an issue involving the handling of the funds and the pastor or associate pastor are handling them then this will be a stain on their character which could lead to a big church fight.<br>  <br>  Also, the pastor and associate pastor should not know who is giving what amounts.  This may influence how they treat a person who gives a large sum to the church.  <br>  <br>  For instance Brother Smith may give a large sum to the church and Pastor Jones knows it, but then Brother Smith is taken up in adultery so Pastor Jones overlooks it for fear of losing Brother Smith's donations.<br>  <br>  Pastor and Associate need to give themselves to the actual ministry of preaching, teaching and praying.|`|N7G26k4Iaa	Why wouldn't it be?|`|TuCKAbPTaa	Yes.

E3yUGPQZaa	The Reagan administration was responsible for deregulating many industries in the early 1980s, including the airlines and banking.  The thought behind that move was that private industry would be able to regulate itself.  Whichever companies failed, that would be fine because there was a "survival of the fittest" mentality and a position that less government was best for all.  However, the absence of adequate regulation in the banking and financial services businesses has proven to be a disaster, as evidenced by the current mortgage crisis and dismal economic climate.    Left to their own devices, banks developed difficult-to-understand financial tools and pushed them on an ill-informed public.  These include such products as derivatives.  It's clear that substantially more regulation is necessary.  However, in the shorter-term, the banks are on the verge of going under.  Citi is nearly worthless at about $2 and change per share.  Yet, the same management teams who were responsible for the crisis are still at the helm.  As a result, it is necessary for the U.S. government to bail out the banks with billions of dollars just to keep them afloat.  However, the congressional Finance Committee chaired by Senator Frank, intend to hold their feet to the fire when it comes to requiring the banks to lend out some of that money to the public to help get the economy moving again.  To date, the banks have been hoarding the funds already lent out by the federal government, which is further stagnating the economy.  As long as the government is lending out billions of dollars to the banks to keep them afloat, then it is up to the government to do its due diligence to make sure that the banks are actually making loans with the money.|`|4d5669748fdad422cfff157e567591a8aa	Socialization.

Now under a new Democratic regime we are yet again bailing these people out and those who have been paying their share on a regular basis get screwed over and the tax payers take the bill.

NppYevk3aa	I'm not really a Democrat or Republican, but I do think this stimulus will help.  Right now there are states that really need a boost, and there are some that don't.  Any governor that would choose political ideals over the welfare of the state they govern doesn't deserve the privilege to lead.  <br>  <br>  We elect our leaders to aid us, and to ensure our governments run smoothly.  Without a leader willing to aid the people, even through such risks as this in trying times, more people will suffer.<br>  <br>  Personally I think its time to stop looking at Republican/Democrat and face the cold hard truth...we are all citizens of the United States, and the only way we can make it through this is together.  As the old saying goes..."united we stand, divided we fall."|`|lyhnHhuWaa	If I could choose the political affiliation/leanings of my governor, s/he would be a Libertarian.

Shout real loud to drown out the facts. Been in the playbook for years.|`|wdBY1fWaaa	It's true. This is why Obama is NOT bipartisan at all. Any disagreement with the stimulus bill and you are just an obstructionist.

People don't see to get the joke when i say I'm a hero,laying down my life(by smoking) to give children endless health care through the taxes i pay on cigarettes.I went through this when i lived in California when it became a state law,now its a federal law.I wish they would tax jogging.My bst argument then was,I used to ride a bike 10 miles each way to get to work.I did this for about 5-6 years and I would quit when they stopped driving their cars.|`|X9VDzvo4aa	I made the choice to smoke and i've made the choice not to quit.

kin81CoZaa	I live in Louisiana also an i agree with what Jindal is doing, he has worked really hard to try an turn Louisiana around for the better in my opinion he has been our best governor yet. Besides if he takes the money he will be with the many governors who will be controlled by the strings of Obama|`|9temsB8haa	It makes sense when you consider the massive financial impact the change in their laws would have on the state in the long term. If the feds gave the money to run the existing program under existing laws that would be different. We keep getting in deeper by using temporary funds to start permanent entitlements|`|HfPT0nSsaa	They are right to do it and I hope more follow. Obama is stepping over to many lines and trying to redraw them. I also hope some of the states pass their bills declaring sovereignty.|`|AA11729751	The stimulus money is for bastions of progressivity and liberalism like California.... you know, places where arrogance and decadence reign supreme amidst bankrupt state governments and superior intellect.|`|D9l4HLKKaa	Thats good that money is POISON and EVIL.<br>  We can never pay it back you don't borrow what you cannot ever pay back.|`|ivsKcwwvaa	Agree with the Governors in principle.  Problem is, they still get the debt portion. Let them keep the debt, they can have the stimulus<br>  <br>  Hey, they have been stealing money for years from hard working Americans at gunpoint. Take whatever you can get. And nothing hypocritical about it. Democrats have voted against 1000's of appropriation bills, then took the money when it passed. They are way ahead in that game.  .|`|sfC6L8ybaa	The state governors (La., Miss., S.C., etc) who reject the Fed. unemployment funds and maybe other portions of the Stimulus Funds seem too tied to ideology.  If they do this rejection plus brag a lot about that, they probably will be repudiated and rejected by most working people in the next elections.|`|32zBW5uCaa	Hooray for those governors!  Obama, Pelosi, Reid, Kennedy, and others are trying to take complete control of this country.  By taking the stimulus package, governors who take it are giving up their states' sovereignty to the Feds.  Hello Communism.|`|OIQvZ87gaa	I agree, nice to see someone using his brain for a change. The money sucking politicians will spend what they get and MORE if they have a chance.|`|AA10719402	Jindall basically denied unemployment funds for his constituents.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but Louisiana is one the worst states I've ever been to.  Bad infrastructure, unintelligent people, antiquated culture.....<br>  <br>  I went to a Tool concert there years ago and a politician was campaigning in the entrance line.  WTF?  A Republican trying to get Tool fan votes.<br>  <br>  __<br>  What that says about a state is something that should be looked at.  Why is a state run predominantly by Republicans full of people who live off of benefits?  Why is nothing done about their awful education system or is the culture unable to make a turnaround?  <br>  <br>  Texas (yes.. from Texas) does have it's share of deadbeats, but we are also a damn good state.  There are jobs and opportunities and I don't see why Louisiana is so different.  They have the potential to be a gulf port money.  The mouth of the Mississippi... all kinds of things that could make it great.. but it's awful.|`|spuz7DvNaa	I agree with them. They are looking out for the future of their citizens and know the fine print in this porkulus bill will put a payback burden on their citizens for years to come. Conservatives think about where this money is coming from. They know their children, grandchildren and great grandchildren will be paying for this one. Most liberals abort their children or in in homosexual relationships that can produce no children so they do not give a sh*t.<br>  <br>  Liberals are always looking for someone else to carry their weight and care little that it will take generations to pay off this debt.<br>  <br>  Louisiana has been run by Democrats and has been one of the most corrupt states in America and because it was run by Democrats the citizens have the "government will take care of me syndrome". They have become so dependent they couldn't get two people together to help themselves during Katrina. Instead they stood there in squalor waiting for someone to wipe their ****.<br>  <br>  Jindal is trying to raise the people up to be strong and self sufficient..........................Oh wait a minute! If they are self sufficient they cannot be controlled (and that is the fine print in the porkulus bill)!

iaugc41aaa	Despite what Charles M may think, you are unable to call a barrister direct in this situation.  You should, however, go to see a solicitor NOW.  The reason for this is that some time will be required to get statements together for your case and to give ou either the best defence or the best plea in mitigation that is available to you.<br>  <br>  This will not be done if you simply turn up on the day and hope that the duty solicitor can help.<br>  <br>  And it will definitely not be done if you try to handle the case yourself.<br>  <br>  Have a read of the leaflet (link below), which will tell you what you need to know and how to find a solicitor.|`|CBmizuGwaa	...protect yourself... call the Barrister

84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	GOOD question. <br>  It's so irritating to see how some poor people keep on having kids. I can just look at them and think "Why are you having so many children?" 1 kid is enough if you are poor, but having more is too much. <br>  <br>  My mom complains about how many kids she wants... She is going through menopause so don't worry; she can't have anymore... and I'm like "Mom, you can't afford anymore kids." <br>  <br>  For me, it would be a nightmare having to be on welfare with 2 or more kids. I have too much pride for that crap, but I'm in college now and I've always been a good student. <br>  <br>  I just think it's mean to have kids if you are poor, forcing the kids to live like that.|`|0f0dac4f4bfb6a4b2d01df90fd84b3ffaa	Actually, poverty doesn't cause people to have children. People will have children whether they are rich or poor, a better indicator is whether you live in the city or the country. The more rural your environment, the more space you have and the more children you eventually have. <br>  <br>  And interestingly, it wasn't long ago that having children would make you money because they could put to work on the farm and would support you when you got old. This has been the pattern of civilization up until the industrial revolution.<br>  <br>  If you want to ask a deeper question, you might ask why people who oppose welfare also oppose abortion and often times comprehensive sex education. It is like they want people to have more children whether they can afford them or not.<br>  <br>  Edit: As for the people who say more children nets you more money, you will never get back a fraction of the welfare money that it actually costs to even feed a child much less raise him. Nobody ever says in a modern society that I'm going to have more children so I can get more welfare money. I has never happened.|`|7fgATXX2aa	Amen man and how many taxpayers could see there money actually helping the matter if it wasn't being handed out to irresponsible, irrational people!?|`|Yx1kEsCHaa	More food stamps.|`|CDe5bEA6aa	I have never fathered a child.

7ONKVbbiaa	any person recieving food stamps must apply and include the amount of assets they have. <br>  Since none of the procedures were paid for by the state, it would seem clear that she failed to declare money that she had. In my opinion, it is likely that she has already commited welfare fraud. Contrary to her thinking.. food stamps are a form of welfare. <br>  I am not sure that there are laws relating to in vitro procedures..since it has to be assumed that persons using in vitro are unable to have children. It would really be unconstitutional to prohibit someone from medical services relating to the choice of having children. <br>  Once those children ARE born.. then the state has the option to investigate any person who appears to be incapable to provide for them, or whose mental state is judged detrimental to their well being. <br>  I'd say she fits the last statement, 100 times over.|`|99Znmg81aa	Are you sure there are laws about how many eggs can be implanted?

If she is unable to care for them, she could wind up facing child neglect charges or something like that.<br>  <br>  It's possible that she has committed disability fraud, if she collected money for disability while not really being that disabled (and getting implanted and carrying those fetuses around suggests that she wasn't all that disabled).|`|58pYf74Vaa	Being DUMB without a license.<br>  <br>  Operating a kennel without a permit.
bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	Louisiana Purchase (French: Vente de la Louisiane "Louisiana Sale") was the acquisition by the United States of America of 828,800 square miles (2,147,000 km2) of the French territory Louisiane in 1803. The U.S. paid 60 million francs ($11,250,000) plus cancellation of debts worth 18 million francs ($3,750,000), a total cost of $15,000,000 for the Louisiana territory<br>  The Louisiana Purchase encompassed portions of 14 current U.S. states and 2 Canadian Provinces. The land purchased contained all of present-day Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, parts of Minnesota that were west of the Mississippi River, most of North Dakota, nearly all of South Dakota, northeastern New Mexico, the portions of Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado east of the Continental Divide, and Louisiana west of the Mississippi River, including the city of New Orleans. (The Oklahoma Panhandle, and southwestern portions of Kansas and Louisiana were still claimed by Spain at the time of the Purchase.) In addition, the Purchase contained small portions of land that would eventually become part of the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The land included in the purchase comprises around 23% of the territory of the United States today.<br>  The purchase was a vital moment in the presidency of Thomas Jefferson. At the time, it faced domestic opposition as being possibly unconstitutional. Although he felt that the US Constitution did not contain any provisions for acquiring territory, Jefferson decided to purchase Louisiana because he felt uneasy about France and Spain having the power to block American trade access to the port of New Orleans.|`|AA11702773	No, but I think he should have had the Constitution amended to permit the one time purchase. It was a great deal, but he should have done it properly.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Are you kidding????

However, in the real world, she would have a very difficult time proving that she didn't intend to kill. <br>  <br>  3. Again, this one is not any of the choices on your list. This would be a case of collateral damage. The security guard wasn't aiming to kill the customer, and was acting within the realms of his duties in protecting the bank and it's employees and customers...he apparently just is not a very good shot. He would likely be put on probation while an investigation played out, but ultimately would not be held responsible, except, likely, by himself. The DA may decide to charge the robber, however, with felony murder. A felony murder is when a death results during the commission of a felony crime.  <br>  <br>  Now, in the third case, say the guard does nothing, but sees the robber the next day in traffic and tries to shoot her but kills her passenger instead. This would be second degree murder. He is not acting on the threat of imminent danger, he has no legal right to shoot his weapon. It isn't premeditated, isn't in the heat of passion, and it is intentional.
55NKPb82aa	No you, your ex, and the family courts have to decide the visitation situation and child support|`|7ONKVbbiaa	No, it is not true at all. <br>  Support and vistitation are ALWAYS separate. <br>  the reason (among others) is to insure that visitation and contact with a child is not "for sale". You cannot buy it by paying support. You cannot withhold it for lack of support. <br>  Be very careful.. persons who will not support children, and make threats are almost always into control issues, which is a form of abuse.|`|Lj2quNrpaa	Child support is a decision of the court, and so is rulings on visiting times for your ex, so there is no way that just by him starting to pay child support he will get to see the child. Child Support must be mandated by the court, and it does not guarantee visitation, which is also determined by a ruling of the court. Now if your ex was to bring the case into court and seek joint custody, and was awarded it, then he would be able to see your child... but by the way you say he behaves, I highly doubt that would happen.
aNDxKN2zaa	OK, Im going to try this one. A noise complaint to the police means somebody complained. Their opinion doesn't matter if they think the party or the get together is too loud. They really don't care, because they just want to solve the problem. They don't respond to loud parties/noise unless somebody calls. If it was a call then they came. Maybe your neighbor works in the morning or maybe they are just a complainer. Non-the less any noise that disturbs somebodies peace can be a complaint. Next, Yes if there is a violation (the noise complaint) they can investigate, which gives them the right to enter your yard to investigate. A noise complaint actually is a crime but 99% of the time the cops realize that it can be solved with the noise level dropping so that's what they tried in your case. As for the complaint on your neighbors what were they doing at the time that you could complain on? It is not a crime to call the police, unless you make a false report of something or mis use the 911 system. As for the ID. All police officers know that they can be Identified because the cal is logged by dispatch, and all who responded. If you were a bit uncooperative by the Can I complain on my neighbor and some other things that may have happened then they made you have to take another step to get their name. There is no complaint you have with the cops doing their job. If you think about it, you know they don't want to be there, but that is what they do. <br>     I had a situation like this in my own neighborhood. I solved it by becoming friends with the old lady that complained, and invited her to a few functions. She actually showed up to one and we never had another complaint from her. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|HfPT0nSsaa	They are supposed to provide ID when asked. About coming onto your property, I am not sure about that. And where you work has absolutely nothing to do with anything and should not have been brought up.|`|9ib0tC9Waa	The police cannot enter your property without your permission or a warrant, and have to provide ID when they are asked for it.|`|t7NZwptEaa	Yes the police had a report of loud noise so they had to investigate it's there duty so they had the right to come into your backyard.|`|cts6S8vRaa	No.No.Yes.Yes.Report the police officers.|`|epbzW5N8aa	The police were on your side until you got an attitude, they just wanted to find out if you were a respectable employed citizen giving a respectable party without any shady people with  gun ( for the officers safety). Yes they can go any where there is a complaint besides they are just doing  a job, why make the officers job harder cause you and your neighbor have issues. Were they not wearing a uniform. Kill your neighbors with kindness offer them a plate explain to them you will be having a function give them your phone and tell them if it gets loud to call.
