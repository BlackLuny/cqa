Ny5pH9fBaa	La verdad puede depender mucho de donde vivas. Si vives en el DF, es más fácil, ya que en el centro hay muchas tiendas que se dedican especialmente a eso. Si vives en provincia, talvez si tengas un poco mas de problemas, ya que no se produce ni se compra tanto como en el DF. Talvez una buena opción sea comprarla por internet.

Pero si quieres seguir compitiendo pues no importa que tu entrenador no te anime hace te vos misma las ganas todo esta en la mente, no te bloquees!<br>  <br>  A mi no me gusta la natación como competencia porque es un deporte muy estresante el peso de las derrotas la llevas solo en tus hombros y no me gusta mucho eso...

Ademas tu sabes cual es la causa de tu bajo rendimiento. Tu puedes ponerle solución, solo debes volver a entrenarte con la misma fuerza e ilusión que antes. Si antes eras mejor que tus rivales con un poquito de esfuerzo y dedicación, todo volvera a la normalidad. Creo que debes encontrar tu motivación en volver a superar a tus amigas y en ser la mejor, marcate un registro al que quieras llegar y lucha por conseguirlo, esa e la mejor motivación. No te preocupes si al principio tus amigas siguen ganandote, tu objetivo es a largo plazo. Asi que animo, si llevas 10 a?os en la natación, será porque realmente es un deporte que te gusta, yo creo que debes seguir en el, además piensa que lo más importante en el deporte es participar, a veces ser el número uno es imposible, y no porque no seas la mejor, sino porque el día importante tienes un mal día.<br>  Animo, espero que sigas con la natación.<br>  Ya nos contaras|`|44701a4066818112dee679c77d356dfaaa	No lo dejes, tirarias todo el trabajo que primero has invertido.<br>  Esfuerzate como si te fuera la vida en ello, entrena más hasta que no puedas más. Acabaras siendo mejor que antes, y eso te hará sentirte mejor. <br>  Si te compadeces de ti por haber bajado el rendimiento y por no ser tan buena, y no haces nada al respecto, no te sentiras llena. Para ser la mejor hay qe dar la vida, y luego te sentiras super orgullosa de haberlo logrado.<br>  No hay mejor cosa que ser el mejor en algo por tus propios méritos, y por tu propio esfuerzo. Es la mejor sensacion del mundo, por lo menos para mí.|`|4yRSZym8aa	si te gusta ese deporte debes continuar , quizás es que llevas tanto tiempo que sientes que necesitas un descanso.

Pero si tu hablas de natación de competición, todo depende de tu disciplina, si quieres conseguir ganar a tus amigas, tienes que trabajar duro y con constancia. Mi consejo personal es que no lo dejes nunca, mantén un nivel, aunque sea bajo. Digo esto porque yo lo abandoné y al regresar me sentía pesado y no era capaz de hacer nada...  No pierdas tu nivel e intenta mejorar, no vayas a reducir  tu salud por una "derrota" con tus amigas.

Por otro lado su practica requiere una gran predispocision fisica por parte del practicante.<br>  El Tae Kwon Do (camino del pu?o y la patada) es un arte marcial completamente moderno, oriundo de Corea como disiplina de guerra para sus soldados. Es un ejercicio mas bien de orden aerobico y deportivo.<br>  El Taekwondo se dividio en dos grandes asociaciones, ITF (international taekwondo federation) y WTF (world taekwondo federation).<br>  ITF conserva el aspecto marcial, original, mientras que WTF se volvio deportivo, es disiplina olimpica, incluyo en su practica protectores y las reglas de competicion varian en algunos aspectos de ITF (en ITF se pueden dar golpes de pu?o a la cabeza mientras que en WTF no esta permitido, aun asi WTF usa protectores de cabeza e ITF no. Parece una contradiccion, pero va de la mano con el hecho de que WTF es un deporte e ITF es un arte de guerra).<br>  De todas formas, ambas ramas son un arte marcial de defenza y ataque, y muy eficaces las dos.<br>  <br>  Espero haberte sido de ayuda.<br>  Saludos.<br>  <br>  <br>  ROGELIO:  Creo que me esforce en contestar lo mejor posible para que quien pregunto tenga la data que necesita.

De hecho, cuando lo termino de desarrollar y le di el nombre que hoy tiene ya era el a?o 1955 y el Taekwondo ya estaba instaurado en todo el cuerpo militar y gran parte de la poblacion.<br>  Yo nunca dije que hoy en dia sea el arte marcial de las Fuerzas Armadas de Corea del Sur, hable de sus origenes.<br>  El Hapkido fue adoptado por los militares entre la decada del 70′ y 80′.<br>  Perdon por haber sido poco claro.|`|ZDIEwOaMaa	para mi taekwondo es mejor porqe sirve como defensa personal,,,|`|fPXgUaWSaa	el que esta escribiendo arriba te dio informacion erronea...el taekwondo no es un arte marcial de los militares coreanos...enrealidad el arte marcial militar coreano es el hapkido|`|tSRB1r6Waa	Yo hago Taekwondo el lunes ante-pasado me quebre la mu?eca, yo te rrecomiendo, para defenderte la capoeira, para hacer ejercicio ,taekwondo.|`|wBBeiy5Caa	taekwondo|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Capoeira|`|66b07220f1c9f6963d24debbf47c7ed8aa	Son dos cosas totalmente distintas..de origines distintos...yo te aconsejo a q busques mas info sobre las dos (por internet podrás conseguir facilmente) y estando interiorizado podrás decidirlo.<br>  Q alguién te aconseje entre los dos no te ayudará mucho pq sos vos el q lo va a practicar.

The Lakers have too much talent in the west, and the Celtics are still better then Cleveland.  The playoff series last year between Cle and Bos was misleading.  The Celtics were still finding their playoff legs, which is way a team like Atlanta was able to stretch them to seven games.

Ese emblema tricolor nació bajo la República de Weimar (1919-1933), que quería hacer olvidar el eterno blanco del Imperio, responsable de la Primera Guerra Mundial.<br>  <br>  Pero la 'Mannschaft' prefirió no vestir los tres colores de la humillación y juega de blanco, con pantaloncito ***** con el águila del Kaiser Guillermo II (de Prusia).<br>  <br>  Tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial, la camiseta blanca permitió salir del pozo a los alemanes, que ganaron el Mundial-1954 en Suiza frente al superfavorito Hungría (3-2 en final). Exito gracias al cual "se puede estar otra vez orgulloso de ser alemán", según el seleccionador de ese entonces, Josef Herberger.<br>  <br>  Italia viste de azul y blanco, sin dar noticias del verde y rojo de su bandera. La 'Squadra Azzurra' utiliza, de hecho, los colores de la Casa de Saboya, la de Victor Emmanuel, el rey de la unificación de la Península. El reino de Italia se proclamó en 1861.<br>  <br>  Por las mismas razones reales, Holanda usa el naranja y no el rojo-blanco-azul, en referencia a la dinastía de Guillermo de Orange-Nassau que gobierna las Provincias Unidas en su apogeo. Guillermo II de Nassau proclama su independencia en 1648, acto de nacimiento de la Holanda moderna.<br>  <br>  Croacia con su cuadriculada parece haber tallado su túnica nacional sólo tomando en cuenta una parte de su escudo, en el centro de la bandera (bandas rojas, blancas, azules de arriba a abajo). En los cuadrados rojos y blancos figuran las 25 peque?as provincias que componen Hrvatska, Croacia.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Para no confundirse con otros equipos.<br>  Saludos!!!|`|prIyHO6Paa	Es ética profesional, en ningún reglamento especifica que tu uniforme deba tener los colores de la bandera. ellos sí saben de dise?o y prefirieron ese azul desde sus inicios. Llevan su bandera en las mangas discretamente. Además para qué embarrar los colores nacionales?<br>  <br>  ?Y porqué si la nuestra es verde blanco y rojo nunca se han puesto la camiceta roja?  es solo tradición, pero podrían. por ahí usaron alguna vez una guinda que nada qué ver.
SDHvDNGJaa	Si, estan protestando contra el gobierno Chino, por la ocupación que mantiene desde 1950 en el Tibet.|`|WM5Vw9o9aa	Por que china quiere eliminar el tibet y sus creencias y los que apoyan a los tibetanos utilizan el motivo de los olimpicos para que se escuchen aun mas sus protestas|`|AmdIkAkXaa	e l tibet  era o pertenecía a un área  independiente de china ,  osea que eran algo así como  un país independiente<br>   y como ya respondieron antes  en la década de los 50′s o finales de los 40′s el gobierno chino  entro al tibet y forzó a la gente con violencia a aceptar el dominio de   china  sobre sus territorios  y así ahí seguido por décadas y  los tibetanos que  no se sienten  para nada chinos  pues quieren ser independientes y que se respeten sus creencias  y su territorio  y   se manifiestan con mas fuerza durante las vísperas de los juegos olímpicos porque saben que  el mundo tiene los ojos en china   en estos   días|`|DbAMVQdiaa	^^<br>  es porque china quiere ocupar el tibet.... y lo estan haciendo con violencia... no se cuantos muertos hay...<br>  asi q por eso protestan!!!<br>  <br>  byeee|`|fYhrU9yKaa	es manifestacion para que devuelvan el Tiben que saquearon y robaron alos tibetanos para expulsarlos ahora, es para que China devuelva su pais a quienes pertenece, Fuera los chinos del Tibet!|`|wuVsvuG3aa	China ocupa el tibet desde los a?os 50 y ellos protestan porque quieren independizarse, quieren se un territorio que tenga su gobierno propio,  pero china ha respondido con represion a las protestas de los tibetanos y es por eso que se han dado las protestas a nivel mundial, el fuego olimpico va directo a china, y es una forma de molestar al gobierno, varios paises han declarado no asistir a la inaguracion e incluso boicotear la inaguracion de los juegos si china sigue con la represion hacia el tibet.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mira, wikipedia lo dice asi:<br>  Con ocasión de los Juegos Olímpicos de Beijing que se llevarán a cabo en agosto del 2008, ha habido una serie de manifestaciones de gente a favor de la liberación de la ocupación y dominio de China hacia el Tíbet. Se ha aprovechado el escenario del viaje de la antorcha olímpica en diversas ciudades del mundo para expresar la ironía de que los juegos de la Paz están siendo organizados por un país que mantiene una ocupación militar en esta región desde hace a?os. Las manifestaciones se originaron desde la ceremonia de encendido de la antorcha, en Grecia, Londres, París, San Francisco, entre otras. La cantante Bj?rk ha expresado su apoyo a la causa, mediante la difusión de un tema apoyando la independencia del Tíbet.<br>  <br>  China, durante las protestas de los tibetanos, expulsó a los medios de comunicación internacionales del Tíbet, con intención de proteger su seguridad, lo que levanta sospechas, entre algunos medios, sobre el grado de represión llevado a cabo por el ejército chino. El partido Comunista chino dijo que "aplacaría" a los manifestantes y envió cerca de seis mil militares a la zona. Las últimas imágenes de televisión mostraban tanques entrando en Lhasa, la capital del Tíbet.|`|aVCHU2p8aa	Se debe a que los juegos se realizarán en CHINA, y en este pais existe una región llamada TIBET, pero que CHINA no reconoce como independiente. Habitantes del TIBET querrían independizarse y ser un país autonomo separado de CHINA con su propio gobierno, CHINA le quito todos los privilegios a la clase gobernante del TIBET . SImplemente ellos quieren recuperar el poder sobre esas tierras. Es una protesta contra el gobierno Chino. En aquella época la mayoría de los tibetanos vivían bajo un régimen de servidumbre por cuanto la mayor parte de la tierra era poseída por los lamas.<br>  <br>  Todo comenzó aquí :<br>  <br>  -En el siglo XIII el Tíbet fue dominado por el Imperio Mongol. <br>  -En el siglo XVI Altan Khan de la tribu mongol de Turnet le dio respaldo al gobierno religioso del Dalai Lama.<br>  -Al principio del siglo XVIII China se hace cargo del gobierno encontrando resistencia, el ejército Qing (imperial chino) invadió el Tíbet .<br>  -En 1904 los británicos enviaron un contingente militar y ocuparon Lhasa.<br>  -En 1907 se firmó un nuevo tratado entre Gran Breta?a, China y Rusia donde se le daba a China la soberanía sobre el Tíbet. <br>  -En 1914 se negoció un tratado entre China, Tíbet y Gran Breta?a.<br>  -Durante la Primera Guerra Mundial el decimotercer Dalai Lama tomó el gobierno del Tíbet .<br>  -En 1950 el ejército ocupó el Tíbet.<br>  <br>  China llama a Tibet " Región Autónoma del Tíbet " ya que los responsables principales de las asambleas que administra la región deben de ser miembros de la etnia tibetana.

No dudo que tenga talento en la direccion tecnica pero le falta mucha experiencia y tiene que tomarla en otros equipos, ya no estamos para experimentos.

vU5u1ecwaa	Estoy de acuerdo contigo, pero ya ves, como siempre en lugar de llegar mas y buscar hacer mas goles para estar tranquilos, se pusieron como a cascarear y al final ya no le dieron mucha importancia.<br>  Aunque cabe mencionar que si te fijas, como desde el minuto 25 de la primera parte, los chinos solamente se dedicaron a defender, formaron 2 bloques de 4 en la defensa, dejando solo a 2 adelante, y eso fue lo que le dio menos chance al tri, aparte los chinos tenían mucha más conidición física, sobre todo estatura...<br>  Pero no hay excusa, los traian comiendo de la mano y en lugar de golearlos se conformaron con 1 golecito...<br>  Qué lástima, porque la verdad México fue muy superior a los chinos, y de alguna forma había que recompensar a la afición, sobre todo por los recientes fracasos y por tantos mexicanos que asistieron al estadio (creo que eran poco mas de 54.000 mexicanos, en un estadio con cupo para 56.000 personas).<br>  Saludos.|`|2291b6771599b18dd689dbf36fb19b5faa	lo que pasa es que esos chamacos estan muy inflados, el unico que jugo fue Sinha<br>  <br>  <br>  "ES UN ORGULLO SER DE CORAZON AZUL Y PIEL DORADA"|`|Pw0vJNAvaa	De nada sirve el "JogoBonito" sin goles, por eso Portugal no ha ganado una sola Copa y en cambio Italia lleva 4.............y antes de que me lo digan, Brasil se cocina aparte.........|`|euAXhg5Gaa	ah blah lo mismo no saben concretar una jugada medio aburrido el juego villaluz corre y corre y nada...pero bueno no es la seleccion grande vamos tan siquiera gano|`|PMzevn4gaa	La verdad que si estubo muy aburrido yo esperaba mas de Mexico los de China no sabian ni que onda pero bueno espero que Mexico se ponga las pilas.|`|QRqBYKVTaa	pss si,empexo bienn chido y derrepente esta mas entretenido oir a la comentraristas/|`|Rd3CUHPFaa	la neta la neta sigue en las mismas|`|WIEkadKGaa	totalmente de acuerdo con Germanico<br>  <br>  dale los 10 si no por su respuesta, por su avatar jajajaj|`|l0ATNLxzaa	Boriiinggggg|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Si, muy aburrido, aunque ganaron 1-0.|`|cd0d98a509d556360adc2acc7ff385dfaa	pos si, ese villaluz es una mi,- er,- da,- fue uno de los inches inflados que no metieron gol en el ultimo partido de hugo, eso es para que vean que los inches jugadores son los que tienen la culpa de remover a un tecnico en cualquier equipo, y eso es mala leche aqui y en europa, den gracias a dios que los chinos no saben jugar, si no a ver que decian, es que tienen poco, o cualquier otra pandejada, para justificarse,,,digo,,,
PksYAruIaa	Hola mira depende si te dedicas de lleno  a la natacion la desventaja es que se te hace una espladota sobre todo si haces mucha mariposa pero es lo unico .<br>  Ventajas ufff muchisimas como ya lo han comentado <br>  El busto es mas firme si practicas mucho dorso.<br>  Esto es en cuanto al cuerpo de la mujer pero es un excelente deporte, a mi me encanta es el que practica toda mi fam.|`|dbMEpT8gaa	Ventajas muchas y ya te las dijeron.<br>  <br>  Desventajas, pues si prcaticas mucha natación la desventaja es estética pues se hace una espalda ancha.<br>  Has visto a las nadadoras profesionales????? estéticamente se ven clago anchas y con pocos senos pues tanto ejercicio en la parte superior elimina casi toda la grasa. Los senos están hechos en su mayor parte por grasa ,así que los disminuyen.<br>  <br>  Si practicas natación de forma regular no le veo problema, pero si lo haces de forma muy constante esa es la desventaja que veo.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	No le veo desventajas<br>  solo ventajas<br>  condición física, entrenamiento de todo tu cuerpo, no hay desgaste de rodillas, es genial!|`|a909db40e6cd3a8b6477d9590759107daa	La natación es quizás el mejor deporte, tanto para la mujer como para el hombre, en todas las etapas de su vida.<br>  Practicado como medio de conservación y desarrollo físico, posee innumerables ventajas, entre ellas:<br>  Desarrollo armónico de la musculatura, sin llegar a ser exagerados.<br>  Desarrollo y mejoramiento de los sistemas: Cardiopulmonar, esquelético, muscular, circulatorio, etc.<br>  Mejora la concentración cerebral, se adquiere ritmo, sincronización física, estabilidad, equilibrio y destreza.<br>  Y lo que es más obvio: Aprendes a nadar y como evitar morir ahogado.<br>  Si estas pasada de kilogramos, puedes bajar unos cuantos.<br>  Si eres delgada en extremo, a?adirás volúmen corporal.<br>  Como dije al principio, practicado en forma de conservación y desarrollo, no provoca deformaciones corporales, como la tan temida (por las damas) ensanche de espalda y/o reducción del busto.<br>  Desventajas: Realmente no sé si existe alguna.|`|c0ef004bf5749d4c8c100ab9791ea114aa	Todos los deportes aportan beneficios sobre la salud, siempre y cuando se practiquen de forma adecuada. Sin embargo, la natación tiene unas características especiales que no poseen otros tipos de ejercicios aeróbicos. Algunos de estos beneficios son:<br>  <br>  Aporta una increíble resistencia cardiopulmonar. <br>  Estimula la circulación sanguínea. <br>  Ayuda a mantener una presión arterial estable. <br>  Reduce el riesgo de enfermedades cardiovasculares. <br>  Desarrollo de la mayor parte de grupos musculares (más de dos tercios de todos los músculos de nuestro cuerpo). <br>  Fortalece los tejidos articulares previniendo posibles lesiones. <br>  Facilita la eliminación de secreciones bronquiales. <br>  Mejora la postura corporal. <br>  Desarrolla la flexibilidad. <br>  Alivia tensiones. <br>  Genera estados de ánimo positivos. <br>  Ayuda a mejorar estados de ansiedad y aliviar síntomas de depresión. <br>  Relaja la excesiva tonicidad muscular de la tarea diaria. <br>  Estimula el crecimiento y el desarrollo físico-psíquico. <br>  Mejora el desarrollo psicomotor. <br>  Favorece la autoestima. <br>  <br>  y desventajas NINGUNA.<br>  <br>  SALUDOS.|`|jF5cIZjyaa	desventajas ninguna<br>  <br>  ventajas todas<br>  <br>  mejor cuerpo<br>  mas espalda<br>  mas energía<br>  mejor figura<br>  todas las q s t ocurran|`|otlaFLDNaa	tendrás mejor circulacion, pero tu cuerpo se adaptara a su medio, espalda ancha,pies planos etc.|`|9talKuAOaa	pues para una mujer los beneficios de la natación son que fortaleces y tonificas tus piernas y brazos también depende de la frecuencia de tu nado y si es muy frecuente es muy probable que se te ensanche la espalda y eso no es muy bonito bueno suerte ciao|`|lHNQrbBjaa	la desventaja es que no resiste mucho y la ventaja es que si te da un calambre "tus cosillas" te hacen flotar

WT8CbURxaa	Just to clarify, the Thunder have multiple first round picks this year.  The one they traded to the Bulls is the lower of the picks the Thunder have owed from the Nuggets or Spurs.<br>  <br>  Basically whichever of the two picks is lower (as in closer to the 2nd round), the Bulls get.<br>  <br>  Also, it has happened before.<br>  <br>  In 1983, the Rockets drafted Ralph Sampson #1, then in 1984, they drafted Hakeem Olajuwon #1.<br>  <br>  It also happened 1963 & 1964 with the Knicks when they drafted Art Heyman & Jim Barnes though at that time, there were only something like 7 teams in the league.<br>  <br>  It may have happened other times as well.|`|LhwhAoSmaa	The Thunder still have their pick for 2009. I don't know what trade you're talking about. Even if there was a trade, that pick was probably lottery protected|`|DDDfv5O9aa	No.|`|qtwYHyH5aa	ye|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	i really dont know but i will guess yes????????|`|tzrLDbHWaa	It has been done. The last time the same team had #1 picks in consecutive years, the Orlando Magic took Shaq and C-Webb, but traded C-Webb for Penny, so the 2 #1 never played together.<br>  <br>  In 1984 the Rockets drafted Hakeem Olajuwon #1 overall, and he played alongside 83 #1 overall pick Ralph Sampson.<br>  <br>  In 1964 the Knicks took Jim Barnes #1 to go with previous year's #1 Art Heymon, but neither were all that great.<br>  <br>  In 1960 the Cincinnati Royals (now the Sacramento Kings) took hall of famer Oscar Robertson and had Bob Boozer the season before.  In fact, Robertson was their 3rd #1 overall pick in 4 seasons.<br>  <br>  In 1954 the Baltimore Bullets (now defunct) took Frank Selvy #1 to go with previous years #1 and ROY Ray Felix<br>  <br>  And finally, in 1949 the Providence Steamrollers (now defunct) took Howie Shannon and had Andy Tonkovich the previous year.<br>  <br>  As a note, never have 2 players drafted #1 to the same team in back to back seasons both been rookie of the year or both turned into hall of famers.  The most success overall would be with the Rockets when they took ROY Sampson and future hall of famer Olajuwon.

Esta palabra se suele emplear despectivamente para referirse a algo o alguien que difiere cultural o socialmente de un determinado grupo, el cual más comúnmente es la clase alta, debido a su frecuencia de uso. El término ya está reconocido por la RAE. Se trata de un sustantivo, aunque en ocasiones se emplea como adjetivo pese a que en principio no lo sea. El término, en ocasiones, por la tendencia actual a emplearlo de manera despectiva y arbitraria, ha sido considerado racista, discriminatorio y algunas veces socialmente diseminatorio.<br>  <br>  ejemplos: FRASES: <br>  <br>  ?Súbete pa arriba, bájate pa abajo y lueguito salte pa fuera! <br>  <br>   <br>  Está muy fuerte la calor<br>   <br>  ?Qué pasotes con esos zapatotes?<br>   <br>  ?Cómo estanques?<br>  <br>  ?Qué hongo, jorongo, tepetongo, morongo?<br>   <br>  ?Vientos huracanados del norte y del sur con tendencias a la baja según lo programado por los meteorólogos y Tucson Arizona, cómo has Estados Unidos?<br>   <br>  ?Chido, Liro, Ramiro y el vampiro, Clodomiro!<br>   <br>  ?Asústame pantera!<br>  <br>  ?Me la rifé!<br>   <br>  Soy el ?ay nanita!<br>  <br>  ?Voy a sacarle el cacahuate a la pi?ata!<br>   <br>  ?Voy a liberar a Willy!<br>   <br>  ?Orinita vengo, voy a su ranchito!<br>   <br>  ?Este osito de peluche ya se va para su estuche!<br>  <br>  ?Este mu?eco cambia de aparador!<br>   <br>  ?Sereno, moreno!<br>   <br>  ?Calmantes montes!<br>  <br>  ?Estás bien Marmaduc!<br>   <br>  ?Ni Pepsi, dijo la Coca!<br>  <br>  ?Ya estufas!<br>  <br>  ?De que marca son tus chirrios?<br>   <br>  Esto está bien "cul"<br>   <br>  ?Cámara guey!<br>   <br>  ?Bájale la espuma a tu chocolate!<br>   <br>  ?Qué transita por tus venas valedor?<br>   <br>  Orillese a la orilla <br>   <br>  Siga avanzando hacia adelante <br>  <br>  Yo pensé que te habías morongas<br>   <br>  ?A lo que te truje Chencha!<br>   <br>  ?Ni maíz palomas!<br>   <br>  Es mi "bro"<br>  Como dice "la" Caty* [O SEA, anteponer "la", "él" a las personas ("él" Carlos de Jesús, La Thalía, El Luismi, La Pau), frase dedicada a un filosofo-novelista-sicoloco-naco de nombre Zolnak]<br>   <br>  Ya llegó por quien lloraban<br>   <br>  Qué pex<br>   <br>  Un resto<br>   <br>  ?Te cae?<br>   <br>  Está chin#$%$&!<br>   <br>  Arriba los Pumas*, América, Chivas*, etc., frase seguida de ca#$%&()=?

KMk4nuFeaa	thats a nice lineup. i wouldnt call that team a championship contender.. more of a legit playoff contender.. but if they had that team it would take a few years but they would probably be more dominant then the team they have now in about 2010 or 2011|`|21J0IIZbaa	The Celtics would of been good but not a championship team.|`|DmuGQuwuaa	i Would Say No Because Rondo Big Baby And Powe Wouldn't grow up. Perkins Would be the same person, AL would never be the player he is now, Durant Would Take To many Shots, and Pierce, Well, you Know,<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope i Helped Peace!|`|a6a555da6f939b85469e3c83f71c0ecaaa	No<br>  Clearly Allen and KG were the keys to winning. Pierce had already been there and demonstrated that he could not get them over the hump.  Perkins is not really an NBA center, the presence of KG makes him better.  Durant was not a given.  While he has played sound, he did struggle in year one and this year he has broken out, but usually in a loosing effort.  Finally, Pierce would not have sacrificed some of his game for a rookie (Durant) and the Rondo/Durant combination would not have been good for either of thier development.  So they would have been just as bad.|`|c767faeb6ae25829f84d589c038c29b0aa	The trades happened because they never got the 1st or 2nd pick. They wanted Oden or Durrant & if they didn't get one of those two Pierce was going to seriously consider going somewhere else. So that option was never on the table. But if it was & they did get Durrant, i think they'd be good. I don't think they would've gotten past the Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals last year though with that lineup.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	First answerer is confused。 He didn't say “better” or as good。He only said good。|`|0ytjj1EGaa	They would be A Contender But Not Champ<br>  <br>  They would Be Champs in 2013|`|gM0pk41jaa	Simple answer.....the ONLY reason they became so good was because they picked up Allen and Garnett....No way in hell the celtics would have had so much success without those two. So id have to say no....Durant is a good player but he wouldn't have helped the celtics get where they are now from where they wrre following their losing season cuz of his lack of experience vs Garnett and Allens veteran influence|`|2VVgxFDKaa	they never had the 2nd pick and u cant do things based on "if's"  They had the 5th pick and thats why they traded because if they won the lottery or got the 2nd pick then they would have never received Ray Allen or Kevin Garnett.  And Delonte West wouldnt still be there and neither would Wally cause that was a completely different trade.|`|qqkz7FSfaa	No definetely not. the great thing about the celtics is you KNOW that 1 of the big three will have a big night. without garnett and allen you pretty much put the team on pierce's shoulders and we all know that doesnt work. Plus i think Durant is still too yound to lead a team.|`|LLEhUtxXaa	I think they'd be a good team. not quite a championship contender.<br>  <br>  If they still had Walter McCarty they'd be a championship contender though|`|1lMFj7pCaa	championship contender? are u serious?? no offense, but durant and pierce can never take a team into the finals... maybe 4-6th seed at best|`|z4Vpi48Raa	no they wouldnt be as good as they are now|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Heck no! They would be terrible!|`|qM9tSVd8aa	no|`|AOLo6OG1aa	yeah still would be good. but no veteran leadership. they would just take bad shots in crunch time and not play the defense that they are known for now.|`|JgAE7eV9aa	They would suck and not be a lakers killer

mMFJrPbvaa	Yea I would go with the Convertible (Zip-off) pants, this way you have shorts and Pants.  I know Ex-Officio has an Amphibious Pair, they dry super quick, are extremely light and have a mesh liner like a bathing suit, so you wouldn't need underwear under them either.  But EMS, Campmor, REI, pretty much any major outdoor retailer will have their makes of the Convertible pants.|`|SBBnWsJJaa	Several companies (Columbia, REI, etc.) make lightweight nylon pants that have zip off legs (to make shorts).

I believe that this is our year. unlike last year he didn't win the important games but this season we swept both the celtics and cavs. Kobe's going for another shot at a title!|`|21J0IIZbaa	The Lakers will win the Title.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	I don't think so but you still have some chances|`|kFcdwVwdaa	hell yeah. games like that prepare you the playoffs. people talk about why cant the Lakers beat the sorry teams, well what challenge do you have if you cant come back against anyone? its ok to be down, as long as you got that W at the end. what is the difference between winning a game by 1 or by 40? it still counts only as one Win. <br>  besides these games help out making the bench stronger.|`|qM9tSVd8aa	yea when lakers can sweep the best two defense teams and score a hundred points in 4 of the games the sweept both of the teams|`|0ytjj1EGaa	U R RIGHT<br>  <br>  <br>  U Must Be Blind If U dont See That|`|38634d724472d6d2e903c2fa2cae8951aa	Celtics will repeat as champs again. I only hope the Lakers get to the finals so that we can beat them one more time. There's just no way LA can take the C's in a 7 game series. <br>  <br>  Just because LA won 2 very close games this regular season doesn't mean anything. <br>  <br>  Besides the game @ Boston had KG playing with the flu and some of the worst officiating I've ever witnessed.|`|Kw3dWcptaa	I truely believe this is the lakers year I mean they have dominated almost every team in the nba to this point and Kobe is totally focused at bringing the trophy home.  The only thing is like they always say, the regular season doesnt matter when playoffs roll around and I am really hoping that the injury to Bynum doesnt affect him and the team down the road in a late playoff push.|`|gM0pk41jaa	I think so. It will be a tough road just like last year but i think they can pull it off. This seems to be their year but we have to remember its the playoffs that count so everything the Lakers are doing now won't even matter if they don't do it in the playoffs. And Bynum making a successful return will also be quite the factor as they need his inside presence.|`|6iTfLffIaa	nope the cleveland cavaliers will be the 2008 -09 NBA champs and lebron james will be named MVP|`|9IqUpCqgaa	100% yes. Enough Said|`|z4Vpi48Raa	no
qYgSPRbqaa	Im not sure but it sounds like this guy is right.  Marquez is an average player surrounded by World Class players, its unfortunate Americans can talk so much crap though, if we could ever beat them that would change.  Unfortuantely American players are better than our Mexican players right now and don't ride the bench like our players.  I heard 3 of our European players are all getting shipped back to FMF, sad day in Mexican soccer...again|`|195d481e791fe6dd37323b342df9fa94aa	none in reality<br>  donovans loan is over if not mistaken<br>  villarreal is also in the knockout round but altidore is on a loan to a second division team from spain.<br>  <br>  on the other hand we got 3 players in the uefa cup <br>  gooch<br>  guzan<br>  friedel <br>  that i am aware of.|`|qbPbvLuLaa	NONE|`|0eAUeyU2aa	Freddy Adu - AS Monaco<br>  DeMarcus Beasley  - Rangers<br>  Landon Donovan - Bayern Munich<br>  Brad Friedel - Aston Villa<br>  Tim Howard - Everton<br>  These are only the players, who play for the most known teams, there are lot more playing in norway, sweden and denmark|`|LWXC05Xnaa	Why are you so hateful, and why are you deliberately causing trouble in a section where you know Americans' hang out?

I just thumbed through one a few days ago and saw exactly what you are looking for.  I goes all the way back to the beginning of professional basketball.
vJyF8siJaa	Yes, If Lamar continues to play like this lamar is a legit candidate for nba all 3rd-team. He just help the Lakers since Drew went down with an injury.<br>  <br>  It depends if Lamar will start next season which I think no because Drew will be back at starting C and Pau at PF, LO will be sixthman again. what i'm looking forward to is seeing LO win the sixthman of the year award maybe next year.<br>  <br>  Lamar has been stepping up for the Lakers it's good to see, LO beat the wolves for us last time! woo!|`|AA11488609	only if he were starting the whole year.  It's a shame he didn't even make the All Star team yet..  If the Wizards traded for him instead of Butler, he could've been an All-NBA player for sure, much less All Star.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	He is playing well, but not even close to the level of the All-NBA Third Team. At SF there is Lebron, Pierce, Durant, and Granger. Odom does not deserve to be in the conversation with any of those guys yet. At PF there is Bosh, Nowitzki, Gasol, and Duncan, so I can't see any way Odom sneaks into the conversation with any of these guys. Even 18 Pts 14 Rbs will not get him there due to his poor start.<br>  <br>  All star reserve definitely with those #s though.|`|2VVgxFDKaa	nope.  because u look at who else there is that will make 3rd team at the PF or SF positions.  I am a LAkers fan but Odom will not make 3rd team no matter what.<br>  <br>  PF<br>  Duncan<br>  Garnet<br>  Bosh/Stoudemire<br>  <br>  SF<br>  LeBron<br>  Melo<br>  Durant|`|geL6jbdpaa	hey he helped us lakers sweep the celtics and the cavs this year so when bynum gets back they need to put odom in the line up again|`|0ytjj1EGaa	YES<br>  <br>  and <br>  <br>  YES<br>  <br>  <br>  He is one of the best not playing in ALL STAR Game  And i think he DESERVES TO BE AN ALL-STAR<br>  <br>  <br>  And He is doing great too|`|gM0pk41jaa	The simple answer is NOOOOO. He has alot of talent and ptential and easily COULD but he DOESN'T. For some very odd reason he does not utilize his skills and talent to his best potential. He's too inconsistent so this is why he will never earn any significant honors in the league such as making the NBA Third Team or an All-Star reserve. There are way too may better power forwards in the west(Tim Duncan, Dirk Noowitzki, Amare Stoudemire, and even his own teammate Pau Gasol would get the notch b4 odom. ALSO dont forget theres a new kid in the league doing big things right now. His name is Kevin Durant and he will most likely make the all-star next year so Lamar odom has no shot as a reserve for the small forward.But if the lakers continue to do as good as they are and Odom picks up some of the slack then maybe he will earn a lil more respect from his fellow peers and fans|`|ed937ded1f7d65f1c6eb94572e6afdd8aa	To be a member of the third team, he'd have to have the numbers of an impact of a bench player such as Kevin McHale (can't believe I just gave a Celtic a prop! GULP!).<br>  But as a starter, I thought there were several seasons in the past where he deserved at least an All Star nod. I don't see him getting an All Star bid or an All NBA Team appearance unless he goes to another team and becomes "the" man.|`|4Cxys1P7aa	Yes he will. Odom is a quit star on the up rise that does not get the credit he deserve. Outstanding underrated and consistent player.|`|mC8nFYozaa	No and no. As long as Gasol and Bynum are on the same team he'll be just a top 5 bench player in the league.|`|JgAE7eV9aa	I think he does which makes the fu**ing lakers even betters.|`|GjJmNOg1aa	No plus he cant shoot freethrows|`|c9PHwfVMaa	ever heard of Jason Terry?|`|f3DYQgzUaa	yeah if he keeps up his form
ys3DHzDuaa	Without a doubt, you go with Mike Richards.<br>  <br>  IMO, he's a better player in comparison to Ribeiro.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, Richards has better offensive linemates in Gagne and Knuble, as opposed to Ribeiro with Ott and Lehtinen.<br>  <br>  Dallas is dealing with major injuries to top stars as well.<br>  <br>  And the schedule favors PHI as Theo still lets goals in in WAS, LA is always playing in a shootout, MON is just spiraling down hill and the Devs have been lit up by several teams that they were expected to beat.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	Richards!! Better and hotter (in a non gay way)|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Richards is a better player.  I have no clue about fantasy sports.  I know that Richards is a solid two-way player.|`|lYnkvRASaa	Richards is the better bet, He is better and more consistent.

Jordan took a pay cut to have scottie pippen on his team, which would eventually result in him getting more money through shoes and indorcements.

LeBron is still incredible though|`|quCfpWM7aa	Anybody can disagree and im sure many will but i would have to pick Lebron James only because the man is not only taller at 6'8" but he his 250  pounds of muscle with 5% body fat.

Nuj1eScCaa	Well, I'm a Pistons fan and I hated the Billups trade from day 1. I was ranting and raving about it on here lol. I knew that once we traded him, it was the beginning of the end for the current Pistons team. I never lost faith in billups, in fact I thought he was going to have a great year which he is.<br>  <br>  Come this summer, there are going to be more changes and a different era will start, hopefully. Because the way they are playing is not the way the Piston organization prides itself in playing. Michael Curry may end up fired because even though I know it takes time to gel with a team, he shows no ability to discipline his players and hold them accountable for how they play and finish games.|`|f931be7e45f5d51817c8a31a462b08d4aa	Billups got the better of the trade.  He has boosted Denver's playoff run, and is laughing all the way to the locker room.  Iverson (corn rows or no corn rows) is already not happy in Detriot, and it will only get worse.  I wonder how long Rasheed Wallace plans to hang around now that he becomes a free agent at the end of this season?  Hmmmm......|`|1TfxGkVJaa	Pistons are going down hill.|`|vdh6cwUvaa	Well, I think our coach doesn't know how to exactly use a PG with a completely different style, it's like Dallas last year with Kidd, Avery controls too much from Kidd, he needs to let them play more. But right now, we need to fired Michael Curry and hire Avery Johnson because we have no discipline, Avery knows just that.<br>  <br>  I know we're gonna take a step back, if we don't trade someone in the future, we're gonna start to decline, so I'd rather see a sudden decline then bounce right back than a slow death.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Not a Pistons fan either, but I think it was an awful trade, just awful.  Not only is Billups outscoring and outshooting Iverson but he's helping his team win games.<br>  <br>  Before the trade I would have said I thought Iverson was a better scorer and a more explosive player, and I still wouldn't have made the trade if I were Detroit.  AI is nothing more than a point guard who is too selfish to run an offense and therefore chooses to play an undersized 2 guard so he can shoot.  Billups is a true PG who can score AND lead an offense.<br>  <br>  By bringing in AI, since you can't put him at his natural position (he was a PG in college and coming into the NBA), you're stuck with him as the 2 and Rip Hamilton as the 6th man.  I don't care how much you love AI, Billups and Rip is a better combo than Stuckey and AI with Rip on the bench.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	I am not Pistons fan but I think Iverson ruined everything for Pistons. But Billups won the deal he doing good with Nuggets

zg1lIy7Oaa	LA Lakers defeated Boston Celtics twice this season and in their last meeting, even without center Andrew Bynum, the Los Angeles Lakers knocked off the Boston Celtics in overtime 110-109.<br>  <br>  It might be just a meaningless game in February, but it helps Los Angeles erase the sour taste that has haunted them since last June’s 131-92 beatdown in Boston.<br>  <br>  The thing is that, it is just the regular season and we can't forget the fact that Boston Celtics are the current NBA Champions. We can't underestimate the heart of the Champions... and we can't underestimate King LeBron James too...|`|2Xx0Cm2Caa	They are the two best teams by far!  They both still want it but the only difference this year is that I think the Lakers are so dissappointed about last years loss that its going to push them over the top and get them a title through Boston.<br>  <br>  Once Bynum comes back it's over again for the rest of the teams in the NBA!!  They couldn't be stopped before Bynums injury and they still can't be stopped... just wait!  When he gets back they're going to make a historic run through the playoffs and win a title.<br>  <br>  Go Lakers!<br>  <br>  The Cavs are overrated... they won't make it to the finals... just wait and see they'll lose again either in the conference finals to the Celtics or before the conference finals... I speak the truth! haha|`|gM0pk41jaa	That would be something to see but i dont think  the celtics defense would allow 160 lol but either way i want the lakers to come back and pounce whoever they play. If the playoffs began today id say very well it be these two teams again...and hopefully bynum will be back to make a difference. But don't count out the cavs just y et cuz king james is jus as determined to get back to the finals and WIN just as much as anyone else and he's proven to be quite unstoppable this year and as much as id hate to witness it....the spurs might even make a push in the west. ANyway it goes its gonna be an intense playoffs come April....and its gonna be exciting to watch....i cannot wait!!!!|`|vFthoB6Haa	they are at the top right now but they better watch out...the spurs are pretty good in the west and its an odd year again and they love winning championships on odd years! if garnett gets healthy they could wrap the east..but i love the cavs to be in the finals!|`|PjFLDSmdaa	Nope. Lakers vs. Cavs this year.|`|7ziT7Ob5aa	ultimately, i think its gonna be. they both are crazy. but don't under estimate king james!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|i5MInqeMaa	Yes if celtics get kg back at 100%.  the NBA is very predictable.   2 best teams are the lakers and cavs/celtics in the east.  Its a given that the lakers will be there.  2 best teams in the east are celtics and cavs.  For sure one of those 2 teams will be playing in the finals.

GswnLKtQaa	The truth is the Orlando has more impressive because D-wade's score all came from while chasing the Magic though it's really impressive how he manage to score at will vs a very good denfensive team.<br>  <br>  D-wade was spectacular, no one could stop him from penetrating. what's bad for the Heat is JO, Haslem could do a thing inside with the Magic bigs. Heat got killed and played no defence inside and outside.<br>  <br>  D-wade's effort is wasted...last time he scored 48 also came from a lost. frustrating...<br>  <br>  but D-wade's dunk over Lewis was SICK!|`|i5MInqeMaa	That was the biggest waist of a great scoring effort i have ever seen.  Kobe and lebron's big nights both kept the game close and the won.  Heat got blown out by 20 and were never in the game in-spite of wades performance.  I'll take 7 players in double figures.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Orlando getting 7 guys in double figures, but only because they won the game. Getting 50 points and losing is the same result as getting 0 points and losing, a loss is a loss.

Besides seeing Dwyane Wade score 50 points isn't too much of a surprise cuz everyone could expect that from Wade(no surprise there). He's just that good of a player but in the end...the orlando increased the number in their win column and Miami added another to their losing column so that's the difference maker at the end of the season.|`|Kw3dWcptaa	D wades performance because we all know that Orlando is pretty talented but D wade had to score in the lane with dwight howard waiting for him, and plus we know he isnt much of a perimeter shooter so he had to make tough outside shots or drive the lane and possibly get sent back to marquette by superman.|`|kjJkQpzPaa	Orlando|`|sGrrbz1aaa	orlando... 7 players scoring 10 or more or one getting 50....team wins over 1 player everytime|`|FlOTIfhbaa	Its not easy to score 50 points in 48 minutes...|`|GjJmNOg1aa	d wades 50 points because not to mention dwight was in the paint = best shot blocker.
GkFlzMHMaa	Ah interesting. But let me put you straight on a few things.<br>  <br>  First off who is this so-called player we signed from St Mirren? As far as I'm aware the last player we got from them was Ricky Gilles. So you need to be more specific on that matter..<br>  <br>  Why don't Aberdeen invest in foreign players? <br>  <br>  Did they not at one point do this? And started living out-with there means? Hench the 13 Million pound debts that they had to service. I mean it don't take a brain surgeon to work out that Football clubs can no long live out-with there means.<br>  <br>  And why is their manager so happy to plod on mid table for the next 15 years?<br>  <br>  So you can predict the future can you? <br>  <br>  What manager are you talking about? The current one, they have only has a 3 year contract..<br>  <br>  Do you know what mid-table means? Let me explain, in a 12 team league. mathematical mid-table would be 6th place right?  4th. 6th. 3th. 4th.

CDvQ7OLWaa	QB. hes a big running and passing threat.|`|Vz5vjAWRaa	I think it depends on the teams needs, like he he was to go to team hurting for a QB i think he will fit right in|`|ABoo1doVaa	Well, he was on the fence, and then he looked great at the combines. He was throwing the deep outs better than anyone, which is the most important pass to the scouts. I see a team giving him a shot. He isn't much smaller than Brees, and has as strong of an arm, so I see him getting a look at QB, and if he doesn't work out, the team could use him as a WR/Returner/running back.|`|ltqUpAKhaa	He should play QB. Do NOT make the mistake of comparing him to Vick; Vick is a lil bigger (215 lbs to White's 195), has a better arm (threw it 90 yards, which was ridiculous), and WAY faster (Dont misunderstand, White's 4.49 is blazing for a QB, but Vick ran a 4.19, thats a completely different level of speed). Based on his games this year, the senior bowl, and the combine, White should definitely be a QB.  his accuracy is very underrated, the ball comes out in good rhythm, and he can make plays if the pocket breaks down.  Given the right situation, and some time to develop, he could be a very good pro.|`|U3KAgO0baa	He does not have as strong an arm as Vick does(or at least did)<br>  And is only a lil more Accurate than Vick.<br>  He has the make up of a WR, he ran a 4.5, 40(around the same as Randle El)<br>  and had a 37inch Vertical...<br>  He will be an NFL WR...<br>  And Tebow Will Be a TE...<br>  Pat White is a better QB that Tebow.|`|MkE2kIpLaa	Well, I think he would make a better QB than WR, but here is a fun fact: He runs faster than Chris 'Beanie' Wells.|`|nlIpKw8Paa	he will be a wr.|`|88Pb5L3Zaa	Either, or.

15wwA3jjaa	Personally I think he will be the same Tom Brady we all know and love.  From what I've read in reports, if you watch him train right now you would never know he even injured his knee, and he hasn't even completely healed.  Brady has an excellent work ethic and is and will continue to train day in and day out until his knee is back to 100%.  He is a great quarterback and may be a bit rusty for the first few series of the 2009 season but after taking a few hits he will be over any anxiety of re-injuring his knee and he will be stepping up in the pocket and standing his ground to deliver a perfect pass under pressure once again.  Tom Brady has never been known for his mobility and he isn't very much a scrambler so he will not be effected as much as people believe he will be.  The most movement Brady makes with the ball in his hands is side stepping the defense, and his knee injury wont prevent him from continuing to do that when he returns.  Bottom line, Brady will be just fine after a few games to get back into the swing of things, and after he drops back and delivers a perfect pass to Randy Moss for a long touchdown strike, Matt Cassel will be a thing of the past.  <br>  <br>  Also to the guy who mentioned Donovan McNabb, he was always known as a mobile quarterback, and was only as good as he seemed because defenses were terrified of him burning them on the ground so they wouldn't always play as much coverage thus allowing him more options down the field.  Once he injured his knee, the league knew those days were long gone and now cover against the pass more thus forcing him to make good decisions and even better throws, which he was never really forced to do before.  He's not different, he's just been exposed as not that great of a passing quarterback.|`|vXFpzKRaaa	No... even if his body has healed 100%, he'll have a scar in his mind that won't be healed.  He may hesitate just a little when it comes to putting weight on his leg.  And this will have an impact on how he throws.  He'll never be 100% ever again even if he does come back and have a great career.|`|tgbO359Aaa	no one is ever the same coming back from a serious injury like Brady had, i doubt he'll be as good as he was before, he'll need a little time|`|cdQryr7paa	He should be.<br>  He has been training hard with his super model girfriend.|`|0fc4be2c7fe0b3251308b8c4479f2d3baa	no and i'm willing to bet that he doesn't start the season, like he says he will.|`|q69sdANSaa	If you play fantasy football I would grab Cassell and Brady next year for cheap. Cassell should be the starter early and then Brady will take over in the middle of the season. Brady should start finding a rhythm right around the fantasy football playoffs.|`|anLhaKcKaa	Some people have and some people havent. Alot of it depends on a. your work ethic and b. maybe even more important than a is your body type. some peoples body heals better than others.|`|QGBSOpt7aa	No.  No matter how much time has passed, you always have it in the back of your mind.  Everytime he gets pressure he will get "happy feet" because he will be concerned about re-injuring it|`|FtkoBEVpaa	I wouldn't count on it.  Carson Palmer went through the same thing and whether he's the same now is still "up in the air".|`|U3KAgO0baa	He wiil start the season.<br>  But he will need a few weeks 2 get back 2 the old Brady<br>  ie: Peyton this past year|`|5B6w8mxVaa	No its hard to come back from an injury like that|`|XLXncQu9aa	No. Brady's career won't be over in terms of how well he will do when he returns, but when you look at past injuries like his, players are usually never the same.  Take McNabb for instance.  Before he had that injury to his leg a couple of seasons ago he was amongst the elite in the NFL.  Now he is inconsistent.  He isn't a bad QB but he is no longer what he was before the leg injury.  My point is players usually don't play the same way after an extensive injury.  A lot of it has to do with the fear of getting hurt again.  When a player has a major injury they will take more precaution with their bodies to ensure a long career.  One careless mistake and its over.  McNabb doesn't run as much as he used to.  He still runs but the fact is after that injury of his he ran less because he wanted to protect his body from further wear and tear.  So Brady will be back and he'll get back on track but he won't be the same.
XRw2ux9waa	Undertaker and Michaels are both guaranteed Future Hall Of Famers, and with the way Orton is going - he will be on that list soon enough. <br>  <br>  As of now, the biggest record Orton holds is being the youngest World Heavyweight Champion. As long as noone beats that record, Orton is in good shape. And like I said before, with the way he's going today, and the momentum WWE is backing him up with, and also the fact Orton signed - what was it, a 10 year contract? Within 10 more years, Orton will be recognized as a great.<br>  <br>  But as for Shawn and Undertaker, they are already recognized as greats, icons, legends. Some may argue their the best in the business's history. <br>  <br>  But, who's more legendary of the two? That's a question that's been  going around for a while now - Who's better Undertaker or HBK. Both will be remember just as much as the other, but for very different things. So I find it impossible to separate these two guys they are both two of the best in the business and have had careers one can only dream of having.<br>  <br>  To answer your question. <br>  Orton - depends on the rest of his career<br>  Shawn Michaels and Undertaker, never will be forgotten.|`|NRs72Afxaa	Well Undertaker  and Shawn Michaels will never be forgotten when they retire.  Ortan will still be wrestling at that time. <br>  <br>  Who will be forgotten? Well when newer fans come in they won't know who Taker and HBK are.|`|sCiuv7n3aa	Well ummmm ....

He has remained with the WWE for over 20 years.<br>  2. He has the greatest winning streak in the history of professional wrestling with his dominance at Wrestlemania.<br>  3. He competed in the very first hell in a cell match which led to the introduction of two other legends Shawn Michaels and Kane.<br>  4. He is the innovator of the casket match and I don't think it would have ever been created if not for him.<br>  5. He was the first superstar EVER to enter into the Royal Rumble at number 30 and win!<br>  <br>  and <br>  <br>  6. His gimmick of the "deadman from death valley" has almost become a household name so I think he need not remind people of who he is :)<br>  <br>  I didn't chose HBK because I think that he is way overrated.  He's a fantastic athelete there's no denying that but I don't think he has brought anything new or fresh to the table over the last number of years.<br>  <br>  RKO is talented but relies too much on his "third generation superstar" resource for support and respect.<br>  <br>  I think of all the superstars mentioned above RKO will be forgotten first.<br>  <br>  Of other superstars I think Charle Hass will be forgotten first....|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	never forgotten:Undertaker<br>  Forgotten:Randy Orton

It creates new story's and angles for them to run with that people haven't seen before or at least in a while, if everyone stayed the same you would have the same matches every week, every year until you stopped watching because it was boring as hell to see.|`|Nmjjqoybaa	Well if they never changed the heels to faces and the faces to heels then wwe would be boring|`|H7p09fL2aa	to sharpen up the storylines<br>  imagine two superstars like john cena and rey mysterio feuding<br>  they never cheat so all the hype for the payperview would be some shows of respect and all that<br>  and if you feud someone like Undertaker and  Triple h someone would turn heel since they both want to win|`|4tvI9WYjaa	because they need a heel to start a rival with a face  they just can't  have  face vs face rival it not be exciting so they changed edge or some one in to a heel to make it more exciting for the story line and the fans|`|mysuLVovaa	There are trying to see what suit them better.

The steroid issue is reaching the saturation point and people will stop caring as much. It was a case where almost every top performer was using something, so should they eliminate an entire generation from the Hall? Probably not.<br>  <br>  Players like A-Rod, Clemens, and yes, even Barry Bonds, who were HOF caliber players even if they didn't use will eventually get in. But players like McGwire, Sosa and Palmeiro who were all just maybes without the steroids may not make it.|`|pLbRwbX8aa	What are they going to do, bronze his pills, powders, creams, and needles and set them next to his jersey?

I want to see the long ball. There has to be some type of distinction made between actual cheating like throwing games for gamblers and simply pursuing a higher performance level. What is the big deal? The world moves forward. We now have instant replay, video goal judges....and performance enhancing drugs. It is not as though they are using mechanical devices to perform at a higher level. And in the US, which has probably the highest use of prescription drugs in the world, why is this even an issue? You have kids on Ritalin to improve their performance in school, old men taking viagra to enhance their performance in bed, women taking uppers to improve their moods, etc. It is pure hypocrisy.|`|ASeS1Jo8aa	arod had a chance to be the best baseball player ever, but this change everything, but in over all what is really steroids? and he has 10 years to prove everybody wrong and possibly break the all time homerun reccord|`|XgAea2Olaa	he probably will <br>  but he is a BIG FAT CHEATER<br>  you shouldnt be allowed to use steriods and get in the hall of fame i think if u use steriods you should get banned from baseball|`|0zCHdo13aa	of couse he has a solid average great power numbers gives plenty of rbis also scores runs|`|cypNCoh3aa	Don't bet on it unless the media does a complete 180 on the drug stance.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Probably
s4VzPulYaa	Hey! <br>  I love it when people say they are interested in playing the sport, it's so nice helping beginners.<br>  My season begins in 2 hours YAY!!!!!!!<br>  Here are some good tips.<br>  Softball is my life, so I would suggest that if you are trying out for a high school team, you might want to get into the batting cages..... At this point in the year, coaches are already having optional practices, that is when you want to go. Most girls don't even show up for optional practice, so take advantage of that, you'll most likely get more attention from the coach, and he/she will have more time to help you. <br>  If you are willing to work at your house, get a softball, at mitt, and a partner and go play catch, it is the best way to get the hang of it, make sure that you are properly throwing the ball though, because if you don't it can cause injury...... It is a little difficult to explain proper mechanics over typing, but I'll do my best.<br>  Catching: Hold a softball and face sideways at your partner or object you are trying to hit, hold your mitt hand out, and face it at the target, or if you would rather just point your mitt hand elbow at the target. Then with your throwing hand hold it back behind you like you are going to throw the ball, put your throwing arm elbow slightly above your sholder, make sure that your wrist is facing backwards, kinda like you arm is a snake, and if the snake head faces you, it bites you, so make sure that the snake head is facing away. In other terms, make sure that the ball, and your fingers are facing behind you. Then rotate your arm up and over in a throwing postition, make sure that your arm follows through, and once you finish your throw, your arm is then at your mitt side hip. <br>  <br>  Catching: is just as easy. Don't be affraid of the ball, it really doesn't hurt. Keep your eye on the ball, and watch it go into your mitt, it's the best way to explain this. One thing that also might be great value to help is that, you might want to get a higher quality mitt, they break in a little quicker, and they reduce stinging. You are supposed to catch/field the ball in the pocket, but sometimes at full run, the ball doesn't always go right in the pocket, as an outfielder, I know this from experience, which is why you would probably like to have a higher quality mitt. I suggest getting a Worth Libery Advanced, or a Nokona.<br>  <br>  Batting is one of the more difficult things to explain, but I'll do my best. <br>  Make sure that you have the right bat for you, length and weight. <br>  Well start in batting position. So stand there with your feet shoulder width apart, and bend your knees a little. Then hold your bat up behind your head, be sure that you are not sticking your back elbow up.<br>  Next trigger, when the pitcher starts her motion, which means lift your foot up, and set it back down, the trigger allows you to get the timing of the pitcher down. <br>  Then once you are sure that the ball is a strike and is hittable, swing at it. I can't really explain proper swing at this point, because I would probably need to show you in order to give you acurite results, so I'll just say to make your swing go from low to high, and follow through, when you are done with your swing, make sure that the bat is behind you, and your back shoulder replaces where your front shoulder was when you began the swing. =D<br>  <br>  Bunting: bunting is a lot like hitting, just pivot your feet, so that your toes are facing the pitcher, and that your body is facing her also, make sure that you stick your ams out as far as they will go, and hold your bat at a 45 degree angle, keep your bottome hand where it was on the bat, and slide your top hand up about 6 to 8 inches of the bat, make sure that your fingers are behind the bat, so that way you don't get your fingers squished. If you want the ball to go down 3rd base line, slightly angle your bat in that direction, if you want it to go down the 1st base line, angle your bat in that direction.<br>  <br>  Slapbunting: slapbunting is a left handed manuver, but some rightys swich to the left side, I recomend asking your coach about teaching you this, especially if you are a quick runner, I slapbunt for my team, and I love it, it is more fun than hitting. What you do is you stand in the left side batters box, like you are going to hit, one the pitcher starts her motion, slide your front foot back a little ways, and run at the ball coming to you, you can either swing at it, or lightly tap the bat with the ball, they are strategys used in highly competitive softbal.... I find it difficult to completly explain the slapbunt, but you should ask your coach about this, it is very important to your team that you have at least one slapper, so seriously, if you want to have an awesome addrenalin rush, and get all pumped up, ask your coach about slapbunting.<br>  <br>  Sliding: sliding is another VERY and I emphasize VERY important thing you need to know. This also goes back to if you are a fast runner, if you are fast, your coach might have|`|Lpf6Eu3eaa	hire a trainer<br>  <br>  do drills<br>  <br>  good luck, girls in sports is sexy|`|F0IeVJ0Iaa	you must work on catching and throwing there is nothing worse than someone standing out in the field clueless when a pop up comes right at them and they miss, it aggrivates the team<br>  also practice sliding and stealing bases<br>  work on bunting and hitting the ball<br>  go to batting cages they really do help <br>  get a nice fitting glove that is not too small|`|zAQI22sMaa	just learn the game. and spend all the time that ur not working at it to observe everything thats going on. (watch how the girls set up on the infield with a runner on first, things like that)<br>  get in the batting cages cause that helps alot but also spend a lot of time fielding live hitting in game-like situations. nothing can substitute for that experience. <br>  but more than anything just dont be afraid to go in there and mix it in a little bit. have fun and enjoy it. you'll do fine! :)|`|qExNjtTqaa	get in shape and work on hitting the ball, and throw with someone else who plays<br>  it will be hard for u at first but ull get the hang of it

tzrLDbHWaa	Not this season.  The Lakers would need to roll off 26 in a row, would be a total 30 game win streak, and although the 71-72 Lakers put together 33 in a row, its not happening with this Laker team.  Those 95-96 Bulls only managed an 18 game win streak.  <br>  <br>  I doubt anyone will even challenge that record, let alone beat it.

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	No that angle is only part of Rey Mysterio's gimmick in WWE.When he was in WCW, he was one of the top stars in the Cruiserweight division and then a member of the Latino World Order and Filthy Animals factions, working a different gimmick to his current one.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	Rey Mysterio, Jr. aka Rey Mysterio is a great wrestler and was extremely popular when he wrestled for Mexican wrestlin gPromotions, Japanese Wrestling Promotions, ECW, WCW and WWE. Rey Mysterio has been extremely popular and sells a lot of merchandise at every House Show, Live Event, television Taping and Pay Per View. As some commenters have already noted, Rey Mysterio is a great wrestler and has wrestled some of the best matches that I ever saw in ECW, WCW and WWF/WWE. He does not have to rub the heads of little children in the crowd, It's now part of his gimmick and his ring entrance. He chooses to do this.|`|iMGSaC0qaa	I don't know what the first person who answered is talking about. The WCW was known for having a stellar Cruiserweight division and Rey was the best Cruiserweights they had. At one point they were having him beating the Giant, and Kevin Nash, as the Giant Killer. <br>  <br>  Rey had a huge fan base in WCW and little kids loved him. WCW had the best LIGHTWEIGHT division in wrestling. WWE doesn't, and the X Division has dwindled down because of Samoa Joe and Kevin nash both holding the title at one point.|`|5xIroQjMaa	No, back in WCW he wasn't really trying to win over the children. They used him similarily though, in that he always went up against big wrestlers, and generally got beat by them, occasionally getting a victory that he pulled out of nowhere.|`|YyEOi1Tpaa	It doesn't really matter because even if he turned heel he wouldn't stay that way so in reality Rey was always fan favorites to the children|`|gUqTlLROaa	Well the truth is a little bit of both but it started at wcw

And I am not an Indians fan so you are not getting a biased view point here. Last year his numbers were .268-90-33. That is pretty much what he has been averaging the last few years. And it was actually a career high in home runs. I highly doubt he is going to go from that to hitting about 5 home runs and losing his job to a nobody. Also, I will admit he does strike out a lot but his strikeouts actually went down a bit last year from previous seasons. He is a good ball player.<br>  <br>  There is one thing to simply not like a player but let's try to use a little bit of logic when hating.|`|NpqAbZqpaa	No regular player in the history of baseball 'always strikes out'.<br>  <br>  I'd say that you are a bitter divisional rival fan.  <br>  There is no CF that I would rather have on my team than Grady Sizemore.<br>  <br>  To not appreciate his talents is to not appreciate good old fashion baseball.|`|9d5001a56ba031ba48358cae82b85660aa	I say he hits about .290 with about 25 homers, 120 RBIs, and about 40-50 SB.|`|tG5Ar7DIaa	I sure hope you ain't serious.

iw3v5bgIaa	I think that you should try the gear on at a local shop before buying online, to make sure it fits and has the quality that will last.<br>  <br>  If your local shop has all the gear that you're looking for, try it all on together to make sure that the equipment fits you well.<br>  <br>  You can also go to:<br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/sports-hockey-equipment-discounts-deals" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/sports-hockey-equ...</a><br>  <br>  This site has a few stores that you can compare prices with, which include close-outs and sales on hockey equipment.|`|axxQzOCHaa	Order locally so you can absolutely sure of being fitted properly and won't have to worry about shipping / duty charges, the store might cut you a deal or add a couple extras. (rolls of tape, pucks, etc.)|`|rvE7gyuUaa	The equipment you have mentioned is perfect for you. <br>  Reason 1 - this equipment is mid-priced but will provide all of the protection you need.<br>  Reason 2 - RBK bought Jofa equipment and all their pads are the Jofa models that the pros use.  <br>  Reason 3 - you are putting moe money into the equipment that you should spend more on. (pro stock gloves)  I would recommend getting a higher level skate though. Spend more on skates, sticks and gloves than the other equipment.|`|nJdCSTQ6aa	Go for the cheapest things. The pads dont matter it dosnt hurt. Just make shure the skates stick and cup are comfortable.|`|ll2y4YIGaa	the first package with the pads and stuff.. downgrade to the 3k, it will save you money and you wont notice that much of a difference as a first time player. same for the pants all for the same reason of course. keep the gloves.the skates are just fine i would almost even say go for this years 3k skates. but if you like the 5ks get those, you wont need anything better that than because youre a first time player in house league. the helmet id say just get the 4k, it saves money and the only difference is the lining inside the helmet. and lastly just get one of those $5 shock doctor mouthgards at local sports store. they all pretty much do the same job with the same protection.<br>  <br>  and youll need a stick. id say get one of these three, the rbk 4k, the rbk 5, or the bauer xvi (best stick in my opinion)

F8Ac1pPNaa	This is a very informative article about scopes that you may find useful.|`|fB8ujUVNaa	bushnell makes a decent scope for that price. 30mm 3x9|`|TPZwmQK9aa	I would go with this one from Wal-Mart:<br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=6340058" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  It does not come with rings, but all you need are standard 1" rings and matching scope base for the Ruger.  You can get those in a kit from Wal-Mart, too, and still keep the total well under $70.<br>  Don't buy a scope that's less than 40mm.  You will find plenty of rimfire scopes in 32mm that come with rings, but they just don't perform like a 40mm model.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	If you want to stay in that price range buy one of the .22 specific scopes from Simmons, Tasco or Bushnell. The 4x28mm or 4x32mm versions are usually the best for the money but you can go with the 3-9x32mm 22 scope and they will do pretty well for a starter scope. If you can save a bit more money I'd suggest a Nikon Prostaff 4x32mm Rimfire scope they seem to be about $100. If you really want a variable Weaver makes a wonderful 2.5-7x28mm in their rimfire line for about $125.<br>  <br>  Ignore Okie about lense size, he's not even paying attention. He recommends a 4x32mm scope then says not to buy under a 40mm. Someday when he has experience he will understand that the quality of the scope makes a much greater difference then any objective lense size. I'd rather put a 2-7x33mm Leupold VX-II on a rifle then even a Nikon Buckmaster 3-9x40 and those are VERY close in quality. If you offered me a choice between a Simmons 4-12x50mm and the Nikon I named I'd grab the Nikon even at twice the cost.|`|dpSr0icwaa	the ruger 10/22 comes with a metal bar about half an inch wide and 4 inches long.  There are two types of these bars, one that will accept 'dovetail' also know as 'tip-off' and one that is a universal 'dovetail' PLUS 'weaver'  The weaver compatable one has about 5 grooves cut across it<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nextag.com/10-22-Ruger-Rifle-587613172/prices-html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nextag.com/10-22-Ruger-Rifle-...</a><br>  <br>  you must purchase the weaver style rings seperately, but the weaver style rings hold a lot better.  Of course as it is just a 22, not a lot of recoil so this isn't very important.<br>  <br>  many, but not all, rimfire scopes come with tipoff rings<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.midwayusa.com/browse/BrowseProducts.aspx?pageNum=1&tabId=10&categoryId=11397&categoryString=657***11392***&sortBy=Price%20asc" rel="nofollow">http://www.midwayusa.com/browse/BrowsePr...</a><br>  <br>  as you see there, most are pictured with rings.<br>  <br>  Note about buying scopes, more magnificaiton is harder to do, this means it is more expensive.  Same with 'varaible' scopes, (like a 3-9x this means you have 3x zoom, 4x zoom, 5x, 6x, 7x, 8x, and 9x zoom)<br>  <br>  What this means is that if you see a scope that is 4X for $50 and a scope that is 6X for $50, the 4X one is of a higher quality, because no way they can make a 6X of the same quality for the same price.  Same thing if you see a 3-9X for $50.<br>  <br>  in other words I'd rather have this 4X one for $45 <br>  <a href="http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct/?productNumber=267844" rel="nofollow">http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct/?pr...</a><br>  <br>  than this 3-9X one for the same price<br>  <a href="http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct/?productNumber=211994" rel="nofollow">http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct/?pr...</a><br>  <br>  because for $45, I'd not expect the zoom feature to work for long, and the crosshairs would probably shift when you zoomed it.  In this case, less is more.<br>  <br>  heck you'd be better off getting this 4X for $35 than the 3-9X for $45<br>  <a href="http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct/?productNumber=388644" rel="nofollow">http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct/?pr...</a><br>  As far as objective size....I'd stay away from 20mm, but 32mm is just fine.<br>  <br>  You just aren't going to get a variable that is going to hold it's zero without paying about $75<br>  <br>  this one would probably be okay...but just okay.<br>  <a href="http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct/?productNumber=513005" rel="nofollow">http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct/?pr...</a><br>  <br>  Now, for a tad over $100 you can get a real nice rimfire scope like this<br>  <a href="http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct/?productNumber=149715" rel="nofollow">http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct/?pr...</a><br>  again, it is a simple 4x, so a lot less to go wrong.  There is a reason Nikon doesn't offer a cheap variable scope, that is because they have a commitment to quality, and cheap and variable just don't go together.<br>  <br>  <br>  NOTE:  This also holds true of all the $49.99 3-9x scopes you see for sale as 'store brands' or 'pronghorn' or whatever.  You get what you pay for.  If you want to pay just $50, stick with a simple 4x|`|KDOIKIq2aa	I was going to say a Bushnell Banner, but even the cheap ones run about $80 any more.  I also don't think they come with rings.<br>  <br>  Simmons makes a nice fixed 4x scope at around $40.  Most rimfire scopes do come with rings that fit the dove tail most all manufactures have/use on their rimfire rifles.  Even if they don't Tasco .22 rings can be had for about $10.|`|AA12211483	BSA 4x32 w/ see-thru mounts for use of iron sights.

Lpf6Eu3eaa	scientists and chemists make designer steroids that disguise their make-up<br>  <br>  get it?|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Spitballs were outlawed in the early 1920s, and some pitchers still manage to get away with one now and then.|`|2wgEsVmsaa	Selig and his multi-billionaire crooks are scared crapless at  the thought that they might lose $25.37. They could put the kibosh on it. But they won't. They are the crooks. Everyone here is wringing their hands over A-Rod, who did not break the rules. But they sit there with their mouths agape, scratching their balls, when some damn neo-con whines about the dirty, low-life fans expecting too much. It used to be 'kill the ump', which was always wrong. Now it's 'kill the player'. Should be kill the owners. And it's nothing new. 1919 Black Sox was as much the owner's fault as those poor underpaid slobs. Now they aren't underpaid, but that don't make em the bad guys, either.|`|a31kUn1Naa	Because the game is about who can hit the most hrs and be the best power hitter. Everyone wants to be that guy.

FFE9Qztzaa	Brazilian's have always identified each other with their first names or nicknames. I think it has always been a tradition to be directed that way. Plus, I think they aim and value individuality. Ah, also...<br>  Brazilians are commonly found to have long surnames. It would be quite difficult to fit that in the back of their jersey.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  its not a guess! here I found sources for you too!<br>  <a href="http://www.automationmedia.com/Editorials.asp?ID=%20176" rel="nofollow">http://www.automationmedia.com/Editorial...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bigsoccer.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-588248.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigsoccer.com/forum/archive/i...</a>|`|WS8MvKQAaa	I think it just kind of became a custom, I don't really know, but I always thought it was kind of cool. I guess I'd be Gaytown...hahahaha|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	I think it's because some of them have similar names.Also,I'm guessing it's a culture thing,where everyone has a nickname and it sticks with them forever.Besides,I think "Kaka" is a way cooler name than "Leite".Ditto with "Ronaldo" and "Da Lima".|`|mK06dus9aa	I don't know - but I like it and it usually allows a player to be more or less uniquely identified without using cumbersome names - imagine trying to chant Kaka's full name.<br>  <br>   Kaka = Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite <br>  <br>  @Mandy (fly me) Gaytown I give you the Brazilian nickname "Gayquinho"|`|MjPd9vyYaa	AHA Miranda!<br>  <br>  But yeah I don't know exactly why but its really cool :)<br>  Maybe because they want to be known better, you know like maybe their last names are "long" or hard to pronounce. Or maybe its their nickname so they just use that.|`|3yqCKPzVaa	FYI, Ronaldinho is not a Brazilian name..<br>  <br>  Ronaldinho just means "lil Ronaldo",,, =]|`|IWM1khX7aa	Ronaldinho means "little Ronaldo" in Portuguese, and there was already a Ronaldo when he became famous (you can't have 2 Ronaldos on the Brazilian team)<br>  <br>  Kaka's first name is Ricardo.  He got his name when is little brother Rodrigo mispronunced his name when he said "Kaka".  It's a term of endearment.<br>  <br>  Adriano is his first name, and so is Ronaldo's.<br>  <br>  I guess it's just thier nicknames like Pele.
nH4TOhGVaa	Billy if Rangers win the league then i'll take my hat of to you and expect you to take your feathers off if Celtic win. In answering your question yep Rangers are playing better than Celtic right now but there's still a few games to go.|`|h7GtCCC7aa	It's a bit of both, Rangers are playing better than a couple of months ago whilst Celtic look stale and void of ideas.<br>     January was a chance for Celtic to bring a couple of 'quality' new faces in to freshen things up yet their greed could well cost them the title. At the same time, by Rangers NOT selling Boyd, this has had the effect that 2 or 3 big signings could of had at Ibrox.<br>  <br>  Losing the league may be a blessing in disguise for Celtic as they could get shot of Strachan and end up with a less stubborn boss (in terms of team selection) who the board actually 'trust' to buy a player with their money<br>  <br>  Still a long way to go but Rangers certainly look the best bet at this stage and, yes, both sides have been poor this season and I wouldn't fancy any of their chances to qualify for the CL with the current squads.|`|bTNxl0ohaa	Boructhe..., less of the anti-gingerism mate, im a redhead.<br>  <br>  Ginger til i dye.<br>  <br>  Though everyone at school always treated me differently, ive no idea why this class photo looks so odd.|`|fe4de024b75923a09899e2e2db104cb3aa	Well done, pip pip old chap.

0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	Its definetly possible.  Mcnabb is one of the best QBs in the NFL, the stats dont lie.  Give him a top notch WR an people will be jumping on his wagon again.  He took them there when he had Owens. Speaking of Owens...........were the Eagles better when they let him go?  Were the Niners better when they let him go?   Just thought Id throw that in to the Cowboy haters|`|WaaFCtuOaa	I don't see McNabb winning a SB with or without Boldin.  He's good but just can't seem to get past the NFC championship game, well he did once & got to SB but 3 of his receptions went to the patriot defenders.  He's good QB but at times he can over compensate & throw an interception at the wrong moment, late in the 4th quarter|`|GZVqEEDraa	Hmmm...   I think it's a fifty fifty chance, all depends on how everyone else plays with them and how effective that new change might be.<br>  <br>  <br>  I <3 the Eagles!  Eff you Steelers, more like cheaters!  Grrr!|`|uU9aCPB4aa	it is very possible the cowboy fan speaks the truth. If they get McNabb a good target (TJ Housh.... or Anquan Boldin) and solve their short yardage problems they are a very capable team. They can definetly win the big one.|`|qsKOlpUyaa	The Eagles got to the Super Bowl WITHOUT Owens. They lost it WITH him.|`|ePDhY233aa	no, the eagles suck and have no chance of going to the superbowl ever.

oAjbBLDpaa	For first time ever or for any time? Edge is a current Canadian champion. *I didn't know if you meant Non American or Non Canadian champion or if you meant someone outside of America including Canada*<br>  For first time WHC or WWE Champion...I don't think it will be in the near future but I see Umaga winning it eventually. <br>  <br>  2nd: The World Championship could be a better name but I really don't even care what the name of the title is, I only care for what is done with it. And I think Jeff is over 220 which makes him a legitimate heavyweight. Also, heavyweights are sometimes classified as middleweight and above in some areas so Mysterio who comes in at about a 165 middle weight can be considered a legitimate contender.<br>  <br>  3rd: No. The heel turn is a positive impact on his career. A great second feud with Shawn Michaels as well as two championships. All in his returning year.<br>  <br>  4th: No, these are some of the best questions I've answered in a while. I personally enjoyed the survey a lot. By the way, I usually record RAW and watch it the next night so I don't have to stay up or get distracted, <br>  <br>  5th: Another confrontation with Jericho (presumably with Stone Cold from all the rumors that have been floating around on every other question about RAW), Triple H confronts Randy Orton but I would guess that Orton backs out and it becomes Triple H vs Cody Rhodes and DiBiase. CM Punk is probably going to win the triple threat qualifier but John Morrison has a slim chance seeing as it looked like they wanted to start an angle with Morrison pinning Miz in the fatal fourway on ECW before the Rumble. Another tag team diva match, Rosa will probably interfere again but I think she will get caught by the ref this time or Santino will. No other predictions...<br>  <br>  6th: You'll get one sooner or later.|`|lHAKRQaqaa	i think william regal will recieve a push and win the wwe title<br>  wwe eddie guerrereo in 2004<br>  world heavyweight  the great khali in 2007<br>  <br>  it should just be called the world title<br>  <br>  no hes 2 good as a heel<br>  <br>  i haven't been on so idk <br>  <br>  i think triple h will kill randy orton|`|ehfe97Zcaa	Whoever the script writers of WWE choose. What is the point in debating things like this when it's not real and the results are predetermined??|`|OuFhcdX9aa	as for the last non america or canadian to hold the world title was khali.<br>  then it bounced to roidtista,edge,taker,edge,cm punk,jericho,then cena. now back to edge.<br>  maybe not exactly in that order.<br>  but wwe a foreign champion in a while.<br>  who i think has the possiblilty no one. b/c right now the main focus is on edge and orton for being champs. and im fine with that rated rko has a group were more dominent then HBK and Triple Roids.<br>  think about it the Newer DX lacked alot b/c of there silly feuds with the mcmahons and big show. that was lame. now edge and orton took at dx with no trouble. the double con chair to to HBK was great a true heel move. then HHH had to try and get revenge and it didnt work.<br>  this continued for a while until DX finally split and HBK and Cena try to join up until they crashed b/c of the whole hbk betraying his partner crap and so on.<br>  anyways like i said orton and edge will be champs for a while orton will beat triple h and take the title from him probably at mania.|`|h5lOMoqBaa	God, I hope it's not Kozlov. The guy can't sell moves, he sandbagged the Undertaker in the chamber. His timing is awful, and his moveset is worse than anything on the planet.

HE'S FROM BROOKLYN, AND SINCE WHEN IS BROOKLYN NOT IN AMERICA?<br>  <br>  HE ASKED THE NEXT NON AMERICAN OR NON CANADIAN, NOT THE NEXT CANADIAN|`|1JywgkyMaa	i think christian has great potential to be a world champion,but i dont think wwe really sees that yet,and i dont tihnk  that they should re name the world heavyweight title,its fine as it is. and chris jericho shouldn't turn  face yet,maybe sometime next year,a good heel stays heel for a long time,and that's what chris jericho is,a great heel,and what's going to happen on raw,hhh will probably get punted in the head,or he might beat the hell out of rhodes and dibiase with a sledge hammer while randy orton watches|`|GJRxBqknaa	first i think Jericho is the best heel in wrestling in a long time. he doesn't go for the cool heel gimmick, he gets genuine heat. I think there is a new heavy weight status in wrestling now, all the guys are about the same size, so i feel they should just keep it the way it is.  Umaga seems to be a good contender for the wwe or whc belt. or maybe koslov|`|gwwvio8Yaa	1st Jericho let jump to the future maybe a year after DH Smith returns he will win the title at a PPV <br>  <br>  2nd Nah it's part of history leave it alone<br>  <br>  3rd Jericho runs his mouth and another legend comes out challenges him to a match at WM 25<br>  <br>  5th Same thing that happened to the Rock... Orton will be taken out in an ambulance then Hunter will ram a Semi into the Ambulance...<br>  Okay seriously Kozlov will take JBL out thus HBK goes to WM 25 to face The Deadman but tonight it will be 2 on 3 match as Legacy takes on DX which will end with Orton leaving in an ambulance|`|UWJinEbIaa	Low-ki<br>  <br>  Senshi<br>  <br>  Kaval<br>  <br>  TJ Wilson<br>  <br>  KENTA<br>  <br>  Ricky Steamboat Jr<br>  <br>  Jericho will argue with another ye olde legend....here's to wishing that its Iron Sheik's turn...another 20 minute movie preview.....Punk/Regal again for the 4353875 time......Knox beats up Rey again......Shane does his silly dance.....Edge speaks the truth

Chivas has no experience? The last 3 years, it's all been the same player and they can't play well against South American Teams? Just cause America won on Saturday, you think America is all that now. Where were you the other jornadas? Seriously, learn some stuff first. Get off your knees and stop thinking America is the best team ever. The only real players with experience on America is Cabanas, Ochoa, Rojas, Vera, Pardo and Esqueda. Two of whom aren't starters. The rest are new and have no experience. Chivas? They got their whole roster, with the exception of Ochoa, Mendoza, and Ponce. Yea, you sound real smart saying Chivas lacks experience.<br>  <br>  I'm not going as far as saying that they will do good, because the team isn't playing so good, but their first game, they got bad luck and the last minute goal was scored on them but being an away game, they played above average. After the first 3 games, we'll be able to tell whether Chivas will make out the group stage, then from there we'll talk about the other rounds.|`|X4aweBgTaa	okay imma keep it short...yes we will get far in libertadores..will we win? thas another question..we have one of the best, if not THE best defenses in mexico...our midfield is solid with experience and youth..our forwards shold be dangerous when arellano returns.|`|Epmny08zaa	Man I Was Gonna Wish Them Luck...But Since U Started Talkin Crap To America...I Hope Las Birrias Del Guadalajara Dont Make It To The Next Round <br>  <br>  Pinches Chicas|`|8ucq6SEjaa	Hopefully Far! <br>  I think we can make all the way to finals and Winn. <br>  =)<br>  <br>  Arriba Las Chivas! <br>  <33|`|qOOU1EVlaa	yea i think they will go far ..cus we have a good defense!!! man carlos ochoa needs to get a lil better though..i cant wait till omar arrellano gets bak!! lol|`|9KbU8jPRaa	they are going to win the libertadores|`|RHsUCF9haa	not far i bet they want even make it out of the group stage<br>  right because carlos ochoa sucks|`|IFIbEGc6aa	I dnt They will Get eliminated on the group phase!!

But be realistic, you cabras won't get passed the group stages like America. We have been dangerous to teams in Brasil, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia.<br>  Your players will get pressured and plus your in another tournament.

You take it so serious. America was using their whole squad for both tournaments. And I'm one of the Americanistas who is always anlylzing.|`|HZ8KkQKWaa	real talk here....they will get passed the group stage but that's all because chivas will focus more in the local tournament than libertadores, it will cost them to lose<br>  <br>  but if they focus good in both i say they go to 1/4 stages.....chivas has a good team but if you compare them to riverplate or boca they have a  lot to do if they want to win libertadores|`|f4w9NkETaa	Lets see hopefully they do good... cuz its a mexican team representing..<br>  not like in da sudamericana  08<br>  hahaha<br>  <br>  Chivas (MEX)  0 - 2  Internacional (BRA)<br>  19 de Noviembre 2008<br>  Internacional (BRA)  4 - 0  Chivas (MEX)|`|qbPbvLuLaa	CAMPEONES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  ARRIBA LAS CHIVAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Villareal i havent seen much flair from during the past few weeks. Villareal feed off of through-ball and attacking play and they just havent cut it recently.  Bayern might not be in good form but dont they have the 2nd best goal difference in Europe? Or has that been broken already? I can see Bayern going through if they try hard enough, but thats just my opinion.|`|MjPd9vyYaa	Yes! I mean who knows maybe UTD are in TIP TOP form and will kick the living sh!t out of Inter or Lyon have a surprise that will scare Barca sh!tless!??<br>  Who knows? :D|`|mK06dus9aa	Lyon to beat Barca<br>  <br>  Man Utd will be shocked more  than suprised by the might of Inter|`|ufhetmdvaa	Panathinaikos beating Villareal is not a surprise <br>  <br>  the surprise will be when Inter beat united only by 3-0

KXmMlqA9aa	I would go out with Shawn Michaels. He also seems like a very nice person who cares a lot for god and his family. Plus he is HOT!! Well atleast I think so =] <333<br>  <br>  BQ1: I think that probably out of the divas that wrestle than Layla. I mean she doesn't wrestle a lot but all she does is kick punch and clothesline. And they are still sloppy. As for right now she is techically she is a jobber with William Regal.<br>  <br>  BQ2: I don't think she will. She seems such like a raw diva and would never leave raw.<br>  <br>  BQ3: Mabey. You can't be sure about that. Since pretty much all of the High-Carders are more built up and older in the WWE. Give it some time mabey he will get there but as for right now he is doing an AWSOME job in the ring as a mid-carder.|`|WpaQKpckaa	I'd go out with either Jeff Hardy (with a clean face), Chris Jericho, CM Punk, Cody Rhodes.<br>  1.

Maria, how long has she been in the business and how long has she been the worst wrestler. Kelly is better and all she does is flip around. <br>  2. No idea, it could be an interesting move though. Beth and Melina seem to be taking center stage on RAW with Rosa and Kelly seeming to be pushed into the title picture while Smackdown has only Michelle and Maryse for legitimate title contenders (Eve just debuted and putting the belt on Maria is losing all credibility of it.) so it is very possible.<br>  3. MVP definitely. Stephanie McMahon said it herself in the steroid report in 2006 that they wanted MVP in the main event in a few years.<br>  R-Truth perhaps. I personally don't find him entertaining on the mic and his wrestling skills to be mediocre...I see him as upper mid card at best, maybe US or tag team title. <br>  Hurricane Helms probably. This one really depends on what brand he appears on. I like his in ring abilities and mic work and think that he could do well with a good storyline but he isn't up to par with some current main eventers and would need a secondary title to get the push...

kqP7GwOcaa	Great answers, thumbs up to toughguy and gman.<br>  <br>  My top ten heavyweight contenders list reads like this.<br>  <br>  1. Sam McVey<br>  <br>  2. Sam Langford<br>  <br>  3. Harry Wills<br>  <br>  4. Jerry Quarry<br>  <br>  5. Earnie Shavers<br>  <br>  6. Joe Jeanette<br>  <br>  7. George Chuvalo<br>  <br>  8. Jimmy Young<br>  <br>  9. Luis Firpo<br>  <br>  10. David Tua<br>  <br>  There are at least another half dozen or so who deserve honorable mention, names like Cleveland Williams, Ike Ibeibuchi, Oscar Bonavna, Ron Lyle, Andrew Golata and Frank Bruno also came to mind.|`|AA12325046	Very interesting question sir.  I am assuming that you are referring to just the contenders and not those who won the championship so here is my list:<br>  <br>  1. Jerry Quarry.  Small for a heavyweight but very tough and a very hard puncher with above average boxing skills.  Had a propensity for cuts and fighting in the era with Frazier and Ali.<br>  2.  Earnie Shavers.  One of the hardest punchers in heavyweight history.  Almost beat Ali and Holmes in title fights.<br>  3.  George Chuvalo.  Maybe the toughest man alive.  Never knocked off his feet in 93 fights.  Fought Ali twice in title fights and Frazier and Foreman without hitting the canvas.  Very durable.<br>  4.  Tommy Farr.  Fought the great Louis in his first title fight and gave a great account of himself losing a tough decision.<br>  5.  Oscar Bonavena.  The hard punching Argentinian with an iron chin gave Ali a great fight and many thought he deserved the decision over Joe Frazier in their first fight.<br>  6.  Arturo Goday.  A lot like Bonavena, gave Louis a very tough fight their first fight.  Very strong and awkward fighter.<br>  7.  Cleveland Williams.  Like Shavers, one of the hardest punchers ever to put on gloves.  Outpunched by Liston twice and devastated by Ali in title shots.<br>  8.  Luis Firpo.  Who can ever forget when he knocked Jack Dempsey through the ropes and almost became champion.<br>  9.  Roland La Starza.  Brilliant boxer that almost beat Marciano their first fight.  Was knocked out in 11 in their title fight.<br>  10.  Jimmy Young.  Extrmely clever fighter that almost beat Ali in title fight and did upset Foreman.|`|910875de6723862c69bd16bf9f5b2249aa	Toughguy has some great fighters listed.

EsTAylwIaa	not got a bleeding clue handsome the spl is bad enough|`|S0LSmJ9haa	I have absolutely no idea whatsoever, I am waiting for the intelligent ones on here to come on and explain to me what the benefits if any are?<br>  one good thing for me is we can keep our reserve players fit now that they are scapping the reserve league, apart from that...help? lol|`|MPqO1Qayaa	a load of tish tosh is what it is. they say, and the jags are a team who opposed it thankfully, that it will generate more fans and more money at the games. they are also very hopefull of securing a tv deal that will not only show a highlights show, but also some live games too.......which in turn will only stop people paying to go to the games, but sit and watch them in the house<br>  <br>  <br>  madness|`|h7GtCCC7aa	The game is going down the toilet and all we are likely to get is SPL2. That's it. SPL2 is the cure, the future.<br>  <br>  God Almighty, we need a restraining order for these people.They are seriously harming the game and must be stopped before they cause any more damage.<br>  <br>  At a time when minds should be at work planning a much-needed overhaul of development systems-which must includeschools, coaching standards, league structures, governing bodies, facilities, finance, and the start and length of the season-we are offered another layer of dross. This is the best the men who run our clubs can do. It's pathetic.<br>  <br>  Thegame should be having a big debate with politicians about how football can help improve the nation's health as well as society. In return for assistance in funding facilities, which should be for all sports, football should be giving back by allowing under-privileged kids access.<br>  <br>  Children who have learning difficulties, or who are disruptive in classrooms should be brought in and given encouragement and hope in a different environment.<br>  <br>  They would probably relate and communicate better if they were in the same place as their football heroes. The same could be done with people of low self-esteem because this game can touch alot of people in lots of different ways.<br>  <br>  Football cannot continue to take without giving and it certainly won't get any more government help in its current condition. Unless the game opens up and accepts it is a sub-standard product in its current form the ills cannot be cured. This is the time to look at a fresh approach and do something radical instead of allowing the greed of men who have failed to plan for the future to rule again.<br>  <br>  The SPL was born of greed and avarice, as well as empire building, and those can be the only reasons for considering SPL2.<br>  <br>  Some First Division clubs believe that by joining SPL2 they will get more money, but they won't.They believe SPL2 will give them added prestige, but it will do nothing of the kind because you can take a down and out and kit him out with the finest, most expensive threads, but unless he is willing to change his ways and his thinking he'll still be the same tramp.<br>  <br>  Scottish football needs help from outside because those who have been running it and influencing it have failed to protect it.<br>  <br>  Over the years they have changed the set-up many times, but they have still to get it right and once again they are looking at making the wrong change when it is so obvious drastic yet intelligent alterations are needed at all levels.<br>  <br>  The first change is to create one governing body because nothing big will happen while the game is at the mercy of three masters. They have different agendas and will never reach consensus. There are too many stubborn fools who cannot see beyond their own little kingdoms and may well be oblivious to the decline.<br>  <br>  But somewhere there must be one strong person, a voice of reason capable of leading the game out of this mess.

S8BCApc5aa	It is almost impossible to overestimate how important this series was to the city of New York overall.<br>  <br>  I mean, look at the history to start with. This the fifth time in since 1947 the two teams met in the World Series. Even worse for Dodger fans, the Yankees won the previous four series they played against each other. The Yankees were obviously hated adversaries, the combination of geographical proximity and recent heartache at their expense led to a fierce rivalry.<br>  <br>  We also need to remember how damn good these two teams were! There were ten future Hall of Famers in this series - both managers and four players on each team (and Koufax would have made five for the Dodgers if he had actually played). The games in the series were pretty good, and game 7 was a classic pitcher's duel. Also, consider that until Game 7, the home team had won every game in this series. Then, Johnny Podres turned in a brilliant performance to finally beat the Evil Empire on their home turf.<br>  <br>  The last time the Dodgers had won a championship was 1900. There were a ton of Dodger fans who had waited to so long to see their team finally triumph, only to be rebuffed by the Bronx Bombers on multiple occasions. At that point, for a franchise as popular as Brooklyn to go 55 years without a title was an absurdly long and torturous drought. It was compounded by how good the team actually was. In addition to the four prior pennant winners that had failed to win the World Series, this is the team that was the victim of The Shot Heard 'Round the World in 1951. Dodgers fans had an unofficial slogan - "wait til' next year!" I think the easiest analogy to a recent phenomenon would have been the Red Sox until they actually won the series - two wildly popular franchises who had come extremely close to victory several times only to be rebuffed by cruel fate. Then, not only did the Dodgers win, but they did it over one of their two most hated rivals (the New York Giants were obviously the other).<br>  <br>  The victory celebration was insane. As author Pete Hamill said, "In Brooklyn that day, it was the Liberation of Paris, Vee Jay Day, New Years Day all rolled into one." Baseball was so ingrained into the national culture at this point, and Dodgers fans were rabid and loyal. It would be difficult to write a movie with this type of storybook ending. So of course, Brooklyn went into a frenzy. "But Wall Street is in Manhattan," you may say. True, but fans of each team were certainly represented on at the Stock Exchange. If you take such an enormously culturally relevant event that most fans though was a once-in-a-lifetime deal (and they were right in retrospect), you're going to have a lot of confusion and celebration on the floor. Since the NYSE depended on actual human beings at this point, not computers, and things throughout New York City went into a frenzied mode after the Dodgers won the Series, it makes sense that the Exchange would have difficulty functioning. This all occurred during a bull market period as well, basically - in 1949, the market went into bull market mode, and it lasted for eight years - so things were already busy and frenzied at times.<br>  <br>  It was a great moment for baseball, for Brooklyn, and honestly, a very cool moment in American culture. It was one of the greatest World Series ever, in the biggest city in America, when baseball overshadowed all other sports.|`|2wgEsVmsaa	Brooklyn back then had even more fans than the Cubs, and they weren't at all insincere. The event was tantamount to the first man on the moon. No free agents or million dollar contracts back then.|`|zdQgOzYXaa	The Yank's had just spend billions of dollars on free agents and the stock brokers could not handle not winning.  They also knew that Brooklyn was going to move to LA shortly (the town was moving, not the team) and they went crazy about winning.

But a lot of what happens inside the ring ....is real and the wrestlers do get hurt and some even get injured. For whoever said that about 80% of the blood is fake...then they need to get better informed! Most if not all of the blood is REAL. Sometimes the wrestlers even get bloodied and it was NOT suppose to happen.

The caps are a hint.|`|0TAld46gaa	Its like a physical soap opera<br>  Everything you see has been planned by the WWE staff<br>  a few wrestlers adlib there lines for example the Rock was great at that. The injuries are real and the blood is real.|`|8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	Professional wrestling is a show, not professional sport like baseball or football. Wrestlers are for sure highly trained athletes, the risks involved are very real, many injuries absolutely real but unintended. In all other professional sports, aggressing the referee would get an athlete suspended for a long time and cause them to lose the match. In pro wrestling, wrestlers can knock out the referee, throw him out of the ring, go down 2 at a time on a single opponent with their manager helping as 3rd, knock out the opponent by smashing a chair on his head, and when the referee makes it back into the ring, declare them winners. So it's common sense to admit that's it's a pre-arranged scenario.|`|EAZv468Xaa	Everything is predetermined. The story lines are fake. Some of the punches you see are fake, but the physicality of the slams and the dangerous moves are real.

LIKkt8djaa	For what style riding are you looking to get into?.<br>  <br>  Freeride: longer in length, and semi-directional. Moderate to stiff in flex. Used for long, fast turns in various types of snow from groomed hard-pack to soft powder.<br>  <br>  Freestyle: Generally shorter in length with a Semi-directional or twin-tip shape. Moderate to soft in flex. Incorporates a deep sidecut for quick/tight turning. Used in the pipe and in the park on various jumps and terrain features including boxes, rails, and tables.<br>  <br>  All-Mountain: A hybrid between freeride and freestyle boards. The 'jack of all trades, master of none.' Normally directional in shape with either a twin or directional flex. Moderate in flex for various types of terrain.|`|JThgHiaoaa	As a beginner, you probably wont be going super speeds or jumping onto anything. I would suggest anything from a 145-150 length board.|`|MFI0V2GBaa	I'm about 5'2 and ride a 140. I ride all park so it's a little shorter than I need. So I'd say for you're size and weight a 140-144 should be perfect, keep it on the shorter of that end if you'll be doing alot of park, and the longer end of that like a 144 if you're going to be doing alot of free riding and what not.|`|HVpeJzM4aa	i'm not a girl but i do know snowboard sizes...and unlike most of the noobs that answered your question...you being a beginner has nothing to do with how long you want your board, nor does it matter what style of riding. My park board and my mountain board are both 165 and if you ask any real pro who knows about snowboarding...it's all about weight...flex, and boots. <br>  <br>  So...it does depend on what type of riding you want to do BUT only for how much flex you want on your board. As for your weight...i'd go no lower than a 141-2...143 would probably be optimal, and anything taller would only allow you growing room and help you pick up speed when u get better. <br>  <br>  Here's some advice on type of board:<br>  if you ONLY ride park...get a flexible board<br>  if you only ride the slopes...get a very stiff board<br>  and if you do a combo...you can get away with a mid-flex but i suggest just getting a park board seperately...|`|qqt0GTW8aa	I'm 5'2"  & 115lbs.  My park board is a 143 and my all mountain is a 145.  I know your height and weight range are in those sizes for the boards I have which are a K2 Va Va Voom Rocker 143 (park) and K2 elixer 145 (all mountain, this one is a guys board but I recommend a women's board and bindings).<br>  I would recommend getting an all mountain board unless you know that you want to only do park etc.
0uONmqYCaa	I'm assuming that you're in a keeper league, as otherwise you wouldn't be asking a fantasy baseball question in February (either that, or your league schedules its draft WAY too early).  I'm going on the keeper assumption here.<br>  <br>  In this trade, it looks like you're getting more than you're giving -- Beltran and Crawford are better players than Wells (in decline) and Young (still getting his head screwed on straight).  Verlander is still making the transition from being a thrower to a pitcher; he desperately needs to learn to control his off-speed pitches.<br>  <br>  If the other guy made you this offer, take it before he changes his mind.  If you made it and the other guy turns it down, try upgrading the pitcher from Verlander to Vazquez and see if it helps.|`|PjFd29pHaa	I think this is a even trade, but hard to tell as of right now, where spring training is starting up|`|91vuNupCaa	I say go for it.

sLVGdCOTaa	I'm saying Florian also, Penn currently is wasting his time and energy making up excuses for the embarrassing fight he just lost, and if his training (or lack of) is like the GSP fight then we can expect an even shorter fight, I also think KenFlo is more focused, (If Penn can't get in good shape for the biggest fight of his life then what makes anyone think he will for this?) Unless some life changing event happens, BJ will be BJ, and that means relying on his natural talents without focusing on training.|`|SM6qHDKeaa	i really do like florian. he seems like a nice guy and works really hard to win fights. however, i think he just doesn't have the durability or the technical striking that penn possesses|`|VCzsfVM5aa	i like ken flo as well, but i thinks penn will take him down by submission if not by decision.|`|SUlkDzn3aa	Penn will kill him.|`|AXNowGPyaa	It's hard not to pick Penn. He crushed Sherk who pretty easily beat Florian. That was awhile ago and Florian is a very bright athlete who seems to continually improve. I wouldn't say it is impossible that he can beat Penn, but I think it is unlikely. Especially considering the focus Penn is going ot have after losing a fight he thought he would win.|`|ly6R5qICaa	Penn hes probably training really hard after that reality check from GSP.

KenFlo is known for his skills in BJJ, but for the first time, he is  fighting someone better than him at his own strength.  Besides, BJ would prefer to strike with Florian, who isn't the best striker.  Florian will likely go for takedowns, which will be hard against Penn's flexibility.  This will waste a lot of energy and allow BJ to chip away at Florian on the feet.  If Florian does take Penn down, BJ will likely jump right back up to his feet and resume striking.<br>  <br>  Also, BJ beat up Sean Sherk without taking a punch.  Sean Sherk beat Florian, but that was a while back.<br>  <br>  I predict BJ by 2nd Round TKO.

I'm a skateboarder, so I personally prefer skateboards way more since theres a way bigger range of tricks to do once you've become very good at it and have been skating around for a while, but if your looking to just ride around having fun once in a while, I'd go with a ripstick.|`|OrvTG44laa	In my opinion, no.

My suggestion would be to wait till you are older, smarter and more mature before making such weighty descisions.<br>  <br>  If you were TRULY a Yankees Fan, the thought of swapping over to a sox fan would not even cross your mind.

No real Yankee fan would ever switch to the Red Sox, its just not allowed.  And I don't mean it as a knock on you or anything.<br>  <br>  As for what you said, your reasons, most are actually good reasons.  The blind ignorant defending of the organization, well thats just something Yankee fans do, which is one thing that tells me that you were never a real fan.  <br>  <br>  One thing you were wrong about, was the firing of Torre.  They didn't fire him.  His contract ran out, and they offered him a low contract, less than he was making before, but had a lot of incentives in it, so he could make big money if they won.  Torre took it as a slap in the face, saying he's never missed the playoffs while with the Yankees, he's won world series', and he's never needed "motivation" to do well before, and giving him a low salary incentive laden deal is pretty much saying, we only want to pay you if you win.  And, in all honesty, thats no way to treat one of the best managers you've ever had.<br>  <br>  I hope you get more enjoyment out of the game being a Boston fan than you previously did as a Yankee fan.

In the sixties it was Katate, the Seventies had B. Lee so Kung Fu was the best of the best.  Aikido and Kempo were the unstoppable arts of the 80's and 90's thanks to Seagal and Speakman.  Even Muay Thai got real representation from Tony Jaa.  Now we are in the Age of MMA where UFC wrecks all.  Whats next?|`|TnTXGNyMaa	haha ok the ufc fighter would destroy a regular person in a street fight... people here are not thinking. What makes you think a UFC would use ring rules in a street fight? A UFC fighter would not use rules on the street either. A lot of people think that mma training and UFC fighters would not do good in a street fight because the other chumps dont use rules...a ufc fighter would not either guys. Fighters are more trained, more conditioned and have way more experience taking down people... trained people. Street means no rules...which applies to the UFC fighter too.|`|ejG20JfAaa	even a below average uFC fighter could whup an experienced streetfighter.|`|zJC18FtAaa	ufc fighter|`|AeDUFMDDaa	yes|`|apr9gsgjaa	if the street fighter would have a knife what would the mma guy do grapple his enemy to death?

f3084bd62a52bf53fb3975f82c042565aa	Several semi pro's have told me they began in there back yard. They would let out an amount of line that looked like the average cast, then put tape on the spool, then real in the line. This help prevent backlashes until you get a feel for casting. If you were to backlash, it's alot easier and quicker getting them untangled. As you get better, take the tape off and have at it. Just a suggestion I received from some tournament anglers.|`|aDNdND6oaa	Tie on a 1/4 to 3/8 sinker and go outside!!  You can set up buckets or coffee cans and try to land in them.  This will help with just about every type of casting, flipping, you name it.  When I was a kid, we played this for quarters.|`|aEadwhXQaa	Practice on the water if you can.  If not place some hula hoops on grassy area and cast into the hoops.   Also a good exercise is to tie a hula hoop onto a broom stick and cast through it like it was an opening through trees or brush.  <br>  <br>  Tip:   reels cast easier if the crank is up and the spool vertical.
NnsizqH2aa	Ninjutsu does still exist, but it cannot exactly be practiced openly. It never has been an art that could be practiced and trained publicly, for obvious reasons. You open a school that openly teaches all those skills today and the FBI and ATF will be parked on your periphery in no time.<br>  <br>  What many people fail to understand is that many of the more famous schools of modern arts STARTED as Ninjutsu clans. The Fujibayashi of Jujutsu fame were famous as ninja adepts long before they switched to the less dubious art title. Izumi-ryu Kempo comes directly from Ninja dakentaijutsu, and is only one generation removed from Takamatsu Toshitsugu (the last publicly accepted ninja grandmaster), who named the current GM of the kempo art). Ninjutsu has many sub-specializations, to include Jutaijutsu (Jujutsu), dakentaijutsu (Kempo) and many, many weapons specialties, even the use of firearms (teppojutsu).<br>  <br>  Traditionally, each family had TWO appointed head-masters at the same time, which is the source of much political strife in the martial arts. One master would be the true leader of the style, while the other would basically teach quietly in a separate place, keeping his affiliation low-key until something happened to the more public leader. This can easily be confirmed. Therefore, you should never find an MA tree of Japan that follows a straight line.<br>  <br>  For instance, in one book on the traditional systems taught by Masaaki Hatsumi currently, it shows that Gyokko-ryu split into at least 4 separate and distinct groups in the 16th century. Each of those groups/ schoos were started by different students of Sokyokkan Ritsushi, and they fully represented a total of 6 known arts that have survived to this day (Gyokko, Gyokushin, Gikan, Hon Tai Gyokushin, Koto and Izumo). That's 6 different lines that split from one man!<br>  <br>  In the same reference, the author mitakenly revealed the lineages of each of the nine schools recognized today, to include the birth-years and death of most of the GMs. In doing so, he revealed that often there were large gaps from one generation to the next, periods of 20 to 50 years. One gap spanned over 70 years, which was longer than most masters would have lived during that time, The only way to accept that those schools are still legitimate today is to understand that each school has more than one line or group in its lineage. <br>  <br>  It must be understood that ninjutsu has a vast and colorful history, one that stretches across all of the classes and traditional vocations. Some ninja became police, while others became bandits (and the same can be said of samurai). Some became professional warriors and some retired into quiet lives as farmers or merchants. yte, their arts (a source of great pride for these men) were often passed on to friends and relatives. So, no single and clear-cut presentation of their history can be accpeted as the total truth.<br>  <br>  Some will tell you that none of the Koga clan styles continue today. Yet, since the Battle of Tensho Iga no Ran took place in Iga, it would be more likely that all of the Iga clans would have been wiped out... but we find that some small groups escaped to other parts of Japan and to the Ryukyu islands. The number of Koga families more than doubled that of the Iga families, and they did not wait around for a military massacre before they started scattering to the winds. Therefore, the Banke-ryu still exist today, teaching both Iga and Koga systems. (Not to mention that the still-practiced and publicly-known Koto clan formally run by Momochi Sandayu started out as a Koga style, a fact that is recorded in their lineage and history).<br>  <br>  Now, although many schools have changed names over the centuries, this does not mean that they have stopped practicing all of the old ways. Katori Shinto ryu is only one of many styles that is not called ninjutsu that still holds all of the same methods as ninjutsu. Takenouchi-ryu Jujutsu at one time was not considered to be "pure" Jujutsu simply because it included knife-throwing in its basic teachings. Therefore, it is very hard to put a hard name on what a general art should look like, by any name.<br>  <br>  Yet, men wanting to be the ONLY practitioners will claim that a whole 400 year old system died in a single car crash. They will tell you that a man who taught for over 40 years somehow crammed every student he ever had into one vehicle, and that they all died together. You could not sell that crap on the worst B-movie ever made, but that's what they've being trying to tell us for over 20 years.<br>  <br>  You want to know if someone is teaching the real thing. You have to study up as much as you can, and actually train with a few people. Most certainly, you will be surprised by what you will find, and will likely change your opinions.|`|C0sT0PPyaa	one word----two words|`|UHTcpdkVaa	Unless my teacher was a 5'-0" talking rat named Splinter - I have to admit I would be highly suspicious of their credentials.  Just as I would be suspicious of taking a class in Mafia Hit tactics...<br>  <br>  Not saying that some people claiming to teach ninjitsu aren't good at what they do - but many are not, and they have hurt that branding.<br>  <br>  Ok, I'll admit I'd be pretty suspicious of Splinter too :-)|`|AA11171398	Ninjutsu is seen as a 'no-good' martial art, because it is the art of deception. Martial arts is supposed to be unity and strengthining the mind, body, and soul. Ninjutsu is literally the art of sneaking into someone's house at night, killing them, and vanishing before anyone knew you were there.<br>  <br>  Because ninjutsu has been outlawed in Japan, there are no teachers that would be willing to teach in america. But just because it is outlawed doesn't mean it isn't practiced still. People use moves and techniques from ninjitsu, but I doubt there are masters around today.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	In my honest opinion I believe that Ninjutsu has been given a bad rap. Although some of it may be warranted because there are several false teachers out there it honestly comes down to what you, as the martial artist, want out of your art. If you like Ninjutsu then do it...if not then dont. It is really that simple.<br>  <br>  Ninjutsu was never a martial art in its own right anyhow. It was comprised of what ever group (the ryu) had learned. There are several martial arts with in the real Ninjutsu systems and it is important to remember that clans were classifieds as Ninjutsu clans (or villages). <br>  <br>  I have studied traditional Karate for 31 years but even I was drawn to learning Ninjutsu back in the 1980's. I never attained any rank status because I just attended seminars but I found some very useful things from my studies and enjoyed them because I am open minded. In all reality there does not exist a superior martial art but once a student attains a certain level within an authentic art (10-15 years of dedicated study) then they can contrive all useful things from other arts which is only more beneficial.|`|5KjvNg2oaa	one word- scott morris|`|4l2dwYTdaa	Don't listen to the female that said that ninjtsu has been outlawed in Japan! She obviously has not done any research.<br>  <br>  Both the Bujinkan and the Banke Shinobi-den exist openly in Japan, with both of them openly teaching ninjutsu. Lord only knows how many other school are out there, teaching the same sets of skills under different names, like Katori Shinto ryu.<br>  <br>  The first record of ninjtsu being applied in Japan was in the 6th century, in service to Prince Shotoku. That was before most of the more famous arts of today, like kenpo and kenjutsu, even existed. Aikido did not even come around until after WW2, people! But, you're going to tell me that a 1400 year old art has completely died out!<br>  <br>  Look in the book, the "Secrets of the Samurai." They've got like 10 pages devoted to ninjutsu... and every single one of the family styles listed in that book is still around today, most of them currently falling under the leadership of Masaaki Hatsumi.<br>  <br>  For my money, I know that ninjutsu still exists. We have several schools and instructors down here in Louisiana (most of them cops or military men), with one guy performing moves with such power and ferocity that he would likely not be accepted by schools claiming any other art. He can take an aikido-like lock and literally disconnect a man's hand at the wrist... something you won't be finding any aikido guys doing, to be sure.<br>  <br>  Look around. If you look close enough, you'll be surprised by what you'll find.|`|kWRREDEQaa	I disagree with all those that say that ninjutsu is not its own art just because it blends together elements from prior arts. If that's the case, then most of the Shaolin and Kung Fu arts would not be considered martial arts on their own.<br>  *<br>  Tong Lun (Mantis) kung fu blended together elements from other arts. So, does Ying Jao (Eagle Claw) and Bak Hok (White Crane). Are you saying than none of those arts are real MAs?!<br>  *<br>   Arts that have been around for hundreds of years have built on arts that came before them. That's called "progress", ppl! Progress! --- It also happens to be like the Asian way, ripping off of others and trying to do it better.<br>  *<br>  So, I'm with the guy that gave all those different ninjutsu resources. Ninjutsu is an art in its own right. It may have gotten a bad rep, but that was the work and intent of nobles from long ago. We are still suffereing today from the blinders and misinformation perpetuated by men from hundreds of years ago.<br>  *<br>  One history book I read said that this guy Nobunaga went out of his way to try to destroy ninjutsu as an influence among the ppl. He literally had Buddhist temples destroyed and introduced Christianity there to reduce the influence that Buddhists (long known for supporting insurgency, especially since the rise of the Shaolin) offered to the ppl and the ninja. Strange that Nobunaga was killed by a man that was believed to have been trained in ninjutsu, a man that was literally living under Nobunaga's nose as one of his advisors.<br>  *<br>  They had this "sword hunt" thing there also, trying to outlaw weapons in the hands of civilians. All this before and after the ninja massacre that this bald guy up there is talking about. (How do you call an assault of 50,000 soldiers against 5000 civilians a "battle"? You can't.)<br>  *<br>  Plus, if you look at one book by Tunner or Turner or Turnbull (I'm thinking it was Turnbull), there were actually commissioned painting of ninja as rapists and shadowy killers. They showed the men in black that is famous today, although official sources have revealed that outfit as having been worn by stage-hands (real assassins wore regular clothes under something they could discard quickly, allowing them to quickly blend into a crowd). Those paintings were paid for by wealthy men of the time. They were never the protrait given by the ppl of that time, but by those with money and power to oppress others.<br>  *<br>  So, what we see is that there was this intentional smear campaign to reduce the poular support of the ninja clans of that time, which were scattered about in nearly every major village and town. You might compare it to the American skirmish attacks that preceded the American Revolution.<br>  *<br>  Do your research, ppl. The info is all out there. With a little reading and lot of personal reading-between-the-lines, you can find something closer to the truth than just what is commonly presented.|`|u1QwgWHnaa	I think the principles of ninjutsu are very very effective, but the people who practice it are not really fighters or warriors, whatever you want to call them... the main problem is the training... I practiced ninjutsu, greek-roman wrestling, sanda wushu, kickboxing and I have met many fighters, but at those ninjutsu classes...let's just say I was very disappointed. They don't concentrate their training enough on physical qualities, but only on techniques that are like in karate. Any good fighter knows that you can not win only by technique...
xgD5cUP6aa	You need to watch football games whether its NFL, NCAA, or High school.   It teaches you alot.  Also buy a football game like Madden or NCAA it will teach you the basics of plays and positions.  To get ready for the body part of football you should pick a position you think you may  <br>  like.    Good workouts to get ready for football would be push ups, sprints, JUMP ROPE (gives you great foot work which is a big plus), and basic weight lifting.   From the way you describe your body type I would put you more at Defense End or Line Backer.  If you played offense id say Full Back or a Back up Running Back(depending on how good of teamates you have).  The biggest thing to learning is playing so go out and play back yard as much as you can just dont get hurt.  Going from no pads to wearing pads is a big step but you have to learn how to play without them first.   <br>  Hope I can help!  Good Luck!|`|uu6JYenAaa	Running always helps.  Get into a regular schedule of running.<br>  <br>  Weights, push ups, etc will help with strength training.<br>  <br>  The plays will differ from grade to grade and from school to school.

KydnrU5raa	I think they can all share the blame, and it changes every game. Sometimes AI cant make any shots, and still takes TOO many! Dumars made the trade. I do not know much about curry, but he seems like a coach that is scared of the paint. Rip does his share well, but he sometimes misses those wide open shots or a critical shot that the game depends on. RASHEED! He has been terrible! He is obviously the main cause of the pistons downfall. He has a bad attitude, he turns games into his own 3 point contest, he gets the technicals, whenever the pistons are losing, he does not try. He makes the occasional 3 ball though. Heck, his attitude made us lose the ECFs last year! and stuckey, sometimes he has great games, but on ones that he does not do well when he is shooting, we always seem to lose. He is still improving and is a brilliant player who can penetrate well.<br>  <br>  i hope we get some good stuff in 2010! DEEETROIT BASKETBALL!!|`|Ez0z7Of3aa	Dumars mainly then Curry maybe a little.<br>  Dumars shouldn't have had made the trade. I know he says that he's looking forward to 2010 but seriously don't over look the present. Why prepare for 2010 if you could win the championship now!<br>  <br>  Curry: I don't know really. But there is something wrong with his coaching style. I mean you have the 2 of the best scorers in the league and you can't utilize them. <br>  <br>  I can't really blame the players because they are doing their best to win the game. Iverson is discovering the Piston's style and the rest of the team is still adjusting to the new coach and the new player.

3nuLhoviaa	well a beginner is someone who hasn't played disc golf that much. You know some one who doesn't know the difference between anhyzer, and hyzer. overstable and under stable.you  can hrow what you want to but if you haven't been playing more that 4 months your a beginner. Now a champion boss is the fastest disc gof disc on the market as of ocober 08'. at a rating speed of 13. i have been throwing for over two years and still cant reach my potential. i have a t rex with a 12 speed. and i throw a sl with a speed of 7 sometimes farther. you have to be experienced to throw those high speed discs far. you should be able to toss a boss like almost 500 ft. you should start with a disc around 7-11 speed. if your new. let me know how it works out. my first driver was a innova valkrye. it was great.|`|UOABEe5laa	What is considered a beginner for disc golf? <br>  <br>  Look I'm reading a very good e-books that talk about this golf rioja taken by curiosity and was really interesting because I spoke to you all about golf. <br>  <br>  only I can help with that. <br>  <br>  because I'm not very expert te dejo ok the page header to see if you encourage ...<br>  <br>  "This publication walks you through everything you ever need to know about Golf, from the total basics to the advanced tips and techniques that will give you the confidence to play Golf as it should be."

467c6a1ef0b927f7c3823f5d20b09fd5aa	Most gloves they sell in sporting goods stores are not of good quality. The majority of them, even if they are Everlast are made of vinyl. Go online and shop at ringside.com or titleboxing.com. They sell good quality leather bag gloves under 50 bucks. You don't need to buy training gloves or competition gloves because, as you say, you're just going to be working on the heavy bag. All gloves are generally one size (gloves for women are smaller). They will fit snug at first but the leather does stretch and the gloves will get "broken in" with use. I will also suggest you buy Mexican style hand wraps. They are slightly elastic and will give you a good wrap. If your hands are on the small side try 120" - 160" wraps they should be able to give your hands the protection they need. The quality you will get for the money you spend buying them online will offset your concern about not being able to try them on. I've bought many training and bag gloves online and the fit, for me, has never been a concern.|`|CDeZOLmgaa	Don't use boxing gloves for the bag, youll just ruin the gloves, buy bag gloves, there thin and filled with foam and will run you 20 to 30 dollars at walmart.|`|Jsy1xsL1aa	Shut up gay lord.|`|N5VyF5Pxaa	buy twins gloves 8oz, i used them for bag work.|`|qhdBG8Shaa	in the boxing gloves you tried on at least one of them should of had a small bar in them. that bar is there for you to hold on to it when you swing at the bag. if you dont hold on to that bar its a greater possibility to break your wrist. thats why you cant swing too hard. if there is no bar then i dont know what to say about that but to be careful on how hard your swinging. you have to know how to hit the bag properly so you can lessen the chance of a broken wrist. You can go to modells and ask for a pair of supportive everlast gloves that fit you. everlast works and it last long.
BD78ZzYkaa	No they are not.<br>   And if you don't like the races switch the channel.<br>   There's always Golf?<br>   No I am an old guy, and I do remember the old days. I saw my first race at Seakonk Speedway in 1954 in case you don't know where it is , it's in MASS. And no insult was intended if you were offended i am sorry. but I do know and love the old short tracks and am a frequent visitor to them here in SO.CAl. And even while Stationed back at Lejune in N.C. when ever I could i went to the surrounding tracks as often as possible.|`|sn4zl0Riaa	What the heck were you smoking to make additional comments like that?!? Obviously, you've never watched NASCAR enough to know what the races are really like.  Okay, I'll admit...a couple of them were a bit boring last season (that was only b/c NASCAR mandated a change of tires every 10-20 laps), but you obviously didn't see 'Dega last year (that huge wreck that Edwards caused towards the end of the race). And it's obvious enough that you didn't watch Daytona a couple of weeks ago (hello, Dale and Brian with the Big One)!!<br>  <br>  Okay, all I have to say about the golf comments is this: NASCAR is helluva lot more exciting than watching golf!|`|DjjUe4MBaa	No not all races are that boring. It just seems as though states that aren't in the south just can't build decent racetracks, i.e. Michigan, Kansas, to name a few. The only exception I can think of is Dallas. <br>  <br>  Btw, I take offense to the term "girly sport." Why is everything that is seen as weak and soft referred to as "girly?"|`|0829df852fa519b2e4acb82ff156a13eaa	Great name!<br>  <br>  Not all the races are that boring, but I have slept through many at California. I am a California native and my dad helped build that speedway, but it is my least favorite track. Even Jeff Gordon has said he could fall asleep in his car during that race. It is even worse than Kansas and that is pretty low..|`|VQHGqYXvaa	No they are not.<br>  And if you don't like the races switch the channel.<br>  At 64 years young i do remember the small short tracks .This is not 1960 anymore it's 2009 times are a lot faster now . AND I THINK BETTER TOO.<br>  <br>  At my age watching two snails crossing a highway  is still a good race !!|`|a8EndhDmaa	No California and Michigan are the same and kinda boring <br>  watch bristol or richmond they are both exciting<br>  las vegas will be better high bankings good speed|`|yt4PN1R4aa	I have better things to do than listen to this crap.

Michigan comes to mind.  I had nothing to do with the expansion of NASCAR racing.  I'd love for all the races to be back here in the south where they belong.<br>  Here's your problem:  you're expecting beer to make it more entertaining.  I recommend hard liquor.  Crown Royal works for me.  :  )|`|c3tADklmaa	You should put this in the Horse Racing dude, like what Godsmack said. You shouldn't be drunk an be here.|`|a4LWildhaa	Yes they are now. Yesterday is representative, as was the Daytona 500: It's all about $$$ now-they KNEW rain was going to happen last week as well as yesterday.

I won't be going anymore. <br>  <br>  "It's a mileage race"<br>  "Aero push problem"<br>  "Aerodynamics"<br>  "Dirty air"<br>  "Kenseth was out first ahead of Gordon in the pits, lead the final 35 laps to win." <br>  <br>  Yeah, that's racing.

But I like the big tracks and the small ones, restrictor plates too.  True, the COT has decreased some of the excitement at ALL the races, but it is for the safety of the drivers.  Safety wasn't quite as important in the past, nor was the technology available.  The price we fans pay for the safety of our favorite drivers.  Sorry you are dissapointed.<br>  <br>  *SHOQ*|`|3e1ELOgnaa	Its interesting enough to ask a question about it aint it.  I dont know of any pathetic little girly sports that involve around 800 horse power.  The race I saw Sunday night was a great race.  Maybe you need to get your eyes checked or just turn the freakin channel and find some other joint to stink up.|`|XNdDrXAzaa	I'm sorry, but I don't drink beer while I watch a race. Maybe that's why it's boring for you. Try watching it sober. Your missing out of the technical aspect of the sport. You can't just "lay" there and expect for it to entertain you. I get dizzy just thinking about it.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	I thought it was a decent race.  It was really good by California standards.<br>  <br>  A lot of short track racing is boring.  Martinsville sucks.  I wouldn't care if NASCAR never raced there again.|`|l4ZQchFkaa	Fontana can get pretty redundant, I been there twice, and watched every Nascar event ever held there.

The difference between you and I is that I am bright enough to figure out the difference between the two sports. Are all football games exciting???? Sort of like watching a 3-3 game going into overtime and nobody can manage to score (Yes, Donovan it can happen) If you don't like NASCAR; so what who cares. We have plenty of fans without having to explain the whole concept to the likes of you. Either watch it and try to understand it or watch reruns of the NFL all off season on the NFL channel. Life is too short to be so short sighted.<br>  <br>  Peace<br>  <br>  Oh and ask a "real wide receiver" Randy Moss how boring it is!!

1CtG3tjAaa	Good and cheap usually dont go together. You cant skimp on good horse training. Find a Natural Horsemanship trainer in your area, search online. You first should speak at length with the trainer about your horse. Make sure they communicate well with you and if you feel at all weird about them dont send your horse to them. Get a plan with the trainer and make sure you are part of the training. Even though you are young, a good trainer will demand you be there to watch and see what is going on. Interview prospective trainers and do not take shortcuts or you will pay for it in the end.|`|D1beU6MPaa	Hi Kenna,<br>  The best thing for you to do is call some of the stables in your area and ask for references for trainers. Explain to them the problems you are having and what you want to accomplish. They should be able to help you find just the right person to help you. But you may want to get your parents involved with this. Good trainers do charge fees, and your parents would best know what position they are in to hire a good trainer. Good luck|`|8lsBBK62aa	Dandy Nicholls can turn a bad 'un into a good 'un but he don't come cheap no more.

v5MP0KJ8aa	The top 4 in the ACC would beat the top 4 in the Big East, hands down. The ACC is far more competitive from top to bottom than the Big East. The Big East just has more teams. There is no doubt in my mind that UNC, Wake, Clemson, and maybe even Duke can beat any team in the Big East. Besides Marquette, the Big East lacks offensive fire power. <br>  <br>  ACC vs Big East this year,<br>  <br>  UNC 102 Notre Dame 87      <br>  UNC 97 Rutgers 75              <br>  Duke 76 Georgetown 67       <br>  Duke 76 St. John's 69<br>  Florida State 58 Cincinnati 47<br>  Florida Stae 48 Pittsburgh 56<br>  Boston College 82 St. John's 70<br>  Boston College 81 Providence 76<br>  Maryland 48 Georgetown 75<br>  Virgnia Tech 73 Seton Hall 77<br>  Virginia Tech 81 St. John's 67<br>  North Carolina State 65 Marquette 68<br>  Miami 63 UConn 76<br>  Miami 70 St. John's 56<br>  Virginia 77 South Florida 75<br>  Virginia 70 Syracuse 73<br>  <br>  ACC 10 Big East 6|`|mwxKnUleaa	I would say the Big East because they have good teams all over and there teams are not separated by much. I know that they have more teams, but even the lower teams in the Big East have good teams. As for the ACC yes they have good teams but after North Carolina, Duke, Clemson, and Wake Forest you fall of a bit. In the end these conferences are loaded and are clearly were the best teams in the country are.|`|61xjSkboaa	The Big East because they have more teams that if they were in any other conference, they would dominate.  Providence for instance, they are decent in the Big East, but if you put them in the Big Ten, SEC, or even the ACC, they would do pretty good.  The ACC doesnt have many of those teams|`|syPaJXF2aa	The Big East because you have 2 huge players Dejuan Blair and Hasheem Thabeet both very physical and attack the rim you also have 3 top ten teams in that confrence the ACC only has 2 plus the Big East has more rivalries it makes people get more in to the game|`|8qH5q7TGaa	Big East, the ACC is too top-heavy, Big East has competition at spots 1-9 in the standings.

8qZrlz07aa	You state that you are going to be going to college soon.  This is saying to me that you plan to use this bike with a backpack on your back and want to go to and from classes with your bike.<br>  <br>  Let's look at your current bike vs the new bike.<br>  <br>  The somewhat upright position of the Trek along with the front suspension will make your ride much easier on your body. <br>   <br>  With a traditional road bike, like the Windsor Wellington, you are going to be put forward on the bars and the weight will rest on your wrists more.  With the rigid fork (sure the suppleness of steel will help) your ride will be more jarring.<br>  <br>  The gearing on the Trek (13-34) in the back when combined with the triple chainring in the front will give you more than enough gearing to climb any hill on campus with relative ease.  This should make the ride more comfortable when it is really hot.  You don't want to get to class all sweaty.<br>  <br>  The larger tires on the Trek will provide a smoother ride than the tires on the Windsor.  You will pay a penalty in weight, the Trek will undoubtedly be heavier than the Windsor just because it has beefier tires and a triple but you aren't planning to race are you?  If that is the case, neither bike is the right choice.<br>  <br>  One added bonus besides the fact that you already own the Trek, is that since you bought the Trek from a local dealer as opposed to the internet you will be supporting a local business.  I can tell you that dealers appreciate people buying and riding the brands they sell.  If you bring in a well known "Internet Bike" you might not get treated as well as if you brought in a brand the local shop services (at home or at college)<br>  <br>  I would suggest spending a modest amount of money getting your bike, the Trek, ready mechanically for college and put the rest of the money away for beer and other essentials.  If the paint job is a little rough, all the better.  No one will steal a bike that looks like a piece of crap but you know is a good bike.  They will, however, steal what might look like a super nice bike, shiny, new, sparkly, but is in all actuality a piece of crap.|`|Z5xgSATSaa	You hardly ever see road bikes with shifters mounted on the stem anymore, they were popular on cheap road bikes many years ago but because they don't usually shift very well, they fell out of favour. That is the type of shifter on the bike you showed. If only for that reason, I don't think this is a very good bike.|`|CttL3LmBaa	Actually the shifters on the Windsor are Shimano indexed shifters (the 70's used friction shifters). Just placed in an inconvenient location.  That said, your Trek is a better bike.  Save your money as you will need it in college.  <br>  Lock out your fork, spend enough for some narrower, street tread, and higher pressure tires and the Trek will run circles around the Windsor.|`|tFNSPLlFaa	It looks like cheap rubbish which will fall apart after a year or two.<br>  Go to craigs list or e-bay and get a top brand bike like Specialised, Trek,Fuji or Giant second hand, You,ll get some great bargains this time of year.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	You would be better off to keep riding your Trek.

ThhLaA32aa	To be honest with you, that's a hard question.  Unfortunately there is not a uniform flex that all the shaft companies use.  Once you figure out your swing speed, check the shaft brand that you want to hit, and check the swing speeds that are designated for the different models of shafts.<br>  <br>  For instance, I have a pretty slow swing speed, yet I'm hitting a stiff flex on my Cleveland driver.  The Fujikura shaft that's on it now would be like hitting a "regular" flex shaft for different models.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your Game!!!<br>  <br>  PS...you might want to check out Golfsmith's website...they list all the shafts and the swing speeds for the different models shafts in the "clubmaking" section.  Hope this helps!|`|gnemQAKEaa	I have fit over 400+ golfers for clubs. Any time your speed is  over 100 mph you should be trying the X shaft. If you cant, then use a Stiff flex shaft. I know golfers with 110 to 115 mph swings that hit the Tee shot 300+ yards with a Stiff shaft and others with that swing speed do the same with a X shaft. The question is, which flex keeps it in play most of the time for you.|`|z58NVkOnaa	Your chasing your tail on this one.<br>  <br>  Understand that classifications of shaft is a selling point...and "x" to one company will be different than another...it all depends on the makers intentions of the product and their recommended swing speed for each of their shafts.<br>  <br>  You say that you are up to 105mph...I will say that I can obtain the same speed, and yet only use half the effort in my swing.|`|sBrummATaa	more than 105. i would say 115-120+|`|syzMIfLLaa	there is a little more to it than just speed, your angle through the ball and plane have a little to do with it.  105 is still likely going to be a stiff shaft.  A lot of pro's hit stiff shafts and their driver swings average 112-118 (somewhere in there for most guys.)  However, a friend and I have very similar swing speed (116 - 114) and he hits a XX shaft with a XXX tip and I swing a stiff.  He swings a little slower but hits a stiffer shaft and were close in distance.  (both of us carry it 270 - 290)  I hit his club about the same as mine, I really thing that it has a lot more to do with the shafts flex profile (stiff tip, soft middle, etc.) than actual stiffness, and different brands will have different stiffness compared to each other.  The only way to know is to try one and see, but wanting to hit a X stiff can be a bad thing, because you may convince your self that you hit it better, and it may hurt you.  After I had been playing about a year I went to Golf Galaxy and they had a r5 TP with an x stiff shaft real cheap, and I convinced myself I could play it and I hit it a long ways, left.  I'm just saying be careful and go into all equipment changes with an unbiased approach, everyone would love to play the same clubs Tiger does, but it doesn't mean we can.

It was an education for me, too.  I know that our chairs load 6 seconds apart, but I never really thought about ground speed.|`|qyATAaeXaa	Yup. It depends on a bunch of things. We have three fixed doubles at our mountain. Two of them are set to load one chair every 7.5 seconds. The beginner chair loads one chair every 9 seconds.<br>  <br>  Detachable lifts usually move at a higher rate of speed than fixed chairs. <br>  <br>  The speed at which the chair moves around the bullwheel depends on the length of the loading area, how much clearance is needed at the unloading area, if the lift is used by beginners mostly, or if it is in a part of the resort that is mostly used by advanced skiers, and a bunch of other things.<br>  <br>  Edit: Wow...you CAN find anything on Wikipedia. That page was pretty good. It almost looks like a lift-manual. Nice one, jims!|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	There is no standard speed.  It depends on the number of off and on stops, the difficulty of the slopes the lifts feed, the overall distance of the lift and if its a tow-bar, chair lift or gondalla.

If I needed to mask it I`d definitely go with a drink mix before I go with some over priced taste neutralizer.|`|qyATAaeXaa	I never use them. I have no problem with the taste of iodine. It's just extra weight to carry and something else to worry about. I use PolarPure Iodine solution. 2 capfuls per quart...you can hardly notice the taste. Drink mix added once the waiting period is past will get rid of any other remnants of the iodine taste.|`|eaYtGz9gaa	As long as you don't have a health condition (allergy to shellfish or thyroid problem) that prevents you from taking iodine, these tablets are safe and effective.  Keep in mind that they don't work instantanously.  The tablets must be in the water for 20 minutes for full effectiveness.  <br>  <br>  As for taste neutralizers...yes they work and are safe.  For me at least, the water still has a flat taste, almost as if a rock was dropped into the water.  Certainly drinkable, but not a crisp, sparkling taste.<br>  <br>  To improve the taste, I sometimes take those small packets called "to go" that you can find in the grocery store.  A handful will fit in your pocket and they come in several flavors, i.e. ice tea, lemonade, fruit punch, etc.  <br>  <br>  Below is a website to help you prepare for your hike.<br>  <br>  Happy Hiking!|`|FgTkF31iaa	The other option is just invest in a portable water filter    try REI
