6SeWCfUfaa	Yea, when he start getting too exuberant, tell him no, and then put him in this crate for 3-5 mins to chill out.  Puppies want to be with you every second, and putting them into solitary for a few moments when they're not behaving sends a powerful message.  He'll soon figure out that biting feet and ankles lands him in jail and he'll stop.|`|g4EZib5Vaa	Get him more toys he is just looking for something to play with. He needs more playtime and more things to play with.|`|K5HsBuBgaa	Trade him with a chew toy or go get some bitter apple spray

Uy79dKEmaa	You should be able to find an on-line retailer, but the shipping costs would probably be excessive.  You should go to the manufacturers website and see if the have a store locator to find a retailer near you.  Also, there are many brands with similar products.  Perhaps there is another brand that you would suit your cats' needs.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

The superficial fascia remains intact with the overlying skin, while the deep fascia remains closer to, and invested between the muscles.|`|e0gVH6fMaa	Its probaqbly just his mucsles.|`|jM7CyxQzaa	It's only the skin being stretched and pulled over the underlying muscle.<br>  <br>  Horses jumping at this level are really having to put all into it and therefore there are extremes of movement. Skin is like a thick layer over the whole body and it does wrinkle and fold like that - just look at your own arm as you bend it, there is a fold of skin on the inside that just folds almost like fabric.

O35jZ263aa	It's only natural that the mother would try to make the nest as comfortable and safe for her babies as possible.  By shredding it, she can make it into material that's easier to make into a nest, plus it's better insulation when it's ripped up too.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you get the CareFresh brand bedding, since they're cleaner.  It would make things much easier for both you and the rat, since she could carry it in her mouth and transport them easily.  They might cost just a bit more, but that bedding is good quality (very absorbent) and last a lot longer.<br>  <br>  Also, never ever buy pine or cedar bedding, since the oils, strong aroma, and enzymes tend to cause all sorts of problems for animals.  For your baby rats, that could cause serious damages to the respiratory system at such a young age, as well as cause skin problems.  And to add to that, that bedding isn't too warm or soft either.<br>  <br>  Good luck with them. :)|`|3cL7XphAaa	quick a<br>  <br>  she is shreding it because she wants the babies to warmer inside a fluffy cover<br>  <br>  get some animal cottonwool, and try this.|`|URntCINAaa	I cannot stress highly enough NOT to buy the cotton wool type bedding other people have mentioned. This stuff can be lethal! It should be a crime to sell it. If ingested, it can often either get impacted into cheek pouches or into their stomachs and intestines, tighten around areas and kill them. I have heard too many stories of peoples rodents dying this way. Not only that, but with young babies especially, they can get their limbs trapped in them and this can break the delicate areas, if not damage them long term with loss of blood supply. Try woodshavings or Carefresh and as nesting material, plain white unscented toilet roll.|`|ZiYLLh6Iaa	try sawdust, or cotton bedding, the stuff you would use to fill a hamster bedroom with, hopefully the rat will take the cotton and use it as a nest as it is really warm.
zfyOhvnNaa	The good:<br>  Her legs look nice and straight.  The point of hock looks to be right below her rear.  She has a very pretty head and kind eyes.  She has lovely coloring!  (Not a conformation point, but still nice ^^ )<br>  <br>  The not so good:<br>  She has a bit of an ewe neck.  Her forearm is longer than her cannon, giving her less stability and durability.  Her chest barrel good be bigger, as she is she may not have quite the lung capacity, but for your purposes that may not matter.  Her lower leg beneath her hocks looks to be too straight.  It could be the ground, but she looks to be build a bit downhill.<br>  <br>  None of these are huge deals and for what you want her for, they shouldn't matter.  The only place they may hurt you would be the show ring, but for trail and horsemanship I'd say not.|`|UCCAAqpUaa	She's very pretty!  She is a little sway-backed, but I don't know how it would be under saddle.  I think she would make a good jumper!  She has a nice, solid hind end and a short back.  Her pasterns and front legs looks fine, but her back legs are slightly sickly hocked (not a straight line from her hind end down the backs of her cannon bones.)  Other than that shes looks great!  I really like her coloring.  Good luck with her!|`|AA11621713	She's cute but has a short neck and her legs look pretty thinly built.  I think she would be okay for western pleasure and some trail riding and horsemanship.  She's definitely not built to be a hunter or a jumper. Im sure she would be capable of jumping 2', just not very well.|`|upZd0vUPaa	She looks pretty good, but it looks like her legs are spread out a little in the front. You might want to ask for a picture of her legs or go see her in person. Good Luck!|`|AA12138902	one man for one any thing with work|`|qsOvzhKkaa	She is very cute!  It's hard to answer this type of question without seeing her move, but her legs seem to be nice and straight, and she holds them under herself well.  <br>  <br>  A lot of the questions you asked have to do with training.  She's only 4 with very little professional training, so if you are capable, you could probably finish her any way you wanted to.  A level topline will come with experience and balance, but you can see where she naturally holds her head if you lounge her at the trot.  Other things to look for are the length of her stride - is she taking long, flowing steps and reaching her hind legs far under her belly, or is she taking short, choppy strides?|`|Qj9pPMf5aa	well- you're right she could definately use some muscle, and some serious TLC. I think she would make a good western horse, but you might want to get a pre-purchase examine BEFORE you purchase her, if the current owner refuses, don't get her because they are probably hiding something. She could probably jump 2' but i wouldn't go any higher. Good Luck!!!|`|xSj9dVllaa	I have ridden english and western.... more english and i dont know if you are wanting to no if she would be ok to jump. thats what ill answer for you. any horse can naturally jump. sometimes height of the jump will conflict with height of the horse. but she looks like she will be fine jumping two feet or two feet three inches. you will have to see her in person and you can see if she will be ok by lunging her over an X jump.. if she seems stiff you will just need to work smaller jumps.. if the horse hasnt jumped she could just be stiff and needs to get her joints and muscles loose so she can get in the jumping form.
L4rlu2BDaa	You won't catch bird flu from your cat. But if the bird has eaten something it shouldn't it may well pass to the cat. A bird that has swallowed a poison left for mice or rats will make the cat sick and might also kill it. It's best you try not to allow the cat to eat the birds. Put bird boxes high in the tree's for the birds to nest rather then them coming to the ground for food, wrap the base of tree's in wire to stop the cat climbing the tree to get to the birds etc.|`|iDxoM3X8aa	The cat should be fine get a collar with a bell that might help stop the cat from getting the birds.|`|9b0a04d9a5a6e39d0997d773f7b49e09aa	no not dangerous<br>  you are safe from bird flu.<br>  <br>  cat does it cos he can and he is a cat, and that is what they do|`|2qREaMmraa	It is probably good for him to eat them sometimes, ir will build up their immune system.

EAyzCH3Kaa	African Bullfrog vary Interested<br>  <br>  anyway you CAN hold them but its no Recommended Unless for emergency's.<br>  <br>  Larger frogs will eat night crawlers, super worms, and even Pink, fuzzy or hopper mice, depending on size. I have read several articles stating that feeding high fat mice as a staple in the frogs diet can cause fatty deposits to accumulate on the frogs retina over time, rendering the animal blind. This is a condition known as corneal lipids. To be safe, mice should be considered an occasional treat for a well-behaved frog. There is an article on corneal lipidosis in the December 2006 issue of Reptiles magazine.<br>  <br>  But for smaller ones go with the crickets dusted with calcium 2-3 times a week.<br>  <br>  and No with the affection<br>  a frog could get use to seeing you but rarely being handled <br>  <br>  Watch out there bites have bin none to be Nasty!! <br>  and jump all over the place.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|dQj0wMRpaa	General Info <br>  <br>  The African Bullfrog is one of the largest frogs in the world, measuring about 9inches for the male and about 6 for the female. It is rumored that these frogs have been seen 14inches from snout to vent. Although this might seem huge African Bullfrogs but there length is ussually the same as the width. So when these are full grown you have a 9"x9" ball that can bite infront of you. (notice for beggeners) If you need to handle this frog than do it but please don't like pick it up to play with it. The African Bullfrog is ussually an olive green color with an orange throat sac (not a looker.) This is not a very active frog so don't expect it to even walk around enless at late at night. <br>  <br>  Tank Setup <br>  <br>  I use glass aquariums for my reptiles do to the fact they hold heat better than lets say screen. The African Bullfrog can be kept in a enclosure from a 10gallon to a 20gallon. These frogs will not move much so you dont have to make a nice 75 gallon aquarium. <br>  <br>  Substrate <br>  <br>  I prefer bed-a-beast which is ground coconut fibers which expand with water. This is very digestable compared to other substrates. <br>  <br>  Heating And Lighting <br>  <br>  I personally use an undertank heating pad by exo terra. The Temperature should be around 75*F to 85*F. A 50 watt or 75 watt black light will also do well. These frogs do not need UV light but if you have live plants it is prefered. <br>  <br>  Food <br>  I personaly feed mine a variety of foods including full size crickets, roaches, mice, nightcrawers. When a baby it should be feed every day 3-4 crickets full grown I feed it a full grown mouse twice a month and 4 crickets every 2days. But mine is 9.5" :\
SUs4rN49aa	Hey there! My boyfriend just got a cornsnake in September, and we he first got it he would feed it just a pinky a week.. I would do this for a month and then increase it to 2 pinkies a week, feeding them one after the other. Then you'll be able to tell when he should be eating fuzzies based on how fast he grows. You'll want to increase the size of the food in order for him to exercise his jaw muscles, making them look more proportional to his body when he gets older. <br>  <br>  My boyfriend's snake still moves around a lot after he is fed.. must just be a way to help it digest maybe? But yeah, it is perfectly normal!|`|L4rlu2BDaa	It's likely he's just getting use to his new home, leave him to settle for a few days. If he still hasn't settled down then try him with another pinky. Corn snakes are like dogs will eat just because they can, not because there hungary. If he's still wondering around restless in a few days give him another. But he shouldn't need anymore till next feeding!|`|EAyzCH3Kaa	Your Corn snake is fine <br>  But i would of waited till he got fully settled in before feeding him<br>  but it doesn't Really matter your snake is just checking out his new home <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!!|`|CmdipyAcaa	He's nervous in his new surroundings. Try to not handle him for the next three days. What is his cage set up like? Does he have plenty of places to hide?|`|4LybvLryaa	no my snake sometimes goes straight in to her home shelter and over times she will be active for 3-4 hours. <br>  all snakes are different so i would stick to feeding him one a week and he should be a healthy snake... <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|PIwP8DFxaa	He is fine. <br>  If you ever have another reptile, NEVER buy it from a petstore. Always go to a breeder or a reptile show.
atxog9hFaa	You need a heat lamp that's at least 100 watts, the tank, of coarse, a thing to hold water that is no more than and inch deep and around 10 inches wide. Either astro turf or rocks and dirt would work well for the rest of the tank, then, you would want a habitat, I prefer plants, aquatic plants are best for the pond area - just not too many. Fire-bellied toads are poisonous, so the less plants there are in the water, the easier to clean it. <br>  <br>  For a 20-gallon tank, the maximum I would put in that cage for maximum quality of life, would be 6. You would want an even number, so all frogs have a mate, but, if you have just one gender, especially male, you would only want to place 4 at maximum. Male animals in general aren't friendly to each other, unless they were together when you bought them.|`|dQj0wMRpaa	Housing requirements:<br>  Enclosure: A 10-gallon aquarium with a secure lid should be adequate for a pair of fire belly toads. When housing toads together it is important that they are the same size as they can be cannibalistic. A 50/50 ratio of land to water is usually the best way to maintain these animals for breeding. A strictly forest floor type of enclosure is fine if you will not be breeding.<br>  Temperature: Air temperature should be maintained at 68° to 75° F with a basking spot of 74° to 85° F. Water temperatures should be 76° to 78° F.<br>  Heat/Light: Room temperature is usually adequate for fire belly toads. Using heat bulbs can create basking spots. Water temperatures can me raised by using an aquarium heater.<br>  Substrate: Materials like Bed-a-Beast?, sterilized potting soil, or sphagnum moss can all be used as substrate. Gravel is not recommended as the top layer of substrate because the toads may ingest the gravel and cause an impaction.<br>  Environment: Semi-aquatic<br>  Diet: Fire belly toads can be fed crickets, mealworms, and wax worms. Adults have also been known to eat pinkie mice.<br>  Maintenance: If using a forest floor type of setup, spot clean regularly and replace the substrate as needed. Fresh dechlorinated water should be offered daily. If using a 50/50 ratio of land to water setup, spot clean the land portion as above and use a filtration system for the water. Partial water changes are recommended weekly. Be advised to not hand the toads excessively since the oils found naturally on our hands can harm the toads with frequent handling. Whenever handling the toads or cleaning the cage or cage accessories it is always recommended to wash you hands thoroughly when finished.  <br>  <br>  You could comfortably house 4-6 without to much trouble.
WIFKeDBgaa	CHAOS makes good points. However, I've seen some 14 year olds that were very capable of training dogs, and had natural ability. No amount of reading will take the place of experience and the natural ability to "read" dogs. You may not be able to legitimately get a business license, but then again, how many 14 year old babysitters have a license? <br>  I like your enthusiasm..but what you need is "hands on". If there are no kennels around that you can volunteer at, look for a schutzhund club, or some other type of training group. Training side by side with experienced trainers is your best bet right now. You may even earn some cash helping out another trainer...even if it's just exercising dogs for now.<br>  There are way too many people that think the desire, time, reading material, classes, etc will make them a dog trainer....the majority are wrong.  A "master trainer" certificate from every K9 college on earth doesn't mean you can train a dog....trust me, I've had a gazillion of them try to work for me....paper just means you paid a $hitload of money for something to hang on your wall. Just hope you're as good as you want to be...and find experienced people to hang out with.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|P8Q39vA4aa	How many times are you going to ask this? No legally you can not train dogs as a business because you need a license and you can not get one at this age. Plus i really don't know anyone who would take training classes from a 14 year old. You think that if you keep asking this you will get the answer you want to hear so that you can do it. No one will give you the answer you want to hear because that would be negligent of them to do so. Its against the law, wait till your old enough. <br>  <br>  In the mean time volunteer at a local training center as a apprentice and get some more experience. <br>  <br>  Have you put titles on those dogs to prove that you trained well? <br>  <br>  61 pushups means nothing.|`|Bw18seFqaa	you can train your own dogs, and you can offer to help your friends and family with their dogs.<br>  <br>  However you can NOT call yourself a professional, and run a buisiness to get paid for it. You need to go thru some kind of program to become a dog trainer to call yourself a professional. You also need a buisiness licence which you cannot get at your age.<br>  <br>  <br>  Things you can do to earn some money would be dog walking, pet-sitting and picking up poop.
zqVDJxUIaa	You MUST have a FILTER! No filter = dead fish! <br>  <br>  For a saltwater aquarium, you need the following:<br>  -Canister filter (or other high output filter)<br>  -High efficiency lighting (metal halide or pressured sodium)<br>  -Heater, for some types of fish<br>  -Salt (remember to dissolve it in water first)<br>  -A tap water conditioner<br>  -Food<br>  -Fish<br>  -Corals, if starting a reef aquarium<br>  <br>  You don't know what pH means?<br>  Then I highly doubt that you've ever kept a successful freshwater aquarium before...<br>  pH is a measure of the degree of the acidity or the alkalinity of a solution as measured on a scale (pH scale) of 0 to 14. The midpoint of 7.0 on the pH scale represents neutrality, i.e., a "neutral" solution is neither acid nor alkaline. Numbers below 7.0 indicate acidity; numbers greater than 7.0 indicate alkalinity. It is important to understand that pH is a measure of intensity, and not capacity; i.e., pH indicates the intensity of alkalinity in the same way temperature tells how hot something is - but not how much heat the substance carries.<br>  <br>  pH is essential in keeping marine fish, because they are extremely sensitive about water chemistry. Slowly dripping the tank water into their bag is recommended to slowly acclimate them to their new water conditions.<br>  <br>  You DON'T want ammonia,or nitrite. These are two poisonous chemicals, which are the result of decomposing plants, fish waste, etc. Ammonia/Nitrite poisoning is the number one cause of fish deaths, both Marine and Freshwater. You MUST cycle the tank, just like in any freshwater aquarium. For more info on tank cycling, see the following:<a href="http://www.worldcichlids.com/faqs/cycling.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldcichlids.com/faqs/cyclin...</a><br>  <br>  You can buy a commercial ammonia remover, such as Ammo-Lock at your local fish store, or get a filter media which naturally removes ammonia, such as Am-Rid. <br>  <br>  Not to be mean, but you don't SEEM very familiar with freshwater or saltwater. (or freshwater, for that matter) Saltwater needs time and experience to set up and maintain. Saltwater fish are very delicate and expensive, compared to most freshwater species. If you have no clue what ammonia does, or what pH is, you're definitely not ready for saltwater. Keep enjoying the freshwater hobby, and you can switch to saltwater after you've read about the cycling process, how to maintain pH levels, and every other aspect of a successful tank. If you don't do some research first, I can almost 100% guarantee that your fish will not live for long. Just curious... do you keep your freshwater fish in a bowl or vase? I hope not.<br>  <br>  Don't just go and but that adorable clownfish or damselfish in the window... research them first, for water conditions, temperature, and compatibility.<br>  <br>  Setting up a new Marine tank:<a href="http://saltaquarium.about.com/od/startinganaquarium/How_to_Start_a_Saltwater_Aquarium.htm" rel="nofollow">http://saltaquarium.about.com/od/startin...</a><br>  <br>  Maintaining a saltwater tank:<a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?How-to-Maintain-Saltwater-Aquariums---Simple-Step-by-Step-Saltwater-Aquarium-Care-Plan&id=2024999" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?How-to-Maintai...</a><br>  <br>  Basic Aquarium Guide:<a href="http://www.hagen.com/pdf/aquatic/bag.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.hagen.com/pdf/aquatic/bag.pdf</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	Sounds like saltwater is a bit out of your league, stick with freshwater|`|H0fXySX9aa	you are not ready for salt water if you have to ask that question im sorry<br>  salt water is not for beginners<br>  you would be better keeping tropical fish until you learn how to care for them maybe for a year then maybe progress to salt water
NAGiNKFWaa	I am sorry about the loss of your dog.  I don't know if we ever get over the loss of a dog.  I think you are right about things reminding you of your dog, and breaking your heart.  This poem helps me, I really believe my dogs still come around me.<br>  <br>  I stood by your bed last night, I came to have a peep.<br>  I could see that you were crying, you found it hard to sleep.<br>  I whined to you softly as you brushed away a tear,<br>  "It's me, I haven't left you, I'm well, I'm fine, I'm here."<br>  I was close to you at breakfast, I watched you pour the tea<br>  You were thinking of the many times your hands reached down to me.<br>  I was with you at my grave today, you tend it with such care.<br>  I want to re-assure you, that I'm not lying there.<br>  I walked with you towards the house as you fumbled for your key.<br>  I gently put my paw on you, I smiled and said, "It's me."<br>  You looked so very tired, and sank into a chair<br>  I tried so hard to let you know that I was standing there.<br>  It's possible for me to be so near you every day<br>  To say to you with certainty, "I never went away."<br>  You sat there very quietly, then smiled; I think you knew...<br>  In the stillness of that evening, I was very close to you.<br>  The day is over... I smile and watch you yawning<br>  And say "good-night, God bless, I'll see you in the morning."<br>  And when the time is right for you to cross the brief divide,<br>  I'll rush across to greet you and we'll stand, side by side.<br>  I have so many things to show you, there is so much for you to see.<br>  Be patient, live your journey out... then come home to be with me.<br>  ~Author Unknown~<br>  <br>  <br>  I Loved You Best<br>  Author Unknown<br>  <br>  So this is where we part, My Friend,<br>  and you'll run on, around the bend,<br>  gone from sight, but not from mind,<br>  new pleasures there you'll surely find.<br>  I will go on, I'll find the strength,<br>  life measures quality, not its length.<br>  One long embrace before you leave,<br>  share one last look, before I grieve.<br>  There are others, that much is true,<br>  but they be they, and they aren't you.<br>  And I, fair, impartial, or so I thought,<br>  will remember well all you've taught.<br>  Your place I'll hold, you will be missed,<br>  the fur I stroked, the nose I kissed.<br>  And as you journey to your final rest,<br>  take with you this...I loved you best.|`|GSf09ALBaa	The loss of a dog can be very devastating to many people.  You are still grieving after a year.  You know, the last dog I lost was January 26, 2006.  That was over 3 years ago.  Sweetie, I still grieve.  I can't talk about Gator without tears welling.  The pain is not as deep as it was but it is still there and it shall always be.<br>  <br>  Over 25 years of animals I have lost dozens of dearly loved dogs and cats.  Each one is separate from the other, each one holds it's own grief and each one has a special place in my heart.<br>  <br>  Grieving doesn't really stop.  It just tucks itself away and then jumps out at you at different times.  It can be a song, a moment, a name that can bring the tears.  And that does not mean it is not normal.  It means you have a huge heart and dearly loved your dog.<br>  <br>  I find it easiest to just let myself have my 'moments' and remind myself my animals are all doing just fine.  They are whole, with no sickness, youthful and are surrounded by love.  And they will be waiting for me when I cross the bridge.<br>  <br>  Your dog will be there waiting for you.  Bless you.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Just revel in the fact that he must have had such a wonderful life with you. Without you he may have ended up in a shelter, especially if he was a mutt! Thanks to you he was a very happy boy! I'm sure you had to put him to sleep for a reason which means he must be happier now wherever he is. Life does end unfortunately, but that is a fact. All of us die, you, me, and your poor old dog. Just remember he had a good innings. :)|`|56bNLJykaa	I know from experience of having to put two dogs down; one who we had for 10 years since a puppy, and one who was 7 but we had for 3 years. After the second dog I found out about this website and asked a question about him as well, and received many comforting answers. Loosing a dog is hard and heart breaking, like loosing a best friend. The best thing is to just acknowledge that you treated him to the best of your ability (if that is so), and that you gave him a good life, be it short or long. He is in a better place now, and if you can't be strong for yourself, do it for him. Very likely the hardest thing in life is moving on. Good luck and feel better soon.|`|wPD3BGEHaa	sweetie, we had to do that about 7 years ago with our other German Shepherd..I now have another  Beautiful Shepherd who I love with all my heart.<br>  It took me two years before the pain of losing her eased up. Now I can finally think of her with the fondness instead of the pain. you see I was in the room with her when they put her to sleep, I will never ever forget how she looked at me before she went and I still have nightmares to this day and resented that God had made me make that decision instead of just taking her. I never want to go through that pain again.<br>  But it does get easier you will never forget him and the pain doesn't completely go away but it does diminish and get tolerable.<br>  <br>  Good Luck honey and I'm sorry about your baby!<br>  <br>  A good friend of mine got me this plaque with my dogs picture in it:<br>  <br>  The Rainbow Bridge<br>  <br>  Just this side of Heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.<br>  <br>  When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.<br>  <br>  All animals who have been Ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing: They each miss someone special to them, who had to be left behind.<br>  <br>  They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.<br>  <br>  You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face: your hands caress his beloved head, and you look once more into the trusted eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent form your heart.<br>  <br>  Then you cross the Rainbow bridge together.....<br>  <br>  Author Unknown~|`|m16dhfrGaa	I'm just the same.  Maybe we're not normal but this is the way we are.  A lot of people say get another pet, but we know it just won't be the same.  I do believe, however, that if you have so much love for one animal you can probably find some for another, and there are a lot of animals that need rescuing from a dog pound.  You could save another dog from being put to sleep and that might help both of you.  I do know how you feel, and it's horrible.|`|1HLPznZhaa	I feel your pain..I am now 74 years old..I had a beautiful Female German Shepherd that was the best friend I ever had..I had to put her to sleep in Dec. 1979..Thats been 29 years ago.. I have her picture on my desk and even now when I think of her I cry..Her name was Brandy.. I couldn't bring myself to having another .. Now that I live in an apartment it would be too uncomfortable to have another Shepherd..<br>  If I may suggest , Get yourself another puppy..You will be amazed how that will fill a gap in your life that you now suffer..Anyone that would tell you to " get over it " is to be pittied and don't give them a reply..They don't deserve a reply..grieve for your friend as you wish in which ever way you choose... let me tell you something luv..The more we work with people the more we love our dogs !! God bless you .. I hope in time you will feel better...|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I had to put one of my very special dogs down over 5 years ago and I can still get misty when I think of her.  I "control" it by not controlling it.  I allow myself to feel what I'm feeling for a little bit and ... that seems to help.|`|ePt4qPxNaa	Sorry but there is no other way to get over it. Getting over it means something like start thinking that your dog went to a better place, and you should be happy for him/her. No reason to be sad, right?|`|Gb8cl8n2aa	hey please don`t cry and be sad about it..see your dog had to be put to sleep because it was suffering..think it in this way that it is in a better place and much more happier..be happy now..takecare|`|AA12033653	For everyone death hits them differently.

He had always been the love of my life and when he passed away while I was traveling for business, I cried for 3 days straight.. Everytime I would look at his photo or think of him or hear the word Jupiter makes me cry.. That was his name..<br>  <br>  I don't know how I ever got over it but I've tried and like you, I will probably never be over him.. I cry whenever I see my new dog Fred play the way Jupiter used to, the look that Fred would give me like Jupiter and then I'll sit and cry for a while..<br>  <br>  The only advice I can say is try to probably get another dog, shower him with the love you had for your previous dog and it's all right to cry whenever things remind you of him.. He was part of your life and like another human being, you will always love him, no matter what.. Good luck my dear..|`|8U50QEBhaa	i don't blame you for being upset after a year. a sudden death is one thing but optional putting to sleep situations can cause a lot of guilt. especially with someone or a pet you adore. cry, sigh but don't let it affect you in any way. just know you helped your dog and is in peace.consider yourself lucky, my chihuahua is getting old, i love him and treat him like a baby, he has his own personality. he's not even gone yet and I'm grieving already. :/|`|FUlvx89eaa	Heyy, i totally understand. I lost my dog when i was young and it was horrible. i cried for nights to come and whenever i see another owner with a dog it just reminds me of mine. Really sorry about yours. It really sucks doesnt it. <br>  its comforting to know that u did not put him to sleep out of careless behaviour. i can tell that you are a loving and responsible pet owner. <br>  yeah getting another dog wont be the same and even if i said get over it . its easier said than done. <br>  you have to know what you have done was for the best and he is somewhere safe and happy. but he still lives in your heart. and you will always be in his. :D<br>  Cheer Up ! :D|`|AA10609839	It has been two years for me and I lost my friend and companion that I had for 14 years.

I had to have my dog put down when i was in third grade!  I loved her so much, and still think about her and cry about her too, so it's natural.

You will still remember him and cry sometimes, but it gets less often.  I assume he was sick and you had to do it.  Just remember that you gave him a good life, and if he was suffering, you did the loving thing for him.  That is what has helped me the most.
20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	A very small piece once in a while would be okay. Ask your Grandma if she would get your bird some sliced or slivered almonds  from the bulk food department of a large supermarket . A few pieces will make your bird your friend for life,And its a nice snack for you and Grandma . Almonds are a good source of calcium. Feed bird sparingly as they are fattening.
iDxoM3X8aa	Sorry to hear that yes if you feel okey get a new kitten im sure you are ready.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I would get one when YOU are ready.  There is no timetable.  If you feel that you can love another kitten now, then adopt one.<br>  <br>  I will caution you on adopting the same color/sex as Snowball.  Many people do not recommend to try and "replace" by getting one that looks like the one you lost.

YAPEpa5baa	I'm going to third the answer you received.  You want my personal answer, no, no, no, and no!<br>  <br>  Why do people waste their money?  Get a a hamster ball for about $10.  Let the hamster run in that supervised for 10 minutes, plop the stressed hamster back in her cage, and wash the ball out good, cause she peed and pooped in it.<br>  <br>  Leashes are for dogs, some cats, some ferrets, and I've even seen them on iguanas.  Leashes are not a good idea for small pets, like rodents - hamsters, rats, gerbils, guinea pigs, etc.  It's bad enough they have strollers for dogs.<br>  <br>  Where would you even walk your hamster?  Outside?  Do you have any idea how fast some bird of prey can swoop down and eat/grab your hamster leaving you holding one end of the leash, if that?<br>  <br>  You have a smart hamster.  She's even telling you no.  Now if you bought the silly thing at Petco or Petsmart, they have a guarantee on all the things they sell - return it for your money back if you have the receipt, or get store credit for something useful.|`|hdQvbs0naa	To be honest, I think leashes are awful ideas for hamsters. They're prey animals and are naturally skittish anyway. Trying to maneuver them into a leash/harness is just stressful.|`|xyPpruSjaa	All I can say is I agree TOTALLY with Courtney, leashes are probably very stressful for them.|`|oNHtVHzsaa	it can be very dangerous for hamsters to be on leashes. for ur hamsters safety plz dont put him/he on the leash. it's bad for their spine and there are other ways to let them exercise. (like put them on a laundry floor and block off all the wires and let them run around).|`|v3dN1sSaaa	i wouldn't but your hamster on a leash its a sooooo cruel and its very dangerous just get a pet ball and let her roll around in that instead of putting it on the leash its not very nice|`|gTXUcd1maa	Heres your simple answer: YOU DONT want something that walks on a leash? get a dog, hamsters are not meant to be on a leash
kWwgWSSgaa	How old is your Dobermann?<br>  <br>  It could be an overactive thyroid [weight loss is a symptom], which your local vet will be able to test for. One of my Dobermann b*tches had an underactive thyroid [gained weight] & was back to her usual bouncy self after treatment.<br>  <br>  One of my male Dobermann lost weight rapidly [within a period of two weeks] because of aggressive cancer. He had multiple tumours near some of his major organs.<br>  <br>  Do you compete in any active sport with your Dobermann like schutzhund, tracking or agility? If so he may just need an increase in the amount of food you give him.<br>  <br>  There are many benign reasons for weight loss, so try not to worry.<br>  <br>  Hope it all goes well at the vet.|`|8j7FCEOraa	Get him some better food<br>  The food he is eating now may not have enough protein in it.<br>  My dog was on Pedigree healthy vitality. He would never gain much wight, he ate Allot, and eventually he started puking. Turns out Pedigree is like the Mcdonals of dog food. We switched him to something our vet recommended and he has had no problems. He is also very active, and he has gained alot of muscle. <br>  Secondly, if the food is good for them, they will eat less and their poop's will be smaller. The more they keep in their system, the less they get rid of when they poop.|`|AA12126470	Depending on the age of your dog you may need to do a few things.<br>  First if your dog is over a year old you need to have the vet do a blood panel to make sure what the function of all his organs is. Also it will check for things like cancer. Cancer can be common in Dobermans and many loose weight as one of the first symptoms.<br>  They are a very active breed and many need more calories than other dogs. If you are feeding according to the guidelines on the bag of dog food you may need to feed more than what they say.<br>  i have a almost two year old female and she is eating enough for a 100 pound dog and she is only 67 pounds. She could use another 5 pounds of weight. <br>  Feed the highest quality dog food you can afford to feed. That way you will feed less bulk and more digestable nutrition.|`|3uIOlUo7aa	It could be any number of things but all require a veterinary check.  Just because you wormed him with some over the counter worming prep does not mean you were actually affecting the worms he could have - there are a number of kinds of worms and OTC preps don't deal with them all.  Also there are other health issues that could cause this issuel.  Anytime your dog changes like this, physically or personality-wise, it needs to be assessed by a veterinarian.  Good luck.|`|GSf09ALBaa	You don't say how old Blade is (LOVE the name!) but taking him to the vet is a first.  Get a clean bill of health and I would suggest looking into a very good food for his level of activity.  <br>  <br>  I don't know what you are feeding him now but foods such as Wellness, Blue Buffalo, Solid Gold, Innova etc have a higher protein count which is part of what an active dog needs.|`|N89HLv92aa	The vet needs to run some test on him that is the only way to find out what is wrong. Take him to the vet asap. It may be more serious then you think.|`|i33WOzi4aa	Hi<br>  i am currently in this situation with my 2 and a half year old male dobe,,,,who has lost weight in last couple of weeks,,,,and like some of the answers given here ,,,,,my vets concern when he saw him was that the cause can be serious,,,and he had a complete set of bloods done to check for cancer,,diabetes,,thyroid problems,,,,which did come back clear and now checking for digestive probllems,,,,,lack of enzymes,,,etc,,,,,so the BEST thing you can do is go along to your vet,,as i see you are,,,,and get a complete check up,,,,,,i wish you and ur dobe the best,,,,,
f906Ydwjaa	You should sell them for about 25-35 dollars a piece and if chicks 10-15 people pay A ot  more for big roosters like yours.|`|2rXWZkbnaa	if they are still chicks then $3-$5 and if it is a grown bird then $5-$10 each|`|QB0CnrmJaa	5.00-7.00 each.<br>  <br>  Or a dollar lower than what you bought them for .<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)
NAGiNKFWaa	When my puppies are first little, I practice with the leash. In the house, I drape the leash on them and try to call them to me. Outside, I practice in my fenced back yard for about a month before the puppy graduates to the street. I might drape the leash on the puppy and get him to follow me, or drag the leash on the ground and see if he will follow me and try to catch the leash. There are many things in my back yard that scare a puppy, so it is soooo much easier to address, or correct issues when I am in my back yard and not in the street. We just walk laps in the yard and deal with drama as it comes up. Maybe around 3-months-old I might try to clip the leash to the collar, but if there is too much protesting, I drop the leash. They just get better with the leash around 4 to 5-months-old. So anyway, I use the commands "go" when I want to "go" and if the puppy tugs on the leash, I stop and say "wait". It is my walk and we go as fast as I can walk and no faster. If I want to "wait" and look at a flower, change the batteries in my walkman, count to ten, then I do it, it is my walk. When I am ready I say "go" and we "go" again. When the puppy pulls on the leash, I stop and say "wait" and we stop again, even if we just went two steps. I praise the puppy when he is doing good and talk soothing to him and encourage him when he is doing good, so he keeps doing it. It takes several laps of "go" and "wait" until he settles down, and when the walk is over, I make a big fuss and clap and then they get some play time. They don't like the walk at first, but they like the fuss at the end. I have to address "go" and "wait" again the next day, but it won't take me as long to get him to understand what I want from him. I also housesat a dog, and the owner thought he had leash issues, and that dog just didn't like being in front. He walked just fine with my dogs as long as he could be part of the group, but he didn't want to be in the front. If you have a family member, or a neighbor that has a dog that walks well, see if you can practice with them. I also had one dog that didn't like the maroon leash, or the pink one, but did just fine with the blue leash. Sometimes puppies are just puppies.<br>   <br>  I am not sure about distemper, I haven't ever heard of an animal I know getting it.  For our Cavie, we use a shampoo and grooming spray that has coconut oil in it.  We use angels eyes for  her eyes, and we clean the eyes and ears everyday and we comb all our dogs hair daily.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Any dog that has not been vaccinated properly can get distemper and die from it.  And, every dog breed that has not been trained properly and that pulls on a collar will have throat issues.<br>  <br>  There are a ton of things out there you could use that will not put pressure on the dogs throat.  But, nothing will substitute good obedience training.  Get him out to some good obedience training classes and learn how to teach him good leash manners.  Don't go to petsmart, they will tell you to use all the "cheater" devices instead of actually teaching the dog how to walk properly on a leash.<br>  <br>  Daily brushing keeps a cockers coat better than anything.  You can use just about any dog shampoo but the coat will not stay really nice unless it's brushed often.|`|b3ZLY5osaa	all dogs can get distemper get their shots from your vet and we use a haltee on our dog it works well
XvWpLHWKaa	It will kind of look like they're slapping each other and hitting each other and biting but, that's just playing. If they're hissing and growling then, That's fighting|`|goo7zzqWaa	umm...you see them playing|`|4TX26viFaa	If there's no screaming or fur tufts on the floor, then it's 'play', not fighting.  They can roughhouse pretty hard sometimes.
JjS4ARPYaa	Glass cats (get 3, they go best in that number)<br>  Gupies (more females then males is adviced)
203XB6Hzaa	I've never heard of a German Shepard having blue eye...Its possible of course, but i'm guessing rare being that GS's are more common with brown eyes|`|CkecSp4Uaa	No.  The gene for blue eyes does not exist in the german shepherd breed.  It is physically impossible for a purebred german shepherd to have blue eyes.  If you see one with a blue eye or blue eyes then you can bet that it is a mixed breed.|`|FdcWPp48aa	I've seen mixes of GSD's that had blue eyes.|`|ctiKoGGfaa	No, and the correct spelling is PHOENIX|`|Z8AhDCWEaa	No, I have never seen one with blue eyes, and I think that that breed is actually incapable of producing that characteristic. It just isn't in their genetic makeup.
p7swtBYzaa	The only one who can answer this question is your vet - it will depend on the difficulty of getting the surgery done.<br>  <br>  I would imagine a general anaesthetic will be done, I would certainly want that for my dog, this type of thing is painful, if you have ever had a bad nail tear, you know that.<br>  <br>  There are degrees of anaesthesia, some are by injection, others just put over the dog's muzzle for the time the surgery takes.  I am sure your vet will do what is best.  If you don't trust this vet, find another.   Vets do not aneasthetize dogs for any longer than they have to, so I wouldn't worry too much.   Cost will depend on the type of anaesthetic and the duration of it.   General is about 125.- at my vet's, but that would be for spay or neuter - don't think your dog will need to be kept under that long.|`|veDvtYhJaa	We can't answer that for you.  Charges vary from city to country, from one city to another, from one state to another, so any guess we give you will probably be wrong.  Only your own vet's staff can give you accurate estimates of what it will cost.<br>  <br>  As to what anesthetic... again, it depends on your vet's personal, professional preferences, so what any of us things or says is likely to be wrong.  Again, only the staff at your vet's office can give you an accurate answer to this question. -!-|`|7b4cd4909e3fddb3fc14d5677ec83183aa	unfortunately prices vary with every vet, best thing i sto ask for a quote, usually the reception looks on the computer for that op and then will be able to tell you. <br>  Hope your dog will be ok, no reason why him wont, simple op so dont worry.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	I'm not quite sure what you're talking about.  If they're just cutting a torn nail back to the base then they most likely won't need a general anesthesia...in fact most vets won't even bother with a local anesthesia because it would sting as much or more than just doing it and getting it over with.  If it is a torn dewclaw...the "extra" "thumb" that many dogs have on the inside of their foot then you're really looking at an amputation and it will probably require a general anesthesia.  <br>  <br>  As for cost, no one can tell you how much it will cost besides your vet.  I can tell you how much it would cost at my vet, but my vet might be twice as expensive (or more) or half the price (or less).  Veterinary prices vary greatly from region to region (areas with a higher cost of living have higher vet fees because that vet has to pay more to keep their business running and pay their employees a competitive wage) and from rural areas to urban areas (everything's cheaper in the country...but the services might not be as "up to date" as they would be in a vet that operates in a larger city).|`|GT6396BDaa	Most likely they will try to just sedate your dog and give him a local anesthetic and see if they can remove his bad claw.  If the claw is more serious than they thought, they may have to use a general anesthetic and do surgery to remove the claw.<br>  If they use a general anesthetic, it will definitely cost around $125-$150 or so, and that's including everything.  If they just use sedation,  it will cost around $100 or so.  Every vet charges differently.  You can ask your vet for a cost estimate.  Best of luck to your dog.  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|DVDYDaVSaa	It depends on what exactly is being done.  If it's a broken toenail that just needs to be cut off at the nail bed, we will usually give an injection of a pain medication (butorphanol) and a sedative (acepromazine).  If the nail is being amputated (like removing a dewclaw) or the injection doesn't sedate the dog enough, that would be general anesthesia.<br>  As for cost, your vet should be able to give you estimates for whatever they think might have to be done.|`|TYyZwOtlaa	It will be a general anesthetic, if you are at all concerned about your dogs health, you can have a pre anaesthetic blood profile done first to make sure there are no underlying problems before he goes under the anesthetic. It is difficult to say about price, i know our vets seem to be a lot cheaper than alot of them, I think we normally charge between 40 -80 pounds for anaesthetic .|`|H0fXySX9aa	in my experience they give them a sedative then do it<br>  but each vet is different they don't like putting animals under anesthetic unless its absolutely necessary<br>  <br>  if your in the UK which i am a sedative and doing the work will be around ￡70<br>  if they decide to use a general anesthetic then your looking at about ￡100 the anesthetic is what costs the most|`|FdcWPp48aa	As they told you, they will try to do it with only a local anesthetic.  If they are unable to do that depending on how he is acting, they may have to fully put him under.  Will depend on how much work they are going to have to do, and how cooperative your dog is.|`|DV4xyeChaa	most will knock him out... few will mess with an awake dog...|`|Og3vKQeWaa	a claw removal, is done under a local and will cost about ￡75.00..ish|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Ask them when you go in.  They should have given you an invoice of what they were going to do.  If you are worried about anesthesia, you can have an anesthesia test done to see if your dog can handle it.  An anesthesia test is cheap.  Just ask them when you take him in.  I make a list of questions because I get nervous at the vets and forget things.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	The type of anesthesia will be up to the vet and so is the cost. If is pretty hard to quote cost since it varies from state to state, country to country. You need to get quotes around your area.
CkecSp4Uaa	You can try calling your vet or the vet you have scheduled next week's appointment with and see if they have any recommendations for something you can give him at home for pain.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of possibilities here.  Joint pain from arthritis can be common in older large breed dogs.  So can spinal arthritis which can also cause they symptoms you describe.  Sometimes pain relievers and anti-inflammatories can help ease they symptoms.  A ramp with a gentle slope could help him make it off the porch to do his business.  Help him get up if he's having trouble getting up.  Stand next to him and help steady him when he seems wobbly.  Heat can be beneficial for sore joints too, so you could safely try warm compresses (a heating pad or blanket set on low with a towel or another blanket between your dog and the heating element or you could put some rice in some socks and heat it in the microwave...again, use a towel between your dog and the sock) on his hips and spine to see if that helps.  Give him a soft place to sleep.  If you can put a thick foam bed down that would be best, otherwise just pile up as many thick blankets as you can to make a more comfortable bed.|`|JCNEP903aa	I used to be a vet tech. Yes, sweety, he is in pain and needs meds. He is also becoming incontinant as he is losing control due to his age. His whinning is his way of letting you know he's hurting. Be kind and not selfish. It could be hip dysplacia as most larger breeds experience this in their geriatric stages. His going home is soon to be expected. Sorry. I know it's heart breaking as I just lost my 13 yr. old rottie I've had since she was 12 hrs. old. Gulp.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well there could be 100 different things going on here, and without the x-ray, you are not going to know how many issues you are dealing with or what stages the dog is in.  It could be 1 thing or several things.  I carried my dogs when things like this happened, and then I bought a house that didn't have stairs.  You can try to take an old bath towel, put it under his belly, hold an end in each hand, and try and lift him and help him walk that way.  Good luck to you, I have been down this road before, and I am sorry.
Z1ftrUJuaa	People read the ad! He's being LEASED for 250! Goodness. <br>  <br>  I do think he sounds like a nice horse, and it's always great to help out a rescue, but the question is really if you are qualified to ride him. Definitely try him out and see if you and he click, and definitely talk to your parents. My only other concern is that there are no pictures of anyone riding him. Make sure you see some or a video. Also, if you have a trainer, have them look at the pictures/video/whatever and come with you when you try this horse out. <br>  <br>  good luck! he's very cute!|`|GbtRPEuxaa	way cool hair cut and awesome pic <br>  smile Jesus loves you|`|zfyOhvnNaa	The add seems to good to be true.  250?  I would find out more information.  There are no videos or pictures of anyone actually riding him.  Before consider purchasing, you need a vet check, to see others ride him, YOU need to ride him, have him loaded into trailer, clipped, bathed.  All that.  Never take an adds word for anything.  See it for yourself.<br>  <br>  Also, if the horse is so nice why ask so little for him?  Being a rescue he may have hidden health problems.  I'd get much more information before seriously consider buying.<br>  <br>  IF everything checks out, he seems like he'd make a lovely mount.|`|UCCAAqpUaa	I like him, but I would expect him to have his front legs tucked better.  His back legs are perfect, tight and even.  He has a sweet expression and with some TLC I think he would make a great horse!  I would definitely ride him and get a vet check (which I'm sure you already know!).  Also, the ad says he has to stay at current facility, is that okay?  <br>  <br>  If you ride him and like him, I say buy him!  It would be really good of you to get a rescue horse, good luck!!|`|xVx57isRaa	I think he is perfect for you. He's very pretty. Just make sure he has no health problems.|`|WhKj0yCYaa	I like him. you should go and test ride him. good luck :)|`|aWk74OFnaa	well the real question is, are you a well experienced horse rider, and according to the description, they would like the new owner to use the horse for jumping, can you do that?<br>  <br>  I think it's a nice horse, but really I would discuss this with the rescuer of the horse and your parents :)|`|b3ZLY5osaa	i think hes beautiful i would go for it he sounds wonderful and needs a good home
SUs4rN49aa	My cat had kittens in October.. and the way it worked out is that the days the kittens were given away, it was spread out by a week. So that it wasn't one day all the kittens were there.. and then the next day they were all gone. Within a week all five kittens were gone. She would meow throughout the night looking for them.. and you could see her looking around the house for them. It's really heartbreaking, but all you can do is just give her lots of love and affection. She soon gets over it and goes back to being a house cat.. putting her needs first again.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	She looks for them for a day or so then forgets them.  It's the circle of life.  After weaning, kittens become just cats to the mother and vice versa.|`|AmKbvgmwaa	we had 6 kittens and had homes ready for four of them, as we kept two, we kept them for 12 weeks they had just finished feeding off mum, we were lucky they both took two each. the mum by that time was getting really irritated and grumpy, when the first two left, you could see her looking for a couple of hours then she settled down, and was less stressed with four, a little while later the other two left, she done the same, and now shes settled down again,|`|SSlz82Djaa	My two cats seemed to be relieved when the kittens found new homes. Peace and quiet again........|`|gjrbp1Aoaa	For the most part they are upset for a few days - looking for them and calling for them then they appear to get over it.  <br>  But my ex-stray girl seemed to have some longer term effects, although in her case I assume most of her kittens have died in the past, rather than being rehomed. We've had her for a year and she's calmed down some but for most of the time she has been very loud and to me her cries sound like she's calling for kittens that will never come. She'd just wander around crying all the time and didn't seem to want anything from me. She's been emotionally unstable, especially right after she got spayed. She has improved a lot lately.  She has a very demanding adopted son who seems to have filled the void to the point that now she tries to drive him away (he is 10 months old, he shouldn't expect the free grooming from her anymore).  But he's more stubborn than she is so she pretty much puts up with him now. She also seems to have come to terms with the end of hormones and has settled in to being more like a kitten herself. <br>  <br>  shorter version - they generally get over the loss fairly quickly but there can be some long term effects.  <br>  <br>  In nature mom would have her babies until they were ready to fend for themselves, much longer than 12 weeks. Then she would have to drive them away so she could start having more as her hormones demand. There's no choice in it for them and no time to really feel the loss. But for a pet who doesn't have to worry about survival issues, I think they do feel it and feel it for longer than they show.
ZlfPl6B1aa	I have a short hair exotic persian..which is funny because she has long hair.

tShDXmgbaa	The problem I see is #1....those breeding convicts will terrorize the oscar to death once they start breeding. Problem #2 Unless your convicts are big enough to sex...3 will not guarantee a pair but you might get lucky.  What will you do with the babies??? if you don't remove them once they mom is no longer caring for them...the oscar will eat everyone he can catch.  I just say eliminate the oscar and add some convicts and other cichlids of similar size and aggression.|`|AA12069128	You are right about Convicts they are overly aggressive toward other fish. I think if you have the breeding pair and the Oscar with that large of a tank you will be fine. You would probably even have enough room to put a few more cichlids in there. Maybe a Jack Dempsey would work and they are a beautiful fish.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	The main problem with convicts, is when they breed they get real nasty and territorial.  Oscars are really not that aggressive, they just get a bad rap for having the tendency to eat whatever will fit in it's mouth.  Maybe a single convict would be best with the oscar.  Then maybe one or two other smaller and more peaceful South American cichlids.  I wouldn't chance more then 1 convict, just in case you do end up with a breeding pair.
8TUnG6BMaa	Hi, i've got a got a 9 week old German Shepherd that we're trying to potty train (nightmare, you have to have eyes in the back of your head).....Just to add to one the previous answers regarding the puppy training mats.....if you go into the pet shops they're about ￡6 for 5 mats....in the 99p shop you can get 6 mats for 99p!!! Bargain, worth a try, to leave at the back door when you go to bed etc. We've tried them...and our pup thinks it's great fun to shred them...clearly it doesn't work for everyone, but for 99p it's definitely worth a shot!<br>  <br>  Hope this has helped.<br>  Laura|`|CuTvFlxTaa	Well I don't have a dog but my Nana used to and she trained him with the newspaper idea although I think it defeats the object. She also used to rub its nose in the wee and smack its bottom and say no naughty. What that achieved I don't know. Personally  would let it out every 15 Min's gradually increasing to every half hour then every hour over the week. Every time it eats or drinks let it out.|`|5x0xlAR2aa	Take your dog outside about 20 to 30 mins after it has eaten and wait until it has gone and then praise it. If it goes in the house tell it that its been bad and then ignore it.<br>  Hope I helped.|`|rZZiSMEUaa	Hi David B,<br>  <br>  The best way to potty train your puppy is to have an EXPERT dog trainer at your side 24Hr a day 7 days a week.<br>  <br>  Potty training is only a PART of training your puppy, what about obedience training, leash training, crate training (this will probably be the biggest help to you right now).<br>  <br>  If you don't have a complete puppy training system in place, it is only a matter of time before your puppy CONTROLS YOU.<br>  <br>  See the link below for a puppy/dog training system that puts YOU back in control.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|o2H6DEHLaa	honestly i used this and my dog was trained in a week,basically i just ut  him out every time he had signs he was doing something ,after food or after he as running around. also during the night i crated him and he never peed where he sleeped so no accidents.<br>  \when he had an accident in the house i would tell him NO and just put him in the garden.<br>  has i said he was trained in 1 week and he was only 12 weeks|`|G8L0bpOwaa	Buy potty training mats for dogs,then whenever your dog looks like its going to pee take it to the mats. then it will know every time it needs a wee to go to the mats. another tip is to put them near the door so in time it will learn to go to the door when it needs the toilet then you can open the door and it can go in the garden. it worked with my dog.hope it helps :)|`|UMEK3QqMaa	take him outside right after he or she eats or drinks. watch for him or her to pee or poop. if he or she does that give your puppy a treat and she good boy or girl|`|SbLa9utqaa	sorry you house train youre puppy but u dont make it do the potty               every time it does a pee in the house put it out for ten mins   hope this works xx
iCdnucujaa	Your cat will be fine.  They have to eat a pretty large amount of chocolate in order to have any kind of major reaction.|`|2XVp9Bt4aa	With just that little amount he will be PURRFECTLY FINE(maybe at the most he will have a tummy ache!) ! Just whatch out next time! because they WILL keep eating it if they have access to it|`|adXllZxsaa	NO worries! My cat did that as well, just don't let him eat large amounts of frosting, that would cause problems. He will be fine :)
iCdnucujaa	It sounds like she is probably pregnant.  If your have anymore questions you can check:<br>  <a href="http://www.pets.ca/articles/article-expecting.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pets.ca/articles/article-expe...</a>|`|S8Tzx44paa	Your cat is probably pregnant. But don't draw conclusions too fast. You should probably go to a vet and get things checked out, and then you'll know for sure if your cat is pregnant.|`|03c1819fcf50e87b2c30d046b6af0f3baa	so the way this works is.......when female cats are not spayed and they are allowed outside they are either pregnant or in heat. They get pregnant very easily and all the symptoms you have noted point to pregnancy. If her nipples are slightly pink that is called "Pinking" and is visible after 3 weeks of gestation. My sister found a stray cat and brought her home not knowing she was pregnant.

AA11121172	There a couple of ways to deal with this -<br>  <br>  First off, this is dangerous to the kitty, and potentially could cause a fire in your home.  Also, realize that your kitty is teething and needs to chew.  She's growing her adult teeth, and in a few months this phase should be over.  <br>  <br>  1) try a product called "Bitter Apple"  You spray it on your wires, the kitten chews, gets a very awful bitter taste, and stops.  It works sometimes, depending on the cat.<br>  <br>  2) Put the wires in some sort of unchewable protector.  Look in the rabbit section of your large pet store.  These get put around the cords, and rabbet er kitten, can't chew on them.  If you have an old garden hose, just cut it longways, insert cords, and be happy.  Your hardware store might have other options for something similiar.<br>  <br>  3) Cover, and tape the wires to the floor so they can't move.  It will be harder for the kitten to chew, but she could potentially still chew on it, if she is persistant.<br>  <br>  4)Keep her out of any room that has unprotected wires.  She should theoretically outgrow this since she is teething right now.  Most cats do, some cats don't.   When you do let her in a room with unprotected wires, watch her like a hawk.  When she starts going after the wires, throw a can with pennies near her (not AT her) to startle her.  If you do this every single time, she learns that cords are no fun, and won't chew on them.  Pair this with bitter apple and you should have her trained quickly.<br>  <br>  5) Make sure she has toys she can chew on.  Go through the dog/puppy section and find the smallest puppy toy (made for small dogs) that looks similar and feels similar to the cords.  Kong makes some interesting toys and comes in small sizes.  Also, if you can find a toy that is like the cords, and is fillable with food, try filling it with wet cat food, freeze it, and give it to the kitten.  That way, she stays interested in the toy, gets her chewing fix, and stays away from the cords.  <br>  <br>  6) Pairing a punishment (Bitter apple, loud noise) with a positive reinforcement (Toy) you tell her that she can't chew this, but she can chew that, and you can have her trained in a remarkably short time.|`|iDxoM3X8aa	Catch the kitten doing this and give a gentle spray off water they hate water leave the spray near the plugs i done this with my two it worked they still don,t know i sprayed the spray lol they keep away to this day they are 7years old good luck.|`|WGsC4c61aa	You have excellent answers from other people. the only thing I am going to say is that my daughters cat chew on cables and burned her tongue. We had to take to the vet where they gave her meds to care care of her burn. She chews on every cord that she can get in front of her. She is 5 years old and her favorite spot during xmas is the tree. Good Luck.|`|AA10038780	your are not going to like my answer.<br>  I had that problem and it took a couple yrs for my cat to outgrow.<br>  However, because chewing wires has the potential for killing your cat, and you will lose ability to use a lot of your stuff (their teeth can cut<br>  right through)..you must make sure your kitten doesn't have access<br>  to wires.<br>  that means moving furniture; radio shack has wire covers.<br>  every wire your kitten can get to, needs to be covered with a wire cover.|`|goo7zzqWaa	get some of that plastic tubing stuff to wrap around the wires

tShDXmgbaa	Oscars need huge tanks as their poop is very big and nasty.  Oscars need to be housed with fish that get their size or larger as smaller fish the oscar will find to be the "perfect meal"
iCdnucujaa	It is possible that they are back if the treatment didn't completely work or if some have been living in your house.  You can check if your cat has mites by looking into it's ears.  If there are a lot of black dots/specks she probably has mites and you should get her checked by a vet.  Otherwise it might be fleas or something like that.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Yes.  If treatment didn't completely wipe out the infestation the first time, they can reinfest.|`|8c4f5448125b34e2bc59c2ba87385a71aa	It is absolutely possible your cat got them again. Our cat had ear mites when we got her. We got her treated but the vet warned that the mite eggs could have gotten on a surface she slept on or mites live on the head too or she could go out and get them again. So i immediatly bought some advance flea medicine. And applied it to her. It kills and prevents fleas, ear mites, ticks and protects from mosqito tranmitted deseases. <br>  So you may want to take her to the vet and have her checked. Treated if need be and go ahead and buy some Advance. It will be money well spent. It's kinda expensive, but treat her a few times and then maybe it would be safe to stop treatments. <br>  Good luck|`|OjXAcwJPaa	short answer. yes its possible

JnMnd5hsaa	Hey,<br>  <br>   Rabbits are very good pets. I currently have 4 rabbits and in the summer we breed two of them.<br>  <br>   Rabbits are very lovable and are also a lot of fun.They do need to have a lot of attention though. The first thing i would do is tell your parents that you are fully responsible and would do anything to have a rabbit. Show them how  responsible you are. Tell them that you would take care of the rabbit and give it attention every single day.<br>  <br>  Information on rabbits:<br>   - they need to be taken out everyday so they can rome around<br>   - their cage needs to be cleaned evey other day<br>   - easy to train ( they can be litter trained but make sure you use shavings! not cat litter!)<br>   -rabbits like vegetables and they need them to keep their teeth from growing to long.<br>  <br>     I have a lot more information if you would like. You can contact me and ask any questions that you need to be answered.<br>  <br>    Hope this helps!!|`|AA11830038	Really think twice before you get a rabbit. They are like having a two year old child. They eat everything if you don't watch them. And by everything, I mean the carpet, paper, baseboard, rugs, cords, pillows, couches, furniture, ANYTHING. <br>  You have to let it out for exercise, but you must get cord protectors for your cords. They will chew them in half so fast, right in front of you that you can't believe they did it that quick. You must supervise them at all times while out.They will even eat their bedding, so you have to get safe bedding, such as Carefresh. So please think twice before you get one as they are a lot more work than a cat, so many people end up giving them to shelters because they can't handle the work and attention a rabbit needs. Some like to be held, some don't. They are afraid of heights, so a lot of them don't like being picked up off the ground, but will sit in your lap. They can jump pretty high too. so whatever you have to protect, be careful, as they can jump a baby gate. They can be brats, then the next day this loveable little guy. They are moody, territorial, and smart as can be. Just research a lot before you get one to see if you're still interested.|`|S9nthF7vaa	you tell your parents that you are lonely or something, or you want to pruve to them you are responsible enough, or old enough to have a rabit. then you come out with great facts about them, and you give them the time to think about it,|`|bOtk6QfIaa	go 2 www.petfinder.com and find some cute rabbits I suggest dwarf rabbits show ur parents how resposible u can be.|`|okJuemOUaa	tell them you really want a rabbit and tell them how responsible your going to be with it. Like if they ask who's gonna feed it or clean it's cage.|`|tXT63mFtaa	Well first of all you need to take into account how much care, time & love they need. Will it fit into your llifestyle? Once you have considored all this I would start to save up, you will need about ￡80 for the hutch, This is the one I have :<br>  <a href="http://www.bitsforpets.com/images/mollys-mansion-rabbit-hutch.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.bitsforpets.com/images/mollys...</a><br>  Then you will need all the food, sawdust, hay, etc. Which will come to around ￡20. Show your mum & dad (or whoever looks after you) all your money and explain to them how much you plan to spend on it all and how much money you will spend every month on the rabbit. This will show them how organised you are. Then spend about 2 weeks or so researching rabbits and every so often pick out an interesting tip and tell your parents. When you go out shopping ask your parents to go into the pet shop with you and show them all the cute bunnies. Educate them on the rabbits and explain how much you want one and that it would teach you responsibility etc. Trust me it all pays off.<br>  <br>  Good Luck. It may take a while but its worth it!<br>  Abby =0)

The point to remember is these classes are fun so let your imagination run wild!  A football kit is easy, get some fabric in the colour of your fav team.  You don't have to buy it by the meter - a cheap duvet cover, sheet or old curtains will work and is cheaper.  Use a rug to draw out a template, cut out, stitch, hem etc then decorate with the clubs emblem on the side - emulsion paint or fabric paint works well.  Fasten your "rug" with stitched on ties at the front and a surcingle round the middle, pulling the fabric into place over the surcingle so that it looks like "shorts" tucked in.  Add football socks made out of leg warmers and finish off with you dressed in your strip - or as an opposing team and look for that red rossette!<br>  <br>  If you don't fancy that, you can use the rug template for just about anything!    We once dressed a chestnut as a tree!  We stuck heaps of paper leaves all over the bright green fabric and dressed the rider as Robin Hood - we won 1st all over for 3 years with that costume untill it eventually fell to bits!  <br>  <br>  Once we covered a white rug with fur and bells and dressed the rider as the snow Queen from chronicles of Narnia - the same rug was later recycled as "ride a **** horse to Banbury cross" when the rider was a fine lady with rings on her fingers etc.  <br>  <br>  I have also dressed a TBx as Tarzan and his rider as Cheetah, a black cob as Jess and the rider as postman Pat - but the best I ever saw was a HUGE shire dressed as the donkey from "Shrek"  His rider was dressed as a very green looking ogre!<br>  <br>  What ever you choose have fun with it but make sure that you de sensitize the horse to the outfit well before.  Many horses hate being dressed up - you need to make sure he's going to be ok with whatever you and him are going to be wearing.  And don't forget that other horses and ponies will be in this class too, possibly wearing stuff that could freak him out - do your ground work!!  I once saw a whole class of big brave horses completely traumatized by "little bo peeps sheep"

He knows who is horsey and who is not; he is gentle with my children, goes back when my 3 year old gives him his feed, stands to be brushed, goes to sleep with the toddler on his back, is gentle as pie with my sister who gave up riding in her teens and is a little bit sharp with my other sister, who recently started again.  He can tell how he needs to be with each person - he keeps me on my toes but is more forgiving of my partner, and tries to take the piss out our groom.<br>  <br>  The only one of mine who is spooked by kids is my young ID x WB; the rest appreciate that they are foals!|`|JHYCr0rRaa	My first horse definitely could tell the age of people. You could throw a really young kid on her and she'd be an angel, she'd be extremely gentle and tolerant, Anyone old enough to fend for themselves she'd test, and almost always won. <br>  <br>  And then there's my mom's arab who probably couldn't tell a baby from a loaf of bread, which wouldn't matter to her anyway because anything out of the ordinary is out to get her...|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	When my son was really little, I had 3 horses.  I think they all recognized him as a baby, kept an eye on him since he tended to be unpredictable, and caused him no harm.  However, my one arab/QH gelding has always had a special interest in my son (who is now 8).  He would always go over to him and check out what he was doing, stand next to him, and breathe on his head.  He still does.  This same horse is sometimes a dog chaser.  I guess he just takes more of an interest in things around him than the others do.  This horse can be a handful to ride.  I'm curious if he'd be good for my son, but haven't tried that yet, in case it turns out badly.|`|YHpePjb9aa	yep.... most of my horses are very well behaved with young children. One of my horses isnt exactly a novice ride.... but will allow a 4yo child to ride him when he would throw a very good rider off! they are also gentler around them and don't tend to barge or push them..... nd they also lower their noses down to the kids as if to smell them|`|Ih0B30Pvaa	We had a horse like that.  She was a very old morgan mare.  She used to do show jumping in Canada when she was younger.  She let older people ride her when she was young but as she got older she started to pin her ears and bite at adults.  Even with tons of discipline she had a nasty edge for adults.  Especially males.  As far as we know she hasn't been abused or anything.  She takes care of the little girls that ride her and she acts like a perfect horse around them.  It's like she has a special bond with little girls.|`|Czh1fbQgaa	Most horses have a special sense to be careful around small people and beginner riders. They can just feel it. Some horses just don't get it though. Go figure. <br>  Once when I was in like 3rd grade, my sister's class took a field trip to a horse farm and by then I had been riding for almost 4 years. There was this one horse that was super calm and just like whatever for the little kids, but I got to get on her and she could feel I was more experienced. I have no idea how. She was really difficult for me to ride though.
P0Fjh59Eaa	There are always risks w/medication. allergic reactions etc. can happen. but the % of them is not too high. you just have to watch your dog for signs after giving any medication. <br>  <br>  My dogs have been on Iverhart Max for about 7 yrs now w/no issues. sometimes though if my vet hasn't gotten in a shipment ill buy a single dose for that month of Heartgard. only had to do that a couple of times. i know my mini doxie hates the heartgard though, it's a huge block and he doesn't like having to chew all that up, i sometimes had to break it into tiny pieces and then put it down in the back of his mouth. i too prefer Iverhart because it's a tiny round pill and they chew it up in about 2 seconds.<br>  <br>  The shelter i volunteer at uses Heartgard Plus.|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	No drug is 100% safe.  I haven't tried Tri-Heart.  *Both of my dogs got sick on Iverhart, but have never had any problems with Heartgard Plus chewables.  I'm sticking with Heartgard Plus.<br>  <br>  *A couple of years ago my vet stopped carrying Heartgard Plus and recommended Iverhart.  Both became ill.  I now go to a different vet to get Heartgard Plus.|`|eDySIDPQaa	Heart Guard Plus is the best of them...it treats for Heart Worms and Hook worms in dogs....<br>  <br>  I have used it for over 20 yrs and never had a dog with heart worms or hook worms...and I use the chewable.....the dogs take them no problems, they are beef flavored<br>  <br>  Most other heart worm meds do not cover hook worms but HHeart-Guard Plus does|`|TWfDAYK4aa	I have used the Heargard without a problem.  So......<br>  I have never tried the others, but heartgard has been around for years.  I assume it to be safe.  I also think it is better than letting the dog get heartworms.  BJMO.|`|QstEk6PZaa	Heartguard is the best in my opinion, used it since the 1990s.|`|I4vPxh3jaa	yes i think they are safe.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	I havent heard much about iverhart but the company that makes it virbac is really good, they make one of the medicated shampoos i use pyoben.<br>  <br>  Same with tri-heart havent heard of them<br>  <br>  Heartgard is what we used to use. Its good and safe. We switched to interceptor which is even better. We also use ivermectin.|`|Bw18seFqaa	there are risks with all drugs.. nothing is 100% safe.<br>  <br>  Problems from heartworm preventatives are very rare tho.  Collie-type breeds should not take brands that contain ivermectin, they tend to have a reaction to it.<br>  <br>  Benefits of preventing heartworm far outweigh any risks that come with the drugs.<br>  <br>  All of these are fairly safe for most dogs.  They all contain ivermectin tho, so if you have a collie-type dog you should talk to your vet about other options.  The dogs should be tested for Heartworm prior to starting the drug.
V2RYB1Hjaa	Here's a good chart. <a href="http://www.liveaquaria.com/general/compatibility_chart.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.liveaquaria.com/general/compa...</a><br>  Also, this same website has more info and stuff for these fish. And, if you don't mind buying online (they have a great What You See Is What You Get section, where the picture of the fish/invert/whatever is the exact one you get) they sell all sorts of fish, inverts, corals, plants etc.|`|Qhdozm54aa	It looks fine to me however I would just keep one pair of clownfish, the third will most likely end up being bullied by the others. As always I would recommend the largest tank you can afford and have room for, something around 120 x 46 x 46cm would be ideal.
SZdSFi1raa	I looked it up in my ferrets for dummies book for you they have a list of shelters and organizations.<br>  There is a shelter called Obadiah's Ferret Rescue & Shelter and a another called WNYFLFA Shelter<br>  The last one is called Home Again Rescue.<br>  There were no phone numbers in the book but I hope this helps you in your search.
zv8QaMe1aa	Pet licensing rules in the US are generally on a county by county basis.  So we won't know just by what State you're in.  Go to your county's website and they should have information on pets and the rules about them.  If your county has a county animal shelter, they should have that information as well, you could likely call them tomorrow and ask and they may even have a pamphlet they can send you with information.|`|Gnzeq3f2aa	Hi - are those cats too cool or what? <br>  <br>  Like the other person said, it varies from area to area. The breeder should be able to tell you (assuming they are local to you) or animal control can. You could also try department of fish and game. <br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|B8je4n5vaa	WELL not unless it is under 8 months, otherwise congrats on the new cat!!|`|auutSNQzaa	you shouldnt... besides that... dont take it too the cops and ask.. and you should be fine even if you did.|`|hatqcCQCaa	depends how old she is... if shes under 1 yr you can get 1|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Not sure, why don't you call your local animal control and see if they can put you in touch with someone that would know.|`|0mb78CiWaa	I am not sure. You could probably ask at your local police department, where you license your pet, or a vet.
Bpc1kPqpaa	If no more white spots are noticeable in the next week, and nothing else happens, it may be the color. It could also be a fungal infection, go to <a href="http://www.betafacts.com/betafishdisease.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.betafacts.com/betafishdisease...</a> to see more info.<br>  Hope I helped!<br>  P.S. What's it's name?|`|rrLHU6ehaa	1.  It could be the beginning of ich.  It could have picked it up at the store.  Ich most often shows up due to stress, such at moving, bright lights, new home.  It's due to the immune system being weakened due to several reasons.  Other causes are poor water quality, low temperature (should be 78-82 F),  boredom, and others.  Healthy fish are generally able to fight off the parasites.<br>  2.  A fungus is usually a larger spot or blotch, fuzzy in appearance.<br>  3.  I could be natural coloring.  Watch closely for spreading spots.<br>  <br>  NEVER medicate a fish unless you know for sure what's wrong with it.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	If its not fuzzy, then it could just be a discoloration. keep a watch on it and make sure it doesn't get bigger. Have some fungus meds on hand anyway...just in case. keep the water clean and see what happens.|`|D1KT9ioJaa	get the gun...and do what needs to be done..sorry but its to put the betta out of its misery
NL6YPVYiaa	No he doesn't.My first guinea had that.just go to the vet tomorrow and ask for antibiotic he just has a case pf the sniffles :P|`|8EyDsAt6aa	its probably nothing. he wont die on you tonight esp if this has been going on for awhile. If it bothers you a lot or gets worse take him to a vet.
8BtuPcrpaa	i trained my 5 month old, teacup yorkshire terrier puppy to go on wee wee pads, you just put it down and once they get used to it you just change it once a day. thats if its too dificult to have the dog go outside. but they work like a charm for me, hope i helped!! :)|`|0TMMqa0Laa	If you fully want to train him to go outdoors, do not use puppy pads.  That just gives him permission to go inside.  <br>  <br>  The best way would be crate training.  Dogs do not like to sleep or eat where they do their business so they typically will hold it while in a crate.  Have the puppy in a crate whenever you cannot be home and at night when you are sleeping.<br>  <br>  Take the dog outside to the same spot immediately after removing him from the crate and 10-20 minutes after he eats.  Make it a big deal when he goes potty but do not reward with food or you will be right back outside.<br>  <br>  On feeding, make sure you feed the dog on a regular schedule and when you will have time to take him outside afterwards.  Routine is going to be key.<br>  <br>  If you are not comfortable crate training your dog when you are home, keep him on a leash beside you at all times.  If he looks like he is looking for somewhere to go, pick him up and take him outside immediately.<br>  <br>  If he has accidents in the house that you do not witness in the act, just clean it up thoroughly and move on.  But if you catch him in the act, firmly say NO! and immediately take him outside.  Never hit the dog or rub his nose in the mess.<br>  <br>  You have to stay consistent, even when it is cold, when it is hot, when it is raining, snowing etc.  You just have to suck it up and do it.  Until this dog is fully trained, your life will revolve around potty time.|`|nSIMwm9zaa	there are many of was but ill give you a few one is that you can use the puppy traning pads or you could give him/her a certian part to use the bathroom and if he dont go in the right spot give him a little slap or something and if he goes in the right spot give him a treat eventually he will be trained.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I think I would go with a litter box method, since the puppy wouldn't move around much in the litter box.  I think they use a paper pellet for dogs. Here are some tips, use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.<br>   <br>  REVISIONS: <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you.<br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.<br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them. <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places.<br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.    <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.  Thanks for your help!|`|pqzKlNudaa	With training pads, put a few around the house and he will start using them.|`|nN8H45wgaa	I would try training pads, but the downfall of training  pads is if you keep the training pads in your house it tends to train the puppy that it's ok to potty in the house. My husband bought me a puppy for xmas. I really took her outside everytime she would start sniffing the ground and I would take her out 10 minutes after she got done eating and drinking water. After a couple days she'll get the hang of whining when she needs to go out. also when you take her out for the first few times make sure you put her in the grass and stand out there with her. If you dont stand out there with her then she will be more into following you than actually going potty outside.  Just try being outside with her and at night kennel train her. If you put a puppy in her kennel at night they tend not to potty where they have to sleep. She may potty the first couple times but after a while they dont potty where they have to sleep.|`|UqMiFspnaa	Keep a leash on your pet if you really plan 100% training her right. Wait 30 min after feeding her then take her to the potty pad. Sit her on it and say a word like potty orr wee wee or whatever you want so she knows what to do on it while she is doing her thing. It worked for me. Both chihuahuas after 2 weeks had no accidents anywhere. It sounds odd and bit harsh to keep them near you but as puppys they need rules and training even if they are little.|`|9Tf4pg7Zaa	Put down newspaper of training pads. Say it is a good dog and pet it when it goes on the paper or pads and scold when it doesn't. it is easier to clean up because its all in one place|`|9ANfcQKCaa	Take your puppy out to where ever you expect it to go often, and to the same spot every time. Just remember where ever it is, this spot should always be ok for it to go in. It would be helpful to know the breed of your dog.

Do some research about how to take care of them and then show your parents what you have learnt.<br>  <br>  If you show them that your willing to learn and be responsible for your pet hamster and they still say no, then there is some other reason they wont let you get a hamster.<br>  <br>  And also, you need to be careful with your hamster since you have four cats, if you get a hamster, I suggest you buy a cage that's not wire - like a tank.

Research hamsters. Are you sure you want one? They live up to 2-3 years! And they are nocturnal, so they can only be kept in your room if you sleep heavily. They also are sensitive to light, heat, and many other things such as pets and small children. If you have cats that will try to eat it, think twice. Same goes for younger siblings that might squish them by mistake. They can't be kept in direct sunlight or in drafty areas. They need a pretty stable temperature. They also need to be handled every day to stay friendly and to have their cage cleaned once a week to stay healthy.<br>     2. Ask your parents nicely if you would be able to get a hamster. If they say no, tell them you have looked up hamsters and pet stores/shelters/breeders around the area. (If your parents say yes, to have a hamster you would need a wheel without bars [solid surface so they don't get stuck], cage bedding, hamster food, a cage, a hamster, and a cage water bottle)<br>     3. Be persistent without being annoying. If they say maybe, you may be lucky! Show them pictures of hamsters and give them details of your research of hamsters. Get them interested in the process and you may be able to change their minds.<br>     4. Be patient. After a few weeks (or days), they might say yes. If not, ask for the reason. There are lots of reasons for and against getting a pet. If you know why they refused, you can either make peace with the decision, or plan how to convince them in the future.<br>     5. Plan financially for your hamster's care. Showing your parents the plan can help convince them you are responsible enough for a pet! On the other hand, it may convince you that you can find a cheaper hobby.<br>     6. If your parents are worried about financial costs, convince them that you will do chores or the like to help pay for the hamster.<br>  <br>  answrr mine plz..|`|IFvj22PDaa	This is what i did to get a hamster: (My mom is hard to convince and this worked!)

Show responsibility<br>  4. be mature<br>  5. write essays and add up the total of all the supplies you need. It makes you look responsible ;)<br>  6. they only cost $10-$20 <br>  7. they dont smell unless u dont pick up their pee and poop<br>  8. they DONT carry diseases if you get them from a reliable pet store <br>  9. dwarves hamsters/rats are smaller so they should be easier to deal with and their poop is smaller ;)<br>  10. They can stay home for a few days, you just have to feed them for the amont of food for the amount of days you wouldnt be there. Also if you were traveling, you can always take them with you.

Take note of what you are doing to be responsible and prove that to your parents that you are. Make sure that you are ready for a hamster also, not just because they are "cute". Are you ready to clean a cage? Feed and water every couple days? Play with them? Give them love? Remember certain things? While you may think yes to all these questions, try to think ahead of what really will happen. Try doing a little research or getting a book on hamsters.<br>  <br>  I would just ask if you could have one. If they say no, then don't beg. Try to persuade them to let you have one, but don't force it down their throats. I know that from experience.|`|6BCKYKKGaa	First take a step back and think.....you have cats right? So is getting a hamster really a good idea?

Shampoo will dry it out further, so that's not the way to stop it.<br>  <br>  The vet carries a product called Derm Caps, which was $8 last I checked for 60 gel caps. You pierce the cap and put it over the food.  If yours doesn't carry that, you can use a caplet of primrose oil or flax seed oil on the food twice a week. Or 1/4 tsp of canola oil once a week. Don't use cod liver oil, it's too heavy for their liver to process and regular use of that depletes their system of vitamin A.|`|iCdnucujaa	Most cats hate water so giving her a bath is kind of evil and you will probably get lots of scratches.  The cat doesn't care that she has dandruff.  Just leave it.  3 of my cats have dandruff and they are all fine.|`|FQyeGsIyaa	Don't use human shampoo on your cat, it will be too harsh.  This is important since your cat already has dry, flaky skin.  You can get a pet shampoo at your local pet store.<br>  <br>  You should also try to figure out why she has dandruff:<br>  I have to ask  - what you are feeding her?  My cat is a picky eater and I was running low on Evo so I started trying different brands to see if she'd go for any of them.  She wasn't thrilled with the other brands and suddenly she started getting bad dandruff.  I switched back to Evo and it was amazing how quickly the dandruff went away.  <br>  <br>  Another possible cause of the dandruff is an allergy to fleas or mites or some other parasite.  If these are the underlying cause, you'll need to take her to the vet.<br>  <br>  The link below has some info on cat dandruff and ways to deal with it, you'll need to scroll down the page.  It also has a funny video of a cat being vac'd!|`|6my2NqzBaa	If she can handle a bath get some baby shampoo.. it is the pest bemedy for  dandruff on a samll animal unfortanitly using humman pruduct on an animal are highly unrecomended because they never thoroughly wash our of there fur which in turn means when the cat licks itself it will ingest the shampoo that is still in its fur.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the dandruff. And would recomend taking the cat to the vet or calling the local vet clinic for advice on it.|`|DEdtNBBSaa	You really should stay away from the shampoos.  But there are things you need to do.   If you cat sleeps on a pad or pillow be sure to wash it frequently, get rid of all the brushes you use on your cat and get new ones(wash them after use), get a carpet spray flea-control to spray on your carpet or engage a pest exterminator.  Finally consider using a homeopthic remedy to clear up your cat's skin mites.  There is more info below...best, Kate

CrsK0p1Yaa	yes they can. Here is another true story for you. When I was a kid, my mom bought me a 25 gallon octagon shaped tank at a flea market. We took it home and cleaned it really well, with bleach and of course rinsed it well. THe snail shells were tiny, and mixed in the colored gravel. Instead of picking them out, we left them in the gravel. Guess what? They were really snails still living. When we set up the tank to get the water temps regulated for us to buy fish, we noticed these shells were climbing around on the glass, ETC. They lived thru being washed in bleach!!! Seriously. They also reproduced easier than any other thing I ever had in my tanks, including guppies, mollies, and swordtails. So, I think the dried eggs hatching after 8 years is believable.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Nature is amazing...dried brine shrimp eggs can do the same thing. Its very strange though isnt it!

rdcxVqfxaa	It is important for your Macaw to eat fruits and vegetables daily. Your Macaw should have 1/2 - 3/4 cups of fruit, and 1/2 - 3/4 cups of veggies per day. You may feed them whole or chopped up, so try both and see which way she prefers them. All types of fruits such as apples, pears, plums, cherries, grapes, oranges, bananas, mangos, papayas, and even berries such as strawberries and blueberries are enjoyed. Make sure you remove any large pits in the fruit before feeding it to her though. Many vegetables including carrots, sweet potatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, dark green leafy veggies, many garden vegetables, and even dandelions and chickweed are good. Do not feed avocado as it may be toxic to birds! Offer nuts for treats, such as macadamias, walnuts, pecans, almonds, and filberts. Don't offer nuts daily though as this may become very unhealthy. Additional proteins can be offered such as sprouted legumes and cooked chicken or meat. Grit is not considered essential as macaws will shell their seed before eating it. Hope this helps, and good luck.|`|IxuMTGd4aa	Well, for one:<br>  <br>  1, Turn OFF Caps Lock. It's annoying, obnoxious, and hurts people's eyes.<br>  2. Learn to spell words like "diet", "vegetables (veggies)", and words like those.<br>  <br>  ~~~<br>  <br>  NOW: <br>  <br>  Give her a plate full of vegetables and fruits DAILY. That means everyday, give her fresh fruit and vegetables 9whole or cut up, your choice) without any of the seeds or pits in them.<br>  <br>  Stay away from NUTS! Those are really high in fat, and they aren't good for her health. Maybe give her two or three a week, but any more than that can hurt her health.

n4pNNcGfaa	There are two fear imprint periods, one at about eight weeks and the other at about eight months, give or take a few months.<br>  <br>  GSDs may be spookier (easily startled) during fear imprint periods, but shouldn't actually be more fearful.  The purpose of these periods is for the dog to learn how to handle fear, which is not inherently bad.  A dog with no fear at all will stand in the middle of the road and watch a car run right over him.  So he's in a place where he's supposed to learn what is fear-worthy (or respect-worthy) and what is not.  It's now up to you to help him learn which is which.<br>  <br>  It is important not to coddle him when he is spooky or shows a fear response because that will tend to reinforce the behavior and confirm his suspicion that the experience really is fear-worthy.  Neither should he be forced through fearful experiences, say by flooding.<br>  <br>  Instead, he should be inoculated carefully.  When you see a fear response, lead by example.  Show you are not afraid with calm confidence, not correction, and not comforting.  Do not let him run away, but neither do you approach the fear object.  Wait for him to recover.  A mentally sound GSD will recover from a startle in seconds.  When he does, praise and invite or encourage him to choose to go forward and investigate.  Forcing him to approach will not teach him the confidence he needs to choose to approach on his own.  A mentally sound GSD should have a strong desire to investigate on his own and that's what needs to be encouraged.  People tend not to praise nearly enough, or nearly exuberantly enough.  You can praise too little, but not too much so be generous and genuine.<br>  <br>  Try taking him to a park or the parking lot of a shopping center.  Pick a location where people occasionally pass, but no crowds.  Call to passers-by and explain you are socializing the dog and would they come and give him a cookie or toss him a ball.  Make sure the cookies come from your own pocket and have your scent on them, and give him a release word (permission) to take the treat or toy.  You don't want him thinking he can take any treat from any stranger any time he likes.  But you do want him believing that good things come from people, even strangers.  As his confidence builds, you can do socialization work in areas with more and more people.  Make meeting 10 new people every day a goal and he'll be over his suspicions of strangers in no time at all.<br>  <br>  See also:  <a href="http://www.nwk9.com/fear_imprint.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nwk9.com/fear_imprint.htm</a>  fear imprint periods are often misunderstood.  This article explains it better than any other I've seen on the Internet.<br>  <br>  Re:  other dog issues.<br>  <br>  If you are the leader of your pack, then it is your business to handle the security of the pack and the resources of the pack.  In other words, it isn't his business to either protect you or to behave jealously.  In either case it is an indication he's not sure you're the leader.  That doesn't mean you knock him around with alpha rolls, but that you act like a leader and take control of 1.  resources (food, toys, your affection) 2.  the behavior of others  3.  stewardship of the pack.  NILIF (Nothing In Life Is Free) will help.  He's a working dog in a puppy body.  Give him some work to do.  That in itself is comforting to a working dog.  When it's meal time, ask him to perform a few basic commands to earn his dinner.  If you give him a treat or a toy, have him earn it first (the exception being during socialization).  Google for more info on NILIF.

I've worked with many different dogs with all different backgrounds through the Humane Society of the US, and work locally with several organizations that foster and help with abuse victims' behavior disorders. I've never heard of a 'fear stage', though I believe that he's just coming of age and is beginning to learn how to behave in general now that he's more aware of his surroundings. So that being said, whether he seems to think he has to protect you from his fellow pooches or is jealous of them getting your attention it can be dangerous especially with the larger breeds. Fix this behavior ASAP and train as if it's a territory issue first to determine what he's really thinking :) He sounds like a great dog, but he also sounds like he needs to run a lot....once you have a hold on his behavior around other pups you should take him to the dog park and the farm alternating visits and see how different his behavior is at each place. Is he around other dogs at home or just when you visit a farm or walks? Is he territorial towards other dogs over his food at all?

It is a myth that they even normally consume the stomachs of their prey, they actually usually dump out the stomach before eating it or avoid it all together.  Its not that they can't eat plant material, its simply that they don't need to.  They don't digest plant material very well. <br>  <br>  If you don't think raw is a good idea, you shouldn't feed it.

The key is to balance their diet. Make sure a healthy balance of muscle meat(80%), bone(20%) and organ(10%, 5% of which is liver) is used, and the dog gets fish as well. It's a myth about predators eating stomach contents- Unless the animal is small. The only greens my dogs eat is grass, and that's never had an ill effect on them. <br>  I wouldn't ever give my dog cheese- It's processed and often full of salt. Whole raw eggs are my dogs personal favourites, although they're quite partial to whole pigs heads(which, depending on the size of your dog, can last two or three meals). <br>  A raw diet requires a lot of researching. It's not something to just jump into willy nilly. <br>  If you do feed only dry food, make sure your dog gets raw bones at least three times a week.

Raw feeding ... is a fad that's embraced by a lot of mislead people.  They think throwing your dog a raw chicken, bones and all, is how a dog was meant to eat.  Which is a bunch of bologna, even wolves in the wild will eat things like roots and berries.  And while I think that it's possible to build a raw diet for a dog that is complete, most of the people out there doing it are cheating their dogs out of a lot of nutrients that are found in the higher quality kibble ....<br>  <br>  Anyway, someone gave you a link to the dogfood analysis website.  I suggest you find something there instead of being mislead into raw feeding.|`|9ANfcQKCaa	We started with Blue Buffalo and my Lab liked it but he would pick out all the little dark peices and leave them all over the floor so we swithed to canidae and he really likes it. They make it for the whole life cycle so you really dont have to swith to something elase when going from Puppy to adult. You can go to a local Mud bay and they should have samples that you can try. See which your dogs like before paying for a whole 30lb bag.|`|11PAFD9Caa	Canidae is a good dog food. Also look into feeding raw.<br>  <br>  edit: Thank you Darksong for posting the links about Raw feeding.|`|l2T4TrN6aa	Wellness and Merrick are both great dogfoods with no by-products.|`|I4vPxh3jaa	i feed my dogs Healthwise and they love it. it is made of mostly natural products.

LzcTwj7kaa	Wow.  Dumb People.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Straving yourself to death is atleast 2-3 weeks.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	About 2 weeks I reckon, depends how overweight you are in the first place but by starving yourself your body will try to hold onto fat reserves so you won't lose weight very quickly really. Better to eat a balanced low fat diet and exercise every day. <br>  <br>  Please post this in the health section, nothing to do with birds.|`|CuGT5X6eaa	first of all,that is not a safe way to lose weight,second this is the bird section,and also,please rethink your options because you can die from that.

I would try that. If it doesn't heal than you're going to have to find an animal clinic that will do payments to help you out on the vet bill. He might also have a certain skin disease that some cats get. definitely try the ear mites stuff though|`|q7wqIrkmaa	It could be ear mites but it could also be an ear infection.  Either way the cat should be seen by a vet.  If you can't afford to take your cat to the vet you should call around and see if there is a low cost or free clinic in your area.  Unfortunately even if it is ear mites over the counter meds are usually a waste of money.  I would get this taken care of as soon as possible.  The worse it gets the more money it's going to take to fix it.  Also whether it is mites or an infection it is obviously very uncomfortable for your cat.  Call your area vets and see what they recommend!|`|XUYvZ01yaa	It might be ear mites. My kitten had them. Check his/her ears and if you see lots of little black spots in its ear that could mean he/she has ear mites. You can get them out with a cotton swab but you cant go to deep into the cats ear because that could damage the cat's ears. About the skin ripping maybe you can find a spray that the cat doesn't like and put it on his ear so he wont scratch. Or maybe raising more money for your cat. You could have a fundraiser! So then you will have enough money for your cat to go to the vet.|`|GXMTwCLTaa	first, you need to take the animal to the hospital if it's down the the meat, that's animal abuse if u don't buddy. And if you can't afford a vet you need to give it away to a good home who can.|`|OjXAcwJPaa	sounds like mites, but it could also be an ear infection. if over the counter mite med from walmart or a pet store dont work...within a couple days, it will require a trip to the vet for med|`|hatqcCQCaa	take her to the vet right away|`|U2KdP1y7aa	It could be fleas, ear mites, or even a tick if she goes outside.

wdKsVqbnaa	I am a breeder of 10+ years.<br>  <br>  It's best to feed her a good quality puppy food.  I use Purina Pro Plan, but if it's not available in your area, you could use Purina One.  If she shows no interest in the food, you can mix canned dog food with it.  A little secret to get your dog to eat better, is to heat up the food first.  You can't heat dry dog food, but it would work great with the canned, and then mix in the dry puppy food.<br>  <br>  I agree with the previous post, if you start feeding her human food, you'll have problems on your hand.  She'll expect it EVERY day, and will refuse to eat anything else, even to the point of starving.  Trust me.....I've been down that road, and will not go back!<br>  <br>  P.S.  Do NOT give her milk!  Dogs, like cats, are lactose intolerant!  Dairy products will give them the diarrhea.  I would suggest Goat's milk.  You can buy this at Wal-Mart, in the milk section.  <br>  <br>  Also, yogurt is great for nursing moms and puppies!  Make sure it's fully fattening!  Don't get any of the low fat or non fat flavors.  Just get plain yogurt.  A recipe that I have used in the past, with underweight puppies or moms, is 1 cup yogurt, 1 cup goats milk, 2 egg yolks, 1 tablespoon of light Kayro Syrup.  Mix well!  It does wonders with puppies, and moms love it too!!!  If feeding to puppies, make sure you heat it to room temperature, and the mom would probably eat it better heated up also.|`|rbJV7kBVaa	My friends lhasa apso recently had 5 puppies.  She was recommended by her vet that her dog feed the same food as her puppies so that she could keep all the nutrients required.  <br>  <br>  She usually feeds Hills mini adult but had her dog on hills mini puppy: <a href="http://www.mutleyandmog.co.uk/dog/dog-food/complete-dry-dog-food/hills-science-plan-dog-food/hills-puppy-food/hills-science-plan-puppy-food-mi" rel="nofollow">http://www.mutleyandmog.co.uk/dog/dog-fo...</a><br>  <br>  Its a really good food for toy dogs.<br>  <br>  Also it might be a good idea to add in a really good quality meat to give her some extra taste if she is not so fussed on the dry food.  Naturediet is really good as it has about 60% meat.  Here is a link to that food: <a href="http://www.mutleyandmog.co.uk/dog/dog-food/cans-pouches/naturediet/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mutleyandmog.co.uk/dog/dog-fo...</a><br>  <br>  I sometimes heat the food up as it gives a little something different for their pallet|`|LURQBU86aa	She should be eating a high quality puppy food right now such as Canidae, Blue Buffalo or Wellness.

DEdtNBBSaa	There are lots of things that contribute to a cat's excessive licking like an exclusive commercial cat food diet, skin problems and allergies. It can even be stress related. Also, cats will lick because they ache, like with arthritis.  Holistic vets have pretty good success treating skin and allergy problems with certain herbs and homeopathic remedies.  Of course, there are several well known natural products to help relieve stress too, like the Bach line of products and Feliway.  There's more info on cat skin problems and how to deal with them at the link below. Best, Kate|`|gG2CuoF8aa	i think theres a certain type of food to make them stop having as many hairballs.|`|GUEsVdaFaa	It's pretty normal for cats to lick themselves constantly. It's how they groom themselves, and to my knowledge there isn't any way to make them stop. <br>  <br>  If they're puking, it's probably hairballs. This is also very natural but it's a huge annoyance when your baby kitties are in the house. Try getting them a hairball formulated food such as Iams. It will help cut back on the vomiting. If that doesn't help, a vet that my mom used to see told us to give our cats a teaspoon of Vaseline once a month. Apparently it slicks down the hair they've ingested and makes it easier for them to pass in their stool. We've always had house cats and between these two treatments we've never had hair ball vomit in the house.|`|mjy4oRvDaa	If this is a recent development, you definitely want to take them to the vet.  Excessive licking, especially to the point of creating bald patches in their fur, is a symptom of several problems such as allergic reactions or flea bites.|`|x8RA1ENvaa	Yes, it is normal.

3sB49YNnaa	At a month you will feel one or more masses about the size of smallish and slightly elongated grapes.  If you are not experienced it you might still miss them at a month since the horns of the uterus move around and you may just wind up pushing them out of the way.  This is especially true in young sows where the abdomen is pretty tight.  By 5 or 6 weeks, the pups will be obvious and as you get more and more experience, you will pick them up earlier and earlier.  I can sometimes feel them at 2 weeks, almost always by 3 and by 4 for sure.  You need to be very careful about pressure since you can harm the pups if you press too hard
90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	Actually, I've seen black racers nearly six feet long, but still, no where near big enough to do anything to your cat. Black racers will pick their head up to look around, watch their surroundings, keep an eye on potential predators (your cat), etc. He wasn't going to stop watching your cat until he was sure your cat was done watching him, he'd be able to get in a few good nips, but unless he managed a good one on your cat's nose or managed some other way to get away, I have no doubt the cat would have won.|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	They get 2.5 feet max, I really doubt it will kill your cat like the other person said.

First off you should very carefully check each leg to make sure nothing is broken. Keep telling your cat its ok. I know this may sound like a weird thing to do but you must let him know everything is going to be ok. If you think he has no broken legs slowly move him onto something soft  that isn't up too high. You could put a pillow on the ground and put him on that.<br>  <br>   I really think you should call one of your parents and tell them what has happened. Or you could phone someone close by like  a grandma or grandpa or even a friend that has a parent that can drive you to a vet.<br>  <br>   The best thing to do right now is stay calm.

The key is to be brave and just grab one (gently but with enough commitment to get a firm hold of the blighter!), and hug him against you and stroke him. He'll quickly learn you don't mean harm and calm down if you do it regularly enough. Try and do this early as possible so they get used to people. You have to be brave, I know picking one up when they're hiding from you sounds a bit daunting to begin with.|`|rhTCejrtaa	Your right they are just freaked because it is a new place and new people. To get them to like you and be more sociable, hand feed them so they associate you with something good. Then talk to them while you do this in a light happy voice, it'll make them feel calm when they hear you. Also, let them smell you, your sent will be easy from them to remember as the feeder and the nice voice. Make sure you do this a lot, and then move on to picking them up while talking to them. Mine always liked their head scratched or their ears. Let them climb on you, it'll feel scratchy but you'll get used to it. Let them be your shoulder buddie as you walk around the house. Your sent is strong around your neck and will rub off on them, making them very familiar with you. It wont take long for them to love you, they are very smart little creatures!|`|UlOKMInqaa	Offering them a treat (like a small piece of apple) from your hands can lure them out of hiding and show them that you are good not harmful. Handling them everyday is important too, even if they don't want to do it on their own yet.

You dog is in heat.  If that is the case, you need to keep her as far away from the boys as possible.

LoP2CRE2aa	Awwe, what a cute little guy! It's really hard to tell sometimes when they are in the puppy stage like this, but its coat does remind me of a husky. Something about it's face shape makes me think otherwise though....<br>  <br>  How big is the puppy now? how old? Does it have big paws? Its extremely hard to guess just how big a puppy is going to get, but as far as saying whether it will be small, medium, or large, you can tell sometimes just by looking at how big it is at its current age and whether it has extremely large paws or not. (puppies tend to grow into their feet)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|7cUDstdjaa	Don't know from the photo, but you can get a good idea how big it will grow to by the size of its paws.

aeonmRR2aa	Try 'java moss' - it is one of the easiest, cheapest, lowest-light plants, but also likes bright light.  Not vascular, though - you have to tie clumps of it to a rough or porous rock or piece of wood and eventually it will grab hold on its own.  Hornwort is also supposed to be fairly easy and tolerant of low light but like most plants, does better with more light.  Bear in mind that it likes to float (below the surface) rather than being stuck in the substrate.  Duckweed is fairly easy to grow, but they float on/above the surface - duckweed is tiny but reproduces like crazy.  You can't usually buy it but often you can get some for free.<br>  <br>  Read a bit here:<br>  <a href="http://www.plantedtank.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.plantedtank.net/</a><br>  Tons of suggestions in the forums.<br>  <br>  With good light, well, you should be able to grow anything.  Try using fertilizer.  Many people use CO2 if they have lots of plants, super-bright light, and not enough fish, but that is more for growth rate than for actually keeping plants alive.<br>  <br>  The little dry bulbs they sell at some pet stores (walmart pet section, petco) tend to be tolerant of a wide range of conditions.  They contain various species of bulbs (technically rhizomes).<br>  <br>  Note that lighting is generally described by "watts per gallon", considering the wattage of your fluorescent bulbs.  But it is important to have the right spectra - mainly blue and red.  Light specifically for freshwater tanks or plants are best (if you have 2 tubes, I'd use one of each).  Low light is about 1-2 wpg, medium is 3-4, high is anything above maybe 4.0 (these are not strict boundaries).  Stick with low and medium plants.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.  About silk plants.  I added a home-made silk plant to my goldfish tank.  It was some wood sticks glued together, with strips of green silk (from cheap silk boxers that had become worn through and to be discarded).  The reason...  is that goldfish are very destructive and try to put everything in their mouths, so small, delicate live plants don't do well with goldfish.  They loved it!  To death!  They literally ripped the silk strips to shreds after it had weakened from bacteria and algae for a month.  I think they enjoyed sucking the algae off of it.  Next I'm going to try real water hyacinth, which are too big for them to eat.  But just remember that even silk plants can get killed by fish.|`|gGdLDEvZaa	hey you need a florescent light there are different kinds for different plant types the green ones are the easiest to care for the Purple looking ones are hard to plant food helps if you don't have enough fish to feed the plant !|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	java moss and java fern are very simple. I have a brown thumb with both house plants, garden plants, and aquatic plants.  But my java moss/fern are all doing great.|`|hiAKx50Taa	Instead of java moss try peacock moss, pretty much the same but ive been told peacock moss wont overrun the tank.|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Well it depends on two things only, the wattage of the light and the depth of the tank. For most plants you want about 4 - 5 watts per gallon. BUT the wattage is decreased for every 6 inch's of water it needs to penetrate. You don't really need to know all that stuff if you keeping the same light though. <br>  <br>  Hardy and easy to care for plants are Java Fern and Horn wart. Try those first and if you can grow those then you can move on to other plants. Also try adding a Liquid plant food like Flora-pride by tetra or something like that, it will promote growth. You may need a co2 system as well but that's less likely. Good Luck|`|YnCUyvK7aa	What's the purpose for the plant?  I could make some suggestions, but if you're looking for hiding places for fry, vs. general decoration, they'd be different.<br>  <br>  Banana plants are okay if you have good lighting.  If not, they'll die.  A lower light plant that looks similar are the Anubias, and Anubias nana stays small if that's a consideration.<br>  <br>  Crypts [Cryptocroyne] are another easy plant, the same with Aponogeton [betta bulbs] if you have a little better light than the Crypts need.<br>  <br>  For very low light, Java moss [excellent for fry] or Java fern.  I don't know if this was the fern you had, but these can't be *planted* they have to be tied to driftwood so the roots and rhizome are out of the water.  If it was Borneo fern, this isn't a true aquatic plant, even though some chain pet stores will sell them as such.  That's probably why your *variegated with long flat leaves*  died.  This is a Dracena [lucky bamboo] with variegated leaves.  If the leaves are underwater, the plant dies.  <a href="http://www.plantgeek.net/plant-276.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.plantgeek.net/plant-276.htm</a><br>  <br>  Wisteria, Valisneria, and Bacopa are some others that I like.<br>  <br>  If you want a plant that's terrific for nutrient uptake, water sprite is good, and will grow either rooted, or as floating rosettes of leaves.<br>  <br>  Your *super bright* light might be a T5 fluorescent.  These look like regular fluorescent lights but the tubes are narrower, and the light is brighter.  The brightness is just 1 thing to help your plants grow, the color is another.  If the tube is around 6700K that's the best.  Or what's considered *fullspectrum* or *natural daylight* although those terms are a little more vague.
ydshiNrKaa	You need to go on line and google pet friendly apartments in your area.  There are a lot of places that are pet friendly, but many of them have breed and weight restrictions.  You just have to keep looking. It may be easier to rent a home instead of an apartment.  You can find some nice houses to rent, especially now, that cost as much or less then some smaller apartments.  I have a beautiful 4 bedroom, 3 bath, home that I am renting with about 2 acres of land that I rent for $1200 a month, plus utilities which run about $200 a month and I can have pets.  A lot depends on the area you are interested in and the state.|`|Bw18seFqaa	You have to find an apartment that will allow you to have a dog first of all..  otherwise you are out of luck on adopting until you can afford your own place.|`|96O8OAtDaa	When you adopt a dog, the "agency" will check all of your references (including your landlord).  That solves the problem.  It just won't happen.  It's probably a good thing for the dog.

Not very fair, huh?<br>  Wait until you're truly out on your own, have a nice yard, etc., then go to your local humane society and adopt a dog.<br>  Good Luck!|`|17b8d68d2416136c4c415502cc901eeaaa	some apartments won't let you have certain breeds like pit bulls, rottweilers, etc. and some won't let you have dogs at all.<br>  <br>  but if they won't let you have dogs at all, then you shouldn't get a dog b/c if someone finds out, you will just have to give the dog up or may get kicked out of your apartment.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	You would need to find a landlord who accepts tenants with dogs.

JIdDcTXGaa	It may have been something that you may not have noticed, that animals do, a pheromone, a low whimper, a snort, just a deep breath, when a small animal like that acts scared of another animal, it is best to take them away from that animal, just to give him some time to calm down and regroup. It also shows your rat that you are going to protect him, if something scares him or threatens him. Then, at a later time, bring them back together. It may be that he just needed some time away from the dog. Sometimes, even half an hour is enough time to regroup. If you see him get spooked again, make sure you take him back out, cuddling him, letting him know that you are protecting him, not mad at him.|`|olMVfnljaa	The puppy is alot larger than the rat, imagine what it would be like for a huge puppy glaring down at you, at least 20x the size of your own body. It's really quite normal, just like us walking up to a lion and being scared! A bit scary?|`|R0cxoUkDaa	It is because your rat is staring down the nose of an animal much bigger than it.|`|fnLbedPgaa	Because he was scared.  You shouldn't let them play together, dogs are much bigger and even well behaved dogs could do a small rat much damage.  Many dogs have been bred to kill rats - remember - they are not natural buddies, and it only takes one nip on the nose and your friendly dogs could quite easily kill him in the space of a second.<br>  <br>  Your rat would benefit much more from a same sex companion or two, rats are social creatures and should always be kept in same sex pairs or groups.  If yours is male, it may be harder to introduce a rat the same age, but he should accept a pair of babies - depending on how long he's been alone.  Alternatively, if he's older or territorial, neutering him and adding him to a group of girls might be more successful.  Remember to neuter first though!|`|TK1jVIkzaa	Dogs kill rats!

Some nuts are supposed to be poisonous to dogs, but the peanut is not among them.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Peanut butter okay for treats & medication, the bad nuts are Macadamia nuts<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Grapes,-Nuts,-and-Your-Dogs-Health----Foods-that-Fido-should-Avoid&id=20315" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Grapes,-Nuts,-...</a>|`|AA11887983	They are not toxic, but they are not really good for dogs either.  You can use small amounts of peanut butter for things, but as for giving peanuts, I would not do that.  They contain a lot of fat, and that can cause stomach upset and pancreatitis.

283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	And what vet clinic do you work at? 'cause I sure don't want to go there. Even at the shelter that I work at we have a special sharp disposal bin. When I am doing injections in other places in the building and do not have access to it I can always snap the blue cap back on the used needle until I can properly dispose of it. I'm not a vet tech and never went to school for it but even I know that you have to safely dispose of used syringes in the special sharp bin. It has a place that bends and breaks the needle as it goes through the slot so it can't be fished out and reused.<br>  <br>  You should have dug through the bag and found the needle so you could take it to the doctor with you.|`|Bw18seFqaa	if you were really a vet tech, you'd know how to spell Syringe.<br>  <br>  Yes, go to the hospital, you may have an infection.|`|tB7QK6BTaa	Seems to me that things like "sharps safety" would be handled in the course of a Vet Techs schooling.  It also seems to me that disposal of this sort of thing via regular trash is illegal and not done.  Any Vet clinic I've ever been in has special disposal areas for sharps, and medical waste.<br>  <br>  Without knowing what was in the syringe in the first place, it's pretty obvious you'll not be able to guess at the answer.  Of course you should go to the hospital, ideally you'd be taking that syringe with you.|`|t4yBwlr6aa	go to the hospital immediately... Something could be wrong....

3sB49YNnaa	It depends on where you are how many recognized breeds there are.  In the US, there are 13 breeds recognized; American (short smooth coat), American Satin, Abyssinian (short rough coat), Abyssinian satin, Teddy (short kinky coat), Teddy satin, White Crested (like an American but with a white rosette on the forehead), Silkie (long smooth coat) Silkie Satin, Peruvian (long rough coat), Peruvian Satin, Coronet (like a Silkie but with a rosette on the forehead) and Texel (long, smooth coat with curl).  Many countries like the UK, Sweden and Australia also recognize Self Crested (like white crested but with a crest that matches the body color), Alpaca (the Peruvian version of a Texel) and the Moreno (the Coronet version of a Texel).  There are also 2 different hairless breeds, Skinny Pigs and Baldwins.  It is also possible to make a satin version of any of the above which aren't already satinized and doubtless somebody will if they haven't already!|`|2f60e1e58d6965d30ea95d2757b2c721aa	There are 8 breeds of cavys  Abyssinian, American,Coronet,Peruvian,Silkie,Teddy,T... and White Crested

283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	have him go work at a shelter for at least 6 months. Let him go take care of dogs and puppies and let him see how many are dropped off because no one wants them or because someone lost their job. If he works at a kill shelter then he will probably have to help hold the animals for euthanasia (that's if the shelter doesn't just gas the poor things). He will be able to see just how many purebred dogs are dumped at shelters, including tons of GSDs (some that even come in with papers). Maybe then he will understand the work involved and the heartache of the problem of overpopulation.|`|KxjUim7yaa	I like Dances with Cats answer.

Tell him he will have to be there 24/7 at least until they are weaned.  Tell him puppies make a LOT of mess and need cleaning up all the time.  Tell him the cost of raising a litter is enormous, if you do it right and that most breeders are content to break even, and have a nice puppy to continue their line, and to show.  Tell him every time a ****** is put in whelp, you run the risk of losing her, and the puppies, if it all goes wrong (more likely with a novice).<br>  <br>  That's without any of the buy a top qualify ******, go showing, test her for all the appropriate conditions (hips, elbows etc.etc.)|`|VX4aaUS6aa	If you are not experienced breeders then you should absolutely not be breeding especially german shepherds...I have seen way too many inexperienced breeders..tell him he cannot just decide one day that her wants to breed puppies just to make extra money...Breeding is in now way easy and its expensive...you have to worry about the parents health as well as the puppies that means regular vet visits which can add up...He needs to realize that his idea is not a good one...and maybe look into getting him a puppy of his own that you SPAY or NEUTER...Good Luck!!|`|kCDzXCCKaa	You can use the economy as an excuse saying that people aren't going to be wanting dogs when they're losing their jobs.

That's a pretty damn solid point.|`|MeODfbWJaa	First question:  Do you have health papers on both dogs you want to breed?  or their parent's health papers?  if not, you could be breeding terrible genetic problems into those adorable puppies, who will have to live with those health problems for the rest of their lives.<br>  <br>  Second question:  Have you gone through ALL the appropriate and expensive medical tests you need to have on your breeding dogs before you breed?  Every responsible owner/breeder WILL have all those tests done before breeding.  <br>  <br>  No health history papers for the dogs or their parents?  No necessary medical testing before breeding?  Then you will end up with puppies that will not bring in the $$$ you think they will sell for or you wont be able to sell them at all..  Can you prove they wont get hip dysplasia, or eye problems... Can you prove they don't have a genetic heart condition?<br>  <br>  Do not breed unless you know all the possible genetic problems Shepherds can be born with.

You simply cannot go grab two dogs, throw them together and start selling puppies.

kB4EJUKgaa	I think it depends on the area you live in as well. I live in a small city with a decent number of people. The shelters around here charge around $40 and I got mine at my vet for $150. The difference between the two is that the shelters don't always give them the most pain medication and usually, since they do so many a day, it's a sloppier job. It's all up to you though! Good luck!|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Depends on the area<br>  <br>  MYTH: It's too expensive to have my pet spayed or neutered.<br>  <br>  FACT: The cost of spaying or neutering depends on the sex, size, and age of the pet, your veterinarian's fees, and a number of other variables. But whatever the actual price, spay or neuter surgery is a one-time cost—a relatively small cost when compared to all the benefits. It's a bargain compared to the cost of having a litter and ensuring the health of the mother and litter; two months of pregnancy and another two months until the litter is weaned can add up to significant veterinary bills and food costs if complications develop. Most importantly, it's a very small price to pay for the health of your pet and the prevention of the births of more unwanted pets.<br>  <br>  Low cost spay/neutering<br>  <a href="http://www.lovethatcat.com/spayneuter.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lovethatcat.com/spayneuter.ht...</a>|`|p7oi3P06aa	about 60 dollars. give or take 10/20 dollars pending on sex of cat and vet you take it to|`|1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	You can call the local humane society and they offer discounts to have your cat or dog spayed or neutered. I think it requires filling out an application but it is worth it. When I called about my dog, they said it would be 50. after they reviewed the app. It is more expensive to go to a regular vets office. Just a suggestion.|`|7be888cba10a972887506bba12c3d350aa	normal is right about $100, thats including the surgery, overnight stay & pain meds. BUT you can search local adds (and the craigslist for your area) for low cost spay clinics....where about are & Ill try to help you find one. When I lived in FL I found one for $30 for females, BUT they did not stay overnight you took them right after surgery...I would go for the overnight stay....its easier on the kitty & you. Let me know if you want help trying to find a clinic BEst of luck|`|VX4aaUS6aa	Depending on where you go...a vet charges around $300-$400, but if you go to your local shelter they usually charge something like $100...|`|t4yBwlr6aa	Where i live in Georgia, it only costs like 35.00 for a female to be spayed but then you have to buy the 12.00 rabies shot, so... i would say around 55.00 to 65.00 in all. It would be best to call YOUR local vets and get their prices. But i will say this: Cats will be in better health and happier after they're spayed/neutered.<br>  Hope this helps and good luck !
Xobbmd7Saa	I don't reccomend riding in rubber tall boots because it is bad for your leg position.<br>  <br>  You could get a good quality paddock boot since you aren't showing and then just put some half chaps (either synthetic leather or suede or real) I have synthetic leather boots and half chaps and it works great and nobody can tell the difference.|`|xjDMsTcdaa	I would go with the half chaps, they are less expensive and a lot more comfortable. Unless your planning on going to shows I wouldn't go with tall boots...|`|Bda3CPhjaa	Definitely get half chaps and short paddock boots. They are extremely easy to care for, and give you very very good grip. It is 100x easier getting your heals down. They give your ankles freedom, allowing them to be flexible. At first they feel a little stiff and weird, but after a few times riding with them they will be your ankles best friend.|`|CoAc5hS9aa	Only because you are growing, I would go with half-chaps. You can get nice leather ones for $70-$80. Or cheaper ones for around $30. Especially if you won't be showing I would not spend money on tall boots.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.equestriancollections.com/storeitems.asp?department=Ladies&cc=24&radSort=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.equestriancollections.com/sto...</a>|`|58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	No boot in the world will keep your heels down, that only comes with experience and training, though a good boot will 'allow' you to flex your ankle more.<br>  <br>  I'd go for short boots and chaps for now.|`|t4yBwlr6aa	I'd get another pair of good, tall boots....

I have both tall boots (one pair for showing, one pair for riding) and paddock boots with half chaps. <br>  <br>  In the winter, I ride in Mountain Horse paddock boots with half chaps, and my feet are so nice and toasty warm, even in zero degree weather. Also with the paddock boots and half chaps, I can get more layers on under my breeches than I can squeeze into my tall boots - sometimes I ride with a layer of silk long underwear, fleece pants and then my breeches if it's really cold! (By the way, I ride as part of a parks department enforcement patrol, which is done mostly at a walk for 2-3 hours at a time in all weather - I don't wear the fleece when I'm in a lesson or riding my own horse for an hour because then I'm really working!)<br>  <br>  I tend to only use my tall boots in spring and fall, when the temperatures aren't so extreme as to cause my legs to sweat or freeze. Unless, of course, it's a show and then the tall show boots come out.
lyOpiCvcaa	he probably has an ear infection take him to the vet and he will prescribe special drops that you will have to apply them either daily or once a week|`|AA11887983	You need to get your vet to do a cytology of the gunk in the ears.  That way, they know if it is yeast or bacteria causing the problem, and they can prescribe the proper medication.  OTC medications will most likely not help, and can be dangerous.  Your vet also needs to look to make sure that there is no compromise to the eardrums.|`|9kTejB0uaa	The ONLY way to sort this out is to take him to your vet so he can look right down his ears and see what's going on.  There is no point buying otc preparations - in fact, you can make the condition worse.|`|9AHTNcanaa	At this point your dog probably has either a yeast infection, bacterial infection or maybe even ear mites. You will need a trip to a vet to clear these things up.  Otomax, chlorohexadene, and ketoconazole are great products that your vet can provide you with to clear up the yeast or the bacterial infection.  <br>  <br>  After you get this current infection cleared up I recommend either using a flush like T8 Keto from your vet (which is also what I use in my lab and cocker's ears) or the R-7 3 step ear cleaner system (which my groomer uses).  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2751575" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a>  for your weekly cleanings.<br>  <br>  Even if you don't buy all three steps I find that the third step works great at drying and cooling the itchiness.<br>  <br>  <br>  As well,  the last thing you should be considering is if this ear scratching is caused by a food allergy.  If your dog has a lot of waxy buildup, or chronic ear infections (especially in one particular ear) this could likely be an allergy.  My vet recommended switching to a food without corn, wheat or beef.  Nutro Lamb and Rice is a great brand.  It really helped my lab and cocker spaniel out!!  (not to mention it is just healthier in general for the dogs)<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!<br>  <br>  ~Samantha|`|Bw18seFqaa	take the dog to the vet and find out what's wrong with his ears.. the vet can prescribe proper treatment.<br>  <br>  You may have made things worse by sticking cream in his ears.|`|AA11840819	Go to the pet store and buy some Odoban(sp) which kills the yeast that builds in a dogs ears.|`|sGoEj6qsaa	It's an ear infection and you need to get antibiotic drops from the vet.
IrdZKYT3aa	Hello!  You are right to worry about a sitter, in my experience if they have never owned a fish, they WILL overfeed.  I lost one of my boys to this, best friend massively over fed them : (  lost one and ended up with fin rot and dropsy in the other two.<br>  Definitely get him the tank though, it'll make heating him easir and cut down on stressful water changes.  They have a light bio load, so putting him in there alone while it cycles should be fine.<br>  I have a 5 gallon hex for one of my males, it's perfect.  The flows not too strong, more of a bubbling so he's not stressed.  I'm able to keep his temp 78-80 degrees so he's nice and warm. This way the water quality stays impeccable<br>  As for the vacation feeders, they are available but I would never put one in an unfiltered tank.  They break down and add waste to the tanks water and funk up the ph level, and with you gone and not monitoring it the water quality will drop.  In the heated and filtered tank, it should be fine, just make sure to check quality and perform a water change when you return.<br>  Best of Luck!
Xx7WwVXRaa	put them in a room together in separate cages, that way they'll get used to the smell of eachother. that's what we're trying to do right now with our 2 bunnies, and it seems to be working. they'll acclimate eventually. now our bunnies will sniff eachother from each side of the baby gate, and seem interested, except when one goes over to the other's cage area. most of all, don't put the baby in the other's cage. rabbits are very territorial. you may never be able to keep them in a cage together.|`|meMF69tXaa	Separate them. I keep my rabbits housed seperately for this very same reason. My younger doe attacks my buck if she gets the chance and it's not worth the risk of injury for each of them to be friendly to one another. All are in their cages but close enough where they can see and smell one another. They have a seperate play area where they can see and smell one another.
BQHbEwE8aa	My horse wasnt fond of puddles, then he experienced his first ever winter and gradually got used to them because our village got flooded.<br>  <br>   I still find that he will go through clear puddles, but is still wary of muddy puddles where he can't see the bottom. These muddy puddles have more of a reflection too, and he isn't keen on them.<br>  <br>  As for his frog shedding, that is normal. You could just take it off gently if it is literally hanging off.<br>  <br>  As for biting your sister's horse, ermm, I personally would not bite him at all if he did nothing to you. <br>  Two horses together will form their pecking order whether you are there or not. This is perfectly normal. It sounds like your sister's horse is dominant over your horse and this will not change even if you bite him again.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	You could cut off the part of the frog that is hanging but don't pull it off. I don't know what part or how deep it is so it is hard to say just cut it off is the best way to address that.<br>  <br>  And I would be careful bitting a horse like that, thats a good way to get bit yourself, probably not the best thing to do. If his head is not secure he can reach around and get your leg or your side. <br>  <br>  Jenny|`|t4yBwlr6aa	If the piece of frog is ready to come off, i would pull it off gently.... and it's usually not a good idea to bite a horse unless they nip or bite at YOU, and then you can nip them back on the nose, or so i've HEARD.... I've never actually done this... but i HAVE heard of it being done. Thanks and good luck
AA10270018	Giant gourami is a long lived pet that has a personality comparable to that of a dog, some live longer than a dog. Some are peaceful, some are semi aggressive. Giant gourami because of its size should be in a specimen tank by himself.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	If you did any research at all on these fish, you would have realized that this is something all giant gouramis do. They are extremely territorial. Youll need to get rid of something, or the gourami will kill them.<br>  <br>  Im guessing the care sheets came from petsmart or petco?

qeR967J7aa	She needs to have a partial amputation with the skin sewn closed, then antibiotics after.  But 700$ is a ripoff, sorry.  Call the Humane Society.  Maybe they can do the surgery or recommend a low cost vet.  Is there a vet school in the area?  They do low cost surgeries.  If you leave it, it will probably get infected which can quickly spread all over, and kill her.  That's just the facts.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	well im not sure how a vet can predict what should happen if hes not even seen the cat, sounds like money grabbing if you ask me .get yourself another vet who might try to save the tail|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Ask a different vet-shouldn't be that much for a tail to be partial amputated because of injury<br>  <br>  The tail doesn't have to be completely amputated because the whole tail wasn't injured. it only the top-Maybe the vet didn't understand what part of the tail was off|`|OLXv3DEAaa	You could try calling the vet back and see if you can make payments on the cost of amputation? Or call animal hospitals and see if they will do that for you.<br>  I think only the vet can really tell you if there is any other way to treat this besides amputation. Once you bring the cat in and they see it they can give you a better idea of the options. <br>  <br>  You can't just not take the cat to the vet though- first of all its illegal (animal cruelty/neglect) and second the cats tail is part of its spinal cord, leaving it untreated can cause all kinds of problems and infection, etc.|`|AA11887983	Ok, they really should not be quoting you until they see the cat.  You need to get it seen tonight.  It probably hurts!  And there may be something that can be done instead of amputation.

VX4aaUS6aa	Her stomach is definitely filling up with fluid or blood, take her to another vet to get a second opinion and have them do x-rays, she could have eaten something that has gotten stuck...or it could be number of other things...|`|AA11887983	If the dog is worse, get her seen tonight.  <br>  <br>  Did the vet do blood work, and xrays or an ultrasound of her abdomen?  If not, you need to do it now.  <br>  <br>  Vitamin K is used to treat clotting problems with the blood, such as with liver failure and rodenticide (rat/mouse poison) poisoning.  It does not cause the blood to clot, but it is needed to make certain factors in the blood that are part of that process. <br>  <br>  I would be worried that if the dog is bleeding internally, she has either a splenic or liver tumor that has ruptured, has an immune problem causing her to destroy her own platelets ( cells that assist in blood clotting) or that she got into rodenticide and the medication is not enough.  <br>  <br>  You need to have an answer and you need to do it now.  This is very serious.  All of these can be fatal if not treated.  And if the vet just put her on vitamin k without any testing, that is really not a good thing.|`|GTwVNeHraa	No, but take her to the vet!!!|`|DnnHqgwGaa	I suggest you let her have an x-ray if she didn't take one yet. Maybe she swallowed something that blocked her flow of blood. I am sure this is pretty serious but don't worry. If you act soon enough, she's going to be alright. Sometimes, Vitamin K works but if it doesn't, you should ask the vet about surgery. I hope your dog will be well soon! :)|`|ZCCFzvMBaa	I would order an x-ray of the dog to see if she has ingested a foreign object (plastic toy or something).

AA11887983	If you think that your dog is ill, get him checked by a vet, tonight.  He may just seem hot, like people do when they are flushed, but not have an actual fever.  And shaking can indicate pain, fever, fright, or a bunch of other things.  <br>  <br>  If you don't get him checked out tonight, go tomorrow if he is still not acting right.  Do not give him anything as you do not know what is going on.  <br>  <br>  If you decide to take his temperature, do it rectally with a small thermometer.  The normal body temperature of a dog is 101.5-102.5.  If it is higher than 104, he needs to see a vet tonight because something is going on.  Does not necessarily sound like a rat poison thing.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Any time you are concerned about your dog, especially puppies and the older dog, the vet is the person to see.

Definitely adopt a dog from a shelter!!  Yes, Yes, Yes!!!<br>  All my dogs throughout my life have come from shelters and they have all been wonderful, loving family pets.   But let me just tell you about my current dog .... This is his story and there are some real surprises!:<br>  <br>  I adopted my dog from the local Humane Society where I volunteer.  I work with the dogs to socialize and train them and I've been trained to work with even the most difficult dogs.  But one of them totally stole my heart - a medium-sized, all brown shepherd mix.  No one paid any attention to him.  He was quiet and shy.   <br>  He only responded to me and I just had to have him.  And getting him was a struggle!  I had to get my lease changed to allow pets and I had to convince the Humane Society that I REALLY wanted THIS ONE SPECIAL DOG.  Finally, everyone agreed and I was able to adopt him.    But here's what I didn't know about him:<br>  "G", my dog, was already fully trained - not just house-broken.  He knows "Sit", "Down", "Heel", "Fetch", "Find", "Go to Bed" and, coolest of all, "Guard"!  And he can search by scent in total darkness!  But that's not all ....<br>  I was able to identify his breed and had it confirmed by several vets.  One vets told me that a trained dog of G's breed typically costs more than $50,000!  That right, $50K!<br>  No, I'm not lying or exaggerating any of this.  And, No, he is certainly NOT for sale.<br>  But here's my point:  Definitely adopt a dog from a shelter!

SZOMVGBRaa	Have they bred for you yet ?  Just because you bought a breding pair that has bred doesn't mean you posses the skills to condition them to breed. <br>  <br>  First off NO tank mates, other fish scare Discus and will make them stress. 2nd you need a 6.5 PH level, no higher, if you can't get your PH that low forget about breeding them.  They need SUPER clean water, really low nitrates especially, DAILY water changes are recommended.  Then you need to warm up the water a bit, about 88 Degrees, which should be up from your normal 84 degrees it should be.<br>  Then live or frozen food and good foods, feed them three times a day High Quality pellets or flakes with Blood Worms, Brine Shrimp and a Beef heart blend. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rockymountaindiscus.com/Discus_Fish_Care.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rockymountaindiscus.com/Discu...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.discusfishinfo.com/2008/11/breeding-discus-fish-discus-breeding-success-essentials/" rel="nofollow">http://www.discusfishinfo.com/2008/11/br...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck to you<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Here's a good site to help you more.

bDPVRtCNaa	No longer than you need to. Get the twenty gallon, and cycle it as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  The space given by the twenty gallon is necessary for the oranda to grow. If a fish cannot grow, than they cannot be healthy.|`|SohrsIBoaa	nice wen. make it less then a month. shes gonna get a lot bigger. like 10 more inches. and be careful when you switch her to her knew tank, you probably already know shes sensitive to cold water.|`|AA11901352	Yes your fish will be fine for a few months in this small tank with no ill effects.  You fish will not get stunted since with goldfish it takes years for this to happen.  What happens with goldies a chemical reaction happens in the brain telling the fish not to grow so quickly.  The fish just won't grow much until it is in a larger area.  Keep your eye on the water quality and your fish will be fine for a few months.
dZtToTIbaa	It could have grown out of its shell and needed a larger one to go in to.  They can't live outside of their shell for long.  They will dry up and die.  Hermit crabs are very social and friendly to one another so i doubt that the other one attacked it.  Make sure you have extra shells in there from now on if you don't.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	Land hermit crabs don't leave their shells because they need a bigger one. A hermit crab will stay in a shell that is too large or too small as long as need be. They only leave their shells when something is wrong. Loosing limbs are a sign of stress or illness. I don't think the other crab attacked your crab.<br>  Moulting and leaving shells are 2 different things. And Hermit crabs don't drink out of sponges. I don't know what pet store started this but my hermit  crabs would love to have a long talk with them. Mine drink out of dishes even the tiny ones get in the deep bowls and no one has drowned. <br>  A few things could have cause the animals death<br>  <br>  1) What are the heat and humidity conditions in your tank? If the humidity is below 70% the animal could have been unable to breath for the past two months slowly causing the gills to dry out. If the temperature is too cold ( ideally it should be 75f-80f)  The animal may die as result of that after being exposed to the cold too long<br>  <br>  2) Check for mites. Small red, grey, or white bugs scurrying on the crabs body or shell.  Mites are the bane of all crab keepers<br>  <br>  3) What diet was the animal on? Hermit crab pellets contain Ethoxyquin which is also found in some pesticides. Table salt and other preservatives are harmful to them.<br>  <br>  4) was the salt and fresh water free of chlorine and heavy metals? If not the gills may have been burned <br>  <br>  5) sometimes we never know. Being taken from the wild is hard on crabs and sometimes the damage done in transport or pet shops takes a while for the animal to succumb to it.|`|r0u26SYGaa	he might have outer molted, it is when it looks like they are dead, but they are really in there shell.....|`|BNKBs4Peaa	It could be, but I had two hermit crabs once. Did you make sure that they were misted daily, and had enough water? <br>  <br>  This is the most common reason found in hermit crab deaths. Its owners forgetting to mist and refill their water. It's not ALL your fault, hermit crabs are just kind of sensitive.<br>  <br>  It may have been that one attacked, but it would be rare. The limb probably fell off from being so stiff.|`|VYPblEgnaa	hermit crabs as they grow need bigger shells. a hermit crab cannot stay out of its shell very long because of thier body....and yea i guess its possible while out of its shell the other grabbed a hold of it. but if so i almost could guarantee it was after the hermit was already dead. your other hermit crab sooner or later will need a bigger shell....so try investing in some :) and also i dont know what u you for thier water but when i used to have some ( i used to have ALOT lol) the best thing that was reccomended to me was a sea sponge. it holds the water in and they can climb and drink at the same time. well good luck and i hoped i helped.<br>  <br>  <br>  oh yea  p.s. hermit crabs LOVE peanut butter lol
IrdZKYT3aa	Most likely fin rot, and opportunistic bacteria, but it could also be tail biting, usually from stress, or boredom in cramped tanks.<br>  Not ich, this presents in white spots or granules along the body.<br>  Is it a heated tank?  It should be, get his temp up to about 84-86 and add some aquarium salt.  Both will help relieve stress, increase slime coat, and help effectively induce a "fever" to help him bun off the bacteria.  Also grab a med for fin rot, pretty much any fish store will offer multiple brands. Normaly heat and salt in accordance with clean water will stop and solve this problem,    but you need heavy guns with the rot so close to the main body.     Honestly, with it this bad,  he may not be able to turn around : (<br>  He needs perfect water quality right now, it's like an open wound and the clean water his "dressings".<br>  Is it filtered?  The filter may be too strong, this can stress them and cause tears for the bacteria to grab hold of.  Does he have sharp/rough ornaments or plastic plants?  I learned the hard way plastic plants can and will tear them up, now I only use silk ones.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	add salt to the water. increase the tep. they like up to 84 degrees. your fish has Ich it is a fungus. the water must be too cold. add some salt asap|`|i0muV1GZaa	how many do you have in the same tank?<br>  if you have more than one male fighting fish the will fight to the death for the tank... there territorial<br>  <br>  if not then i have no idea|`|JxmJg37Iaa	it probably got bitten off by another fish|`|Rdpv91NTaa	it is called fin rot look it up on fish diseases then rush out and get him medication fast!|`|IVSIiFrzaa	where areyou

Actually if you add, you are messing up the recipe, but I guess we all do it.  I occasionally add half a hard boiled egg/cottage cheese also.|`|f4c8bc1971cd1455d61d7a1ad090cf12aa	nature diets is a good one not in a tin but a plastic container and about 72p a pack.|`|J5hsCONRaa	Plenty of dogs do fine on just biscuit alone - I for one will not feed my Westie tinned food of any kind as you are more likely to turn the dog into a "picker" (ie.leave the biscuits, only eat tin so then you only buy tin = way more expensive and not good for the dog at all!)<br>  <br>  If you want him to have meat, why not get him a meaty bone from the butchers or supermarket as a treat every now and then? Trust me, health-wise, biscuit is MUCH better for your dog and helps keep the teeth clean as well. Tinned food is mainly water anyway.
A3A5JTBoaa	Your budgie (the type of parakeet you have, the way a cocker spaniel is a type of dog) is still nervous around you, and it will take time and effort on your part to get him feeling better. Remember your size compared to your budgie. The first joint of your thumb is probably the size of his head, and your whole hand is massive! Budgies are prey animals, which means they believe that everything is going to try and eat them until proven otherwise. You've already made good progress, getting him to step onto your finger, you just need to consolidate that progress into making him comfortable enough to come all the way out. <br>  <br>  First you should find out what your bird really likes. Many budgies like some kinds of fruit, but it's not really a treat that they'll perform for. If you want to give your budgie fruit, mash it up with his food and be prepared to try a half dozen times before he'll even taste it. Everything is dangerous by default when you are his size! Most budgies really like millet spray, a treat you can get at any pet store. Millet spray is many clusters of small millet seeds on a stem, and it's a delicacy for budgies. It shouldn't be part of their everyday diet, since it's almost all fat, but it's a great motivator. <br>  <br>  Get your budgie acquainted with millet by giving him little sprigs in his dish for a few days. When he tries it, he'll realize he likes it. After he's eating it reliably, you can start offering it to him when he steps on your fingers. Don't get it too close to his face or he'll step back, make him lean out just a little for it. Once he's used to getting his treat when he steps up, start moving your hand while you feed him. There will be false starts, maybe a lot of them. But if you are patient, eventually he probably won't notice too much when you take him out of the cage. Familiarity is everything for your bird. It may take a hundred tries, but once he gets used to you, your hand, and coming out of the cage to get good things from you, he won't be afraid anymore. Good luck!|`|lyOpiCvcaa	lol i used to have a parakeet that would do the same thing i think its that they are comfortable in their cage try taking him out and getting him to stand on ur finger outside of the cage. make sure doors and windows are close just in case. and ruffling of feathers when u talk to them or are around them mean they dont feel threatened and are relaxed|`|5d8cda11147363f74448679f58829463aa	How long have you had your parakeet? He still seems very nervous. I had one when I was younger. It took a long while to build a good bond with him. Parakeets aren't too big on fruit the way cockatiels and parrots are. I'd suggest using small sunflower seeds and just spending as much hands on time with it you can. Gently cup the parakeet and bring him out of the cage and hold him for a while, petting him and such when you can and eventually you will get him used to the contact. It's not a quick thing, but over time you can do so. You can also even teach him to say a few words if you're lucky, but only if he learns words before whistles, or he'll never grasp it, they aren't as capable as larger birds.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	The best bet is to get a hand raised parakeet. The ones they sell in big pet stores are not hand raised and are nearly impossible to train.|`|E7cFbNn9aa	umm, i just got one today, and i read somewhere, that when they ruffle their feathers it means theyre happy, and like it usually happenes when they see their owner and stuff.. so yea, you got aparakeet who loves you:)

oerG1fo6aa	Green tree frogs are generally good eaters and feed exclusively on insects. <br>  Crickets can make up the bulk of the diet. <br>  Crickets and other food insects should be gut loaded (fed nutritious foods before feeding them to the frogs). For more on dealing with crickets as prey see "Raising Crickets for Food." <br>  In addition to gut loading, the crickets should be dusted with a calcium and multivitamin supplement a couple of times a week. <br>  Fruit flies, houseflies, moths and other insects can also be fed if available. <br>  Tree frogs will likely eat more in the spring and summer months than in the winter. Smaller frogs should be fed daily, while larger frogs can be fed daily or every other day, using body condition as a guide (i.e. if getting obese, cut down the feedings).<br>  <br>  You really don't need to breed crickets.  They're cheap, about 10 for $1.00.|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	They usually will not eat things unless they are moving, but sometimes you get an exception- you can try dead food and see if it works.<br>  <br>  Meal worms are fine, but you want to vary the diet- include lots of different things.<br>  <br>  Crickets- just throw them in the tank and make sure the cage is enclosed. Only throw in a few and make sure that he eats all that you throw in there (crickets that are still alive may get hungry and start eating your frog causing infections). Because they might eat your frog, you want him to be awake when you put the crickets in.<br>  <br>  Keep crickets alive- I have a 10 gal aquarium with a fine mesh lid. Put egg cartons in there for hiding. Food- oats, dog food, veggies, etc<br>  Water- they can drown, so I would suggest getting cricket water, which is a gel, that you can find at most pet stores. Substrate- I use newpaper or Ecoearth.<br>  <br>  to feed: scoop a few up in your hands, paper towel tubing, etc (most crickets won't easily jump out of a 10 gal aquarium) and put the lid back on. I prefer the toliet paper tube because they hide in there, then you can pick it up, clamp a hand over both sides, and they won't escape while you transport them.|`|yyJo3ybBaa	At night, put him in a small cage with the crickets. Don't leave him there too long or the crickets will bite him.|`|MwqcsiTDaa	a) When I owned three treefrogs, they would not eat anything that was not alive and moving. I would stick to live mealworms and crickets, <br>  <br>  b) however, you can try freezed-dried, it just depends on your pets themselves.<br>  <br>  c) Feeding them crickets it quite easy. You simply open the frog's cage/tank and put them in. I used to put about 50 small crickets in with three treefrogs, once per week.<br>  <br>  d) if you are going to keep crickets yourself, then buy a small plastic cage to keep them in. They have a calcium/water jello-looking type cricket food that you can put in the cage to keep them alive. Also, put a small peice of egg-carton or a few (depending on how many crickets you keep) to keep them from smooshing eachother. <br>  <br>  e) you can put all the crickets in his cage at once, however, this does not guarantee that they will all survive. If it's a single treefrog, I would give him about 25 small crickets once a week.<br>  <br>  f) Depending on what type of cage you have, there can be a small opening for a light. I would usually just put more crickets in that way, or wait until the frogs had eaten all of the crickets first. <br>  <br>  g) you can keep extra crickets in a smaller seperate cage<br>  <br>  h) you can put crickets in at anytime.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|RkK673VHaa	Do tree frogs eat anything that's not alive? they hunt via movement so they probably wont <br>  <br>  Can I feed them freeze-dried mealworms? i wouldnt freeze dried food looses alot of its nutrional value<br>  <br>  Also, if I do have to feed them crickets, how does that go? put calcium powder in bag, put crickets into bag, shake, put crickets into vivarium <br>  <br>  What do I feel the crickets, and how do I keep them alive?<br>  keep em warm, put a bit of fruit in there every couple of days<br>  <br>  Do I put all of the crickets in his home at one time, or just a few?<br>  feed only a few every other day for adults every day for juvi's if you pt all of them in thye might bite, injure or stress out the frog <br>  <br>  How do I keep the other crickets from escaping, while I put the others into his home for him to eat?<br>  only open one corner of the tub <br>  <br>  What do you keep the crickets in?<br>  the boxes they come in <br>  <br>  Can I put the crickets in his home, while he's asleep, or do I need to wait until nighttime?<br>  i would put them in during the evening

A good pair of sharp scissors is needed for the tail, legs and feet, to trim the feathers. <br>  <br>  As for the short haired dogs, the best ones I have used are either a zoom groom, or a shedding blade.  They get that short hair off pretty well.|`|Bw18seFqaa	the groomer does NOT sedate the dogs..  that is illegal to do.  For one, it would be prescribing medications without a licence!  Only a VET can do that!<br>  <br>  For the golden, either a slicker brush with long teeth or undercoat rake<br>  <br>  the boxer, a rubber brush like a zoom groom<br>  <br>  for the cairn, a slicker with shorter teeth
LOH6UVh7aa	I don't think you'll get that for him. Especially if he needs more training. & In the add don't put that he had bad habits, that now are fixed. I'd leave that out. & What does a paint trainer do different from a regular trainer?? Sounds like a $$$ gimmick.  I would not sell him yet if that is what your going to hold out for $ 5000.00. But if you are willing to take a loss then I would list him for $3000.00.  I would not buy a horse(gelding) that needed more training for any more then  $3000.00. Good luck.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Yes, the market is down... but not for everyone. People have had the most trouble selling lower end horses (anything $5,000 and under). These horses are generally being looked at and purchased by middle class families who have been hit the hardest by the economy crisis. <br>  <br>  Put the additional training into your guy. He sounds beautiful and people are always looking for bigger paints. He is young which is a major plus and double registered. Get him in working condition and advertise him for $10,000 negotiable to the right home. A good friend of mine just sold her young TB mare prospect for $12,000. The people who are willing to pay that much money for a horse are still around, just a little more difficult to find. Be patient and advertise, advertise, advertise!|`|ThsyiJLEaa	From what your saying, I would post him at $8,000 OBO (or best offer) though me personally would be ambitious with a $12,000 figure, still coupled with the OBO.  That way, you get the psychological effect of seeing the 8 grand figure, but you don't stand as much chance scaring away a potential buyer because you look flexible in your pricing.  <br>  <br>  Oh and the hard to canter part, don't worry about that.  Most people (myself included) would LOVE to have a horse that needs some prodding to lope off over a horse that lopes at the slightest hint.  Those are better for novices that don't have that whole "feel" thing down yet.|`|aRen4EBPaa	Sounds like a nice horse you have. Well, since the aconimy is so bad the price is going to have to go down. Since he is hard to canter and is lazy and has some bad habbits the price will go down again. BUT... Since he is young, a beautiful paint, has been trained, the price won't go too low. Also a good thing was to show him, so people can ask you how he did at it. The proper price for your horse at this time of year would be...$3,000 - $4,000. It the aconimy wasn't so bad then it would be around $4,500 - $5,000.

9kceDOTraa	Kyle,<br>  <br>  When you talk about fish like this, it's extremely helpful to name them by species, rather then say cichlid, because cichlid comprises over 3000 different species, and from many different parts of the world, and having many various different needs.  In your case, you are talking about Labidochromis Caereleus.  This is a Malawi Mbuna, but one of the few mildly aggressive types.  I see no problem with them going with dither fish like Danio's, but that CAE may be a problem when it gets bigger.  CAE's have a bad habit of attaching themselves to fish when they get older to suck mucus and slime off them, which is a very bad thing, because the mucus and slime coating on a fish is the primary defense mechanism against pathogens.  I'd not keep a CAE with these fish.<br>  <br>  A Silver Dollar probably can work but I wouldn't use these either.  Silver Dollars, while like Zebra Danio's have evolved from waters that are softer and more acidic then Lake Malawi, but Zebra Danio's are more hardy and can probably adapt.  You would want to make sure your tank is near Lake Malawi conditions, and if it is not, you can shape the water chemistry to that.<br>  <br>  It seems like you are a bit new into African cichlid keeping, so I do suggest you start reading over documents and getting input from other professional keepers on:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.monsterfishkeepers.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.monsterfishkeepers.com</a><br>  <a href="http:///www.cichlid-forum.com" rel="nofollow">http:///www.cichlid-forum.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nycichlids.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nycichlids.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.eastcoastcichlids.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.eastcoastcichlids.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gcca.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gcca.com</a>|`|9e6a66fe8592d126c6b207054fb2fa7aaa	Cichlids are beautiful fish and they live well amongst themselves.  They are pretty territorial so it's good to have a lot of rocks and plants to give them their space and not mix them up with too many breeds.  They look very calm but can become agressive if they feel threatened.  If you do mix them make sure the tank is very large.  If you plan on keeping them outside make sure to use a heater they are not use to cold weather.|`|ybaeu04Baa	The types of fish that you want do not live well with each other.  Cichlids should only be with other cichlids.  Cichlids require a specific ph level that should not fluctuate.  The other fish: the zebra danios, algae eater, tiger barbs, and silver dollars can be in the same tropical environment with each other.|`|aViat5kdaa	Hi there. I have a tank with cichlids in it.

u3Hdoeiqaa	No aquariums are not good for guinea pigs. They have extremely poor ventilation - guinea pigs are too big to be housed in them and produce a lot of mess - this causes a build up of ammonia which is very bad for your pet's health.<br>  <br>  Aquariums are also far too small. A pair of guinea pigs need a cage that is at least 7.5 - 8 sq feet.<br>  <br>  The best cages are C+C cages. Commercial cages are far too small. I have also used hutches and other home made pens but now I have a C+C I wouldn't be without it. They are really easy to make, can be whatever design you like, and work out much cheaper than the largest commercial cages.<br>  <br>  Check out <a href="http://www.guineapigcages.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.guineapigcages.com</a>|`|OrvTG44laa	Aquariums are bad for guinea pigs.

When you see him start trying to climb out, get him out. If you are not in a pool then make sure he has access to land and watch him closely. When he is tired, he will slow down and his body might not be held up as far above the water. You could always buy him a life vest (check the link).

F3FrZ7eAaa	Well, ones a turtle and the other is a tortoise. That right there means the turtle is going to need a aquatic (with platform) or semi-aquatic home. Personally, I would get a Russian Tortoise. You can house them in a large cement mixing tray, a kiddy sandbox, a large rubbermaid/sterlite tub or tank. You can actually make your own, and it wouldn't be hard at all since they don't need a roof. You can use a tank, but remember they need a fair amount of room, and Tortoises really don't understand the concept of glass. They will walk into it a lot. It's noisy, and can hurt him! If you're planing on using a tank I recommend that you place tape or paper across the tank, but so he knows his boundaries. <br>  <br>  They stay small-- 4-8 inches. That depends on gender, and how well you feed them. Good luck. Oh, I'd also like to throw in there that Tortoises smell a lot better than turtles do!|`|pjggSVKKaa	well just ask the pet shop owner some questions on the russian tortoises habitat and whether you have the right environment for the russian tortoise
gjrbp1Aoaa	Boy cats can be wonderful uncles.<br>  <br>  My oldest boy was pretty gruff when I met him.  He lived with my roommate but came away with me when I moved (he disagreed with the stray dog she adopted). He was a doting uncle to my parents' kittens for the month or so he was around them and later when I got kitten for my boyfriend he actually let the guy try to nurse on him! The woman we adopted him from said that it wasn't uncommon, but I was certainly surprised. Even now, almost 6 years later, they still groom each other.<br>  I have 6 kitties (only 1 female) and they all groom each other.  The younger ones seem to be the most spoiled. They're one big, fluffy family.<br>  <br>  The most touching uncle cat experience I saw was a feral kitty (not neutered) who was caring for a teen kitten (5-6 months old).  He hung out with the little guy and brought him along to eat where we feed the ferals. He would pull food out of the bowl so the little guy could keep eating and he could still get a little food for himself.  I ended up capturing that kitten because I hoped he was still young enough to domesticate. The first night inside the kitten cried and cried and the uncle cat was outside crying back.  It made me cry too. I went outside and talked to the cat. He wouldn't let me near him but he looked at me and seemed to listen. I felt so guilty for separating them. He ended up dying several months later, most likely from an infection from a serious cat fight. But the kitten is grownup and is a very sweet little pet. He was happy to meet my kitties and have them as new uncles and they were sweet to him and helped him adjust to his new life. <br>  <br>  sorry to ramble on like that - but even un-neutered males can be great with kittens.  They should all be neutered, of course, but the motivation for toms to kill kittens is to get mom to come into heat again. So once the kitten is older they usually don't want to hurt it until it's a mature adult. The tom who played uncle to my kitty actually ended up being his uncle. We nabbed the kitten's mom too and she promptly had another litter, including one that looked just like the uncle.|`|xHxKDQ80aa	All my cats do this to each other, three males and a female(the youngest).

Doesn't matter if they're male or female or old or young.<br>  <br>  My very timid older cat will lick the other cats if they walk up to her, but I think she does that out of fear/nervousness, and they never return the favor.  You can tell she's thinking "maybe if I lick him he won't beat me up".  I think it can be a submissive thing too.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	if he is neutered, it is just how cats socialize. they groom other members of the pride.<br>  <br>  older cats also teach the younger ones, he might be saying, you missed a spot.<br>  <br>  it is also an exchange of scents.
stCyrS4Eaa	Everyone is right. Do not "bathe" your rabbit. Only spot clean areas that get overly soiled. Your rabbit will clean himself. They have natural oils in their skin and fur. You do not want to deplete them by bathing him.<br>  <br>  Do not feed lettuce, even for a treat. Get a good quality rabbit pellet. A small amount of alfalfa hay is fine too, along with pellets. Always have plenty of fresh water available. A small slice of apple every few days or fresh leaf spinach is a good treat. Just don't over-do any treats.<br>  <br>  Lettuce will not cause infertility, but does not have much nutritional value. It is full of water and will fill your rabbit up with very little nutritional quality... causing runs.|`|g6RoZrOsaa	Have you got a pets at home near you, they are very good, my rabbit loves the rabbit nuggets (if you get musali, they just pick out the tasty ones, and my rabbit loves cabbige and carrots, i dont think you dont need to bath them they wash them selves, and if you are going to keep it outside, put something around the waterbottle, or it will freeze or get warm, and my rabbit drinks alot. If you dont buy them toys to keep them entertsined vand to teeth on, they will bite the cage. Get a poop box, and even before you put it in they will do most of thier poop in 1 spot so put some sawdust into the poop box and that means less cleaning up lol.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped|`|Idunjsxjaa	Do not bathe your rabbit....they are very susceptible to hypothermia and can die.  They are very clean animals and your rabbit will keep itself clean.<br>  <br>  The web site below and many others are helpful on the dos and don'ts of rabbits.  This will tell you what veggies you can feed your rabbit.  Head lettuce is a no no.....it can cause diarrhea.  Romaine lettuce is good. An absolute must to feed your rabbit is pellet food and timothy hay.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&A=673&S=5" rel="nofollow">http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content...</a><br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is surf the internet and read read read everything and anything about rabbits.  This is what I did before and after getting my rabbit...you will learn so much!|`|1gbR22CRaa	Rabbits are self bathers, So you really shouldn't bathe them. They shouldn't be fed lettuce. There's no nutritional value in it and it causes diareh. Small amounts as a treat is best. They sell rabbit food at most grocery stores. And you can give him a little hay for ruffage.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Don't give him a bath-rabbits hate water except for drinking.<br>  You bought a rabbit without knowing what to feed it?!?!?<br>  Where did you buy it? Did you ask the store? Go back and ask them what else he was fed. It was probably some type of pellet/rabbit food. Its best to continue what he was being fed, since dramatic changes in diet can cause GI problems. And yes, Lettuce can give him the runs-its not good for rabbits.
UNFxjNHkaa	Anytime you get a new animal, you should keep the kitten separate for at least 2-3 weeks. Introduce them slowly - they're most likely all not going to get along at first. It is IMPORTANT that you keep the kitten in "neutral territory" ex- dont put the new kitty where the old ones often go. Keep him in a spare bedroom or something along those lines. Give them 'visiting times' - like for the first few days take the new cat out for 5 minutes around your other cats - the few days after that, take the new kitty out for 10 min at a time -- etc..  After the 2nd or 3rd week of doing this, let the kitten out of the room to run free because everyone will at least be a little more comfortable around eachother!<br>  <br>  They're going to hiss and swat at each other (this is normal). <br>  <br>  Good luck with your new family member!<br>  <br>  Oh!  And if you want to use the squirt bottle then go right ahead!  The squirt bottle has worked miracles for me with my cats|`|uqLUKbMbaa	Most of the answers here are excellent and there is nothing I could possibly add.  We do have a cat, or I should say, he has us.  The only thing is that a cat is very territorial.  Given time, the 'newcomer' will be accepted.  Patience will be required by you and the cats.  The day will come when all three will lie down together.  It will happen.  Full marks to your daughter for rescuing the little chap.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	they will get along eventually..<br>  they have to get to know each other..|`|Oq7CAayZaa	kittens are playful, can't do much but play with them constantly!!|`|hHAdA9V9aa	ATTACKING? Surely it's simply playing. Maybe distracting him and playing with a more interesting toy than the older cats would help him realise it's must more fun to play with owners and leave the old grumpies alone! =P<br>  <br>  Also, if he simply gets too excited place him in another room from the other two to calm down - eventually he will become calmer as he gets older.|`|K3BHPtnXaa	They will get used to the newcomer... =]<br>  But if staying with the old cats it is dangerous for the kitty, y<br>  ou own to find him a new warm house with food, water & a lot of love! <3 <3 <3|`|B1Y3IBkwaa	two options try the Squirt gun or get a kenel and put one in there but leave them so where they can see eacohter. Hope that helps. i to had the same problem and to tell you the truth the squirt gun helped.|`|4DonDdbvaa	The other cat thinks its got no territory and the fat one must get even more in the way. So maybe put the cat in another room to find its own territory.|`|1gbR22CRaa	Just give them time. They will have to work out the pecking order.|`|eo0DKI0qaa	keep the new one separated from the rest and little by little let them get used to it|`|2AOzkBPJaa	I've been having this problem with my kitties as well, we have a 12 yr old cat and she's almost always been the only cat in the house.  7 months ago i rescued two little kittens from a barn I was working at.  We took care to introduce them slowly to the older cat but she hated them.  She hasn't gotten any better, over the last 7 months, if she ends up getting too close to one of the kittens she's very aggressive.  For the most part though they've basically just kept out of each others way.  The one kitten has a fascination with the old cat, but she knows to give her just enough space.  They're probably never going to be friends but they can still be happy as long as all the kitties know they are equally loved, and as long as they have a place they can be alone sometimes.  I would suggest just giving the kitten lots of toys, maybe provide the older cat with a safe place it can escape from the kitten's games?   The spray bottle idea will probably work too.  Hopefully they'll one day be friends :)|`|ea25d9076fec2a98ef5108000f8e3290aa	You should let them kinda fight it out. If the kitten is just being playful and the other cats want him to leave them alone, they will let the kitten know they want to be left alone. Just make sure you discipline the older kitties if they decide to get too rough with him or if they deliberately attack him. You dont want any full-blown fights, but a few hisses and a few whaps wont hurt him<br>  <br>  But there will be some puffed up tails and probably a few battle scratches but eventually they will just have to tolerate eachother anyway. You cant just keep the kitten locked up in a different room forever!<br>  <br>  Just be sure when you leave the house you put the kitten in a different room until you can watch them. The kitten will eventually back off because he will know the other cats dont want to have anything to do with him. Get him some play toys and eventually you wont have to watch how they behave with eachother anymore!|`|Amkmles0aa	cats will be cats some times thay will eat cats|`|y1Fihj3Maa	Just give them time, the kitten just wants to play, and the older cats are annoyed by the little brat.  They will defend themselves, and let the kitten know when they have had enough.  I'd be willing to bet that in a few weeks, they will become friends.  Make sure to give attention to all cats so they know that your love for the kitten is not love taken away from the older ones.
1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	Yes you can. <br>   My friend took hers for a walk all the time.<br>  <br>  Buy a dog harness for him, attach a leash, and work on leash training. Before worrying about walking,just try tying himup so he get used to the pressure of the lead and fights with a pole instead of trying to drag you around.<br>  <br>  If he is younger, he may take to it quite quickly.<br>  <br>  A potbelly pig we had at the zoo I worked at would sit, shake, laydown, and walk on a lead.|`|knFrwCxcaa	Yes you can|`|dV3NjtTQaa	yes you can i had a micro pig which are very small to a pot belly pig but they are very sociably animals and love to get out and about also good exercise for them has he every been on a lead? if not get him use to this first as this will help when you take him out in the big world don't rush it as this will scare him do it slowly hope this helps|`|aXsq6N2Yaa	I have a pig named Bucket, he is a Potbelly and I trained him to walk on the leash with a harness. Warning though people will want to pet him and this may scare him, so ask them to approch slowly. They are smart and will tell you how they feel about a walk, don't forse them. Also bring some tasty treats like carrots to motivate them! Hope this helps!|`|1gbR22CRaa	They need to be exercised as much as possible and their very Intelligent. So yes, you can leash train them and walk them. The pavements also good for their hooves. They need a harness not a collar.
Amkmles0aa	take him to the vets to get his claws  filed down, and give him time|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, I am a cat behaviorist.  <br>  This is what I should do... when you say NO or STOP, say it on a stern loud voice, not yell, and stop your movement.  If he does Play or stay rumbustious in front of you, move him away from you stop looking at him, and any movement.  Make him know you are the boss.<br>  Change his daily meal time.  Like feed him before going to be, will make him sleep all night.  Make sure to have play time before bed time.  Play time set up wil lower is active energy.  Get a cat noodle at SPCA or at pet store, where he can chase the Birdie.  Get him to tired playing, will reduce the the energy. <br>  <br>  Go and get a nice long brush, like the one you use in the shower, so it is away from your hand in case he attack, and when does attack, once again say the word "NO".  When he is good, give him treats, and say good boy.  ( he probably have sensitive spots, he does not like you to touch, and might change as he GTE's older)  <br>  One last thing, he is neutered right?  A cat that is neutered lower his temperament.  Get the vet to check again...<br>  <br>  I got a great SPCA DVD for free if you need it.  I can sent it to you for free, and it have a part on Energy kitty.  On plants, go get bitter apple at the pet store.  Get the nails trim as often.<br>  <br>  Is there a SPCA close to your area?  Most SPCA have cat behaviorist to help you via email or telephone.|`|18167e6cb8bb213b37ad670e7870b7fdaa	I think when cats are kind of aggressive like this, they're usually  playing.  If he were really trying to hurt you he could give you deep puncture wounds, and claw you pretty seriously, not just a little. <br>  <br>  When you wave a toy in a cat's face?  That's provocative behavior. People do this kind of things with their cats all the time. They want to get a rise out of him. Well you got it.  <br>  <br>  There's another option.  If you talk softly to him, move slowly, treat him gently but firmly, you can calm him down.  It's just the opposite kind of stimulus is all.  <br>  <br>  He's still young.  This is his personality.  When he's older he'll be more mellow.  <br>  <br>  As for eating plants and generally being annoying, especially late at night?  This is kind of par for the course where cats are concerned.  If you're going to have a cat, there's a certain amount of stuff you can get him to adjust to, with patience. And there's a certain amount of stuff you're just going to have to put up with.  <br>  <br>  Again, it'll improve as he gets older.  Kittens and young cats are rambunctious.  Later on they get more dignified.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	i am sorry to say, if a vet can find nothing wrong, such as he is in pain, you should either give him to a feral cat group that will place him as a barn cat, or put him down.<br>  <br>  he was either abused, or he is feral and never adjusted to humans.<br>  <br>  im guessing he is in pain.<br>  <br>  if you really want to try to tame him, every time he attacks, say no, sternly. cats submit to larger cats in a pride, he will see you as the larger cat. but it takes time.<br>  <br>  damaging things in the house is usually a sign of boredom, give him boxes and bags to play in, let him in a cluttered room like an attic, they love to explore small spaces. build a tent with a blanket over the couch. they love small dark places. this will keep him amused.<br>  <br>  but, attacking you when yo when hold a toy on a stick, to the point you bleed, is not normal.|`|wq6lfHIBaa	You cant give him up, remember a cat lives for over 15 years, when you adopted him you basically promised him you would be there for him!!!! Although you cant tell that he loves you he does, he thanks you everyday for saving him!!!  He is still young and wants to play, and it seems like he just doesn't know when he is crossing the line.  Keep your stuff away from him so he cant get to it, remove your plants, and put your rug away for a few months.He will mellow out i promise and he will make a great cat...it takes time and effort.  You can give him a ball of foil to play with in the day and it will wear him out!!! and its fun to watch him!!!!  Good luck!!!|`|xfpJGBfwaa	He's probably being poisoned by the plants he's eating.  Get rid of them, or move them someplace he can't reach like a hanging planter. There are safe plants for cats, for example, Spider Plant, but they're quite few.  Look these up online, there are plenty of lists.<br>  <br>  Get his teeth checked out by a vet.  Many cats need to have their teeth cleaned regularly by a vet because of genetic tooth decay problems.  If you had a horrible toothache, and a burning mouth and digestive tract from poisonous plants, you'd be grumpy too.  <br>  <br>  Don't spray him anymore.  Just yell "ouch" and practice looking hurt if he scratches you.  The loud sound and the piteous look will help him understand that it hurts, and you aren't going to retaliate.  Don't get into a battle of wills with him.  You should play the part of loving parent.<br>  <br>  Don't get him declawed  until you're sure he's not misbehaving.  It can make him feel threatened and helpless and make him more violent, and even start to poo on the furniture in frustration.  (This has happened to me!)  If you do declaw, make sure it's the kind where they don't remove the claw, they just cut the tendon - the recovery time is less and therefore the misbehavior is less too.  But you'll have to trim his claws forevermore, or they'll grow into the pads and hurt him.  <br>  <br>  Finally, are there any sounds in the house that are "supersonic" like an ultrasonic humidifier, or an insect control device you plug into a wall?  Those can really annoy cats whose hearing is way better than ours.  <br>  <br>  I second the calls for taking him to a vet - and make sure there is an xray taken of him to spot any problems internally.  Cats that change behavior suddenly are often getting sick but they have no way to say, "It hurts here..." like we do.|`|Oq7CAayZaa	If you don't give him up or don't want to this is your own problem that you shouldn't tell anybody about because you have problems.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	take him to the vet to get his teeth sand down and claws removed|`|0742b3f870575abd3141e5f0a0eb40ffaa	I got my kitten to stop biting by refusing to pet her whenever she tried to bite me.  Keep in mind that a 10 month kitten is naturally going to bite things (e.g. your hand) out of curiosity.  Let her know your displeasure not by words but by intonation of your voice.  Cats don't communicate by "words" so much as they do in tones and gutterals and of course... hissing.<br>  <br>  Don't play with him too rough.  My sister's cats are holy hells because she has a tendency to abuse them.   Most importantly I would say that although negative reinforcement is definitely at times necessary, its the positive reinforcement that is most effective.<br>  <br>  Don't let him walk all over you, but remember to reward him for good behavior even though it seems few and far in between|`|6XqK04DCaa	Listen,<br>  <br>  If you love your cat you will not give up on him.<br>  <br>  He probably doesnt get enough exercise...<br>  <br>  Like being outside running and playing.<br>  <br>  he's using all his energy running around your house <br>  <br>  Always talk to your cat. This helps him realize you are a friend and they love to listen.<br>  <br>  Also to show love when you feed your cat pet him and talk sweet.<br>  <br>  I adopted a cat who was vicious at first but now he loves and trust me<br>  <br>  and understands that im trying to help.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you and your cat havnt bonded.<br>  <br>  Plus he is ten months <br>  <br>  Hes still young and has lots of play left in him.<br>  <br>  Buy him a kitty scratcher or play toys.<br>  <br>  Take him outside.<br>  <br>  Give him treats when he's good.<br>  <br>  Negative inforcement with cats do not work<br>  <br>  They only learn not to trust you if you get angry to fast or hitting or yelling. They dont understand.<br>  <br>  Pick a noise to use for him that he knows is you.<br>  <br>  I click my tongue when i want him to come near <br>  <br>  and when he does something bad i have one sound i use and he knows that means no. Something like eh eh something authorative but not threatening.<br>  <br>  Cats only respond to humans who they know love them.<br>  <br>  Try to make him feel loved maybe also try getting another cat for him to play with. They get lonely.|`|Uh6EV4wgaa	he is emotionaly unstable. you must lay down the boundries.<br>  whenever he bites you shout at him in a angry tone and pont your finger at him. <br>  you will feel bad after you have done this but DONT go apologiez to him staright afterwards.<br>  Play with him alot and trim his nails. get him de-wormed and groom him alot. whever he starts getting agressive shout at hims and pont your finger.  but dont stay angry at him for over an hour coz thenhe will be confused and matters will get worse.<br>  also dont give him away..this will ruin his life andmake him even more agresive|`|gjrbp1Aoaa	He's frustrated, probably because his life has been very confusing and stressful. <br>  <br>  First, try to look at the world from his perspective.  It has to be very scary and confusing and he doesn't know how to express his anxiety, so he acts out.  He needs to be reassured that he has a forever home now but he also needs to be taught that his inappropriate behaviors are not acceptable. It's not going to easy, but will be worthwhile. I would not assume that he's going to grow out of anything. If left unchecked he may just get worse.<br>  <br>  I think playing would help him burn off some of the excess energy and sharing the experience with you will help him trust that he's staying with you.  Get some interactive toys.  Feathers on a stick would be good but a shoelace is perfectly fine too. One of my kitties loves to play with his toys, but most of mine won't.  Figure out some games he enjoys and share that with him regularly. Make time to just pet him and talk to him too. If he acts out stop any positive reinforcement for a few minutes. When you correct him you shouldn't need to raise your voice, just tell him "no." At first that probably won't mean much, but he will learn to understand when you're serious and that you aren't angry, you're just being parental. <br>  <br>  The poor kitty has been through a lot and it may take a lot of work to over come that.  But it can be done and you will end up with such a wonderful companion!  Good luck!|`|hHAdA9V9aa	Giving him up will only make his problem worse in the long term so try convince them that he just needs more time. I would try establish ground rules with him as he has probably been allowed to do anything with his last owner.<br>  <br>  I would move anything he thinks are toys out of his way on to a shelf and disallow him to climb on furniture and window sills. I suggest removing your rug from your room on a night so he can't get to it (say in to the wardrobe depending on it's size or out in the hall) and buy him a scratching post - eventually he'll learn catnip is god and the rug isn't god as there's no catnip in there =P<br>  <br>  Good luck! Patience is the key with any animal.|`|ivOpNL8uaa	You should get him checked just in case. You could also get his nails cut so when he does scratch they don't hurt.Also you should try and calm him down, if he hisses at you he might be scared you will do something to him, so don't play with that certain toy with him again until he learns to calm down. leave him to his self for a bit so then he will understand that he is being punished and hopefully stop. hope this helps.|`|qN4z0WB7aa	he just wants to play with you. play with him ALOT. he will out grow it dont worry.|`|kNYDHZqAaa	I recommend this a lot on here, but that's because it's really helpful in solving a lot of behavioral/aggression problems - have you considered getting another cat? Biting and swatting and stalking is a way that cats play with one another, and a lot of the time they do these things in the way of play. It's really helpful to have another cat around so they can get this playful aggression out on one another, not on YOU! Aside from a little extra money for litter and food, it's not very hard to get a second cat. This has solved the problem of biting and pouncing for me and friends of mine who originally had only one cat.<br>  <br>  Barring that, if he's biting a lot, try to redirect his focus by throwing or danging a toy for him to play with. Give him catnip periodically, if your cat is responsive to catnip it will put him in a good mood! There are calming sprays you can spray in rooms to make him a little less on edge. He's only been there for 2 weeks and he's young, give him time and don't give up on him. <br>  <br>  Eating plants, playing with headphones and scratching rugs are (unfortunately) pretty normal cat behavior. There's not much you can do other than trying to place the plants in a place that's harder for him to get to, and hiding your headphones (mine will eat mine if I don't). With scratching, I just try to put scratching posts near things he likes to scratch, pick him up when he's scratching something he shouldn't and put him near the scratching post. I also give him treats when he uses his scratching post, because cats learn best from positive reinforcement, not from scolding. Good luck!<br>  <br>  ALSO! Contrary to a lot of the comments on here, do NOT take the kitty to the vet and get him declawed or have his teeth filed down. You can trim his nails so they aren't so sharp (here's some info: <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...</a> ), but declawing a cat is not very humane and can actually lead to more aggressive behavior because it makes cats feel insecure. If the scratching becomes unbearable, you can try Soft Paws/Soft Claws, which are temporary caps that go on the nail (and they look like nail polish!). They fall off from time to time and you simply replace them. I prefer not to use them, but it's definitely preferable to declawing.|`|yqbCoMyJaa	It sounds like he's trying to tell you something. If he's a young cat; they do that.<br>  <br>  But if he's older maybe he was worms that are bothering him or something.<br>  <br>  And it also sounds like he needs more attention. Pet him and play with him with a lazer pen or string, harmless play! If you play rough with him you're encouraging him to bite. My cat used to bite and scratch.<br>  <br>  When I was training my cat if he did something bad I'd yell at him in a stern voice and put him in the bathroom with the door shut; (WITHOUT talking to him! Ignore him) for 10 minutes then let him out. After a while he stopped because he didn't like the bathroom.
yvWI1u28aa	Yup, its fine to pick it up and touch it, but since its still scared, just sit by the cage/hutch and talk to it. it will get used to your voice and come out in a week or so. if you pick it up it could get stressed at first, so pick it up in a few days time once its settled down =)<br>  <a href="http://www.kornage.co.uk/how_to_hold_a_guinea_pig.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kornage.co.uk/how_to_hold_a_g...</a><br>  <br>  its scared because its a new home, its young, it doesnt know you and its alone. getting it a friend will help it settle down. Why not get an older piggie from a rescue? that way, the oldie will be tame, and ive found that has a good influence on yound piggies. they think ''ooh, wheres he going? going to see the human? i guess i could follow...'' as if they bond well, they will go wherever the other goes =)<br>  <br>  they do recognise their owner- the piggie that lives in my room only comes out to see me. not my mum, my friends or anyone else. that could just be because I sat with her when she was sick, and fed her her medicine etc. they say if you look after a sick animal, that animal forms a special bond with you. =)<br>  my other piggies are quite tame and come out for everyone, but only take food from my hand because they trust me enough. another of my lonesome piggies is dead timid, and has recently been coming out to take food through the mesh of her cage, and sits still when I put her food in. whenever someone else tries to feed her, she'll make a run for her bedroom!<br>  <br>  cleaning its cage needs to be done atleast once a week, preferably twice. I have moved a group of 3 piggies into a smaller cage in the garage for the winter, and these guys STINK after 2 days, so need to be cleaned out every day!! wheras my others can last about a week before getting unplesant. if you need to do it as regualary as every day, or every other day, its a good idea to buy bedding in bulk, such as from your local equestrian shop. you can buy bales or hay and a bedding such as bedmax (its a dust-extraced sawdust for horses with allergys, but the flakes are quite large, so get as small as flakes as possible, but it must be dust extracted.) alternatly, pets at home does sawdust and woodflakes in bulk, but these are ￡7, whereas from the horsey shop its only￡5. small difference, but it wont be in the long run! hay bales are roughly ￡3.<br>  <br>  it wont bite or attack. as a gerneral rule, piggies dont every bite! it will only scrath if your holding it awkwardly or if it wants to be put down, or if its just scared. its not deleiberatley scratching you, it just wants to be put down. persist, and it will learn that wiggling wont get it anywhere. it does take a long time (I have a nice collection of scars on my arm...!) but its worth it, and in a months time your piggie should be scrabble free. holding it in a cloth protects your wrists and hands and is more comfy for your piggie. =)<br>  <a href="http://www.aracnet.com/~seagull/Guineas/CavyCorner/bitingpigs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aracnet.com/~seagull/Guineas/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.guinealynx.info/handling.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.guinealynx.info/handling.html</a><br>  <br>  Basic care-<br>  <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/theguineagardenrescue/basicpiggiecare.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freewebs.com/theguineagardenr...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  goodluck!<br>  xx|`|3BzVOdzUaa	Guinea pigs are naturally scared.

Remember to support the belly and back legs and hold them close as you pick them up. <br>  After a few weeks or months they will get to know your voice and scent and will talk away to you and squeek for food and treats.<br>  They need the soiled bedding removed daily and a full clean out about 2 times a week,remove the bedding,  clean the cage with pet safe cleaner, and the replace the bedding.<br>  They can bite, either if you touch them and hurt them by accident, if they don't want to be messed with or sometimes they mistake your finger for a carrot.<br>  <br>  They are lovely animals you just need to spend more time with them than people think.|`|jpqL8BzEaa	What were you thinking ?!

Once you have the piggie in your lap, they usually enjoy being petted. Remember that they cannot "hold" themselves for very long, so you may want to put a towel across your lap first to prevent any "accidents".<br>  <br>  2. Guinea pigs are prey animals. It is their instinct to be naturally timid and skittish. Over time, your piggie will learn to trust you, but they almost never get over the instinct to jump and run when they think they're about to be "caught". They can't help it, so don't take offense and think your piggie doesn't like you.<br>  <br>  3. Your piggie will come to recognise you and your voice over time. They even learn their names and can do simple tricks.<br>  <br>  4. Hopefully you have a nice large cage for your new pet. Guinea pigs require a fair amount of space, usually much more than the pet store cages can offer. Please consider making your piggie a C&C cage. It will not need to be cleaned as often as a pet store cage, since the poop will be spread out over a larger area. High usage spots should be cleaned daily and the whole cage should be cleaned weekly. Scoop out the dirty bedding, wipe the interior with plain white vinegar, wipe again with a clean paper towel to remove the residue, and replace the bedding and piggie.<br>  <a href="http://www.guineapigcages.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guineapigcages.com/</a><br>  <br>  5. Guinea pigs do not attack and do not bite unless they are in pain or extremely afraid. They are defenseless prey animals and would rather run and hide. If your piggie scratches you, it is not intentional--the nails need to be clipped monthly.<br>  <a href="http://www.guinealynx.info/nails.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.guinealynx.info/nails.html</a><br>  <br>  Please also read up on diet and common illnesses:<br>  <a href="http://www.guinealynx.info/diet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.guinealynx.info/diet.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.guinealynx.info/normal.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.guinealynx.info/normal.html</a><br>  <br>  Please consider adopting your piggie a same sex buddy.

They vary but if handled gently from a you age it might relax a bit.<br>  Also they tend to be very motivated by food. We had one that was nervy but would become more sociable when he thought he might get food.<br>  You should really be able to tell when its cage needs a clean... the signs are obvious! But do it at least once a week.<br>  It might bite but it probably won't do you too much damage. You can always wear gardening gloves until you get to know each other. Scratching is less likely, and "attacking" is way too energetic for a guinea pig!<br>  NB - They do not do well in cold weather, in fact it can kill them; bring it indoors (garage, shed) when it gets cold.|`|fJ7OeopSaa	Yes you can pick it up/ touch it. They're very easy to look after really, feed them once a day make sure they have water. You can give them veggie peelings, apple cores, they love that stuff. They do recognise when you go to the cage for feeding and stuff. I would clean the cage once or twice a week, with a dust pan and brush into a liner. If the cage is dirty you can get cage cleaner spray. Guineapigs are lovely animals, they don't bite or scratch, they do get nervous easily so dont worry! enjoy your new pet!|`|eMlSCa5Xaa	Guinea Pigs Still need cared for and taken to the vets if their ill but not as much care as cats and dogs here is the basic information for caring for guinea pigs :<br>  <br>  guinea pigs are docilee creatures and can be picked up but only if its the right way to pick them up and you have to hold them gently and so their  is not a long of discomfort for them <br>  <br>  it will be scared the first few days as it will be settling into an new environmentt and it will take some time to get used to you <br>  <br>  sometimes yes they recognise  their owners but unlike cats and dogs they are unable to be trained and recognisee your actions.<br>  <br>  who have to clean its cage out about every 2 or 3 days to stop germs spreading and making the guinea pigs ill <br>  <br>  yes they will bite or scratch if they feel threatened like all animals they will scratch or bite if they feel they are in danger but they are generally nice animals to own<br>  <br>  hope this helps emma x|`|wsLngQ8oaa	I just got two and for the record they do better when they have a friend.

Animals aren't like clothes you know, you can't just go out and buy them!|`|BY0cV4kRaa	Go to your local library & get a book on caring for guinea pigs.|`|hHAdA9V9aa	I suggest the first ting you do over the weekend is go to the pet shop and get a book covering nutrition (guinea pigs need vitamin C suppliments in their water), socialisation and general care. <br>  <br>  You must pick and handle your Cavie as much as possible ESPECIALLY is he/she is the only one you have. They are group animals but I wouldn't suggest you get another as its hard to sex them and you may end up with fighting males or a pregnancy.<br>  <br>  He/she will be scared of you at first so just be present alot at the minute, I wouldn't handle him/her for a few days til they've settled and a good way to gain confidence is to feed them food (they especially like Celery).<br>  <br>  I believe they do! Mine used to come up to the cage when I gave a "wheet, wheet" noise.<br>  <br>  I personally would clean the cage atleast every other day if you've keeping them in the house (such as winter time). If not I would recommend every 3/4 days depending on the amount of mess they make. ALWAYS make sure they have plenty of straw/hay for bedding. This helps them stay warm and feel safe - I suggest you shred paper in a shredder for bedding. It's much cheaper than buying hay all the time but check daily to make sure they/she/he has enough; filled to the top if you must! <br>  <br>  Also you must change their water and food everyday. Imagine if you're parents kept feeding you yesterday and the day befores left overs...ewwww<br>  <br>  No, they don't scratch or bite if you handle them alot. Especially while they are young. The only time they will ever hurt anyone is if they feel threatened or hold them too tight. Actually, mine used to lick me xD<br>  <br>  Sorry, this is a long response but there's your crash course on Guinea care! Make sure you get a book, I've probably missed some details out. It may also be benificial to do a google search on Guinea care :)|`|7TKI0i4zaa	yes they will try and run away a couple times but yes you can pick them up and touch them<br>  <br>  they are naturally scared creatures since they are prey in the wild<br>  <br>  they do come to recognize the hand that feeds them daily they will squeak, popcorn, and stand on the cage:)<br>  <br>  everyday you are supposed to remove their soiled areas with new bedding<br>  and do a thorough cleaning once a week<br>  completely throw out bedding, clean the pan, and refill with new bedding,water,food,treats,fresh veggies etc.<br>  <br>  they are very friendly animals they will not bite they nip at my fingers which doesnt hurt at all they just sort of taste you...lol|`|HSMgd6Graa	pet it!|`|JpuYvXg9aa	WHY, Would any normal person take a living animal into their care, without comprehensively knowing how to care for it first.<br>  <br>  These things are not toys, and you seem to be treating this Guinea pig like one. <br>  <br>  Return it to where you brought it from, and ask them to keep it until you have researched HOW to care for it.|`|lNfv18Bsaa	Don't try to handle it too much when you first have it, it needs to get used to its' surroundings.<br>  <br>  It is probably scared because it's new and doesn't know where it is, it should be fine over time. Another reason could be that it is lonely as it is on its own, get another one the same age (and sex if you don't want to end up with loades of them) to keep it company.<br>  <br>  If you spend time with it, it'll get used to you are be more confident around you.<br>  <br>  You need to change the newspaper that's under the food every day. Once a week, take everything out then clean it with warm, soapy water, then with normal water to get rid of the bubbles. Put a bit of disinfectant in when you've finished.<br>  <br>  If you treat it well, I don't see any reason to want to bite, scratch or attack you.<br>  <br>  Also, it'll need bathing, I do mine every school holiday, use rodent shampoo that you can get from pet shops. It will have instructions on the bottle.
BMri9tITaa	Well, if each tank had a dead fish in it and no one was doing anything about it, I wouldn't go to that Wal-Mart.<br>  <br>  In general, you should go to local, smaller fish stores, especially if they're a specialist store.  They generally have higher quality livestock and better know-how.  I've had some luck recently with Petsmart, but I don't try to push my luck.  Petco is just awful.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Beginning_Fishkeeping" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Beginning...</a><br>  <br>  A tank that's about 10-20 gallons is best for a first-timer.  10 gallons are less expensive, but 20 gallons is easier to stock.  A 10 gallon aquarium is about $20, and stand is about $40 (at Petsmart).<br>  <br>  You will also need:<br>  <br>  -Properly sized filter<br>  -Heater (most available fish are tropical, so you'll have to heat the water.  A 50 watt or 100 watt will do fine)<br>  -Dechlorinator.  Water from the tap comes with chlorine in it, a toxin to fish.  Dechlorinator is a water conditioner that will remove it.<br>  -Gravel (either fake or substrate)<br>  -Plants and decoration (either fake or real, depending on the above)<br>  -Lights (which may come with your tank)<br>  -Hood (which may come with the lights)<br>  -Food (I like the kind that comes in granules rather than flakes, as it sinks and makes it easier for all fish to eat)<br>  -Airline tubing, to help remove water for water changes<br>  -5 gallon bucket, for water changes<br>  -Net, for collecting excess food and other debris<br>  <br>  Other, optional items:<br>  <br>  -Testing kit (a local fish store might provide testing services, so this might not be necessary)<br>  -Airstone (some argue that you need to this to add oxygen to your tank.  Most tanks don't have an oxygen problem)<br>  -Algae scraper<br>  -Driftwood (helps lower the pH of your aquarium)<br>  <br>  Make sure you have a location to put your aquarium before you buy it.  That space should be large enough to hold the aquarium, and also be away from a window or other source of sunlight, and away from any vents or fans, which may cause the temperature to fluctuate.<br>  <br>  Consistency is key in maintaining an aquarium.<br>  <br>  After buying your aquarium and setting up all the hardware, you need to go through your nitrogen cycle.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Nitrogen_cycle" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Nitrogen_...</a><br>  <br>  Stocking your tanks:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/10_Gallon" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/10_Gallon</a><br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Stocking_a_Peaceful_Community_Tank" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Stocking_...</a>|`|ss3ZU4KCaa	For a first time tank a five or ten gallon will give you enough room to get several fish along with being a little easier to take care of. I would go to a neighborhood pet store. PetSmart, Feeder's Supply, etc also do good with having everything in stock. I generally will buy the Tetra brand of fish food, which is flake food for the top feeders and shrimp pellets for the bottom feeders. I believe my cleaning system for the tank is Tetra as well. Sometimes the bigger pet stores will have kits for the fish tanks that include the pumps, lights, etc. I know WalMart had them in the past. For fish, guppies are very pretty, colorful, and pretty hardy. Gouramis are pretty, but you have to stick with other semi-aggressive fish. They tend to eat guppy tails if the tank is too small. Once you get a tank set up (it takes about a week for the water to get ready for fish) you can go to a pet store and see what fish catches your eye. If  you are having trouble figuring out what fish can live together, ask for help. Any pet store will be able to help you figure out what can easily live together.|`|aFslyRbMaa	guppys one of the most pretyest fish in the world they are easy to take care of so that is cool and they make babys|`|wnnudNp5aa	First thing you should do is go to a pet store, book store, or library, and get some books on aquarium keeping. Fish keeping isn't as simple as adding water and fish to a tank and there you go! Please do some research. It isn't difficult, if you learn what to do, but is a nightmare if you don't, and will always end with a tankful of dead fish.<br>  In general, the bigger the tank, the better. Most novices make the mistake of over-stocking a small tank. You will need a tank and stand, gravel, a heater, thermometer, filter, air pump, lighted hood for your tank, net, water test kit or dip strips, a gravel vacuum, and water conditioner. A background, plants and decorations are up to your taste and discretion. Most books on aquariums have pictures that might give you some ideas. Food will depend on the type of fish you have. Most tropicals will do well with tropical fish flakes. Most tropicals also love an occasional treat of freeze-dried tubifex worms.<br>  Some easy to keep fish are: Platies, Corydora catfish (prefer to be in groups of 3 or more), some of the Tetras, and Guppies. There are others, refer to a beginner's book for suggestions. Bettas are great fun, but you need to be careful what you house them with. They can't be kept with other Bettas, or with fish known to be fin-nippers, or with fish that have long, flowing tails or fins. They will think they are another Betta and attack them.<br>  Do not get Goldfish! They need 10 gallons of water per fish, and cannot be mixed with tropicals. They produce huge quantities of waste, and need more care than a typical community aquarium.<br>  Never buy fish at Wal-mart. If you have a neighborhood aquatic shop, that is your best bet. Those people will usually know all about the fish they carry, and can help you choose what will go with what, and what won't. If you don't have a neighborhood fish store, you can often get decent fish at Petsmart or Petco. You may not get the guidance and help you would at a local store, but at least they have a guarantee on their fish.<br>  Please, do plenty of reading and research before buying your tank. You will learn not to buy your fish when you buy your tank, for instance. A new tank has to be cycled first. Any beginner's book will explain how that is done. It can sound like a daunting task to set up a new aquarium. There are a number of steps to follow, but if you follow all of them, it can be great fun and very rewarding when you have a healthy, happy tank of fish in your home. Good luck!|`|e2be0a15c3672de325a1663ace314573aa	Try PetsMart or PEtco if they have them in your area.  And you know what are some fun pretty fishies that aren't very expensive?  Feeder goldfish!!  People use them to feed to bigger fish, but heck, they're pretty, easy to take care of, very hardy, and only cost about 30 cents a piece!  Seriously!  Most pet stores carry them.  Guppies are fun too and come in a wide variety of color|`|3Z7B0dcaaa	DONT DONT DONT buy fish at department stores.<br>  Petco and PetSmart are good,<br>  but personally, I think small local pet stores are best.<br>  <br>  And fish aren't THAT easy.<br>  I say start with a 5 gallon tank and get some zebras.<br>  Or a gold fish.<br>  There's tons of bautirul goldfish out there, <br>  and goldfish are very hardy fish.<br>  <br>  But if you get a goldfish, make sure he's small enough for the tannk.<br>  Don't be tempted to get a big fat pretty one unless you're planning on having a bigger tank and lots of filters.<br>  Goldfish are kinda messy in the want :/<br>  blegh.

2Ku4DuvCaa	I'm happy that you were able to stop him from plucking! If you stopped the plucking soon after he began, then the odds that he's destroyed the feathers permanently are fairly slim.<br>  <br>  I have dealt with pluckers from all walks of life and in many different species of parrot. From that, I know that even if you stop the plucking quickly, it will often times take between three and six months before the area is completely covered again. <br>  <br>  As for speeding it up, there's really nothing you can do. Diet wise, he should already be getting fruits and vegetables alongside pellets and a VERY small amount of seed. If you're doing that, then you don't have to worry about it. A good misting with warm water once or twice a week will be very good for him.<br>  <br>  Be sure that you watch the bare areas to make sure that at no time do they start to show signs of skin irritation or infection. Misting him him with the water can help prevent that. If at any time he reverts back to plucking suddenly or his skin seems irritated in the bald areas, it's time to take him to see an avian vet as there could be a deeper underlying problem worse than boredom.<br>  <br>  Beyond that, unless your parrot is very close to his molt already, give the bald areas between three and six months to be covered. <br>  <br>  Also- if you bought him toys to help with his boredom you should be advised that you can't rely on those toys to keep him entertained forever. In order to avoid him reverting back to plucking out of boredom again you need to supply him with a nice rotation of toys. Put some in his cage for a few months, then take some out and replace them. This will help keep him occupied and entertained. <br>  <br>  Beyond that, make sure he's getting a healthy diet, has a nice large cage, plenty of toys, and plenty of time outside of his cage to socialize with you. <br>  <br>  You should be just fine. ^_^|`|VdeV0jUqaa	If hes stopped plucking, thats great!<br>  It can be a serious problem- especially in the larger birds- Im glad you picked up on it quickly and were able to work with your bird to make him more happy in his environment.<br>  Sad fact is your birds feathers may never grow back- some birds that pluck stay bald for the rest of their lives- but if you jumped on the problem quickly, it might not be so bad.<br>  You might have to wait for the next molt (summer time) when your birds feathers should naturally start to fall out and be replaced by new ones to see if there is any change.<br>  Feeding fresh fruit and veg daily is definately recommended for any pet parrot- it will help to keep him healthy and happy if nothing else!|`|ybaeu04Baa	What did you do to help him?

OyNJTWaiaa	The male cuban attacked them...as males and as "invaders" in his territory.  Our cubans only tolerate others in the aviary because its so large and there is lots of hiding places. Our aviary is 30 feet by 10 ft by 8 ft high.  Space and set up may be key to this and also males being territorial.  We always quarantine birds away from the main group in seperate cages for at least 30 days...a good precaution once you have lost birds to introduced disease on birds who show no symptoms but are "carriers" .
zqVDJxUIaa	They work well in the pet store because they keep excessive amounts of each fish in there, therefore reducing aggression in each species. However, it should work fine in a normal home aquarium as well, but I'd carefully check each species after introducing them to make sure they are fine together, and if necessary, set up a small tank where any aggressive fish could be placed. THE ANSWER IS YES, but the fish might be a little aggressive to the angels, and nip at the fins, but if you introduce the angels first, it should be all OK.<br>  <br>  Blood Parrot Cichlid:<br>  An aquarium intended for blood parrot cichlids should be decorated with a soft bottom substrate. Use bogwood and rocks to create hiding places for the fish since they otherwise can be quite shy. They need a large aquarium due to their size, a parrot cichlid can grow to be 25cm/ 10 inches. They should not be kept in aquariums smaller than 200L / 50 gallon. Blood parrot cichlid requires good filtration since they can put a large strain on the water quality. Large weekly water changes are also required. A pH of 6.5-7.5 is to be preferred.<br>  <br>  They are suitable company for a large number of species such as Danios, Barbs, Cory cats, silver dollars and other South American cichlids. Do not keep them with convict cichlids since there is large risk for cross breeding.<br>  You can feed your parrot cichlids the same food you would give any other South American cichlid and they do well on pellets.<br>  <br>  Parrot fish that are found in the trade today are usually fertile and can be breed in aquarium without to muck trouble. Early Blood parrot cichlids males where infertile but this is usually no longer the case. They can be breed in the same way as other South American cichlids and usually spawn in a cave or under a rock/piece of bogwood. Blood parrot cichlids are not always the best parents and you might have to raise the fry separated from their parents but I recommend that you give the parents a chance or two to test their skills as parents before using this method. The fry can be feed newly hatched brine shrimp as soon as their yolk sack is consumed.<br>  I hope this helps!<br>  Good Luck, add happy fishkeeping!|`|Jis9ipcNaa	Gouramis and Angels yes, Blood Parrots ok with everything else except the kribs and firemouths. <br>  <br>  You say you already know how big they get but I have to wonder if you do. No offense but if you are really considering housing all these together you are going to need on enormous tank. <br>  <br>  Don't ever follow by the examples set by pet shops. I worked at one, and while I did out things together that should not be, pet store can get away with it. One, the fish are always young and not at their height of territoriality, two as often as nets go in and stress them out it changes their behavior as well. <br>  <br>  But honestly, that pet store did a bad job at choosing tank mates.<br>  <br>  It is damn near impossible to breed Parrots. They are a hybrid fish, and as such 99% of the time mules and unable to mate.|`|IFEIP5Doaa	I wouldnt suggest it. The bloods woudld do fine with the barbs, corys, silver $$ and kribs, but I wouldnt put it in with the angels and gouramis, they are pretty slow moving and the parrots maypick on them.<br>  <br>  And you will need a large tank for them, the angels and gourami, the parrots get about 6", angles about 9" and gouramis about 6".The angels can go in with the gouramis and balas (but remember balas,, barbs and silver $ are schoolers, buy them in groups). But the bala gets about 12" so you will be looking at a 75 gallon or larger to house them as adults. But angels being mildly aggressive as they mature will usually pick on other small fish when housed in tanks under 30 gallons. <br>  <br>  And gouramis, some are nice, others are mildy aggressive. The pearl leeries, moonlights, and snakeskins as far as larger gourami's go tend to be more mild mannored, golds, bludes, opalins and paradise tend to have bad attitudes, and kissers get around 12".|`|iVgtoyw8aa	probly i would think so
MKdR8MIUaa	Hi, My name is Tucker and I'm an Australian Shepherd.  I can remember eating some strange things as a puppy.  The website listed first below is a great resource for finding out if something is poisonous for a dog.

zRbYyh7haa	I was in a play called 'Happiest Days of our Lives' when my litter of 7 Labradors was born and I KC Registered/named them after the characters in the play.  Tassell the Tangram, Rainbow Rogue, Hopscotch Harper, Billings Bill and Coo, etc.  Their new owners called those Cleo, Henry, Haddy and Pip!  The boy I kept is named 'Butterscottish Boy' but we call him Louis... anyway, you could look in Roget's Thesaurus under 'weather' and 'jewel' and you will get a brilliant list of ideas to start with.  Good luck :-)|`|pM1Qw0hUaa	Tyson is a good name for a boy boxer!|`|t2M1kXY4aa	The AKC has the breeder's kennel name as part of the dog's registered name, and allows the breeder to specify a theme if he or she wishes, but the breeder leaves it up to the owner to choose the rest of the dog's name.  I'm not sure if that is a rule (perhaps the breeder IS permitted to give the complete registration name?  I feel like I should know that, but I don't!)<br>  <br>  Perhaps it's more commonly done in the UK?<br>  <br>  If you want to do a themed litter, it can be anything from a specific letter (all pups have names starting with the same letter) to a particular word (all pups have the same word in the name ... my dog's breeder specified the word "time") ... or something like you mentioned, gems, weather, anything you want your litter to be known as.<br>  <br>  Some ideas that might yield actual NAMES (rather than pet names) could be:<br>  <br>  Books/Authors<br>  Historical figures<br>  Singers<br>  Artists<br>  TV personalities<br>  <br>  I've also heard or read of litters with themes like:<br>  <br>  French perfumes (and they were Dobermans!  Weird!)<br>  Colors<br>  Varieties of pasta<br>  Other animals<br>  Sports cars<br>  Constellations<br>  <br>  I do like your idea of gemstones, but I'd think twice about using "weather" as a theme.  Weather events can be devastating, catastrophic, and deadly ... others may not appreciate the reference.|`|3giaPYe8aa	First off a pedigree is a family tree, not a registration certificate.  Secondly, what KC are you registering with?  In my whole life (and I'm not young)  I've NEVER heard of a registry that chooses the registered name....NEVER!  If you have a kennel prefix, put it on the papers and let the new owners choose the registered name, with your theme in mind, unless, you are going to register the whole litter in your name before the sale.  (Some people do, do that, but not many)<br>  <br>  Add: I'm in the US and have only dealt with AKC.  Yes, I bred Dobes for about 25 years (not any more) and have never heard of AKC choosing a registered name for my pups.  Yes, I did have a Kennel name, and that's what appeared on each and every one of my pups, but I did let people choose their own registered name.  Sometimes I had a theme, sometimes I didn't, sometimes I had a list for new owners to choose from, but not required. (as my kennel name was)<br>  <br>  Add:  Sombra, the breeder IS allowed to choose the full registered name, if they choose to.|`|qgeI6Chxaa	I think you should just put your kennel prefix (if you have one) on the form and let the new owners choose their own name. Don't assume that a buyer will want a puppy named Hurricane Henry or whatever. What's worse, some buyers might choose a puppy based on its name rather than evaluating whether it has the right temperament.<br>  <br>  edit: I'm not completely certain about the KC, but I do know that with the AKC there are two ways to register individual puppies (after the litter as a whole has been registered). One way is for the breeder to register each puppy and then transfer ownership to the buyer. In this case you would choose the name. Or you could sell the puppies with papers and let the buyers register the dog themselves. In this case you would not choose the name. You could suggest a theme to the buyers, but they wouldn't be obligated to follow it. No matter which option you choose, most buyers will probably change the puppy's call name anyway.
MBjgViCjaa	Yes. The cone shell, an aquatic gastropod (i.e. sea snail).<br>  <br>  Wikipedia has a relatively good article on them, listed in the sources I referenced.|`|DUjr9tNUaa	google it.|`|79157f79dd458394e932dcb98eeae0fbaa	Probably, but consideringi that sea slugs live on the ocean bed and travel about twice as fast as a snail, it'd have a hard time killing you unless you became a marine biologist, don't ya think? =)
O1VcREmJaa	One goldfish, fancy or not, should have 20 gallons. There would be no harm in adding another 20, however 10 is fine. The reason being both goldfish will still have access to enough space to grow and swim as long as you add that extra ten. It's hard to describe but that extra 10 will add extra swimming volume which is what it needs to be healthy. It's like if you move out on your own and then your friend does and you could each get your own apartment or you could just get an extra bedroom and share the rest as a mutual space. They both still have access to 20 gallons without feeling overcrowded which could stress them out and possibly kill them|`|Rfj2ULibaa	The rule is intended to provide optimum conditions for your fish.  Can you keep more fish in a smaller space, of course.  Will those fish reach their full potential in size/coloring/health - no.  <br>  <br>  A man can live in a jail cell for years - is it optimal living conditions - no.<br>  <br>  A year ago I started with those little inch long feeder gold fish in my pond, those fish are now between 6" and 10" long.  My little 3" -6" koi are over a foot.  Would they have grown that quickly if I had put them in an aquarium - no, but they'd probably still be alive.|`|BWez86Ldaa	No. You're reading this wrong. 20 gallons is fine for one fish. Each ADDITIONAL fish, need an ADDITIONAL 10 gallons, not just ten gallons. It's like saying that I can live in a house with only one bedroom (but with a livingroom, bathroom, kitchen, so on), and for each additional person we need an additional bedroom. Get it? It's not that one person can live in a house the size of a bedroom, but each additional person needs his/her own bedroom... <br>  <br>  I hope that made sense. lol|`|6JdZJRKyaa	i know what everyone said, but i had two comet goldfish in a 5.5 gallon tank filtered by a 15 gallon rated filter, and they lived VERY happily for 3 years (left an automatic feeder for them when i went on break at college and it didnt feed them and they died =[ ) So i mean i think it depends on the situation, i had some pretty hardy goldfish i must say|`|Jis9ipcNaa	This is really more of a math question than a fish question. What you are asking for is basically a formula to find out things like bio load and how each fish will effect it. It may not make a lot of sense if you don't know the math behind it, but it is a sound argument. I'd say to stick with it.|`|3Z7B0dcaaa	Pff, I've had my 3 gold fish for 5 YEARS NOW!<br>  They're in a 20 gallon.<br>  I've never heard this rule.<br>  I've got 2 big fancy ones that are about the size of my palm<br>  and a koi that's about 6 inches long.<br>  I have a regular filter on the top and a sponge filter.<br>  I've never had water problems and they've always eaten great.<br>  <br>  I don't know about this "rule" non sense.|`|aXsq6N2Yaa	That rule is so you will buy a bigger tank.

I used the rule I stated earlier, and the fish seemed happy. <br>  <br>  You can almost always stuff more fish into an existing tank if you do something to add more oxygen to the water. Things like adding more air pumps, using large airstones with the air pumps, etc..|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Your math is correct. But a single fancy goldfish does require twenty gallons, not fifteen. So we say 20 for the first, and ten for every one after.<br>  <br>  Courtney- Your fish are in atrocious conditions. A koi only growing 6 inches in five years? Fancy goldfish only the size of your palm? Your fish are stunted and not healthy at all. Do some proper research on your animals and you will be disgusted with yourself.|`|t0K6Haoyaa	no that rule is correct b/c goldfish grow as their tanks do. If you transfer him into a bigger tank, he will get bigger. That's why the rule is set in play. If I were you, I wouldn't add any other fish. You need to put him in a bigger tank so that he can grow.|`|NBfBKI1Uaa	It is because the formula is exponential function and direct function.<br>  <br>  The rule is such that because it is measuring volume or gallonage and not actually space.

IuYekkPVaa	If you're asking this question in the UK, you will not be able to find a breeder.  The GCCF does not recognise the Scottish Fold as a breed because they consider that the gene which produces the folded ears also causes skeletal abnormalities, producing stiffness of the limbs and tail which increases with age.

FXCNxzqiaa	First, your Dane is not finished with her cycle yet.  In fact, now is when she is most likely to get pregnant if a frisky male has his way with her.  She will start bleeding again soon.  A typical cycle is bleeding for 7-10 days, no bleeding and most receptive to a male for 7-10 days, then bleeding again for 7-10 days.  PLEASE spay her about 3 months after she is finished with her cycle.<br>  <br>  Definitely keep your vet appointment.  If she hasn't suffered any injuries, it is most likely growth issues.  It could be panosteitis, or pano.  The primary symptom of pano is shifting limb lameness.  I would be surprised if it was hip problems this early in her life, but I have no idea what her parents hips were like.|`|26PPwzrWaa	It could be growth issues. <br>  <br>  I would defintely keep the appointment with the vet though just to make sure. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bigdogsporch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigdogsporch.com</a> <br>  <br>  Your dane will continue to grow for another year, make sure you are feeding the right food for a giant breed.

rXMTdUg4aa	A great dane can weigh anywhere from 70 to over 100lbs. at a year old. Some are very muscular and that will add to their weight and others are more thin and "lanky" and will weigh less. If she looks thin feed her more. A great dane of that size... if very active... should eat anywhere from 3 to 5 cups in the Am and 3 to 5 in the Pm. ALSO, if you feel that she is to thin, collect a stool sample and have it tested for worms. Some of these parasitic worms can not only bloat some dogs tummies but others will make them thin. My advice is to keep in touch with your vet. Good luck:)|`|JITTMjasaa	110 to 200 lbs or that's what I read|`|vouUQQzBaa	You need to measure her from the withers down to find her height.<br>  How big her parents were should be taken in consideration.<br>  Weight/Height do go together<br>  Does she seem too slim to you?<br>  <br>  At one she's still growing though. However it all depends what's behind her as well(her pedigree. Were they small?)
dyb61F6Xaa	When an indoor-only cat escapes outside (or when any cat is displaced into an unfamiliar area), the cat is likely hiding (usually near the escape point) in fear. That is because cats are territorial and your cat's territory was inside of your home. Once a cat is transplanted into unfamiliar territory, it seeks shelter because it is afraid. Cats that are afraid (and cats that are injured) will seek areas of concealment such as under a deck, under a house, under a porch, or in heavy brush and they will not meow! Meowing would give up their location to a predator. Their behavior has nothing to do with whether the cat loves you, whether it recognizes your voice, or whether it can smell you--it has everything to do with the fact that a frightened cat will hide in silence! <br>  <br>  The method that Missing Pet Partnership has pioneered that has resulted in the recovery of many "missing" indoor-only cats is the same method used to capture feral cats--the use of a humane trap. We call this "trap-and-reunite" or "TAR". These wire cages are available for rental from your local shelter or veterinarian or for sale at hardware stores, pet stores, or on-line at www.animal-care.com.  Humane traps have a trip mechanism that when triggered by a cat, will shut the door and contain a cat inside.|`|Oq7CAayZaa	she will remember where she lives! cats aren't stupid like dogs!|`|DtkLsetkaa	Awwww you poor thing :(((  I hope very much that she comes back.

Can you put something outside that has her scent on it, like a blanket or her litter box, so that the smell will help guide her home.<br>  <br>  Make "lost cat" posters and deliver them to everyone in the village, asking people to check their homes, sheds, garages or any other outside buildings in case she has got locked in somewhere by accident.  Ask local shops, school and churches if they will display the poster for you.  Call local vet clinics or animal shelters in case someone has found her and taken her there. <br>  <br>  In the first week after I moved home last summer, our female cat went missing sometime during the night (she'd figured out how to open the door to the bedroom balcony).  I spent a frantic 24 hours searching everywhere for her, but she seemed to have vanished into thin air.  When I heard cats fighting in the early hours of the morning, I rushed outside in the hope it was her.  It wasn't, but I spotted her face at the window of a neighbour's home.  Even when I told them my cat was in their house they didn't believe me at first, so she'd obviously spent the whole time avoiding the neighbour and his cat.<br>  <br>  Sincerely hope that you find your cat safe and well very soon.
rrLHU6ehaa	No.  A jaguar is very aggressive and will undoubtedly kill the severum at least, and probably at least beat up the red devil, especially if the tank is too small.  The pacu is fast enough to escape ti if the tank is large (150 gallons or more).  The pacu is also not generally considered an aggressive fish, and is a different species/family altogether, so would not attempt to fight the others, although it may nip at their fins.|`|l0ktQUnWaa	You should be fine with that.

5QG9Zrjaaa	Once a bone or joint fuses, it no longer hurts. The hock is made up of several joints, if one of the joints fuses, the horse may have a mechanical change in range of motion, but it won't be painful.  While it was fusing, it was probably painful, but once the process is finished, no more pain.<br>  <br>  however,<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that with one of the joints of the hock fused, the other 2 have to move more than they were designed for in order to get the range of motion that he does have.  This can set him up for inflammation and further arthritis down the road.  It isn't necessarily a reason not to purchase the horse, but it may make a difference in your management of him.  Using joint supplements, either fed or injectable, good shoeing to take stress of the hock (shortened toe or more upright balance than usual) and attention to footing in his turnout and stall areas will need to be addressed throughout this horse's career.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	The hock is made up of several bones joined with each other.

I see this with a lot of beagles.  Even the ones that have never been in a pet store.  They are one of the harder breeds to potty train, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  The going when you come back inside, you have to understand your beagles point of view on that.  Outside is full of wonderful new smells, and beagles are all about the nose, so it's VERY distracting.  And when he comes in, well the other dog has gone on the floor so .. that must be the spot!!!<br>  <br>  How to change that - well, clean the house of any dog bathroom smells and start crating both the dogs.  Put them on a schedule making sure they both go out first thing in the morning, after naps, after eating ... and a few extra times a day.  Take them out on leash and prepare to camp out until they go.  If they don't go, bring them in and crate them for 5-10, then back out for another potty trip.  Repeat to the crate until they go outside.  If one goes, the other usually follows, which is nice.  After they've done their job, unleash and let them play a bit.  Play with them too!  They'll get it, potty means off-leash play time.  No potty means back to the crate.<br>  <br>  Yea, the beagle will be tough and will probably mess the crate a few times.  Just try to deal with that in stride.  With the other dog not doing that, he'll start learning by watching even if he misses the mark.  <br>  <br>  And ditch the bell.  Seriously, some dogs never make the entire connection between bell and potty.  They will make the connection between bell and outside, but some never make it to ring the bell when I gotta go.  Get the dogs on a shedule so they know when to expect you to let them out.  Their like little kids that way, many have to be reminded to go even after they know where to go, or they have accidents.|`|C5YBD3F1aa	All I can say is good luck...

It took me four months to house train one of our Bassets, but only two days for the other. It really just depends on each dog. Look into crate training, it might help her. Just don't turn her into a box dog.|`|GGbd1Bcgaa	I had a hard time house training my dogs. I had a nine month old and he would go all the time, just keep training her, get a smaller crate so she has just enough room to turn around that way when she go's she will be in her own pee, won't like it so she will stop peeing in her crate, she will learn to hold it so no more peeing or pooping in the house. Good luck.|`|ez75Yqvvaa	Tis sounds so much like my previous situation. You need to be very patient with her, after you feed her & give her water wait about 15 min. take her outside and stay with her outside until she does something, then give her a treat and praise her when she goes outside, with hounds it might take up to a week for her to catch on but i promise it will work, I've trained all of my dogs myself and found that this approach works better than anything else i have tried|`|7XQeTXl4aa	i think you should punish the dog in a way that they know what they did wrong. i would do this by taking them by the mess and make slap them and lock them in the kennel. this should be done to both. and when u do go out side give them time to settle down and do there business and when they do there business give them a treat and/or pet them. let them know they did a good thing. also nothing is done over night.   the main thing is to let them know they did wrong.
Bw18seFqaa	the proper way is to supervise your dog and take him outside before he needs to go.<br>  <br>  If you find a mess, but did not witness him do it, then clean it up.  Smacking and rubbing his nose in it does no good.  The dog doesnt make the connection that you are mad that he pottied in the house.. he thinks you are mad about the poop/pee being there, so he will poop/pee somewhere else next time, or may even eat it to hide it.<br>  <br>  You have to catch the dog in the act of messing in the house, and firmly tell him "NO" then take him outside and praise....   in a dog's mind then, you are telling him "NO, not there..   go here!"<br>  <br>  <br>  I dont believe in "disciplining" a dog..  CORRECTING is the proper way..  you have to tell him no, then show him the proper place.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	My dog is always with me, so I almost always knew when she had an accident.  I would take her to it and say" No no.  Go outside."  Then I would put her in her crate for about an hour or so, and take her out after that.  She is housetrained now!|`|kvHqnR5Haa	The books you are reading are correct.  The best way to get them trained is to praise them when they do it correctly, not punish them when they don't.  NEVER hit a dog - this will just cause aggression issues. And the books are correct when they say the dog has already forgotten by the time you find it.  If you catch them while they are doing it just give them a stern NO so they know they did something wrong and then take them directly outside so they learn the proper place to go.  Good luck!|`|A21SswSfaa	When a dog goes potty in the house the proper thing to do is to startle the dog then take the dog outside to finish up. If the dog does go outside then praise.<br>  <br>  If you don't catch the dog in the act then there's nothing you can do. The dog won't know what it's getting punished for. Rubbing a dog's nose in it is just disgusting and downright mean! Your dog won't understand and will be more likely to go potty out of your eyesight. <br>  <br>  Keep your dog in your eyesight 24/7, crate train, and praise like crazy when your dog does go outside! Feed him lots of treats. The more you praise a dog for doing something right the more the dog will try to do something right.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	I foster dogs, so I am always bringing home dogs who need to be housebroken.  I have never needed to hit a dog, or rub his nose in the mess.  (I remember my parents doing that when I was a kid, so maybe that is just an outdated method.)<br>  <br>  I use a combination of crate training (at night) consistency (in feeding and putting the dog outside) and discipline (telling the dog NO when I catch him in the act, and immediately putting him outside).<br>  <br>  I think its important to figure out where the dog is coming from -whether he is confused, marking territory etc., and explain what you want to him in a way he understands.<br>  <br>  I havent had a failure to date :o)
rLDf1gGGaa	Keeping a horse or pony is a very expensive venture, irrespective of whether you buy or loan. The initial cost of purchase will vary greatly, but the cost of keeping the horse or pony will require acontinual financial commitment.

Findingthe right horse or pony could take months, it isimportant that you do not rush out and fall in love withthe first horse or pony that you see.

It could cost your parents a small fortune. Even though the eat little it  still adds up. If you are boarding many places count a pony as a horse, so it is the same price for a pony as a horse. Don't expect a discount. Ever thought your not experienced enough to own a pony so that's why your parents won't get you one. Sure I'm 14 and have 2 ponies, but I had to prove up to my mom I could take care of them, so I got a job, I did get fired from that job but I did prove up. Also the only reason I have 2 ponies is I get charged nothing for board because the eat so little  and I do work in exchange for board and the second one, a shetland/arabian cross was given to be after I wanted to buy it so it wouldn't leave the farm. Horses and Ponies are a big commitment and will cost a small fortune to take care of.|`|PWankIUpaa	Jess <br>     I think you need to grow up a little more before you  get a horse .

No problem if you make sure to buy a fairly sensible one. The fact that you say 'partly' makes me think you shouldn't be looking for any old shetland, but one that's pretty well trained.<br>  <br>  On the parents stakes, we've all been there - keep the lessons up no matter what they decide and keep on learning everything there is to learn helping out at a yard, it's invaluable and will set you up well! :-)|`|B94Poxv4aa	I find Shetlands very mean and self willed, you sure you don't want Welsh?....|`|lZ0PDNctaa	where abouts in australia do you live?<br>  and i may be able to help you.<br>  <br>  please answer me that?<br>  <br>  thanks
AA11887983	NEVER feel bad about adopting a dog!  Instead of thinking of the ones you can't help, think of the ones you did help!  They are in a safe home, and they are loved.  If everyone can only do a little, that still gets plenty done.  And if you still want to help, there are more ways than to foster.  You can volunteer at adoption fairs, or you can become involved in educating people about pit bulls with your great kids!  <br>  <br>  I can't adopt or foster anything either, I have a house full.  But I find that I feel better if I do something just to help pets without homes, no matter what it is. <br>  <br>  Good job, and enjoy your new family members!|`|AA11457471	I hear you loud & clear!<br>  <br>  I did really well with whole litters but it seems that all the singles stayed!<br>  <br>  I gave up trying to foster at all but I've found lots of other ways to help.<br>  Clovicat has lots of great ideas, too.<br>  <br>  As a former kennel manager I can tell you that simply having someone come & walk the dogs & teach them basic manners is a HUGE help. Most times the shelter employees only have time to shuffle them around, feed & clean up after them.<br>  It's also a huge help to have someone willing to just do dishes & a few loads of laundry.|`|qUeNrusdaa	Guilty!?  You should feel great that you are able to provide a stable, loving home to those wonderful animals!  And as for bonding with them, I volunteer at an animal shelter and it's virtually impossible NOT to bond with wonderful, loving Pits.<br>  If you still want to help, volunteer at a local shelter for a couple hours on the weekend.  Or maybe lead some fund-raising efforts.  There's lots that you can do and all of it will be greatly appreciated!<br>  Good luck!!|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	Why should you feel bad about rescuing a dog that was sure to be put to death if you didnt??

Good luck!|`|44dYOvKeaa	I know it might be hard but I don't think you should feel guilty because the people who could have adopted the dogs might have mistreated the dogs but if you feel attached to the dog and you want to keep it dont worry about it|`|OFpl236faa	We ended up keeping a dog we fostered. He was in rescue for 7 months! We don't feel guilty because he has added so much to our lives. I have fostered a few dogs myself and even though they wouldn't have worked out for the long run, it was still very hard to say good bye and I cried every time. So now I make sure to give donations to the local shelter when I can to make sure they have enough supplies and I make sure to promote rescue as much as I can. It takes a very special person to foster. I put a lot of time and energy into the ones I did and you just have to trust you've done your best and you gave that dog a second chance. I'll probably foster again, but I don't think it'll ever be easy to say good bye. I always ask for updates too.
yIDHT8wcaa	it will all depend on your water conditions and wat they are eating heres some of my ideas.-<br>  <br>  *maybe turn the temp up or down(over a period of a few days not straight away) because this sometimes work with fish it triggers breeding sometimes<br>  <br>  *feed them high quality algae wafers and high quality catfish pellets because better feeding may also trigger breeding<br>  <br>  *add some live plants try to get broad leaved ones(amazon sword plants etc) because this will maybe a ideal breeing place for them(atm they may not have any ideal breeding places so are holding it off until they do?)<br>  <br>  *or maybe you just may have all same sex snails? give them a while longer and still no eggs get a few more so if your lucky you may get some of the opppisite sex<br>  <br>  good luck on your apple snails!!

If she doesn't look uncomfortable and upset, then leave it.  <br>  <br>  A call to the vet might be in order though.  <br>  <br>  Are you ready with a large, partially covered box with comfy towels that she can give birth in?

oMmBhWK4aa	Unless you really regularly do a dedicated job siphoning your gravel, one problem of vigorous gravel siphoning is the potential release of toxins that were previously accumulating over time under the gravel.  The hidden danger is with build up of toxic gases like hydrogen sulphide, just a bit released into the water can be potentially fatal for fish. Some people use Malaysian trumpet snails to help aerate the substrate since they burrow, but their population can get out of control.<br>  <br>  You also mentioned your filter conking out, which will seriously affect your beneficial bacteria colony that helps to remove toxic ammonia and nitrite. When a filter stops, after about 30 mins the bacteria will start to die without oxygenated water flowing through the filter and more die out until you are back to square one. Then your fish will soon feel the effects, eventually leading to fatalities. When your filter restarted, the bacteria population is already reduced and unable to cope with the existing bio-load produced by the fish, time is needed to replenish its population and in the interim the more sensitive fish may be suffering. Do have a backup filter and air pump in case your main filter really conks out. In an emergency, you can quickly transfer your filter media to the 2nd filter and also have ammonia neutralising solutions on hand.<br>  <br>  Edit: There really shouldn't be any need to switch off the filter except during filter maintenance. Are you using a filter that's too powerful for your tank? Unless you have big fish and heavy poopers, a filtration volume of 3-4 times your tank volume per hour is sufficient. Also see if you can redirect your outflow to avoid excessive agitation of the water surface. Depending on your filter type, some internal filters and hang on board (HOB) ones are able to vary the flow rate. If you are feeding flakes, you can get a floating feeding ring (anchored to the glass by a sucker) that prevents floating food from going all over the surface. Also try putting the food at the corner or side opposite from the filter.|`|TYohMrlXaa	Maybe the PH of the water you put in is different from the tank's PH. It may gradually change over time in the tank. <br>  <br>  I would get both samples tested, maybe you need a water conditioner that stabilizes or buffers the PH if that is your problem. Or it could just be something that you have in the tank, Shells and driftwood would change the PH over time.<br>  <br>  Cut down on feeding, try to make sure there's no leftovers. The siphoning should get most of the gunk, so maybe theirs just too much of it. <br>  <br>  You should start checking/rinsing the propeller, maybe once a month. If your filter would stop working for 4-5 hours, you've got a big problem. <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biologicalcycle/a/nitrogencycle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biolog...</a><br>  <br>  Edit: Gasses building up under the gravel is more likely to happen if the layer of rocks is very thick. You shouldn't have more than an inch and a half, unless you have live plants.|`|l0ktQUnWaa	You should be able to get most of the "yukky stuff" out of the water using your gravel vacuum. You may need to put a finger over the hose to slow down the vacuum. You can pick up a lot more gunk this way. Do you need to change the water that often? It would be better to let it go a little while longer. The main thing that bothers me is that your filter stopped. You do need to clean the impeller every time you service the filter. The filter did not just stop working all of a sudden. It would have slowed gradually. This allows anaerobic bacteria to overtake your aerobic bacteria, upsetting the balance. Anaerobic bacteria do not breath oxygen and this makes it harder to maintain the balance.<br>  Good luck!|`|IFEIP5Doaa	What is the temp of water that you are putting back into the tank? It really is better to do 10% water changes once a week, more than that is a bit much. I would try adding some salt into the tank, it calms the fish down and gives them a thicker slime coat. But a water change doesnt always help, have you had your water tested lately? Your pH may be changing rapidly right now as in different times of the year your water pH changes from the tap. I would look into that.

It works by applying the latest DNA science to analyse hundreds of snippets of your dog’s DNA where dog breed information is found. These snippets are then cross referenced against an extensive genetic database to provide a breed signature – or a series of breed signatures.  <br>   <br>  Breed Identification Made Easy <br>  <br>  Safe and painless, the non-invasive cheek swab test is easy to complete and can be done in the comfort of your home. Simply rub the supplied cotton swabs on the inside of your dog’s cheek, place it in the sleeve provided and put the sample in the mail and your BITSA results will be sent back to you.  <br>   <br>  BITSA Benefits<br>  <br>  <br>   Identifies the breeds that make up your dog <br>  <br>   Offers insight into behaviour and personality <br>  <br>   Uncovers potential health issues <br>  <br>   Applies a simple, safe and non-invasive sampling method <br>  <br>   Gives you the assurance of knowing who your dog really is <br>  <br>   Enables you to form an even closer bond with your loved pet|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	Does it really matter, though?

JnCOQ2uDaa	What I would do in this situation would to put the leash on your puppy then get out a toy. Distract her with the toy. When she looks at the toy and or stops chewing on the leash, give her a treat. When you take your puppy out for bathroom time, but her on a leash to try to get her used to the feeling of a leash.<br>  <br>  Distraction would be the easiest thing I could think of. Eventually she will learn not to chew on it. It's just that its right in their face, and they're puppies so they think, HEY! a new toy!<br>  <br>  Use it often and give treats for when she stops chewing on it. Good luck :)|`|FsS7MfFyaa	Put some treats in your pocket and make sure she knows they are there.  As you walk, praise her for her good walking and give her a treat.  if she is bad, no praise and no treat.  She'll get the idea soon enough ;)

Not all laundry soaps contain these - But wisk does.  <br>  The enzymes will "eat" the bacteria in the urine to remove both the stain and odor.  If you use another laundry soap, the stain may come out, but your cat will still be able to smell the pee - even if you can't - and pee there again.<br>  You might need to pre-soak it before washing if it's really bad.  You can add oxyclean to the water to soak it.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	if you wash it immediately it will probably come out - but im not making any promises!

I think some cats just have funny quirks!|`|5RRMLzvzaa	Post above me is correct - cats just have an instinct to bury food (and poop).  To save for later.  Some cats have a stronger instinct to do it than others - one of my three cats will scratch the carpet after eating, and sometimes if he finds paper on the floor he actually does cover the food ;)  All my cats will sometimes scratch the floor after pooping, too - even if they're not actually doing anything, it's almost as if the mere motion of pawing satisfies their instinct even if nothing actually got burried.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	She is marking her territory. Cats have scent glands along the tail, on each side of their head, on their lips, base of their tail, chin, near their sex organs, and between their front paws. When they scratch any surface, their scent is deposited there so other animals know who "owns" it.|`|e2be0a15c3672de325a1663ace314573aa	I know this will sound silly but she's trying to cover up the smell, kinda like when she goes potty and covers up her smell.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  Your kitten is just at the age when he is sexually maturing, with his hormones beginning to influence his behavior. While cats can become anxious and actually feel separation anxiety when not getting enough attention, cats do not spray or urinate on things to "get attention" or to punish their owners. It is an urban legend that cats are vindictive. This is just not true. It is their way of communicating that something is wrong, if it is medical or emotional.<br>  <br>  It may be that your cat is beginning to get ready to "spray" and mark his territory. Your scent is strong on your bed, and he may be claiming you.. and your space.  This being said, when a cat all of a sudden begins to pee in inappropriate places, there may be an underlying medical condition, such as a bladder infection or bladder stone which is irritating him.<br>  <br>  You really do need to take your kitten to the vet for a proper diagnosis and treatment. If there is no medical condition causing this behavior, then you can assume that it is he is maturing sexually and needs to be neutered ASAP. In fact no matter what is causing the problem neutering is most important. Trust me, you do not want to live with an intact male cat in your home. If you think you have a problem now.. <grin>.....<br>  <br>  You will also have to thoroughly clean your bedding and mattress to elminate any trace of scent so that he will not be attracted to the area to re-mark it. There are some excellent products available at pet stores and online that are enzymatic cleaners. Do NOT use any ammonia based product as that has a very similar odor to urine.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and I do hope your kitty is ok. Once he is neutered he is far less likely to spray or to mark your home. He also will be less aggressive as he matures, and will be far less anxious to roam.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member Cat Writer's Association|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	using your bed as a toilet, in absence of a medical problem, means he is mad at you. cats are vindictive.<br>  <br>  he should have been neutered a month ago, you will also have peeing to mark territory problems.<br>  if he smells a woman outside, look out.<br>  <br>  vet first, check for medical issue and discuss neutering, clean bed with bleach or rubbing alcohol to hide his scent, put a heavy quilt on bed when you are not in it, flip mattress, mak sure litter box is clean and accessible, if all that fails, you will have to find out why he is mad at you.<br>  <br>  jealous of the xbox would be a good guess.<br>  <br>  if you forgot to feed him or change his litter box because you were on the xbox, he will pee on the bed to get even.|`|LzXZQBHbaa	How often do  you change his cat box?<br>  <br>  Edit...<br>  anyways...white vinegar works well to get out the smell of cat urine.

Most commonly it is because you have been away for too long and they think you are lost.

He's only 12 weeks old and doesn't have a lot of experience.<br>  <br>  But, that obsessive behavior concerns me more than if you have ghosts or not.  He's way young and will need to learn to turn his focus on you when you tell him everything is ok.  Next time he starts obsessing like that in the house, get up with him and go where he's looking.  Go find out what's got his attention and teach him it's no big deal.

They also stare at the T.V. when it is on, anything that moves, etc. My littlest dog once stood there growling when he was young and we were on vacation. At first we thought he was staring off, but then we realized that he was looking at a pile of rocks. Sure enough, he had seen a fox behind them, and immediately we hooked him up on a stronger leash as he protested trying to get at it. My point is, dogs sometimes feel threatened by the details of their environment. So whether it was a critter running around, a new arrangement of furniture, or a new bird squwacking it up in the backyard, I wouldn't be too worried about it.<br>  <br>  Enjoy the puppies!<br>  <br>  Anna|`|a8Pq2Lmdaa	He could be growling at something as simple as a shadow.

I wouldn't rest on bloodwork alone.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	Are you assuming bone cancer or is the vet?Cancer is a horrid disease and unfortunately when it happens in older dogs most vets usually advise having the cat put down if it is a cancer that is not going to give the cat any Quality of life.If it is actually bones cancer and the vet should be able to tell with either a biopsy or even x-rays than this is not a death sentence depending how far it is spread and what can be done besides chemo which l personally would not recommend.If l was in your place and they do find it is really bone cancer and not guessing then go for a 2nd opinion to make sure and you can take all the tests you have had with you they belong to you not the vet.Re sites if you google Cancer in dogs,any solutions?you will get  plenty of answers.if you really want you can go to any vet site which will explain in medical terminology what need to be done etc and unless your greek and latin is crash hot you will not understand it Your cat has had a super life and you obviously care deeply for him and want the best and while he has no ill effects and is eating then relax and take it as it comes/|`|Uh6EV4wgaa	sounds like you taking good care of him!!!!<br>  keep that up and he'll last very long<br>  but there will be a time when    his problem will get very serious and  i think its best to send him to heven when that time comes|`|BgwYdqwuaa	My friend had a cat that lived to be 20 with bone cancer in her mouth
aeonmRR2aa	Sounds like your fish (a betta?) is too pampered :)<br>  <br>  Possibly, it is partially blind so it has trouble finding food unless it can navigate by something large like your hand - either by the shadows, or even by feel.  You might try a feeding clip or ring depending on the type of food, instead of letting the food drift around randomly.<br>  <br>  Now, I don't want to seem insulting, but some people like to keep bettas in things the size of coffee cups which will result in unhappy, unhealthy fish.  So I need to ask...<br>  <br>  Do you change the water enough?  Are the water conditions good?  Take a water sample to your local fish store and ask them to test the pH, nitrate, nitrite, and ammonia levels (and ideally copper and hardness).  Also, are you using dechlorinated water?  Is there a bubbler or filter?  How big is the tank?  Are there any sharp objects?  Etc.<br>  <br>  Dangerous levels of toxic chemicals in the water could cause a fish to go blind (or just about any other bad thing).  They could also, at a lower level, interfere with smell so that a fish can't locate food by scent.  Even bettas deserve a minimum of a 2.5 gallon tank with a filter (or at least gravel and a bubbler), and a weekly partial water change of 20-30%, or perhaps 30-40% biweekly if the water is unfiltered.  Of course, the bigger the tank, the better.<br>  <br>  If the water conditions are fine, then hopefully you fish is just lazy and loves your attention.  In that case, just keep feeding her by hand, and feel appreciated!  Some of gouramis and related fish are very friendly and like to be touched by people's hands (particularly on their bellies).  Supposedly, that's bad for their slime layer...  but I've never heard of gourami-petting causing any problems.

GdBG4PGYaa	Hello!<br>  <br>  You really can't choose kittens personalities, unless they are purebred. If they are purebred you will have a better idea of what they will turn out to be, but really all cats are different. If you get a mixed breed (Domestic Short/Medium/Long Hair) then you cannot pick a breed. You have to go to the animal shelter and pick one!<br>  <br>  Never buy an unhealthy kitten, and always ask the breeder a lot of questions about it and their facility. If they can't answer those questions, don't buy from them. They are most likely a backyard breeder in it for the money.<br>  <br>  I would recommend you look at this site. It has the personalities of certain breeds, and the background on the breed (not really important):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/catselector.do" rel="nofollow">http://animal.discovery.com/breedselecto...</a><br>  <br>  Make sure your children understand how to handle the cat/kitten and take care of it. If this is their responsibility it shouldn't be. You need to help. Especially since one of them is 3. Never leave the cat alone with the baby, if the cat has claws (please keep it's claws, because you would also be taking their bone out) then you need to make sure it doesn't hurt your child.<br>  <br>  There is a thing called Soft Paws that you can put on your kittens nails so it can't hurt anything. While your cat is a kitten (if you are getting a kitten) touch it's paws a lot, but don't use your hands as play.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope I helped! Good luck and congratulations on the new cat!<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. Ragdoll is a good first-timer breed. They are known to be calm, yet playful. They do have long hair though (most of the time).  Maine Coon's have long hair and are playful yet calm too. :)|`|tWtH1CCjaa	I would get a calico ragdoll or a silver tabby short-hair. They don't shed a lot, but they are shy around people but they are playful. It will take around 2-3 weeks to get used to you.|`|TYyZwOtlaa	A rescue kitten that derserves the loving home it needs!Lets face it, all kittens are beautiful and nice.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Go to the animal shelter and pick one out.

Kittens can be neutered quite young, just talk to your vet. White cats or short haired Tabby or Siamese are also nice breeds and some people like Black cats.|`|AQsiugSpaa	Hi Angela,<br>  <br>  Black Moon Cat's answer is right on the money! Actually, it is not too much to ask for a beautiful, intelligent and nice kitty all rolled into one ball of fluff. It does depend on whether you are willing to take a chance on an "unpredictable appearance and dispostion/ in a domestic shorthair/longhair, or if you are more of the mind to get a kitten which will have all of the qualities you request in a more predictable ball of fluff.  If so,  it would be wise to seek a reputable, professional breeder ( registered and<br>  recommended) of the type of cat you want.<br>  <br>  I am not "downing" domestics. I have shared my heart and home with some amazingly beautiful and smart mixed breed cats, and I love all of them, but there is a little more mystery about how they develop.<br>  <br>  So what I suggest is that you do a little research about the various breeds, and which cat would fit better into your lifestyle. While longhairs are gorgeous, they generally require more grooming attention than some of the shorthair breeds. If you want an active kitty, then you might not be happy with a Scottish Fold, which is adorable, but is considered by many in the cat fancy to be "furry doorstops".<br>  <br>  Visit Petside's cat breed descriptions and characteristics at <br>  <a href="http://www.petside.com/breeds/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petside.com/breeds/</a> <br>  click on cats.<br>  <br>  Now I know that I am a bit  over the top about my two Oriental Shorthair neuters. Both nine years old, they are highly intelligent, beautiful ( of course) and incredibly affectionate. They talk a lot though<g> . One of them enjoys riding on my shoulder wherever I go in my house, and the other one prefers to snuggle under the covers and purr his little heart out on a chilly night.<br>  <br>  Why not visit a Cat Fanciers Association cat show, in your area and talk with breeders. They will be more than happy to discuss all aspects of their breeds and make suggestions. They may even be able to recommend a reputable breeder in the area to which you are moving.<br>  <a href="http://www.cfa.org/exhibitors/show-schedule.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfa.org/exhibitors/show-sched...</a><br>  You can also read more about the different breeds on their website at<br>  <a href="http://www.cfainc.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfainc.org/</a><br>  <br>  So, of course I highly recommend the Oriental Shorthair or the Siamese as they completely fit the bill for that purrfect kitty for which you are searching.<br>  <br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member: Cat Writer's Association
3giaPYe8aa	It's called Coccidia.  Just keep treating for the 10 days.  Take the pup back after that for another stool check.  The pup may have to have another round of Albon.

They are very intelligant and can learn tricks and thier names however this also means they need LARGE cages and at least one other rat to keep them company. A suitable cage would be about ￡80.<br>  <br>  Rats should not bite ever, unless it is an accident. Rats are relatively easy to train, for guidance follow the website at bottom. But when you buy a rat avoid pet shops at all costs. The rats are bred from mills and are almost always more likely to die younger and be agressive (bite). <br>  <br>  Rats also need to spend a long time out of their cage each day. About an hour is enough. This could be while you watch T.V. etc. but it is important as they get bored and depressed wtih just staying in their cage.<br>  <br>  For alot more good information visit <a href="http://www.fancy-rats.co.uk/information/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fancy-rats.co.uk/information/</a><br>  <br>  EDIT- also DO NOT KEEP THEM ON WOOD BASED BEDDING it can cause them to get respiritory problems. <br>  Contrary to an above post, a glass aquirium is not sufficient.

Maybe let the dog see the rat and if it goes crazy then you'll know to keep the dog away from the rat.|`|FzKcPEOyaa	I have had 2 rats, one of which is still alive, Rats live about 3 years. 3 years is good for a rat. My cage cost me between ￡50-70 I believe that is around 150$. They are easy to train, you can teach them things, they can also learn their names, they are very very gentel creatures. They have only bit me once each, BUT it was MY fault. I tried to take its food away for a moment so I could check it(and a rat bite hurts haha). Apart from that they are lovely. Get only two males OR two females. Never get one male and one female unless you want to breed them. They are fairly cheap. If I remember they cost me like 20quid(40bucks). Food is also cheap too, though they will eat other things apart from plain "rat food", they will eat bread and dried spaghetti and peas and things however there are "forbidden foods" which are harmful to them and you should check up on that if you do decide to buy them. Citrus fruits are one of them but there are more. I have a cat and a dog but they are kept out of my room most of the time. You should get 2 rather than 1 rat. They need company and unless you are going to give 1 rat CONSTANT attention, then get 2. The room you will keep them in MUST have a tidy floor. Kept free of anything dangerous(electric cables) and also any valuables. They WILL eat ANYTHING. I have gnaw marks on my skirting boards and the bottoms of my doors. You will need to also need to change your rats cage once to twice a week. They will start to smell and it is not a nice smell at all. I would also highly recommend getting a wire cage and not a glass one. Glass cages tend to have poor air circulation. PHEW!

They really dont cost that musch once you have the cage and rats. They dont eat much. They dont bite unless they really have to but so will any animal if you scare it. erm the rat would be ok with the dog I have a dog and a rat(well two) and they are ok but i keep them seperate. oh and if you do get rats they really like the hamocks. And recycled paper as bedding.<br>  <br>  hope you get some. : )|`|PCXb1DKqaa	rats are great pets! i have 2 females(both 9 months old).<br>  mine have never bitten anyone. we bought a cage with 4 square foot floorspace and a second level and they seem happy with it. they do need atleast an hour out of the cage each day (females are generally more playfull where-as males like to just fall asleep:P). they dont smell aslong as their cage is kept clean. don't use pine or cedar or any kind of wood shavings they are prone to repistory infections (which one of mine has already had), use carefresh products or recycled paper turned into paper pulp. mine were increadibly easy to train i was able to teach mine how to come when they're called and for them to go to the bathroom in one corner of their cage. maintaining them isnt to pricey for me, my guinea pigs and my rabbit were wayy more expensive. the only problem i had with mine are they have a bit of a chewing habit(they chewed out the corner of the couch. but i trained them out of it)and 'marking their territory'(training in progress). but if you are interested in getting rats please,please,please get two. they are highly social animals and will become depressed if they arent socialy stimulated enough. i've heard of depressed rats ripping out their own fur (from rat care pages). rats are great pets, they're curious,inquisitve, and lots of fun!|`|VXv1CdYSaa	rats make great pets, i have 2 males both 6 months old. the cage i bought for them cost me ￡40, the 2 rats were 2 for ￡12, food dish was ￡1.99, water bottle ￡2.99 (but its one for a rabbit), bag of food costs ￡1.79, hammock ￡4.99, cat litter for the bottom of the cage ￡2.99, toys anything from ￡2.99 to ￡8.99 (these are parrot toys). only one of my rats bites, but that is very rarely. if i put my hand into his cage like a fist, then he wont bite me. the love eating fresh fruit and veg, and you can train them to learn their names, but mine havent done that.|`|tI9po66vaa	you should get a mouse|`|JG4P8wGXaa	get a cat in the hat...<br>  ...or a grizzly bear<br>  maybe a dingo named Skat<br>  with some nice frizzly hair.|`|38c8378f14c2daffd8e6feabbb7b27abaa	Rats make great pets. you have to choose them carefully, because some do bite. I had some that did, and most that didn't. some of mine learned their names. The question about the dog, is it depends on the dog. My dog loved my rats, and my one rat loved my dog. The rest really did not care either way. They do require that you spend a good amount of time with them daily as they will become depressed if lonely. There food is not that expensive, and you can add in stuff like Cherio's, stuff without sugar in it, and fresh fruits and veggies. Mine even liked roman noodles. (that was bad for them though) You need to keep their cage clean, otherwise they can get upper res. problems. All in all this sounds like a lot, but no more than any other pet would take.  Cages vary in price depending on where you live, or you can make one. We made ours out of 1/8" wire mesh, and plywood/ 1" wood slats. It held up pretty well, housing at one time 8 females on top and 7 males on bottom. If you get males, be careful to get them at the same time from the same cage, otherwise they will fight. Females are not as bad and can be bought at different times. .Don't use newspaper for bedding, it does not absorb well, and it discolors them. Use regular bedding from a pet store, no cedar though, can cause problems.|`|AA12303734	Get rats they are great fun if you let them loose in the dinning room of your local restaurant|`|WsxINw8paa	I agree with everyone else, rats are amazing. they're very loveable, clean, cute, and listen. they're kinda like little dogs, to me. but, if you get a rat, try your bestttt to get two, please. rats are very, veryy social animals. and if you only get one, it willl be depressed. and depression in a rat will actually shorten it's life spand. but, 2 rats isn't any harder then taking care of one. and that way, you don't have to worry about your rattie being depressed. even if you had one, and spent EVERY minute with it, it still needs another rat. and you won'tt regret it. mine run on desks, with a cage on it. I trained them to go in litter boxes, so the desks stay clean. they come to they're name when I call them. they lovvvve cuddling, love giving kisses, will do tricks if you train them, just be easy on them. and whenever I come back from going out, they just on me and kiss me. they really are like little dogs, as long as you treat them like one. spend alot, alot of time with them. and make ure they know you love them, and you'll love you back :] they're pretty easy to train, seeing as how they're actually smarter then cats, and some dogs. if you get a cage it MUST be big. like a glass tank, you use for fish. you can find a cheap one somewhere. they're very cheap to buy, none I have ever known bit anyone, and dogs would probably eat them. but trust me, no matter how much money you spend on them, and time you put with them. it WILL be worth it, I promise. :]<br>  <br>  <br>  little things you might want to know;;<br>  they can have human food. just not alot. about half a tablespoon. they can have any grain cereal, crackers without salt, potatoes [baked or flakes] peas, corn, cucumber, lettice, any fruit or vegies, just NO oranges or nuts. it causes tumors in rats. and when giving them human food, just make sure it's a small portion, and only every now and then. like twice a day? it's just too cute seeing them eat the kind of food I do :]<br>  when cleaning the cage, never use soap. just water and a rag.<br>  you shouldn't put them in grass outside, they could get bugs from out there that will never go away and could kill them. but most love when yu take them out and put them on a chair, table, or on your lap.<br>  that's about it. sorry it that was too long.
c07C7D0laa	don'y try to take care of it yourself go to a vet. Superglue can be taken off everyday objects with nailpolish but that could poison your cat! Take him to the vet. I hope he gets it off.|`|FtBHXQvHaa	No don't anything more your cat ,take your cat to the vet immediately|`|zpwJR60baa	You nee to have the VET take care of the problem.  Whad you do can harm the cat.. WD-40 is toxic.  You could try nail polish remover, but a call to a VET should help!  They do give free consultation, or call your local animal shelter. |`|x7duxnBLaa	This is something the vet needs to look at and right away.  Do not try to do this on your own.  You could hurt your cat's mouth.

X7alYOA6aa	INFORMACIóN ADICIONAL<br>  <br>   <br>  1.<br>  <br>  Primeramente, el hámster es separado de su madre y hermanos de camada a muy temprana edad, aproximadamente cuando cumple los 20 ó 25 días de vida. Normalmente es metido en una jaula de transporte con otras crías de su misma edad, que serán destinadas al comercio. Aquí ya suelen empezar los problemas de inseguridad. Luego son llevados a una tienda de mascotas y metidos en peceras o jaulas con otros hámsters (hembras y machos) de otras camadas y edades.<br>  <br>  Esta forma en la que suelen mantener las tiendas a los hámsters y otros roedores, no es la adecuada porque ya están en edad de reproducirse y algunas pueden quedar pre?adas. También se producen peleas por el territorio, la comida, una hembra, o entre una hembra y un macho porque el macho intenta aparearse. Cuando se adquiere el hámster, éste ya está bastante asustado por el estrés del transporte y la permanencia en la tienda.<br>  <br>  Al llegar a su nuevo hogar, el hámster se siente en un terreno hostil en el que no reconoce olores ni sonidos familiares, y esto le asusta aún más. Por eso es muy importante dejarle un par de días para que se habitúe a su nueva jaula y que vaya examinando los olores y sonidos de la vivienda.<br>  <br>  Se debe tener preparada su jaula con todos sus accesorios, abundante comida y agua. Si al meterlo en la jaula empieza a olisquear todos los rincones y a comer, será se?al de que es un hamstercillo confiado y será fácil que se adapte a nosotros, si por el contrario se mete en la casita-dormitorio asustado, quizá haya que tener un poco más de paciencia.<br>  <br>  Hay que colocar la jaula en un lugar tranquilo, sin corrientes de aire y procurar no intentar cogerle. Tampoco es recomendable hacer movimientos bruscos cerca de él, ni hablar con voz muy alta. Dirigirse a él con voz suave y calmada (aunque no salga de la casita) para que aprenda como suena nuestra voz y sepa reconocerla como algo familiar.<br>  <br>  Habrá pasado una semana, y ya que son pocos los hámsteres que se dejen coger sin problemas en ese tiempo, para sacarlo de la jaula sin que nos muerda y/o se asuste, podemos utilizar un bote de plástico o cristal. Metemos comida en el bote y lo dejamos tumbado en el lecho de la jaula. El hámster no tardará en entrar a investigar; entonces podremos sacar el bote con el hámster dentro sin ningún problema.<br>  <br>  Lo más importante es no precipitarse, tener paciencia y actuar con mucho cari?o, ya que él sabrá recompensarnos|`|gHWt7axCaa	La probabilidad es igual que en los humanos, si esta en su dia fertil es probable que si este embarazada. asi sea la primera o la ultima vez que se aparean.|`|UMQ46WTlaa	Pues es relativo pero por lo general la hembra Sí quedará pre?ada tras su primera cópula (? Porqué depende ?, porque si no ovula obviamente no quedará pre?ada, de lo contrario si y en los jerbos el celo en la hembra es claro indicio que posee óvulos listos para ser fertilizados).<br>  <br>  Notarás la pre?ez de la hembra entre 2 a 2 semanas y media tras aparearse (Se nota por un claro abultamiento del vientre, se vuelven más nerviosas y tienen una conducta tal como acarreo excesivo de material para su nido), no se nota uno días después.|`|LEvJLcsFaa	seguro que esta embarazada.<br>  <br>  Lo que pasa es que las mujeres tambien se pueden quedar a la primera vez que mantienen relaciones......

If you got over it a couple of hours THEN I'd worry.<br>  <br>  "Engaged with an accident"?  Is that a nice way of saying "run over by a car"?  I'm sure whatever "accident" this was happened outdoors.  So to relieve your depression keep the other two indoors so they, too, don't end up "engaged with an accident", aka, killed.|`|6eqJSffkaa	I am so very sorry to hear your news.<br>  <br>  When my cat died I felt like I'd lost my other half and it took a long while to recover and I still think of her even though I have many others. <br>  <br>  The grieving process is a natural part of loss and with time you will feel better.  So be extra nice to yourself.<br>  <br>  I am reading a book on survival after death and the proof for it is overwhelming, including the survival of our pets.<br>  <br>  I contacted an animal psychic when my cat died and had some pretty amazing feedback.  One thing that makes me look forward to dying is to meet my animal friends again.  It is said that wherever a love connection has been made that the connection can never be broken.<br>   <br>  There is a lovely woman called Pea Horsley who is an animal communicator, who you can contact if you want to communicate with your cat on the other side.<br>  <br>  Love to you and your cat who is somewhere nearby, even though you cannot see into the dimension in which he lives, happy and pain free now.|`|c2b0c54ac5bc43be413eb1675d56c4ffaa	I'm so sorry.  I understand your pain.  Just know that he is happy and pain free in Heaven.  He is jumping and playing and you will see him again someday.  :)|`|gmVX2nZnaa	I'm sorry for you loss. I remember when my first cat ever, died 3 years ago from kidney failure. Even worse because I had to watch him die. Simply crying it out helps for me.|`|53DwedRzaa	Animals are like people you never really get over them.  They grow on you like they are your own kids.  I have lots many of animals over the years and it has been hard.  But you have to stay strong especially if you have children that the where attached to the animal that just died.  Keep your chin up.  You will eventually get over the feeling of the cat not being around.  You just have to take it one day at a time.  I had 8 cats at one time and as they had gotten older several have already past on and I was always turning to the man upstairs to help me deal with the separation of the affection that I always recieved.  Animals tend to give you more affection than humans do that is why we stay so attached to them.  They always listen and never tak back when we really need a friend.  Animals are an amazing creature.  Stay strong you will get through it.  God bless and have a wonderful day.|`|R5mtKE5Zaa	Sympathies for your loss.  When my cat died I found comfort with the Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement.

Try and spend lots of time with your other cats to take your mind off things!
dJs2s9pfaa	Wow great research that you've done on ich. I raise my temp to 85-90 F, add 1tbsp per 5 gallons of salt PER DAY. If that doesn't work after 7 days then I give them Quick Cure. It's the best! Usually 10 days is all it takes. Do it for the whole 10 days otherwise if there are any free swimmers then you'll have to do it all over again. <br>  <br>  In the future, it's best to go on craigslist and get yourself a quarantine tank. I actually use a 10 gallon bucket that I got from the dollar store for quarantining. It's too late to quarantine now but when you get new fish it is well worth quarantining them for 14 days to prevent outbreaks to your main tanks. <br>  <br>  One thing that you didn't mention that I recommend, 50% water change before you administer meds. Do 25% weekly water changes after they are cured. That is the best way to maintain your tanks.  Visit these helpful links, they've saved many of my fishes lives: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/disease/ich.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/disease/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cichlidforum.com/articles/ich.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.cichlidforum.com/articles/ich...</a>|`|t0K6Haoyaa	call petco. Someone will be able to really help you.|`|NwZ6yrq7aa	I'm dealing with ick right now.  Tanks at roughly 76 degrees F and the ick's life cycle has been about 5 days.  I used Quick cure for 2 weeks; 1 drop per gallon, water changes every day(5-10 gallons in a 55 gallon tank).  on day 4 of treatment do a 25% water change and continue Quick cure.  It seems to have worked.  I also used salt.  Lost 1 fish but I think it was due to bacterial stuff after ick.  Good Luck!<br>  ~Sarah J|`|wnnudNp5aa	I've never used QuickCure. If it's for Ich, it should do the job. If it doesn't, try Coppersafe, and a Maracyn product, such as Maracyn-two, for secondary bacterial infections. I'm worried about putting salt in with your otto cats. Most cats cannot tolerate salt very well.<br>  Let this be a lesson. Use separate equipment for your tanks, or at least sterilize the equipment before going from tank to tank. A small hospital or quarantine tank is useful for new arrivals. Keep them in the quarantine tank for two weeks after you bring them home, just in case they have something like this, then you'll only have one sick fish, not 3 tanks full!|`|xGUmdy3Waa	i highly recommend ick guard.  ick guard is a very strong medication, every ingredient made in there is all anti-ick.  ick guard healed my goldfish from ich in 3 days.  try getting a big bucket and soak your aquarium tools in a mild MILD bleach solution for 15 minutes, after 15 minutes, rinse them under warm water, let it air dry for 3 days, rinse agqain thoroughly under warm water again and they should be as good as new, no more diseases on them.<br>  <br>  go ahead people, thumb me down, bleach is safe to disinfect diseases in a tank or tank items, i've done it and my fish is just fine.  just use regular clorox bleach.  that way, your tanks wont spread diseases that good, it wont have a high chance.  so yea, just try out ick guard and things should work out just fine =)|`|pFnvAquHaa	your best bet is to surf the internet and do research.<br>  or go to your local library and check out a book or two on fish diseases.<br>  DO NOT call pet-co or any other pet store for that matter.<br>  It's hard to find someone in a pet store who is knowledgeable about this kind of stuff.<br>  trust me i know.<br>  it's really hard to cure guppies of ich after it reaches a certain stage.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	so far youve done everything right good job just make sure you have removed all carbon from the tank witch I'm sure you have conitue to add salt <br>  <br>  18 years experience with fish
672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	no.<br>  <br>  if you have more than one... you will need a bigger tank that gives them enough room as they can be aggressive.<br>  <br>  Most fish owners with sharks have a minimum of 55 gallon tanks.<br>  <br>  15 gallons is good for a small group of community fish like fancy tail guppies, mollies, x-ray belly tetras, cardinals... so on.<br>  <br>  Community fish generally get to be about 1 to 2", they're colorful, and can usually get along with eachother so you can have more than one type of fish in the tank.|`|qEp9fxU9aa	There is only 1 true fresh water shark in the world and it gets about 12' so the answer is no.  There are a lot of fish that marketing people have wrongly put the name shark in their "pet store" name to help increase sales though these are not sharks.  The Red Tailed Shark is a loach.  The Irradescent Shark is a Catfish.  I believe the Bala Shark is in the barb family though I'm not positive about this.

Rfj2ULibaa	If your live where your pond freezes over in the winter you don't need a heater - you need a de-icer - a way to keep a hole in the ice so that the gas exchange can continue (check out a website like Dr's Foster & Smith).  If your pond isn't frozen over now, and I assume this other person lives in your area - there is no reason why you can't put his fish in your pond as long as you acclimate them to the temp by floating the bag you bring them home in for 15 - 20 minutes.  Enjoy your pond!|`|a47cAPypaa	The fact you have no fish in your pond at the moment means that you could put the other guys fish into your new pond.<br>  If you had your own fish already in the pond then you would have run the risk infecting your fish.<br>  I would suggest the best time to introduce fish into your pond is when the water temperature reaches 10c or above.|`|t0K6Haoyaa	yes you can, but what you need to do is put the fish in a bag with water and air sealed. put it in your pond to let the water aquemate to the desired temperature so that you don't shock the fish when you let him out of the water.

BWez86Ldaa	About four weeks. These little ones will need to have open eyes, be eating whole foods, and drinking water on their own. Once that happens, they should be good to go. Hamsters sometimes eat their young, it's normal, actually. She might be eating them because she is stressed or feels threatened (are there any other adult hammys with her, if so remove them). She could be eating them because they are deformed or weak. Animals sense this much better than we do, so they kind of decide to take the babies out of their misery and kill them.  It's common and I would not remove any babies from the mother yet. Good luck!!|`|fGwZMglGaa	About 3-4 weeks when they are eating and fending for themselves and not relying on the mother.<br>  I have done a lot of research because my hamster is also expecting babies :)|`|fBYInMlNaa	About 27 days.  She is eating them because she is stressed (from people always looking in the cage, etc.) or she doesn't have resources (food, room, bedding, water) to care for them.|`|IYd6bw7Gaa	Mercy killing.  She is killing those that are weak or unhealthy so they dont suffer.  Its sad and a terrible thing to understand but to her she is doing the right thing.  Unfortunately you cant take them away from her until atleast 4 weeks.  I typically wait til 6 weeks.  Once they reach a week or so in age they are pretty much going to survive.  If she is going to kill them its typically sooner.

wF52XMxAaa	Birds not only have more types of color receptors than we do (most have four to our three), they also have special colored oil droplet filters in their cones, which further sharpen their color discrimination.  They see colors better than we do.  Since TV is based on a 3 pigment human system, many colors on TV probably look wrong to birds.  That doesn't keep them from watching and comprehending the images, but probably makes them enjoy it less.  There's a good article at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_vision" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_vision</a><br>  <br>  We have one amazon who, when young, used to watch a cooking show on TV and beg food from the chef ("Hello?  I love you!").  But the chef never paid any attention to her, and she decided TV was useless.  She still responds to exceptionally interesting noises or images, but she knows it's all fake.<br>  <br>  If the chef HAD fed her, we wouldn't be able to pry her away from the TV while cooking shows were on. :)|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Birds have more peripheral vision than we do - they can see almost everything except the back of their heads.  They see far more colors than we do and they have sharper vision.

AA11155563	As a former pet shop owner I was required to take details of all psitticine birds sold ie anything with a hooked beak  (budgies, parrots, lovebirds cockatiels).<br>  This served 2 purposes 1) that if we sold a bird that had psitticosis (which can be dangerous to humans) we could trace the owner so that they could get treatment if needed and 2) If a customer bought something that later died we could find out when it was bought and refund them if it was still under guarantee.<br>  I used to guarantee all birds and animals for 14 days and by taking names and addresses we could check when they were purchased we did this with all animals purely for our records|`|wyAtVqbOaa	Didn't know you had to and can't see that they are able to.  Why don't you ask them when you purchase your animal.  They may say it's for their records but to be honest, I think it will be for marketing information and sending you junk mail.  <br>  <br>  If they won't sell you an animal unless you give them your information, give them a false address, say "Father Christmas Lane, Lapland" but if they do insist on getting your correct address, insist on going elsewhere for the pet.|`|dBi35JDkaa	Well that's weird!

Trading Standards can ask to see their records of pet sales at any time and they are meant to be sent off yearly to the same.<br>  <br>  It's supposed to highlight abuses in animal welfare and act as an aid in tracking the original purchase of an animal found dead or neglected and it would show multiple purchases by the same person. For instance you were buying hamsters in bulk to feed a snake live prey.<br>  <br>  The reality is very few pet shops do it and Trading Standards don't enforce it because the information is useless. You don't have to prove your identity unless they ask for proof of age and they want to sell pets so that doesn't happen very often.|`|w0ZqjJBtaa	They tend to do this if your are selling them an animal.

Possibly she becomes bored or lonely. <br>  <br>  Also, what breed of dog is she? We own three Staffies and we've heard some interesting stories...one of a Staffy even chewing though a breeze block wall.<br>  <br>  Always make sure she has durable toys too if she's a strong jawed dog. I recommend Kong toys and Nylabones. They are expensive but they do last for years; the internet is probably a cheper place to buy then the vet or pet shop. Never leave a dog unsupervised with a raw hide chew if you give her these as they do break apart and dogs sometimes don't chew like they should  - in fact, try avoid these as they don't digest very well in the intestines.<br>  <br>  If she does chew never smack her, simply send her to her bed and ignore her - dogs hate it. If she gets out tell her simple "In!" until you allow her to come out, don't even look at her til then, and make friends again when she's allowed out - they normally beat you to this stage =P<br>  <br>  Remove anythign in her reach that could be chewed, especially if shes a puppy and if you see her chewing anything she shouldn't be remove it from her and a stern no and point of th finger to go with then give her something she is allowed to chew.<br>  <br>  Also, have you given her one of your old shoes or slippers?

A dog needs at least 2 hours of exercise a day and if that isn't allowed then the dog will find other ways to release energy.  Chewing actually is a form of exercise, so is digging and scratching.  So, if you give your dog a walk in the morning and/or in the evening you might see a change.  Most dogs have a hard time staying inside all day long everyday.  If exercise isn't the problem then I suggest buying some "pet calm" which is made out of naturally calming oils....like lavender, chamomile and other stuff that is okay for them.  You can find it usually at a pet store....I use it on my dog and just put a couple drops on a dog bone in the morning after he comes inside from going the bathroom....that way by the time I leave for work he is ready to be calmed for the day.  I hope this helps....|`|rsTLGYaZaa	If your dog is a puppy she is probably teething.

I think they are exceptionally important for children to have. The children will soon realize that with using a gentle manner the animal will teach them love, loyalty, friendship and compassion. I find children who have had animals and have felt the love and joy they bring to your life, have a better understanding and respect for life in general. I think it's the best way to teach children the value of a life. It teaches them that animals can feel pain and have feeling much like our own.<br>  <br>   Unfortunately animals don't get to choose the family they live with.

A cuddly cat, a loving dog: Some people are so attached to their pets you'd think they were part of the family. Well, as any pet owner will tell you, they are! But unlike relationships with human family members, which can sometimes be difficult and a source of stress, owning a pet can significantly improve overall health and reduce risk of disease. "The benefits of pet ownership are real -- physically, mentally and psychosocially," confirms Dr. Daniel Joffe, a Calgary veterinarian who specializes in companion animals.<br>  <br>  Dr. Joffe points out that pet therapy or what is known in medical circles as "Animal Assisted Therapy" (AAT) has been shown in dozens of studies to reduce loneliness and improve health in many different kinds of patients.<br>  <br>  THE BENEFITS OF PET THERAPY<br>  <br>  Research into animal assisted therapy (AAT) has revealed that pets and patients are a health-boosting combination. Dr. Joffe's review of the medical literature, including the Journal of Gerontology Medical Sciences, Nursing Clinics of North America, the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, the Journal of Preventive and Social Medicine, Holistic Nursing Practice, and the American Journal of Alzheimer's Disease & Other Dementias, has revealed that pet therapy has the following benefits:<br>  <br>  -- It can increase social interaction among patients in a long-stay psychiatric population.<br>  <br>  -- In a nursing home or residential care center, even patients who are usually withdrawn like to pat, talk to and even walk a pet. This not only gets them out and about and talking to other people, it also provides opportunities for physical and recreational therapy.<br>  <br>  -- Companion animals are good company for orthopedic patients who may not be very mobile as a result of a broken limb or a back problem, for instance.<br>  <br>  -- When patients with dementia are given AAT, they become less agitated and more interested in social interaction.<br>  <br>  -- In patients with HIV/AIDS, AAT can help prevent or combat loneliness and depression and increase feelings of happiness. AAT with a cat can complement supportive relationships with family and friends.<br>  <br>  Here is another good site> <a href="http://stress.about.com/od/lowstresslifestyle/a/petsandstress.htm" rel="nofollow">http://stress.about.com/od/lowstresslife...</a>|`|6a46fb8529e04b76c29ac10ec9b400beaa	I fell that pets are good for many reasons. <br>  1. They teach a child responsbility and how to love and care for something.<br>  2. Animals are good for your health Mentaly and Phisaicly.(When you take them out for a walk you are staying in shape also. Also they cheer people up. And many other reasons also) <br>  3. They keep you company<br>  But caring for a pet takes time and responsobility. It is not a easy task to have. Even pets get lonly so that's why i think it is good if you are getting a pet if you spend time at home. Don't just stay at home al the time. But i don't think it is good to leave for weeks or days with them by themselves. Anyways i hope i have been of some help!

But I'd check with someone who works with wildlife in order to find out if you can legally own a wolf or hybrid in Nevada. Other then that you may want be careful if you adopt a hybrid some hybrids are more gentle then others but check with someone who works with wildlife if you want better advice.
Tdzmzu4haa	last summer i put a add in the local pet shop (pets at home) that sells horse stuff and in local tack shop saying how long id been riding (5years since i was 9) saying about the pony club badges i had ect and basically saying i was willing to help look after people horses and a woman called me, i now help her with hers in exchange with really cheap livery on my 2 ponies and mare and son to be foal which i own half with the woman who owns the field. before i put the add up my parents said i could never have my own pony!!! putting that bit of paper up was the best thing i ever did!!!<br>  <br>  so my answer is you try that as well, you never know!!!<br>  <br>  good luck|`|bVLwH4jlaa	Ask at your local horse shelter and / or RSPCA.

6yoCcGBWaa	Because they have an infection that can spread to the rest of the herd, if not treated.  And lots of them can wipe out a farmer's entire stock. which is very costly, when you are dependent on selling healthy animals for slaughter.<br>  <br>  I know it seems counter intuitive to cure a cow, just so it can live a few more months before you kill it.|`|VTee51r9aa	There are 3 major reasons:<br>  1. To treat sick animals. <br>  2. Prevent disease among animals susceptible to infections. This use<br>  affects a larger number of animals, because it usually involves<br>  treating a whole herd or flock.<br>  3.Promote the growth of cattle, poultry and swine when they are fed low doses for long periods. As a growth-promoter, antibiotics in feed help animals gain weight more efficiently by controlling the bacteria that can interfere with their ability to absorb nutrients. Animals become<br>  healthier, grow faster and stronger, and fewer die from disease
AA11457471	Yep, sounds like  an upper respiratory infection (cold) is getting passed around.<br>  They're usually caused by a virus &, if that's the case, antibiotics won't help.<br>  As long as they act like they're feeling fine I'd give it a week or so. <br>  If you don't see major improvement by then or if they start acting like they're not feeling well a trip to the vet is in order.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	my cat does that..<br>  they are ok|`|2AOzkBPJaa	They sound like they need to see a veterinarian.  I don't know any house cats that have ever gotten colds, but I've seen barn cats/strays that are sick like this, and often they die from it.  Very sad, they deserve proper vet care, just like humans need a doctor sometimes.  I'm sure its probably quite treatable though if you take them in to the vet.  Are they up to date on vaccines etc?  Id be pretty wary about handling sick cats, esp. if they aren't vaccinated wormed etc.  Just be really hygenic about it and get them to the vet:)<br>  <br>  Is it just normal sleep in their eyes? or worse? all animals get a bit of sleep in their eyes but if its worse, it needs to be looked after.  It could be conjungivitis, which can and does quickly lead to blindness.  It's very common, esp in cats that go outside as it could be from anything as simple as dirt irritating the eye.  Conjungivitis is easy to treat but it also could be a sign of something worse.|`|Oq7CAayZaa	My cat does all those things all the time and she has junk in her eyes once in a while.

Let me just note that if they don't eat it a bit after they shed it, then it will go bad, causing germs and harmful Diatomah.

If you would remove this try removing try with gloves or a plastic bag to prevent the Diatomah from harming to you.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	Leave it in, if the original owner doesn't eat it first the other two will.

YpEswTQdaa	Hello.<br>  <br>  This is called 'Sticky Bottom Syndrome'. Although it sounds serious,its not if cleaned up well. Its not actually 'diarrhea' caked on her bottom,its 'Caecotropes' the pellets/feces produced by themselves since not all vitamins are absorbed in the first digestion. It sounds disgusting but is vital for the rabbit to survive. If over fed Dry mix/pellets,greens/fruits or unnecessary treats the rabbit may over produce caecotropes which it doesn't eat. This should be cleaned up PRONTO,to prevent the risk of 'Fly Strike' where flies lay their eggs into a rabbits soiled bottom,resulting in the lava burrowing deep into the rabbits flesh,once they have hatched. The lava release toxins when they burrow,proving fatal to the poor rabbit, if left.<br>  <br>  You WILL need to bathe her,use a bucket have about 3-4 inches of 'LUKEWARM' water in it,not hot nor cold. Use a gentle human shampoo or one designed for rabbits(which i would personally use). Place the rabbit in the bucket with water & hold it still,let it rest up against the side(if it wants) to help soften the soiled mass. Once softened you can start to carefully remove(with gloves) the mass. Ty & get as much off as you can. After accomplishing what you can,now use the shampoo,just to help keep it smelling cleaner. My very first rabbit(a Cashmere/long haired) got this,as i over fed greens i did what i have said above & then CAREFULLY(Two people needed) cut the remaining hard clumps off. Its the only way really! Just try & makes sure your rabbit doesn't kick too much since this is what can damage its spine. Its quite stressful for a rabbit,but this is an Emergency! Make sure she is fully dried off afterwards,otherwise she will get a  chill.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps & good luck.xxx|`|qeOlkRM0aa	You can clean her with a damp cloth, and pull the poo off.

Ik6WOcw3aa	If she loves sharks, you are looking at the wrong species with balas. Bala sharks are actually minnows. Very large minnows, but minnows nonetheless. They grow to 12 inches, need to be in groups of 6. And they also need at least 125-150 gallons for said group.<br>  <br>  The smaller option would be red tail sharks. they only grow to about 6 inches and can be kept in a 30-35 gallon.<br>  <br>  If you are willing to spend a thousand plus dollars on a 125 gallon setup for your boyfriends daughter, go right ahead. But you two will be doing the maintenance on the tank, and its more than youd probably think.<br>  <br>  Research the proper care of an aquarium. Research proper care of bala sharks. Research tank cycling and how everything should be done. If you just buy a tank, and put fish in it, theyll die. And I guarantee that. Then youll have to explain why daddy and his friend are fish killers.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Bala sharks NEED space and other bala sharks.<br>  They are fast swimming active fish that will grow to around a foot long.<br>  <br>  The main problem is their adult size, although they are OK in smaller tanks when they are small, eventually they will need a 6 foot tank, just to give them some swimming room.<br>  <br>  They are not fussy eaters, a normal mix of fish food is fine with a bit of fresh or live food as a treat.<br>  <br>  They are peacefull and can live with many other large peacefull fish. When they get big they will eat smaller tankmates, and their size and speed tends to freak out smaller more nervous fish. Mine live with some tiger barbs, kribensis ciclids and a couple of big plecos.<br>  <br>  Unless you have the space, dont buy them. A Rainbow shark or Red Tail Black Shark is a better option for a smaller tank. They will still want 20-30gal minimum, and only get one of those. <br>  <br>  Ian|`|AA11556697	Very good fish, they get BIG therefore they will need to start in a tank no less the 30 gallons...they eat standard flake food and are very docile fish, you can put really any non aggressive fish in there with him and they will live together fine, you dont need several but they dont do bad if you keep them in a group....<br>  <br>  PH should be about 6.5-7 water temp should be around 85... Also you may notice if you put more then one in there one fish will not eat and starve himself its because they are to crowded....also they usually eat off the ground, you wont see them eat floating flakes most of the time you will see them picking up left overs off the gravel...GOOD LUCK!!! they are really fun and active fish!

If you pull on it you should be able to slide it off. You don't want to choke them! For the lizard, depending on the type, you want it fairly tight around it's neck, unless it is just for aesthetics then it can be however loose you want it.

Just make sure it will not slip off their heads. If you have a dog with a narrow head, like a greyhound, you should purchase what is called a martingale collar.

K879Jev5aa	what exactly do you mean by 'bloodline'?  are you referring to the pedigree of this dog?  Where did you get the dog from  i:e, shelter, breeder, rescue?  the term 'pitbull' is  very generic .  There are pure bred dogs of this type...the American Staffordshire, The Bull Terrier..both colored or white, the American Pit Bull  Terrier, none of which your dog looks like.  Chances are your dog is a mixed breed and therefore it is not possible to answer your question.  The dogs you see today that are claimed to be Pit Bulls are actually of no pure breeding.  If whoever you got the dog from claims it to be a purebred, they will most definitely be able to produce the AKC papers and at least a three generation pedigree.  Sorry, wish I could have been of more encouraging help.  But it looks like a cute little mutt pup.....so enjoy it.

It's easy to come up with cute catch phrases, cartoons, or pictures not yet available... So be creative and it doesn't really matter if it's an easy to find breed, or hard. <br>  <br>  2. work on things for mixed breeds. there are TONS of stuff for purebreds, but very little for Mutts. For example... one of my rescued pups is a Bichon/Shih Tzu mix. there is nothing for us owners of mixed breeds. except one car sticker that says "I love my mutt" with a pic of what looks like a boxer's shadow. My dog is small and fuzzy, so that's not representative of my situation. So various types of "Mutt" items would rock.<br>  <br>  3. Instead of gift items for just specific breeds or mixed breeds, how about making an item for people with RESCUED animals? like, "I saved a life" with a drawing of a dog with a giant smile... or "Rescued an angel" with a drawing if a cat with angel wings happily being petted.|`|kvHqnR5Haa	I have a Rat Terrier/Maltese mix - I would love to see the day they have that mix on a t-shirt :)  I know that will never happen!

TQVMAZUbaa	I would leave the older dog at home- he'll feel more comfortable meeting his new buddy on his own home turf. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure about the 19-month-old.  Are you planning to let the child touch and pet the dog immediately?  If so, I would again recommend making that introduction at home where you have more control over the environment.|`|kogageqzaa	they say it's good to introduce both dogs outside of the home before, then bring them in together!!!|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	My suggestion is that you leave your older dog at home. I would also suggest that you take another adult with you to control the child, and to hold the puppy while you drive home. When you get to your home, take the puppy in your arms, and ask your friend to open the door for your older dog to come out. Bend down and let him/her sniff the puppy. Don't put the puppy down just yet. Only put the puppy down once the older dog has settled down. Then just ignore the dogs, just be ready to intervene when needed. Don't fuss too much over the puppy, the older one might get jealous. It will or might take a week or two for the older one to accept the puppy as part of the pack.|`|vIYGV1C7aa	I just answered a question like this a minute ago, lol.<br>  <br>  Have them meet in neutral territory and introduce the puppy butt first.  I know this may sound weird, but this allows the older dog the first sniff and give him the leader role.  I had just done this last Saturday and I will tell you, it made a world of difference.|`|2eJcaeOPaa	take your dog with you first to ensure it "accepts" the new member of your pack and also if you take it with you the dogs will meet on neutral ground so it won't see the puppy as an unwanted intruder. take both dogs on a quick walk around your street then enter your home (please make sure your dog allows the puppy into your house) <br>  good luck|`|59tRtkonaa	well if you have two dogs and if they are goingg to be together all there life i wouldprobablyy bring both dogs so they can bond with eachother on the way back to ur house and get along so when they get home they know eachother alittle bit more.<br>  <br>  =) the puppy is cute btw|`|BjoBZvDLaa	It's probably best if you leave your other dog at home. They say the best time to introduce your dog to a new puppy is when the puppy is sleeping, so the dog doesn't feel threatened.|`|lKVORFx7aa	if it was me i would bing him with me to see if they like each other
an1L8njXaa	Draw reins do not give a good outline, all they do is drag the head down into a false outline.<br>  <br>  Anything that can be done in an arena can be done in a field. You can also do an awful lot of schooling out on a hack.<br>  <br>  I would start with getting him moving forwards off your leg, dont worry about where his head is to start with. Lots and lots of transitions to get him back onto his hocks and using his back end. when he is using his back end properly you can start circles, move the circle inwards and outwards using leg yielding. ask the horse to submit, flex and soften from the poll and jae. do NOT haul his head down, you should push him UP into the bridle. If you haul his head down he will be on the forehand.<br>  Turns on the forehand, turns on the hind, moving him from side to side, keep his mind active and his weight on those back hocks. <br>  All the above exercises can be done either on a hack or in a field! i know because i keep my show ponies schooled on hacks as i dont have a school and my field is very steep so i cant ride on it.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Do not, do not, DO NOT use draw reins! If your horse was trained properly to go on the bit then he still remembers how to do it. Now you need to worry more about conditioning him correctly than training. Once he is in shape you can start working him on the bit, but not before. Have you started lounging him? That is the first step. Sounds like he has tons of excess energy. Hillwork, lots of walk/trot transitions, circles, and some simple lateral work (leg yielding, shoulder in, etc.) will help him immensely. Throwing him in a rig to force his head down will ruin him, plain and simple.|`|BiUNuyfFaa	I would first get a vet check, then go to a horse chiropractor, and a dentist. Then if there is nothing wrong with him you just need to school it all out of him. It is mainly because he hasn't been ridden in a while. You should find an area and trailer him over there about twice a week. If he bucks a lot and shies you need to stand in front of whatever he shies and consistently and if he's hyper before you ride are while you are riding (unless it's controllable) you need to lunge him. I would keep a short crop with me while I ride in case he decides to rear or buck you can smack him on the butt stop him and back him up.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.
bqbrKFeUaa	Dear whoever, <br>  <br>    I would really like to get into barrel racing, when I rode one of your horses she was incredible and I would love the opportunity to do it again. I was wondering if you may be so kind into letting me borrow one of your horses, and teaching me the ropes on barrel racing. I would really appreciate this opportunity. In exchange for lessons I could do work around the house, stables, barns or wherever you need it. I hope you have a great day. Thanks. <br>  <br>  also you could pay her for lessons and using her horse if she agrees to that. good luck.|`|TA4Bvp4Kaa	Its is best to ask in person <br>  <br>  just go up to her and say<br>  hello,Would i beable to ask you something <br>  If she says yeah sure or yes then you just say when i rode one of your horses before i loved it and i would like to get into rodeo would i beabe to ride some of your horses please.<br>  <br>  Tips <br>  Be poilite<br>  The answer will be either yes or no <br>  and if you want some help dont be afraid to ask her|`|IJoM4Q50aa	Like is this a for real question?<br>  If you can't ask in person don't bother.<br>  Asking to use someones horse(s) that you don't even know is a bad idea anyway.|`|9IZ0CmxPaa	ask if she'd be willing to lease the horse out to you and if she agrees negotiate monthly payments and how long the lease would last.|`|J42Fphzmaa	Your horses look like they want someone to ride them. I was wondering if you could teach me to ride.|`|BiUNuyfFaa	Offer to exchange riding and training for mucking stalls and caring for her animals. Maybe she would agree to that.|`|RZPLec5Eaa	Go to her and say "Do you have time to talk?" <br>  if she says "No, not really" then leave if she says "sure" than ask "you have some very nice looking horses and I was wondering if you could give me some lessons off of one of them?"
YhH0PNupaa	Yes, they are edible. The embryo does not start to develop until they are incubated. And despite what the previous poster says, you can identify a fertilized egg when you break it open, if you know what to look for, and no, it is not if it has a white spot. All eggs have a white spot. But once prepared, you can't tell the difference at all, and it is not gross.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	They might be kind of gross, because of the embryo that will have started to develop. But, they are edible. In the Philippines, they have a food called balut, which is a fertilized egg that has started to develop into a chick already.|`|DN6XtoViaa	yes, but if you think about it... it makes it gross!|`|rQlzfHqraa	Absolutely edible. One would need a microscope to see the difference between fertile and infertile eggs. No one can distinguish one from the other no matter how they are prepared. The eggs are identical (without the microscope) until they are warmed up as in starting the incubation process. Then the embryo will begin forming.|`|y1Fihj3Maa	Yes, I always break them separately into a bowl, and remove any blood spots.
sSJ8zfebaa	partition the tank-snakes dont like to be house together|`|9yXp7ap8aa	They need to be the same size, also you must watch how they react to each other to make sure they are not going to attack each other. There must be enough hiding places in the cage for them and two separate heated places. Mostly I would recommend not putting them together in the same cage, but it can be done if precautions are taken.|`|g7LUBdkEaa	it depends on how big they are...<br>  if they are small/medium sized then it probably wouldnt hurt but make sure you keep the tank clean and no blood or anything in there from their feeding or else they will try to attack eachother:)
sXZWQRGdaa	I am guessing what happened is that crickets you put in there laid eggs inside the cage, and they hatched.  This has happened to me a couple of times, which is one of the reasons why I switched to roaches.  You can also avoid this by separating male and female crickets.  Females have a long pointy rod coming out of their abdomen, called an Ovipositor, that is used for laying eggs.  The males do not have this.  The baby crickets don't pose much of a problem and most of them will probably either drown in the water dish or starve to death.  They won't reach a good enough size for your tarantula to eat though.|`|Oq7CAayZaa	why are they in your tarantulas cage?|`|ciyHac5saa	you soon will not have a problem. the crickets will disappear....the spidey will have them for an afternoon snack :)

5d066dce5c9897e016a51927a2fe8ec9aa	PREGNANCY & WHELPING<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   The signs of pregnancy vary from ***** to *****, and some can conceal their secret for a surprisingly long time, especially if there is only one small puppy. On the other hand if there is a large litter, pregnancy may become apparent as early as the third week. During pregnancy the ***** should lead a normal life with a regular amount of exercise, and extra nourishing food, especially protein, should be added to the diet. The yolk of an egg should be given at least once a week. I give my girls a boiled egg every day for breakfast when they are pregnant. Stress, should be added to one meal a day. I am not sure what you call this in the US? but it is a white powder full of vitamins and other neccesary ingrediants, i.e. calcium. Available from your Vets. This will help prevent pre-eclampsia after birth. During the last week it is a good idea to give extra calcium and vitamin D, this makes whelping easier.<br>  <br>  The normal gestation period is sixty-three days, but many Chihuahuas have their puppies two or three days earlier. Puppies can survive as early as the 57th day, and as late as the 72st day, but if a ***** has not had her puppies by the 63rd day always inform your Vet. Also make sure you let your Vet know a week before she is due to whelp, incase you need their services. If it is the first time that you have whelped a Chihuahua, then I strongly suggest that you arrange for your Vet to attend, or another experienced breeder. This way you can be taught exactly what to do and, more importantly, what NOT to do. NO Chihuahua ***** should ever be allowed to whelp by herself. Even with 26 years experience I always make sure I have someone else there to assist me. Two pairs of hands are needed, one to attend the *****, and one to deal with any puppies that may be in trouble when they are born.<br>  Make notes of the various stages, so that the next time you breed her, you will have the information handy. They usually follow the same pattern each time. The wise breeder enters up for each girl the details about the mating, whelping, and when the next season is due. A ***** generally comes into season again four months after the birth of her puppies.<br>  <br>    PREPERATION.<br>  About a week before the ***** is due to whelp make her a special whelping box. Place nice warm bedding in it. The ***** should be kept under observation for the entire week in case she should whelp early, and should sleep in the whelping box in your bedroom. You need to have heat arranged for when the puppies are born. Once again see my suggestion of a heating pad, but some people prefer an infra red heat lamp. A hot water bottle is not a good source of heat, as its temperature does not remain constant. In an emergency puppies can be kept surprisingly warm in a well lined, thick cardboard box covered with newspaper. Loose shredded paper put inside. Keep testing the warmth inside the box, and move the paper to make sure air gets in. I use a thermometer on the box I keep my puppies in, taped to the back of the box. This should register 75 degF, 24 degC, for the first three weeks then the temperature can be slowly reduced to 60degF, 15.6degC. Puppies can not control their own body heat, so temperature is very important. They can fade and die very quickly if not kept at the correct temperature from the second they are born. <br>  <br>  A week before a tray should be set with the articles neccesary for the whelping. These should include some cotton wool, Dettol antiseptic, small artery forceps or a spring hair clip, a hankerchief, some brandy and an eye dropper, or revival drops obtained from your Vet, a jar of vaseline,warm olive oil, a small rough towel for drying the puppies, scales for weighing them, a clock for timing the whelping, and a notebook  for writing up the details for future reference.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  WHELPING.<br>  <br>  Twenty four hours before whelping the temperature of the ***** will drop to 99 degF,(37.2C) the normal temperature being 101.2F. The vagina will soften and there is a sticky discharge. Labour is divided into three stages. In the first stage the ***** becomes restless and licks her rear parts. She may pass urine frequently, and she will start to tear up the newspaper, or ruffle up bedding, to try and make a nest just before the arrival of the first Pup. She will refuse all food, and occasionally a ***** will be sick. This uncomfortable stage may last as long as twenty four hours, butmore frequently it is a matter of just a few hours. The second stage is when the pains change to powerful contractions, which can be seen and felt by placing the hand upon the abdomen, where the hardening of the uterus can be easily felt. These pains last a few seconds and then the ***** rests in between. The pains continue until the puppy is born. The first sign of the puppys impending arrival will be a hardening beneath the bitchs tail. The ***** should never be allowed to push in the second stage for more than two hours without getting help from the Vet. The membranes, or water bag, usually make the first appearance and contain a greenish fluid which protects the pup before it is born and dilates the vaginal passage. Inside this is the pup which is covered in another membrane. The water bag looks like a dark slimy skin and it may appear and disappear with each contraction. The bag varies in size depending on the length of time before it breaks. Sometimes the bag breaks early, in which case it may not be noticed, but the Vet should be informed if no puppy has arrived within two hours after the bag is known to have burst. Novices often mistake the water bag for the puppy and often break the bag in error. This causes a dry birth and may make the labour more difficult. It is easy to tell if it is the pup or water bag by feeling the area, if it is the puppy it will be hard, if soft the water bag.......<br>  Normally, the bag bursts just before arrival of the whelp, which comes out nose first, followed by the paws and with its back nearest the back of the *****. The puppy sometimes arrives all at once with one contraction still entirely in its bag. If this happens, the bag must be broken at the puppys nose immediately and removed from the puppy. If only the head appears and the puppy does not arrive immediately, break the bag at the nose, and pour a little warm olive oil round the neck of the puppy, and the shoulders will probably be born next. Take hold of the puppy with a large piece of cotton wool, or a clean hankerchief I find is good, to prevent it from slipping, and pull the puppy firmly between the *****'s hind legs towards her nose. NEVER NEVER try and pull the puppy straight out away from the *****. If all is wellwith the puppy, dry its mouth and try to pull the placenta (afterbirth) out immediately. The removal of the placenta is the third stage of labour. Use a gentle, firm pull in the same direction as you did the puppy, that is towards the *****'s nose.....<br>  Having got the placenta out, and provided the puppy looks well and is breathing and moving allow a few seconds to pass, then milk the blood in the cord towards the puppy and sever the cord. This enables the blood supply from the placenta to enter the puppy, which will give it a better start in life. If, however, there is any difficulty in removing the placenta, or the cord should start to break, fasten a spring hair clip or forceps to the end of the cord nearest the *****. Pinch the cord between the thumb and forefinger of each hand about an inch from the puppy. Then tear the cord apart, by pulling with the thumb and forefinger nearer the puppy. This is extremely important, because if it is done the other way round the puppy may be given an umbical hernia. If there is any difficulty with the removal of the afterbirth, or the puppy looks weak and is not breathing, cut the corsd immediately, leaving the forceps on the end to prevent the afterbirth the after birth going up into the ***** again. If the cord is torn, it never bleeds, but if it is cut, there may be a small haemorrhage, which is of course dangerous for the puppy. If this should happen, put on a sreilised spring hair clip, or if neccesary the cord can be tied with a length of sterilised cotton. I put on a little veterinary wound powder to the end of the cord., just for its healing properties. You can get this from your Vets, and it is useful for many things, i.e. cuts.<br>  If there is a complication due to the puppy being large and becoming wedged in the vagina, it is essential not to leave it there for more than five minutes at the most. The blood supply to the puppy becomes cut off, and if the head should be out, there is not enough room for the lungs to expand sufficiently. Get someone to help by holding the ***** up, lifting her abdomen, while you try and pull the puppy  away between her legs, ALWAYS towards the *****'s nose. You can use vaseline around the entrance to the vagina. Puppies are remarkably strong and can stand quite a strong pull. It causes some distress to the *****, but one good pull is better for the ***** than long fruitless contractions which only wear her out and may well jeopardise the birth of the other puppies. If you are at all worried about your girl, always get Vet help whatever hour it is. Never think that you will wait until the morning. If you do it may well be to late too late not only for the puppies but perhaps for the ***** as well. It is infinitely preferable to have a ceasarian section than to risk the life of the *****. Nevere allow a Vet to take a puppy away by forceps. I know a friend who had a Vet inexperienced in Chihuahuas who had this happen. Chihuahua bitches are toosmall for this, and frequently their internal organs become damaged in the process. A ceasarian section is always safer, especially with todays anesthesaia.|`|7705cce3c10812f5f7bf95831c55b982aa	Listen to sexyme!

Don't wait another day. This world doesn't need any more puppies dying in shelters.<br>  <br>  If you are planning on having the puppies, you will need to put her on a high quality puppy food in a couple of weeks. The amount of food she will need to eat will increase dramatically. Some pregnant bitches will eat up to 3 or 4 times their normal intake of food. She will need to remain on the puppy food until she is through nursing the puppies. Do not give any kind of vitamin or mineral supplements. Take the dog to your vet for a thorough check up and deworming. If she hasn't been fully vaccinated, plan on vaccinating the puppies at an early age. If she's had all of her vaccines (not just Rabies, but parvo and distemper among others) the puppies will need to be vaccinated at 6 weeks of age. At around 24 days of pregnancy, the vet will be able to feel if there are puppies. You can't tell how many, but you can tell if there is at least one. At about 45 to 50 days, X-rays should be taken to determine how many puppies there will be. Talk to your vet about whelping and care for the newborn puppies and mother.|`|AA10327148	If she mated,  she is pregnant, unless she is very young, or he is very young, or very fat..This is an excellent site with photos, to answer your questions, and help you give the best care for mom, and puppies> <a href="http://www.thepetcenter.com/gen/whelping.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thepetcenter.com/gen/whelping...</a><br>  A little trick, so you won't have to wonder whether she is pregnant, is to measure her girth around the tummy at the last small rib..Mark it on your calendar for 21 days from the time of breeding..At that time, measure again..

Only professional breeders should be breeding, especially small dogs like these.  There are so many that are killed each year in shelters that it's disgusting.  If your dog isn't a champion show dog and you don't have a breeder mentoring you, then your dog should not be bred.  Just because you own a purebred dog, that does not mean you should be breeding it.  Talk to people at the national chihuahua club for more info.  This isn't the thought of people who are against ALL breeding, this is the general code of ethics of ANY reputable breeder.  If you can't live up to that code, then you need to have your female fixed right away.  With 2-5 million animals being killed in shelters each year, only professional bereders who follow the responsible and ethical breeding guidelines should be breeding.  Good luck to you.

The vet can check for skin parasites such as fleas or mites, and also help you determine if it might be allergies.  If you do not find the cause of the irritation, the dog will continue to get these areas.  <br>  <br>  Until you can get to the vet, you can try to keep the area clean and dry, using very mild soap and cool water.  Pat area dry.  You should also get an e-collar to prevent the dog from licking or chewing the area.  Most of the time, it starts as a small area, then the dog irritates it into becoming a large area.  <br>  <br>  Your vet will be able to clip the hair away, clean the area, and get the dog on the appropriate medications.  <br>  Good luck.  And if you are in an area that has flea problems, pick up some flea prevention from your vet, even if you don't see fleas.  Flea allergies are a really common reason for hot spots, and they only take the bite of one flea.|`|AA11315441	Hi..First you need to know what is causing these hot spots....how long has your pug had these hot spots for?.....Is your pug licking his paws or tugging at his ears?....this will determine a lot...diet..diffencey..allergic reaction to a fabric..etc..let me know...
110880288c0077d585cccd853caaeb7caa	Great, independent, funny, vocal, energetic dogs.<br>  <br>  My huskies all loved to chew and dig and were skilled escape artists.<br>  <br>  I like the Drs. Foster & Smith Gorilla Tough wire crate.  The dogs chewed the crate wire and would have easily broken lighter gauge wire.  More importantly, the locking mechanism couldn't be unlatched by them.  So even if you buy a different crate, be sure to get one with a similar latch.<br>  <br>  I don't like plastic crates for the breed because the dogs tend to overheat easily -- an all-wire crate allows better air circulation.  Also get a clip-on water dish for the wire crate -- when the weather's warm you can put a few ice cubes in it to help keep the dog cool.<br>  <br>  Nylabones and Kong toys were household favorites, along with anything leather they could wrap their jaws around, so keep baseball mitts, gloves, shoes, etc. in the closet or up out of reach!<br>  <br>  Don't waste your time or money on all those cute vinyl & rubber squaking toys -- they won't last 30 seconds.<br>  <br>  IF you don't mind cleaning up the mess, do offer plush toys, but know that they won't last more than 10-15 minutes.  All my pups ripped them open and shook the stuffing out, then ignored them.  We found it amusing, so we were happy to pick up all the stuffing from the house and yard.  Don't get plush toys with squeakers in them or the dogs might choke on the squeaker when they rip open the fabric.<br>  <br>  A slicker and a pin brush are essential for getting all the dense undercoat out<br>  <br>  A Cordura nylon or sturdy canvas bed is the way to go.  The fake lambswool and other fabrics won't hold up to husky toenails circling and digging in them several times daily.  Be sure you get one that's fully machine washable and that will fit in your washing machine.<br>  <br>  Multiple water dishes for indoor and out are essential.  Go for a heavy-duty stainless steel.<br>  <br>  Also, the breed can be notoriously finicky about food.  Whatever you do, know that your dog will not starve itself to death.  <br>  <br>  If your dog is one of those picky eaters, don't free-feed it and don't offer snacks.  Have two or three regular mealtimes daily, put food down for half and hour, and then pull it up if the dog won't eat.  Even if the dog doesn't eat more than a mouthful a day, as long as it's drinking, don't cave in and offer biscuits or boiled chicken or leftovers or anything else just because you can't stand to see it not eating.  If the dog learns that going three days without eating a full meal will result in you offering a bribe in the form of a 3-piece dinner from KFC, you've just created a monster, and you'll never need to buy kibble again.<br>  <br>  I love the recommendation that they have their own pile of dirt.  If you don't give them one, they will choose their own location and you won't be able to plant anything in it until after you decide to live with a different breed.<br>  <br>  Good luck, have fun, and be prepared to get lots of exercise!|`|AA11478683	<a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/siberianhusky.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/siberianhusk...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.shca.org/shcahp2a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.shca.org/shcahp2a.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.canismajor.com/dog/siberian.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.canismajor.com/dog/siberian.h...</a><br>  <br>  All of these sites have very useful information! If you need anything further a way to find it is just by searching "siberian husky" or "siberian husky information". This will bring up several sites that have good info.<br>  <br>  From my personal experience...huskies enjoy tennis balls, anything soft that they can chew up, a big pile of their own dirt so they can dig in it without tearing up your yard(if it's an outside dog), they enjoy eating purina dog food and like dog bones (never bones from human food because they can bite off sharp pieces and hurt themselves), they love to run so make sure you have something they enjoy retrieving, sqeaky toys are good, lots and lots of water, even a slightly filled puppy pool is great for outside dogs in the summer, they definitely should be kept in a crate if left alone indoors for long periods of time, if kept outdoors they should be pinned up if left for long periods of time with food water and shelter, it helps outdoor dog in the summer to keep their undercoat brushed out so they stay cooler...that's all I can think of at the moment. Just remember huskies enjoy running, jumping, digging, and chewing so make sure the pen/environment is husky capatable. Also remember, you do not own your siberian husky...your sibe owns you! :) Enjoy!
48e53e0e17ed589c90bce4b47e5d5373aa	Los dientes de leche de los perros<br>  Los cachorros, igual que los ni?os, cambian sus dientes de leche por otros definitivos<br>  Al igual que los ni?os humanos, los cachorros tienen menos dientes que los perros adultos. Los cachorros tienen 24 dientes que aumentan hasta 40 cuando se hacen adultos. Esto se debe a que los perros jóvenes no tienen premolares. <br>  <br>  Los cachorros cambian su dentadura entre los 5 y los 9 meses de vida pero, a diferencia de lo que ocurre en los ni?os durante este periodo de cambio de los dientes de leche por los definitivos, en el caso de los perros este proceso pasa desapercibido, ya que en muchas ocasiones el cachorro se traga la pieza a sustituir y además no expresa su dolor o su incomodidad durante el proceso. <br>  <br>  Sin embargo en muchas ocasiones ese sufrimiento existe, por lo que, para mitigar el dolor, los perros recurren a morder todo tipo de objetos. En ocasiones este dolor puede ser tan intenso que se hace conveniente acudir al veterinario para retirar el diente de leche y dejar paso a la pieza dental definitiva.|`|99f858968e9461960fd02ae7790699b4aa	Los perros no cambian los dientes...no sé de dónde sacaste<br>  esa fuente, los únicos que cambian los dientes son los huma-<br>  nos y los tiburones y el proceso es casi igual., con la única y gran diferencia que los tiburones losestudiante de Veterinaria. cambian cada vez que se<br>  les caen.<br>  Maricarmen Q.|`|5b5cc8ede0b9907e38c5f7cd8258615baa	Los cachorros tienen 28 dientes temporarios, 14 en el maxilar superior y 14 en el inferior.

Large amounts of the virus are shed in fecal material of infected dogs. The virus is resistant to extremes in environmental conditions and can survive for long periods, even disinfectant won't kill it.

560c4e80aed0fd144a16b57cf7e74d46aa	I can't give you costs it all depends on where you are. The big costs are land, buildings, insurance and vets. Your biggest income would likely be from boarding horses. riding school is a killer for insurance. you also want to have a nice little tack shop. they more than pay for themselves. Feed is one of your lowest expenses, really just hay and oats. Manure is sold to be composted,mostly for mushroom farms. <br>  Have you ever worked around horses?<br>   You might want to look up some of the stables near you. you might be able to get a part time job grooming or in a tack shop. They might even need somebody to exercise the horses they have. people often board horses and then only get to ride once in a while. these horses need somebody to ride them now and then or they get fat lazy and forgetful about their training.<br>  A job like that would let you see more about how such a business is managed.|`|a2bec451e9cd3b8cd1204b35638e8bc9aa	it sounds like you know exactly what you want to do with your life. me...im only 13, so if you dont want to take my advise, it's ok. but i know a lot about horses-almost everything you need to know about them. okay, first of all, you need a vet to come and check up on the horses every month. and if you wanted to, you could board horses to make even more money. but i think you would need a lisense.  i have a horse named 'Ty' and he has to have at least a small porsion of hay or he will go nuts! lol. you need to look at their feet every day and stuff like that. my horse kicked me once, and i didn't know y, but after that, i looked at his foot, and there was a nail in his 'frog'!! anyways, if you have any questions, ask me, my email is sammykay590@yahoo.com<br>  and nobody report me because i dont care who emails me!! i'll just block people i dont know|`|AA12146297	well  you need to know more than that, you should go to your local feed mill ( where you buy horse feed ) and ask them some of the questions you have, because it all depends on the age of the horse and how much work it is doing  to deturmine how many caloties it needs in a day and then convert it to pounds.

AA11105335	Puppies have 28 deciduous , or baby teeth, and loose them all, just as children do.  You're very lucky to have to found so many.    I only have four of my pup's  baby teeth.

f8159cd2c63a38f0e3b5c97742d69430aa	in the wild, most rodents bury their food for 2 reasons: so other animals can't find it and steal it, and so they can save it for later.  That way they have easy access to a reliable food source and don't have to worry so much about where to forage, and wont have to spend at much time in the open where predators can get them.  It is pure instinct that isn't bred out of domestic rodents.

6b7352123726385d404e7ac5813a4cd0aa	How old is the puppy? Puppies usually don't have good bladder control until 12 weeks or older. You need to start a good training method ASAP! Crate traing is the best way to do this. here is some great information on how to do this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.inch.com/~dogs/cratetraining.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.inch.com/~dogs/cratetraining....</a>|`|b3a9cb04f7081dd4a39e0319c3aa3acfaa	Sounds like a lack of training to us.  Here's how we train puppies to go potty outside:<br>  <br>  We actually suggest that dog owners NOT train their dogs to go on wee-wee pads or newspaper, because this trains the dog to eliminate inside your house instead of outside. The dog cannot distinguish between it being OK to pee on the pad, and not on any other paper or fabric on the floor...<br>  <br>  To train a dog to go outside, you need to first put the dog on a feeding schedule. We suggest feeding the dog at the SAME TIME every day. This helps to "program" his bowels and bladder to regular feeding and elimination times.<br>  <br>  Don't leave food out for the dog all day. If he eats all day, he'll poop all day. But keep plenty of fresh water available to him.<br>  <br>  ((Keep in mind that puppies don't have any conscious control of their bowels or bladder until they're about 16 weeks old. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't start training your puppy right away; it means that he may still have accidents in the house until he has better control of his body.))<br>  <br>  Dogs usually have to potty about 10-15 minutes after they eat, when they first wake up in the morning, and when they wake up from a nap. Use these opportune times to take the pooch outside. As soon as he goes potty, praise him a lot for being a good dog.<br>  <br>  Dogs will also walk in tight circles with their nose to the ground when they have to go to potty. Whenever you see this behavior ask the dog, "potty outside?" and take him out immediately. Again, as soon as he goes potty, praise him a lot for being a good dog.<br>  <br>  If you're consistent and vigilant he should be house-trained in no time.|`|47004d6023833c5777866194b66ed33daa	Because he isn't trained properly.|`|6e448d27c7cd3b5a643d1536c870a2d2aa	train him and then he will be well trained and wont do that|`|a2bec451e9cd3b8cd1204b35638e8bc9aa	just keep trying to potty train him...teach him to go on smelly pads. you can buy them at petco, if he goes there, a scent comes up and he'll start going outside. praise him when he goes outside, and if you see him starting to go inside, pick him up and put him outside. then praise him...it should work. it did for me|`|e89efa257e9bd88864d309b0c58f510caa	how old is he?<br>  how much water does he drink?<br>  how often does he urinate?

ab6f4aeb2fa995c19d57f03c46366808aa	I totally agree with Petfinder.org  And by the way, there are no "reputable" petstores, all their dogs come from backyard breeders and puppy mills.  And classifieds are a terrible place to find a well bred dog, as well.  Daschunds are prone to back problems, which backyard breeders and puppy mills don't care about, so you have a good chance of purchasing a dog with serious medical problems.  If you want a well bred dog, contact your local kennel club or breed club for reputable breeder recommendations.|`|49604ecf0c59cfd3fe9d19ed71c25571aa	We have a six month old daschuand from a reputable pet store. the search for her was ong and hard as their are not many breeders out there and there are usually only 1-3 pups a litter.

She has never growled or bitten me or anybody else. She does not know a stranger, we take her everywhere, and every person she sees she gets so happy and exitced. They love to lick you in the face and jump in your lap, they love attention, and they love to be loved and give love. They are pretty good watch dogs to, i dont think they really would ever bring anybody down, but as far as odd noises and sounds, they are very alert. The only down side is that they are hard to potty train. Mine is 8 months old and were still in the process of potty training. But other than that they are the best dogs. The best place to look is in the newspaper, for breeders. Thats where we found our little girl.<br>  You'll be so happy once you get one!!  <br>  Good Luck|`|b2a6d99482a460f1947cdf1164f0cc1aaa	A dachshund rescue; go to Petfinder.com<br>  <br>  Its a great site<br>  <br>  And please dont buy one from a pet store.....if you dont know why not, then ask us....we'll tell you why you shouldn't buy a dog at all from any pet store's|`|oYqyREfhaa	go to www.petfinders.org  put in what you are looking for and your zip.

92ad755af15c81dc3a94b91f69f71bf9aa	The white spot is an accepted trait for a Lab. Mine has the same thing. Shes pure, 100% Labrador Retreiver. Shes AKC registered, and if I hadnt had her spayed, I could show her, breed her and sell her pups for a rediculous amount!<br>  This is copied from the AKC website:<br>  "The Labrador Retriever coat colors are black, yellow and chocolate. Any other color or a combination of colors is a disqualification. A small white spot on the chest is permissible, but not desirable. White hairs from aging or scarring are not to be misinterpreted as brindling. Black--Blacks are all black. A black with brindle markings or a black with tan markings is a disqualification. Yellow--Yellows may range in color from fox-red to light cream, with variations in shading on the ears, back, and underparts of the dog. Chocolate--Chocolates can vary in shade from light to dark chocolate. Chocolate with brindle or tan markings is a disqualification.

I got her for a family pet. She is AKC we have papers on her. Since you saved her you do not know if she is pure bred but does it matter? Labs and lab/mix are often great dogs and I wouldn't trade my "big lug" for a solid black show quality for all the money in the world. But from what I have read its not uncommon for them to have small white patch's on their chests. When I got my dog she chose me I didn't chose her I got out of the car the momma dog was very friendly as was the male dog and up came running this little Rollie pollie and it was love at first sight. The people I got mine from were not professional breeders in fact it was their first and last litter but they did point out to me she did have a spot, as if it would have changed my mind. <br>  <br>  Ty for saving a dog love her and care for her and shell do the same for you|`|b7d405b5a046d64fef523353063d4f4baa	Sometimes labs have small white spots on their chests (mostly in black and chocolate labs).

3ceb07ef3923052f53770c9898aa03baaa	This is very strange!  Often cats shy away from their owners if there's been some change in circumstance inside the home: a new arrival or change in working hours, even.<br>  <br>  However, it sounds as though your cat is frightened.  It is possible that it's been mistreated some way, perhaps by some kids or some weirdo.  It's a horrible thought, but chances are if it's not physically injured that the changes in personality won't last.  Let him know that you still love him, give him a stroke now and again and maybe buy a cat toy that you can both play with.<br>  <br>  It seems more likely that the guy is in some discomfort, perhaps from consuming something he shouldn't have (cats are allergic to some kinds of flora, and don't often react well to eating carrion, which they sometimes do) or from sitting in oil from a car, as a cat of mine once did.  He may have something like worms and need deworming, which costs very little to buy from a pet store.  However, if it keeps up over the next fortnight (or earlier if you notice a change in eating or toilet habits) you should call your vet and see if you can't arrange something.  He might be poorly!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  Sometimes cats do change, but rarely perminantly.  If he's stiff it means he's either frightened or in physical discomfort.|`|98b5edad5fc31dce9cdf1d5ec35ea094aa	Call Petco, or PetSmart or another similar place, explain your situation money wise and explain you cats sudden change...they usually have a pretty well trained staff most of the time, in some cases they are pre-vet techs.

I even remember seeing something about it on 20/20 or some such. They showed a black lab that could sense when its person was going to have an epileptic seizure.

Then there r scores of trained therapy dogs who go to visit people in retirement homes, & hospitals.

I don't know actually getting physically helthier but you definitely could feel better.  I play a bunch of sports and even when I'm sore once I'm actually playing the sport and concentrating I forget about being sore its kinda the same thing with animals.  Like I said I really don't think that the animal itself does you any real good but a lot of medical people are starting to recognize the connection between body and mind.  The better you feel the better you will be most of the time.  Sports people are also saying that invisioning yourself doing something makes you a lot more likely to do it.  Maybe just being happier makes people a little healthier.

The best method that was effective for me was trying out the irrigation waterways (or manmade streams inbetween farms) that were not so big.

AA12260782	Unfortunately, that happens sometimes. <br>  Just like little kids grow up and don't want their parents as much anymore, the kitten is growing up and becoming more independent.<br>  It's nothing you did.<br>  Things to try:<br>  Bribe him with food.  <br>  Let him come to you.  Don't chase him around or force him to sit with you, but everytime he comes around you, offer him his favorite treats.  He will learn that you hand out yummy things and want to be around you more.<br>  Learn his habits.  Cats are naturally more active and social at dusk (when the sun is going down), at night, and in the early morning.  See if he will be more playful and loving then.  <br>  Some cats like to cuddle at certain times.  Let him tell you what he likes.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	He's hitting puberty and is discovering the world.  He'll have excessive energy he needs to burn off so won't want to be carried so much.  It's just growing up.  Once he's mature and starts to settle down, he'll need you again to cuddle, maybe not as much as you did when he was little but he knows where to come for love and attention and he will eventually.  This is just a phase.  Just continue to love him, pet him when he lets you, talk to him in sweet tones, etc.  When he's ready, he'll come to you for love and affection.|`|tDZMJue9aa	yeah he doesnt need mom anymore, my cat izzy used to fall asleep in my arms..now she wont even let me touch her..occasionally i wake up to find her at the bottom of my bed..its his personality..just talk to him and in the end he will be who he is gonna be|`|4cf35c900baf2aa599f838360f31396eaa	Your kitty is growing up.  These are the beginning of the "teenage years."  Just because the hormones are not there, does not mean that the mindset will stay the same.  It is now time to learn a new common ground.  <br>  <br>  When your kitty does sit with you, feed him a treat so he is more inclined to sit with you.|`|839b755a8fea24e22aecb4bc22ededb3aa	He's just being an EMO teenager. Don't worry about it in a few more months he'll be all cuddly again. My male fixed cat did the same thing and he was the sweetest boy you could ever find.|`|wuoUAqLeaa	get him so treats and toys|`|1lwmdHe5aa	I had a similar experience with my male cat.  He was cuddly as a kitten, then became very skittish as an adolescent (around the time he was fixed).  He is three years old now and has been asking to be picked up and cuddled more and more over the past year, mostly in the morning right after I shower.  He still doesn't sit on my lap very often but sometimes he decides he wants to "sit on people" and will go to great lengths to do so.  On the rare occasions when he decides to sit, he is much more determined than my other cat, who is a regular "lap cat".  <br>  <br>  Some techniques I have found useful to re-develop his cuddly side:<br>  <br>  1) Make time to cuddle as much as he wants when he is "in the mood".  For my cat, this is usually after I shower.<br>  2) Don't force the issue when he is not interested in cuddling.<br>  3) Pay attention to what he likes to sit on / cuddle with (a certain blanket, piece of clothing, time of day, etc.)<br>  4) Never confine or hold him against his will, just scratch and pet him gently until he moves away of his own accord.<br>  5) Offer lots of praise for behavior you want to encourage, but avoid treats that may attract other pets and disturb your "special time" together.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|45bGMbtRaa	have there been any changes? new pets? new ppl over often? loss of something? a move? if no big change maybe hes just all growed up lol|`|8fxVXrjxaa	This happened to my cat.

Cats go through stages and moods.  --sometimes they are cuddly and sometimes off doing their own thing.  He is ok just changing some as he grows up.|`|AA11216522	Even though your kitten has regular vet visits, it is unusual for his personality to change that dramatically.  I would recommend having your vet do a CBC (complete blood count), urinalysis, and fecal.  Those should show up the majority of what could be wrong.  Also, consider anything in his environment that may have changed in the last few months (another person, change in food, children, moving, etc).  If nothing shows up, you may want to consider getting him a youger female kitten to play with (who can draw him out).   Also make sure his food/water are as far away as possible from his litter box to avoid territorial stress.  That can make a big difference, as well.|`|AA11564348	5 months is pretty young.  before he was a kitten kittens are very cuddly and personable.  As any creature gets older it tends to become a lot more cautious and weary of its surroundings.  I have two cats.  One is pretty old (about 7 or 8 years) now, but I've had him since he was a few months old.  As a kitten really playful really cuddly.  as he got older he became really really cautious and freaky.  he was still a great cat but if anyone he didn't know came in he was hiding somewhere.  he disapppeared for about 6 months when he was a year or two old and came back really skinny.  not that he's older he's really laid back likes to play more again and a lot of times dosen't even care if theres a couple people he dosen't know in the house.  My other cat was really a lapcat (loved being in my lap getting pet ect. ect.) now shes a little more cautious at a year or two old and she still loves to be pet and snuggle but i am almost certain that she'll calm back down when she gets older.  Try not demanding a lot of attention from him.  cats get annoyed pretty easy once they start getting older.   As long as your cats alive he'll love you (the best a cat can)  and will always want to be pet and everything.  don't worry abot it and just let it happen.|`|AA11950327	Don't be sad, he will come back around... I think Christy is right. He is growing up now and isn't the baby he used to be. He will become more independent.<br>  He will always be your Baby and will turn around when he gets through his Teenage Months. He will become Cuddly again, wait and see. The idea of Kitty Treats and Toys are Great ideas to show him you are still his Mama, that you love him, still, no matter what.|`|t3QQRJl4aa	My cat is the same way.  He will come around when he wants and other times he will run away.  Cats have a mind of their own.  Try putting some cat treats in your pocket.  Cats are more social with their own kind.  My cat is more sociable with my 4 month old pit bull.  Think about getting him or her a playmate. Good luck!!!  and don't think that he hates you.  That's just how cats are.|`|be82015a7742a40596c10546ba0c0121aa	I think that this is the stage where he tests you...  <br>  you should pay extra attention to him... and make sure he is interacting at all times.
3iPa8tLvaa	well, i have two hamsters. and what i do is i cuddle them like my babies when i get home from school. haha~ feed them healthy and good food/fruits. change their beddings and feed them water. <br>  <br>  Now they know me by my scent and when ever i come home, switch on the lights, they'd poke their noses btwn the bars of the cage and wait for me to pick them up. haha! its really rewarding actually.<br>  <br>  Occasionally, i let them around around my room for a while. i reckon my hamsters love to "escape" as if i didnt know... haha ... so that's to keep them excited for a while... *Caveat* i need to warn you that hamsters do chew on wired and woody stuff.. so if you have expensive stuff lying in your room.. its really not advisable. once, it chewed some of my sofa setting and my mom screamed at me for a whole month! <br>  <br>  other than that, i think hamsters are very tame and very easily contented pets. =) Just treat them with love, and they will know that they are loved.<br>  <br>  have fun!|`|c52d6e6e32d2971c91d282859069c82daa	Well, feed him good, and give him a treat evryday, and let him run in the ball, and spend time with the little buddy.|`|9tkT77vpaa	They are very curious, so letting them explore and play is fun for them.  Also you can make them toys (like fill a toilet paper roll with bedding and put a treat in the middle), give them more bedding than they're used to so they can burrow, hide food throughout their cage...  For my hamster I don't have a food dish, I'm going to scatter his food around and bury some so he has to "hunt" for it.  They usually make their own stockpile somewhere in their cage.  If you keep them busy they really are a lot happier and that makes them nicer, too.
cqVIQBjXaa	warm your house, and do not set the tank in the sun. that can cause an algae bloom and heat up yout tank to quickly, and on the same token, it can also cool the tank too quickly after the sun sets and would be hard for your fish to adjust to. if you don't want to warm up your house, you could also move the tank to an upstairs room if you have one; warmer air accumulates in upper rooms. this could cause a problem also though because it could prove difficult and time constraining to do water changes when you have to climb steps every time, thus prompting you to reduce water changes and do more damage to the fish than what a cooler tank will do to a fish. if i were you, i would either warm the house, or buy a heater and have it on it's lowest setting. besides, if you ever wanted a tropical tank, you would already have a heater then!|`|545481dc3dd710b5731c739b4c81da98aa	The only thing you can do is turning up the heat in the house.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't put in near a window (in the sun), because it will cause too much algae...|`|0tS7veRPaa	Turn up your heating several degrees, the tank should follow, but of course in the summer phew it can get just too hot! You could place tank by a radiotor, but you MUST keep it on all the time, the fluctuating temeprature can cause stress.|`|DAhkQhqpaa	If you increase the temp in your house by several degrees the tank should heat very slowly to that ambient temp in the house. Good Luck!|`|O2LM4yxbaa	set it in the sun|`|iOqfzSjmaa	Yes
880bf414af7b60e5b70dcea0d1f788c4aa	Unless you have a birth date it is very hard to tell the age of a chinchilla. Do you have his pedigree? What how is the fur quality,and genetics? Do you have a female with a pedigree. Breeding chinchilla's can take months not counting quarantine time, just to get a male and female to except each other if they ever do. Some introductions can lead to injury or even death of the male or both.<br>  <br>  Please do as much research as you can, before even considering breeding. It sounds easy, but the complications like premature kits, c-sections, rejection and having to hand feed every two hours for 5 or more weeks can be devastating. That doesn't even take in to account the vet costs.|`|sDOh1mgPaa	Chinchilla breeding is a HUGE responsibility.  It's true that they're incredibly cute, and their babies have got to be just darling, but it is truly a lot of work, especially if there are complications.  My advice to you is to head to your local library to do as much research as you can on breeding before you start.  Also, another local breeder may be able to help you out a lot as far as what to expect and things they may have learned over the years.  Be sure you know what you're getting into!  It'll be better for you and for the kits.
O2LM4yxbaa	sounds like the baby might be stuck call the vet but whatever yu do dont try to git the baby out yourself it could hurt it if its still alive. it could be a still born in which case you still need to call the vet|`|18635f3bee8d0c05b1d5c6eea8480534aa	ask the vet...|`|AA11821072	is she dripping milk? <br>  <br>  any way, i'd call the vet asap|`|0xJZJggVaa	CALL YOUR VET NOW!!!!!!!!!! <br>  Things can go wrong in a hurry. It could be breech.
kkb2LDu4aa	You should not have a hamster momma in with other female hamsters.  The other hamsters will kill the babies.  If by some slim chance they don't kill the babies outright they will disrupt the mother feeding the babies and the mother will reject the baby.  Sometimes the mother will eat the entire litter.  <br>  <br>  Do more research on the matter of breeding hamsters before you do any more breeding.  Hamsters should be alone with their young and the father needs to be removed before the birth or the mother can become pregnant again.  Back to back breeding will decrease your hammies life expectancy.  <br>  <br>  As for the baby hamster whose legs are missing.  Odds are he will be left for dead.  Hamsters will not care for a hamster who is deformed or dying.  They will in fact eat the offspring who are like this to make sure that there is no chance of offspring from a deformed son/daughter.  It may have been born like this in which case the parents of this litter may in fact be brother and sister.<br>  <br>  Oh and do not use and wood based bedding in your habitats.  Use only paper based bedding.  And most of all NEVER USE CORN COB bedding.  This type of bedding will grow a fungus overnight and kill all your dwarf hamsters.  I have already spoken to the makers of the Corn Cob bedding and they know that this fungus is very strong with dwarfs but refuse to change the bedding labels.|`|O2LM4yxbaa	is the mother letting it eat? if not i would call a vet and ask what the vet thinks|`|389c7ca909ed8e7d45814f58d66fe8bbaa	This may sound cruel, but let mom eat it or one of the others.  Or you can try to have momma force feed it by holding her there and puting the baby on her to nurse.  One of the others may have tried to eat the baby, but got interupted befor they finished it.  Dwarf hamster mothers should have their own cage to raise their babies in.  I've seen a surprise litter almost get all the babies eaten by the other females we had no blood either from this happening in the cage.  Please put her by herself with her babies for their own safety.  Take the other females out and leave momma in the cage she had the babies in.  I you bred the mom, you can't breed her ever again due to this birth defect.  It very well can happen again.  I used to breed Russian dwarf hamsters back a while ago and quit after cancer developed in the breeding pairs.  I ended up keeping all the babies and still have 6 of them.  Nearly all have died from the cancer and one has it now.  Since you have babies the litter to use now and always is not any wood shaving, but a paper product litter.  Wood shavings can mix with the urine and become toxic causing respiratory problem and death.  Others woods cause allergic reactions in the small animals.  We only use the paper product liter for our small animal pets (rescued or not).
o1F1NGE2aa	Not only do laws vary by State they can also vary by county and city. Some cities have ordinances against them<br>  Try and locate a local herp society if your talking about snakes, they will know the laws and if you need a permit to keep them|`|StV5Lfskaa	The laws on having venomous what?

If you show you have the proper knowledge and reasons to have them you might get a permit. But even than it's hard to get due to the fact of zoning laws for certain towns.If you live in a apartment building you will never get one.To close to normal people and if it ever got loose you put alot of people in harms way,along with the reptile.<br>  I got my license through the bronx zoo and the county came to my home to inspect where I planm to house them. All the tanks were ready to have a speciman I already had chosen with latin names,times the ate ,shed,defecated,and when I last milked them,how much was yeilded etc.<br>  They would show up without notice many times the first year but when they were satisfied that I kept them like that they stopped and granted me more licenses for even more dangerous species.<br>  But at the same time a friend of mine tried without a license, got caught because his girlfriend got bit, fined over 20,000.00$ and 6 months in jail due to the fact he lived in a condo complex<br>  So good luck with your decision
39d9efe6fbe36f908ac0cf0a7d919780aa	Lol. Your cat sounds fine. Some cats are like that. My cat is 1 1/2 yrs and has a very high pitch meow. She sounds adorable!

Last place we lived there was a cat called Squeek. He'd been rescued from a owner who was really cruel to him. He was a friendly cat, actually, once he got to trust you, beautiful tabby with tiger-like orange under the stripes.<br>  He'd walk up  to you and open his mouth (he was a large cat too), and out would come the smallest meaow you've ever heard...hence his name. He was classic!|`|a2bec451e9cd3b8cd1204b35638e8bc9aa	a cat's meow doesn't always have to change.|`|rTr1fBopaa	I don't know, my one year old male's meow sounds really girly and high pitched.  Maybe something to do with the neutering process???  Cats' meows do sound different depending on the cat, I have had several cats and they all sound completely different.
DQnGZXjDaa	just watch the females carefully. they shouldn't have any problems, but if mom gets territorial or the other female seems to not like the baby, then separate the other female. you can put dad back in in about 5 days. male chins usually make very good fathers. baby chins are very curious and fearless! if the wire on your cage is too big, the baby could get out, so if you don't have mesh that's 1" by 1/2", buy some at a hardware store and wrap it around the cage until the baby gets bigger. one story cages are best for babies - they can climb too high and fall and injure themselves. if you have more than one floor, block off the upper floors or move shelves up higher so baby can't get to them. the mom will move the baby as she wants to, but the baby should be moving around on its own pretty soon, so don't worry about that, unless baby is not moving at all. one thing you can do is get a small piece of pvc pipe that is small enough for the baby to get into, but not the females. it gives the baby a place to go when the adults are bouncing around so it doesn't get trampled. you can e-mail me if you have any questions. good luck! chin babies are the cutest little things ever.|`|dce2b7e03fad6246563e2d4ed8fad9d4aa	Do not touch the baby-the mother can lift it and bring it wherever she desires-<br>  although some cases can do well as an extended family in the wilds they have room to chose<br>  <br>  in many cases the mother needed to be separated alone before the birth-try and take all the others out now and leave the mother-when she is done weaning the baby the others can be reintroduced-yet observe carefully if there is any aggression toward the baby or each other -separate them again.<br>  <br>  this is what got me through when my pet had her baby-having a best friend helped most of all=salvation in Jesus Romans 1 to a thankful heart that choses to worship the creator instead of the created.<br>  <br>  I agree on the Creator Jesus side- "The heavens declare the glory of God, and His word defines who He is."

And it isn't going to teach him anything except that you are scary.<br>  <br>  Try training him instead. Take him to a class and teach him what you would LIKE him to do. All of you will be much happier with that.|`|AA11908233	Most dogs misbehave when they have family issues. I dont think scolding will help but make matters worse.
