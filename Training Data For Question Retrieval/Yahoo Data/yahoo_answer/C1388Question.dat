20090304154556AA96YjS	Social Science;Psychology	What Is This Strange Social Behavior!?	Ok now i am a very reserved person, i don't talk as often as some people and i struggle for topics for conversations and things and i get judged negatively sometimes.   Throughout my entire school life and even college now people behave around me, when people see me they always say my name in weird ways and say things like Frankieeeeeeeee in strange ways or frankie lad and it isn't just kids, teenagers and people but adults as well, its strange because i cant imagine them behaving this way around anybody else, for example a lad who tried helping me saying i need to more confident in social situations and talk more always does it, he give me advice and ive noticed even Friends do it as well, like when i play football and do a successful tackle someone will say Frankie lad and things and im like why!? i will tell two examples, once not long ago when i was playing volleyball i impressed and this person Frankieeeee and things this may sound strange but its a not a normal social behavior and for another example i took a really good shot in basketball and just missed and this lad shouted Frankie before i threw, why do people do it....they say all sorts of different, rarely negative but just say my name a lot, is it cause im quiet lad or is it cause they don't like me or pity me please explain its bugged for YEARS.
20090304154630AAmUBZG	Social Science;Psychology	Can't take this life anymore. HELP ME Please?	It all started about 7 months ago i was in school and got a horrible smell that im glad only my guy Friends could smell at and all boys table. We all thought it was a girl smelling like that. (so you know what smell im talking about (FISH) ). Now wait a minute im a guy and i thought it was a girl but when i went to the bathroom to do my stuff a big blow of fish blew right out of my pants and i said "WTF that was me". So i went back in class not saying anything playing it off and think good the next day i did not smell like that but i have another smell that is staying with me and i don't know what to do about it. It's making me depressed and paranoid and stressed out and im failing classes and i keep getting fussed out by my mom because im trying to wash this damn smell of every time i get making the water bill high. I used antiperspirant deodorants and anti bacteria soaps and none of this stuff is working. I eat the same stuff i was eating when this was not happening and NOW i can't take this life any more. THE Odor has spread all over my body now and i can't stop sweating no matter how cold it is today it was around 20 and im sweating outside WHY did god have to do this to me what did i do. Im thinking about going to the air force because i don't want to go to college or have a job where people tease me or something. Im only 15 in the 10th grade and my life feels like it's ending i can't even talk to girls anymore and i have had two doctors appointments but they got canceled and now i have a new doctor. What if she hot and i have to tell her all this. I sit next to a pretty girl i used to talk to and she keeps covering her nose when i sit next to her and we don't even talk no more i walked in front of some people in the hallway and they said what is that smell? This is a everyday problem that won't go away. WHY GOD? WHAT DO I DO? IM LOST

20090304155108AAjwsMW	Social Science;Psychology	Any therapists/social workers/psychologists out there?	Ok, so my family has been under investigation by DSS (department of social services) about five times since I was little, and they are investigating again. This past week I had an injury so I called my therapist and told her I couldn't come in ( because I was worried she would report the injuring to DSS since I know they have been in communication). She called and left a message on my phone the day after, saying she wanted to talk to me about the whole situation. - I ignored the first message, but she left another one today. - I don't know what to do. I don't want to call her back because I don't want to talk about it and she doesn't really take no for an answer...... but I don't want her to get mad at me for not returning her calls either.. what should I do.. please help! What would you want your patient to do?

20090304155332AAu10cN	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Is it better to give answers you know everyone will like & get you points, or say the actual truth?	So I'm on yahoo anwers (specifically in Womans Studies) to help people with questions. I go about it by saying and being as truthful as possible about what I know based on what I've actually seen, experienced, and proven. I see some others do the same. I see that those aswers rarely get picked for best answer, or thumbs ups.       The answers that usually get the thumbs up are the superficial ones. Ones that sound good, seems pretty to the ears but holds little or no actual truth. It simply makes the questioneer happy to know someone else agrees. And I'm not talking about answers I kind of believe to be wrong, I'm talking about the ones I know for a fact are wrong. We've all seem em.      So, I ask you, is it better to just not care about actually telling people what you truly know, and instead tell them and everyone reading exactly what they want to hear? In the end, what does it matter, who cares what the truth actually is as long as everyone is happy.      Your thoughts?

I dreamed my mom drove me and my sisters to what looked like my old middle school in the middle of the night. There were a whole bunch of people there as well... the building was different inside. I sat on some very large steps with a few other people from my high school while the adults stood under the steps. (doing nothin not even socializing). My friend sits next to me and names all the songs I'm listening to on my MP3 and tries to kiss me (he like pressed his face on me but i reject him)  he leaves and I see my other friend sitting at a table (looked like he was reading). I called his name and he sort of ignored me at first then he comes sit by me. We leave together and sit together alone between to bookshelves (we are in a library now but everything else is still the same). Thats all I remember.      What does my dream mean?

20090227083350AAzsN2j	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Is this just another one of those stereotypes?	Society says that if a woman has sex with her guy friend she will automatically think there is somethimg more and he really loves her.      I disagree.  If I had sex with a friend it'd be strictly physical and brief pleasure just like how he'd see it.      By the way I'm a virgin and wouldn't do that.      They also say that when a girl has sex with a guy even just for brief pleasure she gives a part of herself away.  How is that? emottionally.  How can you give yourself away to a guy emotionally if it's just brief pleasure?      Can it also go both ways?  If the guy and girl agree to have sex but agree it's just for fun would the guy fall for her and think there's something more? especially if he's a sensitive type.      I'm talking about two single consenting adults in their 20s and older.
20090227082938AAZlT9N	Social Science;Psychology	Is there such a thing as "compulsive creativity"?	Perhaps its related to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. There are times when I get anxious and agitated because I can't do.... SOMETHING. Paint, sculpt, play one of my instruments. My mood goes into the dumper.       But, if I'm able to get a few hours of creative activity in, I feel much better and I'm a better person to be around.      I've given away lots of little canvases that I've done. I don't know if they're hack or have some kind of artistic sense to them. And I'm not sure it really matters.      Does anyone else have this issue? It almost feels like a disorder... like OCD (which I have, btw). Are there other ways to control this BESIDES painting, music, or whatever?      Seriously looking for some insight. Thanks for your thoughts!

20090306161049AAe6n3j	Social Science;Psychology	I snapped...do you think I looked like a psycho?	I'm a nerd. I admit it. Our French class was over at the end of the day and I said something to a friend in French. She's a very lanky and whiny person, so I was expecting a friendly 'what the heck?' and then this bytch (whom I will devote an entire paragraph to), whispers to my friend 'the day's over...what the heck?' as in 'who the f*ck wants French right now?'.      I got ticked off. She has a reputation for sneering at people, making fun of them, snickering, etc. In grade ten, all the way through the semester, she poked fun at me with this other bast*rd who swaggers around the halls thinking how beautiful he must be.      This semester, she was nice to me...particularly nice, but there was something fishy. I felt like she was trying to give a good image to other people. So I got ticked and I went to her (after school, sitting on the stairs) and politely yelled at her that I'm sick of her attitude and that she led me to the brink of taking anti-depressants in grade ten because of the emotional and social pressure she put me in.      She gave the look (a very nice friend of hers was there) that said 'what the heck is he talkin about?' and I just walked off. Do you think she's unaware that she tormented me the year before or that she's too cocky to know? Do you think she thinks I have actual issues? Or is she going to realize what a bytch she was? Should I talk to her later on? i didn't swear btw.

Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b. What do you guys think?      I cant seem to get these thoughts out of my head and this has completely taken over my life..any help would be great i am really suffering here, i just really dont know what else to do..i am on paxil and have considered therapy but i dont know if that will even help me..       I have always had obsessions throughout my life. But not one that has gripped one so violently like this. I am sure people are sick of seeing me ask this, but it is theraputic for me to get reassurance, although i know it is not a solution. I guess i just feel silly seekign therapy for something so ridiculous. It is embarrassing.      I want to try and get over this without going to therapy, i am just not sure how.      Should i seek therapy? I have already checked my credit report and what not, but i always seem to just tell myself it just hasnt happened YET

20090227082324AAuJ1OQ	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What if we just admit that girls are better at school?	Girls have always done better than boys in education, since they were first allowed access to it.  The first women to force their way into universities in the late 1800s almost never failed, they passed their exams with aplomb.  The Grammar school system has recorded higher results for girls since it started in 1945.  Meta-research biological studies show that increased language abilities for girls are reliable across almost all groups (one of the few biological 'advantages' I will accept there is some evidence for).      I do not believe that the education system is feminised, since much of this asymmetry existed at times when there were very few female teachers.  I do not believe that coursework is the deciding factor, since this is a relatively new concept, and does not account for girls increased performances in exams.      The gender gap in education exists across all ethnicities, all social and cultural groups, and almost all countries of western Europe (except Portugal and Spain, I believe).  Even for the children of upper class professionals, who get the best grades of any socio-cultural group, and who could be expected to receive the best education and tutoring available to them - show an 8% gender gap in education results at age 16.      Is it time to admit that perhaps girls are simply better at school - and to give boys extra help?  Is the age-old belief in automatic male superiority causing boys to get left behind, and if so, is it time to put it to rest, in the name of giving help where help is clearly needed?      What are your thoughts?  :-)

20090227081538AAv4Hhd	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What does my zombie dream mean?	Last night I had the oddest dream.  I was in the middle of a zombie infestation and holed up in a house with the only other people in town who weren't zombies (none of whom I knew).  At one point, the one guy Max gave me a shot to vaccinate against the zombies, but one of the other girls in the room was already turned into one and I just left the room running.  In the living room, one of the guys was turned into a zombie and killed Max and the other guy.  I gave them all a shot and the zombie turned back to a normal person and Max and the other guy came back to life.  They joined me when we went underground to this bar/restaurant/shop/subway type place where I met up with my two real life best friends who were trying to kill my ex boyfriend (who was now a zombie).  I ended up killing the ex boyfriend and we patrolled the rest of this underground community to rid it of zombies.  The whole time, this guy Max (who I didn't know) never left my side.  I woke up as Max and I were glad that we saved this place.      What does this mean?  I could understand it if I fell asleep watching zombie movies, but I didn't.  Thoughts?

20090306193347AAJ0lCc	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why do women have a problem with men getting more money for doing the exact same job ?	Since when is your salary supposed to refelct the quality quantity or value of your work ? If that would be the case a police officer would get more money than a pro basketball player, with being kept safe being more important than getting amused by a ballgame.      Money reflects an compensation both parties have to agree to, to obtain product X or service X nothing more nothing less.       So why are women angry at men for being better negotiators and being more bold when asking for a salary ? Isnt it their own fault if they agree to do the exact same job for less ?   Again the feminists blame men for what is essentially their own fking fault.   Will they blame patriarchy too when they found out they could have asked for 25% more on that Sedan they sold ?

I cann't undo this curse because it feels like a tatoo.And i'm tired of living in this fear.      Theres no more Audrina.
20090306165139AA4hi5T	Social Science;Psychology	This isn't normal, is it?	Okay, so I had to talk to a teacher about something. Talking to teachers causes me great stress and I'm pretty uncomfortable talking to people other than my friends....and while talking to her, tears were just building up the whole time. By the end of my conversation I just wanted to melt into the ground and cry. But I didn't do either...should I talk to a guidance counselor about my fears...? Does this mean I have social anxiety/phobia or w/e? Help...I feel so stupid.

Okay so this morning as I was calling roll, I hear one of my students say to the other "Hey I wish I could have seen Madea Goes to Jail." And then his friend says "Oh." And then the child says " Yea, I know dude, and my mom won't take me because she doesn't want to be sitting in a theater with a bunch of blacks." And then the other child says " Well it doesn't matter to me."      Should I be aware of the child whose mother is like that cause I have no idea what to be thinking right about now.

20090306190645AAb1Ad6	Social Science;Psychology	What is happening to me?	I'm turning into such a bitter person. The only guy I was ever in love with shattered my heart last year, my friends have all become party animals and are drifting apart from me, and schoolwork is absolutely killing me. College is so difficult for the past three years...I'm so exhausted and frustrated all the time.      I used to be this happy, fun-loving, romantic, beautiful girl before. Now, I just hate love, hate seeing people happy, in love, or even with their friends. I just want to be alone and miserable for the rest of my life, for some reason that just sounds more appealing to me than opening my heart up to anyone again, whether it be in love or friendship. All I ever want to do is study and do homework, and then later on in life, i just want to be a workaholic. I even despise seeing happy couples. What is happening to me?Is this just a phase?

I'm very shy and will never have a girlfriend.  I really don't want a girlfriend. (I don't want a boyfriend either.)  I do however want to be touched.  It's human nature to crave contact with others. Prostitution is illegal and I'm out of options.  Do I just die never having experienced the touch of another human being?  Please help me. Please be serious. This is not a joke.

I dated this WONDERFUL guy who showed me how it is to be loved and have somebody to talk to everyday and somebody who cares about what you think and how you feel. I basically blew it with him and now it's over, and I can't stop thinking about him. The worst part is that he showed me what I'm missing in life, having friends, having a boyfriend.   What can I do now? I have no friends, and he's gone. I live in a country where people are very unsocial and it's really hard to make friends here.      I tried "liking" being alone and doing things that make me happy, but this only made me more sad. I seriously don't know what to do to be happy again. Help?
20090306170146AAxbHCd	Social Science;Psychology	Any disorders characterized by the following list of symptoms?	I'm going to list some traits, if you are aware of any disorders that go with it, please share:   -Frequent changes of personality, not to a degree of dissociative identities, but more or less “adapting” to be like whoever they are around at that time, however unintentionally.    -Perspective of the future is unrealistic and vague, shifting on a daily basis. No real plans. A lack of authentic caring for what happens next.   -No empathy. Unaware if they are really feeling at all. Going with the first symptom, (constantly adjusting personality to that of those around) the same goes with emotions. Constantly displaying the emotions picked up from others, not really feeling them genuinely.   -Absolutely no sense of guilt or remorse, but at the same time lacking happiness, either. They are never satisfied with anything, even if they are given what they want. Shows signs of depression but never feels sad.   -Confused as to why no one seems to like them. Understanding they are different but never admitting they are wrong.   -Easily slipping into patterns and yet hating ritual behavior. Bored with everything and everyone. Doesn’t perceive people as valuable and treats them like puppets, complaining of conformity and growing either aggressive when told what to do, or completely ignoring of authority.   -Addictions    -Cutting for the “thrill of pain”. Perceives physical agony and emotional torment as “beautiful”. Likes surprising and often frightening people. Enjoys doing things just to see people react.    -No regrets for actions: theft, lying, has a record.   -Is unable to connect with anyone around them, but does not necessarily like this. Needs someone at all times to love them, though they don’t seem to love back.   -Pyromania   -Insomnia   -If bed wetting is a factor, it did not cease until twelve or thirteen years of age.   -Sense of narcissism, though often when no one is looking seems very, very lost.   -Comes from an extremely traumatic past and a history of dangerous criminal behavior in family.   -Loss of interest in school. Always thinking things are “not supposed to be like this”.   -Callous, empty, blank; but exceedingly intelligent.   -Needs a thrill at all times, even if it means putting their health at risk.   -Manipulative since a young age.   -Cruelty to animals, though a vegetarian… Constantly contradicting self.   -Step parent describes them to be “completely heartless”.   -Doesn’t like social situations despite an apparent ease of making friends.   -Irresponsibility; won’t take credit for actions.   -Charming when you first meet them but this wears off very quickly in which case they become short tempered and quick to turn on you.   -Paranoid   -Often caught up in delusions.   -Obsessed with any information on murderers, serial killers, etc.

In the past year these are the things we have done to each other that I can think of just off the top of my head... there is most definitley more:   - He sent me a message that was to another girl so I asked for his  friends phone number.   - He had some girl he was with call me and ask me stupid questions so I made out with someone on the dance floor right in front of him.   - He called me numerous names: crazy, skank, etc. so I called him similiar names.   - We continued to sleep together through all of this. Things got worse.   - His friends got into a fight and he yelled at me and told me it was my fault. i told him i never wanted to speak to him again then went to a party he was having and made out with his friend while he was sitting beside me.   - We continued to sleep together. Things got worse.   - He was hitting on some stupid girl in front of me and being a jerk to me so I told him he was just a rebound and a waste.   - We continued sleeping together. Things got worse.   - He invited me out on a date then also invited another girl out on the same date. The next day I slept with his friend. I then slept with his friend again a couple days later.       Why the hell do we do these things to each other? It can't possibly get any worse. I don't know what to do.   -

20090306175427AADB7XG	Social Science;Psychology	What the hell. Anyone know what's wrong with me?	I am not a very happy person. I live a normal life, granted I act kinda crazy. I don't like pain, but at the same time I love it. I won't hurt myself, but when I do, I kinda like it.   I'm very insecure, but not to a mental extent. I've never been tested, but I'm pretty sure I'm not unstable. I freak out and get all weird. I call myself pathetic, and sometimes am just so disgusted at me that I can't even say anything and just stare at my reflection. When I freak out, I tend to not move, my eyes flit, and I think I'm just being dramatic and tell myself to shut up and stop being so stupid and pathetic and dramatic and stuff. Lately, I've been "freaking" more often and my lips are shaking. Like, litterally trembling uncontrollably. It's really weird and I feel all cold, and I don't move when I'm like this, barely. Even if I have some discomfort. I start shaking sometimes.   This happens RANDOMLY. In the middle of band rehearsal, during science class, at church, at home, in the shower. I start to crunch up and lately I've been grabbing my head and curling up.  I imagine sometimes that my wrists are pulsing with just a little too much blood, but I don't cut myself.   Do you think there's something wrong with me? I'm just going through teenage-hood, right?

20090306194223AAttnzQ	Social Science;Psychology	The one who did nothing got all the credit??? Pls advice im feeling depressed?	Ok, so me and my so called friend had to do this assignment and she is not the type who works. She is too lazy and not smart when it comes to studies. She kept postponing the work and delaying and i had to do everything on my own because i wasnt like her. I do everything on time and i am very responsible. All she did was the printing which anyone can do. Even that when i call her and tell her to print something she would say things like oh its too late now and that i should have told her earlier (when there is like an hour left for her to print one page).         Anyway, i did everything and it was now time for the lecturer to asess us where the lecturer would ask questions and we would be graded according to how much we answered. Before the assessment i sent every document to my friend. And she had memorized everything. I was nervous during the assessment so didnt know what i was talking and even the words didnt fit into a sentence.       Before the assessment i had talked with my lecturer many a times to clear my doubts about the assignment and answered many of her questions.          The reason i didnt com[plain to her about my friend was because i didnt want to ruin my friendship.      Anyway i am feeling depressed now because i did all the work and some one else is getting all the credit. And the lecturer doesnt know what i went through to put this assignment together.       The assessment hold only like 4% of the total marks, the rest is on an individual report. but I think about this every single day, even in my dreams i see it.          What should i do? Telling the lecturer now is of no use.And this has happened to me in the past so im sad when i think that when im doing a job people will start taking advantage of me like this and i want get my due credit

I've been trying for so long to do it myself, but I just can't seem too. What I think I need is a therapist and someone to just talk too.

Same thing with my friends.      I really think that a therapist is what I need, but I'm kind of nervous and afraid.

20090306212759AAvaWBb	Social Science;Psychology	I'm an extremely shy guy who's very introverted and I'm trying to make friends. Can you help me?	So I'm 17 going on 18 in May. I've had a lot of bad experiences with people in my life and that led me to isolating myself from them. As a result, I've had no friends all throughout high school. Recently though, I managed to meet this girl last year. She's an anime geek and very nice. She gave me her e-mail this year and she started to open up to me about problems she was having. The best thing she said to me was that I was one of her close friends. That made me feel really good. She's very social and has a lot of friends, which kind of led me to being insecure, but she said that a lot of these people actually irritate her sometimes.      She was in grade 12 last year and I was in grade 11. She came back for another semester this year and left last month. This made me depressed again because I really enjoyed her company. I think I might be having romantic feelings towards her, but I don't know. I really want to talk to her outside of school, but I'm scared to ask her to go anywhere with me. I hang out in this area with her friends, but I don't really talk to them. They have been talking to me a little though and now I'm trying to be more friendly with them. I really like them because they are nice. I want to try to become more close with them. We all have the same interests, so that might make it easier. I'm going to try to force myself to talk to them and get to know them more. I'm just so sick of being alone all of the time. I may have finally found people I can relate to so I'm going to do my best to get closer to them. We'll see though.      It's just that I never hang out with anybody and I would really like to hang out with them if they don't mind. I'm really scared though that they might not accept me or that I won't be able to get close to them. So I'm asking you for advice. Can you help me?

20090306213921AAhEZnT	Social Science;Economics	Does it take $1000/hr experts to fix the economy?	Hell no. We are getting beat up by the government, the banks and the courts. The ceiling allowed by the credit industry is 32.99% interest plus over limit and late payments for accounts in arrears. Go figure. They are not just making good profits, the banks are making outrageous profits by parenthesizing off of us. We need to stop supporting the credit industry, and find ways to help ourselves independent of the banking system. Enough of the foreign control of our economy.  AIG is predicting repayment of the bail out money within a few years. That's on our backs not theirs in three directions. We are taking the economic hit. We are putting up the cash. We allow them to make the financial rules which prey on us. It won't be accounting back to normal for most of us. It will be deep national and personal debt, higher taxes, and a government gone 1984 ballistic.   Here is my prediction. Take a look at Gaza. The same is planned for us. It has begun. People are being moved from their homes wholesale. Then, these bastards are swooping in for a windfall of profits by investing low. No jobs, no medical services, and  people living in garages, families disparate to put food on the table, and education reduced removing opportunities for the common working folks.      I have said this for years. The elites don't want your children competing with theirs.       Here is a big clue. Obama is working to fix the credit industry, which he believes will fix the economy. Not so, pal. We need to get off of the credit habit. Personal, and civil credit makes no sense. Credit is always a loosing situation.      Do you know what AIG stands for, American International Group. Isn't that an oxymoron?

As if that wasn't bad enough, I wasn't wearing anything but my underwear and 2 of the boys who saw me were the most green-minded in class. I was so humiliated! The other guy who saw me was a senior and I'm sure what happened will spread throughout school. How do I face humiliation on Monday?      I have a feeling this will be talked about for MONTHS. How do I cope up? How can I show them I'm strong and not affected by what happened? Please help. It would be really appreciated. :)

20090306213801AAwP3rW	Social Science;Psychology	How can I control my mind because it won't let me take charge!?	My mind is very succeptable to influence.  For instance if im standing over a bridge and i think "i could throw my phone over" there becomes this HUGE urge to do it even though after i leave i feel relieved and think it was stupid.  same happened once when i thought another man was good looking and i asked myself if i were gay and months afterward i fretted over the possibility even though i know deep inside i wasn't and have never liked a man in my 25 years of life.  Then there was this time when i was fooling around with my ex.  we just watched silence of the lambs and i started thinking "wow i could easily bite her like he did" then i actually felt that strong pull all over again.  this also happens if i saw a new mole and i some how convince myself its cancer.  WHAT CAN I DO TO SOLVE THIS!?!?!?!?  deep inside i know all the answers to the following things but i keep asking myself "what if's" and eventually my mind becomes so clouded i believe it to be so! HELP!!!!  It goes in cycles too, every time i get a mole i thin its cancer, if one day im not as turned on by my hetero porn i think im gay.  Look down from high heights i want to jump etc.. -_-

My life has a been a terrifying roller coaster and now, all I want to do is GET OFF! I always think that when the fan is on and the doors are shut, something dirty is going on. When my parents r texting each other and I ask what they r talking about and they tell me none of my buisiness, I think it's dirty. When I hear the wind I think it's moaning. How can I change this to live a normal life of an 8th grade girl. Thanks for all my supporters!
20090306205222AAmWwbM	Social Science;Psychology	Is this a good reason for a friend to get insecure or mad and get on my nerves always?	1) i cancelled on my friend 2 times after we made plans by just telling her something important came up and i had to go help someone. she asked who and i said i could not tell.   2) my friend and i planned a weekend trip. i cancelled and said i needed to go out of town to help someone and it was important. she again asked who and what is happening, i just said "i can't tell you. but, i need to help someone."   at the same time i sort of stopped giving my friend as much time for other reasons as well. but, i told my friend to not feel left out and i do like her.   slowly, my friend started to feel that i was ignoring her etc etc and she got very insecure and very very annoying and clingy.   was i wrong in anyway?   i dumped my friend for all her crap. i told her i needed space and i gave her enough chances to change.   now, she is apologizing.      i did not always lie. 80% of the time i did have to help someone. 20% i may have lied as my friend was getting insecure and clingy. so, i used the same "help someone" as a reason to avoid her.

20090227085945AAieGjk	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Anyone want to interpret my latest (sexual) dream?	I had this dream last night, and it made sense at the time...but not so much now.  Anyway, I'll start from the first thing I remember.  There was this guy with this girl and they were having sex on this giant top bunk and me and some other people were watching. It seemed to be like a contest or a matchmaking of some kind because when it was over, everyone was asking them how it was.  The guy and the girl both agreed, they said "baka" which in the dream meant good or great, but it was like it an inside joke.  (Strange because in Japan it means "idiot").       But there was something wrong with the pairing of the two that I was missing. Because of something I sensed. Maybe he was her brother, who knows (gross, I know.) The guy turned to me and said, "Why don't we let Ian give it a try". And I was like "um....okay."      I'll spare the details but we were completely naked and there were no sheets and the room was well lit.  It was weird at first but started to feel good and we got into this pumping rhythym and it got feeling much better and more intense cause I had her pushed against the back of the bed and the pillow.  While we were doing it, the people kept asking us about the experience like they wanted a play by play.  Also there was no climax, it was as if it was a test-run to see if we were compatible. At one point she said "this is good too". Other things were said I can't remember. I felt like I made a connection with this girl.  I don't remember anything about her physical body though.      I want to make an important point here now.  I've only had sex once in my life (aside from oral) and it was pretty forgettable. But in dreams, I can never have sex.  All my life (before and after the real deal) sex in dreams has eluded me. It's hard to explain but it's like the person fades away or changes or the dream changes, it never continues for more than a few seconds. Often even their face or age changes before my eyes.  And it's usually the result of me trying to take control of the dream. In this dream it flowed and even though there was no climax, it felt satisfying.      As dreams do suddenly time passed and we were all sitting around on the bed fully clothed and everyone was involved in their own conversations.  The nameless girl was looking at me and flirting with me with her eyes.  But this was different.  The sex was physical and this was chemistry.  I noticed for the first time here that she looked like Liv Tyler only prettier.  she moved toward me and we started kissing.  It was amazing.  There was tongue and I was really loving it. on the lips, in her mouth. I recorded it in a more poetic fashion ; )   We gasped for each other.  I kept thinking I was going to mess up or miss and while it wasn't perfect, it just flowed. I noticed also that my eyes were closed the whole time and normally I open them from time to time in real life.  It's like there was a confidence and relaxation that isn't usually there. At the end we both turned our heads the wrong way and our nosed touched, but it was nice.  We must have been in the zone because we looked up and everyone was watching us. They looked like friends who have been trying to get two people together and finally see it happening, like they knew something we didn't know.   Or maybe even where surprised but pleasantly so. Then someone asked her "How was it? was it good?" and she didn't really look giddy so much as dazed and content, I think we were both kind of floating.  Finally she said with emphasis and a smile "Ba-ka!" but I knew it meant.."it was fantastic".        And for a change this dream actually had closure and ended at a logical place and flowed instead of skipping around like an ADD kid channel surfing. These dreams like this started after I lost my computer...for more on that see my other question:    "I remember my dreams now, any theories?"      So...weird dream eh?

Not only does it make me stressed out when I see him, but also when I don't see him and think about him. Its not a good kind of stress. It's whether I like him back or not. I think it might be some kind of phobia, but it seems like no matter how much I'm around the guy it never gets better. Then the guy gets my awkward vibes and he feels awkward too. Any suggestions? I have barely been able to eat for a week because of this guy who likes me but who I only like as a friend.
