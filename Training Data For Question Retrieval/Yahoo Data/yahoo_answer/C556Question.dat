Can someone explain to me how a groin strain can result from this? Also, now the pain traveled down to my right testicle, my worry is that can it cause testicular torsion? Should i worry about it or is it just a groin strain? Has this happen to anyone before?

Well, I'm sixteen and I'm quite worried about my periods.   The order I've had my periods are   started   -May 2006 (i was 13)   next one,   -July 2007   next one,    -October 2007   Very very light, 2 days    next,   -January 2008   Again, very very light.   after that,   -April 2008   Then my last one was September 2008.      Over the course of almost 3 years, i should have had around 34, and instead i have had 6.   I'm sorry to be so graphic with my details but it does worry me, especially when all my friends don't seem to have any problems.   I have been to the doctor about it twice, but both times they were quite flippant about it and just told me they would regulate after my first child.   Of course, having such irregular periods is thoroughly inconvenient, and being a natural worrier I do blow things out of proportion.   But i would please like other female viewpoints or experiences please, just to solve something or set my mind at rest.   Thankyou   :)

20090308033848AAoXg8b	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Can you still get epilepsy at the age of 21?	I have had problems with a certain twitch for the last few years. It hasn't really bothered me for a couple years, and it is not too frequent nowadays unless I get stressed or am tired or something. However, also if I am stressed or tired, I have (over the last couple years) developed a quick shake. It is more like a quick jolt through my body, but since I have come overseas for this semester (so, for about the last 2 months), these shakes have gone from quick jolts to full body shaking. Like, my arms and head and everything will just start shaking. And like, I will not be able to stop it for a few seconds at least. Over the last couple of days, it has been worse than ever. It has made me concerned that maybe I have some early stages of epilepsy showing, because I don't know what other conditions involve full body shaking. I am 21. Is it possible to only start seeing symptoms of epilepsy at 21? Or should I look down other paths to figure out what this could be?      Also, I am signed up to go SCUBA diving in a couple weeks. They asked if I had had problems with convulsions, and I said no. Would these classify? Plus, I am taking malaria pills at the moment. Do you think those could possibly have a hand in intensifying these shakes?      I know that's a lot of questions, but I am a little worried, and my good friend is practically begging me to go see a doctor, because she has noticed them escalating since she's known me.

It took ages to diagnose me and they diagnosed me with things like IBS, crohns disease and coeliacs disease before they even got to lactose intollerance.    My stomach improved once I stopped eating dairy but I have continued to have painful stomach pains and diarrhea almost every day.   I have been using herbal tablets in order to eat dairy as in England we don't have prescription dairy free pills. They work like a charm and last week I stopped using them and didn't eat dairy at all for the whole week. I still had diarrhea and stomach pains so I'm wondering whether I do actually have lactose intolerance. I'm planning to go back to my doctor for help on the situation but I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar experience?

I just bought a pitbull puppy today at 6:00 p.m but she hasn't eaten or drank anything and it is now 3:45 a.m.  She has diarrhea which I know is normal for a puppy, but she has also been vomiting.  She has thrown up 3 times since I have had her.  I have tried putting puppy food in front of her face and putting it in her mouth but she isnt eating it, just spitting it back out.  I also put water in a bottle for her and put it into her mouth but she just turns away no matter what.  Also she is very hot right now, but i am not sure if its because she is wrapped up in a shirt and has a blanket over her, but i dont know if she should be this hot.  I dont want to get overly worked up about it but i also dont want to do nothing and watch my new dog die.  If she doesnt drink of eat anything within the next few hours then i am probably going to start freaking out.  What should i do?  I am getting nervous.       I know that the person i bought her from is my friend's cousin.  I am not sure he took very good care of her, because when she threw up it looked like it was chunks of chicken and lettuce, items commonly found in asian soups (the guy is filipino.)  My friend told me he doesnt know what she was fed or anything but gave me some suggestions.  He didnt get her any of her vaccinations yet, but i think that is due to the fact that she is about 6 weeks old.  Please help me.

When taking the arm down again it stings like hell for a moment. I tried holding my shoulder down while moving my arm up is far as possible and that does not hurt. The pain start exactly when the shoulder starts to lift. So I guess it has nothing to do with the rotator cuff. But what else could this be.   I don't know what started this other than I started carriyng a heavy bag but that was on the other shoulder. I do no that it startet in a day or two but no trauma.      Anyone had this?

20090308045438AAtpljq	Health;Mental Health	Did I Just Give Up Or Did  I Need A Rest?	I was a fat unhappy kid in middle school and high school. I hated life, didn't want to go to school but my parents scared me enough that I got good grades and stayed out of trouble. All I did in high school and middle school was study.      I got to college, dropped the fifty pounds in the first few months of college. I struggled with my grades all four years. Probably cause I was so terrified of being fat again I over exercised and under ate. I never partied, drank, or had a girlfriend during college. In the summers all I did was work for my parents at their store. I never had any fun ever, never hung out with friend or partied etc.       My grades sucked all four years. But by my junior year I kicked it into high gear and ended up basically doing my major in one year. I graduated from college with a b average, lost fifty pounds, was in great shape. I would never believe in a million years I would have graduated from college.       I came back home and basically just didn't give a crap for a year and a half. I wanted to be a Marine after I graduated. I no longer was that driven to do that. I basically worked out, did martial arts, partied with friends and that was it.       Do you think the last year and half of doing nothing.  Not really a year and half, I work very hard from the spring to the early fall for my parents but I would say a year of no direction in life.

My mom says she is going to bring me to work with her (she works at the hospital) to get an x-ray done. I had pneumonia before when i was 4 years old. What do you think it is...?

20090308053335AAZrsZl	Health;Other - Health	Night shift- Have there been any long term studies?	Ok, I work 7:40pm-5:40am (nights). After engaging into a long conversation on working the night shift, my girlfriend pulled a study about the night shift.  The study involved a couple people working normal 9-5's and put them in a building with no windows and no clocks to work for 10 days.  The study showed that the ones that worked the night shift developed higher blood pressure and low blood sugar.  I argued that these people weren't used to that schedule and that they must be on a long term regime to show normal signs.  I was wondering if any of you maybe have read any studies or have any links to studies that prove (or disprove) either of these theories?  I'm thinking that if you treat the night shift identical to a day shift, consistently, for a few years, that you'll be just as healthy and have the same chances of having a heart-attack, developing cancer, etc, etc.

20090308060013AAWkxe8	Health;Men's Health	I woke up this morning to find his semen (sperm) all over me .... what should I do?	This has been happening fora while now. I fall asleep spooning with my husband and when I awake in the morning my panties, back, and legs are completely soaked with his semen, and it makes me feel really really disgusting. I caught him in the act several times and when I ask him about it he lies and says, "I didn't do that" when I know he did. This morning we got in a little argument over it because it was so much and felt so nasty and all he could say was, "I didn't now it was coming I tried to move, I was horny", but in my mind he shouldn't have done it in the first place. All he has to do is wake me up if he is that aroused. He is my husband and I love him with all my heart, but that's just disgusting to wake up all sticky and wet because he can't control his self.       What should I do to get him to stop? At first he didn't do is as much, but now he does it at least 3 to 4 times a week some times more. I don't feel that I should have to compromise, he should just get it under control!    Please help, and thanks for the advise.
20090307222148AA85Cws	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	My knee feels ' weird '.?	Okay,so I'm a very active person. And I expect to have some troubles but today,my knee started feeling weird. I went to work this morning. After working for like 6 hours,I decided to work out. I ran a mile (after stretching) and then played basketball for about an hour I guess. Not too unusual for my saturday. Anyway, about 30 minutes after I finished playing ball my knee started feeling weird. And it still does,it's been about 4 hours. My right knee feels really stiff. And it feels like there's 'air' trapped all around it. It's sort of like a cramp but it doesn't really hurt. I did land on it a little awkward but thought nothing of it since there was no pain. I've since iced it and took ibuprofen. Should that,along with rest,clear it up or could it be more serious?      Thanks in advance for your help and if you need more details I'll try to help.
20090308062336AARAXI0	Health;Men's Health	He never wants to see me again?!?	Carl – is a friend, but he ‘likes’ me as more than that, he is seriously the nicest lad I have ever met, but I want to keep it friends, I’m not physically attracted, just love him. Because he likes me as more than a friend he’s really defensive over me and boys..      Aaron – a guy I am semi-seeing, not known him for long.. about 4weeks. He’s nice, but nothing special.      So, Friday night I had sex with Aaron after a party, Carl found out on Saturday, and said he doesn’t think he wants to see me again, cause I have really hurt him, etc.    “people like me try and try for nice girls like you and then you get some random d!ckhead come along and just *** you, what the ***, you have honestly hurt me”   I have told him how disappointed I feel for upsetting him, he’s so close, and I don’t want to lose him as a friend. Now he says its Aarons fault, because he knows Aarons type.   I don’t know what to do? I feel so bad for letting Carl down, but Carl doesn’t own me, I don’t want to lose this friendship with him, he’s so lovely.   And will & Danny called saying how I have just fuked Carl off, how could I, he’s so nice... Etc.    I don’t know what to do? Carl is putting himself down for this, saying its always the same, is there anything I can do?      :S I asked under this category cause its mainly men btw.

20090307231544AAhqIgS	Health;Women's Health	Why can't I get turned on by porn?	I have never liked porn since I becae sexual (and even before.) I got more turned on imagining myself with my partner then watching other people. And now even with a kid and married with my husband-i've tried back to looking at porn to try to get turned on or something b/c I know so many other people out there who do. Weather it's so simple or extremely vulger I just don't like it-but nothing else I do (masterbating or anythying) gets me turned on. I even tried to record me and my husband having sex and watched, and instead I couldn't even watch it all. If I do watch any porn, the only thing I can stand to watch is one male and one female together. But I dont' like watching 2 girls or 2 guys (I'm not bi nor do I have a problem with bi or gay people-I've even been kissed by a girl but was not turned on nor did I want to touch her)   I've never had an orgasm and wondering if maybe that's the cause-and I can't stand to use sex toys or vibrators and as I said, I extremely hate masterbating. I enjoy it so much more being with my husband or letting him do something to me OR simply thinking about it but once I touch my own body, I guess it's like pulling me back that its just me-I can't keep my mind on it and imagine someone else touching me. And I've tried all kind of things (including all these ) for years thinking I just needed practice. I don't think of myself as ugly or being low with sex b/c I can get just as horney (my husband says more then any other woman he has ever been with) as anyone else.   You can even see my pic on myspace.com/sweetlove07  to proove that I'm not an ugly person.      So what do I do? How can I get turned on by porn and enjoy myself without being grossed out or feeling dirty myself?

20090308050759AAj87mx	Health;Alternative Medicine	Can you effectively treat a Candida Cleanse/Treat Toenail Fungus if you're also on antidepressants?	I have started on a Candida Cleanse which includes a strict diet, taking oregano oil as an antifungals and taking probiotics. As well I am doing a daily treatment for my toenail fungus (topically and internally).        My doctor has prescribed me an antidepressant (Celexa) as I am also quite clinically depressed but I am worried if I take it it would counteract the work I am doing with the antifungals. Treating my toenail fungus is a long process (could be for months up to a year).  I would like to do both, however I wouldn't want to if it meant that all the  time, effort and $ spent treating the candida and my toenails would be wasted.       For those who may say ask a pharmacist - I ready have and from their perspective they say it shouldn't effect the antidepressant.  However, I am now interested in hearing from those on the other side (natural health professionals and those educated in such) to see if the antidepressant would feed the yeast or make the antifungal work less effective.  'Regular' health professionals often seem to think that candida overgrowth may not be an issue or that herbs have no effect, whereas natural health care professionals seem to take things such as candida overgrowth more seriously.        So, any opinions from natural health professionals and those educated in the field would be much appreciated.      And please, no spam!  Thank you

20090308064845AAKAqEB	Health;Mental Health	What should I do about my anxiety?	I get really nervous in social situations, go bright red and sometimes have panic attacks and just can't say anything. I'm not exactly pretty looking so people don't really go out of their way to talk to me, and if I try to talk to other people then I end up just making an idiot of myself by not being able to say anything, so I look really dumb when I can have really interesting conversations with people when they're in my head (the conversations, not the people). This makes people avoid me and think I'm weird, which I can't really blame them for.   This has resulted in me having no friends. I'm not joking, the only person I've even spoken more than one sentence to in the last 2 years has been my mum, and she has enough to worry about without worrying about me.   There is a free counselling service at my college, there was a notice with a room number that I saw so I went to check it out. I have to spend a long time thinking through any conversation before I have it but the counsellor suprised me by opening the door and asking me if I was looking for her, which threw me and I made a fool of myself and basically ended up running away, so I can't go back. Besides which, my mum is really against any counselling or mental therapy whatsoever; she doesn't think mental disorders exist and thinks people who go to them are pathetic and self indulgent.   Anyway, even if I did go I don't know what I'd say and I have a fear they'd just laugh at me, and I know I'd just keep thinking 'they're just doing this for the money and they think I'm some sad loser who can't make friends.'   But I have to do something because I've been having really bad thoughts lately and I can't live my life like this forever, so I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions...

What is HPV & more importantly is there a way to do a blood test? if so and the results are negative do you still need to have a pap smear? i've been sexually active for 7 years although i have never had a pap smear because i've been too embarrassed. I know the doctors are used to it but i can't really change the way i feel so i'm hoping there is a way to get around it. Since cervical cancer is linked to hpv is there a way i can test that i have or have ever had hpv (once again) . Thanks in advance...if someone could also answer what a lesion in the cervix may mean that would help too ..

And for the past 4 days I have been getting a very sharp pain on the right side of my head, above my ear. It only lasts for up to a minute, but its unbearable pain. It comes and goes.  It almost feels like there is a knife or something sharp going through my head. It takes my beathe away and everything goes blank while it happens, then I get weak.. Its not on the outside of my head, it actually feels like something sharp in going through my brain. Could I possibly have a muscle spasm under my shoulder blade and its causing that? The pain from my shoulder blade travels up to my neck. Anyone have any idea what this could be?

20090307160926AAaPBr4	Health;Alternative Medicine	Is this just a sign of shock?	Last night my friend and I were in a bad accident. She swerved to miss a horseback rider on a narrow bridge (in the dark) and we hit a patch of ice. We were going 55 mph as we slid to the right....we nicked the guard rail before she over corrected and we did a complete 360 and spun to the other side of the freeway and smashed into the guard rail on the opposite side before coming to a stop in the middle of the road. We were both terrified of course, but after a moment I started to hyperventilate, then my entire body went tingy....like when your foot falls asleep only it was from my head to my toes and it was the strangest feeling....it went away after a while, but I was worried that the tingly reaction was caused by damage to my spinal cord, but my mom thinks it was just a sign of shock....we're both okay but sore of course....my neck hurts pretty bad but I think it was just whiplash, so we haven't been to the doctor. We're thinking about going today to get checked out, but was the tingling in my body just a sign of shock, or did something happen to my spine?   Thanks!      (Oh and we were both wearing our seat belts, but the force of sliding 55 mph into the guardrail was enough to make my friend's glasses fly off her head and into the back window!)

20090227141400AAHvrWw	Health;Women's Health	PLEASE HELP ME WOMEN OUT THERE; BIRTH CONTROL EXPERTS??!!?	I have three questions!! :)      I'm 15 years old.   I've been on Loestrin24Fe for one month exactly.. (yesterday)   Today i started Yaz.   Because my acne had gotten worse on Loestrin24Fe.   I started Loestrin24Fe on a friday, Day 1 start.   My gyn said i should be receiving my period on the last reminder pill of the pack Loestrin24Fe.    The end of the 3rd week of being on Loestrin24Fe, i had been experiencing breakthrough bleeding, i think because i was on antibiotics.   Rather than getting my period on the last reminder pill, i got it on the first reminder pill..   My period only lasted from monday to wednesday, it was heaviest on tuesday.   Thursday i had very light, more brownish-barely there.   And today, Friday, I have no bleeding whatsoever.   1)) Is that a bad thing to happen?! Is something wrong?!      Today i started Yaz at 11:00am. The usual time i took Loestrin24Fe.   But i was not bleeding.   Strangely enough though, i suffered from an ovulation cramp.   Or so it felt that way to me, there's a difference between period cramps and ovulation cramps.   I had a very bad headache as well.   2)) This couldn't be the Yaz reacting already could it?! Or is it the Loestrin24Fe?! Or what?!      And last but not least;;   Since i switched today, and i was not bleeding when started my new BCP.. am i still protected against pregnancy? If not, how long will I be until i am considered protected? The usual 7 days?      THANKS SO MUCH :)

If you need more info just ask, also if you can't let me know how many i should be in taking, should i just eat until i'm not hungry anymore each meal as a rule of thumb?

My parents were bodybuilders in their previous years, so there's a full gym at their house.  I dont like going to the gym, because I prefer to work out more at my leisure, but now that I've moved out of their house into my own place, I dont have my own gym at home anymore.  They live 45 minutes away, so I dont want to drive to their house to use their equipment either.      Basically my question is what is the best at home gym I can purchase, for less than $800 or so, to take up to least space.  I've seen so many infomercials for hundreds of minigyms, so I know they're out on the market.      I try to have an average but large build from the gym.  I dont want the real thin lean muscle, but I dont want to be any Hulk either.  I want the muscle to be noticeable, but there's no need for huge high resistance machines.  Right now I weigh around 200 lbs and bench 300lbs 8 times free weight... to put things into perspective on what I'm looking to be able to achieve.

As I have tried to work through it with a therapist other big traumas have reappeared which I now have to try and deal with.  Unfortunately my therapist has been ill and now she is better has decided to stop working and hopefully enjoy a life of leisure.  I am crushed by this because I had began opening up to her more and more and now I don't know what I am going to do.  Where to go or who to talk to?      I have a care worker, who unfortunately is also off work at the moment recovering from a broken foot, so I don't have her to talk to.  I suffer from severe anxiety and the thought of having to start therapy with someone new is absolutely petrifying to me, especially with the the traumas I have to deal with.  They are not easy to have the flashbacks let alone try to put them into words to a stranger.      I am missing my partner so much the pain is killing me inside.  I can't remember our good memories as they are blocked by the trauma of finding him and the traumas from earlier in my life.  I feel he would be really disappointed in me and very angry at the way I am.      I feel like an emotional wreck.  I am so choked up I can hardly talk.      How do you keep going when you feel like all hope is gone?      I know there are people out there who are a lot worse off than I am and I truly feel for them too.  Life is very unfair.

There are times that I vomit and then pain gone and I'm okay but most of the time it doesn't help (the pain is strong and usually makes me vomit) I plan on scheduling an appointment this monday but I was just wondering if anyone might know what this is or maybe some ideas on how to ease the pain, it's 8am and i still haven't been able to sleep. The pain is going away but I have a 4 month old that will be up soon and the sleepless nights are starting to take their toll.   49 minutes ago - 4 days left to answer.    Additional Details   I had a c-section almost 5 months ago. The pains started about 4 weeks after the c-section. Idk if it has anything to do with it or not.   48 minutes ago      I thought about going to the emergancy room, I went 2 months ago and sat there for 9 hours just for them to give me tylenol. Plus I have a 4 month old and I'm watching my brothers which includes a 6 month old, my parents left to chicago last night due to a family emergency

20090227135926AA3l9A2	Health;Women's Health	Has anyone else had this irregular menstrual cycle?	I am 3 days late for my period. I took a home pregnancy test this morning and it was negative. (The one that says you can test 5 days before your missed period, so since I took it 3 days AFTER my missed period, I assume its accurate.) I am typically on schedule, I even use an online period tracker to help me out. However, last month I was 2 days early.  Last September, I was 6 days late. Could this just be my cycle being irregular, or could there be an underlying problem? I plan on testing again tomorrow just to try to definitely rule out pregnancy. Also, the last couple days it has felt like my period was about to start. And not to give too much information, but the discharge I am getting right now smells like what menstruation would smell like, but its not at all red.  I am sexually active, but ALWAYS use a condom. (I am not on any form of hormonal birth control) Anyone have any insight?

They started a few months back. Occasionally I would have a few rapid beats that I could feel in my chest. I am a smoker and use caffeine so I didn't think much of it. They are happening daily now. I feel them mostly in my throat. It's like a bubble at the base of my throat and butterflies dancing around in there. All the research I've done has said it's probably normal and nothing to worry about. It's extremely bothersome nonetheless. In the last week they have gotten more frequent and now exhaustion has set in. I am tired enough to sleep all day which is not like me. I don't normally nap and am an early riser. I have no reason to be tired like this. I am eating normally and my routine and stress levels are normal. I am really getting concerned. I am only 31. I have never seen a cardiologist for myself before. My daughter has a cardio doc for her heart defect as well as my son. I have always had normal ranges for blood pressure and pulse. This is all new to me and am starting to panic. Any advice here would help. Thanks so much!!!!

20090308060732AAd5iT6	Health;Mental Health	I don't feel like myself anymore, am i depressed or something? (long)?	I'm 19 and I just feel like i dont know myself anymore. I'm sorry this is so long...      I have always been a lively happy person with a lot of common sense, until a couple months ago I was dumped by someone i thought was the love of my life who i had been with for 3 years. Since then my life has become such a mess. At the end of the relationship I was called "insane", "cruel" and a lot of things before being rejected by him and ignored for weeks. This led me to feel completely worthless so i secretly started cutting to cope with the pain.   I got this under control quickly when I started to like someone else. I thought i had moved on (I realize now that it was just an illusion, the new guy was a distraction from pain more than anything. )      Over the last 2 months I've been alternating between eating loads and starving myself. I've dropped to bmi 16.8 (gross).   The next thing that has cropped up is I'm going out more and drinking more, to the point of having blackouts and doing embarrassing things i dont remember.      My point is... I've never had any of these problems before. This isnt me! I dont know what to do. My ex made contact last week because he noticed by weight loss and saw me out one night really drunk, he was worried about me.   Also, the new guy: we've kissed a complete times (both under the influence). I do like him but I think it'd be really unfair to start something with him, as I clearly have too much emotional baggage right now. Still, cant stop kissing him when i drink!      I have a couple friends i tell all of this to, but they're just sick of hearing me complain by now (I'm sure you are you :) )   Anyways, I just want to feel like me again and be happy!    any thoughts on how to heal from all this? thanks

I recently told my doctor about it and he put me on Prozac, which didn't do anything to help, so then he put my dose up to 60mg and it's still not helping. Since taking these pills I can't sleep, I can't sit or lie still, I can't concentrate, and I've lost all interest in socialising and in my sexuality.      I also think I may be bipolar, because every few weeks or so I just get this crazy unexplainable high that lasts about 24 hours, and I feel like I can do anything, and I don't want to sleep or eat, and I feel like God put a ball of joy in my heart that I have to go and share with everyone, and like all the problems in the world aren't real. But I don't know how to tell my doctor this. Anyone got any advice?

20090308070413AAnXAcY	Health;Other - Health	How do you deal with a rude/judgemental hospital staff?	I won't stop b9tching until I learn about some SATISFYING ways of dealing with these people. Just ignoring it or trying to make the world a better place doesn't cut it, because these aholes annoy me, and I in no shape way or form am going to stand for it,      PERIOD.         For example, whenever I land in the ER due to a bad illness, I usually complain about it alot, or tell them exactly what's wrong, and they basically just "Judge" my behavior/attitude, how old I am, like all the shallow stuff they see, and focus more on my mental health/attitude, how I'm overblowing it, and treat me like I'm some sort of a crazy person.        They expect you to be this good little patient, who fits into society's perfect mold, if you're an adult male you should be doing this and that, if you're a female of the same age, where are your children?  and if you're not like me, I tend to be an individual, free-spirited, I just don't give a f8ck person..then they just judge you, and you're the enemy.      Last night I had a really bad anxiety/panic attack, so I had to go into the ER, and the paramedics who brought me there were first acting all nice to me, but just because I was in a bad mood, and wasn't all happy/gleeful like they were, they picked up on that and immediately just got defensive around me, like I was the bad guy.       I even tried to start small talk like "hi so is this your job, how do you like it, we're happy to have you guys, etc" but the response I got back was like...yep and no answers and they just looked annoyed.      When they checked me out they were like "ok ur totally normal, but your anxiety/panic is out of control and its affecting your behavior, so you need to talk to a counselor," and I said I already know that, and it's nothing personal I just freak out when I'm sick or dealing with something, why can't you people understand that? lol. Is it so abnormal? I don't care of my age,..that's ageism, I dont' care if I'm a guy, that's sexism, I'm allowed to act any d@mn way I please as long as it's legal,and there's NOTHING illegal about being in a friggin bad mood.       The people at the hospital, with all the questioning got SO judgemental and just weird. It's like they go into details, like why didn't you do this, why do you have this gap in your work experience, and all these personal judgemental questions, like they're your mother and father, and then they insert their own judgements like "Have you ever hit a dog, etc because I can't stand people that do," and and I'm like wow, well If I don't come across like your perfect little patient, you're going to treat me negatively, so whatever.      I just feel like they judge you, and expect you to be this perfect little conformist sheep that's got it all together and is leading a really great life, solid job history, solid everything, and since I'm not like that and I don't have a perfect track record,       I automatically get treated condescendingly and like I'm some sort of a crazy person.      Even on her way out, this nurse who looked anoyed with me said sarcastically and a bit angry, "good luck to you...." and walked away.      I really doubt if these people were hiring anywhere, that I'd even remotely stand a chance.            I can't stand them, and I'm not one of those phony people who pretend that it's all good man!  So how do you deal with them?      I'm NOT changing.  I like how I am.

20090308075817AA9oyeQ	Health;Dental	What's this layer of stuff on my teeth that the dentist said isn't plague?	I've been having this layer of white stuff around the um, near the roots of my top teeth; it doesn't even cover one fifth of the tooth. They've been there for years. They're whiter than my teeth, which, isn't very yellow, and probably is as white as the human teeth can get without dental whitening. I can't get rid of them, no matter how I brush. When I paid a visit to the school dentist, she said it was not plague and can never be removed. She didn't tell me what it was and just said that nothing could be done. Does anyone know what it is?

20090308073007AA8aWf6	Health;Mental Health	Porn Addictions - How much is too much?	For the first year I was with my fiance, I never had walked in on him looking at porn, and had never noticed an excess amount of it on his computer.  After that though, I started noticing HUNDREDS of links and pictures saved in his bookmarks.  He started looking at it sometimes when I would just be in the other room, and I started picking up on this.  It happened several times a day for over two years.  I'd go down to make us breakfast, and then come up and walk into the room to find him rushing to tuck his dick back into his pants and get the porn off the screen.  Then, we got engaged and it was all deleted from his bookmarks and for a week or so I never ran into this issue.  It is now back, he has the pages saved in his facebook- he sends them to himself in messages.  We'll watch a movie late at night and then once I fall asleep he'll go on his computer and look at it, or he'll get up early in the morning while I'm still sleeping.  I'm a really light sleeper though and whenever I wake up and start doing things when he does this he just flips out about why I'm awake.  I've tried to confront him on these things, he just doesn't listen.  I have told him many times that I could care less if he wants to do that while I am at work or if we are away from each other for a few days, but when I am in the other room it really makes me feel horrible and does a number on my self esteem.  We barely ever have sex, we used to have it 5 days a week and now we have it once every week - sometimes only once every two weeks... yet he jerks off daily, even if it means I have to be in the other room.        How do I deal with this?  How do I get his attention to talk about this?  Am I exaggerating the issue??

20090308065411AABdKJC	Health;Diet & Fitness	Is my friend making a mistake by getting Hydroxycut?	I have a bulky friend that just turned 18 who is about 200lbs, works out a lot, eats healthy most of the time, and still thinks he's fat. He wants me to order him Hydroxycut so he can be thin. Personally, I don't think it's a good idea because of all the side affects:      -High Blood Pressure   -Increased Heart Rate   -Dizziness   -Loss of Appetite      I'm afraid he might have a heart attack because even though he works out a lot and eats right, he still gets out of breath when he exercises. The increased heart rate and blood pressure while exercising could be fatal and I don't want that to happen. I told him I don't think he should get it. But he still wants to because he's so desperate to lose weight. I'm also 18 and heavier than he is. I should be the one considering taking Hydroxycut. But he doesn't even look fat and he still wants to take it.      Should he get the Hydroxycut or is it a bad idea and he should just stick to exercising and eating right? Please help! Detailed answers please.

I try to go to the gym but its a hike for me, I have to ride my bike about 4.5mi. to get there. I go for an hour and my mom picks me up afterwords. I'm going to try to go fo 4 days a week. I have to go for football, but I don't know if I want to play again this year. (DT)      I sick of my brothers picking on me. I tend to over-react, because I don't want to fight back. They mostly make fun of me for my weight. My older brother now 19 has always put me down, ever since I can remember.       Here's a big one, my love life/relationship status. I know I'm only 16 but wherever I look in school everyone has a girlfriend/boyfriend. Other then being a big boy, I don't think I could hold a relationship because I guess I'm boring. I have nothing to talk about with girls. And the girls I have had a crush on know it, because I kind of give it away by looking them. I neep help with that.      School work, my grades are half-decent but they can be better. US History seems to be my strong suit, Geometry/Math not so much. World language i'm not taking next year.      My friends are good ones, but they bust on me allot. It's okay once in a while, I even laugh with them, but sometimes they'll take it to far, whats a kid to do? They will also bust on me in front of a girl I like.      Personal Habbits, I tend to over eat allot, but I have to stop, if I'm going to stick with the gym/ I spend to much time on the computer, checking myspace/facebook and sometimes.......porn.

20090308073635AA5YEwN	Health;Diet & Fitness	Bodybuilding plan for me please?	Okay, so I'm 18 and I lost a lot of weight, I went from 150 pounds to 130 pounds in three months, but now I stopped my diet and I gained like 8 or 9 pounds back so I'm like 138 lb, and my height is 5'3. Anyway, I will do more diet again till school ends (June), I'm planning to go down to about 120 or something like that. Anyway, after that I wanna gain MUSCLE pounds, like work out and gain muscle mass and not fat. I'll be working out (Weight lifting) every week day from 3 to 5, I'd do some running in the running machine and do walking from 6 to 7.... My plan again is going to last for the entire summer (From June to Late August). But I'm totally new to this bodybuilding and weight lifting thing, so I really need help with it please. I'm taking weight lifting class now but the couch isn't helpful at all, but this is what I'm doing now:      Upper body:   Standing Dumbbell curls. (15 lbs/20 reps/5 sets).   V-bars Pull Downs machine. (2 lbs/20 reps/5 sets).   Push Press machine. (7 lbs/20 reps/5 sets).   Peck Deck. (30 lbs/20 reps/5 sets).   Shoulder Lift machine. (5 lbs/20 reps/5 sets).   Stationary Bench workout. (20 lbs long with the weight of the thing you're lifting long with the weights/20 reps/3 sets).      I wanted to do the flat bench lifting thing where you lay on a flat bench and lift weights for like 8-12 times because I know it's very affevtive, but I can't do it with weights, it's just too heavy for me, so I lifted the stick which WAS actually heavy for like 12 times just to try it out but I REALLY wanna consider it during summer, like I wanna do some flat bench work outs too. (I need advice on this workout too, how to start, how much weight to start with/move on).          Lower body:   Leg Press. (190 lbs/20 reps/5 sets).   Leg Extension. (50 lbs/20 reps/5 sets).   Seated Calf Raise. (50 lbs/20 reps/5 sets).      I'm not sure if I'm lifting the right amount of weights for me to get muscles. Usually, I lift those things not easily but they're not hard for me for the first 10 reps, from 10-15 it becomes a lot harder, from 15-17 very challanging, 17-20 it's just me dragging myself to get out there because it's like too hard! I do increase weights gradually, I usually go up 1 lb every couple weeks in the machines, and move on about 10 lbs every 2 weeks for freeworks, except for the Dumbbell Curls thingy, I'm still struggling with 15.... But please give me advice on how much weights should I move on in order for me to get MUSCLES, and if there is any other important workout for muscles building that I need, please advice me about too...         - When I used to work out on my diet, I got some small muscles but it wasn't a very fast/good growth. For the past months and now that I'm eating better, I can see more dramatic change. But now I will go back to diet just to shape myself up and I will quit it anyway before I get to my REAL bodybuilding plan because I REALLY wanna focus on one thing per a while.       Now the next thing I need help with is my eating schedule for summer, and my protien intake, I'm thinking about this:      Breakfast:      - Scrambled egg.   - Bread.   - Milk. (It has about 10 g of protien).      Snack:   - Apple.      Another Snack:   - Any protien bar.      Dinner:   - Two pieces of steak/ or 3 pieces of 6 oz chicken breasts.   - Rice.      Or I could have pasta for dinner.         Late supper:   - Two tablespoons of Peanutbutter and loaf.         Please tell me what you think about this eating plan and how much protien you think I should get...         Thank you SOO much for your time!

I've also used Biomedics and Vertex in the past, but can't remember if they had the same issue. All i remember is that they got dry towards the end of the day which is something i can live with as long as i get rid of this shifting and blurriness.

20090308074124AAOuUVB	Health;Mental Health	My parents disagree and I don't know whose advice to take.?	I've been having minor nervous breakdown recently.  I've had breakdowns before and this isn't as bad as those but it's still affecting my ability to function normally.  My parents have been amazing.  I'm in debt and three separate organisations have treated me unfairly.  I need to sue one of them, and be firm with the two others because I am in the right in this case.  My Dad is traveliing to be with me and help me to do this.  Meanwhile my Mam has offered to loan me the money so that I can get it sorted out straight away.  She's also offered me a place at her house so I don't have to pay rent so that I can quit my job because she is desperate for me to have a rest.  I am a writer on the side and I have had a lot of professional encouragement from those higher up than me who have seen my potential.  My Mam wants me to leave my job in admin and follow my dreams - using her money!     I'm really grateful for my Mam's offer but I'm 22 and don't feel I can behave that way at my age.  Surely it should be up to me to get out of my mess and find a way to follow my dreams?  My Dad has told me not to take any sick leave and carry on working in my job.  He has also told me to forget about my dreams until I'm well enough to handle the basics of life.     I agree with both of them in different ways.  I know my friends would take my Mam's offer.  But I can't bear to be so irresponsible.  I just feel too old to be relying on my parents like this.  And I don't want them to dig me out.  There support is welcome but I should be made to do this myself.  So I keep thinking I'll go with what my Dad said.  However, my Mam keeps telling me that to do that would be irresponsible in itself because I'm so unhappy.  She says that if I don't change my life I'll keep having breakdowns.  And I should be following what makes me truly happy - writing.     I'm so confused.  I just want to do what's right.  And it's such a difficult situation I can't tell what's up and what's down.  Can anybody help?  What would you do in my situation?  Would you quit the job and take a rest and maybe try to follow your dream?  Or you would you stay with the job so that you have a chance of getting a bank loan to pay off your debts and forget about your dreams until your mental health is stable?

I know i have put weight on, but i have also put the weight gain down to my boobs getting bigger (they arent light!)  i would appreciate any advice, thanks.

Started on amoxicillin the next day. The following Wednesday 3/4 said his throat hurt again. I took him back to the dr and strep swab was negative. But changed his antibiotic to penicillin with potassium. Dr said he has a cold and the coughing is irritating his throat. The very next night he started running a 103 fever so I took him back to the dr friday 3/6 and they did blood work and everything was perfectly normal and they said he has bronchitis. Tomorrow is his last day of antibiotic but he is still running fever. Is that normal with bronchitis? I'm planning on taking him back to the dr tomorrow but in the mean time I'm considering taking him to the er. When i give him meds it goes down to about 101. Im alternating motrin and tylenol.
