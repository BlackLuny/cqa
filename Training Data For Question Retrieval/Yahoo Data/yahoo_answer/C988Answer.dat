I'm also partial to the Citizen/Soldier paint scheme that Jr ran in the All-Star race in 2008- and I hate Junior.<br>  <br>  I really can't pick a specific paint scheme and say it's the best.

osPstl3jaa	Don't be suprised if he gets it on with Vernon Forrest a third time. After Forrest regained his title from Sergio Mora, he said he wants a crack at Mayorga again. He claims Mayorga beat him twice because of his shoulder troubles. He is healthy now so it would be neat to see.|`|NSgSaspAaa	Mayorga is a crazy guy, but fun to watch. I actually think he would have knocked Angulo out.<br>  <br>  Angulo is tough, aggressive, and accurate...but he takes too many punches and Mayorga is not someone that you want to take punches from over and over.|`|I1w0HfQbaa	I too enjoy a good Mayorga fight. His fight with Fernando Vargas was great and a good final sendoff for Vargas' career. It was down to the wire coming into the eleventh round until five seconds remaining Mayorga decks Vargs again and knocks him down to win a majority decision. The problem is this is the second cancellation of Mayorga and given his track record of pulling out of fights for little reason promoters can not trust him on his word. At age 35 and this is another Mayorga cancellation and coming off a seventh pro defeat at the hands of Shane Mosley in September my guess is retirement.|`|I9Y6fxguaa	Mayorga will always be a big stepping stone for upcoming stars. <br>  Once the money runs down he will be back for more. <br>  People like to see him fight and run his mouth.
LIKkt8djaa	Yeah actually you'll be fine, I ride with an ipod all the time, The tunes really help get you in the mood to push it. Most jackets now a days have a media pocket which keeps it in a relatively safe position on the body. Another thing you can do if you're still worrying about it is get some ipod armor for it, theirs tons of choices. Here's one I found.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.otterbox.com/ipod-touch/ipod-touch-armor-case/" rel="nofollow">http://www.otterbox.com/ipod-touch/ipod-...</a>|`|SohrsIBoaa	battery life might cut short if its really cold out, other then that, put it in your jacket pocket and youll be fine.|`|YNVevUBuaa	If you have a inside pocket that will keep it dry and is in a place that if you fall you won't land right on it it might make it.  I ride with my iPod classic all the time and it does ok but if I leave it in an outside pocket it gets cold and the battery dies faster than usual.|`|jTaW3goeaa	Not safe at all.  Easy to fall on it and trash it.  Those things aren't even designed to take the beating of sports.  It will work fine but you're just shortening its life span.  <br>  <br>  Advice: don't use it while boarding|`|Unaaay0Caa	i snowboard with my ipod touch & blackberry all the time, mines fine...i mean i hit up the park with it too & fall haha, but umm mine is fine so you should be fine, but no guarantees lol =)|`|MFI0V2GBaa	Since it's touch screen so theres no hard case to cover the screen, I wouldn't reccommend it at all, easily break, plus it's not good to be in cold weather either.|`|iKlYJBaUaa	there wrong<br>  ive snowboarded with my ipod touch 15 times this year and nothing has happened<br>  your fine <br>  trust me

N4U2oKwEaa	Jockeys get a bad reputation because SOME are cocky and/or arrogant.  But you cannot characterize all jockeys as being this way.  My husband is a very successful jockey and also one of the most humble people that I have ever met in my life. You want to meet jerk, meet Garrett Gomez or Alan Garcia.<br>  <br>  And I agree, Aaron took what Joe did the wrong way.  HE was the one being a jerk in that situation.  Although I do see how it would upset him.  After all, that horse is named after his daughter.|`|WQa094S4aa	Jerk ` No, but he is immature.   Aaron was wrong, but I do not <br>  blame him for being upset.  He expected to ride that horse in her<br>  next race.  He had been training on her, and I do not understand<br>  how the trainer could have changed jockeys on that race.|`|3rt8oKIzaa	I don't think that he is. I think that anyone who is a jockey has to be like that. I think that it helps them be confident, which makes the horse confident.|`|FoUOqSh5aa	i mean yes he is VERY cocky... but then again hes young soo its to be expected. <br>  <br>  but im not 2 fond of him to be honest.|`|lTeXIjpOaa	Joe is a good jockey, maybe even a great jockey, but he is so good at such a young age that he is cocky, he thinks he can do no wrong, and that is when people start to make mistakes; he has a few things to learn from the older jocks at santa anita, mike smith has wond the kentucky derby, gryder and court have been racing for 20 some years; he needs to check his ego and learn from these guys how to race and be a gentleman about it, not a jerk|`|3BMBZtDxaa	He's young and cocky. It's how they come. All horse racers are cocky usually and they have no fear and are often arrogant. It's part of being a jockey!<br>  <br>  I don't think he's a huge jerk. Honestly, what he did was giving the picture to him as a gift to his daughter. Aaron was the one being a jerk. He took it the wrong way and crossed out his head and signed it, then scribbled on the envelope and threw it at him and was in a huff. <br>  <br>  Joe really admires Aaron. Aaron is like his hero. All his life Aaron Gryder was the one he looked up to. So if you beat your idol at what he did best wouldn't you get a tad cocky, too? I think that's what happened, but I also think a portion of it truly was sincerity while the rest was him being cocky as he usually is.<br>  <br>  It happens, you know? But I don't think of Joe as a jerk at all.

7x4VtGtFaa	There are only two in my list:<br>  Lev Yashin given what I've read. And Peter Schmeichel given what I've seen and read.<br>  <br>  Schmeichel gets my vote. He has all the qualities of a great goalkeeper: he organised his defence well; he was alert and had presence of mind; he was agile and nimble given his gigantic size; he was effective against crosses and high balls; fantastic in one-on-one situations; great anticipation; can start an offence from his box with huge throws and kicks; and a great penalty saver.|`|ksqAJ0ubaa	Definetly Dean Windass<br>  <br>  Last weekend whilst playing for Oldham their original keeper got sent off and Windass was put in goal even though he is a striker.

3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	The vast majority of Big and Small game is harvested within 100 yards or less.* Use the Winchester Brand Super X Power Point 40 grain hollow point bullet.* Highly accurate and Maximum Expansion on impact.*|`|sR3SUZC0aa	a .22 dont have any knock down power. and you arent going to hir a squirrel at 200-250 yards with a .22 its not going to be accurate at that range. it will never happen. im sure there are going to be people saying they have done it. you might want to stick with your 100 yard pop can. you should step it off and see how far off your guess of 100 yds is|`|AA11622061	The effective range of a .22 long rifle is 100 yards. As far as a favorite .22 long rifle cartridge, I think the CCI mini mags are good quality and you get 100 rounds here where I live for about 8 bucks. The copper plated American Eagle hollow points are my second choice because you can get a 50 round box for 3 bucks.|`|ruc14dO9aa	I've shot ground squirrels at 150 yards with my Ruger 10/22 (modified a bit from the factory model) - but that was pushing it.  They are almost exactly the same size as a pop can.   Most of the .22 LR ammo I've seen out there is all about the same as far as penetration/knockdown power -- but I don't think any of it is going to help a Henry rifle in .22 reach out to 200-250 yards - you'll need a faster muzzle velocity, maybe a faster spin on the bullet as well.   <br>  <br>  Usually that means getting into a larger caliber, like .223 at least. <br>  <br>  It's practically same diameter as the .22, but a heavier bullet, faster spin (this depends on the rifling in the barrel!) which helps it maintain stability over a longer range, and greater muzzle velocity in general.  <br>  <br>  However, if you'd like to stay with rimfire (as opposed to center-fire) cartridges, the .17 HMR is a viable caliber at the 200-300 yard range.  It is slightly smaller in diameter than the .22 (and is usually much lighter), but has a much higher velocity.  Easily capable of dropping a coyote at 200-270 yards, if you place your shot well. :-) <br>  <br>  If you start looking at more expensive .22 ammo - you could be exceeding the performance capability of your rifle.  Akin to putting racing fuel through a Ford Pinto.  I don't think the .22 caliber rimfire round wasn't designed with high-velocity or knock-down power in mind - but it's still fun to shoot!<br>  <br>  If you are looking for higher performance in the .22 LR category, you might also give serious thought to upgrading to a better rifle.  Anschutz makes about the best .22 LR rifle you'll find out there that isn't custom made.  The ubiquitous Ruger 10/22 (my .22 LR of choice) is highly customizable, and has a large following of after-market parts - it's easy to build your very own!  Savage arms makes a decent bolt-action rifle in both .22 LR and .17 HMR.  I think you'll find that more often the limiting factor is 1) the shooter, 2) the rifle and 3) the ammo.  Usually in that order. <br>  <br>  That being said, everyone I know who owns a Ruger 10/22 and shoots it seriously says that their gun "likes" a unique kind of ammo -- different for every rifle!  They found it by trial and error - shooting 50 rounds or so of each, and comparing.  Not sure if the same thing might work for your Henry? <br>  <br>  Sounds like you're headed in the right direction -  Shoot safely, and shoot often!|`|39d77d396b6018aac260eb632b7665f9aa	IMO, the best "long range" .22 LR round is the CCI Velociter...
FhHIAbmLaa	At short range, the 22 lr will do. I would get some quality high velocity rounds, and bait them with meat. If you are patient enough, you will shoot them. Don't be surprised if the 22 does not kill them on the spot, but if you hit them, they will die. <br>  <br>  If you can afford 200 bucks, an H&R Handi rifle will work best. Its a single shot rifle. They are sturdy guns, and cost little. I would get it in .243, .223. or 22 mag. I prefer that order. I use a .243 with a 55 grain bullet, and it kills coy dogs in their tracks. If cost of ammo or the scope is an issue, a 22 mag with open sights will have enough energy to punch through the pest no prob. I like the .243, because they can be shot 300 meters away with little adjustment for bullet drop.|`|AseJ6Y13aa	Do you live near Utah? I would love to come help with this prob. If you want just get a electronic call and do a pup in distress up wind to him so he dose not smell you. You will also need camo. Good luck|`|nBUDjyhgaa	I hope the coyotes win.|`|a7gdFHhraa	Agreed, get a dying rabbit call or a squeeker. Get up wind and blurt out a few long distress calls. Do it periodically about 1-2 minutes apart. Wounded rabbits call is very speratic and emotional so don't be afraid to mess it up, just blow. When you spot them coming in or hear them, back off on the call (blow softer) so it still sounds to them that the rabbit is far off. When in your comfort range to shoot accurately let them have it. If you have a spotter for the light and another shooter you can have one heck of a blood bath. Take the carcus and tie it up on your fences, they'll eventually steer clear of your place or die.|`|05f0ed7a9964bfcd8e3e5fe172f1cf21aa	depending where you live ( houses etc ) the 10/22 will do fine.<br>  i have dropped many coyotes with the same gun close to the house rather than use my 22-250 for obvious noise reasons.<br>  you may not have luck using a call if they have been hunted before but one sure fire method is to bait them with food.<br>  if you can set up somewhere that you can watch over the bait  ( like a building , barn , blind etc ) it will be the easiest method.<br>  very early in the morning seems to work best for me.<br>  coyotes have one weakness .      their bellies.<br>  they will come to food bait as it over powers their brains.<br>  a can of tuna or something that has a strong aroma placed outside at a spot that you can get a clear and safe avenue for a shot is quite effective.|`|zkzDLcznaa	If you have a 16 g and can still afford shells for it , then you should know how to hud a cote! Thumbs down to your question!!!|`|5qzndqYQaa	Use a .243 to get rid of them.If you only have a .22 use that.But you should think about the 16 gauge because the coyote might not die with the .22. I may not feel remorse for taking the life of a animal(especially when biting someones dog)but I don't like to see it suffer.|`|lT8MEI6Raa	I don't know about what calls to use, but I'd bet if you put out some raw chicken as bait and sat with a good rifle you could get a few of them<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|lB6J3qFAaa	Keep your dog inside, and use a dieing rabbit call.|`|VpXrsxGGaa	in that case use a 22 and put one through thier head next time you see one

9hC7bbf7aa	Yes, anna. As much I like him ? Andy behaved badly on the 2nd set...Similar to Connor's or McEnroe's notorious disputes ?  Stefanki needs to tame Andy's explosive rage under control, hewy !! <br>  <br>  Yes, the chair umpire should have used his authority to stop him, pretty ugly, yeah.<br>  <br>  Again, I'm still partial to Andy, I forgave, and forgot the incidence already...He is under a tremendous pressure, unless he manages to control his hot negative temper ? He could easily lose the match. Remember at 2008 US Open match with Djoko ? I believe Andy's loss was part due to his uncontrollable anger...Irish temper ?<br>  <br>  Thanks anna for bringing this issue in the open !|`|HNnVrvCfaa	Schuettler behaved badly like that the other day during his match against Gilles Simon.  I do think the umpire should have stopped him as it can be definitely off-putting for opponents.  I also think that any ill-feeling towards linesmen/women should be put to a stop.|`|HlFCd3yvaa	that's andy at his natural best...its different when youre in his shoes, you know?|`|1w5blbobaa	Well Roddick is an emotional guy.He react hard.I admit sometimes it looks a bit odd & his critics get chance 2 say against him.<br>  Bt I think 2morrow he was really freaked out & went crazy & just can't able 2 digest that point,that's why he argued sooo much.Bt he done this b4 also as u mention,so his emotional outburst is quite familiar with the audience now.<br>  <br>  Bt it's true that it's been a while that Andy is playing professional tennis & it's high time that he should control his behavior in situation like this,these controversial situation arrive with almost every players bt one expect a mature behavior from a top player like Roddick.<br>  <br>  I think there is no rule where umpire have the right to shut any player as long as he is not doing anything violent.The only thing he can do is not answering the player.<br>  <br>  Bt anyway HE WON & I REALLY REALLY HOPE HE WIN THE TITLE TOOO.....|`|9gscdqv4aa	ah that sounds horribly immature... at least he won tho, del potro let the worm get 2 him and he lost :( gutted!!!<br>  <br>  o no wait - even worse than andy, del potro refused 2 give an interview after his match, his coach said he wanted 2 get out of there asap. hes FAR worse behaved than ur andy!! <br>  <br>  i do like it when andy goes off tho, hes funny. but sometimes its anoying when hes so blantantly overreatcing.|`|cEbOwwu5aa	he did the same thing last year at the australian open...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff6_UTPDO9s" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff6_UTPDO...</a>|`|wx2UfKOdaa	good question... ya i agree with u... getting angry... on court is not acceptable|`|gCGbbIMcaa	Anna he`s withdraw from dubai !!! Im proud of him :) he`s standing up!! Good Job Roddick.<br>  <br>  He will be missed tho !!!|`|z9d0iFH1aa	yes i read about this in a news article but i'm glad he won anyways<br>  feel sorry for juan who lost to the gross worm
I5SypMlsaa	didnt feel well
t0PzSCs0aa	i do not know what will happen. you could try to email your coach and ask him.<br>  <br>  i recommend making it under 1:45, its not too hard if you're in shape and your stroke is decent.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  edit:  i was thinking a 100 above, <br>  a 200 in 1:45? 1:43:10 is actually a record time, set by an Olympic swimmer, Katie Hoff in 2007, according to USA Swimming. a high school team would not expect you to swim a 200 in record time.|`|mlTF11Pwaa	You don't get angry and stressed out! You just kee practicing and hope that you make the team next year|`|I1MAeetZaa	145 in a 200 free is kind of difficult for most people..<br>  i mostly see girls go 2 minutes and those are the best swimmers i know<br>  so good luck with that|`|xSv6JJ1Zaa	1:45 is EXTREMELY fast, in the 200 free, especially for a girl.<br>  <br>  I go a 1:50, and I consider myself decent in it. Are you sure it is for 200 yards?<br>  <br>  ===<br>  <br>  If you don't you will probably either get moved out of the class, or practice and not compete. There is no way for anyone here to give you a concrete answer due to the fact that no one knows what school you go to, or how the coaches at your school think.

gUMHWrjMaa	i would guess that it is if you maintain a strenuous level of exercise for 20-30mins, which you might find extremtly hard just runing on the spot. What's wrong with going outside for a run - even if you run around the block 2/3 times to make up some time/distance. Exercises in the home are limited without machenery - i reccomend buying treadmill if going outside isnt your thing, or a cross-trainer or , even, an exercise bike. <br>  <br>  on the side, getting some weights to use in the home will also help :)|`|GcOWoAmSaa	Only if you do it until you pass out. Start now.|`|1NtC3SG0aa	you can try core exercises like planks or do wall sits or something<br>  or u can use the dumbells to help do better pushups or if u have somewhere in your house with two bars close together you can do core exercises with the dumbells by holding onto one with both feet and lifting the dumbell up and down.<br>  you can also buy ankle or wrist weights for resistance training <br>  <br>  sorry best i can do!!<br>  good luck!!
zwkv4A3Eaa	Panicking is the worst thing you can do. If you ever feel like you are sinking, just calm down, ly on your back in a starfish flat and when you are ready, make your way slowly back to slallow water.  <br>  <br>  Treading water, yes, is probalby the best thing you can do. Not only will it give you the confidence that you know how to stay out of the water when you are over your head, but it also makes it easier to swim in gernneral. The EGG BEATER is the easiest way to tread water. Iès easy to do too. Just float as if you were sitting in a chair and turn your legs in opposit directions. To actualy see how itès done flolw this link. Itès an exalent example<br>   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR5S04vYe2I" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR5S04vYe...</a><br>  <br>  If you manage to sink to the bottom of the pool, just push off ofthe bottom. Youèll rise fast and be at the surface in one thierd of the time it took you to get down there. The other thingis, itès impossible to sink ALL THE WAY to the bottom. You can only sink 3-5 feet before the air in your lungs makes you float. Just kick upwards and youèrll be fine.<br>  By the way, you should not be in water that is five feet deaper that you are if you can not tred water.<br>  <br>  overall, donèt worry, swimming will come naturally as long as you are not scared to do it. watch that clip at learn to tread, and you wonèt ever have to worry aboutsinking.<br>  <br>  Hoped this helped!|`|t0PzSCs0aa	i recommend lessons as well, but for now, you could try to just float on your back whenever you get scared. then you can kick your legs a bit and "spread peanut butter" as mentioned above while on your back.<br>  <br>  staying calm is the most important thing, try to relax when youre in the water.|`|75ae4dd030c983bd678c722ce696f017aa	well first of all you don't want to freak out b/c that definitely won't help. easiest thing is to just take swimming lessons which isn't too bad cuz they are fun haha for treading water you want to make sure that your calm other wise it isn't going to work. then you want to move your arms so its like your spreading peanut butter (thats wut my teacher always told me to imagine) and then your legs go in circles like egg beaters (that description was form my swim teacher too lol). but swimming is fun, ive been doing it since i was 5 and i love it. you should take lessons. once you get the hang of it, you'll love it. good luck! :)

Temps in the car can be upwards of 140 degrees Farenhiet. Some drivers have been documented loosing 10-15 pounds of water weight during a race.<br>  <br>  To answer your next question before you ask it, some of them wear "Depends-like" undergarments because the races run for 3-5 hours with no potty break. Most of them visit the "little boy's room" just before climbing into their car and hold it in for the duration of the race. If you watch any post race coverage, you will notice that there is a gap in coverage of winners circle, while they interview the runners up, between climbing out of the car and the rest of the festivities in the winners circle.|`|VHrOe6kHaa	Depends on the driver.

9yVYfb2Uaa	in my opinion, this would go the distance and it will not be pretty sight. they are both brawlers in their nature, however, it is up to the trainers how they would win round per round. it will be a close fight and anything can happen. either Hatton can deliver a devasting one or 1-2 punch or pacquiao, as he did against other superstars, tenderize them until they became medium rare. or it could be a decision wherein both fighters suffered some bruises on their faces. the rarest is a quick win, both can deliver this because they are brawlers and that is a bonus one.<br>  <br>  i think manny can knock out hatton anytime he wants however if the question says what round can Pacman stop Hatton, it will be the 9th or 10th round because if you could notice the pattern against Diaz, DLH and others, he won in the latter part of the fights. this means he is patient enough to defeat Hatton and he sticks to the plan.|`|YNKe2KClaa	What are you talking about, Hatton will nockout pacquiao, heres why.Have we ever seen pacquiao get tested at a higher weight class that no superfeatherweight.David Diaz is not a quality opponent and thats the only fight he fought at lightweight , ofcourse he was gonna knock out an old dehydrated De La Hoya , now remeber pacquiao used to fight at flyweight , do you really think he can beat the 140lb king, manny is fast but Mayweather Sr is teaching Hatton patience and what kills speed , patience , timing . and as soon as hatton goes to the body you will see pacquiao slowing down , then hes gonna eat Hattons Roberto Duran style uppercuts|`|NSgSaspAaa	Man some of you are just so sure of Pacquiao now, huh? Remember that he still hasn't fought a prime, tough fighter above 135 pounds. De La Hoya would have looked terrible on that night, no matter who he had faced.<br>  <br>  Hatton is one mean machine at 140 pounds and has looked spectacular there. His only bad fights were above 140 (Collazo, Mayweather at 147).<br>  <br>  I actually think Hatton will overpower Manny and take a 116-112 decision or TKO Pacman.|`|YvG1Zjtvaa	Pacman by decision. No KO, but hatton will be cut and bloody. If there will be K'O it will be on the later rounds.|`|4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	I'm not convinced Pac has this one in the bank.  Dela Hoya fought like the slug that he is, but Hatton may just stay on top of Pac and in tight so much that Pac may have trouble setting up and landing shots.  As much as I criticize Hatton's sloppy style, I think it can be a winner against Pacqiou.|`|Msel5eAvaa	I dont know but Hatton fans will shut their mouths up after the fight. Hate to comment like this but the only way Hatton is gonna win is to clinch and wrestle Manny Pacquiao and give Manny Pacquiao a "bearhug" or a "tombstone piledriver".|`|pR0pJNJkaa	Mayweather Sr hasn't been with Hatton long enough for his influence to redefine this fighter. He will be sloppy and pay for it. Pac's speed and work rate will kill him. I do worry about the lack of attention to defense with Pacquiao, but that will take the fight to round 9, where Hatton will be done. Slick fighters like Mayweather and Collozo confuse Hatton.|`|sOi98doYaa	THE HITMAN TO KO THE PACMAN !!!<br>  <br>    Pacquiao not got a prayer against Hatton - And you know it!!!|`|kfSuRisvaa	4th|`|Xx8VCzMiaa	I SAY AROUND THE 10TH.<br>  <br>  VOTE ON youtube.com/user/RICLOPEZJR

Skiing and snowboarding have very little in common besides the fact you ride chair lifts and slide on snow.  Snowboarding is much harder than skiing is at first and I wouldn't recommend anyone try to teach themselves how to do it.<br>  <br>  Get yourself a lesson.  Snowboarding is really counter intuitive and having a lesson will make sure you understand the basics and don't start with bad habits.|`|AA11473256	maybe a lesson or two just so you dont make bad habits riding on your own but after the basics you can learn on your own
onkUcy19aa	Cold weather camping equipment<br>  <br>  The most important thing that anyone brings with them on a winter camp out, or any camp out, can't be bought in any store or made at home. It is a positive mental attitude. It's easy to go on a camp out and be cold and miserable. A positive attitude is a must, and anyone that doesn't have it, should stay home. All the equipment in the world can't make you have a rewarding camping experience without it.<br>  <br>  Personal Equipment<br>  <br>  Clothing<br>  <br>  Cold weather conditions make the proper choice and use of clothing more vital than at other times of the year. As you prepare your cold weather clothing, keep warm by following the guidelines that spell the word COLD.<br>  <br>  C - Clean<br>  <br>  Since insulation is effective when heat is trapped by dead air spaces, keep your insulating layers clean and fluffy. Dirt, grime, and perspiration can mat down those air spaces and reduce the warmth of a garment.<br>  <br>  O - Overheating<br>  <br>  Avoid overheating by adjusting your layers of clothing to meet the outside temperature and exertions of your activities. Excessive sweating can dampen your clothing and cause chilling later on.<br>  <br>  L - Loose Layers<br>  <br>  A steady flow of warm blood is essential to keep all parts of your body heated. Wear several loosely fitting layers of clothing and footgear that will allow maximum insulation without impeding your circulation.<br>  <br>  D - Dry<br>  <br>  Damp clothing and skin can cause your body to cool quickly, possibly leading to frostbite or hypothermia. Keep dry by avoiding cotton clothing that absorbs moisture, brushing snow from your cloths before it melts, and loosening the clothing around your neck and chest. Since body heat can drive perspiration through many layers of breathable cloth and force it out into the air, don't wear waterproof clothes.<br>  <br>  Wool clothing is ideal in cold weather because it is durable and water resistant, and even when soaked it can keep you warm. Wool makes excellent blankets, socks, hats, mittens, sweaters, and even pants. Army surplus stores have good wool clothing for winter camping. If wool irritates your skin, you may be able to wear wool blends or wear it over clothing made of other fabrics. Many synthetics are also good in winter for use as windbreakers and insulation. Remember that winter camping is not a fashion show. Whatever combination of clothing it takes to keep you warm should be worn, regardless of how it looks.<br>  <br>  The best method of wearing clothing in the winter is to use the layering system. Choose loose fitting clothing in as many layers as you can. The layers can be taken off or put on, depending on your activity level, temperature, wind, and precipitation. Versatility in your clothing is the key to a successful layering system. Several shirts, a sweater, and a jacket will allow you to adjust your system in many more ways than will a single heavy coat.<br>  <br>  Footwear is important in winter camping as your feet are subject to more exposure to moisture especially if it's not too cold out and snow is melting. At least two pair of socks are recommended as long as they aren't too tight. Wool or a wool blend is best. One method that can be used in wet conditions is to put plastic bags on your feet, either between the two layers of socks or directly on your feet. NEVER wear cotton socks under plastic bags as they will get wet from your perspiration and your feet will feel cold. Thin synthetic socks under the plastic bags with heavy wool socks over them is best. Whatever winter boots you have should be adequate plus an extra pair of boots, good sneakers or mukluks should be brought. <br>  <br>  Mittens that allow your fingers to be in direct contact with one another can keep your hands warmer than gloves that isolate each finger. A good pair of gloves are a must however for many tasks around camp that would be too cumbersome with mittens. Extra gloves and/or mittens are a must as gloves and mittens tend to get very wet. <br>  <br>  Stocking hats are great for wear outdoors and at night in your sleeping bag. Even better is a stocking hat long enough to cover your head and neck, and all of your face except your eyes. A coat with a hood is also helpful, as is a scarf around your neck that can be used to cover your face if needed.<br>  <br>  The best way to pack clothing for a winter camp out is not to just follow a list of clothing, but to actually put on what you will wear to be sure your layering system fits and is functional. To see if your system will keep you warm, go outside and sit in the yard or go to the park and sit for a couple hours (You may even be able to do some requirements for one of the nature related merit badges while you wait). Sitting still is the best way to test your system as this is when your body does not produce much of it's own heat. If you can stay warm sitting around, then you will have no problem staying warm moving around at camp. To be sure you have enough extra clothes, try to pack at least another complete system just in case your system gets|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	food is often hard to come by/make on a camping trip<br>  i would bring things that are fairly light (especially if you are backpacking)<br>  <br>  things that just need water:<br>  <br>  tea/instant coffee<br>  instant oatmeal<br>  hot chocolate<br>  soup (some need water, some are just needing to be heated up)<br>  ** there are a ton of soup options, stuff in tin cans, packages/pouches, some come in cardboard bowls etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  also bringing some booze (if appropriate) is a tasty warm thing to have<br>  ;)|`|LiTMU2Dhaa	A really warm sleeping bag - trust me on this, I live in Malibu so when i went camping in Oregon I totally froze my *** of.<br>  Blankets <br>  Pillow<br>  First Aid Kit<br>  Plenty of WARM clothes<br>  Flashlight<br>  Batteries (for flashlight)<br>  Camera - Not really a necessity but theres bound to be something that you'll wish you had your camera for if you leave it behind<br>  Books - Something to pass the time when your not out and about.

PNk2hbOEaa	There are two basic hurdle heights: high hurdles and intermediate hurdles. The sprint hurdle races (60 m, 100 m and 110 m) use high hurdles, which are 42 inches (1.07 m) high (39 inches, or 0.99 m, in U.S. high school competition) for men and 33 inches (.84 m) high for women. Long hurdle races (400 m) use intermediate hurdles, which are 36 inches (.914 m) high for men and 30 inches (.762 m) high for women. Slightly lower heights (generally 3 inches (76 mm) lower)
Jb5itwHtaa	I always thought Forskin was a cheap player. Watch his so called big hits on highlights. Many of them he got a piece of the guys skate with his stick before hitting him, putting him of balance before the hit came. He also did a ton of sloo-foots of guys while hitting them. Many hits from behind too. But then him and his daddy had the nerve to say the league didn't protect him, and he is a superstar. I don't deny him the offensive ability, but he was a dirty hack.|`|hX089rlnaa	One of the reason I have always disliked Forsberg is because he plays dirty. Someone w/ his skills shouldn't need to do so.|`|yHvh7tFlaa	There is always a double standard with stars and also-rans.  I am NOT defending what Simon did, Simon was absolutely out of line with his two-hander, but Hollweg gave Simon a concussion when he boarded Simon. Maybe if the ref had called the boarding penalty, it doesn't happen. Forsberg's slash looked intentional, but because they were tied up before, it could go as accidental.<br>  <br>  As far as a double standard. just look at last season. Simon stomped on Ruutu's skate and got 30 games? Chris Pronger stomps on someone's( can't remember the name) skate and only gets 8 games, getting him back in time for the playoffs. Both were repeat offenders. The star treatment double standard at work.|`|AA10068004	They are very different. While Forsberg did stick him and looked purposely, the force of his whack was nowhere near Simon's cheapshot ... sure worthy of a minor or double minor but that Simon slash to the face was completely a sucker shot and out of control. Watch both videos again... Simon jumped the guy with a full-force slash to the head. Forsberg was surely in the wrong and was a cheap play but no where near the degree of Simon's shot.|`|KyCJOR2paa	That's what type of player Forsberg always was.  He played on the edge and that's what made him good.  Not only was he amazing offensively, but he was an agitator too.  I have to say he was one of the dirtiest players I've ever seen play, but he always seemed to get away with it.<br>  <br>  On a side note, I got to watch the Sharks/Kings game last night and saw the old Claude Lemieux come out.  You know he is back when he is busy getting in the face of the least physical players on the other team.  After his penalty he was "subtly" shoving Kopitar's head down.  Good old "manly" Lemieux, never going after someone who will do anything back.  What a pu$$y.|`|6cHwnaCZaa	You honestly think those two incidents are similar?? Forsberg was utilizing the sacrificial bunt, whereas Simon was swinging for the fence. That's like comparing kittens to tigers.|`|YBpjA72faa	While Simon's slash was clearly intentional and a retaliation, Forsberg's could be passed off for being an accident.|`|BrWVhd9naa	Huh forsberg is gone forev
KMASS2Gmaa	A hollow point slug starts to mushroom on impact with a solid target. Paper won't do it.|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	Somewhere in the middle of the target if it is dense enough.|`|dAK8dS4kaa	On contact with the target|`|FKJaQXQLaa	Upon impact, the hollow cavity fills with tissue and fluid (blood, muscle, fat etc).  As the bullet penetrates, the hydraulic forces inside the cavity  of the nose of the bullet cause it to push back and expand.  The copper jacket is bonded to the bullet and help it to stay together and retain most of its weight.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Upon impact with Target.*|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Upon hitting the target.|`|famao81gaa	When it hits a semi-solid  target such as a squirrel or varmint. Seldom do paper targets cause any sort of mushroom (bullet expansion) Some hollowpoints at rifle velocities will desintegrate upon hitting a semi-solid target. They are usually being driven at faster velocities than they are designed to used at by handloaders that are not asstitute. This is not a good thing for varmints that you want to cleanly kill. Hollowpoints are NEVER to be used for Big Game like Deer as they will most likely exploded on animal contact, not penetrate the body very far and cause wounded and lost game.|`|ev48pcJ5aa	it expands when hitting the target, yes it expands as matter fills the void in the "hollow" point, however sometimes the filling of this void with certain materials on the body will prevent the expansion of the hollow point, but most hp's will mushroom as they hit the target|`|GmRscBkPaa	Remember most bullets have some kind of metal jacket to help control the expansion of the lead.  Without it, the lead tends to fracture into pieces, or flatten out with undesireable characteristics.  But either way it will start to mushroom upon impact...|`|lT8MEI6Raa	It mushrooms when something other than air fills the void and forces it to expand i.e. when it hits the target
BrWVhd9naa	They should but they wont|`|axxQzOCHaa	While his participation in the NHL may have been minimal compared to other pioneers in other sports like Jackie Robinson and Jim Thorpe, let's not forget that he played much of his hockey in the original 6 era. I think his number should be retired league-wide.|`|FY17j1Ajaa	If O'Ree was not a person of color, no one would even mention his modest career. That is not to dismiss his contribution to the NHL. Willie O'Ree was not an impact player such as Jackie Robinson was in MLB. Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier led to ALL teams in MLB signing the most talented players regardless of skin color. Sadly, MR. O'Ree did not have an impact anywhere near the magnitude of Jackie Robinson. His number should not be retired by the Bruins or league wide.|`|AA10068004	The significance of O'Ree is important but to be honest I do not think they should. His participation in the NHL was a milestone for the entire league, not just the Bruins. He also played only 45 games for the Bruins. Considering Brad Park also wore #22 and played 8 seasons for the Bruins and earned almost 900 points in his entire career it would be hard to sell. If anything in honor of O'Ree is to be done it should be a league-wide honor and not just one team. IMO, I think maybe a trophy would be in order to honor minorities in the game. Over the years there has been a noticible increase in black players at all levels of hockey, not just the NHL. Also, not just in terms of players... in the modern era of the game minorities have made gains in other capacities within leagues and organizations. I think some sort of yearly award in his name is well warranted.|`|nNDKyQjeaa	eh...<br>  <br>  he didn't even really play a full season, did he?<br>  <br>  yeah i just looked it up, he played most of his career in the WHA.  people call him the "jackie robinson of hockey" but the difference is that jackie robinson was one of the greatest baseball players of all time, and o'ree was mediocre, except for one season he played in San Diego where he had 78 points.<br>  <br>  so, no.|`|ll2y4YIGaa	No, too many obsticles and such..

wPKUl3CTaa	It could happen, the Texans have a great receiver in Andre Johnson and they have a reliable running back Steve Slaton. The Texans have a greatly improved Defense.

I also have a set of rollers that cost me $35 also second hand. There is no way you could cobble something together that might or might not work for less than either of these choices, and some homemade thing you might be able to make would probably damage your bike. Look for a second hand trainer, you won't be able to make something equivalent for less money.|`|CttL3LmBaa	For the stresses involved and applying resistance to emulate riding effort you can not, for the money, make something yourself to replace a trainer.<br>  <br>  I am sorry if you can't afford a new one, try a used one as previously suggested.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -----<br>  Edit: Wow, some people ride where it is cold, windy, and icy outside!

Other reasons could vary.
lKpeXCLGaa	Yes its normal. They red flag races and wait to see if the rain will stop and they can dry the track, if not the race will be called if its past the halfway lap (field of cars is frozen and thats the way they finish),if not they will postpone it till next day. Nascar does this because they don't have rain tires for it. sucks when it happens.|`|avznYHLOaa	All they had to do was start it early, but instead they had a 2 hour pre-race show that included interviews with drivers and a country music singer? We see where NASCAR's prioritys are|`|ezvq8ydYaa	Well i think it shouldnt of been canceled they should of waited daytona has lights for night racing but its kinda normal|`|AA11264416	well usually they stop the race and just wait a certain amount of time to see if the rain stops and if it does stop soon enough they'll dry the track off and then restart the race, they don't use rain tires in nascar, they experimented with it in the nationwide series last year though, but last week's race what they did was made a mistake of waiting to long to even start the race, it used to start about 1 or 2 PM eastern time, also they didn't wait for the rain because it was already getting late and the radar showed it was going to rain to long so they just called it, they should start the races at about 1PM eastern time again, but that was the first time they called the race that early without really waiting but that was their fault for starting the race to late in the day|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	Yep...too dangerous to race in the rain...plus they can't see.  They are going waaay too fast.  Don't let one rain delay ruin you to ever watch another NASCAR race...NASCAR is really fun fast and exciting!|`|Avmolxyqaa	Yeah,  stopping races is a pretty good idea when guys are driving 150MPH with barely a finger's breadth of space between cars.  Three wide in the turns may look cool but at those speeds with wet asphalt it would be deadly.  <br>  <br>  and - er - those guys ain't got no windshield wipers either.|`|Cf7rZsyzaa	yea they usually try to dry the tracks with jet dryers while they park the cars if it gets bad, if they decide its to much then they will postpone the race or if its past half way then who ever is in the lead at that time will win.|`|jPEoiWkGaa	well its not normal because it doesn't rain that often.  But when it does rain they do stop the race.|`|Ek1x32WHaa	Cars are too heavy. Rain tires would never work. Especially not on a high banked track like Daytona!
Cf7rZsyzaa	i've only been watching for about 5 years so i dont no much about the old cars. i do like the 80's monte's though my neighbor has one lol.

wMvd9x06aa	I assume that as you say kite boarding ur meaning on land rather than "kite surfing" which is at sea,<br>  <br>  The first thing I would recommend is buying a small "power kite" there are 2 main different types of powerkites (traction kites ) the air ram ones which are used on land and the big invaluable 1's<br>   used in the water (the water 1s are not recommend as they are to power full for land .<br>  To start off I would buy a normal power kite maybe 2-3 m kite make sure its a 4 line power kite these in some wind will show you just how powerful they can be ( they wont blow you off your feet ) but will give you key eexperience on how to control the kite properly (and may drag you about abit :P) once you get good with the controls you should buy a board , a regular mountain board would do to start out , keeping with the kite you would have (and with lots of space to experiment) practice on the board, (look on different websites and forums for loads of help (like the link below ), All this research cant substitute for a propinstructorss so I recommend that when getting to the board stage to go and find 1 , <br>  btw smaller kites shouldn't cost less as less material however different makes cost more .  hope this helps to get you going  and good luck :)<br>  <br>  ps the link is about buggys but also relevent to boards .
LUnscegvaa	All will help in varying degrees.<br>  <br>  My choice would be Aikido but that just because of my background.<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you choose.<br>  <br>  Best wishes :)***|`|be8c12cdca22b46ac7dcd7d626901063aa	You should wake up dude .<br>  You want fight , you are not interested to know martial art . <br>  You placed your question in wrong section .<br>  I would recommend for you MMA , because is nonsense , brutal and probably will match your needs .<br>  Even do not try KravMaga or Aikido -is not for you !|`|NJMzhcKhaa	Krav Maga = s**t excuse of a martial art. KM is designed for military use <br>  Translation = Soldiers don't put lots of time training H2H combat, they spend most of their training time in physical exercise and markmanship, KM have a lot of study to the concept of fighting and dynamic of fighting to equip soldiers with basic knowledge of H2H (hand to hand) combat.<br>  But as a training, KM is not meant to be a long term serious martial art, after all modern soldiers don't get involved in a H2H combat as much as their 20th century predecessors (the reason why there's no more bayonet sticking on soldiers rifle anymore)<br>  Krav Maga won't be effective against someone who know how to fight, it might teach you how to fight a totally untrained person, but not against another trained fighter.<br>  Plus KM is dangerous because it teaches a lot of weapon disarming moves which a  trained escrima/silat fighter will cut any KM practitioners in pieces if they try their disarming moves on them. It's dangerous because it gives a lot of false sense of confidence and might be detrimental to the practitioner health when the person got robbed and tried to fight off a knife wielding attacker (instead of running and call the police)<br>  <br>  MMA is good if you want to join in an MMA sport tournament. MMA is decent as self defence training too.<br>  <br>  Aikido, sadly a lot of aikido places are McDojos these days. Do check that local aikido place and train with them. Learn how to spot McDojo according to their contract (binding and one sided), how they speak to you (do they sound like salesman) and how easy it is to obtain belts (the easier it is, the more McDojo it is)<br>  <br>  I would take the MMA if I were you, depend on how good their trainers too though, and then later on take an escrima or silat lesson for your weapon training.<br>  <br>  (there is no way on earth you will be able to win a 1v4 fight empty handedly)|`|LFLflsWFaa	All styles are great but it depends who's teaching it.<br>  <br>  Yeah KM can be effective or MMA or Aikido, but what good is it if you have a horrible instructor? What happens when you just learn technique but not the meaning behind of it? I was brought down that TKD was considered ineffective or w/e but my instructor is actually one of the best martial arts teacher I ever had in my life. <br>  <br>  As for fights.. the primary goal of martial arts is for self-defense. If you want trouble, you'll get it. It's as simple as that. In a 1 vs 4 fight, the style doesn't matter, it's your animal instinct that's going kill someone or run away.|`|tZXHSxkQaa	Aikido and KM would be best,if possible,some TKD wouldn't hurt.|`|D6NBfSVoaa	MMA is definitely the best, but Aikido is still pretty good.|`|E07VAMNMaa	Krav Maga is what i would recommend. Aikido also, that is very affective. If you could find a traditional Karate or tang soo do, that would be great too. The style you study isnt as important as the teacher teaching it. If the teacher is experienced and knows what he or she is doing, the students will be awesome, if the teacher sucks, the students will also suck. Any good teacher regardless of what style he or she is teaching will be able to teach you how to defend yourself.|`|qQiOtyuzaa	I'd go with Krav Maga first...then when you get the hang of it, try some MMA. I don't think either is the best, but Krav is good for at least learning basic self defense.<br>  <br>  As for MMA, it might be a good idea to learn it just because UFC (and similar MMA contests) are getting more popular..and some idiot might try using the techniques he saw on tv on you. (knowing how to actually use the techniques would give you a little bit of an advantage)<br>  <br>  And Aikido CAN be useful...but as others have said, there's alot of McDojos teaching it. Not only that, but even if you find a GOOD dojo, Aikido takes longer than the other two arts to get to where you could use it effectively.|`|LaBxzWa7aa	MMA's ******* stupid, they just take small chunks of martial arts and combine them(******* dumb, the sport is great the style is retarded.)<br>  <br>  Krav Manga's best for self-defense, but horrible if you want to impress people or become an athlete, Krav Manga relies on crouch kicks, eye gouges and shhhhiiiiiiiiitttttttttt like that.<br>  <br>  Aikido isn't really practical.|`|BbK0fA4Laa	Krav Maga is pretty darn effective. If you want to defend yourself go with Krav Maga. <br>  <br>  If you want to just kick some butt go with MMA. <br>  <br>  Aikido now, that would be a good addition to either Krava Maga or MMA, but I would not take just that solely. It takes quit some time to really get some serious skills in aikido.|`|szcA8CDyaa	Krav Maga, MMA and Aikido are good but i would recommend MMA because MMA stand for Mixed Martial Arts which it can thought you self-defence and how to attack back with hands and legs.|`|fRosDAZEaa	See for yourself!|`|JpJnhkmDaa	why dont you go there and try each style urself ..m sure first class is always free
UoT86gbiaa	That's like picking the other guy's pocket and then using his money to buy an hour with his wife.<br>  <br>  Do it and laugh.  It's not even close.|`|qn50rmQOaa	If you can, post the rest of your team. This will give everyone a better look at how the trade will effect you.|`|xrhnDShgaa	It depends on the situation. <br>  <br>  Is this a points or roto league?<br>  <br>  Is this a yearly or keeper league?<br>  <br>  Does position scarcity matter to you?<br>  <br>  How many teams in the league?<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  How do you project how they do this year?<br>  <br>  You should not expect more than 30-35 home runs from Manny and you have to take into account before his contract year he did only hit 20 home runs. I myself would probably take Uggla due to position scarcity and the fact Manny only plays when he wants. Once Manny gets his money his stats will slip since he's past his prime. Don't expect prime numbers from a guy who's past his prime, just came off a contract year, and only plays when he wants to.
1738296cc77006ee52364e11a2b2b669aa	most fields are marked off into 5 yard increments, when she says inside of the 35 yard line she is talking about between the 35 and 40 yard lines. Most bands face the Press Box side because that is where they always film the performance to study later.|`|vebgaPNiaa	I am not a band leader or director or band member.  Inside the 35 would be toward the goal line or toward the end zone.  Or toward the lesser number yard line.  One yard line inside the 35 would be the 34 yard line.  2.5 steps inside the 35 is not quite the 34 yard line.|`|ObaHP6wnaa	It actually doesn't require a lengthy explanation.<br>  <br>  "Inside" means towards the center of the filed (the 50-yard line)<br>  "Outside" means towards the end zone.<br>  <br>  The direction you're facing shouldn't have anything to do with it.<br>  <br>  There are 8 steps per 5 yards, so 4 steps inside the 40 would be on the 42.5 yard line - halfway between the 40 and 45.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.
dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	Actually I would ship them to my new home. Why would you want to waste time at an airport since the metal in them will definitely set off the alarm. I have put them in my luggage when I was going to Hawaii for the worlds in 2000 and they detained me because they did know what they were. They told me that next time to inform the check in that I had them...I almost missed my flight because of that. Keep in mind they look like weapons to people who have no idea what they are. Good luck.|`|tZXHSxkQaa	Put them in the luggage to be checked,be sure to declare it.|`|9c7376f26c36bc947149ca2f7eae4097aa	Ship it fedx, its just safer.
nAtBuBRhaa	Ray Lewis is smart enough not to join this team. They have a whole bunch of line backers all ready. He should of just got the franchise tag, and Terrel Suggs should of signed a 5-6 year contract. Anyways, Dallas is a possibility if Ray Lewis does hit free agency. Also, the New York Jets are defiantly gonna be interested in him, Rex Ryan was his former defensive coordinator in Baltimore. So, you know they have history together. Also, I wouldn't be surprised if the Cleveland Browns didn't pick him up. They have mentioned they are interested in a lot of players this year in free agency, also they signed Willie McGinest a couple years ago. So, you know they like aged former All-Pro wide receivers. But, my bet is either the Jets or Browns.|`|XLXncQu9aa	You wish.  Ray Lewis will not be leaving.  Those were just rumors going around the NFL.  It was rumored that Julius Peppers was leaving which was true to an extent but look what happened, he was franchised which means the only way out is through a trade which probably won't happen.  With that being said Lewis will be re-signed with the Ravens because that is his home for his career.  The Raven's wouldn't be the same without him.  He makes them better, and even if he did go to the Cowboys the defense would be better but not the whole team.  The team needs to work on its offense more than defense.  The Cowboys have the talent defensively, its a matter of making sure T.O. is not unruly like he has been, and keeping Romo from making too many mistakes offensively.  Lewis is a Raven until he retires.|`|KNTofuxMaa	I would definitely be nice for us Cowboy fans. His commanding presence is exactly what this team needs. Whether or not it happens, though...|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	He wont go there.  They cant afford him.  THey are going to pay Ware around 40 million this offseason.  To answer the other guy that said the traditional comparison between the Cowboys and criminals..................maybe Lewis can sign in Pittsburgh, they are the team of criminals|`|tzrLDbHWaa	The Cowboys are kinda getting short on criminals on their roster, adding a murderer would actually improve their rep.|`|S71lfad2aa	I don't see him leaving Baltimore.  Then Dallas can't afford him.  T.O. don't want to share the stardom with someone else neither.|`|ZPJyVOpTaa	he would be an idiot to join that crowd|`|VoKzvoxKaa	it would  be cool but Dallas is already spending more money than any other team|`|uWRPbJQ1aa	no, they got Zach Thomas, why would they need ray lewis|`|1738296cc77006ee52364e11a2b2b669aa	They have no cap room for him if they keep TO and his ego.  I hope he isn't that stupid to go to Dallas.
jGgOVd5Zaa	Don't worry about the brand.  How does it feel?  Does it fit right?  Does it have a good pocket?  I had a second hand Wilson when I first started playing.  It was from 1941 (OK, maybe it was third or fourth or fifth hand).  It was terrible (although it might have been a collectors item if I hadn't lost it.)  It was too short, too stiff, not enough padding...  <br>  <br>  When I finally got a modern glove it was awesome.  By the time I tried out for my high school team it was so worn and beaten up that it was certainly not going to win any beauty prizes.  <br>  <br>  Actually, I nearly had a major accident during try outs because the string on the pocket snapped.  I kept missing balls and my friend kept saying, 'Hah!  You have a hole in your glove.'  It was a good thing they didn't throw anything near my face.  I restrung it with a shoelace and got it restrung with leather later.  Once you have a glove that fits, it's your glove.  Don't worry about what it looks like.
VVNX1P3jaa	Check oiut Cubs.com, I haven't seen a seating chart, where you can get an actual seating chart with phots. But maybe this is why that  tickets should really be brought either at the box office, or by phone, that way you can ask them this question.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Go to their website, you can usually put in your seat numbers and get a view from that area to see what the seats are like.
nJ5kceMBaa	Anti-Liverpoolness is over-represented on this website. The sudden arrival of about 37 Torres loving 13 year old girls probably doesn't help.<br>  <br>  Mrs Pato: I'm not saying I have anything against them. I just know that other people find it a little annoying, that's all. I don't have anything against anyone. They have as much right as anyone else =)|`|bNykcEVXaa	I have NO idea....<br>  Probably after getting about 9 TD's a question...<br>  <br>  or maybe its when you lot started beating everyone this season, and went top of the league...

You're only 16 so you can't exactly say anything. Or is it just cos they're lasses? Cough, sexist much?|`|uXXbegw5aa	I will always love Liverpool :)|`|THaKSvKwaa	when we started drawing loads of games and lost top spot in the prem|`|xlyk63xRaa	im a liverpool fan but i dont think people are being anti-liverpool , i think its alot more like anit-fan , its just a coincidence that some are liverpool fans, and some are from other clubs...and if you are being thumbed down 9 times its probably most likely that you dont know a thing about football.|`|96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	not anti liverpool just a few of the fans of liverpool f c , some liverpool fans are my contacts , it is usually the kids who generate some of the anti liverpool brigade|`|OYITN4S2aa	When they realized Liverpool sucks.|`|cjNtjOZtaa	The problem has it in one , I don't hate any set of fans on here only individuals .

Chris Jericho was the very first one, when he defeated the Rock for the WCW Championship and Stone Cold Steve Austin for the WWF Championship at Vengeance (2001) on December 9, 2001.  Other Undisputed Champions are Triple H, Hulk Hogan, The Undertaker, The Rock, and Brock Lesnar.  "Undisputed" was removed from the title's name after it became exclusive to the SmackDown! brand on September 2, 2002, which resulted in the creation of the World Heavyweight Championship for the Raw brand.|`|smcDn76jaa	HHH, The Rock, Taker, Brock Lesnar, Hulk Hogan. RVD was never and Undisputed champion. He never unified the ECW title with the WWE title plus he would have also have to unify it with the World Heavyweight title and the TNA title which is damn near impossible.|`|gVlTlpb2aa	rvd never was but triple h,hogan,undertaker,rock,and brock lesnar was for one day before they retired it.maybe by the end of the winter it will be back with edge,orton,triple h or cena as the champion|`|ywU3ZpIgaa	Triple H the Undertaker Hulk Hogan and The Rock|`|02XHxknUaa	HHH

ELx5dnVeaa	If marijuana is legalized it would just be taxed. The legal age would probably be 18 since you can't OD on marijuana. I don't think we should legalize it because if it's legalized it means it can be advertised as well as other non-lethal drugs (since they would also be legalized eventually). Heavier advertisement means more minor exposure to drugs, which means stricter laws enforcing legal age. Also there would probably be discrimination against weed users like there is now against smokers. Take into consideration that legalizing weed would give more power to the street drug lords. Unless the goverment is able to usurp the drug market from the drug lord's hands, which would be an infringement upon free market capitalism. If the goverment is able to take control of the weed they would run into competition with the prominent drug lords and they wouldn't be able to do more without violating due process of law and free market capitalism. Thus there would be widespread economic and social strife because of goverment interference. This would cause two problems: the police would not be able to stop drug dealers without spitting on the bill of rights and the competition between the goverment-backed local markets and drug dealers would drive prices ridiculously high. Once prices are high and demand remains the same, investors buy in because essentially the goverment and the drug dealers are forming a trust which is technically monopolistic in nature. Eventually smaller drug dealers would get back into the picture and the weed market would crash down taking the economy with it. So no, marijuana should not be legalized.|`|eY8MNX6baa	Look potheads can do what ever they want as long as they aren't harming people(which they are right now). if legalizing marijuana stops all the violence in mexico then WHY NOT legalize it. BUT on the other hand people would be smoking it more cuz it's legal BUt The narcos would no longer be narcos cuz there is no more Contrabando..|`|xtmQ7vksaa	Sure why not?<br>  <br>  Drinking is hella worst.. u drink, then u fight, get into accidents and do hella stupid ****, and the next morning u have a big asss cruda.<br>  <br>  U smoke weed, then u feel relaxed, get hungry and eat p & j sandwish lol... see the difference.|`|r4a376Ocaa	Maybe, since the economy is going down, people are angry, stressed, anxious and well they feel depressed. Maybe MJ can be used to boost the economy, more people would buy it to feel better, and eventually the money would circulate more. But I dont thing religious leaders like the Pope or Christian leaders or muslims leaders would approve, but hey will gave billions of dollars to car industries, why not give it to medical weed. O but yea i dont smoke. i just think it woud be a boost to economy!|`|PowkYTGJaa	yeah!! smoking regular squares is worst!!|`|qOOU1EVlaa	mmmm...marijuana is bad and chyt but ppl do it anyways ...so it watever lol|`|5QfNKwqyaa	el verde es vida

nRBC4E5saa	Sanchez vs. Stevenson: the biggest X-factor here is how the weight cut has affected Sanchez.  Lots of guys look sluggish the first time they move down.  However Sanchez has insane mental strength, so even if he does have a rough first cut, I'd expect him to push through it.  If he cut right, he wins this by TKO in the 1st.  If not, he still wins by decission.<br>  <br>  Going with Markham over Hardy, just for fun.  Let's say sub in the first.<br>  <br>  I think Marquardt will be more technical with his strikes, and take the fight to the ground if he needs to.  Gouveia is the kind of guy that has that one-shot KO power, but my money is still on Nate.  UD, R3.<br>  <br>  Maia over Sonnen.  Sub, R1.  Chael just has no sub defense.  Plus he's a screamer...<br>  <br>  Koscheck is on a roll.  He'll keep rolling here.  TKO, late in the first.<br>  <br>  I pick Kelly and Eklund to win on the undercard.  Don't know enough about the other fighters to make an assessment.|`|UhY8c7bKaa	////////////////////////////////////////...<br>  -------------WRESTLiNGBAY.COM---------...<br>  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\...<br>  <br>  Watch UFC 95: Sanchez vs. Stevenson at WRESTLiNGBAY.COM<br>  <br>  REGISTER NOW FOR ACCESS TO THE BEST WRESTLING/BOXING/MMA SITE ON THE WEB!<br>  <br>  OVER 18, 000 Members ALREADY ENJOY THERE SERVICES!!!<br>  <br>  Click Here to Register: <a href="http://www.wrestlingbay.com/index.php?referrerid=8" rel="nofollow">http://www.wrestlingbay.com/index.php?re...</a><br>  <br>  <----Other-Upcoming-Streams----><br>  > Kelly Pavlik vs Antonio Rubio Saturday 21 February<br>  > Paul Appleby v Martin Lyndsey Saturday 7 March<br>  > Amir Khan vs Marco Antonio Barrera LIVE Stream 14 th March|`|Wd7NS0faaa	////////////////////////////////////////...<br>  -------------WRESTLiNGBAY.COM---------...<br>  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\...<br>  <br>  Watch Miguel Cotto vs Michael Jennings At WRESTLiNGBAY.COM<br>  <br>  REGISTER NOW FOR ACCESS TO THE BEST WRESTLING/BOXING/MMA SITE ON THE WEB!<br>  <br>  OVER 19, 000 Members ALREADY ENJOY THERE SERVICES!!!<br>  <br>  Click Here to Register: <a href="http://www.wrestlingbay.com/index.php?re..." rel="nofollow">http://www.wrestlingbay.com/index.php?re...</a><br>  <br>  <----Other-Upcoming-Streams----><br>  > UFC 95: Sanchez vs. Stevenson Saturday 21 February<br>  > Kelly Pavlik vs Antonio Rubio Saturday 21 February<br>  > Paul Appleby v Martin Lyndsey Saturday 7 March<br>  > Amir Khan vs Marco Antonio Barrera LIVE Stream 14 th March|`|FUujUhg8aa	////////////////////////////////////////...<br>  -------------WRESTLiNGBAY.COM---------...<br>  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\...<br>  <br>  Watch UFC 95: Sanchez vs. Stevenson at WRESTLiNGBAY.COM<br>  <br>  REGISTER NOW FOR ACCESS TO THE BEST WRESTLING/BOXING/MMA SITE ON THE WEB!<br>  <br>  OVER 18, 000 Members ALREADY ENJOY THERE SERVICES!!!<br>  <br>  Click Here to Register: <a href="http://www.wrestlingbay.com/index.php?referrerid=8" rel="nofollow">http://www.wrestlingbay.com/index.php?re...</a><br>  <br>  <----Other-Upcoming-Streams----><br>  > Kelly Pavlik vs Antonio Rubio Saturday 21 February<br>  > Paul Appleby v Martin Lyndsey Saturday 7 March<br>  > Amir Khan vs Marco Antonio Barrera LIVE Stream 14 th March|`|NJMzhcKhaa	Diego Sanchez over Stevenson by decision <br>  As good as each other on the ground, Diego has a better standup than Joe.<br>  <br>  Nate Marquardt over Gouveia by TKO<br>  Gouveia is a gatekeeper and Marquardt will pass the test<br>  <br>  Demian Maia over Sonnen by submission<br>  <br>  Koscheck over Thiago by TKO<br>  <br>  Junior Dos Santos via TKO<br>  Per Elklund via submission|`|Tdkx7fZpaa	Diego Sanchez TKO<br>  Rory Markham TKO<br>  Nate Marquardt  Submission<br>  Demian Maia  Submission <br>  Josh Koscheck TKO<br>  Terry Etim Decision<br>  Junior Dos Santos TKO<br>  Mike Ciesnolevicz TKO <br>  Per Elkund  Decision <br>  Paul Kelly TKO

Fq30ftalaa	Its the same reason that they did the Shawn Michaels turn on Marty Jinety(sp?) when The Rockers broke up. Its also the same reason that Owen Hart gave Shawn a "concussion" which led Shawn to beat Bret for the WWE (then WWF) title at WrestleMania. Its controversy. Its "real". It plays to your emotions. What seems more believable, Hunter coming out to save his wife, or someone like Shad, or even Dave (Batista) coming out to save her? All the WWE is trying to do, is draw people in. More people=more ratings. More ratings=more money. And what draws more than arguably one of the biggest heels "crossing the line" and hurting one of the biggest faces (arguably) wives? How personal is that.<br>  <br>  I must say, that both Hunter and Orton do a great job selling the whole thing. Orton with the IED thing, and his shock/glee, and Hunters tears. The tears are what sold me on the whole thing.|`|djM3vSw9aa	Because it's more believable. The casual fan has become too aware that Triple H is married into the McMahon family and it would make only sense then to actually acknowledge it on television if Randy Orton punts his brother-in-law and RKO his wife. It builds on realistic tension and emotions and leads into a more engaging encounter at WrestleMania 25.|`|4j92pzJxaa	They always want stuff to seem real.<br>  <br>  ORTON vs HHH wrestlemania|`|GJQIL0RZaa	Hyping up a possible feud.|`|AxQFG33maa	i hope triple h does something bad to randy with his sledgehammer|`|T13xM9iJaa	They want to put some real heat in this storyline so they used hhh real family so their match at WM25 could be BIG its just like with the Cena/Orton storyline they wanted to put some real heat in that story so they used Cena's real dad<br>  <br>  Just to let you know backstage Randy is a really nice guy and is friends with almost everybody and his best friend is Cena|`|IMQm9JTMaa	That is possible, If people like it or not, Batista is a huge part of RAW.

6baa64727b51c64bae38424691f14768aa	Not too old, but it will be harder for them to dominate like they did in 2008. They would definitely be an asset on the team all-around. They can also easily medal on individual events. But individual all-around might be difficult especially for Nastia who would be 22. Hopefully someone from the US wins that gold again...it would make it 3 straight for USA.|`|7uISqpLCaa	Shawn and Nastia want to compete in London 2012. so wait until 2012 and see if they do!

JGkYyIhJaa	Yes I did LOL I was thinking that since hes been lonely for so long he might feel on them
RS3fjNboaa	That's a tough one. He plays really inconsistent football. He can't get through a double team, and sometimes it's like he has no explosiveness. But at other times, he can't be stopped. I think it would take a strong coach and a good team captain to make him play his best. That rules out my Cowboys. We can't afford him, anyway.  <br>  <br>  Also, you don't know if he'll fit in with the Niners because they have a new HC. You don't know if he'll fit in with the Packers, because they are changing defense formats. Lots of variables here.|`|AA10348999	I think he would be a fine OLB in the 3-4 because he is a fantastic athlete with good instincts. Any potential trade is predicated on Peppers agreeing to terms on a contract prior to the trade which to me means you can pretty much count Dallas out of the running since they don't have a huge amount of cap space and have to save some for draft picks and attempting to extend Demarcus Ware. I think the only way Green Bay would pull the trigger is if they were willing to trade Aaron Kampman for Peppers since Thompson is a big fan of building through the draft and then it obviously wouldn't include a first round pick and instead perhaps a 3rd or 4th along with Kampman. Arizona or San Fran probably would love to have Peppers especially since they both run a hybrid system and Peppers could be played all over in such a scheme, but neither of them strike me as willing to give up a first rounder for him. As far as the AFC teams who run the 3-4 go there are just too many to figure on which Peppers wants to play for.|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	Dallas<br>  Washington<br>  Philadelphia<br>  Baltimore<br>  <br>  It was reported yesterday by ESPN that his four team list contained three NFC East teams and one AFC team. Since he has an attacking style, I would imagine that he would want to play in an attacking style also. I threw in Washington because everybody knows that they will get paid in Washington. New York makes no sense because they already have outstanding pass rushers. <br>  <br>  If I were Carolina nd he pushed the subject, I would trade him to St. Louis for their first rounder and a third round pick.|`|4TQiNW03aa	He's not going anywhere, they franchised him and i don't see anyone that would need him in a 3-4 giving up those draft picks to get him. It could happen though i suppose but I know the Packers won't try. They're already switching Aaron Kampman from DE to OLB and there's no way Ted Thompson will give up those picks for him. They've got enough experiments going on and they'll use the picks they have to fill more needs than just one. There's also no way they would trade Kampman for Peppers unless they were the ones getting more picks and they would have to be good picks at that. In there eyes Kampman would have more value than Peppers.|`|IoCK2bEnaa	I agree with Packers/49ers. But for the AFC i think he'd want to go to the Patriots. I think he'll get traded in the end to the packers. He's WAY too small to be a 3-4 Defensive end. he'll have to play OLB, in which case, i think he wont be great in coverage...|`|5btzOywVaa	I agree with your NFC choices. Patriots could use him. They're defense is getting old.|`|KNTofuxMaa	Didn't Carolina franchise him? I don't think anyone's going to pay that much for him and give up two first round picks. I think he's stuck in Carolina this year.|`|H1VIZsutaa	I think a wild card would be the Chiefs. They are re-building and need to sturdy up their defense, if no one else takes him, they might give them something of value.
IMQm9JTMaa	Yeah, I agree. He needs to be pushed. I mean the only matches he's getting is with at-least 4 wrestlers (tag team or more). He needs more singles matches, and the MITB would be a great start to this. Because he could use it at any time, any where, any wrestler's title he wants.|`|k8YSuKGpaa	I think it would be good to see a big guy like the Big Show in the Mitb match instead of all of the high fliers. This would add a little more contrast in styles to the match.|`|GJQIL0RZaa	Too fat|`|UzHt495Saa	i'd rather see BIG SHOW vs KANE in an Interpromotional Match at WM25.|`|D21xtjPPaa	actually i would like to see the big show in the money in the bank match at wrestle mania so he can clime the ladder and break it|`|85ecad91da4761d50060ea7e04b61701aa	Yeah big show really needs to be pushed back into main event status|`|pLYY0SlFaa	Evan Bourne for Money in the Bank|`|4tvI9WYjaa	the big show is not suitable for money in the bank and he is getting a push cause cena won't headline wrestle mania in a tittle match <br>  cause it seem that  the big show would be the right choice cause off right now since matt would face jeff and taker facing shawn michael's<br>  and no one on the smack down roster who bring in more hype in a big event then the big show is the 3rd choice.|`|BglekVnQaa	Big Show would just break the ladder or make it tip over.
FFE9Qztzaa	Can I just get the "10 " ..?<br>  <br>  ;p
k8YSuKGpaa	If the rock had stayed in wwe instead of going off to Hollywood, I think the wwe would be doing much better than it is. He has great ring skills, god-like mic skills, great charisma, and he can play both heel and face wonderfully. I think he could help push a lot of the younger talent. The younger fans would actually get to see him wrestle live, instead of having him wrestle on dvds and youtube videos. Having the Rock in wwe would only be beneficial. Plus he would not be considered a sellout, like some people think he is now. <br>  <br>  I wish he would come back, but I know that is very unlikely to happen.|`|TUURiVnraa	well the rock has all ways been one of my favourites so if he were to come back it would be good, yea he is good in hollywood but he was better as a wrestler, he could even do us all a favor and shut john cena up!!!|`|85ecad91da4761d50060ea7e04b61701aa	IF YA SMELLLLLLLLLLLALALALALALALALA WHAT THE ROCK............IS..........COOKING (eyebrow raises)<br>  <br>  <br>  Im not to sure if it would do a hell of alot actually considering WWE has had stupid story lines as of recent <br>  <br>  example:<br>  <br>  They Killed Chris Jericho's Character to build Batista's<br>  <br>  another example:<br>  <br>  they Made Edge's charecter abit over board and made him look incapable with all of the the outside interferance<br>  <br>  another:<br>  <br>  Cena -suppose supose to be superman something?

z7JsVzcnaa	Look at the NBA the last ten years.  The Spurs have won multiple titles.  Detroit won a title.  Boston last season.  Those teams were top defensive teams.<br>  <br>  Compare to teams like the Mavericks or the Suns who have come close with their awesome offenses, but never quite got there.<br>  <br>  Football tends to follow this trend as well.  The Patriots won their Super Bowls because they had incredible defenses.  Same with Pittsburgh and Baltimore.<br>  <br>  That's not to say that a team with a really good offense can't win it all, but defense is a greater determining factor than offense is.|`|LjqoMHMJaa	Absolutely. The Suns had a good offense for the last couple of years. They would win games. They had and still don't have good defense. They can't win a championship.
KDOIKIq2aa	20 gauge shotshells come in two lengths 2 3/4" and 3".  Since your barrel will accept 3" you can use both lengths of shells.<br>  <br>  Shotguns are versatile because they have a variety of different loadings on the small side you can get #9 shot working your way up to #1shot.  Above #1 shot you go into letters like, B, BB, F, T.  Bigger shot than that is called Buck Shot and can be had in 4 BK, 3BK, 1BK, OBK, OOBK, and OOOBK.  However 20ga buckshot can usually only be had in 3BK do to the size of the pellets fitting into the 20ga sized hull.  Above buck shot you can get a lead slug or even a sabot slug.<br>  <br>  Slug are for large game like Deer.  Buckshot is for Medium game or even protection.  A good skeet load could be anything from #7 1/2 shot down to #9 shot.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	Slug loads are one large chunk of lead, commonly a round nose design with a hollow base to keep it stable and point forward.<br>   <br>  Buck shot is the term for a large size lead pellet from about .24" (#4) to .35"(#000) diameter. Most common size for 20ga shells is either #2 or 3. <br>  <br>  Birdshot is all the smaller shot sizes from about .05"(#12) (under #9=0.08" is not common in factory loaded ammo except .22 rimfire shotshells) to .23"(#TT) most 20ga is going to be up to MAYBE BB size.<br>  <br>  For most uses you'll use lead shot. However for waterfowl(in the USA) you must use steel or another nontoxic shot. <br>  <br>  Skeet and other clay target sports shooting is mostly done with #7 1/2-10 shot sizes.|`|uChkvc5qaa	I use hollow point slugs in my 12 gauge for home security. Everyone else has given you the rundown on the different shots, so I will warn you about the slugs. If you have a choked gun then most likely it will say not for use with slugs on the barrel. Make sure your gun accepts slugs before using them. They are fun to destroy things with but not a good choice for skeet.|`|XC7qQJ0Haa	Buckshot is pellets, a slug is a solid load more like a bullet. Use buck or game loads for skeet.|`|TvARYVRJaa	skeet # 7.5 or 8 ss  slug  deer varmits  ets   sound like ya need a lil  studing ok thanks... shells come in 2/3/4 inch to 3 inch mags, both of which come in all shot sizes  and slugs and buck shot ok thanks|`|KMASS2Gmaa	20 ga shotgun shells come into two main stream lengths 2 3/4 or 3 in. A 2 3/4 in shell has 7/8 oz of lead. The 3 in has 1 1/8 oz of lead. The larger the number the smaller the pellets in a shot shell. This means more pellets in the larger numbers. IE # 8 is usually used to shoot skeet. Most people use 7 1/2 to 4 shot to hunt bird, squirrel, and rabbit.  Then you go to buck shot with the numbers being the same sort of pellet grading. IE #4 buckshot is about .22 cal balls and has from 23 to 26 balls depending on length. 00 buck balls are .32 cal. and run from 8 to 11 per shell depending length. Buckshot is used for larger animals.   A slug is used as for deer, hog or bear hunting. all of these shells must be aimed the pattern does not spread as much as people think.

Get a size 3 ball, for dribbling ONLY,  if you can master dribbling a smaller ball and keeping it to your feet, then once you get to the size 5 there should be no problems dribbling.  Shoot the ball right off you laces, that is the best way and if you get it just right you can make that thing knuckle.  Being someone who has played everything from forward to keeper, i never liked guys who could shoot the knuckle.|`|6uc8ROfWaa	do simple ball drills with both legs those help the most dont try fancy crap bcuz in a game u will jus do simple things|`|B4evWMcLaa	my friend, soccer is not a dribbling game its a passing game. you will get injured if you intend to dribble the ball. you need to stick to the basics, control and passing. once you learn to control and pass the ball well, hit me up and i'll let you know how to better your footwork (that you use only when necessary) and tell you the secret of shooting. (you don't have to have big legs or anything to shoot hard, its all about your technique)
MnjOXJnJaa	here's how i look at it- Brooks is going to be the starter for Houston, and there's a chance whoever picks him up will get solid production from him the rest of the year and he won't be become available again. if you drop Smith, there's a good chance he's added and dropped as a fill-in throughout the rest of the year unless he develops some consistency (don't see it happening) or there's another injury to give him more minutes. do it.|`|da6e80356582b46ab1025eb8248a43e0aa	yes do it now man brooks offers similar stats as jr smith ( more ast less rebs) but he is the one getting the playing time so yeah do it|`|oqQjnpfGaa	YES!!!!<br>  <br>  Brooks is the Starter PG for the Rockets, and played a great game today (19 points, 6 rebounds, 8 assists). <br>  <br>  JR Smith will be inconsistent as long as Carmelo Anthony is playing well.<br>  If you can deal with his irregular inconsistency then keep him, I will just cut him and get Brooks (with lots of upside).  Last advice, if you have someone worse than JR Smith, consider dropping that person instead.|`|dtiCJwDAaa	i think thats a good idea. smith is sooo inconsisent, it won't hurt u to see what brooks can do. i doubt smith would get picked up if it didnt work. maybe a loss in pts but both hit 3s and brooks can get asts|`|4zDzR8Sjaa	no
k8YSuKGpaa	because they don't care about brand restrictions anymore. It makes it difficult to keep track of which superstars belong to which brand. I believe this is the very reason why there is lack of competition among the brand, because the titles can go anywhere. I agee with you. This is total b.s.|`|Y32OY6PAaa	It will work out. its a storyline|`|W8SgRKo7aa	It's gay, hopefully mis and morrison loose the titles and Cryme Tyme bring it back to RAW! wheere they below.<br>  <br>  The WHC title was better on smackdown wwe title was more raw like.

But hey, if I had your car I'd be doing the same thing ;)  I'm in the process of buying an 86' Iroc-Z right now :)|`|c2GgYFzqaa	Helo there, Here in australia it is very illegal to drift on any public street, drifting is only allowed on racing circuts. Here in Australia your car would be in pounded.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Why are you asking in the cycling section.  Yes, you can get a fine for wreck-less driving.
48f05733ad5213c40c6efa92aa9ee2c0aa	I would highly recommend that you leave the handgun at home for the first 6 months of employment.  Then, try carrying it in the pocket of your overcoat.<br>  <br>  I used to have a CC permit and also worked for a business that allowed people to carry their guns concealed.  Ironically, the business I worked for had MACHINE GUNS in their offices, but one clown used to come to work with his 9mm pistol - just to show-off that he had a permit.  I was like, "What the hell.  If trouble broke-out in our high secure building, I would be reaching for one of the dozens of machineguns that we have on the premisis, not some stupid little pistol.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	First, you want to be sure that your new employer won't have a problem with you packing heat on the job.  Then, look for a holster to wrap around your abdomen, and buy some dress shirts with Velcro closures and dummy buttons.  (no, not "Obama/Biden" pins, though that could fool some potential assailants)  You may need to look at uniform or costume supply shops for these shirts.|`|AA11694178	Check the tactical gear section of such places as www.midwayusa.com or www.midsouthshooterssupply.com or any of the places that sell tactical gear.  There is an undershirt that is made specifically for carrying the type of gun that you are asking about.  You wear the undershirt just as you would any undershirt except this one has a pocket in it made specifically for carrying a concealed handgun.  They also make shirts with a hidden velcro panel under the breast pocket which you can open quickly to access your handgun that is in your hidden undershirt holster.  They also have shirts that look like a regular button up shirt but it has a velcro front that can be quickly torn open to access your handgun.<br>  <br>  Another form of deep concealed carry involves a holster that fits in your groin area under your pants.  No, I am not kidding, that is where you can carry your subcompact handgun if you wish.  It is sort of like a fanny pack that you wear inside your pants with the pouch in front.  You simply reach down in the front of your pants to access it.  If you thrust your hand down the front of your pants, you can easily access your gun (firearm).  This is a great way for joggers to carry a concealed weapon.  Imagine that you are standing at the urinal in a restroom and a bad guy decides to rob you.  Won't he be surprised when you turn around with a different gun in your hand than he is expecting.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	Consult a shop that carries conceal holsters to see what other types are available. If you are looking for one that doesn't show when the jacket is off, you may be stuck with an ankle type.|`|mqXyDTwwaa	You can try this: <a href="http://www.smartcarry.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.smartcarry.com/</a> It has some good reviews.|`|oYf3jSq6aa	Ankle holsters are one of the worst options for concealed carry<br>  In almost any instance that you would need your gun it would be too hard to get to and impossible to get to discreetly if you miss the first opportunity<br>  <br>  Get a pocket holster and either carry in your strong hand front pocket or in your back pocket like a wallet<br>  Or better yet pay the $5 tax stamp/transfer fee and get a wallet holster that allows the gun to be shot while still in the wallet<br>  <br>  Smart carry is a good option for your attire as would the elastic T-shirt with Velcro buttons|`|GmRscBkPaa	Well as soon as you take your jacket off, it effectively eliminates most practical options for concealment that would allow an effective quick draw.   So, the ankle is probably the way to go.  <br>  <br>  Sure you could rig up something to go under your dress shirt, or in a modified pants pocket, but you wont really be gaining an advantage over an ankle carry.<br>  <br>  I'd go behind the back, or IWB at hip, and keep the jacket on always.|`|KDOIKIq2aa	My first thought is a pocket holster like uncle mike's inside the pocket holster.   Believe it or not my brother carried a Ruger SP-101 .357 magnum in jeans with no problem!  <br>  <br>  My second suggestion is a belly band.|`|uChkvc5qaa	There is an undershirt with an elastic pocket under the arm. I have seen one and it looked like what your searching for. It would be a horizontal draw You can either leave a button undone or shred them to draw. It didn't look to breath well, so I wouldn't recommend it for a hot environment, but a climate controlled office would do just fine.<br>   <a href="http://www.kramerleather.com/productDetail.cfm?productID=65&categoryID=21" rel="nofollow">http://www.kramerleather.com/productDeta...</a>|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	A pocket holster works very well as long as the pants are loose enough to allow easy access but with deep enough pockets to keep it concealed. The other options are the belly band holster and the undershirt with integral holster under the arm.|`|DOCzFmHjaa	I us a pocket holster in my right front pocket. This has worked for my Kel-tec P 11, keltec 32 and my Ruger with no problem. Good luck.
ONuF4CjCaa	mate you are never to skinny to play nrl, but if you want to get bigger here are some options:<br>  <br>  don't eat any more junk foods<br>  balance your meals out so you don't just have a massive lunch and small dinner<br>  meats are always good to eat if you are wanting to eat healthy foods and get a bit bigger, preferably t-bone steak, sirloin steak, kangaroo meat etc.<br>  <br>  if you don't already have any, get a weights set or ask for one for your birthday or something, start off with hand held weights (dumbbells) and look on the internet for some basic workouts, then after a few months go heavier in weight and do more repetitions, also look into getting a weights bench.<br>  <br>  here are some exercises i use to build up shoulders and legs:<br>  <br>  Shoulders:<br>  shoulder press<br>  seated lateral raise<br>  shoulder raise<br>  barbell/dumbbell shoulder shrugs<br>  <br>  Legs:<br>  leg extensions<br>  leg press<br>  squats with barbell (if not using barbell do more reps)<br>  lunges with dumbbells<br>  calf raises<br>  <br>  if you are not sure what these exercises are, type them in google and you should get some websites showing how they are done correctly, or you can type them in youtube.<br>  <br>  hope that helped mate and good luck with your footy career :)|`|3lrXg6heaa	There's no size limitations, there is a position on the field for all shapes and sizes. If you are truly dedicated, then just keep fit, eat right, do a little bit of weights and exercises outside of training. Ask your coach about all the proper exercises, or better yet ask your trainer, as he has some knowledge in that area. Find out about a gym or something in your area and start going to that if you can afford it. But don't over do it and get yourself injured, make sure you learn the correct way to do weight training before doing it yourself|`|4eQqTiYwaa	Join the team first , thatll give u some training and ask your coach the things u should do and by the end of the year youll be bigger than willie mason<br>  <br>  well maybe not but still , join first|`|f9hiPMDxaa	You haven't said how old you are or in what competitions you play in.<br>  <br>  As the above user said, lay off junk food, keep your exercises up and follow a fitness regime.

Exercise regularly and don't worry about how skinny you are, and the rest will just fall into place.|`|HTulGtABaa	Join a team, the training will buff you up, eat alot of carbs and energy, do excessive training and watch yourself get bigger. The way you asked the question seems like your a young fella, so the sooner you join the better, the more experience and the more fit you get.

If they can even remotely psych you out, you've already lost and vice-versa. Remember that the rules favor the offense. Use that to your advantage. Try to draw the foul, show them that you aren't afraid to get physical.<br>  <br>  I was told this advice when i first started playing basketball. I wasn't aggressive at all, on either side. I followed through with this and it seriously helped boost my confidence. I started to become more aggressive because i started thinking that the opponent couldn't lock me down. Basketball is mostly a test of your mental toughness. If you can't think that you'll always beat the defense, you'll get shut down every time. If you think that you're unguardable, then play that way. Eventually it will, more or less, become true.

urqGJPwpaa	As a Laker fan, I really want to say Bynum.  But considering we still have the best record in the NBA, it really hasn't shaken us up too badly.  Amare wouldn't have helped the Suns go past the 1st round of the playoffs.  They are in a place where they can make the playoffs, but they aren't in if it were to start today.  Arenas is all about the money, his injury took place last season, and he waited until the start of this season to have surgery.  He could have had it during the off-season, but chose to wait.  Greedy and conceited.  Brand wasn't helping the 76ers one bit.  If anything, he made them worse.  He should have kept his word and stayed with the Clippers.  KG shouldn't be out too long, and even if he is, I still believe they're the 2nd best in the East.  They would keep the 2 seed and wouldn't play Cleveland for a long time, so he has time to heal.  Oden is injury prone, he didn't put up great numbers anyways.<br>  <br>  This brings me to my choice.  Mr. Carlos Boozer!  Although Utah can win without him, he brings so much to their team.  He is a big man who dominates almost anyone who guards him.  He helped the Jazz to the semi-finals last year, losing in 6 to the Lakers.  Without him, I don't see them being able to pass the Semis this year, maybe not even getting out of the 1st round (based on their seeding).|`|xhHfXuKFaa	if KG is out a long time then it will be his that's the biggest. and if the celts don't get best record then they have no chance at a repeat.|`|Vf0g0q8uaa	KG will not be the biggest loss, considering he'll only be gone for a few days or weeks.

He came out of retirement for them after almost 4 years out. If he didn't have that knee injury he could still be playing top draw football as he's only 35. Yh Van Bronckhorst is a very cool guy but grrr he signed for feyenoord again!! (ajax my favourite dutch team lol)<br>  Again Riquelme could easily be playing top football, I mean he has so much to give and is also one of my favourite players<br>  Also did you know that Cafu is playing for some club in Yorkshire that i've never heard of!

He was drafted by the Devils and played with the team his entire career up to the point of his departure.  I grew up watching him ever since I was very very young.  He was my favorite player, because when I met him for the first time he was so nice.  It was after a Devils practice, and most players either left or just signed autographs in their cars.  Niedermayer actually came out to talk to the fans, sign autographs, and take pictures.  He took a picture with me and put his arm on my shoulder and it felt really special that a big time hockey player would really take the time to meet the fans like that.   I was really young at the time, and I didn't even know he was a superstar.  I just liked him because he was really nice to me!  But as I got older I really started to appreciate his talent and what he meant for the Devils.  I nearly cried when he left :(  I really think Niedermayer would've had his number retired by the Devils if he stayed his entire career.  But he already won 3 Stanley Cups, so I understand that he wanted to play with his brother for the rest of his career.<br>  <br>  Rafalski went undrafted, and was discovered by the Devils out of Finland.  The Devils developed him, gave him a chance, and really turned him into the star he is today.  I also grew up watching him, so it was really sad to see him go.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	Terry.....what do you mean......briefly.....never wore the sweater? Of course he wore a Blues jersey.

lfhvNgSnaa	as for what to wear:<br>  no, spandex is not necessary, but it's nice. it makes it easy to move and get low without baggy shorts getting in your way. i hated the idea of spandex at first, but once you get them, you're never gonna want to play without them again. if you don't have spandex, just wear some shorter shorts, definetly above the knee. don't wear a tight shirt, a baggy one is more comfortable. it will alow you to move and you won't have to keep pulling it down or anything. knee pads are a MUST. gym burn is the worst, and without knee pads, you're likely to get it at some point. wear tennis shoes. coaches generally don't want you to wear street shoes on the court, so i have special shoes just for volleyball. make sure to bring a water bottle.<br>  <br>  you should know the basic terms:<br>  bump<br>  set<br>  hit/spike/attack<br>  serve<br>  <br>  always call the ball. motivate the team. etc. the coaches will teach you everything you need to know, and it's hard to explain it over the internet. good luck! have confidence, and most importantly.. HAVE FUN!|`|RIZqV5Zvaa	if you have spandex shorts wear them, if not just regular athletic shorts and a tee shirt.Wear knee pads. In- in the court. out- out of the court, easy.

Spiking is like this<br>  <a href="http://www.bam.gov/sub_physicalactivity/images/photo_stalls.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.bam.gov/sub_physicalactivity/...</a><br>  serving is a little hard at first, try underhand at first and line your hand up with the part of the ball that you pump air into and then hit. Also dont hit the ball twice when your playing a game.|`|DFUN42S9aa	you should wear sneakers, shorts(spandex are not needed), t shirt, and kneepads. Bring a water bottle or two. Just have fun and meet new people. The coaches will teach you every thing you need to know and do not worry because there are probable many others that have never played before|`|hb3bYaExaa	ive been playing for five years and i were spandex or short shorts ( above your knees and a baggier short sleeve shirt so it doesnt show sweat or constrict you but make you arms be able to move without getting caught in your shirt- knee pads and tennis shoes-- make sure you bring water bottle|`|IE2YbJr0aa	Here is what you need to know:<br>  <br>  To answer your first question, you can wear a t-shirt and maybe sophie shorts. That is what I usually wear.<br>  <br>  When you serve the ball ( if I were you I would start with underhand ), hold it low, swing your arm straight back, and hit it hard. For bumping the ball, make sure you get low and just pop the ball up. It is very simple once you get the hang of it. It might be too hard to explain how to hold your hands, but you can ask someone else that. For setting the ball, use your fingertips and push it high and forward. For spiking, when you jump up to spike, put BOTH arms up and swing with your right or left arm (depends on where the ball is). Remember to move your feet and call the ball by saying "mine" or "got it". Good luck!|`|sxUFsYE4aa	tshirt shorts tennis shoes knee pads basic serves passes sets mabey even spikes|`|wp2mIqTcaa	wear shorter shorts/spandex, t-shirt, and volleyball/tennis shoes. make sure you wear knee pads too|`|jwRcAOtfaa	wear shorts and definatly SPANDEX, bring sneakers and wear like a t-shirt and thats all i can say because i dont play

AA11780757	I think 2005 and anything before that was the best.<br>  The Attitude Era&The Monday Night Wars were the best.<br>  <br>  Now it seems all organized and with the WWE going<br>  more PG for the kids, it just doesn't feel the same.<br>  I still love it, but it's just not the same.|`|vzDzyRonaa	I don't watch it either.  I do however watch wwe on demand because of the older stuff.  By far the best era in wrestling.  Bischoff said it best "Every Monday night was the Superbowl!" <br>  <br>  Also.....what happened to tag teams?  Now there is only one or two prominent ones.
AA12040384	going to the games on a beautiful summer night and high-fiving people you don't know when someone hits a homerun and eating nachos in the 300-section where it is served to you and feeling the tension of a sweet pitchers' duel and screaming your guts out when that guy you don't like comes up to the plate.|`|CmdTQlEeaa	Baseball is the only sport that one person controls the whole game (well half of it really) and the pitcher can speed it up or slow it down whenever they want. In other words, mind games are going on the whole time.|`|oASdqh2Jaa	besides the game itself,<br>  the atmosphere of the ball park.<br>  being surrounded about people who just want the SAME exact thing that day-<br>  <br>  for our team to win<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Cubbies<3|`|GfXhyUBZaa	Baseball sucks.|`|jlKX6XfRaa	The hotdogs|`|TqQcB2gWaa	I like the left turns, just like Nascar|`|AA10356839	Good Pitching|`|biKMQ2I1aa	It entertains my bf so I can do other stuff|`|rHoOOV7Zaa	It depends if your playing or watching.<br>   If I was watching a baseball game, I enjoy the suspense and excitement you get from wondering what will happen next. It's also excellent to join together with other fans (this is usually if it's a professional team). Actually, when I was at a White Sox game in August, they got 3 home runs in a row and everyone around me was screaming and giving each other high fives. It was awesome.<br>   If I was playing baseball, it would be the determination you grow by wanting to win and have fun.|`|wSqDeNIOaa	The simple part of it.  The hand/eye coordination shown by the batter when a 90 mph fast ball is thrown at him...and he sees it...all the way to the bat, with the obvious result.  A blast over the center wall, enough to take him around the horn and home, along with his brothers that were on the bases, awaiting, as well, his response to such a high stress situation.  Most of the time, though, I love when the announcer says, "and that's the (boring) ball game!".  No matter what happens in any given game, I look forward to the next one available.|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	I love everything about baseball.  The pitching duels, the walk off hits, the records and stats.  I hate the Steroid heads that are ruining the hallowed records of the legends of the game.|`|FQkG7Olxaa	Getting to assault fans and reporters. Also, throwing stuff into the stands. That is what I will miss about playing baseball.|`|FfGIZe7jaa	I play baseball and I pitch and have hit many home runs and I find that hittng home runs and striking out the side are equally exiciting.|`|1VvIANPFaa	The excitement of when you team scores or wins a big game|`|a7AatQcEaa	I like the players love for the game.|`|s5dspNk5aa	the witty banter of Len and Bob.|`|gCLWLNBnaa	the home runs of course|`|c6q3EERdaa	Man... I can't name just one. I like all the aspects equally - the sights, the sounds and all. Baseball as a whole is one of the best sports out there. Hard to pick just one aspect, at least for me.|`|ckkUd0Uuaa	I never thought baseball was meant to be enjoyed.|`|6tGYe5roaa	I love the atmosphere. I find baseball games to be the best to attend live out of all the other sports. Nothing is better than going to a game, a summer evening with a bunch of your friends/family. Making friends with other fans around you. Just having fun and enjoying a ballgame. Makes it even better if your team wins. <br>  <br>  Also, as for the game itself, I love the anticipation. I know that people tend to dislike how slow-paced baseball can be but I love it. The build-up between every pitch. There is so much going on that I don't think a lot of people even realize.|`|8jxoTBWIaa	The part where everyone around me watches it and I have some alone time since I hate it =]|`|H7ENkTxaaa	I like playing it, but I can't watch a game on T.V. for more than a few<br>  minutes.|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	everything :)
ptQ5SkPVaa	I like MVP whether he's face or heel. He deserves a bigger push. His gimmick is over with fans. He has great in ring ability. I hope he gets a decent chance at the Title soon.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	I like it. I was skeptical at first of how hed get over as a face, but so far hes proven me wrong. Hes really over as a face right now and its working out well.|`|ywU3ZpIgaa	i like it and the fans seem to be behind him too so maybe if we wait long enough he will get his big push(hopefully)|`|fvMv1DT3aa	I like him better as a heel, but I still think he is a great wrestler and deserves a bigger push. It's kind of weird seeing him getting cheered for by the fans just because I am so used to him getting booed. Hopefully MVP will be the next US Champion.|`|qE8olVtaaa	I think its quite interesting, I never really thought he'd ever be a face cos he was WAY too cocky as a heel, but I like this new gimmick of his|`|w2nMrQzwaa	i like it, and can see a good feud coming up between him and Shelton Benjamin for the US championship|`|HHpVBoTuaa	Time for a change. Everybody gets that switch every now and then. It's str8, i'm just used to people booing him all the time.|`|h8dHAhxCaa	As much as most people would want that    it wouldn't go over well     it might just ruin him completely    but who knows it could happen|`|nm16oIc9aa	yea he has awesome in ring ability he definitely needs a push

q0rDcTSRaa	C) Dallas had the best record in the NBA 67-15. Dirk Nowitzki was the named the NBA MVP. Everyone was picking them as the favorite to win the NBA Title in '07. That is the biggest upset in NBA history in my opinion. Dallas just could not match up with Golden State and unfortunately they loss in the first round. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|43daa72d6abd58775d0e46a24824eddeaa	i'd say C. but the play-off game between the rockets and the mav's comes close. the rocket's were up 3 games to 0, and in the final game they got drubbed by 40!...now that's a play-off *** wooping!|`|z5rlyGXNaa	Boston winning the Championship last year|`|L0ft1eo7aa	C cause no one gave them a fighting chance against the MAVS|`|WK3Kx4Mkaa	when the celtics came back from a 30 something point behind and they came back and won|`|LCV8Aky2aa	Id say the one with Dallas in 2007.

Sports Illustrated called it the greatest sports moment of the twentieth century. It is hard to imagine how the Americans won given how overmatched they were. The other examples you give were just unlikely wins by teams in the same league as their rivals. In 1980, the Soviets were in a class by themselves having beaten even NHL teams.<br>  <br>  However, the Americans did not win on a last second goal.

YCwmCDkUaa	lol...cancellation prize...ummm...consolation...<br>  <br>  The Raven pick was more costly because it, in effect, ended the game.

The Ravens with <br>  a. only other team to lose to the eventual Super Bowl champs.<br>  <br>  the chargers, ravens, and cardinals all lost to the steelers<br>  <br>  b. having the 1st rookie quarterback in a Championship game.<br>  <br>  thats pretty good<br>  <br>  2.The Cardinals with their 1st Superbowl appearance<br>  <br>  this is a lot harder to achieve, the ravens have been consistently better, the cardinals just got hot at the right time, so for the cards to limp into the playoffs at 9-7 and be able to eliminate the falcons, the brutal panthers, pesky eagles, and keep up with the best defense in the league says a lot, i think they got a better prize|`|tPaRZod9aa	The Polomalu int. because that was near the end of the game. Harrisons pick happened before half, so there was still more game to be played, as the cardinals showed us.<br>  <br>  I dont like to predict the 'what ifs' though. 'What if' the steelers didnt pick off warner and the cardinals scored? Because we dont know if that would have led to an insprational speech by tomlin and the steelers woould score 40 points in the next half. Thats why I think The int. at the end of the game is more crucial. Because you have little room for 'what ifs'.|`|ltDPK4UFaa	I think it was the Harrison pick in the Super Bowl. That pick all but took the momentum from the Cardinals, yeah the Cards tied it up later in the 2nd half, but things could have been much different if Arizona at the very least tied it up..would have changed everything in that game.  <br>  <br>  The Baltimore drive..there's no guarantee that the Ravens would have scored anyway.  As much as I like Flacco, it just didn't have the confidence that he would be able to complete drive.|`|ABoo1doVaa	Ravens gave up the bigger pick, and Cardinals making it to the Super Bowl.<br>  <br>  The Cardinals had plenty of time to make up for that Harrison pick and not tackling the guy was more a problem. As for consolation prize, it's much better to make the Super Bowl than the Championship game.

Now that may not seem like a special thing, but the fact is that Kiner really had some great, great stories about the 'old days' in baseball, but he never really had the speaking skills to tell them.  Thankfully, McCarver was able to draw out these stories and I think the baseball world is a better place for his efforts.  <br>  <br>  You may not agree with me on this, but no matter what he's done since, Tim McCarver will always have a spot in my baseball heart.  <br>  <br>  As for Joe Buck, I don't think he's very good at anything besides being a huckster for the Faux network.|`|xZK4dIHxaa	both equally suck major league *** <br>  When McCarver joined the Giants brodcast team very briefly I<br>  almost $h^t my pants he talks like he's teaching baseball to 5yr olds<br>  and his hair dye job sucks!!!<br>  <br>  Joe Shmuck  dont get me started.

r5AMG8g7aa	Anytime you face a knife it should be because there is no other way out. The chance of not getting at least cut is extremely low. However if you must get cut it is better to get your arms cut than to take a stab to the body. Stabs to the body are a lot more likely to be fatal. I won't go into a lot of explanation that will do you no good.  Suffice it to say that if someone does not care if they kill you it is easier for them to kill you first and then take your money, if that is what they are after.  Anyone with a knife, trained or untrained is dangerous. However, a real knife fighter will not let you see the knife coming. They will get close, cover your vision with one hand while stabbing fatally with the knife. you will never see it coming.<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW  Why do you have your email, and Q & A concealed from view. What are you trying to hide?<br>  <br>  EDIT: Obviously some of you did not read my statement about a real knife fighter. You will never know you are being attacked until you have already been stabbed fatally. Of course there are a lot of idiots out there carrying a knife. An idiot is dangerous. An idiot with a knife is even more so.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	you can't learn knife defense in a few short classes. <br>  as you found out someone with a knife is not just going to sit there. they are going to slash and stab at you multiple times from various angles.<br>  <br>  i have had been sliced up using them in the street. there is no guarantees you are not going to get cut anyone that can guarantee you that is out right lying to you or has never been in the situation before.<br>  <br>  most people that teach this teach to grab at the wrist, when you grab the wrist the fist closes more or tighter because of the muscle group you are grabbing, if you grab just below the elbow it help to loose the grip more.<br>  there is no easy way of doing it just a lot of reputation, that and studying arnis or kali helps too. there techniques are much better for this and prepare you more<br>  <br>  i discourage defense against knifes and guns this is to be done as a last resort and shouldn't be taken lightly.<br>  the best defense is to give them your money or run for it|`|tZXHSxkQaa	That is the better way to practice,nobody is going to come at you like another student in class would.When someone attacks with a knife,they will only have so many angles and motions(slashing moves,stabbing thrusts).Stay back from them,keep from possibly being cut until you can judge how and when they will attack next.Use any item you may find to block the knife like:trash can lids(the metal ones would be better),wooden crates or milk crates,2x4 etc.Get the knife away from them,no matter what.Practice the knife defense techniques.There is a book on this.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	running|`|w9kSGLBxaa	WOW, haven't seen you here in some time. <br>  <br>  Yeah that is a problem with a lot of self defense classes now a days, They do not train with live attackers. Just the patterns alone are worthless. You have to have some one trying to stab you. Keep doing this with your friends and you will get better. <br>  <br>  Q. How do you survive a knife attack?<br>  <br>  A. Do not get stabbed!<br>  <br>  Q. Any tips on defense against a knife?<br>  <br>  A. Keep doing what you are doing with your friends and incorporate what you have learned in your self defense class and try to make it work for you.|`|S6FLJ64Qaa	In real life, you must accept the fact that you will probably get cut.  geting cut does not automatically equate with not surviving.  There is a huge difference in getting cut on the forearm or hand compared to getting stabbed in the chest or kidney.<br>  <br>  with this in mind, when there is a knife involved in the attack, you must treat this as a life and death situation.  (Because it is.)  When you strike, you strike to kill....period.  When you move in for a joint lock...you break that bone....period.  <br>  <br>  Don't be fooled by movies, knives are just as deadly as a gun.<br>  <br>  You could also, simply run away until you have an advantage.  (This is my preferred technique.)|`|BbK0fA4Laa	Grab the wrist and step to the side while holding the persons wrist. That is somewhat dangerous as your hand could become cut. At least the knife wont be thrusted into your side or straight on though.<br>  <br>  You can also slap the person's hand out of the way. That's also dangerous, but with enough practice it can be an effective technique.<br>  <br>  An arm lock works sometimes. That however, needs some training and practice to perfect too.<br>  <br>  I would suggest learning some Filipino Martial Arts if you want good defensive skills in this area. The Filipino Martial Arts specialize in this kind of stuff.|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	Shoot first, ask questions later.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, use your environment for protection, use any extra clothing you have (like a jacket) to wrap your arm up.  Let's face it, if some guy comes at you with a knife you will get cut.  It's getting past that and resuming your defense until he's neutralized that counts.|`|13360f8150c9715c66a1ecb9c2002c6aaa	HTTP:WWW.JISSENMAG.COM/<br>  volume 4 article "the myth of the quick kill" it's free to download and it is not going to teach you to defend against a knife just show you how hard it is to do and attitude you must have.<br>  <br>  I think the 1st answerer got the percntages wrong I think it's o%|`|szcA8CDyaa	Dodge, grab their wrist, push it down with your other hand using your elbow, knee their rib or rib cage, pull the knife out from the enemy's hand, kick them while in the ground and finish them with any deadly moves.|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	Damn too many good answers already. <br>  <br>  My advice is to just keep practicing till you get it.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Zenlife has a point, but running is not the same as respecting and understanding the importance of distance.  A knife has a relatively short range, unless it is thrown, and so long as you keep out of striking distance, you can avoid getting cut.  When your opponent lunges, or strikes at you with a stab or a cut, avoid it if you can, close and grapple, trying to disarm the attacker with a lock or blow.<br>  <br>  It is not a pleasant or enjoyable activity defending yourself against a knife welding opponent, and a kick or block is an "iffy" proposition that involves the likely hood of you getting cut.  By putting something between you and your attacker, you decrease the effectiveness of the weapon somewhat, but the danger is at best not worth the confrontation if it can be avoided.  Distance doesn't have to be great, just enough to prevent the blade from scoring on you, so movement and terrain play significant roles.  On the street, a telephone pole, a auto, even another person (I once threw a third person into a knife welding attacker), what ever is handy.<br>  <br>  The key is to not be where the blade strikes, then be quick enough to respond with some kind of counter in a effort to disarm the opponent.   My son can snap arms with a key lock from a standing position with some impressive speed, but doing it to a knife welding attacker is still risky business, and the move requires explosive quickness, any hesitation and you are going to get cut.  Always attack the weapon, not the individual welding it, and remember that retreat is an honorable, intelligent response to a weapon.  There are many dead and crippled hero's whose bravery was never questioned.  I would rather be an intact fighter who avoided a blade, than a cut fighter who took it away from the attacker.<br>  <br>  Anything that can increase your reach, a stick or striking instrument that can be employed against the knife is a help, but any one who tries to block or defend against a knife will eventually get cut, it's only a matter of time.  If you can run, by all means, do so.  If you are lucky enough to grasp the knife welding arm before you get cut, you have some grappling options to disarm the knife welder, but the odds are heavily in your attackers favor, so I advise confrontation only when retreat is impossible.<br>  <br>  Look for escape, a weapon to counter the knife, or favorable terrain if possible.  I once jumped from desk to desk in a closed room against a knife welding attacker as he slashed at me, forcing him to go around the desks while I jumped over them.  A lot depends on where the attack occurs as to what you can do.  Trees, poles, fences or stairs can all be used to some effect against a weapon, but again an unarmed man against a weapon is eventually going to get injured if any real amount of time is involved in the confrontation.<br>  <br>  Great question, but life is not Hollywood, most knife fights are over within 10 to 15 seconds, so options are limited to the circumstances in which they occur.|`|HtaO5Uu6aa	If you are not a well trained fighter then Run if you are a well trained fighter i still recomend you run.<br>  Unless the person is severly handicapped you will be cut or stabbed id say more than once it may not be fatal but if you do not wish to be cut or stabbed at least once than run.<br>  If i had to face a knife attack and running was not an option i wud use Leg Kicks And and swift Front Kicks any upper body attack would not be a good result for me.

I would suggest you keep taking knife defense lessons but the best way to get good at knife fighting and defense is to actually do just that. The lessons will come in handy, but if you dont spar and make real life scenarios with your friends it wont help much.|`|rh4MS9Rvaa	try to throw as much junk at them as u can. they only have one knife u can grab any thing sticks rocks (big ones) kicks blocks. but the best way is to keep your mind cool so you can think before you act. it makes it easier to stop him.|`|c73AAq22aa	ok just grab there hand then kick them pretty hard to disarm them<br>  and take it before they grab it again|`|a954809e4f18646ae09e77b29aee6dbfaa	block,  right cross. draw gun point and fire|`|9b5QUw2eaa	90% of blackbelts would tell you they could disarm someone their own age, size, and strength.  I would think that number would probably be somewhere closer to 4% mark.<br>  <br>  Use your environment.  If you can throw furniture, new paper stands, trash cans, or anything else to create distance that will help.  Kick to create distance.  Protect your neck, face, groin, torso, and upper legs.<br>  <br>  You're really at a disadvantage against an armed opponent.  You are doing the right thing practicing with a rubber knife.  You need to constantly practice that way over and over to get good at knife defense.  When you get better, move to a wooden knife, so there is more motivation to be successful in your defense.<br>  <br>  Also work keylocks, hammer locks, and kimoras from all positions.  Most people only teach them from a mounted or side mounted position because that's how you use them to win an MMA competition, but practice them in standing, seated, and with someone on top of you positions.|`|LUnscegvaa	The obvious answer is to run away. other than that.<br>  <br>  With sheer luck I'd say...<br>  <br>  The best dvd I've seen addressing the subject is,<br>  <br>  <a href="http://store.jimwagnerrealitybased.com/knifedefensedvd.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://store.jimwagnerrealitybased.com/k...</a><br>  <br>  I own this dvd and its the best training i've seen and would personally love to attend a seminar.<br>  <br>  Best wishes :)***

And plus, didn't the Thunder beat the Lakers? And the Celtics?? And yet, the Suns can blow them out? Come on... got some mad haters in this section. I will say that they are back and I actually think what happened to Amar'e will benefit us. This team is loaded with talent and now the bunch has to step up (which they did tonight) and do their job. Doing that gains their confidence and we'll make the playoffs for sure. Once playoffs come, Amar'e comes back, bench players become better players because of playing time and the team improves. Sure, they may not win as much games with Amar'e out but this will benefit the other players. With their starters, their bench (lots of talent - watch them play) and Amar'e back going back to their running style... watch out, this team is dangerous.<br>  <br>  Everyone did the same thing about the AZ Cardinals too (saying no chance in playoffs especially with Boldin missing some games) in football and what happened?

You can sorta simulate uppercuts, but ONLY uppercuts, and anyone that shadowboxes can't resist throwing all the punches.  Don't do it, and if you do do it, don't blame me for not warning you.|`|R7ukUr2caa	I remember hearing about practicing your punches with very light weight can increase your speed.<br>  <br>  As far as power goes, honest I don't think there's too much difference.

c4d3e30573f7765b16b9bbddef2168d6aa	I think the formula you want to use is the momentum not force.  when you figure out mass x acceleration you are actually finding the force you are using to get your arm moving.  you are looking for mass x velocity which will give you how much momentum you are transferring over to your opponent.<br>  <br>  And I would not use dumbbells because object in motion stays in motion.  And when your fist stops your wrist is taking all the momentum that the weight still has. (this will destroy your wrist over time.)  If you really want to put some power to your punch try working with cables.  just put the cable around a heavy or stationary object and punch away.  because there are no weights involved you get the same benefit as the dumbbell without damaging joints. (ps don't use cable machines they also have weight so they will be just as damaging to you and the machine)|`|4YXBr0oDaa	f=ma or force equals mass multiplied by the accellaration of said mass.<br>  <br>  this builds up your muscles so as you punch at normal speed with dumbells and at lightspeed without.

This was so ahead of its time, and was a serious threat during WW1 and WW2.  <br>  <br>  Commonly know as a trench gun, it was outfitted with a heat shield, and a bayonet.<br>  <br>  Police used it as a riot shotgun, and it was affectionately called the knuckle buster because if you were not careful, the top slide would back and hit your thumb knuckle.<br>  <br>  I am not sure that I would pay 200 for it though. I mean if you value it because it is a nice historical piece, and you wish to collect it, fine. But this is the hunting section, and if I were to buy a shotgun for 200, it would most likely be a Used Remington 870, or Mossberg 500. <br>  <br>  Please don't miss-understand.

8Pw7ujG0aa	By some fans he probably will be regarded as a united legend, but not by all. For me, he certainly wont be in the same bracket as those other players you have mentioned.<br>  He has done a lot for us, especially last season, and he is a magnificently talented player, there is absolutely no doubt of that, but his personality and behaviour are at times very distasteful and being british we don't tend to warm to people like him. If he was an american athlete they would probably love him over there, because they buy into the ****-sure attitude that some athletes have more than we do. Here we favour the more humble man whereas maybe in the USA they take to the 'show man', which ronaldo certainly is, more willingly than us.<br>  Of course im generalising, and not all americans will like ronaldo, but i think a much greater percentage of americans would take to him than the percentage of british people that have.<br>  so in short, yes he will be a legend for his contributions to the club, but not to the degree that Best, Cantona, and Keane are.|`|MUERDKyzaa	Im not a Man U fan and you may be surprised to hear that i don't like c.ronaldo, lol.

YrxLbfiIaa	The security models have shorter barrels and a larger magazine capacity than the field models.....<br>  <br>  Actually if you put them side by side with a Mossberg 500 there isn't much difference.... Just the safety is in a different spot.......|`|lmWqwpygaa	Not familiar with either gun. <br>  But.............a field model is made for hunting, and probably has a longer barrel. A security model will have a shorted barrel and may have a shortened or modified stock.|`|lT8MEI6Raa	The only difference is the length of the barrel. The field model is a 28" barrel with a modified choke, the security model is 18.5" with a cylinder bore choke.

An one pound cannon ball sinker is bigger than a golf ball but smaller than a tennis ball.  A 1oz cannon ball sinker is slightly bigger than a marble.|`|Rq0Ni0Ncaa	Unlikely most likely 1 oz. It should say somewhere on the ball itself.
Ucbnl7VJaa	It depends on the dimensions of the stock where the pad would be fitted. For a grind-to-fit pad take off the existing pad/plate and use a ruler to get a close enough measurement to purchase the proper size.<br>  With a slip on type pad you'll probably need a medium but different models may fit better with a large or small.|`|bgxYKsGiaa	medium

q2TOb6unaa	The best glove brand is Dakine by far. If it gets colder than -10C I would go with the Dakine Cobra glove and for warmer days I would use the Dakine Bronco although I bet you can manage with either one as long as it doesn't get too hot/cold. <br>  <br>  I swear by the Cobra because it's a quality glove every year and it hasn't let me down yet. Even check out other reviews on it.

Ac8QOD7Saa	I think they are about equal.  It is like comparing Eminem to Tupac.  John Cena like Eminem has more wide appeal because not many white guys can freestyle.  But at the same time R-truth like tupac has really been in the rapping game a long time.  So, it virtually experience in the business vs wide fan appeal.  Both are important but success is success regardless of how it is achieved so in that, they both win|`|lGIL36faaa	definetely cena!|`|C1NgHyu4aa	They both are wrestlers I mean what do you want me to say that they are like Ne-Yo or something|`|hoZxIQkkaa	lol R-Truth only says Whats UP.

NJMzhcKhaa	It's the sad reality of american media, when indecent behaviour got rewarded more than decent people.<br>  I still remember the whole couple of weeks when medias are having Paris Hilton in/out of jail as their main news, I mean what is wrong with those people in the editing room, do they think americans are all morons or what.<br>  <br>  Same as Junie Browning, Dana White is a sad *** excuse of a boss. I remember him swearing and acting like a wise-*** when Noah and Marlon Simms was fighting in the house during TUF 5. He was giving lecture that he fought hard to make UFC a legitimate sport and those people are real athletes not punks.<br>  If that's the freakin case, then I think he should kick punks like Junie Browning. Who needs more punks in MMA.<br>  <br>  By all means, that kind of act does not belong in the MMA sport. It belongs in WWE where the dramas and being an asshole is expected and appreciated.<br>  In a sport, only skills suppose count, not the big mouth.|`|Vrd8gB61aa	no he just sucked<br>  <br>  now he looks decent|`|AA11101806	he knew if he was obnoxious he would get more camera time, and depending how things went through taping he would have a better chance of being on the main card in the finale.|`|rRjoTno7aa	YES, I also noticed he copied Leben's painting your pinky finger and toes black with nail polish.

Maybe the adjustment was just to much for him. Who knows? O-lines are some of the most inconsistent things in the league. They can be great one year, and terrible the next. I try not to blame things on them, but the big guys up front are crucial in a qb's developmont no question.|`|YdGtwBxMaa	He was a bust simply because anybody who puts on a Detroit Lions jersey is doomed from the start.|`|LvWIIJD7aa	theres always a qb in every draft that is a bust this year will be mark sanchez|`|8KmGcTW8aa	A QB needs to have a go to guy on the field on most plays. If they don't have one then they are screwed.|`|SLPbJO3kaa	College and NFL are very different games.  A lot of players can't make the transition.  That is why Big Ten teams and other teams that run pro-style offenses constantly produce NFL players.  However those teams aren't always the most successfull at the college level against more college style teams.  For example, OSU vs. UF and LSU.

edb07a9db62327095c9b76a75342f5d5aa	Although he had several teachers, Chojun Miyagi was a student and the successor to Kanyro Higaonna in Naha-Te. It was not until 1927 that Miyagi Sensei first applied the name Gojuryu to his style of Naha-Te. He did make at least two trips to China, and had a good friend who was a Sifu in White Crane. Naha-Te and subsequently Gojuryu were both influenced by southern Chinese styles of kempo and White Crane.<br>  <br>  Gojuryu.net has a lot of good information on our style.<br>  <a href="http://gojuryu.net/" rel="nofollow">http://gojuryu.net/</a>|`|13360f8150c9715c66a1ecb9c2002c6aaa	call sign got it right .There are kata in goju ryu that fukien white crane kung fu practioners recognize as very sinilar to theirs .Not surprising as this kung fu style was learnt by many okinawan masters.|`|nRBC4E5saa	It's "Goju-Ryu" and "Miyagi".<br>  <br>  It's not a mixture of anything.  It's Chojun Miyagi's interpretation of Naha Te, an older karate form.|`|r5AMG8g7aa	As callsignfuzzy stated the style is Goju-Ryu and the person you mention is Chojun Miyagi. The origin of Goju are subject to debate. Different text books credit different sources as the origin. Noe text mentions white crane and Tiger style. Others mention Naha-Te and others. Kanryo Higionna is also credited with its origin. Perhaps some of the GoJu instructors on Y/A can tell you in better detail.

I have not tested the noise with any equipment, just my personal observations from what is left of my hearing)|`|EGe0k8P6aa	You can safely fire .22 shorts in a rifle or pistol chambered for .22 LR. However a .22 short will not generate enough power to cycle the action of a semi-automatic .22. You'll have to manually chamber a round with each shot.|`|bgxYKsGiaa	they only work with 22 lr s because there semi-auto and cant load but rifles can because they are manually works and semi automatic rifles wont shoot long or shorts|`|fC64C0diaa	If you're talking about the Walther P22 is only shoots .22lr.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	No.  They wouldn't generate enough recoil to cycle the action properly.<br>  You don't want to mess with suppressors until you check the local laws regarding ownership of such things, and go through the BATFE approval process to get one.|`|AA12034449	NO. if you could get shorts to feed out of the magazine they would not have enough pop to cycle the action anyway.<br>  LONG Rifle only

You're right, no driver is perfect, they all make mistakes.   But I seriously doubt you can find many drivers who have made 2 errors on pit road in the same race.  At least not drivers who have been voted most popular driver for 6 straight years.   Jr is a decent driver at best, but if a non Nascar fan were asked who the best driver was for the last 3 years, most likely they'd say Jr, and they would have to ask who Jimmie Johnson is.   I'd say him screwing up 3 times in one race is the most newsworthy thing Jr has done in the past 3 years.|`|8Z3PEaGeaa	Most people need to realize that there are 2 drivers per car so to speak.

First of all there's an old saying ~ "If ya don't make any mistakes you're not doin anything". This he said, pointing fingers is crap. Those drivers are the ones who need to take a look at themselves, and be willing to own up to their mistakes. None of them wear halos or walk on water so until then I don't see them as perfect. I'm in total agreement that most of the comments here were from strangers. I also think most of this started from a few comments by DW during the race. Whatever the reason or who said what, I think most of the comments and media attention was inappropriate. Like I said when this crap happened, the Junior Haters were gonna have a field day with it and they are. It just keeps goin on & on and I'm tired of hearing about it. I answered this question because it's your question. To anyone who thinks that Junior is the first driver to make multiple mistakes in the pits in one race, I say, better read up on  your statistics, it's happened before and to some of the best drivers and it will happen again. These drivers are human beings, they will make mistakes. Everyone has their own opinion but when you say something and don't have the facts right, it's best to just be quiet. I agree with my sister Maggie....The answers from total strangers need to be ignored. Have a great weekend Nation & good luck to everyones driver. Elliott is gonna win!|`|i8soZLfRaa	No he's not perfect. Most of his mistakes seem to happen during commercials, when "X" channel is watching Jr doing something unremarkable, or whenever I run outside to grab a smokey-treat. When I come back or coverage returns, he's a lap down. I sit there scratching my head and asking "What the $!#@$ happened to my boy, he was in the top 5 three minutes ago?" Same thing happened last week, except they couldn't ignore him completely, because he started outside the pole. I usually have to go to one of the leaderboards to find out, because "X" network seemingly ignores everyone not in the top ten for most of the race, unless the few "chosen ones" are struggling for whatever reason.<br>  <br>  By the way, I'm not a Jr basher/hater. In fact, I kinda like him. It's not his fault the media follows him closer than his own shadow.<br>  <br>  "X"= all the networks that carry NASCAR, they're all equally guilty of what I'm saying.<br>  <br>  Hmmff, there I'm through venting.|`|Vfm7w7nNaa	Far from perfect.BUT, the driver I like didn't have the last name of a famous Father who people worshipped.The driver I like had to EARN his fame by WINNING races,not because of his last name. Oh yeah, and the driver I like also won 2 Nascar Cup Titles.<br>  <br>  And yours?|`|YHYT8qMKaa	Nope, he isn't. He has caused a few crashes in his career. He accidentally turned teammate Ken Schrader around at Talladega in 1995, which sent Schrader flipping upside down. Everyone makes mistakes. No one is perfect in life.|`|lKpeXCLGaa	Nobody is perfect, everyone makes mistakes.<br>  <br>  In the last line Wedge, you said Tony made a mess in Dega by trying to put his car where it didnt fit..... Are you saying maybe Tony needs some lessons from Kyle Busch?|`|Cf7rZsyzaa	probaly the best question i've seen 2nite, stick it to the trolls man. your right no driver is perfect.|`|MYC6Xv1Xaa	No driver is perfect.|`|a1gSZzoyaa	My driver, Kasey Kahne, isn't perfect but he is pretty close.

fdf78d43fe1121f9be25f88e4fef9e3baa	OK, you say you know how to paint your bike but rather than editing my common answer here is everything...<br>  <br>  The best paint to use at home for a bike is Duplicolor lacquer available at most auto parts stores, but you'll need more than just a can of paint to do the job!<br>  <br>  Painting a bike well takes a bit more than a whim, a 6 pack, and a weekend. Do it right and it will look great, do it wrong and you'll wish you never did it.<br>  <br>  This answer is long but will give you an idea of what to do. Want a quick answer? Take the bike to an auto body shop and have them do it. It'll cost about $100 if YOU take the bike apart.<br>  <br>  Use DUPLICOLOR brand LACQUER available at most auto parts stores. If you are in the UK, I don't know if the brand exists so you'll need to locate a brand of acrylic lacquer. DO NOT BUY ENAMEL OR URETHANE! <br>  <br>  You'll need 1 BIG can of grey sandable primer , 1 can of base coat (if the color requires it... many do... read the can), 1 BIG can or 2 SMALL cans of the color you want, and 2 or 3 BIG cans of clear LACQUER.<br>  <br>  Here is a quick explanation of what to do...<br>  <br>  1) After completely disassembling the bike have it sandblasted to remove ALL the finish. If the frame is aluminum, it should be walnut shell blasted, or you can chemically strip the paint. Just make sure all the paint is OFF the bike. <br>  <br>  2) READ THE CAN INSTRUCTIONS, then spray it as soon as possible with grey SANDABLE lacquer primer. DUPLICOLOR brand paint is all lacquer, I think, and you can get it from your local autoparts store. Buy the BIG cans, not the small ones. Apply at least 1 full can, in coats, 15 minutes apart. Don't worry about light runs for now.<br>  <br>  3) Wait at least 48 hours. There is a difference between dry paint and cured paint... it needs to be cured. Sand the primer using 220 grit aluminum oxide paper (white in color) or wet/dry paper (black in color) until the surface is smooth. It shouldn't take much unless you have a lot of runs.<br>  <br>  4) Using a tack rag, lightly go over the entire frame (don't rub!) to remove the sanding dust.<br>  <br>  5) Apply several coats (3 or 4 perhaps) of the base color (if necessary), then color of your choice. Make sure the frame is completely covered, it is not necessary for the color to be on thick. Follow the directions on the can. Again, use LACQUER, the same brand that you used for primer. Apply coats 1/2 hour apart. Be sure you cover every part and do NOT get runs. If you get runs you are applying it too heavily.<br>  <br>  5a) IF you wish to add decals, wait at least 8 hours, apply the decals, then continue. Make sure that you avoid touching the new paint as much as possible and to make sure there are no marks from water or "sticky stuff" on the frame. If you don't want to add decals, continue immediately to the next step WITHIN 24 HOURS...<br>  <br>  6) Do NOT sand the color coats. Apply the LACQUER clear coats, perhaps 2 full cans worth, coats 15 minutes apart. If you put decals on you should spray at least 4 cans of clear. <br>  <br>  7) Let the frame alone until you can't smell the paint anymore when you get up close and take a big whiff.

fdf78d43fe1121f9be25f88e4fef9e3baa	Painting the frame, fork, and bars is one thing but I would STRONGLY suggest that you do NOT try to paint the rims. It is a tough job even for those that know what they are doing...<br>  <br>  Painting a bike well takes a bit more than a whim, a 6 pack, and a weekend. Do it right and it will look great, do it wrong and you'll wish you never did it.<br>  <br>  This answer is long but will give you an idea of what to do. Want a quick answer? Take the bike to an auto body shop and have them do it. It'll cost about $100 if YOU take the bike apart.<br>  <br>  Use DUPLICOLOR brand LACQUER available at most auto parts stores. If you are in the UK, I don't know if the brand exists so you'll need to locate a brand of acrylic lacquer. DO NOT BUY ENAMEL OR URETHANE! <br>  <br>  You'll need 1 BIG can of grey sandable primer , 1 can of base coat (if the color requires it... many do... read the can), 1 BIG can or 2 SMALL cans of the color you want, and 2 or 3 BIG cans of clear LACQUER.<br>  <br>  Here is a quick explanation of what to do...<br>  <br>  1) After completely disassembling the bike have it sandblasted to remove ALL the finish. If the frame is aluminum, it should be walnut shell blasted, or you can chemically strip the paint. Just make sure all the paint is OFF the bike. <br>  <br>  2) READ THE CAN INSTRUCTIONS, then spray it as soon as possible with grey SANDABLE lacquer primer. DUPLICOLOR brand paint is all lacquer, I think, and you can get it from your local autoparts store. Buy the BIG cans, not the small ones. Apply at least 1 full can, in coats, 15 minutes apart. Don't worry about light runs for now.<br>  <br>  3) Wait at least 48 hours. There is a difference between dry paint and cured paint... it needs to be cured. Sand the primer using 220 grit aluminum oxide paper (white in color) or wet/dry paper (black in color) until the surface is smooth. It shouldn't take much unless you have a lot of runs.<br>  <br>  4) Using a tack rag, lightly go over the entire frame (don't rub!) to remove the sanding dust.<br>  <br>  5) Apply several coats (3 or 4 perhaps) of the base color (if necessary), then color of your choice. Make sure the frame is completely covered, it is not necessary for the color to be on thick. Follow the directions on the can. Again, use LACQUER, the same brand that you used for primer. Apply coats 1/2 hour apart. Be sure you cover every part and do NOT get runs. If you get runs you are applying it too heavily.<br>  <br>  5a) IF you wish to add decals, wait at least 8 hours, apply the decals, then continue. Make sure that you avoid touching the new paint as much as possible and to make sure there are no marks from water or "sticky stuff" on the frame. If you don't want to add decals, continue immediately to the next step WITHIN 24 HOURS...<br>  <br>  6) Do NOT sand the color coats. Apply the LACQUER clear coats, perhaps 2 full cans worth, coats 15 minutes apart. If you put decals on you should spray at least 4 cans of clear. <br>  <br>  7) Let the frame alone until you can't smell the paint anymore when you get up close and take a big whiff. If you can smell it, it ain't dry! This will take 2 to 3 days at least.<br>  <br>  8) Wet sand the entire frame CAREFULLY with 800 grit silicon carbide wet-or-dry paper (black in color), then 1000 grit silicon carbide wet-or-dry. Make sure to keep the paper wet and to wipe away the white slurry that forms. If you start to see the color in the slurry, STOP! You have sanded too hard and reached the color coats. Repeat steps 5, 6, and 7, then try again. Don't try to "touch up" the area, it will look terrible. <br>  <br>  9) Using white paste polishing compound, follow the directions and polish out the whole frame. <br>  <br>  10) Do NOT wax or wash for at least 10 days.<br>  <br>  If you rush this you will end up with a sloppy mess and you'll kick yourself for ever trying. However, if you take your time and do it right it'll be a very cool feeling.<br>  Source(s):|`|fS8joiTaaa	Your going to have to unlace the hub from the rim to paint it.|`|2VzsTDRqaa	unless you have a professional paint kit and sprayer, i would not suggest painting your bike. It will be tacky, and everything will stick to the paint and cleaning it will only make it worse. But in the other case just disassemble it from the fork down and have fun

LUnscegvaa	Read...The art of stretching and kicking by..James Lew.<br>  <br>  Best wishes :)***|`|szcA8CDyaa	Sit down on the ground. Open your leg widely until you can't go further then try to touch your toes with your fingers, you'll feel the stretch. After 30 seconds, relax for 3 seconds than do the same thing but try to go further. Do this everyday if you can and in 2 weeks you'll be able to do the splits.<br>  <br>  Good luck. =]|`|5o5gl4iKaa	that's not going to cut it.<br>  usually, you should stretch every day<br>  in my martial arts classes, we stretch our entire bodies for around 20 minutes before practice<br>  I stretch my splits for around 5-10 minutes of intense work<br>  theres the standard "splits" position with both legs to the side and butt of the floor. try to lean forward, that helped me get down.<br>  also, to stretch individual legs, try only sticking on leg out, and keeping the other tucked behind, then pulling on the extended one and trying to touch your head to your toe.<br>  then, there's front splits, where one leg is in front, and the other is to the back. both knees and legs have to be straight. The best way to get down is to just relax your muscles and let your own weight carry you down until you're a afew inches ff the ground and get "stuck"<br>  after that, it's just a matter of practice before you can force yourself all the way. don't push hard though, you might pull a muscle.|`|2ce375b63f86ce87470a4b02810cf350aa	This might seem like a strange answer, but what helped me was eating lots of fruits and vegetables, and run or walk- anything to keep the legs moving- and stretch before and after for about 15 minutes. And of course just keep on practicing your split. A big thing to remember is that the human body was not made to do a complete split, so it may take some time to change the flexibility of those joints.|`|c73AAq22aa	well you to work out really good and intense and then when your muscle are really warm after the work do you steches sense your warmed up do be afraid to push your self
sBrummATaa	dude if its going 250-310, and its straight, i wouldnt do anything. just keep swaying my man|`|ThhLaA32aa	Personally, I wouldn't be too worried....watch some slow motion shots of Tiger and all the other players etc...they too have a slight sway....to their swings.<br>  <br>  One thing you can work on...is to not let your club dip past parallel on the top of the swing.  If you work on this...I promise you that your swing will be more reliable...and you'll get more consistent results.  250-310 is pretty unreliable.  Work on swinging in control...and I bet you'll watch that difference shrink.<br>  <br>  Anyways...Good Luck with your Game!!
Cl6KbcAGaa	it is a 7 speed sprocket  probably 14/34 that is 14 teeth on the smallest ring and 34 on the largest....being an 07' model year I suspect it is rapidly becoming a thing of the past as most mfg's are going to 9 speed now ....Edit: all you have to do is count the teeth on the smallest ring and the largest one and you have it. It is also heavy and you will never be able to make this bike a 9 speed so dont ask how!|`|DOVbF4Piaa	It's a  14-34 tooth  7 speed mega range cassette.<br>  <br>  .<a href="http://www.giant-bicycles.com/en-US/bikes/mountain/10/28398/" rel="nofollow">http://www.giant-bicycles.com/en-US/bike...</a>|`|7l4tR0aZaa	i never heard of a 7 speed with a 34t its probably just 12-32

aKnoADs1aa	Most places ive been to have told me to drill a hole in the ice. If it is about eight inches it is fairly safe. Any thing less be cautious. If it cracks when you put any weight on it dont go.  Your minimum thickness should probably be around five inches depending how much weight you are going to put on the ice.|`|ef729c7cc01585401c5937bb2ee1e6b8aa	if its a community outdoor rink then ther'll be a flag.<br>  red means too thin, or proceed with extreme caution<br>  yellow means its adequitely think but be cautious<br>  if its not one with a flag, then just smash a few hard rocks onto the surface and see if its strong enough then continue with caution|`|NiRccPGtaa	Don't test it yourself, have your local firefighters declare it safe, thats the legal thing to do.

ARQIxiSGaa	neutral refs are needed for the simple fact that they eliminate such worries like these. I think it has been proven in cricket that when you dont have neutral umpires the questions get asked, and I am sure it will be the same with the super 14. it is likely you will have both situations, home referees being biased towards their local team, but also home referees being too lenient towards visiting teams in the interest of maintaining fairness and trying not to look one-eyed. ultimately it is a decision that is not going to make for a fairer game of rugby, so therefore is going to take away from the overall spectacle meaning it can hardly be worth the few thousand dollars it is saving.|`|O6wEqHj4aa	You are all sooo bl**dy hypocritical. How conveniently you forget the NEUTRAL referee during the All Blacks/France game in the world cup. Still the All Blacks lost. There are numerous examples over the last 12 years of super rugby where NEUTRAL referees made hugely obvious mistakes which cost one team or the other..........Get over yourselves and enjoy the rugby. These guys are professionals. And those that hate South African referees........it is a fact as shown by the IRB rankings that it is a South African referee who is the best in the world.|`|8SRjjYg4aa	I agree that they need neutral refs in the Super 14. I have watched several games and some of the calls that the refs make are insane. They seem to lead to one team more than another, and I don't know where they are seeing have of the penalties that they are so eager to give. <br>  I guess we will just have to yell at the refs during the game to vent our frustrations over their idiotic calls.|`|HtaO5Uu6aa	Fuckin Oath mate its a str8 joke but that is How Aus likes to do things so i cant see them Kicking up 2 Much fuss you will notice Only Kiwis will not like this happening becoz NZ refs are not biased and evry1 else knows this so they dont mind 2 much but African and Aus refs are very One Eyed so at this stage all the NZ teams are going to be at a disadvantage.|`|iDfJYYpXaa	I was under the understanding that if a NZ team played an Ozzie team then a SA referee was to do the game. the only time a NZ referee could ref  a NZ game was if both teams came from NZ.

I also thought that both referees for the Force and Waratahs games were bending over backwards to be fair to the detriment of the home side. Had NSW had a goalkicker (1 from 5) the score would have been well over the 4 point winnning margin. With a blown out score there wouldn't have been so many grumbles about the game. As a Waratahs fan, I wouldn't have a problem with a Kiwi ref doing our games against other NZ sides.|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	Just wait to the NZ teams play in SA|`|Zd9whuMmaa	I believe that we need Neutral Referees that are up to international standard and know and understand the rules and are accountable for things they do wrong during a game a player gets warning and a Yellow card and red carded if they make mistakes during a game.<br>  I understand a referees performance gets looked at but because there are not enough referees they will be doing the next game in one way or another. that is unless they do something bad like Steve Walsh|`|gz2M5hsBaa	I support the Chiefs.

DXV0A1haaa	What the heck are you talking about? :P  A donut is cake, drifting is more difficult.  What kind of vehicle are you driving? What kind of track surface are you going to be practicing on on?  If you're talking about trying to drift a giant closed circle, you're gonna need to lower your sights a bit and learn the basics first.<br>  <br>  Ok, first concern - especially as a beginner - NEVER DRIFT ANYWHERE EXCEPT A MOTORSPORTS PARK!  Get in with the SCCA or NASA, and attend a few events before trying to drive in one.  And for sanity's sake, if you have a front wheel drive, you're done.  The balance of traction you need to drift simply can't happen with a FWD because you have to control the drift with braking, and you brake with the front tires almost exclusively.  With a FWD, you can see how that just doesn't happen.  Best a taildragger can do is handbrake slides, and those can cause you to flip or break suspension parts if you don't know what you're doing or try it where the surface is uneven. <br>  <br>  If you're serious about trying to learn to drift, pick up a vehicle which is suited to it - the best platform is a rear-wheel drive vehicle with a good weight balance front-to-back and enough power to kick the tires loose while in motion, then drop a couple of thousand in suspension, spare wheels and tires, and track time.  A well set up 240SX is generally the best thing in the states to start with, and they are cheap.  If you can get a Corolla GTS with the 2.0 liter, that's great too, but they are harder to get parts for.  Don't try it with an RX7 or other car that takes high revs to make power with though - and for Gods sake forget about using American V8 muscle cars in general unless you have a ton of money to waste setting one up.|`|KTxxd700aa	1.By a pack of six, preferably jam or custard flavour<br>  2.

If you turn to anger and frustration, then you have beaten yourself, rather than the game.<br>  <br>  Golf is a fantastic way to test one's character in life...we end up in situations that we would not want to be in, however, it is our ability to overcome such hurdles and reach the goal of the least amount of swings to get from the tee box to the hole.<br>  <br>  If you relax, enjoy the moment...your will find that the round will be a little more easier to digest...<br>  <br>  Wise thought...it is better for you to drive the ball 150yds in the center of the fairway, than 200yds in the rough.|`|ThhLaA32aa	First of all, good luck!<br>  <br>  Lastly and most important ......

You might be nervous on the first tee but when you get started you can walk it off and focus on your game.  Hopefully they'll be friendly, but if they're not, that is their problem.  I found that just taking an iron off the first tee and pretending like I swing 50% power helps me when everyone is watching.  Since I'm nervous it obviously goes faster than that, but it stops me from going too quick.  You should pick your most reliable club and just make a good pass at the ball.  If you mess up, just forget about it, most people will care about their own game rather than what happened to you.|`|JRBYrVd1aa	77 at thiretten?

We covered the theme song for a wrestler named "Christian". They came to us and asked if we wanted to put a Story Of The Year twist on one of their songs and we said, "of course". We recorded it here in St. Louis with our friend Jason McEntire at Sawhorse Studios. It turned out great.

Initially, players dribbled a soccer ball up and down a court of unspecified dimensions. Points were earned by landing the ball in a peach basket. Iron hoops and a hammock-style basket were introduced in 1893. Another decade passed, however, before the innovation of open-ended nets put an end to the practice of manually retrieving the ball from the basket each time a goal was scored.<br>  <br>  James Naismith was the Canadian physical education instructor who invented basketball in 1891. James Naismith was born in Almonte, Ontario and educated at McGill University and Presbyterian Cllege in Montreal. He was the physical education teacher at McGill University (1887 to 1890) and at Springfield College in Springfield, Massachusetts (1890 to 1895). At Springfield College (which was then the Y.M.C.A. training school), James Naismith, under the direction of American phys-ed specialist Luther Halsey Gulick, invented the indoor sport of basketball.

There are things they don't like about my Alpine as well.  The point I'm trying to make, go to a pro shop and shoot any bows that might appeal to you.  Then you can make an educated opinion as to the best bow for you.

S0u3HKzhaa	Yeah it is all a storyline,none is real.They are just all pretty convincing actors.It is actually being very well done.One everyone is part.Randy Orton is very convincing as the evil heel who does this then worried and concerned because of his disease.Triple H was very convincing about the f*cking pissed the hell of husband.Stephanie also took the very concerned sister role pretty well and took a beautifully done RKO.But this storyline is kind of a recycled storyline.Like the Stone Cold Vince McMahon crossing of the boss.Only this time with Orton.And with Austin and McMahon it got many people to believe it was true and they actually had a strong hatred for each other.This one is now doing the same.But it isn't true if it was Orton would so be fired.|`|j9GokH9Qaa	No...

2DONQLJoaa	I think they should go after a couple line men in free agency pick 33 with their first pick it looks like with the deal they gave Culpepper they are going to pick a qb.after that they should get 2 more line men with the # 20 and # 33 picks|`|mDZpm7DBaa	they shouldnt trade that 1st pick... they should get a rb and have cullpeper as their qb next year... its gonna take multiple years to rebuild this team... its real bad in detroit|`|UoT86gbiaa	Nobody will trade up to #1.  Over the last few years, several teams have looked to move the top pick but nobody wants to take it and have to commit that much money to a rookie.  You think Parcells wanted Jake Long after making a career of moving down for extra picks?  Add that this draft class has no clear top guy, and Detroit is stuck where they are.<br>  <br>  What they should do is look to get every lineman they can.  Football starts at the line of scrimmage, and the Lions are lacking beef up-front.  If they spend seven draft picks on 300-pounders, it won't be too much.
oqQjnpfGaa	Yeah. Keep Manu. <br>  <br>  He will only be out for 2-3 weeks, since you have a bye in the playoffs that means that you have a solid team.

7oS5g9o7aa	Thats a ridiculous bench for 8th grader. Benches are no really a good indicator for how good a football player you are unless your a lineman. If you are a lineman and you can bench 210 in the 8th grade, I would think you are a definite threat on the field. There are many factors though depending on your position. For example, if your a running back, speed and agility are your biggest concerns. If your a wide receiver, it's speed, agility, and height.  <br>  <br>  If you can max out your weight, it's considered great. I start on a sate championship football team. I'm 5-9, 175 pounds and can bench about my weight. I'm also in great shape though, running 3-6 miles a day during the summer and paying lacrosse and doing winter track.|`|jI7QQEZFaa	depends on the area you live in, the school, your size.<br>  <br>  for instance i know football teams that everyone on the team can beach at least 225.(reps)<br>  <br>  for a 14 yr old 210 is pretty good. keep up the good work.<br>  <br>  and work out other things as well.<br>  <br>  remember you use your legs more then anything in football. thats where you power comes from.|`|AA10700819	it depends on your size and if that is your max out or for reps|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	Im 32 and couldnt bench 210.  Id say your way above avg|`|LWOZ9Yqdaa	All depends on your size. And you have to remember not to focus on one lift. You may have a good bench but if you cant do much else youre not going to be a very good player

fC64C0diaa	I prefer a strong side leather belt holster. Might be a chick thing I hear guys all the time say how they like iwb holsters. I've tried a couple and they just don't work for me.<br>  <br>  All my holsters are leather Galcos. Here are links to two (both available for the Glock 27) that I have and like a lot.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.usgalco.com/HolsterPG3.asp?ProductID=537&GunID=51" rel="nofollow">http://www.usgalco.com/HolsterPG3.asp?Pr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.usgalco.com/HolsterPG3.asp?ProductID=288&GunID=51" rel="nofollow">http://www.usgalco.com/HolsterPG3.asp?Pr...</a>|`|OAEuYZkZaa	John,<br>  <br>  You are the only one who can answer that question.  Choice of holsters is just as personal as choice of a sidearm.  Most gun cranks end up with a box full of holsters they've tried over the years.<br>  <br>  Inside the Waistband holsters are a good choice if you are not a really big guy and if you don't wear your pants skin tight.  I've used IWB holsters often but I've gotten to danged fat for them to be comfortable.<br>  <br>  Ankle holsters are alright for second or third guns, but for your main or only weapon, they will get you killed.  Having a pistol in an ankle holster will lull you into a false sense of security.  <br>  <br>  To draw you will have to either stand on one leg while lifting the other as high as possible, clawing desperately to pull up your pants leg to access your pistol.  Any ten-year old bandito could knock you on your **** with one good push and then dance a fandango on your face.<br>  <br>  Or you will have to kneel on one knee while desperately clawing at your pants leg to access your pistol.  While doing that, the bad guy has a perfect opportunity to display his field goal kicking prowess using your head for the football.<br>  <br>  Small of the Back holsters can lead to severe injury.  I've known two guys that required major back surgery after falling and landing on the S.O.B. holstered pistols.  And if you aren't careful, every time you sit in a hard chair or bench, you will announce the fact that you are packing heat by the loud "THUNK!" your pistol will make as you sit.<br>  <br>  My personal preference is for a high ride strong-side holster with a thumb-break safety strap.<br>  <br>  Check with my friend Rob Leahy at www.simplyrugged.com .  Rob makes some very good concealment holsters.<br>  <br>  Good Shooting,<br>  Doc|`|AA12034449	ankle holster... very awkward and slow presentation... I would never carry a primary weapon in an ankle rig.<br>  Belly bands and some of the other deep cover options are a problem too.<br>  Small of back holster... for a small or flat pistol they are OK... unless you sit or drive a lot. If you fall on a SOB holstered gun you can really hurt yourself too.<br>  <br>  I favor strong side behind the hip.. and have carried everything from J frames, K frames and Govt Colts in this fashion. I like pancake holsters with thumb breaks... the belt slots pull those in tight and retention has always been good.<br>  <br>  For stock holsters I have done well with Galco, Bianchi and Gould and Goodrich.<br>  <br>  If you carry long enough you will end up with a box full of holsters. How you dress, the gun and how you dress create a lot of variables.<br>  <br>  J and round butt K frames work good for me inside- the- waistband in holsters similar to the old Bianchi Pistol pockets|`|KDOIKIq2aa	I prefer strong side belt holsters with a forward cant.  I prefer them worn about the 4 o'clock position on the belt.  For full size I will always like belt holsters.  While going smaller and with a good holster Inside the pants does start to work.  The Glock 27 is one of those middle of the road, might work, might not work in a inside the pants.<br>  <br>  Ankle is poor choice.  Slow to draw, and I tended to kick the firearm when worn properly on the inside of the leg.  It is best suited to very small firearms, not a Glock.<br>  <br>  Small of the back holsters have one big problem.  If you were to fall backwards with a firearm right over your spine it could put extreme force at that one point and cause unwanted injury.|`|c474fd81caa3e43b78b2c3cb23eb0a39aa	In cold weather, a simple, strong side holster is best.  For warmer weather.  I suggest Iinside waist carry.  It isn't the most comfortable, but it offers good concealment, with easy access.  <br>  <br>  I've never tried ankle, but it just doesn't sound good.  Takes too long and is a bear of a weight difference.  <br>  <br>  I've got some mouse guns that go in my back pocket for all other occasions.|`|bgxYKsGiaa	i use an inside the waistband holster and it works great with my 45 and i had it custom made by one of my buddies that makes leather gun holsters it was $60|`|ev48pcJ5aa	i love iwb because i find them the most comfortable, no matter the size of the gun, and for me it's a nice tight fit, so it doesn't move around as much as a belly band or shoulder holster or even a conventional holster.  The gun you're talking about is a smaller gun, so you shouldn't have to worry about making sure it is concealed, as long as you position it wisely on you're body.  But the main factors in a decision like this is experimentation with different options, and taking into consideration your own preferences, size, and type of clothes you wear.  personally i've had bad experiences with ankle holsters, it's awkward on your leg, and i know someone who carried a backup on his ankle (responsibly, he was an experienced law enforcement officer) and something caught underneath and caused the gun to discharge in a crowded room (this is rare however)|`|uChkvc5qaa	I like the small of the back holsters, especially in the summer. They seem to offer great concealment because of the natural shape of your body. They also have a comfortable draw. IWB holsters for the glock 27 sit to deep for me. That makes for a slower draw. Strong side hip is good too, but bulges a little. Desantis and galco make good ones. There is also a guy named bob mernickle (www.mernickleholsters.com/) that I love. He makes the absolute best magazine holsters I have seen. If you prefer hip, He make a high ride low draw with blocking that is great too.

DXSp4KQpaa	haha, go ahead and try to break a longboard by practical means. your going to have an extremely difficult time where you can snap a skateboard by stomping on it correctly.<br>  <br>  if it looks like its going to snap easily thats because of flex and the person riding it chose the wrong flex or something but it is nowhere near breaking point.<br>  <br>  size is all your preference, but i'd recommend a medium board like 30-38 inches. id also go with 78-82A durometer for hardness. i recommend you learn how to slide (no hands). for that id go with 80A and up|`|oNIIzLwHaa	no they dont break easily. ive seen big fat dudes on longboards lol. its good for them to bend it helps when carving. i think regular short boards snap more often due to tricks than longboards<br>  <br>  you should get as soft as possible to absorb vibration. they are also quieter. softer will wear down faster but you really shouldnt worry about it, it will take a long time before you need to replace them. i dont know about size though. as big as you can get without getting wheelbite i guess
e9nZrkGaaa	yeah winning the conference tournament is their only chance, and it's going to be hard because its on nevada's home court.  i really don't like how the wac does this, the past 2 years it was in las cruces on nmsu's home court.  it would be alright if they rotated from school to school but they don't, they should have it at a neutral site.  And they beat utah state, not utah.  i think it will be usu and Nevada in the championship game, it will be hard for the aggies to win but i think if they win out the rest of the season, and get to the championship game, and then loose, they deserve an at large bid. hopefully they get an automatic bid though.<br>  <br>  GO AGGIES!|`|B93mt3Dzaa	Probably not, they're 7-5 in the WAC, pretty hard to give them an at large bid. The only shot they have is at the conference tournament, which will be hard.|`|iEbl30suaa	i am gay
rvyvF3KAaa	Team A. 4 players doesn't automatically mean team b is getting the better deal. Usually it means you have to drop another player. Also, this is a tough decision because the season hasn't started yet so anything can happen.

bhNT8SQsaa	7.5<br>  Depth is great. Position Starters are good. Pitching is a little bit iffy. Just if this was real you would definitely need to do some trades. Trade some of your depth like Longoria and Davis for some pitching. <br>  Lonogoria = Lincecum <br>  Davis = Dan Haren|`|2569693fcb1ad34247c096f0e4bd3ffaaa	I give the whole team a 6 out of 10<br>  <br>  C- 5<br>  1b- 9<br>  2b- 6<br>  3b- 10<br>  SS- 7<br>  OF- 4<br>  SP- 5<br>  BP- 4|`|0MJRD9sYaa	6.5 out of 10<br>  <br>  C- 4<br>  1B- 9<br>  2B- 6<br>  3B- 10<br>  SS- 7<br>  OF- 5<br>  SP- 7<br>  RP- 2 (You only have one closer!)|`|edT0W5MOaa	5 a couple of good players but not much depth.|`|REa2QBPHaa	only one closer      0_-|`|t0bx27bVaa	5 out of 10<br>  <br>  You're weak at starting.  TRADE seriously.  King Felix is not a #1 fantasy starter.  I like Lester though.  Your starting catcher should be Shoppach.  Garko is rumored to moving to outfield and Victor will move to first.  Kelly Johnson is a great pick in the 15th.  You need another closer too.  You're very good offensively, but trade Longoria for a pitcher cause everyone is high on him, I' mean he's great, but he might have a sophomore slump year (i doubt it), but trade him while his stock is high
YrxLbfiIaa	What you want is an AR15.......<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rockriverarms.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=category.display&category_id=223" rel="nofollow">http://www.rockriverarms.com/index.cfm?f...</a><br>  <br>  That is the easiest M4 type rifle to own -- Its semi-auto and legal in most states....<br>  <br>  Where? - Start by contacting your local gun shops -- Because of political reasons there has been a run on these and are difficult to find in some areas.....<br>  <br>  You can buy one on Gunbroker.com - But you must have it shipped to your local gun shop that has an FFL (Federal Firearms License).... They will handle the paperwork to transfer it to you..... Make friends with the local gun-shop first -- Then buy on gunbroker and make the necessary arrangements for shipment to your local gun dealer....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gunbroker.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gunbroker.com/</a>|`|AA12034449	every AR maker has a M 4orgery version available.<br>  <br>  Colt will sell to anyone (through its dealers) who can legally own a gun.|`|KDOIKIq2aa	Dave is right on this one.  The M4 and or the M4A1 both are select fire automatic carbines made after 86.  Add to that they also have a 14 1/2" barrel you can not buy a M4 legally in the usa as a private citizen.<br>  <br>  You can take a full auto lower with all needed paper work and add a 14 1/2" barrel upper to it to make it look like a M4, but an M4 it is not.<br>  <br>  Yes companies sell a civilian version of the M4, but with only semi automatic action and a 16" barrel it isn't an M4.|`|AA11640949	You want a real M4?  The fully automatic version?  If so, this will be a tricky process.  first you gotta pay the $200 to get a license.  I believe it requires your local law enforcement to sign off on it saying you're an OK person.  Next you've got to wait about 6 months for the paperwork to be pushed through.<br>  <br>  Now the fun part.  Finding one.  check gunbroker.com they will periodically have them.  Also snoop around the forum at machinegunshoot.com.  It is the Knob Creek website, which they are known for once a year bringing a huge crowd of full auto owners and going nuts (safely and legally of course--youtube "Knob Creek" and you'll see what I'm talking about).  Expect to pay $10,000 or more for the rifle.  See when they outlawed the sale of fully automatic weapons to civillians, they grandfathered in all the ones that were previously on the market. So this means that there is a limited number of full auto's available.  And in theory the number is shrinking because they may periodically break.<br>  <br>  So, you know the good old rules of supply and demand.  Prices skyrocketed.<br>  <br>  If you are wanting a semi-automatic version that is civillian legal, then you are looking for an AR-15, sometimes refered to as an M4gery.  Bushmaster, Rock River Arms, Stag, Colt, Smith and Wesson all make these and can be found at just about any gunstore (assuming they have them in stock) or on online auctions like gunbroker.  A quick yellowpages search should show you where the shops are locally.|`|bgxYKsGiaa	if you want a M4 you need a class 3 firearms license or a automatic fire arm permit because a M4 is semi,burst,or fully auto|`|jlajkhcBaa	didnt they come out after the ban?<br>  <br>  if they did, your outta luck..|`|ev48pcJ5aa	this is not true, you can buy an m4 carbine in just semi auto.  I recommend bushmaster or rock river because i've had good experiences with them, although i like my bushmaster the best.  go to a gun show or gun shop and you will find some.  you can find some online also, you could buy a colt although i think their overpriced.|`|VpXrsxGGaa	you need a class 3 license and then you can but it at a gun show|`|AA10644603	Well unless you have your heart set on an M4 you may want to look at the Sig 556.They are put together alot better than any Ar style rifle.But thats just my opinion.|`|mOlvOZXYaa	Look up AR 15. They are the same thing. Also try Cabellas
9Ute4yidaa	Just streching will do it.|`|UW97kf4Baa	You should get back into stretching. Try reaching your toes and if you can that flex them and try to make your elbows touch the floor. After a couple weeks of strectching you should be able to do the splitz.

nRSjUKJZaa	He is correct guys, he's been around forever. He's a good guy, not a troll, he's just unfortunately a Squeelers fan =)<br>  <br>  Aw Lemony.. we miss you!|`|6tGYe5roaa	I could verify as well that you are not troll. Don't know how much that is worth though lol. But you have been my contact for awhile. You just took a really long break.<br>  <br>  I guess people have been getting a lot of violation notices so it is causing them to be paranoid. They are blocking anyone they don't really know. That's what I am assuming.|`|KTp27Fokaa	I don't think you're a troll. You may be hated by a lot of people but that doesn't mean you're a troll to me. You have a lot of answers which means you're dedicated. You're not stupid because you're a TC in investing. <br>  <br>  People are blocking you because they are afraid of losing their accounts.|`|DvKpx0Reaa	yeah i think it's just because we're paranoid. i get so many freakking violations in one day that i do block people who look "suspicious". im sure they'll unblock you though, they are pretty wicked nice, understanding people :]|`|RS3fjNboaa	OK, thanks for that. If you'll take a look, you'll see that I've already unblocked you. You got an endorsement from someone I trust.|`|QzezKBmnaa	WHAT UP!? Don't sweat it, they're the one's missing out. Glad to see you back! ;)<br>  <br>  *I don't come to this section much these days. I wondered what happened to you! I miss the old days....|`|DPlJiWyWaa	I've never thought you were a troll, I'm suprised that those guys blocked you.  I'm sure it was a mis-understanding though.|`|Pw4sfCZVaa	Crap, if your a troll then what am I?|`|nltFZcuGaa	troll.....dont know|`|XLXncQu9aa	I haven't seen you around here, but I usually don't block individuals unless they show troll like tendencies.  Those include: <br>  <br>  *Asking questions that make no sense, or questions that are seen as spam. <br>  *Questions that are offensive to me or to the public of yahoo. <br>  *Reputation of being a troll or reporting questions and answers.  <br>  <br>  So with that being said, under those circumstances I only block those that fall into those categories.  As for as you, I don't know you and you don't seem like a troll to me.  If they blocked you it may be because they don't agree with your answers.  Heck, I've been blocked by many just because they didn't agree with what I said.  You can't control what user's do, just make sure you aren't a troll and you are giving your answers respectfully and intelligently.

Cl6KbcAGaa	if you have to ask how to fix it then I recommend you wait until tomorrow morning and let your Brick and Mortar shop do it for you. This should not be an 8 speed shifter it should be a 7 speed shifter! Low end for Sram and usually found on the "higher end" dept store bikes....if this is what you have then do not mess with it yourself as it is more than just the chain and the rear derailleur is out of alignment and who knows what else....just wait! and one more thing, you did not over stretch the chain....the rear derailleur is out of allingment and it likely moved past the largest rear gear and came off. You didnt do anything wrong. You just need to have it fixed where you bought it. Edit: well you didnt buy a big box store bike but you did get a low end bike shop bike and although there is nothing wrong with the brand it does have lower end components on it and they need to be adjusted properly that is all. dont worry about it!<br>  edit: Yes I am familiar with the brand, we sell it too at PBS, not a bad bike it probably was not finaled before you took it out the store or you turned the right shifter too far and caused the cable to pull on the derailleur too hard and the chain jumped ...Yes you can shift the right side to 8 when the left is in two but NOT at the same time! either way you came off the cassette and turned it too hard or the derailleur is off a bit and in this position the chain is a bit overextended too dont go up to 8th position keep it in 6 or 7 and you will be fine you will have to get used to this over time.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	You can put it back on track by pushing the bottom of the derailleur forward and getting slack in the chain.  Place the chain on the sprocket and slowly rotate the wheel backwards.  Be careful when you shift gears until you get to the bike shop, don't shift into 8.  There is a limit screw that needs adjusted to prevent the chain from over running the last gear.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bicycletutor.com/gear-shifting/" rel="nofollow">http://bicycletutor.com/gear-shifting/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://bicycletutor.com/adjust-rear-derailleur/" rel="nofollow">http://bicycletutor.com/adjust-rear-dera...</a>
9H5wDRrRaa	in the english first division with a shitey team like watford
KHWV4bX3aa	no they dont have any stand out players other than nate robinson and harrington....sometimes.|`|NzrTgpe4aa	Well they arent a bad team, but there are way better teams out there. None of the knicks are really "dominant", meaning they can drop 30 or more points consistently like D-Wade, and Lebron. Also they need to work on D. They give up more points than the NJ Nets, and thats saying something! Also they cant stop the stars, like Kobe and Lebron. Kobe dropped 61 and Lebron dropped a 55 point triple double(one rebound robbed). They do have talent, but they cant go far, unless a miracle happens|`|3wh5Y2wVaa	uhh no,that run and gun style is great but come playoff time..it doesnt win<br>  <br>  just ask the old suns|`|0zctdA3iaa	nope sorry kid|`|uxregJ0faa	LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...<br>  <br>  Not any time soon. But they look playoff material. Make the playoffs Knicks|`|meNI6vuyaa	No, just because they win today which was a fluke doesnt mean they will a championship...|`|czHrQRCOaa	Yeah they got D'Antoni and all, but really, think about it. They are really doing good, beating teams like toronto and all, but they are not built for the playoffs. If they though up some good trades, that would have boosted their ego a lot. But right now they are just not there, and probably won't be for another couple years, unless the bank Lebron James, which has been one of their recent focuses.|`|jA6OZjIGaa	they will not win the champion, but the Knicks can attract many players in 2009 and 2010<br>  <br>  im sure no one would come if the Knicks having a record like the Wizards, so they dont want to waste this season|`|UMVWQiYJaa	na not this year. they got the potential to get that 8 seed.|`|4j92pzJxaa	hell no, but they def. fun to watch.

But, ever since he became a CAV there have been many mysterious CAVS fans appearing from the shadows. Ever since Lebron entered the league there have been many mysterious Lebron fans entering from the shadows.<br>  <br>  *Cough, bandwagon, cough*<br>  <br>  With that said, I believe if Lebron James entered porn, then there would be a lot "more" people addicted to porn and then yes, there would be many wanting to bang him. Unfortunately, he would no longer be a CAV therefore the team would resort back to nothing, record wise, and fan wise...<br>  <br>  Let the thumbs down's begin!

bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	Way overpaid. In this economy and with teams laying off employees you would think that the players would have to take a pay-cut also.

ptQ5SkPVaa	I think he will next week to set up big wrestlemania rematch for the ECW title.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	you got to think about it jack swagger  has not Held the ecw tittle for very long  and for that wwe  would not let jack swagger loss his tittle so quickly so that im a christan fan for a long time but some how i can see jack swagger wining  cause i think what vince is doing right now for swagger is they going to make him top off ecw and have him face guys like christan finlay etc but im think swagger would loss it at wrestle mania to christan and swagger will get it back   later.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Well it's not really sure that Christian will win this match... The WWE might not want to strap the belt on him so fast because he still came from the opposing company and Vince seems to hold grudges to superstars like that. I would love for Christian to win but it's still a fair shot for Swagger.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	I think they said that because Christian beat Swagger twice already. Maybe, they figured Swagger will get the win this time. A lot of people can see this match happening at Mania, not now. I think Finlay will screw Christian out of the title and we will see a Triple Threat at Mania. Maybe, they voted because of those reasons. If those aren't the reasons as to why they picked Swagger...then they DON'T know Christian :)|`|ptDHZK7Jaa	u kno what the first time christian pinned swagger was thanx to finlay i think he just might have it i dont know swagger is realy good lets be real how long was it for him to actualy loose 4 real well we will just have to wait and seee and people we like arent always the best wrestlers we just have to deal with it dont get sad just wait till tuesday|`|B9h6VhQOaa	i gotta vote now *click*|`|DpQzUHhpaa	haha ok ive watch TNA sinc epretty much beginning and hes beaten everyone up he dose have a problm with stuff but he is a really fgood fighter  hes defently going to beat swagger no dout and if swagger some how dose beat him ima say Cage was just thinking on how dumb he was for leaving TNA lol   i love TNA and WWE|`|W0rRfLU0aa	Well i dont think Christian got the responce that the writers thought he was going to. they didnt promote him at all and the !surprise! may have backfired. He should be champ but history says that whoever has the adv the week before loses.|`|l1kMNykGaa	Yeah it's just the fans who have started watching after Christian left, i'm sure.  No seasoned fan would pick Swagger over Christian.  Canadians always win in wrestling!|`|tPFikOY7aa	I can only assume people think he may win it at mania but i think he'll win next week thanlose it at mania so that he can then be traded to smackdown or raw|`|4eQqTiYwaa	i think he might , because i dont think theyll let christian win the title in his 3rd match back in the wwe|`|D21xtjPPaa	yes it is he cant beat cristian because chistian will never give up ever with the gut whench power bomb.

dJnRFpWWaa	Lugo will start at shortstop and Lowrie will be the backup SS, 2B and 3B. If Lugo doesn't hit or if his defense is below par, then there may be changes in the second half of the season. But I think Lugo will win the SS job.<br>  <br>  The starting rotation should be excellent whether it's like you have it or some other order. Potentially great bullpen.

They're bowling attack have just got hammered in their warm up game on a fairly flat pitch. But still I don't think they'll be able to get the 20 wickets required to win the match.<br>  <br>  They're batting line up is quite good though with the inclusion of in form opener Phillip Hughes. They're batting line up looks very strong on paper and is reasonably experienced so I would expect them to score 500 at least once.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	There is no reason why they can't.

SO, I DON'T THINK THEIR BOWLERS  CAN DOMINATE THE SOUTH AFRICA BATSMAN SPECIALLY AFTER SOUTH AFRICA TEAM MOST OF THE BATSMAN REALLY HAS A GOOD TECHNIQUE LIKE HASIM AMLA, JP DUMINY, MCKENZIE, JAQUES KALLIS. EVEN IF IN THEIR BATTING LINE UP AUSTRALIAN TEAM WILL MISS ADAM GILCHRIST, MATHEW HAYDEN AND ANDREW SYMONDS. YEAH DESPITE THESE PLAYERS MISSING THEY STILL HAVE GOOD BATTING LINE UP BUT AT THAT TIME WHEN MATHEW HAYDEN, SYMONDS, GILCHRIST WAS THERE, THEIR BATTING LINE UP WAS FAR MUCH BETTER THAN THE PRESENT SCENERIO OF THE AUSTRALIAN TEAM BATTING STRENGTH. SO, I THINK BOTH IN BATTING AND BOWLING DEPARTMENT ARE NOT THEIR ONE OF THE BEST AND THEIR STRENGTHS IN BOTH BATTING AND BOWLING HAS WEAKEN LITTLE AS COMPARING TO THE PAST. I WILL SAY THAT THIS IS THE MOST VULNERABLE AUSTRALIAN TEAM TOURING TO THE SOUTH AFRICA SINCE AFTER THEY BECAME WORLD CHAMPIONS AND SOUTH AFRICA HAS REALLY HAS THE GREAT CHANCE BY BEATING THEM AND CHANGING THE GENERATION OF THE CRICKET BY BECOMING NEW WORLD CHAMPIONS AND MAKING AUSTRALIA OUT OF THE SCENARIO FROM THE WORLD CHAMPIONS LIST. THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN SOMEDAY, IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHEN IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND WHO WILL BE THE TEAM WILL DISPLACE AUSTRALIA FROM WORLD CHAMPIONS LIST. IN THE PRESENT SCENARIO, SOUTH AFRICA HAS THE GREAT CHANCE TO DISPLACE THEM, IF U LOSE THIS CHANCE THEN IT WILL AGAIN TAKE LONG TIME TO GET THIS TYPE OF CHANCE.<br>        IF SOUTH AFRICA ABLE TO PLAY AT THEIR POTENTIAL AND BEST, THEY CAN EASILY CLINCH THE SERIES. SO IT LOTS DEPEND UPON THE SOUTH AFRICA TEAM WHETHER THEY CAN PERFORM UNDER SO MUCH EXPECTION AND PRESSURE FROM THEIR PEOPLE. WHATEVER IT IS, WE KNOW ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN CRICKET BECAUSE IT IS VERY FUNNY AND UNPREDICTABLE GAME.|`|g4pQqjZ4aa	we cant underestimate AUS they r a very good team.They have a good reserve players.So there is every chance for AUS to take 20 wickets & make 500 runs in an innings.|`|4zDzR8Sjaa	no they will not take 13 wickets in an match also they are losersssssssssssss.|`|YeRHa38Raa	no|`|PS14ySQuaa	ha ha ha why r u joking

cRqwANvlaa	Many people are saying that it will be Jeff vs Matt in TLC at Wrestlemania, and alot of others are saying it will be TLC between Jeff and Edge for the title. <br>  <br>  But WWE has been doing an excellent job of catching us off guard lately, so here's what I see happening- <br>  <br>  We all know Jeff and Matt are bitter rivals, but at the same time, Matt and Edge are not necessarily united either. And Christian is a face. And Jeff and Christian have fought each other for years. So the way I see it, between the 4 of those guys, it's every man for himself.<br>  <br>  So what if at WM there was not Jeff vs Matt, Jeff vs Edge, Edge vs Christian, Matt vs Edge, Matt vs Christian, and so on? What if there was a 4 WAY TLC match for the title?<br>  <br>  Just a theory.|`|38f16af5e5fc1e44e0b50a5058b0ad41aa	I'm thinking either Jeff will refuse to hit his brother or the match will end it a no contest or something with the two of them just brawling|`|HLsNzQNZaa	This Is A Rummor On Youtube That Jeff Hardy V.S Matt Hardy At WM25 I Dont Know Who Wins Sorry.|`|ywU3ZpIgaa	Fatal 4 way ladder match between Edge Cena Jeff hardy and Matt Hardy|`|smcDn76jaa	I have a feeling the match will be stopped next week or it won't occur at all.

That's my prediction.|`|IadpaNR2aa	Matt and jeff wont fight matt will just slap jeff 2 times and jeff will leave also jeff wont fight edge at WM 25 trust me im right|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	I think it will be a TLC match between Matt and Jeff.<br>  <br>  What about a fatal four way between Jeff, Matt, Cena, and Edge.|`|HS8Y5AKLaa	hopefully a street fight.|`|GJQIL0RZaa	TLC<br>  <br>  Edge Vs Cena WM 25
ptQ5SkPVaa	They claim they gave him a push before but I'm not sure how much effort was really put into that push. It seems the WWE could have done better the first time.<br>  I really like MVP, heel or face. With him being face it could lead to the Title but I'm not sure if he is ready. I guess it all depends on how the fans react to his face turn in the long term. I think he has the talent to be a main event wrestler but does he have the fan support.|`|a5hNA3Kxaa	I think MVP would do well if he got a major push, I think they should have him win the U.S title and have him work his way up to the top. I could see MVP and Shelton Benjamin being main eventers and in the WWE title storyline. There certainly better in the ring then Cena and Batista.|`|smcDn76jaa	I believe like most people are suggesting he will be Mr.MITB this year. It's kind of obvious the way they are pushing him. He might win the US title but he will drop it quickly because of the MITB win.|`|GJQIL0RZaa	He will get to the main event level.|`|l1kMNykGaa	If he gets pushed, i think he should change his look a bit...he looks absurd.  Also, he was a bit sloppy tonight.<br>  <br>  I've never been a fan of his though, so i may just be overly critical|`|38f16af5e5fc1e44e0b50a5058b0ad41aa	I'm hopin he'll be WWE/World Champ within the next year|`|4j92pzJxaa	Won't go far, i cant picture him a top gun. Push SHELTON!|`|rwG4JPXQaa	who's mvp|`|InX5Pfl5aa	Well last time he got a psuh he was a us champ and tag champ so... you never know...|`|iOICjcZcaa	It's a good push. The funny thing is, they never meant for him to become a babyface wrestler. They wanted to keep him as a heel and put him in a feud with Mr. Kennedy, but people began to feel sympathetic that MVP was losing so much, and they got on his side.<br>  <br>  That's why Mr. Kennedy hasn't made his in-ring return. They have to find someone new for him to feud with.<br>  <br>  I think he'll get the United States Championship back soon - possible even at Wrestlemania, if they can push the feud far enough.<br>  <br>  At this point, I don't see him getting much further than that. He'd have to beat out guys like Triple H to win the title and Trips just won't let THAT happen.
smcDn76jaa	I think this is the best way. It's not often HHH goes through an emotion filled feud. With him it's usually about the title. Now he's fighting for something else and it will make this feud better. I think a lot of people knew about his marriage with Stephanie because of the Internet and the fact that they jokingly mention it sometimes. The only difference now is HHH and Stephanie are going to act like more of a couple.<br>  <br>  Edit- Yes I am formely Stcool14. Yeah dude I noticed the people who answered either didn't read the Q or they didn't understand it.|`|l1kMNykGaa	It has been brought out before with DX promos before.  I mean, not quite as intense as the interview, but it was basically said.  <br>  I think it is the best move for HHH.  He is getting older and a move to being grouped with the mcmahon family may be the best move for him.  He could make the move to a GM possibly, when he decides to stop wrestling.|`|ziVpIxQ9aa	about time he step up to the plate for family|`|cRqwANvlaa	I think it is. I have always loved the idea of feuds involving family members, whether they are family in kayfabe OR real life in wrestling. It just adds more intensity and believabilty to the storyline in a sense IMO. And I love how they booked it on RAW where he came out to save Stephanie from getting kicked in the face after she had already been RKO'd by Orton. The look of sheer anger on his face after Orton had hauled a** out of the ring really had him looking like the real Cerebral Assassin for a second. But if they really want to make this feud good, they need to have Orton buff up the Legacy a little more. The McMahons have Vince, Stephanie, HHH, Shane, and maybe even Linda if she returns on their side. But the Legacy only has Orton, Rhodes, and DiBiase. That's 4, possibly 5, on 3. Orton needs to recruit Manu for sure, because I would love to see Shane fight a monster like Manu, and the Legacy needs a big man anyway. And then if Linda were to come back, they would need either DH Smith or Sim Snuka to come and even out the fight. But to answer your question, Yes, I think the revealing to all of those who did not know that HHH is a part of the McMahon family IS for the best of the storyline.<br>  <br>  COOL FACT- I was reading on WrestleZone right after Paul London got released and did anyone else know that he was originally supposed to be the one feuding with the McMahon family in this storyline? They were supposed to build it up after the Million Dollar Mania incident where London was smiling after the accident and have him as the culprit. So if they would have kept London and he could have kept his mouth shut backstage, Paul London would be in a HUGE war with the McMahons now, which means he would be getting a HUGE push which would probably lead to some big title reigns in the future.<br>  <br>  Just thought that was very interesting and thought I would share it with you guys.|`|DpQzUHhpaa	lol i never knew that but i jsut started watching WWE i usually watch TNA it all  fighting so idc really all the other stuff to much drama i jsut like seeing ppl get beat up but ya it probly best well now i gess ppl wont mess with steph as much if they were somehow|`|1Va3yslbaa	everyone already knew he and stephanie were married!Triple H has showed a video of them getting married in a drive thru he was at the fammily reunion and he was out of action on raw when steph had a baby|`|wdrILdSpaa	Yes a large majority of the audience knew they was married and it adds something extra to the angle which is always good going into Mania|`|4eQqTiYwaa	i believe it is , because it would look stupid if hhh was still rebelling against the mcmahons , because everyone knew they were related soo it brings some reality into wwe|`|EJMtFvq4aa	no hes just mentioning that vince his his father in law and stephanie is his wife with his interview with jr|`|77b5BDf3aa	??? everyone already new HHH is a part of the McMahon family.|`|D21xtjPPaa	dude they have been maried sinse along time and your barely finding out about this dang|`|S0u3HKzhaa	Definitely because honestly Shane could not have carried it through.He isn't really a major trained wrestler.He gets the job done,but Triple H and Randy Orton are way better wrestlers then Shane.Shane is more business man.But I am happy to see the wwe actually acknowledge their marriage.I mean the wwe beats around the bush for years making little jokes like when Shawn Micheals asked Triple H who got Stephanie pregnant.And Triple H made references to his penis.Or when they made the joke after they had their first child and put Triple H's face over hers.Obviously everyone new it was his child.But it is a nice twist to see Trips involved in this storyline.Him and Orton could do a lot more with it.And to top it off everyone is surprisingly not messing the storyline up.They are all very convincing.Triple H has been very good with the mad as hell husband role,Randy with the rampage but then disease effect twist.Stephanie taken that beautifully done RKO. It is actually turning out to be an interesting Wrestlemania feud.I think it is the best way to go because without Triple H invloved there was to many limites.<br>  <br>  Plus there is a lot of history between Orton and Triple H.And they put on great matches.And from the looks of it we are going into another McMahon-Helmsly era only now as faces,and with the old McMahon Austin crossing of the boss storyline which was arguably one of the best in history in the mix should be quite interesting to see all play out.And on the grandest stage of all Wrestlemania 25 where it was Orton's dad who did take place in the first one when Randy was only 4 turning 5.And with Legacy there too it makes it a bit more interesting to see.Because we know Shawn will face Taker at Mania,but him and The Undertaker won't have a major feud on one show, so Orton can't use the numbers game on Triple H without Shawn Micheals running to his aid.|`|GJsIZeUIaa	Yes it is. It's great to see The Game play a more serious role for a change. The majority of Trips' career has been all about chasing and defending the title, now, even though he is champ, he can fight for someone instead of something.
t0bx27bVaa	Without hesitation.<br>  <br>  As an Indians fan, I love Sizemore.  Here's why.  He hits for power 30 HRs and was the AL leader going into the All-Star Game.  He steals bases, which he had 30 last year.  He has the ability to hit .300.  He's entering his prime.  And lastly...<br>  <br>  HE STAYS HEALTHY<br>  <br>  I've barely ever seen him miss a game at all in the first place, he's a true baseball player who loves the game and has fun.  Really nice guy too.|`|edT0W5MOaa	defintely. Fuentes isn't that great and Ramirez is worse than sizemore. Also you'll be giving up 2 players to his 1 so you can fill that spot with someone better than fuentez.|`|jLalpJbAaa	its a rly good trade idk who ur other middle infielder is bc ramirez is also rly good hell get ur 25hrs atleast and stolen bases|`|c9PHwfVMaa	Holy cow whyd u even ask???

Let's see how he fares in the WBC.|`|Mqurv3LXaa	I'm not the biggest Sizemore fan, however, this trade works in your favor.|`|UoUaO52taa	YEAH. Sizemore is way better than Ramirez and Fuentes is no huge loss|`|gUMucKOkaa	Uh, yes. Grady is considered the six or seventh ranked fantasy player this year. I love Alexi but Grady more. Closers can be handled as there are tons of changes during the season.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Chicago got younger and KC got decently better.  And did you know from like July on Cleveland was one of if not the best team in the majors?<br>  - The Marlins I think still need a closer before I can say they'll finish 2nd.  And they did trade Mike Jacobs<br>  - Cincy is ahead of Houston cause of its deeper starting staff and good solid, young offense.  They could finish higher<br>  - And the Padres at 2nd?  First off, now the Dodgers have O-Dawg and might soon have Manny, but never the less, Arizona lost Dunn so they'll lose their productive offense without him.  The Dodgers are the deepest team talentwise.  The Rockies lost Jeff Francis so that's the starting staff and basically all the pitching.  The Giants improved offensively enough to finish as high as 2nd.  And the Padres have other than Kouzy and Adrian Gonzalez NO OFFENSE.  And is Heath Bell a true closer?

lp4wajLxaa	Being a catcher is the toughest position on the field.  Behind the plate you are the field general.  You need to know how to handle all of your pitchers and you need to know different situations with runners on base.  You need to find flaws in hitters swings and learn how to exploit them.  Most importantly you need to work on blocking.  Catching at the pro level looks very easy, but in high school the pitchers don't have the control pro's do and they tend to be wild at times.  Keeping that ball in front of you is a major part of being a catcher.  You CAN NOT be afraid of the ball.  It's a very complicated position to explain in words so hopefully this helps a little bit.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Alot of the answers here are talking about throwing.  While throwing is a big part of catching it is far from the most important.  Blocking the ball is far more important.  As a freshman this is what I would work on more then anything.  Throwing will come in time.  Having a strong throwing arm is great, but accuracy is better.  The less your fielder has to move his glove the better.  When throwing the ball though you want to try and do it all in one motion.  You DO NOT want to stand straight up.  Catchers use more of a short arm when throwing to cut down on the time it takes to get rid of the ball.  Footwork is essential as well.  You will sometimes have obstacles in your way, such as a right handed batter in your way on a throw to 3rd base.|`|s9TPcezTaa	lets see<br>  <br>  catchers should be able to field - hitting is a bonus<br>  you will be the leader of the infield and you need to be loud<br>  learn how to get rid of the ball as fast as possible when throwing down to second<br>  if you cant block the ball in the dirt you will not be called a catcher for very long<br>  at our high school the coaches call the pitches from the dugout for the first half of season or until we get comfortable enough with the catcher calling his own game - we have a system of ear (fastball) nose (curveball) - chin (a change up) - left cheek inside right cheek outside we change it up from time to time and change the order every three innings i.e. ist inning ist sign - second inning second sign - third third then start all over in the fourth<br>  <br>  anyway just a couple of quick notes as we can talk all day if need be footing, balance, stance, etc.<br>  <br>  good luck to ya|`|Zqbfw2bkaa	THROW THE BALL TO SECOND JUST LIKE YOUR THROWING TO 1ST.

S0u3HKzhaa	I see where your coming from definitely,but now everyone has seemed to forgot about that so the wwe is making Triple H as the hero stepping into this McMahon Orton feud.By standing up for his family.But it kind of bugs me that the wwe expects everybody to forget the past.But I think this storyline is actually being handled pretty well for a change.It is a very convincing especially for a recycled storyline. (Stone Cold Vince McMahon crossing the boss,same thing only now Orton is a heel in the place of Stone Cold McMahon face and it is a family matter now).Really though Triple H was the only option left for the storyline because Shane couldn't of obviously carried it through.He is a performer more then a wrestler.And would not be champion so bring Triple H the champion to face Orton was a pretty interesting turn.It is nice to see the wwe actually acknowledge that Trips and Stephanie are married in real life.But overall it is for the sake of the storyline and the fact Triple H is a a face now.Opposed to heel tweener.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Its wrestling. This is where the fantasy world comes in. You're not supposed to remember that HHH abused Stephaine in the past. You have to go with the here and now.|`|11i3Xmb1aa	Triple H is Steph's husband so he is mad because Orton hurt his lady. And no not really.

Remember how HBK sold Rebbecca getting (supposedly) knocked out by Jericho?<br>  To play the part of the good hubby (as I'm sure he is in real life...well, they seem happy enough) HHH needed to reply to Orton's actions, or suffer a loss of face the next time he came to the ring. <br>  <br>  On a more cynical note though...by having HHH spitting mad at Orton, it allows a WM main event with HHH's name all over it, doesn't it???|`|gi0haHtdaa	Because it was directed by Vince Mcmahon and creative team for Triple H to get angry<br>  <br>  It was planned out, nothing in WWE is real, Matt and Jeff are still on good terms, just because it is on TV doesn't mean it is real, but everyone knows Trips and Steph are married so I guess they are just going there now|`|ptDHZK7Jaa	hell i honestly doubt that steph has a lot to do with h's victorys i think he just a good wretler  n thats it and of course h was gonna be pissed off that is the mother of his kids his wife man i do get him <br>  <br>  N RANDY NEEDS TO GET KICKED THA F |_| CK OUT WWE DONT NEED HIM NOR THE OTHER TWO GOOD FOR NOTHIN PUNKS TED AND RODES|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	Actually he didn't punt her, he RKO'd her but the punt is coming.<br>  <br>  I do see your point though.<br>  <br>  I wasn't knocking your question, it's a valid one.

I'm sure it will be much better once the season gets rolling, but for right now I find it to be horribly repetitious. I would have thought that, with all of the time they had to prepare, they could have come up with better programming than old Home Run Derby contests (maybe they would be a bit better with some editing - about 15 minutes of action packed into an hour and a half or so) and endless repeats of the same things. (I mean, 1982 was a decent season, but do we need to see an hour show about it dozens of times?) And equally frustrating is that the one great program they have (Ken Burns' Baseball) seems to be the only thing they don't run over and over.<br>  I will say though that they do seem to have put together a great group of analysts, and the idea that they will be presenting games that normally I wouldn't see. (or would have to suffer through the awful Miller?Morgan or Buck/McCarver combination to see)<br>  So while my initial feeling is that it's average at best, I'm sure most of that is due to the fact that it is the off season. I'm sure my opinion will change come April.|`|v9bTfQGMaa	HAPPY BIRTHDAY YFFL!<br>  And I unfortunately can't get MLB Network, so any talk of it, really makes me sad and feel left out:(|`|jK2xUOyTaa	YOUR PICTURES A SKWERREL IN CLOTHES LOLOLOLOLOL|`|qScj8l5aaa	don't worry<br>  about a thing<br>  cause every little thing<br>  is gonna be alright...|`|NS3BxXEmaa	love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love IT so very much|`|wn2o99B9aa	i love it :D|`|c6q3EERdaa	I don't really have an opinion.

tltil4Aeaa	hustle and really show that you want it. Throw yourself at every point, literally and figuritively. Dive. One amazing save out of 10 great tries goes a long way. If you aren't afraid of the floor you can make spectacular plays. Also when the coach says to shag the balls make an effort. Coaches love to see someone who is a sportsman and is willing to try. Play with a smile on your face and be sure to show that you realize that you aren't the only important one out there. A hit doesn't come without a set which doesn't come without a good pass. Make everyone else look good because if how you are playing.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|MXnSWKCkaa	good sportsmanship and a good player|`|DFUN42S9aa	coaches look for a person who is good in skills but thats not the most important thing they are looking for.

They are always looking for a player who is having a lot of fun and smiling!!!!!!<br>  <br>  You can get ready by practicing.

Sabathia won't pitch as well as he did last year.<br>  <br>  In related news, George Steinbrenner fires the entire Yankee organization, lol.|`|Uh7HagITaa	with that rotation and texiera they should win the division and get close to if not over 100 wins. there is no excuse for anything less. the division is tough but i think they win the division by a couple games, barring injuries of course.<br>  <br>  a WS championship would be nice too.|`|5f4qvGLKaa	there are always big expectations, they'll make the play-offs, but they won't make it to the world series, sabathia looked better in the NL and should have stayed there, burnett is gonna b a bust and teixeira doesn't carry an offense, lots of distractions too with a-rod|`|ubGNtkHQaa	162-0....just kidding<br>  <br>  98-74<br>  <br>  Since I'm biased (and a yankee fan) they will in the World Series|`|sitkfn5Maa	depends if this A-rod thing doesnt affect them all? i think thell win there division, for sure 100 maybe 110 no more then that but i hope they win it all, i dont know about in the playoffs. i have mix feelings with them. but i gthink each pitcher will have 20 win games|`|aEwd0f5Waa	The # of wins will be determined by the # of millions of dollars Sabathia and Teixeira got paid...180-161= 19 wins!! yayyy!<br>  <br>  They'll go 89-73|`|nWHwzTjNaa	like 84-78, 3rd, miss playoffs|`|1CgCx1E2aa	pretty good. need stronger bullpen and outfield situation needs to become solid and hitting needs to be consistent<br>  (Yankee fan)<br>  I'd say 94-68|`|rzc1oLktaa	We Are Gonna Win The World Series This Year Baby!!! 27 in 09|`|CtwEFHcqaa	They should be more than 100 wins unless they get a lot of injuries(like more than 3 to their every day players)|`|AA10527991	Man, I hate them, but I think they'll be really good this year.  1st or 2nd place, play-offs.|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	1st or 2nd|`|QNqtthJ0aa	well they got the best players money can buy! but............ money does not win you championships. especially they way the AL east is. i can respect the teams who built there team with a low budget and throw the draft(phillies)|`|4vBoQFRNaa	0-162. just kidding.

O5Q4GP59aa	They'll cheer for Sundin and boo Wellwood.|`|e988ed7544169780dcd7b32a3a51a123aa	I would be embarrassed and disappointed if Leaf fans booed him. He was the face of the franchise for 13 years, and is the all time leader in goals and points. He was arguably the most popular player for well over a decade, and is probably the best Leaf player in their modern history. <br>  So what if he didn't waive his no trade clause? Would it really have made a difference 6 months ago if we had gotten a couple of additional draft picks? The Leafs' rebuilding phase will take 3-4 years at least anyway, and a couple of players that Sundin could've been traded for would NOT have made any difference in the long run. <br>  Besides, in 6 or 7 years, when the Leafs honour his number at the ACC, no one will remember this little thing. They will all be on their feet cheering, which is what I hope they do on Saturday.|`|LUjCnYmoaa	i am kind of on the fence with this one, i loved Sundin as a Leaf but hate him as a Canuck. I think what he did was heartless , took offers from all those teams, made a big stink in the media.and everything would go silent. then it was big new again. Then you see him on a poker stars commercial. its like he was trying to get all the attention onto him. Yes no doubt he may be one of the best leaf captain's, and yes we miss him. <br>  But boo him for now. we all know in 10 years his name and number will be in the top of the ACC, and that'ss when he can get a standing ovation|`|KyCJOR2paa	I would think so, it would be a travesty if they didn't.  They were the ones wanting him to leave anyway, so its not like he deserted them.  He really wanted to stay.|`|FYiKgeN8aa	I personally believe it will be half and half.|`|uFgV95Fmaa	Why would you boo him? This is a guy that has spent almost his entire career with the leafs as their captain. He is someone who should be getting a standing ovation by the fans and personally i would give him one too. I think if you were playing a team which had no hopes for making the playoffs for the next 3-4 years, you would never stay with that team. You would simply move on and go and try to win a stanley cup(in his case), and make the playoffs. Overall, i think fans should be giving him a standing ovation and cheers.|`|25VewjWeaa	Why? He was ur franchise player for over a decade, and he deserves that right not to waive his no trade clause. The toronto organization had enough respect for him to sign him to a contract with a no trade clause. If he doesn't want to waive it, fine. Why should you boo him? Would the draft picks and prospects u get in return for mats sundin help u win the stanley cup? I don't think so. As a Canucks fan, I can only hope that the Leaf fans will not boo him and instead give him a standing ovation for what he has done for your franchise for 13 yrs.|`|e4SNJ6smaa	If i know the leafs fans i think they are going to cheer for him. He holds most of the leafs records and he was their only good players in the past  years so yes they will definitely cheer for him. But when he steps forth into the Bell Centre on Tuesday he will be booed every time he touches the puck.<br>  <br>  Go Habs Go!|`|WX4kxxr8aa	yeah,the move was really the fault of the gm not sundin's,they tried to force him to drop his no trade clause and when he didnt they made him look like the bad guy,screw the maple leafs gm for doing that too,mats was the most loyal player in the league.|`|BrWVhd9naa	Yes of course there is no reason to boo him|`|rsplkyvNaa	Nope. We still love him<br>  <br>  Go Leafs, Go!|`|lHzBJA4eaa	I can't believe people are actually grateful to Sundin.Don't you people know how filthy rich this guy is now? He was sickeningly overcompensated for anything he may have ,or even could have done for the Leafs.There is no justifying any player making over a million a season ,does anybody realize how much money that is? Anyways , the Leafs have secured Sundin's family for generations to come and you are saying the guy was right for not wanting to be inconvenienced by a move during the season? That was a horribly selfish and ungrateful move on his part .He had a chance to give a little back and gave the Leafs the proverbial finger....the Classy guy that he is..<br>  <br>   As for Wellwood .The guy was a wizard with the puck and Quinn shut him down .Quinn said in an interview Wellwoods moves were the kind of moves that get guys watching from the pressbox.He took Wellwoods game away from him and the guy never got it back. Quinn would have benched Gretzky for not backchecking .
CFm0u13Paa	Any gun will last longer if lower powered ammo is used. It means less wear and tear per shot fired. <br>  <br>  Also, any round can overpenetrate, depending on what you are shooting at. For typical home defense use, the .357 Sig is definitely overkill. <br>  <br>  The .357 Sig is a good caliber but it is not worth its cost. The 9mm or .40SW can do the self defense job almost as well for less than 1/2 the cost per shot. That translates to more practice ammo for the same amount of money and we all know that bullet placement is far more important than caliber. <br>  <br>  That said, your best bet is a .357 Magnum revolver. It is the best all-around handgun in the world. It handles almost all handgun chores exceptionally well, can fire anything from very powerful .357 ammo down to light .38 Special target loads, is utterly reliable, and is extremely user friendly. Unlike .357 Sig ammo, .357 Mag and .38 Special ammo is available almost anywhere and is the cheapest centerfire ammo there is.|`|AA12034449	bystanders are an issue...and you are accountable for every bullet you send down range-regardless of caliber.<br>  <br>  .357 sig ... it has a reputation for overpenetration. My beef... there are several affordable calibers that are just as or more effective.<br>  <br>  40 SW or .357 Magnum are very effective man-stoppers and I can shoot those common calibers (and find 1000's of pistols chambered for those) at a price I can afford.<br>  <br>  In my opinion... 5 years from now 357 Sig will be hard to get.... it hasnt caught on very well and it really doesnt fill a need that isnt already met.|`|AA11640949	Anything strong enough to stop an assailant will overpenetrate.  That's just a fact of using a gun/rifle/shotgun for self-protection.  Check out Box of Truth website and read a few of the reports.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theboxotruth.com/docs/theboxotruth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.theboxotruth.com/docs/theboxo...</a><br>  <br>  Anytime you shoot any caliber handgun or rifle you are wearing out the barrel.  So technically, yes you are wearing the barrel, but you will have plenty plenty of shots with that caliber. If you are going to be shooting let's just say once a month, that pistol will last you for many many years.  You gotta shoot a weapon just about every day to wear out a barrel quickly... ie, in 2-3 years.<br>  <br>  And I agree with Jeff on all accounts regarding caliber selection.|`|GmRscBkPaa	Lots of good advice by others here.<br>  <br>  But keep in mind. Most people dont realize just how flimsy most homes are...You have a layer of drywall, (and if you dont hit the stud) a layer of insulation, a layer of plywood, and finally probably some vinyl siding.  Nothing really substantial to stop a bullet from leaving your house.  So use caution, and keep your downrange clear, or be aware at least.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I have two 9mm's in my house (Beretta 92fs with CTC laser grip, and a FNH FNP-9) and I feel plenty safe.  I'm trained. And I practice.  The ammo is affordable, and easy to find.<br>  <br>  If you are overly worried about overpenetration, maybe you should look at a shotgun for home defense?|`|bgxYKsGiaa	it will take many many thousand rounds of ammo for that gun to wear i like the knock down power of a 357 but i like the handleing of a 9mm|`|FhHIAbmLaa	First and foremost, I hate this whole over penetration thing. <br>  <br>  If you want to drop a bad man, you need the biggest caliber you can handle. A 40 is better than a 9mm, a .45 is better than a .40. <br>  <br>  But all three will do the job. In fact all three have the power to drive right through a man/crack head, and cause damage to another person.<br>  <br>  This is why there are so many ammo options on the market today. From Glaser's to Ball ammo.<br>  <br>  I don't personally like the 357 sig. To me its just a hot 9mm. Not that that's bad, but we have had one for years, and its called a 38 Super. A 9mm wil cause the same wound as a 357 sig.  The 357 sig is a necked down .40, so one could change the caliber of a gun with a simple barrel swap.<br>  <br>  Anyway, get a good expanding round from Cor-bon, or Hornady, and your 357 sig will penetrate 10 inches and do a lot of damage inside. I bet a Cor-bon 124 grain round will work just fine.<br>  <br>  Oh and by the way I own a p226 in 9mm, and an XD in 45. I love both. I have extensive training as that I am a police officer, an recommend the XD. The P226 is in my opinion the best out of the box 9mm on the market, especially for the money, but the XD is a simple striker fired gun that is easiest to master for the beginer shooter.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|ev48pcJ5aa	sig p226 and sa xd are both excellent choices, i say go with .40 s&w or 9mm don't bother messing around with .357 sig, 40 and 9mm will get the job done with more convenience to you.  as far as lifespan goes i would think that sig would design their gun to shoot whatever round its made for, and all the sigs i've come across are sturdy guns. same goes for xd,  and when in a defensive situation you should always worry about were your rounds are going regardless of what type they are|`|jxXHlwIDaa	My issue with the .357 sig is that it is bottle-necked and uses bullets one thousandth smaller than .357 or .38 bullets and one thousandth bigger than a nine mil.  However I hand-load, so those are more of an issue.  If you have a good 9mm that you are accurate with then I would stick with that or get something in .40, which ammo is much more common for|`|VpXrsxGGaa	you should get a small shot gun , they are powerful at close range and have little to no over penetration (pending on your ammo) and they are  fun as hell
Y4mz8BShaa	@Thomas S: Western Arms airsoft guns can't even run green gas without breaking. They're pathetic for how much they cost. Only worth considering to buy if you live in Japan.<br>  <br>  There is no "best". The best for you is what's in your budget, fits what you need it for, is one you like, etc. The best is what you like and need personally.<br>  <br>  Bests, in terms of quality:<br>  AEG's: Systema.<br>  GBB's: KWA or We. Just comes down to personal preference here. They're both great. An Airsoft SurgeOn takes it over them.<br>  Gas sniper rifles: ARES, unless you want the $2k+ Mantis.<br>  Spring bolt actions: Marushin or Maruzen. Again, personal preference.<br>  Shotguns: Marushin, unless you buy an Airsoft SurgeOn.<br>  <br>  Worst:<br>  All: Unbranded.<br>  Unnumbered CYMA's, or numbered below the lower than the CM028/S.<br>  Well.<br>  Double Eagle (Unless you want a shotgun.)<br>  Both Elephant.<br>  UTG (Unless you want an L96 or overpriced, rebranded DE shotgun.)<br>  HFC (With a few exceptions.)<br>  UHC (With a few exceptions.)<br>  TM (Overpriced, underpowered plastic. The better stock JG's has better performance than a stock TM. Only good if you're in Japan.)<br>  WA (Just like TM, except to a much greater degree.)<br>  <br>  Actually, avoid just about every brand you don't see on AirsoftGI. They only sell quality airsoft guns and items, except for 1%- of their selection.|`|I0g24Jmkaa	it's all about personal preference.|`|8V3z1bd5aa	Well, when i go to look for a gun i go to shortyusa.com because it has like hundreds of guns and there all pretty well priced.|`|yvHUAHZQaa	Western Arms.

mEZpqzkMaa	Kettlebells, look like cannon balls with a handle they are far differnt than many other free weights. They are essentially a gym in one piece of equipment.

So another problem comes up regarding the space for those things. I know they are popular right now but I think a bit overrated. I like regular weights myself. <br>  <br>     a regular Kettlebell usually looks like a bowling ball with a handle on it.|`|w9kSGLBxaa	Kettle bells are not supposed to be used like regular weights. They are used to build muscle endurance and build your fast twitch muscles. They are meant to do more reps with lighter weight at with an explosive movement. <br>  <br>  They have work outs that are exclusive to kettle bells that work great.

QTd8MVDjaa	I like Alien Workshop/Habitat the best. Nice shape and pop. I like DC shoes because of the super suede they use. It last very long. Bam just sucks. Some friends of mine saw him at Rye Airfield and they said he was doing terrible. I guess I like Dyrdek better. He's better at skating, but he's way overrated because of his shows. And i don't like AWS and DC because of Dyrdek, that's a coincidence, haha.|`|Lt2lktgFaa	by fav. brand is plan B and girl b/c the skateboards are lght and last long<br>  fav. shoes e's and emerica<br>  i like e's b/c it has very good grip and so does emerica<br>  defitnly Rob Dyrdek better<br>  hope i helped.

AA12283403	Yes, the technology has move past the Trimetal, but it is a club that was truely ahead of it's time and lead the way to today's clubs.<br>  <br>  Since it's not urgent for you to change, take your time and try various clubs. Adams makes great clubs and you might like the Insight line of fairway woods. <br>  <br>  While it's easy to think about the well know brands (Nike, Taylormade, etc.) don't forget other brands like Tour Edge. Take a look a the Exotics line, great clubs at afforable prices.<br>  <br>  In any case, ENJOY!|`|Wa7wktLkaa	i don't understand why you would want similar feel/performance?<br>  <br>  stick with your club<br>  <br>  if you want to upgrade, may i suggest burners or cleveland hi borexls.<br>  <br>  theyre both super clubs.

Z had a mark on his neck! Villanueva got a flagrant for fouling Varejao and got ejected for grabbing Z by the neck. Z got a technical, but did not get kicked out. Villanueva should be fined and suspended for grabbing Z by the neck!<br>  <br>  GO CAVS!|`|rTbKXMMpaa	Z didnt get ejected. Varejo got a reboud but he was brought down by the head by Vilanueva.

Cf7rZsyzaa	since he's got a new ride this year, anyone who switches cars and doesnt transfer points from the previous season with a car that was in the top 35  is a go or go homer.|`|uEW2LQI0aa	when he switched cars he did not get his points from last year so he is not in the top 35. <br>  joey logano got stewart's points from last year and thats why he don't need to try to make the race on time, he's already in it|`|Avmolxyqaa	Yep, he was a go or go homer.  And no he wasn't the only past champ, Terry Labonte and Bill Elliot were also past winners.|`|zii6IWHoaa	The car he is driving now was the #70 which was not in top 35 but Tony is the most recent champion not in the top 35 so he will make the races using thata if he has to. He can use the Former champion provisional 6 times but dont think it will come to that|`|8Z3PEaGeaa	He is not in the top 35 points going into this season.<br>  Maybe someone else has more details.|`|i8soZLfRaa	Well, sort of, but not really. He's in his own #14 this year and therefore isn't in the top 35 in owner's points. He either had to qualify his way in, or use one of of his "Former Champion" provisionals. He was the only former champion on the list, so he was making the show either way. However, he only gets to play that card a limited number of times, so it really behooves him to qualify his way in.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Terry Labonte and Bill Elliott weren't entered this week. Besides that, of the 3, he is the most recent champion not in the top 35, and would get to use the provisional before them unless he were to qualify his way in (which he did, by the way).|`|yt4PN1R4aa	because the 14 car used to be the 70 car which finished outside the Top 35 in Owner's Points last year. so after Bristol Tony won't be a go or go homer but it doesn't really matter because he can use the Champion's Provisional.|`|UyvkM7feaa	Because his car is not in the top 35 YET but soon will be with the way that he is racing/qualifying but since he is the latest Champion, he is pretty much guaranteed a spot. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|ZxbaTcHbaa	he has a new ride nd the piont of  the old car is not in the top 35

I have followed the tournament and am still hung up on who will win. As they are playing doubles together, I believe they will win that title, but the singles...I guess I believe the edge goes to Victoria Azarenka. I think Caroline is just as talented and has so much promise but Azarenka has a title this year already, proving she can step up...truthfully I have no idea if I will be right and I hope Wozniacki wins but I like Azarenka too! Let's hope for a good match.|`|ClQ9yJweaa	While I like both and have mentioned a few times that these 2 were/are up and comers to watch out for, Im going with Azarenka. I think she has a bit  more of a total game, and powerful ground game. Will be close though and probably a 3 setter.|`|87BjduXvaa	I think Azarenka will <br>  <br>  but i would like to see Wozniacki win <br>  <br>  i dont like Azarenka

Now when the board is up use your left foot and take your shoe and slide it up against the grip tape, kind of like your ankle is twisted. Keep repeating until you get that down. Then try and rid and do it. Pretty soon you'll do it! ;)
dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	If you are a martial artist you should never "start" a fight no matter what. Anything else is not being a martial artist...however if you are talking about breaking up a bad situation (guy beating wife, thugs beating kid, etc.) then I applaud you for helping out...but even then you should call the police and only be there until they arrive. <br>  <br>  In terms of killing someone in a street fight it can and does happen but most of the time it was by accident and not intentional. It takes a severely sick mind to kill someone or even want to. I would recommend you realize that people who live violently typically die violently and pick a better outlet for your aggressive tenancies. If not you may one day end up the dead one in a street fight.|`|QQqhzuNDaa	How come you are not in jail? The last thing society needs is violent people. You will rot in hell.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	and if you have been in a lot of fights then you would have been arrested.<br>  street fighting is illegal, regardless of whether of  not both people agree it is still assault.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	A normal fistfight usually won't end up with a death, and I would say the chance is miniscule. Unless it's a premeditated murder or a manslaughter by a very disturbed individual.<br>  <br>  Most severe injuries that happen in a fight usually happen in the fall, rather than in the actually impact of the fist or kick.<br>  Falling on shaarp edge of steps or knocking the head on a big rock..<br>  <br>  The whole discussion obviously become different when you're talking about streetfight involving weapon.|`|ibLDnFMRaa	It depends on the part of the body you hit em and the Strength or power you use in the hit. Example:<br>  If you hit a dude with your fist behind the neck you could kill him, if you hit him against the wall you can kill him. It all depends on you.|`|szcA8CDyaa	It depend how strong your opponent is, it depend where you hit your opponent and it depend how strong you are.|`|mlTF11Pwaa	I don't know the exact statistic but I do know it depends on a lot of fators. Body build is one. Yourtraining is another, if your just someone who likes to fight then there's less chance. If you've been trained in a martial art there is more of a chance. Your relationship with the other person is a factor as well.<br>  <br>  If you are afraid of killing someone then stop fighting. I too like to fight but i don't show any remorse, and my problem is I lose control and get too angry which is why I try to avoid fighting at all costs. There's nothing big and there's noting clever about fighting. It's just a way for us guys to show who#s top dog but fightings not the only way.<br>  <br>  Just watch what you do and if you do fight someone, then fight until the person is badly injured or submits, after this you've won some people carry on, like I have in the past, and it gets you no where good so just watch what you do.|`|13360f8150c9715c66a1ecb9c2002c6aaa	Wonder why no one ever wonders how easy it would be for them to be killed in a street fight .<br>  <br>  These days very easy and that doesn't take into consideration being maimed or crippled for life .<br>  Pick the wrong guy and you can never tell who that is and he will kill you either on the spot or come back later with a gun or knife or swarm you with his buddies.|`|mEZpqzkMaa	Low unless you are trying to kill the other person, I have only had one instance where I was concerned about the other person. What you have to watch out for is unintentionally hitting somones head on the ground or on a hard surface during a scuffle this is what can cause unintentional deaths.|`|xUNmNk6paa	about 10% chance if there are no weapons and no intent to kill|`|fRosDAZEaa	Dude, you are so cool!
oqQjnpfGaa	Keep A. Parker for now because Larry Hughes is still unproven in NY but A. Parker has been good (but inconsistent) this season. <br>  <br>  If you have someone else you could drop in a deep league like Eddie House or Vladimir Radmnovic, then Larry Hughes is an okay bet. <br>  <br>  Hope this was helpful.|`|c9PHwfVMaa	I don't think you should. Hughes has not played for a long time, so he'll have an even harder time adjusting to D'Antoni's run and gun offense.|`|dtiCJwDAaa	i think it wont hurt u to drop parker, but i doubt hughes will be what u r looking for. no doubt he'll have moments as the knicks r run and gone and great for smaller shooters, but look at q-rich's stats and think similar.
RjQLB9s1aa	I came across tis ruling by accident but the maximum logo size is 3 square inches or 19.5 square cms.|`|nLXKmcnBaa	i've never heard of there being a limit.

Cl6KbcAGaa	from what I can tell you have a generic frame made by almost any mfg that could have been a sponsor at the BC challenge race up there in Canada (British Columbia) and it does not stand for "bike components" at all. That is why you or I cannot find it ....There may be no way of knowing what frame you have there but if you take a pic of it and post it here we may be able to help further. Stickers are not hard to remove and reapply if you know how to do it....and this frame was likely donated by one of the sponsors and given away at the race and now you have it!
sitkfn5Maa	1v1 or dbl elimo, depends if you want it to finish fast or enjoy your time hitting the ball.
AA11048920	They are not insane. They are just uncultured, uneducated and trashy like Vick who probably spent his time in prison on his knees servicing his fellow prisoners because he doesn't have enough of a brain to think of anything else to do. Trash is trash. There is not much you can do with it.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I don't really know many people who think he did nothing wrong, but the man went to jail, he paid his debt to society, there comes a time when you have to give a man a second chance.  How many other people in sports have done worse and spent no time in jail?  Ray Lewis killed a man, Kobe raped a chick, and they didn't even miss a f**king game.  <br>  <br>  I'm in no way condoning what he did, but if we give second chances to murderers and rapists, why punish Vick so much more harshly?  I mean, seriously, people who are all against Vick need to let go.  He made a mistake that many blacks in inner city gangs do when it comes to dog fighting, he just got caught because of his stature.  I'd actually be surprised if there weren't more athletes who "went back to their roots" and did dispicable acts such as this but never got caught.  Vick is the only one I know of thats ever actually had to spend time in jail, so leave it at that and let the guy play.<br>  <br>  Edit:  For people who think Vick went to jail because he's black, get real.  Maybe he did get the harshest penalty for dogfighting, but that was because of who he was, a star athlete, and they wanted to make an example out of him, it wasn't because he was black.  I'd be willing to bet that 95% of the people involved in dogfighting are black, so thats not an issue.  What about the other black athletes who have gotten away with murder and rape??|`|Oes7TRNVaa	bilbitybilbty- u sound stupid. I haven't even heard anything about Matt Linart. Whatever he did was not that serious and they are not talking about it. Mike Phelps is not going to jail for what he did and u don't see Santonio Holmes in a picture smoking weed. Race is a huge part in everyhting today. Most blacks are judged before people even know them.<br>  <br>  Im from Virginia and i know a lot of dog fighters. it's been going on for years. Vick has served the most time EVER for this crime. <br>  <br>  It's so many more crazy people in this country to worry about than Mike Vick playing football. People need to get over it.|`|m7BFxtBkaa	I think you have this mis-understood. Michael Vick did wrong. However, some people think that the punishment for his wrongdoings was not entirely suitable for his actions. People have killed people, human beings, and still gotten to remain active in the NFL. (just look at the Cowboys roster)<br>  <br>  My point is, Michael Vick hosted the killings of a couple dogs. I'm sure nobody can "side with his actions," but these people you have seen may just be upset about what they thought was a ridiculous punishment. <br>  <br>  Not that I disagree with Vick's sentence, I'm just putting what these people are thinking into perspective.|`|ABoo1doVaa	Is someone really playing the race card? You just need to look at what happened to Michael Phelps and Matt Leihnart if you think whites get a free pass. Santonio Holmes gets busted with weed and is super bowl MVP. Phelps has a picture taken with a bong that may or may not contain weed, and he is suspended for 3 months.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, most people are insane, and Vick fans are no different.|`|6tGYe5roaa	Yea I don't get the people that think he did completely nothing wrong. I don't understand it. I can see why some people would be more angry with what he did than others. But either way he killed innocent dogs (living creatures). That is so wrong and inhumane.|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  It isn't just the fact that he did what he did to the dogs, but also the fact that when the judge let him out on bail, he was told not to do anything illegal. So he went out and had a big old smoke out with him and his buddies. Then when he heard that the Falcons were going to sue him for his bonus money and creditors were going to come after him, he went on a huge spending spree to use up all of that money. This guy has serious social issues. Not respecting authority is just the tip of the iceberg.|`|4KF2cZWkaa	dude , im from the south, this kind of stuff happens everyday, just because this went public everybody's like "ohhh those pooor dogs, ohhh those poor chickens", who cares. its a thing thats been goin on for years and years and nothing is gonna stop it. if you punish vick then you have to punish thousands of other people that do it everyday. shouldnt murderers and robbers be filling up prisons instead of "dog fighers"???|`|uFk8ohenaa	yea he did something wrong but one thing about it is race..it plays a key role...if it were a white man lets say Peyton Manning then there wouldn't be that much of a big deal and he would have a smaller sentencing probably but when its a black then everybody is talking and saying crap...the way the world is.|`|AA12179372	The past is the past, it's called moving on and the world is still spinning. He is finishing his time and in July he will of done his time and paid for his actions, what else do you want?|`|5S1Jhabsaa	yeah they are so completely insane. He used dog fighting which is totally cruel and people are trying to pretend like nothing ever happened?? those are the kind of people that tick me off.|`|FQkG7Olxaa	Mike Vick is my ni#ga. Y'all need to lay off him.|`|7oZv4KMhaa	Yeh, he plead guilty too.|`|2DONQLJoaa	Yes<br>  <br>  I can say anymore <br>  it gets me way to mad|`|e9hneRYcaa	whoever think he doesn't deserve an other chance is insane even though what he did was horrible.|`|KZ4jEx3Saa	yep
Tqof0Frnaa	The whole not-having-a-back-handspring-thing holds you back. I'd say level 5 or 6? But even those levels need backs in their floor routines.|`|7Rgta7BAaa	yeah i think about 5.. but you really need your backhandspring.. and a kip on bars wouldnt hurt either.|`|GTOEEJAEaa	Level four...but your really need a backhandspring.
G02yovrpaa	God yes. Every game you see with him in it he's whining. Maybe if he would grow some balls like Ovechkin or Richards then he wouldnt be regarded as such a baby. As of now I still hate him. Go Flyers|`|KyCJOR2paa	I think he is getting better. He's only 21 or something like that, what do you expect when you play on a crappy team. That team has only 4 forwards with any talent. Malkin, Crosby, Staal, and Sykora.<br>  <br>  The only way he is overrated is the fact that if he is rated as the "best" player in the game. He is not the best player. Its starting to show because he needs players with some form of talent around him to put the puck in the net, Ovechkin is the best because he does it ALL alone. Usually I think Malkin is better than Crosby too. The only time I've seen Crosby play better than Malkin was in the Stanley Cup Finals, but supposedly Malkin was sick.<br>  <br>  Right now Pavel Datsyuk is also better, also it is easier to compare them offensively because they are both "playmakers". They now have the same amount of points in the same amount of games. The big difference is defensively. Datsyuk is a +31, Crosby a +2. Datsyuk 16PIM, Crosby 65PIM. Datsyuk FO%=57.5%, Crosby FO%=50.6%. Takeaways, Datsyuk 67, Crosby 44. Giveaways, Datsyuk 34, Crosby 57. Shootouts... Datsyuk 50%, Crosby 16.7%.<br>  <br>  All of this while Datsyuk is playing 3 minutes less per game. Datsyuk has been taking over games lately, and consistently putting up great numbers. Datsyuk does have a little more to work with, but right now he is absolutely on fire.|`|5etFAmrsaa	I posted a similar statement/question like this a while ago. Mostly everybody who answered disagreed. But I agree with you. Crosby is a baby, and overrated|`|szJzZ9myaa	Crosby's overrated and a whiner, Malkin clearly is the better player out of the two. Crosby always has a mistery injury to blame his counter-performances on and he's not even man enough to fight one on one, remember in December when he jumped Valabik from behind and sucker punched him in the nuts twice? A pretty face to move merchandise for the Pens and NHL, that's all he is.|`|AA11674745	Well, I don't HATE the kid. In fact, despite my razzing, I have nothing against him at all - he's the one that has to wear a penguin on his chest.<br>  <br>  Any razzing I do about him is directed at those ultra-bandwagon fans who say he's the next Gretzky or that he's the greatest player today.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think he's a very good player.|`|YBpjA72faa	Crosby is a baby, but he is not overrated. Crosby is one of the best players in the league and is incredibly talented. His talent combined with his tendency toward whining are the main reasons that people, like me, hate him, but respect his ability.|`|BrWVhd9naa	Thank u he whines more than he plays hockey<br>  he is also OVERRATED <br>  Malkin is better see the stats|`|ll2y4YIGaa	i think that your "D' stands for "Douchebag"<br>  who cares if he whines and is overrated.<br>  its not the end of the world|`|73497192043f691fc7e45302378fe790aa	Sid didn't ask to be "the face of the NHL."  Maybe people should think about what it like to come into a professional sport and be expected to "save" it, especially at the age of 18.  He didn't ask for all the attention he's getting.  Sid is more professional than most people 10 or 20 years older than him.  If you don't live in Pittsburgh you don't know all the great things he does for the community, like starting a program to give any child 4-8 years old all the equipment necessary to start to play hockey, FREE OF CHARGE.  Maybe you should all stop being so jealous and grow up!!!!!!!!!!|`|wfDzUSItaa	He's really the next "Great One". He whines as much as Gretzky did when he played. Always looking for a call whenever they got touched, bump them a little and they're off their game. Look real close after he gets knocked down you can see the tears trying to fall. Just wait for those Gretzky like tantrums, the only guy I ever saw throw a stick from the bench and not get called for it.|`|LNdvERqDaa	Not at all ...it's called playing the game. He has nobody to defend him, so he sometimes scraps and mixes it up, and secondly, if he plays like a ''baby'' in the game - all the more power to him for drawing penalities and getting people off their game. total bias in the answers...especially coming from the flyers fan lmao<br>  <br>  go leafs go!|`|YKF4SRabaa	Sidney Crosby is the best player in the NHL. Hes a great play maker and makes everyone around him better. He isn't a baby. He is always taking cheap shots and sticks to the face and after all of that he goes and scores a goal or sets up a goal. Ovechkin sucks. Go Pens! Flyers Suck!|`|mXqnBavGaa	100% agree with you.|`|S3ODbpV8aa	Yes I agree|`|UHcFz93caa	i couldnt agree more with evrything you just said..GO FLYERS|`|O5Q4GP59aa	Of course! Didn't you know that Crosby can be rearranged to "Cry SOB"?|`|FY17j1Ajaa	Most people who hate Crosby don't see him play on a regular basis. Does he bark at the officials a lot? You bet he does. All star players have. Gretzky in his prime ALMOST called penalties against players who checked him too hard. You couldn't touch him! Is he overrated? Maybe, he is an excellent player who plays both ends of the ice. Anti-Crosby fans believe that Malkin and Ovechkin are better players. They both are better goal scorers, no doubt. But the two great Russians are notorious for defensive gaffes and it is here that Crosby blows them away. He is not pathetic at all. I don't know who your favorite team is, but you would appreciate Crosby if he was on your team. And he would be your top line center.|`|hX089rlnaa	I don't like Sidney either, but to say he is over rated is wrong. He is still one of the top 10 players on the ice today. There a re a LOT of other players who do their share of whining. Just because you don't like a player doesn't negate his skills. I HATE Patrick Roy, but I still have to admit he was one of the best goalies to play the game. (gag, gag).|`|C2urTrMtaa	As a new hockey fan last year, i thought he was the most amazing thing ever. I did all my projects in school on him, i wrote on my arms, everything. But then i ACTUALLY researched deeper into this psycho obsession of mine and found out, wow, i'm dumb. He cries over a little tiny hit and stupid things like that, and he starts fights for no reason. That one on McLean was bullshit. I couldn't believe he did that. The only thing he has now is looks but every time I look at him, i see tears in his eye because i now think hes a pus.|`|nWHwzTjNaa	yes i hate him|`|oJsrGmmPaa	I don't agree....he's a whiner. Adults can whine too. I work with a lot of them.
kszkMlcXaa	that's a pretty good time, and you're only a 6th grader. do track, and you'll eventually be able to run even faster than that. keep it up and then in high school you'll continue to improve. you may also want to look into long jump, as most 100m runners make good long jumpers.<br>  <br>  the guy who said he ran the 100m in 9.23 seconds is a douchebag, don't listen to him. the world record is 9.69 by usain bolt, so there is no way that he can run the 100 in that time.|`|rkIdwsc1aa	ransomerr said<br>  "LOL NO!

5bf66864f5e85f953cdb3ff01887ae4daa	I would have to say dark colors. Although i don't lure fish that often i am a fly fisherman and know that in dark water the best option is dark colors like brown and black-the reason is simple they cast a shadow under the water that the fish can detect.<br>  <br>  In clear water then brighter colors like orange work very well. Green and black is an EXCELLENT color combination in water that's a mix of contrasts.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	I like reds and yellows.|`|q8dX0MsNaa	chartreuse or fire tiger would be your best bets in really dirty water. <br>  if your lure vibrates or rattles a lot,the fish will find it anyway. they don't really need to see it. <br>  a black or dark colored plastic worm will also be good if you're a worm fisherman. <br>  you might also try a noisy topwater or buzzbait. try waking a big colorado blade spinnerbait in chartreuse or chartreuse/white.|`|AA11016927	In my opinion, good colors for very muddy water would be these:<br>  <br>  1.

qXQa06bAaa	Here in the UK, fishing for Carp is as popular as Bass fishing is in the USA.... and as a result, just as the USA is a world leader in lure fishing technology, the UK is a world leader in inventing ways to fish for Carp.<br>  <br>  On days they're jumping about (especially when it's warm), they're usually to busy breeding to care about food.... but fishing with surface baits is a popular way to catch them in the UK during the summer months when they appear to be feeding on the surface.<br>  <br>  One of the sneaky techniques we use is a "hair rig", where the bait is threaded onto a needle, then slid onto a seperate length of line attached to the hook: <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_rig" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_rig</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gofishing.co.uk/Advice/Knots/Search-Results/Hook-and-Swivel-Knots/Knotless-knot-hair-rig/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gofishing.co.uk/Advice/Knots/...</a><br>  <br>  They're then used in conjunction with either a "bolt rig", or a controller float, with either a matchbox sized chunk of bread crust, or a "pop-up boilie" for bait (among other options)<br>  <a href="http://www.carpanglersgroup.com/hairandboltrig.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.carpanglersgroup.com/hairandb...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.anglersnet.co.uk/Rig-Section/Carp-Rigs/surface_carp_rig.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anglersnet.co.uk/Rig-Section/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.carp.net/float.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.carp.net/float.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.anglersnet.co.uk/Carp-Fishing-Articles/stalk_carp.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anglersnet.co.uk/Carp-Fishing...</a><br>  <br>  See also:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wng6OVnJ9B0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wng6OVnJ9...</a> (around 6m 20secs into the clip)|`|KJWxqQHiaa	Get a hook, or treble hook, and make a doughball into little balls to mold around the hook. Put a couple split-shots about a foot and a half above the hook and your ready to go. I like to use 14 lb. monofilament on all my reels. And if you don't want to make a messy doughball, use corn or Wheaties as stated above.<br>  If you have any more Q's about fishing, just send me a message with them and I'll answer the best i can.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped ya out.|`|VyEB8c4Naa	What I always do here in Iowa is use corn. It works great and you don't have all those other fish trying to get your bait...Well, I haven't caught anything else on corn but the carp love it! One thing you can do for some catfish bait is gut the carp. Channel cat love the guts. But you have to use the guts within 1-2 days. Another things you can do is take the carp home after you gutted them and wrap them in newspaper and let them sit out for a few days in the sun until they're a little soft(not too soft!). Then you just fillet them out and you have a bunch of great meat for cat fishing!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|fSJrgVU7aa	I've had the best luck on carp using Wheaties. Take a handful of the cereal, crunch it up and dip your hand in water. Knead it into a tough dough then pack it around a #10 treble hook. Use just enough to completely cover the hook. Fish it on the bottom with a slip sinker rig or with just enough weight to cast as far as you need to and to hold the bottom in the current. I've never failed to catch carp with this set-up.|`|yAqhqxVQaa	i like to carp fish too, and the 2 best baits to use are boiled corn and boilies. make sure u have a good reel and pole, cus they can put up a great fight. dont waste money on commercial baits eihter, until you get a feel for what they like to eat, good luck, and remember to be patient|`|tThI3nWiaa	I haven't done it in years but when I was a boy in New Jersey  we would used corn meal with a few drops of vanilla . use a large hook and very little weight.

TeNIStN1aa	Pyrodex could be used in black powder revolvers. Not all Pyrodex pellets are suitable for black powder revolvers though. You need to use those 44/45 caliber 30 grain black powder equivalent (volume) pistol pellets designed for black powder handguns; they could be used in rifles as well.<br>  <br>  Sabots are not intended to be used in black powder revolvers. Their length alone will prevent revolvers from functioning properly. If you don't like to shoot lead balls, you can shoot conical bullets of proper diameters designed for "revolver" use; you can't use conical bullets designed for rifles. Not all stores carry conical bullets for revolvers and they could be a little hard to find sometimes. If you can't find them through local sources or online, then your best bet will be gun shows. In worst case, you will have to find a custom bullet caster or cast your own bullets.<br>  <br>  PS: Conical molds are easy to find.<br>  <br>  Pyrodex 44/45 caliber pistol pellets:<br>  <a href="http://www.hodgdon.com/pyrodex-pellets.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hodgdon.com/pyrodex-pellets.h...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cabelas.com/prod-1/0012634213724a.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.cabelas.com/prod-1/0012634213...</a>|`|AA11694178	Pyrodex pellets don't come in a size for revolvers.  As far as I know, they are only made in .45 and .50 Caliber pellets.  Also one pellet, if it was of the correct diameter for your gun, would be too big of a charge.  the current Pyrodex pellets are 50 grains each.  That is too big of a charge for most revolvers.  Secondly, you cannot stuff a .45 caliber bullet or sabot into the chamber of a .44 caliber revolver.  It is best to use loose powder, either pistol Pyrodex or fffG black powder to load your revolver.  Refer to your owner's manual for the correct load.  Stick to the round balls for your revolver.  If you are having a hard time finding round balls, you are not looking in the right places.  Wal-Mart is not likely to carry .44 caliber balls.  You will have to go to a store where they carry a decent selection of muzzleloading guns and gear.  Your local gun store will have them, can get them for you or can tell you who in your area has them.<br>  <br>  Read your owners manual and follow what it says about loading.  If you don't want to do that or can't find the needed ammo components, do not shoot the gun.  Experimenting with loads when you don't know what you are doing can get you killed or injured.|`|ca92b64c79c7a08eb9a59b00b8d5e493aa	As others have said - not a good idea. In my repro Remington, I use ~20-25 grains of Pyrodox under a .454 round ball. I've seen the "Minie"conical round, but never fired one.<br>  <br>  The sabot is often used for sub-caliber rounds in a larger barrel...the benefit is higher speed and perhaps flatter trajectory. But they are not suited for pistol use.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Most of the pellets are ff powder, which is designed for rifles.  Most are far too much powder for a revolver as well.  If you could find a reasonable charge weight of fff powder in a pellet, it would work.  But like I said, I don't know of anyone that makes one.  I like the pyrodex fff powder in my revolver.  If you use a powder flask, it is as fast and maybe even more convenient than pellets.  It can be safely fired in any revolver made for black powder.  As for the bullet, don't waste your time with sabots in a revolver.  I'm not even sure of anyone that makes them for the revolver, and I suspect it would shed the plastic as it hit the forcing cone, like you said.  Not to worry though.  Cabela's has a conical bullet for the black powder revolvers.  It is more accurate than a round ball.  I've always been pretty satisfied with the round balls in my revolver, but if you're looking for something different, it might be worth a try.|`|d6fd3077bc1506ef3c2bb76a580cdb53aa	FIRST, Pyrodex is NOT more powerful than black powder, it is an "equivalent" that is alleged to be easier to clean up!<br>  It is also NOT any more reliable than BP.<br>  <br>  MOST BP handguns call for a 30gr. charge. To the best of my knowledge, pellets do NOT come in that size.  You COULD use "loose" pyrodex.<br>  <br>  The sabot WOULD try to come off and WOULD jam up the action. (They are designed for a SINGLE run down a 1-piece barrel, NOT to jump a gap!) <br>  Besides which, you could NOT load a sabot bullet into the weapon correctly. (Loading cuts a small ring of lead off of the ball guaranteeing a good seal in the chamber.  You ALSO need a "grease" topping to provide lubrication AND prevent a "chain fire", which would destroy the weapon.<br>  <br>  There are both balls AND round nose bullets available for ALL muzzleloading handguns.  (Personally, I prefer the ball.)  I shoot from .32 to .54 BP handguns, including single shot flintlock dueling pistols!
Jf8LiEw2aa	If the playoffs started today, Osgood would be the Game 1 starter. Not saying I agree with it, but that's how it's gonna be.|`|FY17j1Ajaa	Great Question. Right now, Conklin is the better option. He has outplayed Osgood and should be the starter.That said, Conklin has never had the opportunity to carry a team in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Can he do it?

Hasek was supposed to be the #1 guy all year but Ozzy was having the better season.  They still went into the playoffs saying there was no question who the starter was...Hasek.  I think it will play out the same way this year.  As long Ozzy isnt playing horribly right before the playoffs (although he very well might be), then I think management will give him the benefit of the doubt and start him in the playoffs.  If hes screws up, theyll be quick to put Conklin in.<br>  <br>  I really dont know what I would like to see happen personally.

t0PzSCs0aa	ah, my best stroke. =)<br>  i used to really hate back because i felt like a wasnt moving, and then i got these tips.<br>  <br>  for your start, arch your back as you shoot back and make sure you enter the water hands first, not head first of back first. fly kick/streamline.<br>  <br>  rotate (?) as you take each stroke, with one shoulder in the water and one shoulder out during each stroke.<br>  <br>  thumb out and pinky in.<br>  <br>  make sure your recovery (when your hand is in the air) is as speedy as possible. you want to shoot your hand through the air and back into the water.<br>  <br>  when your hand enters the water, it should first be extended fully and then bent at the elbow to pull the water through (you dont want your hand to just be rotating around, you want to push the water as you swing your hand toward your hip.)<br>  <br>  kick hard and fast, just like freestyle. dont be too deep.<br>  <br>  always look directly up, not at your feet or at the wall you just left. looking straight up keeps your hips from sinking and dragging as they do when your head is lifted.<br>  <br>  know your stroke count to turn and finish. it takes me 3 to turn and 4 to finish, but it may be different for you. confidence in a turn and finish is vitally important, as you will probably lose 3 or 4 seconds on each unconfident turn/finish.<br>  <br>  do fly kick/streamline after your turn.<br>  <br>  finish with your body at a diagonal (rather than flat on your back) and one hand reaching for the wall. give it a last powerful fly kick as youre about to hit the wall. look for the wall by tilting your head back, but not too far back.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  now on to butterfly!! =)|`|Hde1JsxEaa	I'm not the best at back but here are some of my coach's advice:<br>  <br>  Rotate over the long axis (kinda like free)<br>  keep your kick little but powerful and close to the surface<br>  thumb out of water first, pinky in first<br>  bend arm close to your body when taking your stroke<br>  keep stream-line when you push off<br>  <br>  There's some, hope they help :)|`|AA11473256	my backstroke was always bad, my starts i couldnt ark my back enough. pivot your body and keep your head straight? idk there is a lot to make it fast. stick to freestyle its what cool people do|`|WJcH24xCaa	keep your tummy up and your head back.<br>  Make sure your rotating when each arm goes into the water.

Long hair yes.|`|t1uKdzmLaa	I don't mind the haircut so much; but yes, he needs to switch back to pants...hahaha!<br>  Funny thing is that I was just complaining to my sister that he should go back to pants...and now, here is a question regarding that same topic. :P|`|41WXZPnCaa	Yep<br>  <br>  <br>  Jericho Without Pant's Is Not Jericho|`|ptDHZK7Jaa	YYYYEEEEESSSSSS!!!!!! ITS A MUST  no i honestly think he looks betta with short hair not with them hairs in the front but just short|`|IqhD4JCCaa	lol yea
BlgZmV6uaa	I always wondered why it was on him.That and the freaking "dance" he does on the way to the ring.Not takeing anything that he has done in the ring.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Maybe he's just having a bad month (like us girls do sometimes!)and needs to cover up? After all,he's stressed about his bro, has probably  eaten a little too much sweet stuff...and wouldn't you know it: Pimple City!<br>  <br>  The full face thing should go .. too Sting/Warrior like. *shiver*<br>  But a little still looks good on him, especially if he does that glow thing that he used to use on his arms and face for PPVs.|`|rjWlOAnEaa	I do. It makes him look like this emo granny that lives down the street over there. No, not that street; that one. Yeah, that's right.|`|DlQ5wL8saa	Nope i think he looks really cute with his face paint but  then sometimes is just good if he takes it off and shows hes cute face but either way hes awesome =)|`|2UkdpGHFaa	That's because he has "The Hardy Show" and his name there is "Itchweed".. So I guess he is trying to combine his off-air "personality" with his WWE Gimmick..<br>  <br>  But yes, IT SUCKS!|`|bB2ZuQMZaa	I dont mind if he has face paint or not, let him do what he wants. He's still awesome. WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!|`|hdp7bv45aa	It really doesn't matter to me if he has face paint on or not|`|pLYY0SlFaa	Yeah i totally agree i think he should get rid of it...it doesnt look good at all|`|JDuEuPM4aa	its him showing off his art and his personality and character, man, why people hating on a hobby or a style for|`|NLEhtg9Saa	IT DOES LOOK PRETTY DAMN STUPID.|`|wItJz5q2aa	No, he looks pretty wicked!|`|WtcTBlccaa	it looks stupid why is he doing that|`|O6VTWYDtaa	Why would he listen to a random fan|`|ptDHZK7Jaa	i agree i mean hes good and with the hair and all the colorful clothes is enough the first time i saw him with it i was like oh no no no mh mh|`|CQ9oxJXnaa	I think it looks cool.|`|JiCfYfLraa	yea he looks like ronald mcdonald|`|GJQIL0RZaa	I do
l1kMNykGaa	I dig the idea of bringing back the cruiserweight title.  You would have a good amount of wrestlers who could compete for it.  And ECW is a great place to develop the new talent before they break into Smackdown and Raw.|`|GJQIL0RZaa	Retired|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	I agree the Cruiserweight title needs to make a return.|`|94EakziUaa	At this point, no, but if they can bring in more cruiserweights, Yes.|`|XPzdxXfGaa	Yes they should. Possible contenders: Rey Mysterio, Chavo Guererro, Brian Kendrick, Evan Airbourne, Kung Fu Funaki, Jimmy Wang Yang, Jamie Noble, Kofi Kingston.|`|rwG4JPXQaa	3 wrestlers and one title,that would be boring|`|esZmuO89aa	yea thats a great idea|`|sCiuv7n3aa	No... i think they should develop the TAG TEAM MATCHES even better... cmon 2 single competition is enough do you think so....<br>  <br>  <br>  CMON TAG TEAM TITLES SEEMS WORTHLESS nowadays....<br>  <br>  <br>  Them cruiserweights could go and participate in tag matches and could make some nifty double team finisher|`|1YrHkxKvaa	yes and get rid of that god awful divas title

dfBwVxXFaa	don't psych yourself out kid, you will be fine.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	You are older and taller than I was the first time I shot a 12 gauge shotgun.  And that old scattergun kicked like a mule.  I've seen it literally knock some of my older cousins flat of their backs so I was scared of it.<br>  <br>  Then when I was 10 or 11 years old, my Big Mama was working the daylights out of me in her "garden" (IMO, fiver acres of corn and another five acres of peas and beans are too much to call a garden).  We'd been run into the house by a shower of rain, and Big Mama started cooking us some dinner.  We'd been having trouble with crows getting into the corn, and as the rain eased off, I noticed a big flock of crows settle into the corn.  Boy did I ever get mad!<br>  <br>  I ran into the house and grabbed the old shotgun (an ancient Hopkins & Allen single-shot) a handful of shells and took off toward the far end ot the cornfield, loading as I ran.<br>  <br>  About the time I got within range, the crows took off.  I stopped running and threw the shotgun to my shoulder, thumbing back the hammer as the shotgun rose.  I almost made it.<br>  <br>  When the gunstock was an inch or two from my shoulder, the old cannon went off.  It kicked me right square in the mouth.  Recoil pushed the stock back in my slippery hands and the web of my hand hit the barrel latch, opening the breech, which ejected the shell right into my eye.<br>  <br>  I was pretty stunned for a moment.  My eye smarted, my mouth hurt, but the gun was still in my hands, and I was standing upright.  I was never again afraid to shoot the old Hopkins & Allen.  Big Daddy gave it to me when I was about 18, and it is still one of my most prized possessions.<br>  <br>  Start out shooting some birdshot and work up to buckshot.  You didn't start your bike riding on a 26" 12-speed racing bike did you?  Start with #7 or #8 field loads for your first shooting session or three.  Plenty of time to get ready for buckshot before hunting season gets here in the fall.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid.  Hold on tight, and be determined to hold the gun, and keep your feet and you will do fine.<br>  <br>  Doc|`|YrxLbfiIaa	Yes ---- No problem -- Use 2 3/4 inch buckshot and your good to go.... Nothing to be afraid of -- After the first shot you will probably say wow!... that wasnt bad at all.....|`|kQSSz2X2aa	Age is of little importance. What really matters is how much experience you have. At 10 I was fine with 12 gauge slugs, but I had a lot of experience. Height and weight matter a little bit, but not nearly to the extent that most people think. As long as you are not 2 feet tall and dangerously skinny, you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  If you're nervous I would recommend starting out with something small and working your way up to a 12 gauge. Once you start with the 12g. try birdshot first and then buckshot and then slugs. The birdshot has very little recoil.|`|6pUzzsuhaa	you'll be fine<br>  <br>  <br>  if i can shoot it, you can- i'm 5'1 and 120 lbs and i'm 18- so being that your taller and weigh more than i do (NOT a bad thing lol), you'll be fine<br>  <br>  just make sure the gun is fitted for you and make sure that the butt of the gun is held securely to your shoulder|`|dAK8dS4kaa	I think you will be ok, confidence my friend. First time I shot a Springfield SOCOM rifle, I was completely nervous (it was a .308) I was a small skinny kid with little upper body strength, it was front heavy, but I held it as tight as I could to my shoulder and fired, not a problem. Just stay calm and hold it tight, you'll be ok|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Your fine. Are you scared?|`|FhHIAbmLaa	I think you will do fine. <br>  <br>  If recoil is an issue, may I suggest you use Tactical Buck. <br>  <br>  A tactical OO buck, is an 8 pellet shell that flies faster than a 9 pellet due to the reduction in payload, but recoils far less. It also puts out a tight pattern. I regularly make 15 inch patterns at 20 meters through a cylinder bore choke, in a Bennelli M1. A 9 pellet typically spreads 20 to 24 inches at that distance. Each pellet in a Tach load hits harder, and you make more hits on a 10 inch vital at 20 meters.<br>  <br>  I am a police officer, and my department went to Tachtical Buckshot by Federal, as well as Tachtical Slugs from Federal, a few years ago; there is a huge difference. I don't care about the recoil, but the smaller stature officers as well as the small women officers love the change.|`|AA11640949	If you think you can't do something, you'll be right everytime!!<br>  <br>  It'll kick pretty hard and you'll definitely feel it, but you should be fine.  As long as you don't get up there and let your fear get the best of you causing you to not hold it firmly against your shoulder and have a weak grip on it.|`|nooi0ldjaa	as long as your at the butt end of the gun, don't be scared!<br>  its not going to blast you back 10 feet like people well try<br>  and tell you.|`|4AbXxowTaa	You'll be fine.  Just pull it tight into your shoulder.  You should have someone experienced with you to show you the proper form.  I've seen smaller people handle the recoil of a 12 gauge and of a M203 grenade launcher just fine because they held it properly.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	No problem.* You are good to go.* You can always put a limb-saver recoil pad on it from Walmart.* It reduces the recoil by 50%.* It slides on over the butt of your shotgun stock.*|`|FvMtam2Aaa	Buck shot shouldn't make any difference.  You should be fine.  Just keep the shotgun tight to your shoulder.  Have fun!|`|lB6J3qFAaa	Yep!|`|88jK9NbUaa	1. have you shot a 12ga before<br>  2. if you have, then you probably can handle it<br>  3. if you have shot slugs out of  a 12ga, than you can definitely handle it<br>  4. 12ga usually doesnt have a huge amount of recoil unless you are shooting the 3 inch mags loaded with hevi-shot<br>  5. im about your height and weight and dont have any problems with it (of course i am used to rifles like mosin nagants, sks, .243 win., ect.)<br>  i think that you can do it easily, just line your sights up, put it against your shoulder, and pull the trigger! :)|`|lT8MEI6Raa	You'll be fine. I started shooting 12 gauge when I was 14 or 15 and I weighed like 160 and was about 6'1" or 6"2" so I was tall and skrawny.  Remember, the heavier the gun, the less recoil you'll feel.<br>  <br>  Hold the gun tight into your shoulder when you shoot<br>  <br>  Have fun|`|NRqmjiQtaa	I would sugest you start off with a bird shot load and work your way up to the buckshot take your time and get used to the recoil a little at a time and before you know it you will be shooting that 12 gauge with confidence. be safe and enjoy the sport|`|jxXHlwIDaa	buckshot, no way, birdshot yes. I started shooting at 15 with a 12 gauge field(light) gun, have shot buckshot once, never again, unless it was for defense or shooting a deer, it is not something you use at the range|`|5qzndqYQaa	Yes.

N0sbhRu6aa	Yeah you're way too late. I started playing a year ago (im 16) but I have reached a skill level as I have trained for 6 months consecutive. To this day, I have only gone 1 week and a half without playing and that was because of injury.<br>  <br>  I get stomaches when I don't play such as today, but I did train ;)|`|fhHAq6Wmaa	Well, I'm in first year university too! Wahoo....freshmen.<br>  <br>  I actually got scouted for my lacrosse team in the beginning of junior year of high school. Where they kept in contact, until there had to be a sign off, of intention to go to that school.<br>  <br>  My skill probably peaked about U-18s.<br>  Unfortunately, skill is probably mostly programmed into your routines, what to do, when to do, reaction, from a very young age, and you would probably not make it to the big leagues, because of missing this from a higher age. <br>  <br>  This is why camps are directed towards the rep leagues during the young-ins who will have potential. And spring training camps are for the more experienced going into their upcoming seasons.|`|C2hjZyOzaa	its never too late bro<br>  if you have the heart than the rest doesnt matter<br>  just keep trying and prove them wrong

H3nbC71eaa	At this point I say it should be MVP and Shelton. WWE is trying to give MVP a good push now, so him and Shelton would be the better feud and for the US title. <br>  <br>  A feud with Chavo and Shelton would be pointless to me from the standpoint of neither one of them are going to get a push towards a future main eventer. But it seems WWE is trying to push MVP towards the main event level, especially after defeating Chavo and Shelton on his own on SD.|`|hdp7bv45aa	Shelton and MVP|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	I still like the MVP and Shelton feud.

2MjcW24kaa	While tennis rackets have been strictly for both men and women to use, there have been a few companies, most prominantly Head that has released a specific line for women, called the Airflow. The Airflow has a handle on the racket that is specificly shaped for a ladies hand, developed with consultation by Steffi Graff. However, in the realm of normal tennis rackets, usually the heavier a stick is, the more men and less women will use it. I dont really know of any women who use a racket weighted at over 12.3 oz's. So there are really no male/female tennis rackets, barring a few here and there by Head. Tennis rackets are all made to be for both genders to use, however as explained the heavier a racket the more likely for men to use them than women.|`|eY1Vttiyaa	I didn't know there rackets of different gender except for the Wilson W thingy.  I would stick with the multi gender rackets, I am assuming they are better.|`|sptrtwxlaa	There are no such thing as "male or female" tennis racquets so It dosent matter.<br>  However, some companies have created special lines of tennis racquets made for women, such as<br>  Head Airflow & W by Wilson.|`|NDbx9CSvaa	I don't think there's anything about the racquet to qualify it as a male or female racquet except for may be the paint job. A female's racquet might have a pink pain job to it but those types of things happen in the amateur racquets available at places like wal-mart. A guy might hesitate to use a racquet with a pink paint job. The pro's racquet's don't have such distinctions.<br>  <br>  Wozniacki and Nadal use the exact same racquet.|`|lR11ZcfKaa	There is no such thing as male or female tennis racket unless you are 5 and even then it really doesnt matter you go by what feels good to you.|`|oEFjTrLYaa	Really??

Wf83LhUMaa	practice makes repetition. In other words not just the time u spend practicing lacrosse, but the quality of work. Practice a lot but make sure u are doing everything right and it will come.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	Best way to improve your stick skills is to throw against a wall, 10 minutes a day.  25 catch, cradle, throw with your strong hand, 50 with your off hand.  50 catch, switch hands, throw.  25 quick sticks with your strong hand, 50 with your off hand.  25 catch and throw with one hand one you stick strong hand, 50 in the off hand.  <br>  <br>  To work on cradling and switching, keep a ball in your stick as much as you can at practice and at home.  Constantly cradle and switch hands.  The more you do this while you're just standing around, the more natural it will become and the easier it will be in drills and in games.<br>  <br>  If you can catch and throw competently with both hands, you are going to be able to get more out of drills because you'll be able to focus in lacrosse concepts instead of being able to handle the ball.<br>  <br>  Another thing to do is watch as much high level lacrosse as you can.  College games on TV or go to college games.|`|LjqoMHMJaa	Is your last name Bivens. If so you would know me.

nkHWAhvzaa	motel 6|`|tjNLozsIaa	Coho salmon utilize freshwater, nearshore and offshore environments during its lifecycles. Coho salmon spawn in the same environment as chinook salmon; however, coho prefer lower stream velocity, shallower water and smaller gravel. Most coho fry stay in the stream for over a year feeding on aquatic insects, zooplankton and small fish. Adequate stream cover is important to fry survival, as is high dissolved oxygen levels.Mortality is especially high during freshwater lifestages, often a result of poor forest and agricultural management practices that lead to siltation, which may ruin spawning beds or smother the eggs. Migrating coho salmon also face physical obstacles and high water temperatures resulting from dams, inadequate water flows due to diversions for irrigation and impoundment of water for power generation. Once reaching the estuaries, coho salmon fall prey to a number of other species and may be impacted by human changes, such as shoreline development, residential drainage and the filling of marine wetlands. The time spent in this habitat is critical to the development of the species and their ability to survive in the offshore environment.
1aIuAw9Yaa	New York's ODP team or Olympic Development Program is the top level of youth soccer in the state.  Just so you know, because the state is so large, New York is actually broken down into two different associations -- Eastern and Western New York, so there are two ODP teams in NY for each year.  ODP is a "select" program that aims to identify the best youth players in each state, who then can ultimately move on to regional and national team levels.  If you Google US Youth Soccer or Eastern or Western New York State Soccer, you can find out a lot more info about the ODP programs.|`|MxxNjf9Zaa	I don't know but try and research it.|`|AA11473256	never heard of odp and i've lived here for a while and have played soccer for years, upstate new york or nyc?
l0ddfca1aa	It's better than rocky 5 that's for sure, but I think it's a little too depressing until the final scene. they wanted to make it grittier I guess but part of the fun was always those campy montages and villains like Clubber Lang and Ivan Drago or the banter between rocky and the people around him, but rocky is grieving after the death of his wife in this film so he's depressed for most of it. The best part of the film is the final fight scene which is more realistic than the other films. It's a less satisfying version of the original Rocky film, but if you've already watched the rest then you may as well go ahead and watch this final installment.|`|RAnBl0JFaa	I think it is.  Its more like a nostalgic movie.  You would have to see the previous rocky movies to understand some of the flashbacks|`|pR0pJNJkaa	The movie brings great closure to the series and the fighter's career. It's not as realistic as Million Dollar Baby or The Wrestler, but it has it's good qualities. If you have seen all the others it's worth watching. As much as I love Clubber Lang I would rate this one the 3rd best behind the first 2. I hated 5 and expected this one to be worse.|`|NSgSaspAaa	Yes, it is. In my opinion, it's one of the best in the series. I'd put only the original and the 4th one ahead of it.|`|OHVCytOwaa	Yes. Go and watch it.

ZKikquiOaa	Set that as your long term goal.  You need that light at the end of the long tunnel to guide your way.  Then you need to set shorter term goals.  You can't just practice aimlessly, you need to have these goals, meet them and it'll help you stay the course.<br>  <br>  The specifics of how to get to the Olympics, that all depends on the sport.  If you are serious though, the best thing you can do for yourself is to get a good coach.  Finding a good coach that works well with you is half the challenge.  A good coach will set these goals for you.  <br>  <br>  The jist of it is, you need to compete in your sport, win tournaments locally, then state wide, then national and eventually compete internationally.  International competition is not a prerequisite to go to the Olympics, but it'll sure help when you do get there.|`|MxxNjf9Zaa	My personal trainer was supposed to go to the olympics but it was when they didn't allow american athletes to go or something... in the eighties i think.<br>  Anyway just play your game.<br>  I take it one stride at a time.<br>  I play and i get better and i train. It's like how you play, there is no way it just comes naturally.<br>  Can't be explained.|`|nLyvfSDPaa	Oh..<br>  Well you must have been training for manyyyy manyyy years! You dont just decide " im going to the olympics!" you have to be an amazing athlete. But work at it!|`|7AMOuDMraa	the greater effort you put in, the greater the results.
MxxNjf9Zaa	Not going to happen sweety. :-) i'm 12 have a personal trainer, do ODP (Olympic Development Program) club soccer ranked  40  something in the whole USA for our age group, and play for my school. I'm really good and have the potential to play at a division one school when i'm older. For you, you need a trainer, practice, practice, practice, but honestly i don't think it will happen, obviously your not that great if your asking here, i mean sorry if you knew you were great you wouldn't be in this situation.|`|8tmrXmgUaa	im like you i love soccer and started at age 4 well the advice is stay healthy because if u dont managers wont pick u so be fit and just never give up on ur dream same thing for me.so be fit and never give up<br>  =)|`|IVPZkJnvaa	Keep training and don't give up.<br>  Accept criticism and try to improve.<br>  Good Luck!|`|GF4eLhiGaa	Please visit.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvEUGA9lVQeYaXAVklPZ5jPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220194119AA7HyRt">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|kzWYi5OIaa	Just stick with it, practice all the time. Learn new skills, as many as you can. Join a team.|`|5JquTFE9aa	well....................................|`|IjV8hlE0aa	The first thing I see in you is the desire of wanting to always be better at Soccer and that is important.  <br>  I suppose that you train and play well enough this will also help you. with all your determination of achieving your goals i think you are on good path. I recommend you to always keep your body healthy not only on eating properly but not using drugs tabaco and so on... dont let people get you down but also remember that we cannot have everything in life meaning that there may be some goals that may not come true but some will. keep your nice job that i think you are going!!! i love soccer as well i like that girls are into soccer too you are a great example for other girls! luck!|`|GLd6cmlcaa	To make it big in soccer you really have to get contacts. Play for clubs with a good name. Go to tournaments with a lot of scouts. Very few people make it on skill alone. If you really love soccer then just keep playing with a ball. If you really want to take it to that level then you have to get noticed, give people a reason to notice you. You have to seek these opportunities. The best piece of advice that i have ever received came from a coach i met at a camp who was from England. He said, "Football is all about reputation. It's not about what you know, it's about WHO you know." So all i can suggest is to put yourself under a microscope for everyone else. Don't listen to Ali she just is a rich spoiled brat but she has taken some steps that you should consider. Like trying out for ODP that is a good way to get noticed. I personally think ODP is over rated which is why i decided not to play, (I was asked to try out and had a sure spot on the team) but for many people it does help. She may think she's good at twelve but she'll only know how good she is when she's in highschool. Keep playing and keep loving soccer and im sure it will all work out the way you want it to.|`|6REAmVHgaa	practice play with your heart give it your all ...believe not only in yourself but your team as well listen to your coach and always strive for more.

oAjbBLDpaa	Yes, he's playing his heel role very well. He has never shown much charisma before as a face run and his former run as V1 but this heel run really displayed a charismatic side that could really enhance his career. He has the great in ring ability to move up in the WWE.|`|H3nbC71eaa	Yes he does IMO. I wasn't a big fan of him as a heel during his first heel turn...but this time it seems like he's really a bad guy. He's doing great in character, and he just sounds like a total bad guy while he talks. So far he's doing a great job as a heel. Him wearing all black seems to be helping out his heel turn also and the overall image.|`|0fyFxMhOaa	I consider that this angle (Jeff vs Matt) is good... In my opinion Matt is an awful wrestler but he is well positioned in this angle as heel...|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	To me he's always made a better heel than face. As a heel he has real good mic skills, not so much as a face.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	He made an awful babyface, but IMO is a decent heel. Hes not the best heel but hes passable|`|W0rRfLU0aa	well he makes a much better bad guy than good guy. but that aint saying much... if they play the "hardy" card right he could get to main even status before long.|`|gNeFtZdBaa	MATT IS FAT|`|JiCfYfLraa	hell yea he is such a badass i love it lol

XBNZoVnHaa	In EPL promotion means the club played well in the local english  club and  qualify to the FA or carling cup... this rating will  be very helpful for the team play in EPL... they also pay some money to the EPL league... now IPL are following from the EPL policy|`|AA11447659	many teams that come up are relegated after about two seasons, many after their first season. They are given Millions for being in the premiership and there attendances would increase creating further income. Being promoted should be about consolidation and survival. I looked for how much they are actually get and cam up with this. <br>  <br>  Competition at the bottom end<br>  Much is written about the difficulties of ‘bridging the gap’ between the Championship and Premiership for promoted clubs. It is challenging, but certainly not impossible. Portsmouth and West Bromwich Albion have both successfully survived in the Premiership and Bolton Wanderers, Birmingham City, Charlton Athletic and Fulham are now looking beyond survival and, in some cases, to Europe. The significant boost provided by Premiership broadcasting monies and the ability of clubs to convert promotion into higher commercial and matchday revenues provides a revenue boost of upwards of ￡21m to invest in players, infrastructure and ‘gearing up’ to life in the Premiership. Alan Switzer, from the Sports Business Group at Deloitte noted: “The financial boost received by promoted clubs means management’s ability (on and off the field) to adapt and step up quickly, and of course a slice of luck are arguably as, if not more, important than any perceived financial ‘gap’ upon promotion.”|`|Pz45DaOXaa	They are given 40 million by EPL to upgrade there squads which of course is not at all good enough because most of them end up going down<br>  up the sky blues!

EcMDlB3Faa	Don't you just love those back breaking mile runs? ;) Actually, this is a very good question. I know a lot of people that have trouble running mile runs. What I would personally do is actually train for the mile run. You may hear this a lot, but it is something you should listen to. Maybe try running on your olyptical if you have one for about fifteen minutes. If you keep doing that every day, challenge yourself and try to run 30 minutes nonstop. Always make a goal for yourself and try to run a certain distance within a certain ammount of time. First make your goals realistic and you will be able to reach them easier.<br>  <br>  If you don't have an olyptical, maybe try running around in an open space in your house for a while everyday or around your house outside. Always make sure to stretch before and after your jog or run as well. The more flexible and stronger your muscles are, the easier it will be to run and the less tiring it will be. Yoga has many good stretches for your legs, so you could try some of that. <br>  <br>  Here is a tip my gym coach told us, when running, breath in your nose and out your mouth. Breathing through your mouth while running will caus cramps to form and it will be harder for you to run. You could even try running with only breathing through your nose at all times. It works for me and I'm one of the top runners in my entire grade. <br>  <br>  Also, this is a funny tip, but you could try drinking redbull before running. My friend did and she ran faster than usual. I would test this theory first before doing it in a real race or run, just to be safe.<br>  <br>  Well, hope this helps and I hope you achive your goal!|`|BNqbOfBsaa	Your usually not going to feel great after a run! You seem to be doing fine. If you have spare time try to run a little at the park or something and you should do less than 10 minutes easy.|`|CtwEFHcqaa	For god's sake how hard is it to run a 10 minute mile? If you are on a track with 400 meter laps (4 make 1 mile) just take about two minutes for each one and you'll be fine. Just don't walk and you should be able to get in the 8:00 range.|`|QEvQ2eTeaa	Is there a track near your house? Try to run 2-3 days a week minimum starting a month or so before you have to run the mile. On a track, do repeats of the 400-meter run (one lap) with a one-lap recovery between each repeat. Do about four of these. Do this once a week, and run 2-3 miles the other days you run. Every week, also time your mile so you can see how much you need to improve. <br>  <br>  DON'T DRINK RED BULL BEFORE YOU RUN. EVER.|`|e8MeKFcQaa	hey:) i <3 runningg, and my advice to you is to practice practice practice.  Try going farther each time and just TRY YOUR BEST. :) before you run, do good stretchingg, and just think to yourself: you can do it. Eating right that morning and having a healthy diet could also help! Good luck:)<br>  <br>  <3,<br>  Sarah

kiOD8s8Kaa	According to one local kiteboarding school I've looked at, regular skis or a regular snowboard would work.  They teach their winter courses on frozen lakes that are usually snow-covered.  You could probably check with a local kiteboarding school in your area to see what they recommend (and to get lessons, too).|`|UTS7BM89aa	yes you do.

ZGelYopdaa	Lukes Locker!|`|AA10241450	Try www.Holabirdsports.com <br>  <br>  Your teacher is right however most road races are done on the cement roads so it's best to train all surfaces.  Grass and dirt are ideal since you won't pound is much saving your back, knees and joints if your running 1000's of miles a year.  Grass you can generally run around the football field or parks.  Try running on hiking or XC trails.  Good luck!|`|CtwEFHcqaa	First off with all due respect your health teacher is inexperienced to running. Running on the concrete is not the worst thing you can do, it's good for you. Running on grass sucks. There are random mud puddles, it's hard to get going fast because it's so thick, and it will wear you out fast. On the other hand if you go from running from grass to concrete you will find it much easier, but also harder on your knees. You should start training on either cement or trails. Trails are the best of all(just make sure you don't get lost). Just go on a good trail, they're the best paths of all. If you are in high school I recommend joining the Cross Country or Track team, especially if you are near Loyola they are defending state champs. Also people tell you that you will need good shows so you won't screw yourself up blah blah blah. I don't believe in this, I just buy any shoes that are the cheapest and I've never had an injury(running for about a year now).  I think (especially if you are in high school on CC or track) that you need two pairs of running shoes, 1 pair of training shoes(they should weight a pretty good amount) and a pair of race shoes that are very light(for races like 5k, 8k, etc.). If you are not into this kind of stuff and you just want to buy your damn shoes that are fitted for you you can go to a "Snail's Pace" stores. Good luck to you and your running career =)|`|LgNqYUECaa	The nikestore online they selling amazing running shoes try it.<br>  <br>  www.Nikestore.com|`|7mKNHl2zaa	***** sporting goods will work, and if you say that you go to chapparla high school you will get 10% off|`|OHs8yJiOaa	You can go to maps.google.com and search for "Los Angeles running stores" and it should show you everything in your area.<br>  <br>  You could also go to the California board at forums.runnersworld.com and ask what people there would recommend in your area.<br>  <br>  There are some RoadRunner Sports stores in the L.A. area, and they're known for doing a good job with assessing your pronation, arch type, etc. (roadrunnersports.com), but almost any running specialty store should be able to help you. You mainly want to avoid the big chain stores like Big 5 or Sports Authority for getting fitted since they're not running specialists.<br>  <br>  Concrete is usually the hardest possible surface you can run on, and most would recommend at least trying to find a paved road somewhere (which is exactly what you'll be on anyway if you ever do road racing). Others believe the body more-or-less does just fine adapting to concrete over time, especially if you're wearing acceptably cushioned shoes. If you ever get lower leg aches and pains, however, you might want to get off the concrete, since some attribute stress fractures and other injuries to it. It can be a balancing act between the risks of concrete and the risks of cars, etc. on a road somewhere, and/or the difficulty finding good stretches of cut grass. If you ever do speed work, you may at least want to find concrete alternatives for that.|`|8NjB1suFaa	i suggest big 5 sporting goods or chicks since they are having major sales right now

tPFikOY7aa	I've always believed if you can play one good game then the skill is there. Your issue is mental and the fear of playing poorly. Have you heard the saying you dont score if you don't shoot? Well it means take risks. Even when you feel your confidence is down look to play a good through ball or cross. Sure you may not always hit it well but your team has no hope of scoring unless players are adventerous and try to set something up. Look at the Pros. Many games may only have 1 goal in them. Some players may put in 10 crosses a game and only one is good, but at the end of the day that one may be all that matters. Fortune favours the brave. Just go out there and have fun and your performance should follow your feelings.|`|IjV8hlE0aa	I understand how you feel exactly I happened on Thursday in league play against a team that did not seem to cost more challenging but we beat them (7-5) and i didnt play that good as always. i had so many raged after the game that well.. believe me it took hours to pass away. well that this happens the first league game for me was great i scored 2 goals. well the point is like on my case i have good and bad games thats totally normal! even to pro players. try to train like always looking at your weak spots for improving. remember that is a team game so dont blame yourself so hard!! ( i have to improve on that too lolz) chill girl luck go on!!! =)|`|2Ix8Q9F4aa	well i play soccer to and for me if i was put in last the n i would practice show him or her what i got and m ake the boys look bad and dont feel bad its just a game if it doesnt work out then go to your other hobbies !!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|W7UpXXQGaa	ha ha i played soccer for about they same time, i was on a team that lost 9 to 0 almost every game, but we never complained because it would only bring us down!!!! but guess what the next year i was on the same team with the same people and we got seconed in state no lie ha ha it was awsome. so the real question is do you have fun? i know how it feels to feel like your the one messing up, but its probably all in your head!!! soccer is a team sport, so you cant blame one person for doing bad because it all of your job as a team to have each others back and to just do your best but most of all if your having fun and you love the sport i suggest to continue to play!!!|`|svU3xeotaa	yes you will just keep believing in your self and always stay confident no matter what the world tells ya!

Y4mz8BShaa	The "Beta Spetsnaz" is pointless. You don't put a carbine upper receiver on a gun to reduce the size when you can have a folding.retractable stock. That's just stupid, and a great way to needlessly destroy accuracy. If you want a budget AK, go with a CYMA. They have the best on the market.<br>  <br>  JLS makes LPEG's and low quality MPEG's. I'd recommend staying away form them, and far, far away from Airsplat. You really can't get worse than them unless you're Hobbytron.<br>  <br>  The JG G36C is a great quality MPEG. Good stock accuracy, even for it being a sub carbine (for target practice, you don't want a sub carbine...), light weight, small frame (not necessarily a good thing), and the internals are great for an MPEG. The best on you're looking at. I'd recommend you get the Echo 1 version, though, as it has metal bushings pre installed.

sptrtwxlaa	whoa if you're a 4.0 then why are you using a 9.6 OZ RACQUET WITH AN OVERSIZE OF one hundred THRTEEN square inches??!!!<br>  U need to upgrade to a racquet that suits your level such as:<br>  <br>  Wilson npro surge<br>  Dunlop Aerogel 300<br>  Prince OZONE 7<br>  Head Flexpoint Prestige TEAM<br>  <br>  these raquets are aroung 110z, 100 in. headsize, <br>  low-medium power, moderate-fast swing speed, which you need to get more pace on the ball.|`|dbdKFCELaa	try using a heavier racket to increase speed. <br>  Also its about timing so make sure you work on that, <br>  Hitting it hard is also about having fast racket head speed(how quickly you swing the racket) <br>  <br>  hope this helps, good luck!|`|wx2UfKOdaa	it simple... and the rule is same for any sports... its not about strength....its all about timing.....look at federer or murray... they hardly have any muscles but the ball just zips around.... right|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	i think u will be on your way very soon..<br>  all will work well|`|rrfJ5QW8aa	1st im sorry bro but you aint a 4.0 buddy. If you arent getting enough power, Prince is coming out with a new power racquet in their EXO series that should provide players with a harder ball. If you are strong enough that consider downsizing your power level to a 900-950|`|IF1SLaiRaa	I would say try a new racquet. Your current racquet is light weight with a large headsize which is probably what prevents you from getting swift swings. A racquet to demo would be a Head PRestige Pro, and i believe it would help you speed up those groundstrokes.|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	Ok well for one thing, it doesnt matter how strong you are, pace of the ball is determined on how fast you swing. Strength and how fast your muscles expand and contract are totally different. You might want to research isometric training for this, also try swinging a much heavier racquet (or something a lot heavier) everytime before you play, that will allow you to swing fast.<br>  <br>  Also, try using wrist, you might want to try the roger federer inside out forehand, or a more topspin wrist action forehand.<br>  <br>  It could be the racquet, but thats weird if the power level is medium-high. You have a pretty old racquet, so i would invest in a newer model. And if you really want power, go for the k-factor k-six one x, one of the most powerful racquets out in the marquet.|`|Oe5BCMzKaa	swing harder, if you can. Also, experiment hitting the ball a bit earlier or a bit later- sometimes when i'm not timing the ball, i concentrate on waiting for the ball. Also, you could try use the nadal forehand. (its my favourite shot, from anywhere on the court)

FGZR9RwDaa	it depends on how much you practice. if you do lots and lots of volleyball, it could take not that long.(if you are naturally good)|`|BLTo4xL9aa	you need to be practice everday..............|`|WazggkI1aa	It largely depends on how committed you are and if you take it seriously. Practice is vital. Also important is your physical fitness. If you stay focused you can get good in no time. I had never played volleyball until freshman year, but I tried out anyway. My first year was on B team learning the basics, but over summer and in the postseason I practiced frequently and by sophomore year I was starting on varsity, and junior and senior year I was captain.|`|DFUN42S9aa	well you just don't get good over night.

You have to have a lot of control to be able to do it well. Your friend will get alright in about six months but it will take very hard work and dedication to get good. One thing that helps with volleyball is if you are physically fit. If your friend is healthy and can move quickly and is strong she'll do fine. <br>  If you have anymore questions feel free to ask me.|`|9WJ1mYkwaa	It took me about 4 years of consistent practice and conditioning, but boy, did it really pay off! I suggest that she practice everyday and do conditioning ALOT! Most of all, she has to WANT to be good.

You have to be motivated to be a good player. :)|`|JQ7fPJN7aa	it honestly took me 2 years.<br>  you need flexibility in your legs, leg and arm strength, and core strength.<br>  serving takes awhile to get a hang of.<br>  and not a whole lot of people can set well.<br>  it take time, patience, and hard work.|`|sv61jElPaa	theres no set time its just how hard you work and the amount of practice you get. tell her to find a good coach and to play alot if she wants to improve|`|cb3295141eac7a7e5ee98bb463df80bcaa	well i started playing last summer and diddnt brcome good untill about october
ye5O1iFzaa	Usually when a suit covers more skin it makes you faster. If you look at the olympics they don't wear speedos in meets. My suggestion would be that if you are very fast and plan to go to big meets then get a leg skin like this: <a href="http://www.swimoutlet.com/product_p/7133.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.swimoutlet.com/product_p/7133...</a> or just wear whatever makes you feel more comfortable and confident.|`|t0PzSCs0aa	i cant answer from personal experience but some of the guys on my team have mentioned that speedos are indeed faster, but maybe that was just their excuse.|`|WATmnHwVaa	Depends what you swim,<br>  in Highschool people who swim free and back are supposed to wear a speedo, but you're actually supposed to swim it with a full body suit (without the arms)<br>  <br>  With Breast and butterfly you would want to wear a jammer....<br>  <br>  However, i've always gone with the philosphy of the more the suit is covering the faster you go, except don't get full body suits because when you pull back your arm and go forward with it (like in freestyle) some water can get trapped inbetween your shoulder and the suit causing more drag.
8bTder08aa	John Shirreffs hasn't specified when she'll make her 2009 debut.  Zenyatta is just taking things easy, hasn't returned to the work tabs yet.  <a href="http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/49245/zenyatta-to-return-to-work" rel="nofollow">http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/a...</a><br>  <br>  I don't think Shirreffs is in any hurry to return her to heavy training.  If he's seriously plotting a run for Horse of the Year, he knows that that title is won in the fall, not in the spring.  I would expect to see her at Saratoga for sure, but he may not have firmed up a campaign for her before that.  <br>  <br>  If they're going to run Zenyatta against males, I would think they would do it in some of the weight-for-age races in the fall, leading up to the Breeder's cup.

pqDiBj5Laa	you have to PLAY and enjoy it . One of the best way to get skills is doing not formal playing: You and at least 3 of your friends play  in just one narrow goal ( 10 feet wide )  every one against every one, the one who scores goes to make goal-saving and so on. Its not formal, its just for fun, but it makes good for getting skills. There are other kind of non-formal ways to play, you can invent a different way too.|`|jBJt46KVaa	plastic surgery =P|`|fhHAq6Wmaa	don't grunt when you run. like you look constipated.<br>  don't run with your mouth open.<br>  stay calm|`|yAvh8wjFaa	Talk to your coach and let him/her know that your ready to have a bigger role on the team and mention that you like being aggressive and hunting after the ball.

oqQjnpfGaa	Yeah, you gave up a little bit too much. <br>  <br>  Shaq will be a monster now that Amare is out for the season. <br>  Bibby is  a great guard this season.<br>  DJ and Jamal could be hot at times. <br>  <br>  Since you already made the trade, <br>  Lets see...wade is a great player....while Haslem and Felton are going to be inconsistent....good luck with the rest of the season! :)|`|c9PHwfVMaa	Im guessing you did this deal because of Wade. You gave up too much just to acquire Wade. Shaq is a beast inside the paint and with Amare out, he will handle the majority of inside scoring, especially because the Suns are playing small. Bibby can easily rack up assists if he chose too because of the dynamic players on the Hawks like Johnson and Smith. Augustin is better than Felton in my opinion; if he gets more playing time he could exceed Raymond. Jamal Crawford himself is a great guard but because of all the high scorers in GS, he hasn't been scoring that much. He's still a valuable combo guard though. You should've just dealt three players for Wade + Felton, that would've been fairer...slightly.|`|REa2QBPHaa	hmmmmm bibby has been dropping 4 straight games with more than 25 points and Shaq is a monster w/o amare
Zp65xPQyaa	You can't really put a time on QB's mastering the game. There are too many different systems and each QB generally has a system that fits him best. There are a few guys that could play any system (Peyton Manning would be a great example) and these guys will generally take 2 or 3 years. Apart from that it really just depends on how a guy fits the particular system he is in. You have guys that don't ever master the current system they have but when they switch teams and systems they suddenly seem to get it or vice versa (Drew Bledsoe didn't really work that well for the Cowboys after he had gotten the patriots to the super bowl)|`|9f2391ebf6a1c505bb9421899963d771aa	It depends on your skill set and how it fits in that offense. For example, Kurt Warner in the St. Louis and Arizona offense was a good fit for his skillset. However, when you look at a guy like Michael Vick in the west coast offense, he never really "mastered" the position.|`|UDmVXRhTaa	It veries because it took Brett Farve about 4-5 years and it will porbably only take Matt ryan 2-3, if only he hasn't mastered it yet.  But for the less fortunate like Ryan Leaf (biggest draft bust in NFL History) and ALex Smith (your wondering who's Alex Smith? First round 1st pick of 05 season, don't c him much do yah? lol)  Tips for praticing alone is I know sounds old school but throwing threw a tire because it moves and u have to be persice to get it through the hole.  Other ways u could get better is practice your follow trhoughs and try out different ways of throwing the ball, for example holding ball different or "flicking" the ball off differnt and find which is best for you! Hope this helps!!!

lSopAdVAaa	Yes, only on special teams, or if the out of bounds player is the first to touch the ball. It's so you can't run down the sideline and duck out of bounds, thus losing defenders/ blockers, and then jump back in and make a catch/ tackle. But on a play like that it doesn't matter.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	yes i heard someone explain that yesterday, it was not a foul|`|UxooffHZaa	Either way, it was a TD.|`|qsK7YNhDaa	yea|`|JKQKG3tQaa	You can't but im sure the Cardinals would rather take a penalty than a TD.|`|SEcM9EDZaa	Did anyone notice that a Cardinal player was blocked in the back around the Arizona 30?

e0957cd4945ef9a81d45c793833468e0aa	Season 1923-24 began with Dundee Hibernian but ended with the Club playing under the new name of Dundee United. At the start of that season, the Directors also decided on a change of colours to black and white. These changes took place in an attempt to give the Club a wider appeal. Initially the preferred new name was Dundee City but local rivals Dundee FC strongly objected to this. After several weeks of discussion, agreement on the name Dundee United was reached and then approved by the football authorities. As Dundee United, the first match played was against Dumbarton on 27th October 1923.|`|2dLf3KHnaa	not that i know uve gt 2 teams from dundee tho|`|35b87fceeaf43fa20d38991c7cd6a746aa	Yes they did, they changed their name in 1923/24 and I think it was to give the club a wider appeal in Dundee|`|mSZoMKD6aa	Seems like a Question for Falgee that one|`|c75d7684a8af4dc243578c5ed81236b8aa	Yes and another little known fact was that Dundee Hibernian were one of only two clubs in Scotland who operated a sectarian signing policy, they would only sign Roman Catholics. This ended when they became Dundee United which is maybe a clue as to why they changed in the first place. Rangers on the other hand took much longer to address their sectarian problems.   Imagine The Arabs being the ones who paved the way for the abolition of sectarianism in Scottish Football with their bold and impressive move in 1924.

rW4bt6ZAaa	Was it a turn over? Possibly.    Should it have been reviewed? Absolutely.    Another miss by the refs. Something about the Steelers in the superbowl brings out the worst in refs it seems.    GaryE, quit being a dumb ***.|`|JH9IMMDtaa	your totally right... his arm was going forward!!! they didn't even review it, those idiots!! IT'S THE SUPER BOWL!!! It could have cost them the game, if they could have scored!!! witch now we will never know!|`|C290wQWGaa	No he slap the ball forward thumb downs or not that ball was loose!|`|WJ7pRtD3aa	I live in MO I'm a huge Cards fan, and been a Warner fan since his days as a Ram.. he's still the only one to bring us a title..     but it was a fumble.. the thing that p*sses me off is the crappy holding calls on the Cards.. let em play.. if the Steelers hold let em play..     but all in all 2 things caused the loss, not throwing down field in the first half, and obviously the D not getting a stop on the Steelers last drive.. they had their shots to win.|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	Clearly, 100%, no doubt in my mind, it was a fumble.    The QB's arm was stationary when he was hit.  The hit dislodged the ball.  Then the QB's arm started forward with the ball coming out.  This did propel the ball forward, but to be considered a forward pass the QB must have the ball firmly in his grasp.  Therefore there was no doubt that it was a fumble.  Check the similar play that was initially ruled a fumble but overturned and compare the two.  The referee's explanation of the rule is excellent.    There is a real NFL official in the replay booth who did review the play (and all plays in the last 2 minutes of each half) and found no reason that it may possibly be overturned, thus he did not signal the on field officials that there should be a review.|`|42f3d6d73c3972f622efbb1789221c0baa	Either way the game is over. Life goes on.|`|3QuZeCB4aa	Fumble.  By the way STEELERS SUCK!|`|NzGZbCRQaa	What are you talking about?!?!?    The fumble was reviewed during the commercial break and easily determined to be a fumble.|`|ufc0Ne5Aaa	no|`|a6EndAPiaa	No the last play was in no way shape or form a turnover.  I mean how could it have been?    Big Ben took the snap and then knelled down.    What are you talking about?      --- Edit  How am I a dumb a** the last play of the game was Big Ben's kneel down.  If you think otherwise then you are the dumb a**.    As for the second to last play of the game it was a fumble.    Empty hand moving forward = fumble 100% of the time.  You could review that play for the next decade and it would still be a fumble.  The replay official realized that and therefore did not call for an official review.|`|96b8aafea17899cd549fb0c224691b9faa	That was without a doubt a fumble. Yes his arm pushed the ball forward but the rule clearly states that the QB MUST HAVE POSSESSION of the ball, with his arm moving in a throwing motion.    Its a fumble, end of story...end of game...end of season.|`|AA10404097	I am a huge Steelers fan but I still think that play should have been reviewed. I think in the Superbowl of all places if there is any doubt there should be a review. Even better would be the league getting rid of the tuck rule completely. If it is in the QB's hand and comes out it is a fumble. Hell that is true for any other player on the team. I understand that they are trying to protect that hugely expensive arm but it is still a bad rule.|`|zii6IWHoaa	As someone who was pulling for the Cards, I don't think the Cards last play would have been overturned but if you have instant replay, Is that not the perfect time for it?    A close call that will possibly decide who wins the Super Bowl?    The replay official can not decide if it was a fumble or not. His job is that if it a close or questionable call, to call for a review|`|Awfv7TV3aa	the call on the field was a fumble, they reviewed it, and it stood. I wish they took a little longer in making the decision so all these crybabies would shut the hell up. his arm was going forward but he didnt have control of the ball. the Steelers won because Roethlisberger couldnt be stopped, not because of the refs, end of story let's move on|`|sPiwb8Hraa	No. This question has been posted 50 or 60 times now. He was clearly not in the process of throwing a forward pass, and the play was reviewed.
DPlJiWyWaa	Just go nude I guess...<br>  <br>  Sure Bevo and the rest of us won't mind ;)|`|IoCK2bEnaa	To be honest, being a center requires probably the least athleticism of any position except maybe some of the special teams players.

I've seen it happen many times and usually fumbles are a result which can lead to costly turn overs.|`|KNTofuxMaa	Remember that the position is about giving and not receiving even though the stance you are in would suggest otherwise.

gz2M5hsBaa	Potchefstroom is one of the worst grounds in the world you can bowl on. It pretty much provides no help to the bowlers.

The fourth choice pacer, Hilfenhaus, bowled better than the rest. <br>  The SA Board President's XI comprises mainly of players of 3 teams which failed to make the cut in the Standard Bank Pro20, and hence many of the good players are not a part of the team. If Australia fails to make an impact in a match against probably a third string SA side, than will have grave consequences. But we'll have to wait till Australia starts their innings and see how they go about with it.

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	The entrances and pyro were for US, those watching on TV.  Thanks to Vince McMahon ALL wrestlers have to have big entrances now, even for run-ins.<br>  <br>  The fight was supposed to be just two guys beating on each other to get their anger toward each other out.  It wasn't about a "winner" and a "loser".<br>  <br>  The rest of the MEM let them beat on each other a while then interfered to keep Sting from killing Angle.  There was no conclusion to the fight because it's purpose was to build some hype for a PPV TNA title-showdown between these two, and to keep us wondering and speculating, is this the end of the MEM?  Who will Nash and the rest side with?  The winner will be the leader of the MEM and TNA Champ, but what will happen to the loser?<br>  <br>  The fight (not wrestling match) served it's purpose (to create hype for a PPV showdown) and Sting and Angle did a good job.  That wasn't really Sting's kind of match but he did well enough, and both took some bumps, especially Angle falling from so high (I'm really surprised he didn't blow out his knees).<br>  <br>  I don't know that we'll get that one-on-one match with no interference, but if it does happen it will be on PPV, probably in a cage.  Hmm, Lockdown IS coming in April...|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	No, it was lame. They still have Angle's pyro with no fans in the arena.<br>  <br>  I thought the arena was supposed to be empty.

k8YSuKGpaa	They are building him back up again as the Samoan Bulldozer. So they have him fight all of these weak people to help build his image back up. Eventually he will cross paths with someone who could actually stand up to Umaga, and that would then make Umaga's opponent more popular.|`|16oCO510aa	WWE wants to rebuild Umaga as a very dominate worker on SmackDown, they are letting him squash people to build him back up.|`|85ecad91da4761d50060ea7e04b61701aa	To Make Umaga Look good ofcourse|`|GJ9z6K1Baa	calm down..they are warm uppers lol...thats to get rid of ring rust|`|b7JS16dyaa	It's because WWE doesn't realise that nobody really cares about squash matches anymore. It made guys look good in the old days, but people just get bored with it now. It didn't work much for Vladimir Koslov, Big Daddy V, Mark Henry, Snitsky, Big Show, the various new guys on ECW, etc. More likely, they're just waiting until Wrestlemania 25 is over before putting Umaga in a decent feud.|`|3k4tPNTGaa	Because umaga has just cm bk from injury and they want to show people dt umaga is still vicious like before, moreover wrestlemania is coming so everyone is involved in a storyline but umaga have to wait.|`|O3uNFFisaa	I agree its just to make him look good, he was never that great as Jamal but as Umaga he is supose to look good.|`|m6oc91sxaa	Because WWE doesn't have much of a roster now-a-days....which is why people like Randy Orton are feuding with the likes of Shane McMahon...|`|tl1HTJRwaa	I think there are two reasons for that...

j18XTAfqaa	You may think of this answer as bias but its up to you.    Yes. Kobe did send a message to the league and all of the Laker doubters by scoring 61 points.    Everybody knows that Kobe is capable of scoring 50s on any given night but this is slightly more significant considering the loss of Laker Center Andrew Bynum on the last game they played. Kobe may have sent the message...I am the best player in basketball and I can still carry this team on my back.    Without a doubt, everyone in the LAL organization would love to have Bynum back bec it would make everyones life esp Pau Gasol easier. Alot easier but this just means that the rest of the players would have to step their games up.    The Lakers, though bruised is not broken and is still a force to be reckoned with. Bynum should be back by April and would prolly be there for the second half, if not the first half of the playoffs.    A redeemed team is better than the Dream Team.    Kobe will make MVP again this year. Watch.|`|AukGqk17aa	YES he has a great team    C:bynum (injuried)    PF:pau gasol    SF:odom/ariza    SG:bryant    PG:fisher/farmar|`|xt00f5Qoaa	It is going to be hard to bet who the east send over. Magic Celtics or Cavs. They are all really good and have a great chance but i don't think Lakers will|`|AvxMhVGmaa	If he can't win it with the team he has now, he will never win. Honestly, I don't think the Lakers will win it all this year.|`|pgVxoM5xaa	Depends. They CAN, but they will have to play much better defense. That's why Boston beat them last year, and why I think Cleveland is the front-runner this year.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	of course, it would be easier against a cavs team, only bc their center plays european ball. he is not the physical bang bang type of center that orlando or boston have.|`|LXsxmp3Faa	i think kobe will win a championship, but he shouldn't be that proud about it because he's a ball hog, self centered, and is only in it for the fame and to keep trying to break MJ's record. he already admitted that he's not mj, but constantly he keeps trying. last time i checked there's no i in team.|`|i5MInqeMaa	You never know.  Nobody really saw the Lakers losing bynum like this.  Orlando just lost Jameer nelson with a dislocated shoulder.  Injuries to other teams could level the playing field.  Lakers can make it to the finals it just won't be as easy with the team they have now.  Bynum just makes them unbeatable.|`|3teWTOPqaa	We are more than capable of going back to the Finals, but someone will have to step up this time.|`|Mi3rHjcYaa	this must be a Rhetorical queston, of course he will. He'll win it this year and next year for sure.|`|98wFqBwSaa	Nope|`|PMPUQvUZaa	NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|3jBUJxOdaa	Yes    Lakers are still the best out west even without Bynum. And Lakers are capable of beating any of the 3 teams out there in the east, however, that will be a very difficult task|`|rEafx4QTaa	if he could ever get andrew bynum to play with him in the finals, which mite not be this year either, than yes|`|vJyF8siJaa	Lakers are playing with Gasol in full season now and Bynum will be back before the playoffs. Lakers will be 100% by that time and going to make a run at the title!
gBO908P6aa	No contest and then what?  Rematch?  Ok sure.  I still see GSP winning.  He's tasted BJ's blood twice already.  You think he'll go easy and crumble apart the third time?  No sir.  He'll be even MORE determined to silence the naysayers and prove that his skills weren't attributed to a jar of petroleum jelly.|`|5673ef8ed5e8008f074e69bcf4c7d2b9aa	He keeps pullin' this crap.|`|PgFYPZg2aa	The corner man needs to be fired, if that fight had been remotely close this would be a huge black eye on the sport.  I don't think you can dispute the outcome over this incident, however I think they should give Penn a decision to rematch in short time, but I think its safe to say he'd say hell no.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	i dont think there is any rule against what he did. if there is no rule then there cant be any penalties  if there isnt they should fix it|`|6a3172c489600c432a5b3ecd4bc4bb96aa	A NSAC Official intervened in the fight, he saw it and they removed it immediately. That was between round 1 and 2, which didn't help BJ in the stomping he took in round 3.    That is probably the most of it other than a fine or sanction against GSP's cornerman.    I don't see it getting anymore headway, just a random incident.|`|FKhY6EVAaa	I hope so but they most likely will fire the guy who did it, and leave GSP alone|`|sXMrY3uwaa	It should be.|`|c8DyCBTxaa	If St Pierre did grease then that explains why BJ couldnt do anything in the clinch!  I have never seen BJ look that bad!  Ever!  He has given everyone he has fought a tough match, so if he said something was wrong, then maybe something was wrong.  Im a big St Pierre fan and he is on my "Myspace" from years ago.  His first fight with BJ could have gone either way seriously.|`|FpJ2qvrCaa	to be perfectly honest the comission jumped in after the 1st round and wiped down GSP's back, go back and watch the replay, if the comission was unhappy with the so called grease on GSP's back they could have called time and wiped his so called greasy back down, the fact is they saw nothing wrong with it after the initial rub down between the 1st and second round, man I swear Penn fans are as bad as Laker and Patriots fans when their boys lose. Penn didnt train hard and got gassed by the bigger man who took his training seriously.|`|8ce8b4b38942d55b123ccbbd80d86651aa	GPS is better conditioned.. it had nothing to do with the vaseline.... BJ needs to quit slacking and finding excuses... and get back to the gym.|`|BRX0bmtRaa	totally agree with ka fo sho ..just watch ufc primetime and watch bjs trianing...nothing compared to gsp's...bj is now jus a typical fat hawaiian|`|clInlnIqaa	NSAC rules state that no excesive amounts of vaseline or grease can be used on a fighters face or body. No where does it say that vaseline can not be used on the body. The rule is not specific enough, and because of that it should warrant no action.

4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	One of my first childhood memories is of Ray taping a picture of his son to his ankle during the Olympics.  I was pretty close to Ray's son's age, so I instantly became a Leonard fan.<br>  <br>  The primed Ray Leonard really was something to behold, and you first see the effects of aging in his fight with Lalonde as his combinations seem to have just the slightest hitch in them.  Of course, those combos are still better than just about any of today's fighters, but I could tell that he wasn't the same Ray he was as a welter in his 20's.|`|AA12325046	Heck I'm old enough to remember a young Ali so yes I remember Leonard as a young man and watching him in the Olympics and I though he was going to be a special fighter with his charisma and of course his boxing ability and speed.  His fight with Hearns (the first one) was a classic as he was behind with an eye almost shut, and showed a champions heart by coming back to win,  Tremendous fighter,|`|VuJsQwz5aa	At his time, boxing had just witnessed the professional demise of Muhammad Ali. Sugar Ray Leonard was the most exciting figure in a sport that seemed like it would never be the same without The Greatest. My father never cared for him because he dared to go by the name of the man who was probably THE greatest fighter of all, Sugar Ray Robinson. At times, I was annoyed by his Ali-like clowning in the ring, but I always cheered for him.<br>  <br>  Like many other great fighters, Leonard stayed at the dance a little too late, and his last fights were disappointing.|`|Yg1QR4mmaa	I wasn't even born when he was fighting, except for his fight with Camacho in 1997, but I wish I was around when boxing was at the prominence it was at that time, there were so many great fighters at that time and I would really like to see the perspective he was looked at then and compare it to now. Fighters like him are mythologized nowadays and I would like to see him when he was considered just a fighter, not a great fighter of the past.|`|87e42b12d9375f23a7f6007b19387ae4aa	one of the greatest fighters of all time. sucks everytime i think of him all i can think is marvin hagler was cheated in their 87 title fight which of course isnt leonards fault although leonard claims he won the fight to this day. maybe its just to me, but that controversy cast a huge shadow of leonards career, and i think we may be speaking of hagler or hearns a little more even that fight had gone a different direction.|`|biKMQ2I1aa	I remember watching him fight with my dad. It was one thing we both loved to watch|`|MgVKy8CUaa	Awesome question.  I remember watching the first Leonard - Duran, Brawl in Montreal, fight like it was yesterday.  I was 12 and I know exactly where I was and watching it.  <br>  <br>  Same with the "no mas" fight. In my mind it's like they went down last week.  I even remember the Leonard - Floyd Mayweather fight, too.  Leonard's flurries were so quick, but he had big time pop when he threw the right hand.  <br>  <br>  The thing about Leonard is that you knew he could be beat but he had to work so hard for his wins.  I agree about the Hagler fight.  Everyone expected Marvin to kill him but Leonard threw him off his game completely.  Hagler lost the fight in the early rounds just because he didn't know what to do.<br>  <br>  The cool thing about that era was that you knew Leonard, Hearns, and Hagler would eventually collide.  It didn't always seen like it, but you knew it deep down.  The demand for those fights was incredible.  It was really exciting.|`|74d926bbb467954124e827daf8495652aa	I still wonder what fight people were watching who think Marvin Hagler won the Leonard fight.  Ray outlanded him, had better defense more ring generalship, etc. Anyway.....I remember watching Ray take apart Tommy Hearns with those brutal combinations and beating other fighters the same way. He was a special fighter.  Yes he stuck around too long but he gave us many exciting memories.  The Benitez fight in 79, Kalule in 81, Hearns also in 81, LaLonde in 88, Hagler in 87 and the Duran fights (expecially No Mas).  Not to mention the Olympic wins. Great great fighter. My favorite however might be when he beat up Danny Bonaduce on youtube LOL. Check it out.|`|pR0pJNJkaa	I was born in 71, so the 2 biggest things in boxing, which my dad loved, was Ali and Leonard. I remember Leonard/Duran, Leonard/ Bernitez. I rememer watching Leonard train in Syracuse, NY for a fight in person. I remember his commercials. I remember being in a school yard fight and shuffling my feet, winding up my left and punching with the right...lol (it's amazing I got that one off). He was one of the greats and he transcended boxing for me. Tyson was the last fighter to do that in my mind.|`|9Epj7MIWaa	YOU HAVE A GREAT POINT BUT HE WAS THE GREATEST OF HIS TIME, NOW THE HEARNS 2 FIGHT IF YOU LOOK AT IT, HEARNS HAD SOME NICE COMBOS TRUE BUT HE NEVER HAD LEONARD REALLY HURT EVEN ON THE FLASH KNOCK DOWNS. NOW ON THE OTHER HAND LEONARD HAD HIM AGAINST THE ROPES AND HURT PLENTY OF TIMES WHER THEY WERE ACTUALLY GONNA STOP THE FIGHT AND ONE ROUND HE GOT A 10-8 WHICH MADE IT A DRAW

H3nbC71eaa	Once you grow up and have kids and your own family, it becomes real rough. Me personally I don't think I would be able to handle being away all that time...especially if I had a wife and kids. That's one of the things that wrestlers have it rough with, since they're on the road almost the whole year, I can't imagine what it's like not seeing your family all that time. Have to respect the wrestlers for having to deal with that, that's tough.|`|9f2391ebf6a1c505bb9421899963d771aa	It is the same as being a truck driver or in military.|`|uuHDQr1paa	Yes...I just couldn't handle big, smelly, hairy men in underwear grabbing me.

OAEuYZkZaa	It depends on the situation.<br>  <br>  If he's just robbing the till, I'll watch and give the cops a good description.<br>  <br>  He he's just taking money, I'll let him have it.  I don't carry enough money to be worth dying to defend.<br>  <br>  But, if he's having people lie down on the floor, or herding people into a back room, or physically searching people, he's a dead man.  All to often having customers lie on the floor or herding them into a back room is the first step toward eliminating witnesses.  I will give up my money, but not my ID, not my weapon. and not my life without a fight.<br>  <br>  One more thing.  If I decide to shoot, I will give no warning.  He has a weapon pointed at innocent people.  He has displayed his willingness to take an innocent life.  If I decide to shoot, I'd shoot him down like a rabid dog, as quickly as possible and with no warning.<br>  <br>  Doc|`|Z8UV6S3baa	Well, as stated it is hard to say what you would do when actually in the situation, however, what I train for is almost exactly what Doc has described.<br>  <br>  1) He's essentially defined rules of engagement as: robbing store, even me is acceptable, risk to life and limb is unacceptable.<br>  <br>  2) He essentially has defined criteria that crosses the line: putting people on the floor, herding them into a central location.<br>  <br>  3) He's basically defined that once the criteria for crossing the line has been crossed, he'll put the assailant down. - No warning to allow the assailant the opportunity to create a hostage situation or get into a gun fight.<br>  <br>  That pretty much meets the law in almost any locale that allows carry. The law basically allows for you to act to protect life and limb of you or anyone else. I think in fact that the restrictions on police in the circumstance is significantly different that the restrictions on civilians in the situation.<br>  <br>  The only distinction I have from Doc? At least sitting at my computer, my inclination would be to set my criteria for action at the point where I or anyone else is threatened by a person with a firearm in the commission of a crime. I've spent alot of time at the range and I've seen too many situations where people are excited and pull the trigger when they think they are holding on the target, or accidently or whatever. If the person is robbing a convenience store it's unlikely they are the picture of calm and control to let me trust that they are skilled at handling a firearm and will avoid accidentally shooting me. <br>  <br>  Now, I happen to know that under range circumstances my time from draw to first shot is a bit under 2 seconds. Which in some cases is an eternity. So, I'm not going to be foolish about it and would try and wait for an opportunity where the assailant would be distracted. <br>  <br>  I've never been in the situation described, but I have been through a couple of mugging attempts where the assailants were armed with blades or blunts, not firearms. I was able to stay calm during those, so I can only hope I would be able to in the situation described.<br>  <br>  Thinkingblade|`|6pUzzsuhaa	that is exactly why, when i'm old enough, i'm going to be getting a concealed permit. <br>  <br>  but if a gun was drawn me and that person had the intent of shooting/killing me, i would have NO problem shooting to injure/kill them- i'd would be protecting my self and others to- and obviously that person who had the gun drawn on me doesn't have any respect for any one or anything- so there'd be nothing on my conscience because of the situation<br>  <br>  <br>  Just like Doc said- if he had people laying down or moving them somewhere, i would definitely have no problem shooting the sorry "person". I wouldn't give any warning and i'd probably shoot him dead- dont know where- just anywhere i have a clean shot- but if the 'person' is doing that- then you know for a fact that 'they' have no respect for ANY living thing on this earth<br>  <br>  <br>  the local Hardee's was robbed twice in one week, and a friend of mine's house was broken into around 3 pm and the person couldn't take it to court because if he would have, the would be dead by now... but, if i had a concealed permit, i'd feel a LOT safer going to town.. the locks on your car and a pocket knife can only do so much.|`|AA11694178	The secret lies in waiting for the opportunity for you to get the drop on the bad guy.  You do not do this by trying to do a quick draw Hollywood, Dirty Harry, Super Hero thing.  You will most likely just get killed before you can get your gun into action.  Bide your time, do what he says.  He is very nervous and will be concerned with what everybody is doing.  Wait, be ready and don't move until you can safely draw your weapon get a clear shot at him.  You have to ALWAYS be aware of what or who is behind the bad guy before firing a shot at him.  You don't want to try to be a hero and kill an Innocent bystander.  If the opportunity to use your weapon does not present itself, so be it.  You have no obligation to use your weapon just because you have it.  It is, after all, intended as a DEFENSIVE weapon to protect your life or that of your family.  In this situation, your first obligation is to make sure that you do nothing to cause yourself or anyone else to be injured or killed.  That is all!  If you have the opportunity to use your gun to protect others or yourself, fine.  If not, don't try to be a hero.|`|HMgDJ8EEaa	I'd have to agree with the first answer.|`|mqXyDTwwaa	Doc is right. Shoot him with no warning. If you told him to stop, or told him to drop it, he could point his gun at you and fire. Even if you already had your gun pointed at him, if you shoot and miss, he could shoot and kill you, because you wanted to give him a sporting chance. Don't EVER shout a warning, or fire a warning shot. Just pull it out, aim, and pull the trigger.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	I wouldn't have to do anything because according to the 2nd Amendment I don't need any Permits, or Fees, or does anyone else.* If every Citizen exercised their 2nd Amendment Rights that our Forefathers originally wrote for us to Protect, Defend, Preserve, and Enforce our 2nd Amendment Right against all Enemy's Foreign or Domestic it would not be necessary to do anything, because the threat would not be there in the first place.* Why; because everybody would be Armed.*...

I certainly would not just draw and fire if he was just stealing beer and chips. They aren't worth taking a life over.|`|8MUj24s6aa	Depends on the situation. If he is in the front of the store and I am in the back aisles I have the upper hand. If we are in the front of the store I would have to wait until I have an opportunity.|`|AA12274507	I am with Doc. It isn't my money so I don't care and I also very seldom carry cash on me anyhow. I actually carry all my important cards in a separate fold in my breast pocket.|`|4AbXxowTaa	If he doesn't have it pointed at me than I'd draw mine and tell him one time to drop it.

It isn't to lay down and play dead.  My favorite slogan is:  "Evil men prosper when good men do nothing!"  Having a concealed weapon permit is for the very purpose of NOT doing "nothing".  If you don't intend to use it, there really isn't much reason for you to carry it, is there?  Responsible people carry.  If you have no intention of being responsible, don't carry.  It will only get you hurt in the long run.|`|uChkvc5qaa	Draw at the first chance and put 2 in his chest. My state requires opportunity, intent, and ability to cause severe injury, to justify deadly force. In that situation he meets all three. I won't wait to see if he'll leave witnesses. That being said, don't carry if your not willing to go to prison over defending yourself. It has happened.<br>  <br>  Well Archerdude, you must live in California. So, go ahead and stand there and wait to die. Vigilante justice my @ss. Protect yourself and maybe take the moral high road like a man.

BUT Wenger needs a DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDER , and he hasn't got that at the moment , so this transfer will either turn out to be good/bad , but i think for the rest of this season , Wenger will be regreting not buying a defensive midfielder.    but...i can't wait to see him play.

TNA & WWE are two polar opposite brands besides the fact its entertainment. WWE has way more talented wrestlers than TNA. But lately TNA's been having more interesting story-lines.

ise05jjUaa	I love the Suns, I think with the constant run & gun of the old ways they have improved quiet tremendously.  Simply because if you recall in the past, such teams as the Clippers & other teams that should have been no match for the Suns gave them a run for the money.  The Suns either lost to those teams, or barely won by a couple points & that should have never happened but they always seemed to crumble when it came to teams like this.  As for the loss of Stoudemire due to surgery, that remains to be seen as to whether or not the change of their offense can keep up with such teams as Boston, their next game on Sunday February 22.  If they can beat Boston on Sunday, that should erase most doubts people have.|`|NzrTgpe4aa	Its probably because of new offense. Its how the Suns play, high speed fast break offense. They're probably not gonna do it against an elite team, especially without amare, but if they do, thatll convince me that they are one of the top teams in the league. If its against the Celtics,Lakers,Cavs, or Spurs, ill be so convinced they should deserve bye to NBA Finals.(and they win by more than 20)|`|G1ZxaqNVaa	i love the suns<br>  <br>  but now....... breaking news......... amare got injured (eye)<br>  and i dont think that their playoff hopes will come true, but i would love to see it happen<br>  <br>  i think that they can do that against an elite team if barbosa plays like the sixth man award winner he was|`|jA6OZjIGaa	yes the main change is the coach<br>  <br>  but they will not do that against an elite team|`|tzrLDbHWaa	You're talking 2 games against the Clippers and a game against OKC.  You're talking 2 teams that combined, have 26 wins, less than the Suns.  <br>  <br>  I don't know how much the new coach has to do with it or if it's just them playing against the worst competition possible.  Lets see what happens Sunday against Boston and well see if they're for real.|`|Jp2415Whaa	I'm so happy, even if it was against the low tier teams.  I'm just happy they switched back to what worked best for their team instead of making the players get older and older, trying to implement D.  I went to the Suns v. OKC game, Barbosa is a badass.|`|58d6b4483a329162e1f9eeafcf972793aa	Very impressive to say the least.  People say yeah well it was against the Clippers and the Thunder. But how many teams that played the Clippers and the Thunder this season put up 140 points? None<br>  <br>  I think the head coach has a lot to do with it, they clearly weren't responding to Terry Porter "Half Court" and "Defensive Oriented" schemes. So when Gentry stepped in and said let's go back to having fun they responded and took off.<br>  <br>  If in practice he has them run, run, run I don't see why not they couldn't do it to an elite team. They're being trained and coached to run for 48 minutes a game, I'm sure no other team is being coached that way, so one of these teams are going to get tired of chasing them all night. they probably could.<br>  <br>  3 straight 140 games is very impressive.|`|fKlZdoPHaa	Its nice to see they are playing the way they play at their best, but we are talking about 2 games against the Clippers, and 1 against the Thunder. Wait till they play a good team, only then you can tell the difference.|`|KZOB5cghaa	dont get carried away...the suns played the clippers twice and they played the thunder.....but 140 points is a lot of points but i need to see that against a stronger opponent to get convinced|`|MnjOXJnJaa	not sure if the Seven Seconds Or Less philosophy is being preached again, but it looks like they're going back to not playing D and just outscoring teams again... like when they used to be good.

LIKkt8djaa	Yes there is, Directional could mean a few things, One the bindings are set back so you'll always have a longer nose then tail, This will make riding switch much harder. Two it could also have a directional flex which means the nose could be softer then the tails stiffness. This makes riding park even more tricky, Generally if you're even thinking of getting into the park get a True Twin snowboard. The flex will be the same all the way through the board and the binding stance will be centered on the board so your nose and tail are the same length.

E9wQwf77aa	i dont think they will win the west becasue boldin contract dispute but they will still have good chemistry and a soild offense|`|XLXncQu9aa	Well, considered how bad the NFC west is, I'd say they will likely sweep the division again, but they won't be 12-4.  The Cardinals really need to address their defensive issues.  The fact that Warner is returning does give that franchise some hope, but Boldin still has yet to come to terms with the Cardinals.  If he stays, then there is a possibility they could make another playoff run.  Will they be as good as they were this season?  That has yet to reveal itself.  I think if they work on their defense they can get to the playoffs again and make a 10-6 record at best.  As long as they keep the offensive pieces they should be fine.  Their offense has been great since Whisenhunt took over.  The only thing standing in the Cardinals way for next year would be the 49'ers.  I think they will be the one's to compete against since they showed so much promise, but I still believe the Cardinals can take the weak NFC west division.|`|YCwmCDkUaa	9-7|`|5btzOywVaa	I think they'll do pretty good next year. They had a great defense in the playoffs and if they can keep that going I think they'll do great, with or without Boldin, because they have Fitz and Breaston. They'll probably make the playoffs. They'll probably get between 10 and 12 wins.|`|hynkDOeEaa	HE IS?!<br>  Awesome![:<br>  <br>  I agree with you maybe 11-5?<br>  I dont know.<br>  As long as we have Fitzgerald, Hightower, Breaston, James and some others.<br>  Then here comes success hopefully[:
2dF53Qfjaa	it'll take a while, their still a very young team. But hopefully they will, they have some good players to revolve around such as Ellis. If they can pick up some good pieces like the Celtics did last season , who knows what will happend.

ZWkX43zMaa	1.Yes. It will be MJD and Chauncey Washington.<br>  <br>  2.As of right now, no. The Panthers franchised Peppers and I don't think they'd trade him. Maybe in 2010 though.<br>  <br>  3.Either LT will restructure his contract, or he will be gone for the 2009 season. The Chargers are serious about trading him, only if they get a good deal.|`|RS3fjNboaa	!. Jacksonville only had a decent running game because the passing game was sub-par.<br>  <br>  2. Julius Peppers will NOT go to Dallas for a couple of reasons. The Cowboys have no cap room to sign him and DWare. Also, if the Cowboys wanted him, they would have to give up TWO first round picks to the Panthers and the Cowboys don't have a first round pick this year.<br>  <br>  3. I really think LT will stay with the Chargers because it's best fr both parties. there may be a late move on that, but I doubt it. I think you're beloved LT remains a Charger.|`|xFfskbjYaa	1) MJD will be the featured back, and he has shown he can be that in pass protection, short and long-yardage downs, and as a reciever. He has matured into a complete back (with Taylor's help), and even as a Colts fan i admit he's prolly the best back in the division. (Slaton,Addai,White and Johnson the others.) I expect a 1000 yardseason from him, and expect the Jags to bounce back.<br>  <br>  2)Its a possibility, he named only four teams he would be interesting in joining, so u never know. and him with D. Ware (OLB) on the other side, would be quite a pass rush.<br>  <br>  3)I think its just a back up plan. AJ wants LT, at least he claims to, and i think he just wanted to make sure he kept one. Guess he didn't have faith in the draft. I was predicting Beanie Wells for them, but i guess not.|`|vnzSTerjaa	1.) ?<br>  2.) doubt it, cuz he's gona stay with carolina<br>  3.)LT is goin nowhere, the worst that could happen is he takes a pay cut, A.J. smith sed he would find a way to keep sproles and LT, and im pretty sure he did, sproles is  a non-exclusive franchise player so that does not affect LT's situation at all|`|DNKNI27Baa	i can only kind of answer #3. being a huge Charger fan, I really think that..... well i dont REALLY think anything.<br>  <br>  maybe we keep LT one more year and if he can't proove he's still the halfback from 2006 (31 or so rushing TD's) then we release him next year.|`|ZKwVNBFpaa	MJD will take the load<br>  <br>  Peppers wants to go to 3-4 defense, so Dallas is likely<br>  <br>  LT stays in SD

McMahon doesnt usually take calls and say, " Sure, Rick, whatever you want to do..that will work with our storyline..." More than likely McMahon wants to bring on the guys that can fill the seats... and Flair can. My guess, Flair is sitting in his office, the phone rings..and its Vince saying, " Hey, can ya help me out...."|`|dcNT65mTaa	If he'd wrestle til he was damn near 70, I don't think he'd pass up any opportunities to make an appearance, especially with Wrestlemania right around the corner.|`|3b4c1d3bd81f17c846a0c8e8d5992d5daa	Flair is back?

He's alway's love wrestling he can't stop.|`|qVDY1hm5aa	Ric Flair's blood has wrestling flowing through it. I can where you're coming from though. I think Vince McMahon is doing this to boost up RAW's ratings for next week, even though it looks like a solid card anyway. TNA have already contacted him on doing a Sting vs. Ric Flair at 'Bound for Glory' 2009, for Sting's retirement. That would be extremely disrespectful. After the farewell he got at WrestleMania 25 and on RAW the night after, to do wrestle AGAIN and do it for WWE's rival company would be just spineless. An apperance every now and again on RAW wouldn't hurt much.|`|4ba12f239c0aac6c90812933cfb283b3aa	when some one kills or cripples him    Its in his blood|`|LfWghJYeaa	He will be done with the wwe after his apperence i heard roumurs that TNA wants to make him part of the TNA Roster.|`|uwXH3zXnaa	When he dies!Lol!

c819b9c0e601697d9b53e747cb45c707aa	Does your Employer give you the right to strut your stuff ?? If they do then they have given you that privilege , If the NFL( The Employer) says that is not allowed then the Employees ( The Players ) need to follow that , they get payed enough its not Rocket Science .<br>  <br>  Have a Great Weekend.|`|ymqWa8GNaa	You sound like someone who has not played the game.  If you score, you want to act like you've actually been in the end zone before, not insult your opponent with cockiness.  <br>  <br>  The antics in sports are playground, and when I played linebacker, if you wanted attention, I'd be sure and give it to you with a smashmouth hit the next time you either had the ball, or were "stumbling, bumbling along" and we were both away from the ball.  Most people who have played/are playing will tell you the same. <br>  <br>  You say this is not relevant to the sport?  You're wrong.  Take a moment to notice that the biggest "performers" in the end zone, T.O., Ocho the ****, etc., NEVER like to catch balls over the middle. They know people are waiting to knock them senseless.  Consequently, the defense is able to take away the crossing route from these clowns because - whether they run the routes or not - they won't catch the pass because they are too busy looking for the headhunters eager to pay them back for their clown antics.  Watch some tape and you'll see I'm right. It always has an impact in the game - but only those who've played it fully understand the full impact of people who don't respect both their teammates and their opposition with their on-field behaviors. It's the same as providing "bulletin board material" before a game.  The more you shoot your mouth off, the more you motivate the other team, and the more it will negatively impact you and your teammates. That is an immutable law of sports, and of life.|`|jKOB7n35aa	The NFL just likes all the extra income from fines.|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	Here's the deal, football is a team sport.  So first off, anyone moonwalking in the end zone because "he" scored a TD is forgetting that 10 other guys did all of their assignements so he could get there.  That's why slapping high fives with teammates isn't a foul but an extended dance number is.<br>  <br>  The other thing is that people tend to 'one up' each other.  "Oh, their team did that so I'm going to do something better when I score."  Soon enough someone decides they've been dissed and fights break out.  <br>  <br>  It used to be that even spiking the ball would get you a flag.  Things have loosened up, but there still needs to be something in between nothing and doing a Broadway song and dance number.|`|ZP122J4Uaa	I agree. The reason there is proffessional football and the reason that they get payed millions of dollars is that it entertains people. thats what the NFL revolves around--the entertainment. and to me the chad johnson celebrations a few years back made football that much more entertaining|`|MTkXXOsjaa	It's only poor sportsmanship in the No Fun League.|`|IoCK2bEnaa	actually the fines go to charity. You really think the NFL could feed off o little $10,000 fines? Uh uh...Yeah its a penalty after a certain extent. The No Fun League is a ***** sometimes.|`|ghUm8M3laa	You do not have the "right to strut your stuff" any more than you have the right to drive. <br>  <br>  The answer to your question is simple.  If the rules of the league include "victory dance or other celebration" in their definition of unsportsmanlike conduct then that's exactly what it is.  Any team or player that does not like the rule can choose not to play.<br>  <br>  Frankly, the only players that incur these penalties are stupid (i.e. I know the rule but I'll break it anyway), selfish (i.e. this is really all about me.  I don't care if I hurt the team because I want to dance for me.), and stupid enough to be called stupid again.  These players are poorly coached, too.

AA11570394	Get a large pillow case so the feathers are not packed in tight but very loose inside, sew shut, throw in clothes dryer set on high for 40 minutes. The heat will kill any life forms on the feathers including their eggs. Then remove from dryer, remove feathers and place in the small pillow case.|`|3Twg9Uuuaa	That would take a heck of a lot of dove to make some kind of pillow. <br>  <br>  after cleaning your bird rinse off the feathers in a strainer.

DE0eAiJvaa	First of all, let's be honest, the chances of your cousin (or anyone else for that matter) making it to the NBA are slim to none.  Of course, that's not to say it's impossible.  The Micheal Jordan himself was cut from his freshman basketball team in high school and he turned that failure into determination and well all know how that turned out.  <br>  <br>  My suggestion would be for your cousin to do much the same.  Everyone has failed in certain degrees at certain things and there's no use in getting down on yourself for it.  Use the experience to make yourself stronger.  Looking at it straight from a basketball point of view, take the time between now and try outs for the high school team to get better.  Play the game as often as possible.  If games aren't available, shoot free throws and jump shots; practice makes perfect.  Do the little things most young players don't want to do; learn to play tough, smart defense (it's not all flashy blocks and steals), work the fundamentals (footwork, court vision), go after every loose ball like it's the last, show more hustle and will than any other player on the court.  Basically your cousin should do everything he possibly can to MAKE the high school coaches keep him on the team.  Scary where simple determination can get you.<br>  <br>  Oh, and good luck!|`|ise05jjUaa	Honestly, if he's already cut himself short without even giving himself a chance than no he's not going to the NBA, simple as that.  No one is going to keep him from achieving what he wants to do besides him & he's done already given up on himself so he can kiss that dream goodbye.  There's many NBA players that didn't even start playing basketball till high school, but what ever he has no confidence in himself so why even bother trying to hype him up, that's on him & no one else.|`|plTYZU85aa	Everybody thinks this atleast once or twice in there lifetime it doesn't matter the sport or field.Tell him to practice and keep his head up. Basketball is hard work and not to be rough on him or anything but to make the NBA is all hard work 24/7. And just to clarify MJ didn't make his HS varsity team his sophmore year, because his coach said he wouldn't get enough playing time because he was a sophmore. That year he averaged like 30ppg in JV.|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	Just tell him to be confident and not look at the past and just see the future. Anything is possible.|`|fAMpj8s2aa	i'm pretty sure i've heard that michael jordan didn't make his high school team.<br>  <br>  edit: yeah, it's true. Jordan couldn't even make the varsity as a sophomore at Laney High School in Wilmington, N.C.<br>  <br>  whoever thumbs downed me just doesn't know basketball, prob a chick.|`|dfTMaV58aa	micheal joedan didnt make his high school team...|`|fKlZdoPHaa	Tell your cousin that he can do it. If he tells himself that he cannot, then he will not. <br>  <br>  Also, tell him that Tim Duncan started playing basketball in the 9th grade.

0Dm3WEMcaa	LOL! i wouldn't call anyone that only cares about one form... almost form... of wrestling a wrestling fan.

Ahh incompetence!    *Edit* i wouldn't call what Hung T is doing spamming... Spamming is advertisting...

I know that most guys and girls here do watch things like TNA, ROH, NJPW, Dragon Gate and other promotions. But some people call themseles wrestling fans when they only watch WWE. No, that's called a WWE fan, not a wrestling fan. Big difference between the two!|`|h9PVRHPWaa	No way would I want another one of those TC badges.    The WWE sort of has a monopoly on Wrestling right now. In the past i watched, UWF, NWA, WCW. If it was on tv I watched it.

I would be pretty surprised if one of the NY teams was in the WS.

They said, "The only thing worse than being a Yankee fan is being a Mets fan."|`|fKlZdoPHaa	I heard they were pretty nasty to New Yorkers ( Mets fans, I assume. I don't see any reason why they would do it to Yankee fans). My friend told me that you can't take your family there, and that they made bleachers creatures look nice.<br>  <br>  Edit: Thanks Elizabeth. Yep, there we go. They don't like the Yankees as well. I guess they hate New Yorkers in general.<br>  <br>  I guess EDoug missed the late 90s.|`|n2yaCx3vaa	Being a phillies phan i don't give crap what the mets do because they won't be able to beat us with the team we have no matter who they sign.

nqdDe3cJaa	not sure what you mean by harder.  four seam fastball seems to be what youre looking for.|`|8RrNrjFPaa	practice strengthening your arm by long tossing, and even throwing with weighted baseballs, but don't overwork your arm, and always ice it down when you are done|`|c64b55c57d1c97df1d0f7cdd4b322789aa	There are many factors that determine velocity. The size of your body helps because the longer and taller you are the more leverage you create making it easier to throw harder.     Also muscle strength as far as legs, shoulders, and your core have a little to do with it.    However the biggest factor is your hips. The quicker you can turn your hips, the faster you throw. Zamaya for Detroit has the quickest hip rotation in the Bigs and he throws 100+ mph. I read this in the sports edition of Popular Science magazine.|`|j6YWA3Qnaa	put as much of your body weight into it as possible.|`|1vbX1KYAaa	Also your mechanics is a big deal.  Try holding the end of a towel and pretend you have a ball in your hand and try pitching and if the towel makes a snap noise at the end of your motion then you have good mechanics.  Of course there is a lot more to having good mechanics than just this drill but this can help a lot.|`|h074DM42aa	Pitch more.    But, pitch with more body control.  Too many different ways to increase velocity, but if they all worked for everyone all of us would have 95+ or over . . .    So, my suggestion is to work with your coach.  Usually a video of you throwing will identify little things that will add up quickly.      Oh yeah--once you start, don't change.  And whatever you do, don't model . . . just do your own thing!

If you heard on ecw i m not sure if it's storyline or not christian likes being in ecw and has some exclusive contract with ecw because it was the only brand he wanted to come to. I personally think that wwe isn't going to let him stay too long because once christian does his job and ecw ratings rise and the fans get behind him he'll be drafted. I hope he gets drafted to smackdown or raw after the draft because he proved that he's every bit as talented as edge and proved it in tna. Most likely after staying in raw or smackdown for a couple months he'll establish his name a bit more and might be a world champion. Hope that helped.|`|JwW7j8yYaa	Yes probably because ECW is getting pretty boring|`|GJQIL0RZaa	Work on ECW\|`|6mA5SE6Naa	That was the Original plan for him to cause jeff hardy the tile at the rumble.... but it got leaked every where and too many people knew about it. and it wouldn't be surprising...... so they went with matt turning on jeff instead.

Either way you both suck.|`|yk4S7uuraa	...obviously not Hannah Storm.|`|REa2QBPHaa	Early life<br>  <br>  Albert Belle, and his fraternal twin, Terry, were born on August 25, 1966, in Shreveport, Louisiana, the son of Albert Belle Sr., a high school baseball and football coach, and Carrie Belle, a former math teacher. A former Boy Scout, he attained the rank of eagle. Belle attended Huntington High School in Shreveport, where he was a star baseball and football player, a member of the National Honor Society and vice president of the local Future Business Leaders of America. He graduated sixth in his high school class and made the all-state baseball team twice. In 1984, he was selected to play for the USA in the Junior Olympics in which the U.S. won a silver medal. He played outfield and pitched, winning one game. After graduation, Belle was offered many football and baseball scholarships, including one to the University of Notre Dame and an appointment to the United States Air Force Academy. However, Belle decided to stay close to home and accepted a baseball scholarship to Louisiana State University.<br>  <br>  [edit] College<br>  <br>  Belle played college baseball at LSU from 1985–1987 where he made 1st team All-SEC in 1986 and 1987 and played in 184 games, with 585 at bats, 194 hits, 30 doubles, 49 home runs, 172 runs batted in, 157 runs, a .670 slugging percentage, and a .332 batting average.<br>  <br>  After college, he was drafted by the Cleveland Indians. While in the minor league system he was known as "Joey" (his childhood nickname) and was thought of as a top prospect, but high-risk due to his temper and excessive drinking. Belle underwent counseling and became known as "Albert." Umpire Durwood Merrill, who wrote a book called You're Out, and You're Ugly, Too, tweaked Belle by calling him "Joey" long past the time when Belle was known by that name publicly.<br>  <br>  [edit] Major League career<br>  <br>  Belle became the fourth player to have eight straight seasons of 30 home runs and 100 RBI, joining Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx, and Lou Gehrig. As a fielder, Belle had a powerful throwing arm, unsurprising given that he was a gifted pitcher in high school. His Range Factor by games played was consistently higher then the Major League Average Range Factor at that position.[1] He was an accomplished base runner and base stealer, with a career high of 23 steals in 1993, and a surprising 17 steals in 1999 despite hip problems. Belle led the league three times in RBIs, three times in total bases, three times in extra-base hits, and twice in slugging. He was a five-time All-Star between 1993 and 1997.<br>  <br>  Notably, Albert Belle's career highs in home runs, RBI, batting average, runs scored, and walks occurred in five separate seasons.<br>  <br>  In 2006, the Hardball Times published a statistical comparison of Belle's career statistics with that of 60 of his current and former peers. The article ranked Belle in career "prime value," behind current Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner and presumed future inductee Frank Thomas.[2]<br>  <br>  In 1994, Belle lost the batting title to the New York Yankees' outfielder Paul O'Neill, .359 to .357. Belle's post-season record was limited to two heavy-hitting appearances, in which only his batting average suffered: he hit .230/.405/.557 (batting average, on base percentage and slugging percentage, respectively) with six home runs and 14 RBIs in 61 at-bats.<br>  <br>  In 1995, Belle became the first player in the history of the major leagues to hit 50 homers and 50 doubles in the same season; before Belle, the last player to reach as many as 40 in both categories had been Willie Stargell in 1973. The achievement was especially impressive because Belle only played 143 games in 1995 due to a season shortened by the previous year's players strike. The 40-40 mark has been surpassed since, most recently by Alfonso Soriano in 2006, but Belle's 50-50 combo remains unique.<br>  <br>  His reputation, and more specifically his disdain of the media, cost him votes for the 1995 MVP Award. Belle finished second in the media voting to the Boston Red Sox's Mo Vaughn. This result occurred despite Belle's having led the American League that season in runs scored, home runs, RBI, slugging percentage, and total bases, and despite his outpacing Vaughn head-to-head in every important offensive category except RBI (both men had 126); both players' teams reached the playoffs. This was in the middle of a three-year streak in which Albert Belle finished 3rd, 2nd, and 3rd for the American League MVP. Belle had two other top ten MVP finishes, in 1993 (7th) and 1998 (8th).<br>  <br>  In the winter of 1996, Belle signed a 5-year, $55 million deal with the Chicago White Sox as a free agent. This contract made him the highest paid player in baseball for a brief period. Belle enjoyed two great seasons in Chicago, including a career-high 27-game hitting streak in May 1997. Belle came close to having another 50/50 season in 1998, with 49 home runs (a White Sox team record that still stands) and 48 doubles.

You'll be thinking about bat off shoulder a swing than tilting your head.  Watch the Pitchers arm and release.  Not so much the ball, you know its getting there.  Once you gain the swing back start taking off the shoulder an inch or so, than your speed and contact will increase as well.   Hope this helps a little.

Unless you have a competent hitting coach on hand, just stop thinking about it, get back in the cages and get your swing back.|`|jKOB7n35aa	When you loop down you are dropping your hands. To fix this you may want to try a lighter bat, or just work on hitting off a tee. To keep you from pulling your head out you should try to take less violent hacks, and wait a little before swinging. If you are way in front you'll subconsciously try and bring yourself back, which hurts you more and is why your head flies out. There isn't much you can do to help this, but one thing you can do is keep your chin on your right shoulder and during your follow through make sure it touches your left shoulder.|`|ArCVeBHyaa	my coach tells me to bite the shoulder part of my sleeve when m head turns. since your swing is looping, that means your dropping your bat head. the best thing for that is the old-fashioned hitting off the tee. hope i helped.|`|lEH7Xkb9aa	Go through your whole swing slowly several times without the loop. Do it in segments, imagine a ball flying at you in slow motion, watch the ball straight into the barrel of the bat. Go to a batting cage, before you step into the cage, do the same exercise i just explained. Step into the cage and take nice smooth swings, you're not trying to impress anyone, focus completely on the ball until you make contact, do not move your head at all. You're going to have to sacrifice some power for awhile until your swing works it self out, there isn't any quick fix to stuff like this. The reason your head is moving about is that your swinging so violently and there is so much movement. This in part makes the weight of the bat move your shoulders then your head. So remember, practice your swing slowly, in the cage swing nice and smooth and keep that head centered on the ball.|`|dwHHf7tWaa	i'm a lefty too so i will try to help. keep your feet and sholders level. and dont lean foward. and your head should always face the pitcher. and if you want to hit it harder, make sure you keep you hands as close to your body as possible, it might seem weird to start with but it really helps.|`|8668f05e854dcb2756138e1a4373d74faa	To keep yourself from turning ur head bite your shirt, it'll keep your head from swinging out.  and for the swing just practice your form, try it slowly and then try to pick up the speed just practice practice practice.|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	keep your head down on the ball

rTSwouqXaa	Bull riding is an event in rodeo. The original Spaniards started Rodeo (Ro-day-o) in the early 1700's, as a way for large ranches to get together and allow the Vaqueros to show off their skill. Although the sport has changed some from the original rodeo, every event is bases off of work done on working cattle ranches even today. Rodeo has striven to keep the heritage of the original Vaqueros alive. In the original form Bullriding was a way to break bulls/oxen to plow. Now it is a highly exciting and entertaining event.<br>  <br>  For more of the cultural and historical significance of rodeo you can check out. <br>  <a href="http://www.prorodeo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.prorodeo.com</a>  or<br>  <a href="http://www.pbrnow.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbrnow.com</a>|`|pueeMH6gaa	Yes it signifies low intelligence and a hatred of animals.|`|mNusN5hIaa	fat tay is not correct.<br>  <br>  rodeo in general is a way for cowboys to display ranching history and skills. bull riding was really for fun but is really dangerous.|`|X9Ws9nToaa	If your full of bul!
smcDn76jaa	I know a undisputed tag team championship seems exciting, but what difference will it really make? We all know that WWE is barely even trying with their tag team division.

Considering how little depth there is in the WWE tag scene, 2 tag titles is unnecessary. Having 1 tag title will make the tag division more competitive, and with the creation of one or two more tag teams it could make the division as a whole pretty good.|`|OuFhcdX9aa	i think the wwe should go bac to having only one belt in every division.<br>  so only the world champion ship. the IC title and the world tag titles along with the womens title.|`|CJzbIhWuaa	not yet, its for the colons titles and they win, i think after that miz and morrison will defend theirs and win then there will be a winners take all match at mania|`|IadpaNR2aa	Colons will win|`|DJeij6Pgaa	They will not they already lost to carlito and primo they have taped 2 episodes last tuesday.|`|85ecad91da4761d50060ea7e04b61701aa	Miz and Morrison for Undisputed tagteam champions!|`|Rq2BZ2Zeaa	I hope the Colons win, the miz and morrison had been pushed enough|`|GJQIL0RZaa	THe Colons win|`|HLsNzQNZaa	The Miz And John Morrison Win Even Though I Want The Colons To Win.<br>                                        =]
iOICjcZcaa	She got cancer back when they were married. You'll hear a lot of crap from people saying he cheated on her while she had cancer, but that's completely untrue. I read his book.<br>  <br>  She got into remission and started separating herself from Batista. She refused to get a job, and when she finally did, she'd skip out almost everyday to hang out with her friends. She refused to talk to him when he came home after a match because she thought it made it easier when he "left" her again. THAT'S when Batista decided he'd finally had enough. <br>  <br>  I'm not condoning his cheating, but people really need to do their research before they start making up crap.|`|smcDn76jaa	Yes she had cancer, and Batista cheated on her.|`|ptDHZK7Jaa	i read so many stories bout batistas wife havin canver n he cheated on her w/ melina i just wanna know da "truth"|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	Yes, she had cancer and was taking treatments.|`|GJQIL0RZaa	Had Cancer

And there is tons of up side left in him.  two years ago he hit 51 bombs.  Sheffield is another low risk guy to take late.  Also, David Murphy from the Texas Rangers is a good pick, he was on pace to make a run at the ROY until he got hurt.  Dontrell Willis is another guy you could use a pick on late if you get some good arms early.|`|t0bx27bVaa	Victor Martinez and Fausto Carmona.<br>  <br>  Trust me.  V-Mart is completely healthy again which is trouble, and he'll be eligible at first too.<br>  <br>  Carmona is getting stronger again.  In fact I read that his sinker is even better than 2 years ago.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend Carl Crawford, Travis Hafner, Coco Crisp, and Robinson Cano|`|M9JF9qcOaa	Carl Crawford is still 27 years old, and until last year's injuries was one of the most consistent players around and a regular 1st round pick.

Bargain.|`|c9PHwfVMaa	Alexei Ramirez of the ChiSox, he'll have a breakout year. Carmona has a better sinker now so I expect he'll rebound, but dont expect much strikeouts from him. Nick Swisher, if he gets playing time, will rebound ferociously. Max Scherzer, he has an extremely good strikeout/9 rate, and if he gets a lot of playing time, he'll put them to good use. Mike Pelfrey can win at least 15 games, especially since he plays for a contender like the NY Mets. Chris Davis, that guy has a lot of potential and he might even hit 30+ homers. Always be on the lookout for prospects on the rise, too.|`|REa2QBPHaa	Mike Gonzalez, chris volstad, johnny cueto, torri hunter|`|eSL9tWnQaa	Justin Verlander<br>  Clayton Kershaw<br>  Carl Crawford<br>  BJ Upton<br>  Chone Figgins<br>  Robinson Cano|`|U7cJYik4aa	David Ortiz<br>  he's come back in shape and with a plan to knock out beliefs he needs manny to be good.|`|0MJRD9sYaa	Fausto Carmona
OrG2fBbKaa	Save the relationship, enroll her in ski school and be supportive of her.  You try to teach her how and it will strain the relationship and sher will not understand why you are so demanding of her and you will be frustrated with her slow learning curve.

wPKUl3CTaa	You could be a great running back, Linebacker, or Defensive end got great endurance and strength but always remember since your 5'8 stay low.|`|ZP122J4Uaa	if what you are saying is true (which i am guessing is maybe exaggerated a little) then in Junior High you will be fine no matter where you are at. Once again assuming you are telling the truth go out for a big impact positions like RB and linebacker|`|DNKNI27Baa	beast. improve your grades first off...verticale is not spelled verticale. its spelled VERTICAL.<br>  <br>  i say WR. if you have good hands. as a coach, i wouldn't care if you could bench press a car, jump clear over Shaq and run as fast as Flash from the Incredibles. If you have good hands or quick feet or something, then you can decide. you need to expand on your question.|`|O8thhKSgaa	first of all, its vertical not verticale, and second you can't jump 38 inches, thats 3 ft. 2 inches Kobe's vertical is only 36, but if you are 5'8 in 7th grade and somewhat fast with leaping ability but clearly exaggerated, either wide out or corner|`|5btzOywVaa	Running back or linebacker. If you have good hands receiver or corner/safety.
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	It might be because of the mature themes in WWE that are used like the Diva matches, edgy storylines and some of the language used etc.Your mom might deem this to be unsuitable because of your age, but you could try and get her to watch WWE with you so that she can make an informed decision herself.Good luck anyways !|`|2FKHNIB2aa	Oh my god your mom is a TNA fan!!! Get out of that house now!!    No its just that some people still have misguided views about wrestling and you mom is one of them she probably thinks it will make you violent, or you will try to do that stuff to others, or that wrestling is a homosexual thing which its not. You probably cant change her mined that easily but if wrestling is something you truly love talk to her about it let her experience it for herself or you could always watch online.|`|XfzgA03baa	cause some parents think that wwe makes you angery and it makes you fight people so they are trying to protect you, Its for your own good buddy|`|lkw5ZyDIaa	tell your mom this, promise her that you wont do the thinks you see in t.v tell her that u like watching it but you wont reenacted it.|`|Q7kNtNSRaa	parents this it is too violent and it make you angry and bad tempered.  My dad was going to block wwe from our tv lol. I|`|VBfhoqS3aa	My parents think it makes me a violent person. Im just that way. Maybe thats what your parents think, or maybe she walked into the room when the camera closed up on Litas titties?|`|7f1a7a7fb6efa0a03768ed12206c214caa	My son was 7 when he wanted to start watching wrestling.  I told him he could only watch it with me, and I controlled the remote and could turn it off at any time.  I would fast forward thru the diva matches, anything that involved Edge and Lita, and then talk to him a lot about what he could NOT do to his friends.  Now that he is 11, and WWE has toned things down (I noticed last night that John Cena's submission hold is the STF, not the STFU any more).  Maybe if you sit your mom down, and tell her why you want to watch, have her watch one with you so that she sees that it is not all boobs and beer like in the Attitude years she may give you a chance.  After watching with my son for so long I have become a fan, and he and I go to events all the time.  Not saying it will happen with your mom, but it is worth a try.|`|aSE076PZaa	they dont let you watch cause of the  fights,sex appeal,drama  you watch in and you get all hyped up  and u wrestle around with your friends,and someone will get hurt.  the sex appeal from all the female wrestlers wearing almost nothing  and the drama with acting and people to pretend to be cool or show off.

So you can see just how boring it gets lol|`|rEafx4QTaa	go wit 2k9, jus play with the game speed up, its looks better, is realer, and more fun than live|`|kFcdwVwdaa	naw bro just stick to 2k9 its a better game overall.
PvIFahGjaa	Not bad. Its pretty good.
MUERDKyzaa	More like Eboue to portsmouth. He can't ever legally get Sagna's spot.|`|3dPwxPSGaa	god no sagna is amazing. Eboue is good but sagna is alot better trust me, our best defensive signing since.....|`|KR3IvxNwaa	Eboue is a complete versatile player. but he can't play as a fit midfielder at Arsenal.    it's done Wenger,, put him back to defence.|`|AA12370193	Well if thats the sign it gives then I hope that is exactly what it is. True, since Hleb left Eboue has been RM, or since Sagna came as a matter of fact. But there is no other position for Eboue apart from RB and Wenger has been using him as a utility man more than was necessary.   My gosh when Sagna was injured last season Wenger opted to play our center back as RB and Eboue still in mid, which led to Babels dive for a penalty in the CL last year. If Toure was covering from the center he would have been facing babel instead of running beside him so that breathing on his shoulder wouldnt have knocked him down.    Nasri can go on the right now and Eboue and Sagna interchangeable at RB only, of course, Eboue now has to fight back for that position tho.      No we should never sell Eboue. His heart is at Arsenal, and Sagna is not invinsible he can get injured and fatigued. Eboue and Sagna could potentially be the best RB combination in the league (if they aren't already). I'm glad you remember Eboue for all he is worth once he is in his favored position. I'm pretty amazed he just listens to Wenger and tries his best instead of speaking out about being played out of position.|`|zJCWIWE0aa	We've got Andre Arshavin   we've got Andre Arshavin   nah nah nah nah HEY   nah nah nah nah HEY|`|HBLCUXu7aa	No We should never sell any single players currently in our squad - continuity will achieve a lot.  The problem people don't often see is we tend to have a lot of injuries and then they start talking about lack of depth and all that nonsense. We need a good bench like other teams do.    I do not think we are title contenders this season but next season we should do better - even win it. But our season is not over - there is the FA Cup, CL??? Who know??
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	Kane has already indicated to WWE that he's not really interested in a push or title challenge anymore.He's been hugely successful as Kane since he debuted the character at the Bad Blood ppv in 1997 and has become an integral part of the Attitude Era history.He's a multi-title champion already and now prefers to work with the younger talent and help develop their skills.|`|qNHMcRL4aa	I know!! He deserves to be a world champion and not pushed to the back!! Its even worse that his fueds are always used to make the little guy seem like a giant killer or as a way to make a talentless diva get more air time!!!    Mybe taker could win wwe and kane whc and then they have a match ay mania to bring back the undisputed championship!!!    I thought that raw would be good for kane and be better than having the ecw championship but then wwe wont let the title change habds out of the 3 or 4 peeps that r alwayss champ!!!    I wanted Kane to win the Royal Rumble!!!  Hopefully he will win the elimination chamber!!|`|FxvZmBGBaa	hmm....well, i think kane is more interested in hurting people than getting a belt!  lol XD|`|dcNT65mTaa	All I know is that Kane has been my fav wrestler since he wore the mask and one sleeve. I liked him better then cause he didn't do too much talking, just pounded on a wrestler and left. That one night title reign he had sucked, and the fact that the only major title he's had was on the lifeless ECW brand sucks even more. His time is slowly fading away as younger wrestlers mature in the ring into superstars. He deserved something to say for himself besides I was a multiple Tag Champ and one night only WWE Champ.|`|3icTrKLLaa	Kane has said himself that he doesn't want a world title. He would rather put on a great match and put over up and coming superstars, especially at this point in his career.|`|oqzaSJnfaa	rey vs kane jus makes kane look bad i hate it!! i wanna see kane destroy big guys.. despite rey is a great wrestler|`|qVDY1hm5aa	It's simple. Kane wants to put over the younger guys. He got his mega push back in the 90's and now he feels it's time to pass the torch to the younger generation. It's truly inspiring what Kane is doing for WWE right now. He's jobbing/putting over younger guys like Kofi Kingston, CM Punk, Ted DiBiase, Cody Rhodes and Randy Orton for WWE. Superstars like Batista and HHH who've had their fame are too selfish to lose every once in a while, whereas Kane is putting guys over every week. It's a real shame. I'm a big fan of Kane.|`|LfWghJYeaa	It is kanes gimmick the wwe made kane look like a person who will do anything to get what he wants that is the way Kane has been over ten years. That is why the have pushed Kane into the WWE Championship picture. The one time Kane one the WWF Championship was a accident. That is why the WWF Writers had him lose the WWF Championship the next day.|`|l0GWmWl4aa	This is a difficuly question to answer because Kane has been a True World Champion for a time of one day. But the list of former champions Kane has beatin has been outstanding. Being World Champion means that you represent the show your on and that you are the best wrestler on the show. But what i think it all comes down to is WWE and that they make stupid decisions all the time. So in some ways Kane deserves it but he will never have the title as long as guys like Cena, HHH, and Y2J are around.|`|e6TcpDcxaa	i agree he lost to kofi kingston couple of weeks ago for a chance in the elemanation chamber

Should be a good match if it does happen.<br>  <br>  <br>  BQ: Jeff is just ok in the middle he's not greater than half the other superstars like edge HHH matt etc. He's better than some others like batista snitsky and others.

TH1fT6rdaa	I'm sure after about 30 years of being deaf, he gets used to being able to determine stuff like that without his ears.<br>  <br>  The referee probably steps in a little extra to make sure.  And the other guy begins to walk to his corner.  And he probably sees both fighters' corners enter the octagon.  I'm sure it's not that difficult, especially after being a deaflympic gold medal wrestler, something that uses time limits the same way.|`|MCB1ovEtaa	I thought he was only partially deaf?|`|NJMzhcKhaa	Referee will move between the fighters, a universal sign of stopping the fight.<br>  He also usually look to the time which kinda prepare him for the referee to stop the fight between round.|`|m6oc91sxaa	the ref will tap him....plus he's usually aware of where he's at time wise so it all works itself out....
fAMpj8s2aa	studies show that colored people are born with a tendency to feel inferior to non colored people. this is acted out usually through violence or threats. that's why there are more coloreds in prison even though they are a minority in the population. so really, it's to be expected.<br>  <br>  edit: to the uneducated mr man above me, manu is actually italian which is classified as white. he was just born in argentina.|`|875OJEstaa	It's the game of basketball it's a contact sport.

tzrLDbHWaa	Cowboys are one, he hasn't disclosed the other 3, but it doesn't really matter now since he's franchised and none of them will sign him and give up 2 first round picks.  They'll likely trade him to one of those teams, since no other team will trade for him if they aren't going to get him long term.<br>  <br>  Now, if you want to try to narrow the list down, we can do that.  We know that Dallas is one, and 2 of the other teams are in the NFC.  We also know he wants to go to a team with a 3-4 base D.<br>  <br>  The only 3-4 teams in the NFC last season were the Cowboys and 49ers and the Packers plan to implement it this season. The Cardinals are also expected at some point to swap because Wisenhunt prefers it.<br>  <br>  As for the AFC, the 3-4 teams are the Steelers, Ravens, Pats, Dolphins, Jets, Chargers, and Browns.<br>  <br>  So, to sum it up.... the Cowboys are one.  Pick 2 out of 3 between SF, GB, and Arizona, personally I'd guess the Packers and Cardinals.  Then finally pick one team from the AFC.  Its not exact, but its the closest you'll get.<br>  <br>  Edit:  11-5 Dolphins, you don't understand the rules of the franchise tag.  It does not mean that no team can trade for him unless its for 2 first round picks.  It means if another team signs him, Carolina can either match the offer or they can let him go and get 2 first round picks.  If no team signs him, he has to take a 1 year deal worth the top 5 avg at his position, or 120% of his salary, whichever is higher, and they are free to do what they want with him, which includes being traded for anything Carolina sees fit to accept.|`|ntLUHiTAaa	he said he wanted to play in a 3-4 defense so dolphins, steelers, browns, 49ers, cowboys, and i think jets run the 3-4 defense so probably one of them but carolina did franchise tag him so he cant be traded unless for 2 first round picks.|`|EEZnaoXEaa	He's Franchise first of all so he really cannot pick and choose his teams the Panthers have full control. I can't see a top team giving up large amounts of draft picks for him he simply takes plays off!!!|`|wfDzUSItaa	He can't say because the Panthers would basically charge those teams with tampering, since free agency doesn't start until the end of the month.|`|LuWT8KQBaa	Does it matter now? Carolina franchised him. It's over.

AA11488609	Antawn, old Jason Kidd, but he gets reunited with Vince?<br>  <br>  Brook Lopez makes this crazy trade not so bad, but still this is a bad trade nevertheless|`|H1VIZsutaa	Maybe when the Spurs stop cheating, and that will never happen.|`|HmKRbaiIaa	That would be crazy if they traded Gilbert Arenas, because he is awesome. I know he is injured but when he comes back hopefully they will do even better.|`|REa2QBPHaa	how long did it take you to do this
BD78ZzYkaa	It is $410.00 for the weekend. You get one camp site and two tickets for sat. and sunday Race, General admission of course. Plus free shower facilities and the secure parking area. The only problem is that the waiting list is about four years long. But you can call the speedway and see if they have camping sites available as bad as the economy is you might be able to get a spot. Plus you can buy extra wristbands for the infield at # 100.00 each. the phone number is 1 800 944 7223
vJyF8siJaa	to call the attention of his players and signal a play.|`|dtGInk4Faa	to signal something|`|H1VIZsutaa	Because he is trying to get Kobe to look at his assey nipples.|`|fAMpj8s2aa	many of his team is made up of colored players. their roots take them back to africa where the language is more gutteral and focuses on noises rather than poetic phrase. he makes a whistling sound to get their attention because they respond better to it due to their roots.|`|sCHUFUXsaa	to tell the players what to do. <br>  <br>  simple.|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	To tell the players what to do.
TOKgPsdOaa	There is much controversy over cena and people usually love him or hate him. those who hate him beleive he got too big of a push and became like a superman and was simply unbeatable. and that was the case, he won practically every match for like 2-3 years and has main evented the past 4, soon to be 5, beating some of the top stars which sum say he didnt deserve to win<br>  he is however great for the business, he does a lot outside of just the WWE that represents them well and does many charity events and is a major icon for kids. and when you have half the people hate him and half that love him, it makes for a very controversial confrontation when he has a match|`|qlpjDvoNaa	I personally do not enjoy Cena because I think his character is weak. When he started out he was like this thug rapper type who was trying to be funny. Then he did this soldier type switch. These things are complete opposites of each other. It's ok to go back and forth between being a good guy or a bad guy but when you completely change the style of your character it just makes no sense. Plus he's not really a good technical wrestler....he's got heart and he loves the business...but he ought to put more work into his wrestling or he's never going to have matches like Austin/Rock or Hogan/Ric Flair|`|3k4tPNTGaa	I dnt hate cena i think he gave company a big push with his popularity. He deserve dt push. may b lots of people here dnt know bt last year he beat the hogan's record of selling most mercahndise. He may have a lot haters but still he has enough fans and he manage to beat hogan's record and he was close enogh to beat austin's record who hold dt record in istory of wwe.|`|BRBPDBvIaa	There shouldn't even be a reason to why people don't like john cena.  I like him cause he just don't back down from no one.  and there isn't a lot of wrestlers that do that.  People do need to cut him some slack.  He's a good wrestler and he sticks up for the fans.|`|xEAYCmqHaa	To tell the truth I really dont understand it either, I think Batista and Cena are both really fun wrestlers to watch.. and keep in mind they are only doing what they are told to do. in an interview cena himself even said that he would like to give the younger generation a push but Vince's storyline writers want him to be the PG hero in the WWE.<br>  <br>  Personally the only thing I have against them is that they hog the title I think. Aside from that I think they are decent wrestlers|`|RUMzIzzdaa	Its Because Cena Absolutely Sucks... The Guy Only Knows Like 4 Or 5 Moves I Can Name Em...<br>  <br>  1. The FU<br>  2. The Five Knuckel Shuffle<br>  3. The Sholder Barge<br>  4. The STFU <br>  5. The Fisherman Suplex...<br>  <br>  AND THATS ******* IT...<br>  My Five Year Old Cousin Could Do Those Moves LOL!!!<br>  Speaking of Kids...THOSE ARE HIS ONLY FANS!!!<br>  GOD 5 - 12 kids and Girls That Have only Started to Watch Wrestling!!!<br>  I Liked Him when He Wuz A Gangsta Rapper... But Now... <br>  Hes a Super Man Singles ****!!!<br>  And He ******* Held Onto That Championship For Over 2 Years Until Randy Orton Punted His ******* head OFF...<br>  I Don't Really Know What He Is Like As A Person, But All i Know Is That He Is an Overated Wrestler That Cannot Wrestle For ****...<br>  <br>  I Rest My Case|`|b7JS16dyaa	The hate that Cena and Batista receive should be directed at the writers. It's mainly due to them that both men get shoved down our throats as supermen. Plus, they aren't even that bad, if a bit predictable and limited with their wrestling skills.|`|Iqtoxb5laa	Before you say "oNly 13 yyear old girls like Cena" Im 13, and ima  girl. No i dont like Cena,reason being is that he gets boring. He is always involved in storylines and only has around 5 moves.|`|8utgHwgKaa	CENA IS OK,I DO'T HATE HIM,I'M JUST NOT A FAN<br>  <br>  BATISTA IS TRASH!! FORGET ABOUT THAT GUY!!|`|c614aa36f47781f6160bcceaebb97251aa	I don't dislike Cena, I was a fan of his in the beginning. There can be more than one reason<br>  <br>  1. His whole rapper gimmick was nice, the adult fans dug it, because he created controversy, at insulting the wrestlers. Now he''s just one of those typical goody two shoes babyface heels like Hulk Hogan was. No fan wants to see that, except the younger fans. <br>  <br>  2. He basically has only 5 or 6 moves that he does. It gets tiresome, watching him do the same moves, it's almost predictable.<br>  <br>  3. Vince keeps feeding him to the fans, despite the fact that many of the older fans don't want any more of him. He still has him as a face when half of the audience is booing him. <br>  <br>  It's really the IWC crucifying Cena. I'll admit, I'm not a fan of the whole Superhero Cena gimmick, it's cheesy. It would have been nice in the 80s, but this is the 21st century. Bring back rapper Cena.|`|ZDuIhDyDaa	HA! Very funny! what's wrong with screaming at a Jonas Brother's concert? Im a 31 year old father of 2 and I scream art them everytime! only because my kids step on my ingrown noenail!<br>  <br>  Seriously, Cena or Batista can not wrestle! It would not be bad, but they are like top stars! Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, Eddy Guerrero, Chris Benoit, Rey Mysterio...ok, the list goes on and on of wrestlers who worked their butts of to get to the top and just because a few BILLION kids like Cena, he gets to go in their and flop around like a fish!
8lsBBK62aa	I've ridden one loadsa times. You'll love it!
CLLsDlViaa	well he will most probably appear AFTER wrestlemania in the sort of situation|`|CJzbIhWuaa	no list, i wish, im going too, sorry to say but he probably wont be there and break his character, but im cool with meeting anybody|`|zHXPxQgWaa	hell yeah|`|XPLFBkA6aa	DUDE<br>  I REALLY HOPE SO,IM A HUGE FAN OF THE PHENOM,HES THE ONLY REASON IM GOING THERE,JUST A PICTURE WITH THE PHENOM OF THE WWE WILL SERIOUSLY CHANGE MY LIFE FOR...EVER|`|YCqpmxF7aa	WARNING   DONT TRY THIS LINK   <a href="http://getinall.palacebet.com" rel="nofollow">http://getinall.palacebet.com</a>|`|SYJhGXu4aa	google it!
