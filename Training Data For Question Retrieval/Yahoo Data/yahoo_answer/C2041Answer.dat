cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	You NEVER give points. Yahoo gives points for the best answer. Any level can vote or pick a best answer.    Don't confuse rating and voting for best answer. Anyone can vote for best answer.    Thumbs up/down is called rating and is available starting at level 2. It indicates what you think of an answer not necessarily the best. The person getting best answer gets an additional point for each thumbs up. Thumbs down does not affect points.    The person receiving the best answer receives 10 points. It can be selected by the asker or put to a vote. To choose a best answer do one of the following. If the question is yours you can select a best answer after 4 hours. You will have 4 days to do it. If it is someone else's question you will have to wait 4 days if the asker does not pick it himself. There will be a "vote as best answer" button. You must vote before the vote closes after 2 more days.    -----    250 points are required for level 2.    Here are the point requirements for each level. Make sure you understand that your profile indicates how many "MORE" points you need to reach the next level.  1 ? 1-249  2 ? 250-999  3 ? 1,000-2,499  4 ? 2,500-4,999  5 ? 5,000-9,999  6 ? 10,000-24,999  7 ? 25,000+    You gain points by:  Joining: 100 points  Signing in daily: 1 point  Answer a question: 2 points  Choose a best answer for your question: 3 points  The vote on your question selects "no best answer": 5 points (returned)  Vote for best answer: 1 point  Get selected as best answer: 10 points  Get thumbs up with best answer: 1 point each    You lose points by:  Asking a question: -5 points  Deleting your answer: -2 points (taken back)  Having a violation: -10 points    You can see the chart on how to earn points by clicking on your points or level.    ? ??l???q ?|`|zrKuaiDLaa	I dont think you can.....|`|dr9y4tJsaa	earn points by answering questions|`|CEKZsoFRaa	You can only give someone points when you vote their answer best answer on a question you have asked.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	You can give people points at any level. To give people points, you have to choose their answer as best.    To pick a best answer yourself, you have to wait four hours before the bubbles appear. The bubbles read, "Choose as Best Answer," and they appear under each answer. You click the bubble beneath the answer you like best, and then it will take you to a page, where you need to rate the response, and then leave a message to the asker. Then, you scroll down a little and click SUBMIT. The answerer will receive ten points, and you will receive three.    To put your question to vote, you can either wait for the time to expire and then vote for the best answer, or you can go to the pencil beneath your question. If you click on the pencil, three or four tabs (depending on whether you extended the expiration date or not) will pop down, and one of them will read "PUT THIS QUESTION TO VOTE." Then the question will be put to vote, and you and the Yahoo! Answers community will vote for the best answer. You will still receive three points when the question is resolved.    However, if you mean giving people points by rating their best answers, you have to get to level two in order to rate. To be a level two, you need two-hundred and fifty (250) points. To get those points...    -Answer to your daily limit (2 points per answer)  -Vote to your daily limit (1 point per vote)  -Log in every day (1 point per visit per day)  -Resolve ALL of your open questions (3 points each)  -Ensure that you're answers can be picked as best (10 points, plus X points for thumbs-ups)  -Ask questions every once in a while.

You have a total of 100 points, you only need another 150 points to get there.    You can vote for undecided questions at Level 1, even your own, but you need to be on Level 2 to rate answers (thumb up /down).   You are allowed to comment and award stars to questions but you do not gain any points for these activities.    The best way to gain points is to answer and vote to your limit each day, whatever level you are on.    Visit each day - 1 point  Answer to your limit each day - 2 points each answer - 20 questions - 40 points  Hope for some best answers - 10 points each best answer plus 1 point for every thumbs up (maximum 50 points)  Vote to your limit each day - 1 point each vote - 20 votes - 20 points  If you ask a question, -5 points, pick a best answer, you get 3 points back.

When I first joined Y!Answers I was really excited about the quality and the time people put in to help other people. Now, it's people spamming members who are really and truly sincere.  I think that people don't take Y!Answers seriously anymore. They see it as a 'high school' type place, to put people down to get themselves popular.

There is no way to have an inline image directly from your computer in Yahoo mail on the web. It requires a separate email program.    For IE go to the picture and right click on it and copy. Now go to the email body or signature and paste it.    For Firefox it is a little trickier. Go to the picture in another window. You must be able to see the picture and the email window at the same time. Drag the picture to the email body or signature.    The picture must remain on the web since a link is used and not the actual picture.    ? ??l???q ?

0817348e99674e0dc47d7e9f6badb2b7aa	The planets are grouped by age and Gender, except for pluto, who has been reclassified by species.    A light year is how we measure the age of the sun.    The sun gets energy from a steady diet of milky way bars.    Or you could go out to the  http://www.nineplanets.org/  website, which is an overview of the history, mythology, and current scientific knowledge of the planets, moons and other objects in our solar system. Each page on the website has text and NASA's images, some have sounds and movies, most provide references to additional related information.    Which would help you learn by doing your own research.|`|vPYcoJ0yaa	2) A light year is a measure of distance based on the speed of light. It is the distance light travels in one year (just under ten trillion kilometres) [1 light year = 9.4605284  10^15 meters].    3) the sun is one giant nuclear reactor, converting hydrogen into helium:  "Solar energy is created deep within the core of the Sun. It is here that the temperature (15,000,000 C; 27,000,000 F) and pressure (340 billion times Earth's air pressure at sea level) is so intense that nuclear reactions take place. This reaction causes four protons or hydrogen nuclei to fuse together to form one alpha particle or helium nucleus. The alpha particle is about .7 percent less massive than the four protons. The difference in mass is expelled as energy and is carried to the surface of the Sun, through a process known as convection, where it is released as light and heat. Energy generated in the Sun's core takes a million years to reach its surface. Every second 700 million tons of hydrogen are converted into helium ashes. In the process 5 million tons of pure energy is released; therefore, as time goes on the Sun is becoming lighter."|`|A2jyJ89iaa	I can't answer questions 1 or 3, but I do know that a light year is a unit of measurement to determine how far away an object is. For example, if someone says that a star is 50 light years away, then they are saying that we are seeing the star as it was 50 years ago, not right now. A light year is the distance which light travels over a year (I'm not sure what that distance is, but i know that it is a very big number)  Hope this helps.

Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile. It will take a short period of time for the picture to process, so be patient. Hope this helped! Good luck!

Follow these steps for Photoshop:    1. Add a new top layer above your existing background image.    2. Change the OPACITY of that top layer to about 25%.    3. Choose your color of desire and use the PAINTBRUSH to paint that color on that top layer.  You will not be able to see it as well as if it were 100% visibility, but you will be able to see through it to make sure you don't overlap where you want to add color.  Do this to every area you want colored.  Change the opacity only slightly depending on how strong you want the colors.    4. SAVE it AS however you like.

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	The removal of questions and answers is done on the basis of reporting and the reliability of the parties involved. While you may not SEE all the things that get deleted, often they will get deleted, but after you've noticed them. Things can get deleted at any time, even after they have been resolved.    When people report things multiple times in a row, they 'lose' reliability in their reporting, because their behavior looks like 'troll reporting'. So you have to be sure to report reliably, but not TOO frequently, to have the most impact for your reports. Also, other people have to be reporting as well. Sometimes, people will assume that 'someone else' is going to take care of the problem, so they don't bother to report -- and the item stays up much longer than it should as a result.

AA11507983	well first off what material is the Zentai  you bought made from?  Spandex is the most common, but I have made and seen it made from stretch cotton.  Spandex fabric can resist pinning and cutting, a rotary cutter works very well. Best when altering a made piece is to sew a base stitch to hold the shape of it.   Sewing spandex requires a special touch. You have to be gentle. Stretch stitches tend to have a lot of back and forth action and you're going to want control but what ever you do, don't pull the fabric taut when your sewing it on the machine. If you do the seam will look all wrinkled and puckered. Try to pull it with just the slightest tension and let the machine work it through for you. Make sure the stitch length is adjusted correctly and don't run the sewing machine too fast.    Spandex also has a bad habit of getting stuck in the machine and pulled inside. If you're getting unusual resistance or an odd grinding sound stop and make sure nothings caught up.  And it is best to use a ballpoint or stretch needle in your sewing  machine because a regular needle is likely to skip stitches or even put a hole in the fabric causing it to run.  You cannot use a regular straight stitch on your sewing machine when sewing stretch fabric because  the stitching needs to stretch along with the fabric. Many machines now have special stretch stitches built  right in. These stitches usually take two stitches forward and then one backward continuously, which allows  extra thread so the fabric can stretch. If your machine does not have stretch stitches then a close and narrow  zigzag stitch can work. Because these kind of machine stitches can make the fabric difficult to handle while  going under the needle because it moves around so much, the pieces can be stitched together first with a  simple straight (this is the base stitch I wrote about before) stitch and then gone over it a second time with the desired stretch stitch or zigzag. The straight  stitches can be easily removed by stretching the fabric, which will break the straight stitching threads, and  they can be pulled out.

Each user can be a top contributor in a maximum three categories.  You earn it or lose it depending on your recent participation in a certain section.  The more positively you contribute, the more chance there is that you will get a TC badge. Just like featured users or category leaders, it's another way to give credit to community members."    The TC badge is awarded on the number of questions answered and best answers received by the user in a particular week, in a particular category.    It is rumoured that you need at least a 10 percent best answers in your chosen category to get a TC badge although the actual percentage and the number of answers is Yahoo's secret.   All you see and read on the subject is speculation, rumour, assumption and guesswork.    A user who is on the leader board may or may not have a TC badge, the criteria is measured on weekly participation in a particular category (number of answers and % of best answers in the category).    The easiest way to get a TC badge is to concentrate on one category where many questions are asked and hope to get some best answers.    The Polls and Surveys and Jokes and Riddles categories do not have Top Contributors.    If you have contributed enough to meet Yahoo's criteria, the orange badge will appear below your avatar on Monday morning.    It can disappear just as easily on Monday morning, if you don't keep answering questions in your chosen category.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	You must answer Qs in one or two sections consistently & get at least 12 % best answers to get one|`|6qsTmMQaaa	To be a TC, you need to show knowledge in one to three different categories, except Polls & Surveys and Jokes & Riddles.

To become a Top Contributor, keep these things in mind ??    ?? Choose a category ??    ? Pick a specific sub category of all the categories you see to the left of the page. For example, if you are good in science and mathematics, you do not receive a Top Contributor's badge for that category but for its sub categories such as Chemistry, Physics, Math, etc.     ? You can have a badge in up to three categories which will show under your badge on your profile as well as your id card, which is what you see when you scroll over an avatar.    ?? Answer a lot of questions ??    ? Answer many questions in the category that you choose. I would say 25 Answers per week should be a near minimum.    ? Make sure you mostly answer questions you think you will receive Best Answer to. You need a certain percentage of Best Answers and the more you answer without thinking about this, the harder it will become to get a Top Contributor's badge.    ?? Best Answer Accumulation ??    ? Your answers should be to questions you believe you will receive a Best Answer to. Try to answer those questions that have very little or unknowledgeable answers because that gives you a better chance of receiving Best Answer.    ? The Percentage of Best Answers needed is 10% in the category.    ??Activity & Contribution??    ? When you gain the Top Contributor's badge, you have to constantly be on the site.  However, you do not have to not have a life as many people say. Simply 1 hour a day would probably be enough. Remember, this contribution is about 25 answers per week.        ??Here are some Hints??  ? The Y!A staff keeps the formula hidden so users will not abuse their rights. But the formula seems to be like this:    10% Best Answer Percentage   200 points per week    ? Users qualified for the badge will receive it on Monday Morning 12:00 AM California time.  ? Two categories do not provide a Top Contributor's badge because they are only for entertainment; these are:    Polls & Surveys   Jokes & Riddles  ? It is okay to vote for yourself with your only account when your answers to questions are in voting. However, it is not okay to use multiple accounts to do so as this is considered cheating.     ? ? ? ?   ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ?      Peace ?  ^_^|`|prW1i0vzaa	A Top Contributor is someone who provides the most answers in a specific topic.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	just answer a ton of questions in one category and get picked as the best answer. i used to be a singles and dating top contributor...WTF...I don't know everything.

kJTzXWoPaa	I think you're turning your computer off instead of using a better option. Whenever you do this, you have to log in again at every site you visit.    Instead of that, you can have your computer "stand by", by clicking on that button instead of "Turn Off".    What this does, is keep your computer from using too much energy while maintaining a "half awake" status. When you want to turn it on again, just move your mouse around on the pad, or double clicking your button.    By the way, in this state (Stand By), you can also turn your monitor off, thus saving yet more energy! Try it, it's how most computers in work places are kept.
8yE2sYGeaa	They used to.    In December 2006, to celebrate one year on-line, prizes were given out, depending on your level. Level 7s got a fleece jacket.    As late at Summer 2007, they were awarding prizes for participation in the Internet and Technology Contest    Nothing since.

iWjKnMU4aa	Maybe he's joking or that's his way of flirting (which is definately immature,) but I wouldn't trust this guy.I definately wouldn't like a guy who called me a whore. I mean, if he's around his friends, then maybe that's acceptable. If he's not, that's just plain mean. I think he might just be a flirt, or just having fun. Even if he says that only when he's around his friends, that shows that he doesn't respect you and doesn't care about how you feel about things, he just wants to look and be cool in front of people.    I'd move on and find a nicer, better guy that respects you at all times and in front of all people, who doesn't make you feel bad by calling you a whore or slut, (even if it's just a joke.)|`|zMAalpG5aa	I think that he does, he is just scared to admit it because he is scared of what his friends are going to think...|`|hWc65sEtaa	I wouldn't want him to like me if he insults me or calls me a whore.      I would say if he comes and sits by you and plays footsie then yeah.    Could he be around his friends when he insults you or calls you a whore?  If so, then I still thinks he likes you.  If not, then I don't know.

Like for example, in my yahoo name, 'k' stands for my favorite character in an anime, 'rose' because it's my favorite flower, and '31' because 1. the day I was born 2. reverse of 13, my favorite number. Hope these ideas and suggestions help you!! ^^

suPD7c3gaa	Any points you received is NEVER random and are always earned. Yahoo! doesn't randomly give out points.  There's always a reason.  You can get 10 points for receiving Best Answer.  If that answer had any thumbs up, that could be the one point.  There are no points given for stars, which are only for questions, or Best Answer ratings that the asker gives when awarding Best Answer.   Or if you just logged on for the first time today, that 1 point could have been that.  You will likely receive a notice of your Best Answer very soon.|`|dcWN4v6Jaa	You got a best answer which is 10 points and you probably gotten 1 thumbs up on that answer which results in 11 points. Happy answering!|`|fsLMFIpgaa	That would have been 10 for a best answer & 1 point for a star

6qsTmMQaaa	CARTOON AVATAR:    1. Go to your profile.    2. Click on the button near the top that says EDIT INFO.    3. You should see three boxes. All the way to the right, there should be a box that says "Use my Yahoo! Avatar", and then right beneath a button that says "Edit My Yahoo! Avatar".     4. Click it.    5. It will take you to the link.    OR...    Just type in avatars.yahoo.com in the search bar at the top of your webpage. Make sure you're logged on. =)    PICTURE AVATAR:    You have to activate your 360 profile. To do that, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click on the button that says "My 360 profile" in blue letters. It is to the right of your ID. Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile. It will take a short period of time for the picture to process, so be patient. Hope this helped!

AA10025824	It's not perfect, but the system works sort of like an honor thing.   If more than one reputable user reports a question it's deleted, but if someone goes around reporting things for no reason, or for the wrong reason their status gets weaker and reports get ignored.    So there really isn't a reliable system, but it works okay.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	If people would read the Community Guidelines and Terms of Service before posting a "fair and honest" question, they would know they are in violation and then YA has the right to delete.|`|zDQIPFH2aa	Deletion is not fair and honest except for the honor of the users.  Some users will have no honor but they are the small minority.  Permanent deletions are all reviewed by YA or CC Staff if the removal is appealed

KjF0p72naa	1) they would normally send it by mail although your phone bill should already have them listed if you keep those. if they need to mail it out normal business time-ask because it depends how far you are from where it comes from    2) depends on if you bought insurance on it. you may have to buy a new one yourself. go to a local store to pick one out if thats the case and you wont have to wait.    not familiar with boost but most cell companies opperate the same way
aee448de98ace1d5f73cd00e3967350caa	They are testing a new layout of the homepage by putting a cookie on your system that automatically redirects you. When you delete your cookies, it defaults to the old layout until they replace the cookie on your system.    If you want to keep the old layout, you need to block cookies from yahoo.com. In Internet Explorer 7, click Tools, Internet Options, Privacy tab, Sites. In the address of website box, type yahoo.com then click Block. You can unblock it later by clicking the remove button. The only problem with this is that you cannot log into any yahoo services(like yahoo answers) when the cookies are blocked. Also, look for the Feedback link at the bottom of the page and tell yahoo that you don't like the new layout and you don't want to have to use this workaround.|`|0zieKCK6aa	don't know... that happens to me alot.. i like the old one better.

AA11408911	This is a glitch that can occur from time to time. Please log out of Yahoo! Answers and close your Internet browser down. You should then log back into Yahoo!

This issue has also been known to occur when your Internet browsers cookies and cache folders, these being temporary files used to help web pages load quicker, have become corrupt. As such clearing out these files can often resolve issues associated with web sites not performing correctly. To clear out your cookies and cache:    [ Firefox users ]    Click Tools -> Clear Private Data -> Tick Cache and Cookies -> Clear Private Data Now    You should then log out of Yahoo!

eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	"A "Top Contributor" is a member of the Yahoo Answers community who has shown that they are knowledgeable in a certain category. Each user can be a top contributor in a maximum three categories.  You earn it or lose it depending on your recent participation in a certain section.  The more positively you contribute, the more chance there is that you will get a TC badge. Just like featured users or category leaders, it's another way to give credit to community members."    The TC badge is awarded on the number of questions answered and best answers received by the user in a particular week, in a particular category.    It is rumoured that you need at least a 10 percent best answers in your chosen category to get a TC badge although the actual percentage and the number of answers is Yahoo's secret.   All you see and read on the subject is speculation, rumour, assumption and guesswork.    A user who is on the leader board may or may not have a TC badge, the criteria is measured on weekly participation in a particular category (number of answers and % of best answers in the category).    The easiest way to get a TC badge is to concentrate on one category where many questions are asked and hope to get some best answers.    The Polls and Surveys and Jokes and Riddles categories do not have Top Contributors.    If you have contributed enough to meet Yahoo's criteria, the orange badge will appear below your avatar on Monday morning.    It can disappear just as easily on Monday morning, if you don't keep answering questions in your chosen category.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	No-one can help but you.

Answer only quality questions with helpful, informative quality answers to give you a better chance at getting Best Answer for your answers. The exact formula isn't publicized, but it's rumored we need to answer approx. 50 questions in the one category in a 30-day period, and of those answers, get 10% best answers. You'd have to maintain that balance of Best Answers to total answers to keep the Top Contributor badge once you get it. You can be Top Contributor in up to 3 categories.

6qsTmMQaaa	To pick a best answer yourself, you have to wait four hours before the bubbles appear. The bubbles read, "Choose as Best Answer," and they appear under each answer. You click the bubble beneath the answer you like best, and then it will take you to a page, where you need to rate the response, and then leave a message to the asker. Then, you scroll down a little and click SUBMIT. The answerer will receive ten points, and you will receive three.    To put your question to vote, you can either wait for the time to expire and then vote for the best answer, or you can go to the pencil beneath your question. If you click on the pencil, three or four tabs (depending on whether you extended the expiration date or not) will pop down, and one of them will read "PUT THIS QUESTION TO VOTE." Then the question will be put to vote, and you and the Yahoo! Answers community will vote for the best answer. You will still receive three points when the question is resolved.|`|a2708e7f671d2c5308a7fca7225d05d4aa	For your question  wait 4 hours this is so other people have a chance to answer  check any new answers you get  in your messenger or email  you can also check in your questions in your profile  After 4 hours   each person who answers your question will have a blue button   choose as best answer   under them.  read each answer   choose the best answer by clicking on the button of the person  rate the answer 1 - 5 star system   1 as not helpful 5 for informative best and helpful  press okay   then you get 3 points for choosing the best answer for your question.

suPD7c3gaa	If you already have the image you want to use on your 360 page, you probably just left out a step.    After you clicked on "save" to save your image on the 360 page, you will need to set the new image as primary to use here.  To do that, click on "Edit Personal Photos" again. Click where it says "Set as Primary", then click "Save".    Then you can come back to Yahoo! Answers, and refresh any page where you avatar appears.  You should see the new avatar.

suPD7c3gaa	Upload a picture to use where on Yahoo! Answers?  As your avatar?  Or to put a pictures with a question or answers?    If you want to create an avatar using an image of your choosing rather than use the Yahoo! (cartoon avatar)    First make sure you have the photo/image file that you want to use as your avatar on your computer. (IMPORTANT!  DO NOT us an image that's tiny/avatar sized to start with.  You must use 'normal' size image files.)  Then you need to put the image you'd like to use as your avatar on your 360 page. You may already have one. If you do, you would be able to access it from your profile. Just click on your avatar (or "My Profile" on the upper right). The 360 option will be on the upper right. If not, you'd need to create one.    http://360.yahoo.com/    To be sure your image meets proper specifications:    http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...    To add a photo to 360: Go to your 360 page. Click on "My Page" that's near the top. You'll see your photos (or where they would be if you don't already have photos there) and the option to "Edit Personal Photos". Click on that, then you will see where you can add photos. Click on "Choose File" to find the image on your computer. Once you add the image, click on "Save". That'll bring you back to the group of images. If you want to set the new image as primary to use here, click on "Edit Personal Photos" again. Click where it says "Set as Primary", then click "Save.    Then to use your 360 image here for your avatar, go to your profile (Click on your avatar or click "My Profile" on the upper right of the page), the click on "Edit my info". Scroll down to where you choose what image you want to use and choose the 360 one. Then click on "preview" and "OK".    Keep in mind that sometimes, after following all the steps, the 360 image can appear right away, or can take 2-3 days... but it will eventually appear.    PUTTING LINKS TO PICTURES WITH A QUESTION  You need to put your image files on a photo storage site like:    http://photobucket.com/  http://www.shutterfly.com/  http://flickr.com/  http://tinypic.com/  http://imageshack.us/    You will be provided with a link for use in forums, emails, etc. Copy the link (beginning with http://) and paste it with your question or answer. If with a question, be sure to paste the link in the space provided for more information. Also keep in mind that if you're posting photos of yourself (or anyone else) to ask people what they think, that's considered a chat violation and often gets reported.|`|BpD01lccaa	Click on your bella.k name in blue and then click edit info and you can upload your pic.

You may access Yahoo Mail with a different browser, such as Firefox. Just type yahoo.mail.com in the address bar. I am able to get through with Firefox, and I hope you can too.    Or, you can set your cookies at the lowest possible setting, and that should work too. It bugs me to have to do this, but at least it will help you get your emails if you are browsing with Internet Explorer. You can always reset your cookies after accessing your email

C6jFigESaa	Hi,    Reggae music are awesome, especially artists such a sanchez, Bennie Man, Sean Paul and the like.   Of course there should be a Reggae category for the Island fans. However, the Staff are not in interest of adding new categories at this time.      However, your suggestion(s) are always welcome and the Staff are always keen to hear ideas from their members, so I am suggesting you now that you click on the suggestion forum link below to leave your valuable suggestions(s)    (Forum)  http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...

To do that, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click on the button that says "My 360 profile" in blue letters. It is to the right of your ID. Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile. It will take a short period of time for the picture to process, so be patient. Hope this helped!

suPD7c3gaa	You can almost immediately tell this is a reliable site. Not only is the site itself well done, but they use UPS and put their logo on the site, as well as PayPal. Those are a few clues.  If this were a bogus site, they wouldn't be able to use PayPal.    There's a test you can do ANY time you aren't sure if a sight you are considering purchasing something through (and I've done this test already for www.grandpaslowriderclothing.com).    Pick an item to order (either something you really want, or ANY item for purposes of this test).  Click "order now", then "proceed to checkout".  Once the form comes up where you'll be filling in personal and payment information, look up at the URL/address at the top of the page.  If it begins with "https://etc.", that means the site is SSL certified, and is safe to order from.  That letter "s" in the address is what's important.  Without it, your information could easily be accessed by those who are so inclined to as to be looking for sites they can steal it from.  ANY site where you fill out personal information, even if it's for a membership to a site, that "s" should be there.    The www.grandpaslowriderclothing.com site is SSL certified.  Your information is safe!
