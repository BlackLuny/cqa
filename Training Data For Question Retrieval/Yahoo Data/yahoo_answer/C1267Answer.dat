After an animal finds or makes a living space (hibernaculum) that protects it from winter weather and predators, the animal's metabolism slows dramatically, so it can "sleep away" the winter by utilizing its body's energy stores. When spring weather arrives, the animal "wakes up" and leaves its hibernaculum to get on with the business of feeding and breeding<br>  <br>  Estivation is similar to hibernation. It is a dormant state an animal assumes in response to adverse environmental conditions, in this case, the prolonged dry season of certain tropical regions.

Conductivity means the movement of electrons, which in metallic like carbon nanotubes happens freely.  The semi-conductive nanotubes will not be as conductive, unless certain conditions are met (temperature and current dependent).  Unfortunately, you cannot get pure metalic or pure semi-conductive carbon nanotubes.  Usually when they are bought or made you end up with a mixture of both types of tubes, due to the process the makes carbon nanotubes.|`|AdLLUbpzaa	electricity- electricity is the movement of electrons so its electrons.

fwdsp3dVaa	Deposition is the geological process by which material is added to a landform or land mass. Fluids such as wind and water, as well as sediment gravity flows, transport previously eroded sediment, which, at the loss of enough kinetic energy in the fluid, is deposited, building up layers of sediment.<br>  <br>  Deposition occurs when the forces responsible for sediment transportation are no longer sufficient to overcome the forces of particle weight and friction, which resist motion. Deposition can also refer to the build up of a sediment from organically derived matter or chemical processes. For example, chalk is made up partly of the microscopic calcium carbonate skeletons of marine plankton, the deposition of which has induced chemical processes (diagenesis) to deposit further calcium carbonate. Similarly, the formation of coal begins with the deposition of organic material, mainly from plants, in anaerobic conditions

P8dIznazaa	Evolution doesn't explain time or gravity; they're not even in the same ballpark, as you suspected.  Evolution is the study of how life forms change over time--obviously it takes place within the frame of time and gravity, but only in the same way that anything else does.<br>  <br>  Gravity is very strange stuff.  I have a vague familiarity with the physics of it.  (This is all as best I recall:)  Apparently gravity comes in waves, similar to light waves.  But gravity is also a particle.  (At the subatomic level, the line between waves and particles blurs and eventually disappears.)  Subatomic particles have something called "spin", which is how much you have to turn a particle around before it looks the same way it did before you started turning it.  Spin 1 means you have to turn it all the way around.  Spin ? means it looks the same from either side, so you only have to turn it halfway around.  Spin 2 means (weirdly) that you have to turn it twice for it to look the same.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the physics lesson, but: apparently ordinary matter is spin ? IIRC.  Gravity particles have a different spin.  It's weird, but apparently that's the fundamental point of difference between them at that level, and everything about them diverges from there.<br>  <br>  As for how these things came to be: it's thought that a lot (possibly all) of the laws of physics settled out shortly after the Big Bang, when the temperature cooled from a billion billion degrees and atoms could take shape.  There's a lot of debate over how much of physics is in a sense "hard-coded" into reality versus how much of it was changeable in the very very early universe (that is, when it was much less than a second old).|`|53e825bd7214ff8635097f3a354c0738aa	Time is what stops everything happening at once, and gravity keeps stuff where you left it. Simple really.
P8dIznazaa	Given the sheer size of the universe it seems highly unlikely that there is no life outside of Earth.  My guess is that life is reasonably plentiful in the cosmos.  By that I mean we might have a good chance of finding another life-bearing planet within 50 light-years or so.<br>  <br>  Intelligent life is a bit different.  No one really knows, of course, if sentience is a freak occurrence or if it's just rare among species.  Assuming it's simply rare, I'd expect we might find another intelligent species somewhere within 1000 light-years, but not close to home.<br>  <br>  I DON'T think we're being visited by aliens though.  No one's found any solid evidence for it.  What we've seen is grainy pictures (many of which are proved hoaxes) and eyewitness accounts, which are notoriously unreliable.  And it's no surprise--space travel is enormously difficult.  At our current level of technology, we could, if we really really wanted, send a probe to our nearest star (4.3 ly), but it would take a century to get there.  Imagine the difficulty of traveling *hundreds* of light-years.  Would a species go to extraordinary efforts to journey over that distance without even making real contact with the inhabitants--and do it again and again?|`|sJegUB11aa	As the others have said, the sheer probability of life on other planets is extremely high because of the number of stars and galaxies in the universe.<br>  <br>  However, intelligent life is far more rare.  That's an easy one to know, based on Earth's life history.  We must not forget that on Earth, there was life for over 3 billion years with no intelligent life.<br>  <br>  I am extremely doubtful that any aliens have ever visited Earth.  Distances between stars are too large.  Even if they did, because of the above, it was most likely when there was no intelligent life here.  Imagine them visiting here a billion years ago.  The only life would've been in the oceans, and would've been not much more than scum.|`|nuhi9H6paa	Although hard evidence for this has not yet been found, most cosmologists tend to believe that some form of life is bound to exist somewhere in the universe. This belief rests on the fact that there are billions of galaxies in the observable universe. There remains a very significant possibility of life existing somewhere else. The exact form of life that can exist is a matter of speculation – it need not be carbon and oxygen-based like it is on earth. Moreover, these life forms may or may not have evolved intelligence, as we know it.<br>  <br>  Aliens need not look like us to resemble us in more fundamental ways. Consider that the four most common elements in the Universe are hydrogen, helium, carbon, and oxygen. Helium is inert. The three most abundant, chemically active ingredients in the cosmos are also the top three ingredients in life on Earth. For this reason, you can bet that if life is found on another planet, it will be made of a similar mix of elements. <br>  Conversely, if life on Earth were composed primarily of, for example, molybdenum, bismuth, and plutonium, then we would have excellent reason to suspect that we were something special in the Universe<br>  <br>  Any beings capable of bridging the vast distances between the stars would be able to clean our clock when it comes to science and engineering. Visitors from other worlds – should any appear – would be enormously ahead of us from a technological viewpoint|`|2vRXS29iaa	yes, because if we exist then other beings must exist out there somewhere. I think it's a little naive and conceited to think that we are the only ones when there are three other quadrants of space that extend for a hundred thousand light years.|`|V8r1RTKfaa	I do. The universe is larger than we could possibly imagine, some say it might be infinite. The probability of us being the only life of any form in the WHOLE universe is almost nothing.<br>  <br>  So, yes, i do believe there is life out their (somewhere)! :)|`|qPxzrgnDaa	I don't believe in aliens beyond earth and in space because scientists have done a lot of research and they haven't even found a tinsy little living bacteria so it wouldn't be smart to think there are aliens living in outer space.|`|AA11564934	yes, simple probability.

VLT2VgP9aa	The group "axioms" are sort of a misnomer.  Axioms are something that you are free to assume without proof, but the group "axioms" have to be demonstrated.  So, you don't just get to assume this is associative.  True, if it is a group, the associativity property holds, but we haven't proven this is a group yet, so you don't get to assume anything.<br>  <br>  To show that associativity holds here, you have to remember what multiplication modulo 7 means.  It's equivalent to multiplying the integers (ab)c and reducing that mod 7.  However, since multiplication of integers is associative, then (ab)c = a(bc), so reducing either of those mod 7 will give you the same result, regardless of what a,b, and c are.  Bear in mind that you'll need to formalize this argument, but that's basically the logic behind it.|`|oVhCsER9aa	Isn't associativity, even in groups, an axiom?

The general reaction is:<br>  <br>  R - OH + R' - CO2H -> R - CO2 - R' + H2O<br>  <br>  In this reaction the carboxylic acid is acetic acid and the alcohol is n - propanol (as distinguished from isopropanol). <br>  <br>  According to the chemical reaction, the molar ratios are all 1 to 1 meaning 0.60 moles of ester requires 0.60 moles of the acid and the alcohol. The propanol is usually 100% pure, so use the molecular weight to find out the mass needed for 0.6 moles. The acetic acid is not going to be 100% pure. The most concentrated form is glacial acetic acid, so check the concentration and use this to figure the amount from the molecular weight. One final thing to take into account is that hardly any organic reaction gives 100% recovery. Figure an 80% recovery and divide everything by 0.8 to account for losses during the reaction.

I managed it 3 times and it was a truly unforgettable experience. I was able to drift up to the ceiling and across the room but whenever I tried to look at myself I would drop back (forcibly, like waking from falling dreams) into my body. I guess it was my subconscious and the fear of seeing myself lying on my bed. I stopped doing the exercises due to other things happening in my life and it's not happened since but supposedly, once you master it you can go anywhere you choose and see things that you could never see in the physical.<br>  <br>  I'm planning to take it up again soon so hopefully I'll get a lot further than my bedroom in future.|`|CSV50KHKaa	I haven't had one personally but my dad has. When my dad was really young about 7 his appendix had burst. His parents were really neglectful and didn't pay any attention to the fact that he was sick. My dad can remember being in a lot of pain at that time but feeling helpless. One day his older brother who wasn't living at home came home and found him lying on the couch. According to my uncle my father was unresponsive and he believed that he had died. He got my father medical attention upon the doctors going in to remove his appendix they found that it had been burst for about a week. He had gangreen and it turned septic. The thing is my father remembers watching himself as the doctors removed his appendix. He remember not being scared and feeling as though there was someone there to comfort him. He went into a coma for 2 months after his surgery and he remembers sporadically throughout that time being able to watch himself and people go in and out of the room but realized he would be unable to talk to them.

There was a loud 'Clap'. The next thing I felt was absolutely wonderful. Basically indescribable but what I can tell you is that I had the sensation of being wrapped in a warm blanket, smelling honeysuckle and the most amazing sense of being loved. All at the same time. I didn't see Buddha, Mohamed, Moses or Jesus Christ(That would've been awesome but I wonder why I didn't see Jesus Christ, per my understanding of Near Death Experiences) but my faith leads me to believe that the love was God's love.

But, when I was little I had a lot of headaches and got sick a whole lot. One time it went too far. I wasn't exactly dead but seemed I was on the border of it. My dad was used to me being sick and stopped calling the doctor. But I was alone one night-my dad went to the neighbors for awhile-and I had gone to bed. I wasn't asleep yet, and of course I was sick. Then, I felt kind of lifted and better. It was kind of like I was dead, but my body was still breathing. I didn't go anywhere. I just, I saw someone. A lady, that's all I remember for whom it was. Then all of a sudden I realized a lot of things I shouldn't have at the age in life. The lady explained some different outlooks on my life and then I was back in my body. Ever since then I haven't got as sick but I still have my headaches.

KUVRekuZaa	Any sort of rock, if subjected to lots of pressure and high temperature will become a metamorphic rock - it is not just a matter of the particles being squashed together, given enough pressure the types of minerals change just due to the pressure so both igneous rock and sedimentary rock can change into metamorphic rock.<br>  Igneous rock, and metamorphic rock too can also change into sedimentary rock - in this case it breaks down due to weathering and erosion into small fragments. If enough fragments of sand, or silt accumulate then all these fragments can get cemented together to form a sedimentary rock.<br>  <br>  If any type of rock is heated enough (deep within the earth) it will melt and form 'magma' - if this then cools ( it does not need to get thrown out as a volcano, as another poster incorrectly said, as it can cool below the Earth's surface) then the magma solidifys ( crystalises) and forms an igneous rock (and not all igneous rocks are grey, you can get pink granite for example)<br>  <br>  Look for some diagrams illustrating the "Rock Cycle" - this should make it easier to understand|`|lJ2XG0QMaa	Rocks rock.

N2LEfPC5aa	To have a comprehensive testing procedure, you need a comprehensive specification. How close to 12V must it be, maybe 11.5 to 12.5V? What environment must it work in, 0 to 50C? What level of noise is acceptable,+/-0.05V? What surge current must it handle and for how long, 3A for 1 sec? What range of input voltage must it handle, e.g. 17-19V or much wider? What sudden change in current must it handle, +/-1A? Does it need to be short-circuit protected? And many more...<br>  <br>  Then test the system for each of these requirements, e.g. put a 6 ohm 24W resistor on the load, measure the current to make sure it is 2A and check it can still provide the full12V. Put and higher resistor on and check the voltage isn't too high.

Now many of these rocks were formed by deposition from water-born sediments and those processes are not happening in those places now so we know that they are likely to have been one deposit which then became separated.  There are many places on earth where this has taken place and we also know that there have been geologic displacements, where the deposits that were made in horizontal layers have been tilted up and down, so that we know that there has been movement in the past.  With the discovery of things like the North Atlantic Ridge, where there is new sea floor being extruded, we understand the mechanism that takes place.  And all these deposits now make sense.|`|bcEHGegjaa	i dont know...<br>  i just need points.<br>  sorry dude. or dudette, whatverr

Gnfc4wRlaa	The most visible evidence of how dry the 1930s became was the dust storm. Tons of topsoil were blown off barren fields and carried in storm clouds for hundreds of miles. Technically, the driest region of the Plains – southeastern Colorado, southwest Kansas and the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas – became known as the Dust Bowl, and many dust storms started there. But the entire region, and eventually the entire country, was affected.<br>  The Dust Bowl got its name after Black Sunday, April 14, 1935. More and more dust storms had been blowing up in the years leading up to that day. In 1932, 14 dust storms were recorded on the Plains. In 1933, there were 38 storms. By 1934, it was estimated that 100 million acres of farmland had lost all or most of the topsoil to the winds. By April 1935, there had been weeks of dust storms, but the cloud that appeared on the horizon that Sunday was the worst. Winds were clocked at 60 mph. Then it hit.<br>  "The impact is like a shovelful of fine sand flung against the face," Avis D. Carlson wrote in a New Republic article. "People caught in their own yards grope for the doorstep. Cars come to a standstill, for no light in the world can penetrate that swirling murk... We live with the dust, eat it, sleep with it, watch it strip us of possessions and the hope of possessions. It is becoming Real."<br>  The day after Black Sunday, an Associated Press reporter used the term "Dust Bowl" for the first time. "Three little words achingly familiar on the Western farmer's tongue, rule life in the dust bowl of the continent – if it rains." The term stuck and was used by radio reporters and writers, in private letters and public speeches.<br>  In the central and northern plains, dust was everywhere.<br>  <br>  The impact of the Dust Bowl was felt all over the U.S. During the same April as Black Sunday, 1935, one of FDR's advisors, Hugh Hammond Bennett, was in Washington D.C. on his way to testify before Congress about the need for soil conservation legislation. A dust storm arrived in Washington all the way from the Great Plains. As a dusty gloom spread over the nation's capital and blotted out the sun, Bennett explained, "This, gentlemen, is what I have been talking about." Congress passed the Soil Conservation Act that same year.<br>  <br>  The Dust Bowl of the 1930s lasted about a decade. Its primary area of impact was on the southern Plains. The northern Plains were not so badly affected, but nonetheless, the drought, windblown dust and agricultural decline were no strangers to the north. In fact the agricultural devastation helped to lengthen the Depression whose effects were felt worldwide. <br>  <br>  Poor agricultural practices and years of sustained drought caused the Dust Bowl. Plains grasslands had been deeply plowed and planted to wheat. During the years when there was adequate rainfall, the land produced bountiful crops. But as the droughts of the early 1930s deepened, the farmers kept plowing and planting and nothing would grow. The ground cover that held the soil in place was gone. The Plains winds whipped across the fields raising billowing clouds of dust to the skys. The skies could darken for days, and even the most well sealed homes could have a thick layer of dust on furniture. In some places the dust would drift like snow, covering farmsteads.<br>  <br>  Timeline of The Dust Bowl<br>  <br>  1931<br>  Severe drought hits the midwestern and southern plains. As the crops die, the 'black blizzards" begin. Dust from the over-plowed and over-grazed land begins to blow. <br>  <br>  1932<br>  The number of dust storms is increasing. Fourteen are reported this year; next year there will be 38.<br>  <br>  1933<br>  March: When Franklin Roosevelt takes office, the country is in desperate straits. He took quick steps to declare a four-day bank holiday, during which time Congress came up with the Emergency Banking Act of 1933, which stabilized the banking industry.<br>  <br>  May: The Emergency Farm Mortgage Act allots $200 million for refinancing mortgages to help farmers facing foreclosure. The Farm Credit Act of 1933 established a local bank and set up local credit associations.<br>  <br>  September: Over 6 million young pigs are slaughtered to stabilize prices With most of the meat going to waste, public outcry led to the creation, in October, of the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation. The FSRC diverted agricultural commodities to relief organizations. Apples, beans, canned beef, flour and pork products were distributed through local relief channels. Cotton goods were eventually included to clothe the needy as well.<br>  <br>  October: In California's San Joaquin Valley, where many farmers fleeing the plains have gone, seeking migrant farm work, the largest agricultural strike in America's history begins. <br>  <br>  1934<br>  May: Great dust storms spread from the Dust Bowl area. The drought is the worst ever in U.S. history, covering more than 75 percent of the country and affecting 27 states severely.<br>  June: The Frazier-Lemke Farm Bankruptcy Act is approved.

But height can also be affected by environment. A person living in poor conditions with inadequate food supply and substandard medical help is not going to reach their full height potential. Height is 90% heritable and usually a shorter mother indicates a shorter son and a taller father indicates a taller daughter. <br>  The average height in the United States has been stagnant since the 1950s, largely due to the fact that our standard of living has improved as much as the environmental factors can that impact height. Looking at just the genetic components, it seems like people would get taller as time progresses, but this just doesn't seem to be true. It seems that more the reason people weren't taller a century ago was due to the environmental conditions that impacted their potential height and not a change in the genes they passes on. In other words, if they had proper nutrition they would have been taller. In fact, archeological and anthropological research shows that people in societies and cultures that had adequate supplies of food in their culture were the same height as people of today.|`|YxQRC8q0aa	I am not sure if this is not biological, but I think has more to do with the fact that in past times people weren't as well nourished; my dad biologically should be 6 ft, but hes only 5'8.

2lQ8DJAcaa	If genetic modifications are successful at enhancing crop yields due to fewer losses due pests and disease, then the amount of land required to produce the same amount of crop for comsumption will be smaller. This means that a plot of land set aside for farming can increase its productivity without growing in size and further intruding into the surrounding wilderness.<br>  <br>  In the US, farmers spray 970 million tons of insecticides and herbicides on their crops every year. These chemicals often remain on the crops and in the soil, and eventually contaminate locate surface and groundwaters, where they may enter the diet of local wildlife, and bioaccumulate.<br>  <br>  A crop genetically engineered with the ability to resists pests reduces the need to spray crops. In 1999, the EPA estimates that farmers using GM cotton were able to spray one to two times rather than eight to ten. The genetic elements in the plants that resist pests cannot contaminate the environment, unlike runoff from a sprayed field. The potential here is to virutally eliminate the chemical spraying of fields.
M1D4iAuWaa	Google phototaxis that is what the phenomenon is called.<br>  <br>  There is no one reason why bugs are attracted to light. All of the following are possible.<br>  <br>  1) Bugs use light to navigate. The moon is a very long way from us by normal standards and the light rays which reach the earth are virtually parallel. By flying at a constant angle to these rays it is possible over a short period of time to fly in a straight line. When an insect is close to a lamp the rays are not parallel, but divergent. The effect of keeping the rays at a constant angle will be to fly round the light source.<br>  <br>  2) Many bugs see ultraviolet light and may be attracted to flowers at night which reflect ultraviolet patterns using moonlight. Lights which emit UV rays may therefore attract such insects.<br>  <br>  3) Both or one of the above reasons are often given by entomologists to explain the attraction to light. It is also possible, although I have never seen research on this, that bugs are attracted to the heat of the light source.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://animals.howstuffworks.com/insects/question675.htm" rel="nofollow">http://animals.howstuffworks.com/insects...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/science_for_kids/11252" rel="nofollow">http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/scie...</a>|`|tLnmdOW2aa	Some bugs use the Sun's light to help them fly in a straight line.

aLjniuZCaa	To change factored form to expanded form for (a + b)(c + d), you have to multiply each of the elements in one factor with each of the elements in the other factor and add them together: ac + ad + bc + bd.<br>  <br>  In the example you give, (3 + 2)(x - 1), this gives 3x - 3 + 2x - 2 = 5x - 5. (In this case, you can easily see that 3 + 2 = 5, so you could start by rewriting the problem as 5(x - 1) and then distribute the 5.)<br>  <br>  Changing expanded form into factored form is basically the same in reverse. It gets easier to see how to divide the values with practice. For an example, consider x^2 + 4x + 3. The first element, x^2, is the product of x and x. The third element, 3, is the product of 3 and 1. Things get a little trickier with the second element--it is obviously the product of 4 and x, but we need to remember that the 4 comes from summing other elements: 3 and 1. So, we have figured out that the elements are x, x, 3, and 1 and we need to put them together: (x + 3)(x + 1).<br>  <br>  Confirm that we did it correctly by reworking that factor into expanded form: x*x + 1x + 3x + 3*1 = x^2 + x + 3x + 3 = x^2 + 4x + 3. Success!<br>  <br>  The plus and minus signs are considered in the multiplication. Using the same example as above, if the first factor were (x - 3) instead, the expanded form would be (x - 3)(x + 1) = x*x + 1x + (-3)x + (-3)*1 = x^2 + x - 3x - 3 = x^2 - 2x - 3.<br>  <br>  If we were given just that last, expanded form and asked for the factored form, we'd look at the last element, -3, to determine that two of the elements must be 3 and 1 (the divisors of -3), and that one of those must be negative. Since they sum to the numerical value of the second element, -2x, we know the elements can't be +3 and -1, which sum to +2; they must be -3 and +1, which sum to -2.<br>  <br>  These kinds of factorizations seem really confusing when you first encounter them, but they get a LOT easier as you practice.

WRyHOEjSaa	My take is that they have introduced a mutation into the bacteria that allows the bacteria to grow lots of polysaccharides on their cell walls through a process of fermentation. That allows additional such polysaccharides to be harvested and combined with special proteins for use as a vaccine. The polysaccharide/protein complex molecules are injected into a patient, whose immune system is stimulated to illiminate the invader. The immune system thereafter remains primed to respond to those polysaccharides, so if the actual bacterium invades the host later, the immune system immediately leaps into action because it recognizes the polysaccharides on the cell wall of the bacterium.

GqHFDIJeaa	To answer your question. Chickens in the wild eat mainly grass, but as for domestic chickens, they eat grains, seeds, fruit, insects and other vegetation. Ken R|`|M1D4iAuWaa	In their natural setting (like a wild bird) the number one food of a chicken is grass. Second will be bugs that eat grass or bugs that eat other bugs. Third will be anything else including mice and other small critters dead or alive. Everything is fair game for a chicken including grubs and worms. Overall a chicken will eat anything that is edible. Notice that the cured seeds of grasses (such as corn, wheat, rye, oats, etc.) are not a normal staple for chickens. That's because those "foods" are seasonal and only readily available in quantity if man raises them, harvests them, stores them, and then hands them out throughout the year. Man invented grain farming and grain as a food source. Consequently grain is an inappropriate food for all animal life – including people. <br>  Chickens on commercial farms eat commercial chicken feed which is a mixture of grains (mostly corn) and protein feeds. However, for better tasting, nutritionally superior eggs plus happier chickens, chickens should only eat their natural foods and run loose in grassy fields.|`|uKyfRzxIaa	chicken feed. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  corn kernel stuff. no one knows what's in chicken feed,|`|TL1Jkqunaa	CHickens eat grains, wheat, corn, rye and others.  They will also eat them prepared, bread, crackers, chips.  They also eat insects and worms.  They are efficient scavengers and will peck apart and eat meat.

Left to their own they will find a way to eat something in almost any spot that is not too cold for them.  They also eat waste in a large variety.  In this they are a bit like pigs.  Chickens will even eat each other unless they have an easier to eat source of food.|`|aJRP6WWYaa	Grain, bugs, seeds, plants, table scraps. You name it and a chicken will eat it.

2lQ8DJAcaa	To explain this, Einstein envisioned gravity as being caused by a curvature of space. In fact, his general theory of relativity describes gravity entirely in terms of the geometry of both space and time. Far from a source of gravity, like a planet or a star, space is "flat" and clocks tick at their normal rate. Closer to a source of gravity, however, clocks slow down and space is curved.|`|403a9814784d30c5279c74857501be15aa	It's because space and time are not really separate from each other but are part of the same thing (spacetime).

ZiY6hLSsaa	One reason is quantum confinement.  As the size of a piece of "stuff" is reduced, the energy levels that its electrons are permitted to inhabit become more widely separated.

GeFLSAFeaa	Yes. You actually have to look no farther than the two polar regions to determine this. At the north pole, during the northern hemisphere summer, the polar region can experience periods of sunlight that last 24 hours a day whereas in the winter, the opposite of 24 hours of darkness occurs. The same goes for the south pole in the southern hemisphere winter (24 hours of darkness at times) and summer (24 hours of light at times).<br>  <br>  The reason for this is that as the earth orbits the sun, the angle at which the sunlight strikes the earth changes. During the summer, this angle is smaller giving more direct light, and in the winter it is larger giving more indirect light. In regions of greater angle with respect to the sun, they spend less time in a favorable angle to receive sunlight whereas the more direct regions spend a larger amount of time in a favorable angle to receive sunlight.<br>  <br>  This is also the reason for why longer days occur in the summer and shorter days occur in the winter.

KHSOVxViaa	It's due to the way the solar system formed.<br>  <br>  As the core of the proto-sun was collapsing under its own gravity, it generated quite a bit of thermal energy.  This early solar wind tended to push outwards all the particles surrounding the core.  This 'push' and gravity worked against each other; closer in, gravity was stronger and particles continued to collapse to the centre, while further out, gravity was weaker and particles were pushed outwards..<br>  <br>  Lighter particles, such as hydrogen and helium, were much more affected by this solar wind than the heavier ones, such as iron and silicon.  The result was that the inner solar system was left with only small amounts of lighter elements compared to heavier, while further out there was a much greater quantity of gaseous particles.<br>  <br>  As the planets were forming from localised clumps, they began to sweep up the available particles along the circumference of their orbits.  Near to the sun, these orbits have a small circumference, while further out they are much greater.<br>  <br>  Hence the inner solar system has some small rocky planets, while further out are the gas giants, having swept up enormous amounts of the lighter elements.|`|VS0PuI5paa	Somehow the inner planets lost their hydrogen and helium and retained the heaver but rarer elements like carbon, silicon, oxygen, and iron.  Jupiter is also believed to have a rocky core similar in size and composition to the earth, but kept its hydrogen and helium which is far more abundant.  Mostly likely the T-Tauri solar wind kicked in befrore the inner planets were finished forming, blowing the lighter elements away.

8Y7LQ6TGaa	Mineral water is water containing minerals or other dissolved substances that alter its taste or give it therapeutic value. Salts, sulfur compounds, and gases are among the substances that can be dissolved in the water. Mineral water can often be effervescent. Mineral water can be prepared or can occur naturally.<br>  <br>  Traditionally mineral waters would be used or consumed at their source, often referred to as taking the waters or taking the cure, and such sites were referred to as spas, baths or wells. Spa would be used when the water was consumed and bathed in, bath when the water was not generally consumed, and well when the water was not generally bathed in. Often an active tourist centre would grow up around a mineral water site (even in ancient times; see Bath). Such tourist development resulted in spa towns and hydropathic hotels (often shortened to Hydros).<br>  <br>  In modern times, it is far more common for mineral waters to be bottled at source for distributed consumption. Travelling to the mineral water site for direct access to the water is now uncommon, and in many cases not possible (because of exclusive commercial ownership rights). There are over 3000 brands of mineral water commercially available worldwide.<br>  <br>  The U.S. FDA classifies mineral water as water containing at least 250 parts per million total dissolved solids (TDS), and is also water coming from a source tapped at one or more bore holes or spring, originating from a geologically and physically protected underground water source. No minerals may be added to this water.<br>  <br>  .
asaeVSehaa	You pick up or lose extra electrons because the stuff you're made of has a different pull on electrons than the stuff you touch.  Normally, this is a matter of shoes on carpet or shirt on chairback, but if you haven't changed any of those things, perhaps your body chemistry has changed subtly so that you sweat a lot less.  Evaporated sweat tends to carry away excess charge, and if you're dryer then the charge you do accumulate may stick around until you find a good target, rather than bleeding away into the air.
AA11058044	Depends on the type of bird.<br>  <br>  Swallows, swifts and martins eat small flying insects, including flies, moths, mosquitoes, midges, gnats and even up to dragonflies if they can.  They swoop through the air and snatch flying insects, particularly going for ones that gather in swarms.  They would almost never eat a worm.<br>  <br>  Flycatchers are similar, but perch on a branch and zip out to snag flying insects, and then go back to their perch.  They mostly go for medium sized flying insects - rather than swooping through swarms of gnats, or wrastling with big dragonflies or butterflies.<br>  <br>  Birds like robins will glean along the ground, picking up beetles, grubs, caterpillars, spiders, worms, and other creepy crawlies.

AA11657356	Based on your analysis, the lavender phenotype is dominant over the white. Simply put, out of the 3 possible genotypes, Ll and LL would result in lavender flowers and ll in white. To guarantee only lavender you would want to breed only truebreeding lavender plants (those with the LL genotype). To determine which are LL you could either self breed them once again and if all offspring are lavender, then the plant is LL. You could also breed a lavender flower with a white. If only lavender offspring are produced then your parent lavender plant is LL.

The planet is named after Venus, the Roman goddess of love. It is the brightest natural object in the night sky, except for the Moon, reaching an apparent magnitude of ?4.6. Because Venus is an inferior planet from Earth, it never appears to venture far from the Sun: its elongation reaches a maximum of 47.8°. Venus reaches its maximum brightness shortly before sunrise or shortly after sunset, for which reason it is often called the Morning Star or the Evening Star.<br>  <br>  Classified as a terrestrial planet, it is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet," because they are similar in size, gravity, and bulk composition. Venus is covered with an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light; this was a subject of great speculation until some of its secrets were revealed by planetary science in the twentieth century. Venus has the densest atmosphere of all the terrestrial planets, consisting mostly of carbon dioxide, as it has no carbon cycle to lock carbon back into rocks and surface features, nor organic life to absorb it in biomass. It has become so hot that the earth-like oceans that the young Venus is believed to have possessed[7] have totally evaporated, leaving a dusty dry desertscape with many slab-like rocks. The best hypothesis is that the evaporated water has dissociated, and with the lack of a planetary magnetic field, the hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind.[8] The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is 92 times that of the Earth.|`|WpgEqGrvaa	My dad is all astronomy loving and used to make us watch all the satellites, you can see them moving quite fast compared to the stars.

MMUGLjsPaa	Aristarchus of Samos (3rd century B.C.) and Seleucus of Seleucia (190 BC) both postulated the idea of Heliocentrism this was supported by the Pythagorean school because it solved the question of retrograde motion (planets appear to move backwards in the night sky) and made the movements of the planets much easier to predict. There is also some indication that ancient peoples of India also understood and embraced the idea of a heliocentric solar system (see the Vedic Texts)<br>  <br>  .  Ptolemy was well aware of the Heliocentric model but chose to promote the geocentric one because he (see the  Almagest) didn't like accepting a theory purely because it solved a mathematical problem (an of course HE was PTOLEMY!).<br>  <br>  1600 years later Nicolaus Copernicus was the first westerner to promote the theory (Commentariolus 1533) supported later by Johannes Kepler (Mysterium Cosmographicum 1595).<br>  <br>  Copernicus is your closest answer.|`|3f49d1173ab44657705ae3106bb11dc6aa	In astronomy, heliocentrism is the theory that the Sun is at the center of the Solar System. Historically, heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which placed the earth at the center. (The distinction between the Solar System and the Universe was not clear until modern times, but extremely important relative to the controversy over cosmology and religion).In the 5th century, the Greek Philosopher Philolaus, of the Pythagorean school, speculated that the Earth revolved once per siderial day around a central fire (different from the Sun). The Greek Aristarchus of Samos, in the 3rd century BC, was the first known person to speculate that the Earth revolved around a stationary sun, although this teaching was also considered Pythagorean[by whom?]. It was not until 1,800 years later, however, in the 16th century, that the Polish mathematician and astronomer Copernicus presented a fully predictive mathematical model of a heliocentric system, which was later elaborated and expanded by Johannes Kepler.|`|FT4mVJMzaa	Aristarchus.|`|4pw41geQaa	Nicolas Copernicus (But his theory was wrong a bit he said that other planets revolve around the sun right, but not in elliptic but in circle instead actually it need to be elliptic, but don't worry Kepler going to change that *-* )|`|1Ad7jJgwaa	Copernicus created the first outline of everything orbiting the Sun.

fdHDdXbFaa	The number of intermolecular collisions between gas molecules in the container.<br>  <br>  Should make sense because as the container gets smaller, more collisions will take place between the sides of the container, which makes more intermolecular collisions, and pressure gets higher|`|R5sMFDRoaa	A gas is a bunch of particles, moving around rather quickly. The pressure against the container occurs when the particles repeatedly bounce against the inside of the container. These impacts exert a force against the container, causing pressure. That's why the more gas (i.e. particles) inside a container there is, the more pressure is measured. There are more particles colliding against the container repeatedly, transferring more energy.

These two would cancel each other out, with no change in total angular momentum.|`|JsGFx5zmaa	With enough energy it is indeed possible to change the characteristic of the Earth's rotation.

clrDBOtEaa	If by "genome number" you mean the total number of genes... the number is unclear partly because it's not always clear where (on a strand of DNA) a gene begins and ends.  Genes can overlap; and there are some sequences that look like genes, but may not actually be transcribed. So even if we know the full sequence of the DNA, we might not know where all the genes are, or how many.<br>  <br>  Also, genes often come in several separate pieces ("exons") which are spliced together when they're being transcribed. Sometimes these pieces are put together in more than one way, so we can have more than one "splice variant" of a gene.  Do you count them as one gene, or many?  Depending on how you answer, the number changes a lot.|`|R4KqEJekaa	because They can not counted the genome   they are stupid to understand
AA10335036	Some part of each ripple in the elongated reflection is reflecting the moon's light to you. Suppose you're 30 degrees above the center area (no-ripple reflection area), and thus the moon is also 30 degrees above it. In the closer half of the elongated reflection, you are >30 degrees above that area, so a horizontal surface would reflect moonlight below you. Instead, the part of the surface that reflects moonlight toward you must be slightly tilted away from you. The ripples have a continuously curved reflecting surface, so some part of each ripple will reflect toward you as long as the required surface tilt is not greater than the maximum slope of the ripple. Note this part of the ripple is on the far side of each ripple, so another condition is that the peak of the ripple must not block the reflection. It's similar on the far side of the center area except now the reflections come ripple areas that tilt toward you (the near sides of the ripples), so blockage isn't a problem.

4Jy8Hioiaa	That is a good question. I am glad you want to learn more math. If you are in algebra now, which one is it? Beginning, Intermediate, college? I would say take all of the algebra classes you can. The order I would take them is:<br>  Geometry<br>  Algebra I,II,III<br>  Trigonometry<br>  Calc I,II,III<br>  Differential equations and so on.<br>  All math builds on itself. The further you go the more you will see this. Make sure you know what you are learning now and know it well. It will help you down the line.<br>  With that said, if you want to learn more, I would suggest two things.<br>  1. Pick up the texts. This does not have to be the texts your school is using either. You can go online and order used, out of date editions really cheap. Pick up the 5th edition instead of the new 6th. I usually buy mine at www.half.com. This is a division of e-bay.<br>  2. This may sound weird, but pick up the "Idiots guide to...." or the "..... for dummies" books. They will explain things in a very easy to understand language and terms. <br>  My game plan when I was going through it was this. I bought books on line for the subject I was interested in. If it was Trigonometry for instance, I bought an old edition Trig book on line. I then bought the Trig for dummies book. I also purchased the textbook for class. I know that sounds like a lot but this is my thinking. Text books do not always explain things in the clearest of terms. If I do not understand something, I can read the same subject in another text that might have a clearer explanation. Let's face it, mathematicians like to write text books to make themselves sound smarter by using big terms and words in complicated sentences instead of making it easy to understand and read for the student. If neither of these work, I then go to the idiots guide or the for dummies book to try and understand the concept. <br>  It has really worked well for me. I have gone far, far beyond Calculus using this redundancy method and I have a 4.0 at a private technical university. This is what has worked for me. Remember, the only way to get good at this is to run hundres of billions of equations. OK, maybe not quite that many. You can't know this stuff just by reading it. Like anything else, in order to get good at something, you must practice, practice, practice. <br>  <br>  Good luck, I wish you all the best.|`|Wagcdklxaa	I suggest you concentrate on Algebra first before thinking about the other math levels. And this is the best way for you to get started.<br>  <br>  After Algebra, you will advance to Trigonometry and after which you can proceed to Calculus.<br>  <br>  Do it one level at a time and you will be OK.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

When your body gets over heated the pores of your body open up to release vapor in a water form that carries sodium out of your system to cool it off.
uM2IZBobaa	When the sun radiates energy to the earth, the building wall will be heated gradually.  When the earth rotates, the sun moves away from directly shining on the building wall and the wall begins to cool down.  Depending on the mass of the wall, the amount of energy stored in it will vary.  The more massive the building wall, the more energy it can store, so therefore the longer it will take to discharge that energy and come to equilibrium with the air temperature.|`|O6LHQKE3aa	The concept of thermal mass is that it traps and releases heat slowly, so if it's usually cold at night, thermal mass will help by releasing some of it's heat into the house. It's important to design the thermal mass and insulation etc. so that the thermal mass can gain heat during the day, but also release most of it to the interior of the house, rather than the outside, at night. As with any other aspect of low-energy building design, it is important to match all the features (sunlight, insulation, thermal mass, etc.) and most importantly match the design to the specific climate.<br>  <br>  Thermal mass essentially acts as a buffer, and if designed correctly can keep the house at a relatively even temperature, stopping the house from heating up too much in the heat of the day, or cooling down too much at night. This is possibly less important in the tropics, where there is often a warm night-time temperature, and illustrates the importance of matching the design with the climate.

Resistivity is a property of copper and is not dependent on the thickness of the wire. Its like saying fat copper wire is orange, what is the colour of thin copper wire? Obviously still orange. And the same with resistivity.....its the same for all time, no matter the shape or whatever of the copper.

Ftkr9jqYaa	The hair SHAFT, which includes the hair cortex and medulla, extends from the papilla through the hair follicle, and may extend a considerable distance exterior to the skin.  An alternative answer is the hair MATRIX; however, the matrix generally refers to the cells that compose the hair shaft, while the hair shaft itself is the structure that extends from the papilla to the exterior.<br>  <br>  Definitions: The papilla is the very bottom portion of the hair FOLLICLE that contains the blood supply and the matrix. The MATRIX consists of cells that actually form the hair shaft.<br>  <br>  Hair papilla (def.) 1. a knoblike indentation of the bottom of the hair follicle, on which the hair bulb fits like a cap; it is derived from the corium and contains vascular loops for the nourishment of the hair root.
Ftkr9jqYaa	What's the specific location of melanin observed in heavily pigmented skin?<br>  <br>  Dermal melanin is produced by melanocytes, which are found in the stratum basale of the epidermis.  Melanocytes insert granules of melanin into specialized cellular vesicles called melanosomes. These are then transferred into the other skin cells of the human epidermis. The melanosomes in each recipient cell accumulate atop the cell nucleus, where they protect the nuclear DNA from mutations caused by the ionizing radiation of the sun's ultraviolet rays. People whose ancestors lived for long periods in the regions of the globe near the equator generally have larger quantities of eumelanin in their skins. This makes their skins brown or black and protects them against high levels of exposure to the sun, which more frequently results in melanomas in lighter skinned people.<br>  <br>  What's the differences in the type and distribution of hair on the front and back of your forearm?<br>  <br>  Of all areas of the body aside from the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, the forearm has among the least hair, as measured by follicle sizes, potential follicular reservoir, hair follicle density, percentage of follicular orifices on the skin surface and infundibular surface, and infundibular volume.  However, the "front" or medial side of the forearm is significantly less hirsute than the "back" or radial side of the forearm.<br>  <br>  How does the skin of your palm differ from that on the back of your hand?<br>  <br>  The palm, unlike the back of the hand, has no hair, nor any hair follicles.  However, the epidermis of the palm is thicker, because of the abuse it takes. Another adaptation that helps the palm handle abrasions and contusions is Rete Ridges, or Epidermal Ridges. These are projections of the Epidermis into the dermis to keep it attached against shear forces on the skin. A third adaptation is the Dermal Papillae, which are projections of the Dermal Papillary layer into the Epidermis to also provide for strength against shear forces. Both of these structures are prominent in areas of the skin that take a lot of abuse, like the palm of the hand.  In the dermis of the palm--and to a lesser extent the back of the hand--are the stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, stratum lucidum, and stratum corneum, which are only present thick skin.  Although these structures are usually present on the back of the hand, they are not as prominent as on the palm.

1cwgJ6dIaa	Energy is the byproduct of light.|`|O7rMKLEMaa	In my Fractal Foam Model of Universes, every massive particle consists of a pair or group of ethereal sheer waves orbiting one another because the sheer waves exchange momentum with dark-energy pressure waves. Since each sheer wave moves at the speed of light around its tiny orbit, the center of the orbit must move at less than the speed of light. <br>  <br>  The rest mass of the particle is determined by the orbital speed of the sheer waves relative to the center of the particle. For a neutrino, the orbital speed is less than c, so the particle's center moves at very nearly the speed of light, and therefor little of the sheer waves' energy has become mass. For more massive particles, the orbital speed is equal to c, so all of the sheer waves' energy has become mass. <br>  <br>  Accelerating a particle in a particular frame of reference involves adding energy to the individual sheer waves in that frame of reference. <br>  <br>  So, my answer is yes; everything is energy at its core.|`|1d7ba071150759756c6284bca18876c3aa	BS alert*<br>  <br>  No, what's correct to say is that everything *has* energy. Energy is a property of all observable things (one of many), like mass and momentum, but is not a thing itself. Energy is a substance that things can be "made of" only on Star Trek. The discovery of the equivalence of (properties) mass and energy has lead to the common misconception (as evidenced by my thumbs down) that matter (a substance) *is* energy. This is probably due to the colloquial use of "a mass" as sometimes referring to an object *with* mass. That, and Star Trek.<br>  <br>  *A BS alert is issued when the majority of other respondents are giving answers which are wrong or, worse yet, not even wrong.

CCeRdaoLaa	Blood is never, ever, ever blue!  The main colored component of blood is hemoglobin, which contains iron.  It's what gives blood its red color.  When it is oxygenated, it is a bright red, and when it is deoxygenated, it is a deep maroon.  It is NEVER blue.<br>  <br>  So why do the veins in your arm look blue?  It's a combination of factors.  It's the color of the vein itself, mixed with the dark color of the blood inside.  It's also due to the fact that the veins are a few millimeters under the skin - blue is the only wavelength of light with enough energy to penetrate that deep and bounce back out to see (the same way that deep water looks blue - it's the only wavelength that can get in and out without being absorbed).  It's just made worse by the schematic drawings you see in textbooks - the arteries and veins are drawn as red and blue for ease of illustration and are not true to life.<br>  <br>  If you still don't believe me, then think back to a time you gave blood (if you ever have).  If it is taken from the fingertip, it is usually a bright red, since it comes from capillaries and gets oxygenated when it hits the air.  If you've had it taken from your arm, though, it's taken directly from a vein into a vacuum tube (just a glass vial with no air inside).  The blood that comes out is a deep, dark red.  It's the same if you've donated blood - the tube contains a little air, but not nearly enough to oxygenate the blood.  The bag itself is collapsed and contains no air when you begin, so you end up with a bag of venous, deoxygenated blood... which is a dark red.|`|AA11609300	Blue.<br>  It turns red when it comes in contact with oxygen.|`|BXYK2jtyaa	Blood in your veins (except your pulmonary veins) and pulmonary arteries is blue, and blood in your arteries (except your pulmonary arteries) and pulmonary veins is red.  This has to do with the amount of oxygen in the blood; oxygen binds to iron in your hemoglobin and turns it red (the same reason rust is red); in deoxygenated blood, there is not a lot of oxygen to bind to the iron, so it is blue.|`|DpAkYZaqaa	Red.

WGSuDLcZaa	Process of muscle contractions -<br>  <br>  Muscle fiber generates tension through the action of actin and myosin cross-bridge cycling. While under tension, the muscle may lengthen, shorten or remain the same. Though the term 'contraction' implies shortening, when referring to the muscular system it means muscle fibers generating tension with the help of motor neurons (the terms twitch tension, twitch force and fiber contraction are also used).<br>  <br>  Locomotion in most animals is possible only through the repeated contraction of many muscles at the correct times. Contraction is controlled by the central nervous system (CNS), which comprises the brain and spinal cord. Voluntary muscle contractions are initiated in the brain, while the spinal cord initiates involuntary reflexes.<br>  <br>  More detail found at first reference wikipedia.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  What determines the strength of muscle contractions -<br>  <br>  A single motor neurone (nerve cell) forms synaptic connections to many individual muscle fibres and all will respond when the nerve fibre is activated. Thus, groups of muscle fibres (of the same fibre type) within a muscle are functionally united through their connection with the same motor neurone. Each group is called a motor unit. During exercise of fixed intensity some motor units drop out when fatigued but their contribution to force generation will be replaced immediately by another until all motor units have been recruited. During maximal all-out exercise, the initial full recruitment of (almost) all motor units is followed by a gradual loss of some units as fatigue ensues. The force of a maximum voluntary contraction is thus determined by how many motor units are simultaneously activated and the cross-sectional area of muscle involved. <br>  <br>  The early improvements in strength and power that come with heavy resistance training (e.g. weight training) cannot be explained in terms of changes in the size, shape or biochemistry of muscle cells. There appears to be at least two phases to the adaptation to strength training. The first is a clear gain in strength and power without any measurable changes in size of muscle or the force that can be generated during maximal electrical stimulation (i.e. when all the fibres in the muscle are fully activated and made to contract maximally). A combination of improved co-ordination and recruitment of muscle mass may be the main reasons for the early improvements in strength. The exercise mode or task specificity of the gains in strength support this explanation. Only after many weeks of training can significant increases in muscle cross- sectional area be detected. Although some studies on animal muscle have shown that strength training increases the number of fibres, there is not the same amount of evidence that this is an explanation for hypertrophy of human skeletal muscle after strength training. Rather, the increase in cross-sectional area of resistance-trained muscle in humans seems to be mostly due to an increase in the diameter of the existing muscle fibres (especially the Type 2 fibres).<br>  <br>  2.

QI74CxD0aa	It's a cultural thing.  People are skeptical about what they have been taught cannot be possible, and many have not had any direct experiences themselves.   There are all kinds of human motivations involved in responses to claims of ESP and other abilities -jealously that they haven't experienced something like that, fear about how it could be used, a bad opinion about people who do not think the way they think, religious indoctrination, etc.  <br>  I like the point that you make about the special sensory powers of other animals.|`|2636a78d1ba5f08fe4ebe0aa2e504d3daa	My short answer is: prove it.

A lot of the Universe is still a mystery to us. <br>  <br>  I don't understand why people say that ESP doesn't exist when they don't know if that is true or not. But back in the day, they would have probably have fit in with the group who made fun of Einstein and thought that his ideas were crazy.<br>  <br>  It is inevitable that the paranormal will be either explained or revealed to us in such a way that there will be no question that it is real. And I'm pretty sure the revelations and eventual understanding of such things will have a lot to do with quantum mechanics. <br>  <br>  And of course, since everyone loves to toot Randi's horn, I must remind the public that you need a media profile in order to even be considered an applicant...among other requirements. <br>  <br>  I personally think that Randi is full of sh*t, on a gut level, I can't stand the man and I bet that he will never part with his money...unless he is sued for it. <br>  <br>  The man is a magician. How ironic is it that the skeptics are falling for his illusions?|`|3Y8QkaMUaa	I've said it before here and I'll say it again, WHO CARES what they think. They have an evolutionary disadvantage.  The CIA has been using this stuff for quite some time and they want the public to be closed down to it (I DARE a skeptic to pay a visit to the Monroe Institute).  <br>  <br>  However a lot of stuff is opening up and much of their protest is just a reaction to the fact that even astronauts like Edgar Michell have said aliens are real.

There have been controlled experiments to disprove ESP; no experiments that make it seem real.<br>  <br>  The problem is that these "psychic" people only report the results favoring them, but probably never report the results that dis-prove them. As soon as ONE coincidence appears people are like YOU SEE IT'S TRUE! But they do take into account the 95% failure rate.<br>  <br>  And about the other species. This is how they evolved in order to survive. Bats need to detect the high level frequencies because eyes are useless in the caves. Dolphins need to transmit sound waves because it's the only way they can talk. <br>  <br>  But you did not mention that bats have basically no eyes so they cannot see. Dolphins can only swim, while humans can do both. Once again this notion of COINCIDENCE=MIRACLE by you.<br>  <br>  Most of the time people tend to fall into a psychic's beliefs because the person really WANTS there to be a connection.

I can't say I blame them.|`|sQLyyCY0aa	Hi, Energy.  First, just to clarify -- the majority of the American public actually do believe in ESP -- there have been a number of surveys, and all of them show that 60% or more of the public accept the reality of "paranormal" mental powers.  However, that in itself isn't evidence such powers are real.  It takes actual evidence produced by careful scientific research to show these things do exist.  <br>  <br>  And, fortunately, that research has been done, and continues to be, despite attempts by skeptics and other critics to discourage people from doing it.  There are hundreds of peer-reviewed science journal articles documenting this research, most of them showing positive results.<br>  <br>  One of the answerers here said that there have been "controlled experiments" to disprove ESP, but no controlled experiments that support its existence.  It is actually just the opposite.  There have actually been very few controlled experiments attempted by skeptics to evaluate ESP claims, but there have been thousands of controlled experiments by parapsychologists, many of which have provided very convincing results.  Indeed, one skeptical attempt to disprove a paranormal claim ended up producing evidence that actually supported the paranormal claim -- and then the skeptics lied about and tried to hide their results.  A short account of that fiasco can be found at the Skeptical Investigations link below.  I'm also including a few links to websites that include good scientific studies that support the reality of ESP.<br>  <br>  As far as the Amazin' Randi -- don't take him too seriously.  There have been serious problems with his approach to "proof."  I include a link to an alternative view of Randi.<br>  <br>  Finally, an answer to your main question:  people who are skeptical are skeptical because ESP is contrary to the world view they favor, that there is no such thing as 'paranormal powers.'  They think that if such things were proved to be true, then it would mean that may of their beliefs are wrong -- and no one likes to have to face that.  It is a normal (if not particularly enviable) human trait.  As you can see from some of your answers not all skeptics are abusive toward such claims.  But those that are often do it out of fear that ESP really does exist.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I have just added an interesting link below on the Randi $1 million challenge.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	No one (and no animal) has psychic abilities.  People have been claiming to have them for centuries, and no one has ever been able to prove it in simple tests.  That's why people don't believe in it, and shouldn't.  Magic doesn't exist either.  You're welcome to prove either of them, but like you said - you can't.  And neither can anyone else, and that's not going to change next year.  I'm really not sure where you're getting the whole jealously thing from - psychic powers don't exist, and few people are jealous of other people's ability to accept things based on no evidence whatsoever.<br>  <br>  If someone could prove ESP exists, people would believe - they'd have to, they could see the proof.  Actually, 70% of the public doesn't 'believe' in evolution despite their being a ton of evidence, so yeah, maybe they'd bury their heads in the ground as well.|`|6rTK303aaa	The moment someone wins Randi's million I'll be a believer.

Unless you consider pointing out boasters and asking for evidence abuse.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	The whole point of Randi's challenge boils down to this:  Put up or shut up.<br>  <br>  People have claimed to have magical abilities for centuries.  If such abilities exist, why can't they be demonstrated?  It's really just that simple.  Those who are willing to be tested have been repeatedly shown to have no such abilities.<br>  <br>  Your question begs another: If your beliefs do not rely on objective evidence, then what are you NOT willing to believe?  If all that is required for something to exist is for a few people to claim it does, where do you draw your limit?<br>  <br>  If I claim to have the ability to fly unassisted I would expect your initial response to be disbelief.  Then I would expect you to say, "OK, show me."  What would you think of my flying ability if I replied, "I don't want to show you, but trust me, I can"?  When you understand how you would react to that situation you'll understand where Randi and other skeptics are coming from.|`|an1b4pXxaa	I think the opposite is true instead of there being a witch hunt society lets the practitioners of the paranormal get away with all sorts of atrocities that would never be allowed in any other industry.<br>  If you were selling any other product and gave your customer a bag of nothing instead of the bag of crackers as depicted on the label the authorities would be down on you like a ton of bricks. But anyone can hang out their shingle claiming to be a psychic or a energy healer and charge the gullible public hundreds of dollars for what is basically a box of fresh air.<br>  <br>  So maybe instead of whinging and imagining that you are persecuted you should feel grateful that most governments turn a blind eye towards psychic's silly shenanigans.|`|iUM1h6Yjaa	Your analogy is rather ironic. The ones who burned the witches in the Salem witch hunts were not the "skeptics" but were the magical thinkers who believed in witchcraft, and much more often than not the supposed witch wasn't a practitioner of witchcraft at all. So actually you have it in reverse. And nobody skeptical of ESP is proposing the harming of anyone, that I am aware of.<br>  <br>  That would be great if people developed ESP abilities. I'd be the first to cheer. I just need evidence. And I'm not fond of pseudoscience or flim-flam claims in general, except of course for the humorous aspect of it :)

Most of the mass of a galaxy is in the form of dark matter, and most of the remainder is composed of stars and gas clouds. The stars and gas in a galaxy all orbit the galaxy's center of mass, which in spiral galaxies like ours is represented by the central bulge; the mechanics of this orbital motion are the same as those which apply to the Moon and the Earth orbiting each other, the Sun and the rest of the planets orbiting each other, etc, just on a much larger scale.|`|I8yeRWw5aa	There's a supermassive black hole at the centre of most galaxies, which the rest of the galaxy orbits.

fd27fff2fa1976727431aa39a7fc9c83aa	Question 1 ) What are the products of photosynthesis?<br>  <br>  Answer 1 ) We can write the overall reaction of this process as: <br>  <br>  6H2O + 6CO2 ----------> C6H12O6+ 6O2<br>  Most of us don't chemical equations , so the above chemical equation translates as:<br>  <br>  six molecules of water plus six molecules of carbon dioxide produce one molecule of sugar plus six molecules of oxygen in the presence of light and with the help of chloroplasts . So only green plants can do it .<br>  <br>  An accurate and balanced equation is=<br>  <br>  6CO2 + 12 H2O in light and with chloroplast -> C6 H12 O6 +6O2 +6H2 O.<br>  <br>  So the product of photosynthesis are =<br>  <br>  1) Sugar = C6 H12 06<br>  <br>  2 ) Oxygen =6 O2 <br>  <br>  3 ) Water = 6 H2O <br>  <br>  In Fact, sugar is the MAIN  product and the other two are the bye products .<br>  <br>  Question 2 ) what phase are these products manufactured?<br>  <br>  Answer 2 ) These products are manufactured in TWO phases or stages <br>  <br>  Phase 1 = This is called LIGHT REACTION = AS LIGHT / SUN LIGHT IS ESSENTIAL .( This is also called Hill's reaction after its discovererRobert Hill .<br>  <br>  During this phase , the light is captured by chloropasts and converted in to a chemical energy . Water molecules are split and Oxygen ( O2 ) is realased as a bye product .<br>  <br>  <br>  Phase 2 ) = This is also called DARK REACTION = NOT BECAUSE DARKNESS IS REQUIRED BUT ONLY BECAUSE NOW LIGHT / SUN LIGHT IS NOT IN THE PICTURE AND NOT REQUIRED AS ITS FUNCTION IS OVER IN PHASE 1 .( Phase two is often called Calvin cycle after its discoverer , Malvin Calvin ><br>  <br>  During this phase Carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) molecules are linked with H2O ( water ) Molecules to form sugar ( C6 H12 O6 ) .<br>  <br>  This process requires chemical energy and that is already manufacture or formed in phase 1 .<br>  <br>  Thus the two phase follow each other like night follows day .<br>  This process of photosynthesis continues till sun shines in the sky and at night it stops completely .|`|PzhOOYUVaa	The products are sugar and oxygen.<br>  <br>  CO2 + water + photons → (CH2O)n + 02<br>  <br>  Or in words:<br>  <br>  carbon dioxide + water + energy from light  →  sugar + oxygen<br>  <br>  It is called photosyntethis because photo means light, and sugar and oxygen is being synthesized. <br>  <br>  The opposite is what humen and animals do - converting sugar and oxygen into carbon dioxide and water.

This, in turn causes electrical signals (action potentials) to go to the brain.

fwdsp3dVaa	Deposition is the geological process by which material is added to a landform or land mass. Fluids such as wind and water, as well as sediment gravity flows, transport previously eroded sediment, which, at the loss of enough kinetic energy in the fluid, is deposited, building up layers of sediment.<br>  <br>  Deposition occurs when the forces responsible for sediment transportation are no longer sufficient to overcome the forces of particle weight and friction, which resist motion. Deposition can also refer to the build up of a sediment from organically derived matter or chemical processes. For example, chalk is made up partly of the microscopic calcium carbonate skeletons of marine plankton, the deposition of which has induced chemical processes (diagenesis) to deposit further calcium carbonate. Similarly, the formation of coal begins with the deposition of organic material, mainly from plants, in anaerobic conditions.|`|vpeZTL9Laa	I think it is when rocks move to one location to another w/o energy input or something like that.

For example, a river carries a lot of mud and sand in suspension as it flows.  In slower parts of the river, like on the inside of bends, the mud and sand (sediment) sinks to the bottom and builds up.  <br>  <br>  Similarly when a river meets a lake or ocean, the sediment slows down and drops to the bottom, that is why you get deltas at the mouth of a river.<br>  <br>  Wind can also carry sediment and deposit it, like with sand dunes.|`|IoPoCIkxaa	dropping sediments.  wind or moving water eventually drop the particles they are carrying and create dunes, sand bars, or deltas.|`|UyA5Y54jaa	r u in ms. gilbert's science class?

zjpvZ5knaa	Factoring polynomials is very simple, it just takes a little practice.

GASTNilgaa	It's actually easier to solve a more general problem, to find a formula for A^k where A has first row a, b and second row 0, a.  (Putting symbols in the matrix instead of specific numbers makes it easier to notice the pattern!)  If you compute a few powers of this matrix, you find that<br>  <br>  A^2 has diagonal entry a^2 and upper-right entry 2ab<br>  A^3 has diagonal entry a^3 and upper-right entry 3a^2 b<br>  A^4 has diagonal entry a^4 and upper-right entry 4a^3 b<br>  A^5 has diagonal entry a^5 and upper-right entry 5a^4 b<br>  and now we can guess the pattern:<br>  <br>  A^n should be the matrix with first row a^n, na^{n-1} b and second row a^n.<br>  <br>  We can prove this by induction.  It's clearly true when n = 1, and if it is true for some k then<br>  <br>  A^{k+1} = A * A^k = [[a b][0 a]] * [[a^k ka^{k-1}b][0 a^k]]<br>  = [[a^{k+1}, ka^k b + a^k b][0 a^{k+1}]] = [a^{k+1}, (k+1)a^k b][0 a^k]]<br>  verifying that it is true for k+1 as well.  (Here I am writing [[x y][z t]] for the matrix with first row x, y and second row z,t.)  So it is true for all n by induction.<br>  <br>  So if a = 2 and b = 1 we have that<br>  <br>  A^k = the matrix whose diagonal entries are both 2^k, whose upper right entry is k*2^{k-1}, and whose lower-left entry is 0.

FadpfSoKaa	Flourine has 7 electrons in its outershell.  If it can gain one more electron (8e-) to become the flouride anion it is a happy molecule since its electron configuration is similar to a nobel gas.  To do this, flourine can accomodate 1 covalent bond where 2 electrons are equally shared (one from F, the other from its bonding partner).|`|1wAykHohaa	It would be 1 covalent bond. <br>  <br>  Fluorine does have 9 electrons, but only 7 are in the outer shell, the other 2 are in the inner (non-bonding) shell. So there are 7 bonding electrons, and since it only needs to gain 1 electron to get a full octet, it only needs 1 covalent bond.

SvmZlLdaaa	Antlers are naturally shed and regrown every year. If one gets broken, that particular antler will remain broken until it is shed, but after this the full antler will grow back. Whilst growing, antlers are covered in a soft skin called velvet, which carries nutrients to the developing bone. Once the antlers are fully grown, the velvet is no longer needed and dries up - the deer helps it come off by rubbing its antlers against trees and bushes. Reindeer are the only species in which females as well as males have antlers - this is thought to be an adaptation to their harsh environment. Males shed their antlers at the beginning of winter, after the rut, whilst females retain theirs throughout the winter, enabling them to compete with the larger males for food, which they need to nourish their unborn calves. They shed their antlers after calving in spring.<br>  <br>  Horns are different from antlers - they are permanent structures that are never shed, made from bone with a keratin sheath.

1Tdkb8OGaa	A type of symmetry in which any cut passing through the center of the organism divides it into matching halves.|`|FAWxOmBxaa	In nature, there are three basic kinds of symmetry: spherical, radial, or bilateral. The body plans of most multicellular organisms exhibit one of these forms. A small minority exhibit no symmetry (are asymmetric).<br>  <br>  In spherical symmetry, any plane that passes through the center of the object divides the form into two identical halves that are mirror images of each other. Such objects are shaped like spheres or globes. For example, a round ball exhibits spherical symmetry.<br>  <br>  In nature, spherical symmetry is exhibited by the external form of many colonial algae, such as Volvox.  The sphere has the greatest surface to volume ratio of all shapes allowing for greater internal structures being proteced by a proportionally smaller outer cell wall.  Many cells tend toward this shape because of this.

b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	In the freshwater environment, water is constantly moving into the paramecium, because the paramecium contains more concentrated solutes than its environment.  The paramecium collects the excess water in an organelle called the "contractile vacuole" which, using energy, expels the excess water.<br>  <br>  As the paramecium moves into the brackish environment, the net water movement into the paramecium will slow (as compared with the freshwater environment).  The contractile vacuole will have less to do, and will contract less frequently.<br>  <br>  As the paramecium enters the seawater environment, the net water movement will be from the paramecium to the environment.<br>  If this were an animal cell we were talking about, water would move out of the cell, and the cell would shrink.<br>  But it's not.  The shape and size of the paramecium is constrained by its semi-rigid pellicle.  Still, enough water will move out, and enough salt will move in, that it will disrupt the operations of the paramecium.  The paramecium will futilely attempt to escape, fail, discharge its trichocysts, and die.<br>  <br>  You can simulate this by observing live paramecia in a drop of water on a slide.  Put a small salt crystal at one end of the drop.  Watch the paramecia cluster at the other end of the drop.  Watch them discharge their trichocysts and die.  You are heartlessly cruel!

Like if you are breeding two plea plants that continually produce tall pea plant and the seeds from that generation form plants that are mated and continue to breed true (the same tall pea plant). If this continues generation after generation we describe them as true-breeding.

He2WsvBcaa	Yes, sugar is polar and is considered nonvolatile because it will not regularly melt in atmospheric temperatures. So sugar will dissolve in water and thereby lower the freezing point of the water making ice melt faster.<br>  Salt on the other hand is not polar, but ionic. Ionic substances dissolve in water easier than do polar substances because of their more ionic bonds, while polar substances have slightly negative and positive portions. Salt will actually lower the freezing point of water even more than salt does, because when it is dissolved it disassociates into individual ions.<br>  Yes Twilight Lover, polarity does affect solubility. Molecular polarity is a completely different thing which involves the symmetry of the molecular structure. The polarity in the bonds of a substance affects the solubility of it in water.<br>  "Like dissolves like"<br>  Polar water dissolves polar substances<br>  Polar water dissolves ionic substances<br>  Polar water does not dissolve nonpolar substances very well.<br>  Table sugar is sucrose C12H22O11<br>  Blood sugar is glucose C6H12O6|`|FadpfSoKaa	Sugar is polar. Polar compounds are those that have a distinct, directional disproportionation of electronegativity.  Fancy way of say if the electrons are pulled to one area above another in a molecule.  The easiest way to see if something is polar is to llok for polar groups (like OH) and see if they are not distributed in an symetrical manner.|`|eyVtnoBaaa	Polarity has nothing to do with solubility. An element or compound is polar or nonpolar because of its structure and shape. When the element is structured and it has the "points" in the shapes like the trigonal planar has three points. But if all of the points are the same element it is nonpolar. If they have even one different "point" it is polar. But to answer your question, sugar as in glucose IS polar.

88fjr4mwaa	The best I have seen wound the string around the axle so that it disconnected when the string ran out.<br>  <br>  If you wind string on the axle of a car and pull it, the car will move, but the string must let go when it is fully unwound or the car will stop.<br>  So, you might have a small peg on the axle to hold the end of the string and the string must slip off this when it is fully unwound.<br>  Or, you could have a few turns of string over the end of the string when you start winding the string.<br>  <br>  Either way, the string must not rotate on the axle without turning the axle.<br>  <br>  The wheels must be fixed to the axle so the wheels and axle rotate together.<br>  <br>  For power, you need a lot of string so you can apply power over a long distance.<br>  But a mouse trap only moves its arm over a small distance, so you have to put a long arm on the mouse trap to increase its distance of pull. You attach the string to the end of the long arm.<br>  <br>  The long arm string end must start just above the axle to give maximum power when the car is just starting. So this means you have to have a long car to support the mouse trap and the long arm.<br>  <br>  The string must not touch any part of the car (apart from the axle) or this will add to friction losses.<br>  .

However, for all EM waves, within the modern universe, the speed of light is the same! However, I have quoted below some possible exceptions to the observation that the speed of light is constant!<br>  <br>  Wikipedia comments, that '... Weyl, Eddington and Dirac suggested the questions of just why the fundamental constants of nature have the values they do, and whether they are changing as the universe evolves <br>  <br>  “ The possibility that the fundamental constants may vary during the evolution of the universe offers an exceptional window onto higher dimensional theories and is probably linked with the nature of the dark energy that makes the universe accelerate today."<br>  <br>  ....<br>  <br>  Quantum gravity models suggest that the speed of light exhibits dispersion. While being smooth at large distances, space-time might show a complex, foamy, structure due to quantum fluctuations at short distances on the order of the Planck length ?P [sic].<br>  <br>  An energy dependence of the speed of light in vacuum may arise from photon propagation through such a gravitational medium. Lehnert and Roy also discussed as a possible effect of fluctuations of permittivity and permeability in vacuum that photons may be gaining mass, if indeed photons have non-zero masses. Recently, Ra?ada proposed that due to variation of physical constants, there will be change of permittivity and permeability of quantum vacuum causing a change of refractive index of the vacuum. There should be an effect upon the rest mass of a photon as well, because such a vacuum can shift the frequency of a photon propagating through it.<br>  <br>  Observations of astrophysical events at high redshifts can be used to place severe limits on the variation of the speed of light itself Δc/c, as well as on the photon mass mγ.

WkWedRnoaa	With only 20 pieces of linguini and 20 mini marshmallows, and having to sustain a 10 second "earthquake", here are some of my thoughts:<br>  <br>  Since linguini is not quite as structually strong as wood or steel, keep the pieces of linguini short (3 inches or 8 cm) so that the earthquake doesn't cause them to snap.  Make the building have a square base, two stories tall with an angle roof. Using 12 pieces of linguini and 8 marshmallows, make a cube.  then, from the corners of the "2nd" floor, cross two linguini pieces in an X to be support for the egg.  Using five more pieces of linguini and two more marshmallows, make a peaked roof that will keep the egg from rolling off the "2nd" floor.  The whole thing would be about 5 inchies (13cm) high and 3 inches (8cm) square.<br>  <br>  Another possibility would be to use most of the marshmallows as a "bottom" (held together by longer pieces of linguini that could go through more than two marshmallows) and rest the egg on this, then build some kind of a "roof" over the base.  This would keep the egg from falling, but it must also be kept from going side to side and falling off the marshmallows.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

The body has to get tryptophan and other essential amino acids from food. Tryptophan helps the body produce the B-vitamin niacin, which, -in turn, helps the body produce serotonin, a remarkable chemical that acts as a calming agent in the brain and plays a key role in sleep. So you might think that if you eat a lot of turkey, your body would produce more serotonin and you would feel calm and want a nap.<br>  <br>  Some other foods to consider:<br>  <br>  These are foods high in the sleep-inducing amino acid tryptophan:<br>  <br>  Dairy products: cottage cheese, cheese, milk <br>  Soy products: soy milk, tofu, soybean nuts <br>  Seafood <br>  Meats <br>  Poultry <br>  Whole grains <br>  Beans <br>  Rice <br>  Hummus <br>  Lentils <br>  Hazelnuts, Peanuts <br>  Eggs <br>  Sesame seeds, sunflower seeds

Atm74ULtaa	If you find some bedrock that appears to have been scraped and polished, chances are that long ago a glacier moved across that bedrock. As glaciers move along, they pick up rocks and these rocks are dragged across the underlying bedrock. This results in the bedrock being scraped and polished. Of course, you will not see this until after the glacier melts. There are many places in Canada and in the Northern United States where you can go to see bedrock that looks like this. If you have never seen what it looks like, just follow the link that I have provided below to see a photograph of "glacial smoothing".<br>  <br>  I hope that you like this answer. If so, please vote for it as the "Best Answer". As you may have noticed, most of my answers include a detailed explanation, so that the person who asked the question can learn from it.

As the glacier moves downhill, These rocks can create long linear scratches in bedrock. The finer particles can act just like sand paper does on rock.<br>  <br>  Frequent earthquakes can also scratch rocks along the fault face, but that occurs across srata, not along a bedding plane. Crustal deformation could cause scratches along a bedding plane, and it does, but there's nothing quite like the long linear scratches caused by a glacier's bed load on bed-rock. Other scratches are not nearly as long or as straight.|`|Fd6G60bTaa	i have a question actually, who ar you because i have these questions and explaniing in science too?

b96e23f4e62d95301c15a6f530a29fe7aa	I'm thinking the 26 kg box must be exerting a force, mg, of about 255 newtons on the floor. If the coefficient of static friction is 0.37, it's gonna take about 255 times 0.37 newtons to budge that puppy. So, go figure about 94 N.|`|0c1OMySMaa	Draw a diagram and label all the forces acting on the box. There should be the force that you exert, pointing horizontally in one direction, a frictional force, acting horizontally in the opposite direction of your applied force, and then a normal force pointing vertically up. So, for this problem, all we need to do is set your applied force equal to the frictional force and solve. The frictional force (Ff) is equal to coefficient of friction multiplied by the normal force, which is the mass times the gravitational constant, g. So, Ff = 26*g*u = 26*9.8*.37= 94.276. So, to get this box to start moving, we need to apply a force equal to this frictional force. So the minimum force is just 94. Answer is C.<br>  <br>  Sorry if the explanation is a bit confusing, but hopefully you at least get the idea.

ycbkzprjaa	If you are going to run this pump continuously, the cost is prohibitive. A 12vdc 2a panel is about 2x4foot and cost between $150-350. You would need over 50 panels to run it (considering waste heat from the inverter.) Each panel puts out 26watts in full sun. In Phoenix, the average full sun hours is about 6hours/day. In Duluth, Mn, the average FSH is 4.5. I have built and ran a photovoltaic system for a home I lived in the 1980s. The biggest problem was battery storage. It turns out that one needs about 1.5months worth of storage. In your case you would roughly need over 10,000amphrs of 12v batteries. All those panels and batteries and accompanying inverter will allow you to run the pump 24hr/day, 365days/year. Several suggestions - run the pump during daylight and use an elevated tank for water/energy storage for dark hours - Get a smaller pump - Instead of one 120vac big pump, switch to several 12dc smaller pumps (ditch the inverter, I used all 12vdc lights and appliances, never bothered with an inverter). If you have extra know how, place the panels on trackers to follow the sun, you'd save a panel or two and maybe 1 or 2 batteries.|`|AA11562326	That's asking a lot, especially if you mean it must run 24-7.

k5Ece8BTaa	The theory of Plate Tectonics is quite fascinating of continents drifting majestically from place to place breaking apart, colliding, and grinding against each other; of terrestrial mountain ranges rising up like rumples in rugs being pushed together; of oceans opening and closing and undersea mountain chains girdling the planet like seams on a baseball; of violent earthquakes and fiery volcanoes. Plate Tectonics describes the intricate design of a complex, living planet in a state of dynamic flux.<br>  <br>  With all of this, mountains, volcanoes, earthquakes, mid-ocean ridges, thrust faulting, Mountain folding, and subduction happen.|`|FMM5qaW3aa	Plate tectonics is the theory that the continents are made of tectonic <br>  <br>  plates that drift extraordinarily slowly. The theory of plate tectonics <br>  <br>  also says that a super-continent called Pangea was created by the <br>  <br>  continents drifting. Mountains for example, are made when 2 plates <br>  <br>  collide and are pushed upwards in a spot. Fault lines are lines where <br>  <br>  tectonic plates (the continental plates) are grinding against each other, <br>  <br>  this can cause earthquakes. California, for example has so many <br>  <br>  earthquakes because of the San Andreas fault line where plates are <br>  <br>  rubbing against each other. California is also slowly drifting away from <br>  <br>  the mainland of the USA. However this is happening extremely slowly. Good luck!
Gnfc4wRlaa	The first sort of plate boundary is called a divergent boundary, or spreading center. At these boundaries, two plates move away from one another. As the two move apart, mid-ocean ridges are created as magma from the mantle upwells through a crack in the oceanic crust and cools. This, in turn, causes the growth of oceanic crust on either side of the vents. As the plates continue to move, and more crust is formed, the ocean basin expands and a ridge system is created.<br>  As you can imagine, the formation of the new crust on either side of the vents would act to push plates apart, as we see at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which helps to move North America and Europe further and further apart. Mid-ocean ridges are vast mountain chains in the ocean and are as tall if not taller than mountain chains on land. The process which actually drives the motion at these ridges is known as convection. Magma is pushed upwards through the ridge cracks by convection currents. As some magma erupts out through the crust, the magma which does not erupt continues to move under the crust with the current away from the ridge crest. These continual convection currents, called convection cells, help to move the plates away from each other to allow more crust to be created and the sea floor to grow. This phenomenon is known as sea-floor spreading.<br>  <br>  Convergent boundary or subduction zone. These are plate margins where one plate is overriding another, thereby forcing the other into the mantle beneath it. These boundaries are in the form of trench and island arc systems. All the old oceanic crust is going into these systems as new crust is formed at the spreading centers.<br>  <br>  Subduction zones are the location of very strong earthquakes, which occur because the action of the down going slab interacts with the overriding slab. The "Ring of Fire" around the margins of the Pacific Ocean is due precisely to the subduction zones found around the edges of the Pacific plate. Subduction also is the cause of the volcanic activity in places like Japan: as the downgoing slab goes deeper beneath the overriding plate, it becomes hotter and hotter because of its proximity to the mantle. This causes the slab to melt and form magma, which moves upward through the crust and eventually forms volcanoes (island arcs) in oceanic crust or huge intrusive masses (plutons and batholiths) in continental crust. The Aleutian Islands are another example of a surface expression of subduction.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, when there is a convergent boundary between two continental plates, subduction cannot occur. Since continental crust is more bouyant, or less dense, than oceanic crust, one plate does not easily override the other. Instead, the plates crumple as they plow into one another, and a very high mountain range is created. This is a special type of convergent boundary called a collisional boundary. The Himalayas in India are the result of two continental plates (the Indo-Australian and Eurasian plates) colliding head on.<br>  <br>  The third type of plate boundary is called a conservative or transform boundary. It is called conservative because plate material is neither created nor destroyed at these boundaries, but rather plates slide past each other. The classic example of a transform plate boundary is the San Andreas fault in California. The North American and Pacific Plates are moving past each other at this boundary, which is the location of many earthquakes. These earthquakes are caused by the accumulation and release of strain as the two plates slide past each other.|`|6r7Z8vIYaa	Hm, not exactly sure what you're talking about, but we just did a section in Science on these, so i'll give it a shot.<br>  Convergent: the plates move together ---> <--- <br>  Diveregent: the move apart <---- ----><br>  Transform: they slide past eachother, and i dont know how i should show that.. hm, v ^ haha, i guess thats the best i can do.<br>  hopee i helped + have funnn :]
6r7Z8vIYaa	Convergent boundaries cause mountain ranges to develop. The Himalayas for example, were formed when the plate carrying India collided with the plate carrying Eurasia. This continental collision is still active and moving at a rate of 3 to 4 inches per year as the India plate is pushed under the Asian plate and the mountain continue to grow. Strong earthquake activity is very common with areas of convergent boundaries as well.

i0ypGmlQaa	Consider A and B to be upper triangular.<br>  <br>  Then consider C = AB. What is the i,j entry of C if i>j?<br>  <br>  Well, it's the dot product of the i-th row of A and the j-th column of B.<br>  <br>  However, the i-th row of A has the form:<br>  [ 0 0 0 0 0 .... 0 0 x x x x x x ]<br>  where there are i zeros.<br>  <br>  The j-th column of B has the form:<br>  [ x x x ... x x x 0 0 0 0 ...0 0 0 ]<br>  where there are j entries (and n-j zeros).<br>  <br>  Because there are more zeros (i of them, and i>j) than there are entries in the j-th column of B, they overlap like this:<br>  <br>  [ x x ... x x 0 0 0 .... 0 0 ... 0 0  ]<br>  [ 0 0 .... 0 0 0 0 0 ... x x .... x x ]<br>  <br>  But then the dot product is entry Cij, which is zero! Thus AB is upper triangular.<br>  <br>  Now for inverse. The idea is sort of the same. Assume A and B are inverses, and that A is upper triangular. Now assume B is not upper triangular. Take Bij nonzero, with i>j.<br>  <br>  Then in the product C = AB, what are the entries in C? What about the entry in the ij position? It's not zero. I'll let you work out the details.
GASTNilgaa	Note that one direction is easy and requires no hypothesis on the field: if f = 0 as a polynomial, then f(m) = 0 for all m in F.  The "hard part" is the other direction, so let's focus on that.<br>  <br>  The division algorithm in F[x], if you are familiar with it, has among its consequences that if p in F[x] and r is an element of F for which f(r) = 0, then there is q(x) in F[x] for which<br>  <br>  p(x) = q(x) (x - r).<br>  <br>  Since F[x] is an integral domain, we know also that if the original p(x) is nonzero (as a polynomial) then so must the q(x) in this theorem be nonzero (as a polynomial).<br>  <br>  So let us suppose that f(x) is a nonzero element of F[x] and that f(m) = 0 for all m in F.  Let d denote the  degree of f.  Since F is infinite, we can choose d+1 distinct elements m_1, m_2, ..., m_{d+1} in F.<br>  <br>  Since f(m_1) = 0 and f is not the zero polynomial, there is a nonzero polynomial q(x) in F[x] with<br>  f(x) = q(x) (x - m_1)<br>  Since f(m_2) = 0 we conclude q(m_2) (m_2 - m_1) = 0, and since the m's are distinct, we conclude that q(m_2) = 0.  So there is a nonzero polynomial q' in F[x] with q(x) = q'(x) (x - m_2).  Then<br>  f(x) = q'(x) (x - m_2)(x - m_1).<br>  and so on.  By induction you can exhibit a nonzero polynomial g(x) satisfying<br>  <br>  f(x) = g(x) (x - m_1)(x - m_2) ... (x - m_{d+1})<br>  <br>  And this is a contradiction because f has degree d and the right hand side has degree at least d+1.<br>  <br>  Note that we really did use the infinite-ness of F here; in a finite field the same argument produces no contradiction.  (It does show, that if f is a polynomial that gives rise to the zero function, then the degree of f must be at least the number of elements in the field.  But there is no contradiction from that!)  And indeed in finite fields you can have nonzero polynomials give rise to the zero function.

YYLybWHSaa	'Double Helix' is the tittle of the biased and personal, even gossipy account of Watson's work at the Cavendish lab.  This is his version of the events leading up to the discovery of the structure of the macromolecule DNA.<br>  <br>  I think the good part of the book is relating how competitive science can be. Being second to publish just doesn't count. People get so focused on publishing and being accredited they develop very situationally biased ethics. It is similar to climbers who will risk their lives and the lives of others just to summit a mountain when in other situations they would never behave in a similar manner. I think this book is a warning to those going into research about what type of behavior is possible.

RA5ziwKyaa	I'm not sure if you learned stoichiometry with an ice table or not but the first thing you have to do is since you have 8.6 and 4.3 L at STP, convert those to moles first by dividing each by 22.4 (because at STP, there are 22.4 L in 1 mol).  You get .384 mol of H2 and .192 mol of O2.  Then you can make the ice table (which stands for initial, change, and end)<br>  <br>                    2H2   +   O2   -->   H2O<br>  <br>     Initial       .384      .192            0       <br>                 <br>    Change    -.384     -.192        +.384<br>               <br>     End          0              0           .384<br>  <br>  There is no limiting reactant in this problem so you can subtract .384 and .192 from H2, and 02's initial value (you subtract different numbers because they have different coefficients).  Therefore, since the end box is .384 for H20, that is your answer in moles.  You need to convert it back to L by multiplying by 22.4 which = 8.6 L|`|0bff81ed3d62dee95cf8cc2a3daa55a4aa	This is actually a very simple question, once the equation is balanced.  For every liter of O2, you need two liters of H2 to react completely, or double the given volume of O2.  Since that is what you have in the question, the volume of gaseous H2O produced would be equal to the volume of H2 reacted (1:1 in the equation), so that would be just 8.6 liters.<br>  <br>  Be sure you double check my answer (and 2nd email) to your previous question - I neglected to factor in the liquid phase of the H2O produced.|`|52FuhDlAaa	first find which one is the limiting reactant so ... <br>  <br>  8.6 L of H2 * 1 mol / 22.4 L of H2 * 2 mol of H2O / 2 mol H2 = 0.3839 mol H2O<br>  <br>  4.3 L of O2 * 1 mol /22.4 L of O2 / 2 mole of H2O / 1 mol of O2 = 0.3839 mol H2O <br>  <br>  since they are the same, there is no limiting reactant.<br>  Now, that you have the amount of moles H2O  in the reaction, you have to turn it to liters... so...<br>  <br>  0.3839 mol of H2O * 22.4 L of H2O / 1 mole of H2O = 8.6 L of H2O <br>  <br>  so... it's 8.6L H2O

It could kill an unattended baby, I suppose, but I don't think gorillas leave their babies unattended.<br>  Besides, snakes tend to eat what they are used to eating.  Since gorilla is not a normal part of their diet, only starvation would make them willing even to try it.

Use excel to plot the data: load vs elongation or stress vs strain.  You need to identify the slope of the linear portion of the curve, that is from 0,0 up to where the curve deviates from linear.  The 0.2% offset means you need to pick the point on the curve where it has deviated from the straight line by 0.2%.  If you want to do it without the graph, there is alot of math involved. You need to define the equation for the linear portion and then start testing your x,y data until you find the first x,y pair that deviates from the equation of the line by 0.2%.

The ability to form this symbiosis reduces fertilizer costs for farmers and gardeners who grow legumes, and allows legumes to be used in a crop rotation to replenish soil that has been depleted of nitrogen.<br>  <br>  Legume seed and foliage have a comparatively higher protein content than non-legume material, probably due to the additional nitrogen that legumes receive through nitrogen-fixation symbiosis. This high protein content makes them desirable crops in agriculture.|`|xFFZ0rH7aa	Can the girl above me help me with my homework?

t8oogbs2aa	Everything in chemistry is an equilibrium. Just because you have a polar substance in a non polar solvent it doesn't mean that it will never be soluble. It just means that if you have a solution of chloroform and water, the equilibrium will fall more to the water. However, if you then extract the two layers, you will find some NaCl in the chloroform too. I know it's not the most straight forward answer but it may help you.

GASTNilgaa	It is simple to prove, but what you have written leaves much to be desired.<br>  <br>  The clause "If there is f which is a member of F[x]" is somewhat unconnected to what follows.  (The "it" in the "the only way it could be a field" could only be referring to F[x], not to f.  And in fact you never mention f again, so there is no reason to bring it up.)  You do say something that indicates you understand the idea of why F[x] is not a field.  If I read you correctly, you are attempting to say something along the lines of the following:<br>  <br>  The units of F[x] are precisely the nonzero polynomials of degree zero.  Since there are nonzero things besides polynomials of degree zero in F[x], there are nonzero elements of F[x] that are not units, so F[x] is not a field.<br>  <br>  This is a perfectly correct argument, although the key to all of it, the statement that "the units of F[x] are precisely the nonzero polynomials of degree zero" is worth proving in detail.  If those details were supplied, I do not think anybody could find fault with your proof. <br>  <br>  You can also reason somewhat less abstractly: you just need to exhibit _one_ nonzero element of F[x] that is not a unit to show that F[x] is not a field.  So it would be enough to prove, for example, that x is not a unit.  (which is pretty clear: if q(x) is any nonzero polynomial, the degree of x q(x) is at least 1, and since the degree of 1 is 0, we conclude that for all nonzero q(x) in F[x] we have that x q(x) is not equal to 1.  So there is no multiplicative inverse for x).

xmvPyLYUaa	Here's the answer I gave to a similar quesiton a week ago.  It answers your first question.  As to the second question, pi wasn't really invented, it was discovered.  Approximations of pi date back to at least the Ancient Egyptions (maybe earlier).<br>  <br>  Pi is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle; approximately equal to 3.14159265358979323846...<br>  (wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn)<br>  <br>  To understand what this means, try the following:<br>  <br>  Find a few circular objects around your house, like a cake pan, lid to the peanut butter jar, an oreo cookie, etc. Get a tape measure.<br>  <br>  For each object, measure the circumference (the distance around the circle) and then measure the diameter (the distance across). Finally, divide the circumference by the diameter. If you measure very carefully and divide correctly, then you should come up with a number close to 3.14 every time. (Expect some of them to be a little off. It's very hard to get an exact measure of the diameter of a circle without knowing precisely where the center of the circle is.) Therefore, if you know the diameter of a circle, you can estimate the circumference of that circle by taking the diameter times 3.14. <br>  <br>  So why call it pi? Why not just say 3.14?<br>  <br>  It turns out that the exact ratio of the circumference to the diameter is an irrational number, which means the numbers after the decimal keep going and going and going without repeating. In reality, every time we use 3.14 for pi, our answer will be just a little bit off because we had to round. For small numbers, the difference is barely noticeable, but for larger numbers, it can make a big difference unless you use more decimal places in pi (like 3.14159). Instead of trying to figure out how many decimal places we need for each problem, we just use the symbol for pi. <br>  <br>  Using the pi symbol in calculations is very much like working with a variable. The key difference is that variables can represent a range of numbers. Pi will always be that number that is close to 3.14.|`|cdeWSNHTaa	Pi is the relationship that exists in all cicles between the circumference and the diameter. It wasn't invented. It simply exists and was discovered. The big idea is that in all circles it takes a little more than 3 diameters to make the circumference. 3.14........... to be a little more precise. That simple fact is true for all circles. Isn't that amazing!!!|`|BuvQ8tuuaa	The decimal approximation of pi never ends, so the phrase "all the numbers in pi" is meaningless--you can't ever get all of them.<br>  <br>  No one really "invented" pi; it is just there as one of life's mysteries.

xmvPyLYUaa	Factor the denominator of the first fraction:<br>  x^2 - 9 = (x + 3)(x - 3)<br>  <br>  Your least common denominator will be (x + 3)(x - 3)(x - 2).<br>  <br>  You need to make all of your denominators like the one above, so multiply the numerator and denominator of each fraction by any of the factors that are not already in the denominator:<br>  4/(x + 3)(x - 3) = 4(x - 2)/(x + 3)(x - 3)(x - 2).<br>  5/(x - 2) = 5(x + 3)(x - 3)/(x + 3)(x - 3)(x - 2).<br>  -6/(x - 3) = -6(x + 3)(x - 2)/(x + 3)(x - 3)(x - 2).<br>  <br>  Now that all the denominators are the same, you can add your numerators by multiplying the polynomials, distributing the constants, and combining like terms.<br>  <br>  4(x - 2) + 5(x + 3)(x - 3) - 6(x + 3)(x - 2) <br>  4(x - 2) + 5(x^2 - 9) - 6(x^2 + x - 6) <br>  4x - 8 + 5x^2 - 45 - 6x^2 - 6x + 36<br>  -x^2 - 2x - 17<br>  <br>  This is your numerator.  As far as I can tell, this doesn't factor, so your answer is:<br>  -x^2 - 2x - 17/(x + 3)(x - 3)(x - 2).<br>  <br>  Your teacher may want you to multiply the factors together in the denominator, in which case you would get:<br>  -x^2 - 2x - 17/x^3 - 2x^2 - 9x + 18<br>  <br>  To check your answer:  Pick any number for x.  (Well, any number that won't give you a zero in a denominator, so not 2, 3, or -3)<br>  Substitute your number for x in the original problem and in your answer.  If you've done it correctly, you should get the same answer for both.

When we add up the fractions we add just the numerators and we combine like-terms when we add, and we DON'T touch the denominators.<br>  <br>  so we should get one final fraction of:<br>  <br>  (5x^2-6x^2+4x-6x-8-45+36) / (x+3)(x-3)(x-2)<br>  <br>  now we combine the like terms of the Numerator and get one final fraction of:<br>  <br>  (-x^2-2x-17) / (x+3)(x-3)(x-2)<br>  <br>  we are basically finished with this, but you can eliminate all those minus's in the numerator and get:<br>  <br>  [-(x^2+2x+17)] / (x+3)(x-3)(x-2)<br>  <br>  Both these last two answers are correct. and There you go.<br>  you are welcome.|`|GfU4ukNVaa	4          5          6     <br>  ---------+---------- - ----------=0<br>  (x2-9)     (x-2)      (x-3)<br>  <br>  <br>       4              5          6     <br>    ---------    +   ---------- - ----------=0<br>  (x-3)(x+3)     (x-2)      (x-3)<br>  <br>  <br>       4              5          6              <br>    ---------    +   ---------- - ----------=  <br>  (x-3)(x+3)     (x-2)      (x-3)                <br>    <br>  <br>  4(x-2) + 5(x+3)(x-3)- 6(x+3)(x-2)   <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>    (x+3)(x-2)(x-3)<br>  <br>  <br>  4x-8+5x2 -45 -6x2-6x+36<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>    (x+3)(x-2)(x-3)<br>  <br>  -x2-2x-17<br>  ---------------------=0<br>  (x+3)(x-2)(x-3)|`|kNmTxsPhaa	THE ANSWER IS...<br>  ((2x^3) - (4x^2) - (23x) + 51) / ((x^4) - (5x^3) - (3x^2) + (45x) - 54)

PSiNv7gUaa	It really depends on the zoo you work at, whether it is city or privately owned, etc.  The last zoo I worked at started new keepers at a little over $10/hour, topped them out at $16/hour;  I know someone who works at a larger zoo where they top out at $20/hour.|`|SvmZlLdaaa	Not a lot! Obviously it will vary according to what country you are in and the particular zoo you work at, but a zookeeper's pay is generally quite poor - I used to be a zookeeper and earned minimum wage, which at the time was about ￡10,000 per year (about 20,000 US dollars). You cannot afford to buy or rent a place of your own on this sort of salary - you have to share with house-mates or a partner. Many people want to work with animals, so they don't need to tempt workers with high pay. The hours are long and you may not be paid for any overtime worked - in the zoo I worked at, you were paid only between 8am and 5pm, even if you arrived at 6.30am and didn't leave til 7pm. You are also required to work weekends and public holidays without additional pay, and the most time off you'll ever have is 2 days at a time. Animals need feeding and their enclosures cleaning every day, whether it's Christmas, your birthday, a bank holiday or whatever. It is definitely not a job you do for the money, or if you like taking long holidays or socialising at weekends and so on.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	Depends on where you get employment....a national zoo, a state zoo, a city zoo,  etc<br>  But here is a website where job openings are posted in the USA for zoo keepers and other animal keepers and you can explore the requirements, benefits and pay.<br>  Good luck!!!<br>  www.aza.org|`|cqLYkuz8aa	When I was a zoo keeper, I got paid $8.50 an hour plus lunch.

b96e23f4e62d95301c15a6f530a29fe7aa	The other answers are good, but I'll throw in my two cents anyway...<br>  <br>  I will be charitable and assume you mean types of engineering work rather than the quality of the engineer performing the work. Like any other profession, some people become engineers for the wrong reasons. Such people may become bad engineers or, perhaps even worse, bad managers of other engineers. Some wander into engineering via academia and stay to become teachers, but those may be good engineers or bad; it all depends on motive and experience acquired along the way. There is an old saying that “those who can, do; those who cannot, teach.” It could be that “those who can” just don’t have the time to teach because they are too busy doing.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, a really good engineer must get great satisfaction from designing and building… stuff. Almost any kind of stuff will do. So, we have chemical engineers, polymer engineers, mechanical engineers, civil engineers, architectural engineers, electrical engineers, ceramic engineers, aeronautical engineers, nautical engineers, biological engineers, radiation engineers, nuclear engineers, and on and on like that. All are engineers, but each has a particular interest in a smaller field of engineering. All share a common education in math, science, and an “engineering curriculum” that steers each in his or her chosen direction. Looking back, I think I might have enjoyed civil engineering more than electrical engineering because I like working outdoors. But I am passionate about electrical engineering, have been since early childhood. I think it takes passion to be really good at any job. So, if you “like maths and problem solving” engineering might be a good career path for you. Take the time to find out what really lights your fire though.<br>  <br>  One really huge branch of engineering is civil engineering. These engineers design and build public works projects, things like roads, dams, levees, highways, aqueducts, bridges, buildings, sewer and water systems and just about anything else requiring the expenditure of public funds for the common use by the public. To do all of that, they must have some of the skills of more narrow specialties, including mechanical, chemical, hydraulic, and electrical engineering.<br>  <br>  Because of their exposure to the public, civil engineers almost without exception must be state licensed. A license is issued only after passing rigorous tests of knowledge, and usually only after a period of internship working under another licensed civil engineer “in the field” to gain experience. While other engineers may also be licensed, which offers certain professional advantages, many choose not to be licensed. Those engineers may not be able to hang out a shingle, claiming to offer “engineering services,” but lack of a license doesn’t prevent them from practicing engineering, especially in the employ of someone else.<br>  <br>  At the other end of the engineering scale, at least in terms of project size, is bioengineering. It is also one of the most difficult of the engineering professions. If you make a mistake designing a bridge, it might collapse and injure or kill several hundred people. If you make a mistake designing a living organism, the consequences could affect millions of people in unexpected ways. Nevertheless, it is the wave of the future in engineering. The possibilities are unlimited in size, scope, and effect on the Earth and its inhabitants.|`|kvWSrGBMaa	Check out this web site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.engineergirl.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.engineergirl.org/</a><br>  <br>  It has lots of good info.|`|qkg3bAbgaa	I'm also considering applying for an Engineering course at university soon. Some branches of Engineering include: Electrical, Mechanical, Civil, Aeronautical, Chemical and Systems/Processes.<br>  <br>  It's by no means limited to these; in fact, there are far more than this. <br>  <br>  Wikipedia has a nice long list of Engineering topics, explaining what each of these, and other types of Engineering are. (It would take a long time to explain each one individually!)<br>  <br>  Another option is to look at individual university websites and see what courses they offer.|`|AA10193567	There are a lot of engineers in eteh world some of eth most season or all season are <br>  Electrical Engineering.<br>  Mechanical engineering.<br>  civil engineer.<br>  aviation Engineer.<br>  .................<br>  You can visit teh mit site so that u can know all teh availablle disciplanes .
aQU9X0q8aa	december 21 2012 if that is scary check out the religous happening of the dajjal|`|5H7Wgaknaa	december 212012 dot com is a load of baloney. This is the website which has a forum with the following note: "As site MODERATOR, I reserve the right to edit, lock and or remove posts and or threads, that violate forum rules and or are in part or in whole, are attempts to debunk 2012 information. "Debunking" posts in this site are prohibited."<br>  In other words, anyone trying to spoil their fantasies with a few hard scientific facts is not welcome. You can safely ignore them and leave them to their world of delusion.|`|D5QgyGbXaa	The church officials are a bit smarter than all those worrying about a hoax, baloney, and garbage about 2012 doomsday|`|nuhi9H6paa	Jesus told us in no uncertain terms that we were not to know when the end of the world would come but that we were always to be ready.<br>  <br>  The early Christian Church thought that Jesus was going to return at any moment. Only after a couple of centuries did the Church realize that it might be 2,000 or 4,000 or 8,000 years before Jesus returns.<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church wisely follows Jesus' advice and teaches that each of us should live as if we will meet our maker in the next ten minutes and that we need to work to make the world a better place for future generations.<br>  <br>  Do not worry about the end of the world. Trust God to make sure everything happens to plan. Just be ready to meet God at any time.<br>  <br>  If one looks at the doomsayers "theory" in total, it becomes apparent it is little more than a fairy tale based on a handful of mistaken observations and assumptions. You may see a hundred examples of so-called 2012 evidence, but it is mostly just repeated samples of the same misinterpreted phenomena.<br>  <br>  I doubt if anything will happen. Doomsayers whom manipulate the facts about these scientific studies often have a book to sell or some other gimmick. They know that by instilling fear upon the public they can achieve notoriety and financial profit!|`|0f335c54c170fe2c01d7008662459bd3aa	The church doesn't say anything about it. If anything, aside from the book of Revelations, the bible would say not to worry about tomorrow. Most people just make plans for the future, assuming it'll come as expected, instead of thinking along the lines of "God willing, next Friday the sun will rise".  Some might see this as being paranoid, but it's the truth since we never know what even the next hour will bring. <br>  Just live your life, and don't let a calender or the stars tell you what to expect.<br>  <br>  And remember, December 22 2012 is 'punch a Mayan in the face' day  :P|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	it's a date in the future. only the mayans knew what they were writing about.  this is like fortune telling -- NOT approved by the Rcc.  trust in God and all will be fine!|`|KHjYq2bHaa	The Catholic church tells you to buy a calendar for 2013.|`|S0h5iolmaa	Actually between 21 DEC 2011 ~ 21 DEC 2012 we will passing the end of this age and entering the next age (the golden age)...But don't be worry, panic or be afraid because the point of ending is also the point of new beginning too... many peoples says its the opening of human consciousness or human's third eye or final evolution of mankind...and its also written in many holy books like bible itself, and many cultures also believe it...Humankind has passed through many ages, so Just relax, don't worry, panic or be afraid just remember the point of ending is also the point of a new beginning too...|`|5gG42iOpaa	it is not happening.<br>  <br>  Church has nothing to do with its "non-happeningness" but I guess you could point out that Mayans were not Catholic
AA11103371	Yes.  One working copy of a gene is usually enough to keep yeast alive (hardy little critters) and a lot of the time they'll thrive.  The good copy suppresses the null phenotype. You'd expect this because yeast do just fine and reproduce as haploid or diploid.    <br>  <br>  There are probably a couple exceptions. Like if the null copy somehow prevents expression of the good gene (transcriptional regulation).

GgClh7dbaa	No, not in general<br>  <br>  Different kinds of cells may be different sizes. An ovum is larger than a blood cell, and a nerve cell may be quite long. And the longest neuron in a big animal like a man will be longer than one in a gerbil. But most cells, like a blood cell or a liver cell will be about the same size in all species. <br>  <br>  The graphic at <a href="http://www.emc.maricopa.edu/faculty/farabee/BIOBK/BioBookCELL2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.emc.maricopa.edu/faculty/fara...</a> shows the relative sizes of various microscopic objects.

E5PiFJRIaa	nice webassign...I am actually having trouble with this same exact question on my webassign.  <br>  <br>  Anyways, for a use the formula F = q (v X B) where B=0.4, v=3*10^5, and q=1.602*10^-6 because it is the charge of a proton.<br>  <br>  so F=1.602*10^-19*3*10^5*0.4 = 1.9224 × 10^-14<br>  That is a.<br>  <br>  for b, take what you got from a and multiply it by the sin of the angle minus 90.  So, 1.9224*10^-14*(sin(90-20)) = 1.8064 × 10^-14<br>  That is b.<br>  <br>  c is the same thing as b.  So, 1.9224*10^-14*(sin(90-30)) = 1.6648*10^-14<br>  That is c.<br>  <br>  good luck on your webassign

t1zDIKwaaa	The right ventricle has to pump blood out of the heart and through the lungs, to return it to the left atrium. There is a lot of resistance to blood flow through the lung capillaries, so a thick musle wall is needed to generate enough pressure to overcome this resistance. <br>  <br>  The right atrium only has to pump blood through an open valve (the tricuspid valve) into the right ventricle. There is much less resistance to this flow of blood so much less muscle is needed.
