Da qui l'ammirazione sfrenata dei suoi sostenitori che, loro s, lo invidiano pensando di ammirarlo. Lo invidiano e vorrebbero essere come lui(?!).

Mi chiedo cosa invidino/ammirino, nel caso di Berlusconi.  Poich la sua tracotanza, la sua ricchezza, il suo potere sono frutto di falsit, scorrettezze, avidit sconfinata indifferente a qualsiasi essere umano che non abbia i suoi geni (megalomania), abusi di potere e reati, l'ammirazione prevede il diventare, di fatto, individui che direttamente (soprattutto votandolo) alimentano  una societ corrotta, priva di giustizia, arrogante e senza leggi e regole, di cui sono poi i primi a lamentarsi.

In Italia, con il loro "allevamento", Berlusconi sta facendo fortuna!!    @Phoeni one come ti spieghi che Travaglio abbia vinto la causa che Berlusconi gli aveva intentato?

E cos, se anche si cerca di discutere razionalmente dei fatti avvenuti, c' sempre qualcuno (a destra e a sinistra) che comincer a ripetere le stesse parole trite e ritrite e ad attaccare direttamente l'avversario ("Tu sei invidioso di Berlusconi!", "Sei un fascista!") per passare poi alle parolacce e alle offese gratuite.|`|FsSTkmfraa	lo sai che Berlusconi  stato scagionato definitivamente e che il PM ha dovuto ammettere che tutti i suoi soldi sono soldi puliti?|`|O2oGDJjdaa	x Phoenix one:leggi questo
7tQS27Hjaa	Mah, solitamente per news su una querela ti fanno una telefonata e basta, dicendoti di andare in caserma.  Probabilmente la persona querelata ha offerto una versione dei fatti pesantemente diversa da quella offerta da te, e quindi hanno bisogno di rimetterti sotto torchio.    E' anche probabile che tu sia stata citata come testimone di un qualche fatto, magari a tua insaputa, o ci sia un esposto che ti vede in qualche modo coinvolta.    Non c' comunque niente di cui avere timore.  Nel malaugurato caso in cui la faccenda assumesse dei contorni di una certa gravit (ma ripeto lo considero assai improbabile) smetti di dire qualsiasi cosa ai Carabinieri e chiarisci loro che prima di proseguire oltre preferisci avvalerti della consulenza di un legale.

Non credo tu debba preoccuparti (a meno che tu non abbia qualcosa da nascondere, che ne so, ti piace pensare con la tua testa o non guardi tanta tv).    Se mi permetti, ti darei un consiglio: Quando sei in caserma/magazzino sbirri, ricordati di parlare con parole semplici, chiare. Ripeti spesso la stessa parola, e parla len-ta-men-te. Magari ti capita lo sbirro furbo (che per in genere  una carogna), ma probabilmente ti capiter il classico carabiniere da barzelletta.  D'altronde, se erano gente furba, facevano un mestiere meno umiliante no? O forse sono solo i miei pregiudizi...    Ah! La sai la barzelletta del manifestante picchiato?  Allora: ci sono due amici che si incontrano al bar alcuni giorni dopo il g8, e uno dice all'altro "Sai che lucia, quella ragazzina di sedici anni,  stata mangannellata sulle gambe da dei finanzieri, dopo che  caduta e le  volato via il casco?"  E l'altro fa: "E sai che Marco, quel ragazzo di colore,  caduto, gli  volato via il casco e i poliziotti lo hanno manganellato in testa?"  "Mamma mia!" dice un fotoreporter con un braccio rotto, "Io ho visto una cosa ancora peggiore, per: un disobbediente scappava dalla finanza, dalla polizia, e dai carabinieri, ad un cero punto cade, gli vola via il casco e i finanzieri cominciano a manganellarlo sulle gambe e i poliziotti cominciano a manganellarlo sulla testa."  Uno dei duoi amici a quel punto chiede: "E i carabinieri?"  e il reporter risponde: "Eh, i carabinieri si sono messi a manganellare il casco." Ah ah ah ah, tutti ridono, scoprendo diversi denti rotti.

Parliamoci chiaro,  solo un operazione di facciata che sfrutta il bisogno di sicurezza che viene richiesto a gran voce in Italia (inspiegabilmente dopo il bombardamento di notizie di extracomunitari da parte dei media...)    Sono contrario: 3000 uomini sparsi per l'Italia non vedo quale sostegno possano dare alle forze dell'ordine:  l'ultima volta che lo stato ritenne necessario disporre i militari per le strade fu nel '92, quando il problema non era il rom che s'ubriacava per le strade ma qualcosa di leggermente pi impegnativo da combattere...                                              la Mafia.    In questo modo l'esercito poteva contrastare la criminalit comune per dare modo alle forze dell'ordine di occuparsi (preoccuparsi) di questa grande piaga...    Affacciatevi sull'Europa: qualcuno ha l'esercito per le strade?  No, mi dispiace... e non crediate che la criminalit sia un problema della sola penisola, ma, ahim, i pezzi di m***a stanno veramente d'appertutto...

Poi il problema sicurezza non  un problema che l'esercito pu risolvere... anzitutto perch  una questione sociale che si pu risolvere con interventi di prevenzione e di insegnamento e poi con l'apporto delle leggi... ricordatevi che non c' sicurezza senza certezza della pena...    aiutiamo polizia e carabinieri, ma l'esercito mi sembra solo un tentativo per far vedere che si sta facendo qualcosa su questo tema, quando poi in realt le giuste azioni non si stanno facendo...|`|O8LTxLGraa	si sono favorevole....|`|t52ygBGAaa	Se le forze di polizia non bastano certamente|`|hLzbSa23aa	credo che le forze di polizia dovrebbero essere rinforzate x continure ad essere quell'organo che ci protegge per i problemi interni...l'esercito ha gi tanti compiti da svolgere...cosa vogliamo fargli fare ancora??? come fargli raccogliere la spazzatura!!!! un p di dignit x le nostre forze armate....fanno gi il loro su'!!!!|`|IitERoAyaa	favorevole xk danno una mano alle forze dell' ordine!!!!|`|e5dd54c76d536f5a05c56aae0d7566b7aa	Sicuramente favorevole, un aiuto concreto contro la criminalita e un aiuto concreto alle FF OO, e poi il nostro esercito non e nuovo a questo tipo di impiego nella storia dell'esercito gia all'alba della sua fondazione fu subito impiegato per l'ordine pubblico e la lotta alla criminalita.

5VX947x8aa	Perch se  vero che a Napoli lo smaltimento dei rifiuti  nelle mani della camorra, che ne trae rilevanti guadagni e illeciti profitti di ogni genere, con la compiacenza di molti amministratori locali, evidentemente collusi, tutto ci diventa un grave problema di ordine pubblico. E ordine pubblico vuol dire ordinato svolgimento della vita sociale. Da ci si traggano le debite conclusioni. Ma in un paese dove nessuno si prende la responsabilit di spostare una sedia, come si pu pretendere che si dichiari la Campania territorio devastato dalla criminalit e dalla sporcizia, in cui adottare provvedimenti straordinari? Il signor Bassolino, che finalmente ha ammesso di aver sbagliato nel non aver creato un sistema di smaltimento duraturo nel tempo ed efficace, come per esempio i termovalorizzatori, perch non d l'esempio e si munisce di scopa e bidone per pulire Napoli? Perch, soprattutto, non si dimette per la sua politica fallimentare? Quand' che un uomo politico oggi si dimette? Solo quando commette un omicidio? Ma taluni nostri uomini politici oggi hanno ancora vergogna per qualcosa? L'ho detto e lo ripeto: non si pu ordinare ai militari di fare i netturbini. Se la pulizia di Napoli non viene regolarmente eseguita dalle autorit civili, si abbia il coraggio di affidarne la gestione ai militari. Ma in questi casi con pieni poteri.|`|DEcYfkvOaa	Concordo in pieno con Antwan: a fare proteste contro la camorra non scendo mai in piazza, a imparare a fare la roccolta differenziata manco ci provano e poi rompono i c0gli0ni agli altri. Pur criticando aspramente il nano malefico (che ha SICURAMENTE ottenuto i suoi risultati scendendo a patti con la camorra) devo fare alcune precisazioni sul video:  benche' la nostra Costituzione (che stanno letteralmente cercando di sbranare in Parlamento) riconosca il diritto di manifestare ci sono regole da seguire, Queste regole prevedono che le manifestazioni siano TUTTE preventivamente notificate alla Prefettura che le autorizza pertanto chi si arma di cartelloni e scende in piazza cosi', d'impulso, sbaglia dovendo prima richiedere l'autorizzazione a manifestare.

IL video non a granch di scandaloso, e se non si prendevano i provvedimenti che il governo ha preso, la Campania sarebbe stata sepolta completamente dai rifiuti come lo fu Pompei nel 79 dopo cristo, te l' assicuro.|`|Qh0sZT3aaa	Certo che posono farlo...voglio vedere a te a prenderti sputi, pietrate, e insulti tutto il giorno.

Comunque per la cronaca,tutto questo bailame si chiama "Ordine Pubblico" ed  inutile far vedere tutte quelle belle scritte e altrettanti risposte di "diniego verso lo Stato" apostrofato di "regime".  Voi il regime non l'avete nemmeno visto da lontano,come me del resto ma, vedo forse pi in l di chi vorrebbe al potere Stalin o Mao, altro che inceneritori avrebbero installato.  Volevate forse Napoli come prima?  E' facile elencare la costituzione quando f comodo ed  espressa di parte,state voi da "quell'altra parte" e finitela con queste false ipocrisie da falce e martello.  Vivete l'oggi come lo fanno tutti.Parlate male del "nano" quando ha dato lavoro a centinaia di migliaia di persone e forse proprio anche alle vostre famiglie, quanto lavoro  ha dato Bertinotti e co....  Nessuno certo  perfetto,ma chiunque,me compreso,dobbiamo fare una auto-disciplina mentale e vedere oltre la massa di pecore che belano in continuazione.Pensate con la vostra testa e non seguire la massa.Almeno per una volta.  I funzionari hanno una responsabilit incredibile,decisioni che determinano fasi che possono andare bene o male e gli agenti sono esecutori di ordini della Repubblica. Non basta avvitare bulloni e poi scendere in piazza ad alzare i toni di protesta.  L'italiano deve crescere di pi,elimimando l'arroganza,il perbenismo falso e la superiorit che invece non ha,studiare un po di pi e lamentarsi di meno.  AL|`|KjNxerAmaa	L'Art 17 della Costituzione recita:    I cittadini hanno diritto di riunirsi pacificamente e senz'armi.    Per le riunioni, anche in luogo aperto al pubblico, non  richiesto preavviso.    Delle riunioni in luogo pubblico deve essere dato preavviso alle autorit, che possono vietarle soltanto per comprovati motivi di sicurezza o di incolumit pubblica.    Tuttavia in merito all'approvazione  del testo unico di pubblica sicurezza l'art 18 del Titolo II del R.D. 18 Giugno 1931 n.773 recita che:     I promotori di una riunione in luogo pubblico o aperto al pubblico devono darne avviso, almeno tre giorni prima, al Questore.    Art. 20.  Quando, in occasione di riunioni o di assembramenti in luogo pubblico o aperto al pubblico,avvengono manifestazioni o grida sediziose o lesive del prestigio dell'autorit, o che comunque possono mettere in pericolo l'ordine pubblico o la sicurezza dei cittadini, ovvero quando nelle riunioni o negli assembramenti predetti sono commessi delitti, le riunioni e gli assembramenti possono essere disciolti.    Art. 22.  Quando, nei casi preveduti dagli articoli precedenti, occorre disciogliere una riunione pubblica od un assembramento in luogo pubblico o aperto al pubblico, le persone riunite od assembrate sono invitate a disciogliersi dagli ufficiali di pubblica sicurezza o, in loro assenza, dagli ufficiali o dai sottufficiali dei carabinieri reali.    Art. 23.  Qualora l'invito rimanga senza effetto,  ordinato il discioglimento con tre distinte formali intimazioni, preceduta ognuna da uno squillo di tromba.    Art. 24.  Qualora rimangano senza effetto anche le tre intimazioni ovvero queste non possano essere fatte per rivolta od opposizione, gli ufficiali di pubblica sicurezza o, in loro assenza, gli ufficiali o i sottufficiali dei carabinieri reali ordinano che la riunione o l'assembramento siano disciolti con laforza. All'esecuzione di tale ordine provvedono la forza pubblica e la forza armata sotto il comando dei rispettivi capi.    Premetto che solo dal video non si possono carpire alcuni situazioni quali:   1)Il corteo era stato autorizzato?       Al fine di cio' dico che il filmato non puo essere giudicato cosi aspramente non sapendo i fatti realmente come sono accaduti.Una cosa e' certa, se il corteo e'stato bloccato nonostante fosse stato dato il normale preavviso,cio' vorebbe dire che veramente i nostri diritti sono stati calpestati.|`|mIvloXOvaa	Bravo Mauro..... finalmente qualcuno con un po di sale in zucca si fa sentire!....    lasciateli stare a tutti sti bambini che danno contro le FF.OO. tanto prima o poi la frittata si girer... e pure loro si ritroveranno a dover accettare cose che non condividono... e solo allora capiranno....    questa non  una domanda tanto per cominciare.... ma  solo un'altro stupido pretesto per puntare ennesimamente il dito contro chi  obbligato a stare agli ordini.

The most eye-opening civics lesson I ever had was while teaching third grade. The presidential election was heating up and some of the children showed an interest.  I decided we would have an election for a class president.  We would choose our nominees.  They would make a campaign speech and the class would vote.             To simplify the process,  candidates were nominated by other class members.  We discussed what kinds of characteristics these students should have. We got many nominations and from those, Jamie and Olivia were picked to run for the top spot.             The class had done a great job in their selections.  Both candidates were good kids.  I thought Jamie might have an advantage because he got lots of parental support.  I had never seen Olivias mother.  The day arrived when they were to make their speeches.  Jamie went first.  He had specific ideas about how to make our class a better place.  He ended by promising to do his very best.  Every one applauded.  He sat down and Olivia came to the podium.  Her speech was concise.  She said, If you will vote for me, I will give you ice cream.  She sat down.  The class went wild.  Yes! Yes! We want ice cream.               She surely would say more.  She did not have to.  A discussion followed.  How did she plan to pay for the ice cream?  She wasnt sure.  Would her parents buy it or would the class pay for it.  She didnt know.  The class really didnt care.  All they were thinking about was ice cream.  Jamie was forgotten.  Olivia won by a land slide.            Every time Barack Obama opens his mouth he offers ice cream, and fifty percent of America reacts like nine year olds.  They want ice cream.  The other fifty percent know theyre going to have to feed the cow.  |`|3d3b081575b38f91dcd769b90e4bd6d4aa	First, Senator Obama is not a Socialist and is not proposing a Socialist solution.  Socialism would imply common (Governmental) ownership of all means of production.  That is NOT his proposal.    Rather, he says that we need to spread the wealth a bit.  This at a time when the gap between the very rich and the poor is growing and the middle class is almost gone.      |`|zSeQIDxQaa	Republicans, when abusing the term socialism, mean the political systems of the formed Soviet Bloc; in reality, they fight against the political systems you see in the Scandinavian countries, Germany, Switzerland, etc. - places whose urbanization, education, economy, police, security and so on and on - the entire civilization - are about 2 centuries ahead of the traditionally republican strongholds like West Virginia, Kentucky, Alabama, etc. Just compare that "liberal" San Francisco with any of those places and start laughing :)|`|Vm9nWofSaa	I would argue that TAXATION = OWNERSHIP = SOCIALISM.

George Bush is not innocent by no means but look at what took the market down. Housing and look at the names attached to the failure of the Housing market.What is really sad is if you do your Research you would see where George Bush tried to Regulate Housing and the Democrats celebrated when they cast the majority to kill his request.

First, this financial crisis is not the fault of Wall Street alone. Both Washington and every single person who bought a house they couldn't afford share a significant share of the blame. Limiting executive pay too severely will make it harder to recruit top talent and thus fix the problems. It's going to be hard to convince someone who has options at the top of literally every single sector of business to take a job in the financial sector for 10% of what he will make doing anything else, and these are the people that these firms need to be able to recruit to turn things around.|`|55NKPb82aa	Actually it is for companies seeking help in the future, the companies that have their bailout money already still can make as much as they want.|`|QQsIPlV2aa	If these frigging Execs had any brains at all, they would have been stashing all theri bonuses in an off shore account!

That's if you can understand English! I think, from everything that has been going on in thei country, these exec's think THEY rule the land!(They probably OWN part of it!) Now, they have the nerve to BEG the Government for a handout!! These companies should go public on every penny they spend of OUR tax money! AND justify the spending of this money!  I will bet, the common working men and women won't see any of it! I don't know whether anyone saw the news yeaterday, but Governor Rendell told us that he was going to UP our taxes!!!

AA12020119	It is a constitutonal amendment:    AMENDMENT XXII   Passed by Congress March 21, 1947. Ratified February 27, 1951.    Section 1.  No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of President more than once.

If0vYA1qaa	Keyes is a Conservative and the liberals are afraid of him|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Because black people tend to be democrat? Its a pretty known fact that minorities tend to support the democratic party.    Lol at Edix "its not about race" then he uses a derogatory "hicks" term for white people.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	They don't for the most part. While there might be a few that are supporting Obama because of his race instead of his politics, the fact is that in the past 2 elections, they voted at least 89% for the white Democrat candidate. It's the (D) after the name that matters more.     However, because black voter turnout has typically been low, with Obama in the race, that turnout might increase. That's where the difference would come in.     One thing I find funny is that they and Democrats whine about the lack of blacks at the Republican convention, etc. But if 95% of a 15% minority are for one party, that means that the ones supporting the GOP will only make up maybe 2% of that party. They don't support the Republican party of their own volition.     Apparently, Republicans are evil because we don't believe the government should treat any citizen different than any other citizen, regardless of color.    A second funny aspect is that because the black vote is monolithically to one party regardless of benefit, there is no need for the Democrats to actually do anything for them, besides mouthing empty campaign promises every 2 years. That seems to work well enough.|`|AA10079357	It should not be about race and yes most blacks are democrats.  It should be about the AMERICAN PEOPLE no matter what the race.

This troops where called tankodesantniki russian for descendant but it was something of ex stream danger to do   Also the german army and the ally's did use this technique but in a much small way because they had armoured half track to ride there infantry into battle and also they where much more concerned about there men

Nessuna legge lo impedisce. Per, per educazione, bisognerebbe lasciare lo stesso libero il passaggio. Farlo  un segno di civilt.    Il padrone di casa che trova un'auto parcheggiato davanti al cancello, portone o garage, pu comunque chiedere gentilmente di spostare momentaneamente l' auto se deve passare, ma non pu obbligare nessuno a farlo.    Se invece ha il passo carrabile in regola, cio omologato dal comune, allora pu far valere i suoi diritti, anche chiamando i vigili se necessario.|`|AAjl8pAJaa	Non  vero.  Soltanto il rilascio da parte del comune dell'apposito cartello "Passo carrabile, ord. nxxx" vieta la sosta.  Tale rilascio  subordinato alla presentazione di apposita istanza ed al pagamento della tassa prevista (che varia in ogni comune).

TA1oouovaa	No -- while a conflict is ongoing, you can't send in peacekeepers (as there's no peace to keep), but rather peacemakers or peace enforcers.  No country would have volunteered to step in between the warring parties, especially under UN auspices -- Russia pulled out all the stops in destroying as much Georgian materiel (and personnel, too) as possible.  Plus, they haven't exactly been helpful in permitting observers to be on the ground since hostilities stopped.    It would have been a wasted effort.

Here is the MOH citation.     Sergeant First Class Shughart, United States Army, distinguished himself by actions above and beyond the call of duty on 3 October 1993, while serving as a Sniper Team Member, United States Army Special Operations Command with Task Force Ranger in Mogadishu, Somalia. Sergeant First Class Shughart provided precision sniper fires from the lead helicopter during an assault on a building and at two helicopter crash sites, while subjected to intense automatic weapons and rocket propelled grenade fires. While providing critical suppressive fires at the second crash site, Sergeant First Class Shughart and his team leader learned that ground forces were not immediately available to secure the site. Sergeant First Class Shughart and his team leader unhesitatingly volunteered to be inserted to protect the four critically wounded personnel, despite being well aware of the growing number of enemy personnel closing in on the site. After their third request to be inserted, Sergeant First Class Shughart and his team leader received permission to perform this volunteer mission. When debris and enemy ground fires at the site caused them to abort the first attempt, Sergeant First Class Shughart and his team leader were inserted one hundred meters south of the crash site. Equipped with only his sniper rifle and a pistol, Sergeant First Class Shughart and his team leader, while under intense small arms fire from the enemy, fought their way through a dense maze of shanties and shacks to reach the critically injured crew members. Sergeant First Class Shughart pulled the pilot and the other crew members from the aircraft, establishing a perimeter which placed him and his fellow sniper in the most vulnerable position. Sergeant First Class Shughart used his long range rifle and side arm to kill an undetermined number of attackers while traveling the perimeter, protecting the downed crew. Sergeant First Class Shughart continued his protective fire until he depleted his ammunition and was fatally wounded. His actions saved the pilot's life. Sergeant First Class Shughart's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest standards of military service and reflect great credit upon him, his unit and the United States Army.|`|vXqpwmzvaa	Chesty Puller!!!|`|Ro03hVb6aa	David H Hackworth.

u4liwDhAaa	Go to your local police department or your local sheriff's office.  Tell them what you have heard.  Let them know you fear for your safety since this is the area where you live.  They should be more than happy to accommodate you.  If that doesn't work for some weird reason, go to your local newspaper.  Why?  Because when I was in law enforcement, several members of the media would come every morning to the sheriff's dept. to check the logs for anything of interest.  The only other thing I can think of is call your local TV station or radio station and ask them what they know.

They try to treat you to the best of their ability.    If your dad was going to the same doctor for months and months and consented to surgery he must have been pretty confident that the doctor knew what he was doing....if he wasn't ....he should have gotten a second opinion (which I would have done before I let anyone cut me).    Anyone can sue anyone they want to...there's nothing stopping people from frivolous law suits...but I highly doubt you have a case.

If you say it wasn't based on hate then voting JUST BECAUSE of one's skin color would lead me to believe that you hate the color of a person's skin.

A racist judges ONLY on skin color!|`|KVlRYoidaa	no,i voted for him because i got paid,a hundred dollars is not bad.|`|SlhuFfuZaa	You or anyone.... is a very broad stretch and should not be stated in this way.

But in a lot of cases of his "supporters" yes is the definite answer. Usually its those who are making a profit from him by selling tee shirts with his face on them on the side of the road, etc. That stuff is absurd.     There are tons of black people who only voted for him because he is part black, even though some of them couldnt list one of his policies.     Then there are others, who are just democrats who happen to be black that voted for him--- and they are getting an unfair label by many. Not you. You bring up a valid point    I voted for him and am white, so I guess that makes me the complete opposite of racist. I hate the term liberal, though.|`|mmFz64MFaa	what if I didint vote for him cuzz hes black ?   cuzz thats what I did I dont really consider my self racist tho    meh good night peoples|`|93HyAM60aa	Race had some, but not too much to do with it. For instance, if Clarence Thomas would have resigned his seat on the Supreme Court and ran for the presidency, he would have received just as much support, right?     No, of course he wouldn't have.    Clarence Thomas doesn't 'represent' - and so the media would have bull-dogged him, just as they vilified him when he was nominated for the Supreme Court. It may be a strange way to disprove the racial argument of the recent election, but the fact remains that one must also be a liberal in heart and mind as well. That 'trumps' the racial aspect by far. Obama's race was more like nitrous added to the fuel of liberalism which provided the majority of the horsepower in the event.|`|h1lDGNp4aa	I disagree.  Racial discrimination means that you are AGAINST someone because of their race and those people are called racists.  So if a person voted FOR Obama because he is black that doesn't mean the person is racist.  However, if a person voted for Obama only because they are AGAINST people who are white then that person would correctly be called a racist.    Let's put it another way.  If a person voted Democratic their entire life but in this election they voted Republican just because Obama is black, then that person is a racist because they voted AGAINST Obama not FOR McCain.|`|s9aTmNHQaa	Since racisim is a generalisation about a group of people, usually a negative generalisation; voting for someone because they are black or white is not racist (unless you where soley voting for the person because the other person was the opposite colour). What people voted for was a change from an oppressed past, because Obama is black..of course that is part of it, he also represented a step out of that oppressed past.  If you were voting someone in soley because they were black, then ask yourself this if Bill Clinton was black would you have voted him in?|`|5QF6n2g7aa	yes thats very much true. x x|`|Xga0Y3Lhaa	Thank you ...some one with a bit of common sense!

I don't think he is having that rough a start, besides not properly vetting his cabinet picks before announcing them.

It's been proven that areas with more immigrants in the US are actually safer.    http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/...  Immigration: No Correlation With Crime    Despite our melting-pot roots, Americans have often been quick to blame the influx of immigrants for rising crime rates. But new research released Monday shows that immigrants in California are, in fact, far less likely than U.S.-born Californians are to commit crime. While people born abroad make up about 35% of California's adult population, they account for only about 17% of the adult prison population, the report by the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) showed. Indeed, among men ages 18 to 40  the demographic most likely to be imprisoned  those born in the U.S. were 10 times more likely than foreign-born men to be incarcerated.    The new report even bolsters claims by some academics that increased immigration makes the United States safer.    http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/vie...  Immigrants Bring Crime Is a Myth    Since 1994, the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States has more than doubled to 12 million. Immigrants, both legal and undocumented, now comprise just under 13 percent of the population. Yet, according to the FBI, between 1994 and 2005 the violent crime rate (murder, robbery, rape, assault) fell 34.2 percent and the property crime rate (burglary, theft) dropped 26.4 percent.     Cities with large and growing immigrant populations such as Los Angeles, New York, Miami and Chicago also experienced this downward trend in crime. If immigrationeither legal or undocumentedwere associated with crime, then crime rates should be rising.|`|b21fa9f80551f1440779f4c03a279e4aaa	they all are felons.

Now if you discount that little fact, then you have to look at every other law that they could be breaking.    If they are driving anywhere, unless they somehow got a license before states started cracking down, more than likely they are driving without a license, which is a crime along with driving without insurance is also a crime(you can't really get insurance without a license).    If they are working, they are also breaking the law, since it is illegal to obtain employment when not legally authorized to do so in the US.     If they have used anyone else's SSN or have obtained false documents, they are breaking the law.    In many states, there are laws against too many people living in one house or apartment, which is a common occurance when dealing with illegal immigrants.    If these illegal immigrants choose to send money home for the purpose of bringing over their relatives, they are guilty of aiding and abetting, along with enticing illegal immigrants to enter the US illegally. This also applies to anyone who gives them shelter or other help for the purpose of allowing the illegals to stay in the US illegally.     So even if you discount the fact that they are breaking the law when they step foot on US soil illegally, unless they are living alone, not working, not driving anywhere, and have no family they are trying to bring over, then they are all breaking multiple laws.|`|4c21e2f4c011e6cd394d8baf6024f878aa	It's more like 20 - 30 million illegals in this country.    But to answer your question, it is ALL of them.   They are in this country illegally.  Illegally means breaking the law.|`|iryMpZYwaa	Just one is too many!  Deport ALL illegal alien invaders!!|`|XRYAfxpTaa	All of them by overstaying or entering illegally.   All of those who hold a job under the table.  All of those who use fake papers.       GAO statistics indicate 21% of crime in the US is committed by illegal aliens, yet comprise about 3% of the population. That would translate to many illegal aliens committing further crimes.

AA10118655	First, "She is not legal in Seattle" for what? The age of consent in Washington for sexual activity is 16.    And, the age of consent has nothing to do with sending "inappropriate" pictures of yourself to her, or her sending inappropriate pictures of herself to you. She is still a minor, and you would be distributing obscene pictures to a minor, or, if she sends you picture of herself, you could get in trouble for having obscene pictures of a minor (it's called "Child Porn").    It doesn't make much sense that you are allowed to have sex with each other (and thereby see each other naked), but you cannot send pictures of yourself naked to each other. But the law is the law, and just because it doesn't make sense does not give you justification to break the law.|`|AA11206283	does anyone really have to tell you what a bad idea sending porn to a minor is|`|a8eb523f1f34be04fb9b4d5c65f11847aa	I think it would be because even she's not in the states your still sending (lets say nude pictures) to a minor so I know you can in trouble for that|`|Q7ovix19aa	I'm not sure, but I suspect the problem could be pornography laws.  Age-wise I would guess there isn't a problem in that direction, but laws are what they state.  If it just notes "give to underage ..., and it was sent from here, that could be interpreted as illegal.    Why don't you just go there, take the picture, and leave it.  Then the US isn't involved.|`|ss0vy4tFaa	just to be on the safe side make sure you're wearing something. you don't have to be naked to look romantic.|`|d60812b54bd94ed9b890bbc6003e6400aa	In Washington, it is a gross misdemeanor called "communication with minor for immoral purposes ."  So, it would not matter if it were legal where she is, because the jurisdiction where the offense occurs prosecutes according to local statutes.    However, you may be confusing the age of consent with the age of majority.  I don't know Canadian law, but here in Indiana, the age of sexual consent is sixteen, but it's still illegal to transfer or distribute pornography to anyone under eighteen.  Look into that before you leave any photos with her.|`|MPCKTIvaaa	no u can not if she is not in the same state and y would u want to do that for just get a girl in ur state cuz u kn u dont want to go to jail over a pic

0f9b2dd98b1a2c306428892348a3ea68aa	You weren't very specific on what you meant.      The good faith doctrine is a concept which as arisen out of the exclusionary rule.  The exclusionary rule was first introduced as being applicable to federal courts and prosecutions by Boyd v. United States 115 U.S. 616 (1886).  In Mapp v. Ohio, 363 US 643 (1961) the US Supreme Court had decided that the exclusionary rule also applied to the states.  In all of these cases, the police were held to have committed an invalid search.  In the case in Mapp, police invaded her home on a cause which at best was flimsy, were unable to produce a search warrant, and siezed evidence which was used against her at trial.  A 6-3 majority of the court determined that evidence thus gained could not be used against her.    Having given that background, the Good Faith doctrine has been argued that when an officer relies in good faith that the warrant that he/she is executing is valid, that the evidence should not be excluded, even though the warrant may not in fact be valid.  The good faith doctrine is used to cover warrants which are defective in some way, but through a mistype or misprint of another.  A warrant which was obtained by an officer's subtrefuge would probably not be subject to a good faith doctrine defense.    There is also a Good Faith doctrine in Contract Law, and in Corporate Law.

Instead they will continue to fight in the same clandestined fashion that they have been fighting Israel & the US, by providing rockets, money, IEDs etc. for Hezbollah, Hamas, parts of the Iraqi insurgency, and probably Al Qaida. They would be crushed if they tried to fight like soldiers. The addition of nuclear weapons would be serious, because that could be passed along to one of the above organizations & used against us, which is why we need to squelch Irans pursuit. Russia & China are more interested in their trade relationships as well as knocking the US down a peg instead of cooperating on this serious issue though.|`|dbdf8a45444bcf25831c4e1127e2c990aa	Only if they're ready to commit suicide .|`|ad2e2ad70296252cc43b42d95b3bc56eaa	If Israel continues its attacks on public infrastrucures Iran and Syria are not the only countries that are going to get involved.

Je comprends que tu n'es pas envie de supporter la misre du monde. Mais comprends-tu que la France a une part de responsabilit dans la misre que connaissent ses populations ?  Comment peux-tu expliquer qu'un continent aussi riche (matire premire) que l'Afrique soit aussi pauvre ?  Problme de comptence ? Possible.  T'es tu dj demand pourquoi la France entretenait et continuait  entretenir des relations avec des dictatures ?    Regarder les consquences de l'immigration sans regarder les causes, c'est disserter sur un livre qu'on a pas lu.  Renseignes-toi sur Mr Foccart et ses agissements en Afrique.

sb0W0lvBaa	A forum, i partecipanti son pagati per recitare sceneggiate all'italiana, non  banalit, conosco qualcuno che  stato pagato per farlo; fra l'altro, come in tutte le trasmissioni dispirazione defilippica (per quanto cronologicamente sbagliato) il pubblico partecipante, sempre lo stesso,  anchesso ben pagato per creare dibattito, meglio se lite.  E' uno di quei reality-talk che hanno la presunzione d informare  ma il cui scopo  creare discussioni intorno ad argomenti che catturano lo spettatore, non a caso sono sempre gli stessi di cui si straparla, alimentate da frasi che animano la giostra perch scatenano pareri fortemente contrapposti. N inettitudine n stupidit, finzione ben pagata.  Ma, dopo questa premessa, credo che il tuo intento fosse rubare quella affermazione per portare qui il dibattito su una frase infelice che descrive uno stereotipo, del passato pi che del presente,.  L'amara realt, invece,  una societ fortemente e brutalmente maschilista che relega la donna al ruolo di valletta o ornamento, dama di compagnia che per ritagliarsi un suo spazio o deve sgomitare o deve sgambettare, ovunque trovi spalle robuste o mani sul sedere.  Non giudico la scelta di fare la soubrette, purch ne sia capace, ed  una scelta che non pregiudica la possibilit di esser colta come un laureato che tante volte non lo  ed  pure villano.  Giudico il modello che si manda in tv per il quale si pu guadagnare tanto per 5 minuti di sculettata o di sorrisi, modello pensato ed elaborato da uomini.  La donna in tv  un contorno, cornice arredo per imbellettare uno studio popolato da soli uomini, per dire due scemenze e quando gliele fanno dire, per annunciare la pubblicit. Donne incapaci perch arruolate solo tra queste, il cui unico scopo  decorare, non servono donne capaci, non servono brave ballerine, ne brave conduttrici. E il modello  guadagnare tanto non facendo nulla, ma solo prestando un bel viso o un bel corpo da esibire e con la possibilt di conoscere alle serate mondane, cui l'agente impone la presenza, un calciatore con cui sistemarsi per la vita.  Il modello  nato pensato e voluto da un uomo, perch chi meglio di lui sa che non ci sarebbero le prostitute se non ci fossero gli uomini che pagano per sesso, che non ci sarebbero veline se non ci fossero uomini che sbirciano per  intravedere lelastico di una mutanda   inettitudine femminile e mera stupidit nascono con le fondamenta Fininvest  non dimentichiamo che il ministro per le pari opportunit  una che lha avuta e in cambio lha data   Talvolta, clowd, chi ti relega in un angolo a favore di un uomo  chi dovrebbe valorizzare il tuo essere donna pi degli altri e ti vorr solo per dare bella mostra di s  diffida di chi dice sono a favore delle donne, le donne sono pi brave, dovrebbero avere un ruolo maggiore nella societ, sono quelli che, voltandoti, poggeranno lo sguardo sul tuo fondoschiena e ti chiameranno puttan e fallita  puttan se hai concesso loro ci che ti chiedono, puttan se glielo neghi|`|ZMbMyL90aa	s,  davvero grave ci che si vede in tv, per questo io ormai non la guardo pi. Purtroppo in Italia  un po' tutto cos: l'immagine della donna, del politico, anche dell'uomo e via dicendo. Peccato, perch la tv sarebbe un mezzo ideale per diffondere cultura, per sensibilizzare, discutere, presentare diversi punti di vista, invece  tutto solo una farsa, e per di pi molto stupida e irreale. E pericolosa.  Le donne se vogliono lavorare in televisione, devono essere (o fare finta di essere) stupide, oche, ignoranti, senza senso dell'umorismo ecc., non capisco perch c' ancora tanta gente che vuole entrare in televisione. A me sinceramente fa schifo: sembra che per gli italiani, se non ci sono almeno un paio di ragazzine quasi nude (ormai anche il costume  troppo), il programma non  interessante. Ma  vero o si tratta di qualcosa di imposto? Perch intanto la gente continua a guardare la tv anche pi ore al giorno... Non capisco come mai. Se uno proprio vuole guardare ragazzine seminude, ci sono altri modi, non serve che ci siano anche nei programmi, no?  E poi si d troppa importanza alla bellezza come fosse un pregio, un ideale cui aspirare...  Il problema di fondo  la superficialit, il male della nostra era.

La tv ci propone degli stereotipi, uno di questi vede la donna come un soprammobile, giudicata per l'apperenza pi che per la sostanza, gli esempi da seguire sono le modelle anoressiche, le veline e le show girl.    Belle ragazze seminude le mettono da tutte le parti, nelle trasmissioni di calcio dove non sanno nemmeno se il pallone  tondo o quadrato, negli show a ballare e nei giochi a premi, le frasi che gli fanno dire sono all'incirca una a trasmissione,possibilmente corta e priva di contenuti.    Credo che siamo rimasti molto arretrati in quanto a pensieri sul suo ruolo all'interno della societ, e ce ne sono alcune che,sfruttando il dono di madre natura, inseguono il successo con i mezzi che,ad oggi, ha a disposizione la donna per mettersi in evidenza.  Probabilmente all'italiano medio fa pi piacere vedere un paio di cosce che ascoltare un'opinione intelligente, in pratica tutto si riconduce a questo filo comune.    Si sa che in tv l'audience la fa da padrona, alla donna viene fatto recitare semplicemente il suo ruolo per raggiungere determinati scopi.  Nell'esempio da te citato probabilmente una donna che non avesse espresso simili concetti non avrebbe destato l'attenzione (negativa o positiva che sia,l'importante  che serva a tenere il telespettatore incollato allo schermo) che la trasmissione si era prefissata di ottenere.    Spiace che per lo stereotipo di donna che i palinsesti ci propongono ci possa rimettere,agli occhi dei telespettatori incalliti, un intera categoria.  basterebbe dare alla tv l'importanza che merita: nessuna.|`|2kCOt70Taa	Se l'esempio di donna  quella che c' a forum.. bah... diciamo che il livello  bello basso....|`|5MwQpHQhaa	Erich Fromm,essere o avere.http://digilander.libero.it/filosofiapol... il dramma irrisolto dell'esistenza umana andr den oltre seguendo la linea tracciata fatta solo di apparenze!|`|skzLRNfjaa	In effetti si parla tanto di pari opportunit, ma al momento la societ fa di tutto per dimostrare che donna  solo un bel giocattolino.

Mi sembra che la societ in un dato momento - che non sono ancora riuscita a datare con precisione - abbia fatto dietrofront, o subito una botta d'arresto e tutto ci che era stato ottenuto non tanto in campo strettamente legislativo, ma anche e soprattutto nell'ambito sociale e personale, sia stato dimenticato.    Nessuna delle ragazze con le quali ho frequentato scuole medie e superiori ha mai espresso il desiderio di fare la... soubrette (il GF non c'era ancora, al limite c'era Lorella Cuccarini). Ci siamo laureati tutti negli anni '90 - un vero record in una classe di 23 persone. Le mie coscritte ex compagne di scuola sono tutte professioniste: avvocati, dottori, insegnanti, interpreti, chimiche, farmaciste, veterinarie. La maggior parte di loro ha figli, ma anche non. Tra di noi c'erano molte convinte anti-famiglia convenzionale. Un discorso come "per me niente figli, grazie", veniva ascoltato se non con apprezzamento, almeno con curiosit; adesso suscita in ragazze che hanno 15 anni meno di me un anacronistico "maternalismo". "Poveretta, ma non lo sai che senza figli una donna non si realizzer mai?" "Che dietro ogni grande uomo c' una grande donna?" Ufff.  Ora c' solo da chiedersi se sono stata particolarmente graziata io in quei pochi anni d'oro, o se  davvero un fatto generazionale.    Mi capita dunque di scorazzare in questo sito - come altrove - e leggere commenti sulla verginit come valore inestimabile, sulla dolcezza insita in ogni donna (??), su quanto siano vitali le scarpe di X, sull'inutilit di un'istruzione superiore e sul numero esorbitante di sospette "in cinte". (Ma la pillola, l'hanno sospesa nel 1999?)    Non credere. Qualche volta ci provo a esprimere le mie idee da femminista convinta e tuttora tale, ma mi rispondono con una caterva di "buuuu". Sono out, per nulla fashion e soprattutto non ho ancora scoperto il mio lato femminile, dolce ma graffiante, ammiccante ma arrendevole, sexy ma vergine, intellettuale ma alla buona, compiacente ma arrivista.

O_o|`|kmSQnX6xaa	Guarda, sono anch'io d'accordo con te, pur essendo donna.  La parit esiste e deve esistere, ma in maniera sensata. Possibile che ad esempio la donna, che per natura  portatrice di vita, diventi portatrice di morte arruolandosi nell'esercito?  Possibile che le laureate debbano avere come unica via al successo la TV e gli specchietti per le allodole che ci vengono proposti?  Della parit dei diritti abbiamo fatto un baluardo per giustificare le nostre scelte assurde e le nostre idiozie, quando avremmo invece potuto amplificare la nostra dignit facendo valere i nostri cervelli e non i nostri sederi in mostra.  Le "femmine" di cui parli sono appunto femmine. Le "donne" vere sono una cosa diversa, sono quelle che difendono la loro reputazione senza degradarsi o vendersi.

Flashing yellow means slow down and proceed with caution.     A solid yellow means stop, unless you are so close you can not do so safely.    However, there may be another issue which involves a green light. If traffic was heavy, and you entered the intersection while there was traffic stopped ahead, preventing you from clearing the intersection before it turned red, that is a violation. Green means "proceed when clear".     Many patrol vehicles have cameras, you may want to check with the department and see if the incident was caught on tape.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Yellow means slow down prepare to stop. There's no way you passed the line and it was green and turned red before you got to the other side. Impossible.  The lights are set so if you're doing the speed limit and it is still green when you pass the line, you'll make it easily.    If at any time the llight turns red and any part of your car is still in the intersection, it's running a red light, which is what happened to you. It was obviously yellow when you passed the line or you wouldn't be asking this question. Yellow means slow down and prepare to stop, not hurry up and get through.    PS - Sorry. The light is green when you pass the line, you make it through. Cops don't pull you over for being in the section on a yellow light. What does your ticket say? You're not telling us everything. If cops pulled people over for it being yellow, there wouldn't be enough time in the day to write all the tickets.|`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	I would have fought that ticket. If you were in the middle of the intersection you cant stop for the light.|`|MbssN5dcaa	Duh!!!!  Please tell me you don't have a driver's license.|`|1XqmVsgwaa	If the light was green when you entered the intersection, I would take the case to court. There is no way officers should issuing citations for that.      The only thing I can think of, you said the above intersection as neck to neck. Did you get stuck in the middle of the intersection while the light cycled? Meaning, where you holding up traffic? Many cities do have anti-gridlock laws that prevent you for entering the intersection to avoid having to wait for you a red when you know you will be stuck there.|`|xEJYJHECaa	I got pulled over for the same thing a few months ago.  From the police officers "prospective" your car had not crossed the white line before the yellow light came on.   Once your car has passed the white line you are now in the middle of the intersection and therefore must turn or your car will cause accidents with on coming traffic.  Your lucky!  My ticket was $80 and what really makes me upset is that I saw a cop do the same thing I did the day after I got pulled over for it.  I HATE COPS!!!!         The yellow signal tells you that your turn is coming to an end so slow down to a stop, or if past the white line make your turn quickly!!|`|7Z9U4f5paa	I agree with rock. Yellow means slow down and if you were trying to beat that yellow light going thru the intersection, then the officer has the right to give you a ticket. So, next time try driving a little slower when you come upon a yellow light so you'll have time to stop then you won't get a ticket ok.|`|G3hTM9qeaa	It sounds like you're not explaining the situation correctly. If you're traveling at 42mph through an intersection you are only inside the intersection for about half of a second and no police officer is going to give you a ticket for running a green light. Now, if traffic was neck and neck like you say and you entered the intersection on a green light but had traffic blocking your lane on the other side of it, you must have been inside the intersection through the yellow light and into the red. If that is the case, your ticket was for blocking traffic. Whatever you did, the officer decided that it was unsafe and THAT is why you got a ticket.
uh2bkRrFaa	Um, the age of consent is NOT 16 like the other idiot is guessing. It's 18. Your "boyfriend" can be arrested for statuatory rape. You're under age and he's over. That's the law.    You've "been together" for 2 years and never met? I wouldn't call that "being together."  Remember. If he's caught, he will be a registered sex offender for the rest of his life, even though you're only a year apart. This actually happens a lot in the states.    And the other moron who says you have be 21 to rent a room is also guessing. You dont' have to be 21, you have to be 18. Your "boyfriend" can rent the room, you don't have to be there when he does it. Just remember, if you get caught, he's in a world of trouble. You won't be.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	The age of consent is 16, you're 17. No one has to even see you, he gets the room. You're just paranoid.|`|vFvI16P7aa	Both of you could get in trouble for renting the room without being 21 (I'm assuming someone would be committing fraud to prove that they are "21") and they may ask you to leave after finding out you are not 18 and you are not with your parent, but you wouldn't get in trouble for the sex issue.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Yes.|`|5Qo6OWNzaa	Not for sleeping over, but if the room was rented fraudulently then they could call for police assistance to boot you out.|`|E7c1ZvR2aa	Yes|`|G3hTM9qeaa	I doubt they would just call the police on you but most places won't even let you get a room until you're 18. Even if you pay upfront for however long you need the room, you'll still have to sign some kind of agreement in regards to being liable for any damages you cause to the room. You can't sign any legal contracts until you're 18 in any state in the US.|`|VC8ivJHjaa	Wait a few months until you turn 18. If he is over 18 (adult) and you are under 18 (minor) he could be prosecuted for statutory rape. Consent is not an issue. Adult + Minor + Sex (Consensual or Nonconsensual) = Statutory Rape.    Why rush? You've been together over 2 years and have never met before? Just wait until you are both adults then have fun. (Don't forget to use protection)

You keep making up all these excuses like that means something. What it boils down to is your irresponsible and you want people to feel sorry for you. I suspect this is a reoccurring issue with you you're whole life. You better get it over with and start learning how to be a responsible adult and quit making excuses for everything. It may sound harsh to you but no responsible person reads your story and thinks "oh you poor poor person." All  we see is an irresponsible person who wants people to give her yet another break.|`|3cf54b98aab3159bdd02ab505ad9368eaa	Ok.. lets cut to the chase here.    1)  For whatever reason you DID miss the first court date.  It is YOUR responsibility to show up or confirm a dismissal and you did neither so, for whatever reasons you did not keep that promise.    2)  You have missed a second one.. which will demonstrate to the court that you have a pattern for this .. that is not a good thing    3)  You are on probation !.. Good grief.. knowing that you STILL Missed the showup !    4)  Stress, appointments, whatever.. you are a 'grownup'  - right?    Act like one  YOU.. and no one else need to manage your time and your appointments... especially ones that can affect you in such a radical manner.    So.. what will happen?    a)  The judge, if he reviews your records, will likely issue a bench warrent for your arrest. That means that if you are stopped for anything (broken tail light, security check, etc..) you will be arrested.  Your odds of a decent bail are pretty slim since your history says you will be a no show.  The court will likely set a high bail and a bondsman will either not be willing to post for you or will charge an even higher premium (normally 10% of the bail) so you get doubly scr*wed)    b)  Once you are back in the system your probation will be reviewed and it may be determined that you need to serve out the remainder of that sentence... maybe not.    c)  On top of that, your new offences (failure to appear, etc..) may result in new sentences,  fines, etc..    What can you do?    You need to get a lawyer to go in there and help you settle things and bring you up current with your legal obligations.. then you need to cowboy up and deal with them.    sorry.. but thats the black and white.. the lawyer cann deal with the grey areas for you.    .|`|zokJMPBAaa	i'm from virginia,try to get in contact with your lawyer,you are in a bind  and if things work out try living a clean life|`|hpYwgDyeaa	You're tangled in the system now. You have to quit comming up with excuses on why you can't make a court date and focus on the crap you're in. I been there and I know how scared you are. I would suggest driving down to your lawyers office and wait there until they get in. Figure out a plan to get your head above water and stick to it! You might want to start thinking who's gonna take care of your kids in case you have to serve some time. The courts don't want to hear your sob story about your kids, they'll just put them in foster care. Focus, focus, focus. Cut away the "dead" people in your life like drunks and druggies.
3cf54b98aab3159bdd02ab505ad9368eaa	By locked up, I assume you mean in a mental health facility.  The answer is yes.      If your P.O. feels that your actions are a threat to your safety or others he/she can place you on a 72 hour hold at a county facility during which time they will evaluate you, your actions, and possible outcomes.  If the medics feel that you are a threat to yourself, that hold will be extended.via a court order.    But the bottom line is that it is plain WRONG to be into cutting and self abuse of any kind.  You know it, and prob. 99% of the rest of the world knows it.    'Getting help' is a real generic term that can range from professional counseling to talking to your goldfish in the morning.  If you are still into cutting (whatever) then the help is not sufficient.  Go talk to someone .. hell, talk to your PO honestly that may actually be a good start.. but find out WHY you have such a low self esteem that you need to punish yourself like that.    (ok.,.  enough of my soapbox)... get help and stay well  you owe yourself more then an armful of scars.    .|`|VSCYTZ38aa	I don't think they could put you in jail, but if they think you are a danger to yourself they could have you committed to a metal hospital.|`|iFYDJyIZaa	Well, they do arrest you if you attempt to commit suicide, but I'm pretty sure they'd only admit you to a hospital/psych ward in this case.

XA69SIvnaa	The 'physical tests' you are asking about is probably the PT test. For Airborne School at Benning it's 180 points passing all events, which is the bare minimum and is not hard whatsoever. 4 mile run at a 9 min pace, which is easy after being in the Army for more than a month. You have to do a 10 second flexed arm hang too, which is a joke.     The hardest physical (and mental) part is actually jumping out of the airplane, some people get injured (broken legs, ankles, etc.). So pay attention when they are explaining how to correctly make a landing and also when you are running through your ground drills.|`|AA11826806	Hey Dude,  If your talking about military training, the answer is yes...ask anyone who's been through it.(FCTSS)=Feet Calf Thigh Seat Shoulders.

SJ11pyCXaa	It depends on your job, rank, and the needs of the Army.    Speaking for commissioned officers, they move to another duty station around every three years or so once they complete their initial training. They must also attend training such as the Captain's Career Course (5-6 months) and Command & Staff College (1 year).     Many attend Graduate School to get their Master's Degree at some point. Some may also attend the War College. Some may become faculty at a university's ROTC program or at West Point for 3 years.    Keep in mind that there are some duty stations that have set times. Honduras, Korea, and Sinai are typically one-year tours.|`|2Hlctljgaa	That depends on where you are stationed and if it is unaccompanied or accompanied or not.|`|yvoGbxshaa	usually until you put in for a transfer Ive seen some people stay at one duty station their whole career|`|vgKYYfgHaa	depends on the branch of service and whether it is continental US or not. usually 18-24 Months|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	lee2332 must only know people with short careers.  In the Army a normal tour is about 3 years at one duty station.  An unaccompanied overseas tour is about a year.  Having said that you could be moving more frequently to attend schooling or special assignments.  And don't forget about a combat deployment.    Now, if you went in as an infantryman, had basic and AIT at Benning and your first assignment there and then got out you would have had one duty station.  But that's only if you punch out at the first opportunity.    I was in for four years and had three duty assignments.|`|QTIDsfheaa	A normal stay at an Army Station is approx. 3 years long. Keep in mind, you can be stop lossed or come up on special orders or change units within the post, all of which can prolong your stay.  A reenlistment can also affect it. You're at the needs of the Army.

mr8isJoZaa	You need a parent or guardian approval at 17, for any military branch.  And what is this nonsense about doing Army at 17 and going Marines when you graduate high school, sounds like your buddies is telling you some stories.

Active duty members serve eight year contracts, usually four or five (depending on your contract) years of full time active duty and three or four years of inactive reserve time where you're basically on standby.    Reserve members also serve eight year contracts, six in the reserves and two inactive.  They go to boot camp, combat training, and their MOS school just like active duty Marines.  Then they go back to their reserve unit, usually in their hometown, and train one weekend a month and 2-3 weeks in the summer.  Reserve units can be called into active duty at any time.    You can't join one service then jump to another.|`|aQ8EK9hraa	my brother enlisted in the army at 17 and celebrated his 18th birthday in basic. because he was under 18 and enlisted under infantry he didnt get his orders until after his birthday.    my boyfriend enlisted at 17 for the marines and had no problems with recruiters he also is enlisted for infantry. you can go active duty for any branch i enlist in the air force and im 17 as well.    reserve means if they need you so to speak active duty means you go to work everyday as a soldier,marines ect.|`|B2pOra7laa	hmmm well i have a friend who goes to my school who is 17 (we are in jrotc together) he is doing delayed entry (which is a program under which an individual may enlist in a Reserve or Inactive Component of a military service and specify a future reporting date for entry on active duty in the Active Component that would coincide with availability of training spaces and with personal plans such as high school graduation.)  for the marines, but ultimately the decision is up to you i think either one is good
is5DpAjEaa	As someone else said, Special Forces is an asset only the US Army has. It's a unit title, the general term is Special Operations.     Let me clear up what could cause confusion from Jim's post.  Women are  NOT allowed to serve on Special Operations helicopters, formerly MH-53s now CV-22s.  Ie, no gunners, no Flight engineers. Women can, however serve in Rescue Squadrons as gunners/FEs on HH-60s and work with Pararescue that way.     As has already been mentioned. Pararescue, Combat Control, Special Operations Weather, and some TACPs are the only Special Operations the US Air Force has. These are all direct combat jobs and therefore by law women are not allowed.    There are plenty of other jobs out there that would probably be a challenge to you. If the AF is your interest, try looking into SERE .. it isn't Special Operations, but it's an interesting careerfield a nd offers some pretty neat assignments. EOD is also an option if you don't mind dealing with unexploded ordnance and IEDs.     If you want to be outdoors, hiking, climbing, doing physical things .. look into SERE.      If you want to be outdoors blowing things up, giving yourself a mental and intellectual challenge, look into EOD.    Both careerfields are good to go and both offer a lot of options when you get out of the military. EOD moreso than SERE.    Good luck.|`|kbz5S3waaa	there are, but they're for men only  Combat Control, and Pararescue|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Yes and yes.

It is not an entry level job, you enlist as Weather and then volunteer for Combat Weather after about 1.5 years in the Air Force.    Women are allowed into Combat Weather, but thier duty stations are limited.    IE: they cannot deploy with other spe ops teams.    But they do deploy, and work from base stations, recieving the info from the combat weather team on the ground.|`|0pXBYo4paa	Pararescue and Combat Controllers, but I am not sure on women joining.|`|8g8zm8jaaa	The only special forces I've heard of that has recruited women is the British SRR.|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	"Special Forces" actually refers only the US Army Special Operators.  "Special Operations Forces" properly refers to the other services.  Yes, the USAF has SOF:  Spec Ops Aviation:  MH53 (soon to be MV-22), HH60, MC/HC/AC130s.  Special Tactics:  Spec Ops Weather, Combat Controller, and PJ  Special Tactics is off-limits to women, however Spec Ops Aviation is clearly open.  Sorry there are NO women in the IDF in combat roles, certainly not in Spec Ops.  Been there, seen that.  EDIT:  Allow me to clarify a common misconception:  Combat Weather is NOT Spec Ops Weather.  They undergo different training and support different missions.  Women cannot be Spec Ops Weather, though they CAN join "Combat Wx".|`|0szdPqI0aa	The air force does have special tactics forces.  They are :  Combat controllers  Para rescue (pj)  Special operations weather    and a select few who are tacp's are considered special ops.    These jobs though are not open to women. Like pretty much all combat jobs in the us military, they are not open to women.  Even if they were, becoming an air force special forces officer is very hard.  there are not many special tactics officers in the air force.    Since you are in ROTC though for the Air Force, You may be able to become a special forces pilot?  or a fighter pilot?  i believe those are open to women.|`|ABTvd68Caa	Para rescuers and Combat Controllers are the Special Forces in the Air Force.

teKeLxX2aa	Well, I am an MA so I can't really speak on behalf of the Army MP's and what their training entails.     With regards to the Navy, they send boot camp graduates to one of two A schools (one in Texas on an Air Force base, the other at Dam Neck Virginia). There you learn all the basic skills necessary to become certified as an MA, before being stationed somewhere (where you will more likely than not receive additional training depending on what they want you to do). Training is about 7 or 8 weeks long (I'm unsure if they've changed it much since I went) and you cover pretty much the basics that all military police have to go through, such as: lethal and nonlethal weapons, defense tactics, military law, etc. There's a lot of civilian police who do the Reserves, and most of them say that civilian training is better than MP or MA training (but most police academy's are 6 months long).     You never mentioned if you want to go Active or Reserve/Guard. If you do the Army or any of its components, you're guaranteed to get deployed sooner rather than later (I know an MP in the National Guard, and her unit is already getting deployed to Iraq after only being in for about a year). Most Active Duty MA's have been getting deployed to Bahrain or Kuwait for the most part. I have an MA friend in the Reserves, and he's been sent to Afghanistan.     If you do Active Duty for at least three years, the new Post 9/11 GI Bill will cover all tuition expenses for you to get your bachelors. Otherwise, doing the Reserves or Guard have their own educational incentives, which should go a long way towards making your degree more affordable.     Feel free to email me if you have any additional questions.

lAsbD5B7aa	I would not worry about it.  They will get you into shape in boot camp.    But if you really want to..    Run, never walk. 30 minute breakfast, lunch and dinner breaks.    Get 8 hours of sleep, be fully active the rest of the time.    Get used to being yelled at.|`|VofjJ35caa	1 - Physical fitness is the obvious one, but not the most important. Learn to do your laundry, iron, fold clothes and socks and generally clean - it's better you learn your life skills now than in boot camp. Work experience will make you more tolerant to stress. If you get the opportunity, acquaint yourself with foot drill and the table of Enlisted and Officer ranks.    2 - How fit are you, exactly? A workout for someone trying to get fit enough to join the military is different from one training to get more of an edge before they go to boot camp. If you're relatively new to the fitness thing, a basic program to improve your pushups could consist of six sets of 8/10/20 pushups three times a week - don't always go for the max set, and gradually increase the amount you do each week as you get stronger.    3 - Just choose a few strokes you like and do brisk laps, with rests in between. Swim tests in the military are not difficult - as long as you can swim laps and tread water for a few minutes, you'll probably manage alright.|`|91de20c91e1b0ea1a6448022652ff606aa	Oh jeez, lots of things you can do to be prepared  here is my advice, go buy this book    Ultimate Basic Training guide book  By michael volkin    Its a wonderfull book to follow and put my far ahead of my peers during basic.    Working out, follow what the book says or    mondays, running jogging at least 20-25 mins  tuesdays- crunches, pushups, leg lifts, sit-ups, squats, etc...    Wednesday-sprints, 400 meters is best but 200 would work, sprint 400 as fast as you can, briskly walk 400 more, then repeat 4-5 times    Thursdays, same as tuesday    Fridays, long run days, aim to jog 60 mins today    saturdays, either repeat Tues-thursday schedule or more running lol    sundays-off    buy the book!

You all volunteered.|`|LEBV1FPuaa	I work at HRC and there no requests until April.|`|0f0dac4f4bfb6a4b2d01df90fd84b3ffaa	Hmm, stuff like this makes me glad I got a medical discharge and thus wasn't put in IRR. I would go of course if I was called up, but that doesn't mean I'm not glad I got out of it.     I can't find anything on this, although Bush probably authorized such a call up and not Obama, since it would take some time for such an order to be carried out.    You wouldn't happen to be in the Marines would you? Because they put out several call up of IRR forces for next year.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_...  Again though, none of this Obama's doing, he wasn't in office when the decision was made.
lAsbD5B7aa	The court does not enforce judgements.    But the person can have the Sherriff enforce it.|`|l2MjVVpRaa	In most cases, you're not allowed to make payments.    If you fail to pay as directed by the court, the other party can file a 'writ of execution' against you and the constable/sherif will come to your home to sell personal property until the judgement is satisfied.    If the other party is accepting your partial payments, they are allowed to charge interest... any judgement gives the winning party interest on the judgement.    Good luck|`|z88IMXNFaa	You can pay in installments and the judgment will earn interest at a pretty high rate until the judgment is paid in full.  It's typical to work out a payment plan with the holder of the judgment.    The holder of the judgment can garnish your wages, seize your bank accounts and file a lien on your property.|`|LQpU6Zd8aa	Contact the person who the funds are supposed to go to, do it in writing, offer a fair amount to be paid each pay check. Or if they had a lawyer contact him lawyers are more willing to work out payment plans than the actual person who is owed money. My personal theory is..It never hurts to ask.  I know because some hospital bills piled up when I was first paralyzed and the lawyer for the hospital (who won a judgment) has let me make payments I can afford whereas the hospital wanted it all at once not caring if I lived in a cardboard box because I wouldn't have money for housing etc if I even attempted to meet their stupid demands.
AA10123414	Signed at City, State this 4th day of February, 2009|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	I think that where the time goes ex.  signed at 2pm, this 4th dy of February, 2009|`|Y6odIQgJaa	It is requesting a place, for example, Newport Beach, California.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	You can probably ask the people who gave you the form, or the people representing the place or thing you are signing up for.

uh2bkRrFaa	No, you should be fine. They will ask you about those on your polygraph and you should pass perfectly. They're actually more worried about your credit background if you can believe that. If you're credit is okay, you sound like you should have no problems.
sOaqLLS6aa	yea good point|`|knzJtfIQaa	that's really horrible and sad|`|knO3cmiKaa	Honestly, i prefer not to think about such gruesome things|`|sZMa0s7Baa	That does sound fishy.|`|ATCodK2vaa	I think it's suspicious.  Front load machines aren't that short and no washing machine starts automatically just be pressing start--you have to set the temperature and the cycle first!|`|1c74cc7ee9876780e94d288d920e0d0aaa	It is a horrible tragedy.  It is also fishy, because with my front load machine, it does not "fill up", it gets the clothes wet, but if put on pause can be opened at any point.  Also it has to be put on a setting to start.  They also make child locks on them, so yes, it is not right.
V4BaRBtnaa	no, your tax refund is a confidential matter between you and the IRS.    Only other government agencies can levy your tax refund.    Note, however, your land lady and/or legal counsel can attach or place a lien against your unprotected assets.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	they cannot attach your refund but will go after your bank accounts  The longer you delay paying the more you owe|`|AA11481889	Um...if someone has a judgment against you ...they can file a wage garnishment and take it from your paycheck.    If you own someone money...don't be a douche...pay what you owe.    ***********  I stand by my final statement.    Don't be a douche.    Pay what you owe.  And don't be surprised if the sherrif shows up to serve you with a wage garnishment and your paycheck suddenly shrinks to half it's size.
mh0QRDE9aa	Yes, to being a police cadet.  You have a police academy that you have to attend in order to become a policeman. I believe you have to take a civil service test also.   Age -  I have seen a guy of 38yrs old hired, so that one you will have to check on it. It might vary on what city you live in.|`|gIwe9Ctfaa	I read somewhere that there is a cap. 24 is what I remmeber, however, that does seem very low!   may need to look at someone else's answer
NFiiIQcxaa	Financial loss?  Claim it on your insurance.  If they catch the person, he may be ordered to pay restitution or return your property.  If you have physical injuries, you may be able to apply to your state's crime victims' compensation program.
5ac2dCxJaa	Uh, they kick in the door, beat the s it outta anybody that doesn't cow down to them, process you for distribution and resisting arrest, you go to some rape room prison and perform slave labor for the U.S. prison industrial complex.    Cause it's a free country.|`|57e2f61534cb280dd3b9f69e82a68f67aa	If you are worried the police will come, then under the fact pattern you described your best is to drop the large party idea     If the police respond find booze and underage people drinking at your house, you will be charged with delivering booze to underage kids, even if you did not buy the booze its your house where it was served to underage, and yes I know you are also underage but it will not stop the DA from charging you, then what? You have a permanent record that all future employers can access|`|oFcrglxzaa	if you serve alcohol and someone gets drunk and causes a scene or gets hurt, your in trouble and if your parents own the house they can be arrested and sued, what ever happens to anyone at your party ( in your house) becomes your problem
xagIY1Quaa	Yes I do feel disgusted.  I think we should force them all to immigrate to another country.    (Hey either you make it about immigration--or you are reportable.)    So I say make sagging pants a DEPORTABLE crime.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	What does that have to do with immigration?    And as long as everything is covered, I don't care.  Perhaps you have not seen the new style.  They have gone to very baggy pants, designed to look like they are hanging off their butt, but isn't really.      The designers have gone to extending the *ss portion to be bigger, so it gets to the waist and still looks like it is half off the *ss.  Then the wearer just wears a long shirt to cover up the fact that it reaches the waist; so they fit in with the law without actually giving in to your whining.      Rebellion at its best.  Ain't America grand?|`|pnpkJKvpaa	We have so many bigger problems than this...|`|XwtmNIMOaa	No|`|TnnFTLQXaa	I don;t mind baggy pants, but if I can see your boxers, or your dick or *** if you go commando or wear your boxes low (I've seen a few dicks before from low pants), then yes its indecency.     what I don't get is the obsession of wearing your pants low like that, having them around your knees. does any one know where that came from.    its from a Chicago jail, to show that you were some one's bi.tch. I really hope that not all those people are gay.|`|fQgbBx7caa	They don't know they look like complete morons....|`|YTJ5Upneaa	yes. I find it repulsive. True there are bigger problems than this, but it does show the decline in morals of our country.|`|QWRKg7eLaa	No. Deport Martini.|`|dLsx3fKuaa	Of all the problems facing the United States, sagging is probably the smallest iota of a problem facing us today..
eulMjLtPaa	You have to apply for the one that reflects the age you are when applying.      Your passport will be good for five years.

4vLt3SqFaa	I am a republican who didn't vote for Obama and does not think his plans or ideas are good for the country.  However, I also think that thee will be no made up impeachment charges. If Obama get caught doing something way over the line then perhaps, but I would be surprised.  I expect Obama to self destruct.  I also expect his real trouble will come form the extreme left wing of the democratic party rather than my side of the aisle.  Can we say Jimmy Carter repeated, just under harder circumstances.    No one would eb happier than i if I am totally wrong about him, then again pigs might fly one day - but i doubt either of the above will happen.  What have we seen so far:    He has basically surrendered the war on terror    He is being completely rolled by house Democratic leadership - Pelosi    His buy American idea hit mild opposition in europe and he he folded again.    He picked a fight with Rush - a radio pundit and helped Rush while demeaning his own power.  Come on!  A president has more influence in his little finger than Rush will ever have and instead of ignoring him, Obama elevates Rush to the level of equality with the president.  What a foolish, amateur mistake.    His executive order about abortion is very unpopularr according to polling data and yet for a guy who claimed the issue was above his pay grade he acted with almost no consideration.    Over all his performance as president has been dismal at best so far.|`|AA11086243	I'm sure cons will try and make something up...    I'm sure we'll all get a good laugh out of it...|`|81be3df3d8de061d2dc682fbb8dc28b3aa	im guessing impeached.  .....|`|6JXrlnYsaa	And EXACTLY what crime are you accusing him of, that you think the House would see as grounds for impeachment?|`|TBjIJnWvaa	If bush didnt get impeached.. there is no way in hell Obama would be...that is of course if he didnt do anything horribly wrong...  If he becomes impeached because of the cons unsatisfaction i would become very noisy indeed...|`|DSSio06daa	It is starting to turn against him as we all knew it would after the "honeymoon" was over.  That idiot dude who runs ACORN was on the news tonight literally strong arming congress and the president and saying it was his way or the hi-way.  Cant somebody off that miserable mob man...god, no end to this.    He said Obama and others made promisses and if they don't keep them, they will work to unseat them...think that has anything to do with the four billion slated for them?...    I wante d to give Obama a chance, but he has many debts to pay for many promises, he will be in trouble, soon.|`|jbE1nWqzaa	I am no god and can't predict future.I would hope he completes his term with honesty.|`|mmFz64MFaa	he might just retier going wtf was I thinking after 4 years     and then his adoring cult fans will stand out front of his house taking pictures and fainting     and we all go no more black people|`|AA10185707	My guess: The republicans will attempt a pitiful impeachment on allegations that Obama lied about leaving the toilet seat up. They will rehire Ken Starr (the prosecuting attorney for Bill Clinton) and call Rotor Rooter as a witness to this impeachable offense.|`|Eo8I3fbnaa	this is a dumb question. sometimes i think people like you really hate america.|`|VtXvmOIXaa	When he investigates the corrupt Bush administration I'd back him all the way!|`|xThpp6e9aa	No.  if bush didn't in 2 terms, there isnt much of a chance of Obama getting impeached.  he might resign but not impeached|`|5YTkGB5yaa	As long as he doesn't visit Dallas I'm sure he'll make it 4 years.|`|nTzTIrataa	I think he'll have two terms.  People will see the economy and international relations improving and alternative energy starting to be developed more seriously, and won't be willing to give up that progress to vote for whoever the Republicans run in 2012.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	He will be there 8 years and leave the nation wanting more.|`|92gN7RVPaa	I, nor anyone else here knows the answer to that, why would you even ask such a question?|`|v1dnnMQuaa	Hehe, you should write a book of Republican fairy tales.

Reading from Clinton's revisionist history book?|`|lU5mdniUaa	stop the presses stop printing more money when we are bankrupt already accept that we are down and out in the usa and its been since 1913 federal reserve created and 1971 going off the gold standard which did it|`|caen2K64aa	Regarding the economy, President Obama is not about quick fixes.  He even stated the economy will get worse before it gets better.  We must remember that he has to make very hard, very tough decisions.  If any one of us were the president instead of Barack, would all the mess be cleared up in less than a month?    People are expecting way too much from President Obama precisely because he is African-American.  He cannot please everyone.  That's humanly impossible.  We must be patient and work with him, not against him.    I wonder what John McCain would have done if he were the president.|`|0eFSeap5aa	Obama isn't going to fix the mess Bush made because    a) The mess has been coming for a long time.  That Bush was in part the agent of this does not alter the fact that larger and deeper forces have carried us to this point.      b) Obama will not have the power to make the world in a different way any more than Bush had to make it the way it is.  He too will deal with forces far beyond his control    c) What things Obama can control he is doing wrong.  What we have is a mis-allocation of resources taken to an unsustainable end.  Housing prices can rise only as much as do incomes to pay for them.  When millions of people direct resources to consumption of bigger homes rather than investment to create the wealth to support those bigger homes, a crash becomes inevitable.    d) The federal reserve is not handicapped from intervening effectively.  Their intervention is part of what drove this crisis.  Greenspan forgot all he knew of sound money once he had the power to corrupt money.  Bernanke boldly stated he could prevent a recession by just printing more money.  He never considered the far end of an over leveraged financial system was a collapse that would cause a recession anyway.      e) The solution to this isn't going to come easy, and it's not going to be Obama who hikes across the water to save us, we're going to have to do it ourselves.  It starts by saving more than we earn, which will be a departure for a lot of people and for the country as a whole.  Misappropriating a trillion dollars to reward political constituencies is only going to delay when we begin to fix things.  The repair of this mess awaits whomever will replace Obama.|`|o0UD2YvPaa	GEEZ, here we go again....NOW pay really close attention because I am going to spell this out as simply as I can.    The economy began going down the tubes after Hurricane katrina hit, because no one in the govt. president or congress did nothing to stop the oil companies from gouging us sending gas prices to over $3.00 a gallon...notice I said this is where it began.  Now because of Katrina, The democrats took control of congress, did prices gas prices change on their watch......NOOOOOO, it continued to rise to over $4.00/gallon during the last 2 years....no one in the government would remotely acknowledge that we were in a recession..."we the people" knew we were in a recession, because we already knew that we stopped buy things we didn't need. which puts every one from teh department store, all the way down to the manufracter or grower.  In the meantime, fannie and freddie are loaning money to people that they know cannot pay the loans back, these people are buying  homes that their mortgage is running them at a minimum of $1500.  In order to make these kids of payments, people are going to have to make well over $10 per hour and 2 people working......people are living beyond thier means, and when you do this you get yourself into a credit mess where you cannot pay your bills. so the factors are now, $3 & $4 a gallon for gas since 2006 (dems are elected to congress and are in control from this point, 2005 gas prices dropped back down to $2 a gallon) we have congress knowing fannie and freddie are loaning money like crazy and they all know that these people cant afford to pay it back, but congress lets them do it, refusing that the republicians and president bush put regulations on fannie and freddie, to stop the housing market from crashing and these lenders from the inevitable of going under as they have done.  So the democrats got it thier way, they created this failed economy to get a dem. elected as president, and it worked like a charm.     as far as debt.....the govt. has always been in debt and will always be in debt, it will never be paid off......but this is not going to stop the dems. from spending our tax dollars on stupid unnecessary items.  There is nothing in this bill that is going to help you are me, but it will help big business, and hollywood....those who pushed to get Obama elected.....Obama owes holllywood and he is now paying them all back with our tax dollars.|`|5070437d89b5a5c0baa621683e5f89f9aa	Jezz, I was going to give him though the weekend - you're generous!|`|BpcgaJd4aa	What mess is Obama fixing? The way it looks he's creating one.|`|ETCZVragaa	Bush did not make this crisis. It was the people who are involved in the Stock Market, bush had nothing to do with it...|`|oOzX2767aa	Are you really serious?  You really think that after, since everyone is calling it Bush's mess that took 8 years to fulfill,  that it will only take Obama 3 weeks to fix it, you must be delusional.|`|mHdKANPNaa	I'm tired of this, Bush didn't create the health care problem, he didn't sign bills like NAFTA that protected U.S. interests and somewhat caused the increase of illegal immigrants, he didn't promote globalization that caused the U.S. to become more of an importer than an exporter. Take a close look at Bill Clinton if you want a President to blame for this.|`|YSuc7L8taa	Back to school Padds.  The Democratic controlled Congress made this mess.  Only Congress can spend money, not the President!|`|EEPWlYleaa	Give him two weeks and if he cannot handle it, put in Ray Nagin.|`|gnIEDg6maa	We will give him time and although I blame Bush for much, I do not blame him for NAFTA,  I agree with the above. I am a Democrat and  I love Clinton but he is behind NAFTA.  It sounds good but must not have worked the way they wanted.  Did we know that so many jobs would be exported?  I do not want any of my food to come from China!  They don't have any reliable food inspectors.  Read the labels and do not buy it.  I love the terrific, hard goods from China and the prices are unbelievable.  I would really miss it but we need to bite the bullet and bring manufacturing jobs home and most of all do not import food from China and India.  Canada and  Europe, OK.  Bring jobs home.  Stay strong, Obama.  End the war in Iraq.  What is this about fighting for our freedom. Our freedom was not in jeopardy .  Iraqis were not invading us.  What are they talking about?  We thought they had nuclear weapons, probably because we gave them some when iraq was fighting our enemy, Iran. That  is why they were so sure they had nuclear weapons.  As soon we found we were wrong or at least,  as soon as Hussein was captured, we should have got out.  We caused more deaths than he ever did, didn't we.  Over 4,000 of our soldiers and God knows how many Iraqis and other nationalities.

Also, immediately, the legal tender laws would be repealed and gold and silver would be permitted to be traded and saved as currency, with no 'gain' to be taxed if the dollar goes down.

The Federal Reserve Act, passed by Congress in 1913, laid the foundation for the creation of a privately owned and controlled central bank and gave private bankers the power to control the nations money supply.    Nearly 100 years later, the role the central bank has played in the financial scandal has been widely reported in the mainstream. Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, once heralded as the maestro, has been feeling the heat for supporting the deregulation of financial institutions and flooding markets with cheap dollars.|`|8OaAmwq8aa	It shouldn't.

The bureau of printing and engraving handles the money supply. That is a government agency. The government prints the treasury bills from them, gives it to the fed, and the fed takes these and gives it to the Bureau of printing and engraving and has them print the money. Then they charge us interest for this.....    WE can still set reserve requirements for banks.

This places the creation of currency back into the hands of Congress, put the currency back on the gold standard, which limits Congress to a set limit of what they can spend, and also the banks on what they can loan.

Then they announce that we can pay our taxes with it. The Fed will die on it's own.    Trouble is, are we sure that the government can manage our money better than bankers? It's one of the oldest arguments there is in this country.    EDIT  The Federal Reserve is the third central bank we've tried in this country. During our first 130 years or so, there was much debate over the pros and cons of central banking. Jackson's re-election campaign slogan was "Jackson and NO BANK" in a battle to disassemble the 2nd Bank of the United States.     While bankers are the most cold-hearted leacherous creatures known to man, they do understand their business. The politicians control the world, but the bankers control the politicians. If we are going to allow the Fed to continue to manage our assets, we are going to need to regulate their predatory behavior--knock them down several notches as the saying goes. They will certainly fight back.    If we remove them from the picture entirely, be prepared for wide-spread misery in our country for untold years, including starvation and other forms of poverty and dispair. They've had their claws into us for nearly 100 years straight, and they won't go quietly!    Years ago I watched a 3.5 hour documentary titled "The Money Masters" on video tape. It was the most eye-opening look at the birth, growth and current state of global finance that I've seen to date. It is certainly not something the bankers want you to see. It was on YouTube in the early days [of YouTube] but it has been replaced with some other video of the same name. Seemingly, the bankers do spend some amount of time protecting themselves. Their efforts to supress information not to their liking are also evidenced at Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Money_M...    If you are truly interested in economics, global finance or power and control in general, you really need to see this video!  I found a partial transcript at the Koz: http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/12/7/...  The first 59 minutes is back up on YouTube, but poor quality: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnwLgrSJZ...  There is another YouTube user with the entire video broken down into 22 parts.    And here's a short blurb about the video: THE MONEY MASTERS is a 3 1/2 hour non-fiction, historical documentary that traces the origins of the political power structure that rules our nation and the world today. The modern political power structure has its roots in the hidden manipulation and accumulation of gold and other forms of money.  The development of fractional reserve banking practices in the 17th century brought to a cunning sophistication the secret techniques initially used by goldsmiths fraudulently to accumulate wealth. With the formation of the privately-owned Bank of England in 1694, the yoke of economic slavery to a privately-owned "central" bank was first forced upon the backs of an entire nation, not removed but only made heavier with the passing of the three centuries to our day. Nation after nation, including America, has fallen prey to this cabal of international central bankers.|`|3785eeef30e9bd9c24c59001fddabeb6aa	I'd say that we'd need to introduce a competing gold/silver standard currency that could be used and exchanged for the fiat currency.
dO09dGk1aa	Because they're idiots.     Being in the military, I realize over and over that the far left don't give a rats ***. They cut our budgets, and they try to make everything more difficult.    Bunch of jerks. =(|`|jFxMRMkTaa	coz they know that their troops are tough as nails!!! innocent civilians usually are not|`|AA11916920	Because their troops only matter to them when they are needed.

Innocents are not soldiers, do not (usually) have weapons, and are most likely women or children caught in the middle of a terrible thing.  I would rather see a soldier die than an innocent child die, but if there is a god, bless all innocents.|`|Iw6vqJd8aa	Because it makes for better news. The talking heads on the news shows and in politics are just wanting something to get their face on the tube. Think about, which is better and more disheartening, pictures and film clips of little kids hurt and mothers crying or soldiers helping the same folks by feeding them, giving them candy, holding an orphan or kitten, or soldiers building schools repairing water lines and houses? ask yourself that question.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Source?     Liberals support the military, dear. Our husbands, wives, sons and daughters also fight this battle. I am concerned when any innocent person dies or is injured in war. 4,500 of our heroes have died fighting this battle. Perhaps you could show a little respect.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	they are libs|`|cVEHvqxEaa	I see no evidence that your claim is true of anyone, far left or otherwise.  Perhaps the issue is that Right wingers are incapable of holding more than one thought in their heads at the same time.  Its possible to be considered about civilian casaulties AND support US troops.      Why so much baseless nonsense from the Right?|`|rc4B8Vdaaa	Pakistan is another Afghanistan and the actions of Israel are further destabilizing Middle East.  We are very happy, this one is an unstoppable world crisis.|`|e3c2ed462851c4c6d6796055b93e6970aa	They're not too concerned about innocent civilians in NY, PA, and the Pentagon.
6v1LIdcaaa	Socialism refers to a broad set of economic theories of social organization advocating state or collective ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods, and a society characterized by equal opportunities for all individuals with a fair or egalitarian method of compensation. Modern socialism originated in the late nineteenth-century working class political movement and the intellectual movement of that period which criticized the effects of industrialization and private ownership on society. Karl Marx posited that socialism would be achieved via class struggle and a proletarian revolution and would represent the transitional stage between capitalism and communism.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Yes I do.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	Socialism is the government's complete control of goods and services.  People who live in countries with this type of government are pretty much living under a dictatorship.    The United States hasn't seen real Socialism yet.  We have government-funded social programs here...which is something I oppose to a certain degree.|`|cYuGYhGmaa	Mutual Aid.|`|BQdXnCcHaa	Yes, I know. Do you know what you're supporting or are you just a tofu-chomping idiot?|`|64SObnr5aa	Socialism:  All aspects of business is controlled by the state. There is no private enterprise.    We are not socialistic    We are a republic with democratic principles with a regulated capitalistic economic system and socialism for needed services with a communist public land system. All countries that claim they are a democracy and capitalistic are roughly the above.    Socialism, communism and capitalism are all economic systems.  There are others, but those are the top three.  As I pointed out above we have all there economic systems in place, with the vast majority of it with the capitalism model or free enterprise.     If Obama or our government was bent on turning us socialistic, then they would make damned sure that nationalism of all our private enterprises would be in the works.  The only one that I know of now is our banking system and that should only turn out to be temporary.  Possibly our auto system and again, temporary till we get back on our economic feet.  We have done that in the past.    Peace  Jim    .|`|AA11450062	It is the world view that we are all in this together. Some social programs are good but we don`t want our government making my shoes.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	oh yes, we all know what it is, a failed political idealogy that forgets once you give people power to distribute stuff, they have no incentive to do so and keep it and make everyone's life miserable. Ah, the wonderful theory of socialism, maybe one day it may actually work!|`|fd1n9LoBaa	Churchill said it pretty good:     "Socialism is inseparably interwoven with totalitarianism and the object worship of the state. It will prescribe for every one where they are to work, what they are to work at, where they may go and what they may say. Socialism is an attack on the right to breathe freely. No socialist system can be established without a political police. They would have to fall back on some form of Gestapo, no doubt very humanely directed in the first instance."
a993fdffebb5d1eb64fe6baba1499d98aa	Crap happens. And sometimes really bad crap happens. While it would be crappy for that to happen, I guess, for my own sanity, I would have to make the best of the situation I found myself in. In some ways, this happens to many people in different ways and on different levels. Ultimately, you have to find some way to cope in order to get through the tough parts.    Would 10 million dollars replace 23 years? Wow. 10 mil's an awful lot of money.    You have to figure it this way... 23 years are gone. They thought you were guilty, put you away, and now they realize they were wrong. Yes, it sucks. But what are you going to do? Waste another 20 years being angry and bitter and fighting for some better compensation?    I guess, if I escaped with my sanity intact, I'd take the money and start writing my book and figuring out which actress was going to best portray me in the film version of my book.    When life gives you lemons...
MKrNZMVDaa	I suppose you could ask the same question to the detainees in Guantanamo Bay ... and 'think' before you say that it WAS their fault ... they are prisoners of war just like John McCain was a prisoner of war to the Vietnamese who considered him as big a threat to their safety as he was an enemy combatant in their country.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	John McCain said in his family memoirs that when he got out, he needed information.  He was pretty much obsessed with getting his hands on anything that could get him up to speed on the world since he spent so many years listening to propaganda.    I've heard the same thing from many P.O.W.s I've talked with.  One guy I know said he doesn't allow himself to reflect on the years he lost, he just wants to become absorbed in the here and now.  The past seems so insignificant to him.|`|vxbzE9hNaa	if you have to ask them on that,  Im sure its a life changing experience,|`|BQdXnCcHaa	Why don't you go to your local VFW hall and ask one?|`|81be3df3d8de061d2dc682fbb8dc28b3aa	its one of those things where the person has to make a choice, go on with life, or stew in your past..... not an easy choice to make, but a necessary one....|`|DSSio06daa	I think it must be very difficult and the more support we can give them as Americans the better.    Have you hugged a veteran lately?...      STICKS above is a perfect example of why I support bed times for youngsters.

b4wEKEfCaa	Don't worry you won't get any stimulus money back, you are supporting the film industry with a bailout and paying for STD education, Wind Farms, public transportation.  This will stimulate the economy with "Great Results"|`|NnUAXyCGaa	its not your money|`|FIXKYCIGaa	Funny but I don't remember anyone asking me for my opinion before the Bush administration spent $845 billion on the unnecessary war in Iraq.  That's not counting non direct costs such as the interest on the debt raised to fund the war, health care costs for veterans coming home, and replacing the destroyed hardware and degraded operational capacity caused by the war.  Some economists estimate those indirect costs could be between $3 and 5 trillion.  What about MY money??    By the way, the coupon program was passed when the republicans controlled both the congress and the white house.  Just under a billion dollars was allocated.|`|ac87b7166dd47f74eb47a3ba26fde3daaa	Change we need!|`|L8QR8EJraa	It's not your money.  You're just a debt slave to the gov't.  Get used to it.

If you are talking about thou shall not take the Lords name in vain you might actually be on to something. Contrary to popular believe it dos not have anything with people saying G_D D_ _M and everything about swearing an oath to God, or in his mane,  when you know you dont mean it or cant keep it. Thats why it sais vain, you know, uselessly or falsely. Why they do it, I think they do it because they think it looks good to the voters.
yz3EH5n9aa	If you're talking about the High Court Case of a few days ago then the alleged torture wasn't purported to occur in Guantanamo but in a prison in Afghanistan.    But yes, I would say, judging from that ruling, British security services were complicit with torture and there should be disclosures and prosecution. Its the only reasonable democratic action. Unfortunately the "The American Government won't allow us to disclose it" does have some force, it was their intelligence which MI6 was essentially listening in on, in international law terms a kind of propriatary information.    However, equally the illegality of torture is considered one of the fundemental tenents of international law: I think both Britain and the USA should come clean about this and prosecute those responsible, at all levels.    I don't know who those people are and wouldn't presume to know until they are convicted, just as I wouldn't presume someone is a terrorist until convicted.    Apparently the two posters above just don't care that innocent people might suffer; one seems to be saying that just because decent Americans are suffering someone 'gosh darn it' has to suffer too, not matter whether they have done anything or not. The other seems to live in a dream world!|`|3MM64geHaa	What torture? The Red Cross found no torture. The Dems who went to Gitmo found no torture.  Cutting off heads with dull knives is hardly the same as living at Gitmo.  There is no war crime.  Islamic terrorists  will win bc of pansies who are afraid to treat them like the enemy.|`|jqLWuLkDaa	Not at all bothered - I`m certainly not going to lose any sleep over this.|`|gnIEDg6maa	U .S. admitted water boarding and other practices.  Britain is our Alli.  I hope they were more civilized but their history indicates that they are not above such practices.|`|0982b83a0496946be27e0be6e067b757aa	I don't care if prisoners have been tortured in Gtme bay, I don't care if they have had their prayer mats removed, I don't care that a civilian who is a suspected terrorist has had a gun put in his mouth.   What I do care about is that so many young men and women from our forces have been tortured, decapitated and killed by these cowardly so called terrorists in Iraq.
SlhuFfuZaa	I lost a job to Taiwan in the late '60's. I went into another field and worked at it through the '70's for one company. Then one day they announced the factory would be closing and that a few of us would be kept on to pack and load the equipment for Mexico. After shipping my old job out of country, I had to travel 800 miles to another job. I started it in '82. In '85, they went to Mexico and Dominican Republic. Between then and 2003, i had several jobs in different fields and most of them moved to some foreign country. When China opened up for business, we lost our hold on the rest of our economy. My last job moved to China in 2003. The reason, they stated is that it was costing $3.27 for us to build a unit here and they could get the same thing built in China for $0.24, and that it could be shipped back here for an average of 11 cents a dozen.  I think that soon our government may be moving, but not where we want them to go. They are moving from free to slave!|`|I1Hu4jmyaa	If it was greed I think that they would have moved a long time ago for the cheap labor. It's Obama and his policies. They're running from him and I don't blame them.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	Have you thanked little georgie bush today?|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	Fords are almost all Mexican cars now.  Most transmissions are made in Mexico.    Americans need to work for $2 to $4 dollars an hour and the jobs won't leave.  Last year I made $1.44 an hour.  I got a cost of living raise Jan 1.  I make $1.52 an hour now.  I live on $243 dollars a month.  So can you.|`|aCDWwsisaa	Would it be okay if I told you exactly which shops you could buy your groceries from, where you had to buy your clothes, and which restaurants you were allowed to eat at?    If not, then why do you think it would be okay to restrict businesses from having the same freedom of choice you currently enjoy?|`|xtrdlyJHaa	H1-B Visas don't help    http://www.h1base.com/|`|e7wD8sUiaa	American companies pay a 35% corporate income tax (second highest on the planet)as well as matching the 7.65% payroll tax that they take out of our checks. There are also all kinds of federal regulations that make it more costly for them to operate in this country. Add to that the unions who go on strike for hire wages and more benefits when the company is doing well, but won't make concessions when things are bad. They are pricing themselves out of the market.   Too much government intervention in the free market that too many politicians don't understand because either they have never actually worked in the private sector(coming up, instead through the Democratic machine) or they have, but  since they did they have passed all kinds of laws and tax amendments, that the market has changed from what it was when they were in it.  The tax code alone is 70,000 pages long and has been amended 16,000 times since 1986. That's 16,000 amendments in 23 years. How can business people make long term plans confidently when CONgress is likely to change the rules on a regular basis.|`|di43MlSFaa	Yes, and the banks that received funds from the first bailout have done the same for years but in reverse. Bringing foreigners here to work and also taking advantage of the H-1B visa holders. Some bank work has even been sent overseas as well.  http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090202/ap_o...|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	I don't think there is only one reason why companies are leaving.    As a country, we have the highest corporate taxes in the world, plenty of regulation on companies, and the most litigious society in the world.  So "if" a company decides to have their business here anyway and pay the taxes, conform to the regulation and try to protect themselves from frivolous lawsuits, AND then they have the nerve to be successful in spite of it all, We Americans insult them constantly by calling them evil greedy companies.    Then some people wonder why these companies look for a more business-friendly country.    What---exactly---has the US done lately to appeal to businesses for them to want to be here?  Besides selecting a FEW companies and giving them millions in bail out money even though many of their products are made overseas, imported, and assembled here.|`|13fDE4nGaa	Welcome Aboard    Welcome to     REALITY    Where have ya been?|`|yS0hSFdOaa	That is nothing new. This country has been doing that for years now.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	Yes. The American economy is no longer favorable to running a business here....We have one of the highest tax rates for business in the world. When Ireland lowered their business tax rates during a recession, their economy boomed because businesses set up shop there. You'd think someday our Congressmen would pull their heads out of their a**es and do the same thing.|`|uo9q35Kmaa	WOW research huh?  Do you ever look at the labels on the stuff you buy?    Sure ya do!  Stop yerbitchin and be part of the solution or remain part of the problem.|`|hz0I0zFWaa	We could just cut the tax rate on companies that do 80% of there production in the U.S. to 15%. Then you would see how fast the empty plants would fill up.|`|jk0rAkEjaa	You hit the nail on the head. Now tell me the truth. You have never, ever shopped at WalMart have you? Or bought a TV or clothes or a washing machine or a million other products made overseas have you? If so, you are a contributor to the problem. Buy American|`|29e0c93e3435084cd107d4ed7a75681eaa	Too many taxes, gov't regulations and unions happened. We have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. It costs more to make things (take a car, for example) due to safety, emissions and other requirements and testing. Unions=higher wages and more health care costs that must be paid by the company. With all this, why wouldn't they close up plants, lay people off and go elsewhere?|`|vA7Iq6FSaa	You try doing my job. I run a low end real estate business.  I am making about $60,000 dollars a year in profit...running a business.  Yet, because my income is over 250,000, I am not receiving a tax cut from Mr. Barack Obama.  I used to have 3 people who worked in my office with me.  Now, its just me working at home, no more office.     Taxes are sky high on businesses... ever since Carter, jobs have been leaving America, because it is far too expensive.  If Carter, and especially Clinton had kept inflation under control, we wouldn't have to go overseas, we could pay workers 3.00 and hour, and they'd be able to own a nice apartment. Now, we have to pay them $10.00 and give them insurance and other benefits, all while our taxes are going through the roof.      General Motors employees were getting paid around $40 to play their role in an assembly line.  How hard can it possibly be to screw in bolts on a tire. I think after the first 10 minutes, I'd have it down pretty good.      America claims to be the land of the free, but they are overregulating everything. Loyalty to America? The government can't give you jobs, because for every job they make, they force companies and businesses like me to fire 5 people.  I want to see you get off of your ***, and stop working in your pampered office. If it weren't for the fact that the job market is so bleak, I would be working back in an office. Stop crying and get over the fact that you can't give 15,000 people jobs in this economy and pay approximately $250,000 per hour for them, especially when you can pay $50,000 for the same work in the same hour in China or Mexico.|`|DNaMIcomaa	The Big corporations stopped caring about anything but profit way back in the seventies.In the eighties the door got opened to the cheap labor available in other countries by Ronald Reagan.In the nineties Bill Clinton kicked the door wide open with NAFTA.In the two thousands George W. Bush tore the door off of it's hinges by offering tax breaks to companies taking their work overseas.    I could NEVER support the rest of his policies but Duncan Hunter did get my attention during the primaries at a Republican debate,when the rest of the Republican candidates were genuflecting to the memory of saint Ronald Reagan,when he said "There are no free traders on Mt.

Either big business gets all of the tax breaks or we have the highest taxes in the world.  Which is it.    Had anyone put it together the amount of layoffs since the November election?  Business knows with the Dems in charge business is screwed.  We like to make business the villain but who pays the wages, the benefits etc.  We need business. Stop listening to everything the media says and think for yourself.|`|NktvqJhlaa	Yes, there should be loyalty but save some of that anger for the libs in congress! Like drwmxwll said, over regulation and over taxation is unnecessary and helps to drive them over seas. Let's just make sure we don't have all our guns pointed in one direction when some of the enemy is right behind us.    I do agree that NAFTA and China are royally screwing US. I read that China is actually making some of the parts for our guided missile systems! How the hell did that happen???|`|YsQQ30YJaa	You  can thank the doo gooder libs for most of these problems. Every time they mandate something that costs the employers money either the end price goes up or the whole job goes overseas, or both. either way there is no free lunch. Raise the minimum wage? Sounds good to those trying to earn a living on peanuts but it only serves to raise the price of everything to compensate. They start making demands for a cleaner environment and what happens? The work goes where there are no expensive laws. Overtime requirements? Overseas again.The "rich" did not get that way by being stupid or playing "fair" by the libs plans and ideas. We didn't always have HMO's and high malpractice insurance. now we do and the simple cost of going to a doctor for a check up had sky rocketed.A whole bureaucracy to fund. Unions? Same deal. No unions means cheaper products - every time.|`|TGRKbQMVaa	I think we need the unions and Government out of our business's , also greedy CEO's.|`|Shp5riE6aa	Greed of multi national corporations is harmful for American workers, it's disheartening.|`|2FA9qNHzaa	I spoke to a lady today whose son works for Pfizer, who just bought out Wyeth, both are bohemeth drug companies.

YouTube does all those legal wrangling deals that basically puts all liability with the poster of the video.

Something needs to happen soon.|`|Vu7kCPesaa	The government should get its filthy hands out of the education system. Nowhere in the Constitution is the power to control education delegated to the Federal Government, so why are they doing it? Socialism doesn't work.    Education should be privatised. That way, educators will have to compete to provide the best education, or they will go out of business. When educators are forced to improve their methods to survive, we will likely end up with better education. The current system of throwing more money into a broken system is getting us nowhere.    Also, when you quit taxing people to fund a broken public school system, people will be able to afford private schools.|`|MKrNZMVDaa	America has one of the worst education systems of the first world ... public and private schools included.

The cost of each student in government schools is $12,000 to 15,000 a year.  That's more than any of the private schools in my area yet our graduation rates are only 50%.  Of those who actually graduate, I've met some of them who are illiterate.  I've had HS graduates come into work who can't read a tape measure or do simple decimal/fraction conversions.    The schools try to be everything to a child and end up doing nothing well.  I would never, ever send a child to these generic, violent schools.    What to do to make it better?  We could start with accountability.  We can stop passing kids to another grade even though they are well below their grade level.  We can reduce the non-essential subjects and concentrate on the basics.  The school boards can spend their money wisely.  For example, our schools gave us a sob story about how they needed money for the kids.  The levy passed.  Then they immediately spent $100k on a PR firm to improve the image of the school instead of using that money to actually teach the students!    School vouchers help to offset the cost of tuition but it doesn't pay all of it.  Still, when faced with a school that does not educate and giving a child the opportunity to actually learn and make something of their lives, I'd make the sacrifices necessary just like my parents did (I went to both public and private schools).  Also, many private schools have a sliding scale for tuition so lower income people get discounted rates.    In any other business, competition is a good thing.  It makes a business want to improve and become more efficient with their resources.  Our government schools have no competition and no worries.  No matter how bad they do, they will still get their money.  Last year we even had a teacher leave her toddler in her car at school all day and it died from the heat.  She "forgot" about it.  Oops.  She still has her job though.  It isn't uncommon to read about drunk bus drivers or drivers leaving kids on their buses.  But it's okay---the union will protect their jobs.    The private schools are held accountable for their actions and their students.  Their school won't exist if they try to pull even half of the things that the government schools get away with.|`|81be3df3d8de061d2dc682fbb8dc28b3aa	bring back beating the bejesus out of undisciplined kids.....|`|fd1n9LoBaa	They teach you how to socialize.

jGgOVd5Zaa	You need to be more specific.  Are you talking about different campuses of the same university or different universities?      -For instance, so college athletes sign letters of intent that bind them to a schools athletic program for a season.    -Some universities are really a collection of different colleges with separate admissions policies and some are just different locations where classes are held.    -Some universities have parity programs with other local colleges that allow students to take classes at each others campuses at no extra charge.  You earn the credits at the university you are enrolled in but you can take the classes (sometimes subject to some credit transfer requirements) wherever it is most convenient for you.    It's probably a little more than a telephone call, but in a lot of these situations it can be taken care of with a quick (depending on the length of the line) visit to the Registrar's office or even online.  If there is a separate admissions process it could be a lot more complicated.

159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	Most people do not understand how much in taxes a company must pay various local, state, and federal governments in order to have employees. (Face it: licenses and fees are also taxes.)     And most employees don't understand that similar huge taxes are involved in the price of every product they buy, all the way back to when the product was first picked from the field or mined from the Earth.    The end result is that even people in the lowest tax brackets are paying much of their wealth to various governments indirectly through higher prices of products.

Thanks for clearing that up. I always thought that taxes were taxes, but I didn't know that they were taxes too.    Seems like liberals might not be the only ones who don't understand taxes.    EDIT: Thanks for clearing that up. Well, those payroll taxes are from the employEES' wages, NOT from the employERS' pockets. The only 'tax' that employers pay on wages is their 7.75% (or whatever it is, but it's close to that amount) matching contribution to Social Security: the employee has the same amount extracted from their paycheck.     It seems that MANY corporations have now gone offshore and some pay NO taxes at all; others pay very little. But what is most galling, and I'm not faulting him personally, is what Warren Buffett said: "There's something wrong with the present tax structure when MY SECRETARY pays a higher percentage (in taxes) than I do." When a BILLIONAIRE can say that, it behooves us to look at the entire tax situation. personally, I'm for scrapping the income tax and replacing it with a consumption/sales tax: everything except food is taxed. Period. If you don't buy something, your pay stays in your pocket. Say, a 25% tax, 15% for the Fed Gov, 10% for the State... or 20%, with a 12%/8% split.   BTW: I knew you were being facetious.

M3maZgdyaa	The most astounding result from the IRS data is the deluge of revenues from the very taxes that were cut in 2003: capital gains and dividends. As shown in the nearby chart, capital gains receipts from 2002-04 have climbed by 79% after the reduction in the tax rate from 20% to 15%. Dividend tax receipts are up 35% from 2002 to 2004, even though the taxable rate fell from 39.6% to 15%. This is as clear evidence of a Laffer Curve effect as one will find: Lower rates produced increased revenues.    What explains this surge in tax revenues, especially at the high end of the income scale? The main factor at play here is the robust economic expansion, which has led to real income gains for most tax filers. Higher incomes mean higher tax payments. Between 2001 and 2004, the percentage of Americans with an income of more than $200,000 rose from 12.0% to 14.2%. The percentage of Americans earning more than $50,000 a year rose from 40.8% to 44.2% -- and that's just in two years. While these statistics are not inflation-adjusted by the IRS, price rises were relatively modest during these years, so adjusting wouldn't alter much.    We can already hear the left objecting that the rich are paying more taxes simply because they have hoarded all the income gains, while the middle class and poor wallow in economic quicksand. But, again, the IRS data tell a more upbeat story of widespread financial gains for American families. The slice of the total income pie captured by the richest 1%, 5% and 10% of Americans is lower today than in the last years of the Clinton administration.

cbIxKGZVaa	I just finished up doing Security Forces for the Air Force for the past 6 years and a 11 month extension    It is nothing like civilian police work (even though they will tell you you are "real cops") you truly aren't as you are bound to the UCMJ and local state laws, keep in mind the military is a very controlled environment so unless you are running a lot of concurrent jurisdiction which isn't very common at most Air Bases don't count on seeing much action    It will teach you discipline but also a hatred towards the Air Force (as the rest of the Air Force hates cops and you can never do anything right in their eyes) and within the first 2 years you will be extremely bored and unfulfilled as you will be pulling the crap of the crap post....    Your degree won't do much for you except give you two stripes which you would get anyways shortly after you get to your first duty station...    Helping you out with civilian department highers it could I have a panel interview next Tuesday with Rock Hill PD in Rock Hill, SC which they called me in for after I submitted my application in.    So who knows it just depends on the state as some higher off the civil service exam and if you got state residency there and veteran points you are almost golden if they are highering|`|9I3wHIdraa	I was an MP from1972 to 1981.  I must say yes you can go to war and many times you will be the first in and last out.   I was one of the lucky ones, I worked the street and then was able to get a job as a clerk in the investigation section.  A year later I went to MPI school and worked in investigations from 76-81.  The hours were brutal, pay was even worse and equipment was always old and broken.  One thing you could do is apply to the Army CID.  I think that they want a 4 year degree but you could join the MP's and then apply for a warrant officer position in CID.    With you 2 year degree you could apply at any police department, your age is fine.  You have many options open to you, try border patrol.|`|Ise5kFoxaa	Well i have never been in the military, but my Ex was an MP. They do get deployed often. The military had a habit of deploying him. He was gone for a while then he came back six months later was sent away for another deployment, so ya they do go to war. I don't know if this is for all MPs but it was the case with him. They of course they also do patrolling and security just like a cop.     Its not all that bad, the pay is good and its not that dangerous of a job. THe hours are twelve hour shifts and its three or four days a week that you would work.    As far a your Associates goes, the military prefers Bachelors. An Associates will get you higher up but a bachelors will  help you become an officer.
jGgOVd5Zaa	You are making a logic leap.  There are different definitions of what a human is.  You can define it as a living being with a certain genetic being.  This definition is useful if you are trying to decide if it is a cat or a human being.  You can define it a being created by God complete with a soul.  This is a religious definition.  I would guess most people who are against abortion would use this definition.  You can say it is a living creature, with human DNA, that can live in the world as long as it has access to the basic necessities of life (food, warmth, oxygen, etc.).  This definition would exclude a fetus, and could be fuzzy when you start talking about people who are brain dead.  You can say it is a creature that is self-aware.  Of course, you can argue that several other species might be smart enough to be considered self-aware.  This is an argument that you might get from animal rights activists.    Where your question causes problems is when people use different definitions for what a human is.  You can make arguments for each definition and depending on which definition a person uses, they may feel very different about abortion.  Many pro-choice people would argue that because a mother is clearly a person (by any of those definitions) her rights trump the rights of a fetus (who don't meet all of those definitions.)  Once a baby is born, the balance between the mother's rights and the infants rights shifts because the mother can now be excluded from the equation.    A lot of pro-choice people don't like abortion, but they believe the right of a woman to have control over her own body is more important than the right of a fetus (which only meets some of the definitions of human.)   They would argue that there are better forms of birth control that should be used and taught first (the numbers show that just teaching kids abstinence doesn't work because kids aren't very good at it) that could lower the abortion rates without infringing on the mother's rights.    I get the feeling that you may not like this answer.  I'm not trying to be glib or confrontational, but a lot of times the pro-life movement assumes that the pro-choice movement is acting the way it does out of some desire to be amoral.  They are not.  They just have examined morality and come to different conclusions by weighting different values more or less strongly.|`|ukBX5OOsaa	A foetus? I'm not exactly sure what that is. A fetus, which I do what that is, is a mass of tissue. And whether it is considered to be live or not alive, depends on your personal morals.|`|z88IMXNFaa	A human fetus has the potential to be a human being.

Until the anti abortionists can get everyone on the same page, then it is nothing more then they forcing their morals down everyone else throats.    That is but one of the many issues that the anti abortion pundits needs to answer, both to themselves and the public.    Pro choice is very simple, it is up to the mother and her maker.    That is as simple as it gets.    Keep if that way and work with the pro choice people to make abortion legal, safe and rare.    There is your answer.    Peace  Jim    .|`|JqYxr9Ubaa	Until it is capable of surviving outside the womb, a foetus is not a person.      Look at the early fetal development of various mammals, including humans, and I'm certain you would not be able to tell the difference.      But to answer your question, if my partner were pregnant, and we both wanted to keep it, we would celebrate that pregnancy.  If we found out that she was pregnant and we didn't want to keep it, we would know early enough to abort the foetus before it developed into anything close to resembling a human being.

6iI4xhFbaa	Too many to count.  Many municipalities will have a judge for traffic tickets and ordinance violations.  Then there's county judges, which can include family law courts, juvenile courts, justice of the peace courts, county criminal courts, criminal district courts, probate courts, etc.  There are also appeal level courts within states.  States have their supreme courts.  Federal courts include magistrate courts, district courts, circuit courts, appellate courts, and the United States Supreme Court.  For all those local courts, you'd have to research each and every city and county in the United States to see how many they have to even begin knowing how many we have.    If I was forced to guess, I'd say it's over 50,000 but less than 150,000 judges.  The number is very high to account for all the municipal courts out there.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	what KIND of judges ??? and in all states ??? you need to count...there's states, local, circuit, appeals, supreme court in each state, plus the US supreme court...so go to all the states web sites and start counting...or maybe google has the answer.|`|7EiWSuPLaa	too many about 20,000 i would guess . they could do with less if they didn't postpone just about every person that comes before them. i was in a situation where i was stuck in county jail for 2 months  before going to  prison. i wanted to plead guilty and get off to prison but the judge kept continuing  my docket. that was about 4 times  going to court, the Judaical system in this country is ridiculous. the co's are another waste of money some are so fat they couldn't walk up a flight of stairs if their lives depended on it. some are so whacked out they can hardly stand. at least that is in connecticut|`|gYNDNXAkaa	On the streetcorners?

E9XL5x3Paa	It was two Republicans (Bush and Paulson) who came up with the bailout.  Democrats voted for it the first time (when it was $700 billion), but it was defeated by Republicans in Congress.    The authors of the bill went back and redid the bill, this time ADDING $150 billion in spending to it to make the bailout $850 billion.  That is when Republicans voted for it.      So "testicles" (you do realize that Seth McFarlane is a HUGE Liberal, right?), you cannot put this squarely on the Democrats.  In fact, the Republicans wouldn't pass it until spending was added on!          Add-on:    And Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac donated to everyone's campaign.  And far more to Republicans.    Obama got $126,195 in donations to his campaign from the two companies.  McCain got $195,135 from them.      The difference was that the companies gave to Obama directly, whereas the CEOs of the companies gave to McCain.  So if you did not know the names of the CEOs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, you'd never know they had donated to McCain.    Which suggests they were trying, quite successfully, to play both sides of the coin and get on the up-and-up with both McCain and Obama.  But the fact that they donated nearly $65,000 MORE to McCain suggests they wanted McCain to win, NOT Obama.  They were just hedging their bets with Obama.        EVERYONE is wrong in this, but Republicans are far dirtier in this game.  They held out to increase the spending, and took far more in money from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.      As long as we are on it, you know how you guys constantly attack Obama for serving on the same board with William Ayers on the Anenburg Foundation?    Well, guess who was funding William Ayers?  That's right, McCain was.  McCain gave over $120,000 to Ayers for ONE project alone; and he did fund more than one project.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	It wasn't a Republican majority in Congress that voted on the bailout....get your facts straight pal|`|5934b4ac2c8b2f469b3de84858dc0d56aa	ummm.

These are our god given rights (or as some like to say, we are endowed with these rights by our creator). We believe we can achieve these goals without government intrusion in our lives. In fact, conservatives share a dislike and mistrust of big government. Conservatism in practice works. Many people prospered during the Reagan Administration. If you prefer the days of Jimmy Carter then YOU go wait on line to buy gasoline on even or odd days, because I've been there and done that. Why do so many people risk their lives to come to this great country? They want to prosper! They want to be capitalists! They don't risk their lives to be poor. They know all the good America has to offer to anyone who's willing to work hard. How would you like it if someone knoocked on your door and told you (assuming you're a hard working fellow) that you have too much money and we have to take some of it and give it to your buddy who's chronically out of work? That's how conservatives feel when the producers of wealth are demonized. The more government punishes the producers, the less hard they're going to work. They won't re-invest in their businesses and they'll lay-off people or just stop hiring. NYS is taxing people out of the state because of confiscatory state taxes and now they're talking about raising our taxes even more to close a budget gap. It's immoral. Also, as conservative, it galls me that my tax dollars will be going to fund abortions all over the world now, thanks to Obama. I can't wait till 2012. I hink the Conservative movement is picking up some steam.    Yes the bible does say that a camel has a better chance of going through the loop on a needle then a rich man getting into heaven, and we all have to be charitable and concerned for our fellow man. Conservatism doesn't preclude this. The bible also says "Give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day, but teach a man to fish and he'll eat for the rest of his life." That's the bible quote conservatives believe in. Compassionate, dontcha think?|`|no4K64YYaa	Doing what's best for the country should NOT result in placing trillions of dollars of debt on the backs of unborn Americans. You've got to wonder about Obama...yes, he won in November. But he didn't win by a landslide and even his own dems are backing away from this Partisan Porkulus bill, bowing to pressure from their constituents back home. Still, he's pressing on to pass this bill. A mature, thoughtful leader would take a step back and re-evaluate the situation. If ten people are telling you you're drunk, SIT DOWN!!! Obama is showing what an arrogant man he is and he seems pissed that he's not getting his way right away. Good! I'm glad people are waking up and taking an interest finally. What happened to Obama's "line item veto" rhetoric during his campaign? It sounds like even HE doesn't know what's in this Porkulus bill. I'm not sure what the rush is, but I don't think this bill should be passed anytime soon. Government is already too big, why grow it more?
XYTUAzzgaa	you mean like banning lobbyists and then two weeks later saying, "except for these guys"|`|4TqERLSgaa	Make sure you volunteer to feed the homeless, and the less fortunate, because he won't be doing that either. That is our job. He made that perfectly clear, at Christmas. While I was serving up turkey and gifts to the homeless, Obama was basking on a beach in Hawaii. You know who  was standing next to me in the serving line, the McCain's. They paid for all of the food and for the gifts for the children.  I guess Obama thought that paint he and Joe Biden slapped on the wall would some how make up for it. We got robbed. Obama is a taker not a giver.|`|482oQASHaa	Wow can you say jealousy
9dd7255bfe9e90bbd64019154baae7a6aa	If not in the field, we did PT at 6:30 -8:00 am, then went to breakfast, reported to formation at 9:00 am. Then we did whatever work was scheduled for the day until 12:00 pm. Went to lunch until 1:00 pm, went back to work and finished with last formation at 5:00 pm. Did whatever we wanted to (legally and professionally) until the next morning. Had weekends off to do whatever... Travel, stay in your room, shop, rec, movies, whatever.    good point Stevie, I forgot about Blacklistings. In Germany we had several cities we couldn't go to due to Neo Nazi rallies going on that weekend.    Plus in the states, you must get authorization to leave the state you're in to go to another.    Most bases have a enlisted club, NCO club, and Officer's club on base.    Go whever you want off base, just keep it legal.|`|21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	A "normal" work day in garrison consists of being at PT @ 0630 till 0730... personal hygiene time until 0845... formation @ 0850. Work doing whatever they can come up with you to do until roughly 1700 (IF youre lucky to actually get off work on time)  most units have lunch from 1130-1245.     Your nights are yours unless you have been ordered otherwise or are assigned a duty.   Weekends are the same way as nights. If you plan on going past a certain distance you have to get permission.     There will always be places "blacklisted" that you are not allowed to go to. Usually because there is known illegal activity that goes on there or the business has treated soldiers poorly in the past.|`|XYTUAzzgaa	it's just like any other job once you settle in as far as a normal day while in garrison. your first sergeant or company commander will dictate what is done that day. you may have circuit classes on mos related skills, weapons  maintenance, details such as operating a rifle range, guard mount, training at an urban warfare site or even area beautification. you can usually have lunch off post or go get some shopping in. when last formation is over you change into civilian clothes and hit the town if you want or just hang around the barracks dayroom...your deployment readiness status at the time will dictate how far you can get away from the post. so sometimes you might not be able to go see that concert in another city depending on how far away it is.|`|abDPRBqlaa	Just be careful not to have too much fun (nights with other soldiers' wives, fights, drunk driving, drinking with minors, etc) or you could be severely punished. You're basically like a teenager and the military is your parent....they find out your mistakes, and you pay, so just be careful with your desire for a club/nightlife. Usually, you'll have weekends off, but you can be used as your commander sees fit. If you have a bipolar Platoon Sgt. like my husband did, who knows what he'll have you do or when. You will have some time to yourself...not so much at first though. My husband in his 3rd year of service went to work at 5:45 am and got out around anywhere from 3 to 5pm...but of course it was up to the Platoon Sgt. Sometimes he didn't get home till 7, other times he got home at noon....it just depends.|`|Mak8d6cdaa	hmm this is a view from a army wife...    my husband gets up and has pt....mon thru fri...not all the time but MOST the time from 0600 to around 0700 or 0730...    then comes home for about an hour and a half    then is off the work... from about 0900 to 1700..those are normal days...some days are longer and some days are shorter...    you should have tons of time to go out and party but just remember if your in the army your on their time...they are very good at screwing up your plans...esp with moving deployment dates up...    if you have any more question feel free to ask

Then were going to invest in how to make water fly our rockets because of how much we'd make not using gasoline while we'd have to use 300x the battery power without gasoline so we'd be polluting anyways. Then ounce we are all driving hybrids were going to find out they are polluting too! They get there batteries from companies in Canada that pollute into the ocean! aint that funny? The car that sends out "good" emissions is doing business with a company that pollutes.    We are also trying to prove that what MC Hammer did with his money was the right thing so we are gonna let Obama go wild with the tax money! Hammer Time!!!|`|AA11376726	Our economy needs consumers to spend money on products and services. Buying stuff keeps businesses going, keeps unemployment down, and the government gets money by taxing individuals and businessses who are making money. Consumers are not buying (I won't go into why) so businesses are failing, which means people are losing jobs, and the government is losing tax revenue. The theory is that a government hand out will encourage people to start spending again, new businesses will start up, and the government will get it's tax revenue. My opinion is the government doesn't care one bit about you and me, they just want our tax money to (mostly) waste.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Bottom line, what gets an economy moving is people spending money.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	They're trying to bring us closer to socialism.

No, people are taking the money and locking it in the basement safe.|`|438e26d7b22965d7e9bbd6ed05be2455aa	governments all over the world are handing out money in a simple attempt to convince their citizens that they are doing something.  this is much akin to someone with chronic back pain planting a tree to feel better...the disconnect between the issue and the solution is severe.  what will it achieve? nothing.  what was it supposed to achieve? confidence in the government.  won't happen...just bringing on higher inflation when the system finally gets full.|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	I'm at a loss as to the answer to this question.  It didn't work when Bush did it, so I don't understand why they think it'll work this time.    And as far as the corporate bailouts go, the Republicans were called "obstructionists" when they voted to block them, and then when they passed anyway, and they turned unpopular, the Republicans were then blamed for them.  That is what baffles me the most.|`|TJ8fgBpWaa	Maybe "blonde moments" are catchy, 'cuz I'm having one with your question.    Are you talking about the Australian government handing out money to its own citizens? The Americans are doing the same, as are almost all the other nations in the world who can afford it. If you're talking about the Americans giving money to Australians, you've lost me. Source?    Well, lemme see: that's called "priming the pump." It operates on the basis that each dollar spent creates more than a dollar in economic activity.    If a person spends a dollar at a business, there is some profit in that dollar that goes to the owner of the business, be it a Mom-and-Pop store or a big corporation. Part of the profit goes to taxes (well... maybe not for some corporations, thanks to Republican free-market LOOPHOLES), some to payroll, and some to buy more stuff (inventory) to sell.    It's called "the multiplier effect," wherein 1 dollar produces $2 or $3 (or more) dollars of economic activity. When's the last time you heard of stocks   (or gold, etc.) doubling or tripling, consistently? When the economy is slow, high unemployment and getting higher daily, people not only have less money to spend, they spend even less of what they do have. Hence the need for a 'stimulus.' It may not be perfect, but inaction is not an option. Now it's just a question of how the 535 people in Congress are going to make their constituents happy. THAT'LL be fun... sort of.  .|`|81be3df3d8de061d2dc682fbb8dc28b3aa	world wide welfare system, gotta love it
E9XL5x3Paa	Congress controls the purse, and along with it controls taxes.  The President cannot decrease (or increase) taxes to anyone.      The only thing that can be done by the President is to limit his own spending.  That would include leaving expensive wars, especially if they are not being covered by taxes and we are borrowing to cover that spending (like we are in Iraq and Afghanistan).    We are constantly told that the cost of the war has now reached about $600 billion.  That isn't even close to its actual total.  That is only the cost of war operations, and does not include the huge amount of interest that Bush racked up by borrowing the money and not paying any of it back so far.  Which means that in addition to the huge amount of capital he borrowed, interest is now compounding on top of interest.    We need to leave those wars; and that is true regardless of whether you believe in the reasoning behind it or not.  It does no good to protect America from terrorists if we collapse America in uncontrollable debt.  We have to go and re-establish our economy.    Even if it means we might have to go back later.  We first need to re-establish the economy, and then the next time (hopefully there won't be one, but maybe) pay for it the right way.  And that means taxes, NOT borrowing.      We've got to cut the expense of the wars, and then push Congress to pay down the National Debt.  That will salvage the dollar, and make everything affordable again.|`|VMTVnUylaa	resign|`|cvBkyVRyaa	They should give the money directly to the taxpayers, after all that's where the government is stealing it from in the first place.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	decrease taxes and decrease federal spending|`|AA11694451	I know this sounds like a smart@$$ answer, but I truly believe it could help...He should step down and appoint someone that understands economics to his possition.

If there were less taxes on our major business owners they would most likely bring their operations back to the United States and provide jobs for American families.  This in turn would cause the employees to spend more on consumer goods providing an even greater boost to the economy.    Then they could go to work repealing the 16th amendment that was ratified on February 3, 1913 giving congress a blank check on how much of our income could be taxed.  It also gave them the right to start new taxes or raise those that already exist.    Get rid of the 16th amendment and go to a flat tax.  Reinstall the gold standard and stop the government from printing useless money which only deflates the value of the American dollar.

During the colonial era most migrants came from northern European countries. Their numbers declined with the onset of the Revolutionary War during the 1770s, but immigration later picked up strongly again during the 1840s and 1850s. New arrivals came from several European countries during this period, but most came from Ireland and Germany, where devastating crop failures forced many residents to leave their homelands. Many settled in New York City, where the population increased from 200,000 residents in 1830 to 515,000 in 1850. By 1860, New York was home to over one million residents. More than half of the city's population at that time were immigrants and their American-born children.

Interesting huh?|`|mXO2TOUjaa	No  party thinks she will win plus she would have big trouble finding the funds to back her.|`|UzRijICuaa	You seem ever so slightly obsessed with Gov. Palin.

Bailing out the banks will only work if they are given a mandate that they loan out money in order to receive bailout money. Otherwise, they're just going to take the money and laugh at us. Since a mandate to loan money would be unworkable, better just not to bail them out.|`|BQdXnCcHaa	That's why it shouldn't be on our dime. It should be on their own dime.

It is just a scam for company management to have a good time on the company (taxpayer) dime.  If a person or company wants to buy your service or product, you don't have to bribe them to do it.  I have worked for several Fortune 100 companies and been to quite a few big parties for clients and it is always a waste of money.  If they are going to buy from you, they will.  If not, no amount of swooning works.    PS:  What the hell is swooning investors?  Do you mean schmooze?|`|I5EWEvaUaa	I think you have a point. But, due to the extreme conditions in our economy, EVERYONE needs to be aware of this condition and adjust their spending appropriately. Yes, there needs to be money spent to 'swoon' investors, but it has gotten so grossly out of control over the past couple decades, it needs seriously to be reigned in and gotten under control (regardless of whether it is tax payers money or not!).         Do you really think these 'investors' would NOT invest in a company because they didn't get a 100K+ party thrown or other perks? I personally think if the investors think it is a good deal for them and they will make money on the investment, they will invest regardless of the 'perks' thrown at them.|`|8GDd6lrnaa	if i was an investor i wouldn't put my money in a company that wastes. there is to much waste. give the people a fair deal. give people loans they can pay. all the investors in the world couldn't make a dime off a housing developement if they don't sell. i'd rather have a return on my cash than a party favor.|`|fO8sn3m4aa	The bailout plan is intended to stimulate the junk of some banksters...  this will be achieved by spending the money on important things like $2000/ hour prostitutes.

We can strike from Submarines,Warships,stealth bombers,We have wicked satellite capabilities. And our ground troops are the best equipped and trained in the world, and as we speak we are increasing our Brigade numbers in the next few years to meet the demand of the war on terror.

Including flipping off the camera, saying they'll take 'Saddam's *** out' etc. There have been numerous occasions in which the Bush administration has used vulgar language thinking the microphone is off.    I'm just happy Barack Obama put it as it is and no way else. Also,its not formality that shows a government is effective, but its action. The Bush administration didn't allow anyone without a coat into the Oval office, they shook hands etc. But those times when the microphone was supposedly 'off' show what kind of people they are.     And besides,isn't an administration where there's fist bumps,mild slang and humor what we really need right now?Especially in these troubling economic times. I'd much rather have an administration that 'bumps fists' and does something rather than 'shakes hands' and does nothing.|`|l02Huqdlaa	I agree that it's good he admits his mess up but he is the president and he has to start realizing he isn't the Hollywood idol and he can't act like one.

1jkAIJvYaa	The worst that could happen is that you'd have to cover their medical expenses.  They probably have insurance, don't worry.  If he wasn't crying and didn't go to the hospital, he'll be fine.  Don't worry about it.  Let your parents know what's going on if you already didn't.  But try not to worry about it.  They wont do anything|`|4b8bdbb75019cf2a83ebf3a855d325dbaa	nothing is going to come of it. you know how long it is going to take before they can determine if he has "permanent damage"? Besides, you will have a defense and that is self defense. you feared he was going to come after you becasue he had just insulted you and what was on your mind was that he was next going to use physical violence because he had just used verbal violence in the form of a slur and with the pool sticks nearby you thought he was reaching for one. Right?|`|3oZEfrEjaa	If he turns 18 soon it wont be up to his parents it will be up to him because he is an adult. But even if you are I don't think they could sue for much since you are mutual friends and it was an accident. I wouldn't sweat it dude.|`|66e03546d71298a34daadeb6dce02da6aa	You parents can't be sued for this.  You can be sued, judgment won't be due from you until you are the age of adulthood in your state.|`|oFcrglxzaa	you need to be charged with assault first, the longer he waits to get medical attention the worst his case will be in fact, if he was not admitted to a hospital for treatment after it happened, then he has no case I think he's bullsh*ting you ,I doubt his mom will sue you or even knows what happened|`|c07v7O80aa	Until the Sheriff or Constable comes to the door with a citation that begins, "You have been sued," don't worry about it. They have a couple of years to file, and they often do, because by then you usually know more about the long-term effects.     (Think of it. What a fun two years. Either you don't tell your parents, and they find out two years from now and want to kick you to death. Or you do tell them now, and they shake their heads at you for two years and think, "Dumb kid.")|`|Avxa966Iaa	Anytime you hit a person you leave yourself open to litigation....sticks and stones will break your bones but words will never hurt you.

Because then there are going to be these shiny new coins that no one's going to want to buy anymore.  I'm not racist, I just think that yeah I think it's kind of mean that people like Abraham Lincoln did great things for the United States and got their face on a coin while Obama won the election and woooo, he has a coin set too.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	i think they look tacky, but thats besides the point  its just commemorative, its not in major circulation or anything  they make alot of coins like that    now if they take off george washington or something and stick him on the (in circulation) quarter, thats a little ridiculous because hes barely been in office for a month|`|xLPNpHLRaa	i has all the obama coins    muahahaha|`|67dWrrH9aa	i love obama|`|IcBdShB1aa	They have mccain coins too dumba$$.

5zBEU99kaa	When he decided to start rationalizing his actions and redefining accepted conventions of international law to suit the ambitions of the neoconservative movement.     At that point in time GW Bush and his administration started down the road towards becoming War Criminals.     The Nuremburg Tribunals consisted of four possible charges all based primarily the Kellogg-Briand Pact, AKA as the General Treaty for the Renunciation of War, (1928)    They were:    1. Participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of crime against peace     2. Planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression and other crimes against peace    3. War crimes    4. Crimes against humanity    Although most people focus on the last three charges which deal with the conduct of the war itself, the fact is conspiring to go to war against a sovernign nation, and actually doing so were the very same crimes that were tried at Nuremberg.     In 1950, the Nuremberg Tribunal defined Crimes against Peace (in Principle VI.a, submitted to the United Nations General Assembly) as    (i) Planning, preparation, initiation or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances; (ii) Participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the acts mentioned under (i).    This is exacty what the Bush Administration did. They rationalized it with nice words "Pre-emptive defense" but at the end of the day, it amounted to planing and waging a war of agression against a soverign nation that did not pose any credible threat to the United States.     The Various Geneva Conventions deal with the treatment of both combatants (Military, Militia, Partisans) non-combatants(Unarmed uniform services -medics chaplins, doctors  nurses etc) and Civilians. Making up out of thin air the term "Enemy combatant" and deporting people from their home country to Gitmo while committing a crime against peaces is under the Nuremberg Principle VI (B) a war crime, and under Nuremberg Principle (C) a crime against humanity.    Principle III States quite clearly : The fact that a person who committed an act which constitutes a crime under international law acted as Head of State or responsible government official does not relieve him from responsibility under international law.    Although he may never be indicted or tried, George Bush and many other members of the Bush Administration are criminals under the very same international laws, treaties and conventions that NAZI leadership were found to be criminals.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	His overall inability to admit when he was wrong.

9tcv3TiWaa	HM - Hospital Corpsman for both the Navy and Marine Corps, medical and dental.   They can be stationed anywhere with either branch.  They can be on Shore duty (hospital/clinic) or Sea Duty (Ship, squadron).  It can depend on what their actual job is to what they get assigned to.  If they are in Dental then they don't go with the Marines on deployment, but they can be stationed at a Marine or Navy Base or they can be stationed on a ship.  If there is another type of specialty they could be only assigned to hospitals and not ships.    When it comes to times it honestly depends on their job, if they work in a clinic usually regular hours and home on weekends but not always, they will also have duty calls or on call days where they have to go into work even if it is a weekend or holiday.  He can be working nights or days, it varies.    yes if he goes to a ship he can be away for a few days, a week, a few weeks, a month, few months, or over 6 months depending on what the ship is doing.  One year they can be gone 60% of the year and the next year gone 90% of the year.  There is no way to tell as it varies.  If he gets assigned to a Marine Unit then he deploys with them, when they go, he goes.   Deployments can be the same but up to 9 months.  There is no set schedule for them either.      There is sometimes when it is normal and other times when it isn't.  There are things he will miss and things he is there for.  How it works depends on you both and how committed you are to your marriage.  You need to stay busy, work, go to school, to keep your mind going.  To be honest long deployments are better than short deployments.  With longer ones you can get yourself into a better schedule because you know he is gone for a certain amount of time so your mindset is when he is coming home.    For children there is lots of babies who have been born without the father there, first steps, first words, first day of school, etc.. And the children are stronger than we think.  Yes it can be difficult at times but it can also be wonderful.      There is online groups that can help you out with your questions and some support.  Like     http://forums.military.com/eve/forums/a/...  http://www.operationhomefront.com (click on forums)|`|RNkw1BWVaa	My brother had three of them.

I know that sounds sort of cold... but really, it's that way in any relationship.  If you meet other Navy wives and get involved with things in and around the base, you'll be fine.  You'll have to make the choice to adapt or not.      I'm a little surprised that two people whoare nearly 30 made the decision to enlist in the Navy yet didn't realize he might be deployed to the fleet 6 months at a time.  That's pretty standard stuff for the Navy.  Lots of Navy wives have had babies and raised them on their own 6 months at a time.  It's a difficult thing to do, but many do it successfully.  It all depends on how determined you are to make it work.|`|neFd6a4paa	Congratulations on your Husbands excellent choice of Rate. It's the most decorated Rate in the NAVY and has perhaps the most varied choices in duty station and unit in the entire DoD.      It depends on where he is stationed and with what unit. If he is with the FMF that doesn't neccesarily mean he'll be gone more. He may in fact be home MORE. I would personally hold off in having children until he's been settled into his ACTUAL duty station for more than a year. That way the marriage will be tested in the real military enviornment, the Fleet.    After your husband is done with Hospital Corps school, he'll likely go on to the Field Medical Corpsman school *where he'll learn a few of the skills he'll need in a combat unit* or one of the C schools needed for other duties. If he has ANY say in where he's stationed, tell him to Ace his tests and finish TOP of his class or somewhere in the top, it may give him a leg up on picking duty station, if not the unit he'll be with.|`|abDPRBqlaa	My husband was in the Army and is now in the Navy. While in the Army he was away most of our relationship and it was tough, years go by fast. Now he's in the Navy and I don't have a clue what his deployments will be like. We have a baby and I'm scared, because my husband was born to be a nurturing dad and I'm afraid he won't be here for hardly any of it. I didn't know the Navy deployed more often than other branches...I thought after a 6 month deployment they're back home for a year, but I guess that isn't so? Yes, it's lonely, but don't put your life on hold because God knows where you'll be years from now. There are military wives, and while they can never fill the gap of a missing spouse, they do ease the pain in many ways.  Good luck to you. It's tough! Just like childbirth, there's no avoiding painful separation as a military spouse! I will say it's managable to simply be seperated, but when a child is growing without their dad, it can make a mother desperate and frustrated not to share it with her husband...but, who knows if you'll even be able to in a few years! Tough decision but it must be your own.    P.S. Amy S. Is cold, she makes marriage sound like a business. You'll always feel the vibe that you are simply a wife of a soldier (or sailor), but we know better...we're the other half of our soul mates.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	there is no 'normal' for military wives, as such...  normal is, he comes, he goes, he flies, he sails, he gets calls in the middle of the night and has to leave, with no mention of where he's going.  There are secrets, you will be alone a LOT, so find something to do with yourself. Hang with other wives, find a job you love and be prepared to leave it when you have to move.  There are no 'weekends' military are on duty 24/7...even when they're on 'leave' they can be called back.   Find some friends on base to help, cause they all know whats going on, even if YOU don't. (and there will be times you won't know.)  Navy are usually at sea 6-9 mnths of the year. You e-mail, snail mail, send packages, telephone.  You either learn to live on your own and like it, or get divorced. (and there are a LOT of military divorces.)  You learn to deal with everything on your own, cause there is no 'couple'...it's you there and him elsewhere.  Good luck !!!|`|014NXPfFaa	You can't bee too lonely when your heart is full of love.

Sunday Funday!|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Hookup with the other Navy wives where ever you are stationed, they'll help you through all this|`|rj5FE3Klaa	If he gets stationed at home, he may get a normal work schedule as civilians. His shifts may change from time to time. It is possible that he may get weekends offs and probably more(or less) when he ranks higher.  I guess for the first year, dig in. He will probably be deployed for months and possibly more than once to different stations. I don't know but I think medics are in high demand in general. So there is a higher chance that he may get deployed more often. If he gets a sweetspot station that need him to stay there and close to where you guys, live all the better. It's a gamble though. If a lot of people want that duty station, chances are someone higher rank got it.    My advice:  Since you already knew to an extent, that he won't be around for a while (nature of the armed forces), you should prepare yourself mentally for his absence. You could try working, getting together with other Navy wives or something like that.

iWLeHnlnaa	YES! and here's why:    Denying licenses to illegals in CA and in other states has caused very negative consequences. They are not able to renew their driver's license which is a form of ID, they are not able to withdraw money from their bank accounts, and now they cannot get auto insurance. So this just places more unlicensed and uninsured motorist on our road ways. Now if an accident occurs with an illegal behind the wheel, there will be no form of ID and no auto insurance, and this causes your premiums to sky rocket. Without being able to pull money from their accounts only hurts our economy even more.    http://www.totalimmigrationlaw.com/artic...  Ban on Licenses for Illegal Drivers Has Unintended Consequences    Often, when lawmakers attempt to solve a problem by introducing new laws, the laws fix the old problem but introduce several new ones.     But, allegedly in an effort to crack down on "terrorism," the state tightened its laws and eliminated several acceptable forms of ID. In 2006, applicants for driver's licenses were required to have a valid Social Security Number or visa.    The actual consequences of this law, though, are much less straightforward. An estimated 300,000 illegal immigrants live in North Carolina, according to sources. As their old driver's licenses begin to expire, they're finding themselves unable to get new ones. Without a valid driver's license, they can't withdraw money from a bank account or get auto insurance.    States that deny licenses to illegal immigrants (like California) reportedly have higher rates of uninsured drivers than those that offer licenses to this group - in CA, a whopping 25% of drivers are uninsured.|`|Gr99OjQuaa	either way they are probably going to drive. having a license will at least give you the piece of mind that they are competent enough to be behind the wheel.     just my opinion.|`|XFZmAMOAaa	No- they don't belong here.|`|AA10206116	No. If they want a driver's license, they should have entered the country legally. Public transportation is around for a reason. Americans use it, and they can too.|`|TKbYavhzaa	Yes, if it means they can also buy auto insurance -- nothing sucks quite like getting hit by someone who has no possibility of ever paying your damages/medical bills.|`|meFAMvhMaa	Only legal citizens of this country and his/her respective state should be able to obtain a driver's license and any other document for that matter. Reason? Because illegal is illegal. Why give a legal form of identification to someone that has already willingly broken our nation's laws? Many decent immigrants have waited and are waiting to do things the right way. Giving illegal aliens a free pass sends the wrong message to all of the foreign immigrants that are doing things the right way.|`|AA10045620	No, they should not be allowed a drivers license.  To have one is a privilege and being in my country illegally, they certainly do not deserve yet another privilege.|`|ukBX5OOsaa	No. If they want the privilege of being able to gain a license, then they should work to get citizenship.|`|CpTQagJOaa	They are illegals. They are entitled to no rights in this country.|`|VMTVnUylaa	Can you imagine what the insurance for an illegal would cost, as most probably couldn't afford the insurance, we would have a bunch of illegal invaders driving around in uninsured $300 Honda's with $1000 rims looking for an accident.    Do you know what I would do if I was hungry and poor, not break the law or piss on another nations laws.  If we all got to break laws because we were hungry and poor, we all would be living in a place like Mexico, no thanks.    If I cannot afford a car, I don't go steal one, your basically defending crime, I find that pathetic.|`|FpioJ7F5aa	Illegal aliens should not have access to drivers licenses anywhere in the United States.  Just because some have criminal conduct does not mean all do.    And... while you are correct there are other states that permit that, NONE of the states will allow a drivers license for the illegal aliens within a year.  Nor jobs by the way.|`|2d4bf519052c116a45ae533ba6db1671aa	no  1 they dont no how to drive and 2  the usa is poluted  the way it is|`|H7SQEM4Daa	No,they shouldn't.  The excuse that they are going to do it regardless is pathetic. Should we allow bank robbery just because someone is going to do it regardless.  The issue with drivers license's is that in most states,when you get a drivers license you sign up to vote. Since most times you don't even need to show ID at the polls,it would be very easy for an illegal to vote. Voting is reserved for US citizens.  Driving is a privilege.  Anyone that thinks they would actually get insurance if they were given a license is delusional. They'll just keep driving without it like they do now.  If you don't have a drivers license,you aren't supposed to be behind the wheel of a car.|`|AA10476668	This should be a no-brainer... (and people is spelled thus, not pepole-- good luck with writing that paper by the way).  Illegals have no right whatsoever to be on American soil, no less privileges reserved for citizens of the U.S. Our asinine government already offers them innumerable incentives to come here (government housing, anchor baby payments, free education, free medical (not technically, but they skip out on their bills). The middle class has supported these freeloaders for far too long and it's time the new administration do something about it. Obama scares me though-- he even has an aunt here illegally. I just know he's going to run with the brown people and try to jam yet another amnesty down our throats. It's so easy for these office-holding rich Democrats to divvy up our hard-earned money, isn't it? They're turning the U.S. into an impoverished, zombie state that will have a socialist government.

Most don't even register the car in their own name.|`|vet4adaYaa	Driving is a privilege, not a right, illegals have not earned that right through their actions so I would say No.|`|cvBkyVRyaa	absolutely not.  This should be reserved for people born on this planet.....   (lol)    Really, they should not.  The reason being is that a drivers license is defined by law as "a licensed privilege for law abiding citizens and residents ....".  an illegal alien is by legal definition not a legal, or law abiding anything.  Therefore they do not qualify legally to get one.    Besides that, they should be required to be able to read some and understand most english enough to understand how to operate a vehicle within the requirements of the law.|`|DdSYeCPuaa	Well mostly Aliens only drive flying saucers.

The sooner people accept this the sooner we can devise creative and dynamic ideas to help them become legalized, like a department for legalization. The backlog for mexican applications for citizenship/residency is between 8 - 12 YEARS.... it shouldnt take that long and that is what makes people so desparate that they settle for the work they can get as illegal immigrants. They will stop coming when start throwing company executives and HR presidents and farm owners in jail for hiring them.

SkOALXv9aa	I must agree with you.  Palosi is a danger to this country and should have never been sent to the house in the first place.    The voters in California in her congressional district should be real proud of themselves for unleashing this monster on the American population.    Here again she is a congresswoman with a  chance of being removed at the end of each two year electoins.  This dumb congresswoman actually feels that it is the majority of the people in this country that made her the third in line to be seated as the President.    She unfortunately was just appointed to another term and the majority of the House of the Representatives voted her in as Speaker of the house.  She doesn't have brains enough to know that at the most there were only 435 people who voted for her to be their speaker.  That is no where near the majority of American Citizens.    We truly need to start thinking before we cast our vote for supporting a candidate.  This is the same woman that rides around the country in a jet while she tells the rest of us we should be riding a bicycle as a mode of transportation.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Only her specific district can vote her out of office; not the overall American public.    She did misspeak, she meant 500,000 (thousand, not million).  But we are throwing some pretty big numbers around here; and constantly going back and forth between thousands, millions, billions, and now trillions.  It can be difficult to keep up with it all.      And there is some advantage to STD protection.  Most notably that we quit wasting so much money on easy-to-prevent diseases trying to cure them (or at least treat them).  Money that would be better spent fixing the economy; and that is true regardless if you believe a stimulus or a tax cut is the best way.  Because either way, we are trying to get customers to buy again, and it helps if the customers don't have various STDs and have to waste their money on treatment.          Having said that, Pelosi is NUTZ.  I don't like her either.  The way she defends things is foolish, and shows she just wants votes and has no idea what Democrats believe and why.  She just says what she thinks we want to hear, and is usually wrong on why.

It's money that's already there, and Obama (not Congress) said that it could be used for condoms rather than "abstinence-only education" which is what the Bush administration used it for.  Get your facts straight.|`|m5J36D28aa	The majority of the people believe she is doing a good job.|`|6JXrlnYsaa	The voters do not choose the speaker.  The members of the House of Representatives do.  And they chose her.  Twice.
bnA0wUPRaa	HA HA|`|ABmZYbDZaa	Well for one you don't do your actual clearance until either right before you go to BCT or right before you start DEP. You do an initial background check but since not all MOS's require an actual clearance they don't do those until AFTER you do your physical, pick your MOS and start the swearing in process (and have signed your contract). They will actually start it with your in DEP and you won't have it til you're in AIT (and some don't have it til they get to their actual units) because they take like 4 months sometimes longer to process fully.     If you failed the initial drug test and it was while you where at MEPS you are screwed. You will NOT be put in to any MOS that requires a secret clearance let along a top secret because honestly you're just to high of a risk. With you having failed your drug test you will more than likely have to wait no less than a 45 day wait before you can try to retest. Passing the next one though will NOT fix the clearance issue though so plan on choosing an MOS that doesn't require a clearance.|`|f9crUDTwaa	You blew it . What were you thinking ?|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	You are a total idiot and don't deserve to get in.  McDonald's is hiring.|`|wEOJyEw0aa	Never you would be lucky to get a secret clearance 10 years from now.once you come up dirty top secret is out|`|AA11452842	Hope you kept your job at Jack In The Box.

NO there are no ways around the CONSEQUENCES of  BREAKING THE LAW.    at the end of your first term of enlistment you can TRY and get a Clearance.   no guarantees it will be granted, but if you keep your nose clean, excel as a servicemember and impress your bosses, you have a better shot.|`|jHUAfrojaa	Nope, there is no way around the security clearance. Maybe get it cleaned out of your system and try again.    If I am correct you have to wait 45 to try again.|`|UoAZLRG8aa	Ya done screwed the pooch pal. No way you are ever going to get a clearance.|`|cvBkyVRyaa	Drugs usually clear out of your system within about 30 days.  If you are a heavy user, maybe a little longer.  Traces of THC can remain for months (up to a year).    You knew this may be an issue and you should have begun cleaning out your system immediately.  The other item is maybe you thought you'd skate through okay.    Either way, your hosed.|`|raImBqwraa	Hmmm, I think I see you're problem.    STOP SMOKING REEFER YOU DUMB SON OF A ZARK|`|neFd6a4paa	Did they open the investigation for your security clearance yet? If not, than you may still have a chance. It may be that your recruiter doesn't trust you anymore and he doesn't want to go through with the paperwork only to see you pop on another test before you ship. Were you honest with your recruiter when he was filling out your paperwork? Did you get a "moral waiver" for smoking Marijuana during all of this? You must have been smoking a lot for even trace amounts to be in your system 4 months later.    Jobs with a security clearance are very helpful both in the military and in the civilian market. I would find out whether or not your investigation was opened yet and then make my decision. If it hasn't been opened you may be in luck. How about taking a few months to get the rest of the weight off and getting in shape, staying off the drugs (if you are tempted) and eating right. This will give your recruiter more confidence in you.|`|jumISG9laa	sucks for u your security clearance is down the drain, oh well better luck next time...oh yea there is no next time...|`|O4dbps2Haa	you wont be denied a clearance, but you do have to wait up to two months, if you were just smoking weed. they characterize weed differently in the military, my boy was in the same situation.

Now that the record is there, you won't get top secret.
1XqmVsgwaa	Criminals have a right to be defended in court. It is a lawyer's job to present their case in the most favorable light and secure a not guilty ruling.    They may make police look bad. But honestly, I have seen a few cops destroyed in court and nearly all of them had no idea what they are doing. It's different if it's a rookie and he has never testifying in court before and is just nervous. But it boils my blood when I see a veteran cop not being able to explain the basic process for a field sobriety test or explain in the simplest terms how a breathalzyer works. Sure sometimes you get caught off guard, but the vast majority of time when the police look bad, it's their own fault.    Police officers get reputations. If as an officer, you quickly develop a good reputation for being honest, writing good reports and knowing what you are talking about in the court room, lawyers will be far less likely to go against you and they will advise their clients to just plead out. On the flip side, if local defense attorneys  know you are an idiot, you will see a lot more of your cases end up in the court room.|`|7b329de1125da97b2b85ba98f7bff76faa	The day that you need an Attorney let me know how you feel about them.

But I think lawyers see this in a different way. every person has some rights, human rights, no matter who they are. and lawyers usually cant change the law or ignore it, they just use it to their client's advantage in order to get them their rights back. they find a way to sort of bend the rules.   and not everybody who has committed a crime is a murderer, though they might be hugely irresponsible and a shame to the social community. a murderer is someone who kills another person intentionally and with a plan. he has been thinking about killing that person for quite a while. it doesn't mean that no DUI has an intention to murder.|`|4KlVkaDaaa	No one likes criminals, but the U.S. judicial system only works if both sides have legal counsel to champion their rights.  Otherwise, you'd end up with some tyrannical prosecutor who did whatever they wanted even if the prosecution was legitimate.  The right to defend yourself, innocent until proven guilty, is a basic tenet of American values.  If the prosecutor doesn't have a strong enough case to prove someone is guilty, then they likely aren't guilty.  Might be, but I'd rather a few criminals avoid jail than see hundreds of innocent people locked up with no defense.

More jobs have been lost to automation and the build up of the economies of India and China but the tree huggers and high taxes do not help either so push for lower corporate taxes which leads to lower prices of goods and a more competitive corporation or do you hate those evil corporations also?    You know why things cost what they do? The costs of manufacturing the product plus the cost of transporting that plus all the taxes plus the fuel costs plus the property taxes plus payroll...........get the hint. Corporations are a hierarchy of society. The more important your job is the better you get paid. My boss should make more than me because I am simply responsible for my area he/she is responsible and manages others.........By the way I am self employed
e6V3xf8zaa	Should is a different question than can.    Yes, it should be limited.  However, at the same time, the expense of campaigning should be limited.  Over 100 million people voted in the last election.  To send each voter a 3 ounce package with a minimal biographical sketch and a brief discussion of the major issues would cost appoximately 80 million dollars -- millions more than the position pay.      On the can side, it can't be limited.  Last year, part of the Bipartisan Campain Reform Act (McCain-Feingold) was struck down by a 5-4 vote of the U.S. Supreme Court.  That part had to do with fundraising.  In the 30 years since the post-Watergate reform of campaign financing, the U.S. Supreme Court has struck upheld some restrictions on fundraising and struck down others.  In that same 30 years, they have NEVER upheld a restriction on expenditutes.  As such, unless you want to amend the Constitution to establish some rules for campaign fundraising and expenditures, this question will remain in the theoretical.|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	Yes it should be limited. Its the only way to ensure the people have more pull than the lobbyist.
tDZMJue9aa	yes to help ensure you get it all back make sure its spotless when you leave, we had to do this once to end a lease early due to military orders, not a big deal at all actually|`|ABmZYbDZaa	Actually you can't use the SSCRA just because he is deploying. He is on TCS orders, that are unaccompanied. The Military will NOT pay for any move that you decide to try and do, You will NOT get any change in BAH. You are technically NOT authorized a PCS move at this time. your landlord doesn't have to let you out of the lease and he doesn't have to return any funds including any deposits because technically you are illegally breaking the lease.    ETA The BAH rate will be based on the SM's duty station (Permenant Assingment)  zio cide. So no, your rate will NOT change if you go away from the duty station for two months. If you owe the landlord money he is going to take that out of the depoist and then get you anything that might be left. At this point you are technically breaking the lease illegally and cannot use the  SSCRA as cover and he is not required to give you the same priviliges that it gives. You are NOT under orders and are not required to move. You are doing so on your own and therefore will be responsible for an cost encoured from that.

My perception of a liberal party, (and I've been to a few of these,) would be a bunch of snappily-dressed wine drinkers standing around in a room furnished with fancy wooden pieces, talking quietly about art and whatever was written in The New Yorker this month.    Come to a party with a bunch of conservatives.  We're cussing, drinking beer and shouting over the speakers, out of which we've got Ted Nugent, AC/DC and Hank Jr. blaring.  We're boat racing, we're flipping quarters into cups, we're getting naked and jumping in the river, we're riding our ATVs around and we're warming up by the bonfire as the sun goes down.|`|sf7lOcIiaa	Well, if we are making rash generalizations and assumptions, I would venture a guess (completely on the same grounds as the question poster) that all liberals have AIDS because of unprotected sex during orgies at parties.

I wonder if they serve cocktails that have holy water in them.|`|e2b21fd20c367dca35eaf27554ccf1efaa	I'm conservative. I play guitar, workout, write fiction, and have fun. I have bleeding heart liberal friends who are the biggest tightwads I've ever met. That may be a generalization, but I also live in NYC a big liberal town and the people here are just so self absorbed and always plugged in to their phones and iPods. I walk down W 14th Street or Broadway and look at all the scowling faces and I'm wondering what are these people so pissed off for? Obama won, didn't he? Maybe it's just the Obamamania wearing off?    But I digress. I DO have a couple of gay friends (yes, conservatives have gay friends too), and I'm surprised by the anger and intolerance shown to people who share my opinions. I honestly believe liberals are less tolerant and respectful of other points of view (thus the name calling...racist, homophobe, xenophobe, whatever). I know I'm none of those things. All I know is that conservatism in practice works. Who would like to go back to the days of Jimmy Carter? The media had a similar love affair with him back then, but it turned out that the man sucked balls, so there ya go.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Yes I have.    I've been to liberal parties too, all anybody does is sip wine with their pinky sticking out.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	I'm a thirty-something married mother of three with a career in the legal field.

I wouldn't subject myself to such boredom lol. I like parties where people actually have a good time! Where they let loose for a little while and have fun and discuss good topics, instead of sitting around on the couch all night pissing in their Budweisers whining "Obama this! Obama that! We'll get back in the White House in 2012 if its the last d@m thing that we do! How much is this d@m beer anyway?! Just like a d@m lib! Taking my tax dollars for this stinking beer! Lazy @ ...ss bartender!!!! Its Obama's fault!!! Its Obama's fault!!!" I guess that the good part of being at one of their parties, would be the thrill of seeing one of them literally self destruct and melt into a big green ball of slime.

ABmZYbDZaa	No, it is NOT. You can NOT drink underage while on base or post. In fact you will get into MORE trouble for doing so.     If you only knew the number of middle of the night phone calls we've gotten over the years with the words.....  "Come pick your Soldier up from the MP's/police/jail because they where drinking in the barracks/bar/club/housing area/wherever and aren't old enough" Or my favorite .. Staff Duty calls and says "Please Go get your Soldier from the county Jail. They where picked up driving drunk down XXX street 3 times over the legal limit... btw they are only 19 so you know the drill" Which means....  plan on bringing them before the BN Commander in the morning to explain why your Soldier was out acting like an idiot. And instead of just having to explain it to the CSM (if they where over 21 and LEGAL age to drink) you now have to explain it to him AND the BN Commander OH JOYOUS FUN! NOT !!!!    If the states legal age is 21 then the pose/base legal age is 21. You can NOT  "get around" or ignore that because you are on base/post. You try to and you WILL find yourself in one world of trouble.  Oh and BTW get caught drinking and drinking on post/base and plan on walking your butt everywhere on that base for the next YEAR you are stationed there. Because you WILL loose your driving privileges along with other punishments (like massive fines and possible jail time)    ETA2: Matthew I hate to burst your bubble but that is no longer true. We got here in March 08 so he could go to school and then actually reported here in Auguest and at that point the legal age was 21 (it had changed over as of Jan 08)  Also Jaurez has been OFF limits to Military personnel for OVER a year now and is still in effect and will be until further notice so what goes on there doesn't effect the installation.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Nope,     Military bases and post follow the local drinking age laws.    Which means if your based in the US, the drinking age is 21.    But if your based overseas, the drinking age can be as low as 18.|`|9tcv3TiWaa	No, there was a time when it would be allowed at clubs on base, but the legal drinking age is 21 and so you cannot.  The only place it might be an exception is if you are at an overseas base where the drinking age is lower and the command allows those rules to be in the on base clubs, normally they do not though.|`|h0rt6YJ4aa	No|`|tDZMJue9aa	umm no, if you like being a free person it is not|`|AA10709853	no it is not.   the on base drinking age is 21 Stateside.   OCONUS they have the option to either stick with 21 or abide by local national law.   Most have opted to go with the more restrictive of the two.|`|jHUAfrojaa	Yes it is.  My boyfriend is a Marine and currently going to school on an Army base, his fellow Marines and some of the Soldiers go out and drink and all of them are underage.|`|77412bb9d7b8758e0a32f247da6eaed4aa	No, it is not true.  Each base follows the local and federal laws carefully.  Now, overseas, they follow the local laws... for instance, Japan's drinking age is 20, so they drink at 20 there.|`|SkwdQLdVaa	nope.  I was stationed in Ft. Campbell before and you have to be 21 to drink.  but it doesn't mean that it never happens.  In germany and korea you will have more chances on drinking before you're 21, but it doesn't mean that the rule doesn't apply, it's just the matter of is it being enforced.  The local law in germany is that you can drink beer at 14 and liquor at 16.  the military is more lenient overseas but it doesn't mean that the rules in the states don't apply.|`|BUI2nlUVaa	No. You must be 21 years of age in the United States and on any United States Army Base over seas.  If you are in another country you can drink if the local law allows if you're off duty.    EDIT:  I'll say again, because of the people in here who have no idea what they're talking about.  If you are on any US Army base anywhere the legal drinking age is the federally mandated drinking age in the US, 21.  Off base, overseas, you can drink at whatever age the local law allows, end of story.    The exception to this is the USMC who lowered the drinking age to 20 in Japan and on special occasions to 18.  I'm pretty sure you asked about the army though.|`|3zlD0fYZaa	It's not true, but people still do it. Depending on where you are and who's in charge, drinking underage may be dealt with very severely or it could be the opposite. But regardless of how authorities deal with people who break the rules or how easy it is to not get caught, it is still illegal. Even overseas, the age limit is still 21, because US Army Soldiers are under US laws. There was this news article where they were trying to decide whether a certain soldier should be trialed under US law or Iraqi law, and his commanding officer insisted that he is under US law as long as he is on duty (this isn't a case involving drinking, however, but still establishes a statute). Whoever told you it is legal is either uninformed or does not abide by the rules.    Edit: I can understand that if you are off-duty overseas, you observe local laws. But if local laws allow you to drink legally, then it's not technically drinking "underage" is it?|`|9dd7255bfe9e90bbd64019154baae7a6aa	Only if the Base Commander makes it a such rule. He/She decides the rules    I joined at 17, went to Germany. As long as I had my military ID, I could drink. No one checked to see if I was 18...    Nearly all bases in the U.S. follow Government law of 21, but the commnader can change it on base. I've only seen it done once, then we had a change of command and it went back to 21. Didn't matter because I came back to the states at age 21.    One thing I did hate was stateside I had a roommate that was 18. Therefore, because he was under age, I couldn't have alcohol in my room|`|BLHMPuxQaa	At Fort Bliss you only have to be 18, this is due to the fact that Juarez, Mexico is 5 minutes away and soldiers were getting in trouble in Mexico. This may have changed more recently, but I know this was going on up to a year ago.|`|vXqpwmzvaa	The USMC will let you if your CO says it's ok but thats the only one to the best of my knowledge
1XqmVsgwaa	If it was a against the law to not charge someone, I would be very busy. Every time I saw someone flick a cigarette butt out the window, traveling over the speed limit, not use a turn signal, ect, ect, ect, I would have a stop them and issue a citation.     No, officers are given what is called "discretion", for the minor crimes (things like speeding, expired tags, red light violations ect), an officer can weigh the factors and decide if a citation or warning is appropriate.|`|mT21K1bRaa	They usually do if you have a clean record and are not giving excuses. Also on holidays they sometimes do. If you've had a DUI your not gonna get a break. If you've been to jail your not gonna get a break. If you have a squeaky clean record and they've met their quota they may give you a break if you don't lie or give excuses. Trust me they have see a lie better than a polygraph.|`|L0cFTcdfaa	The law is very subjective. It all starts with police and their relationship with the public. If they gave every speeder a ticket and citation courts would be overflowing (even more than usual) so a more effective way to deter speeders is to give them "close calls" in the hopes that they wont do it again.|`|u6ALw1gAaa	There is no law that says we have to charge everybody.  In fact it is recognized that we can exercise discretion and decide to charge someone or issue a warning.  The fact there is no law is how it is not illegal.    I only cite about 1 in 3 or 4 drivers that I stop.  Attitude has a lot to do with deciding if I should cite someone or not.|`|JqYxr9Ubaa	Not quite.  An officer can choose whether or not to punish a driver for speeding.      Think of it this way:     A cop pulls you over.  You say, "but officer, everyone else was driving over the speed limit!"  To which he responds, "Have you ever gone fishing?  [you say yes]  Well, do you catch every fish?"    In essence, the officer uses his or her judgment as to whether he or she should pursue a charge against a driver.  They have discretion as to whether they should ticket the drivers they pull over.  They are not obligated to ticked EVERY speeding driver they meet.     Bottom line, be calm, respectful and non confrontational when you get pulled over.  You stand a decent chance of being let off with a warning.|`|AA11494150	The purpose of traffic enforcement is to obtain voluntary compliance. If a warning will get them to correct their behavior, then you have done your job.    In my state, there are only two times when an arrest is mandatory: domestic abuse calls and warrants. Any other time, we can exercise discretion.     Our department gives out twice as many warnings as they do tickets.|`|emNCaAq7aa	Police discretion is recognized by all courts in the US. It is essential that officers be allowed discretion, otherwise every time someone drops a Kleenex the cop has to arrest and is never out protecting anyone.  There are no absolutes in police work. Things are not black or white/right or wrong. Officers are called officers because they make decisions.  The laws are not made by the officers. So an officer sees you going 17 miles over the limit. That calls for an actual handcuff and into jail arrest in my state. That is what the state legislatures, who are immune to speeding tickets often wanted, but you aren't a bad guy, no record etc. and most of the cars are traveling pretty fast so the officer writes a ticket for 14 miles over the limit. Your chastised and will likely try not to speed for awhile.

Iw6vqJd8aa	The only services you can join during your junior year is the Army Reserves and the National Guard. You go to Basic during the summer of your junior and senior year, then go to your MOS school after you graduate. While this is great for having something positive to do during those time frames. It has a set back, that a good recruiter will tell you. You are considered prior service. When it comes to any bonuses, college money,  or anything like that. You don't get to pick another job either. What you picked in the Guard or Reserves is what you are stuck with. Plus it is up to your unit if they want to release you as well. Its a hard and drawn out process. Go to military.com to check it out. That was 8 years ago when I retired. But I believe it is still true.|`|3xTNOevjaa	join ROTC and/or DEP.  but you gotta wait till 18.|`|aQ8EK9hraa	you can be 17 not 18 to join the military as long as you have your parents signature. you can not join the marines however until you have graduated high school because you need your diploma before you can join. or have your GED. you can enlist however before you graduate and have everything ready to go so that way after high school all you have to do is go to basic. but you are not considered a marine until after you graduate basic training|`|jHUAfrojaa	No, you have to be eighteen to join the military. You can join DEP, which is what my boyfriend joined, which is Delayed Entry Program. They basically help you get ready for boot camp and if you do it long enough, you can gain rank. It is a pretty good program to enter if you are FOR SURE you want to enter into the Marines.|`|zjp17TZcaa	Sorry but you can not go active duty your junior year.  you can join the delayed entry program during your junior year though.  You have have to be 18 or older to join, or 17 with your parents permission.  But good for you that you want to join America's Finest! OOH RAH!!!!

kPWGVeWhaa	HOAs are difficult.  However, unless a complaint is brought to their attention, they will not investigate.      How difficult is getting a waiver?  Pretty hard.  If they allow your pet, what's to stop them from allowing pit bulls and bull mastifs?      HOAs must maintain all rules and be very picky about things like this.    I would recomend that instead of asking for a waiver, you ask them to amend the rules and regs.  If you have a lot of owners who agree with you it might fly.      Perhaps suggest that they change the rules for weight to be more geared towards breed.  This is the real intent in most cases anyway.|`|z88IMXNFaa	It's a big deal with most HOAs.  Since they can force you to give up the dog, either get a waiver from the HOA, adopt a smaller dog or don't move there.

Some states don't even have common law marriages.|`|Avxa966Iaa	True most states do not recognize common law, and after just two years no state would....they were not married but they did commit tax fraud. You cannot file jointly if you are not married. Living together is not married. I would look out for the IRS to come looking for the both of them for tax fraud.|`|XRYAfxpTaa	Currently, only 9 states (Alabama, Colorado, Kansas, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Iowa, Montana, Oklahoma, and Texas) and the District of Columbia recognize common-law marriages contracted within their borders. In addition, five states have "grandfathered" common law marriage (Georgia, Idaho, Ohio, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania) allowing those established before a certain date to be recognized. New Hampshire recognizes common law marriage only for purposes of probate, and Utah recognizes common law marriages only if they have been validated by a court or administrative order.     If not in one of those states, no common-law marriage was in place.     Here is a link to good information and specific exclusions in the states where it is recognized.     http://www.ncsl.org/programs/cyf/commonl...

Iw6vqJd8aa	Yes, it is. The military is the Military. It shows responsibility. maturity, and the ability to follow orders and working on projects unsupervised. Don't screw it up. if you should decide to join the Active side of it, and have a bad discharge, forget it.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Truthfully, neither are all that important.    Civilian employers do not have access to your military records.    If you do not tell them you were in the military, they have no way to find out differently.    The biggest issue, is employment gaps, how do you explain a 2 year hole( or any number ) in your employment record.    Even if you tell them you were in the military     IE: list your military experience on the application.    Most employers, Never ask for your DD-214, and even if they asked for it, wouldn't know what it means.    I have never once been asked for a DD-214, i have never been asked, what kind of discharge I had.    As a reservist, since you probally had a job while in the reserves.    If you do not list your military training o a resume or application.    They have no way to tell you were ever in the reserves.|`|jHUAfrojaa	A discharge is a discharge, no matter if you are active or reserve.    If you are dishonorable discharge, then you are screwed, that will follow you for life.|`|iv9T4Ctgaa	IF you're in the reserves, you should know this.    The answer is: YES.|`|LLvzRJkiaa	Any discharge from the military is important. it don't matter if it's active or reserves. You're discharge will always be on your military record.

kPG2g4iSaa	Use earplugs *and* earmuffs. Put something solid between you and the transmitter. Get out of the way or increase your distance from the transmitter. Get an  LRAD of your own.    Because it's designed as a non lethal device, it is not intended to be used in a situation that could conceivably result in death, such as against a helicopter as this could cause the pilot to become disoriented and crash.    If the organization you mention are anti-whaling activists, I would use a completely different tactic with the whalers: espionage & sabotage. There *must* be at least a handful of Japanese who are sympathetic with your goals who would be willing to get a "job" with the whalers to disable their ships.    I wonder if it's possible to put something in the water that is completely harmless to the whales that they will eat and make their whale meat taste bad? Bad tasting whale meat doesn't sell well and there would be little if any way to overcome the bad taste.

Why would you waste such valuable time working your in military.  But, the answer is yes,but not recommanded.|`|zjp17TZcaa	I disagree with Peter K.  If you want a job as a bartender that would be cool.  It gets you a chance to meet people outside of the military world.  Sometimes we just need a break from the military life, and it is a good escape for a weekend.|`|4VzVfKvdaa	Yes, you can have another job as long as you have your commander's permission (there is a form for this) and the job does not conflict with or bring discredit on the air force.  For example, you could work in a bar as long as the bar doesn't promote anything else such as sexual lewdness....no strip bars or gay bars.  Also, since you brought up the bar jobs, legally you cannot work in one in some places overseas since under some SOFA agreements, you are not allowed to work in places that serve alcohol.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	first it depends on what your military job is.

DTSUJe2oaa	At a pretrial she may be questioned by both the State attorney as well as the defense, in some cases the judge will also ask questions of the witness to establish the severity or legitimacy of the charges, but usually the purpose is so the two sides can try to reach a plea agreement and avoid a trial.     A meeting of the parties to an action and their attorneys held before the court prior to the commencement of actual courtroom proceedings.    A pretrial conference is a meeting of the parties to a case conducted prior to trial. The conference is held before the trial judge or a magistrate, a judicial officer who possesses fewer judicial powers than a judge. A pretrial conference may be held prior to trial in both civil and criminal cases. A pretrial conference may be requested by a party to a case, or it may be ordered by the court. Generally, the term pretrial conference is used interchangeably with the term pretrial hearing.    A pretrial conference may be conducted for several reasons: (1) expedite disposition of the case, (2) help the court establish managerial control over the case, (3) discourage wasteful pretrial activities, (4) improve the quality of the trial with thorough preparation, and (5) facilitate a settlement of the case.    Pretrial conferences are conducted in criminal cases to decide matters that do not inquire into the defendant's guilt or innocence. Under rule 17.1 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, pretrial conferences for criminal cases may be conducted to promote a fair and expeditious trial. In practice, federal and state courts use the pretrial conference in criminal cases to decide such preliminary matters as what evidence will be excluded from trial and what witnesses will be allowed to testify.~

As an adult with children your age, I have a little life experience.. This post sounds like it was written by some punk who thinks they know it all. Usually, people like that don't know half as much as they think they do.    Money isn't an issue?  How, at age 15, do you propose to pay legal fees?  Are you selling drugs?  Because no part-time job at a burger joint will pay anywhere near enough to cover a lawyer and court costs.      No person can be forced into counselling, and it's even less likely that a teenager would have enough credibility to successfully argue thier parents into counselling.      Perhaps instead of "demanding" family counselling and planning to go to court, you try to work collaboratively with your parents to resolve what you think are the family issues.|`|z88IMXNFaa	No.  As a minor, you cannot sue anyone.|`|C7frzO9Jaa	No, you're only 15.

Most will give free consultations. tell them your situation and ask for advice on where to go from here. Also contact the department of children and family services in your county. you can get that by looking in the phone book under the county section. if you can't find it, contact social services in your area and ask for the number. look in the phone book once again in the county section. also speak to a teacher or guidance counselor, someone you trust who is older and wiser and keep talking to people until you get the answer you are looking for. you best bet is to open the phone book and call every Family Law attorney there and get a free consultation with each one. if they won't give you one because they say you are a minor, ask them what groups exist in your area to help youth like yourself who feel they are being abused or what have you. who have family problems and such.

0oV4pWPiaa	George Washington despised the idea of political associations, formed in such a way as to pit one group of citizens against another. In his farewell speech in 1796 he said:      "The very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish Government presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the established Government."    So to answer your question, I do not believe a two-party system is fair to 3rd parties. I believe two party systems divide America. We do not need two political parties, we need several. The American citizens political views do not all fall under the beliefs of two parties and if they don't they are forced to vote Republican or Democrat. I believe there should be several parties. Three, Four, even Five main parties. This way it ensures the best interests of the United States and gives the citizens a fair look at all the different political parties views instead of simply Republican and Democrat.|`|m5J36D28aa	That isn't decided by the parties but by the people.

But we do the electoral college, and the winner of a state gets ALL electoral votes for a state.  And since a 3rd party cannot really win a state, they can't ever get anywhere.

Marriage is a religious thing, now unless you have a church that will recognize your right to be married, I don't see it happening.    Abortion you are dealing with another life, it is not up to the Government to decide when life begins it is up to society and science to determine that.

Abortion, is taking a life. goes against the good book and against the word of the law. but i am still pro choice. why? I'm not entirely sure. it just goes to the point of when does life begin? i see it as 3 weeks after conception. and since pregnancies first signs often show at 2 weeks after, that gives the confused person a week to make one of the biggest choices they will make in their life.    Marriage  This is being effected by the faulty separation of church and state. they see it as the bible says one man and one woman may share the bond of marriage. where as most of the citizens see it as. the bible says love all gods creations. (yes that includes homosexuals and the devil himself.) and that all men are created equal. so what gives man the right to decide on weather or not how a persons brain works, determines on if they can get the same benefits that heterosexual people have? its not a choice. its how people are made. government should not intervene.    stem cell research.  i see no problem in this. stem cells can be harvested from skin cells, or from eggs. makes no difference to me. if it finds a cure for Parkinson's or Alzheimer's, or cancer. I'm OK with it. as long as we're trying to get something done.    the answer is no to all of them by the way.

They have to go through the same medical/dental screening process.  Then with a copy of the orders go to the Embassy of the country they are going to and get the necessary visa if they are from certain countries to live there as she is under the orders as well.  She will not qualify for the Government Issued No Fee Passport as she is not a US Citizen, she has to go under her own country's passport.    She can have a problem because she is here illegally.  If she was born to a US parent then she can get immediate US citizenship if the right paperwork was filed at her birth.  All they have to do it register her with the State Department as they are the ones who would issue her birth certificate and then she could have gotten a SSN.  So this is actually what can cause problems for her and him.  JAG cannot help her in any way if she is in the US illegally. She needs to get a hold of a lawyer to get anything necessary done.

jlXPsVfdaa	See the 13th Amendment.|`|AV0eejfLaa	it already been rewritten. it was amended after the civil war|`|2KI7LxUXaa	its called an amendment ...(crosses out stuff like that)|`|kwYxQp0Maa	After stumbling through the poor grammar, I think you are not understanding the constitution or how it has dealt with these issues.    For starters, slavery was addressed in the constitution, ie. the 3/5ths rules.  Maybe you should read it, as it isn't a contract and doesn't become void.  Amendments are used to modify the constitution when the country has deemed it necessary and appropriate.  And they weren't in 'cowboy' times either when the constitution was written, so that doesn't really have anything to do with guns or the purpose of the 2nd amendment.|`|64SObnr5aa	The constitution states that a black is considered 3/5 of a human.    That was later abolished through the 13th amendment.    Yes some of them owned slaves.    A different time, a different way of thinking. One can not fault them for that.  Only the most far thinkers would think otherwise, plus there were powerful forces, both economic and social that would assure that blacks be considered less then human.     That is why our constitution is the envy of the world, because it is so changeable and harder then hell to change -- but if change is needed, then it usually gets done.    Peace  Jim    .

c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	You need to go to the DMV as soon as you can and explain what happened. Someone may have stolen your new license out of the mail, or it may have been misplaced or lost for whatever reason. My dad works for the post office and he says that it's a sad fact but letters get misplaced all the time and many post office employees dont give a damn. He told me once he was cleaning an area and found a christmas card that had fallen down in between two bins that don't move, and he fished it out. The card had been postmarked TWO YEARS ago!    The DMV may or may not make you pay for a new license, it just depends on what their policy is, how much they believe you, what side of the bed they got out of that morning, what way the wind is blowing, etc. LOL. They may charge you a reduced fee for another license, depending on your situation. You just have to ask. If you get pulled over, just tell them the truth, and tell him your name and drivers license number. It helps if you have papers from the DMV with you, you will be less apt to look like just another liar out there. If you dont have the number memorized, they can still look you up in the system, and they will be able to tell that you are legitimate and not a suspended-license type person.|`|1XqmVsgwaa	I would have called them long before the 6 weeks expired, but that is just me....

A5RDhTAUaa	Short answer: No.  Whoever has the responsibility for the medical care of the patient must be licensed and be with the patient in the back of the ambulance.    Long answer and extrapolation: It may have been that the EMT caring for the patient may have only been licensed at a lower level and the patient's condition required a 'paramedic intercept', meaning that an EMT with a higher level of licensure was required to treat the patient's condition.  The EMT who 'hadn't graduated yet' may have been licensed at a lower level but had been going to school to up his level of training.  This would be a common scenario.  The question, then, becomes this: Was the EMT entirely non-licensed, or was the EMT licensed but only at the lower level?    Definitions:  EMT= Emergency Medical Technician  Paramedic= the highest level of training/licensure for an EMT  (there are, generally, three levels of EMT: Basic, Intermediate, and Paramedic)|`|lu4lqwnPaa	I do not quite get your question here.   Paramedic states 2 medics. So in the ambulance, there would be a driver, and someone else to aid the injured person.     If there is someone in the ambulance injured, then there should be an EMT in the ambulance.     If there is only the driver, then that would mean that the ambulance is a medical transport. Usually transferring something like a kidney, a heart, or blood.     If an EMT has not yet graduated, that person (not EMT) is not allowed to operate the emergency vehicle, unless there is some sort of emergency where the EMTs were injured and there is some mass emergency where someone has to commendere the vehicle.    interesting... and where does the ambulance driver pick up this paramedic? The Hospital? Im quite confused... There are many kinds of ambulances... The Fire Department Ambulance and the Hospital Ambulance. Also, on some occasions, private ambulances... which are you referring to?
zGVVxuFLaa	I would call the PPO (Personal Property Office) at your husband's boot camp or school and ask them.  Here's a list of phone numbers:  https://www.smartwebmove.navsup.navy.mil...    The way I read the regs, you are authorized mileage on one vehicle, along with per diem for driving days.  There is a provision for the military to pay to transport a vehicle within the US (CONUS) if there is not time for the military member to drive.  http://perdiem.hqda.pentagon.mil/perdiem...  I don't see anything about 2 cars, though I thought that was being changed.    I don't think that we've ever submitted documentation, but we've never moved such a long way that was still inside the US.  As I understand it, they just calculated the distance between the two duty stations (or your home and the duty station, in your case) and did the math.    Good luck to you, and welcome to the Navy!
dCewrtXaaa	You are only being called as a witness, not a perp, if your drugs were obtained legally with a prescription. It would be a good idea to get a letter from your doctor stating that s/he had prescribed those drugs for you, or else a copy of the prescriptions themselves from the pharmacy where you had them filled. Take those with you to court. But really, unless he has confessed to the theft, it doesn't sound like they would have much of a case against him, since if he denies it, it would just be your word against his. And do not talk to him. That would be a very bad idea.|`|IQq0wNqQaa	Did they arrest you? Just calm down, and call the number on whatever piece of paper they handed you. I would call your local police (non emergency) number, and ask about your court date. Have any paperwork they issued you, and any other information readily available. It doesn't sound like you are the one who is being prosecuted, though. It just sounds like they issued you a date to appear in court to testify against your (hopefully now ex) boyfriend. DO NOT tell him to run away. That is just asking for trouble. If you really feel like you don't want him to go to jail, then you can drop the charges. But in all likelihood you can plead with the judge to get him court mandated rehab. Good luck.

Meaning, an individual injured in a motor vehicle accident must collect payment from the at-fault driver. Many individuals include, (PIP,) personal injury protection in their insurance coverage for this very reason.    If your referring to divorce, Tennessee is a, "mixed state." Meaning you can use either fault or no-fault grounds as a basis for seeking a divorce. Some individuals choose to use the fault basis as leverage regarding custody rights, alimony rights, etc.

AA10709853	with only a GED your only option is Army, if even they are still taking GEDs.  no other branch currently accepts GEDs unless you also have 15 100 level college credits in hand.      the educational benefits are the same across all five Branches.|`|meFAMvhMaa	Visit all of the official sites for each branch. Put together some jobs you might be interested in and then research them and get all of the information you can. Try and talk with people that have actually spent time in the service in those jobs because once you sign up and go, quitting is a shameful option. Familiarize yourself with what you want and what you're getting into before you make a decision.|`|jHUAfrojaa	Marines. Ha ha, I say that because my boyfriend is in there, and honestly, I'm glad he did that. He is a real man and he is very respectful and very disciplined.|`|ymNM6mmzaa	If all you have is a GED, you'd better choose a branch that will accept you.      I think your choices are:    Army.|`|neFd6a4paa	Hmmm. Education wise. If you want to be ablet to sit in a college classroom instead of doing it via computer I would suggest a job where you are sitting down more. Believe me, just because you aren't in a combat arms related job, doesn't mean you'll get a rear echelon job. I would seriously, seriously suggest you look at the small handful of rear echelon jobs there are. These will be most likely to give you the access to an on or off-base classroom to take your classes. Anything else and it'll be severely stacked against you.     I went in with the same desire to get my education and didn't get to take any classes because I was in a super-high deploying unit in a very time consuming MOS that required a lot of field training. I really wouldn't change it, but it would have been helpful to bang out 20 or so credits now that I'm in college.      If I can think of a two off my head, there's Network Administrator type jobs (also can deploy just like any other MOS but a lot of them are in rear-echelon units on a base stateside or on a FOB) which requires some interest in computers. Don't sign up for some general comm field, because you'll most likely end up carrying a Radio (still a badass MOS, but not what you are looking for exactly) or fixing one in a hmmwv somewhere.     I guess you could also look at like Topographic Imagery (requires a security clearance but many of their jobs are rear echelon) or working on satelites or Radar systems (both require deployments but you have a higher chance of being in the rear).  There's also the Coast Guard, where you could try out for OS operations specialist. The working hours are pretty grueling, and you DO deploy with units, but you have a higher chance of being in an ashore unit.    The last one I can think of is some kind of Admin or Pay specialist. The problem with that is almost every unit needs them and because of their sissy sounding job, they are highlighted to augment units for deployment or training exercises. You stand a very good chance of manning a post somewhere instead of typing at a computer, but such is life.|`|JDxpjT34aa	Right now you can't join the Marines if you only have a GED, they won't accept you (they used to but not anymore).

It sort of depends on the career you want though and what each branch offers. The Army is more about brawn and it seems the marines are that way too.  Also, it matters what recruiters offer....always bring a tape recorder when talking to a recruiter! They screw you! Also, ask for a bonus...some branches offer up to $40,000, so explore and learn before you dive in or you might need to re-enlist when you don't want to. Be prepared to never know when you're getting out of training, especially with the Navy.|`|7AkY41Mjaa	navy

6Gfz125Paa	Rent: most states require you to give written notice.  Check the lease you signed originally.  If it says you must give written notice upon moving out, and you didn't, then you are responsible for January's rent, along with the late fee for not paying by Jan. 1.    Cleaning:  if you have pictures showing that you didn't dirty the apartment, you can challenge this one.  Normal wear and tear is allowed.      Notice fee:  I have no idea.  Challenge that.    So basically, figure out how much you owe based on the above, and subtract the credits.  You need to pay the balance, if it is positive.  If not, send her a letter explaining your reasoning, by certified mail.  You will need a copy of it if she takes you to court.|`|eulMjLtPaa	What exactly does she say you owe the money for?  Rent?  You gave notice, although in your state, or according to the rental agreement, you may have been required to put it in writing.  Double check that.      If she gives false information to the credit bureau, you can contest it.
d7667642d6476c7c373029d6c1a8327baa	You can order the application from Florida.  You will need to take the fingerprint card to a police department (any police department, it does not have to be your home town or even your home state).  Then get two color photos (size requirements are in the instructions with the packet).  You will need to get the application notarized (any notary public).   Don't forget to include proof of firearm training. License is now good for 7 years instead of 5.      Florida only requires that you show proof of a firearm training course with a certified instructor; there are no specific requirements except for live fire as part of the training.  Utah requires proof of training from a trainer certified in Utah concealed carry as well as firearms handling.  Therefore, it is NOT easier to get a Utah license.|`|AA10182211	Not through the net.

gasquENMaa	Probation is an alternative sentence to jail or prison. Denying or granting of such is not something that depends on the specific crime or level of crime committed. This is a judgment call made by the Judge based on different factors ( the likelyhood to reoffend, severity of the crime, prior history, pre sentence investigation results, etc).    Each case is dealt with individually, but as a general rule, first time offenders of non violent crimes stand a far greater likelyhood of probation. The greatest number of probationers are those that were convicted of non violent and non sexual crimes.    I hope this helps and you can find it useful|`|RNG1cT8saa	murderers

XRYAfxpTaa	Call the court clerk, explain your situation, and ask if arrangements can be made. If not, be prepared to have a warrant issued for your arrest.

However because you didnt know the datea nd it wasnt suppose to be until after the supervision. you will have to call the court house first thing in the morning and tell them whats going on. see if you can reschedule a date. if your really upfront and stuff and sincere they typically allow a rescheduling for minor offenses like that. the fine however... you should have been paying on that. i know with my fine if i skip even once a warrant goes out for my arrest. so i dunno as far as that goes.. call the courthosue and see whats up.|`|dfRaevsNaa	Yo...... IT IS NNEEEEVER GOOD TO MISS YOUR COURT DATE... ever  You never throw a bong kid.. eevvverrr...

Since, like you said, this is your first offense so they'll go light on you and reschedule.  You MIGHT have to pay an extra fine though but i'm not sure on that so you can't quote me on it...

Why don't you "not" go to the interview, let him take care of his business and whatever happens with the interview happens... then see where your relationship lies.     If he blames you, then he's using you.  If you still are together through the tough time, get back with him and take care of your business.    Your question reeks of being used.

bwWj3TkQaa	You don't need a degree.  Check with your local police station.  They will probably give you an application.  There are alot of background checks and paperwork to go through, then if you pass all that, there is a physical test that you have to do.  Upon passing that (which alot of people don't), you still are not accepted.  You go through a screening process, and if accepted after that (they even sometimes hook you up to a lie detector...especially when they ask you questions about your past).  But that is just the basics.    Like i said, your better off talking to your local police station and getting the facts on what you need, and how you can prepare.|`|083d6fafca78da36d20de847faf89803aa	Good luck.  Exact requirements will vary depending upon the department.  In general, they require a 4 year degree in almost any subject area.  Many officers receive their degree in a related topic area such as Criminal Justice, or Political Science, but the important thing is to study something you find personally interesting.  Since many officers are former military members (and its a simular skill set), you may find it beneficial to become a member of the armed services.|`|3956c292d9898cc425bc25b7923184b7aa	You MUST be 21 years of age.    You only need a degree in high population or metropolitan areas.  Larger cities prefer anywhere from an associates degree to a bachelors.  Criminal Justice degrees are standard in law enforcement, but they're not worth the paper they're printed on, if you ever were to get hurt and have to seek employment elsewhere.  I recommend getting a more universal degree like business administration for example, but you may want to check with the agency you want to work for, and see if they explicitly want a criminal justice degree only.   Being an EMT won't hurt your chances, and there are a few rural agencies in the United States that require officers to have EMT training.  Don't be suprised if your screened out the first time.  Most agencies want to be sure you're really interested in becoming a police officer before they take the time and money to train you.  You will be able to reapply after a time limit.  The State of Missouri allows you to attend a POST (Peace Officer Standards and Training) academy on your dime.  You must possess this training in order to be hired as an officer in Missouri.  Other states and larger cities will hire you without and train you themselves.    Just make sure it is something you really want to do.  It sounds like you're really intelligent.  This job can be very stressful at times.  You will lose friends, people will despise you based on your profession, and it a dangerous profession.  I'm not trying to deter you, but make sure it something your willing to see through if you commit to the training.  You may also check with local agencies and see if you can go on a ride-along.
96d31f2eb78b0da781f956843c10646baa	Your contract of employment should state how and when to inform your employer of any absence.  It may also state under what terms you may or may not be paid due to said absence.    If you informed your employer as per procedure it is unlikely that you will be penalised (though not guaranteed).|`|EBqFpZbjaa	If an employee has tried to get to work but cannot due to adverse weather conditions and the lack of transport, then the employer must just put up with it and soldier on with whatever staff made it in.    Lots of firms have been struggling down here in sunny London-on-Thames over the last few days.  Thankfully the snow has stopped, well, it's turned to rain according to the forecast.  Let's just see what happens, because I have this vision of frozen rain hitting the streets and turning the entire place into an ice-rink.    Transport here in London is more or less back to normal.  The main problem with London is that during any kind of disruption to services, what happens is that trains often get left in the wrong place and it takes about 24 hours to sort out the mess.

But I worked under a boss who was an absolute git so i did not make the effort to go to work, he was so arrogant he did not realise. If you can not get to work, equally as important, if you can not get home from work to care for your family, then you make the decision using your common sense and forget what the boss will do.

A NCO wants to go out acting a fool while on libery = all the NCO are put on lock down and are only allowed on base liberty.    that is usually how it happened in my unit|`|LYnCH5LNaa	a good NCO will accept its his or her fault when his or her soldiers are screwed up. lead by example, its leadership failure when soldiers are in trouble, but most of time it is really not the case.     in basic, sometimes recruits do hate each other, because some of them might be slacking or got in trouble and the whole platoon will get in trouble and get punished because of that. and it happens a lot. it's just another mind game the drills are playing.|`|Y0zwVG1Xaa	Your teacher has watched to many movies. Well not so much that he watched them, but took them to mean something. He can't tell you jack **** about the Marines unless he was one.   If you hate everyone in boot camp your not going to make it through. If everyone hates each other then nobody is going to make it through. Esprit De Corp is Morale. You want Esprit De Corp or high morale in a unit. In the military you will find the the more hell a soldier has to endure with his fellow soldiers, the higher that units morale. You might say "those devil dogs went to hell and back, but their Esprit De Corp never broke).|`|vGCEFrhuaa	The teacher needs to clean his filthy ***.|`|c59a4010def6f797e0a0e7c583f93ec6aa	How punishment is handed out is up to your platoon / company commander. Your teacher sounds like he never even walked into a recruiters office. Most likely you Sgt or Gunny will punish you on the first offense... depending on what it is, wage garnishment, no lib passes for a month or even demotion. Mass punishment is only excersiced in boot camp where you are broken down to succeed and fail as a unit. most of the answers in here will come from chumps that dont know the meaning of the title Marine|`|ymZlFYn1aa	Well I don't know about the Marines but I am an NCO in the Air Force and we do have to answer to some extent for what our troops do ON or OFF duty. Also, the basic training thing sounds right, too. Everyone hates each other and then all of a sudden they like each other when it's over.|`|QTQTdPO1aa	His Sgt doesn't necessarily get in trouble, but either has to deal with him himself or if the action is bad enough is asked by his (the Sgt's) higher ups why he didn't see his marine going south and what actions is the Sgt going to take to remedy the situation.
3yXhtBSxaa	All this is is the New Deal, 21st century style.  It will do absolutely nothing for this pitiful economy, just as the New Deal did nothing to get us out of the Great Depression.  We weren't out of the hole until WW2 started.    Since history is doomed to repeat itself, will we have to suffer WW3 before we get out of this slump?  It's scary to think about this possibility.|`|DS33Wl4waa	They're doing a good job of that on their own|`|3YRrGfkiaa	You don't have to "try" to make Republicans look bad.

I am going to be very disappointed if the Republicans fall for his BS.  This stimulus idea of his is not going to work and the republicans know it, I want this to be the democrat's baby.
PMRp2ZRlaa	I supposed that the answer to your question is this. It is okey to commit genocide by the government of Sudan to non muslim, and without no complain from other muslim nations, and Hamas can complain since Israel is not a muslim country?     The fact is, Sudan government deliberately used extermination policy against tribal people of Darfur ( killed 400,000 men,women and children of all ages) by employing a large Arab militia known as the Janjaweed. Janjaweed, employed by the government implimented genocide policy and was sent to various African villages to kill civilians, burn down houses, destroy crops and livestock, carry out mass execution, destroy vital insfrastructure, and committed wide scale rape to women    Brutal reports such as men being chained together and thrown into burning huts, women being raped in front of their loved ones, and children being kidnapped from their families.    In July 2004, .Human right watch released a report revealing internal government documents showing that the central government both armed, and coordinated the Janjaweed to carry out the genocide.    On July 14,2008 (ICC) International Criminal Court filed 10 charges on war crimes against Sudan President Omar al-Bashir, 5 crimes against humanity and 2 of murder. The procecutor of Darfur genocide expected within months?, to ask ICC judges to issue an arrest warrant to Omar al-Bashir.  Edit: When will this happen is a good question.|`|6B1sxgtOaa	What the first one said.  It is wrong no matter where it is done, but Children have always been the victims of war regardless of the race or religion.|`|ss0vy4tFaa	Hamass doesn't have a right to complain because they are the ones to blame for everything that is wrong with gaza.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Gaza made the news Darfur did not.

However, I won't get into it too much as I answered a question last night about Obama, got called Immature, and believe I am now blocked by that person.

(Who shall watch the watchers?).    New Hampshire has passed a resolution Feb. 4, 2009, that they will secede from the United States (Yes, really) if Obama and the Democrats in Congress do much more of what they have been doing. They have sent copies of this resolution to Obama, and to all the members of Congress and all the other state legislatures, and other states will probably follow their lead. This is history in the making!    Some of what Obama has been doing is absolutely against the U.S. Constitution. Some of the people who support him do not know this, and some know it and do not care. I think all of them, in both categories, are in for a huge shock.|`|0JL3Mg78aa	Wow, you really don't know history do you?  How about what Obama inherited from you-know-who?

AA11162346	It will force you,your children and all of your future generations into forced mind numbing slavery to pay for this unreal pork barrel spending package. It will only help the already wealthy and the States that know how to waste your money. The taxpayers of this country are being robbed and we can't do a thing about it.  I don't get it. Is this change and hope? This is chains and no hope if you ask me.  We will suffer for generations and I think that is just what the government of Obama wants. To keep our nose to the grindstone working every minute so we can just to try and keep food on the table and not knowing what is taking place right in front of our noses.

It helps the ones who have been saving for years to buy one. And the wealthy newly weds with a huge dowery from rich parents.  "First-time homebuyers could get a tax credit of up to $7,500 if they buy homes in the next few months."   Your husbands 10 cents a year raise is better then the 0 cents applied to the minimum wage raise given for 6 of the 8 years of the Bush Administration while the value of the dollar sank to 40% decrease of value. That is how we came to have the working poor.  That being said the construction industry will benefit, if not building houses, then building up our highways and bridges. Those workers wages will in turn lead to increased consumer spending with will stimulate other areas of the economy. This is not at all like the TARP bill passed under the Bush Administration.

Add:  You are 100% correct|`|pakIAYWoaa	this stimulus package is another in a series of mistakes, oh those that have no work will be glad to land a government job but the facts are the US has no money; not one penny we are in fact in debt 14 trillion.  The money can only be raised by taxes, borrowing or printing it...if we raise taxes it will kill any remaining business opportunities here, the rest of the world is about ready to stop buying and rolling over their t bills so that leaves printing money.  At Davos Switzerland they just concluded a conference for the post crisis global new world order; in April the g 20 meets and the world will plan to eliminate the US dollar as the worlds reserve currency, we are going to fall all the way to the bottom.  You can not borrow yourself out of debt, we are exposed as a ponzi scheme economy  We will see the economy grind to a halt the destruction of our dollar and a new form of democratic socialism  in government.  This package only helps those who get the money first because whoever spends it first will have more value because we are diluting the dollar with a printing press...there is no good news or easy alternative|`|mHdKANPNaa	The stimulus package is full of pork and spending of this magnitude will only make the economy worse. I don't see how universal health care and money for education is going to "stimulate" the economy. It sounds more like a liberal spending spree full of Obama promises.|`|50zbKv0jaa	its a stimulation package, most of the work force is employed so when you say people dont have the money, this is incorrect unless they have had a pay cut they have had exactly the same to spend as before. o course not a single house will not be built your being silly , the stimulation is about is about slowing or stopping the decline. it wont help some people, it doesn't have to , it is about total economy, your view is either purposely misleading or lacking in the most rudimentary economic understanding. this i very basic Keynesian economics , very rational very conservative|`|Am2C2Q0qaa	Whats in it for me? I think you have to think the big picture   instead of your wallet. In my opinion they are trying to jump start  industries with the quickest Adrenalin  shot to the heart to get   the heart beating again .      So theres some tax cuts- corporate and personal. Got to get   credit flowing and money lent. Can't be any more bank and financial bankruptciess.Infrastructure projects turn around sort of quick,  home subsidies for people who qualify to buy a house gets construction  and real estate going. Protectionist measures stop trade with good  partners such as Canada so thats out because then they    erect trade barriers as well.      I want to know when America is so out of money it stops fighting  expensive foreign wars and brings its troops back home .    People bought goods and services in the Great Depression and   fortunes were made. Someone somewhere is buying. Considering  what Americas done to other countries, this is not to panic over.  Its not like you won't get your bowl of rice.   When your rebate comes You can head for Walmart.   One day the bill for all this comes due.

City councils, state legislatures and even our Congress occasionally pass these things, but they have absolutely no actual effect.  They are total wastes of time, done for political effect rather than actual legislative effect.    Washington's legislature is not qualified to officially interpret the Constitution.  If they want to bring up an actual case they'd go to the Supreme Court.  They know states can't simply decide to be sovereign--we answered that question in 1861.

While sovereign powers and constitutional rights are delegated to the agencies of government, sovereignty itself remains with the people, by whom and for whom all government exists and acts.  Obama can only make and enforce laws.  Sovereignty (people) itself is not subject to law, sovereignty itself remains with the people, by whom and for whom, all government exists and acts.  Obama maybe can strip government employees, agents, etc. of their constitutional rights, but he can not strip you of your unalienable rights.  People do not have constitutional rights.  People own the constitution and government.  Only government and its employees, agents, etc., have constitutional rights.  Unalienable rights, which people have are far superior to constitutional rights.  Problem is you don't know what your rights are, where they came from, and how to use them.

If anything they are trying to get rid of it. Also its illegal for the US to use Active Duty or Reserve Military to police or control Citizens within the United States.

Most of us know what a "per diem" is.  It's like and allowance where you have to document your expenses and stick to a budget.  This true for most of the "working class" government, defined as those who are there in and out of administrations, otherwise known as career government workers.  Unfortunately most of the House are lawyers not efficiency experts or economists.    Hire the right people to handle the money and things will do a 180 degree turn around.The idea that you trust someone who has already proved they can't budget or handle finances successfully and efficiently with $80  billion and say "we trust you...go fix your problems"  is insane.  If they knew how to successfully run a business, especially where there is not this discrepancy between what the bosses make and what the workers get, they wouldn't have  gotten into the mess in the first place.  In Japan if a business falters, the upper-ups give back most of their salary to be split among the workers and to help fix the problems, even if that means stepping down and hiring their own new boss if they think that individual can do a better job.  Failure is not rewarded.
70503caf06f4695beca81e8a95fd439aaa	The word "classical liberal" is practically archaic at this point in time. 18th century advocates of democracy and liberty first used the term liberal to distinguish themselves from the monarchists who supported monarchial style governments and Mercantilist economics. The argument between the monarchists and the liberals are practically forgotten, but they do give some intriguing insight into human nature. For example, Monarchists used to argue that democracy naturally fosters a "winner-take-all" system, where elected politicians are only truly interested in securing as much wealth and power for themselves as they can before their term is up, which is contrasted with monarchy, which they argued is where the king has a vested interest in seeing his country to prosperity, because he will be passing it on to his son. They also argued that democracy fostered a sort of "rule by popularity contest", where the elected officials owe their success to being able to work the crowd more than they owe to their natural ability to administrate. Obviously, it would be foolish to defend monarchism, but the arguments remain an interesting curiosity.    Of course, the first party of America were the Democratic party, and being the party of Jefferson, was the party of small federal power, strong states rights, and a commitment to laissez-faire economics. Their political opponents were Alexander Hamilton's Federalists, who favored a strong central authority, delegation of the states to administrative districts, and laissez-faire economics (The founding fathers were decidedly committed to free market economics).    The mutation into their modern iterations happened around the 1870s. Though anarchism and communism were thoroughly rejected by the American people (who always thought of them as home-brewed terrorists), it left an imprint on society in which the unions and workers began to use the political system to secure more privileges for themselves. America is unique among the developed nations in that it has never had a Labor party nor has ever had a Socialist Party (at least any which are serious contenders). This is because labor sought to work within the system, not come at it from the outside. The democratic party, with its heritage of supporting the small guys (Jefferson after all, supported the small farmers and was highly suspicious of large corporations and large banks). Because of this political backlash against them, the bourgeois allied with the Republicans as a sort of counter-balance against politically backed favors for labor. Note that neither side has its hands completely free: labor sometimes violently went on strike, assaulting non-union members, while the bourgeois would employ local police, state militias, or even private bands of company loyals to break up these violent protests. This set the stage for democrats to be pro-labor left wing, and for the Republicans to be pro-business right wing.    Note that never in American political history has the Democrat Party ever been officially Socialst. Democrats were simply pro-labor laissez-faire until the 1930s and the arrival of two figures: Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and John Maynard Keynes. Interestingly enough, FDR's primary source of inspiration for his policies was Mussolini, as the Fascists in this period were considered the height of political and economic development. Keynes came up with the idea that the government can spend money to stimulate the economy, and the Democrats adopted this political platform. Even the Republicans did, to an extent, as the last "true" laissez-faire politician was Barry Goldwater. Republicans would find their political voice with Milton Friedman and the Monetarists, who advocated that the government should stay out of business and act as a sort of umpire to ensure a fair and level playing field.    The final transformation of the parties occured in the 1960's with the emergence of the New Left. The New Left was an emergent faction of the Democratic Party which was expressly allied with the civil rights movement. this was quite a shock for many on the left, as Democrats were traditionally for gruff blue collar workers, not for hippies. Nonetheless, the shift occurred successfully, and the American geo-political landscape was changed. Pro-war Democrats, Anti-Communist Democrats, socially Conservative Democrats, and White Southerners migrated parties to the Republicans (who formed the core of what would later become Neoconservatism), and Blacks and other minorities migrated to the Democrats. The extent of change offered by the New Left had in reality alienated many of its former constituents, and Ronald Reagan enjoyed the political success that he did because of the so called "Reagan Democrats", which were socially conservative blue collar democrats who longer identified with the Democratic party.    Hence, the modern incarnations of Left liberal democrats and right conservative republicans. The reason that classical liberals and contemporary liberals are at such odds is because few, if any, politicians still adhere to the Laissez-faire system of the American Founders. Modern Liberals do have some kinship with classical liberals, such as a support for the workers and a support for civil rights, but decades of influence from fascism, socialism, and keynesianism have permanently altered the economic attitudes of contemporary liberals, as well as contemporary conservatives.|`|G350VVknaa	How about naming some of these Democrats who are fighting with each other.  I've not heard this before.  What "bickering" are you hearing?  Have you run out of ideas for questions, like so many others in the political forums?  You'd be happy to see the dissension in the ranks, wouldn't you?   Are you a Republican promoting  "hate"?    ADD:  Your question implies that Democrats are fighting with each other and there is "all the constant bickering".  I ask again, who are these fighting Democrats?  They are, for sure, fighting with Republicans who seem intent on resisting  the President's every effort to clean up Republican messes.      As a Progressive Liberal, I'm sick to death of conservative ideas that are as old as the hills.  It's great to study history, but we don't have to keep repeating it!  To answer one of your questions:  I think rich politicians benefit from,  not Democratic bickering, but from all things proposed by the Republican Party.   They keep their loot, not in American banks, but in Swiss banks and those in the Cayman Islands.  You won't see those banks fail, while the huge gap between the classes in America continues to widen.|`|mHdKANPNaa	Classical liberals are more conservative than the contemporary liberals.

The news says, "Politic an A superbly called the dog black in a great display of intellect while Politician B attacked the other calling it a disappointing White."    Either is not totally true, but the news seems to like Politician A using adjectives such as superbly and great and intellect. At the same time they made Politician B seems aggressive and "disappointing".      I vote for B because apparently someone is really trying to pull my chain to get Politician A in there.  And since I don't trust CEO's, and CEO's actually run the news paper and hire people who are of the same "persuasion" as them.  These same CEO's who are chairmen on each others boards and hire lobbyists to persuade congress,  I vote for Politician B, because apparently they don't like him for some reason.|`|24ebc8edf978e269550ad9d8827de8dcaa	I voted for who ever wasn't the middle aged white guy and the clueless woman who doesn't know squat about the world outside of the US.

Yfjh3kBAaa	Congratulations Blame Bush, you actually said something which I agree with (we're getting closer to becoming friends!).      Yes, the human species needs to start standing for something which will prolong our existence on this planet, because it's our only home.  We need to start making better decisions, help make air cleaner, cut down on energy consumption and reduce our need for fossil fuels.  However, we can not do that now with the technology we have.  The entire world would go bankrupt.  It needs to be taken on small intervals, and build its way up to the ultimate goal.  Our first goal as a country should be making Conservatives not hate Liberals, and Liberals not hate Conservatives.  You notice how bad America became after the last election?  The country was split in half...and if you look back through history, when was the last time the country was divided in two?  The Civil War...do you really want something like that to happen again?      Obama is looking like Bush every day, because he has to.  That is only way he will be able to fix the mistakes which were made by the Bush administration.  He has to approach his new stance in government with a moderate approach, or else he will become the person as Bush became.  His popularity will die.      I didn't vote for him, neither did I vote for McCain.  The reason why is my own.  However, the way things are looking now, Obama will be doing the best good...uniting the country and also uniting the world.  That has to be done, and the only way you can do that is by approaching it moderately.  It is the same way as being good at being on a debate team, you have to always know both sides of the issue and you have to be able to support both sides of the issue.  I think he will do just fine, and I hope he doesn't change his tactics.    So, what do you think?|`|VM300US7aa	since obama won they just come here to complain.  up until the election it was a pretty even split, now it's sad republicans on here 24/7, and once in awhile i'll come on to laugh at them :)|`|PnmvsKqBaa	I'm a Republican & I do no like!

AA11156037	Lets think...     The Marines were feared so much that the WW1 German army called the Marines the "Devil's B-i-t-c-h-e-s"  AKA "Teufel Hunden"    There were a time that the North Koreans and Chinese in the Korean War were told to avoid the Marines based upon their Uniform (leggings/ spats) and to only take on the US Army.  They feared an all out pitched battle with marines even small unit attacks could be called off immediately upon realizing there were Marines behind the M-1 rifles instead of Soldiers.

I doubt many people outside the USA would know the diference between the army and the marines.|`|24ebc8edf978e269550ad9d8827de8dcaa	Not particularly, no.    But there is a logical reason for this.    The US Marine Corp is a fairly large force and by definition the larger the force the less time you can spend training each individual.    Most other countries have much smaller Marine Corp so they tend to train them individually to a higher standard.    The end result of this is that the US Marines are not an elite force in the true sense of the term.  Elite forces have to be small numbers to be able to concentrate the training to make them elite.    So you will find that they are respected to the extent that the US military is respected, but not more so with the idea that they are in some way "special".
z88IMXNFaa	Your father can dispose of his property any way he likes in his will.  No one can change his will except that there may be a law forbidding him from completely disinheriting his wife without her consent.  He should have a lawyer (disinterested 3d party) draw up a will.  The lawyer and his/her staff can later testify to his mental competence if that becomes a matter of dispute.  He should also appoint someone other than his wife or one of his kids as the executor (like the lawyer)so he is assured that the provisions of the will will be carried out.|`|kacLYFrHaa	I assume she could make a claim that your father was not of sound mind when he sought to include you in his will, in which case if her claim was believed correct then I expect she could legally block you from an inheritance. When making a will a person is supposed to be of sound mind. Now that person could be of sound mind at the time they make the will, but unless they have a witness to atest to it then someone else could claim otherwise.|`|12856f47d9afb93373e530d04e8ec61caa	Your getting of a share to your father's will depends on the laws of the country where you reside.  if you really wanted some legal advice, why not directly ask a lawyer in your area.  if his explanation seems to contradict what you previously belief, ask for a second opinion or even a third.  Of course with lawyers in your place.    Being included in his will is his prerogative no one can change that.  However, to me the will executory will depend on the law of the state or country where you reside.|`|XRYAfxpTaa	Your father is the only person who can change his will unless it is a joint will.  What you need to be sure of is that they do not have a joint will because they can be very difficult to probate. If he names his wife as executor, and states his share of the estate remains in her possession until her death, the court will accept the provision.|`|cN6AMupIaa	your father should go to a good lawyer to get his will made in the way he wants to distribute his assets. If he thinks the wife may try to change it he can have legal wording put in to prevent that happening.  As you claim she may seek to have him of unsound mind if he changes the will get him to see the family Dr before he goes to the lawyer and ask him for a letter of mental competency. This should be held by the lawyer with the will and could  help with anyproblems if thet occur later. Best to get a legal eagle to sort it out.|`|96d31f2eb78b0da781f956843c10646baa	If you are in the UK your step-mother will not be able to make any changes to your fathers last will and testament - any attempt to do so will be fraudulent and open to prosecution.    As the executor, your step-mother must carry out your fathers wishes exactly as stated in the will.  On the death of your father you may inspect the will.  If your step-mother attempts to influence and/or change anything contained therein, you may challenge her.      Wills can be very contentious, however, as you are a close family member. and you do not believe that your father was fully responsible for the contents, it may be challenged in the appropriate court (a lengthy and expensive procedure).    Oh!, you're in the USA - why post a legal question in the UK/Ireland section?|`|eeaXYyCNaa	Yes, unfortunately.  Well, I know that in the state of Georgia she can.  Sorry|`|3yXhtBSxaa	I haven't taken a wills and estates class for years, but I can tell you I don't think this woman has a say in the matter.  Your father's not dead yet.    You need to get yourself a GOOD lawyer, one who deals primarily in Wills and Estates, okay?    Don't take my word for it, since I am just a legal analyst, not an attorney who is authorized to practice law in your area, but it seems to me that this woman is very domineering, and if your dad does something to exclude you from his will, it might be under duress.  Anything, such as contracts or wills that are proven to be signed under duress, are considered null and void in a court of law.  Discuss this with your attorneys.    And even though Paul H. is in the UK, he does make some valid points!  Get ready for probate, I'm afraid, which IS very lengthy and expensive.      But again, please talk to an attorney who specializes in wills and estates.  It will cost you, but it will be well worth it.|`|PlEEZTRsaa	Absolutely not.|`|AA12181625	its his choice i don't get it.how can that be questioned.a will will keep anything from going to a defaulted person alone.that's the purpose|`|45a2d78be5d5ed4c4b9533acffae073baa	While I know nothing about Georgia laws I assume that the will is strictly between the person with the property and his lawyer.  He can leave his money to whomever he wants and can name his own executor.  Why don't you try to find out as much as you can on the Internet about Georgia law?  If there isn't anything than you'll have to talk to a lawyer who practices in Georgia.  It's best to know what you are up against before you start taking steps which might make the situation worse.
AA11494150	You don't need to have good credit. You just can't have bad credit. Average credit is just fine.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	If you have had repossessions, defaults, foreclosure, etc you will probably not pass background check.    If you are sometimes late on a bill or two, it should be okay.|`|1XqmVsgwaa	I disagree with the above people.    It really depends on the police department. My department checks credit, but if you are honest about your credit and can explain why you have poor credit (being young and stupid, losing a job, medical bills, ect) it won't effect you at all.    I know other departments that don't even check credit at all.    Sure there are some that take it seriously, but slowly work on repairing your credit and be honest and you will definitely be fine.
9PoGLVmXaa	First they don't use still born, they use aborted only. The problem is not how they use them but the act of aborting them, which is murder. As to my personal belief, I had a stroke a few years back and still have a lot of weakness on the right side. If they find a way of using an aborted fetus to make me better, I won't have it done. You won't justify murder by giving me some help.    Added:  Who made you god to say who should live and who should die because you or some doctor knows which is better? And no the only ones against abortion are not just girls, I am a male.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	They do genetic research with every newborn that is born alive in the USA anyways..it is mandatory for the hospital to submit a sample to the Department of Homeland Security under new law S. 1858 (so dead aborted fetuses are the least of our worries)...This research incudes genetic testing and cloning... and when was the last time you were vaccinated?  aborted fetus diebold cells fill the ingredients of vaccines...just call merck technologies and they will release the information to you over the phone.    Pesonally..on live babies, it is a blatant violation of constitutional rights to mandate the sample without informing the parents of the legislation and give them an opprotunity to decline.  If the DHS wants a sample of anybody's DNA..they should provide a warrent. On the aborted  fetuses  body (and dead cells, by the way..rigamortis sets in the moment of death), they should be discarded like the mother intended in the 1st place. The mother waived her right as a parent when deciding to go through with the abortion..so "upon her wishes" is no longer  relevant...|`|uXVbvEX3aa	I don't have a problem with it as long as the parents allow it; however, I don't want that to create another abortion lobby.    It's the same as donating your corpse to science when you die.|`|z88IMXNFaa	I don't see any.|`|ide4Hi5gaa	Its killing a precious baby, because someone is to sorry to take care of thier on baby, so they hand it off to sience to do research.

Any of these men or women could go into the private sector and make ten times the money.    We should pay our public servants well if we want to get good ones.|`|dCewrtXaaa	Most state and national agencies and many private businesses consider that their employees deserve to maintain the same standard of living from year to year, without suffering a decrease due to inflation. Congressional representatives must maintain two residences, one in DC and one in their home state, and they have unavoidable travel expenses. What they get paid is not at all unreasonable under the circumstances, and it is far less than the private sector.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	They serve our country. That is a noble cause, so yes I think the deserve it.|`|AA12020119	No. I think they are generally underpaid, as is the president who earns $400,000 a year, which is 26 times less than the CEO of Anthem (including bonus)!

I've worked for them, so I've seen that a lot of the big wigs don't do sh...t more than half of the time. I can't even phantom why a President needs "$400,000" to live off. (No smear on Obama.) But c'mon. The housing is paid for, and that's one of the biggest payments that comes out of the average citizen's paycheck each month. Heck, I'd be a millionare twice by the time I left the White House if I was President lol! I'm serious. I can seriously stretch a dollar now lol!

LTS3GCpQaa	No I have never seen any ---      In truth I have never even seen weird stuff in the sky --- except the weird stuff I know full well is being done by us.    But yep -- I do believe - I believe the entire universe if full -     There are little wee micro organisms that live in between your eyelashes (Google micro organisms )  there are things that we can see growing out of the rocks on the earth  The Arctic and the far flung regions of our tundra are full -- even past the tree line - things live      We go into the oceans and we keep finding stuff - There are regions of South America and even China -- and they find stuff there as well .     The solar system is set up in a manner so similar to the structure of an atom -- it begins to make you wonder - Especially when the quantum scientists tell us about the "measurement problem" where the particles that make up an atom only exist in one particular space if there is an observer to see it -     There have been military studies on the impact of emotion on DNA and humans do impact the very core samples of life's building blocks -- by feelings      Not only that but a sample of DNA was taken 400 miles away from one donor in the USA and there was still an instant impact or change on the DNA sample --- based on the persons emotional state !     Russians found that photons bent around as if programed by human DNA and then behaved as if the DNA was still there after it was removed ---      Your emotional state not only impacts the DNA in you --- but still after it is removed - your emotional state alters the behavior of sub atomic particles      ---------- And here we are - on a planet in a solar system that looks like an atom --      Aliens -- now seem probable - the universe is full and if mother nature was to find a vacuum -- it would be filled instantly I am sure of it|`|iqGY5jvfaa	The cut my grass twice week|`|DgiLScABaa	no|`|86990ea910ba06fc1046c0e615f983d3aa	Haven't seen any but if there is life on this planet, it's not too far out to assume there could be life on other planets.|`|VMTVnUylaa	I find it hard to believe that earth is the only planet with intelligent life, the universe goes on forever, the possibilities are endless.|`|mmFz64MFaa	hellz yea I do see all them shiny things in the sky well thats just our galexy imagin the other 1s|`|10knD5g0aa	No, definately not, they are not real, they were created by Hollywood, there is no SOLID evidence that they exist.. sure you have lots of people claiming to have seen em but you also get people claiming to have seen Bigfoot and Loch Ness, media hype, bulls**t!!!|`|T7NkIRXMaa	i havnt seen any.

And yes all of my family have experience something odd that I know & I'm certain of is that what ever it was, could not have been from this earth. It was about 2:30am, that our family found ourselves traveling through Area 51, Nevada, I remember this long stretch of road, dark and so lonely. That in fact I had started this conversation with my husband of how we had not seen no other vehicle for hours, and started feeling a little scared! About 3:00 I believe it was we were going about 80mph, pretty darn fast when suddenly out of the corner of my eye I see that something lifted up so fast up to the air that I know was no helicopter or in that nature I meen this thing was oval shape colorful lights and I mean it literally when lifted up to thin air in a matter of seconds, with no sound what so ever but lifting up debri, and slaming against our vechical & at the speed we were going we are lucky that my husband was able to control the truck, it broke the windshield through us off road, and as it seemed to speed off far into the dark night & us lose sight of it, it started coming towards our vehicle that I'll never forget, this horrible day and the feeling that take over, as if this was the end, oh my god since then I've never spoke of this or traveled through Area 51, ever again.       I guess in order to believe that we are not ALONE you'd have to see or experiance something out of this world?|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Of course there are trillions of planets out there.

Go play in traffic.|`|IUXriZQJaa	You say this because you don't know what the democrats are actually up to.    Higher taxes are not good for the worker.  Taxing industry so heavily that they move offshore is not good for the worker.   PAying companies to move away (*YES* democrats do that) is not good for the worker.  Extending government-backed loans into the poorest sectors of society (Obama did that as an activist involved with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and then helped FORCE banks to initiate bad-risk loans) is not good for the worker.  Actually, most small business owners I know are quite conservative, because they know from experience being in business that the democrats are not their friends.    --------      Cantcu --     "Now that is a good question!"    If by that you mean one which demands a response, yes. A fool must be answered according to his folly, lest others think him wise.    "I know that they are and all I can figure is that they are the party of the rich. They don't represent American workers."    Yes, actually they do. They represent those who employ and enrich the American worker. They represent the development of wealth by the poorest of the poor into successful, viable businesses which can employ workers and build the economy.    "If it were not for Democrats there would not be a minimum wage,"    That's a bad thing? Do you know what minimum actually does to the economy?    " a 40 hour work week, vacations, overtime, OSHA, mandatory breaks or even unions. We would still have 12 year-olds working 10 hours a day 7 days a week!"    Care to list your sources for this (and don't say your mind)?    "The Republicans just voted against the equal pay for equal work law!"    Have you looked at that bill? All it was is an empowerment to fascism. You dislike Republicans for that? No surprise.    "I really haven't a clue why they are so anti-worker and anti-poor, and always have been! "    Again, a lie in its entirety (except that you really haven't a clue). You're good at those.    "Seems to me without the workers there would not be a United States!"    Three  true statements in your entire response (all grossly misrepresented and/or willfully misapplied)... Wow. They say rats won't eat rat poison unless there is some good food mixed in with it.    --------    Younis --     "if republicans agree on Obama programs , they admit that they was wrong and hitting americans deeply."    Care to learn English so you can read what these people actually do and write legibly about it?    That would put you one step above most of the participants in this question.    --------    O.I.A.M. --    Exactly. he hasn't a clue, just like cantcu. Perhaps they are twins..    --------    Charlie7 --     Except for your appeasementist stance, you hit the nail on the head. The Republicans were hijacked by the globalists, who are the same ones controlling the Democrats.    What we see is a smoke-and-mirrors football game being played with our time, energy, money and national resources.    All those loans will come due, you are right. So will the loans required to fund TARP and the "stimulus" package (which includes an unconstitutional provision barring any school or organization receiving ANY assistance directly or indirectly from it from ALLOWING religious worship . . . )    How many trillions will the globalists of Democrat and Republican stripe demand for these bailouts before they have to admit that it was bailouts which lengthened the Great Depression into the 1950s despite our industrial growth during the war?    --------    Just a Girl -    Chill out, will you?    Hate doesn't solve anything.    The fools who promote these social and economic evils will be thought wiser than someone who spouts hateful rhetoric.    I am sure you have reasons for your concern about these troublemakers, but try a different approach.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	That is the purpose of the Republican party to destroy everything America stands for.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	there is a real big difference between a neoconservative and a real conservative.  you seem to be defining the neocons.. real conservatives (I have having to use the term "real" but it is more than relevant..considering our party was hijacked by these war mongers) do support the american citizen and the worker.      we hold stong values when it comes to constitutional law..and the bailouts are extrememly unconstitutional. the government should not be stepping in to "rescue" anybody..it is the states responsibility to take care of their own. and it only henders the american worker (taxpayer) in the long run.  In my (and several others) opinion..Obama is only throwing kerosene on the fire..the other 2 bailouts were proof that expansive government planning would not work..so why increse government and print more fiat money while devaluing the dollar and bankrupting the taxpayer?    Not to mention..all this bailout/stimulus (call it what you like) talk seems to be distracting the american worker from what we are doing in pakistan.  we are getting ready to invade another country..now we already are fighting 2 wars that drain the taxpayer of trillions of dollars a month...while we continue to take out high interest loan after high interst loan from china to fund our military industial complex.    the real issue is the federal reserve banking system. until we can talk about where the money actually comes from (opposed to where it supposedly goint to) then we will only spin circles around eachother instead of stopping and addressing the real issues that got us into this mess to begin with|`|DgLBtjWoaa	-snort- That's just a stereotype.

They don't care about the ordinary American citizen worker.     They know the game is won by BIG money......and that's who they appease.     What they didn't see coming this time.........was the nickels and dimes adding up from us "chumps."     I doubt they will fall for the same trick twice though.

In the past, federal employees who went on strike faced various penalties, but Reagan not only fired them, he also permanently barred them from working for the federal government again.|`|Ot8Ig9Jkaa	When excessive power over labor and business was put in the federal government.

If they can't succeed, they don't want anyone to.|`|Uh2vfl5Uaa	What's your question exactly? We all want and resent what we don't or can't have. It's simple.|`|Q7ovix19aa	That's not a goal.  That's normal.    A recent study found that people would prefer to make 50,000 while colleagues make 25,000 than to make 200,000 while colleagues make 300,000.  How stupid is that?    Apparently they are more concerned that others make more than them than they are with a higher income for themselves.  That shows envy and jealousy overwhelms reason in most people.|`|cae903cea51e27b7f33677a9e540a4b5aa	Wow, people whom feel that way about a person that have succeeded in life, is plain and simple not content with their own life. It's sad when people feels that way, but the thing is there will always be people like that in this world.|`|qhBKqGdwaa	thats an unfair generalisation of all americans, but in regards to the few people who really do suck welfare & hate the rich, it's called jealousy.|`|P6sR82B8aa	i  dont know|`|rH4eUC9Baa	Yea, that's pretty much ameriKa.

Todays rich are mostly Paris Hilton calibre. They're just born with a name and I guess to see them just be so foolish and arrogant with money is what makes people despise them. Bill Gates is a good model. He even made his children earn the money they make. Thats good. I never called anyone who worked hard and succeeded at a thing and inspired others to do the same and show some kind of respect for others without a cent in their pocket an idiot.|`|2FA9qNHzaa	Not everybody wants to be rich.   What most people want is an opportunity to be successful, carry out their dreams for themselves and their families and live in relative peace.   That is something that America has offered so many, but the dream is dying, not only because we have enemies off our shores that hate our prosperity, and people here that hate it too since they're too damn lazy to pursue that dream themselves.
cWjrtIlKaa	If there is no proof its his word against hers. I would think that he shouldn't get in trouble because of this (or at least not severely), but what they should do is show that the reason for the accusation is caused by stress from the loss of her mother and a feeling that she feels she needs revenge. Unfortunately, him leaving the country doesn't help matters because it makes him look guilty.    Good Luck, Hope Justice Prevails.|`|YRTYXfggaa	Doesn't he have a lawyer?  If not, he needs one!

Just when you go to court, tell him to stay calm and don't lose it. Be honest and don't studder and answer the questions fully.

92gN7RVPaa	I don't know why they get so touchy when it comes to her, honestly, I feel like they actually want to stand up for her instead of just doing it because they don't want their party to look stupid. Sarah Palin deserves to be criticized, especially when she continues to make herself 'the victim' and flaunts around television reporters talking about how she wasn't treated fair.    Obama goes through the same things everyday, from the bashing, to the mistreating. We're not whining about it, and neither is Obama.|`|ciAAdMd2aa	I am not a liberal and I think Palin is funny... in a untintentional way.  Anytime she opens her mouth its funny... a lot of times I comment on her stupidity.  I can't help it... Of course, it would be easier to stop talking about her if her fans did not bring her up 6 times a day.  Talk about making your own messiah.|`|kOsJ63KFaa	I tend to favor the Republicians veiws on almost everything. But I must say, I don't care for Palin either.

SARAH PALIN SCARES THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS OUT OF LIBERALS.|`|mHdKANPNaa	I haven't seen her in awhile.

I'll take Palin over Pelosi every time.|`|Yhxc1gs7aa	I find it interesting that Mrs. Palin complains about her treatment by the media during the campaign when it was she that drew first blood.  During her convention speech she said....    "I've learned quickly......that if you're not a member in good standing of the Washington elite then some in the media consider a canidate unqualified for that reason alone. But here's a newsflash for all those reporters and commentators: I'm not going to Washington to seek their good opinion."    I remember her saying that and thinking, missy, you just cut your own throat. Now she wants to whine, piss, and moan about how she was abused by the media when it was her own big mouth that brought on their wrath, and it is her own big mouth and bloated ambitions that will be her final undoing.|`|L0Dp5uYWaa	To tell you the truth, on here, the majority of people obsessing over Palin are her so called haters. It's weird, usually when I dislike someone as much as you all claim to hate her I keep as much distance as I can from that individual.|`|2FA9qNHzaa	There ya go again....   Doing exactly what you say you don't like.   If you don't want to see her, change the channel.  But people are fascinated with her and respect her more than many politicians.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	A lot of people didn't know who she was before the elections so it was easy to rip on her.

31edb7797d765f1300c12d8242a8f21caa	It is an essential part of the far left's scheme to make America a one party  ("democrat") country and completely take over the government and the economy and the institutions. Once the floodgates on immigration are opened wide and all the illegals registered and allowed to vote the leftloons own us all. It was a great nation while it lasted.

EVERY candidate that wants to replace an incumbent needs as many new voter registrations as possible. Sen McCain was a staunch supporter in 2000 when the Dems were in office. The Republicans will support the organization again in order to try and unseat the Dem majority in the next election.    Workers who are paid by the registration cheat and fill out all kinds of numbers of them to increase their pay. It is left up to the precincts to properly identify the ones who actually vote. Although it makes good sensationalism, I seriously doubt the falsely registered cast votes in any significant number. It is much less a problem than votes that get "lost" from precincts that are strongly biased.     To answer your query.

Otherwise, Hitler evidently had some sick role models, hard as that might be for the present inhabitants of England and America to admit.     Hitler took it to a whole other level of magnitude, no debate about that, though. There's sick, and then there's Hitler.

We arrested and put AMERICANS who were of Japanese ancestry in them, then we stole their land! Of course we didn't do this to the Germans!    We practiced a lot of genocide in this country. I guess the main difference is that we have been learning a lesson from it NOT to do it, which is the message that Hitler did not think through. Of course at the time we had not either as they lynched blacks in the South!    One thing about America seems to be a pattern! We don't learn from history.

I disagree with you Trout, he has already ordered strikes against targets in Pakistan and Afghanistan which has killed innocent civilians, 15 days into his presidency and this guys hands are already bloody...this is following a failed Bush policy of indescrimanent cowardly murder using predator drones..if you want to take out some talibans parachute in some snipers to do recon and take out the bad guys, dont kill the bad guys and slaughter the innocent families next door and across the street as well.  Cowards... Thats the reason why I hope this administration turns this stuff around fast or fails..our country cannot spend the money on the military industrial complex anymore...with my state unemployment rate at 11% and my state of California being bankrupt we live in an uncertain future.. then I vote for a president who lies about change... what a joke!!!!!

uNyv2ka8aa	Laws in themselves are are based in religious tradition through out the world.  Most making of laws grew from a practical need for protection of society from such things as poisonous foods and plundering by waring tribes.  Today, we apply the same reasoning.  Doing 55 in a school zone would mean that you could not stop in time if a child were to suddenly run into the road.  Laws are also made and enforced for economic reasons i.e. monopolies.      It is the misapplication of the laws or the overstepping of legal bounds that creates a problem.  For instance, a policeman who falsifies a police report by changing one word or phrase to bolster his case against you. (I just read yesterday that 20% of police reports  have been found to be falsified by the officer.)  This is overstepping.   Misapplication happens in courts all the time.  A lawyer says one thing, the other side does not object because it is an outright lie and the lawyer gets away with it, though it is an outright lie.  Bar Associations forbid the "defamation" of a fellow lawyer in their ethics guidelines.  The lawyer who didn't object faces disbarment if he says the other guy lied.  It is up to the individual wronged to do something about it.  This leads to churning of legal fees with appeals and the such.  It can be viewed as "self employment insurance" for lawyers and judges.|`|95ad502b68bac9621967011bb0d65bf4aa	money is law :) no money, no law, no help :)|`|5tpV7Jdcaa	The law is only as good as the corupt judges and oil tycoons let it be.

bTguVXMjaa	No, Dick is invested in Halliburton, a large government contractor, so he wants us to keep spending money on defense. But his argument amounts to fear-mongering, and his advice is not the solution. Belligerent actions against people and nations that disagree with us just fosters resentment and long-term problems. In 1951, we fought a war with North Korea, and they're still hostile toward us. In 1954, we toppled the religious leader of Iran, and they're still angry about it. People remember such things. Besides, our friends and allies lose faith in us when we act so aggressively overseas, so we get a bad image to match the foreign relations debacles we've created.|`|tvNkizDraa	Considering Cheney's involvement in the administration that formulated those ILLEGAL policies and practices, I consider his opinion as nothing more than a CYA move. I'm inclined to find more credibility in Supreme Court rulings, the UN's position and the new EOs, implemented by a president with a Constitutional Law background.  http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing_room/...  --  UN body wants Bush tried for torture   http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/10057...   --  U.N. special rapporteur on torture calls on U.S. to prosecute Bush and Rumsfeld.  http://thinkprogress.org/2009/01/21/un-b...    Cheney:  "Protecting the countrys security is a tough, mean, dirty, nasty business, he said. These are evil people. And were not going to win this fight by turning the other cheek.  I do not see following the rule of law as being the same as 'turning the other cheek'.  About those that were released... if we had followed the rule of law, the guilty ones could have been charged and convicted in cases that could stand up in court.  The innocent ones could have been released sooner, rather than hardening them to the terrorist cause.    Bottom line... Cheney is covering his ****, plain and simple.

wVkJ5jTfaa	You can get a good education from either of those two branches.   I chose the Navy.   There are more choices and opportunities in different fields.   The Air Force is more limited in their mission and this reduces the number of skills.     I've done fairly well, and my single enlistment in the Navy is the backbone of my results.   I did have to learn to suck it up and start doing those things that need doing and quit goofing off.|`|m5J36D28aa	Time off in the Air Force allows you to go off base anytime you're not at work.  In the Navy, you can only walk around the ship.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Any particular reason you have not included the Army in your choices?    Army is the biggest force, has the most occupations, best college incentives, and is the most important force in the war on terror.|`|KncPJwIaaa	Air Force believe they have the career choices and they do less|`|17MrmD4Eaa	air force! elite troops of the nation|`|9p2wQ21Aaa	Better don't be a part of AGGRESSION.|`|AA11757826	Before you start deciding which branch. Think about wheather your ethics agree with the military before you resort to it for economic or lifestyle reasons. I hear to many stories - particularly from the USA - about people who join up trying to get out of poverty of get their life on track and it ends up doing them far more harm than good.     I'm from Australia and have relatively well off parents. I got a degree funded mainly by the government and partly by an interest-free loan which i only have to pay back when i'm earning a high income, living with my parents who paid all my bills untill i went out and got a job where i used my skills. I'm a bit unstable and lacking direction but my 90% government-funded psycological care is fixing that well. So i can't really offer you much in the way of better ideas i guess. Um... claim political asylum in Australia? How and why do you guys have an illegal immegrant problem?    But more seriously, joining the military is a big decision which you shouldn't make too flipantly. Try to talk to someone who has had real experience in combat to decide whether it is what you really want to do.|`|tdUcDHQ2aa	Navy|`|x2THxqDKaa	air force    its a nice life and you dont have to "hot bunk"|`|0oanact4aa	because  defence is a good job to protect my motherhood like my life.im proud to join air force or navy|`|8r6iw9GCaa	I knew an Army Ranger that had been in the service for 30 years. He was pretty familiar with all the branches, and felt very strongly that the Air Force was the best option. His daughter wanted to join either the Navy or the Army. He spent years convincing her that the Air Force was the one to join. His reasons were ease of advancement/opportunities, the options one has when/if they leave the service, the toll it takes on a person, and pay. I don't know about this from PERSONAL experience, but I know that he was adamant about the Air Force being the best branch to join. I've advised my niece of the same thing. I hope this helps you, and good luck!|`|ki0bqnLpaa	i can't tell you either but remember this...Air Force is 6 weeks of training (last time i checked anyways) and most ppl i know have not been deployed if they get deployed they are gone for a short amount of time...and navy well just remember the marine corps is a department of the navy...that should explain something to ya there...i don't have any experience in either of the branches seeing as im Army National Guard...about to go Full Active.. you can ask my cousin adam about the navy tho hes on Yahoo messenger theoriginalmarinecowboy is the s/n|`|Y0zwVG1Xaa	Ok if you are looking for an education both are good choices. In the Navy they have professors who come aboard while you are under way on an Air Craft Carrier or what not. The Air Force usually has a few colleges that operate on base like Embry Riddle Aeronautical university. Both the Air Force and the Navy have an easy basic training though I will say the Navies is probably a little bit more physical...you have to do a lot of swimming I hear. Where most people drop out is in the technical school portion. Most jobs in the Air Force (I was in this branch for 8 years) will have you do about 9 months of tech school. In those nine months you earn the equivalent of a two year degree from a college. You just need to complete an English math and speech class.   I will tell you to be careful what job you pick. You will want something that relates to what you want to do when you get out of the service. For example if you like photography then you would want to go into multimedia / Public Affairs. Don't let the people at MEPPS (this is the place you go to for the initial physicals and ASVAB test) force you into something. They don't have any say over you until you raise your right hand and repeat after me...   Either job will get you traveling. Stay away from the jobs that deal with space. They are great jobs for after the military but they are considered deployed for contingency all the time. This means you are stuck state side for your entire career like I was.   In the Navy you will spend most of your time on a boat (Some Navy vet is screaming "they are not boats!!" right now lol). They give you whats called shore leave and with this you will get to visit alot of really cool places, but not for very long. In the Air Force you will probably be visiting the big desert over in Iraq.    Good luck and I hope this helps you out a little anyway. Hang in there through the tough stuff. It's designed to make you want to quite. Life gets much better once you get to your permanent duty station.|`|OKc1bkqGaa	Sorry dear, but let me tell you one thing.. "BEGGARS ARE NEVER THE CHOOSERS"  Dont take it other way, from your explanation, it seems , you have negative thoughts, home sickness, dont want to struggle.. etc.If you want to join any of them, you have to b positive n qualify your CDS, which you can qualify easily. But after that, you will have a main obstacle of Service Selection Board, where , i think you will b a total failure...  But, you can overcome all these things with positive attitude n proper  guidance...  And the choice between AIR FORCE n NAVY...  Keeeep it in mind.. AIR FORCE is the first choice of people with high I. Q. NOW CHOICE IS YOURS....  Wishing you all the very best....

YDlfu6AUaa	We need a Revolution because America belong to US we the People of the United States of America and not to the Communists/Liberals or Rich Elites who are trying to destroy us.  But America is so divided to the point that 'hate speech' or 'hate crime' could be construed as saying or doing anything and everyone is so close to being 'offended' that it's become difficult to determine what is Ok to say and what isn't Ok to say.  For example, if you say "I don't like Obama" allot of people will insult you by calling you a racist because Obama is black.  They will not understand that you don't have to like someone just because their black and there is a such thing as liking or disliking someone based on their character alone without bringing race into it.  Our media along with society in general have conditioned people to think like sheep instead of thinking for themselves and that's why our Government has gotten away with the atrocities it's committed against us and the rest of the world for as long as it has.  Political Correctness is mind control and in order to begin to take back our Government we have to first wake people up and unite ourselves once again or we will lose and the crooks in the government will win.

If you DO compare America with other countries, you will see America as a mess. Why do we think America is "cool" and a "great" country? It is because of the movies, games and videos they make ect.... Think about this, In movies, why is it always the Americans that win? Why is it that America always triumphs above all countries in movies? They do this to make their country seem like a "good" country. If you went there right now, at this moment, land in New York, you would possibly find 5+ gangs walking around on the street, a few homeless people and the rich and famous in a top class area and probably 20 cops in a high speed pursuit chasing one car. Also, you would probably see 50 S.W.A.T members raiding a house that has no one in it (Pure Stupidity)!     No, America is not worth trying to save, and defiantly not the place to live. Barack Obama has made history, but I personally think that nothing will change.
d60812b54bd94ed9b890bbc6003e6400aa	It is the prosecutor who must establish a "prima facie" case.  In other words, that the matter appears to be self-evident from the facts.    The basic elements of all moving violations are: identify the vehicle, identify the driver, establish that the alleged violation took place on a public highway, and establish that the alleged violation occurred within the jurisdiction of the issuing officer and the court.    If an offense requires intentional conduct on the part of the defendant, the statute will describe the prohibited behavior as willful, knowing, or malicious."  (You can look up the statue in your jurisdiction.)    In that case, you may argue that as person driving a four-wheel drive vehicle on a wet surface, the prosecutor has no way of knowing you intentionally committed the offense, and, in fact, you did not, and ask that the case be dismissed.    Good luck.|`|2lFRYr8Eaa	You don't need a lawyer.  Would not get one.  Let me show you something.

The cop will go first, you will be able the cop, you get to talk then.  You will likely lose.

But watching what he actually is doing, it seems he is being quite cautious about being too free handed regarding the war on terror. Case in point, Obama says he is closing Guantanamo Bay within the year. At face value, that says we are going to open the cages and let these delightful little terrorists run home to mama and let rust and decay consume our shameful base of prisoner interrogation. Obama is still retaining IN FACT "renditions", something the Bush administration came up with to corral prisoners of war and deal with them as we need to. So in effect, things have not changed much at all, for publicity, it has, he has presented a liberal type gesture with very little change at all. As many folks in the know have called it on the war on terror, it is not a matter of IF we have another attack on the U.S., it is WHEN, so Uncle Dick does have a point.|`|ujIinLzGaa	Because Obama is changing the things that the Bush Administration set up that have kept this country free of terrorist attacks since 9-11-2001.

Go to youtube and watch the Katie Couric interview with Barack that was taped just days ago.

I do not see following the rule of law as being the same as 'turning the other cheek'.  About those that were released... if we had followed the rule of law, the guilty ones could have been charged and convicted in cases that could stand up in court.

ylj2PTFFaa	It all depends.  There is a wieght chart that says how much you need to weigh in accordance with your height on the USMC website.  But if you are real fit and have a large muscle mass which puts you over your weight limit, there is a body fat test they will give you which will technically be a waiver so you dont have to lose the muscle weight.    However, if you are just out of shape and over weight, they put you on a diet at bootcamp.  They give you a diet tray which limits your rations.  On the contrary, if you are underweight, they will put you on double rations.    Regardless, if you are worried about weight, expect to loose a ton in camp.  Esp if your a meathead, cuz you dont lift weight for 3+ months.|`|jHUAfrojaa	He will have to lose the given weight that the person above me said.

You may be out in the sea for moths sometimes as long as 10 months. Another aspect is that it is a private job. And if you do not have a good company they might not be very responsible in case of a mishap.     Indian Navy on the other side is govt. You become a part of the Indian armed forces.

ac3561c0ed6428f357981b995404a2b1aa	Right away you have abolished freedom of religion, which conflicts with your definition at the start.    My definition of a free society is that everyone is free to do anything as longs as it does not interfere with the freedom of others to do the same. Freedom is the government staying out of business and buseiness staying out of government - and the same applying to all other other private matters.    There is no reason to abolish money. Money is nothing more than a convenient way to exchange various goods in trade. If you work for someone, how do you get paid? Money does not make people unethical. Money is useless to most people on it's own. Paper money is intrinsically good for only one thing. People desire the things money can get them, not the money itself. Abolish money and people will still want those things and try to get them some other way.    Profit is not unethical. The profit motive is what gives people the incentive to start productive enterprises. If there were no incentive, nothing would be produced except on a very limitted scale and far fewer people would benefit. For example, peole who invent and make computer hardware and softwae would do it only for themselves. You would have to grow your onw food. Anyone who goes to the trouble of setting up some form of production for others to benefit from deserves something over and above their living needs as a reward. The money so gained (profit) can then be used to set up more productive enterprises, either by that same person or loaned to some  other person for that purpose (i.e. used as capital).    Where is the incentive for people to work together for the common good the way you wish them to? This is just Communism, which has failed in every attempt. Nobody will work without some incentive unless theya re forced to, either by government or by group pressure. That is not freedom, that is force.    Everybody would not be able to agree on how to work together, so would have to resort to democratic decisions-making which would lead to government control and the imposition of the wishes sof the majority on the minority in all decisions, which would take away their freedoms. It is better for all people to use their own private prosperty independently. then there are fewer arguments. Liberty and private property are inseperable,since if you don't have privae property, you have nothing to exercise your freedoms with. Private property includes your own body and thoughts.    It is not national boundaries which cause wars, it is the political ambitions of government officials, encouraged by financial interests. With a small government, there is less likelihood of war, since the politicians are easily restrained by citizens from declaring them. If people of all countries have a good standard of living there is no incentive for the people of those countries to go to war. they are not going to put their lives on the line just to grab more territory or reources than they need. If all countries also maintain a good military, there is an effective deterrant against all other countries from attacking them.    We would still need laws, since there has to be a way of stopping people from interfereing with the freedoms of others (which is what we would class murder and theft as). But in a free society there is a smaller government (in terms of amont of control it has) and therefore fewer laws So the lawyers would not have as much opportunity to make money as they do now.    The medical profession can operate on profit and still obey it's oath. It just couldn't make profit from unethical practices. Before the government health system took over, many wealthy doctors did free services for the poor through church clinics. They could afford to. they did it because they were Christians, or at least society in general was. What you shoud be opposing is the government helping the medical industry to make profits despite the genuine needs and wishes of the people. In a free market, people choose their health care..    http://etherzone.com/2007/stang082407.sh...    Religion has not been responsible for conflict and oppression. It has been used as a pretext for committing those acts by people who would want to do them whether they are religious or not. They would be less likely to want to do them if they were genuinely religous. Everybody has some set of beliefs which they hold to whether they are religious or not. A religion is nothing more than a view of the world and the correct values for living in it. Many people who oppose religion effectively are religious themselves - they unconsciously subscribe to a basic philosophy.    Read this link to see what I mean. Do you agree withit? If so, you are religious, since it claims to be a religion itself, and at the same time opposes traditional religion.    http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/ma...|`|yAsLhdp2aa	living a life without government interference..the basic libertarian motto..do what you want to do when you want..as long as it doesnt hurt anybody else.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	A world without guns and god.|`|GtO2FMnTaa	Dom you don't have to pay for.|`|mmFz64MFaa	to be able to build a cabin were ever the f I want hunt were I want and club a women over the head drag her to my cave and ahhh forget it|`|64SObnr5aa	I know I am going to get thumbs down for this, but I believe that financial freedom is the best definition for me.     Why?    Without financial freedom, all the political freedom in the world means squat.  If one is continually worried about being able to pay taxes, to being in debt up to their ears in order to live the American dream, isn't that a form of self imposed slavery?     To me, 20 years of not owing a dime to anyone has been the biggest single reason I feel more free.  Sure I can stand on a soap box and scream my bloody head off, but that does not put food on the table or allow me freedom to move about.  Being in debt can have serious consequences that many of us do not think about.    HOWEVER,    The biggest threat to freedom, to me, is our over burdening tax system.    That is one issue one can not escape, even by living 100% within their means.    But one can limit that if they chose not to live the American dream and putting up with property taxes, which is really another form of rent, because if you don't pay it can all be taken away.

I recommend that you look for it and watch it. There is no proof for the Alien cover-ups either - just a lot of speculation and supiciion. It is even possible that the governments have created or at least encouraged this theory themselves for some political or social aim.    The reason the government perpetrated 9/11 is that it gave them an excuse to invade Iraq and also to impose "anti-terrorist" legislation whichthey can use to monitor and restrict all US people, under the pretext of looking for suspected terrorists.    This is the same thing that Hitler did to impose his own dictatorship. He arranged the German parliament building, the Recihstag, to be burnt down and then blamed it on his opponents the Communists (who also wanted to impose a dicatorship on Germany). He imposed "emergency powers" which effectively gave him his dictatorial power.    In Shakespear's "Hamlet", the king says to his son (heir) "Make it thy business to busy giddy minds with foreign quarells", which means that if a countryis at war, it is easier for the government to manipulate the peole of that country and the war gives the government an excuse for more control of industry and policiing of the people for the sake of security.    The invasion of Iraq has ether benefits and aims of it's own for the US government. It is a way of arranging political control of Iraq - it gives the US a say in who governs Iraq and an opportunity to arrange their choice, since the US military is helping fight insurgents.    The basic interest governments have in wars is that it gives the victors the opportunity to politically rearrange the territories they fought over. The aim of elites today is to build a world government, and all of the wars that are happenning have been started and run toward that end.

H4MILKhcaa	The only Agencies I have heard of that carry select-fire weapons were contracted security agencies to nuclear power plants and some Govt. facilities. But this was years ago and that may have changed. These were weapons that were carried "on-duty" only and turned in at the end of a shift.     Any citizen can purchase a select-fire weapon. But they need to apply for a Class III license, submit to an FBI background check and have a letter of approval from the Sheriff of the County where the person lives. The person must also pay a tax on the weapon, it can only be a weapon that was manufactured before 1986 and submit to unannounced inspections to the premises where the weapon is stored. Even if it is a residence.|`|Vu7kCPesaa	Several states allow the possession of automatic weapons, it just takes a ton and a half of paperwork.

As a police officer, I may get discount on firearms from gun dealers and manufacturers, but I don't have a license to purchase anything a normal citizen could not.    However, automatic weapons are not impossible to get. If you have the cash and the willingness to fill out government paperwork, you can certainly purchase an automatic weapon. Carrying them is a different matter, at least in my state (Missouri), security officers are limited in their firearm choices.|`|d7667642d6476c7c373029d6c1a8327baa	Some states, like NJ, do not allow private ownership of assault weapons or machine guns (NJ's assault weapons law contains different definitions than the federal assault weapons ban of 1994).  NJ only makes an exception for police agencies to purchase and possess such firearms, and the attorney general, under advice from the superintendant of the state police, sets the training standard required for training and qualification.      Merely being a security guard, or owning a security company, does not grant you a right to own any class of weapon banned from private ownership by the state.  Security companies that are contracted by the federal government are sometimes granted permission to possess such firearms in the course of their contracted duties.  They are acting under authority from the federal government when the do this.  If they lose their contract, they do not automatically keep the right to own the guns; it then depends on the laws of the state where the guns are.|`|2ULgTxtxaa	kenneth c is an impostor he not the real kenneth he's my negative.|`|e2bb5ba263e7ef55a1ceccb9a2d3bb96aa	Lots of misinformation in the answers above.  First of all, I guess we're all assuming that you are talking about a fully automatic weapon, not semi-automatic, which are often simply termed, "automatics."  Secondly, no security guard service, except maybe some high-end agencies that contract for high-profile personal protection services and who hire former special forces operators or former Secret Service agents who are trained in personal protection, is going to allow you to carry a fully-automatic weapon while in their employ.    With that said, however, any law-abiding, non-nut-case citizen living in a state with laws allowing the possession of fully-automatic weapons, (for example, New York State does not allow common citizens to possess full-auto weapons) can purchase a fully-automatic weapon if they have the money to pay for the gun (they can be expensive), and to pay the one-time $200 transfer tax on each weapon (which I think is now a bargain).  Take it from someone who has done it twice, it's not a ton of paperwork, and there is no FBI background check.  It's basically a very simple form.  You have to submit your fingerprints, a photograph, and have the form signed off by a chief law enforcement officer having jurisdiction over the area where you reside.  Once it's mailed to ATF, there is a records check process that they do, but it's more of a review.  They will approve it, put a tax stamp on it, and mail it back to you.  The Class III (pronounced "class three") dealer from whom your are purchasing the gun can then give it to you.    If anyone out there reading this is interested in buying their own machinegun, it's your right to do so!  Don't let anyone intimidate you into saying it's not okay.  The best avenue to take is to start by finding a Class III Federal Firearms License (FFL) holder in your area.  Look in the yellow pages.  Most Class III dealers put ads in that advertise the fact they sell NFA weapons.  If you can't find one, call a long-established regular FFL holder and ask who is a Class III dealer in your area.  Most of them know who is and is not in their areas.  Call or pay a visit to the Class III dealer, and tell him or her you are interested in buying your own full-auto weapon, but that you don't know anything or very little about them and would like to learn.  Many areas of our country have groups or clubs of National Firearms Act (NFA) weapons enthusiasts who love to shoot their guns and who love to show them off.  They frequently have weekend shoots, and I bet most of them would love to have you come out and shoot one of their guns.  You get to know these people; get them to explain how they got started; make friends with them; and chances are, once they are comfortable with you and conclude that you are like them and simply have a love of guns, and that you aren't a nut or a criminal, one or more will probably be willing to vouch for you with the chief law enforcement officer in your area who you will need to sign off on your transfer tax form.    People, embrace the Second Amendment, and exercise your right to own firearms, including your right to own NFA weapons.  The more law abiding citizens who exercise their Second Amendment rights, the more protected that right becomes.    Good luck!  Machineguns are FUN!!!    Also, there's lots of good information on NFA weapons at the website below.
O1Sqcc5yaa	No, you cannot.  Grandfather clauses to bans on automatic weapons are for those who own them already (prior to the ban).  Also, the assault weapon ban in the US expired a few years ago, meaning you can buy an assault rifle (depending on your state), just not an automatic one.|`|Vu7kCPesaa	Yes, you need a Title II Tax Stamp from the BATFE.

But it is not because of being undocumented or being Mexican. There are at least as many good people as bad people among the poor.

HJaVcUGwaa	Hamas is a Palestinian resistance movement started in 1987 to liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation.  Historical Palestine is the land that includes Israel today, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.  Israel was established over Palestinian lands in 1948.  Israel illegally occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967 and has been defying several UN resolutions to withdraw from these lands.

It's no wonder so many Muslims hate us.|`|uX5hO3d8aa	Palestine isn't an actual country, it's a geographical region located around Israel.    And here's an extremely long history lesson made short:    In the old testament of the Bible, it specifically says the land in the area of Palestine around Jerusalem belongs to the Jews. That being said, during and after World War 2 many Jews felt a need to have a land of their own. They were being persecuted in Europe by the Nazi's and in Russia by the communists, so they looked to the Bible which told them to go to Palestine.    The problem is, the area of Palestine was inhabited by what today are referred to as Palestinians. The Jewish people migrated to the land and with the backing of post World War 2 Europe and the U.S. took over the region and formed Israel.     In taking over Israel, many of the people who were living there before the Jews (the Palestinians) were forced out. Many fled to Egypt and Jordan and other areas around the Middle East, but still many set up seemingly temporary camps around the region thinking that they would one day get their land back. This happened over 50 years ago and these camps, generations later, are still inhabited by displaced Palestinians who feel the Jews should give back what had belonged to their ancestors.    And this is where the conflict lies:     The Palestinians want the Jews to leave and give them back their land. The Jews say the land was granted to them in the Bible (which it was) and that Jewish people had lived there originally before Muslims forced them to leave. The Palestinian extremist group Hamas took over the Gaza Strip and set up their own government there, overthrowing the previous Palestinian Government which still rules the West Bank (another area of Palestinian camps). Hamas not only wants the land returned to the Palestinians, they want every Jew killed.    Hamas encourages the Palestinian people to constantly torment the Jews who are much stronger and technologically advantaged. Hamas fights guerrilla style campaigns against Israel, shooting random missiles at the Israel countryside, hoping to instill fear in the Israeli population. Hamas then hides among Palestinian civilians so that the Israelis don't know who to attack. When Israel does finally attack Hamas, you find that innocent civilians are also killed because of the inability of Israel to target the hidden Hamas fighters.    Hope that helps!|`|QDFj9JPfaa	..."Palestine" is the imaginary land that was stolen from the 12 Tribes of the Hebrew Nations by the "moon-god",  desert wanders of the "rants" of an ignorant pedophile that God (YHVH) gave to Abraham thru his son Issac...

Each group of ten prisoners would be chained together and trucked to a different part of the county.  With two CO's supervising the prisoners would spend 10 hours per day cleaning up the roadside or working the jail farm.    Once the work day was done, then it's time for mandatory instruction!  Four or five hours of instruction in subject matter designed to have them performing at the level of a high school grad by the time they leave my jail.    The rest of the time would be covered in 1 hour of personal time per day (cleaning themselves and their cell, etc) and sleeping.    Cells would be pretty bare ... no posters, radios, tvs or pleasure reading materials.  One cot per prisoner ... one chair per prisoner ... and of course "the facilities"!  They would not have need for more, they would only use their cells for sleeping!|`|VMTVnUylaa	depends on the crime, murders, baby killers, rapists etc, they should be locked down for the longest time, drug offenders should be just set free.|`|ZoAEoHl9aa	locked down in a cell with no tv a/c and little stuff to do like just sit there and thing what do i care if a people in prison or up to date with currert events|`|AA10307482	They should make License Plates,   Manufacture Flags, Make Handmade  Rugs, Build Furniture.

A local Sheriff had the brilliant idea of offering to local towns the prisoners' services cleaning their roads. He is also charging them $5 dollars per day. Like me, he believes American prisons are more within a hotel style, compared to those overseas. Aren't the prisoners paying their debt to society? Why should the rest of us have to support them? Learning a trade is also offered, making them useful beings after completion of their prison terms.  My brother worked for this Sheriff. Initially prisoners being release, they would tell him: "Bob, I will be back in a couple of months!". Once this Sheriff took office, the prisoner leaving would tell my brother: "This place is getting to tough. I will never be back!".
jEC8Ctp5aa	Yes, you can sue. What they did to you is called "slander", and it's usually a serious crime.    Seeing as how this is a school paper, your point is likely moot.    Also keep in mind that most writers are usually working under the tutelage of an editor, so rarely does a writer get sued all by themself.    The best thing you can hope for is to file a complaint against them and demand a full retraction.    Best of luck !|`|0JL3Mg78aa	I seriously doubt that you can sue over this.  I would make a case to the principal or the regional superintendent and see what recourse you have.  How could you get the proof?  And you would have to prove in court that he intentionally wanted to cause you some type of harm.  Very difficult, sorry.|`|qxwgoMETaa	technically yes you can sue as a personal violation and since suing in america is really easy.     But I'm wondering what the public paper said that made you want to sue them. I mean sometimes, especially in newspapers and such, they use random names and it could be that your name happen to match, with no ill-intensions.     If this is a school newspaper, let it go.   If it's some city newspaper, I would say let it go b/c it doesn't really matter.    If you feel as though you should confront it, I would just have an appointment with that press and ask for legit reason before you sue them. It's only right you get their side of the story.

In retrospect I'll bet you realize you shouldn't have counted on a ride from your opponent in court.    Anyway, she's not just playing hardball, she's playing under-handed.  In those cases, I strongly recommend you retain an attorney.  (If you're low-income, contact the Bar Association in your county, explain your situation, and ask for a few referrals.)    There's no time limit.  You can file to amend your agreement at any time, but the longer you wait, the less favorably you'll be seen by the court.

For those in the military, they are an even greater concern. Recent news articles have reported a dramatic upsurge in the number of military weddings. With continuing deployments and the future uncertain, it's no wonder so many couples are tying the knot. There's great comfort in knowing that someone you love is waiting for you -- and can benefit at home from your service to the government. To assist individuals planning a military wedding and honeymoon, About's Honeymoons/Romantic Getaways Guide Susan Breslow Sardone and I have prepared this Q&A.     Q: What do you need to know about marrying if you're in the military?     A: If you are in the States (not assigned overseas), getting married as a member of the military is much the same as civilian marriages. You don't need advanced permission and there is no special military paperwork to fill out before the marriage. You simply get married according the laws of the state where the marriage is taking place after obtaining a marriage license off-base.     If you are overseas and marrying a foreign national, it's a different story. There are tons of forms to complete; you must obtain counseling and your commander's permission (which is rarely withheld without very good reason); your spouse must undergo a security background check and pass a medical examination. Finally, the marriage has to be "recognized" by the United States Embassy. The entire process can take several months.     Regardless of where or who, once married, if the spouse is non-military, the military member can bring a copy of the certified marriage certificate to the Personnel Headquarters on the base to receive a dependent ID card for the spouse, and enroll the spouse in DEERS (Defense Eligibility Enrollment   Reporting System), to qualify for military benefits such as medical coverage and commissary and base exchange privileges.     Timing can be important in a military marriage. If you have PCS (Permanent Change of Station) orders, and get married before you actually make the move, you can have your spouse added to your orders and the military will pay for the relocation of your spouse and her property (furniture and such). However, if you report to your new duty assignment first, and then get married, you will have to pay for the relocation of your spouse out of your own pocket.     Actually "making the move" means reporting into your new base. So, you can leave your old base, take leave (vacation), get married, report into your new base, get your orders amended to include your new spouse, and the military will pay for the spouse's move. However, if you report to your new base, and then take leave to get married, you're on your own, when it comes to moving expenses for the spouse.     Q: Can you get married on base? If so, who should you contact?     A: Yes. The point of contact is the chaplain's office. Each military base has one (or more) chapels that are used for religious services. One can get married in a base chapel, just as one can get married in a church off-base. Base chaplains offer a complete variety of marriage choices, including religious (almost any denomination), non-religious, casual, civilian-formal, and military-formal.|`|fArUNIfRaa	aren't you afraid of him getting killed?  my girlfriend who I asked to marry me wants to join.  and I'm sad........cause nothing ever went right in my life.

082vOBNKaa	Here is the regulation word for word about rounding from AR 600-9 The Army Weight Control Program Appendiz B-2:    b. The weight will be measured with the Soldier in a standard PT uniform (gym shorts and T-shirt). Shoes will not be worn. The measurement will be made on scales available in units and recorded to the nearest pound with the following guidelines:  (1) If the weight fraction of the Soldier is less than 1?2 pound, round down to the nearest pound.  (2) If the weight fraction of the Soldier is 1?2 pound or greater, round up to the next whole pound.    if you are overweight and must be taped (as a male) here is the guidance from the same reg:  B3. Description of circumference sites and their anatomical landmarks and technique  a. All circumference measurements will be taken three times and recorded to the nearest 1?2-inch (or 0.50). Each sequential measurement will be within 1?2 inch of the next or previous measurement. If the measurements are within 1?2 inch of each other, derive a mathematical average to the nearest 1?2 of an inch. If the measurements differ by 1?2 inch or  more continue measurements until you obtain three measures within 1?2 inch of each other. Then average the three closest measures.  b. Each set of measurements will be completed sequentially to discourage assumption of repeated measurement readings. For males, complete 1 set of abdomen and neck measurements, NOT three abdomen circumferences followed by three neck circumferences. Continue the process by measuring the abdomen and neck in series until you have three  sets of measurements.     Being 66.5 inches tall exactly it would be rounded up to 67 you should shoot to weigh 165 (17-20) 169 (21-27) 174 (28-39) 176 (40+). If you cannot meet that standard you must be within the 20% BMI (17-20) 22% (21-27)  24% (28-39) 26% (40+)|`|2ULgTxtxaa	is that with or without shoes i'm 65 with out shoes which is only 5.5 not tall but i have to weigh 155 to 165lbs. run 2 miles in 16 minutes do 15 push ups 35 situps in 2 minutes.
AA11494150	There is a pretty good chance you will be doing field sobriety. Even though you have a medical card, you can not drive while under the influence of marijuana.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	Well, If the cop gives you any trouble..take the card to the judge.|`|8IfePMa3aa	From my impression in WA: as long as you're not high and driving it's okay. About a year ago my friend got pulled over for speeding (in my car) - I had smoked in the car not too long before we had left. The officer said he smelled marijuana, so I explained I had smoked while my friend was inside a residence and that's why he was driving, showed him my permit, told him how much I had on me (about 1.5 oz), and gave him permission to search the car/my persons. After inspecting my card for all of 15 seconds he handed it back to me and all he said before dropping the subject was "as long as you're not driving....".|`|AA10163820	How much do you smoke?    How far are you traveling with your one ounce?    In the absence of some compelling reason for you to have an ounce in your car given the distance you are traveling, it's certainly possible your weed will be seized.  In other words, If you smoke a couple of grams a day for your condition, and you're driving from your house to your friend's house for dinner, there's probably no reason for you to have an ounce in your car because you don't use that much in an entire day.    This is also going to depend largely on the state you live in - and I'll just assume you're in a state that even allows for medical marijuana.|`|7418eb5f657591281303277a7ab819dbaa	Why would you even mention it? I don't think anybody would suspect you had weed unless you freaked out or something.|`|hI2OhdpRaa	As a medical patient and activist in CO, I have had numerous encounters and heard many stories of people in such scenarios.  The officer can do pretty much as he pleases; let it go, field sobriety test, haul you in to jail.  The judge however, will have to sort out the legality of your situation.  In most states with medical marijuana, its assumed that the patient must obtain the medicine, and any decent attorney could argue what I believe is called something along the lines of "reading the 4 corners of the law".  Most police hate medical marijuana and will likely do a sobriety test.  Since THC can stay in your system as long as 30 days, they can easily get you with a DUI.  In Michigan, it was ruled that any driver with THC in their system, regardless of whether they even have pot/papers/pipe/etc, automatically is DUI.    As a patient you have the right to have it in your state.  If you are traveling with your medicine, dont bring a pipe or anything that could be used for smoking.  If a cop wants to say you were using in the car, the burden of proof is on him.  That is rather difficult if you dont have any paraphanelia.  Also, if you really haven't smoked, demand a blood test, not a urine test.  Furthermore, demand a complete metabolite profile.  THC breaks down into about 15 different chemicals as it is being metabolized from fat cells to being excreted in the urine.  Chris Conrad in California, PHD Robert Melamede, or myself in about 6 months when I get my molecular biology degree, can testify as expert witnesses and use peer-reviewed research to identify a timeline as to when the person last smoked.

C92BXPV7aa	I would begin your speech with talking about how bad torture is and how you are against it.  Then slowly become more and more for it.  Like the speech Brutus gave about ceaser after his death.  The audience will be less hostile and will not tune you out.  I would start with a history of torture/interrogation and end with how torture/interrogation has prevented the loss of life, etc.  If you come out and say "I am for torture", people will automatically be against you and you will not get through to them.  If you trick them into giving you "their ear" it will be easier to pursuade them.  P.S.  Dont use the word torture.  Use some softer word.|`|2XgLQmhwaa	Nothing justifies torture of another human being. Don't care what Bush, Cheney & Rumsfeld think.|`|ZgIZrKi7aa	Look at the show 24...

Luke 9.25,55-56,60  What do you think?|`|dCewrtXaaa	Anna is a clever girl. You should come out against torture, but then redefine it as Bush and Cheney have with twisted Orwellian newspeak and doublethink (in "1984" the "Ministry of Peace" actually deals with war and the "Ministry of Love" actually tortures people). Bushco says America never tortures, it only uses "enhanced Interrogation techniques" as "tools to extract accurate information." Of course this is complete poppycock, but how else are you going to defend the indefensible? Google "Cheney definition torture" and see what comes up. You will find platitudes about keeping the world safe for democracy, etc. According to him and Rumsfeld, John McCain was never tortured in Vietnam. They claim real torture is much worse than what was done to him. And that wasn't torture at Abu Ghraib or Guantanamo either.     With enough diabolical language, you can try as they did to sneak dawn past a rooster.

He is comparing Ranger training which is advanced training to Marine Corps BASIC training. Army basic training is 9 weeks, USMC basic training consists of 13 weeks bootcamp at Parris Island and then 8+ weeks of training at the School of Infantry (21 weeks NOT 18) and THEN they got to their "A" school, after their MOS training is complete they can apply for Recon or Marsoc. then you add on recon or MARSOC training, jump school, and all the other training and it is much longer then 33 weeks. (I think Basic recon is 8+ weeks, jump school 5 weeks and there is a month where they weed people out before recon training even starts (I think they may have changed this), Any RECON please feel free to correct me) He is comparing a Marine just out of basic training to someone whose been to MOS and advanced school. If you compare basic training it is 21 weeks vs 9 and if you compare special forces to special forces then it is comparable but even then it is hard because you never quit going to schools, survival, cold weather, pathfinder. but a new MARSOC or RECON would still have been in longer and had more training (length wise) then a new Ranger.     Don't get me wrong Rangers are badass and I respect them totally, I just can't sit back and let someone either lie or be ignorant about something they obviously know nothing about.    And notice you don't see too many RECON or MARSOC Marines posting, maybe because they are all too busy either in country or in training. But you see a LOT of people claiming to be Rangers. There is one in particular who posts all the time, he started out by saying Army is better then Marines and better trained, well he was proven wrong, then he went Army infantry is better then Marines, well comparing apples to oranges but still easily proven not absolutely true so then he progressed to Rangers are better then Marines, which is an assinine comparison. Next I guess his arguement will be IF Superman was in the Army and went through Ranger school he might be better then some Marines. And it is that ranger guy, funny how a few weeks ago he was basic infantry, didn't know Ranger school was that short and you were allowed to use the computer.    Why argue, they are all serving their country and we may kid each other about who is best but I would fight beside either against an enemy of the United States and be proud to say I had. And although we may have a friendly rivalry, it doesn't mean we like outsiders or wannabes doing it, they haven't earned the right or know what they are talking about. And that isn't directed at the questioner, the way I see it he isn't bashing he is calling someone on their B.S.|`|8oDGnVhcaa	NOT the USMC soldiers....the Marines Force Recon. I remember watching JAG tv show that a 5 group of US army rangers they where harassing 4 marines force recon guys. Then later they end up fighting & the recon guys they didn't know to fight hand to hand. The rangers they fight pretty good & I think they use some martial arts.|`|dSbAz63baa	It's more truth than bashing : ) Marines are trained to be the first ones to go in to an all-out offensive, and Rangers are trained to sneak in, sneak out, and never be seen...:) Rangers are Special Ops. Special Forces have completely different entities and our training pipelines reflect that.    Do realize that in order to be a Ranger in the 75th Ranger Regiment, you have to first graduate Army Basic Combat training and AIT. You then have to graduate US Army 3 week Airborne School, earning your Paratrooper wings. Ranger Indoctrination Program (RIP). RIP is a 4 week long assessment. After that you need to graduate Ranger school itself. Ranger school being an intense 61 day long school. Tottal 33 weeks. This is far more training a US Marine will have. How long is Marine boot/soi 18 weeks.     An enlisted member of the 75th Ranger Regiment has gone through Basic Training, AIT, RIP, Airborne,? and eventually other training such as SERE-C, Jumpmaster, Air Assault, Pathfinder, and Ranger School. Not knocking the Marines...they are good at what they do but I highly doubt many Marines have those qualifications, if any.     Ranger school has a 90%+ weed-out rate. In a class of 100, fewer than 10 will graduate. Some will die during training (yes, die). You will average 6 hours of sleep per week during Ranger School. Truth is - NOT bashing -  If you consider Marine boot camp tough your not ready to become a U.S. Ranger or Special Forces.|`|P3e2kJtwaa	I agree with Troll Hunter.  When you're that bad a** and look sooo good and professional in uniform (and outta uniform), it's easy to make people jealous.|`|014NXPfFaa	My hubby is a Ranger and my father is a ret. Marine.  They have friendly back and forth bashings at almost every get together.    I don't think I've ever heard my husband 'bash' (seriously) any job in the military or branch of service.      Everyone in the military has a bit of friendly competition w/ everyone else.  A little rivalry makes boring things a bit more enjoyable.      BTW: Marines can (and do) go to Ranger school.  It's open to all branches of service and military of other countries.|`|b9UFfsdraa	you don't    You see a bunch of snot nosed teenage kids who want to join the Army trying to talk sh!t on yahoo answers about something that they know nothing about|`|ZB1vk86Maa	This whole site is full of wannabe Marines, Rangers and SEALs. You are a wannabe, Ranger is a wannabe. Basically you jack off to Marine commercials and Ranger to pictures of Rangers. Grow up kid if you knew anything about the Military you wouldn't compare a Special Operations Force to a Branch of the Military. There are 200,000 Marines and only 1500 shooters in the 75th Ranger Regiment. Luis Marines can't become Navy SEALs. If you are going say something on yahoo at least post a link with proof.
0982b83a0496946be27e0be6e067b757aa	I would 'phone environmental health and explain the situation. Warts are supposed to be non infectious but sometimes they bleed and if he's handling food without gloves then the blood would contaminate the food. I wouldn't bother complaining to management, if he is the son of a friend of the managers then it may be you they get rid of. I don't think you're horrible to think like this, I wouldn't want to be served with someone who 's hands are covered in warts either.|`|J6d6vNenaa	Do you think it is only people who have warts who are unclean? I have never eaten in a restaurant since I was a child, simply because I believe that all eating places are unclean. I do all my own cooking and cleaning, and that gives me no one to blame but myself.|`|d5ec0db90372775006f3c771bed01617aa	I think the main problem with this person is the fact that he is not following the basic rules concerning Hygiene. He should wear gloves when preparing food, should wash his hands more often and most of all he should not scratch himself and continue serving food!! Without mentioning the warts (that would be the last of the problems!..), talk to other people using the cafeteria and try to find out if they have noticed the same behaviour, and make a written complaint (may be you could ask other people to sign it too?).  Then it is up to the the Manager. If he won't do anything then it is clear that that person "must" work there because is the Chef's son.  In that case I can't see any other solution but to change cafeteria!!!|`|5b478a242969ee67691fa226064cfcd6aa	You don't know his situation. It could be some kind of condition which causes him to have these "warts" as you call them. There are so many conditions out there, we will never know all of them.    I do think you're cruel to talk about getting him fired when you don't know his situation. However, if he is scratching and not washing his hands before continuing working, I do think you should speak to a manager about it. Not necessarily to get him 'fired' just so that they can deal with this and let him know gently that what he does is a health and safety problem.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	Warts aren't unhealthy as they are a viral infection that exists within some people's immune systems ...this young man couldn't work in a kitchen without a food hygiene certificate, so I don't think you have a case. You could ask Environmental Health what they think...ask at your council offices.|`|0b04c7a0c2d6347def6134f6598d75d4aa	Firing him is not your decision I guess. All you can do is highlight the problem, and hope someone gets it sorted. Maybe by getting him to use more healthy practices.|`|5f0ad33d9668eff665c2e087d8f3dc2caa	Well anyone handling food should be wearing gloves, why don't you suggest that?

Health departments take health code violations very seriously and have been known to shut violators down.|`|speJXeIhaa	It's not a disability exactly though,and to be fair i would feel exactly the same.I can't work with food as i sometimes have eczema on my forearms and hands- very slight but enough to warrant the health and safety rule to kick in.He shouldn't be working with food - plain and simple.It's unhygienic and needs to be reported.Can't you speak to your department manager? or head of resources? there must be someone you can report it to.If he really has to work in the cafeteria then he should wear protective gloves and a hairnet.    Do something about it - i would!!    Good luck =)|`|C92BXPV7aa	Do you grow/raise your own food? If you think that is the worst thing going on, get real.  You have no idea what you are putting into your mouth everyday or where it came from.  That guy has a right to work and his appearance is not his fault.  Next time ask him to wear gloves because you noticed he didn't wash his hands well enough.  If that does not work, complain to the manager that he does not wash his hands, etc.  I think you are discriminating against him though.|`|NTK4XLuDaa	He definitely needs training in food hygiene but you can't seriously say he ha a disability because he has warts or that he shouldn't be serving food because of them ( it isn't unhealthy to serve food if you have warts!!!)  that's a little harsh i think. Put yourself in his shoes for just a few minutes and imagine how you would feel being judged (not just due to food ad hygiene considerations) because you have a skin condition.|`|c7ef985a9411af8ee0327cec84bcf14eaa	gentle hint   buy a few pair of marigold gloves and leave them where he works
AA11494150	The reason for the stop has nothing to do with searching the car, they are two separate issues.    The burden of proof required for a traffic stop is "reasonable suspicion". The burden of proof required to search a car is "probable cause". Therefore, he needs more than just a violation to search, unless you are arrested or consent.|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	My question to you is, why did you allow a search?    Window tint, I seriously doubt that such a thing is cause.    Did he ask you if he could search? Either way, you should make it clear that you are not giving consent.    If the cop does anyway, don't do anything, it's not worth going to jail over. But make a complaint. I know probably nothing will happen, but show the cop you are no dummy.    Cause has nothing to do with a ticket being given or not.    If he searched the vehicle, you gave consent, or he/she lied to you that they didn't need consent, which is it? Also, a cop doesn't need cause if you have some kind of probation or parole, in which case you lose some of these rights.|`|09e7abe08ce00bd3e0c4d7e7472c103daa	Did the officer ask for consent to search?  Did the officer smell weed?  The officer doesn't need to write you a ticket to be able to search.|`|AA10185707	Yes, he can say you were nervous and thats probable cause|`|KBRCOa6vaa	Did you give him consent to search the vehicle? If you did not give him consent then anything found can not be charged against you.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	Yes, I think the argument is that the person is basically in the police custody and they have the right to search and pull a background check on the person.    Similar case which is held by Supreme Court  http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2008/02...|`|b8kbeVx2aa	I hope this can help you .     The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution places limits on the power of the police to make arrests, search people and their property, and seize objects and contraband (such as illegal drugs or weapons). These limits are the bedrock of search and seizure law. This article covers the basic issues that you should know, beginning with an overview of the Fourth Amendment itself.    The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reads as follows:    "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."  The search and seizure provisions of the Fourth Amendment are all about privacy. To honor this freedom, the Fourth Amendment protects against "unreasonable" searches and seizures by state or federal law enforcement authorities.    The flip side is that the Fourth Amendment does permit searches and seizures that are considered reasonable. In practice, this means that the police may override your privacy concerns and conduct a search of your home, barn, car, boat, office, personal or business documents, bank account records, trash barrel, or whatever, if:    the police have probable cause to believe they can find evidence that you committed a crime, and a judge issues a search warrant, or   the particular circumstances justify the search without a warrant first being issued.|`|ac1fPtpqaa	An officer has absolutely no right to search your vehicle unless he or she has probable cause to search it. Such as seeing beer cans, smelling weed etc. If you got pulled over for having tinted windows that is your charge. Are they attempting to search your car for more tinted windows that they have not yet seen. Sad to say but many cops do not know your rights just as most citizens don't know their rights. It states in the constitution that in order to seize or search it must need probable cause in order to do so. And yes if you are innocent you should not let them search your car, if they lock you up so be it. Take them to court sue them for unlawful actions. Don't let the fear of getting arrested for an unjust cause stand in the line of liberty & justice!
5UW2P8IMaa	The issue of a common law marriage in Pennsylvania is a rather complex one. They were abolished in 2003 in the court case of PNC Bank Corporation v. Workers Compensation Appeal Board (Stamos), 831 A 2d 1269.   The Pennsylvania legislature enacted a statute in 2005 actually abolishing common law marriage in Pennsylvania contracted after the effective date of the statute. 23 Pa.C.S. Section 1103.    Under prior law, just living together was not enough to establish a common law marriage.  There had to be a "holding out to the community" that they were living as husband and wife, not as a person living with his girl friend.  The fact that in todays world many couples choose to cohabit without any intention of being presently married only adds to the potential difficulties generated by a common lack of public understanding as to what separates a common law marriage from mere cohabitation. Some persons may mistakenly believe they are common law spouses if they have lived with another for an extended period of time, particularly if they have children together. Others may assume that they can never be deemed married unless they have gone through the statutory formalities. When their understanding is challenged by some dispute with their partners, third parties or government authorities, they may discover too late that they have foregone rights or undertaken responsibilities contrary to their intentions.    You may need to prove in a court of law that the couple was actually married.|`|z88IMXNFaa	See link below for rules on Pennsylvania Common Law marriage.  However, if one party is legally married to someone else, there can never, ever be a "marriage."  That's bigamy and it's a felony.|`|1a42bf28fe11e609b0c68795bce43d6baa	Common law marriage Usually is in effect after 7 years in most states, but not if someone is legally married already. Common law marriages do not make it so you can file any taxes with a married status though.
XoYaFgkyaa	Nice article.  I must be insane or something, because I see the same responses from Obama supporters.  They usually say something to the effect of "he's only been in office two weeks", "Bush is the cause of all this", "".  I mean, I am almost starting to believe that half the people here aren't really people at all, but paid media propagandist or something.  Its like a cookie cutter response, just reworded and switched around to make it seem like they are original.    Anyhow, I like Stunt mans response.  Now on to my opinion of the piece:    I don't think doomsday is here, but I do agree that alot, not all, but a lot of Obama supporters do have a certain sense of naivete about them.  I think you can attribute this to the degree of success of the U.S.  They have lived a life of luxury in a period of our country that was in an economic boom.  They are decadent, they view the world through play stations, pizza, and food on the table three times a day 7 days a week.  They have become comfortably numb, in other words.  They don't need to think, they only need to consume, and whomever gives them the most promise for a care bear camp full of online gamers, ipods, fast food, and a big fat paycheck, is the one who is going to win when those fun times end because they can't afford to have that lifestyle any more.  Its like when you take a toy away from the child, and the father says to the mother, "let the child have its toy back, YOU are causing his suffering".  That essentially happened with Bush.  Bush was a bad president in terms of the economy, but he wasn't the sole cause of it, then big Daddy Obama stepped in and said, "i will give you back your toys, if you vote for me."      I do agree that this will eventually cause a more conservative movement.  As they start to realize that no one is going to bring back those day, except themselves, they will become less reliant on the promises of others, and more reliant on themselves.    In essence, I think you are seeing an adolescent phase of America--We are going through growing pains.    So I don't think its Obama's fault directly, Its the people who have become the image in that article.|`|AA11566648	Very scary stuff.

"Obama, who was never even a boy scout, has the arrogance to believe he knows better than his generals" is interesting. Like it or not, Obama is the President of the United States and as such it makes him Commander in Chief. That means he is the boss of Petraeus and the US military!

There are many people taking an active roll in what we want and voicing our opinions.    It is well known that we want our troops home from a place where we had reason to go in the first place.  We were lied to, in order to start a war and invade a country.  This is a sore spot for all Americans.     You don't have to be on the right or left to see that we were asleep at the wheel.

I think we shouldn't have gotten involved in the first place, but now that we are in it, I think pulling out early would be a mistake. Hey, here's an idea! Obama wants us out in 16 months? How about getting rid of the stupid regulations that make winning a war hard? Let our troops go over their and do what they are over there to do without worrying about bureaucratic B.S. An ex-Marine friend of mine told me about some of the stupid regulations that were forced on them, such as having to have the first bullet in their magazine turned around backwards, so when they were fired on by the enemy, they had to remove their magazine, take the first bullet out then slap the magazine back in before they could start firing back. In a combat situation, seconds count and when our troops have stupid *** regulations imposed upon them from pencil pushers with their heads shoved up the own *** who have never been to war, it hinders their ability to effective fight and win a war.

This is way better then what has been goin on.  President Bush, without so much as issuing a press statement, on May 9 2007 signed a directive that granted near dictatorial powers to the office of the president in the event of a national emergency declared by the president.     Bush also issued an executive order that could be interpreted to outlaw anti-war protest.    None of this was put in the public for some time. It was hidden like most of his presidency.    At least Obama came into office working. Bush took the first few months of office on vacation, then we were attacked.  He didn't even bother to read the briefings.     Obama is a far cry better then other choices we had, and a major step up then what we had.

You can request court-supervised visitation on the basis of past domestic violence.    A half an hour drive time won't make a difference.

Good luck.|`|CwmoQhTeaa	If u have an order of protection they wont grant visitation for some ligit reason hes been ordered to stay away.  since hes not on birth certificate he has no paternal rights, should he try to get visitation they would automatically do dna test to make sure hes the dad. should for some reason they grant visitation he would need to make the 1.5 hr drive. my friend moved 1hr away and dad had to make drive to pick up n drop off. moving before will not make a difference n they cannot stop u from moving. but laws vary state to state.

ac3561c0ed6428f357981b995404a2b1aa	The reason the government gets away with doing those things is that it is big enough that it doos not have to listen to you and big enough to control you and too big for you to instead restrain.    A small government simply odes not have the power to do those things: tax, print money, determine it's own salaries. If you are in the US, you already have a way to fix it: The Constitution.    The way to get the Constitition back is to vote for politicians who will follow it. Neither of the main parties are doing that and have not done it since at least Wilson and Hoover. In fact, it really started going wrong with Lincoln, the first Republican President, who was highly interventionist.    Two things yo can do: (1) Vote for candidates who follow the Constitution. (2) Educate others so that they will do the same and also put pressure on politicians who don't want to to do it anyway until you are able to sack them. That's waht you do to employees who sabotage the company - sack them. With politicians youdo this at elections or, if the crimes are bad enough (and they are), you impeach.

They actually began planning for it before oil peaked at $144. Russia thought they were looking very good at the time.     From an economic viewpoint spending money on defense is not all bad. Look at what we are doing now in America. We are considering expanding government spending during an economic crisis. This is a standard method of breaking out of a recession.

Discuss this situation with an attorney, many give free consultations.|`|b8kbeVx2aa	It's important to realize the consequences are real in this legal matter and should not be taken lightly. Anytime someone accuses you of doing something you did not, you need to seek legal council .   My advise to you would be to ask for a public defender, or find an attorney that does pro bono work.   " Pro bono publico " . This is a phrase derived from Latin meaning "for the public good" Pro bono service, unlike traditional volunteerism, uses the specific skills of professionals to provide services to those who are unable to afford them.    I just went through a big legal trial and I was the defendant. I did have legal representation . In my situation it was important for me to find good legal council because my life was at stake. It was expensive and my expierence lasted for over 2-1/2 years.     Somethings you can do to improve your situation is: write everything down. Make a list of all the events and write down the event numbers . Example - Event1, Event2, Event3 : Try to remember as much as you can sometimes you just need to start writing everything down. Then go back and write a final draft.  Do the best you can . Remember no one is going to prove your innocense for you . It's your job to prove your innocent beyond a reasonable doubt .    I you have a local doctor or psycologist who understands your grandmas condition ,you can ask that person to submit as statement or testify as to what mental condition she is in .However you might need a lawyer to do this work for you because there are HIPPA laws that can hinder an investigation .                                      I also read Psalms Chapter 1 - 8 and I prayed everyday .

Vu7kCPesaa	Soldiers swear an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. If an order contradicts that, they should disobey it.     Of course, they will likely be punished for it, as most of what the government does these days is in direct violation of the Constitution.|`|25Cu0kjFaa	Soldiers are explicitly told that an unlawful order is not to be obeyed. That's stuff you learn in your first days as a member of the US military. You cannot be ordered to commit a crime, help cover-up a crime, lie to a superior, or anything else that violates the UCMJ, laws of land warfare, or the local laws where you are stationed.|`|92jr44kFaa	U.S. Soldiers are required to disobey unlawful orders.

According to the Law of Armed Conflict, it is each servicemember's duty to assess orders given to them to ensure they're not breaking any international laws.     "I was just following orders" is not a sufficient defense. Ask anyone who was convicted at the Nuremburg trials following WWII.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	Soldiers are required to disobey a unlawful order, but it isn't that clear cut. If I give a soldier an order to polish my boots the soldier might think this order is illegal. He would be correct as this would constitute a personal service. (I tried to find an easy example) But the order would not result in injury, death or disgrace to the country so the soldier would obey the order and then report it higher up the command after wards. If I told him to execute a prisoner then the soldier should disobey immediately as there is no return from this order. Should he obey he would be in as much trouble as I would.    The first example isn't a very good one, but I think I make the idea clear.|`|jNQbVDHSaa	disobeying is mutiny|`|vGCEFrhuaa	Rests on the soldiers morals/|`|AA11757826	yes they can be prosecuted, and convicted, see Nurenburg.|`|h1lDGNp4aa	They are required to obey orders.  However, that doesn't mean that a soldier should if an order would constitute a crime but it would take a brave soldier not to obey.  I suppose he could be punished but I doubt it since I'm sure that the commanding officer would know whether or not he is ordering his soldiers to do something criminal.....all one has to do is read the Geneva Convention Treaties and I'd bet my bottom dollar that the officers are well schooled in the treaties' provisions.      I've done a lot of reading about WW2 and one of the books addressed the issue of the Germans committing crimes against the Jews and others who supposedly weren't fit to live; those German soldiers who did not want to be involved in the "final solution" were given other assignments. They could make choices even if those Germans who committed crimes against humanity wanted you to think differently.|`|c59a4010def6f797e0a0e7c583f93ec6aa	You can petition to be a conscientious objector but that will lead to a courts martial and if proved unfounded can lead to a death sentence.

Maybe because the government won't drop a nuke on you if it wants your camera.|`|686x7QI0aa	heres the start of it from the Govs angle and why we should be worried:  Last week, legislation to require a federal license to possess any detachable-magazine semi-automatic rifle or shotgun, or any handgun, has been introduced in Congress. Bills to re-impose the federal "assault weapon" and "large" magazine ban, or to impose a much broader ban, have been introduced in Congress since 2003, and will likely be introduced in the current Congress soon.     Already, the deliberate deceptions we heard from anti-gunners previously are resurfacing. Anti-gun Sen. Carl Levin, (D-Mich.), said Thursday on the floor of the Senate that "assault weapons" are "capable of firing up to 600 rounds per minute" and that they are "once again pervading our streets and neighborhoods."   Did we mention that our opponents are deliberately deceptive?|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	The reason is private citizens are protecting themselves from home invaders so a shotgun loaded with rifled slugs will do just fine.  The government is protecting its citizens from a Nuclear attack from Iran, DPR Korea, Russian Federation, China, etc.      If you really needed to ask this question I doubt you will be rational enough to accept the explanation.|`|jKMH27gKaa	In my experience, people who are pro-gun control are not the ones who are pro-war -- Personally, I don't think ANYONE should be using an assault rifle to do anything --- I mean look at the name! It's an ASSAULT rifle.    EDIT: Do I really have to explain this to you morons? An "assault" rifle is not a shotgun, it is a high-powered semi-automatic MACHINE GUN. Do you really think it's necessary to MACHINE GUN a home invader? Ask any cop and they'll tell you the same thing: The only person who should have a gun like that is a soldier or law enforcement. Some dink who's afraid of being robbed will only hurt himself or his family trying to fire that. Get a handgun if you're that paranoid -- but just pray you have a noisy home invader who wakes you before he finds it first.|`|92jr44kFaa	People should have the right to defent themselves, their homes, and their families.  The choice of weapon is up to them.    Look at the name?  So just because some people call it by a scary name, that means that people shouldn't be able to own it?  What kind of sense does that make?  Most avid firearms enthusiasts don't even recognize the term "assault rifle."    It's all just a big lie.|`|cWgb58S8aa	I think it's as necessary for people to protect themselves with assault rifles as it is for the government to protect us with 5,535 Nuclear warheads. the power to incinerate the entire planet.

They are doing all they can, but the production of lumber and soy has almost single-handedly turned Brasil from a third-world country to an emerging super-power. The country has to balance its economic and enviromental needs.     I agree though, that more international pressure should be put on their government, seeing as how the Amazon basin significantly effects the weather and climate of the entire globe.|`|33ppbrMJaa	Yes, we should try to save the Amazon. It is said the cutting there is destroying thousands of acres of forest each day.  The value of those forests is either not understood by the people involved or they don't care.  These trees are not only greatly involved with our climate and the very air we breathe, but they are the source of medical discoveries that provide the medicines that cure many diseases, to say nothing of the animal species involved     Not only that, but we should make an effort to save our own forests, too. George W. Bush has allowed lumbering in our forested areas, with roads and trails and the general activity that goes on when huge trucks start plowing through forestland. Also, the changing climate has caused many more forest fires that destroy this priceless heritage. Firefighters say that these fires are so hot they are destroying the roots and prohibit new growth and that much of our West may be arid desert in years to come.  Whether or not you believe in Global Warming, our very lives depend upon our trees.      Some people are uneducated about the importance of greenery in our existence. They toss out ridicule with words like "treehugger," not realizing that the oxygen they breathe is dependent upon forestry in our world. As the world's population rises and greedy developers plunder our forests, we are one step closer to destroying our planet and our lives.  "Save the Amazon" should be a rallying call to all who care about the future of our world.|`|4fqaQRnIaa	The lungs of our Earth.

6380221dbceb0381d89b54bd786e9f42aa	It's poor kids health care, and historically, the poor smoke and drink more than any other class. So, you're taxing what minimal money they have, and of course that leads to crime.   We've had a state increase of one dollar last July, and lowlifes are now hitting convenience stores at record numbers; some don't even take money, just the cartons of cigarettes on the floor behind the counter.|`|GE6vqqF8aa	Well, many people that have drug problems steal anyway because they're unemployed and don't pay taxes; they're the tax-eaters of society because most of them are on disability. I'm a moderate conservative, but I do support taxing people who use alcohol and smoke. The reason is because it cost much more to treat these people and it's their personal vices that bring on most of their health problems. Just like a person who has a bad driving record pays higher insurance premiums, people who smoke and drink alcohol should be taxed more so as to contribute to the additional expenses they create via their addictions. Maybe this will give people a little extra motivation to not start the habit in the first place. When the hell are people ever going to learn that smoke, drugs, and alcohol ruins people's lives and can kill?! Americans are the biggest addicts worldwide, and we're made fun of in other countries all the time for the crap that we put in our bodies and use to fry our brains. It's no wonder why our economy is failing, and a lot of it is due to Americans being so doped-up and drunk that they can't keep a job or pass a piss test! We have trouble finding employees because a high percentage of people who apply can't pass a drug test..lol!|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Obama said it.

Thanx for "thinking" you were keeping us free in the Gulf; we weren't free even then. Your time there, your losses, and those of your friends were simply wasted so the ruling class could pay back some campaign debts.    I hope I don't offend you, but I gotta tell you straight: You're confused as to what "freedom" and "liberty" are.  True freedom means that companies can pay whatever wage employees are willing to work for; Freedom means that companies are allowed to base their manufacturing plants anywhere they choose; Liberty means a people able to buy products manufactured anywhere and still be considered "patriotic".    To be a productive American requires some education. As boring as it might seem (it is NOT) a basic understanding of economics is required. All this whining and bellyaching about the poor abused worker in America and the lamenting that all the jobs are going overseas, and evil Walmart is selling stuff made in China is a sign that the person doing the crying has been steeped in the ideals of communitarianism and has now embraced that philosophy as his own.

Businessmen are just that; men and women seeking to generate money by conducting business. If the United States' government (at all levels) interferes excessively in the conduct of business and unions place unmanageable conditions in the workplace in terms of who can do what and at what cost to industry, it is in the businessman's interest to seek alternatives. Though nobody seems to make the connection, or is willing to talk about it if they do, the boost in minimum wage preceded massive job losses and caused many businesses to dramatically reduce their workforce or close up altogether because it was unsustainable. Many of those who lost jobs because of this ended up on public assistance, and they are among the poorest. Who does social engineering of this kind benefit? Only the few who retained their jobs, but now have to accept more labor in the wake of getting a government-mandated raise to compensate for those reductions. There was a time when 'building a career' was just that - working with what you could get until you could get something better, and the more dedicated that you were to 'climbing the career ladder', the better your outcome. We have entered an era that vilifies people who 'go for the gold', for if they do it will be seized by the state and redistributed to others who did not invest their time and effort into building a business or career, but rather made a career out of sucking the government teat. It is the failure of socialist policies like this that when you remove the incentive to reach for the sky, people will stop trying to do so and settle for less. Why bother when to gain rewards is to have them subject to being stripped from you by an overbearing and self-destructive government employing an economic model that eats its own tail to stave hunger? Eventually, the snake will die, but kick that can down the road to a future generation and all is well. If you get government out of the way, true freedom will return - not only on an individual level, but also in the business world, where job options are available to the working class and wages increase accordingly due to the competition for skilled (and non-skilled) labor. That is not the direction we are heading in currently. Free enterprise is true freedom for all involved, and twenty bucks a week for those who manage to keep decreasing numbers of jobs is selling the American People short.|`|TuizUTZCaa	Im prepared to sacrifice every American life for freedom , so the world can be free of America.|`|JdOhkCPAaa	My freedom is not for sale -I would rather live in a country that rebuilds itself based on freedom rather than be enslaved by debt which I never asked for in the first place .

For instance: Telling our banks how to make loans, regulating our schools, enforcing trivial laws that should be up to the individual, making companies buy health care for their employs, etc. Although some of that may sound good and makes sense, it's still our government sticking their noses in where it does not belong. I certainly don't want our government making decisions for me and think we should start telling them to butt out. Look at the mess the Clinton administration made in our economy with Fannie Mae. I certainly don't want our government, whom can't make sound decisions, tell me how to run my business.    Socialism is one step closer to communism. Although I'm 59 years old and a woman, I still have enough spunk to take up arms and fight to the death for my capitalist country.    Edit: Although I am neither Democrat or Republican and vote for whom I believe has the most integrity, good leadership qualities and less questionable character, I joined Grassfire and think it will make my voice heard on some issues I'm very concerned about. Thanks for the link.    Edit: In reading Foolosifer's last comments, I petition we support him in running for President next term. Unfortunately, most in our country does not want an honest, level-headed politician in office that has integrity, defends our Constitution and wants to place less government controls into our lives. Maybe I'm the only one, but you've got my vote. Think that will get anywhere? LOL|`|65653c6c063e99db1f7f272c5c93e006aa	It is my duty to stand and yes, fight for what I believe in, namely my country.    I had  two brothers who fought side by side in Vietnam and I never saw an ounce of indignation or arrogance in them upon return to the US.  I told the elder brother once how proud I was of him and he said,  "I was just doing my duty. "   His stance was strong, firm, committed and yet humble.    Has our country declined to the point there are no more of this type of individuals left?    There is no room for question here...you will fight for your country or hand the reins to someone else.  Isn't it just that simple?  Must we play these political checkers while time just ticks away and with each passing moment it sinks deeper and deeper into non existence.  It seems that some have a mind set of, the running of this country is like playing a game and may the best man/woman win...the stakes are far too high to take that gamble.    This political back and forth is a tactic,  just full of words and stalling techniques designed to buy time while America falls apart.    How in the world can we be so blind as to allow the coming events to occur without at least trying to do something about it.

The US gov is scaring the sheeple both domestic and abroad (Arab Gulf States) with the idea that somehow Iran is the school bully. The Arabs get scared and buy US weaponry and give the US easy access to their resources since most of those governments are in power because of US protection in the first place.

Note that this quote does not appear in the bill itself, but occurred during parliamentary debate.     The 1960 bill of rights is a bit of an odd legislative footnote as it had limited legal force (full constitutional protections wouldn't come until the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982), but Dief the Chief's heart was in the right place.

Our president to fail? you mean the one you elected who has ZERO experience (but looks good in a swimsuit).  Bush, terrorist? What a LOON.  You should THANK GOD (if you believe in God), for Bush. Left-wing Fruitcakes like CLINTON opened the door for the terrorists to get in. Remember WTC bombing number 1? some say it was a failed nuke, because of all the RAD teams running around. 3 Embassy bombings, hundreds dead. bombings all through Saudi Arabia with hundreds of americans dead. Uss cole bombing, 23 dead. Somalia fiasco with army rangers cornered from LACK OF SUPPORT, and had to chew their way out of a city, killing 700 Somalis in the process.  WHY? clinton had Bin Laden in his sites during his administration, but was too worried about public opinion (and oral sex), to worry about defending this great nation.  Socialist loons like you want to make the U.S. into a cradle to grave nanny state like many other 'free' countries in the rest of the world.   Have you ever BEEN outside America? I have spent over 20 years of my life living outside the U.S., and while the U.S. has its problems, you DONT want socialized health care and the government crawling up your anal cavity with a microscope.  WHY is the economy a shambles today, because of Bush? This is so INCREDIBLY DUMB. The economy is a wreck because CLINTON tried to SOCIALIZE a CAPITALISTIC system. THAT is why it collapsed, and King Obama is going to DOLE OUT ONE TRILLION dollars?????   LET THEM SINK.  Welcome to the new FDR, and big government. Dig DEEP into your pockets, because we are going to PAY for all the shiftless, low-life losers that wont work, socialize the medical system so EVERYONE will run to the doctor when they have a cold while some woman has a miscarriage on the street because she cant see a doctor. your health care system will be over run, implode, and collapse.

If you consider killing people the best way to relieve them from their suffering, you can of course say that. About 300'000 people in Iraq were saved from oppression by the USA, all lying in their graves now.  It's just as bizarre to mention Saudi Arabia, the probably most oppressive country in the world. A country where e.g. girls were forced back into a burning school where they burned alive, for the sole reason that they wore no head scarves.  In fact, I cannot think of any country (or nation) that has done what you ask. Islam is about oppression, after all, at least against women.

0982b83a0496946be27e0be6e067b757aa	I have had two children and worked until I was 7 months pregnant with the first and 8 months with  the second,  was divorced when my children were 4 and 5, never received a penny from my ex, had to pay for childcare myself and have worked all my life. My working didn't affect my children as they both have always worked since leaving college.  Some of these mothers have never worked in their lives and have no intention of getting up in the morning to earn money and the sad thing is neither will most of their children unless the Government changes the rules.|`|uBgoYCZPaa	every persons situation is different and its unfair to judge unless you have gone through similar situation. try living in ireland where if you cant afford to work full time as childcare cost are the same as your monthly wage unless u can work part time and have a family member mind your son. our government doesnt pay for childcare costs. you should be lucky for what u have and not complain, you never know when things could get worse. i've learnt that by being honest you get nothing from the government while so called single mothers still live with their boyfriends and get almost everything paid from the rent, some bills back to school money and lots more, the social welfare should be regularly checking up on these people, or the foreigners that are claiming unemployment while they have returned home|`|ouIZdXdaaa	i understand your point and it is correct, but everyones circumstance is different so you can't put what your saying against every single parent family.   For example if the family has a disabled child that needs constant care they are in no position to work, and for example transport getting your child to and from school when you have nobody else to help is hard  Nobody can really judge unless you've beeen in the situation yourself.|`|PZZkjST7aa	We have about 2m unemployed in the UK at the moment and rising, about 800.000 vacancies falling, and therefore many people who there is simply no work for and need to claim benefits. It makes no sense to single out lone parents as being less deserving, or to force them to compete in a dwindling job market when they may actually be doing a better job as homemakers. Relationships and marriages break down and the state gives a subsistence allowance to lone parents if they cannot be fully maintained by maintenance payments from the ex-partner. The alternative is that all children in lone parents families should be taken away from their family and into care, which would cost a lot more and is not socially desirable. That is the logical conclusion of your question.|`|M3maZgdyaa	If parents want to stay home with their children they should not have divorced.|`|x647LeB2aa	I think the problem is labelling and assuming all single parents are women who could not keep their legs together and now sponge off the state.    I can give you some examples of 'real' people I know, all of them single parents but all for different reasons.    L is 37.  She has 5 children by four different fathers and lives is a Council House.  She has never worked (and I doubt she ever will) and lives completely off the state (taxpayers) money.    S is in her forties.  She has two sons and was made a widow 4 yeas ago when her husband was killed in an accident at work.  She stays at home to care got her children but is looking for work that fits around school hours. She claims benefits and gets a widow's pension.    J is in her thirties and has two children.  She left her abusive husband after the final beating he gave her was witnessed by her small daughter.  She was rehoused by the Government and receives benefits.  Her husband has thus far avoided paying maintenance.        The point is, all these people are raising these children alone but can we label them all DSS blugers?  I think perhaps 'L' is but the other two?    How can the 'system'  differentiate? How can it investigate why/how these women are in this position?    I agree that the DSS should not pay for people like 'L' to sit at home all day watching Jeremy Kyle (or starring on it) but I would say at least 50% of 'Single Parents' are in a situation that deserves a lot of compassion.|`|E9yH3tWMaa	The country (and the planet) is over populated so it is bizarre to subsidise the production of children, especially those whose environments make them more likely to be non-contributors in adult life.    A more sensible policy would be to pay single parents to bring up their children at home only on production of a certificate of sterilisation. This would significantly reduce the size of the underclass of wasteful eaters that live on the labour of others.    Unfortunately, International Financiers who own most of the retail outlets and utilities require ever increasing volumes of customers to finance their expansion so they instruct governments to instigate policies of over taxing working people in order to subsidise customers whose spending power is derived from benefits.|`|VfYvJypEaa	The state shouldn't simple as that . Divorcees are one thing but young women having babies as a career move should be outlawed . If the can't pay for their kids then they should be taken off them and given to parents that can . There are plenty of couples waiting to adopt .|`|865YvXXlaa	I don't think parents should be able to stay at home on benefits when their children are of school age  - they should be able to get a job which fits around the school day - after all, they can't say they have to look after their children when they're not even at home during the day!!!|`|luQ1N9rSaa	I agree with what you said about if people are alone and have no means to support the child then they shouldn't have the child in the first place. To me that seems fair.    However, I think that single parents should be able to stay at home and raise their children rather than go to work. I do not have children but I've always thought that it's unfair to just give them to a stranger. Shouldn't children be allowed to spend more time with their parents.    I'm talking very young children here, pre nursery school age, they would surely prefer to be with their parents wouldn't they? Surely it's not right just to bump them off on a stranger.    I really don't know much about your system in the states but here in the UK when children get to a certain age they can go to nursery school before they go up to primary school (kindergarten), when they are 5 years old. I think this is right, children should go to nursery school so that amongst other things, they can learn to mix with other children.     However over here, nursery school is not all day, it is either morning or afternoon, so even then parents should stay at home so they can look after their kids for the rest of the day. It just really doesn't seem fair on the kids if not.    So to sum up, although I agree with you about single people who can not support children not having children in the first place. I do think that if they do have the child they should be supported if they wish to stay home and raise their children. Otherwise, how is it fair on the kids?    So there you go, I may have lost the point of the question a little, I'm not sure but I hope I got my opinion across alright.|`|YwdsP4c2aa	Yeah let's go back to the good old days when those children whose fathers had fukced off or were, for other reasons, not around, got stigmatised at school.  Let's punish the women whose men, for no fault of their own, have gone awol. That will teach them. None of us know what is around the corner, you may be living comfortably in a two parent household today but you could quite easily find yourself having to cope as a single parent tomorrow.    As for jobs for single parents, there simply aren't that many going, unless you think young kids should be latchkey kids and nip down to the chippy for their supper.

By his own admission, he and his people "Screwed up" on the Daschel appointment. And that, coupled with the embarrassment over his Secretary of Treasury, makes for some pretty lousy dinner theater.    In addition, he was fully expecting Congress to have enacted his stimulus bill, and can't seem to budge it.     So far, it's not a very auspicious beginning.|`|1HQavOGOaa	A funny joke.|`|AWQ5VHeqaa	I rate him a minus 1000.  he has not thought anything through to do it properly.his stimulus package is not totally aimed at stimulating the economy or helping americans. look at his bill for health care for illegal immigrant children and the part of the stimulus bill that has funding for family planning and contraceptives through medicare funds, all that is pork barrel and does not help americans because currently people on medicare has to pay for their own dental work and also the prescription drug programs for medicare has a cap of two thousand 500 dollars after that the the medicare recipient has to pay for the meds out of pocket and most of the time a lot of people have to start paying within 4months because of the meds they are on for their health conditions and a lot of states like massachusetts for example will not help because their policy is the primary health care is medicare so secondary assistance will not be give because you would have to spend 9 thousand dollars out of pocket first before the state will help this is ludicrous given the fact medicare recipients also have to pay rent and utilities.|`|xLj4nilXaa	I think he's doing great! Change America = YES WE CAN!!!|`|yUXOOlAiaa	He's done as well as can be expected, however the day will soon arrive that people will realize that nothing has 'changed' and it's what they do themselves that really makes a diference to their daily lives not what a politician does. Obama isn't the token 'messiah' he's just another politician.|`|HQKuzxulaa	Outside America people think that he is exactly what the USA and the world need. Thank you americans for electing him.|`|IG8s8UnSaa	I hope that at least he knows the difference between the windows and the doors.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	Honestly, he as been a dismal failure.  He has made no progress and has actually lost ground.  Remember he had everyone pumped up for change.  His "Stimulus Package" is the first great test of that change.  After three weeks, support for this monstrosity of a Bill is 37%.  In the House of Representatives, he got no Republican support and even lost Democrat support.  Now it is smelling up the Senate where it has not got enough votes to pass.  Even though the Democrats could pass it without Republican support.    Anyone, no matter how much of a supporter they are, has to realize that he has done poorly so far.  If they do not think so, they do not know what "poorly" looks like.    Let's look at President Bush's transition track record in 2001. Remember that the traditional 100-day period was shortened as a result of the election lawsuit. Here is what  Paul Light of the Brookings Institution wrote at the time:     "Bush gets an A on the transition into office. He survived his truncated 40-day transition with only one major mistake  Linda Chavez, who withdrew her nomination for Labor Secretary after the flap over allowing an illegal immigrant to stay in her house.  Bush also deserves an A-plus for the timely assembly of his White House team. Building around Vice President Dick Cheney, the Bush White House is an MBA's dream: efficient, predictable, well controlled, on time, under budget."     Now compare that to the feckless lack of direction and constant posing for the camera that we see in the White House today.      *|`|64SObnr5aa	I am waiting with baited breath    Coming from a person who voted for him while not at the same time giving him a blank check or hating him for partisan reasons that most who do can not explain fully what ails them about Obama.  Only that he is a socialist (not), communist (not), tax and spend democrat (both parties suck) or some other such nonesense without an iota of proof, let alone understanding.  (probably comes under the heading "I heard it on the radio, so it must be true.")    Check out this:  http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/prom...    Out of the 500 promises he has made during the campaign, here is his score card as of today.    Promises kept 7  Compromise 1  Broken 1  Stalled 1  In the works 17    He broke one promise so far, allowing five days of public comment before signing bills, he failed to do that with the signing of his first law........stay tuned.    Peace  Jim    .

Bush rocked? As evidenced by the fact you can still breath, walk, and talk out your brownhole.(what about the folks who died in 9/11, i dont think they are walking, or talking out of their brownhole)      McCain/Palin weren't socialists. They'd have been much better. (You must have the same IQ as Palin)      I've seen 'em, and I don't expect any of the liberalcrats on here to admit anything.

This makes for unbalanced governing.  I appreciate my party (democratic) but the fact is, when too many of them get together many of the get drunk on the Kool-Aid, just like the republicans did during the Bush Administration. To get things done in the best interest of the country, we need balance in the House and the Senate.  This way, everyone has to work together.  With balance, neither spending programs or tax reform gets too much emphasis.  So, my disappointment lies in the fact that so many republicans did so poorly a job representing ALL of their constituents that we now have to deal with program starved democrats in Congress.    And it's interesting that you don't think of Palin as a Socialist.  You know that whole spreading the wealth thing, right?  She's the only one of the 4 candidates who runs a State Sponsored wealth spreading program, in cutting checks to all Alaskan Citizens using the profits of oil companies in Alaska.  Taking profits from corporations and giving it to the citizens (including herself.)  That's socialism you can believe!|`|gj2IEXk7aa	I don't think there has been a good election to vote for since Bill Clinton was on the bill.

I am a liberal independent. I voted for Obama.    Do I think it was a mistake to vote for him? No. Do I agree with everything he's doing? No.    For once, can we please put the partisanship aside and actually *give a damn* about what's going on in this country?    I applaud the Republicans and conservative Democrats in Congress who are trying to pull the unnecessary items out of the stimulus package. But please give credit where credit is due. Just because you don't agree with Obama's ideology or whatever doesn't mean you need to slam him every chance you get. Sure, I think Bush was a terrible president, but I will give credit where it is due. For seven years, he kept this country safe (albeit with some shaky methods, but still). His global AIDS program is a success. He tried on the education front.    Let's all forget about liberal, conservative, Democrat, Republican. Seriously. What happened to American?

If that does happen, another party is likely to expand and take their place in the big two.    I do not have enough knowledge of the California political situation to give an informed opinion on what might or might not happen there.
UJbNNtxNaa	Depends. Your best bet, find a master at arms at a nearby reserve station ,and talk to him, not a recruiter, so you can get the skinny on how the job really is. When I went to enlist, I wanted  a X ray tech (ironic the job  I picked was the complete reverse of a desk jockey) so I contacted a specialist, then SGT at womack here in Fort Bragg ,to get the inside scoop on the job. the SGT said gradually it gets better ,more responsibility, perks, the private just starting out said he did not like shoving a hose up a general's buttocks to put fluid for an X ray. Now people will have different perceptions and outlooks, but you must read between the lines. I got my information from the source. If you need to find a MAA in your area, just look up the navy reserve unit in you area on google. not the recruiter, then make sure you get the right number for the MAA. Army, same deal, call up the reserve base on a weekend, get in contact with a MP that has done active duty, not just reserve. and have a good one, good luck with your choice.|`|CLOtMCwSaa	Go with MP, I am one, I love being one.

wbIEau0qaa	obama openly and willingly allows the american public to view the history and backround of all his nominees. you see it was his idea(if thats not integrity, i dont know what is). now just imagine if we audited every politician, republican and demoocrat alike. do you expext only obama's appointees to have back taxes? no.     that said, i have to pay my freaking taxes, i am wondering how these politicians arent willing to pay theirs|`|0c91b79437b0e602213a070c2fc739d0aa	I was never overly impressed one way or another with Bush43.  As for Obamas ferreting out process, at quick glance it would appear that his process is only slightly flawed.  But when you think it through, it's not just Obama.  Let's face it, these guys are professional politicians.  Their whole lives and existence are based on the cards they show and damage control.  Most people apparently believe that they (Daschle and company) didn't see this coming.  It makes me want to ask, what else are they hiding?  Back taxes are just the icing on the cake.  Daschle had to go to a closed door session.  His skeletons must REALLY be something.  That Obama too didn't see it coming speaks volumes.  And as of this mornings news, even his guy who came up with the campaign strategy of "Hope" and "Change" is now in trouble...  I suspect (as I have all along) that this is a foretelling of what's to come.  Those who voted for him were foolish and have been hood winked.    Everyone is so busy watching what the right hand is doing, they forget about the left.  They insist they are adults, but it seems they barely know enough to look both ways before crossing the street.|`|a375l0D7aa	I do not hate either Obama or Bush. But those that thought Obama would be able to govern effectively, lacking any experience, without putting experienced people in place were naive. And face it: The Dems have been out of the White House for 8 years, so their experienced people had to earn a living doing something, and so they became lobbyists.I got no problem with that part.    What I have a problem with is the voters who believed the rhetoric of change that has proven to be campaign rhetoric only. And of course, I dislike the arrogance of the man who thought he was so popular, and we were so focused on the economy, that he could appoint tax dodgers to high level positions with no outcry from the American people.
55NKPb82aa	I love the "globalist" mindset in this country (since there are now only two parties, the Americans and the Globalists - Americans believing in our Constitution as written by the brilliant founders in order to protect America and Americans - and Globalists which have a "world view" or socialism as their agendas).     The money for this now trillion dollar spending package will be on the backs of your own children, and most of that "pork" included has nothing to do with either "creating" jobs (unless you mean more government jobs) or stimulating the economy, or even providing for infrastructure of other needs. In fact, included within it is now a provision for a national database on the health of every American which can be shared on a "need to know" basis, sort of a Patriot Act III - even lawsuits and sexual practices.     Dig your head in the sand claimed "Democrats" or "liberals." Obama is another Bush III, using "executive orders" and other means to bypass the Constitution and it's provisions. Between he and Roberts, that other "globalist" on the Supreme Court (now using international precedence for their decisions), they couldn't even get the oath correctly - maybe because Obama truly is not a natural born citizen, since he continues to refuse to substantiate even his claim to be legally qualified for the office in which he was sworn in not once, but twice (even that might not be legally performed).|`|OnWmqs4paa	Yes it's payback for the $350 million in campaign donations, great return huh...|`|et39TGIsaa	I absolutely agree with you.

Look at how they regulate a 500,000 on CEO's but yet government officials (-1) excepted their self raises    I agree it is checks to those states that have pushed high taxes on companies in order to cause the fall of our economy and the loss of jobs in order to create defaults and foreclosures on homes.    This bill is Stimulating their bank accounts.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	Thus far only 37% of Americans are still dopey enough to support it.  Obama has really blown it with this.  I tried to tell everyone he lacks experience and worse, actual leadership ability.  He should have never turned the entire process over to Pelosi and friends and exclude Republicans and Conservative Democrats in the House.    He should start over.  Get rid this monstrosity and this time include Republicans and eliminate anything that is not directly aimed at stimulating the economy.  Hey, Obama!  You got the job!  Now stop campaigning and take the lead.      A real Statesman would lay down the law to Congress and tell them that if anyone even suggests some kind of pork he will single them out for ridicule.     If he actually does that, even a Conservative like me would give him high marks.  But, I suspect he is only executing someone elses orders, I really do.      *|`|yDaNMARcaa	Bush did the same thing not too long ago.  so...    I don't know if it will work, i hope so...
IM30PoPNaa	Obama is a centerist Democrat.  So was Clinton.    Bush represented his party at the time -- the definition of "Republican" is changing.  The fact is Bush enjoyed widespread support within his party up until the 2006 election losses.  After that they tried to distance themselves from Bush, but not many people are fooled.    The Republican party has been an  uneasy alliance with the old style small gov't fiscal conservatives and the religious right.  Those two factions are currently fighting over the soul of the Republican party; thus they are arguing over the current definition of Republican.    In any political system, there is usually a party of the status quo, and a party of change.  As the status quo shifts, one or the other party may better represent it.  What's odd about the present is that although the Republicans had all the power during the creation of the current status quo, it is so unpopular that both parties need to campaign against it.  .|`|mxXwQRfxaa	Good observation.  My wife claims the parties flip every couple generations, and she may be right.  For republicans, things changed a lot after Nixon.  In order to regain power with Regan, they made some tough allegiances with neo-conservative evangelicals.  Under the Bush administration, republicans seemed to completely lose their way by endorsing big-government, big-spending.   I really hope they can get back to what they used to stand for.  At this point, I'll vote for anyone in 2010, of any party, who was against these bailout packages.|`|et39TGIsaa	The 2 major parties have been flipping back and forth for decades.  That's why some people, such as myself, rarely, if ever, vote for the crooks in the major parties anymore.    I vote mostly Libertarian.|`|lPdHWfQxaa	Ummmm, Obama is a Democrat or at least he was the Democratic Party Nominee. Wether you think he's switched his opinions or not is another thing. Clinton was also a Democratic person and Bush was Republican.  Nazism is not socialism, it's Fascism. Socialism can be a good thing. But fascism never is.|`|up40wvywaa	No, no, and I highly doubt it.    I believe that there are other Parties that have claimed to be one or the other, Republican or Democrat in order to be excepted.|`|c3be98a378a7f478cc0867a107078db7aa	no, obama was and is still a marxist|`|b81651b3e653a6354f1a8d2bcbdec23aaa	Well Clinton and bush are both parts of a greater organization that control the world right now. the terms "Democrat" and "Republican" are just illusions of choice, to make us feel like we're part of something that we have no control over. The President of the United States is only achieved through a certain birthright Status that few of us know about. Just look it up..Google who is Bush related to, or who is Obama related to. You may be surprised. We say we live in a Democracy, but our founding fathers clearly state that the USA is a republic.."And to the Republic for which it Stands one nation under God".

Any issue inside India is our internal issue and must be resolved by us only but some selfstyled religious and political leaders always wish to bring such type of issues on international plateform in their own interests. It is my request with the political leaders to work for the economic growth of India, leaving such type of issues behind.

I dont get your question, is it about kids or immigrants-make yourself clear. And as i said in prevoius answers, if you were watching news, than you would hear them saying how well was Britains economy growing because of foreign legal workforce-not my words-its a fact. So i am kind of getting fed up of those type of questions-you are minority who thinks this way!|`|Q9sSWqkOaa	no|`|dwNjN6F0aa	I disagree. I know plenty of white families who have 5-6 kids. Also, when you say "immigrants", who do you mean? My grandfather came over from India when he was a young man, got married to an Irish woman and had one child (my mum). It's funny actually because I am against immigration, but if immigration laws had been imposed back then, I wouldn't even be here.    Anyway, my point is that you can't just say immigrants "breed like rabbits". I think you're talking about a certain race, are you not? You should be more specific. For instance, there's a Somalian girl at my college who has 11 siblings. Disgraceful.|`|vuUVmS7Saa	that is stupid white british people should be able to have as many children as we wish. the increasing population is the governments fault for letting anyone(immigrants. asians etc.) in the country if they have a sob story and then they bring there like 8 kids with them. This happening thousands of times per day is what makes the UK's population more than we can handle.|`|hwuguK98aa	I do see your point RB. I have absolutely nothing against these sorts of people, but where I used to live in London, there was a family of Asians who had not 1, not 5, but 15 kids!!! That I think is very excessive, and the noise from that house! Then again, up where I live now, I know a British minister that had two kids of his own, and adopted three more. Who is going to pay for all the child benefits? We are!    Immigration DOES need to be controlled though. And the sooner it is, the more we will benefit. Anyone want to challenge me on this? Be my guest. It seems to be ludicrous though that where I stay in the Highlands, more than 350 people have lost there jobs at the salmon farm, plus Woolworths, and are now looking for jobs. Oh dear, they cant, because we are unindated with immigrants (mainly Polish) who have the jobs people such as myself want. Ridiculous.  EDIT: Thanks RB, I think it's very unfair that we are employing more foreign workers, when more and more Brits are getting laid off. I for one am desperately looking for another job, as the current one I am in I havent had any shifts since November! (supply worker). So I went for an interview to waitress in a restaurant a few weeks ago, and the employer said she would consider me, but was "going to take on some Czech girls for the posts". WTF?! I only live round the corner from the restaurant and work hard, polite etc. How stupid is that?!!!  EDIT2: The lefty liberals are out in force today! Ha! You dont want to believe me fine. But I for one am sick of not being able to get another job to subsidise the one I have, all because we have an immigration problem!|`|dV4xqQ8Yaa	If Britain is anything like the U.S., the immigrants and illegals have way more kids than they can afford and sponge off the tax paying citizens to pay for them.|`|TOX7HHjhaa	no, i thought that the uk population was going down cos people arent having kids anymore, well thts what i was told.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	If the bathtub is overflowing then you obviously should shut off the valve where the water is coming from.|`|8dhe15MUaa	yes and yes to both and i white and born here in uk|`|mDkUmEUzaa	No British people should not be limited!

BNP havent the money to help us.   All our Lords and politicians heavily invest abroad and cannot do anything without the saddo's in brussels say so.

The average couple in the UK have less than 2 children anyway so even if there was a population issue that wouldn't have any effect, they'd need to do a one-child rule like China.|`|IhJV165waa	why should white british families be limited to 2 kids ?what about the asain populuation of britain?they seem to have more kids than the british. :-)|`|ARAYm7BLaa	No, this rule didn't work in India or China so it wont work here, I don't think any one should be able to have a child until they're over 21 though...that would cut the population down, I know a white woman of 29 who already has 7 children and another on the way...seems to me that a lot of white people have very large families whereas non - whites in this country have only what they can afford to support as they know that they cant rely on benefits|`|OnWmqs4paa	Funny how they forget to say it is Muslim immigrants that are having all the Children...|`|TNTFomKeaa	What does skin colour have to do with it? I read the article and the argument was that EVERYBODY in Britain should have less children, not just white British citizens.  Immigration, the birth rate and population control are very tricky subjects and you and the article both take what is in my opinion a very simplistic approach. It isn't as easy as just controlling immigration or having less children. The birth rate in Britain is falling and this results in an aging population, bringing with it a reduced labour pool and a need for young workers to support the pensioners. If people aren't having children then of course we need immigrants to support the economy. Any solution would need to take all these factors into account.  It's a very threatening article because it suggests that abortion could be used to control the birth rate - this echoes the situation in China where women were forced to have abortions if they already had a second child. I would never want to see anything like that in Britain (or in any other country) for anybody, white, black, yellow, green or any other colour. However, the source is the Daily Express so I would suggest taking anything it says with a pinch of salt as they are known for creating scandals to sell papers without paying too much attention to accuracy.   No one is talking seriously about implementing child limit laws in the UK. Extreme green campaigners propose a draconian suggestion in a reactionary newspaper. None of these people have much real influence. We live in a democracy where everyone is free to air their view, certainly, but any law passed would go through Parliament not the Daily Express. This law is not being discussed in Parliament.  By the way, you should avoid sweeping generalisations such as "immigrants breed like rabbits" as they only weaken your argument.|`|3Yn5Y03Xaa	I agree|`|fcFY6tXeaa	I'd say half of White british families shouldn't be allowed to have ANY kids.

Why did you say only white British people should be limited to 2 children, sorry, I don't live in the UK.|`|fVF5IdDvaa	What an misguided question.    A few points to note:    1)  If it was quoted from the Daily Express (or any tabloid rag), chances are it is:    a) Bullshit fear mongering  b) Taken wildly out of context, or said by one person but is now considered "wot all Greens fink, innit?"  c) Made up to make people angry and buy their paper    British journalism is an absolute disgrace sometimes :o(    2)  Why would they limit to just the British populus?  and how do you define British anyway?  What about Asian people who have lived here for 7 or 8 generations and consider themselves as British as anyone else?  They work and pay their taxes and are governed by the same laws as people who's family history stretches back to the Normans or the Saxons!  Where's the cut off point?      "Breed like rabbits?" So the girls on sink estates that get pregnant to secure a free house and enough taxpayers cash to keep themselves in a Lambert and Stella fuelled nirvana are exempt from this are they?    In answer to your question: if they REALLY wanted to stop the population explosion, how about introducing a decremental child benefit payment scale, eg:     1/2 children - full child benefit per child  3/4 children - half benefit   5+ children  no benefit    Also those benefits would be paid in vouchers that could be redeemed only for children's items such as clothing, food, toys, education and medicine.  Not for beer and fags..    Then would we see a large fall in the amount of women who get pregnant to secure a lifetime of social welfare payments and free housing (immigrants or indigenous population)?  We will never know as our Government is too reliant on their votes - I find it ironic that most of the people who can't be bothered to work and pay their way in society vote for a party called "Labour" - it should be renamed "Spongers"       This is a social engineering problem not a racial one|`|VMTVnUylaa	From the little I have seen of Britain, it seems the white people are no the problem, they seem to have only kids they can afford as to where the non-whites have all kinds of kids and no way to pay for them.|`|0982b83a0496946be27e0be6e067b757aa	Statistics show that it is only the very rich or the very poor who have more than 3 children.

yAsLhdp2aa	the downfall of our economy happened in 1913 when the federal reserve act was signed into law by woodrow wilson.  then in the 70's, we went off the gold standard. the federal reserve is no more federal than federal express...we let international private bankers be incharge of our nations wealth.  we reep what we sow.    --we can not have a decent discussion about economics without addressing where the money actually comes from (opposed to only concentrating on where it is going)|`|mxXwQRfxaa	There is a solid trade-off though.

Go reread the Federalist papers on the debate between Jefferson(farmers interest) and Hamilton(merchantile/trade and industrial growth). Hamilton won and created a bank. Andrew Jackson (racist supreme and creator of the trail of tears) dissolved it in 1837in order to expand westward. The new Federal reserve only came about after the depression of 1907. In that depression fiat money, i.e. the US governments was woefully lacking in reserves. In those days reserves meant gold and silver and the fat cats really got to step in because they had assets to borrow against to provide gold and silver. shortly after ward we got the present fed.

eNVSrvcLaa	With the amount of corruption in financial institutions, I would not be surprise if it is true. Who are we trusting to handle our money?    The likes of Madoff who got away with ripping people of billions and with the institution responsible to protect us against such fraud failing to act despite repeated warnings for a number of years...    What about the lack of morality of financial institutions that received bailout government money that chose to spend some of this bailout money to reward the very people who brought us to this mess in the first place?    I think that we as consumers should be more proactive and stop trusting those financial institutions, (that make their money through exploiting consumers - egample charging hefty interest rates to give loans) to handle our money, and find other options to invest our money.   For example, my brother inlaw has opened his own profitable shop, bought real estate etc.  In other words, make your own money work in legitimate buisness.  In this way, you also control what your money is spent on, instead of relying on someone to place your money god knows where.|`|Z33EyRXwaa	Well your country revolt, and bring all corrupt leaders to trial, and start taking back the wealth.

f75ff92ca745a8eb1d16fca9e57c2bbbaa	Look, don't be fooled by the Chinese. They are all extremely loyal to their own bureaucratic oppressing government, because:    1) Security. They find security in oppression, they see oppression as their great Master. (Have you ever wondered how it is possible how some women who gets beaten up by their husbands choose to stay and not leave the source of their misery?)    2)There is a strong diabolical spiritual authority ruling over China which is the source of a great national bondage. Similar diabolical authorities rules over Islam countries, Africa, Russia and other countries to a lesser degree.    3)They find strenght in numbers and unity, and any democratic ruling will cause partition and opposition, which to them is a sign of weakness.     4)Chinese way of thinking differs from Westerners and are perfectly happy to be like each other, earn like each other, look like each other, do like each other. I'm sure the creator of "Lemmings" got his inspiration from looking at the Chinese.    5) FEAR! Fear of the goverment, the unknown, fear even of each other (remember they are suffering from a mass psycological induced inferior complex...they don't even realize it poor souls) Fear goes hand in hand with resistance to change.    6)Their private family life is practically non existant, as they are controled by their big master. They are told how to eat, what to eat, how to be intimate, how many children they may have...they are slaves, just like the Muslims to their master Islam.

I'd invest a few bucks in a meeting with my lawyer.....today.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	You can stop payment for any reason.   However, the other party may take you to court to meet your obligation.  If he does file with the court, they may suggest mediation first.  Whether you meet with the mediator or go to court, both of you will tell your side of the story and hopefully, be able to hash out your differences.|`|NMBKupXiaa	Ethical yes. legal no. you will need to contact your attorney and just Wait on paying him anything|`|CowgOqXTaa	Depends on State law, but in most cases yes, it's illegal.     The correct procedure is to pay him, and then sue him for your losses.    "I have an employee that has worked for me for about 3 years, he is a sub-contractor...."    Is he an employee, or a sub? It makes a HUGE difference.     If he goes to a lawyer, the lawyer will, look at the ACTUAL conditions under which he worked, and determine whether he was a real sub, or an employee. If he was an employee, and you were paying him as a sub to avoid the consequences of having an employee (Workers comp premiums, Social Security payments etc, etc, etc) then you could end up paying him a LOT of money.    The construction industry is notorious for this. Employers call their employees "sub-contractors", sometimes for years, and then the employee gets mad about something, speaks to a lawyer, and the employer finds out that the guy didn't meet the requirements to be a sub, and they end up in a hole.    EDIT... Whether he is a sub or not is not dependant on whether he has his own company, or whether you give him a 1099. It depends on the actual relationship between you.     If he bids you a price to roof a house, you tell him "do it" and you pay him when he's finished, then it's clear that he's a sub and you have no problem.     If he reports to your foreman at 8am Monday to Friday and does whatever tasks the foreman tells him to during the day, and is paid on an hourly basis, then he's clearly an employee - whatever you want to *call* him - and you're in trouble.    Between those two extremes is a wide range of case law.    Richard|`|SS1VReF0aa	You can stop payment. He did not fullfill his contract with you.

Some of the highest taxes are on your beer.        The tobacco tax is an interesting one. The federal government subsidizes the growing of tobacco.

Then they turn around and sue the tobacco companies, because tobacco is harming the health of our citizens.

9dn1QRfBaa	ok, well as i seem to be the only one answering thus far that identifies as a communist i will do my best to convince you ... but then again it shouldn't be very hard because in all honesty communism is going to be agreeable to the majority of the worlds population .... let me explain ...    communism is a scientific and economic theory that postulates a society where persons divided among economic classes is eliminated and is achieved through the working classes (in alliance with other exploited classes) overthrowing the minority capitalist class.    so ... why should you be a communist (meaning one who promotes a society free from economic exploitation) ?    A communist believes in justice, meaning that he wishes to be paid fairly for the value he produces, not the value of his time which he devotes to creating value for capitalists which use him to create profits. He also wants to see his fellow workers paid honestly because they are his friends and neighbors, thus he will stand in solidarity with them against exploitation. A communist sets himself against the capitalist who is individualistic and exposes the workers to harmful work conditions, substandard equipment and materials, long hours, low pay, no health care, and anti-worker (union busting) actions ....    a communist understands that workers make the wealth of nations not capitalists who feed like a leech off exploited labor ...    basically, as workers throughout the world become better educated thanks to the capitalist's efforts to sell us products like computers, satellite radio, and cellular phones they are sowing the seeds of their own destruction ...     it has been said that a capitalist produces nothing but his own gravediggers ...     the educated working class comes closer everyday to realizing the truth that capitalist "free" market politicians and business leaders try to hide from us .... that a system based upon the need for ever expanding profits will continue to bleed the world to open new markets, further exploit existing markets, and destroy opposing capitalists and their means of production for purposes of conquest ....    Crisis, such as the current economic crisis, has its roots in capitalist overproduction (in this case a housing overproduction), and it is not the only crisis created by a so called "free" market ... the only freedom that comes from such a market is the freedom to exploit others ...    if you are not the type that enjoys exploiting people but instead likes getting a fair wage for the value of your work, likes having good public schools, well funded police, free child care, free healthcare, and other public services, then the path of socialism might be the right one for you ...    at the end of the day ... we are just nicer people ...|`|mxXwQRfxaa	Communism is doomed to fail because of human fallacy. People are too greedy not to take more than their fair share when presented with the opportunity to do so.  There can never be a centralized power without abuse of power.  In order to spread the wealth into a communal pool, you have to take from those who have worked hard to gain wealth.  You cannot possibly accomplish this task in any other way than through violence and intimidation.  Communism ultimately leads to totalitarianism and oppression of the private citizens.    Freedom comes from empowering the people.  You cannot empower the people by placing all the power in the hands of a communist government.|`|OnWmqs4paa	With communism the theory of all being equal is achieved by bringing everyone down to the lowest common denominator...|`|6B1sxgtOaa	You are right!  When we focus on the rights of a small group of people the right of the whole suffer.  This has been a liberal tactic to take the focus from the rights of the whole to impose restriction on the many.  The country obviously needed to clarify what equal rights were for race and sex, but it has gotten ridiculous.  The Constitution, when applied as intended is the perfect document for freedoms. When chopped up and specialized it becomes a prison, look at our current society.  So I oppose Communism.  I believe in individual freedoms but Communism does not give that.|`|8Kmp90JDaa	"Communism is like Prohibition, it's a good idea but it won't work" - Will Rogers.    "A communist is like a crocodile  when it opens its mouth you cannot tell whether it is trying to smile or preparing to eat you up." - Winston Churchill    So you saw some posters about black rights and women's rights ... how is that wrong? If we didn't focus on those issues in the first place, then those issues never would have been resolved. Equality does not = communism. Equal protection under the law does not = communism. Equality is simply common sense, it's something most civilized societies strive for.    "Not saying it's a better system of government, but a free society that runs efficiently and fairly depends on a body of good people, as opposed to a communistic government which it is forced and equality is the law."    A body of good people includes a body of people who are equally protected by the law. If one group of people is being oppressed, then that is not a free society. Communism doesn't always force equality. Communist leaders may say they believe in equality, but it doesn't mean they really do. In a free society that is not completely controlled by the state, we work towards equality by listening to each other and debating, instead of forcing things on each other.|`|TfXoVfWYaa	lol I know you didn't want it, but I do have to say it - it does look pretty good on paper - everyone is equal, right?    But the real problem is that it doesn't work - there's no incentive for people to work hard, or at all, so the economy collapses. There's also no incentive for innovation or entrepreneurship. On top of that, Communism has been given a REALLY bad name by, for example, Leninism and Stalinism. These autocracies are actually very different from Marx's original Communist vision, in which there was no government at all. The problem with that was that it assumed society would think as a collective body and always think the right thing. Also, it assumed that there would be no need for a government to enforce laws, etc, because everyone would be good and virtuous.    Basically, for Marx to have been right, people would have to be better than they are.|`|ss0vy4tFaa	that's the problem with communism is that it allows no room for opposing views. people will behave like they always do. communism allows tyrannical dictatorships to thrive because it keeps it's subjects locked in eternal poverty that they can't get out from.|`|e3Cho8uLaa	In short, I don't feel it's fair for me to bust my hump to make a better life, and be forced to share my success with someone who simply doesn't care enough to work harder.

Why should I be forced to share my paycheck with someone who'd rather sit at home and watch TV all day, knowing they will get the same thing as me?|`|5JQFCQCkaa	I support the right to be a communist. I was one for a while back, but now I'm a socialist.  Random Fact; Marx was not a Marxist. In "The Communist Manifesto", he clearly stated his doubtfulness of whether the system could ever work.

Every parent on our team volunteered except one.  He said he wasn't about to work this demeaning minimum wage job (lol...we weren't even being paid).

SlhuFfuZaa	Years ago, F.D.R. or some other politician came up with the H.F.A. to help people buy a home. It was a loan system that put the buyer with a financier. They sold millions of homes under the system, and most people were successful in making all of their payments, but, it still wasn't easy. And in the old days, jobs were not a rarity, family was a big thing and there was not the turbulence of big government messing things up as bad.   Sure, government was growing, crime was becoming big business and white collar and there were still a politician or two that worked for the people. You could buy a nice three bedroom house for under $30,000. Today you can't get a cardboard box at the dump for that.

d60812b54bd94ed9b890bbc6003e6400aa	"Mendelian inheritance" has to do with genetics, not civil or criminal law ...    But, it's pretty simple, even for me, so here you go: :)    The Law of Segregation says "when that individual produces gametes, the copies of a gene separate, so that each gamete receives only one copy."  In other words, you get half your genes from your mom and half from your father.    The Law of Independent Assortment states that "alleles of different genes assort independently of one another during gamete formation."  We now know this to be true only for genes that are not linked to each other.  In other words, one characteristic of an organism isn't necessarily linked to any other characteristic.    Hope that helps. :)|`|CYtMRC4eaa	The two Laws listed above are pretty well-defined.|`|MPCKTIvaaa	is what u get from family when sum 1 dies

We are on our way to be the North American Union...slowly our constitutional rights will be voided and claimed "outdated" and we will merge our currency with Canada and Mexico ( the Amero..similar to the Euro) after our dollar collapses.  then our boarders will be removed..ending US Sovereignty.  We will then be under the same UN laws and surveillance as the European, Asian and South Aftican Unions.

Banning something one day can have the result of the banner being banned the next.  That is the result of the banners shortsightedness.

In fact, from a historical perspective, it was written to protect the church more than the state. It also meant that the state would never adopt an official denomination and enforce it.    Liberal groups like the ACLU try to say it fits their mold of "separation of church and state"--a term not even in the constitution!

PnMtlZ0Yaa	I know how to spell "Police."    I like to point my gun at people to intimidate them. I like to use unecessary force at any chance I get.      I know how to victimise the public in order to protect and serve the interest of collecting revenue.     I know how to ignore white collar criminals and I have a nack of focusing on poor people, usually driving older cars in poor condition.    I know I am at less risk if I arrest a drug user than if I go after a dealer, since they may have weapons and resist.     I can tell the difference between a safe gratuity to accept and a sting bribe that will hurt my reputation.     I know to focus on people of ethnic backgrounds, especially the young or the poorly dressed.     I will do what I can to make as many domestic dispute calls I go on result in an arrest, even if there is nothing to justify it.

TuizUTZCaa	The situation would have been better if Australia didn't vote in Kevin Dudd. First Kevin and his nerds should say sorry to the previous government for saying they put Australia in the mess we are in , when in fact it was the world economy in which Australia plays a roll. The previous government would have never blown 10billion dollars, more so on people who don't deserve it. It's about time people in Australia started paying for their choices, not the government. It seems to me that the word labour party actually means recession and poor governing. By the way where is the education revolution.

AA10023092	There is no excuse for him not to call you it breaks several of the rules of professional conduct.    However, that being said sometimes the fight for disability can be very long.  Not only do you wait forever to go through the initial and reconsideration process.  You wait a long time, depending on your locale, for a hearing.  Then once you have a hearing you wait forever for a decision.  I have seen an ALJ sit on a decision for a year before.     Then if you appeal you may wait up to a year to two for the appeals council to move on your case.    If you are 50 and have lupus, a new listing of impairments has come out.  It may be quite a bit easier for you to win a lupus case now.  Furthermore, at age 50 and depending on what kind of work you did in the past, it might be easier for you to get disability as the Grid Rules may be of some help.  But keep in mind if you are claiming you became disabled befor age 50, the more favorable grid rules will not help. Feel free to persue my other answers regarding SSDI/SSI cases.    If you are waiting on a hearing...just wait.  Despite what others say an attorney has limited power in getting the administration to schedule a hearing.  The judge may be trying to let the record get developed more.     Keep in mind also the threshold question may be not only can you do the work you used to do, but is there any other work you can do.  People often think that the inability to do their past work means they are entitled, this is not the case.  However, the older you get the more the inability to perform your past work comes into play in the situation.

Jm3vMKx3aa	At present there are no records of visa rejections available but that is subject to change with the Visa Information System which is planned to be invented in 2009. Presently only persons searched for by warrant of arrest or unwarranted persons are included in the Schengen Information System so that visa hopping may still be able at present. But that loophole is subject to be closed, too. The refusal of a visa does not mean that an applicant may not apply for a visa again. It is often the case that a visa issue is just disapproved because of required documents have not been forwarded. Typical example: required is to provide the original passport and copies of the used passport pages. If the applicant would only provide his passport the application would be rejected because of missing documents. If he would in turn provide the required copies during his next application it might be that a visa would be issued.    _______________________________  Edit - based on additional contribution:    @ AstrayA (or shall I say "xjessie07"?)    The Visa Information System (VIS) was planned to be invented on January 1, 2009. However the implementation has been postponed to March now.    http://www.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/l...  http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/exper...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Inform...    The system  your commercial website is refering to (with broken link) is the Schengen Information System (SIS). The term Schengen visa system is not used at all for a database by official Governments.|`|a66nvk0taa	Submitting your application at another embassy will do no good for you. All Schengen states are connected with so-called Schengen visa system. It is an electronic system used by all the governments to share information about applicants. So, even if you lost your passport and got a new one, they would find out that you have been denied.     Nevertheless, you can file a formal appeal within 3 weeks of the decision. Your best option would be to secure and provide additional information that can prove that they were wrong about the reasons you list.

8X0lmhIQaa	Depends on which European country you are in. For the UK there has to be a vote of no confidence.   Personally, I can't see it happening. Our government has made some massive mistakes but the opposition are no better. All of them are happy to criticise from the relative safety of being in opposition but would be just as useless in the same position.  The current economic situation is a global problem and swapping governments is not going to solve that.  I wouldn't trust the public to make the right descision at the moment either. An election could lead to reactionary voting and we could end up in a bigger mess than before with fringe party nutters gaining to much ground.  Things need to calm down a bit before any descision like that can be made as choices made in anger rarely go well.|`|3uGcqN2Eaa	The government of the day has to lose a confidence vote in the House of Commons to precipitate a General Election.
AA11366224	A General Election must be called by the government within 5 years of the previous one. The writ is moved in both Houses of Parliament.  Either House can move a writ, but it is unlikely to succeed if the government has a majority in the Commons.    The monarch can dissolve parliament and either call a General Election or rule by Privy Council.  She's only likely to do that if she believes that parliament has lost its mandate to govern - not because Rupert Murdoch says so.  This has only happened once in recent history when she sacked Goff Whitlam's government in Australia (which is why she's so unpopular with Australian politicians but popular with the Australian public)    The Government is obliged to resign if it loses a vote of confidence in the Commons.  This doesn't necessarily trigger a general election if someone else is capable of commanding a majority in the house.    The alternative government in waiting is the party that gave us 27% inflation in 1984 and got us thrown out of ERM in 1992.  Their policies are indistinguishable from those of the government party.  Their leader has been described by President Obama as a lightweight (that's American for berk). So why are you in a hurry for a general election?  Would you prefer to be governed by a gang of incompetent Old Etonians rather than a gang of incompetent Scots?|`|Mu7rnIoMaa	UK reply    Unfortunately the decision is in one man's hands - Gormless Gordon Clown.   The only other way is for the opposition to call a vote of no confidence.  If this was lost the Government would be dissolved and an election would be called.      HOWEVER with a largish overall majority Labour will always win a majority as no Labour MP is going to risk his own job by voting against the government - no matter what their constituents tell them to do!      So we are stuck with Gordon Clown until he decides to go to the country, which he has to do by May 2010 at the latest.     Having another 12+ months left he can of course borrow enough money (to try and get out of this mess he helped create) to bankrupt all of us!    Every family in the country now owes 175,000 debt due to Clown's borrowings and incompetence, so our grandchildren will still be paying for his mess!|`|Ft78AcWjaa	If the British had any guts, then a few riots would force the government to hold an election.Like in iceland or Greece.    Alas, the british people are obediant sheep.    We complain amongst ourselves, but never actually act on our feelings.There will  never be a revolution for as long as this is the case.    The government knows this, and wont hold an election until it needs to.    If however the British people got some courage, then political change, and revolution can be achieved.    Unfortunately there are riots between football teams, but never any riots to do with political decisions.|`|gvvHN58eaa	Gordon Brown could hold an election at any time. That unfortunately is the only democratic way we are able to have one. It is up to the public and especially the media to make him believe that what he is doing is barmy and is leading us all into serious debt for a long long time. He will never accept liability as he his an egotistical loser who does not know what to do next. We are all losers now as a result of his decade of incompetence as Chancellor.  Have a nice day

DS2huIAkaa	As far as I know, in order to claim alienation the party that left has to show that there was no contact during the separation period and that on no occasion did the 2 spend even one single night under the same roof (even if it is in 2 separately booked rooms in the same hotel). Any evidence given by a friend that they did spend a night under the same roof sets the time counter to zero and the separation time begins to be measured from that incident onwards. In this way, the party refusing to grant divorce can "engineer" circumstances which appear to break the separation interval and so, re-set the counter to zero, time and again.|`|MPCKTIvaaa	depends on what its for and what reason by law they will decide who can or cant do it and chosse the anout of time dc if any 1 likes my answer just getin my points thats all

This is still in review.    hope it passes into law and becomes wide spread, it's time we wage a REAL war on drugs, not to get the "big fish"     that fails we seen that in the 80s....we starve the big fish by removing the little ones.    this same movement was done with DWI and the numbers have fallen drasticly since the 80s. the price is just too high, people just don't anymore...same for seatbelts...when the price you pay became too high...people wore them.    we can rub out the unwanted drugies the same way    it works!|`|MPCKTIvaaa	why they wont make it legal is cuz they cant tax on it and dealers wont make any money off it both do not want it legalies|`|3oNcHdgCaa	I'll tell you why.  It's because heavy drinkers are usually still able to go to work and get things done, whereas heavy marijuana users tend to become lazy and unreliable. American society has always placed a high moral value on productivity and gives more leeway to drugs that don't interfere with it, regardless of the actual amount of danger they pose to one's health (or how dangerous it can make people, as in the case of violent drunks or drunk drivers). Hence the reason why "conservative" drugs such as alcohol and tobacco have been largely left alone by the government.|`|CiGVGhDZaa	personally, i am not a user, but considering all of the factors, i think that maybe it could be made safer if it were legalized, taxed and monitored.  this would mean that it would be processed by regulated facilities making sure that the product is not laced, it would not significantly affect use among the underage.. if they drink and smoke, they will continue to do what they are doing... i don't necessarily think that any drug, including alcohol is good, but i would much rather have all drugs and alcohol monitored and regulated that poisoned on the black market.

uPNP1xzpaa	in order to work in the U.S., you will require a work permit at least. For you, your company branch in the U.S. will be able to offer you work visa and work permit. However, it is impossible for your husband to work here if he does not have any job offered here..     You may have to wait till you work here for 3-5 years and your company applies green card for you. After you receive your green card, you can then sponsor your husband. Or, try to use your company's people connection to find a company that will offer a decent job to your husband ( i meant a real decent job here to give your husband work visa. ).    t is not difficult for U.K. citizen to find job here in management field, however, it will be the hassles of interviews by flying back and forth.    I used to live in London, I think London is much better than LA. You will get tired of LA after a while and want to go back to London. At least, most of my british friends did already. In addition, You have to drive everyday and compete with all the rude drivers. The public transport in LA is only for poor people and does not go everywhere in the city.

Rick Ramrod: $20k is the average if you are a part time bus boy maybe.|`|d5zEYomEaa	Well, the CEO's are making millions of dollars/year in salary, and they are getting billions of TAX DOLLARS with no rules on how they can spend it (remember CITI credit card company placed orders for multi million dollar private jet planes as soon as they got the 'bailout'). So, one way for them to indirectly pocket the bailout money is to give themselves raises. Where would the raises come from? From the bailout money. Where is the bailout money coming from? From your and my tax dollars. So do you want your tax dollars from the money you work to earn, to go to these billionaires so they can buy more cars and homes? Nobody with a sane mind would be ok with this. It's pretty much robbery by consent which shows how pathetic our country is. At the end of being president for 8 years, in his last 6 weeks in office, Bush gave away over 800 billion in tax dollars to all his buddies who are big fat pigs, with our tax dollars, and nobody seems to mind. I am so pissed at what morons this nation is to let a crook theive us in broad daylight, just because there are lobbyists who pay off politicians to pass laws to hand over our money to their corporations. So a salary cap is the least they can do to stop stealing more and more. If my tax dollars weren't involved, I could care less what their salaries are, but my money could go to better use than to billionaires who can't maybe make their $100,000 monthly mortgage payments because their stock portfolios have taken a dive. They all have tons of homes, didn't McCain admit he had like 20 homes. Big deal, let them hurt a little like the rest of us, let them sell some of their mansions, we've had to go through a foreclosure and are struggling, why doesn't the government bail us out considering it's our tax dollars to begin with and it's life or death for most compared to one less mansion or private jet for them.    If the government has no right to tell them their salaries, then the government has no right to give them money either so they shouldn't ask the government for our money then turn around and say they have no say in how it gets spent. What a bunch of spoiled pigs.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	I dont agree. 500K a year for failure. It should be much, much lower. Like 20k.

And the card check program actually helps to reduce intimidation of workers by management when it comes to a union election, just ask any worker about the union steward if you're new to a job and watch them look around with a scared look in their eyes as they avoid trying to admit that they have any contact with any sort of union where management could hear, or in case you could be a management spy.

The Consultant you see will probably the same as the local hospital as nearly all NHS consultants also have private practices.    Many private hospitals in the UK have NO doctors on duty overnight, only on call. So if you take a turn for the worse after 5pm, just pray that the doctor lives nearby.    If you pay your premiums and are then diagnosed as terminally ill, you will be paid off and shipped back to the NHS.    Stay with the NHS, the best health care system in the world.

I think some individual N.H.S doctors are just not very good but there are a lot of brilliant ones. BUPA is getting more and more expensive and out of a lot of peoples reach. I have been both private and  N.H.S the difference is that private you are able to see a doctor immediately and if need be admitted to hospital right away, private hospitals you have your own room with T.V and D.V.D the nurses knocked before entering and after the operation the doctor comes in and discussed the results, keeping that in mind if anything goes wrong in a private hospital you are transferred to a N.H.S one and with BUPA now you have to see your own doctor first, so if it were me I'd opt for the N.H.S unless it's cosmetic surgery.|`|BiXxJd2Faa	The National Health service was established in 1947 to provide free health care for all, regardless of income.  The NHS ensures that all can get treatment no matter whether they are rich or poor.  It is paid for by our taxes and is still completely free except for dental and eye care and prescriptions, though these are now free if you live in Scotland or Wales. There are other differences now that there are the separate (but connected) in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.    I find in general the NHS is very good, the people working for it being just as skilled and committed as anyone else.  The mistake over your sister's medicine was a mistake and not, hopefully, a usual occurrence. I can identify with some of what you said but have had a lot of good help from the NHS too.  I'd have thought there would be a way to find out if you had a hernia. Maybe you could phone NHS Direct and explain the experience you've had and ask if there is a way to find out once and for all. Even the waiting times are much better now than they used to be.    Private healthcare exists on a much smaller scale in this country.  The treatment is paid for by the individual asking for it, as you probably know.  it's possible to take out health insurance which might cover some or all of the cost if you wanted private care.      It has suffered a huge number of reforms since the eighties, which have been damaging in their frequency (too much change and no time to settle into the changes), and has a tendency to be used as a political football. I have always and probably always will rely on the NHS.  It certainly has it's faults but is still possibly the best and fairest health care system there is.

The only people who deny the holocaust happened are some, not all, Germans.|`|3w7ekDQJaa	I don't have the answer to your question but I know that in Germany it is a criminal offence to say that the Holocaust did not happen.|`|H7QlQOSiaa	It maybe hard to come up with exact numbers, but I'm sure 6 million is a fair estimate. There were other victims of the nazis to. The Russians lost around 25 million.|`|XBvx1FDDaa	Human remains found at the consentration camps is a tlling sign. Even one death in the name of genoside is too many.|`|hQPi5t1Gaa	My father in law saw the gas chambers, the crematories, the camps and the bodies on his tour of duty in WW2.  Good enough for me.|`|zlmnfFpYaa	The Nazis kept very good records.  Those have been exhaustively researched and support the numbers.  There were also many camp survivors who testified during the trials after the war that there were huge numbers of people gassed.  Many of these were actually the workers used by the Nazis to conduct the actual tasks of the process.  And is wasn't just the showers.  The Nazis actually conducted many experiments using different methods to see which was the most efficient, included such lovely things as piping engine exhaust into the railroad cars used to transport the prisoners and ashpyxiating whole carloads at one time.  That turned out to be much more inefficient than the Zykon B route, so that became the method of choice at the big camps.    Anyone who denies the Holocaust happened is a complete and utter idiot.  There has never been a genocide as well documented and confirmed as that one.|`|l0yesNhdaa	Hi There  The book is titled "The Theory and Practise of Hell", I can't remember the name of the author.  The author was a political prisoner who was sent to the concentration camp in 1936.  He kept a diary which was used as evidence at the Nuremberg war trials.  He wrote the book based on his diaries.  It shows the range of people slaughtered at the concentration camps.  Roma, gay, political prisoners and communists were victims along with Jews.  The camps were set up as labour camps.  Those who could not work were exterminated.|`|9iNCQkWlaa	For those soldiers who liberated the camps there's no need of proof of the atrocities. they saw enough for themselves and thankfully some of them lived to tell what they saw.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	Photos of the camps.  Eyewitness accounts of survivors.  Thousand of pages of documentation from the Nazis.  There is no question the holocaust happened|`|WCkOUF9aaa	I think there is a chance the numbers have been exaggerated. I have also found that most people on YA take offense to even the mention of any exaggeration.|`|AA12349988	I suggest you go to Auschwitz and look at the shower blocks.  I think that would give you the evidence that you crave.    BTW - given a choice of starving to death and the quickness of the gas - I would choose the gas as the lesser of two evils.    And numbers 6 would have been to many!!!  But 3 million Jewish Poles in 1939 - 105,000 in 1945.  You do the math.  Yes some came to the UK and the US but not 2.9 million.  Where do you think the rest went?    Edit - Your right I would, I was looking with the benefit of hindsight.  At the moment in time I would fight for life.    But is still does not make either right|`|vddPsXzIaa	I heard that from people who fought WWII - German soldiers, during their advance to Moscow in 1941, everywhere searched for:  1. Jews  2. Communists.  3. Officers    Afterwards they were mostly shot down. So I think the number of Jews murdered was huge as this was a common procedure. The other thing is how modern Jews deal with this giant number of victims. By the way it's one of many proofs of God - Jesus said that all innocent blood since most ancient times would be recovered from Jews for their refusal to believe Him. I think it's Holocaust and its previous rehearsals.|`|u9g2Cl6Eaa	It happened.  People were there.  Some still are alive today.    You come across loads of people who deny things, they deny Elvis is dead and things like that.  Do not be a nutter like them.  Find out more, the link below as links to tales from the survivors.|`|ogzHWAz8aa	The Holocaust happened but how many Jews died is hotly debated|`|848f75b2d80efbaf2e5e5b809911996faa	The Holocaust was an unimaginably horrific spot on the history of human kind and there is no doubt that it happened. It is a bit puzzling though that every year the number of those who were killed increases. It still doesn't take away from its historical accuracy, but shows the power of PR and influence over historical "facts". No investigation would ever be tolerated, in the United States at least, by the very influential Jewish Lobby AIPAC. Anyone questioning anything or asking for any explanations to even the smallest discrepencies, is always labeled antisemetic, ironically even if they're Jewish.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	The SS kept impeccable records of their activities   They have been found in both Berlin and in the Soviet archives  Also, not a single Nuremberg defendant seriously challenged the alleged numbers while they were on trial for their lives    I'm sorry but Holocaust denial is just ridiculous|`|nbn0OXplaa	Good luck trying to find a debate that isn't turned un biased. The problem is that the jews control the media, and the media decides history. Google a video called "one third of the holocaust" there are a lot of facts in here but it is about 3 hours long.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	Try having a conversation with a survivor.      Being the decendent of german jewish immigrant I can tell you the Holocaust happened, the gas chambers were real.  The number that perished will never really be known but does it matter?  Honestly is genocide only horrific if 6 million die?  You know what they say "Those that don't learn from the past are doomed to repeat it."|`|rrSaoOK2aa	yes, witnesses... pictures.... film... criminals.
AA11206283	talk to zoning, the police and the health department.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	You need to go talk to them yourself. Tell them to stop putting their trash on your lawn. Be up front about it. Im pretty srue leagally there isnt much you can do uless you ahve a video tape of them putting trash on your lawn.|`|2a7b3faf6505448786d487a1efedc8aaaa	Call the local housing authority. You can't convert a garage to living space without a permit, and there's probably a law about how many people can live in a house and how many cars can be parked there.    You should also call the local garbage collection agency and let them know that the neighbors are putting garbage in front of your house. They're probably not paying that bill and are using your house.    .|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Call the police up the next time they do it  .  And file a complaint that someone is leaving all kinds of foul smelling trash cans in front of your house  .  The law states that the trash receptacles that are left on the curb for pick up shall be place in front of the home it originates from  .  Other wise people who did not pay their trash bills and got a stop pick up order   .  Could place all their trash in front of someone else's home  .|`|QQsIPlV2aa	I lived in California, and I think there is a limit as to how many trash barrel you are allowed to put out for pick-up.  We had those big green tubs with lids on, we never had more than two at any one time! If you suspect living conditions within that house are bad, you could call the Health Department, and, the cars, are they ALL registered and carry current tags? If they don't that is also a violation, and they can be towed. Call the police if you can prove they are not legal.|`|A7Lh9lICaa	I don't think you should call the police, maybe talking to them would help but then again they may be just a--holes...contact the ppl that come and pickup your trash, they should be under your phone under water or sewer dept. Let them know that these ppl keep leaving their trash in front of your yard, and ask them is there a way you can make it so when they pick up your trash they know whose is whose, b/c in my county we get charged for having trash in/near another neighbors yard, they'll put a sign right in front of our door.
G4TJ8nibaa	Define "alot"!  If you leave for a trip of 6 months duration you have to start your continuous residence again from 0.  If you are outside the US too much you may be deemed "not a resident" and have your green card revoked and you denied entry!  If gone for a year without a re-entry permit you will lose your green card.  If gone for more than 2 years you will lose your green card.|`|cb9c8be6c633186631612c54c6c11d0aaa	please go read rules of USCIS on travel:  International Travel  A Permanent Resident of the United States can travel freely outside of the US. A passport from the country of citizenship is normally all that is needed. To reenter the US a Permanent Resident normally needs to present the green card (Permanent Resident Card, Form I-551) for readmission. A reentry permit is needed for reentry for trips greater than one year but less than two years in duration.  http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/m...      You can find more information about travel documents from "How Do I Get a Travel Document?"|`|JoAfcy4Caa	yes because your claim would become invalid|`|AA11091619	Yes,it will invalidate your claim.|`|4zoN1U3Waa	Yes it does and it depends on how long you stay abroad.|`|21zExylAaa	No it doesn't.  I traveled outside of the USA pending my citizenship and it had no effect whatsoever.  But you will have to keep detailed records of the exact dates you travelled, where you went and why you went.  When you go in for your interview, they will go over all  your travel and you need to make sure everything is accounted for.      As long as your travel was for short durations and you weren't actually living outside the USA or traveling somewhere the US considers unfriendly (see the state dept website for a list of countries) you shouldn't encounter a problem.  I didn't and sometimes I was out of the country for 6 weeks at a time.
DAMZKbpDaa	Thoughts are not illegal.     Be careful how you express them. If it is clear that this is just a desire that one has no inclination of acting on, well, that's bad taste, but not illegal.    If someone says it in such a way that a person believes, is frightened of, takes seriously, the "threats," it could be a number of illegal things, like assault. Saying, for example, "I'm gong to bash your face in," is assault, whether or not one does it.     If it goes to court, the court decides on a "reasonable person" test. If a "reasonable person" could view it as a threat, they could be charged for making it.|`|mOJhj3ssaa	no its not|`|AA11206283	Still no thought crime police.    As long as there is no action or conspiracy, it's just bad taste|`|AA11622716	No.  If the two of you agreed to do those things it could be a conspiracy, but there is no crime that consists solely of voicing thoughts of violence.|`|XoAwzQ5Yaa	It's not a crime to think of criminal activity, but it is if you participate in it.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Some people have all kinds of talk big ideas  .

In most states, he's REQUIRED to carry it.|`|AA11622716	Each state and country has different laws.  I don't know of any states that prohibit carrying a gun in all stores.  Many stores, on the other hand, will prohibit their security folk from going armed.|`|JoAfcy4Caa	i don't think so because it is not licensed in this country he could get done for it. If he is not a cop in this country but in another then he could get done.|`|ulzWumWPaa	You think 'large retail stores' never get robbed?

I was a Deputy Sheriff in Orange County Fl and of course carried a weapon while in uniform and also when in street clothes. Now that officer you speak of is entitled to have his weapon on him when in plain clothes. Also any Law Enforcement Officer can carry his weapon  in any County of the state where he is employed as a officer. Also he may carry his weapon into Church, any building including a Courthouse  and also a school. Or anywhere he wishes too. Look at it this way if you were in a situation where someone was causing you harm. Would it not be nice to have someone with a gun there and knew how to use it.|`|dda37e592e7a473ae883df834ad9805faa	In most states it is legal IF the state has a requirement that all off duty police officers are armed, or if the officer in question has a valid concealed carry permit.      While Bush did sign into law that allows police officers to carry, it is only for retired officers and not those still gainfully employed as a law enforcement officer.    You didn't mention the state, but here is a link that will give you a summary of the gun laws in all 50 states and links to each state's official web site.    http://www.handgunlaw.us/    Check out the laws for your state there.|`|B6c7BeDnaa	yes it is,bush passed a law for the right of police officers to carry anywhere.he did this because of the nyc law that prevented officers from taking their guns home.|`|HtHFHfDKaa	If he has a permit for the gun he has every right which he probably does since he is a cop in another county.|`|U69AYTZIaa	If he has a permit and there are not any signs at the store stating no weapons allowed then it is legal. Check the laws in your area, this will state whether it is legal or not.

Quote  The Banking Panic of 2009  (right after the election, folks)   (Originally posted July, 2008)     The banking panic of 1933  Was the result of the fear after the  US Stock market bubble burst in the fall of 1929  And the ensuing credit crisis  Due to the easy money policy of the Federal Reserve  Throughout the 1920's.     In January of 1933 Herbert Hoover  Was a lame duck republican president   With a democratic controlled congress.      Stock market equity down & a US Credit Crisis.  Five million homes in foreclosure.      Sound Familiar?         The first act of Franklin D. Roosevelt's  As President in 1933 Was to declare  A national "bank holiday" closing all US banks.         The most memorable line from the President's speech   Was directed to the bank crisis    "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."         BUT depositors lost everything  They had in the bank!  Including my grandfather.        YOU ARE HERE 2008     A lame duck republican president,  A Democrat controlled Congress,   Home mortgage bubble burst,   Ensuing credit crisis,   Stock market declines 3000 points   Inflation wipes out gains in personal incomes   Thousands of US Companies bankrupt.      Updated September, 22nd, 2008   Stock market IRA roller coaster.   Bear Stearns Cos. Bankrupt.  Lehman Brothers  Bankrupt.   Merrill Lynch sold, Bankrupt.    Freddie Mac & Fannie Mae bankrupt.  AIG, requires 85 billion dollar bail out.   Foreign-based banks mortgage bailout.     Wild eyed, congress and  Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson  With US Government Check book in hand,  Confirmed that coverage of foreign-based banks  With a Trillion dollar bailout     Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke raised some eyebrows last month when he suggested during congressional testimony that the U.S. Will likely see some banks fail in upcoming months due to increasing write downs and a tightening credit climate.         The Federal Reserve is seeking increased emergency powers to deal with the approaching Banking crisis.         FDIC to hire 140 new employees in an effort to reassure the public they are well-positioned to deal with a possible increase in bank failures over the next year.       A key indicator is the level of bank reserves.   A minimum level of reserves is regarded as necessary to ensure that a bank could meet the withdrawal of deposits, especially during significant withdrawal periods like economic emergencies, downturns, recessions or depressions.         Psst! Have You Heard?         100's of  US Banks are now technically insolvent?         Since last August 2007, the Fed began accepting certain mortgage-backed securities as collateral for repos, thus adding greatly to the perception of value in these securities.      Since mid-December 2007, the Fed has made it possible for banks to bid for reserves against several different assets, including TOXIC mortgage-backed securities.      Mortgage backed securities do not equal cash reserves.    Mortgage backed securities at best are worth 10 to 30 cents on the dollar.       Since February of 2008, as foreclosures increase, banks are stuck with MORE & MORE illiquid proprieties, which are declining in value BUT THE FEDERAL RESERVE LETS THEM COUNT THEM AS FULL CASH RESERVES!!!! That is until NOW, when you pick up the TAB...         Bank RESERVES have been shifted from non-borrowed to borrowed category, which is NEGATIVE.         These banks are on life support, courtesy of your tax dollars.         They BORROW CASH from the FEDERAL RESERVE rather than maintain their own Cash reserves. WHICH HAS TO BE PAID BACK SOON... Now the taxpayer will get the bill.     When you look at the US banking industry in aggregate numbers, there are effectively no genuine cash reserves left for you to withdraw in an emergency.           If the average bank depositor were aware of this,  There would already be huge bank runs in progress.     Every effort is being made to put  "Lipstick on this Pig"  Until after the election,  So you can't throw the bums out.     Do you have sufficient cash reserves  To sustain an economic panic, recession, or depression?     And just what do you think will happen  To the stock market if  Obama and his pals are elected  And take over the Federal Check book?     Next step...  HYPER INFLATION.  unqoute.|`|cXtEx98Haa	Hey, President Bush is gone from office now.  That's what you wanted, that's what you have.

SLSX6QQsaa	Yes, I agree.  You can imagine my frusteration when I worked really hard to clean up my credit and financial mistakes which I made when I was about 18.  Then my ex-friend filed bankruptcy because she bought a house, cars, everything! and could not afford it.  She filed bankruptcy and within 3 months she was getting preapproved credit cards and was able to buy a new car.  Poor me, I had to PAY for a secured credit card, had to have my mom co-sign for my car and now 5 years later I finally have good credit again.  When you seriously take a step back and look at the situation, I was the responsible one who paid off my debts, took responsibility for my mistakes and debts, and did things the right way.  She took the easy road but came out ahead, somehow!    I think the whole system is really messed up.
