Getting my normal haircut from my barber, Brutus. It's usually so boring I fall asleep and he taps me on the back of the neck when he is done to shows me the haircut in a mirror. Anyway, two other customers begin to exchange words. Brutus stopped cutting my hair to calm the situation, as he knew both men. From what I could hear during the yelling, the mens names were Marty and Shawn.     Brutus insisted they stop, as they have been friends too long. Marty and Shawn appeared to reconcile, but then Shawn hit Marty with a kick to the face and soon threw him through the barbershops front plate glass window.     Total mayhem & I was not pleased to witness it. The customer in the waiting area (another acquaintance of mine, Bobby) thought this was funny and stated Marty "jumped through the window to run away from Shawn". At that point, I left, unfinished haircut & all.     Now I wonder if I should have stayed so the police got the correct story. Should I go back to the barbershop today?

This ticket has printed on it a black metallic strip that records the time, and the legend:      “By accepting this ticket the holder is bound by the terms and conditions of the contract.”       Mrs S enters the car-park.   On the first floor she finds a large sign which states the terms of the contract. One of these terms is that any car left after 5 pm. will be charged $50.00 regardless of length of stay.  Mrs Smith does not like this idea and attempts to leave the car-park; there is however a line of cars exiting and her departure is delayed by 10 minutes.  At the pay kiosk the attendant tries to charge Mrs Smith $50.00 for her stay.  Mrs Smith refuses; she claims a contract was not formed.         Could you briefly set out what you would consider Mrs Smith’s legal argument for her claim would be under common law? How would Watson’s Multi-story Car-park attempt to c

One has been in the school since kindergarden and the other is new. In my class there is also a new student who is from Korea. My teachor likes to pick on the student from Korea and the new child. She constantly screams at one (the mentaly challanged child) and she babys the other one. I think that it is because the child from Korea does not have parents in the states, but gaurdiens and the new mently challanged child's parents are not all that focaused. I and many other children in my class think that she is being crule to them, often yelling at them and picking on them. The korean girl barly knows english and she picks on her and the boy. When my class had to do a presentation for the stations of the cross (I go to a catholic school) she had the Korean girl hold pictures and the mentaly challanged boy acalite. I want to know if this is discrimination because I want to stop this because we have this teachor for 2 more years.

The Heritage Foundation estimates the current Bush/Kennedy Senate immigration bill will cost - 2.5 Trillion.      Why won't the Senate provide an estimate? You know it has to cost *something*. If they have a different figure, I'm all ears. If another organization thinks the cost is something else, tell us!      that comes to $8,333 for every man, woman and child in America.      No joke: 2.5 trillion/300 million = 8,333      Now, many in America, such as the illegal aliens themselves, can't afford to pay anything      So, expect a surcharge to make up the difference for each $8,333 you are assessed for each member of your family, if you are able to pay taxes, say $40,000 for a family of four.      do you think that's a fair punishment to your family for other people's breaking of the law?       oh- by the way, that's on TOP of what your family already owes for the national debt, of $117,333 for a family of 4 (not adjusted for those who cant pay at all)      what's another $40,000?

I started work with a large company in the uk in October last year After only one week i partly severed my thumb ( at home d.i.y ) so had to go on sick leave for 12 week`s i then returned back to work but the boss had an attitude with me ( this is because i know the managing director very well ) and he scrutinised every thing i did . after being back at work for 6 weeks i started to have severe pains in my hand`s and after some tests by the doctor`s they decided i need an operation on my carpal tunnel nerve so they put me again on the sick until the operation ( still waiting for the appointment date ) i have today recieved a letter from my employer stating that my employment with them has now been terminated with immediate effect . The sick note they have from me is still valid and will not expire for another 2 week`s . Are they allowed to do this or do i have a case for unfair dismissal ?

What right`s do i have ?  they said i will recieve 1 weeks pay in leu , am i entitled to holiday pay aswell ? what is the best action to take ?  I am in the UK . and i am still waiting for the operation , so technically still should be on sick leave .

Simply because a vote for McCain implies the possibility of having a president (Sarah Palin) who is manifestly unqualified for the post.       On the other hand, I don't think that even those who disagree with them would dispute that Obama and Biden are intellectually up to the challenge of the presidency. Wouldn't it be better to elect an intelligent president, even one with some bad ideas, rather than take the risk of allowing someone like Palin into the oval office?

Das ist eine Benachteilung der M?nner dieser Generation und hat nichts mit Gleichberechtigung zu tun. 50:50 bei der Einstellung wrde da doch mehr Sinn machen. Oder bekommt ein Mann in einem Frauenberuf, wie z.B. als Hebamme einen Job garantiert, nur weil er ein Mann ist und die gleiche Ausbildung hat? - Ich glaube nicht. Was meint ihr zu diesem Thema?

So the roads were icy and I hit a curb and messed up the front of my car so I took it to a local shop for the repairs and they charged me 1000 dollars to fix the control underarm I believe and the driver side of the axle and stuff and when I went to pick up the car they said everything was find with it and that I can take it so I paid the bill and left the shop. This was around 5ish in the afternoon. So I started to drive and about 5 miles or so into my drive the right passenger side wheel just breaks off and the car wouldn't move. I was lucky that this happened while I was in a parking lot and not in the middle of the highway. The shop also worked on my bearing on that side of the wheel. So I had the car towed to their shop and I left it there for repairs now I am just wondering if they say they won't repair it without me paying again is there any course of action I can take towards them? I paid 1000 dollars to fix the car and they said everything was fine and now this happened. Would I be able to sue them or something? because I could have died if this happened somewhere else.          Any help will be appreciated       Thank You :)

20080518164725AAqahc4	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Restri??o a tatuagens estimula solu??es extremas entre candidatos à PM?	Aelson tinha três tatuagens, duas em homenagem aos filhos: uma tomava o antebra?o direito, com o nome de Yasmim; o rosto de Patrick estava desenhado em seu bíceps. No primeiro dia, pensou em desistir do concurso porque n?o teria tempo para apagá-las a laser, a R$ 2.000 cada. Estava inconsolável. No Corpo de Fuzileiros Navais, onde servira, nunca teve problema.      "Disseram que n?o pode aparecer nada, nem com uniforme de educa??o física. Aí n?o dá, vou desistir. N?o posso gastar R$ 6.000 sem saber se vou entrar. As sess?es de laser precisam ter intervalo. O edital é malfeito", reclamou.      Porém, com ataduras e a pele em carne viva, reapareceu no exame psicotécnico. Sorrindo, contou-me que um médico de Caxias cobrara R$ 600 para raspar, com lixa, as tatuagens. Semanas depois, o candidato que o acompanhou ainda tomava antiinflamatórios e antibióticos após raspar duas. "é uma semana sem dormir direito, muita dor." Contou que o ex-fuzileiro fora reprovado no psicotécnico. "Chorou e tudo, ficou 'bolad?o'. O cara apagou a tatuagem dos filhos."      Em carne viva      N?o foi o único. Outro rapaz, com 321 pontos de cirurgia por conta dos desenhos na pele, foi barrado na pesquisa social. Um candidato queimou a tatuagem com um bisturi, deixando um enorme machucado no bra?o direito, envolvido por uma atadura. "Olha só, fiz há uma semana e quase já levanto o bra?o", gabava-se, destapando a ferida aberta.      Na sele??o, muitos tinham os bra?os em carne viva ou ostentavam vultosos quelóides. "Depois melhora?", pergunto. "Que nada! é daqui para pior! Foram quatro sess?es de laser e duas cirurgias. Gastei R$ 2.000. Na segunda, deram mais de 20 anestesias, mas n?o pegava porque foi logo após a primeira e estava muito sensível. Desmaiei de dor na mesa de opera??es. Tirou tanta pele que atingiu o tecido nervoso. Urrava de dor quando ficava arrepiado, lágrima nos olhos. Depois da segunda cirurgia, pensei: 'N?o fa?o mais nada: se n?o entrar, n?o entrei.' Se fizer de novo, perco o bra?o", disse ele, irm?o de PMs.      No exame médico, o sangue escorreu quando removeu a bandagem do bra?o. "O médico perguntou como eu faria o exame físico. Falei que era só ele liberar que eu dava um jeito. Ele liberou."      Depois, o cabo reclamou, para seu desespero. "Tá com cor ainda..." O subtenente, conhecido do irm?o, o defendeu. "Tu é médico? Tu é médico? O cara passou na junta médica e você vai reprovar?", questionou.      Apesar do rigor e do edital, um reprovado no concurso de 2005, por causa de quatro tatuagens, entrou e ficou no meu pelot?o, após decis?o judicial.

20081007154226AAaHVAc	Politics & Government;Politics	Do you know what a socialist is? Do you know what socialism is?	It's all over the media about socialism and Obama beliefs as a socialist.So i looked up the meanings in the Webster's dictionary and i don't know about you but it isn't good.   First a socialist is one who advocates or practices socialism.A member of a party or political group advocating socialism.   Socialism is:(1) any of various economic and political theories advocating collective and distribution of goods.    (2-a)a system of society or group living in which there is no private property.   (2-b)a system or condition of society in which the means of production are owned and controlled by the state.   (3) a stage of society in (marxist theory) transitional between capitalism and communism and distinguished by unequal distribution of goods and pay according to work done.   I have been hearing Obama say thing that a socialist would say.   A socialist believes that through dictatorship every person should have the same amount of wealth. For example if you have a good job that pays good and someone else doesn't have a job then the people making more money would be mandated to give up their own money to people with less.Even if these poor people were lazy and didn't want to work.   Check out the meanings of socialist and socialism in your dictionary.   Barrack Obama  is a socialist. If you don't want the government to have more control of your own money then you should start investigating  Obamas true economic change.A socialist believes it should be one world  a one world government and we should have the same beliefs .He has said that we are one people.He has said we all should be able to come together at the town square speaking one language. These sayings are what a socialist would say and i heard Barrack Obama speak these words myself.Also Barrack is pushing for his proposal The Global Poverty  Act(S.2433) to get passed through the senate.This proposal will show you more about the true Barrack Obama.Go see for yourself.Get more information about this proposal and what it will mandate our nation to have to do.Check out the human events website.

20081011153833AABuKmd	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Why would you WANT too?	 Police at Bathurst make porn arrests   October 11, 2008, 4:34 pm    One man has attacked a police officer with a dildo at the Bathurst 1000 motor racing event while another man has been caught wheeling around a television set showing porn.      And both have been thrown out of the major annual racing event, police say.      A 22-year-old Moss Vale man was arrested shortly after 10pm (AEDT) on Friday after launching himself at a male police officer sitting inside a police car, hitting him on the head with a sex toy.      The officer was not hurt, but the man has been charged with assaulting police.      Earlier in the evening, a 35-year-old St Helens Park man was arrested after police found him wheeling around a television set showing porn.      "The man had been walking his trolley around a park campsite displaying the material," a police statement said.      A search of the man's tent revealed more than 20 pornographic DVDs.      The man and his trolley were taken to a police station on Mount Panorama where he was charged with displaying pornographic material.      "Camping on the mountain are families with young children and for someone to deliberately walk around displaying pornographic material is completely unacceptable," Assistant Commissioner Lee Shearer said.      Both men have been issued with banning notices and are prohibited from returning to the Mount Panorama racing precinct for the remainder of the weekend's event.      They have been bailed to appear at Bathurst Local Court on November 10.

20081104121557AAPZ5VA	Politics & Government;Elections	Muslim tolerance and Obama?	With the election, I thought I would ask a topical question to you guys across the pond.    Over the past couple of days there have been a number of quotes in the media from people living in southern states of the USA and all seem to support the view that Obama is a dangerous Muslim.    I was really disturbed listening to the radio today, some American man (from the south) was asked how he would vote and he said he would never vote for Obama because he is convinced that he is a Muslim. His whole logic behind it was that Obama's middle name is 'Hussein' and his name even sounds like Osama and that therefore makes him a Muslim.      Obama has said countless times that he is Christian so is it just because of his name and colour that some people assume he is Muslim? Are some people in America really that close minded? Also, why would it matter if he was a Muslim? Do Americans still assume that all Muslims are terrorists? Can they not see that the 'Muslim' nutters who chant death to the west are not the spokespeople for the real Muslim people who are decent, good natured and peaceful?      I am white, English and of no religion. I went to a high school populated 90% by Muslims so I have a lot of knowledge about Islam (good and bad) and I have a lot of respect and admiration for Muslims. Anyone who uses their answer to voice their brain washed ignorance by being racist or derogatory about Islam will be reported. Thanks :)      Sorry to repost, but my other question was chopped a bit.

Ok I'm definitely committed to enlisting in either the Navy or Air Force.  However I have a definite phobia pertaining to the use of needles to draw blood.  Even saying or typing the words "drawing blood" makes my palms sweaty.  I feel like I can withstand getting shots (even though there will be several at the 2nd MEPS), but the thought of needles going into my veins just wigs me out.  It's all related to my 2 week stint in the hospital when I was 4 years old and the amount of times they took blood while I was there.  By the end my arms were bruised so every puncture hurt even worse.  Anyways, I don't want this phobia to keep me from what I feel I would be good at, military life.  I know the typical suggestions of "turn your head, think of other things, etc." but I had one other specific question.  Does the military allow the use of a numbing cream if I am not able to overcome my phobia before I arrive for MEPS?  It seems like the weakest way out and definitely not the route I want to take, but if it allows me to serve in our armed forces I would go through the unending ridicule certain to come my way from my fellow recruits to make it.  Anyways just shoot me some ideas and thanks a lot for reading this entirely too-long question.

It amazes me that every time Sadam opens his stinky pie hole in court the proceedings are interrupted and suspended. If this were a criminal case against any US citizen, contempt of court would be added to the charges. It's taken years to get anywhere near convicting him. How convenient for Republicans that they are nearing completion of the trial so close to elections. It's almost as fishy as finding a billionaire in a fox hole on the same day the Halliburtan scandal made news.

My witnesses are a psychologist who vouches for the bullying, a scientitist who says the bomb was poorly constructed, and a friend who says the defendent would never do such a thing and hints at the bully's history of setting up people.      The evidence is the chemicals found at my client's house (commonly used chemicals) and the fact that no fingerprints were found on the bomb.

O imposto de renda, por exemplo, é um imposto cobrado por vários países, onde cada pessoa ou empresa é obrigada a deduzir uma dada percentagem de sua renda média anual para o governo. Esta percentagem pode variar de acordo com a renda média anual, ou pode ser fixa em uma dada percentagem.      Mas o povo padecente, empresas e pessoas físicas est?o sofrendo uma carga tributária elevadíssima, a maior do mundo se medida em fun??o da finalidade dos impostos e contribui??es, que é a convers?o dos tributos arrecadados em obras e servi?os públicos.
