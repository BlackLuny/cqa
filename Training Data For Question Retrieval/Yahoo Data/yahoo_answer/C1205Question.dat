20090202211146AAPtLoS	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Contrapositve and Converse?	Is an "only if" statement different from an "if, then" statement?   I need to find contrapositve and converse statements but I'm having trouble since it is worded in "only if" terms instead of "if, then"      Consider the statement, "I am old only if I am over 60."       Would "I am over 60" be P and "I am old" be Q for (P->Q) or do I have the two letters reversed?      This would make the "if, then" statement, " If I am over 60, then I am old"      I believe the contrapositive is: "If I am not old, then I am not over 60"   converse: "If I am old, then I am over 60"
