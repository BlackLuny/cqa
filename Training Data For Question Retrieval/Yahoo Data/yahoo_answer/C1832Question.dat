20090203100109AAx9fEF	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	MAJOR COMPUTER SITUATION, IN NEED OF A PRO!!!?	In only a move my dumb-self could perform, I took a one minute video of my girlfriend on my camera.  I only have my work computer, so I put it on the work computer, to then compress it and email it to myself for a later day...      The dilemma is that, the video is somehow stuck on my computer!  I will get into some serious trouble for doing anything non-work related to my PC.  For some reason, every time I go to try to 'delete' the file, it says that it cannot delete the file, because it is open on another program...IT IS NOT OPEN ON ANY OTHER PROGRAM AS FAR AS I KNOW!      I have done a search and only one file with that name comes up...I go to delete that and it says I cant cause its open in another file...WHERE IS THIS OTHER MYSTERIOUS FILE?!?!? There is none!  Please help me, this is my job and future in this horrible economical time...the video isnt even of anything 'bad' but it has to come off! And no its not just a simple 'delete it or send it to the recycle' there has got to be some other way...other than droppin my computer into the bathtub, so that no one will have the ability to get anything out of it ever!

And the best the teachers have is contact tech support.And it doesn't help that my idiot principal adds class after class so that everyone is inside all day doing class never getting a break.We are only in 7th grade we need freedom.

For some reason unknown to me, my computer has now decided to no longer save pictures and this is a nuisance to me, being an artist who frequently uses computer programs. I have tried saving images in both Paint.NET and MSPaint to no avail. When I attempt to save they both instantaneously exit out. The same applies to when I try to right click -> "save as" images via Firefox, the browser just immediately closes. This is quite bothersome and I would very much like some information that may help me in resolving this problem. Thank you very much.      Since I believe being specific is always good, I think it may be of some importance to mention that saving word documents works perfectly fine.      Once again, thank you.

Normally I use Internet Explorer but I've wanted to switch to firefox for quite awhile now but I can't get it to load on my computer for some reason. I've tried installing it twice but when I launch it nothing happens. I've tried safari and the same thing happens so is there something like blocking other browsers? The only thing I thought of was maybe my Norton Internet Security was blocking it somehow but I can't find anything in the settings about anything like that. Please help if you can. Thanks!
20090219183834AApzl5q	Computers & Internet;Software	Is there any free non-file sharing music downloading softwares?	I've decided to stay away from Limewire and all of those   Because I saw an article in the paper and heard from a teacher that people are encoding files on limewire and when you download it, they get your IP address and send something to your ISP provider and they will send you a letter saying there going to sue you for 250,000 dollars unless you remove the file   It happened to my teacher   So, I need a non-file sharing music software   No iTunes, cause it costs, and my dad doesn't want to pay   AND   No BitTorrent or whatever

20090219184234AAjh7ZC	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Visual basic users please help?	ok, so i have just started to make a program using visual basic. in the long run, it's gonna play Hi-Lo to help me with card counting (science project), but never mind that. i have already hit a snag. see, i want to be able to click a deck of card's front to make the next card in the deck appear in the discard pile face-up. this is my current code:         'suit order is spades, clubs, hearts, diamonds   'discard pile: top = 480, left = 2520      Private Sub Form_Load()   imgCard(Index).Top = Top   imgCard(Index).Left = Left   End Sub      Private Sub imgRndCard_Click()   Do   imgCard(random).Top = 480 AND imgCard.Left = 2520   Loop   End Sub         the part under imgRndCard doesn't work, though. it makes the program like crash or something - the card goes white and then it does nothing so i have to "end now".      this is what i've already tried:      - i've tried to do it w/out the "do...loop", but then it only does one card when i click on the deck, and then when i click on the deck again nothing happens      - i've tried what i have now except with   Private Sub imgRndCard_Click()   Do   imgCard(random).Top = 480   imgCard(random).Left = 2520   Loop   End Sub   but that made the program crash like it does now      - i tried what i have now thinking, well, the program probably didn't work last time cause it thinks i am trying to move two cards or something, but it had the same result as last one.         idk what to do now can anyone help?

I have a problem:      System specs:   Asus P5K v 4.04   Corair 1Gb x 4   Nvidia 8600 GTS   WD 250 GB HD x2   Intel 6550 @ 2.66       I recently had a system shut down after a longer gaming session. When I tried to reboot nothing would happen besides a brief blip of LED's. Thought it was my PSU due to the obvious noise the fan was making prior to shut down. Replaced the unit with  corsair 650 watt, to little avail.  Then stripped my rig down to one stick of memory and gradually, anfter installin ght eold system piece by piece, found out it was my recently installed 8800 GTS.  So I swapped it for the older, but functional 8600 GTS.  This time I got the system to run...but got nothing on screen, no beep codes indicating a VGA or a lack there of either.   I've tried CLRTC and nothing happens.  I even tried starting it without my battery, and nothing.  Any help would be appreciated.      Thanks,   Avry

20090219184256AAMmiBc	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	I need a HUGE coding favor please (good for a very bored coder)!!?	I need a program made for me if anybody is willing (or bored on a Sunday afternoon, etc.), please.      I need a program that has two options. The first will run as many pings on a specified host as the program can handle at once, until the program is told to stop.      The other option is to request a file from a website as many times as it can handle at once, until told to stop. It shouldn't display the resource it’s requesting, just issue requests to the server.       It would be very good (but not a requirement) if it were to display the average response time from the server in both instances. It's alright if this needs to be command line based, but it would be exceptional if it was a GUI. It would be awesome if I could have the source code, regardless of the language you programmed it in. It needs to be used on a Windows XP/Vista Platform      I know this sounds like a DoS tool, but will only be used for stress tests for my internal network (I already have performance monitoring tools; I just need this kind of program).      Thank you very, very much in advance!!!      I will give you full credit and commend you and this program to my friends in some high IT places at Google, Cisco, and HP.         If you have any questions, email at phptest@gmail.com.

Here's my code...      $(function(){    var i = 1;    for (i = 1; i <= 30; i++)       var dialog_aug = "#dialog".i;     var dialog_link_aug = "#dialog_link".i;     $(dialog_aug).dialog({ // Dialog      autoOpen: false,      width: 500,     });     $(dialog_link_aug).click(function(){ // Dialog Link      $(dialog_aug).dialog('open');      return false;     });    }   });      As you can see, i'm trying to increment the DOM id references, but I haven't gotten it to work yet.      My working theory is that all I need to do is concatenate the word dialog with the increment variable, but I'm not sure how to make it work.      PS I don't want an answer on how to concatenate strings if it doesn't solve my problem.      Thanks very much!

20090219190013AApGvdJ	Computers & Internet;Security	Do I need a security program in addition to that which is included in Vista Home Premium?	I just got a new Dell desktop with Windows Vista Home Premium, which seems to include a pretty extensive internet security system. I had always used (and renewed) my Norton Security Suite, on my old computer, but they tell me it's not compatable with Vista and I'll have to re-purchase the latest version, in order for it to work.      My service provider -- Comcast -- offers McAfee for free as part of their service, but I don't want to bog down my performance with unnecessary security software.  Can I rely on the Vista security system?  Should I get an additional security program?  Or should I turn off the Vista security in favor of McAfee or Norton or something else?      My new computer is about 5 times as powerful as my old machine, but it's already about five times slower (which is another issue I need to address).  Any insight would be helpful.        There aren't many things more irritating than being trapped on a non-stop, phone-service carousel with Dell, Microsoft, Comcast and Norton, etc.  I can already see why people dislike Vista and why Microsoft is basically forcing it on their PC partners.

20090219211721AAhBsnT	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Computer Has No Video and Shuts Down after a minute and a half.?	I've run into some problems fixing my girlfriends computer. One day she was playing a game and it just shut off on it. I've had some A+       training and plenty of experience with computers, so I've been trying to fix it. Originally, I thought it was the power supply or an       overheating problem. I let the computer cool down and tried to turn it on again. It didn't power up. So I tested the powersupply with       my own computer which is good. It tested good, so I assumed it was the motherboard or the RAM. But the RAM worked in my computer, so we       bought a new motherboard. Well, I installed the new motherboard just to discover the powersupply was doing the same thing with it that       it was the old one. Wouldn't power up. So I frustatedly pulled the power supply and had it professionally tested. It was bad. So I       bought a used powersupply which I made sure was good, then came home and put it into the new motherboard. I got everything in nice and       well, and it seemed to be working, except for the video. I made sure everything was in the right place and seated, and that my monitor       was plugged in and had power, but there was still no video or beep codes. I even tried putting one of my own videocards in the       motherboard. Still no go. I decided to try everything with the older motherboard since it turned out to be the powersupply. Everything       worked, for about 30 minutes. While I was trying to uninstall a program that was malfunctioning, the computer just flat out shut down       again. It turns back on for about 2 minutes at a time, but there is no video or beep codes, and then it just shuts off again.       Everything is seated properly, everything has power. Then, while we were sitting there eating dinner and trying to figure out what to       do, we both smelled burning electronics. I unplugged the computer as quickly as possible and inspected everything as best I could, but       I couldn't find the source of the burning smell. I haven't plugged it back in as of this moment, and I've hit a dead end. If anyone has       any ideas that could help me, I'de appreciate it. Thanks!

Ok so I have a Toshiba Satellite A215-S7422 and for a few months its been having issues where it seems to just turn the computer off at any random time (as if I pressed and held the power button.). I researched online a little bit and learned that the issue could be due to an outdated BIOS.      - Here's the problem, I went and downloaded the BIOS update from Toshiba and it was fine until it crashed again (as if I again pressed and held the power button) , however it crashed while it was flashing(installing) the new BIOS software.       -My computer as of right now: is.... Not turning on too the [Press F2 to BIOS Settings or DEL for Boot Menu] screen. In fact whenever I even put the battery in the computer(without pressing the start button) it appears as if I just turned the computer on and does all the same things except it doesn't show the BIOS boot screen.      Please help me with this if you can, my warrenty expired a few months ago and I dont know where to turn.

There wasn't one in the box, and I tried a few of the USB cords I found lying around the house, but none of them fit. Is there a specific USB cord I need? Its a Canon printer by the way.

20090219194048AAGe34k	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Help for the technologically challenged?	I am looking to buy either a laptop or a notebook for the sole purpose of using it as a word processor. I do not know much about computers, so forgive me if these questions sound elementary.   1-How many KB's does it take to make up a G? I see most notebooks have a G of memory. I would be using this to type out and store my novel. I am half way through and the document is currently 584 KB's. Do I need more memory than 1 G?   2- Are notebooks easy to type on? They look quite small, and seeing as how this would be my primary function, I would not want to be uncomfortable typing out thousands of words.   3-The Acer seems to be the cheapest brand. Is it junk, or would it serve its purpose as a word processor?   4-And are all computers automatically equipped with Microsoft Word, or is this a program I would have to purchase and install myself? (No small feat for the computer illiterate.)   Thanks for any help you can offer!

20090203103557AACoaWw	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	MUX, DEMUX and NAND Gates?	Those familiar with logic circuits will probably know that NAND gates, being primitive, can be used to make just about any circuit if you break it down enough (in fact, I'm quite sure they can be made into ANY circuit at all). This would include MUX and DeMUX, but my question is a bit backwards. I need to know how to construct a NAND gate (with 2 inputs) using a 2 to 1 MUX, a 4 to 1 MUX and two 1 to 2 DEMUX. I've scoured the internet but I can't find any concrete examples. I need to know the actual implimentation, so I need to know what gates are used in the MUXs and DEMUXs, not just the trapezoid symbol.      Thanks in advance!

I will off for a while because i have other homework need to do.      For questions 1-4, assume values is an int array that is currently filled to capacity, with the following values:   --------------------------------------...   |     9     |     4     |     12     |     2     |     6     |     8     |     18     |   --------------------------------------...            1) What is returned by values[3]?   a) 9   b) 12   c) 2   d) 6   e) 3      2) What is the value of values.length?   a) 0   b) 5   c) 6   d) 7   e) 18      3) Which of the following loops would adequately add 1 to each element stored in values?   a) for (j=1; j<values.length; j++)  values[j]++;   b) for (j=0; j<values.length; j++)  values[j]++;   c) for (j=0; j<=values.length; j++)  values[j]++;   d) for (j=0; j<values.length–1; j++) values[j]++;   e) for (j=1; j<values.length–1; j++)  values[j]++;      4) The statement System.out.println(values[7]); will   a) output 7   b) output 18   c) output nothing   d) cause an ArrayOutOfBoundsException to be thrown   e) cause a syntax error      5) Which of the following is a legal way to declare and instantiate an array of 10 Strings?   a) String s = new String(10);   b) String[10] s = new String;   c) String[ ] s = new String[10];   d) String s = new String[10];   e) String[ ] s = new String;      6) In Java, arrays are   a) primitive data types   b) objects   c) interfaces   d) primitive data types if the type stored in the array is a primitive data type and objects if the type stored in the array is an object   e) Strings      7) The “off-by-one” error associated with arrays arises because   a) the first array index is 0 and programmers may start at index 1, or may use a loop that goes one index too far   b) the last array index is at length + 1 and loops may only iterate to length, missing one   c) the last array element ends at length – 1 and loops may go one too far   d) programmers write a loop that goes from 0 to length – 1 whereas the array actually goes from 1 to length   e) none of the above, the “off-by-one” error has nothing to do with arrays      8) What does the following code do?  Assume list is an array of int values, temp is some previously initialized int value, and c is an int initialized to 0.   for (int j = 0; j < list.length; j++)    if (list[j] < temp) c++;   a) It finds the smallest value and stores it in temp   b) It finds the largest value and stores it in temp   c) It counts the number of elements equal to the smallest value in list   d) It counts the number of elements in list that are less than temp   e) It sorts the values in list to be in ascending order      An int array stores the following values.  Use the array to answer questions 9 – 12.   --------------------------------------...   |     9     |     4     |     12     |     2     |     6     |     8     |     18     |   --------------------------------------...   9) Which of the following lists of numbers would accurately show the array after the first pass through the Selection Sort algorithm?   a) 9, 4, 12, 2, 6, 8, 18   b) 4, 9, 12, 2, 6, 8, 18   c) 2, 4, 12, 9, 6, 8, 18   d) 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18   e) 2, 4, 9, 12, 6, 8, 18      10) Which of the following lists of numbers would accurately show the array after the second pass of the Selection Sort algorithm?   a) 9, 4, 12, 2, 6, 8, 18   b) 2, 4, 9, 6, 12, 8, 18   c) 2, 4, 12, 9, 6, 8, 18   d) 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18   e) 2, 4, 12, 6, 8, 9, 18      11) Which of the following lists of numbers would accurately show the array after the fourth pass of the Selection Sort algorithm?   a) 9, 4, 12, 2, 6, 8, 18   b) 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 8, 18   c) 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18   d) 2, 4, 6, 9, 8, 12, 18   e) 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 9, 18      12) How many passes will it take in all for Selection Sort to sort this array?   a) 2   b) 4   c) 5   d) 6   e) 7      For questions 13 – 15, assume an int array, candy, stores the number of candy bars sold by a group of children where candy[j] is the number of candy bars sold by child j.  Assume there are 12 children in all.      13)   What does the following code do?   Scanner scan = Scanner.create(System.in);   int value1 = scan.nextInt( );   int value2 = scan.nextInt( );   bars[value1] += value2;   a) adds 1 to the number of bars sold by child value1 and child value2   b) adds 1 to the number of bars sold by child value1   c) adds value1 to the number of bars sold by child value2   d) adds value2 to the number of bars sold by child value1   e) inputs a new value for the number of bars sold by both child value1 and child value2      14)  Which of the following code could be used to compute th

20090219202257AAy6njh	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	My computer won't boot up.  Problem with boot order?	My computer wouldn't boot up.  It kept displaying a message something like "Reboot and select proper boot device or insert boot media in selected boot drive".  After googling the error message, I decided that it was a problem with the boot order.  I followed a guide on how to change the boot order, and I followed it until I got to the actual boot order itself.  Where the example in the guide listed things like Removable Device, CD-ROM Drive, Hard Drive, etc. to boot from, my computer only had Removable Device.  Is it possible that some of my things could have been deleted or disconnected or removed from the list or whatever so that it no longer appears as an option, or something like that?  Does anyone know how to solve this problem?

20090219201725AAgoKDv	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Foxconn Motherboard Question?	A while back i bought a foxconn motherboard and cpu combo for my PC.  It had An LGA775 P4 At 3.4Ghz that was installed when i got it heat-sink already attached. the board would whole fine for about 5 Min's and than the power and hard drive lights would go off and the whole thing would freeze and the power and reset buttons would also not work. this would also happen in the bios also so i knew it wasn't software related. to turn it off you had to unplug it which was annoying. the board was handled with ESD procedures the whole time,  i tried 4-5 sticks of ram, none of which solved the problem, 2 PSU's 4 Graphics cards ATI and NVIDIA 2 HDD's and it still wouldn't work. i never removed the heat-sink, thinking that it would void my warranty. what was wrong with the board, i knew it wasn't overheating, so what went wrong?  I returned the board but what was wrong with it?

20090219194743AAzhNdW	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Does my laptop have an expansion card slot?	Hey, i need to do some serious editing and have purchased an external hard drive that runs on firewire, which is the same as my dv cam. so instead of using my computer as a halfway home and then plugging in the hard drive, and coping the data to there, i was thinking about getting a belkin firewire expansion card to plug in instead. Its just a standard HP laptop with all the gimmicky trimmings that come with them. However, on the side of the laptop, there is a remote holding slot, and there is a gold connector in the back of the slot, which the remote doesn't use, so my question is is that my expansion card slot?      It has an image of a rectangle with 3 lines on the left side of it.

20090219202955AAv5qVR	Computers & Internet;Internet;Facebook	Facebook etiquette??	Alright, I normally accept friend requests, but this time it is a bit different... My mother was married to this one guy from 93-2001 (they divorced when I was 16) and it was probably the worse divorce I have ever heard of, moving on I have not kept up with him or his family at all, however my former cousin (step father's nephew) sent me a friend request and I do not want to accept it and so I just ignored it until I could figure out what to do... he sends me a message saying, "hey u must never get on! i sent this to you a week ago! Its cool! but anyway whats up? where you at now?" what should I do, he was relatively young when my mom and his uncle divorced, probably 10 or 11, i think he is now about 16 or 17.

20090219204949AAHSgMn	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	How to add to existing file c++?	I understand that there is the flag ios::app that can help me add data to a file without erasing existing information. The problem I have is that when I try to add the flag when I open an existing file, an error occurs and the file is unable to be read. I need the file to input/output as well as stay open until a decision from a menu is made, so it cant close until I write or read from it. Here is what I have:      inventory.open("file.dat", ios::in | ios::out | ios::binary);      when I add in the ios::app so its like this....      inventory.open("file.dat",ios::in | ios::out | ios::app | ios::binary);      the file fails to open. Any idea whats going on? I figured out that it can work when I take out ios::in, but dont I need that to read data from a file? Please I need lots of help on this. When I try to remove ios::app from the function, it results in a infinite loop when I try to read from the file.
20090219205034AAeaFUB	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Please share your opinions on which Intel Processor I should get!?	Hi everyone,   (I posted this a few days ago but I'd really like to hear some more opinions).      I was going to upgrade my computer to a Q9550 but decided not to because it was outdated even when I was considering it. Now I don't know whether to upgrade to the i7 920 (Nehalem) or wait for the die shrink (Westmere) which comes out later this year?      My computer right now is an old P4 with integrated graphics. It's so bad I am desperate for a new one. I think I can wait for Westmere though because I've heard it will be quite good.      Should I??      Also, does anyone have any idea how much westmere will cost (More than the i7???). I suppose if I wait I will get the Westmere equivalent to the i7 920. ($500 is Australian dollars ~ $330 US Dollars). Will the performance of an i7 920 beat that of a low spec Westmere in my price range?      I will be building the computer from the ground up, no parts will be carried over.      Thanks.
