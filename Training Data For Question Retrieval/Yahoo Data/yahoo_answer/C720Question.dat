This was a problem when I'd fry them in oil in a pot on the stovetop, the oil would explode sometimes and I'd get fire -- fortunately, I never burned my kitchen down.  Then, I got a fry daddy deep frier.  That is somewhat better, when it explodes the oil goes on my counter, but it still does not seem safe.  And I am most certainly not overheating the fry daddy, it has only one temperature and claims it is the right one.  The manual does say to "use care" when making hush puppies ... it's like what the heck?  So what do I do to make hush puppies but do it more safely?

20090202151623AAROe1S	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	PETA, I have a bone to pick with you. (Animal testing in labs?!)?	Now, I just watched a video from PETA about animal testing in laboratories for drugs/tests/experiments etc. I am a severe asthmatic, and I am -certainly- against animal testing because I know that there have to be/should be other alternatives out there, but I -still- use the same drugs I always do; (Symbicort, Proventil, Pro-Air, and the occasional nebulizer treatment with albuterol...) PETA acts as if animal testing is such a -bad- thing, even though apparently one of the heads of PETA is a diabetic who relies on insulin. How messed up is that?       What are your thoughts on animal testing?   What are your thoughts on what I think about this?

20090202164324AA7bTCN	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Something I've often wondered about bacon...?	Ok, they say cooking bacon in the microwave or oven is better for you than cooking it in a pan on the stove.        Here is my question:      How exactly is it less fattening to cook it in the oven or microwave than on the stove?  It stands to reason that when you cook it on the stove and all the oil comes out into the pan it would be less fattening than when it's cooked in the oven.  I mean, that fatty stuff is still inside, right?  Shouldn't it be more fattening like that?        I know it feels and tastes less greesy when cooked in the oven... I just wonder why exactly that is...      ;)
