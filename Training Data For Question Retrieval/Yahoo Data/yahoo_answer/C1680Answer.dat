nW3iJkT5aa	I`m sorry but being English I am unable to interpret your gibberish  What on earth are you talking about
H8MGismEaa	As far as we know it is the killer mom Casey's lawyer stopping the baby Caylee's funeral , with tricks and stunts designed to gum up the proceedings that all point to the guilt of his client, Casey Anthony . That diabolical Casey is still being allowed to harm her daughter's being laid to rest .               The jewelry incident is most likely in keeping with gestures that loved ones decide to do for their beloved departed , when there isn't much you can do to send them off, when their body has been destroyed such as Casey did to Caylee . It must have hurt George  and pushed him over the edge , after all the trauma inflicted by his daughter.I HOPE George comes out of the hosp healthy and in full control , and that he can put that child to rest and tells Casey & Jose Baez to jump off a short pier.|`|jZ03Zdjdaa	I suspect that Cindy is in charge of Caylee's funeral service/burial, and that she's waiting until George is psychologically strong enough to handle attending.|`|nxrEuJsRaa	I guess they have still been running tests and making sure they have all the evidence for a trial.    Poor little Caylee. Rest In Peace.
LzPhdri5aa	The Constitution requires them.    And Tax cheating is a crime, its just not a crime that bars you from office or puts you in jail.    And in case there is any doubt, I'd be willing to bet that 90 out of 100 of those senators have all cheated on their taxes.    They are politicians after all.
EBqFpZbjaa	News to me, but you never know with the Stories - always look nice in opposition, but beat the Hell out of the people once elected.    Next election due in 2010 - think before pencil etc.    Hmmm - shall I vote Monster Raving Looney like last time?  They've got plans to lower the voting age to 16.  Or is it raise the age of consent to 29, or something?  I know there's something about pubs not being allowed to sell beer under 6% of alc or something.  Oh yes, there's also the plan for free rail travel to the seaside for anyone with a signed photo of the party leader.  Just show up at any station and demand a ticket.    Might get a bunch of fives.|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	I thought they invented the idea of stealth taxes.

No, sorry I'm in cloud cuckoo land.|`|JhC6BvPpaa	I didn't know that any gold had been found in the Channel, but if it's only one billion dollars worth, it'll be a 'drop in the ocean'..... hahahaha 'a drop in the ocean' - get it?

He should have checked this site out first and got a good deal.    http://www.goldprice.org/gold-price.html    As you can see the gold price fell a bit - but we're talking pennies.  It will probably go up again as more folk buy gold as a hedge against the bad times ahead.    Whatever you do, do not bury your gold in a box in your garden.  This is exactly what Samuel Pepyes did in 1666 when the Great Fire of London was raging out of control.  After burying three 'chests' of gold in his garden, [Shoreditch] he then headed for Bethnal Green which back then was outside the city.    He and his family returned a few days later but could only find two chests of gold.    Moral of this story, dig up your neighbour's garden and have his gold.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	He'll give it to India like he did with the last 800M.|`|Fm5YsQnfaa	Gordon Brown it too tight to sell some thing for less than it is worth
94618fa9aff7c44a9bbefcc52d8a7de7aa	What will happen is that the U.S. will fall apart and all the world will be shocked to death.   The best you can do for yourself is to start shopping for quality clothes in a second hand shop now. Do this for as long as your funds will allow it. Build a vegetable garden out of your yard and learn to cook.   Learn to cook big meals that will stick to your ribs and have some left over for the next day. Get used to four or five small meals a day and prepare for the worst but hope and expect the best.   2009 is going to be tougher than 2008 and many people have suffered greatly last year. It is going to get worse before it gets better. All the best to you darlin.|`|6FpUuLknaa	It's impossible for everyone to be on unemployment.  Who's gonna pay for it?

And he can remember his father having to go work on a line for .75 per day! Of course, he always tells how the banks closed in one day, and my grandmother lost her money that she had just put in the bank the night before. There were alot of people committing suicide, jumping off buildings and bridges and shooting themselves because of losing everything they had. They had to go on unemployment or welfare just to get by.|`|7b0903c0e39a55a5230350128e4fcff1aa	Theres not much anyone can do.

Fm5YsQnfaa	You do not keep a cat. It adopts you. If you are lucky, it will rid you of vermin.     People who used to have cats did not feed them, they just offered them affection and warmth.     You run the risk of them killing birds and other small mammals you may want to keep but you will also get rid of vermin. The trick is not to give them food. If you already feed your cat then you have taught it not to seek out it's own food.    Set traps or lay out poison. That may mean your cat will eat it and die so take care.|`|3arJsZ91aa	Not feeding your cat is unfair.  Have you been playing chase and catch games with your cat?  A feather on the end of a piece of string pulled around will encourage it to 'hunt'.  My cat (as far as I'm aware) has caught one mouse on a glue trap (already dead!), eaten one, left one for me and I have saved about 5.  This is over a period of about a year, so not enough to keep her tummy full.  Some cats just aren't good hunters.|`|1bd6f7dcd94b559f97fdb31387c7926faa	Don't feed it any cat food.

AA11015890	Utter arrogance!  How are people supposed to do that??  Uproot their families for a strange country with a foreign language in the hope of finding a decent future, or abandon them and disappear for heaven only knows how long to seek work?    For a Government which is supposed to be dictating to us on the importance of family, to suggest causing so much upset and upheaval within hundreds of British families - in order to provide jobs for overseas workers coming here - is hugely insulting and hardly family-friendly!|`|jipqICzVaa	Because Gorgon has given all our jobs to the EU.

And of course, when the Pole / Latvian / Romanian or whomever returns home, he is completely unaccountable for his actions of 'manslaughter' - unlike a British worker. Cheap foreign labour will just keep flooding the market and it will undercut everyone and FORCE people to go and work abroad like slaves. Brown nose Mason and the 'New World Order'..... Exactly what he wants all the cattle to be, his slaves.|`|i405qKokaa	They shouldn't have to seek work abroad. One thing though...I found work abroad and I no longer have to:    *Work an 83-90 hour week just to pay my rent.  *Pay exorbitant taxes and see nothing in return.  *Risk coming home to find that my house/car/shed has been burgled by my wonderful neighbours.  *Risk my life using the wonderful UK public transport system (not to mention the roads that are up and down like a wh*res knickers).  *Watch mind-numbling tv and drink like a fish to forget just how bl*ody miserable life in the UK is.    I agree with your sentiments though.
1bd6f7dcd94b559f97fdb31387c7926faa	I support it, but with stiff regulation.  You see what deregulation got us into during the Bush administration.  However, it needs to happen fast in order to even be remotely successful.|`|0AlwfTxMaa	Do not support the lie that is called a stimulus package.  The plan this week in the House would dedicate $550 billion to spending and $275 billion to tax cuts. A recent report by the Congressional Budget Office ("CBO") found that much of the spending would occur too slowly to create the jobs that President Obama seeks. According to CBO only 7% of the $358.1 billion in discretionary funds would be spent be spent in fiscal year 2009; 38% by the end of fiscal year 2010 (when the economy is expected to be recovering); and 67% in fiscal year 2011. Moreover, much of the spending would permanently grow government rather than providing temporary stimulus.|`|dGiYVfw6aa	I'm afraid that it will just make the bad recession we are in last longer. A lot of economists think that the new deal made the great depression last longer than it had to.

Many people who get good qualifications and skills leave the UK every year, never to return, due to the fact that earning a living and living well in the UK tend to be at odds with each other. Working an 83 hour week and not seeing my kids, plus not being able to use my quals and spending all my money on bills and taxes, gets beyond a joke after a while.  Emigration from the UK is at an all time high, with the UK having one of the worlds largest "brain drains". No prizes for guessing why!|`|fdP9UJOsaa	No need to dis your country like that my friend.

If it was the right type we could have coped quite well.    The answer to your final bit is; every voter write ''No Confidence'' on their ballot paper.    Just one actual vote gives any politician the chance to claim 100% of the poll, and a landslide victory.

The only man of principle is the Prime Minister of Turkey ( Erdogan) who speaks truth to power ( except when he is denying the   Armenian holocaust and dealing a bit severely ,shall with say, with the restive Turkish Kurds) and tries to be a peacemaker between Israel ( who played him like a cheap violin) and Syria and Hamas.    Otherwise everyone is either kissing up to the Americans or playing footsie with the Iranians.  In Turkey's case they are kissing up to the EU.|`|AS4pWko5aa	who cares they are all crackers and love to fight|`|Uaoep16Qaa	because hamas needs more support and resources from outside sources, since Israel blocks a lot of necessities at the border|`|qNkFMv8Naa	Because Hamas serves their interests regarding Israel, while the syrian muslim brotherhood posed a threat to their totalitarian government.

AxAsMsAZaa	How about asking them to come to a Bin Bag/Recycling fancy dress - they must use black bin bags - not that expensive - to make a costume.  Believe me, it can be done, with sellotape and string you can create a ball gown.  I have seen it done.  You can gather the stuff onto sellotape and wrap it round you in layers and add bits and all sorts.   Or they must use something recycled, like boxes or bubble wrap.  Its a really silly but fun idea.       Instead of presents, ask them to spend the cash on food and drink.  Then you can have a great party without spending much.  If you still want presents, ask them to spend half of what they were going to and use the rest for presents.       Try the pound shops for cheap food and party decorations.  Balloons are always cheap.  You can also use them for silly party games, trying to pass a balloon to each other using your knees only can be very funny, if not impossible.      Music can be shared - your mates are bound to have cds they can bring along,  Just set the cd player going and play stuff all night.   Look on the internet for lyrics and print some off and have your own karaoke night.   Try the link below.    The other link gives birthday party ideas - I like the pizza making station myself - give your guests the chance to make their own.  The Scavenger Hunt is always good, although you need to impress on your guests not to steal, not to borrow without asking or disrupt or destroy anything to complete the task.   Stay within the law!  Have a prize ready for the winner(s) or even a small one for everyone who takes part.   You can hunt for anything you like but best make the clues criptic - make people work for their prize.  You might suggest "Find something small, white and soft" instead of "find a feather" and then this will give room for creativity.  They might bring back a piece of white fur, or a piece of white fabric, you could also specify "nothing living" in case someone might try kidnapping next door's kitten!    "Name that movie" is a good one, put clues to movies on pieces of paper and get people to get into teams.  Then you hand out the papers with the clues and they have to guess which movie is being described.  You could go to the Internet Movie Database (link below) for facts about the movies - year it was filmed, main stars, plot, etc. and all you have to do is spend time writing them out.   The last link is to get plastic oscar statues as prizes, only 3.99, if your budget will stretch that far.   If not, why not put Oscar Night into the image search and print off a picture, cut it out, paste it to card and use that.      Happy Birthday btw and hope there is something of use in the above.|`|QZBGIOygaa	maybe a garage party, with clothes from the 60's ,and maybe you let your close friends stay the night and watch movies|`|TtOCh3JSaa	Have a black and white themed party and make all your guests dress up in black and white.

Klp0Mv6kaa	But both Fatah and Hamas have been doing this for years!  "Fact: a growing phenomenon exists in which Palestinian militants seduce and/or rape Palestinian women and then threaten to expose their impurity unless suicide murder is chosen as the glorious and redeeming way out.  The unfortunate female victims in this vicious death orchestra are coerced into blowing themselves up as the only way to spare their familys, and their own, honor.  The terror group Fatah, for instance, runs an operation in which male terrorists seduce or rape young women and then confront them with the deadly choice: shameful death in an honor killing at the hands of the family or the washing away of the familys shame by "martyrdom."   Hamas engages in the same crime, as the heart-wrenching case of Reem Al-Reyashi illustrates. The mother of two young children, she blew herself up in January 2004 at the Erez crossing in Israel, killing herself and four Israelis. It was discovered after the suicide-killing that she had been seduced by a Hamas terrorist -- who afterwards offered her a choice between an honor killing or suicide by means of explosives detonated amidst as many Jews as possible. Her terrorist lover armed her with the necessary explosives and instructions, and her husband drove her to the location of her crime and death.   In May 2004, Israel was able to stop two young Palestinian women from following in Al-Reyashis footsteps. The terror group Tanzim had coerced these women to reclaim their honor by killing themselves amongst Jews. The first woman, Tehani Zaki Ali Halil, had lost her honor after being accused of adultery and was forced to carry out a suicide attack in Tel Aviv as her penance. The second woman, a 19-year-old named Ramah Abed el-Majid Hasan Habaib, was accused of engaging in premarital sexual relations".   http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Rea...|`|AS4pWko5aa	how do they get the men to suicide bomb then     on second thoughts !!|`|b0f0f231555e5da9d455a8890388f3cbaa	This is not surprising.

Al Qaeda Uses Male Rape as Suicide Bomber Coercion  In a January report on Ennahar online which was recently picked up by Brit tabloid The Sun, Abu Ba?ir El Assimi, reformed Algerian militant told authorities that sexual acts on young teen male recruits was a way to get them to become suicide bombers: "These young victims of sexual abuse themselves seek death for fear of remaining prey in the hands of terrorist leaders."    According to Ennahar Online: "According to the Medical Examiner at Mohammed Nadir hospital in Tizi Ouzou, one of the three terrorists eliminated last week in a security barrier in the town of Tadema?t, Department of Tizi Ouzou, had been victim of sexual abuse hours before his death. The coroner's report was confirmed by another report of the Laboratory of Scientific police on the rumors about the practice of sodomy between members of the armed organization.   ...

AA11565799	Modern Zionism started about 110 years ago in Europe to provide a homeland for Jews who were experiencing discrimination and persecution in many countries, including Russia, France and Germany.  After World War I, Great Britain took over admistration of the Middle East, which had been part of the Ottoman Empire.  Britain decided to split up the middle east into Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Palestine, which would be further split into Jordan and a Jewish homeland.  The UN approved the partition of Palestine in 1948.  That's my world history quickie overview.|`|qNkFMv8Naa	Ok mystique you're an idiot. Sure semite means someone originating from the arabia and that area. But the real meaning of anti-semite means anti jew, to think otherwise would be plain ignorant.     Anyways, Zionists believed that if they established a jewish state, anti semitism wouldn't stop, but atleast now jews would be represented by a sovereign government and would be able to defend themselves against blatant anti semitism. I'm not sure if this answered your question so just ask me if you have any other questions.|`|r256yeecaa	Do you know that Arabs are more Semite than the Jews of Israel? It means that Jews are being anti-Semite to Arabs.

"Even today I am willing to volunteer to do the dirty work for Israel, to kill as many Arabs as necessary, to deport them, to expel and burn them, to have everyone hate us, to pull the rug from underneath the feet of the Diaspora Jews, so that they will be forced to run to us crying. Even if it means blowing up one or two synagogues here and there, I don't care. And I don't mind if after the job is done you put me in front of a Nuremberg Trial and then jail me for life. Hang me if you want, as a war criminal. Then you can spruce up your Jewish conscience and enter the respectable club of civilised nations, nations that are large and healthy. What you lot don't understand is that the dirty work of Zionism is not finished yet, far from it. True, it could have been finished in 1948, but you interfered, you stopped it. And all this because of the Jewishness in your souls, because of your Diaspora mentality.    Call Israel by any name you like, call it a Judeo-Nazi state as does Leibowitz. Why not? Better a live Judeo-Nazi than a dead saint.    David Ben Gurion, future Prime Minister of Israel, 1937, Ben Gurion and the Palestine Arabs, Oxford University Press, 1985:  "We must expel Arabs and take their places."

Many boys and girls do ride cars and two wheelers inside their homes to reach the toilets|`|0ulKsvXlaa	No, who told you that cr*p ?  We skived off and blamed the weather.  Then trudged at least 12 miles ( in total) up the slopes with our sledges.|`|oCMrcnu0aa	It was only about a mile each way, through the houses, round a field of potatoes or sugar beet (on a gravel path), then through an area where the clay had been quarried for brick making.  It was OK ... and brilliant for wildlife!  If the clay-quarrying area was flooded, we had to go the long way round by road - probably 1.5 miles.  The school never closed for bad weather but people weren't so fanatical about health and safety then and parents would never have threatened to sue if their offspring was daft enough to slip over at school.  They might have clipped the kid round the ear for being so clumsy. It was more dangerous when the field and quarry became a building site.

If the snow was heavy we walked because there were no buses or cars running, it was too deep for them.     Now most mums do the school run in these big 4-wheel drives so kids are really pampered.|`|ZVDboZkPaa	Usually went by bus the maximum I had to walk would be maybe a mile.    Though my parents moved round a lot as Dad was promoted and moved to a bigger store, so I had 8 private schools and a technical college.    It does strike me that we were at school from 08.30 through until 16.30 and that sports afternoons were compulsory.    Can't say I had any large mileage until I was in my teens and that would be catching a bus at 07.00 and get back for 18.00, unless I was doing sport in the evenings and then I got back for 22.00.    Very long days and we did not have exclusion then, what you got was a dose of the cane across your backside, can't say it did me any harm or any good come to that, it was what happened then.    Schools did not close so much then, I remember 1964 was bad and they replaced rugby and soccer with cross country running, but that was the only change.|`|OVmzkRTOaa	My walk to school was about three miles each way.

I probably walked about a 1/4 of a mile to my comprehensive school. But, i did go home for lunch a fair bit, with several of my friends on the same route, so that would have clocked up the mileage a bit.  Never mind trudging through the snow. What about all the play-times, they left you outside in the freezing cold. You only got to go inside, if it was heavy rain or blizzards. :S  The best thing they ever did at my school was introduce the `Continental Day`. They cut out the breaks, halved the lunch-break and let us finish at 2.20 pm.  Shame, they waited till i was in the 5th year and had only one year left to enjoy it! :( :(|`|b299edc40bfec7da51e76575d6b08d9daa	43, 1.5 miles in snow or whatever, Isee you got your tc back|`|Wt398Yueaa	When I were a lad we got up half an hour before we went to bed.

It does make the Liberal voter an important voter, not because they will ever get their party into power but because their vote determines if Labour or the Conservatives are in, they are the ultimate Swingometer party.  The Liberal is seen as the champion of Political Correctness, and sadly in the fight not to be biased toward anyone or offend anyone, they often end up offending just about everyone.  The media in terms of popular media often like to think of themselves as having a "Liberal background" and this can colour/bias their views and lead to more obvious skewing of their materials.|`|Em9NylOZaa	Liberals are more secular than conservatives.

You simply cannot jail your owners.    "I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.

i7oHTo9haa	Israel was right on to counter attack the terrorists emanating from Gaza.  They are nothing but Syrian orphans and pawns set up to cause problems for Israel, Jordan, and Lebanon and throw out the balance in the Middle East  There never was such a thing as Palestine.  Azworth, Golda Meir is always right. Israel is being kind to them and offer them a home but they make some thousands of tunnels like some crazy underground society instead of making skyscraper on beach front land on the Med Sea.    "The Israelis can sue the Arabs now, and demand billions or even trillions in compensation for the damage caused them in 1948-1967. You Arabs admitted that the [Palestinian] cause began after 1967. So the Israelis can ask: "Why did you fight us before that?" They will demand Arab compensation for the so-called embargo on Israel and for the economic damage caused to the Israelis. If the Israelis sue you, they will win. They will say: We suffered an injustice. We are like an innocent lamb surrounded by wolves. We've been saying this since 1948."   Qaddafi to Arab Summit 2008   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP2ePHOLS...    "The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism.." -- PLO Executive Committee member Zuhayr Muhsin, March 31, 1977, interview with the Dutch newspaper Trouw."    "There is no such country as Palestine. 'Palestine' is a term the Zionists invented. There is no Palestine in the Bible. Our country was for centuries part of Syria. 'Palestine' is alien to us. It is the Zionists who introduced it."-- Auni Bey Abdul-Hadi, Syrian Arab leader to British Peel Commission, 1937   "There is no such thing as Palestine in history, absolutely not." --Professor Philip Hitti, Arab historian, 1946   "It is common knowledge that Palestine is nothing but Southern Syria." -- Representative of Saudi Arabia at the United Nations, 1956  Concerning the Holy Land, the chairman of the Syrian Delegation at the Paris Peace Conference in February 1919 stated:  "The only Arab domination since the Conquest in the year 635 hardly lasted, as such, 22 years."

They didn't exist."  -- Golda Meir (Prime Minister of Israel  1969 - 1974) , statement to The Sunday Times, 15 June, 1969.    "We walked outside, Ben-Gurion accompanying us. Allon repeated his question, What is to be done with the Palestinian population?' -Ben-Gurion waved his hand in a gesture which said 'Drive them out!"  -- Yitzhak Rabin (Prime Minister of Israel 1974 - 1977, 992 - 1995)  leaked censored version of Rabin memoirs, published in the New York Times, 23 October 1979.    "[The Palestinians] are beasts walking on two legs." -- Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin (Prime Minister of Israel  1977 - 1983) , speech to the Knesset, quoted in Amnon Kapeliouk, "Begin and the 'Beasts,"' New Statesman, June 25, 1982.|`|rIm9yUNfaa	That attack was another genocide committed by israel.    Israel policy is to occupy lands slow but steady. First they emblaze the flames of war, then they begin propaganda and after that they expand their territory a little bit after that they become calm for a while and then repeat that cycle again.     http://sites.google.com/site/falastinel7...    In the current conflict, israel always talk about Hamas rocket attacks into israel but they never tell anyone that they blocked Humanitarian Aids of UN and other charity groups (include food, water, medicine, cloth and fuel) for Gaza!  As a result of their besiege, Palestinian civilians began starving and so many of them became sick by drinking dirty and unpurified water and died in hospitals because of lack of medicine and medical equipments.  Lack of fuel resulted in massive blackout in Gaza for months.  after all these cruelties, Hamas lost its patience and attacked israel with home made rockets which were unguided, short range and extremely in effective in destroying targets.  When they did so, israel began massive propaganda and asserted that Hamas broken the truce and attacked israel civilian areas and for raising world commiseration, you always hear that Hamas rockets strike schools, hospitals and kindergartens, but thats really questionable.    --------------  *Note that israel have one of the most advanced laser anti-missile systems which could detect and eliminate any flying object in israel sky in just few seconds. Now why they dont use this system is my question!    --------------  After well propaganda and getting enough credit from their allies for attacking Gaza, they began their massacre in the name of self defense, also they prohibited access of reporters into Gaza to prevent the world become aware of their massacre.  In 22 days of they dropped more than 10000 tons of bombs and shells over Gaza (just imagine!)   They also dropped white phosphorus bombs (which is an unauthorized weapon) massively over Gaza which burned hundreds of civilians including kids.   They attacked schools, universities, residential buildings, factories, shops and farms with missiles, shells and bombs (which arent comparable with Hamas rockets), asserting that Hamas use those buildings for military causes (note that those hospitals and schools were under control of UN and UNRWA).  ----------------  *Note that after their so called cease fire, they kept Humanitarian Aids blocked which resulted in death of hundreds of wounded civilians in hospitals.  ----------------    And they still attack Gaza from sky sea and ground while no Humanitarian Aids could enter Gaza, but all you hear in the news is that Hamas attacked israel with rockets!!!    -----------------------  WARNING!

Counter-attack. After several years of Hamas's bombardment of Israel.|`|vtMqmFjaaa	To provide some background:    -The Israelis forced Palestinians to live in Gaza in inhumane conditions (no reliable sources of food or clean water or electricity, etc.)    -The Palestinians responded by firing rockets into Israel (these rockets have a very short range and were never a real threat...they killed 20 Israelis over the past 7 years)    -The Israelis responded by invading Gaza, killing hundreds of people, intentionally killing civilians and using families as human shields, bombing private residences, businesses, and medical facilities alike, killing police and rescue workers...    These actions are war crimes.  Israel attacked these people (who posed no significant threat) and indiscriminately started bombing the crap out of the entire region, deliberately targeting civilians, school areas when children were just getting out of school (they've killed over a hundred children), and places of refuge.    Israel is more of a terrorist organization -- responsible for more inhumane treatment, more fear, more injustice, more violence, more deaths -- than Hamas has ever been.

She was undeniably stupid (and a poor actress), but she was not a callous ***** - not that this justifies the fairly minimal punishment.

But where to put it? Historically the Jewish people occupied the land around Jerusalem (hence the name). So the Allies decided that this would be perfect. Unfortunately there was already a country there, Palestine. Now the Palestinians (Muslims) had been living in that land for centuries during the time of the Jews and ever since and didn't (don't) feel that Israel has any more claim to the land than say, the Apache Indians would have if they suddenly rose up and said "Hey my people were here first give me back my land!!". But unfortunately for the Palestinians (much like the Apaches) the Allies have all the guns and tanks so there wasn't much they could do about it. They have been fighting ever since, 60 years or so.       Hamas is a hard line Palestinian group. They used to be a militant/terrorist group that basically advocated for the destruction of Israel as the only solution to the "problem". They won the election in the Gaza strip and now control the government there. They have softened a little but not much.

That was Hebrew (Jews) land before the Hebrews (Jews) were enslaved in Egypt. After the Exodus, the Hebrews (Jews) "returned" to that land, their own land. The so-called "Promise Land" was their own, they were returning to what was always theirs. As any history book and the Bible can prove without a doubt, that was Jewish land by the time of Jesus ministry.    In 135 AD, in reprisal for the Jewish Revolt, the Romans forced the Jews out of their land and scattered them around the world they knew by those times. This event is called the "Second Great Diaspora".  After this, the Romans on purpose replaced the Jewish name "Judea" with the Latin "Palestina" as the name for the area.    The pagans living in surrounding areas *invaded* the land and made it theirs.  When in the year six hundred and twenty (620) AFTER Jesus, the Prophet Muhammad founded Islam, those pagans became Muslims, the Palestinians among others.      When the UN "created" the state of Israel in 1947, they were creating NOTHING, that was Jewish land, the UN simply returned the land to its rightful owners.  The fact that the Jews gave the land a new name doesnt mean that it was created out of nowhere.  That land is the Judea of the time of Jesus.

There were people already living there called Palestinians. The English plan was for a controlled immigration policy. The Hebrews jumped the fence and many other nations took offense. The people of Israel have been trying to stretch the borders at the expense of the Palestinians and using heavy intimidation, including military equipment like tanks. Over the years there has been much terrorism in the name of the Palestinians, though reportedly it was foreigners from Lebanon causing most of the trouble, through an organization called the PLO. The PLO leader Yasir Arafat has passed away and now the Israelis have forced the Palestinians into small sections to live, similar to what the Nazis did to Jews in Europe, before they began the genocide. The Palestinians do not have a standing army but the Israelis commonly, for years have driven through their neighborhood as though pursuing a military force. This has caused many to criticize the Israelis. The Palestinians object to the formation of a religious state and to ask the UN if they may form a Moslem religious state.|`|rIm9yUNfaa	First: Palestinians see no reason to divide and share their lands with foreign israelites and they fight to take their lands back.

Lack of fuel resulted in massive blackout in Gaza for months.  after all these cruelties, Hamas lost its patience and attacked israel with home made rockets which were unguided, short range and extremely in effective in destroying targets.

This is wrong. The blame extends to all parties.     Rightio, first for some context. In 1914 90% of the population of what we now call Israel was Arab. Jews made up a smaller percentage of the remaining 10%. And things were swell, the larger Arab percentage got on fine with the smaller ethnic groups in Palestine. These people had lived on the land for generations and held deeds to their homes issued by England. They built homes, livelyhoods and families on that land. In short, it was rightfully their land. Britain even promised to grant the Palestinians their independance in return for a hand during WW1, a promise which was never intended to be kept.    However, at this time the European Jews were asking for a homeland. Australia was suggested and the Kimberly Plan was brought to the Australian Government, asking whether Australia could give up land for a Jewish homeland. Australia told them to go jump. Britain then decided Palestine would do and started allowing the European Jews to immigrate to Palestine. This and the zionist demand that they be given part of Palestine understandably caused considerable unease amongst the Arab population. Britain had essentially promised the land to two groups; the European Jews expected to recieve all of Palestine just as the Palestinians expected to retain control of all of Palestine. They then jammed them in together, can anyone really be surprised that violence resulted? It is for this reason I believe Britain deserves most blame. You simply can not, under any circumstances, give away someones home.    Britain then tried to limit Jewish immigration into Palestine. As a result many European Jews entered Palestine illegally. This angered the Jewish terrorsit group called the Stern Gang who promptly blew up the King David Hotel (British Headquarters). This was only one example of Stern Gang aggression towards the British and resulted in a British withdrawal from Palestine as they wiped their hands clean and passed their mess over to the UN.     The UN were left with a pretty huge problem. Hitlers regime had just exterminated 6 million Jews. His regime had created millions of refugees. So of course there was (rightfully) a lot of sympathy at this time for the Jews. So a vote took place during the year 1947, on whether the Palestinians would have to give up land in order for the creation of the State of Israel. The Zionist movement was powerful in America and Truman was very keen to get their support as it would provide a huge lift to his election aspirations. In his own words "Top Jewish leaders in the United States were putting all sorts of pressure on me to commit American power and forces on behalf of the Jewish aspirations in Palestine", the Palestinians had no such influence. America had just emerged as not only a world power but THE world power. So their vote influenced many other nations; Australia, New Zealand and other nations in the Pacific in particular (America having saved them from the expanding Japanese). There have also been reports of smaller nations switching to support the Zionists just prior to the votes being cast as a result of American pressure, America wanted these votes in order to get the two-thirds majority. So it was no surprise the vote went in Israels favour.    The Zionists were then confronted with the problem of how to remove the Palestinians from their homes. The Stern Gang came to the rescue. They massacred several Palestinian villagers (unarmed men women and children). The worst was perhaps Deir Yassin where over one hundred villagers were rounded up and shot in cold blood. This created wide spread fear amongst the Palestinian population who packed their essentials (lawful deeds to their home and fron door keys included, which some still hold to this day) and fled expecting to return within a few days, over 750,000 Palestinians fled their homes. The Palestinians exaggerated the deaths of the massacre in order to gain support from the surrounding Arab nations who were already sympathetic with the Palestinian cause. As a result of the Deir Yassin massacre the surrounding Arab nations did attack. They were defeated by the new State, as a result of superior weaponry and technology given from other nations. The Palestinians had lost their homes, they were not able to return as the European Jews now inhabited what was once theirs. They had replaced the European Jews as the refugees of the World. They have remained in refugee camps for over 60 years.     In the words of Shlomo Green "It is a tragedy of history that old refugees make new refugees. I have nothing against the Arabs. They are nice people. They are the same as us. I don't know that we Jews did this tragedy - but it happened" he spoke these words after learning that his home was stolen from a Palestinian family in 1948.  source for quote: http://books.google.com.au/books?id=VrXp...

One cannot make peace with a hostile regime to Western values, but defend against those values we reject, and sometimes go to war over it if the other party becomes hegemonious.  The German civilians were not immune to allied bombs when we targeted Hitler's troops, and neither are the Palestinians. Civilians that supported the Hitler regime casualties were in the MILLIONS.  Societies are responsible for the monsters they create, and they suffer the consequences of their own actions, or inaction. We went to war with Nazi Germany and defeated them, Reagan stood up to the Russian Communists  did a Cold War stand off and finally decided to disarm, and now the decision is being made what to do with the Islamofascists.  WW2 Casualties  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I...  Modern countries evolve, that is what happens in a modern world, people go thru growing pains, countries do it and worlds do it and it is a normal event of the human condition and Russia wasn't immune to it, Germans weren't immune to it,  and neither are the Arabs.  It seems we have alot of little Chamberlains about, that previously thought appeasing Hitler with a land for peace deal would work, but it didn't and they soon discovered Churchill, who nobody listened to at first, was right.  Here we go again with people trying to appease a hostile regime, and thinking a land for peace deal will work, which it won't as land isn't the goal that the regime is after. And it seems we have some apppeasors about, who think Reagan was wrong in standing up against Communist Russia and thought that abandoning the civilians enslaved behind the Iron Curtain was the morally right thing to do.  I say, defending freedom is the right thing to do and it always has been.  Ronald Reagan, A Time for Choosing, 1964  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pbp0hur9...

Syrian Actress Amal 'Arafa: Hatred of Israel Is in Our Genes and Blood  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5Os4pdjt...  They should all go back to Syria.  But you know what, Israel isn't that cold as they are Syrian orphans that think there really is such thing as a Palestinian people. Israel offered them Gaza and tried to make a go of it and still tries while all they do is make thousands of underground tunnels and never make their skyscraper on beach front property and Meshal and Assad are sitting pretty in Damascus chatting with Achmedinijad about how they're going to rule the world.  Study Islamofascism.  The society that breeds Islamofascists is not immune. America and allied forces defeated and "checkmated" Hitler, while the Arabs that allied with Hitler weren't even "checked." Now they are being checked, and America and the West isn't waiting so long to respond. We learned our lessons from WW2. Hopefully they will learn this lesson too and not make us "checkmate" them.  Arabs already admitted what they were doing and most gave up the cause. Syria and Iran and the ones that support them are the last of the die hards:  You Arabs admitted that the [Palestinian] cause began after 1967.  Qaddafi to Arab Summit 2008   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP2ePHOLS...  "The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism. For tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa. While as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan." -- PLO Executive Committee member Zuhayr Muhsin, March 31, 1977, interview with the Dutch newspaper Trouw."  "There is no such country as Palestine. 'Palestine' is a term the Zionists invented. There is no Palestine in the Bible. Our country was for centuries part of Syria. 'Palestine' is alien to us. It is the Zionists who introduced it."-- Auni Bey Abdul-Hadi,  Syrian Arab leader to British Peel Commission, 1937 -- "There is no such thing as Palestine in history, absolutely not."-- Professor Philip Hitti, Arab historian, 1946 --"It is common knowledge that Palestine is nothing but Southern Syria."- Represe
br1kwegaaa	The March for Babies has several walks scheduled for the NYC area in April (and May).  Please check out the marchofbabies.org web site for the walk that works best for you.
2CxfFENRaa	British news papers, you can read the stories online  http://www.wrx.zen.co.uk/alltnews.htm    Israeli papers are usually pretty accurate  http://www.haaretz.com/|`|HLHHM4Mtaa	Mt method is to listen to what liberals say and believe the opposite because they always get it wrong.|`|Em9NylOZaa	Us news.com seems to be very plain, very simple. They cover politics and news, financial issues, etc pretty big issues not jessica simpson tho lol|`|NMpbLtuTaa	Be a good reporter and get others to do the same.|`|85kWzSzuaa	If it is regarding Obama you have to look for foreign news outlets. For example: The Times of India.     Journalism in America is dead.      http://www.indiadaily.com/editorial/2047...|`|6Ow34Lokaa	You won't. All media outlets have their own agenda. If you balance several sources you can decide for yourself.|`|kn9hQZ1xaa	I like topix.net|`|5bYpbodUaa	I don't think there is any type of media who doesn't doctor up their stories to make them juicier. That's too bad too huh.   The only way you can get unaltered news is if you were there at the scene yourself witnessing, and hearing what all is being said and done.|`|SahUDTLnaa	The only ones I have found  are Glen Beck and Hanity on Fox  also Rush.  Oreilly just not what he use to be to me.|`|Kjxahz06aa	That's what the Daily Source is for. They do the job for you. Isn't that sweet?    Really, check it out! http://dailysource.org/|`|8207ee7a6b82ec38c948d336e393f122aa	IMO - No one source can be trusted. They all have their own ideological spin. What I do is read a lot of newspapers, magazines and watch CNN, MSNBC and FOX.    At the end of the day I feel as if I've at least given them all a chance to influence me.    Basically - all they do is confuse me. It's all their own brand of B.S.  You have to think for yourself.

9SB2Y5r8aa	The percentage of Arab immigrants in Palestine is  ZERO PERCENT .|`|Fm5YsQnfaa	This sounds rather like the USA. The native Indians were decimated by the influx of Europeans and Africans and then found themselves as minorities in their own country.|`|AA12066574	You've already answered your question, to some degree. Nobody knows the exact percentage because it is no longer politically correct to even ask that question.|`|HJaVcUGwaa	This is a very old Zionist lie.  I challenge you to bring forward any credible reference to your bizarre claim.  The only Turks that lived in Palestine were military ottoman personnel and civil administrators.  They made up significantly less than 5% of the population.    The Muslim Arabs, whether they converted from Judaism or Christianity more than a 1300 years earlier, does not make them not native.  This mixture of Muslims, Christians and Jews before 1917 were the Palestinians.    This is a Jewish site reference showing the progression of Palestine/Israel population from the 16th century to 2004.  http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsou...|`|d6dVMApeaa	I personally am surprised that you do not know this statistic! I mean, Arabs have been immigrating to Palestine for years! Have you been living in a cave? Honestly, you should just go down to Palestine, and count all the Arabian immigrants!
sZhTwzh4aa	wow, finally somebody gets it! that's why the Great Depression was so bad. people hoarded their money instead of spending it, so the economy had no chance to improve. same thing is happening here. people are willing to send our country to hell for the sake of having a story to report.|`|H8MGismEaa	Yes. People hear that drivel and assume it is so - and act as if it is so.  Then guess what , thoughts become things . There ought to be a law.|`|Fm5YsQnfaa	Yes. The media do make things worse very often but what can we do, suppress the press?    Telling the truth is essential. There are ways of telling the truth without sensationalising it and causing unnecessary distress.    It happened with passive smoking. A non smoker has less than a 1% risk of getting cancer yet the news paper headlines said. PASSIVE SMOKING INCREASES THE RISK OF CANCER BY NEARLY A THIRD.     It also failed to mention that the non smokers from the survey who got lung cancer had been subject to other areas where there was a risk like exposure to asbestos.    I am not advocating that smoking everywhere should be allowed but it shows that there is scaremongering caused by accurate reporting carefully worded by those crafted in using words can cause us to be effectively  misinformed.|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	People have legit fear.  Why would you spend anything, when companies are laying off people regardless of their financial performance?    Are you offering to cover peoples rent and pay for them to eat, if they are good little consumers and spend all of their money on overpriced disposable crap, and STILL lose their job?      Hammer-  Oh I understood the question, I understand in perfectly.  You believe the media, by reporting the truth, is some how "blowing it out of proportion", and feeding fear.  In your opinion, I guess we should just keep secret the tens of thousands of job cuts occuring every day, or bank bailouts, or anything else fiscal.   Then people will keep spending their money, and you would be the first to kick dirt in their face when they lose their home because their job gets cut.   Maybe we also should cover up murders and break ins, then people will stop that pesky habit of locking their doors.    We should cover up child abduction and poor school performance as well, because we dont want parents being concerned about their children.    The media isnt "hyping" anything, its just reporting hard core facts and figures.  I guess, for some people, that is a difficult concept to swallow.      Hammer-  Yes you did give your opinion......"....I mean, the more they talk about it, the more worried people will get. The more worried people get, the less they will stimulate the economy in an effort to save a few bucks...".  Its part of your question.    My answer is that the media isnt fueling anything, they are simply reporting reality.   Even with out the news, people would realize things are bad.    It didnt take a well developed news source for French peasants to realize they were being taken for a ride in the French Revolution.   Do you think people are blind?  Do you think they dont see the foreclosure signs? Their friends and family getting laid off?  Its not like if the news stops reporting it, that magically, it will get swept under the carpet.   Did the news cause the banks to make sub prime loans?  Did the news cause the oil speculation that drove the prices up? The Iraq War?  Come on now, get real.         Alpha Dad-  Last person who tried to pick on me was around 5th grade, and I broke his nose.   However, people who have brains generally are picked on, unfortunatley, brainless former meatheads like yourself, assume that intellegence is conversely related to ability to defend ones self, and then they get theirs eventually.   Im guessing you havent found the one who will defend themself, but keep barking up that tree, maybe youll run in to me one day.   Cheers.|`|5CI2YHoqaa	No i don't think so, they are just showing us what a sham our country has become. Perhaps seeing the realisation of what people have voted in (IE) Labour doesn't sit easy with those who voted them in .|`|1bd6f7dcd94b559f97fdb31387c7926faa	The "hype" doesn't help and yes, it is a hindrance.  People get scared and do not spend and in order for an economy to be successful cash has to flow.|`|6RrbxLm0aa	The media sells fear, and many people are buying it.|`|AA10546011	Yes !!|`|CLfjamAPaa	Absolutely. It is like a boulder that starts rolling - the more they talk about how bad it is or may get - the more scared people become. The new administrations pessimistic talk does not help either. The best thing we can do is to not participate in the doom and gloom.|`|TeTKYAG0aa	yes, i think they make it worse.|`|X3yCLmnxaa	This is something I have been looking at for a while now. This is true for the stock market with every bad report that goes across the news they drop and with every good report they rise. I blame the media for a lot thats wrong with this country they misrepresent the news on a daily basis. If they werent in it for "shock value" they would be alright. I have an example of this: you have all watched the news where there is a new public concern maybe food illness or some toy that is killing kids they never tell you on the commercial or the first few minutes why you ask? because they want you to stay and watch everything. If they really cared about you they would tell you the details in their commercial or as soon as there on the air but they dont because they breed fear and fear sells so the little lemmings will sit and watch their whole program just to find out the toy that is killing babies is in Canada and the food outbreak happened in the south but you live way up north. Speaking of that outbreak they beat that to death and to the point where they had everyone scared to buy tomatoes even up here Mass and there was no evidence that it was even close people who sold tomatoes lost a lot of business for no good reason only for the fear dealers on the TV I get all my news from the web and I will continue to do so there is no ratings push or corporate networks to please. Get with it people or you will find out how deep we can really go.|`|NkeTXTJ8aa	Hammer, I think your riight.    M O I used to watch people like you get picked on in school. So stop being a doucher and grow up. You obviously are comning to your own conclusions about the question when a simple yes or no would have done. I would block you as a user personally
1bd6f7dcd94b559f97fdb31387c7926faa	The most interesting and by far the most important is the "stimulus plan" proposed by President Obama.  However, I don't think children could or would care to grasp that.  Try Global Warming with the children and how we are losing the polar bears by astronomical numbers because of the melting of the polar ice caps.  Of course, you'll have to do it in a tactful way with children.  But they need to learn at a young age just what is happening to the Earth they live on so they can pass it on and possibly do something about it.|`|il7Sr2Izaa	You can try some science news. There are interesting and unbiased things going on including new species being discovered in Colombia, new updates on the "hobbit people' of Indonesia, or the possible eruption of Mount Redoubt in Alaska.

tguEmxVyaa	You got this question from a comedian on comedy central..It's not nice to steal jokes.|`|odBWpML6aa	Yes, it does seem that the Emergency Alert system was not used on 9/11.  See source.      However the internet, talk and news radio, and the major networks did a fantastic job of getting word out.  I'd say that "jam the channel" alert systems are points of likely failure during events.  The public and local authorities did a great job without resort to central authority.|`|1fIQXPP5aa	HAHAHAHAHA  interesting point|`|WqI4rCrhaa	great question- It's called the Emergency Alert System now, and the president is the one who makes the call as to whether it needs to be activated. Obviously, G.W. Bush didn't do a lot of things he probably should have during his term; this being one of them.  I think he chose not to though b/c the media did a great job of spreading the word that day.  By the time they interrupted his reading session with those elementary kids and told him about 9/11, half the country already knew what happened.|`|AA11598210	~~Great observation!! Never thought of it, but you are so right, it was never used. Amazing isn't it??|`|cNVTtkgmaa	Yes, it was utilized.
gPvOcB6oaa	It would be fair and democratic, but a bit too democratic for the pro Europeans as they know the public would vote no and that is why there will be no referendum|`|ANnPZWm2aa	i belive that we should have a referendum, the brittish people should have the right to express there feelings. wernt we promised one in the last election?    tbh i just think the government wont give us one as there too scared to.|`|NMpbLtuTaa	Of course. People are very intelligent. Just take a look around for the evidence.|`|oMCiOD1gaa	We pay to much to the EU compared to many other countries.Mrs Thatcher managed to get a good rebate but this was given back by the Blair's government. One of the biggest disadvantages is allowing foreign workers from other EU countries to come to Britain without a visa . Hence all the strikes happening now.|`|gjANqjtTaa	I would support referenda for all major debates, membership of the EU being one such.It is democracy seen to be working..Wunderbar!|`|AA12349988	Actually I sort of agree with London - although I would express it very differently.    Lets just say you had a referendum on increasing tax - who would vote yes?   But the big picture could be if you dont increase tax then hospitals would close and people would die.  - would you leave that up to referendum.    In the case of Europe the referendum would be should we be in Europe - I think it would be close but I think at the moment the No we should not be in Europe would win.       We lose jobs, trade and our position in the world.  Unless you have a full understanding of how Europe works and how interlinked our economies are you are not qualified to vote on the matter.  Most people dont - they see the headlines as reported in the press.    Toyota factory in Derby was only built because it can export cars to Europe and received a European grant to build it.  No Europe no factory - it would move to mainland Europe.  Same with many banks, factory and engineering companies.|`|5qnoX8lgaa	We should have a protest march and a strike to get one. They are supposed to represent the people not dictate.|`|JhC6BvPpaa	WITH 'RESPECT'....... It's not going to happen. It's plain to see that we were lied to when we joined the 'common market' in the 1st place. I would love a referendum, the country would love a referendum. It's the fairest thing to do, but all the govts past and present know that we would vote OUT of the EU. It doesn't fit in with Lordy Brown's New World Order if we vote OUT now does it?    I believe that the whole idea of the EU was never ever going to work for the British. We were dragged into the 'common market' under the guise of trade only. That was never explained properly to the common voter that voted 'for' it at the time.|`|xZwwb3kVaa	We have no say whatsoever in this Country, because they know that we are right and they are wrong. No way will they give us a referendum, because they already know what the vote would be., and   they do not want that, as they love to be under the thumb with that lot over there. Since this lot came to Power we have had our rights to anything taken away, and it is the case now that we have to do what we are told.|`|5CI2YHoqaa	Yes this situation needs reassessing for sure. It certainly not as many thought it would be.|`|ZKXo8RK8aa	In view of the fact that this year our membership of the EU will be costing the British taxpayer 116000.one hundred and sixteen thousand pounds per minute.I think that out of common courtesy we should at least be asked if we are happy with that  .  this is the cost for 2007    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=t6H5eFyapB...     http://aftermathnews.wordpress.com/2007/...|`|RxZqP0cdaa	Yes I do support a referendum    However, that referendum must only take place when the financial conditions are right for us to join.    Why?    Because if we had a vote on it for instance right now, the British public are so fickle and greedy that they would vote against it.    However, if we had a vote on it wen it was obvious to everyone that all would benefit from it, then the fickle and greedy British public would vote yes.    Despite all of those on here who say "Never never never!", they know full well that if it benefittd them financially, they would be the first with their hands in the air!|`|doLyOac0aa	Everyone should support a referendum, it's only fair,    What is  not fair, is that the government wont let the British People  have a referendum,|`|Vv465eJMaa	The public at large are too thick to make such important decisions.The public lack objectivity and vote emotionally.It is best left to parliament to make considered opinions.  If we had an awful child murder,and then immediately had a referendum for the death penalty,the public would overwhelmingly vote for the death penalty.However if we had the death penalty and later it was proved that someone had not actually committed the crime,the public would vote for abolition.(they only know how to vote with their emotions)and so can never be trusted to make important national decisions
0Y6CqSliaa	Actually, yes.  Operation Bojinka was discovered after a fire in an apartment. The police went in and found a computer and searched it.  "The Bojinka plot (Arabic: ??????; Tagalog: Planong Bojinka) was a planned large-scale terrorist attack by Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed to blow up eleven airliners and their approximately 4000 passengers as they flew from Asia to the United States. The term can also refer to a combination of plots by Yousef and Mohammed to take place in January 1995, including a plot to assassinate Pope John Paul II and crash a plane into the CIA headquarters in Fairfax County, Virginia, as well as the airline bombing plot."    "Despite careful planning and the skill of Ramzi Yousef, the Bojinka plot was disrupted after a chemical fire drew Filipino police attention on January 6 and January 7, 1995. One person was killed in the course of the plot - a passenger seated near a nitroglycerin bomb on Philippine Airlines Flight 434 - but some lessons learned were apparently used by the planners of the September 11 attacks"    "A file named "Bojinka" lists the eleven flights between Asia and the United States, which were grouped under five codenames. Strings were found, such as "SETTING: 9:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. TIMER: 23HR. BOJINKA: 20:30-21:30 NRT Date 5" (for United flight 80), and "SETTING: 8:30-9:00. TIMER: 10HR. BOJINKA: 19:30-20:00 NRT Date 4" (for Northwest Flight 30).[4"|`|AS4pWko5aa	be careful a lot of people on yahoo support these terrorists|`|AA11828439	There have been several, most notably the attacks attempted in Scotland.|`|NMpbLtuTaa	I don't want some Islamic police officer going through my computer and deleting my Christian literature.
k5X78IM3aa	I was a teacher.  All bomb threats should be taken seriously.  However, if it has been decided to have school tomorrow, then you can be sure all precautions have been taken for your safety...both for today & for tomorrow.  However, I cannot tell you whether to go to school or not.  Use your best judgment.  But I will repeat...all precautions have been & will be taken to ensure the safety of everyone in the building.    (My own private opinion is that the person behind this just wants to disrupt the school...which he is succeeding in doing.  This is opinion only.)|`|0Y6CqSliaa	You know about 99% of bomb threats are not real. They go through the whole school with bomb sniffing dogs and they search literally everywhere.  I think it would be safe but i wouldn't count on it. I think you should just not go.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	Most bomb threats are fake.    All bomb threats should be taken seriously.    Bomb threats are worth a lot of jail time.|`|e57c7db914fb45d19d9afc6f475d8c37aa	All bomb threats should be taken seriously..

i7oHTo9haa	Yes, totally.    One of their people in Gaza said "we desire death like you desire life!"    And the Ayatollah over in Iran said if all of Iran perishes to make the world an Islamic state it will be worth it.    Sounds like they're asking for it to me. I say the West needs to spank them really hard.    Ocean: Edit to Ocean: Palestinians don't want peace, they want "pieces" of Israel. West Bank is prime military territory and you know it. West Bank is Judah tribe's land. Israel offered Gaza for peace, left Gush Katif, and they sent rockets from Gush Katif.  Peace isn't in the Palestinian vocabulary, they said "piece."|`|LJLU5FZQaa	Their butts are just fine--especially those butts hanging out in Damascus.  It's the collateral damage of the civilian casualties that is unacceptable.  When the Israelis do an extra judicial, illegal by international law assassination ( usually by missile strike) there are many bystanders killed and it has been this way for years without any protest from the holier than thou cheering section for Israel, but let Hamas crazies lob a few rockets that don't kill anyone, mostly miss any target worth hitting and are likely to kill as many Israeli Arabs  as Israeli Jews, and you get people like you frothing at the mouth in eager anticipation. Yes, there is a certain amount of masochistic chest beating frustrated heroics on the part of the military wing of Hamas.  Sad if it were not so ridiculous.  Rockets against US supplied helicopter gunships?    Well, it takes a sadist to get into the masochism part of this lowly drama...I guess you and the rest of your peanut gallery  get off on pictures of burned and maimed children, of houses totaled and people living in tents, bloated corpses, and UN buildings destroyed.   Yeah, the total waste of your taxpayer money (because this will repeat again and again until someone gets a clue in Israel)  must send you to bed happy as a clam!|`|fFq68dJYaa	What they are trying to do is to get as many Palestinians killed as they can. Then they can, once again, cry about "evil zionists".|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	theres an old saying ignorance is bliss|`|J9RuKMPXaa	Israel supporters have the mind of a torturer and love to keep inflicting pain on Palestinians, even though they know that just by giving freedom to Palestinians and returning back to 1967 borders, they can have peace.|`|8TLEjhqaaa	by the way, israel attacked first on november fourth,  when everybody and their mom was paying attention to the election.    israel is not being a good neighbor.  think of fourth of july firecrackers.  that's exactly what hamas is throwing into israel.    israel wants every country in the middle east to fear them  and with the help from the united states,  it's possible.    the death ratio of palestinian civilians to israeli soldiers is outrageous.  several hundreds palestinian civilians to one israeli SOLDIER.  don't you think that's outrageous?  it's like you socking me  and i kill you for revenge.    did you know that israel was all for the idea of getting hamas elected  because they needed someone to weaken fatah?  the moment that it was clear to israel that hamas was not going to take their crap,  israel went on a killing rampage.    now, i don't condone terrorist organizations.  they should be taken care of,  but at what cost i ask you?    yes, israel should have the right to defend themselves,  but to what extent?    israel wants to attack iran because it has nothing better to do.  the moment israel attacks iran,  are you going to support them as well?|`|RQtYkwXgaa	You might want to actually read the news articles then... instead of just repeating what you have heard, all of news articles I have seen on rocket fire since the cease fire have been claimed by various other groups other than Hamas.    Example from: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28963991/    "Hamas has not taken responsibility for the new attacks, which have been claimed by smaller militant groups. But Israel says it holds Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since seizing power in June 2007, responsible for all attacks coming from there.     Israeli defense officials said they had not yet formulated a response to the strikes, but said a return to the offensive  in which Israeli tanks and infantry units penetrated deep into Gaza  was unlikely. Instead, they said Israel would consider airstrikes, including attempts to kill Hamas leaders. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing classified security matters."    So if Hamas is not firing the rockets, how exactly are they the ones asking for it?  (Note the groups sending the rockets are criminals plain and simple. And per the reports Hamas itself appears be holding up their side of the cease fire.)    Given that the IDF has stated that they would strike at Hamas for any rockets fired and Hamas has never in the past had any problems with taking credit/blame for attacks on Israel, kinda makes you wonder if some other group is launching them on purpose to have a rival group exterminated.|`|5qnoX8lgaa	I just cannot comprehend their way of thinking, It is just inviting Israel to bomb them.

And also denying them the rights to the ports where they might receive them.  And this was before the missiles started flying.  In fact, this was why the missiles started flying.  And then of course there is the matter of the Jewish settlers in Gaza who grab up the good real estate and leave the barren land for Palestinians.  The new Israeli Prime Minister promises to put a stop to this and pull the settlers out.  Bravo for her.  She really wants peace.

I would slap him hard across his impetuous pontificating face, if he were to be standing in my immediate perimeter.

Disputing the figures (bad) or the existence of gas chambers (beyond ridiculous) qualifies you as an idiot who can't read basic evidence.    As for Bishop Williamson - the clue's in the title. He's not called 'Historian Williamson'. Screw his opinion.|`|dGiYVfw6aa	Well maybe because some people have elderly relatives who were there. And tell stories about how their whole family was wiped out. Women being thrown on train cars and separated from their children and never seeing them alive again. There are still people alive who saw the concentration camps first hand. Allied troops saw the camps and stacks of dead bodies when they liberated Europe. People have the right to be mad about his comments and say bad things. Just as he has the right to say he doesn't believe the Holocaust for some reason.    JG 1988: Below are some pictures for you.|`|LJLU5FZQaa	Because the 6 million Jews were just a small part of the horror show that the Nazis ran for years so if that gets denied and minimized then the deaths of millions of Gypsies,Poles, Russians and others who were eliminated ruthlessly also gets "disputed" and so we slide down the slippery slope of the rewrite of history.  Let's not let it happen to the 100,000 thousand plus Iraqis who were blown up by the US invasion of their country. Minimizing of atrocities is a surefire way to insure that it happens again and again and again.  And a war crime is a war crime is a  war crime regardless of who does it and for what reason.  Period.|`|Klp0Mv6kaa	I think its because normal people feel sick when someone tries to prove that the number of Jews murdered by Nazi Germans was not 6 million,but "only " 4 or 5 million people.They also feel real sick when some fools start to ask for "proofs" when there are hundreds if not thousands of documents,photos,tesimonials of the SS soldiers and officers,testimonials of hundreds of those who passed through the concentration camps - and all them can without any problem be found and read in any more or less good public library.  In London public library,for example,you will be given the microfilms of these documents;sit and read!  But then there appears some idiot like this WIlliamson,and starts to demand "proofs".  Its like someone would now demand for "proofs" that the Earth is not flat.  The stupidity annoys.|`|2uPEty21aa	I think it's mainly when people in "authority" or people of influence say it.

Edit:  I do not deny the Holocaust, there is plenty of evidence for those who can see.    I think the "thumbs down" brigade have proved my point anyway.|`|0b1a38ddb028d9a6c669ad7b4e4f3db8aa	because of the motive behind it.

It's the fact I have to argue with someone who ignores the facts and the first hand evidence I point out and then they continue to point to these lies.   When you deny 6 million people died in concentration camps, you are allowing the perpatrators of this crime to escape blame and denying dignity to the dead|`|uJhrqJCDaa	By questioning what is said about the holocaust the Bishop is calling the people who tell the story a bunch of liars.

Holocaust Info:  Yad Vashem  http://www.yadvashem.org/  US Holocaust Museum  http://www.ushmm.org/  Neuengamme Camp  http://www.scrapbookpages.com/Neuengamme...    How would you like it your family perished, one was a step brother and you then get subjected to my argument "was he really your brother?" over and over and over again I never say anything about your family dieing just challenging the details of your brother.  Kind of defeats the lessons that need to be learned from the Holocaust or your family dieing and what needs to be done about it.   It serves no useful purpose to deny the Holocaust but it is actually quite harmful to humanity to do so. The type of people that did Holocaust are still out there, and the type of people that killed family are still out there, so you see we have other matters to get on with. We have a history lesson to learn from it and that is to say "Never again!" So get with the program already okay?    I give the Bishop and the Holy "See" a Holy D- for what they've done.    You know what kind of people that deny the Holocaust?  Neo-nazis that still want their master Aryan race. Islamofascists that want the whole world Islamic and they will kill the infidels.

It should be remembered by all.|`|J9RuKMPXaa	It's intellectual blackmail. If you question the number of people killed in the Holocaust or ask for hard evidence, you will be declared "antisemitic."    EDIT:  I don't know why people are giving me thumbs down when what I have stated is easily observable. In much of Europe it's a CRIME to question the Holocaust.|`|oMCiOD1gaa	I am not sure if all the 6 million quoted are all Jews. There were many Poles, Russian pow's, gypsies,gays and mentally handicapped murdered in the gas chambers also. We all seem to forget these poor people. The holocaust was not an all Jewish massacre|`|gjANqjtTaa	Cos you're an idiot. ...and I`m a member of the BNP...a paid up fascist.You`re still an idiot!|`|RQtYkwXgaa	This is a very sensitive subject for many people... as it involved family for many... plus the sheer shocking scope of it makes it something that sticks out.  So people will get very very defensive when someone starts implying (or just outright saying) that either it did not happen or not to the levels that have been documented.    First off, the Nazi party kept EXTREMELY detailed records of what went on at the 3 types of camps.  (note there were not just concentration camps, but also work camps and execution camps.)  So unlike the situation over in south east Asia (specifically the atrocities that the Japanese military committed) during the war, we have massive amounts of information on exactly what was done to people in the Nazi camps.    Add to this, several of the camps (including the camps at Auschwitz) have museums at them now which include among other things tours that some schools have taken over the years.  (And trust me, there is a feel to those places that you will never forget.  I have yet to meet anyone who has visited one of the camps that did not come back changed for it.)    So the reason people react strongly too it is the same reason that someone would be upset at people denying the spanish inquisition happened 60 years after it occurred.  (especially in Spain itself)  It is still relatively recent history... and people remember it from personal experiences or from close family.  (Add to this the fact that it was so shocking that many countries want to do everything possible to make sure it never happens again, which means you DO NOT forget.)|`|8897ef26cacbd959d0b80f92cb194984aa	Because there is such overwhelming proof.  Not to mention that the germans addmitted it.  How much more proof does the idiot need.|`|ecfdaa0025f15f95c0f55c59a87b000aaa	They get annoyed because the Holocaust is FACT. Not made up, not a fairy story but cold hard fact.|`|MLLCn4weaa	Querying the number of Jewish murders in WW2 should not be a topic for discussion. The fact is a whole race were systematically being wiped out.  Mein Kampf makes that quite clear.  It's unnecessary to talk in terms of quantities as if 300,000 makes it better than 3 million.  It was wrong, it was real, it happened and it was barbaric and it was long ago. We should have learned from it.|`|9f1f37b0c1dd67586383964dadcdd14aaa	You will never get to the TRUTH about the Holocaust because all sides in this debate cannot be trusted (Jews, Catholics, etc...)...    Q. How many Non-Jews (Christians, etc...) were slaughtered in WW2?    A. More than 6 Million - Does this make the slaughter of all the Non-Jews during WW2 a Super Holocaust???|`|AA10866651	Why do people get "stroppy"?  Because the Holocaust is one of the most horrific events to occur in modern history.  And because it IS a documented fact.  And because there are STILL survivors alive today WHO WERE THERE.      The people who escaped during the beginning of WWII and came to the U.S. as refugees with their families as children are now in their 60's and 70's.  They still remember.      And the Holocaust wasn't just about the attempted extermination of the jews.  It was about the attempted extermination of EVERYONE that Hitler and the Nazis didn't approve of.  Millions more than just 6 million jews were murdered during the Holocaust, and not just in the camps.  The Nazis killed millions of homosexuals and gypsies.  They killed 20 million Russians.  They almost completely destroyed Poland and other parts of Eastern Europe.      The Nazis kept VERY detailed records, including films, of what they did.  When the Allies landed in Europe and began the liberation of the camps, they also made detailed records of what they found (does the phrase "Nuremberg Trials" ring a bell?) so that the WWII war criminals could be tried afterward.  The press corps also traveled with the Allied armies during WWII and they reported on the Holocaust findings.  The Holocaust wasn't actually a secret.

ehBPus3Zaa	Basic information is that Hamas in Gaza keeps sending rocket attacks into Israel despite that they had a cease fire. And then Israel has to retaliate to defend herself. Hamas is the government in Gaza that was elected but they are terrorists that used it to get elected from the people out of fear of retribution.|`|LJLU5FZQaa	Currently..well the Israelis are doing a reprise of what they did 8 years ago in Palestinian territory when they did collective punishment and trashed the infrastructure when the PLO whom they did not like were in power.  Now the PLO has a rep of corruption, not taking care of social services for the people and of not challenging Israeli land grabs and generally harassment that they do ( like extra judicial assassination in which bystanders are killed).    OK so Hamas like the IRA in No Ireland has a civilian branch and a military wing.  In a UN monitored free election, Hamas won a majority in a   parliamentary system.  Israel and the US ( great protectors of democracy as long as the results are pleasing to them which Allende learned to his horror shortly before he was killed by a CIA sponsored coup)  began to harass Hamas and to kill their leadership, to cut off funding for the government etc. etc. so the more radical element began to surface more and more in Hamas and the military wing started to get crazier and crazier meanwhile the civilian folks went on chopping wood and hauling water so to speak.  There was a truce for 6 months but negotiations broke down ( check out youtube,prime minister of turkey  at Davos to get the blow by blow account) and the Israelis did a total blockade of food, fuel, medical aid etc. Naturally, the people of Gaza did not blame Hamas for this sorry state of affairs.  Then some crazy  militants started lobbing rockets into Israel--this a low level, non directed types which have no military target or clear purpose.  So Israeli power elite facing elections Feb 10 find this a wonderful excuse to go into Gaza and trash the place making sure that the International press is excluded from witnessing any war crimes( like the bombing of UN schools with people in the, hospitals etc).  Israel has a right to   defend itself but what many people in the world feel is that it has responsibilities that go along with this  1 avoiding collective punishment   2 with appropriate levels of force  3 avoid bombing the UN facilities--whose workers act as very believable witnesses to what exactly happened in   Gaza--and stop trying to get the UN to abandon its humanitarian work in Gaza  4 allow unhampered access to the world press. 5 deal justly with the claims of the Palestinian people ( i.e. stop sneaking in more settlements into the West Bank as the world's attention is distracted by the Gaza drama.)|`|J9RuKMPXaa	Zionists are stealing Palestinian lands and when Palestinians resist by firing rockets, Israel slaughters by them the hundreds.
