When i was younger my dad always said to recycle the foil. They said it would be easier to make it over again and not waste our natural resource.|`|CTIC7Pmjaa	Actually, I read that aluminum foil paper is not recyclable, but those rigid aluminum pans (the semi-disposable kind) are.  I guess it probably also depends where you live- different cities have different recycling programs.  You could go to your cities website, and look up what is recyclable there.
FXnHE7mmaa	I just bought an Elna Q7200..it is a good all round machine to do everything..I quilt most of the time, but I do still sew many other things and all materials. I would recommend any? Elna machines..these are all I will purchase, as they last forever. If you want to trade up on a machine, the Elna's will hold their value. They are strong like an industrial machine. I love these.
eZDoQPg8aa	It's probably about time for a new one.  Unless you feel up to tearing it completely apart, cleaning it and putting it back together.  Over time, dirt sticks, builds up and starts restricting air flow which is probably why you're noticing it being "weaker".  And gaskets in the unit are probably getting worn and not sealing as well too.  Especially true with a less expensive unit like a Dirt Devil.    Try a Bissell Healthy Home.  It's warranty is for 5 years so you know it is going to last much longer.  It has a lot of things that your old sweeper doesn't and you will be amazed at how much technology has changed with sweepers!  I will warn you, when you get a new sweeper that you will get a ton of ick, dirt, fuzz out of your carpets.  I say don't get a new sweeper unless you want to know how bad a job the old one was doing.|`|sAuB8vLCaa	I'm in agreement with other posters, clean really well, and if you have a hepa filter, maybe that's all you need.

He told me that those machines don't wear out so much as need a new belt - or they need to be cleaned out real good.  Not sure how yours works.  If it has a beater bar (with brushes going around) then it has a "fan belt" - and you can get a new one of those.  You can get a new beater bar.  Make sure that some fine dust isn't clogging your machine at some point.  If you know somebody with a compressor, you can ask them to blow out your machine.      If you go to buy a new vacuum, watch out.  The world is full of the most horrible vacuum cleaners!!!  Unbelievable bad weak useless machines - some quite expensive.  They're all made in China - or have   Chinese parts - and they're crap for the most part.  I've looked!  So repair the one you have if you can.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	Take it apart and clean out all the dust inside of it.|`|xyrSl2nSaa	You could take it apart and clean all the filters and everything else... if that doesnt work then you may need to buy a new one!
YMwUpBIAaa	tropical hibiscus do not return. but their are several types of perenial hibiscus that will come back each year. you can leave the "sticks" for a while, and the plant should come back up no later than early july and if it is not up by then than it is not a tropical hibiscus.|`|AA11785060	Sounds like perennial hibiscus.  Check some of the stems, if dead, trim off just above the ground, the new season's growth should sprout in April.|`|MTbtsWtTaa	Hibiscus are perennials so they should come back.  You'll want to cut last years stems back to about two inches.  I'd wait another couple weeks before doing it though.  Hibiscus stems are hollow, water will collect in them and could begin to rot the plants crown.  Waiting to cut the old stems back until just before the new growth starts helps to ensure that rot won't kill off the plant.
uyLHeIpsaa	Soaking it is definitely the best way to water. I would cut back to like once a week unless your room is really dry, it is okay for it to dry out in between waterings. Use a urea free 20-10-20 fertilizer. Misting is not necessary and can actually can cause fungal problems especially with Phalaenopsis. Misting often causes crown rot. The aerial roots are fine leave them alone. You can cut the flower spike in between two of the nodes running down the stem to get a second flowering. Phals have no resting period so you can keep doing this until there is no spike left. Do not neglect it when it is not in flower or it won't give you anymore. Keep up your routine care.|`|ef4600f3e462ea5050015ba19ff9308caa	This should answer all your questions. You're watering it too much, and you need to mist it.    http://pss.uvm.edu/ppp/articles/orchidgr...|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Don't fertilizer except when not blooming. I use one fourth strength of any good flowering plant food. I water only every 2 wk with fertilizer. They like humidity but not being wet. They do need good light, I have mine near a window during the day but at nite the light above them I have plant growlight. This works well for me. To prune once the flowers are all gone, if you will cut back to the notch just below the last flower was it will often send out a new shoot & re-bloom. If the roots are brittle then they are dead. The healthy ones are kinda greenish gray color & not brittle. It doesn't matter if the roots are covered or not.  These orchids grow in the wild on tree branches so the roots are generally exposed.
dXrHoLMCaa	read here...    http://www.crfg.org/pubs/ff/fig.html    Pruning: Fig trees are productive with or without heavy pruning. It is essential only during the initial years. Trees should be trained according to use of fruit, such as a low crown for fresh-market figs. Since the crop is borne on terminals of previous year's wood, once the tree form is established, avoid heavy winter pruning, which causes loss of the following year's crop. It is better to prune immediately after the main crop is harvested, or with late-ripening cultivars, summer prune half the branches and prune the remainder the following summer.     and here...    http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn...    and this is a 'perfect' specimen....    http://www.dkimages.com/discover/preview...|`|mP0LLMVjaa	I cut everything back to about 4 feet high.

The odor is awful and if you crush one inside, it calls to more of them.   We saw a lot more of them outside of our Maryland home but because we had Orkin on contract throughout the year, we never had one inside the home.  Our office in Delaware gets them inside because our back bay is open a lot to receive and the office park does nothing with exterminators.  We just scoot them back outside.  A regular maintenance by an exterminator will keep them from getting in your home.  We are on contract with Orkin quarterly and are always bug free inside our home and it keeps a lot of other critters from the exterior as well.  I would highly suggest it.|`|KCMWKG7Baa	maybe some kind of a roach.|`|pPBeOpgRaa	Try to get an exterminator or ask someone at Home Depot/ Lowes|`|KkKCKu06aa	roaches, or that one bug that flies around in the summer.  darn i can't think of the name. they are quite scary.    junebugs!|`|iLeG9v2xaa	they are cockroaches. get your house fumagated.|`|mw0JJuCoaa	might b a cockroach!!!|`|AA12192261	get a jar put cider vinger about half full cover it with cling rap then make hole's in it the bugs will be attracted to the smell go into it problem solved|`|FYvCR8mvaa	Don't worry, it's not a cockroach, they are impossible to catch, they move like lightening and don't like the light.

tDBRH5U6aa	The filter is on the inlet of the heater. Look on the adapter going into the cold side of the heater. There should be a round knob on the left side. Turn off the water. If there are isolation valves, turn off both. Unscrew the knob and pull out. There is a mesh screen attached to the knob. Rinse the screen to clean it. Re-install the screen and turn on the water. Check for leaks. Finished.

There's different tip styles for different applications.  It's the only thing that takes care of grease that i know of.|`|0wZcKn8Zaa	its not grease my friend. you need your main line roto rooted|`|WgruZkHRaa	enzyme destroyer.|`|5BOZ2ryLaa	First run the hot water for a minute or two, so that the grease is soft.  Turn off the water and put a cup of baking soda down the drain, followed by a cup of plain white vinegar.  This will foam up, so be prepared.  After the foaming is done, run the hot water again for another minute or so.  This is a good way to keep your drains clean, too, without resorting to caustic chemicals.
AA10625552	I think he's talking about a chimney sweeping log.  This helps to dry out any creosote buildup that might be in the chimney.<br>  They sell these at Home Depot, Lowes', Walmart..., almost anywhere packaged "logs" are sold.<br>  Here's a company that makes one brand...<br>  <a href="http://www.cleanyourchimney.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cleanyourchimney.com/</a><br>  If this is an apartment that you are renting, it's up to the landlord to make sure that the chimney is cleaned.|`|jW8nfcA6aa	1. Call the Landlord and ask if it is safe to use as is and when the last cleaning was done? 2. Make sure you have good working smoke detectors, one in each bedroom, living room and near kitchen. 3. Purchase Renter's Insurance Policy. The Insurance Company will probably require copies of Fire Dept. Approval and current receipt from a Certified Chimney Sweep Co.|`|AA10092387	Yes the first thing you should do is ask the landlord about the fireplace.<br>  More than likely you can just start using it as is.<br>  Remember to use only hardwood, that has dry-ed for about 21 days.|`|AA12061104	Yes your step dad is referring to a Chimney Sweep Log but to be honest they are a gimmick. The chemical in them does help to turn the sticky creosote into powder form, but it does not "clean your chimney" nor does it remove any gasses or odor that the creosote puts out.<br>  <br>  If the odor or gasses coming from the chimney or fireplace are an issue then plug the chimney down low with a chimney balloon and set a large bowl with 1 ltr of white vinegar poured in it in the firebox for 24 hours. this will neutralize the area below the balloon.<br>  <br>  I understand the landlord says the fireplace is fine to use, but it isn't his butt that lives there, so i doubt he has had it cleaned recently. You can do a test fire in the fireplace, but keep it small and fast burning, use twigs not logs and only burn for a short time (like 1 hr) this little test burn will give you a chance to see how well the chimney drafts and how well the firebox throws heat forward and if the chimney is smelly afterward or if there is any trouble signs. If the fireplace is excessively stinky, bad drafting, or if it Just plain looks really caky on the chimney walls then you will need to work out with the Landlord to have it swept and checked by a CSIA certified chimney sweep.<br>  <br>  BTW, "the dry wood for 21 days comment" is really funny. That is like saying "toast your bread in a window sill". Hardwood should be dried for 12-24 months before burning.
AN9HVBZoaa	I have and it worked just fine. I used a private exterminator.|`|joiacDUdaa	A few years ago when I moved into our current home.. The previous owners had untreated pets.. So when the house sat vacant for a couple weeks we had a full blown infestation..!  Luckily, we hadn't moved our bigger furniture or our dog into the house for that matter... We also for under $100 took care of the problem and haven't seen a single flea since..<br>  <br>      So, here's what you do.... First treat the pet(s)... I use BIOSPOT or ZODIAC they are cheaper than frontline and get rid of fleas... I give my dog a bath and use DAWNdish soapp.  It's notpoisonouss and fleas HATE it.. Just leave on your pet(s) for about 5-10 min.  and rinsethoroughlyy.. You can use it as much as you like... Vs. flea shampoo which essentially poisonouss.... Then give your pet the flea drops to kill any fleas that may be in the house.. <br>  <br>     If you have carpet- your vacuum is your best friend.. So, make sure you have plenty of extra bags/belts if necessary and that it's in tip/top shape.. Go to the warehouse club store and buy a BIG bag of baking soda it's around $5 for 12 lbs. and get a big box of iodized salt as well... That costs around $3.... MIx the Baking Soda and Salt together in a ziploc bag and sprinkle mixture liberally on the carpets... Let it sit overnight at least.. .If you can the longer the better!  The baking soda will smother the larve/fleas while the salt will puncture the eggs... PLUS baking soda will eliminate any odors in the carpets and the salt will pick up any stray dirt debris in the carpet fibers. Your carpet will be brighter/cleaner looking... <br>  <br>    Then vacuum your floor like mad... OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY just published a study suggesting that just by vacuuming you can eradicate 94% of adult fleas in the home.. The vacuum any type of vacuum will kill live adult fleas... That's pretty good odds... In areas where there isn't carpet you can set off foggers.. We got RAID foggers for about $20 and set them off in the basement areas... They have a money-back guarantee if they don't work so save your receipts... ORTHO works well too.. Ditto for the money-back.... Vacuum EVERYDAY for at least a month... <br>  <br>      If you want to check for fleas there's an easy trap you can make... Get a desk lamp, a light colored bowl or shallow dish.. think pie pan size and put an inch or so of water inside.. Add a couple drops of DAWN dishsoap and shine the light over the pan on the floor... The lamp heats up the water and the fleas go crazy over the warm liquid they think is blood... They jump in expecting a FREE meal and surprise the DAWN breaks the surface tension and the fleas drown... it's kinda fun....!  If you don't have a lamp you can use a small votive candle in the dish.. ..  <br>  <br>      If you want to handle and outdoor problem as well.  You can use ORTHO HOME DEFENSE and spray the perimeter of your home and the outside of the doors/windows etc... You can spray it inside as well.  It also keeps other bugs at bay like spiders, silverfish and cockroaches, lady bugs, and ants... It's not expensive.. It's around $20 for a gallon...AND/OR you can sprinkle you yard with BORAX that will work as well and located in the laundry aisle... <br>  <br>      We had a terrible infestation... I could see them jumping on me and my children... They looked like black flecks of sand.... It was bad.. With some patience and the right tools you can get rid of them yourself... <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|Au2aI9a2aa	Try this it has worked many times.<br>  Take one gallon of water and bring to a boil.

Think it was organic.<br>  Now however, my husband treats the yard regularly and our dogs take sentinel chewable tabs. prevents heartworm/other worms/fleas. Our dogs are all house dogs & we have no problems|`|HcboXOmjaa	Unless the fleas are REALLY bad, I don't really think it's needed.  Make sure to FIRST use frontline on all of your pets to get rid of the fleas on their body.  Fleas need blood to live, so once they are killed off of your animals, they will have limited time before they are going to die.  Once you apply frontline on your pets, you can vacuum, wash sheets, clean the carpet, etc. and that should do the trick.|`|CdGHyYDfaa	someone i knew used exterminators to get rid of fleas and he said that it was pretty good
944iJNAdaa	There's no known harm from space heaters, anymore than any other electric heating appliance - they all work similarly.  What you're smelling is most likely dust that's settled on the heating elements, and that will burn off after awhile - my wood stove smells the same way when it's first fired up for the year.  So that part seems harmless enough.  Of course, there's a fire danger from any heating appliance being accidently set near flammable objects, and anything with an electrical cord is something to potentially trip over, or have the dog chew on, etc.  Other than the obvious hazards, though, I don't think there's any particular harm from space heaters.

5BOZ2ryLaa	Most vegetables need at least six hours of full sun per day or more.  Fruit trees supposedly do, too, but I used to own a home where my pear tree only got partial sun all day long.  We always had a nice crop of pears.|`|Vv465eJMaa	Root vegetables can cope with less sun as can cabbages and cauliflowers.Peas also.Rhubarb  Peach trees need full sun,apples and pears is the cross pollination for setting of fruit from flowers is more important.They can take part shade.|`|52cGZS3caa	Your first answer is good info and I'll add: Your zone info is important but, how hot does it actually get where you are? If it is as hot as it is here in North Texas, tomatoes will take morning sun, in fact must have afternoon shade - contrary to the label on the plants. Most vegetables will take some shade, just not heavy shade and again, if the sun is as hot as it gets here in Fort Worth, all will benefit from afternoon protection.    Trees are a whole other subject. You really need to get a book - Neil Sperry's isn't bad - to check on the varieties that will grow in your specific area. Things you have to consider when picking fruit trees are the amount of cool season "chilling" they will get which is necessary for fruit setting, when they bloom versus the average date of the last frost/killing freeze in your location, pollinators needed or self-pollinating, etc. For instance: When I lived in Abilene, Texas, a house I owned had a beautiful apricot tree in the front yard. I had that house for 5 years and only got apricots once because they bloom so early that the last freeze of the year got the blooms in four out of five years. (Boy! The year I DID get apricots, I got over a hundred pounds!) So, check out Neil Sperry's Texas Gardner's book (I can't think of the actual title but you can google it). (Even if you're not in Texas, the book will give you the named varieties of the various trees and their requirements). Lastly: Good luck and have fun!|`|FlsrXuJOaa	veggies, depending on what type, usually need a full day of sun. If you try to plant them in low light, they will get really big and will hardly bear any fruit.     As for fruit trees like apples and peaches, they definitely need at least a half a day of sun or more. I know several people with apple trees in shade and they don't even flower. Also, remember with apples, most varieties need two types of apples for cross pollination. There are a lot of peach varieties that self-pollinate. Zone 6 should be fine for everything you want to grow.
pDKm9Wmgaa	Gravel is detrimental to tree's roots. Amending clay soil is better with compost and organic material. Gypsum helps break up clay soil, but as the other poster said, gravel and sand mixed with clay makes concrete. I know, I have heavy clay and I mixed coarse sand with the soil, mistakenly believing that it would help, and it got so hard that I actually broke a Fiskars garden fork in it.   Adding gravel to a planting area for trees will damage the small feeder roots.|`|ACIp8lZqaa	Leyland Cypress are not really fussy at all. They grow in anything.  The raised bed is a bad idea. This "tree" will grow VERY tall ! Upwards of 40 feet. Now come's a wind storm - the raised bed will not give the root bal much support for this wind sail.  Id leave out the gravel as well. Adds a lot of lime and other minerals to the soil. Leaves air gaps and will absorb some of the water that was intended for the plant.  Just break up the soil, remove some, and add leaves , top soil , compost anything to amend it , and plant away. They are pretty tolerant of soil conditions. No worries.|`|wKQbNvm9aa	They are supposed to be tolerant of poor soil, even clay, but do want good drainage.  I would do the trees a favor and not till in a lot of gravel but put in some compost.  Clay + gravel is really kind of like concrete.  The compost will improve the soil and give it better texture and drainage and fertility.  You can use peat moss too.   Gravel does nothing to improve the soil.  Sand isn't much better.  What clay needs is organic material worked in.      The trees would probably like the raised bed as that will help with drainage.  They grow fairly quickly and easily without too much effort.    Good luck.

Ice dams are from too much heat migrating from the living/heated area into the attic space, which itself is probably not vented enough to allow cool air move upwards along the roof rafters; that melts the snow which drains down to the edge of the roof where it is cold enough to freeze again.

If they're coming up too late in your area, try siberian ones.|`|TrbzmQAhaa	Different species and hybrids of the Genus Iris bloom at different times of the year.     Iris Unguiculara (I. Stylosa) starts off the year by blooming in the earliest days of the year, often in snow of January and February.    There are tiny species Iris which are usually used for forcing indoors in little pots in  February, such as Iris Reticulata. They also grow outdoors and make charming, neat little mass plantings. Some are enchantingly fragrant.     Dutch Iris bloom in April and sometimes into May with extremely graceful blossoms on beautiful stems that just fall in to lovely arrangements. I have never had any luck with these plants succeeding for more than one season, so I just treat them like Tulips, which also perform gorgeously their first year and are a total loss the following year.There are translucent blues, lavenders, whites, gold, and combinations of the above.     Siberian Irises bloom in Mid May to Mid June with the Columbines, Peonies, Russell Lupines, and Sweet Rocket (Hesperis), all of which create a picture of harmony and old-fashioned sweetness to the perennial bed before the big June flush. White, blue, and deep navy are the standard colors.     Bearded Iris are big, showy blooms that I find nonethe less flabby and overblown. I do not find that they lend themselves to any sort of bed except by themselves in the cutting garden. That's just me.     Wee little dwarf Bearded Iris are bewitchingly charming planted along pathways and edging.     Iris Japonica blooms later in the season, usually July, with huge dinner plate-size flattened blooms that look like they belong on fine porcelain ware. The require considerable moisture to thrive. These flowers come in exquisite whites, pinks, pale pencilled blues, and darker purples and lavenders.     This is only an extremely abbreviated list of what I consider to be the most readily available types of iris throughout the horticultural world. Societies of eager aficionados can enable  you as your addiction gains momentum.

V7AAba8Laa	Actually, any kind of insects can (and will) start hatching and reappearing anytime the temperature is above about 40 degrees.  There isn't any set time that they all start breaking out of cocoons or chrysalises.  And some varieties, particularly monarch butterflies, actually migrate - they return late spring to early summer, depending on where you live.    Generally, moths and butterflies will start reappearing most evidently in early spring - their emergence coincides with the appearance of spring flowers.  It doesn't do them much good to appear if there isn't a food source available.  To encourage their activity, try to offer them a wide variety of food sources - i.e. plants that flower from early spring to late fall - to keep them well fed and reproducing readily all year.  There are certain trees, flowers and shrubs that are larval food (for the caterpillars) and other flowering plants that provide food for the adults.    If you'd like to see more moth activity around your home, plant night-blooming flowers, such as moonflower or jasmine (if your grow zone allows).  They also love many varieties of vegetable plants with large blossoms, especially pumpkins and squash.  They also really like cardinal flower - and this is attractive to hummingbirds and hawk moths as well.    For butterflies, look for varieties of plants that are bee-and butterfly friendly - they especially love bee balm, anise hyssop, coneflower, yarrow, butterfly bush, queen anne's lace,  violets, nicotinia, primrose and zinnias.  Avoid pollen-free or double-flowering varieties, because your moths and butterflies can't access food from these hybrids.    Also, commercial pesticides don't differentiate - they kill beneficial bugs along with the pests.  And commercial herbicides often kill "weeds" that are larval food, or much-needed sources of early and late- blooming nectar producers.  Avoiding the use of chemicals will help increase the number of butterflies you find around your property.    I've kept bees in the past, and have always gardened to encourage bee and butterfly activity.  I'm always amazed at the sheer number and variety of butterflies and moths that I see around our farm.      Feed them and you'll have even more of them to watch in the future!|`|HKNbWjtOaa	WHAT! you mean there's more,  there must be a few straight ones surely!|`|pDGVTLoFaa	Mid to late summer.|`|W3nCHPUtaa	Moths start coming out in february they are beautiful creatures, moths|`|7sXNwFynaa	in spring when the weather is not likely to get very cold at night.
52cGZS3caa	Yes!  Colors massed together always make a more eye catching dislpay. What you want to watch also is size. Be careful not to place larger/taller/wider plants where they will over-power smaller varieties. One more that I can think of at the moment: Watering! Different flowers have different needs and if you place flowers that do not like too much water next to ones that do, the dry lovers will drown/rot (and of course the opposite).

However, if you have cold air coming out of you electrical outlets you can purchase foam gaskets that mount under the plastic covers. Its one of the recommended steps to further insulate your home. You can purchase them at the local hardware store, they are very very cheap for a  package for outlets and  on/off switches. Just unscrew the covers, stick the foam gasket in place and screw the plastic cover back in place.    I did it for my house and no more cold air from the outlets.    http://www.kyledesigns.com/product/FOAM-...
vEsSIGfYaa	I've had several Christmas Cacti over many years, and never noticed any odor, especially a bad odor.

I suggest phoneing a florist near where you live.|`|V7AAba8Laa	Even in mid-September, late summer bloomers are still going strong if you continue to dead-head.  Most of my bouquets at this time include sunflowers, cosmos, hybiscus, daisies, zinnia, hydrangea, coneflower, calendula, and many flowering herbs, such as catmint, mints, anise hyssop and even a second harvest of lavender if the plants are feeling cooperative.  I also love using shrub roses, because I can often encourage them to bloom straight until frost - much easier to deal with than the more fickle tea roses.  And I love some of the drying flowers as well - many varieties of amaranth, statice and strawflower look their best around September.  Plus you can cut, dry and have some nice arrangements for fall and winter with these plants.    Deadheading is the key, especially for annuals.  If you continue to cut flowers for bouquets and deadhead, the flower is forced to continue to try to complete its reproduction cycle.  An annual flowers' goal is to set seed, which it can only do if the flower is allowed to mature long enough to set seed.  Keep cutting, and they will keep blooming, all the way until frost.    I sell fresh bouquets at markets from May-November, and I have to be pretty selective about finding plants that will produce for a long season, as well as having something to combine into bouquets throughout the season.  For spring, I love lilac, sweet violet, forsythia and spring bulbs.      Try adding some perennial herbs to your flower beds as well.  Bee balm, ornamental oregano, sage and thyme all produce gorgeous flowers that can really add some color to your flower beds.    Hope this helps and happy gardening!|`|IR72L8gOaa	I've had marigolds in my garden for two years in a row.  I've enjoyed the different colors of marigolds plus they lasted until October even at temperatures slightly above 32.  The first year, I planted the marigolds from seeds and transplanted them to space them apart.  It took about 2 months before it started flowering.  There are a lot of flowers from just one plant and continuous too throughout the summer and into fall.  It even beat the chrysanthemums I planted.  Marigolds need little care too.  I just watered them once in a while.  The one thing I do is remove the old blooms once it turns brown.  The following year, a few Marigolds sprouted from the same area so I just transplanted them to a desired location and surprisingly grew well too.|`|I29W1pcwaa	If you mean nusery plants, sedum, chrysanthemums, kale, and ornamental grasses are either blooming or otherwise showy around that time of year.

If not then it sounds like something is wrong with your heating system and it is running constantly. Get it checked before you go bankrupt.|`|WgruZkHRaa	Your problem is poorly insulated walls and ceilings. Try window insulation kit to help stop drafts. A humidifier also helps to make you feel warmer. The evaporation from your skin makes you feel cold in dry air. Frosty windows are signs of air leaks. If walls feel cold to touch they need insulation. If your house was built before the fifty's the duct-work is  backwards. Heat should come out at outside walls, return air should be in center of the house. Fixing this helped the comfort in my house immensely|`|N0TJqtzMaa	i don't know if this will help you or not,but either you have one heck of a gas leak,or your heating several other houses in the neighbor hood,or they just estimated the usage,look on your last months bill and see how many cubic feet of gas they charged you for and compare it to this bill,then call your local gas company and tell them to come out and reread the meter,they do stuff like that all the time where i live Birmingham..

The month before was more normal and therefore would have been less so check your usage and make sure the gauge wasnt misread. They may have misread your meter last month and when they read it this month they got it right, so instead of 59 dollars it should have been 159 which would have made this months bill closer to 200.  Meter readers have done this before.|`|QomVD1ceaa	That is a hefty bill for sure. First turn your t-stat to 60 degrees when not at home. And no more than 70 degrees when home.

N4IvZmPiaa	25 Kilowatts is a big generator! That thing is going to burn 19 litres or about 5 gallons of propane per hour when it is under full load! That is 21 pounds per hour.     You are not going to be able to run this thing off of portable cylinders. You will need a 500 gallon tank at least. The size of the tank required depends partially on where you live, because the colder the outdoor temperature is, the less vapour the tank is able to produce. If you are in a very cold climate you may even need a 1000 gallon tank to supply that thing enough vapour.     As far as cheaper than being on the grid...No way! Not in a million years would this be cheaper! If that thing ran for 24 straight hours at full load you would burn 450 litres a day (120 gallons roughly) which at say $2 per gallon would be $240 per day!!
5BOZ2ryLaa	The term "heirloom seed" is tossed around quite a bit.  It's generally meant to mean seeds that are not hybrid and that have a long history of being grown here.  Hybrids aren't bad in and of themselves, but heirloom seeds can be harvested and planted to get the same type of plant.  Hybrid seeds rarely "come true" when the seeds from the hybrid is used for a next generation of plants.|`|zDeFibxzaa	the term heirloom is cosidered old timey kinds of vegetables and fruits,to the best of my knowledge there arent any that can be classed as heirlooms if they have been hybridized. look up -henry fields or gurneys seeds,john scheepers.etc     www.gurneys.com|`|fyWGMB9caa	try the link below|`|52cGZS3caa	My understanding is that "Heirlooms" are NOT hybrids and can't be. I intend to educate myself on the subject. Thanks for the interesting question. I managed a garden center for a lot of years (15+) and never thought about it.|`|AA10218184	i should have taken better notes but my instructor was talking so fast.  anyway i was just learning about this friday.     ok, he says, a cultivar is created/selected intentionally and maintained thru cultivation, i.e.: caspian pink or dwarf chamion tomatoes.    Hybrids have two unrelated parents, but the term hybrid breaks down into two catagories: Fillial one and two.   F1: Two diferent types of plants breeding (this can include g.e. plants), and F2: two hybrids bred together.  I think a tangello would be an obvious example of F1.  i believe that many cultivars though are considered F2.       Heirlooms are saved seed from  family cultivation or a specific location.  you can create your own plants, hopefully accustomed to your own garden soil, ph, temperatures, ect, and in a way, they are your heirlooms.   again, these are typically thought to have been cultivated over a fair amount of time and to have developed particular or unique characteristics.       With hybrids, once you have a plant with the desired characteristics, at a certain point if you breed two desirable plants, you will lose the qualities you were hoping for- you have to "back breed" to an older plant.     Most hybrids are open pollinating, and so female parts from one type of plant will meet up with male parts of a different line and creat a new line.  carrots can breed with queen anne's lace and create (i have heard) a less-than-desireable carrot.   different squashes can also.   tomatoes are self pollinating, meaning they have all of their sexual parts in each plant, but they can cross pollinate, as bees visit different varieties.  the buzzing of the bee causes the pollin to reach the female parts, and viola!- the more pollin dropped, the meatier the tomato!   well, i guess we both have alot to learn!

The difference can account for over a  $100.00 or more savings per month.<br>  <br>  Bit of advice...Check to see that all storm windows are down in your home, and look into the insulation in the house.<br>  <br>  Homes that are not sufficiently insulated are inherently cold.<br>  <br>  I live In Connecticut, and I set the temp at 65 degrees in my home at the beginning of the winter season, and never touch the thermostat again, until Spring when I shut the heat off.
