In der vergangenen Woche wurden angeblich 160 Taliban-K?mpfer durch Luftangriffe get?tet. (ob diese Zahl stimmt und wieviele Zivilisten dabei waren, werden wir wohl nie erfahren)      Anzunehmen ist jedoch, dass deutsche Tornados die Ziele gesucht und an die Kampfbomber weitergegeben haben, die dann einfach alles platt machten.   Für einen Thaliban-Sympathistanten sind deutsche Soldaten (und nicht diese sondern auch damit Deutschland) zum Feind erster Klasse geworden.      Wer würde anders reagieren?      77% der Deutschen waren gegen die Entsendung der Tornados - gehen nun die Befürworter als Zielscheiben nach Afghanistan?

There are enough bases and posts near each other that I feel the chances are good we could be stationed near each other. Before we got married I was in AFROTC, and as backwards as it sounds, in order for us to be able to afford kids, I need to work. Welcome to the military life, we make squat. Because as a military spouse you move around every few years, the only jobs you can get tend to be the shifts no one wants without very good pay. We want to have children, possibly before I would join, which makes things interesting, but it's doable. I'm hoping that someone who has been in a dual military marriage would be able to give me an opinion on the life.

If anything he was a plant for Obama.

20081013084158AA4VTeK	Politics & Government;Elections	Why do you think Obama's grandmother and other family says he was born at Coast General Hos Mombasa, Kenya ?	Do they not want him to be president ? Do they not understand the disastrous implications of their assertions ?         http://www.israelenews.com/view.asp?ID=3...          Coast Provincial General Hospital, Mombasa, Kenya      Update 2, 10/12/08 10:40 AM ET:  Since originally posting this story Saturday,  Atty. Philip Berg’s office informed us that they cannot discuss this matter due to pending litigation, which is understandable.  They also informed us that Berg is NOT collaborating with Ed Hale, moderator of a site, “Hillary Clinton Supporters for John McCain” and host of a radio show.  We have had no direct contact with Ed Hale, and have no idea whether he’s truthful or not.   Whether or not the “tip” we received is accurate, only time will tell.  At this time, we have no further independent verification. However, the reason we published this story and the reason we will keep the story on this blog is that the language in Berg’s filing — which is a matter of public record — is specific about the Kenyan birth place, and we assume that the claim is based on something besides wishful thinking.      Update 1, 10/11/08: Please note that the information about the Kenyan BC is based on a tip that has not yet been verified. The information about the lawsuit is confirmed, and was taken from the court record.   Judah Benjamin’s analysis follows the Foreword.      TD Foreword:  Those who have followed this blog know that our working assumption has been that Barack Obama was born in Hawaii.  We have asserted that Obama’s legal name and citizenship changed when he was adopted by Lolo Soetoro, and that the birth certificate image published on Obama’s campaign website does not reflect current records. You can read the previous articles referenced at the end of this post to catch up on our analysis.      We now wonder if our assumption about Obama’s birth place was wrong.      I have received an unverified tip that certified copies of a Kenyan Birth Certificate (BC) for Obama were sent from Kenya, and have been received by three separate individuals. I am told that these documents are certified, with an embossed seal, and display the name of the hospital where Obama was born, as well as witness signatures.      Reportedly this BC reflects information filed Oct. 9 by Philip Berg. See item #18 on this docket, page 10, the relevant language of which, underlined in red, is captured here in a screen shot:      It reads:          …Obama was born at Coast Hospital in Mombasa, Kenya located in Coast Province…      We do not currently have any additional confirmation of this new information. If it is an accurate tip, the implications are disastrous for Senator Obama and his backers. For that analysis, we proceed to Judah Benjamin…       http://texasdarlin.wordpress.com/2008/10...

I hadn't really noticed.....as a "typical Republican" I don't pay that much attention to the top 1/64th of an inch of a person, but someone just posted here asking if people were voting for him because he is White.

20081003053934AAQPLYF	Politics & Government;Elections	Why Did Joe Biden Do This During The Debate?	  Joe Biden claimed McCain signed / didn't sign etc.  bills-  10 times he was WRONG,  it was looked up by Carl Rove-   Carl even said there was 3 other statements Biden made that were debatable-  such as the claim Obama wrote a letter to regulate Fannie Mae.     Obama had the CEO of Fannie Mae as a advisor / Also Obama has been greatly involved with ACORN that got a majority of the BAD LOANS.  So I very much DOUBT Obama tried to regulate them-   McCain was the one who has PROOF of a statement he said in 05' that Fannie needed to have regulations.

They keep their guns and the "Takers" don't even try to get them.....its the people whose taxes will be needed to pay for those programs that will revolt and therefore need to be disarmed....THAT'S why the drive to "Disarm America" has always been spearheaded by the "Elite Democrat" type of liberal..Kennedy,Obama,Feinstein,Schumer... their minions,of course...the Rosie's and others of that ilk... why you think only the honest and the helpless should be disarmed?

20090131104509AAzRtoZ	Politics & Government;Immigration	Can I get a work Visa to United States?	Case background of entity ABC:       I had my H1B stamped through a company XX, though I did not intend to go to US and didnt even know when the company filed my H1 petition. Then I left the company XX and joined the company YY. I had to undergo a short training in US for which the company YY asked me to file B1/B2 to enable me to visit US. I secured B1/B2 (with multiple entries) and since then have traveled to US four times during my career span.       I joined company ZZ, and during background check process it was understood that my bachelors degree could not be verified with the concerned university and it was tagged as 'invalid'. So later on, I removed 'graduation' entry from my profile. My profile now states that I am not a graduate. Now my question is, will I be eligible for H1 visa considering the above history. Now I have total 11 years of IT experience but will the consulate allow me to file H1 considering the fact that during previous two visa filing, it seems the education information now stands wrong in their database. Please advise.      Education background:      I had given my graduation through a private institute after formally completing 12 + 1 year of study. But the unfortunate part was, the said institute was not affiliated with any university and the degree that I got in the name of 'official' university turned out to be fake. I inquired with the institute and it seems they wound up their business and fled. Now this has put a black stigma on my profile.   Now though I have honestly removed the graduation entry from my profile after the failed background check, but really want to know whether I can persue an IT career in US.        I have secured the following other IT qualifications:       Advanced Diploma course from National Institute of Information Technology (NIIT) - five semesters   Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE)   Sun Certified Java Professional - v2 and v6 (SCJP)   Sun Certified Web Component Developer (SCWCD)   Sun Certified Business Component Developer (SCBCD)   Sun Certified Enterprise Architect - Part 1 (SCEA)   NSE - Beginners Financial Module (NSE) - Non IT       Like I have no 'all-out' plan to move to US, but would like to consider given an option.        Thank you

These things are poorly cut and edited which means it takes probably an hour of his time for a 5 minute video. Stop making videos and whoring yourself on the internet and do your job! Does anybody think this is stupid? He's not campaigning anymore and if he has something important to say then he should say it live on TV. He just sits and reads a teleprompter and tells us things we already know. Am I the only one who thinks this is a big waste of time?        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDfpd8GV9...     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTrp-GKG9... 
20090131120725AAytOHz	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Why do cops CREATE trouble when they can't find any?	Before you write this off as a biased question, let me describe a few incidents I've encountered in the past 5 years or so:      Incident #1: I was driving home with my 14 year old sister from a concert that was about 2 hours away. An officer pulled me over, citing that I had a broken tail light. However, when my sister gave him her name and date of birth upon his request, he said something "wasn't right with this picture" since I was 23. He called for backup, and they had me sit in the back of his cruiser while she sat in the back of the other one. We had to sit there for a solid FORTY FIVE minutes while the dispatcher at their office repeatedly rang our parents' house. When my dad finally returned home and answered the phone, he confirmed that he was aware of the situation, and that we were in fact brother and sister. It was only after then we were released. You know, perhaps not ALL men over 21 are pedophiles simply because they are with a teenager!      Incident #2: I was standing in line at a nightclub when I was told by the bouncer that the price to get in had gone up. He also added that if I was going to use an ATM that I had better hurry up because they were locking the doors at 12--sparing me exactly 7 minutes. I ran like hell up the street for the atm, and right as I arrived, I was surrounded by police officers who shouted for me to get my hands up. They asked why I was running so wildly like that, and demanded identification. Not satisified with my explanation, they made me sit in their cruiser for about 30 mins while others scanned around the area for a evidence of a crime. Afterwards, I was released...and needless to say, my night was ruined.      Incident #3: About 2 or so in the morning, I was in the parking lot of a public park (keyword: PUBLIC, meaning I wasn't trespassing), and I had fallen asleep in my car whilst waiting to meet up with a friend. I was suddenly awoken by an officer tapping on my window. He asked what I was doing there, and claimed he was there because he'd received report of a "suspicious vehicle." He and another officer searched my vehicle and then left. How the hell was I suspicious by snoozing in my car in the lot of a public park?      Incident #4: I was with an assembly crew that was taking apart amusement rides at a fair. We all finished around 2 in the morning, and I headed for my car that was in an empty parking lot. As I was fumbling for my keys, an officer rolled up and, once again, asked for identification and the car registration.      You know, all blame aside, I thought the police were serve and protect--not harass and annoy! Is that what they are taught in police academy...to go make trouble if they cannot find any?

20090131123117AAJHxM3	Politics & Government;Politics	Obama's Superbowl Party & Freezing Americans (Part 2)?	I was unsatisfied with the responses I got in my last question, perhaps because I didn't clarify myself well enough. Most people pointed out that it's a governor's job to handle state emergencies, and others pointed out that Obama has sent in FEMA so what else can he do?  You also said "Just because you haven't heard about Obama helping these people doesn't mean he hasn't." And while all of that is certainly true, it does not help his approval ratings when no one is aware of it due to a lack of communication. This is where I'm frustrated!      I was looking at this more from a public relations point of view, I suppose. While the governors have the most important role in all of this and FEMA has begun rescue operations, I am still surprised and disappointed by Obama's lack of a public address regarding the whole thing. Sure, a public statement may not "help" those in need, but it would at least let them (and their families) know that the government is aware of the problem and doing all they can.      And seriously.....  the whole superbowl party thing just seems in POOR TASTE while entire families are freezing to death in their homes. As I said before, I'm a huge Obama supporter, but this just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Do you see my point? I know the man has a million issues on his plate right now, but things like this just can't fall through the cracks. What happened to the flawless PR team he had working for him during the campaign?       End rant. :)

20090131114122AAmhn3k	Politics & Government;Politics	Can anyone tell me why the question below would have been deleted by yahoo?	Why did our President waste his time yesterday?      Meeting with Republicans about his "bail out" package, agreeing to compromise and remove things they didn't agree with and added things they wanted him to, when they voted 100% thumbs down? I find it very interesting that they had no problem voting for the money Bush wanted over and over again which did nothing but feed the rich and still left out main street. Yet Obama's plan has something for everyone, including fixing America's infrastructure, ie: bridges, highways and everything else that makes life convenient for Americans.       If they were sending a message, they now know their message went nowhere, except to the American people, that in spite of losing the election and seeing their party crumbling, that they have no intention of changing, or are interested in bipartisanship.      Why can't they understand that continuing to behave this way is going to make things even worse for their party and if they continue to shrug off the President Americans voted for they will cease to be a political party in this country.      Obama has done everything to include them in his cabinet, decision making and has reached across party lines, just like he said he would and the Republicans continue to act like they are an exclusive, elite club.      The truth is the Democrats no longer need them to pass anything, yet Obama still wanted their participation. Maybe when they lose again in 2012, it might sink in, although I really doubt it.       If this country goes into another great depression, which is the way it's looking, Americans aren't going to blame the Democrats. They learned the hard way after 8 years of Bush's lies, manipulation and corruption. They'll blame the Republicans now that they know what the Republican leadership is. Stuck up, stuck in the 20th. century and stuck in their way of thinking.

20090131113333AAFFR7J	Politics & Government;Immigration	How often am I allowed to re enter to the US on B1/B2 visa?	Hi,   I have a B1/B2 (Visitor/Business) 10 years multiple entry visa to the US (will expire only in 2017)    I came to the US to visit my boyfriend’s family in late Sept 2008. I had plans to stay with him until March 2009, since legally I am allowed to spend 6months here on every entry!    Very recently we changed our plans and got married. Now, I am preparing the paperwork for the following Forms                1. Petition for Alien Relative (USCIS Form I-130)            2. Application to Register Permanent Residence (USCIS Form I-485)            3. Biographic Information (USCIS Form G-325A)            4. Affidavit of Support (USCIS Form I-864)            5. Permission for Work Authorization (Optional) (USCIS Form I-765)            6. Medical Examination Results (USCIS Form I-693)            7. Request for Travel Documents (Optional) (USCIS Form I-131)            8. The appropriate supporting documents              I am still waiting for my birth certificate and my medical records to be sent from my home country. So in the meantime I plan to file the Form i-130 and file the rest once I have all the documents ready.    I was hoping to file i-130 about a month ago but got delayed due to some of my husband’s documents.       We had planned a cheap Honeymoon for mid Feb to a country where I don’t need a visa to get in and we thought that re-entering the USA will give me 6 more months to file all the applications and wait for my change of status.    I am an Asian Indian who married a US Citizen while I was visiting on a Visitor/Business visa.. Since plenty of Indians keep trying to migrate out, my story sounds pretty complex.       Now I have 3 Questions:   A. Will I have trouble re-entering the US after just a week long trip to Central America? Technically multiple entry visa allows me to enter but they might question me or come up with some paperwork that I am missing.    B. there’s a mistake (with the year) on my Form I-94 (my last date to was supposed to be 11 March 2009 but it is 2008) and they wrote March with a felt pen instead of a Stamp!    Will this be a problem while exiting?   C. And If we submit Form I-130 and then go for our trip, will USCIS send me any receipt (or proof of record) that I can show the customs when I am back from this trip? I mean can I prove that I am an applicant for an Immigrant visa so they let me re-enter?         Now, considering all goes will and I am allowed to re-enter after my honeymoon. And if I have already submitted Form i-130 before I left for this trip. The information related to my Form I-94 (my last day of legal stay in the US) in both my Forms I-130 and I-485 will be different. Is that a problem?      Any suggestions or related experiences will be highly appreciated.

I have been considering entering service in the military, and from the descriptions and information I've found, it seems like the special forces role is the one I'd be most interested in. I'm pretty good with language, and able to assess and analyze situations pretty accurately, along with being able to memorize information easily, proven by my graduating high school with a 3.5 without ever really trying to hard. However, the only athletics I've ever participated in when in high school was cross-country running. Therefore I'm rather on the weak side, especially from a military perspective: 5'7" about 150 lbs. So I'm wondering which is the more important quality to bring into training: natural physical prowess or intellect and determination? It seems as though I'd be able to bulk up as long as I had the drive to get through the rigorous and numerous training courses required to make rank, but the mental ability has to be innate, right?

First, I was driving home the other night from purchasing a car from a private owner.  I had inspected the car during the day time so I didn't think to check the rear tailights to make sure they were working.  It took a while to finish the deal so I didn't leave his home till about 4pm and took about 2 hours to get home due to traffic etc.      I got pulled over while I was almost home and the state trooper told me I could bring a reciept showing it is fixed or pay the ticket.  I showed him the bill of sale to prove I had JUST bought the car.  He said he couldnt promise it would be dismissed if I brought in proof of fixing it however.       Can I win this case? I know negligence is not an excuse but considering the circumstances, I would think it would be dismissed.      Secondly,       How easy is it to change the court date and time? I'll be out of town that week so I need to reschedule.. does changing the court date hurt my chances of dismissal?

The "guns" are worn on opposite sides of the belt, one might think that an officer intending to use their Taser would draw it with their NON-shooting hand, and then MAKE CERTAIN that they pulled the correct weapon. One wouldn't want to mistakenly shoot or even kill someone. Seems that these police aren't given enough training, this becomes apparent if even one death has occurred in this manner.  Or maybe its that the ones who mistakenly shot and/or killed unarmed people just didn't care enough to double check...

20090131141623AAYAe12	Politics & Government;Elections	How can you libs defend Obamas connection to ACORN "vote early and vote often"?	He has worked for/with ACORN for many years,he wants to give them 4.1 BILLION in the new "stimulus" package...IF we were just talking about a few people who made up a few names to make a few more dollars...That would be no big deal,but LOOK AT THE FACTS...State    Year    Details     AR  1998  A contractor with ACORN-affiliated Project Vote was arrested for falsifying about 400 voter registration cards.   CO  2004  An ACORN employee admitted to forging signatures and registering three of her friends to vote 40 times.      2005  Two ex-ACORN employees were convicted in Denver of perjury for submitting false voter registrations.   FL  2004  A Florida Department of Law Enforcement spokesman said ACORN was “singled out” among suspected voter registration groups for a 2004 wage initiative because it was “the common thread” in the agency’s fraud investigations.   MI  2004  The Detroit Free Press reported that “overzealous or unscrupulous campaign workers in several Michigan counties are under investigation for voter-registration fraud, suspected of attempting to register nonexistent people or forging applications for already-registered voters.” ACORN-affiliate Project Vote was one of two groups suspected of turning in the documents.   MO  2007  Four ACORN employees were indicted in Kansas City for charges including identity theft and filing false registrations during the 2006 election.    2006  Eight ACORN employees in St. Louis were indicted on federal election fraud charges. Each of the eight faces up to five years in prison for forging signatures and submitting false information.    2003  Of 5,379 voter registration cards ACORN submitted in St. Louis, only 2,013 of those appeared to be valid. At least 1,000 are believed to be attempts to register voters illegally.   NC  2004  North Carolina officials investigated ACORN for submitting fake voter registration cards.   NM  2005  Four ACORN employees submitted as many as 3,000 potentially fraudulent signatures on the group’s Albuquerque ballot initiative. A local sheriff added: “It’s safe to say the forgery was widespread.”      2004  An ACORN employee registered a 13-year-old boy to vote. Citing this and other examples, New Mexico State Representative Joe Thompson stated that ACORN was “manufacturing voters” throughout New Mexico.   OH  2007  A man in Reynoldsburg was indicted on two felony counts of illegal voting and false registration, after being registered by ACORN to vote in two separate counties.    2004  A grand jury indicted a Columbus ACORN worker for submitting a false signature and false voter registration form. In Franklin County, two ACORN workers submitted what the director of the board of election supervisors called “blatantly false” forms. In Cuyahoga County, ACORN and its affiliate Project Vote submitted registration cards that had the highest rate of errors for any voter registration group.   MN  2004  During a traffic stop, police found more than 300 voter registration cards in the trunk of a former ACORN employee, who had violated a legal requirements that registration cards be submitted to the Secretary of State within 10 days of being filled out and signed.   PA  2008  An ACORN employee in West Reading, PA, was sentenced to up to 23 months in prison for identity theft and tampering with records. A second ACORN worker pleaded not guilty to the same charges and is free on $10,000 bail.    2004  Reading’s Director of Elections received calls from numerous individuals complaining that ACORN employees deliberately put inaccurate information on their voter registration forms. The Berks County director of elections said voter fraud was “absolutely out of hand,” and added: “Not only do we have unintentional duplication of voter registration but we have blatant duplicate voter registrations.” The Berks County deputy director of elections added that ACORN was under investigation by the Department of Justice.   TX  2004  ACORN turned in the voter registration form of David Young, who told reporters “The signature is not my signature. It’s not even close.” His social security number and date of birth were also incorrect.   VA  2005  In 2005, the Virginia State Board of Elections admonished Project Vote and ACORN for turning in a significant number of faulty voter registrations. An audit revealed that 83% of sampled registrations that were rejected for carrying false or questionable information were submitted by Project Vote. Many of these registrations carried social security numbers that exist for other people, listed non-existent or commercial addresses, or were for convicted felons in violation of state and federal election law.      In a letter to ACORN, the State Board of Elections reported that 56% of the voter registration applications ACORN turned in were ineligible. Further, a full 35% were not submitted in a timely manner, as required by law. The State Board of Elections also commented on what appeared to be evidence of intentional voter fraud.

20090131135805AAsbUxP	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Were you ever unable to get back a retainer from a lawyer who did no work?	I know one person who hired two attorneys in a row, paying them $500 retainer each, to file a law suit relating to a neighbors' having taken down a fence and then putting in a new one over the property line.   The only work both lawyers did was to "advise" him not to pursue the lawsuit.   So, he did the lawsuit himself, without a lawyer, against the neighbors, the title insurance company, and the surveyor who misrepresented the border. After being intimidated by a judge who wanted him to drop the case (and then the judge remembered he had a conflict of interest and recused himself), then the case was about to go before a jury trial. At that point, the other side settled, and a quit claim deed was obtained from the infringing neighbors.   But the two lawyers who took the retainers never returned any money.

20090131141407AApYFv9	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	So THIS is a stimulus pkg?	HAHAHAHAHA  Provisions of the bill that many legislators are questioning:       $1 billion for Amtrak, which hasnt earned a profit in four decades.       $2 billion to help subsidize child care.       $400 million for research into global warming.       $2.4 billion for projects to demonstrate how carbon greenhouse gas can be safely removed from the atmosphere.       $650 million for coupons to help consumers convert their TV sets from analog to digital, part of the digital TV conversion.       $600 million to buy a new fleet of cars for federal employees and government departments.       $75 million to fund programs to help people quit smoking.       $21 million to re-sod the National Mall, which suffered heavy use during the Inauguration.       $2.25 billion for national parks. This item has sparked calls for an investigation, because the chief lobbyist of the National Parks Association is the son of Rep. David R. Obey, D-Wisc. The $2,25 billion is about equal to the National Park Services entire annual budget. The Washington Times reports it is a threefold increase over what was originally proposed for parks in the stimulus bill. Obey is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.       $335 million for treatment and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases.       $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts. $4.19 billion to stave off foreclosures via the Neighborhood Stabilization Program. The bill allows nonprofits to compete with cities and states for $3.44 billion of the money, which means a substantial amount of it will be captured by ACORN, the controversial activist group currently under federal investigation for vote fraud. Another $750 million would be exclusively reserved for nonprofits such as ACORN  meaning cities and states are barred from receiving that money. Sen. David Vitter, R-La., charges the money could appear to be a payoff for the partisan political activities community groups in the last election cycle.       $44 million to renovate the headquarters building of the Agriculture Department.       $32 billion for a smart electricity grid to minimize waste.       $87 billion of Medicaid funds, to aid states.       $53.4 billion for science facilities, high speed Internet, and miscellaneous energy and environmental programs.       $13 billion to repair and weatherize public housing, help the homeless, repair foreclosed homes.       $20 billion for quicker depreciation and write-offs for equipment.       $10.3 billion for tax credits to help families defray the cost of college tuition.       $20 billion over five years for an expanded food stamp program.     Republican leaders say the stimulus package will add 32 new government programs at a cost of $136 billion. They object that many of the programs, once established, are likely to continue indefinitely.     Most media outlets are reporting the cost of the package at $819 billion. As Newsmax revealed yesterday, however, the Congressional Budget Office calculates that the interest on the debt generated by the bills spending will cost another $347.1 billion, making the total cost approximately $1.17 trillion.

I find it ironic that people are dieing across America from "Record" freezing cold temperatures...      The state of Kentucky has thousands of people without power from the ice storm, it looks like a frozen wasteland out there.      When Al Gore came to press his global warming agendas this week it was pouring down snow in Washington Dc.      2008/2009 broke plenty of record cold temperatures, and it’s forecasted to get colder this year.       So why do Liberals and people like Al Gore keep ramming Global "Warming" down our throats?      Why waste our tax dollars on a myth, or a lie, what some call the biggest scam in world history…?      There is even Billions of taxpayer dollars in spending from Obama's so called economic stimulus package going to NASA to study climate change.      If it is really getting colder why should we be preparing for “warming” which is the complete opposite…?      Do they secretly want for the food crops to be sitting in frost, and for us all to die and freeze to death while they plan to scare the hell out of people and feed us fear.. over global warming, when really in reality we could be slowly slipping into an ice age?      =\       http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con...        http://www.realclearpolitics.com/article... 
20090131143741AAzCBrD	Politics & Government;Government	Protectionism, the only answer?	The Government condemn protectionism on the grounds of World trade, but is this just a ploy to ensure that they and their friends,  the Banks, do not lose out on the rich pickings of the exchange mechanism?      The more we import the greater the profit for the Banks, but fewer jobs and less prosperity for the population.      Domestically produced goods mean British jobs, prosperity for British workers and security of employment for future generations. A brighter future for all, not just the fortunate few.      The British economy has been reliant on greedy retailers buying cheap Chinese products and selling them at high prices on the High St, whilst British industry decayed away into dereliction. The outcome was inevitable, retail collapsed and with it the economy.      The Government is powerless, compared with the might of the British consumer, who can reinstate the UK as a major industrial power,with high levels of employment and an affluent population by buying genuine British products. The positive effects on education, social responsibility and reduction in crime, would address the sickness in our Nation.      Its the only answer, but one that will never be implemented by those only interested in feathering their own nest.      What do YOU think?

20090131143801AAis1Uy	Politics & Government;Politics	Do YOU honestly think Capitalism works?	That is it.   This question:    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    had broke my back.   Does anyone realize that Obama is trying to help this country?   Yet no one wants to change.   It seems everyone thinks Obama's plan is communism and communism is evil.   Obama is trying to find something better than communism and capitalism.   But people think capitalism works. Ha-Ha. Have YOU seen the economy today? I keep telling people capitalism nor communism works but you still think I'm wrong.   I tell you why we NEED something different.      For the last 8-6 years the economy has been on the downside. I tell why it has been on the downside: Greed. It is the only problem with all economic systems. People will get greedy and take more than what they need. Both Capitalism and Socialism allows this. If it is Socialism then the government will be greedy. If it is Capitalism then the people (Or CEOs and business people) will be greedy. We need to stop people or the government from being greedy. That is what Obama is trying to do. Yet GOP and some people won't help. Now you think "OH people have the right to be greedy and get as much money as they want" Well look around you! Do you see anyone getting money? Do you see the unemployment line? Like President Obama said:      "Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control -- and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous." -President Barrack Obama.      So do you people think Capitalism still works?   Because Capitalism won't allow a "Watchful eye". People will do anything to get more money no mater if the government keeps a "watchful" eye.   You people probably will delete my question but as long as the unemployment lines grows along with fat cat's wallets I will still hate capitalism.      I put this in politics because that is where I get the most heat at
20090225090226AAbKI2g	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	What should I do - go to jail/do community service or move?	I'm 17 years old. I have anger issues and have gotten into several fights these past few weeks. When I was 15, I was given a citation and was warned that the next time I get into a fight I could possibly face prison time. Well, last week, there were a few guys hanging around my street in the city. I tried to ignore them, but was jumped as I walked to the store. I decided to fight back, and severely beat one of them. However, the police soon arrived, and the guys (except for the hurt one) ran off. Now, the guy I hurt was lying on the ground, and I was standing over him. The police immediately arrested me. I'm facing up to six months in a juvenile detention center, and a mandatory 30 hours of community service.  They have, however, given me the option to leave the area. My mother wants to send me out west to some relatives. They're really strict, and send their kids to private school. I'm afraid to leave, but I'm also afraid of prison. Also, it's possible that I might not get any jail time. Do you think I should tough it out or live with my relatives for a while?

He was living alone with just his 2 kids,ages5 and 6 for abourt a year.   He filled out his app for apt and was given a subsidy of "0" dollars for his rent,based on his income from unemployment.   This means he pays NOTHING for a 2 bedroon apt!!   But just about 6 mths ago,his girlfriend moved in,also on unemployment,and has not reported her income to state or landlord.She refuses to report anything because i feel she knows rent will be raised!   Now they both have NO RENT,FREE FOOD because of welfare,and their utilities are paid by state.   They both claim poor but they are not.   Since they have NO bills,they have all this money left over each month.   They go on spending sprees,each week.Im talking hundreds and hundreds of dollars are spent on screen tv"S,computer,bunkbeds for kids and so on.   And this is every month!!   I have no problem with anyone on welfare,but these 2 are abusing the system!   They even joke on how they are getting over on government.   If they can spend 4-5 hundred a month on luxaries,why cant they pay some rent and get off welfare?   What do i do?   Do i report them.   Im upset because there are families out there who need a place to live.   Ive seen ppl turned away from here because its full!   To me,this is a travesty!!   Its under usda rural development as far as subsidy!   Am i wrong if i report them?   They live in nj.

The name on file was my birth name (Barbour) and according to the records after my adoption and legal name change to Adams someone came in to an office a state away from where I live and changed it back to Barbour. Evidence leads me to suspect my birth mother changed it.

I guess next he'll tell us about the 57 states, the 100,000 people killed in Greensburg Kansas, and how Al gore invented the internet.      What's next......"I did not have sex with that woman"

I am a 40% disabled veteran with 7 service connected conditions and I have IRR muster orders. I get $541 a month tax free in disability from the VA but I was never separated from the IRR even though my condition would make it imposible to be a soldier again. The muster has a stipened of $190 which taxable and my VA comp is not so how would this impact me?       I have bad lung problems that cause my lungs to close from cold air, and knee issues so bad that I can not stand for long periods.
20090225093941AAxuoiT	Politics & Government;Elections	PIYUSH Jindal opposes same sex marriage but supports incest?	I had an Indian boss once and he explained that in Indian culture, the marriages are arranged and they marry their cousins!   He told me his wife was actually his cousin (3rd or 4th cousin).      From Wikipedia:   Jindal opposes the legalization of same-sex marriage, and has voted for the Federal Marriage Amendment to restrict marriage to a union between one man and one woman.[38] In December 2008, Jindal announced the formation of the Louisiana Commission on Marriage and Family, including individuals representing organizations that oppose same-sex marriage, including Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, Gene Mills, the executive director of the Louisiana Family Forum and Mike Johnson, senior legal counsel for the Alliance Defense Fund.[39]      So, how can the GOP exalt PIYUSH Jindal if he's against same sex marriage but PRACTICES incest?      Thoughts?
20090225092834AArLyvO	Politics & Government;Elections	Why is the GOP hanging their hopes on someone 'inspired' by 'The Brady Bunch'?	PIYUSH Jindal (the NEXT GOP minority poster child) got his nickname from 'The Brady Bunch'      According to family lore, Jindal chose to re-name himself "Bobby" inspired by the sitcom character Bobby Brady after watching The Brady Bunch television series at the age of four. He has been known by his self-adopted nickname ever since—as a civil servant, politician, student, and writer—though legally his name remains Piyush Jindal.      Why is the GOP hanging their hopes on someone 'inspired' by 'The Brady Bunch'?
20090225092229AArUwrz	Politics & Government;Elections	Why is PIYUSH Jindal's Hindu upbringing acceptable but Obama's Christian upbringing isn't?	PIYUSH Jindal was raised Hindu but converted to Catholicism.   The GOP and their members have no issue with it.      Obama has been Christian all his life, yet he is ridiculed, threatened ('kill him'), called Muslim.      When this difference is called out it gets ignored.      Why the hypocrisy?

20090225092516AA0fSp3	Politics & Government;Politics	How could a FLAT TAX possibly be unfair?	Please explain to me how a flat tax regardless of your income is unfair.  When over 98% of the taxes in this country are paid by the top 50% of income earners, while those complaining the loudest get a tax REFUND at the end of the year, it's obvious that things need to be balanced out.        SIDE NOTE:  No more tax deductions, no more write offs, no more tax loop holes, no more nonsense.  You simply pay a flat percentage on every dollar earned.  Simple as that. So before you complain about how only the rich would benefit, think about how much MORE they would be paying without all the write offs and tax shelters!

20090225092554AAYZTsY	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Why was this case dismissed?	David McEvay, the six-year-old plaintiff, missed the school bus that went to his school one morning. His mother went part way on the bus with him that morning and gave him instructions on how to get there and the importance of cross-walks. His father also pointed out the dangers of being hit by a car. Before the mother got off the bus, she asked the bus driver, Norman if he would drop David off at the school. Norman agreed and let the boy off the bus with the clear instruction to cross the road at the cross-walk behind the bus and to be careful. The little boy agreed, but ignored his comment and ran around the front of the bus instead and was hit by a car driven by the defendant, Samantha, and owned by Margaret. The boy was thrown and severely injured. The defendant was driving at the same speed as the other traffic, 40 km/h, and witnesses testified to this fact at the trial. The posted speed limit was 50 km/h on the road signs.      The plaintiff and his "next friend" brought an action for damages sustained in the accident to the British Columbian supreme court, but his action was dismissed. He then appealed the dismissal to the Court of Appeal, where it was also dismissed.      Who did the plaintiff sue in this action, and why? Should the bus driver have been required to get out of his bus and help David across the road? Why or why not? Could the boy's actions have been expected or anticipated by Samantha? Why was David's case dismissed by the trial judge?Why did the boy appeal this dismissal to the Court of Appeal? Why did the court of appeal dismiss McEvay's appeal?
