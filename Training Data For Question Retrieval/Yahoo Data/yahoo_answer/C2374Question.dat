I know the subjects in America are different so I'd like to know what she should be doing, there's a lot of fantasy and magic stuff happening in the story but I'd like to write about the ordinary stuff that happens in her life too to make the story realistic. So far I've got her doing English and Biology. Plus I'd like to know about the history subjects, In Australia we have both modern and ancient history as separate subjects as both are taught and assessed differently, what about in America?      I'd like my story be as detailed and accurate as possible

This sermon is a sensational message and an example of Billy Sunday's opposition to the liquor trade, saloons, and alcohol consumption. Sunday is credited with being one of the most influential advocates of Prohibition during 1920's in the USA.   Billy Sunday (1862-1935), was a professional baseball player from 1883 to 1891 for Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia teams. He was converted through the street preaching of Harry Monroe of the Pacific Garden Mission in Chicago. He left a $5,000 a year salary as a baseball player for a $75 a month for the previously evangelistic YMCA. From 1893 to 1895 was associated with J. Wilbur Chapman. He was an evangelist from 1893 to 1935. It is estimated that over 300,000 people walked the "sawdust trail" to receive Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord. (Adapted from "The Wycliffe Biographical Dictionary of the Church," page 387, Elgin S. Moyer, 1982, ?Moody Press, Chicago, IL)

I sat exams in maths, phys and bio this jan and get my results back in mid-march. I am very pleased with how bio went however deeply concerned at how badly the exams went for me in maths and phys. I genuinely dread the results when they arrive in 2 weeks time and honestly believe I have a U in both papers. Please don't tell me to 'breathe' or 'calm down and stop fretting' because it will do no good. I know I haven't performed as well as I can but realise if I do get a U, I'll be asked to leave the course; and I can't contemplate that especially in such essential subjects like maths and physics.   I don't know what to do and will probably cry. I think i've achieved the lowest mark in my class and cannot bear leaving.   If I was to gain an E in both, I would be so ecstatic because I would therefore be able to stay on as E is regarded as a pass. I know i'm better than that though...   What should I do when I receive my inevitable bad results?

20090226120726AAcmDgO	Education & Reference;Teaching	Becoming friends with my art teacher?	I love  my art teacher D: (not IN love, but love him as a teacher)      But there's a huge age difference, and I really doubt he would want to be friends with me because of that. Which I really want. I want to know how to get a hold of his email to contact him when I leave high school in 2010.   I think we would get on great though. D: We both love art (obviously) and I'm sure he's into classical music just like I am (I'm 16, EVERYONE makes fun of me because I love classical like Mozart, Back, Beethoven and Pavarotti.)      Anyways, how would I be able to become friends with him without mentioning.   I doubt there really is a way to get this. I'm sure he doesn't want some 16 year old girl as a friend, especially in-case it jeopardizes his career by people accusing him of being  a pedophile etc, that's the last thing I want, he's fantastic!      Help?      (note that this IS NOT to boost my grades in anyways, I'm already the highest in my Intermediate 2 Art class, I got the highest total in the mock exam for design, historical and expressive work, I got a B , he said I could have gotten an A, I was only 7 marks off)

The guy at the reception said only ￡30. The three of them payed ￡10 each.  Later the guy at the reception realises that the room was ￡25 so he sends a waiter to their room with a ￡5 note. On the way the waiter doesn't know how to divide 5 into 3. So he decides to give all three men ￡1and keep the other ￡2. Then that would mean the three men payed ￡9 each, altogether is ￡27. And the waiter has the other ￡2. Which adds up to ￡29. Where did the other ￡1 go?         Its really tricky. I tried to figure it out but can't. It almost seems impossible to solve.

20081103182803AAWSpZK	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Is this paragraph grammatically correct?	Liberals tend to respect the separation of church and state more than conservatives and are primarily pro-choice. They believe that the rights of the mother are more imperative than the rights of the fetus. The public view that liberals favor larger government is untrue in the case of abortion. In this case, liberals feel that the government has no right to dictate decisions concerning a person’s body. A large portion of liberals also find it ironic that many conservatives do not want sex education in school, and want less access to birth control, which ultimately leads to more unwanted pregnancies.

I'm very good at my instrument.  I've been playing oboe since 5th grade, have achieved All-State levels and have gotten many awards, but due to budget cuts at my school my outstanding band director has been cut and replaced with a guy who doesn't care about us and makes us play pathetically simple pieces.  Next year is my senior year and I'm thinking of dropping oboe.  Instead, I'd take Sociology/Psychology and East Asian Civilizations (hopefully honors, if enough people sign up).  I'll still continue oboe outside of school, but I won't be able to try out for All-State and won't be able to say that I stuck with my instrument for all 4 years.  Is this as big a deal as some people make it out to be?

20090226121200AAAea3g	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can someone please help me edit/proofread my paragraphs?	Ok so for these im supposed to write a paragraph for each one. the first one is supposed to be talking about what colors i favor and why  the second one is supposed to be a picture of a color evoking an emotion and a paragraph to describe the emotions.            1  The two colors I tend to favor the most are yellow and red, both of these hues are versatile and when either of them is incorporated into a room’s design they can have drastically different results. Yellow when used in a space adds a bright cheery atmosphere. A lighter yellow is fresh and upbeat, while a golden shade can be elegant and regal. Depending on the intensity of the shade, red can also be used in a number of ways to evoke emotions from a space. A pastel pink is feminine and soft while an intense red is dramatic and commands attention. Both colors when used properly can be wonderful elements to the overall feeling of a designed space.         2     A color that I feel can awaken strong emotions when used in a part of a rooms design is the color blue. Blue can evoke feelings of tranquility and peace, leaving the mind calm and serene. The blue can also mirror colors found in nature such as that of the ocean and the sky. The color can help banish feelings of stress and instill a sense of rejuvenation of the mind. Lighter shades have an optimistic aura and darker more intense shades signify sincerity and loyalty. The various emotions and total calming effects of blue make it a color that can leave you feeling refreshed and at peace.

Terraced houses line each side of the narrow streets    and the sound of raindrops on tiled roofs constantly drum in my ears.    The streets are totally empty, not even the odd car or person breaks    the monotony of the black tarmac. A rusty iron fence surrounds the    small park by the houses and the play area is deserted and broken. The    sky is dark and overcast, with the occasional roll of thunder rumbling    in the distance.                  By ten o'clock my shift at the local supermarket is over and I have to    begin the long, mind-numbing walk home. The supermarket car park is    covered in red, yellow and brown leaves from the old trees at the side    of the road and I struggle across the slippery surface until I reach    the dark subway that leads under the main road to the terraces. The    subway walls are covered in graffiti while broken bottles and    cigarette ends line the floor. I always feel slightly nervous when    walking through this subway; as is something watch my every moved.   Five minutes into the subway and my hands were trembling.   I could smell the adrenaline combine with the smoke coming from the   sewer's, as I pay attention to my surroundings I saw shadows through the thick smoke.   There it was a man standing in front of the subway rails, as the light of the    heavy train made disappear his shadow; I stand there alone watching him    as a bright green light illuminates the whole place just before the hits him, he vanished.    I stood there motionless waiting for a sound of pain or agony, still thinking that he was hit. When I get close enough to see if there is any   remaining, I found nothing but a black box. Not knowing what it is I picked   it up and get out of the train tracks. At home trying to figure out what just   happened back there I fall asleep. As I wake up, I hear a faint noise coming   from downstairs. Is the box? I asked myself.    Armed with my baseball bat I make my way downstairs, like I suspected it was the black square. It was glowing. When I reach to touch it   I see the same light like I did the day before, just minutes before that guy disappeared. When I get a hold of it, I emerge to some strange world fill with colors and sound that I had never seen nor hear.   Still astonish with this new world, I’m fill with this new filling that I never felt before. When I glanced back I see shadow while  spacing out. Regaining conscience I find myself running away from this bestial image.    I found cover and rock myself back and forth trying to make some sense out of this reality, when I calm down I decide to go explore. I walk for hours but still no sign of any human or something near close enough.   Hours later at what it seem the end of the day I see some light coming from far away. I decide to follow this fair chance of hope; I found a window to my room. Entirely disoriented I reach but I cant go through, I turn back to think what to do and there it is.    The beast, that black frightening thing staring at me as if it was trying to get me. Only having to choices run or stay and see my ending. I reach to this creature that follows my every move, preparing to attack. When I get a good at it, I can see that it looks like me. Meters away from it I realize is just a mirror. Still undecided I reach out and grabbed his hand and everything goes blank.    Waking up in my bed sweating from the nightmare. Wondering if what I just went through was a real or not, I see the black box sitting on my nightstand. My own fears or just a bad dream not knowing I get up and follow my normal routine.

20090226121250AAeL2V9	Education & Reference;Other - Education	How did you get into college, and what did you go for?	During the past couple years of my life, I've been trying to figure out who I am as a person. While struggling with depression, I fortunately got over my addictions and old habits. As a kid, I did many things to fit in, none of which suited me personally. Now though I feel like myself, healthy and independent. Except for the fact that I am living under my father's roof still.      Over the past year, I have been studying more and more of nature, I have grown a passion for it. I began using it like medicine. I even hitchhiked across the country to go see a national park, but I stopped before I got there, I did not want to spoil the occasion by myself, I needed a companion, so I went back home.      Now I am back home, I yearn to be free and living amongst nature. I know that I should go to school though, to get a college education. Though during my high school years, I seriously messed up. I had a horrible GPA, but I completed most classes with a "C" or above, especially the ones that colleges look at. I graduated with a 2.5 GPA, though my life was in serious turmoil at that point. During this time I took the ACT's and got a 18 on them. I was very dumb at this point of my life, I went to this test half drunk, and with no sleep. So next April, after my birthday, I will strive to the best I can on that test.      I need to be independent, on my own, and of course healthy. I feel I am past a point in my life. Like I need to get out and do what I am capable of, although I don't know what I want to study, I would probably love to study anything, just to be on my own.      So if I can I hope to get into a university in my state, or even out of state. I will probably apply for liberal arts, and science. Just to get on my own two feet, and learn more about myself.      I have no scholarships, nor financial aid. I will work to get into the best college I can. I will work and work to pay for as well to get any discount I can. I don't really know what schools offer, to get into them for cheaper.      All in all though I just needed to get that out,  thank you for reading, and feel free to state something of your own.

I told her that is illegal to do so.  She responded that she does not know that but that she encourages her teachers to openly discuss this kind of issue whenever they can because they are a public school and there is not a lot of privacy anyway.  Do you know what laws protects the students right to keep their grades and information private?  Are teachers allowed to disclose grades in front of other students or persons?      Thank you

20090226125843AA4vwc2	Education & Reference;Homework Help	World War Two Answers?	If a train were to take a couple hundred troops (like picking them up to be trained and all) where would they take them? I know there's more than a few places, but a city or area where planes and soldiers (running, on foot, with a gun sort of soldier) were both trained?      Once the train arrived at this area, how many soldiers would each Lieutenant take and train at a time? Would the group of soldiers be divided?      How long would troops be away for at a time? (Concerning that it was far from holiday season.)      If a soldier were to be shot in the shoulder, would he be sent home? If so, for how long? How long would he stay in the hospital for?      Thanks, I need it for a history project. ;)
