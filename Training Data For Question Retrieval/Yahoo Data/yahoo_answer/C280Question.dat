20090203105228AAXydK2	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Who agrees with me that the film Saynora starring actor Marlon Brando was ground breaking for its time?	I know these days integration has made racial and ethnic acceptance somewhat of a moot issue as far as businesses and education are concerned yet you will still find places where hostility and fear still exists in people's hearts and comes out in their speech and actions. I saw both films Sayonara (which was released in 1957) and Mississppi Masala (released in 1991) and Pocahantas (released in 1995) and Captive Hearts (released in 1987) all dealing with interethnic romantic relationships during times of turmoil. Very emotional indeed and all were very cool because of the superb acting and effective plots. Still Sayonara came out during a time of war with Korea and following World War II and Japanese internment plus segregation was still around and widely accepted so that is why the plot of the American soldier and the Japanese lady falling in love and opting to marry despite reservations about social acceptance was very intriguing to me (moreso because of when the film was released than due to the plot which is universal and applies to ALL humanity): conquering fear with compassion! It was also refreshing to see a film made that early which focused on interracial relationships beyond black and white (although I gotta say the emotional connection between Sean Thomas and Julia Stiles in Save the Last Dance was real deep and powerful due to the superb acting as the friendship aspect was NOT completely overshadowed by the romantic touch) which I think has been so frequently projected by the media to the point that they try to give you the impression that African-Americans and Caucasians are the ONLY people that exist in the United States right now which is NOT the case: rich wealthy whites and poor delinquent blacks which to be brutally honest is a portrayal I am very tired and sick of in the media so I'm glad some directors have the courage to think outside-the-box as it were on this concepts of human relationships on screen.

20090203123157AAttlyf	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	If you change the words of a song by clipping them out ...?	Can you get round copyrighted music rules on YouTube  by changing (deleting) a few  words of a copyrighted  song by clipping the words out using an audio editing program like Cool Edit and then upload the song to YouTube? Of course you have to edit the words out so that the song is not ruined.   Usually, TV  and radio shows can avoid paying royalties by changing just one word in a song. I've heard songs on the X Factor that have a word changed so that royalties do not have to be paid on the grounds that the singer wasn't singing the copyrighted original song because of the word change.

He never allowed her to go to any of his award shows together aas a couple or be seen together at his functions because he said he wanted the focus to be all on him and his musical talents  rather than on the fact that there a couple.  Whats your thought about that? Is he a creep?  I think so for that  but they are really cute together and I'm glad she can show him off in front of brad and ugly angelina.  ha ha.

20090222195744AA4kwPq	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	Question for the faithful 24 fans?	What was the ultimate best moment in 24 history?   I know that's a tough question, but think about it.      What was that moment that you watch over & over again?   What was that phrase or expression that makes you wanna   cheer, or laugh or cry every time you see it, & never gets old?   What was that moment that makes you think,    "Gosh, I love 24!"?      Well, 24 is so awesome that maybe it would be unfair to only   ask for one moment, so you may list as many as you want.      But if you're a true 24 fan, there has to be at least one moment   that the list above describes. So what is it?   I'm very curious about your answers. Have fun.

That could have absolutely nothing to do with the numbers though.  Anybody care to explain?

See, I'm a virgin (22 years old), and I'm not used to having these feelings. So I guess what I'm asking is, is this normal. Also whenever I think about him, I also get wet.

I dont have alot of info & the info I got was 2nd hand so I apologize in advance.       A song by Peter,Paul & Mary or someone from that generation that is slow w/ a basic tune. It says something about being good friends.  I think they said it was another version of Puff the Magic Dragon.  Its not at all even similar to the song that starts " Puff the Magic Dragon lived by the sea & frollicked...".  Doesnt sound even close to it.      OK, I know this might seem odd but now I think they might have said the song is about something magical or about a horse.  I know its crazy but I know someone knows what Im talking about. Any suggestions, ideas about a song it might be, or words I could use to look it up would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you

20090222214251AAHOomP	Entertainment & Music;Movies	When was the Last Time a Movie Had a Star Studded Cast?	Like, that of The Departed. I mean I have not witnessed a cast like that, since The Godfather. Was that the last time a movie had a star studded cast, like that and how come movie producers do not look for casting, like this is it because of the financial burden.      Director: Martin Scorsese = Legend      Leonardo DiCaprio - Starred in one of the highest grossing movies of all-time in the Titanic and has been in many other renowned great movies and is praised for his acting. What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Catch Me If You Can, Gangs of New York, The Aviator, Blood Diamond, and Revolutionary Road.      Jack Nicholson - Is an American icon and one of the most versatile and talented actors that has been nominated for 12 Academy Awards, winning 3 of them, and a slew of other awards      Mark Wahlberg - Is not as well known as his star studded cast. But, is making a nice name for himself w/ and transitioned himself into a promising actor w/ movies, such as Basketball Diaries.      Martin Sheen - Has had a great career in movies and TV.   Alec Baldwin - A great actor      *Would have included iconic actor and one of the greatest actors of all-time in Robert De Niro. If it were not for prior commitments in filming Good Shepard.
20090222204528AA6yDsa	Entertainment & Music;Movies	River Phoenix or Heath Ledger?	I know Heath Ledger made himself to be a very good actor after playing lesser known small movie roles, like that of 10 Things I Hate About You. He has really turned it around and had very good performances in Knight's Tale, Brokeback Mountain, and the Dark Knight.      But, do you think he is overrated as an actor. On account of the unfortunate death. I mean I think he was great in the Dark Knight. But, he only got that role on a technicality. For, Jack Nicholson is the best Joker IMO and because he is older now would not be given the role. Nicholson is iconic and he would have portrayed the eccentric and dark Joker of Dark Knight beautifully and unprecedented by others because Nicholson himself is eccentric, outrageous, etc.         Also, like I said before it was Ledger's untimely end that triggered all this appreciation for his work. I mean he was in some unheard of and bad movies. River Phoenix on the other hand was a spectacular young versatile actor and also died in the prime of his career. But, because it happened a long time ago. People have seemed to forget all about him and take in Ledger, which is unfortunate, no?

20090222211056AAAbG2t	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	How do you ever truly know yourself?	I've come to the conclusion that the reason I don't have many close friends nor ever been in a relationship at 21, is because of my inability to love myself. Part of the reason I can't love myself is because I haven't figured out who I am yet. For instance, I'm studying economics and business in college, but I know deep down, that these aren't my true passions. Basically I haven't found what I want out of life. I then tell myself that life has no meaning anyway, so nothing really matters.   Anyway, I realize that I do have some good traits...like I can be extremely funny at times and I'm easy to talk to. I then start thinking that maybe I am a decent person, just trying to find my way in life like everyone else and that I shouldn't be so hard on myself. But when it comes down to it, I don't know who I am or what I would like to be...so how can I truly love myself? Maybe I should just love that I'm trying to find myself..?

We have been dating for more than 2 years and in the last 6 months, it seems like everything I do, the same way I have always have, doesn't please her. Gifts, the shirt I put on to go to work, etc. If I let her pick the restaurant, when we get there, she acts like I picked it and we need to leave. I don't understand the new attitude. The other day she came up to me complaining about something or other and she "I think..." I cut her off and said "I think you need to stop bitching about nothing and shut your damn mouth for once!" She stormed off and I haven't seen or talked to her in a week. I know she has been staying at a friend but re won't return my calls. Was I out of like?

20090222213824AAkuvc5	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	How do you feel about Mickey Rourke?	Most kids have only heard of his most recent movie, but how do you feel about him and why?      I really like him as an actor. I watched a lot of his films as a kid and always was blown away. I got into boxing at a young age because of him. I've made some of the same mistakes he has in life. He's always been an idol to me. People think he's so weird, but I just don't see it. He should have won best actor at the Oscars. Penn only did because he played a gay character. I have noticed that they always win awards every year for playing gays.      So how do you feel about Rourke?

I just bough the Street Fighter II:Victory Collection which has all four disks (episodes 1-29) and I also bought Street Fighter II: The animated movie.

I know that the movie came out first, then they did the TV series, but like, in the movie, I believe they have their powers already, and in the series, it starts at the beginning, so should I watch the movie, then see how it all began, or see how it all began then watch the movie. I'm thinking about watching the series first, then the movie, so i can see the beginning of everything first, but I don't know, I guess they defeat Bison in both the series and the movie (DON'T SPOIL ANYTHING) so I don't know. Does anyone have any ideas??

I looked for it earlier, the day after the episode aired, and I found the correct version. Now the wrong version is on the internet and on nbc.com whenever I search for it.

20090222213719AAazl4q	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Anyone notice how much damage is done to the WTC in the film Armageddon?	I was just watching Armageddon (1998) with Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck and noticed how much damage is shown to the WTC in the meteor shower in the beginning of the movie. The first image of the damage to the tower is a meteor striking approximately 1/2 way from the base into the building and causing very similar explosion effects that the airplane on 9/11 did. That was the damage to the south tower, the north tower has the upper 10-15 floors missing with the building still standing, this is scene at the end of the meteor shower with a panoramic view of NYC. Now the damage in the film and that on 9/11 are similar but not nearly exact. My thought was, this movie came out in 1998, imagine it gave inspiration to the plotter(s) for 9/11. There is no image of their (the WTC towers) collapse, however the Empire State Building was completely destroyed. I remember when I saw this movie back in 98 and how entertained I felt, and now 11 years later, the feeling is definitely different. I recommend watching this movie whenever you have the chance just to see for yourself the difference.

La profesora interviene en una discusión entre dos alumnos: Pepito, ?cuál es el problema? Es que soy demasiado inteligente para estar en el primer grado. Mi hermana está en tercero y yo soy mas inteligente que ella. ?Yo quiero ir a tercero también! La profesora ve que no puede resolver el problema y lo manda para la dirección. Mientras Pepito esperaba en la antesala, la profesora le explica la situación al director. Este promete hacerle un test al muchacho, seguro de que no conseguirá responder a todas las preguntas, y así accederá a continuar en primero. Ya de acuerdo ambos, hacen pasar al alumno y le hacen la propuesta del test, que él acepta. Inicia entonces las preguntas el Director: - A ver Pepito, ?Cuanto es 3 por 3? - "9" - ?Y cuanto es 6 veces 6? - "36" El director continua casi una hora, con la batería de preguntas que solo un excelente alumno de tercero debe conocer, y Pepito no comete ningún error. Ante la evidente inteligencia del menor, el Director dice a la profesora: - Creo que tendremos que pasarlo a tercero. La profesora no muy segura, pregunta: - ?Puedo hacerle yo unas preguntas también? El director y Pepito asienten. Comienza entonces la profesora: - ?Qué tiene la vaca 4 y yo solo dos? - Las piernas, responde Pepito sin dudar... - ?Qué tienes en tus pantalones, que no hay en los míos? El director se ajusta los lentes, y se prepara para interrumpir... - Los bolsillos, responde el ni?o. ?Que entra al centro de las mujeres y solo detrás del hombre? Estupefacto, el director contiene la respiración... - La letra "E", responde el alumno. - ?Y dónde las mujeres tienen el pelo mas encaracolado? El director hace una mueca de asombro. - En áfrica, responde Pepito sin dudar. - ?Qué es blando, y en las manos de una mujer se torna duro? Al director se le cruzan los ojos. - El esmalte de u?as, contesta Pepito. - ?Qué tienen las mujeres en medio de las piernas? El Director no lo puede creer... - Las rodillas, responde Pepito al instante. - ?Y qué tiene una mujer casada más ancha que una soltera? - La cama. - ?Qué palabra comienza con la letra C, termina con la letra O, es arrugado y todos lo tenemos atrás? El director empieza a sudar frío... - El codo, profesora. - ?Y qué empieza con C tiene un hueco y yo se lo di a varias personas para que lo disfrutaran? El director se tapa la cara... - Un CD. El director, ya mareado de la presión les interrumpe y le dice a la profesora... - Mire, póngame al ...........este en sexto... Y yo me voy a primero, que acabo de fallar todas las respuestas

Recién acabo de ver en "Intrusos" un adelanto del "Voice Graph", traido desde Australia. Acabo de ver el adelanto (obvio que en la gala van a haber muchas preguntas más), y estas son las conclusiones (entre otras, si me olvido de alguna, sorry):      Marianela: concursa para ser famosa   Jonathan: juega por el dinero   Juan: le cuesta mucho nominar y no es estrategia   Gabriel: le gusta alguien de la casa (no especificó, ejem...)      Estas son las preguntas del adelanto. Queridos foristas:   ???Qué preguntas más habrá hecho Gran Hermano???   ???El voice graph es un sistema confiable???   ???Habrá alguna forma de eludir este sistema tan avanzado???   ???Qué confesión o verdad quieren escuchar???   ???Serían capaces de someterse al Voice Graph???      Y la pregunta más importante.........   ???Les interesa escuchar esto???      Espero que me respondan, desde ya muchas gracias.   Saludos y suerte!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I believe that The Simpsons had lost it's edge a long time ago. So my question is- Should KOTH or The Simpsons be taken off of the air? Family Guy has more viewers than both shows so that option is out of the question.      Also Mike Judge is making a new show, The Goode Family, which I believe is going to be on ABC. I know that there is speculation of ABC adopting KOTH as well but I don't know what the update on that situation is/

And when Brad did do an Interview a while back on Oprah he refused to answer a fans question about the meaning behind a tattoo he got with angelina. I think I know why he didn't want to answer it though. Because he feels stupid that he is a Billy Bob Thorton re-run and Angelina did the same thing with Billy. So...lets see...she did a movie with billy (billy was married) took him from his wife! Then she did a movie with Brad(who was married) and took him from his wife....Home Wreck much there angelina? I just think morally they suck and personality wise they suck! And the Oscars just proved it.

20080930164940AAnBgLM	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What is the name of this movie?	I think it's from the 80s or even 90s. it's the story of a teen girl who remains alone with her stepfather. (i think the mother died). she flirts with him and end up having a sexual relationship with him. to prevent rumors they leave their town and on the way they keep having this relations, she ends up controlling him saying that she would tell if he doesn't do what she says. she kind of looks like Kirsten Dunst but younger and she wears braces in the movie. Any ideas?

UNA MUJER VALE MáS QUE UN HOMBRE       Por medio de la presente hacemos constar que, hoy en día, la mujer ocupa un lugar privilegiado en nuestra sociedad, ya que es capaz de producir mucho más que los hombres.       Por tal motivo, el Gobierno ha depositado toda su confianza en las mujeres, ya que también proporcionan al país una vida nueva y mejor. Según las estadísticas realizadas podemos demostrar que la mujer produce mucho más que el hombre por lo siguiente:       SITUACIóN ECONOMICA DE LA MUJER:       - Tiene 2 tetas que producen 2 litros de leche ($2.00 c/u) $4,00       - 2 jamones de piernas ($10.00 c/u) $ 20,00       - 1 bollo bien grande ($ 25,00) $ 25.00 TOTAL $ 49,00       SITUACIóN ECONóMICA DEL HOMBRE       - 1 Plátano ($0.35 c/u) $0,35       - 2 Huevos ($0,15 c/u) $0,30       - 2 Tetillas que no producen un co?o; $00,00 TOTAL $ 0,70       - Además tiene dos bolas que no ruedan, un pájaro que no canta y un chiquito que no llora...       Qué problema con los hombres de hoy en día!       EL ESPEJO       Un hombre se mira en el espejo y dice:      "Si tuviera tres centímetros más sería el rey del mundo!"

20090203124501AAPdK0v	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	If the mother of octuplets get's a TV show, will you watch?	I just read an article that suggests this woman, who already had 6 children, and just gave birth to 8, not only wants her own TV show, but may have planned it all along with having so many children.       I know people are fascinated with the Gossling's (John and Kate Plus 8) and the Duggars, but these are respectable people who had jobs before having a family, and who can take care of their families needs. They are enjoyable to watch because they have their children's best interest at heart.       So if a network gave this mom her own show, would you watch?      *I personally wouldn't because I find her selfish and not putting the interest of her children first. And I don't want her (or anyone else) thinking that just because you can have a ton of kids, we'll give you a TV show no matter what. That's just disgusting! JMO.

You can pretend to be anything you want, so ask your loved one who they want to be today!"

A weekend away at a swanky hotel could be just what you need."  Could I get laid this weekend?

20090203125923AA2lSO9	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What film am i thinking off?	I have been thinking of a film for ages but have forgotten the title !       Its relatively old like from the 1990's. There are a group of boys around 4 and they end up following a train track. They find a dead body down in a ditch place somewhere and then they threatened the people who killed them. I think one of the people who killed the boy in the ditch was one of the lads brothers or brothers friend.    They sing a song on their journey where they pop their mouths whilst singing it!   I hope i am right in saying that the main actor in the film has died !    Im really sorry if my clues are weak but i only remember really random stuff. Please help !

20090203130210AAAqmkt	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	I SHALL BE DAMNED To HELL!?	I used to be a representative of the Bebo Juice Co-operation. It is always a proud day to be at work. Until the day came where the Bebo Co-operation down folded and now has left me stranded. I am dedicating my life into finding the Bebo Co-operation and starting again with my life as a packager/checker. I have been seeing the Bebo Juice representatives all over the television channels. But every time they are seeming to disown me and not come into contact. I have no one except my Bebo Family.      Since I asked my last question, I'm sure you have been looking all around for more information and I was wondering if anyone found anything. I have also been getting some thoughts about 'Bibo Juices'      That has NOTHING to do with Bebo Juice Cooperation Please do not try to say that it is. It is horrible that Bebo Cooperation'sis even mixed up with Bibo.      My question is, have any of you found any information on it yet? I have been searching the state cconstantly and have found nothing quite yet.

20090203130349AAjedJ1	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	I don't understand the disgust in butt cracks?	*About the category I put this in, don't yell at me, I really didn't have the slightest clue where something like this went. I guess, if you really wanted to, you could consider this a riddle...*      Now, I'm a girl, so don't go thinking I love butt cracks, because I do NOT. But I just don't understand this, especially with the guys at my high school.      So, they'd be strutting around looking at the popular girl's butts and going, "MAAAN LOOK AT THAT ***!" Or they'll even go as far to please their raging hormones and have sex with these girls, then brag about how wonderfully scuplted the girl's butt was.   But then a girl, and this could be ANY girl (average or not), has pants that just can't seem to fit, and they slide down, obviously revealing their butt cracks.   Why does everyone think it's so disgusting, when really, it's just the person's butt? Don't the guys LIKE that?    That just completely confuses me.      Another I just thought of....   Hair.    People would think someone's hair is SO beautiful, even running their hands through OTHER people's hair, touching it...but they see a single strand of hair, usually from a friend or themselves, and immediately go, "EW, IT'S HAIR!" As if it's a worm or something.   Why is a full head of hair considered hot but a single strand is 'ew'?

20090203130702AAPnTzY	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	What are your top two reasons for liking the Jonas Brothers?	I know many questions have been asked like this, but I'm tired of the responses that I'm seeing. No one is really thinking through their answers, no one is looking beyond what the Jonas Brothers' appearance is, they're not going deeper. I want to know two really good reasons and I don't want these little short one word answers. I want paragraphs people. Two decent paragraphs, one reason in each and a very good argument behind it. Step up to the plate. Even if you hate them, give me two really good reasons and defend them, but do not be disrespectful. You can dislike them, but you MUST communicate it appropriately.       Further more, it doesn't even have to be the Jonas Brothers you like. It can be anyone, any band in the world. Jonas Brothers seem to grab headlines, so I thought I'd put them in the question. This question is open to any band and two really good reasons. And I want you guys to stop and think about why you like the bands you do. Good looks don't last forever, girls, you have to go off something more. I want to know what it is and at the end of this, I'll tell you my two reasons.      The challenge is set...   Your move...

How does hip-hop/rap effect black america?   Women how do you feel about how you are portrayed in hip-hop?   Men do you act or have the same state of mind as these rappers? (do you dress like them? Do you think of women as sex symbols? Do you look up to them?)   Do you see a difference in the way we are portrayed in hip-hop today then the way we were in old school hip-hop?   Even if you think hip-hop is degrading do you still listen to it?      Please take the time to answer all of the questions thoughtfully. The best answer will have their 10 points by tomorrow. THANKS~
