It used to be really long, but even so, in the past 3 years I've neglected to cut it all off due to not knowing what hair style I'd go with. Here's my only recent pic...       http://photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-s...       I just wanna wake up in the morning and apply a little gel at most and be on my way. Right now it's a bit of a chore because my hair is so messy that I have to dry it a certain way to look decent.      But I have no idea how to word a style to a hair dresser and I don't have a printer to print one off.      Feel free to link me some low maintenance short hair styles I could go with, cause I don't really know that much.

I've had a look on the internet but can't find anything.      I have asked this question previously but people have got confused with the question and offered me websites to do with American sports.

Who defines what being beautiful is?  The makeup industry? The people who make millions of dollars convincing you that you're ugly without their products?  Or is it something programed in our brains?  That if someone doesn't alter their appearance they don't look good.  I don't know what to think.  I just want opinions. Do you have any to offer?
20090129095144AAFDOJz	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Need help with necktie and knot (ties from the '90s.)?	I recently went through all of my 100+ ties and threw out some really hideous 1980s and '90s fugly patterns, etc.  I'm trying to get out of just wearing the same five or so ties all the time. But here's the problem:      All my really new ties are extra long, so I can do the full Windsor. However, most of my older ties (the ones that I didn't chuck) are short enough and tapered at a rate so that either A.) the knot is fine but the tie doesn't get anywhere near my belt buckle and looks ridiculous, or B.) the knot is about the size of a quarter and the tie is the right length.   Does anyone know of any tips/tricks to make the knot look a little fuller while maintaining the length of the tie?  Or do I just need to throw out hundreds of dollars worth of ties?   Thanks!

She needs some really cute hairstyle ideas because she's going to a ball. I don't know what kind of dress she's wearing.

For example, I will exfoliate and about the 5th day I can take a black shirt for example and wipe my face with it somewhat hard and it will leave quite a bit of white flakes and such, which I am assuming are dead skin cells.  Should I exfoliate twice a week then?  I usually exfoliate with a face steamer and baking soda or just sugar lightly, not harshly but enough.  Any tips or ideas on this?

20090129105413AAsupyQ	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	I pierced my own third ear holes today.?	I am 16 years old. My mom would not let me get my third holes done because my ears are shaped a little funny and the piercing would be placed in the dip of my ear and she and the piercer thought you wouldn't be able to see it from the front. Well, today I wanted to do it myself. I sterilized the needle with a lighter, and peroxide. I did use a sewing needle which I know isn't the smartest thing in the world, but anyway I placed the needle in the desired position and slowly started pushing it. In about 4 minutes it was through, and did not hurt th slightest. I put a peroxide soaked earring through with little difficulty. Also, my hands were washed for your information. I proceeded with the next ear carefully lining the 2 sides up and marking it. Well they look beautiful, and perfect. I know I am supposed to turn them daily and peroxide them. They are a bit achy and sore, and quite red and hot, but it's only been a little less than an hour, so that is to be expected. I know full well the dangers of self piercing, and the infections that I could get, but I did it properly. I'm not entirely sure what fueled this, but I must say I'm proud of it. Anyway, what other precautions should I take. Any other care tips, and things to look out for? Thanks. Next, I have to tell/ show my mother. Good fun Any tips for that too? Thank you.

I put on an act. There, I said it. I, Bradley Louise Turner put on an act. Everyone thinks I’m so wild and crazy but really I’m just the opposite. It’s not like I’m fake or anything. I do say the truth and nothing but. It’s just…sometimes I wish I was different. The reason I act the way I do is because I want to be liked and I guess my act worked. I am liked but this isn’t the “real” me. The real me doesn’t like love-stories or staying out until three in the morning partying. The real me would rather stay inside and watch a horror movie with a close group of friends and then play truth or dare and go to bed. The real me doesn’t like wearing designer jeans every day and having to go to the bathroom three times a day in school just to make sure my makeup looks flawless. The real me doesn’t mind wearing sweatpants and baggy t-shirts. Of course I would never tell them. Who’s them? Oh, just the Aphrodite girls. Yep, the Aphrodite girls. That’s what their group is called and I am part of them. Now even I am not even quite sure how I became apart of them. When I first arrived at Baycrest high I was a loner. I arrived just the way I really am. Baggy sweat pants, oversized t-shirts and all. My long chestnut brown hair was tied in a loose bun and I wore no makeup whatsoever. The first day of school was hell.

So my question:  do most girls like change into sweatpants or something more comfortable when they get home?  Is it a relief to get those tight jeans off? Or do they just continue through the day wearing the jeans?

20090128120839AAGRsXT	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	What should I do about this piercing/tattoo situation?	I am 20 year old female and I live with my parents. I have a small heart tattoo on my hand, my tragus pierced, 2 helix piercings, a nose piercing and my ears stretched. I have approached my mother about the fact that I am into the subculture of tattoo's and piercings and she is well aware of this. Out of respect, I told my mother that I am getting a shoulder chest piece when I have a proper influx of money and she said she doesn't approve but didn't over react. I told her that I wanted to get my tongue pierced and she want absolutely crazy saying she thinks that it is disgusting and she would not let me live in the house if I got that done. I keep asking her why she is so against it but she just sticks with that fact that she thinks people who have their tongues pierced are disgusting. Okay, flash to a couple of weeks later. I have let go of the tongue piercing for a while and actually went to an amazing piercer (brian decker of pure body arts check him out his is a body mod rock-star) and got my nipples pierced last saturday. Absolutely no pain and healing going so well it's almost disappointing. To make a long story as short as possible, my mom figured out that I got my nips pierced and she is acting as though I did this specifically to hurt her. I need to know how to make my parents understand that this is a lifestyle choice that I want to live and that even though they are saying I can not get anything done, I am going to do it. Not out of disrespect to them, just because it is something that I perceive to be beautiful, meaningful, and in a lot of ways (the act of being pierced, the healing period and the knowing that it is there) spiritual?    I also have a birthday coming up and a boyfriend who is willing to dish out a good amount of cash to aid in getting a tattoo/scarification piece/or another piercing. So I will not be paying money for my next body mod. But they do not like him so I can not tell them that he is paying for it. I just need some way to assure that they know I am not paying for anything any time soon.     I need to know how to have a conversation with my close minded parents to convince them that im not trying to hurt them and that im only expressing myself in a way that suits me.     Thank you in advance.

I find it really annoying when there are like short people, and they make fun of tall people just to make themselves feel better, it actually shows that they probably wish they were taller and they are having a hard time about their height. oh and the other way around too, like tall people that make fun of short. like its so immature and low.      I am 6 feet tall female, and i think you can be beautiful no matter what is your height. I just find it really low when people diss what they wish they were.        opinions?

I'm not rushing into this, I just need some ideas from other people, so that I can get a clear idea before I design my tattoo. that I will end up getting in December/January next year when me and my cousins go for a holiday. We all decided to get tats at that time, one each and then something that the four of us can get.Its a long way away.. I'm doing a lot of thinking before I get it, which is why I'm trying to decide now, and wont end up regretting it.       I just need some ideas to get this going in my mind..       I'm female. 19 at the moment (age doesn't matter when getting a tattoo, because its forever). I don't like flowers so that's out of the question, probably.      Should I get something thats got to do with my background? My mother is from the Philippines, and my dad is Australian.. Which makes me mixed, obviously. I dont want flags though..       Other than that.. Throw some ideas at me..       And yeah, wheres a good place to put a tattoo.. Somewhere to hide it, because my parents would kill me. I was thinking a rib tattoo, but apparently its painful

I hate how I look, and I dread going to school in the morning. All I'm looking for in makeup is a little confidence. That would be great. The only problem is, I have no idea what to buy and how to wear it. Here's what I own, but don't know how to wear: smart shade foundation and concealer, some eyeliner in black (pencil), soft eyeshadow (one in pink and one in a caramelish gold color) and black mascara. My acne situation is not good, but it has been getting better. When I put this little bit of makeup on, I hate how it looks. I feel like it looks fake. Maybe I'm putting it on wrong. I can't talk to my mom about this, and its a little akward to talk to it with my friends. When they wear their makeup, they look so pretty and natural, which is how I want to look. WHAT do I buy, and HOW do i put it on??? I've looked on youtube, and that really hasn't helped me. I especially have trouble with eyeliner, it looks SOOO fake. PLEASE HELP ME!!!!

They're the kind that fit really tight to the legs, but they're comfy, for the most part. Call it weird, but when I got home, I stood in front of the mirror and I noticed that my panties could be seen through the white. I was so embarrassed cause I knew that everyone could see the panties. And it wasn't like you could see only a litte bit, you could see where the panties, like, wrapped around my legs and bit in the front. They were these bright blue bikini briefs, and I will NEVER wear them again lol. But, anyway, my question:      How can I keep the panties from showing through? Can I wear, like, sheer pantyhose or something?       Please don't say "wear a thong", boyshorts, or white panties. I don't know, I just find thongs really uncomfortable and same with boyshorts.   White panties WILL show through and so will skin tone ones.

20090128125252AATOrVS	Beauty & Style;Hair	Can you sue Hair Salon in California for work performed by stylist who is an independent contractor ?	A salon in California charged me over $1,000 to attach a front lace unit.  My head was shaved bald and the unit was attached, however, the unit that was attached was not 100% Human Hair which is what my receipt states I paid for.  I immediately began having problems with the unit and within 3-weeks had to expend more money to have the unit replaced.  The stylist is refusing to refund me my money and the Salon is alleging no liability because it said their stylists are independent contractors.  Both the salon and the stylist have "canceled" license with the State Board.
