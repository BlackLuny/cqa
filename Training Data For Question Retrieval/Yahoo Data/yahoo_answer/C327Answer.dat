D3xGtrwwaa	I am an Aries and my boyfriend is a Virgo. We get along great but it takes A LOT of work... The two signs are opposite in so many ways...<br>  <br>  When I researched this myself, this is what I found:<br>  <br>  For Aries: Your impulsiveness is just too much for the Virgoan. Virgo's practical, critical nature will drive you away rapidly. This is a relationship better left alone.<br>  <br>  For Virgo: The volatile Aries will upset your nervous nature, the conclusion being ill-fated and certainly not lasting. The Ram just won't put up with your put-downs.<br>  <br>  Totally different ideas. Aries likes to try new things and be the boss. Virgo is critical and fussy and likes things to be done the way Virgo wants. Virgo doesn’t like Aries spending habits and Aries things Virgo is cold and carping. Won’t last too long. Aries is bold and Virgo is shy which could be a problem in the bedroom if Aries is not understanding. Virgo likes to talk and Aries likes take action. Aries like the social life and Virgo likes quiet nights with friends. Aries only encourages Virgo's nit picky ways. Won’t last long without a lot of work.<br>  <br>  Aries Woman & Virgo Man<br>  Aries and Virgo together don’t have much hope for lasting love. You can get things started no problem, since the physical chemistry between you is fairly strong. You will end up fighting though, when the initial passion wears off and you start to really get to know each other. You are totally different from each other in almost every way. He wants everything to be neat and perfect and organized. You say who cares, we’ll worry about it later, let’s go out and have fun! He wants to plan everything down to the last detail. You want adventure and excitement, not boring plans. He is also very picky- and you’ll get sick of his opinions pretty fast. Not a good bet for true romance. ( Source: Jellybean's Astro-Soulmate Guide ) <br>  <br>  The two of you are as different as night and day, which makes for plenty of challenge and excitement.  Mr. Virgo will always respect and encourage your goals, and that includes turning in the school paper that you've procrastinated on for months. In turn, when the hard work is done, your glitter and spark is the stuff that dreams are made off, and Mr. Virgo will worship and adore you for it. ( Source: FUNgirl - Astrology )<br>  <br>  <br>  ...I will say that if you can make it work it is DEFINATELY worth the work :)|`|GZUZqazcaa	OMG,Yea!Virgos and Tarus' make great friends.I read it somewhere,and also all of my friends are born in May and are all Tarus' and we get along so great!Also,all my virgo friends,somehow we love the same things,think the same ways and even feel the same ways.. lol<br>  <br>  <br>  this is a great website(this is where i saw the thing about Taurus' and Virgos being great friends)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novareinna.com/constellation/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.novareinna.com/constellation/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Aries n Virgo Compatibility <br>  <a href="http://www.astrology-online.com/arsunvi.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.astrology-online.com/arsunvi....</a><br>  <br>  The Virgo native is a thinking individual who lives more cerebrally than physically. The Aries native is an action packed go-getter who dislikes spending too much time standing in the same place...after all, there are worlds to be conquered. If this pair can develop mutual hobbies and habits, then there will be common ground on which to base a relationship but lacking this type of sharing would eventually make life unbearable for both partners. Indeed, this relationship could deteriorate to the point where, instead of listening to each other, both would be trapped in an endless round of putting down the other's suggestions and ideas for improving the situation. If this tendency is not recognized and checked early, there will be little chance of surviving the personality clashes and before long, there will be a parting of the ways with each partner branching off in a different direction. Virgo individuals are caring souls, willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of others and Aries should not grow impatient with this trait since there is no other Sign of the Zodiac better equipped to take care of those in ill health as is the Virgo subject. In the romantic arena, Virgo will probably be too ready to please the Aries partner, going along with all of his or her suggestions. However, Aries may feel that Virgo should on occasion display his or her own incentive. If this does not happen, then the Aries partner is bound to become restless. The bossy Aries native is not likely to take Virgo's criticisms kindly, even if they are well intended. Indeed, any form of criticism is prone to undermine the Aries sense of discovery and throw him or her into depression. This match could succeed, but only if much effort is employed by both individuals.<br>  <br>  Initially, these two may think they have nothing to learn from each other and development of the relationship will take time. In many ways, these individuals are total opposites. Aries is brash, dominant and aggressive, constantly jumping into new experiences and almost always impatient. Virgo is extremely detail-oriented, quiet and even shy, working patiently toward long-term goals. The energy associated with Aries is fiery and impetuous, while the energy associated with Virgo is far slower and more grounded. Still, it is these differences that can teach Aries and Virgo so much...if each will only look beneath the other's surface. Early in the relationship, these two may be able to see nothing but each other's faults. The Virgo partner will probably consider Aries too much of a daredevil be far too brash and the Aries partner will regard Virgo as way too fussy. However, if each focuses on the strengths of the other, the will discover a great deal. Aries can teach Virgo about fun and excitement...Virgo can teach Aries how to be patient and attend to details, coupled with the knowledge that little things...and moments...are also important. In addition, Aries can show Virgo how to take things less seriously and Virgo can instruct Aries on politeness and the value of hard work.<br>  <br>  Virgo is ruled by the planet Mercury and Aries is ruled by the planet Mars. The Aries native wants to rush out and fight without wasting any time on preparation or strategy. Conversely, the Virgo native wants to analyze everything ahead of time and work out all the details before taking action. Such opposite approaches can result in strife and this pair must make a conscious effort to learn the other's methods rather than allowing the other's natural rhythm to create discord and distraction. Virgo is governed by the element of Earth while Aries is governed by the element of Fire. Thus, where the Aries native will be driven by fiery impetuosity, the Virgo native will be grounded and practical. By nature, Virgo weighs all the options prior to devoting any serious effort, while Aries simply sees what he or she wants and immediately dives in the deep end. This is true in both career and personal relationships, which can prove to be something of a stumbling block. If the Aries native has decided that he or she wants a relationship with Virgo, frustration could reign for quite some time while the Virgo native makes up his or her mind regarding whether this will be a good idea. Virgo is mutable in quality while Aries is Cardinal. Thus, the Virgo partner will harbor no desire to be leader or boss...he or she will be perfectly content to follow all of the suggestions made by Aries. On the other hand, the Aries partner will definitely want to make those suggestions...every time and all the time. This can be a beneficial dynamic if the pair are working as a team toward a common goal. In short, these two are very effective in a team situation, be it business or personal. The inherent characteristics of both, opposite in so many ways, can make for a highly complementary relationship.<br>  <br>  In essence, this combination may prove to be a little difficult. Generally, Virgo is too fault-finding and precise for the Aries personality. Where the Virgo partner will be logical and analytical, the Aries partner will be impatient. This is a match that can succeed...and could well be dynamic...provided the two are prepared to work together, but it will be a constant challenge. Longevitiy can only be attained if Aries allows his or her Virgo partner to have sufficient space.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novareinna.com/constellation/virgolovecomp.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.novareinna.com/constellation/...</a>|`|9WzOlFMeaa	I was in a relationship with a virgo ~didn't workout~ im an aries he is a virgo...

uel6NBOVaa	It basically shows the people we attract, and how we handle our relationships. It's the qualities in a person that we admire and cling to. For example, if your rising is in Libra, then chances are you will thrive with Aries types who are more assertive, confident, and confrontational, qualities that Libra wants to gain, but doesn't have naturally. However, it will also cause the native to be very competitive and uncompromising in their relationships.|`|ATSLuU12aa	I think that means that your ascendant is leo:)<br>  But i believe that hows we think..the mars.|`|xsajYfFEaa	no it dosnt mean your detached and cold.  your desndent is one of the factors of what kind of mate your atracted to.  if your a man the other factors are in your moon and venus.  if your a woman their in your sun and mars

I think their new sh*t s*cks a**|`|pNUtnoC8aa	I was only unsatisfied with 1 album and it was St. Anger I blame part of that on the producer playing Bass. No band from Metallicas day is as good as Death Magnetic new G&R is dreadfull.<br>  To answer your question directley there is no denying the first 5 albums are superior kick in your nuts Metal but the New stuff could be a lot worse.<br>  I wish Jason had never left I really liked him.|`|kP0JGI1waa	I much prefer the old Metallica over all else.  I am not going to act like "dude I was into Metallica until the Black Album, then I hated them" partially because I didnt even know about Metallica until a friend showed me Enter Sandman, which blew my mind.  Their first four albums are incredible and I just dont think they were able to maintain that level again.  I dont fault them, they tried to experiment and create new types of songs, plus DM is pretty sick, but those first four are just too good.|`|vxEDtriRaa	Pre-rehab Metallica. I don't like their new stuff.|`|233a69b57842f8251f38e8b34bee6955aa	I like Metallica all together, old & new. But I think the old songs are classic so... idk they're sorta hard to beat :D|`|sORJIVlXaa	Pre Load which is a very underrated album might I add.<br>  I did like Death Magnetic.<br>  <br>  I like the way Metallica has put a balance to their music unlike other bands AC/DC in particular who repeat the same sound. It's something musicians do sometimes and it gives a little bit for everyone. In the Justice album james introduced a voice never heard before on the track One and it carried over on to the Black Album, Load, Reload, St. Anger, and Death Magnetic. I don't really think it is selling out it is just a breath of fresh air for the band. Overall there are only 2 Metallica albums I will not buy Re Load and St. Anger.|`|bBFiiSG2aa	I like the old Metallica better but their new stuff gets alot of hate that it doesn't deserve. The only album I didn't really like was St. Anger and it has a few songs that are good. Load and Reload are very underrated albums and I really enjoy Death Magnetic.|`|ZDYgzYzxaa	metallica is metallica and always has and will be. they might of evolved musically and lyrically but they are still themselves. They will forever be the best!|`|4EfNaDH5aa	I LOVE Metallica in general but I can't deny that there old stuff is better :)|`|KzRH5LjZaa	i like metallica in general st anger will stand the test of time|`|uadhNhr6aa	DEF OLD METALLICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  I <3 OLDSKOOL!!!!!!|`|ddS7unC2aa	I don't really like the new stuff but I love the old.|`|7gCdJaavaa	It's all good.|`|NohwjIgoaa	no contest pre loaded metallica mostly b4 the black album like kill em all the black album tho was probably the best because of songs like enter the sandman for one which i dont think they would be as famous with out because tht song really sent them into being famous and songs like wherever i may roam and the god that failed and songs like they the new stuff like death magnetic and even st anger are really a dissapointment

Females my age felt the same way about the New Kids On The Block when we were 13, and females my cousin's age felt the same way about Backstreet Boys and N'Sync when they were 13. <br>  <br>  With that in mind, I'd have to say KISS.

7Rhmqdv1aa	The CW has confirmed Cynthia Watros (Lost) and Andrew McCarthy (Lipstick Jungle) to star in the Gossip Girl spinoff tentatively titled Lily. Cynthia and Andrew would play CeCe and Rick Rhodes, Lily's parents and Serena's grandparents. (Caroline Lagerfelt plays CeCe on the current series.) Brittany Snow (American Dreams, Nip/Tuck) will be young Lily Rhodes. Shiloh Fernandez is set to play Owen, a possible love interest for Lily. Krysten Ritter (Veronica Mars, Breaking Bad) will be Lily's wild-child older sister Carol. Appearing in the "backdoor pilot" episode airing May 11 is No Doubt, playing themselves in the 1980s before Gwen Stefani went solo, back when they were just kids.<br>  <br>   I would have rather seen the It girl books be maded into a spinoff, when Jenny goes to boarding school.

5c32c20454730c4d102bcfbf98334674aa	Here is why I hate Jason:<br>  <br>  Like Melissa said in the limo- she can't be mad at Jason for not being in love with her, BUT he could have talked to her privately BEFORE the show aired, rather than dumping her right there...and she had NO idea he felt that way!!<br>  <br>  He totally contradicts himself. On the second half of the "After the Rose" special, he said that Molly has become his best friend, and that's what he was looking for. BUT when the jerk dumped Jillian, his excuse was that he was looking for more than a best friend!! What a liar!<br>  <br>  He comes across as a great father. It is so phony, just like his tears!! (Who cries that much!?) Just when Ty was getting settled in with Melissa, he dumps her and then shacks up with someone else. That is not a father who has his sons best intentions!!<br>  <br>  I am actually glad Melissa did not end up with him. I can't wait to see her on Dancing with the Stars!!|`|AA11517073	I feel that Jason was just going along with what the producers told him to do.  That makes him a Big Fat Jerk.  He is a grown man and should know not to mess around with people's feelings. He wasn't enough of a man to stand up to the producers.  Since everyone figured out what  ABC did to Melissa, they decided to let her be on Dancing with the Stars. Good luck to Melissa!|`|qXJnNelsaa	Rock on!  what a f'in loser!  How dare he do that to that beautiful, considerate, caring cool *** girl!  She deserves way better than a tool like him anyway. Not to mention, what freakin nerd!  And he has the WORST hook nose I've ever seen.  Also, can we make fun of him crying?  What a ******!  What self respecting man would do that on tv?  I think Molly is dumb for taking him back, doesn't she realize she was second choice?|`|F0na6atkaa	i really dont care, i dont watch the show =]|`|7yHo3Rmfaa	if I was sitting in the AUDIENCE I would of yelled out what a stupid jerk. Or they would have to pry me off the stage cause i would be strangling him !!!!!  He lied through his teeth that he wasn't sorry that he told the one that things couldn't be worked out and wanted to go back to the other girl .  I think they should put more rules to the men|`|NtwlsAhUaa	JASON=loser big fat jerk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  :] hehe u rock|`|JGjpc7Itaa	Well, since we weren't there and don't know what the producers suggest that he do we have no way of knowing the truth.  BUT, from the looks of it, yeah, he is a big fat jerk and I hope Molly dumps him.|`|TfijWwsYaa	yeah, he is a big headed jerk...and too much attention got to his going bald head.  Melissa will be on Dancing with the Stars and I will watch it for the first time ever tonight just because she is on it.  I think Jason wanted fame and attention....but looks like Melissa will get it instead...I bet Jason and Molly are floored by this.

3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	I haven't heard anything yet one way or the other.  There's no information either way at Fox's website or at the show's entry on the Terminator Wiki (link below).<br>  <br>  My wild guess is that there will probably be a 3rd season, but it will depend a little on how Terminator: Salvation does at the box office this summer.<br>  <br>  The Terminator Wiki gets updated pretty regularly, so I'd check back at that link regularly for new info.|`|AA10954273	Probably not.  The ratings have been low, and are even worse since moving to Fridays.  It's also an expensive show to produce.  Odds of it being canceled are very high.  The only hope, and it's a slim one, is that the new movie does really well in the box office.  If it does, they might renew TSCC for a half season to see if they can capitalize on the popularity of the movie.  It's a long shot, though.|`|kELOzS8Faa	Fox has not decided yet whether it will be renewed, but it doesn't look good. The ratings keep going down on a weekly basis.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Crazy in Alabama (1999)<br>  IMDb review:<br>  It's the 1960s in Alabama, and Lucille (Melanie Griffith) murders and decapitates her abusive husband, Chester, and heads to Hollywood with his head. Meanwhile back home, segregation is being fought in her small town. Our narrator is Lucille's nephew (Lucas Black of "American Gothic" TV series and "Sling Blade"), who is living with his uncle (David Morse), witnessing the evil of the town sheriff (Meat Loaf Aday~rock star/actor) and trying to make sense of the Civil Rights movement. ... Lucille dazzles everyone who meets her, and everything goes her way, despite the fact that Chester's head continues to speak to her. Griffith is compelling; her husband, Antonio Banderas, directs her as he sees her; the camera keeps finding the perfect woman: thrilling, sensual and sweet.<br>  Also in the cast are Cathy Moriarty, Rod Steiger, Robert Wagner, Paul Ben-Victor, Fannie Flagg, Elizabeth Perkins and Paul Mazursky.<br>  Here's the movie trailer:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foxLhAKZRxg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foxLhAKZR...</a><br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...<br>  Darn!

Gjc3Wa9Jaa	Oooh, I know what you mean. But when the next special comes out, it means it's one less episode of DT as the Doctor. How sad. <br>  <br>  Anyway, I found some stuff on "Planet of the Dead" which is coming out in the UK in spring (so autumn if you're in Australia like me).<br>  <br>  "Bionic Woman and Merlin star Michelle Ryan plays the mysterious Lady Christina de Souza who joins the Doctor on a bus-trip which takes a very unexpected detour into danger. British comedy star Lee Evans also joins the cast playing a character called Malcolm whose life becomes connected to the Doctor's under extraordinary circumstances and Noma Dumezweni returns as Captain Erisa Magambo - last seen helping Rose and Donna save the world in Turn Left. Planet of the Dead is the first of four Doctor Who Specials which will air in 2009. Written by Russell T Davies and Gareth Roberts, the episode is will be screened on BBC One in Spring 2009."<br>  <br>  Aaaand until then, I'm gonna watch the reruns.   :)|`|048nOVTQaa	probably at the end of the next series and since the new series of doctor who hasn't even started yet you have a lot of waiting to do|`|dNPYSWRWaa	I think some time over Easter. Lil-M mentions Lee Evans being it - that should be good - he has always acted really well in anything I have seen him in.
T6V9zXymaa	I don't have a solid answer for you, but I'd suspect it might be for the same reason a number of actors are afraid of being associated with just one role: typecasting.<br>  <br>  Rowan Atkinson has an amazing comedic range, but people will always think of him as Mr. Bean, even though he had an excellent run in a number of shows (including my personal favorite series' "Black Adder") and movies.|`|CViUokMqaa	He didnt want to...duh!|`|gnQXkjnMaa	That's a really good question, because the few shows he has are awesome.

aYNoQvfMaa	The bass is the foundation of the band. I actually think you have it reversed I don't think any pure guitar player can take up bass and be successful, but I think any bassist can take up a guitar and become as good as most in a very short time. (As evidenced by Rob Crow, and Kenseth Thibideau)<br>  <br>  The bass is extremely difficult to play because it's an instrument of restraint, and knowledge. It's subtle. A great bassist should not be the focus of the band, but if you take the bass out of any great song the song is hurt by it. The bassist has to provide a rhythmic foundation, but also has to fit with the melodic leanings of the guitar. Nobody in the band has to know as much about both chord structure, and rhythm as the bassist. There are great bands who could, and have do/done without guitar and not be hurt (Morphine, Lightning Bolt, Touchdown, Ruins, Rothko), but only very rarely is a band that is just guitar and drums hampered by the addition of bass.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	Guitar but I still love the bass. Nothing kicks more a** than a sweet guitar solo|`|DnWsMhwLaa	kazoo<br>  *rolls eyes*|`|LcS0034naa	Guitar definitly! its the main part plus u cntplay a song wif only bass but u can wif just a guitar. its the heart of the music, the key, the most important element lol|`|4EfNaDH5aa	Guitar (:|`|ZQS2Q6cXaa	guitar.
u9RwzLPnaa	Just know that it's all part of Light's plan to kill L. Saying more will give it away and ruin it for you.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Just in case you missed it, giving up ownership of the death note causes the original owner not just user to lose all his memories relating to the death note. Which means victims apparently.<br>  <br>  The death note he buried was Misa's death note that she had forfeited ownership of and that meant she lost her memory and now Light's plan is .... opps almost gave it away but part of it was to lose his memories so he can seem genuine around L.

I mean, those are fun even when you're alone. We're talkin' the hula hoop of the nineties. <br>  Lancaster Bowl Manager: Look, I've told you. We don't need nuthin'. We don't even have a novelty machine in the men's room anymore. <br>  Roy: And you call yourselves a bowling alley? <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Roy: Some of the dresses ya' got, ya' need two hairdos to wear. <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Neighbor: Hey Roy, can you get sick from drinking piss? <br>  Roy: I think you can. <br>  Neighbor: Even if its your own? <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  ESPN Announcer: So Roy, where have you been for the last fifteen years? <br>  Roy: Well, I uh, well, ya see, I uh... Drinking. Lot a drinking. <br>  ESPN Announcer: I see. Well, are you still drinking? <br>  Roy: No. I uh... I put... uh... Why, you buying? <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Ishmael: You been drinking, Mr. Munson? <br>  Roy: I don't puke when I drink. I puke when I don't. <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Mr. Boorg: How many children do you have? <br>  Roy: None that I know of. I mean, I'm unable to have children. Nasty cheese grating accident as a boy. <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Roy: Hey, I hope you don't mind, I got up a little early, so I took the liberty of milking your cow for you. Yeah, it took a little while to get her warmed up, she sure is a stubborn one, whew. <br>  [Takes a drink from the bucket] <br>  Mr. Boorg: We don't have a cow. We have a bull. <br>  Roy: I'm gonna brush my teeth. <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Roy: Just because you're familiar with the missionary position doesn't make you a missionary. <br>  Claudia: Look, Mr. Munster, you're not exactly the smartest guy I ever ran across. <br>  Roy: Oh yeah? And who are you, Alfred Einstein? <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Landlady: What is it about good sex that makes me have to crap? You really jarred something loose tiger. <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  [On smoking] <br>  Ishmael: You should try to quit. They say its bad for your heart, your lungs. It quickens the aging process. <br>  Roy: Who's done more research than the good people at the American Tobacco Industry? They say its harmless. Why would they lie? If you're dead, you can't smoke. <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Ishmael: Whatcha doin', Mr. Munson? <br>  Roy: Flossin'. <br>  Ishmael: Flossin? Where the hell did I get "Munson"? <br>  Roy: The name's Munson, what I'm doin' is flossin'. <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Roy: I know what you're thinking, but let me explain... <br>  [Claudia kicks Roy in the crotch] <br>  Roy: [very softly] Mommy. You must have a really wide foot because you got both of them <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  [refering to Roy's hook for a hand] <br>  Claudia: It must be hard to spank your monkey. <br>  Ishmael: You have a monkey? <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Roy: Take that, you freaky piece of ****. You don't mow another guy's lawn. <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Roy: Thomas can raise a barn, but can he pick up a 7-10 split? <br>  Ishmael: God blessed my brother to be a good carpenter. It's okay. <br>  Roy: Yeah, well he blessed you, too, and I'll give you a hint what it is. It's round, has three holes, and you put your fingers into it. <br>  Ishmael: You leave Rebecca out of this. <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Ernie McCracken: You're on a gravy train with biscuit wheels. <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  [Roy Munson is getting ready for his turn to bowl] <br>  Ernie McCracken: It all comes down to this roll. Roy Munson, a man-child, with a dream to topple bowling giant Ernie McCracken. If he strikes, he's the 1979 Odor-Eaters Champion. He's got one foot in the frying pan and one in the pressure cooker. Believe me, as a bowler, I know that right about now, your bladder feels like an overstuffed vacuum cleaner bag and your butt is kinda like an about-to-explode bratwurst. <br>  Roy: Hey. Do you mind? I wasn't talking when you were bowling. <br>  Ernie McCracken: Was I talking out loud? Was I? Sorry. Good luck. <br>  <br>  ----------------------------|`|aCcRsh7uaa	ABSOLUTE best line - "We don't have a cow... we have a bull."  Genius!

jOSKNZgEaa	check out the movie's site<br>  <br>  www.twilightthemovie.com<br>  <br>  the homepage is running a contest<br>  if you win, you get to go to the set of the new movie<br>  plus, you get a chance to be IN the movie!<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure (if you win) that you'd probably get a small part <br>  like a citizen in Volterra or someone who is in the movie theater or something. They'd probably want to keep major roles (Bella, Edward, Laurent, etc.) open, so you'd only get a minor part...<br>  <br>  But, a part is a part! Plus, it gives you bragging rights ("Hi, I'm *your name*. I was in the New Moon movie."). Not to mention the fact that millions of crazed fan girls (not me, I'd rather keep my excitement to myself) who would KILL to get even the slightest chance to be near Edward (well...the actor, actually, not the real vampire), and they watch in a huge theater jealous of you (even if you're just a Volterra citizen).<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Gz2WCF2Naa	YUPPP!

vo8rllmHaa	You say that acting is a big thing for you, so that is probably where you should start. And then later (or even during) you can get a singing coach and practice that as well. Many actors are also singer/songwriters.<br>  It's really up to you to decide because you know yourself better than we do. In the end its really all about what you want to do anyway.<br>  <br>  But whatever you do, don't go to disney. Please don't.<br>  They'll make you famous and when things are going well, they will eat your brain and use your talent and fame to brainwash even more young children.|`|TdLuyP7Zaa	I DO NOT think that you should do Disney Channel. They're evil! You'll turn out like Lindsay Lohan, Hillary Duff, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera, all of whom got their start at Disney.

RoXHFR3zaa	I know exactly what you are talking about.  Well, if you have some time try this start singing with the music at a normal sound then each time put the volume down a bit. Do this until there is no sound. I wouldn't suggest only singing it with the music though, that could through you off in the audition. Another thing that helps me is to hum the song a couple of times, or when you think you are off hum it and try to match it. Other than that just practice! practice! practice! But remember not to practice too hard I did that once the night before an audition and I nearly lost my voice.<br>  Break a Leg ^w^<br>  ps. message me if you need help with an audition related things I am sure I could be of help ^w^|`|g12oBzpUaa	call me.

EOwxpAD6aa	*Hiss* Dakota could never play Jane! I've known Jane for many years, and I think Dakota is the last person on earth who reflects her. Poor Jane, she must be quiet disappointed in the casting result.<br>  <br>  Renata|`|pLD3pYsuaa	I found out on j14.com that she was playing Jane in New Moon, I am pretty ok with her playing Jane in New Moon, she fits all the feautures that are described in the book, most of the time she has play good in her movies, i've never seen her play a bad role before in a movie, but I hope for the sakes of this movie of how this movie is going to come out that she does good, i do think that she is a great actress and i really hope she does good in this role.|`|822da6b7b24693d516953606bfb56517aa	i think she would be perfect for jane|`|WJ5lGNxxaa	Yes, sadly it's true... but look on the bright side, at least she's not THE WORST actress available to play Jane. She actually did a really good job in "Push."<br>  <br>  I totally get what you're saying about the whole 'Dakota Fanning doesn't look like Jane' because I always pictured Jane as an older person, like in her thirties.|`|iMLrUrdbaa	I tihnk she will<br>  Cos she looks older now<br>  <br>  && she looks older nowadays <br>  <br>  <a href="http://evilbeetgossip.film.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/dakota_la.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://evilbeetgossip.film.com/wp-conten...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mannythemovieguy.com/images/dakota_fanning_jane_volturi_new_moon.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mannythemovieguy.com/images/d...</a>|`|ifYOXajoaa	Dear Rob Pattinson is a hottie,<br>  <br>  So far from what i have heard, it is true! I don't feel like it would be a mistake for having her play in the "New Moon" movie at all. I just don't think she could apply being Jane! I mean could she handle being a mean and rude person? Does she have the meanness inside her? I can't really tell. I think she is a great actor. And probably deserves a better part. Am i right? <br>  <br>  Neither have I, Ever pictured her as Jane. And i think nobody should judge her till the movie is actually made!!?? LoL* I can't exacrly say she wont be a good role for Jane, Just an Ok role probably. But we will have to keep our patience till the New Moon movie is out! and i can't wait! LoL*|`|fDEDg0ZOaa	it's true i heard from the same websites as you. i love her but unless she does a great or good job in playing jane no i don't think she is prefect for this role. she is a little too young. she is my age|`|Q7Ed9UHIaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsO1Lkso4FNYmX.HLh9LrmTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309160024AAEL6XD">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|5MHtDIXlaa	She's the perfect actress for the part|`|kqqXIEJtaa	?

She's a pretty good actor.|`|WFcpHxBoaa	I'm 80% sure that she will play as Jane...and I think is a really good actress for her age..no matter what role she plays.|`|XpfXBbzpaa	i dont mind it <br>  i think shes pretty good for her age|`|cKuHXJQyaa	it is true. since summit confirmed it, dakota will play jane in new moon.<br>  <br>  this movie was mostly made up of unknown actors. they were in some movies, but not very well known ones, so that's one of the reasons twilight was a big success.<br>  dakota is a mainstream actress, but not so popular that she will ruin the movie. she has played some really intense roles throughout her career, and this one will just be added to her list.<br>  <br>  everyone had a different picture of how jane would be portrayed, and to tell you the truth, she was just how i pictured her.<br>  dakota is tiny, as is jane.<br>  so in that aspect, she fits the role.<br>  i'm excited to see her in new moon and how her character works out.<br>  she'll be a good fit to the cast.

My boss looked at me with disgust and reminded me I would have been in an hour early if that were the case. She probably would not have been so hard on me but a week earlier I was scolded for not wearing my uniform jacket. A day later I remembered to bring it with me but my car died on the way in....so I dumped a little to much gas in the carb to get it started and it caught on fire. I put it out with my uniform jacket and actually made it to work. In fear of getting written up again, I wore the jacket.

8Ba2YwO7aa	Yes i was really disappointed about the ending too, IT SUCKED...I was really expecting more but who knows maybe there will be a movie, in that case then its ok.<br>  <br>  In the end i think they were just trying to give us a last glimpse of them, which was a bad way of doing it because they were going into a police station.<br>  <br>  I had a feeling that it was Jenny that took the negatives to the movie...lol common we are talking about Jenny. I had it between 2 people that killed Jenny, Bette or Nikki, but i think it was Bette, she was looking really shaky in the interrogation, and if i remembered correctly she was the last one to talk to Jenny...But if it was her i dont blame her...lol...She was a pain to everyone.<br>  <br>  But Alice kinda give out some information in the interrogation because she said something like "i thought we were here to talk about who killed Jenny" and then the detective went "so you think someone killed Jenny." So we'll just have to wait and see what comes out of all this.<br>  <br>  The only part of the show i enjoyed was the moment Bette and Tina shared together, it brought tears to my eyes because i couldn't believe this was the last time they were going be together.|`|q1D83tSnaa	I think if "The Farm" is picked up, the killer should be revealed.<br>  The episode was destined to be a let-down, simply because there can be no good ending, if they ended it by giving us all closure and a "happily ever after" ending, it would have been to cheesy. And maybe the cliffhanger is made to lead up to something.<br>  And it was strange to see all the women smiling. <br>  And then here comes Jenny, smiling too.<br>  idk, very strange.<br>  Dana should have been brought in some form and I hoped that Shane would either apologize to Carmen or go to Molly.  <br>  I guess in my heart, i refuse to believe this is the end of such an amazing show, that truly touched my life. <br>  Lets see what "The Farm" has in store for us.|`|11b09bb2ce3a335fe5c99c70ade79ccdaa	Please use the 'enter' key more.

6tL9B6goaa	I'm not sure if I can explain it correctly but here goes:<br>  <br>  In the notebook trade with Ryuk and Rem, Light forfeited his ownership of the note that was Misa's, right? He returned it to Rem, who was the Shinigami owner. <br>  <br>  Then, Light made Rem give it to Ryuk so that Ryuk would become the owner of that note, since only Shinigami can exchange ownerships of notes. Even if Light gave it to Ryuk after forfeiting it, it still belongs to Rem so Rem must be the one to give it to Ryuk.<br>  <br>  Light then made Ryuk drop that Death Note so that he could pick it up again for his plan (which I hope I'd explain well).<br>  <br>  Then, Light's Death Note, originally Ryuk's, he did the same thing as well - he gave it back to Ryuk, who gave it to Rem. Rem's supposed to give it to someone else, someone with power, so it ended up with the guy from Yotsuba.<br>  <br>  Now then, the Note Light has was buried in the ground somewhere, to be dug up by Misa when she regains her memories. Her Shinigami then would be Ryuk.<br>  <br>  The Death Note of the Yotsuba guy was retrieved after the whole capture operation and the Shinigami is Rem. This is so that the Shinigami that L and the others would encounter would be her, to be able to fool them. Rem's got a better common sense than Ryuk as well. All else follows, like when Rem killed Watari and L to save Misa.<br>  <br>  If I'm not helpful at all, please read manga chapter 54 - <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Death_Note/54/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Death_Note/54/</a> and I think you'd understand it better than me rambling on and on about thoughts I cannot completely explain.|`|PtS12WZVaa	What things to the notebook? <br>  <br>  The fake rules? Because he was put into isolation and if L got that book the rules say "you must kill within 13 days" or something like that and he was there for around a month, as well as Misa.<br>  <br>  Rem and Ryuk? Again, what things?<br>  <br>  The relinquishing of the notebook when Misa was caught or giving the notebook to someone new? When Misa was caught (my opinion) Ratio (Light) wanted L to notice a sudden change that he could not explain and maybe put him down the wrong path and would HAVE to let Misa go. They gave the notebook to another person so the killings would start again.<br>  <br>  Sorry, hope that helps.|`|PnhAho6xaa	He traded the notebooksso that he doesn't get caught with it and that his memories are temporarily erased making him innocent and sending the cops in another direction. Then later he git back his memories of being Kira ended up planning both Rem, Watari, and L's demise by putting Misa in peril ( which he all thought out beforehand, so he's not only a bastard but a smart one)<br>  <br>  He then changed a few things in the books to keep his new found innocence within teh case at hand. Rem did all that to protect Misa since he promised Gelus that he would adn he kinda fell for her too which i why he died after killing L adn Watari. Ryuk was just there to be entertained by a few moments, just to kill some time.<br>  <br>  Hope this clears it up a litlle.|`|BOOIXJeQaa	I'm just as confused as you are, I watched some of the series and gave up, I also watched the film part on the tv until 1am (it finished at 2am) but I got tired of trying to understand it too. I've also tried reading some of the manga, maybe one day I'll be patient and get it!<br>  <br>  Hopefully some of this will explain it?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note</a>|`|V0M33p5vaa	Its not too confusing if you carry on reading or watching- I wouldnt give up yet because its very good until a certain point.<br>  <br>  I cant really remember what happens, but I think everything he does is to try and make L think he is not responsible for everything that has happened- all the deaths. <br>  <br>  If you keep reading or watching everything should get explained.|`|VSsCZ2N6aa	WELL YOU CONFUSE ME! its not that confusing..|`|3337cc33a3e69c4d2e55dd53705aa778aa	All that is part of Light's plan he'll explain it in later episodes, but im not sure if i will be ruining it for u so just keep watching and everything should fall  into place, well it did for me<br>  <br>  NVM im guessing u really want to know so here's my answer:<br>  Light knew that if he continued with his current memory, he would be found out. So he decides on having someone else take the blame. If he knows nothing of the notebook and of being Kira then he can act with real expressions, fooling those around him. Rem was following Light's orders u might say because that would be a step closer to Risa gaining her happiness with Light.

IPtGMtT9aa	Stephanie heads into Philip’s office and asks if something’s wrong. “Not anymore,” he says and kisses her.

She quickly retreats and bumps into Brady, who asks what’s wrong. He realizes by the way she’s looking at Daniel, that she’s the woman in Daniel’s life.

He asks her to lunch, but she’s meeting Chloe. They sit together and spy on Nicole talking with Sami. They wonder what the two are discussing and joke about bugging the baby carriage. Stefano notices Kate’s not in a great mood and Kate says she’s meeting Chloe, the bug that needs to be squashed. Stefano finds this interesting how things have changed. Kate says God had Chloe spare her life, so she could spare her son’s. Kate refuses to say what Chloe did, but knows Chloe will regret it until the rest of her life. Stefano is amused and leaves.<br>  At another table, Sami says they’ve all got to respect each other’s privacy and says that EJ was budding into her life this morning at Salem PD. Sami doesn’t want him in her life anymore than Nicole does. Nearby, Nicole tries to wrap her head around the fact that EJ was protecting Sami from her ex-bodyguard. Nicole assumes EJ has good reason, but Sami reminds her that she has no right to say who EJ shacks up with. Nicole gets up to leave but Sami quickly apologizes. Old habits die hard. Nicole wants to know what Sami wants from her. EJ is a DiMera and Sami thinks EJ feels he owns her somehow. Nicole knows Sami’s scared and tells her so, but Sami denies it.

Daniel and Chloe look uncomfortable and Daniel mumbles that it’s fine.<br>  Back at Titan, Stephanie tells Philip, sure, he’s handsome and a great kisser, but she’d be stupid to trust him again. Philip wants to change but Stephanie doesn’t like being manipulated with sex. Philip asks her to help steer him in the right direction and they lean in to kiss. Melanie barges into the room, ranting about what EJ did. Philip says that’s what she gets for corporate espionage. He can now forge ahead, without her! He threatens to sue and kicks her out. Melanie finally takes the hint and tells Stephanie she has herself a real Prince Charming. She leaves. Stephanie doesn’t like that Philip’s kicking Melanie when she’s down and she comments he’s like Victor. Philip wants to get back to work and asks if they can continue this over dinner. He gives her research to do and she goes on his computer and tells him something’s not right with the system.<br>  At the manse, EJ finishes a business transaction; he tells Stefano that he’s selling shares in the Trillium Company for 18% less than what Stefano had originally wanted to sell at. EJ wonders if they should have waited. Stefano wants to dish about seeing Nicole and Sami together but EJ doesn’t care. He hopes they’re working toward a resolution for the sake of the kids. Stefano laughs at that, but EJ says he isn’t sure he has a choise but to trust them. Stefano flashes back to his goon telling him that Nicole was seen entering a convent. Later, Stefano wonders if Titan knows they’re about to be blown out of the water.<br>  At the pub, Nicole wants to be left alone, so Sami thinks her plan will benefit them both. Sami shares that EJ saw her and Rafe kiss and went ballistic. She says what she and EJ had is still there. On Nicole’s way out, she sees Chloe, Kate and Daniel’s exchange. "I thought I had a bad day." She leaves and Kate says Daniel knows how to hide his feelings. Kate asks, "Do you really think I don’t know what’s going on?" Chloe stammers, as Kate plays with her and Kate says Daniel obviously didn’t like the dress. Chloe relaxes, but Kate comments on honesty being the best policy and how she must have gone through hell before she broke up with Lucas. Kate discusses how soft-spoken Daniel is, a wild man in the bedroom. Chloe chokes on her tea.<br>  Melanie goes to Max at the Cheatin’ Heart, upset that nobody likes her. She explains what happened today and Max is certain Philip’s just talking. Melanie has no money. Philip won’t sue! Melanie needs support. Max thinks her problems are self-inflicted and if she wants power and wealth, it’ll take time to get there. What they have isn’t as good as it seems! Melanie notes that Max thinks things through, while she doesn’t, and she goes off to think. Max apologizes. She bumps into Brady on the way out, and he runs after her, when she says Philip upset her.<br>  Nicole arrives home and accuses EJ of running Sami’s life. She asks why it matters to him who Sami kisses. Stefano overhears the exchange and calls his thug, asking him to find out why Nicole was at the convent.<br>  Meanwhile, Sami calls the convent to ask after Grace, who is doing very well. Sami urges the nun to keep mum about Grace and Sister Theresa says they will. She mentions how a woman stopped by and held Grace. Sami panics.|`|qKEKLOaEaa	this is an awesome website to catch up on what is going on. They also have spoilers that are very up to date.

Remember Snow White?|`|W4k8kOfdaa	If I remember correctly, Lucy is later placed in a stone coffin or something in a mausoleum, right? So maybe the glass coffin was used specifically for the "wake" or "viewing". It would sort of be like having an open casket funeral.

qeVfPBGOaa	there is no irrefutable sp? answer. each rapper has his own pros and cons. some with more cons than others......<br>  <br>  inb4 COMMON IS SO GOOD<br>  <br>  HES HORRIBLE<br>  <br>  edit: okay so let me break it down for you since i got a top spot on the comments list<br>  <br>  to whoever said weezy, i hope you're joking. <br>  <br>  anyway. each "top" rapper has his own pros and cons, and each listener has his own preferences:<br>  <br>  what beats do they use?<br>  how is the tone in their voice?<br>  what is the song about?<br>  how deep is it?<br>  how catchy is it?<br>  <br>  its IMPOSSIBLE to narrow it down to even 5 rappers. you cannot judge how good a rapper is by how much he has accomplished either. some incredible rappers' lives got cut short ,while others kept going and going and eventually fell off.. (cough JAYZ)<br>  <br>  KRS-1 has done a lot and i think that kind of changes the way people think about his music. im not gonna deny hes not a good rapper, because he is, but his music only shadows his accomplishments.<br>  <br>  rakim,, = his lyrical ability is incredible, but then again, its all listeners preference, and i dont like his voice<br>  <br>  Eminem,, i will say he is a contender. though one could argue that to be the "GREATEST RAPPER EVER", you would have to consistently release music, which, frankly, eminem hasnt done.<br>  <br>  his earliest stuff is brilliant though. the rawness and creativeness of his songs still amaze me, yet.. to say hes the best is just narrowminded. some people dont like the violence in his music.<br>  <br>  and finally, for my pick, which is obviously refutable in an unbelievable amount of ways,<br>  <br>  BIG DADDY KANE.<br>  <br>  the way his rhymes come off are just, for lack of a better term, buttery.|`|5D4T6h7waa	Can't be only one.

Im a product of the 90's, i like the rappers who rap about the real ****.  All the talk about money hoes and nice cars gets old quick.  People forget where rap came from and why.

B43x5RF8aa	Because they are going to re-release them as Special Edition DVDs just like they did for 1-3 with a new box set probably around the time the remake comes out on DVD|`|aCcRsh7uaa	Probably to increase sales on the box set.  Either that or they are planning on re-releasing them in new packaging, but I wouldn't count on that because they weren't the biggest hits in the world to begin with.

Its central perk!|`|OLXbcFc2aa	Central Perk is a fictitious coffee shop in New York City's Greenwich Village. It was one of the focal points of the popular television sitcom Friends.[1][2] It was one of the show's main sets in which the six main characters spent much of their free time conversing. One of the main reasons for this was the fact that it was, as Joey proves in The One with George Stephanopoulos, less than 100 steps from his apartment, counting 97 steps from the apartment to the inside of the shop. It is based on Cholmondeley's, a coffee shop and lounge in Usen Castle at Brandeis University, the alma mater of the show's creators.[3] The name is a play on words of 'Central Park' (referring to the park, also in New York) and 'perk', referring either to the stimulation gained from coffee consumption or the coffee percolation process. Central Perk is mentioned in the last line of the show, when asked if anybody wanted to go get coffee, Chandler responds "Where?", the friends leave the apartment, and the show ends.|`|FLSTvkrOaa	OMG!

I dont know where else to check. It would seem like it would have to be listed in the episode's credits somewhere... but where those are... who knows.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I know this isn't an answer, but here's some links to other forums that the question has been posed under:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tv.com/csi/show/19/official-turn-turn-turn-topic----mar-5th/topic/135-1249965/msgs.html?msg_id=12822055#23" rel="nofollow">http://www.tv.com/csi/show/19/official-t...</a><br>  <a href="http://findmeatune.com/record/7561701/come%20see%20the%20rumble%20and%20feats%20they%20show.%20when%20i%20put%20this%20behind%20i%20dont%20know.%20come%20see%20the%20lovely%20machine%20break%20down.%20criss%20cross%20i%20wont%20be%20around%20when%20she%20falls%20down" rel="nofollow">http://findmeatune.com/record/7561701/co...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cbs.com/forum/posts/list/41109.page#671396" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbs.com/forum/posts/list/4110...</a><br>  <a href="http://adtunes.com/forums/showthread.php?p=780595" rel="nofollow">http://adtunes.com/forums/showthread.php...</a><br>  <br>  Hopefully the answer will turn up soon (its a sweeeet song)!|`|ec37d9031e613e025adb657384ee9486aa	This is my guess as to why CBS won't release the name of that song. The episode "Turn, Turn, Turn" was intended to sell Taylor Swifts song, but inadvertently created a bigger buzz for this song. CBS is probably red faced and tying to appease the Taylor people for making the mistake of putting a song on that overshadowed Taylor.<br>  <br>  As for lyrics here is what I have<br>  <br>  Come see the rumbling wheels...they show...when I put this behind I don't know.<br>  <br>  Come see the lovely machine....break down...criss cross (then it becomes uninteligable)|`|98OcEv83aa	I got the same response from CBS too! *shakes head in disbelief!*<br>  <br>  I've been looking for this song since the ep was broadcast - it's not The Guillemots 'Kriss Kross' because that's a kind of rock-y thing. I doubt it's Kia Shine either - I don't have 'Touch' to check it but I do have some of his other stuff and it's nothing like it...<br>  <br>  Still looking too - it's quite frustrating!|`|muaiCbHAaa	Okay, so my neighbour has an application on his iPhone that can tell you what song is playing simply by holding the phone up to the speakers where the song is coming from.

LT7IwZdhaa	Back in the day I would have said the Doobies...In 1975 I saw the Doobie Brothers and the Eagles (with Elton John on a few songs) play together at a "Day on the Green" in Oakland and at the time I thought the Eagles were a little too mellow and the Doobies really rocked...Takin' It to the Streets in 1976 with Michael McDonald saw the Doobies move first to a more bluesy jazz influenced sound and with 1979's Minute By Minute a more adult contemporary sound...the album that decides this question for me now though is the Eagles' Hotel California-an absolute masterpiece that was the quintesential 1970s California Rock Album-and it has aged well.<br>  <br>  Final Answer: The Eagles|`|H1mGTwvWaa	both very talented. but i'll have to say the eagles. what a great band and their harmony's on vocals cant be beat. each piece of that band make it a great band. not the greatest musicians separately,but wow when they are together its magic...hands down, one of the greatest bands of all time....|`|qnwe2E3caa	The Eagles...

qOKFuXfLaa	i think the better question is: Why are Zlisters still around? no one cares about them anymore and they should just vanish!<br>  <br>  BTW: who the hell are Ginger Minger, Patsy Palmer, Steve Mc Someone, Wendy Richard and Letitia Dean ?? <br>  <br>  <br>  hahaha|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Maybe because they don't want to be photographed with red eyes from crying. <br>  Who knows. :-/|`|6d10196c158f49dbb02649f8773591d0aa	Eyes are the windows to your soul so they wear them so people can't see how upset or not they are to be honest.<br>  Reason they go out of respect and to be noticed is the other answer.|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	Because they think it's 'cool' and makes them look like celebs!  It also hides their tears.|`|i2ZAVM2aaa	It gets them recognised, People will say whose that Prat with the Sunglasses|`|kYYHw7xEaa	Wendy Richards from "Are you being served"???????<br>  <br>  I had not heard. Going to google it.|`|FHYjZx1Kaa	Steve McFadden - I don't know, but the ladies will have been wearing them not to hide just tears and red eyes but the mascara running. Either that or they've sensibly decided not to wear mascara (cos it would run) and can't be seen with naked eyes.<br>  <br>  On 2nd thoughts Steve McFadden AKA tough guy Phil Mitchell prob didn't want to be spotted with tears in his eyes. Too hard!|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	I noticed that too and thought it looked ridiculous.

It's very hard to explain........|`|405b47863f96696ecc3415e084e85ab8aa	Yes, 15, i couldn't stop thinking about him; everything i did would some how realate back to him.

14K1Vt3Paa	Get rid of tarnish on silver the easy way, place a piece of aluminum foil (shiny side up) on the bottom of a glass bowl or pan. Fill the container with a solution made of 2 cups boiling water and 3 teaspoons of baking soda, and you've made an inexpensive "bath" to soak your silver in. Your silver will shine like new in no time!|`|x5dXU8vWaa	fairy liquid|`|F6YPGh9Raa	jewelry cleaner for silver, yet don't leave it in for a long time, no more than just a quick minute or two, cuz true silver is porous and it turns black quickly!?<br>  you can buy it anywhere!?|`|JSwO2hRqaa	To restore shine to a jasper gemstone, it has to be re-polished by a lapidary (gem cutter) with a machine that usually costs a few thousand dollars.|`|yiEUOwK0aa	this stuff called "silvo". i don't know where you live and whats available but just look in a hardware store or something :)
c3MFIbeUaa	I agree to the point where that love comes with an unconditional response.<br>   Such as the love of a good parent to their kids.<br>   The love of a adorning husband to his wife. <br>  The faith of a loving wife in her husband.<br>  The commitment  that the two give to each other as a token that represents the marriage. Those are the things that surprise us in this day and age of throw away relationships. Surprises that surely brings one together in Unity with GOD'S Blessings.|`|toLCaFc9aa	Totally agree :)|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	Wouldn't know.|`|Emk4xuTuaa	Yes|`|Qih2hKqkaa	No!|`|7ubZ5jRNaa	yes

dAKgZr7Xaa	Sorry, but i agree with BIGGUY, you wouldn't be alive to type that Q.<br>  80 years ago there were no such thing as "STOPLIGHTS"<br>  It was chaos, anarchy.  The infernal combustion engine ruled the roads; frightened horses which were still in use.  Pedestrians they simply ran down, ignored, i don't think people had considered options like slowing down, or swerving to avoid collision, mind you, to swerve when driving an early motor vehicle was tantamount to playing russian roulette with a revolver with one bullet in it, there was NO WAY to predict the outcome.<br>  <br>  Sway-bars did not exist.  Shock absorbers did not exist. Steering was direct, and without isolation, so you felt every bump.<br>  I think you are spoiled mate, drive your grannies cars and you would soon calm down, or die horribly, the SAD truth.<br>  I suffer road rage too, but mainly because of people who run stoplights and stop signs, give way signs. Lol, Meeting here is safe, but on the road..., we dont want to go there!!<br>  Do remember the laws are there because most humans are as dumb as cheese when it comes to real skill in a vehicle.  Not implying you, but must be pointed out.  <br>  <br>  The way the lights are PROGRAMMED is the real issue, they once programmed for FLOW, but people sped too often, so it was changed to "CHOPPING"; breaking up the flow to FORCE people to slow down.<br>  A few idiots ruined it for everyone, AS USUAL!!  Lol, humans, glad i'm from Betelgeuse!! Lol.<br>  <br>  Good example, driving my statesman one day an old lady went through a give way sign writing off both cars, she couldnt see me..., cos she was driving herself to the doctor, with eyes full of pus. But she thought ok to drive, sheite, no Einstein!!<br>  I bless her, the insurance payout was over my cars value, and i kept the wreck, oh, and nobody hurt.<br>  <br>  We SHARE the road, even high speed driving by police is dangerous, so imagine EVERYONE speeding, like in the late 70's and 80's, it'd be great, but i think people are worse drivers now, and the cars ARE far more dynamic.<br>  Take care out there!!  Enjoy!!  Reduce global footprint!!|`|7ubZ5jRNaa	If it weren't for stoplights you would probably be in the morgue by now. Show the lights your silent appreciation.

oMNHPDEvaa	It would be easier to get a debit card. You don't have to worry about anything, and it does it all on its own.|`|c87ej8qRaa	To make sure they can ship movies as quickly as possible, they only accept debit cards issued from Visa or MasterCard and all major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover). If you have a bank account, your bank should be able to issue a debit card. That is the best way to pay without using credit.
RTfPrlEhaa	It's reality tv..they want to make it great television so they ask the cast when they are going out to party or other things that would be interesting..check out the season 5 trailer: <a href="http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/344558/the-hills-season-5-trailer.jhtml#id=1605714" rel="nofollow">http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/344558/th...</a> it looks awesome!|`|V4NaOAS1aa	i live on the west coast<br>  and trust me what they go through is normal here<br>  so i dont think its scripted|`|0oHakDnKaa	I don't think that it is.

But, the producers tell the cast to do things over just so they can get it on tape if they did not in the first place.<br>  <br>  Also, Audrina was asked to be on the show and move in next to Heidi. So, all those things seem scripted. <br>  <br>  I think Laguna Beach was more real but hills has A LOT of elements that seem scripted. <br>  <br>  I think the Heidi and Spencer thing is for sure scripted. They are acting through out the show. Heidi and Spencer both look into the Camera a lot. They are acting for sure.|`|ztllWXy3aa	I think so of it is!

viUCibKIaa	Nope, my mom's a Pisces and she faaar from dumb.|`|uel6NBOVaa	No, your Sun sign does not determine your intelligence. If someone thinks a Pisces is dumb, it's probably because they can't understand their complex feelings since Pisces doesn't always express themselves in words...It really depends on the planets in the chart, though. People with different planets will perceive things in different ways.|`|OegheALwaa	im a pisces and its not that im dumb its just that i cant explain things in words i have to draw a picture or explain some type of example, like i sometimes use metaphors lol. like i was always ahead of my class in knowing about the world. like in elementary school i knew things about different cultures and places, but my dad would get mad when i would get my words jumbled up when tying to explain him things. <br>  <br>  and it kinda makes me mad when people say that pisces is this and that well most of the signs that say that are to dumb to understand the complex personality of pisces.|`|eT6SsCaraa	Well..  I'm a Pisces, but I'm going to answer anyway.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say they are any more dumb than any other sign. In fact, they are supposed to be very intelligent. However, Pisces are very gullible and naive,  as well as emotional and complex, which could come off as stupidity to some people. <br>  <br>  Being a Pisces myself, I can tell you I am not the brightest person out there. I don't have the best hearing, and I think rather slow. I also talk slow sometimes, but that's mostly because I always think before I speak.<br>  <br>  I am not very street smart either, I have to say I'm pretty innocent and ignorant of most things..  and sometimes I just feel like I lack common sense. >.< Like other Pisces, I am very naive and gullible too... But,I do try my hardest, earning some of the highest grades in school. (top 10% in class) And others have said I am a very talented artist.<br>  <br>  But being sensitive makes it so hard... If someone insults my intelligence or puts me down for how emotional I am, I just feel so terrible and stupid it makes me cry... )':|`|AA11417199	NO THEY JUST TALK SLOW AND HEAR SLOW, It's only their nature to do that. That doesn't mean they're slow. Other people see slow talking people as slow but that's not the case, Pisces are actually VERY EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENT AND CREATIVE. EVEN IF I'd JUST CURSE ONE OUT.LOL. Anyways, don't worry, Pisces are clever and know Universal truths about the world.VERY WISE PEOPLE.<br>  -sagittarius|`|t9w4zqDaaa	I'm a Pisces and graduated at the top of my class!|`|QNK2p7snaa	Pisces are extremely smart people.They are highly imaginative people with incredible creativity and originality.Jupiter ruled signs are never dumb. They are lazy but have superior intellects.<br>  Dumb ones are often Leos and Cancers.|`|qnU1HS1aaa	Lol thats a stupid question. It has nothing to do with being a Pisces. The question is dumb, therefore it makes you dumb.|`|9d3779e08741de60c8b3afd027f91e1eaa	Pisces are dreamers.  If they are dumb its only because they are in a dream and what's so bad about that?

X33TN5Cpaa	You can definately talk about modernization and how many private family owned companies could not keep up with the ever-changing times. interstates being built caused many to not travel through certain places anymore. On the otherside, new highways being built caused some small time places to explode and be put on the map. <br>  Another Historical aspect is the maternalism and how the character still lived with his mom at an older age adn that when the father died things fell apart. Because, back then, the man was the provider and children stayed home longer as well|`|zBkaqIWcaa	As the first poster mentioned the film changed varous things about the film industry.<br>  * Hitchcock's "no late admission" policy for the film causing long waiting lines.<br>  * Killing the most recognized actress in the first part of the film was also new,<br>  * Also showing a sex scene at the very first scene of the movie. <br>  ----<br>  During the film, maybe you can talk about the effect of new highway reducing traffic on the road where the Bates Hotel was with the resulting reduced business.|`|71dc8b0b34bc9146e70f8ed00ac5dfdbaa	The historical thing about Psycho is that it changed how movies were shown. Because of the surprise ending (and if you arrived late you wouldn't see Janet Legh, the star of the movie), people were not allowed into the theater after the movie started. This was unheard of. It use to be that movies were show continuously. You went to a movie at any time, saw the ending, then watched the next showing until you got to the point where you entered. Psycho changed all that. Movie starting times were now enforced and the theater was cleared after the performance. The result was that it created long lines around the block. Lines no one had seen before. Of course, this change was more about the marketing and less about the ending. The lines caused a stir, the press took up the story, and it became an overnight media sensation. Things were never the same after that. There is a short feature on the DVD about the phenomenon.<br>  <br>  Edit: I know you mean the movie. There is no historical element to Psycho. I was attempting to show you a different approach to the assignment. Think out of the box.

956d43fbc612852be9834658deb4139faa	I love House so it`s really hard to choose a favourite.  The funniest one to me was;<br>  <br>  90 (5-04)  "Birthmarks"    October 14, 2008  Metal pins in brain displaced by a magnet.<br>  House is coerced into going to his father's funeral despite his protests. The team takes the case of a young woman who collapsed while in China looking for her birth parents. House works with the team via cell phone, while Wilson drives him to the funeral. House’s phone is taken by a cop mid-diagnosis and the team must decipher House's last statement. Meanwhile, the story of how House and Wilson met for the first time is revealed. <br>  <br>  The most touching scene was in;<br>  <br>  50 (3-04)  "Lines in the Sand"    September 26, 2006  Baylisascaris<br>  <br>  As Adam and his parents are leaving, they thank House, who is sitting nearby. Adam holds eye contact with House and gives him his PSP, a most unusual gesture for a child with autism. Wilson comments: "That was a ten" in reference to a scale of how good in a moment being a doctor can be.

I didnt like Saw l yet so many ppl do and just what i have read on ur question but in general.  W/e the reason all i know is i like how in the end of all of them they tell the twist along with the Jigsaw theme and flashbacks of what went down in that movie.  I liked V aswell grrr i nvr saw that one comming.  Cant wait for the next one hopefully it comes out again around same time and they dont make us wait longer like it was rumored i beleive.<br>  <br>  Enjoy the rest of ur day:)|`|fcku4bGjaa	1st

When one of his former colleagues is murdered, the washed-up but no less determined masked vigilante Rorschach sets out to uncover a plot to kill and discredit all past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with his former crime-fighting legion - a ragtag group of retired superheroes, only one of whom has true powers - Rorschach glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences for the future. Their mission is to watch over humanity...but who is watching the watchmen?|`|eBIkTdZ6aa	it's not stupid.<br>  <br>  it puts the world into the retrospect of if superheros existed.<br>  they aren't really "super" hero's, they are masked vigilantes.<br>  dr. manhattan is the only true superhero.<br>  it also is set in the mid 80's and America is on the verge of nuclear war with the USSR. <br>  i recommend the graphic novel, it's 10 times better, but i still truely enjoyed the movie.|`|LUn2y65zaa	itz bout these heros who are unappricated and how when it comes down to people relle needing them they ask for help|`|AA11594108	About 2 and three quarters hours.|`|FWOKlNTMaa	its really stupid dont even watch it

I wanna name him...Checkers! No, Bataang. Or Biondi, or Kataang. FYI- The first two, Bataang and Biondi, are real Microsoft Word fonts. I've always wanted to name my pet after a font. The last, for all you non-Avatar fans, is the name of the relationship between Aang and Katara. I just thought it would be an awesome pet name.<br>  <br>  1. what's your birthday?<br>  -->May 25. I like it 'cause there's lots of cake, and the stores are having sales on cake because it's close to Memorial Day and they all want to sell stuff! Hooray!<br>  <br>  2. do you know your favorite anime charrie's b-day? <br>  Er, no. But there's no question a good ol' Wiki search won't solve! Let's see...<br>  <br>  Byakuya-sama's birthday is January 31.<br>  Ichigo- kun's birthday is July 15. (Ha! Go figure!)<br>  Renji's birthday is August 31.<br>  Light's birthday is *gasp* tomorrow!

Remember in Rurouni Kenshin, when Kaoru died, and they showed the blood and everything? And it turned out to be a fake. I have faith that this is going to be that same sort of thing.<br>  <br>  4. are you doin' something other than answering my pointless stuffs? As for me, i should be doing my homework...oh well!<br>  -->Eh...I'm supposed to be making vegetables for dinner or something. So I'm typing fast and hoping that my dad forgets about it for at least 10 minutes. Which he usually does. :)<br>  <br>  5. does anybody have any pocky? i really could go for some...<br>  -->Hey, so could I! Let me know when you find someone who has pocky so that we can mooch off of 'em.<br>  <br>  BONUS: have you ever pretended you had a death note just to scare off someone you didn't like?<br>  -->No, though I have often wished I owned one. And not just the kind you get off the Internet that just looks really authentic, I mean a notebook really infused with the shinigami power. It's a bit comforting I had the power to do that, and no one would catch me. I wouldn't really use it, though.

Wait until it ferments.

AA12380746	I am only rude if they deserve it... otherwise I am a peach.<br>  <br>  <br>  I was at a bar and they brought me my drink... I drink Crown and Coke... not a hard one to figure out. I took a sip it tasted wrong I asked to have it re-made,with the right liquor. and mind you I asked very very nicely...very respectfully I even said I was sorry  the waitress left for about 30 minutes... came back SLAMMED (sorry for shouting) the same (now completely watered down drink) infront of me and then said "this is not my problem it's yours, and if you want a fight go talk to the bartender" and then she huffed off.<br>  <br>  I was so angry I couldnt see straight... no one else i was with could hear what went on, and all the sudden I am going... who in the f does she think she is, I grabbed my coat told my husband we were leaving... and I think a friend of ours ended up getting all of our tabs waived that night... and we had drank a TON.<br>  <br>  in that case she desrved it.<br>  <br>  but no I would not just come in with an agenda and take it out at the first person i see sitting behind a counter... I for sure know how that feels! *be nice to your land lords! they are people too!|`|AA10716061	Nope, I'm always friendly and outgoing towards the girl at the front desk of the office :)|`|eiEdUWNbaa	People are the worst.

I am the girl at the front desk. The only thing that pisses me off is when associates are rushing me to have them sign out a badge because they forgot theirs and THEY are running late. I am like...you should of had your badge, (but not out loud). I am only doing my job. <br>  <br>  Also, I hate that when an associate is sick and they need a cough drop or advil or something they wait till they get in my space to spread their germs...ugh, please don't do that to an obsessive compulsive germaphobe!!! <br>  <br>  Other than that, I am a very nice "front desk girl".|`|yauOABy3aa	i'm never rude..........|`|NOKKtjaGaa	no, i try not to  be|`|b8e2bc9f3753405233ebcc96825942cdaa	To be ultra honest,a lot of these front of house women are chosen for their ability to be rude and arrogant and if not, then they are exceedingly good at being bitches to customers on their own.|`|lFqUMMAGaa	No way ~ I like to treat people as I would like to be treated myself ~ I don't like rudeness and feel very sorry for people having to deal with rude people in their jobs ~|`|gUdlaaGwaa	I'm never rude to anyone.

Its like, can't you think outside 'the box'??|`|Ng2xjVKLaa	No but sometimes they're rude to ME :[|`|06YOGE1eaa	I hate people like that.  My sister plsses me off.  She is such a bltch to people. She thinks everyone should worship her.  That is why we are not even close anymore.   I won't go anywhere with her due to the fact that she is a bltch.  I am always nice to people, but I used to work as a waitress at Applebee's and Texas Steakhouse and a telemarketer.  I don't know how some people puts up with it.  It sucks dealing with the public, especially the bltchy part of the public.   People will go to the front desk, because they are mad because they can't find out where they need to go or if the waitress brings out their food and it is not cooked right.  It is not like the damn waitress cooked the food.. i mean, come on people..  I am sure those hateful people would not want to be treated like ****.|`|aae4d303fe9bd3bec8a94721211dbfbcaa	well shes rude at me too.. didnt even say hi|`|gaVhPGWhaa	its not always our fault. sometimes the people in the front desks are mean to us, so we are mean back. it's called fair play. lets say a lady got charged more money, so she's mad. the lady at the front desk doesn't want to give the lady the money. obviously the lady is going to be mad and start yelling. it makes sense. it's the lady at the front desks fault for choosing to be a receptionist.|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	I'm nice to everyone. Especially waitresses and waiters considering they work their butts off for such little pay.<br>  <br>  But I think people are rude to them because their jobs are...not the best?

In the passport office, the government official sees that she is visibly puzzled filling her passport application.<br>  <br>  The passport official looks over her shoulder and sees the blonde trying to write 'twice a week' into the small space labeled 'SEX'.<br>  <br>  The official explains: <br>  <br>  "No, no, no.

WT9cjXtIaa	Grey hair runs wild in my family (on my dad's side). So for me it was probably about 18. Yeah.... you think you have it bad at 28 - I don't think so. LOL. As long as you have all your hair you're in good shape. I know it's different for women. Guys can get away with a bit of grey, but don't stress it too much. It brings on more grey hairs.  <br>  <br>  Wait till you find the first grey pube... then you can worry about being old.|`|mMmNEljxaa	I am 38 and have two they have been there for a few years my friend is same age and he is silver all over.<br>  <br>  I am not going to worry about it just try to keep in condition and look after the mind for me that matters more than some other grey matters. <br>  <br>  I have noticed people who gripe about being old look older be strong.|`|oX1YBEf9aa	Lol! It's not so bad!<br>  About 2 years ago? And it may sound crazy, but I swear it happened almost overnight, when my father had his stroke. He is seventy now and his hair is almost all black, whereas my mother is 60 and is all white. But she had a beautiful halo-like white that framed her face, when it grew in...the sides and back were still solid light brown! If mine grows in like hers, I won't even dye it, it looked so disguished and pretty on her....|`|qdPtCBJeaa	I think I found the first one the day after I found out my sons girlfreind was pregnant.

Happily it was atop my 7th husband's head and not mine so I was able to dispose of it (and him) without a second thought.<br>  As for my own bonce? Who knows what colour is sprouting there naturally these days? Damned if I do! I regularly apply a good harsh chemical dye to my elegant bouffant style - sometimes "Brasso-Baby" blonde, sometimes "Little Raver" red. It all depends on my mood. <br>  Currently I'm favouring "Bad ***** Ebony" black which seems to reflect the rather playful mind-set I am in of late.<br>  At 28 you've nothing to worry about, sweetie. But if you'd like me to colour your hair for you just pop round any time.<br>   I'll happily bend you over my basin!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Lovely Courtney - What was I thinking?<br>  Happy birthday, you adorable little thing!

I don't know if any are even grey right now.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	I found my first white hair (I had no 'grey' hair, just the red/brown I've always had) when I was 43.  I waited and found two more white hairs a day later, and called my oldest friend to 'crow' about them.  I always wanted 'prematurely grey or white hair' ... I'm now 58 and have some small white streaks, but am still that basic red/brown.  My grandmother and her sisters all 'went grey' very late in life, and I have a feeling that I'll go grey/white about the same age ... in my early 70s!|`|JGjpc7Itaa	I didn't get my first gray hair that I noticed until I was 55.

Prey upon the dying whore.<br>  <br>  get it copyrighted before someone on the internet steals it<br>  <br>  okay I think the song talks about someone that really doesnt care and who just goes out and acts like they don't give a Fu--.  they waste their money because they have it and all the credit cards to pay for everything thats wasted.  and the chorus is like telling the person to keep on doing it how they always did.  and that they just want to live and they dont care what people think about them.  also it sounds like they want to live fast and die young without a care.  also for the birds or prey ect. is like you can go after the whore but nothing fazes her even when you try hard and it sounds like you want to control her.  also how sex will hurt her?  i dont know but yeah thats my interpretation at the moment.|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	I found it funny for some reason.

ATKZ39Ceaa	437....<br>  i thought is was great. FINALLY, hinata tells naruto she loves him. YEEESSSS!!!!!!! i dont think she is dead though. i think the best part was when naruto turned 6 tails. now he is going to kick pain's behind even more. i cant wait for the next chapter, its going to be even better.<br>  =D|`|CQX3TAIoaa	SPOILERS (duh)<br>  <br>  Waa~<br>  I love Naruto so much now. Recently the chapters have been picking up and they are so interesting. Every thread that I've been on today has been about this chapter. <br>  <br>  I'm really glad that Hinata finally got a chance to confess. Her death was just...:O...I still kind of can't believe it. While I'm pretty sure that she's not dead, it was put together very well. Hinata is one of my favorite characters, so it was nice to see her. Though, I can't really say in action can I? She got hit before she could even hit him once. Still! NaruHina all the way!<br>  And then Naruto's transformation into the 6 tails?!?! I have to wonder how much of a toll it will take on his body. I mean, just look at what the 4 tails did to him! Which is good, cause I was wondering how they heck he could do any jutsu with his hands (then body) pierced like that. Nice way out of it, no need to plug up any holes. Now you just have to fix him afterwards. Uh, that didn't make much sense. Anyway!<br>  Team Gai is coming as well. I can't wait to see their faces, especially Lee and Neji, when they see Naruto as the 6 tails.<br>  Basically it's just a wonderful chapter!!! Looking forward to the next week fo sho!<br>  <br>  @~*Sweetness*~<br>  Someone else explained it to me. They said that it's the skeleton of the 9 tails coming out, getting ready for the full 9 tails. Makes sense to me. <br>  <br>  @☆Mizuiro- chan☆<br>  The most common that I've heard is NaruHina|`|N4Hktfmnaa	Remember Rurouni Kenshin?<br>  Remember when you read it, and you thought Kaoru had died, and she really didn't? It was a fake body. They showed the blood and the sword and everything, and it was fake.<br>  <br>  I really was rooting for NaruHina (Or is it HiNaru? I've really no idea) and I still believe it it! I don't think she's gone for good.|`|6PSnZDhDaa	u mean 437 right....<br>  <br>  i dont believe Hinata's dead... the maker would be too cruel to kill her off like that.... and I dont understand why Naruto's skeleton was on the outside....<br>  <br>  i cant predict anything anymore|`|3Zno7Nd4aa	its okay........<br>  i don't really like naruto so don't take my word for it|`|UepGEiR9aa	me and my little sister were just talking about this!<br>  <br>  when hinata told naruto that she loved him, me and my sis were like: TOUCHDOWN!!!!! WOOOOOOO!!!!<br>  <br>  but then we were like: "what the hell took her so damn long to say this!?!" i mean, the manga has been out since 1999, that's 10 ten years! 10 years and 437 chapters to admit that you love someone?<br>  <br>  ...well better late than never.

3WD96VDFaa	Who care what people thinks? The fact is, being with him just because you feel bad for him is actually hurting him. The longer you are with him, the more you will hurt him later on. Don't wait too long to break up with him. It'll just hurt him even more in the long run.<br>  <br>  Just let him down easily. Just tell him that you don't feel the same way as he does, tell him or ask him if you guys can still be friends.<br>  <br>  Next time, it's always okay to say no, if you don't feel the same way. It's not right to date someone just because you feel bad. Save them the trouble and hurt and just say no.|`|mMi19s7Vaa	Never Date A Guy Because You Feel Bad For Him <br>  <br>  Just Tell Him You Rather Be Friends with him And No Hard Feelings between Y'all =]<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|rMRErHifaa	its not fair to him to string him along.just tell him.|`|DT80y28Maa	well you are a b**** for getting with him in the first place.

9561bfcf1a05d328055061d4b26e8f40aa	The piercings are tiny and its not that noticable if you have big lips ( which you dont lol srry rachel )<br>  but dont do it , you will get in trouble you know how russian moms are .. until your 30 you cant do anything because they claim that your body is their property lol.<br>  <br>  if you want a piercing that you can hide get a septum piercing but they are ugly  and i would never imagine you with one . hah.|`|zc47c39daa	Its not big, but it's quite noticeable.. I have a monroe and the starter ones are pretty big.<br>  <br>  You can hide it, but you'll have to always cover your lip with your hand, wear a scarf, hoodie, get a clear one- but usually they put titanium or something around there for a starter one.. Your lip will be swollen for the first couple of days and that's noticeable too.<br>  <br>  It's hard to hide it. My mother brought me when I turned 13 and got hers done to haha. x) Not the best decision, I regret it, but I have it so there's no point on taking it out. And it doesn't look too bad either, so ah well. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck, but I doubt you can hide it for long.<br>  And you will probably regret it.|`|UHIi8AuQaa	can u take a vacation away from your mum for two weeks,as you will have to leave the piercing in for at least 2 weeks,before you take it out..............after that you'll have no problem,your mum wont notice any hole when you take it out............<br>  did you ask your mum if you can get one???<br>  u never know she might not mind|`|AA11609300	Your labret?<br>  <br>  You're probably not going to be able to hide it.

AA11518036	Sherlock Holmes.|`|R5UIMBvcaa	Dracula seems pretty popular at the moment, probably in part because the writings of Anne Rice and Stephanie Meyer have revived interest in vampires in general, but I think Sherlock Holmes remains more perennially popular.  When I first got interested in Holmes, as a teenager, I learned that he was the second most written-about character in the English language, second only to Hamlet.  (Huck Finn, I learned later, is third.)  Holmes has become a part of English-speaking culture in ways that Dracula hasn't.|`|sfUUml0Daa	dracula

a7364c50b7e6712ee3c77218a3232b45aa	That if we want to move on in science and find cures for some truly heartbreaking diseases we must back this research.  Objectors need to educate themselves before raising their placards so they don't shout embryo/foetus in error since stem cells can be taken from the umbilical cord joining a newborn baby to the mother's placenta.  This cord is either way dumped in a yellow bag and sent to the incinerator so what can the objection be?<br>  <br>  I take it George Bush's family have no motor-neurone disease, no muscular dystrophy, no Parkinson's since anyone with direct experience of seeing a family member (or a total stranger if they have any heart at all) suffer would have no hesitation in promoting advances in medical science to put an end to the cruelty and horror of these diseases.|`|wmBK9uASaa	A good thing to advance humanity|`|jpH4IjWnaa	A great step in science! :)|`|VA3tGarQaa	I think it's great.

AA10795350	The last movie I saw in theatres: "Watchmen." Very good music. A slew of classic songs -- Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are A-Changin'," Janis Joplin's "Me and Bobby McGee," Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah" -- and a very creative, intense score by composer Tyler Bates.<br>  <br>  The last movie I watched on DVD: "Miracle at St. Anna," Spike Lee's World War II thriller. Lee's composer of choice is Terence Blanchard, who is also a jazz trumpeter and bandleader. His brass-driven, emotional scores always satisfy and his "St. Anna" score is no exception.<br>  <br>  P.S. Nice question!|`|wO5FP6Mqaa	The last movie I watched in theaters was "Slumdog Millionaire".  Anybody who saw the movie can vouch for me when I way the soundtrack was really good.<br>  <br>  The last movie I saw on DVD was "Taxi Driver".  Again, really amazing soundtrack.  The theme really stood out, nice smooth jazz.|`|yl3Mns4Maa	The soundtrack to The Wrestler, which consists of mostly '80s hair metal, did nothing for me, but the movie was good, so it's okay.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	The last movie I watched was Wanted.  It had a pretty awesome soundtrack.  Here is one of the songs with scenes from the movie.  <br>  Nine Inch Nails - Every Day Is Exactly The Same<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5NIQQX_7vY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5NIQQX_7...</a>|`|wTNAOcl1aa	BASEketball? That movie i watch it least twice a week? AMAZING SOUNDTRACKKKKKKKKK|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	The last film I watched was Mirrors with Kiefer Sutherland. It wasn't as bad as the reviews suggested but not a classic either by any means.<br>  <br>  I couldn't, however, tell you any songs from the film as it is engaging at times but i'll edit and get the list.<br>  <br>  Edit: It was done by an orchestra and it did add to the atmosphere of the film.|`|DibFrwxlaa	The last movie I saw was Heartburn and the music was done by Carly Simon.  It was alright, pretty much what you'd expect from Carly Simon if she was asked to write a song or two for a bittersweet romance movie.  <br>  <br>  Here's the song, it's fairly corny:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNZ0ClNhOyg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNZ0ClNhO...</a>|`|tuvcxnJXaa	The last movie I saw was 'Watchmen'.    I liked the soundtrack, but found it interesting that they chose a (mostly) 60s soundtrack to complement a movie that takes place in 1985.|`|ebxwADDcaa	i saw Taken. <br>  <br>  the music was good.

GHrgVKy1aa	The person probably did a lot for them and they never got a chance to thank them for it, but I think that's because the person dies. It's hard to imagine this song being about someone living with things like "may angels lead you in" and "a song for a heart so big god wouldn't let it live" <br>  <br>  and also i have been told its  aboust those 2 poor kids who were killed in a car accident in cali years back. The ones who were the leaders of the Weezer fan club but im not sure.

jGqZdS2xaa	Well, I think because 2 people dropped out recently from DWTS they asked Mellisa to do it. But of course shes from the Bachelor and of course that was very smart because all of this drama from The Bachelor is so recent.<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps! <3|`|G7FkzyZsaa	I think having Melissa on is a waste of time-she's not a star, she's not even a reality tv Star. You sign up for a dating show and get dumped now you're famous??? Get real. Each bachelor and Bachelorette it's gets more and more dramatic-it would be like ABC asking Jerry Ferris to be on DWTS when Jenn gave him the boot from the Bachelorette?|`|AA12390047	I think ABC was desperate for someone to add to the ratings of DWTS and thought Melissa would be perfect because of all the publicity she was getting.  I'm sure they have backups, but everyone was talking about Melissa and lots of people will watch just to see how she does.

Just cause I'm a girl I can't like action movies?<br>  <br>  Well, I'm actually not excited about the movie but it has nothing to do with being a female lol. The first Fast and the Furious was really good but then they killed it. Did they have one or two sequels?

95gVLrIGaa	Only if I'm trying out for Miss America.<br>  <br>  "why is it so hard to obtain?"<br>  <br>  Because humans are selfish and greedy by nature. We want what others have and will do whatever we can to get it, which usually involves some kind of force. This is the main reason Communism doesn't work. Although the theory of everyone being equal and having their needs taken care of is a good idea, there will always be people that want more money, more power, and more control, no matter how rich or powerful they already are.|`|ml2FDYECaa	When you're talking about world peace...if you want it you have to fight for it. It just seems to get bigger before things get resolved. More people die, more politics get involved...more people die...yeah, die for world peace. And if you are not even talking about the world there are small things that people fight for. It sucks, but it has to happen. It almost seems that there will be life of chaos without it.|`|P0UpHgmLaa	it doesn't have to be impossible people just need to open thier eyes and see the problems in the world. only then can we fix them.|`|66b5bc1d43679f832ad9aac6cd2007d1aa	Yes. =]|`|dksB1B0Laa	Of course|`|1da4ddb0b32e38994b79631ed4df2811aa	Yessss.|`|uLelMuqZaa	Psh-yeah.|`|2T49GGLKaa	duh.|`|rAfg747daa	Yeah do you know how nice and beautiful the world would be if there waz peace no wars, fighting, stealing, law breaking, torturing, abuse and, so on.|`|46Gav6ahaa	Sure there's nothing wrong with "hoping"... =]|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	Everyone wants it, and it will always be impossible.  <br>  <br>  We've been fighting since the beginning of time, and it's only become more complicated because of money, greed, corruption, the media and greater population.<br>  <br>  While the notion is noble, it's totally unrealistic.|`|mgdkr6hvaa	sure, who wouldn't?<br>  but yea i think it's impossible.  <br>  the natural instincts of power, envy, and fighting will never end.|`|cblDE7M9aa	Yes<br>  Peace :P|`|CtgBMZewaa	duh

AA11345773	She's never really done that much for me, though I guess she wa better in 'The Girl Next Door', though she was also in 'Old Skool' as a naughty school girl and she was quite nice in that too.<br>  <br>  My best friend is completely in love with her and he seems to think they're going to get married one day, so you may have some competition there!

R5I5Znlmaa	Haha, I have a feeling this is English homework cause it's based off of Macbeth.<br>  <br>  Because of some funny parallels with the film and Macbeth, this movie turned out to be really clever and the casting was pretty good. This is one of my favorite modernized Shakespeare movies since "O".
NGNeT3rYaa	Well if they all practiced safe sex on soaps, we would have no more who's the daddy stories and then what would we do! LOL! The whole town probably has STD's by now! They would have too!|`|fjNxzd6Baa	Without unprotected sex on the soaps where would the next generation of twisted in-bred characters come from? Especially on AMC.|`|hRykRgWBaa	i agree. i think amanda is nasty anyway. i think she would have slept with adam if he was giving her enough money. basically, she's almost slept with every man  in town.|`|7CsLJ4I8aa	Even if you practice safe sex, accidents happen.  Condoms can be improperly applied or break or just not work.|`|CYcqQb6Caa	i agree with jen :-)|`|jHDeIPEfaa	I agree with you. David is so irresponsible. With his being a doctor, you'd think he'd know to use a condom especially with a woman like Amanda.

nrTVlo8Eaa	I hate to admit it, but I'm totally sad. I actually got teary eyed the other night when they were all getting ready to move on. I watch the show faithfully, but I can't admit it to anybody I know. LOL<br>  <br>  I will probably watch both Kendra's and Bridget's new shows. Especially Bridget's.<br>  <br>  Um, yeah, when I started tearing up, I stole a look at my husband and pretented I needed to sneeze. He just ignored me ..lol.<br>  <br>  Oh, and it's not the mansion so much we want them to go back to, because they NEED their own lives. We just enjoyed watching those three girls and their chemistry together. I suspect those twin sisters are never going to be as interesting, and I doubt "The Girls Next Door" will hold my interest after the current girls are gone.|`|AJEYXzIUaa	there is? wow i really am sad, i won't watch out of protest!|`|QtjnmEzoaa	Aren't they all engaged now? I know one of them is engaged to Hank Baskett from the Philidelphia Eagles. I doubt their fiancee(s) would appreciate them going back to the mansion.|`|a9jwXzbnaa	It is sad, I'll check out season 6 to see if it's any good, but I'll probably lose interest since there'll be new girls. I think it would be cool if Sara Underwood became a girlfriend.. she was one of my favorites that the girls hung out with. Anyway, I'll be looking for both Bridget and Kendra's new shows to.

With all the world united against a common enemy, the world is now actually united: Veidt's plan for global peace.<br>  <br>  I'm discussing the end of The Watchmen on my blog: www.enditthisway.com.

2Zm03QGIaa	oh my...it's quite long lmao<br>  <br>  alright so i somehow started out in this strange auditorium. i look down and notice that i'm wearing my brother's baggy sweatpants and shirt, and a huge jacket and i look like a dude. for some reason i can fit my laptop in my jacket pocket and it's in there. i'm sitting in the front row waiting when all of a sudden panic at the disco comes in and brendon urie (i have a huge crush on him) sits in the first row a couple seats down from me. then my principal gets on the stage and starts talking about water and brendon gets up to leave. i get up and follow him and when i get outside there's just a dock and water stretching out for miles. i have to get from this dock to the other to get to brendon. so i jump in the water and start swimming but i realize my laptop's in my jacket and i'm afraid it'll short-circuit so i jump out. i find myself on a boardwalk with a ladder so i climb it and then i see these weird fly things shooting fireballs at me. i dodge them and go through this huge obstacle course where i almost die on like every dock. finally i reach the final one and i'm about to touch brendon when i wake up.<br>  <br>  haha lol|`|GGEAttkgaa	I had a dream when IT was chasing after me and theni locked my self in the bathroom but then he unlocked the door by using a hair pin and then it was scary :S but weird|`|AQi8RAK3aa	i actually had feelings for someone after i had a dream about them.. lmao|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Cheating on my boyfriend; when l was in love with him back then, wtf?|`|comuT2fkaa	one of them consists of me being chased round by a hobo.|`|6S8KjBLQaa	I have been running on a circular table with the Lucky Charms mascot running away from the mean ol Grinch in my dreams for YEARS and I am damn PROUD of it

v05jwlZWaa	It's hard to tell what scene they'd need to shoot in Vancouver, given that they can make any set out of any place.<br>  Directors don't necessarily go from end to beginning; they go in whatever order's convenient to where they are and who they have with them because actors have very inflexible schedules.|`|kXxaUnSUaa	There's some pics of Taylor Lautner practising his dirt bike in Vancouver, so I guess they are filming the Jacob/Bella bike scenes there.<br>  <br>  Also, Rob Pattinson is there, as well as the other Cullens - so bearing in mind the Cullens don't feature much in New Moon, I would guess they are using Vancouver or somewhere around there to film the Forks scenes this time.|`|HRtqw6cbaa	Well, for Twilight they filmed mostly in Oregon and Washington State, but for New Moon they will be filming mostly in Vancouver because it has been said that the aura given off in Vancouver is more dreary and sad, probably relating to Bella's comatose-like state when Edward leaves, also, they are filming there just because the weather is MUCH more predictable than WA or Oregon. The weather is really the reason but of course they exaggerate and make it about the mood. haha:) Hope this helps:)|`|0RinjMbJaa	Most of the movie will be shot in Vancouver the only scenes that wont be would be the Italian scenes which are going to be shot in the real Volterra Italy.<br>  <br>  and directors dont always go from beginning to end they have to shoot around the actors schedule so whenever the actors are available that is when they will shoot they also try to do the most difficult shots first.|`|WqJk2yJiaa	in new moon they have a lot of spots to go to. and they usually just shoot the scenes depending on where they are, all the Vancouver scenes in Vancouver, all Europe scenes in Europe. ect.

kwMA5I1iaa	I think there is, yes. I'm 21 and back when I was 15-17...it wasn't as stressful as todays teens. First of all, I think home work should be banned. lol.

Every generation has its own problems. Sure there are drugs and gangs now, but they've been around. This generation hasn't had to worry about being drafted to a war like vietnam. Nor does this generation have to worry about segregation like our grandparents did. <br>  I think teenagers put unnecessary stress on themselves because of superficial things they see in the media. Parents also aren't as strict as they used to be. That doesn't help.|`|AZtphDJ2aa	oh goodness yes|`|JGjpc7Itaa	Absolutely!  I would never survive being a teen in today's world!

But the girl I was in love with, well, her and I both met when our dads worked with each other when I was about 10. Then we didn't talk for a couple years, and when I had this thing with one of her friends, her and I started to catch up. Then a couple of years later the friend of hers I had a thing with was single, and I hooked her up with my step brother. Then we started talking and she told me she liked me out of the blew. I wasn't expecting it. But it was funny cause I had liked her for a long time before she told me. But I was too chicken to tell her. Cause I mean we didn't talk too much, so I didn't want to be creepy. But you know how they say when you kiss the person you love for the first time the world stops? That is how it felt with me. Even though I am 16 I know there will be more fish in the sea, but so far I am convinced I was in love with her. We broke up cause her mom had found out we had sex.

But hey thats what happens to every band that ends up going mainstream.<br>  <br>  I especially get annoyed by those people like asking what is that song on the radio and then they start singing the wrong lyrics and mess up the whole song.

71dc8b0b34bc9146e70f8ed00ac5dfdbaa	Follow the link to the best theory I've read.|`|Mh9dP99saa	----------------------------------------...<br>   <br>  Ok, this may be right, and if it isn't then its one of the biggest coincidences I have ever seen. Theres factual background information in it to introduce the theory, so bear with it please. <br>  <br>  Ok, so here goes. <br>  <br>  Something caught my attention in the mural in the hatch that rekindled some old research knowledge from high school days. I decided to refresh my knowledge of it, and heres what I came up with (I am referring to the circle with the dot in it, or the zero with the point...thats how i said it to myself and thats what started this). <br>  <br>  Philosophical Idea Relationship <br>  There is a philosophical concept that describes the return of consciousness to higher thoughts and awareness. Metaphorically, it refers to your consciousness spiraling outward towards a higher awareness. Often referred to as the Zero Point, it is a game that requires one to create and restore balance and realized that it is just a game itself. “If you feel a part of your soul in that game called out to you - with messages about changes there and in our game - then pay attention - as all things are parallel and move in spiraling motions.” Lets look at the mural Jack looked at in the hatch. <br>   <br>  <br>  If you look right above the number 42, you see a circle with a dot in it. Or is it a Zero with a point in it? Lets move on to the blue, hieroglyphic eye right above the word “sick”. This philosophy also incorporates many Eye metaphors. One of which being The Right Eye of Horus, which is a reference to the information stored in the DNA priests and other people from ancient times (information referring to Creational Geometry), in which this information will be released at the end of the world. The color blue makes reference to the end of the world. This whole philosophy is called “Atlantis Rising”. The people the information was stored in were people who were resident on Atlantis. <br>  <br>  Atlantis <br>  The Lost City. It’s location is generally unknown, but theorized (believed best theorized by the following picture) <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Atlantis was an ancient island that sunk years ago. An island with a mild climate with a power source described as mysterious electromagnetic crystals. The location above is the proposed location at that time. But it lies in the middle of a tectonic plate that pretty much flows around the world. It is speculated to have moved due to shifts in the plates. <br>  <br>  Mayan History <br>  Mayan history also tells of a lost island named Mu. This island is historically believed to be the same as Atlantis. The Mayans were also very good at math and astrology, operating off of a number system that has a base of 20 (like the metric system has a base of 10), they were able to create a calendar 1000s of years ago that said there are 360 days in a year (which is extraordinarily accurate). This is known as the Mayan Calendar. The calendar it self predicted the end of the world in 2012, because it used a deductive math structure. The end of the world would represent events like their god Quetzalcoatl returning as a messiah. <br>  <br>  The DHARMA Initiative <br>  Created in 1970 by two scientists and funded by the Hanso Foundation, it is an initiative set up on the island to analyze the geological phenomena of the island. It was said that there are six stations set up on the island. We also know from the Hanso Foundation website that they have different initiatives running as well, including “The Life Extension Project”, “The electromagnetic research initiative”, “The mathematical forecasting initiative”, “The cryogenics development imperative”, and “The accelerated remote viewing training facility”. <br>  <br>  Connecting the Dots <br>  The philosophy of “Atlantis Rising” clearly represents what is happening psychologically to the castaways (take Locke for a basic example). The other ideal are too. The Zero Point is on the Mural. The Blue Right Eye of Horus is also on the mural representing the end of the world coming “Out of the Blue”. And also the Creational Geometry information to be released (can be represented by the priest found in the tree, even though he wasn’t really a priest, but its still symbolic). <br>  <br>  Other indications of the mural include the Mayan Messiah, Quetzacoatl. Translated into English as meaning “Feathered Serpent” or “Serpent Bird”, if you really look at the right of the mural, you can see what can be construed as a bird with its beak wide open around the word “Sick” (you can even infer a tongue there too). The everything to the north of it looks like overlapping shapes of similar color (feathers?). The possibility of this being the monster on the island cannot be rejected. <br>  <br>  We know that something went wrong in the middle of the DHARMA initiative that requires them to push the button every 108 minutes (which is the sum of the infamous numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42). But what went wrong? I propose that the island started to move along the rifts. The island was stati

(sorry for the rant.) and yes, the talent (or lack thereof) of every single actor on every single disney show is apalling. obviously the talent scouts who find these walking shite-spouters are tone deaf, blind, and functionally handicapped, bless their little hearts.
fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	It seems that you are under a viral attack. Did this come over you all of a sudden? If you're dizzy there's an infection in your ear, or near. It may not be an ear infection but if it's a viral infection near the sinuses or the ear, that will do it. <br>  Also, it matter where your head hurts. if it's more towards the forehead, it could be sinus infection, if it's more towards the back, you could have a head cold, also could be flu symptoms. <br>  Allright... there's a lot of guesses, but basically what you feel under your jawbone, are your lymph nodes which during an infectious condition will swell up and hurt. <br>  Provided there's a fever of anywhere between 99.9 and 102.0 you need to go to see a doctor. Take some tylenol to bring the fever down and go see a doctor. That's a sign that there might be a bacterial infection which is something you want to target early. <br>  In case it's a flu, some flu medicine should help with the symptoms while the body recovers. Tylenol is safe almost anytime. Please male sure you don't over dose. Read the instructions and dose your Tylenol accordingly. <br>  OD on Tylenol will cause some nasty liver damage. <br>  If the fever does not decrease after 30 minutes from taking Tylenol, you can take Ibuprophen or Motrin (same thing) one dose (that corresponds with the dosage on the label) Ibuprophen (Motrin) and Acetaminophen (Tylenol) do not react with each other. <br>  Drink lots of fluids, and rest. <br>  if you have any concerns at all, beyond this please do see your doctor.
kXxaUnSUaa	Hey Rob, <br>  <br>  I also love this movie (and the soundtrack!) and found the characters to be much more realistic then usual teen movies. There ARE a lot of very cool girls like Norah around - but you'll probably find at the age of 16 that they are probably the quieter girls at school. Most of these girls will feel that they don't fit in or are not cool, because there not part of the 'in' crowd or cheerleading squad, or whatever. But when they get to college, they'll be surrounded by other great people who were also not in the 'cool' crowd at school, so they will blossom in to outgoing & confident young women!<br>  <br>  So what I would recommend is that you start talking to the girls who are not strutting around like they're the hottest girls in school, ask them what kind of music they like, etc. and I think you'll be surprised. And if you don't find any at school, you definitely will at college! <br>   <br>  You sound like a great guy, so good luck! :)|`|jqbS2KW0aa	I haven't seen the movie, sorry. :( I just had to answer cause you sound really sweet. I'm sure you'll find somebody. :)|`|J9OUW7JRaa	I just watched that movie yesterday! I loved it too! I like totally fell in love with nick when i watched it! lol but yeah trust me, if your like nick in that movie i dont really know why you dont have a girlfriend.  Yeah i definatley think people are more like that in college ( i wouldn't know because im also 16), maybe in a few years, the girls you know will mature and will stop caring what others think and focus more on being themselves and not what everyone else wants them to be. :)

B2ESM0Hmaa	My advice is to make a list of characters YOU like/want to cosplay and go from there. Remember to think about things like seasonal weather, maneuverability and comfort.<br>  In my experience it's MUCH more fun to cosplay a character you like then one you know nothing about but look like. It'll be easier to meet fans of the same things and you can show your appreciation for that character or series.|`|mr5qcM3Laa	OOO um sheena from tales of symphonia!<br>   <a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/sheena%20tales%20of%20symphonia/hevancloud/Tales%20of%20symphonia/sheena.jpg?o=14" rel="nofollow">http://media.photobucket.com/image/sheen...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  ummm.....

effa2749a1aefd0659d3b62a7475bac2aa	There's sure a lot of people doing it now but it's generally quite illegal and can get you in varying degrees of trouble depending on who your ISP is or what country you're from. One thing the movie industry will do is track you and complain to the abuse department of your ISP about your activities being a copyright infringement. They even do this with "fake" or 'bait" files so I can't recommend downloading movies that way even though 80% of the internet traffic is people downloading torrents. In most cases with any movies you have to buy it, and if you get it for free the movie industry regards it as stealing. Downloading Torrents itself isn't illegal if you download trailers, or any other file that's not copywritten.|`|GZ9LjS13aa	download = illegal period<br>  Same fine as downloading as from limewire<br>  You seen the fines on the movies when they start, like warnings by FBI<br>  Same fine, probably double for pissing them off.|`|Gj1zNWL9aa	Sometimes they can trak u to ur comp. and give u a big fine. but its unliky if many people use the site|`|ErYVsSDKaa	Ok. So you probably have seen the advertisements that downloading is illegal. It is actually advertised on all the DVDs that you can get in the Store since 2003 or 2005 at the latest. Fines may vary depending on what you download. But still it is not a smart thing to do.

HRtqw6cbaa	Yes, and you have to remember that if it is a major film, they have alot of money for air mail, and they even ship equipment by boat sometimes, or of course, they drive. Some of the other equipment is rented or borrowed, and costumes are often bought close to where they are filming, although clothes are much easier to transport. And obviously if they are filming where the production company and sets are, there is no need for transportation, such as hollywood.|`|dpSTgytfaa	i wouldnt be surprised if a lot of what they use is local stuff they rent or borrow. <br>  <br>  But the specialized cameras and such probably have their own plane.

Maby you could get some girls to.<br>  You could rent a local rugby club or another venue, get a DJ, and invite everyone for a raving party?<br>  You could go out around a big shopping town or centre close to you.

For all you know that person might actually like to stay in your band.  Just pay them a little extra but it will be worth it.

That 10 or less people will soon grow into a bigger crowd if they spread the word that they liked your performance.  Also so the place ask you to comeback and play again.

m4PtEEDNaa	...actually, there HAVE been a few attempts to concoct a contemporary female horror villain, but they haven't quite panned out as well as Jason, Freddy or Michael...<br>  <br>  ...there was the Mary Lou character from the 2nd & 3rd "Prom Night" movies...<br>  <br>  ...there was the Angela character, from the "Night of the Demons" movies (...although Angela may well see renewed interest, in the upcoming "...Demons" remake)...<br>  <br>  ...there was the Lilith character, from the "Witchouse" movies...|`|u70TaWI5aa	You know you are right cause the last girl Icon that I can remember was Carrie. I can't really remember anyone else. She was way back in the day so I do say it is time.|`|dtmdsQMFaa	Well, there are a few female villains in horror films, look at Sakura from "The Ring" and the girl from "The Grudge." How about Annie Wilkes from "Misery," the cat lady that appeared in "Cat People" and Agnus from "Black Christmas." But, I do agree, we need a particular well-known female icon. It just seems male psychopaths are taking over the big screen!|`|1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	You ever seen the movie "Shrooms"? Or "Black Xmas"?

uctxzjIIaa	The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya - 14 episodes - high school girl appears to have the ability to alter reality on a whim, though she doesn't know it. She accidentally chooses a group of paranormal people (an alien, a time-traveller) to be around her (or since she's interested in those types, perhaps she altered reality to make them be around her...), while they secretly try to prevent her subconscious from altering reality any more.<br>  <br>  Record of Lodoss War (OVA version - 13 episodes; TV version - 26 episodes) - Frequently called the Lord of the Rings of anime, it is the epic medieval fantasy tale of a group of adventurers trying to prevent an invasion by an evil country, which might throw the entire world into chaos. The TV version sticks closer to the original light novel (which was based on an actual D&D campaign the writer participated in), but the two have largely similar stories.<br>  <br>  Rune Soldier - 26 episodes - From the same writer as Lodoss War (and again based on another D&D campaign), this story is a comedic tale about a mage who is forced to go on a major adventure to get the components for a new wand, after he gets enraged and breaks his old one on a monster's head (clubbing the creature with it instead of casting a spell at it like a sensible mage would). He ends up being accompanied by a team of three women adventurers after accidentally doing something to make one of them thing her god ordered her to marry him (much to her dismay).<br>  <br>  Slayers - 26 episodes (not counting the two 26 episode followup serieses)- Lina Inverse is a fireball slinging mage known for stealing from bandits and posessing one of the most powerful attack spells in the world: the Dragon Slave. But when she stumbled into the compainionship of a sword-wielding dufus named Gaurey and possession of a statuette that is drawing a lot of attention from a lot of directions, she finds herself in a struggle for survival and to stop the resurrection of the evil god whom the Dragon Slave's power is derived from.<br>  <br>  Witch Hunter Robin - 26 episodes - Set in roughly modern day, Robin Sena is a young woman who was raised in a convent. She is a witch with a proficiency in fire, and has just been assigned to a special law enforcement team designed to hunt down other witches who use their powers for illegal purposes. However, her skills require a great deal of precision, and every time she uses them, she goes slightly more blind. And some of the tools her group uses have mysterious and questionable origins. Just who are these guys?|`|O2hmjOPyaa	My suggestion for you is the anime series "Pretear." It's short (only thirteen episodes), and has a magic, fantasy, romance theme.<br>  <br>  - Himeno Awayuki was a normal sixteen-year old girl until her father married a woman who happens to be rich. Since then, she has been perceived as an outcast by both her new stepsisters and her classmates. Later Himeno finds out from seven men called the Leafe Knights that she is something called Pretear, a girl who has the power to merge with and control the nature of the elemental-oriented powers from the Leafe Knights and stop an evil being called the Princess of Disaster.|`|86VgnUmQaa	<a href="http://www.theanimenetwork.com/Online-Player/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theanimenetwork.com/Online-Pl...</a> is really awesome.

Cause some people dye it like a shade lighter or darker & you can't really tell so you just ask to make sure|`|EotRDimLaa	yeah that happens to me also. But when I notice a change on someone else, i dont ask.

(:<br>  <br>  Peaceful, & calm, & ... can't think of a word. A place to think?|`|eBHQBeF7aa	Kinda.|`|gP7IB2XCaa	Not really-They are peaceful, but not if you remember all the dead people under you|`|cYFAo75Yaa	no, because some are...people relate them to death which is dark and gloomy, but if they were not a grave yard but a lot of land with sculptures, then they too could see it in that way...|`|YMnTveWuaa	Maybe.

I want to die slow, so I have more time to live, and try to escape. One of those 3.<br>  Most likely beat to death, because my screams and the noise would awake my family members.|`|At8D5Xu2aa	With incredibly wild passionate sex.  (Please note murderer must be a very hot woman or the deal's off; some balding forty year old guy, I'm a just shoot the mo fo)|`|BKr3y30maa	Shoot him with my gun.

No way I'm going down like some chump hehe. They may have a weapon, but the chances of them getting choked out are quite high. The only way they're getting me is from me being too exhausted to fight back anymore. After that go ahead and send one through my head.<br>  <br>  Come get me! =p|`|DHf3aqPAaa	i would look him straight in the eyes and say in my most serious voice;<br>  " don't annoy me I AM running outa places to hide the bodies ; )|`|nVZqPut3aa	I would want to be thrown off a really high building.

Also the gun shot would alert my parents, and family members that there was someone in the house.|`|5oGdBwh5aa	Hanging.I have always been fascinated by that. crazy i know but you asked. LOL|`|7585zXZIaa	hmm well id say shot but i dont like loud noises. So i guess throw me over the banister. Im odd that way|`|OCHhJWpHaa	put me to sleep|`|kKPT2VCfaa	I would not let him kill me!

bf5084d1ec35330c95ff7b7bd883bbffaa	It's most likely based upon anthropologist, Dr. William M. Bass of the University of Tennessee's Anthropological Research Facility.  He ran something affectionately known as, "The Body Farm", where decomposition of human remains are studied.  They have provided great research data for the FBI and other law enforcement.|`|24UPDIBTaa	Kathy Reichs is the basis of the show. <br>  <br>  From the link below on her:<br>  <br>  In addition to technical books, Reichs has written eleven novels to date, which have been translated into 30 languages. Her first novel, Déjà Dead, won the 1997 Arthur Ellis Award for Best First Novel.<br>  <br>  The fictional heroine in her novels, Temperance "Tempe" Brennan, is also a forensic anthropologist. Her lifestyle closely mimics that of her creator, with Reichs stating that Brennan and she "have the same CV" and that "Some of Tempe's personality traits are also mine", but there are differences in their personal lives such as the character's alcoholism. A good portion of the novels is based on real life science, and Reichs has stated that she is "fastidiously conscientious about getting the science right". She has used experience from her career in her novels, and said about Deja Dead that "Everything I describe in the book, I actually did". In the novel Grave Secrets she uses her experience from her visit to Guatemala.<br>  <br>  A 2005 FOX television series, Bones, is inspired by Reichs' life and writing. The series borrows the name of the books' heroine, Temperance "Bones" Brennan. As in the books, Temperance (Emily Deschanel) is a forensic anthropologist, however there are many differences, the character is younger and a bit of a "social nerd", the television series is based in Washington, D.C. and Brennan moonlights as an author, writing about a fictional forensic anthropologist named Kathy Reichs. The TV series does not tie in with the book series.<br>  <br>  Reichs works as a producer on the show to "keep the science honest" and has appeared in the episode Judas on a Pole, in which she played Professor Constance Wright, a forensic anthropologist on the board performing Zack Addy's Thesis Defense. Because of her involvement with the TV series she had to give up working with the military and UN.|`|YfRjYAtDaa	It is based off of a book, written by an actual famous female anthropologist..So don't listen to that dude..and i'm pretty sure temperance brennan is a fake name, but if you just google or wikipedia it you'll find the lady's real name, i'm sure =)

Or so I'm told.|`|3BvMQCjwaa	Virginity is precious, something that uhh... CANNOT BE REPLACED, so too bad dude.

FcbRUYExaa	If you really want to read Twilight, then get to a library, find one that has the series. I say this because after the first book YOU will want to read the second and so on... ALL TOGETHER, they get pricey if you are in the wrong store. But why buy when you can borrow? The Twilight books were topsellers, someone in your town has to have them, and should be willing to let you borrow them if they are done (even if you do make a temporary trade or give them a dollar or something) Then you could let your mom know that instead of buying her the book, if you could get some money to get the movie! You solve one problematic question and then resolve an unknown outcome of asking about the dvd... Good Luck!!!|`|wqaFrcEYaa	Maybe you should choose the film or the book, or ask your mum to split it half with you. I reccomend you read the book, its great. If your mum liked it she will understand. <br>  Hope I helped.|`|fyai9o7Naa	so your mum has read it and now you want to?<br>  give her hints...say that you need a good book to read or something like that...then ask her if she has read any good books lately and hope she suggests twilight :D|`|jpXyfOtoaa	just ask that is not being greedy|`|lQ80rqhFaa	Instead of asking your mom to buy you the book, why don't you go to a library or something? And Twilight is still in theaters so why don't you go to a local movie theater with a couple of friends? But, if you want to buy the book, then just wait until the week is over and she might remember. If by the end of the week she still doesn't get you the book, just (as nicely as you can) remind her that you wanted the book.

rVBdSrrXaa	Yes.  It is sending a wrong message to children.  It is saying that if a man beats you repeatedly it is okay to go back to him.  Boys need to know that this kind of behavior is NOT okay, and girls need to learn that they should have respect for themselves.

That is assuming they are signed anywhere with Viacom.  If not, Nickelodeon is just be foolish.|`|d2c8dc85a1c725d9e3458a6b993f60beaa	yes. because a lot of people know what happened between chris and ri, and as celebs they should set good examples for the kids. if a girl beater is on a kids award show or whatever it is then i guess these kids would think is right to beat their girlfriends.|`|ulBW2m62aa	I bet he'll beat her up in front of all the kids.|`|bmwR7RdMaa	it removes the main focus if they both go there since people start questioning about that incident....|`|YyaKq8praa	I thought that they made a good couple, and everything until the incident.

Had a nasty bruise to left elbow and left shoulder.<br>  <br>  Both still bother me from time to time and will for the rest of my life. <br>  <br>  My right ankle will bother me from time to time as well.|`|be9f617f5a598e41354941dbb40d5e3eaa	I had an epidural that was given to me when I was having my son. i didn't want it but was told I HAD to have it. <br>  <br>  They partially paralyzed me and told me I would never walk again. For two years, two very painful years I relearned how to walk and even now especially behind my knees and my knees themselves it hurts so bad I wake up in the middle of the night and nothing helps.|`|wT9KXIC0aa	The most painful thing that's happened to me would be when I pulled a muscle in my back, I could hardly twitch without crying out in pain, I know it probably sounds wussy, but it really f*cking hurt.|`|d5ug5W5kaa	thankfully only a sprained ankle. i couldnt move it! do not ever run in heels.|`|nVCf8EC5aa	Hit a tree going about 45 Mph on skiis. Starting from the feet up.... I broke my heel into 7 pieces, shattered my ankle (it is now made of bone from my pelvis and coral), Achilles tendon came loose when my Heel and Ankle broke, broke 4 ribs, knocked a few teeth through my lower lip, smashed lips up bad, tore one nostril almost off, broken nose, fractured cheek, and severe concussion.<br>  <br>  I was up almost at the top of Crystal Mountain here in Washington state. The lifts were closed because it was May and we had hiked up the mountain with our skiis. So my friends had to break into a ski patrol shack and get the emergency toboggan to get me off the mountain.<br>  <br>  Honestly though the worst pain I felt was waking up from surgery to replace my ankle and screw my heel together. WOW off the scale kinda pain there.<br>  <br>  I remember thinking damn what did they use drills and hammers on me.|`|FZ1dy9uCaa	I broke my leg during a football game when I was 16 (Sophomore)<br>  <br>  I had 3 different people land on me, and unfortunately my leg was caught :(|`|lpznO5Inaa	I dislocated my shoulder and cracked the end of my collarbone playing football.

AA11209233	It worked for Katie Holmes!<br>  <br>  I'm kidding.  Certainly improving yourself so that you'd be a celebrity's equal would be worth doing, but focusing too much of your mind on someone you have not met is more than stalkery, it will actually make it harder to become a person who is good enough to be with that celebrity--it could stunt your personal growth.  Finally, when you do meet your favorite celebrity, if you love him before you have met him, you won't be able to attract him because you won't be enough of a challenge or he'll think you just love his fame or money.  It's hard to be real with someone when you've been harboring fake fantasies for years.|`|4cWtH7X2aa	No it's not, unless you're mentally unstable. You don't just fall in love with someone you've never met. You can be attracted to them or fantasize but if you truly believe you are in love then there's something seriously wrong.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	Your first mistake is thinking anyone is "to good" for you, it just isn't so, second, it's impossible to fall in love with someone you don't know!  You can lust after them, but that's not love!|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	No, it's called infatuation or stalking. You can't fall in love with someone you don't know personally!|`|q4pLY5F8aa	Yes, it's possible.|`|dNAEJttLaa	Yes its possible...<br>  But you have to know the celebrity.<br>  When I say know, i mean you should know him at a personal level,<br>  You should not just be seeing the celebrity on tv without knowing him/her personally and be thinking your in love!<br>  Most people that think they are in love with a celebrity, its mostly obsession and most of the time it's temporary!<br>  You can't say you love someone if you don't know the person.<br>  <br>  P.S Im excluding love at first sight cause that's different and it rarely rarely happens! You can't see different people everyday and think its love!|`|in0fQxN1aa	NO. That is how a stalker starts. You can't possibly love them because you only know the part of them they present to the world, not the part that's the real non-celebrity them.|`|AA11821859	Sometimes it is Possible to Fall in love with a Celebrity.  Heck I am deeply in love with Cillian Murphy with those sexy Blue Eyes of his.|`|M3pufPlnaa	It's possible.. some of my classmates love the Jonas Brothers? Joe in particular...and they want to marry him?  they have calmed down now and some actually dislike him now!! <br>  its creepy :)|`|akcGfgdcaa	It's possible...though....slightly creepy...|`|159b24ad2cea2ed0e8f59b46099c5829aa	Absolutelч NOT!|`|iJbslaQNaa	nothing's impossible!<br>  cheers|`|GmRMniJSaa	Yes.<br>  My friend was.<br>  And then she found out Lance Bass was gay.|`|uOZqu5wAaa	Only if you know them personally. Otherwise, you're just stalking them or simply daydreaming. You can't really KNOW a celebrity enough to fall in love with them if you're only reading of them in the trash tabloids in the grocery store or watching all the "entertainment tonight" kind of shows that are out there.|`|mirOK6Bzaa	NEVER improve yourself for them because if you're not good enough for them just being YOU then they're the ones that aren't good enough for you. Plus, if you really start dating someone famous they should see you as you and that you're already perfect.|`|bd34c1c498bf77ed11bff8328060c47baa	If you know them personally, then yeah. But you can't be "in love" with someone you don't even know. And they don't even know you exist.<br>  <br>  And I think anyone who changes themselves just to "be good enough for someone" is pathetic. What's wrong with being yourself?|`|tiEUVhMKaa	yeah I am in love with one but hey that's me but im not creepy in love with him like i would kill him or lock him up in my basement or anything now that's scary. besides why not fall in love with one they are human 2 just with allot of fame and fortune|`|nCMUA50Raa	no but it is a good way to motivate you to look better....i do it all the time...not fall in love but pretend like i will get to bang them one day lol ;)|`|WInyhO09aa	def. not.|`|55t9z5maaa	yes definitely iam who are you in love with|`|zZVHdfD4aa	Here's a thought - turn off the TV and lower your standards.|`|FWuurnk2aa	yes|`|n6Cj49Pnaa	huh? I didnt get that.|`|BNcNAMNPaa	'We create them in our minds, in our dreams. That's why they're so perfect'.<br>  <br>  And as for improving yourself, some people do think that by doing so that one day the celebrity will spot them in the audience at a concert, and they will live happily ever after... I think that it is ok to improve yourself, but it is even better when you get to the point in your life where you think ' actually, are they good enough for me?'
gUcCVkSMaa	Pantie and bra set. She looks so good out of her undies it's hard to decide if I should give them to her.|`|1xmpTUuPaa	an "i'm with stupid" t-shirt. never saw it coming|`|16O243dXaa	I bought him his favorite coffee mix cuz' he takes very good care of me!|`|mshYf0nBaa	I bought her new lingerie even though i felt embarassed buying it...the cashier said that i was redder than tomato ahahaha,....my girlfriend rewarded me graciously
DAm5iVsdaa	I dont think you did anything wrong fighting with him.  If you felt like he had the hots for her he probably does even if he says he doesn't.  90% of communication is non-verbal, so you were probably picking up on something.  Yell at him again.|`|6UdDwO4gaa	first off...your first fight..props. Second...if he acted like he had the hots for her...he set himself up for it. He was trying to make you jealous. Ive been in that fight a million times in 8 months. I know how you feel!!! But you dont have to make anything up. If you feel bad...tell him..."look I dont wanna fight again but what do you expect me to do? You made it look like you were into her this whole time just to make me jealous probably to see if I care. Well you saw I do and Im not sorry I got jealous..you set it up like that. You cant be mad at me for that." or something like that. Hope this helps..just dont think you did anything wrong. Guys do that...and girls do to. we all do it to see how much the other one cares. Good Luck!!

DtsxooZUaa	Look up "we can do it"<br>  <br>  From Wiki: <br>  <br>  Rosie the Riveter is a cultural icon of the United States, representing the American women who worked in war factories during World War II, many of whom worked in the manufacturing plants that produced munitions and materiel. These women took new jobs and sometimes the places of the male workers who were in the military. The character is now considered a feminist icon in the US, and a herald of women's economic power to come.|`|AA11971925	It sounds like you're describing Rosie the Riveter.<br>  Was it an image like one of these?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.artexpertswebsite.com/pages/artists/artists_l-z/rockwell/Rockwell_RosieTheRiveter1943.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.artexpertswebsite.com/pages/a...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://archive.ccm.edu/rosie/images/WeCanDoItPoster%5B1%5D.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://archive.ccm.edu/rosie/images/WeCa...</a>

ETFaQiTzaa	-"Fight Club"  --based on one of my favorite books.  Great plot, great acting, great dialogue--insane solo fight by Norton.<br>  <br>  -"The Boondock Saints"  --Great fight scenes--the best being "There Was a Fire Fight."  Nice, conflicting look into vigilantism.<br>  <br>  -"Leon the Professional"  --I watched it last night, actually.  Like "The Boondock Saints" but when a more socially challenged, childish hitman.  And a really young Natalie Portman.  Also--Gary Oldman's best performance ever.  Wow.<br>  <br>  -"The Assassination of Jesse James by that Coward Robert Ford"  --Beautiful, beautiful movie with fantastic performance by Casey Affleck.  I'd like to see it again with a DVD that isn't scratched.<br>  <br>  -"In Bruges"  --the best movie of 2008, that I've seen so far.

733a18bc9b818b5f9d75e4032cd40880aa	Whats the matter with that?  Hey this is 2009 not 1818, anyone can be knowledgeable about any given subject.  My mother knew all there was to know about boxing and even today I can tell you quite a bit about the wrestling especially way back with the Huck and Bare Cat Wright and all the others.  Does that make me strange, because I'm a 62 year old woman?  <br>  <br>  Come on now I don't think he had a damn thing to be embarrassed about!

RtHBnYSmaa	Danny will win..unless someone else has a major family tragedy.|`|4VdBPCU1aa	ooh thats a tough one hmmm...<br>  Danny Gokey is pretty good but I know a lot of people don't like him too much cuz he's kinda cockyish...not to humble. But he'll probably get a few pity votes for his wife dying.<br>  <br>  Adam Lambert is also very good, but with the whole gay pictures him making out with a guy thing will probably damage his chances a bit...<br>  <br>  Allison, the red haired 16 year old, is actually very good. Based on her first performance, I wouldn't be majorly surprised if she won it.<br>  <br>  The roughneck dude I don't think will make it much longer...<br>  <br>  Megan is good but I don't see her winning it. Same with Anoop and Jorge. And Lil Rounds will probably make the top few, but I don't see her winning it.<br>  The blind dude Scott will probably make it pretty far but mostly because people are like oooh its so great that he does this even though hes blind! ..he's pretty good budefinitelyly not the best. <br>  <br>  Jasmine is goodish but personally I just don't like her.<br>  <br>  Alexis Grace is really actually pretty good, but shes forgetable, and based on her last performance, has a very "old" voice, which may or may not make a difference.<br>  <br>  Matt Giraud and Kris Allen I highly doubt will win, they're not incredible and they're rather forgetable.<br>  <br>  So yes, I'd say either Danny Gokey, Adam Lambert, or Allison.|`|IKnEeMXLaa	Danny Gokey or Scott Macintyre, they are both great musicians!|`|76740ad28a40658e6b40499a8b2cb447aa	Right now, I think it may come down to Adam and Danny, but I'm kind of going for Danny.|`|lvTJ8miHaa	i'll let you know after we find out who wins season 8 and see who auditions for season 9.<br>  <br>  But i think it will be either danny or adam for season 8|`|jOu4dtUiaa	That is such a tough call, there are so many good ones this year. The only ones I don't really like much at all are Jasmine Murray, and Kris Allen I think they are just okay but not great.

I like the part when they're going to the hospital and Micheal is trying to get Dwight to shut up and threatens to fire him, and he goes "You can't fire me!  I don't work in this van!"  And then later they ask him his middle name for a form, and he goes "Danger."  Funny stuff. ;p<br>  <br>  Random quotes that I felt like adding (because I'm a dork and love The Office, plus I'm bored):<br>  <br>  "I'm not superstitious...but I am a little stitious." - Micheal<br>  <br>  "Oh, hello little one!  You are the future!" - Dwight<br>  <br>  "You're evil like a hobbit." - Dwight<br>  <br>  Jim: "I want a full report on my desk by the end of the day, or you will receive a full disadulation."<br>  Dwight: "What's a dis- what's that?"<br>  Jim: "Oh you don't wanna know." <br>  <br>  "Fool me once, strike one. Fool me twice, strike three." - Micheal

qKEKLOaEaa	You can get broken up clips on Youtube or you can buy episodes off of itunes. (There is a link on the NBC Days web page to do that).

I think that it is black's with they're own insecurities about dating outside they're race. There is a whole world of people out there to love and explore, and we should join them.

2vzj65Kfaa	G7 is likely a chord leading to Cm (although that was probably altered to be a C7 - these are secondary dominants, and don't let them throw you off).<br>  <br>  If you are being asked to improvise do just that.<br>  <br>  Play the notes you want to hear, just have them with a tonal center of Bb.  <br>  <br>  There are no 'wrong' notes - only tension and release.  Sometimes the tension is cool.<br>  <br>  If you hit a 'wrong' note (whatever that means) - there is a 'right' one on either side - get to it.<br>  <br>  Or ... if you hit a 'wrong' note .... play it again!  Make it tense, make it purposeful, make it sing.<br>  <br>  Here are some scales that might help you, but often the scales become limiting rather than freeing:<br>  Bb major: Bb C D Eb F G A<br>  Bb blues: Bb Dd Eb Enat F Ab<br>  <br>  Mix and match these - you don't have to be stuck to just one.<br>  <br>  Play one note - let there be space.  Play a fast chromatic run.<br>  <br>  Play the notes.<br>  <br>  Play the spaces inbetween the notes.
VaG5ipxtaa	Only thing I can think of is compromise. In our band, the fusion of rock and blues (obviously more made for each other than your little conflict, but you get the idea) makes for a cooler and more functional sound. Try writing your more rock/pop lyrics and let him write his guitar part. Maybe you'll come out with a spacey guitar sound like Tool or Floyd mixed with edgy and mainstream lyrics of Guns and Roses. If that doesn't work, have a band meeting and figure out how you will proceed. Either he'll have to leave, you'll need to take turns writing, or just put up with each other. Either way, do what's best for the band not the individual.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|7gVtQsOMaa	just chill, ur guy sounds like Axl roses, kinda touchy and short tempered, just let him write some song and you write the other half and then combine them for the album or watever.<br>  its not your band, its the bands band|`|uV1kG4Vsaa	Kind of sounds like the band I'm in. I like psychedelic rock and our other main songwriter (our bassist) likes newer metal. The result: psychedelic metal. Well, kind of. Try combining the two genres.|`|6wiX4aJlaa	yes your band sucks.

XEaRdopnaa	Everyone who is answering this question is saying no.  Either they are hiding the truth or they only clicked on this question so they could proudly write "no" as if they've accomplished something really great in life.  So I don't think you're going to get an accurate representation of the widespread drug use that is taking place.  And I'm glad to see that the people who are doing the drugs aren't trying to boast that by answering this question and have some common sense.  Fun question though!|`|AA10175631	Wow.

0g4ZsFfiaa	i'm listening..<br>  i need to know how old u are though so i can be fair enough..<br>  add ur age and ill edit this with what i think after i finish listening :)<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  lol how cool is that just as i was asking for ur age u posted it..<br>  <br>  btw, i hope ur mom gets well soon.. spine fractures aint easy<br>  <br>  alright, here's what i think:<br>  1- first of all let me tell u that u have a real "sweet" voice.. there's something about it that is appealing and just soothing. notice im not talking about the "quality" but the "nature" of ur voice :) it's not a "common" voice and this is a PLUS for any singer.. it gives u ur own "personality" and makes ppl recognize ur songs instantly just as they start listening.. u get my point right?<br>  2- you have so much potential i can feel it. and i can sense that u are actually enjoying what u're doing.. and u DO sound confident too which is really another PLUS. why do i say this? because this means that u have a stable basis that u can build on and be confident that what u're building will be nothing less than GOOD!<br>  3- u do need voice coaching so that u can start to sound like a real professional and "fine tune" the notes here and there.<br>  4- if i were to rate, taking into consideration that u have not taken vocal lessons and u're 16: i'd give u a 7.8/10 and i honestly just feel that with some vocal tips ull instantly shoot to 9+<br>  <br>  a few tiny advices:<br>  - good general health is essential for a good healthy voice. and therefore u have to take good care of urself, sleep and eat well.<br>  - drink.. drink and drink lots of water. the throat is like a sponge.. it becomes happy when u give it water!<br>  - DO NOT overdo it ever and strain your vocal cords.. the key is to "sing smart"<br>  - practice and practice and practice all the time.... believe me practicing makes wonders!<br>  <br>  i wish u the best of luck.. and hey! when u become a star don't forget to dedicate something to me :p haha<br>  <br>  take care :)|`|bLg4b1MOaa	vocal lessons will help you.. your almost there!! good luck!! ;)|`|1be84c999921ba8f21866c621ab0353caa	You have a sweet tone of voice and you are young enough to educate it and mold it into whatever you want. Just remember the very basic principle of singing, when you open your mouth, let your soul escape through it!! Passion is the key, don't sing a song, perform it!. Best of luck.|`|n4IOpH2Baa	yep... i definately see a future for you in singing.<br>  some advice you probably already have got, LOUDER!<br>  a little vocal training and some confidence will go a very, very long way.<br>  when you go up high you tend to sing through your nose a bit, openening your mouth a little more should help a bit with that

aYNoQvfMaa	I don't really think you can compare two directors work. Individual films may be compared, but it's almost impossible to compare one director to another because everyone has a different view of the world.<br>  <br>  If you like Fassbinder then you'll probably like the others in the New German cinema movement (Wim Wenders, Werner Herzog, Schlondorff, Von Trotta, etc...), and from that you might check out Jim Jarmusch, and Claire Denis. From that you could check out Bela Tarr, Andrei Tarkovsky, Miklos Jansco, Peter Gother, etc... Some of their films are very easy to find, some aren't.<br>  <br>  I'm not a big fan of Almodovar, so, I don't know if I can help you with that, sorry.|`|AA11705909	Sadjit Ray, Akira Kurosawa, Andrzej Wadja, Wim Wenders, Bernardo Bertolucci, Agnes Varda, Andrei Tarkovsky, John Cassavetes & Jean Luc Godard.

AA10325228	Mom, she is more easy going , sympathetic,and understanding.  Plus I can tell her anything and she will listen.

Because she raised me, and was always there for me, after my Dad left us when I was 4.<br>  However, I do now have a good relationship with my Dad.

UTzERFbyaa	TODOS HAN RESPONDIDO PERO NINGUNO HA DICHO LO QUE HE DE DECIRTE.....<br>  Si te refieres a de donde salio??....segun dice el manga de Naruto (no esta muy claro)...fue invocado por Madara Uchija asi como el 1o Hokague invoco a la Rana gigante(primer episodio del anime) despues trasferida a Jiraya.....asi como Orochimaru tenia su serpiente y Tsunade su "Caracol" gigante..XD...he ahi el origen de el Kyuby en la aldea oculta de la hoja aparte de despues quedar encerrado en el cuerpo de naruto...:)<br>  <br>  Saludos...:)|`|7xTNSAAqaa	Origenes:En el altar oculto de dioses en Kobe|`|9YZBanThaa	Kyūbi (九尾 | 九尾の妖狐 , Kyūbi no Youko?, Zorro de Nueve Colas) es un personaje del anime y manga Naruto. Es un demonio que se encuentra dentro de Naruto Uzumaki. Más de una década antes atacó a la Aldea Oculta de Konoha, y fue sellado dentro de él por el Cuarto Hokage.<br>  <br>  Es el más poderoso de todos los Bijū. Ayuda a veces a Naruto cuando está en una situación difícil o necesita mucho chakra. Naturalmente esto es por puro egoísmo, dado que si el jinchūriki muere, él desaparecería a la vez. Aunque detesta a Yondaime por haberle sellado, le respeta, al igual que a Naruto.<br>  <br>  El Kyūbi acelera la curación de Naruto, y además le aporta cantidades enormes de chakra. Inicialmente sólo lo podía usar en situaciones de riesgo o de mucha exaltación, que suelen llevar a Naruto a un estado en el que no controla al zorro. En la segunda temporada, Jiraiya le ha ense?ado a servirse de Kyūbi, desencadenando parte de su poder. Esto se simboliza por el número de colas que aparecen en el chakra alrededor de Naruto. Indican también el grado de peligro, porque cuantas más se liberan, más difícil le resulta dominarlo, y puede permitirse que el zorro le domine por completo. Yamato realiza, en caso de descontrol, una técnica original de Shodaime por la cual puede mantener controlado a Kyūbi.<br>  <br>  La Organización Akatsuki persigue a Naruto desde que tuvo conocimiento de que él era el portador del Kyūbi.<br>  <br>  Al parecer, Kyūbi ve en los ojos de Sasuke Uchiha un poder y un chakra más terrible que el suyo, al igual que, como dice, vio en Madara Uchiha. Más adelante, en la pelea entre los hermanos Uchiha, se descubre que el Mangekyō Sharingan tiene la habilidad de tomar el control del Kyūbi. Tambíen se conoce que fue Madara el que bajo el control de su Mangekyō Sharingan mandó al zorro de nueve colas a atacar a la aldea de Konoha. Sin embargo, por razones que por ahora se desconocen Jiraiya ya hizo mención de que pudo ser Madara el que consiguió que el kyūbi atacara a la aldea, algo que por ahora no se entiende, pues se supone que el poder del Mangekyō Sharingan es un secreto entre el clan Uchiha.|`|WSfLFekcaa	estos tipos son unas bibliotecas de naruto!!!!! no tengo que responder...<br>  <br>  saludos|`|8LnFRLF0aa	el kyubbi es una de las 9 vestias sagradas <br>  en el pasado tenia un pactocon uchiha madara<br>   el creador del clan uchija que le daria  <br>  el poder cuando lo invocara su existencia no se <br>  save de donde vino hasta el momenta ni en el manga ni en el anime dis su existencia|`|HZ5FAwqtaa	es el zorro de nueve colas y lo invoco madara uchiha de donde no se|`|XKvlgSLSaa	el kyubbi viene de la serie naruto, es un zorro de nueve colas gigante que se encuentra sellado en el cuerpo del protagonista (naruto)|`|nLEXKBgyaa	Segun q kyubi si es el de naruto es un espiritu q vive dentro de el quien salvo a la villa de Kanoha;el 4 hokage lo sello dentro de Naruto.<br>  Suerte|`|u6q1Vy6Naa	Bue... ya te lo respondieron!!

Wait until you develop properly and<br>  2. Do some research. I knew a girl who did it and it was bloody hard work, she was dropped by her agency as soon as someone hotter came along. <br>  <br>  She told me she met Jordan once, and she said even if you're a hit the most you earn is around ￡15k a year. Jordan said she just got lucky. You gotta think about it long and hard, cause it's NOT easy.<br>  <br>  Plus, you're only around until the next new girl comes along. Guys get bored of the same girl quickly and the magazines drop you if you don't sell issues.|`|lJwdKrHAaa	I can't see where that is "bad"  -   finish your education, eat right, get enough sleep, exercise,   and the world is yours.  15 is not to young to start planning for your future,  but please continue to get a good education for what ever field you go into <br>  <br>          For that you will never be sorry.|`|wy9rgMGsaa	I am sure that most 15 year olds would be willing to do that, and I am sure that most parents of a 15 year old would not let their child do that...so I guess its normal you want to do this, but I'm sure your parents have more class then to let a 15 year old strip down|`|FN97fIc4aa	well im 20, so i can understand i guess.

weBvwrloaa	no, it was the angel of death. <br>  It has been said that no "man" can look into the arc of the covenant unless it was one of the high priest from the 12 tribes of Israel once it was sealed. It's supposed to be a holy relic containing things like  manna ( food sent from heaven) the original set of commandments that were broken by Moses when he came down from Mt. Sinai and saw the big old orgy going on in the camp, etc..so when the Nazi's opened the arc, they were killed by the angel of death for looking at something sacred and holy.|`|VYWaL2graa	There are stories of the arc killing people. They just made it dramatic for the movie.|`|erKyfwSbaa	The Bible also mentioned that only one tribe was allowed to transport the arc. and it had to be done in a special way.

First, you are going to need to get some local gigs (probably for tips only) and start building a fan base.<br>  <br>  Get a MySpace page and put up some of your music. Continue to book gigs, and promote yourself. After a few years. when you have built up a good fan base, start sending out the demos. You could also try to get into events like SXSW, where music producers hang out.<br>  <br>  Getting famous by singing is 90% hard work, and 10% luck.|`|VYvpDsDIaa	you have to be discovered by talent scouts. get a live gig .|`|AGXKPeZJaa	no nasty comments your doing this to be famous huh lmao|`|n4IOpH2Baa	someone already answered this correctly i think, u have to be found.<br>  make sure you have (if you really are good and can stick to it through the really hard stuff) a myspace account with some of your talent on it, any other similar websites where you can upload your music or whatever. find out if any local radio shows play local music and SEND IT OUT. make sure your friends/familly have heard you and get thier honest opinion, this will help your confidence if you are good. this is about all you can do short of stalking famous people haha|`|wWblBMKsaa	Make a DEMO CD of you singing songs by other artists. If you really want to pursue this you should go to record companies in LA or a city like that (if you wanna sing country go to Nashville) and present your CD to them. It's kinda unlikely that they'll consider you, but you never know! You have to start somewhere. It's hard when you don't have connections or anything. But you definitely need to make a demo for when you get an opportunity. Good Luck!|`|U4FUSfqPaa	you hit up Doctah Dre

rbVw9Zt8aa	im an alto, but that doesnt mean i only sing low, i have a wide range but my voice is the loudest when im lower. you may be a second soprano, everyone is different so i wouldnt try to classify yourself in any sort of category, if you have a vocal teacher or even a school choir director just stay a little while after class and ask her to help tell you. i believe you would be a second, because if you have a nice low voice, it would be a waste if you only sang high. good luck!|`|kuNCBosEaa	,jul

vKrWrhQeaa	i think that miley cyrus was smart enough to know what she was getting into when she joined disney channel. She knew that she had to be this cookie cutter image of the perfect teen, which she knows she also isn't. So it's her fault everyone's complaining. I do agree, she's a normal teen, but if she didn't want everyone criticizing her, she shouldn't have joined disney channel where she aparently became a role model for little girls. That's what disney channel does to you, and if you don't wait until you're older to do all that teen stuff, you're leaving disney channel with a bad reputation|`|fmxjWn4Daa	I'm not crazy about Miley Cyrus she just plain weird a Little too much

If there's someone named Miley Cyrus on Twitter it's probably a fake account and the person behind it is trying to impersonate her. Miley Cyrus is extremely busy these days. She has her book to promote, her music and her tv show. Miley loves her fans but if she did have a Twitter account a lot of fans would try to reach out to her. And she is just one person. She wouldn't be able to sit in front of the computer all day communicating with every single fan.|`|MNa3e8Mdaa	gag me

mzIgLo0vaa	Well, it's more about semantics and vocabulary than anything else. <br>  Techno is a term that was once more specific but today is more generic. Electronica, trance, eurodance, house and Hi-NRG....and most other types of dance music are often just lazily called "techno". Back in the old days...late 80s thru mid 90s...techno was more specific. But it has branched out.<br>  So, in brief, Techno can now be considered a generic term for electronic music. Of which, there are two subcategories: Electronica and Dance Music.<br>  <br>  I. Electronica is usually used for any electronic music that isn't a type of Dance Music. It uses synthesizers and all that...but actually is more influenced by rock than anything else. Artists include Crystal Method, Goldfrapp, Chemical Brothers.<br>  <br>  II. Dance Music often includes all the rest. Trance, House, Eurodance, Freestyle, Hi-NRG, Progressive, Drum & Bass, Electro-House, Club, Dance Pop, etc etc etc are all types of Dance Music.<br>  <br>  a. Trance is the form of dance music that's full of fast repeating melodies & harmonies with a very "electric" sound. Artists include: Tiesto, Armin Van Buuren, Filo & Peri, Paul Van Dyk, Kyau & Albert, Above & Beyond, ATB, George Acosta, Iio.<br>  <br>  b. House is the more "soulful" type of dance music. The melodies and harmonies are less complicated, and the beat is no where near as fast as trance. Artists include: Amuka, Barbara Tucker, Andy Caldwell, Deepface, Inaya Day, Freemasons, Georgie Porgie, Jason Walker, Joi Cardwell, Dennis Ferrer.<br>  <br>  c. Club & Dance Pop are the types of dance music that sound the most like pop/rock but has a dance beat. It's almost like mixing house and trance together. Artists include: Danielle Bollinger, Tony Moran, Amber, Dannii Minogue, Jacinta, Rachel Panay, Kristine W, Liquid 360, Lucas Prata, Mon A Q.<br>  <br>  d. Freestyle is a rare type of dance music, although it was bigger in the 80s and 90s. It is almost like mixing Latin music with house. The beats are usually slower than other types of dance music. Artists include Collage, Cynthia, Lisette Melendez, Rockell, Thiago Derucio, Malyssa..<br>  <br>  e. Eurodance and Hi-NRG are more pop-sounding, but very fast, dance music. It's like mixing trance with pop music. Artists include: DJ Encore, Ian Van Dahl, Sylver, Milk Inc, Kate Ryan, Jessy, Lasgo, September.

HRtqw6cbaa	Yes, thy are filming about half in Vancouver, and half in Italy but I am not sure about the exact location. As for the time, filming begins shortly after the Twilight DVD release(March 21), I think somewhere around March 23-25. For more info try online databases such a imdb.com, I am super stoked for New Moon! Hope this helps:)|`|kUuQhSb5aa	they r filming on march 23rd through ? after that they will film in volterra italy for two weeks! i just know that vancover is where they r filming. srry hope this helps! : D

PeuFnqQwaa	Probably have a neck twist or action problem. Strings are likely hitting frets farther down the neck when strumming. You likley need to have it setup and Truss rod adjusted. Take it to someone experienced at doing this, such as a luthier or a guitar tech at a music store and have them do the adjustments. It can be done yourself, but unless you knoe exactly what you are doing..especially with the truss rod, you can do some serious damage.

d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	Well, longer movies have more time for involved plots and storylines without rushing and leaving out important scenes that help to explain things. It's one of the reasons that extended editions of Lord of the Rings movies are better than the theatrical versions.<br>  <br>  But it doesn't always work out that way-  A.I: Artificial Intelligence was too long.<br>  <br>  I'd say the correlation probably comes from those longer films being based upon a richer/more detailed storyline to begin with.|`|B43x5RF8aa	I do not believe that to always be the case. Just because it is longer does not always make it better. Haven't you ever sat through a long movie and thought "man, is this EVER going to end?"

ABACQTi1aa	last year i was obsessed with it and watched it too much, so its alright now. hah|`|8342eb2791b4f481bc2b31b4c0d0dbccaa	I liked it, it was emotional and well done.  I normally don't go for that type of movie, but yeah, I liked it|`|BKybwvF5aa	I love that movie. I loved the story line. It is such a sad movie!|`|Efn4lj5vaa	mandy moores acting killed it, but other then that, i liked it.|`|gZ5m3o96aa	i really really like that movie it is really good. its one of my favorites definaly|`|Nw0cYY8Taa	one of my favorite movies, one of the cutest love stories<br>  it makes me cry everytime|`|T526fAIeaa	its very sad,<br>  overall its good.|`|OKmJWGGGaa	I love that movie. I was like 10 when I first saw it though and I've seen it probably 50'some times so i don't know if that's it but now, as an adult watching it, it seems a little juvenile, but, i still love the movie.<br>  <br>  The book is *SO* much better though!|`|LaC6nwpKaa	i reallly like it :D<br>  but the newer version is better.<br>  its called keith idk if you've heard<br>  of it or whatever but its my favorite :D<br>  you should definitly watch it if you havent<br>  <a href="http://www.watch-movies-links.net/movies/keith/" rel="nofollow">http://www.watch-movies-links.net/movies...</a><br>  !

She was trying waayyy too hard. Shane was great. Landon is the best!|`|U2U624i5aa	yeah i think its a really good movie but its so sad lol it made one of my guy friends cry HAHA but i love the movie|`|aCRpZz2Taa	i did until i realize how brainwashing these movies are.  men dont have to doall that to show they care.  what about the more subtle things?|`|fyMBLtQuaa	i love it.|`|SDdlNhXraa	i like the idea that someone can change for the better.<br>  it seems like it could happen, but in most cases it doesn't.<br>  <br>  i think the storyline is good. it's somewhat stereotypical: butthead meets girl, girl welcomes him with open arms, butthead changes into a sweet man. <br>  however, i particularly love that scene in the play and he kisses her after she sings. it gets to me every time.|`|bXF1gDTcaa	its one of my favorites. i watched transformers with my boyfriend and in return, he had to sit through a walk to remember with me. he cried more than i did, haha so funny. he told me, "we are never watching this again! i can't handle these emotions!"|`|Ff7lRKHiaa	yes the movie was a interesting movie that will make my heart sit at rest for eternity.

All of the words were exactly how I felt.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, Kelly Rowland's "Stole" might be a good one.

RaatBhvxaa	Yes,From Behind These Walls exsits. They have a myspace [I added them] and Ronnie checks his myspace periodically and it's official. It's his band. they even have a demo called "oh no you didnt" but he's still in jail since last time i checked. but the more letters he gets the more the judge belives hes worthy to be let out. If he were out,he would be recording his new music in Virginia already. And they kicked him out cause they couldn't go touring with Ronnie's probabtion and his problems with the law, and drugs. I know everything you need to know on this band [I did my research. I looked up the back to back myspace messages and all the interveiws and everything,so I know what I'm talking about]<br>  <br>  I even know what the tatoo on his neck is.

nHfJe8Yvaa	people tend to hate on whatever is popular. i've been guilty of it but i don't hate/like miley and the jonas brothers. the twilight books is another example. i forgot who but a famous writer said twilight is the worst book ever, but it's only because it's so popular. i highly doubt it's the worst book written out of all the books ever written. it's not like he would've said that if it never had the fame that it has now. i've never read it by the way.|`|MLp5nen1aa	Well see, one reason they hate these people is becuase they come from Disney. I mean they are old enough so that if they really had talent, they could actually do something.<br>  <br>  Everyone hates Miley Cyrus because she is a fake girl. She can't sing! I mean come on! Her voice is hoarse and she does all of those weird faces during her show that are just soooo anoying.<br>  <br>  The Jonas Brothers are just hated because little kids like them, so they aren't as COOL as other celebrities. I don't hate them but I don't think they have any talent either.|`|hwLYv4JFaa	Well I heard the jonas brothers live on the ellen show and they literally hurt my ears, thats why i dont like 'em.|`|k39bNUgeaa	Because the both suck<br>  They are talentless<br>  and both fake|`|ubk21UBvaa	i dislikle them mainly bc of their die-hard crazy fans who seem to think its okay to take nude pics and park in handicap parking spots(have you seen that yet?)<br>  <br>  miley is worse than jb by far. shes soo ungrateful and tries to act like a 21 year old. she seems to think she better than everyone.<br>  <br>  jb seem really nice. have you seen that vid of them singing to the cancer patient who was gonna die? i almost cried. haha<br>  and they are talented, but a bit of sell-outs. i used to love them when their first album was out. no one even knew who they were back then!<br>  <br>  i think its alright to like them for their music and t.v. shows, but some fans take it too far. "leave miley alone!" fans. <br>  and the fans that where underwear with them on it.<br>  haha|`|gSUU3Tk3aa	Miley- Little girls looked up to her then she had nude pics and people got disgusted.<br>  <br>  Jonas Bros.- Their fans are annoying.

ViEgekyIaa	Well the First Edition of Twilight signed by Stephanie Meyer is going for $787.77 as of now on Ebay (with 24 bids), so a film cast signature edition will make you loads more I'm guessing.|`|sMa56Y0Laa	Well, I've seen a lot of desperate Twilight groupies. I'd say you could probably sell it for $500 on ebay.|`|QT6iRQNaaa	You definetly want to check in the Price Check forum of RarityGuide.com<br>  <br>  Many autograph collectors hang out there and might be able to tell you how much your signed twilight book is worth|`|JCJVi8Qraa	If it  is a first printing of the first edition, 500-1000 dollars.

Here's how I see it being done.<br>  2 guys, 1 dressed preppy and the other sloppy. Both sing their own parts then sing the chorus together.<br>  Heck, if you want to go that far, you can have a couple of other people singing to a "Jocks" stanza, "Nerds" stanza, etc... Done right, you can bring all together, looking at all sides in just the one song.<br>  Another thing, if by chance you do some sort of video, the same person could dress for each "part" and sing it, bringing it all together for the chorus.<br>  <br>  I think you can actually go somewhere with this if you work at it. If this is what comes out when you get bored, I hope you get bored more often. Good luck!<br>  <br>   Peace to you and yours,<br>  Matthew "Dra'Gon" Stohler<br>  <br>  EDIT: P.S.

3c5f2316d7b180d5f45a6448d9b9def0aa	Malia, this term is used in a Stevie Wonder song ("Living for The City" -  very similar to your lyrics).<br>  Lyrics here:<br>  <a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/s/stevie+wonder/living+for+the+city_20131815.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lyricsfreak.com/s/stevie+wond...</a><br>  <br>  Stevie's song is a social commentary song.<br>  Telling of a young kid from Mississippi who moves to New York City. In Mississippi, he dealt with many hardships, but was surrounded by caring people. <br>  In New York City, he is quickly taken advantage of and is caught with drugs.<br>  His dreams are destroyed when he is sentenced to 10 years in jail.<br>  <br>  I always thought it meant city living was a constant struggle and (for some) they were managing to get by just enough for city living.
2FIbamFgaa	Get the first one.  Packages are never a good idea.<br>  <br>  Ever.|`|PeuFnqQwaa	For learning, either one will do. The GRG probably has better components, bridge,pickups, tuning pegs. Check the reviews that others have written on the site. They are generally pretty accurate. Other than that it comes down to personal preferrence, and playability. You have to decide that yourself. Go to a local music store and play one if you can so you get an idea of what it feels and plays like. Package deals tend to be on the cheap side and you do get what you pay for. If I had to pick from the 2, I'd take the Grg170dx.

NkFxlEPqaa	Honestly! That was a serious piece of homegrown music! <br>  I really liked what the overall mood in the piece was. I kept getting visions of Jack Johnson, etc. The rhythm guitar at the beginning was perfect to set the tone, the xylophone-style accents really pushed up the catchiness a notch as well. I did like the vocals, and I'm not sure exactly where you guys are from. At first the lead singer sounded American, then I caught this faint attempt at an English accent which threw me off. As well, the chorus had some nice harmony and I did catch a changeup in the rhythm guitar as well, which did sound a little out of place when first heard. I wonder if you can either make the changeup on the strumming differently so it's introducing properly? Also, the mic positioning for the vocals need a little fine-tuning. Perhaps they are too upfront and need to mixed back a little further. In a way they do sound 'right' where they are, but in some ways they do overpower the entire piece. I liked the little guitar interlude 3/4 way through-nice touch because it was kept simple and short. I did find myself repeating the song in my head after hearing it so it does have some outstanding quality! Do you have any alternate versions to listen to?|`|97eFBAS7aa	I thought it was good I would listen too it more than once song is kinda slow though

lDcCn69haa	ch131.com if not ill will came back and change my answer!!|`|IgNADy1Taa	The creator Ilene Chaiken made it clear this would be the last season and said there are plans for a spin-off entitled The Farm starring Alice in a woman's prison. As far as I know they are still waiting to see if it will be picked up by Showtime. Apparently Famke Janssen will make an appearance...this spin-off will be the only sort-of continuation of the L Word characters. Since Betta and Tina are moving to New York, and main character Jenny is dead, there is closure surrounding the 3 who the series centred around at the very beginning. <br>  <br>  I'm conflicted as to how Jenny died! She became very self-absorbed throughout the seasons and has always had mental problems so it is not unlikely that she committed suicide, although I don't think she would have done this at that particular moment in time at TiBette's goodbye party, especially since Kit was backing her up with the Kelly-Bette video, and Jenny hadn't found out yet that Shane found the letter (I think). The fact that most of the main characters said "I'm so going to kill Jenny" at some point during the season might be a hint from the writers that she was murdered. It seems likely that Alice might have done it, since she is the only one who mentions that Jenny might have been "killed" during her interrogation and also ends up in a prison in the spin-off! However, she is also shown explaining to Shane that she has forgiven Jenny (unless she did that as a cover-up) and also I can't imagine anyone would think pushing someone into a pool is an effective way to kill them. Perhaps someone lost their temper with her (Bette? Since she was last seen talking to her on the unstable balcony) and pushed her without intending her to drown. Bette certainly had a good reason, since Jenny had information which would have torn apart her whole family. <br>  <br>  I think it was an accident in any case, but the fact that everyone had a motive to kill her implies they all sort of contributed to her breakdown and death by turning on her so viciously and I'm sure they will all be left feeeling guilty about it.

lk6I2TcXaa	I have a friend who is a really good drummer and she makes money as a "stand in" drummer in studio. This pretty much means that if a band that is recording in that studio has a drummer that is sub-par, she plays for the recording. She makes quite a lot of money off of it and you won't have to worry about putting together a band and finding gigs and such. But keep in mind, you have to be extremely good. I play guitar and I am not in a band or anything, I find it best just to help me relax and clear my head, just as any instrument you are passionate about would. Therefore, if you believe you will stick with it, then go for it, you don't have to be in a band or anything, you can just play to play.|`|G1glDc5Iaa	Go for it take lessons and when u get good enough (I mean like great) go and post flyers|`|OrAk4Fpoaa	Yes, because of:<br>  1.

You′ll appreciate more music because you′ll know how hard it is to produce it...<br>  4. Its great to play an instrument, you can meet new people, do something besides sleep, eat and listen to music, and making music is GREAT<br>  <br>  oh and I almost forget it:<br>  5. You can chose mine as best answer because of the 4 reasons already listed....|`|8yohIQH1aa	YAH.<br>  i play and it is fun to just jam to music and people will know you do, so even if you don't want ot be in a band (im not partial to it either) no one's stoppin you from playin yourself.<br>  you can also help bands like find beats and haha you can show up people that have no rythm so go for it.|`|Rnp9QSJDaa	If you like the drums then you should learn how to play them.

9iElNpSSaa	The order in which you have listed the scales is called the circle of fifths (or sometimes the circle of fourths or cycle of fifths).  There is no real universal concert order to playing scales, and in all of my years of preparing students for auditions, it has never been required that they go through all of their scales in the order of the circle of fifths.  It is a very good skill to be able to play your scales in that order, though.  It keeps your mind alert.<br>  If you are concerned about a specific audition, consult whoever is in charge of that audition and simply ask what is required in terms of scales.  Typically, they will require you to be able to play up to 3 or 4 sharps and flats, or all major scales, and they will choose a few of those scales randomly for you to play in the audition.  It’s rare that they will ask you to play every major scale.  I hope that helps.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
nMWtEmEFaa	I would suggest just reading from the beginning of the timeskip in the manga. Considering there are a lot of fillers in the anime, and it also changes some facts, it would just be easier to start reading from the beginning. Episode 99 is clearly another filler (I don't watch the anime because of the fillers, but I just saw 99 real fast to confirm).<br>  <br>  The timeskip is in Chapter 245, so you can read from there.<br>  <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/245/01/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/245/01/</a> Read Chapter 245<br>  <br>  If you don't want to read that much, then you can try reading from the first time they brought fillers in the shippuden anime, which is also when Naruto does his elemental training (seeing as a filler started right after he started training).<br>  <br>  Start with Chapter 312 to avoid anime fillers.<br>  <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/312/01/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/312/01/</a> Read Chapter 312|`|SMM9dziSaa	Shippuden episode 99 and 100 are not in the manga.

2dQBQE39aa	I had this same problem when I didn't know about cps2 game emulation. To get marvel vs. capcom to work, you need to download the parent rom (significantly biggest file) and then download one of the lesser roms of the same name (I prefere the usa version because it is in English.) Put the biggest rom and the smaller rom in the same folder, and then the game should work.

Dyvv4ZFaaa	I reckon it's because in the past hardly anyone was super-fat and everyone was trying to survive when food was more scarce, and our bodies needed all the fat we could get  so the fatty foods were the best thing to eat - so our bodies adapted to make us enjoy the fatty foods more, as a way to make us consume what we needed. Kind of like the way we're programmed to enjoy sex to make sure the species reproduce.<br>  <br>  this is all just my theory though it's probably wrongg|`|6ee5733fcb0000219e21e56903ec83e1aa	because of the fats..!|`|8a38d403f4c3ed15eb45f626449b69ecaa	Because a lot of fattening foods contain a high content of sugar, and we all know how delicious sugar is!|`|POFdWpUzaa	Fat in food makes it taste better. Compare NF milk to 1% or 2%. However, the one thing I like low-fat is peanut butter.

y8WBcehmaa	I always liked anything to do with the Titanic, I was obsessed when I was little reading fictional books based in it, reading non fiction books about the ship, I had board games, puzzles, etc. So naturally, I would be drawn to the movie. I think it has a great storyline. The effects were incredible at the time the film was released. I think Kate and Leo have amazing chemistry together (still do, see rev road). It's just an overall great film.|`|2g8m8USQaa	I didn't exactly love the movie but when I finally did see it, I did enjoy it. I didn't want to see it for a long time because I didn't see how a legend could be turned into a love story. I have to admit though...I was impressed.<br>  <br>  I can't vouch for the accuracy of the movie but it seemed pretty close to me. <br>  <br>  EMT<br>  <br>  I remember watching a show about the Titanic on the Discovery Channel, I think it was...it was interesting because it went through difference scenarios and one was if the Titanic had rammed the ice berg head on, damage would have limited to the first few compartments (in theory) and the ship might have stayed afloat longer to allow more time for help to arrive. We will never know though. All scientists can do is theorize endlessly and wonder "what if".|`|B8Gwxo1laa	The movie was very well made, incredible special effects. <br>  Old Rose chucking The Heart of the Ocean at the end---one of the stupidest moments in film history.<br>  Sorry, just my opinion.|`|d55D0Ci4aa	I think every time I watch it I am hoping that the movie has miraculously changed and there will be a happy ever after for Jack and Rose, and for the people on the ship. I love that Rose sees beyond the classes and finds true love, that she would give up everything for the man she loves.  Everything about the movie is amazing, the acting, the sets, the dialog, and you have to wonder what Rose's life would have been like if Jack had survived with her!!!!|`|zbuStsqCaa	I've always loved it. I was watching it today actually and my parent's told me when i was about 4-5(when the movie came out)<br>  I'd ask for them to put the tape in so I could watch it, everyday to every other day. And they never understood why :)|`|Vj9NicUsaa	because its realli romantic & adoralbleee|`|VNJglNLsaa	I enjoy this movie because even though after as many times as I've seen it I still amazed on how the movie was filmed and the way that Kate and Leo acted. I'm never disappointed watching it, even though I know most of lines. :] At the end, I still have the feeling Leo's character will come alive and be with Kate's character. It's simply an amazing film.

AA11111233	I'll take you on a trip around the world. :D|`|RfPDOPEwaa	none, id put a down payment on a car lol|`|k0dZeYQ6aa	i would give you nothing and i would put in the bank...kinda saving up for a car (less than 21 mos until my license, 15 mos until permit!)|`|4c5726b963122e60694b7e3e59161e71aa	I would pay for your face lift and pocket ther rest.|`|pKrsOPOkaa	a new computer ! (:|`|E5rhAaLGaa	Chocolate teddy :)<br>  And if u gave me best answer, a big one ;)|`|OKLBCesVaa	That swan outfit that Bjork singer worn.|`|AtazHOpjaa	yes
1wNsBNmxaa	i would not eat any part of my body because then you would be screwed because you are bleeding to death i would use my hands like a paddle if i could see land in then rest in then go look for food<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Deathtrap ???|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	Realistically speaking, eating your foot would only result in an even more painful death, but assuming that I can safely eat my foot to survive, then sure, I'd do it.|`|EmgiGg17aa	So, I would bait the hook(with a Twinkie-that is not food) and use the fishing gear the raft has or drop in a depth charge and see what floats to the surface and put that on the Bar-B or phone for delivery.    My raft came fully equipped.<br>  <br>  Loozer!|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	could I have toe jam with that?|`|RVWyPicKaa	I would die anyway...... I would be losing large amounts of blood...... so I think I would rather sit there and die as a whole and so people can find me as a whole...... or would you rather they found you with one less foot..... why should you care anyway.... I mean... you would be dead.|`|FNwxcBPpaa	No because I would bleed to death.|`|7MsozqOdaa	no, i think i would rather jump off and drown.|`|wgCINuZvaa	Well, I think it would be stupid to eat ur own body parts because you would probably get a major infection and just decline ur health even faster...like, it would hurt big time and idk- why put urself through more suffering?!? I would prolly resort to drinking urine BLAH!!!!|`|AA11938631	ok , if it really gets down to it , first drink your pee, then eat your.....well you know. yeah other animals do it to survive. I can hear the collective" EWWWWW GROSS"|`|nXSpS3Axaa	I'd die from heat exposure and dehydration before I'd start contemplating the thought of eating myself..|`|4YnoykD2aa	No. I'd hope for something heavy enough to drag me to the bottom of the ocean.|`|816d0234ce66aef35ce88055d2729beeaa	The ocean is full of food although raw, but better than a foot ! Of course, assuming one is not eaten first :o|`|UKPYoPKuaa	No I can stand hunger for a long time but not thirst so I might bite myself to drink my blood.|`|ENkFZhlraa	Sure why not?|`|MQ2GL5jhaa	food?  i'd worry more about thirst since u need that more than water.  My nails would b kinda long and i would bite them to sharpen the edges and i would try and fillet my arm a tad.  Just enough to get some meat but not enough to expose the bone.  I would use then the water i collected after gettin rid of the salt using the sun to help slow the process of infection from the womb.  The ocean may b dead but doesnt mean whats in the air is.  Birds are scavengers so i would make myself a decoy lettin some of my blood cover me so that it can atrack a bird to land on the raft then i pounce on it.  W00t w00t! i got me some food.  lol corny idea but hey u nvr know it may work...just hope i dont find out if i ever go boating :)|`|8zwL5YwFaa	Could I Cook My Foot?|`|NEWbh3Plaa	If I was positive I was going to die...yes I would start with my toes and work my way up my foot if I had to.  The only problem here is blood loss.  If I had no supplies in which to cut my toe off, I don't know that I could actually bite it off.  Im not sure...something to think about though!|`|7d1c1d5b5cec7935d2bc4c2d09927c78aa	well if i was good at yoga i could eat my foot.... so as i can't get my leg above my waist i'd start on my hands and hope help turned up before i got to the shoulders|`|vmauRjsIaa	i wouldnt eat my foot!<br>  eating food just makes you thirst more, unless ur eating ice.<br>  haha.<br>  i wouldnt eat any part of me.<br>  i'd swim until i found land.<br>  and if i saw a ship, i would swim to it.<br>  =]|`|oS70aHHgaa	i most likely would die - foot or no foot ?<br>  <br>  besides - with no supplies how would I cut off the foot anyway ?|`|KqiiT1WSaa	HAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAaa<br>  <br>  TRUST YOU TO COME OUT WITH THIS QUESTION !!<br>  <br>  EWWWWWWWW, no i don't think i could do that. maybe i would die from disease or athleats foot HAHAHA|`|i9W6Bpnbaa	lolz! XD<br>  random questsion, but no I wouldn't I would probably eat the raft and sink!|`|IHWngaDxaa	I would eat my raft before I would eat my foot!|`|k8MIQSOvaa	No I would rather wait until I started hallucinating like crazy and then kill over|`|3bsIGHE4aa	Wouldn't you bleed to death if you tried to eat your foot? So either way...|`|mNLV4iiJaa	no because i might blead to death or get an infection.<br>  i would rather die of starvation and thirstyness|`|FLaij4W7aa	i'd wait 2 days and if no one came i'd kill myself...sad to hear, but i wouldnt eat my foot =P|`|SjLDdUh7aa	No, I would rather starve to death.|`|dgGtwSIzaa	No , I would rather die of hunger ! .|`|UdVCjylwaa	no thanks they stink|`|qYe02dY7aa	i would fish. with my bare hands|`|qHjOs83Maa	Pray to either land in a friendly civilized place, or at the very least an island with fresh water (I can always go fishing in the raft). If that doesn't work, I'll roll over and die. The blood in my feet would probably kill my poor, dehydrated self quicker than if I just lay down and waited for the Coast Guard to find me.|`|vUZeNPbxaa	is that even possible?|`|JUxQY7rbaa	Foot for food, no, thank you. I got smelly foot.|`|9lynZDFxaa	um.....<br>  i would...<br>  But will it grow back??<br>  LMAO<br>  <br>  And how am i suppose to chop it off? <br>  :D
aZtPJSLFaa	nothing but staying home unless if something comes up|`|wgCINuZvaa	DAVID COOK CONCERT (haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)|`|e5a107c322fde4a2e467d59a3abfe0dfaa	not working...yay :-)<br>  <br>  so I'm gonna go for lunch with an old friend, go out sat night & sleep all day sunday...that's the plan anyway :D|`|8w2o6qHyaa	Going to Vermont for the weekend.|`|pR4Hwmpbaa	I start my vacation on Saturday morning! <br>  <br>  <br>  All I know for sure is that I won't be going to work...|`|WtTUNC8Naa	On friday, i am spending the night with my boyfriend.On saturday my son's godmother and i are going to take my son to the petting zoo, and then my boyfriend is going to come to dinner with my son and i, and we're going to watch some movies once my son goes to bed.<br>  Then sunday morning, im going to get up and cook everyone breakfast :-)|`|D6BRPzr7aa	looked at the sky and count how many figures sheep can i see....|`|2624d3bf8e4e63e26e8d8d37caca1505aa	same as last weekend nothing
9CHjZ8sBaa	No, why would i? Its a life separated from real life.|`|nDzenpkwaa	Hell Yes,<br>  <br>  I love the limelight (Great song by Rush).  I would be an actor if I could be any celebrity.|`|BswVoF8Paa	yes, i like acting and singing and i need the money|`|mJmG3i4Oaa	No.<br>  <br>  I can't/couldn't handle the ATTENTION.!|`|AA12050428	No way!  I like to use my brain and not have bits added to my body. I am perfect as I am.|`|nwYZWwDHaa	nope... too much stress! i mean.. yea... the fame, money, everything is great... but i'm not the type of person who would be running around. You wouldn't have as much time for family as a regular family... you would always care about reaching a higher goal in your career... no time for the everyday things of life... its very stressful and hectic... no thanks... :)|`|t8JhViXPaa	Only if i was a celeb for actually doing something worthwhile, not just partying and flashing my naughty bits when i get out of a car.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I can't think of anything worse, unless it is being a member of the Royal Family.  I like my anonymity and privacy too much.|`|MbdwNsYwaa	perhaps, it would be easier to meat other celebrities that I really like!!!! : )|`|XPaLYdobaa	if it meant getting paid the extortionate money they get then yes|`|Qih2hKqkaa	I am!|`|IM6UsVC2aa	nah<br>  i dont want all that attention|`|1tlgYKROaa	no i like my privacy|`|0MmsMTP0aa	Yeah for the money <br>  but no for the papazazzi :)|`|r2ScQP2vaa	No. because the paparazzi would catch me <br>  smoking weed, then i wouldn't be a good <br>  role model =D|`|uJrHmAKDaa	HELL NO<br>  <br>  just give me the money<br>  fame is a CURSE and overrated|`|yDnBqGheaa	i want the money, but not the spotlight|`|bznQW3QYaa	Yea why not?<br>  Not all celeb have to show them self,naked
EZpT0Pu4aa	hmmm, Robin.<br>  <br>  He's got a bum rap every time you see him. <br>  <br>  Lets face it the Robin we all know and love is angst ridden, Dick Grayson, but then you get all these random Robins in between, all with pretty much the same sob story, it does get old. <br>  <br>  Batman is always stoic and scary; almost to the point where if you spent most of your childhood watching him then you'd be a pretty depressed person by the end of it. robin was put in there to humanize Batman and place the few needed extra tender moments, Bruce never could be in love but Robin could. <br>  <br>  That being said, I like Robin in the animated series and Teen Titans, but the movie version was to angry, even for Dick.|`|6pMI1aAJaa	bOTH ARE FINE WITH ME|`|ueKeUZ6oaa	Batman is the man, but so is Dick Grayson.|`|MQNVHdu9aa	They are lovers.|`|i35QcjNhaa	I Like Robin but I Prefer Batman being by himself
kP0JGI1waa	I personally am a fan of shredding, I mean there is always a part of me craving a million notes per second, thus I listen to a good amount of tech death, etc.  I agree with you on pretty much all the ones listed, they all have examples of slower guitar playing, its just that people often only see a few instructional vids on youtube and then form an opinion.  Plus, who ever said that emotion means playing slow?  Just because something is fast doesn't mean it is completely sterile.  I mean Jason Becker's Serrana is really fast but I think it is one of the most beautiful and emotional pieces of guitarwork.|`|adLSRFrZaa	I like guitarists that can do it all - from emotional playing to technical brilliance.  I like versatility. <br>  <br>  I'll check out the "Electric Tears (2002)" album.|`|KGG783Seaa	Herman Li-Dragonforce<br>  My guitar buds know the truth, but peeple with no knowledge think he is amazing. He can't improv for **** i bet.<br>  <br>  Mick Thomson-Slipknot<br>  Its tough to dis my favorite guitar player. I think everything he does has feeling and he pours his heart into it. However, his solo(wat little amount he has) are just shredding and they are good, but not anything knew. I love Mick down to his stage performance, but his solos aren't his strong point.<br>  <br>  Alexi Laiho-Children of Bodom<br>  Sure he's the "fastest guitar player in the world" and he writes great songs but sometimes he gets cocky and only shoots for speed. But i mean he is fukking great and i love all his solos no matter how empty.<br>  <br>  Thats all for now.|`|uUDNcsyUaa	I completely agree with you on Malmsteen, Cooley, and Batio...they are the ones that first came to mind for me when I read this ?<br>  <br>  I would have to somewhat disagree w/Petrucci...although a large portion of his playing is super fast technical stuff he has plenty of slower melodic stuff, especially his stuff outside of Dream Theater<br>  <br>  I guess if I had to throw another name in the ring I would say...the 100's of mind-numbing shredders you find all over YouTube...here is one example:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THXCi3H3NzM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THXCi3H3N...</a>|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	You missed Alvin Lee.<br>  The term refers to macho demonstrations of technical ability at the expense of musicality.<br>  A good example of musicality can be found in the classic B.B. King fill:  Often slow, seldom more than a couple of bars, but perfect.
c5a50631f90f4ba04d88c923dc2aa963aa	cauliflower.....  more like  ninja broccoli....|`|9DjMGv5Uaa	okra, durian, lima beans, and leeks|`|DS21ekeJaa	Zucchini- they have those little spiky thingys on their skin- a steroidal zucchini could be lethal!|`|444cc0a50021891de69824c19550f54daa	tomatoes<br>  ain't nothing more dangerous than a rogue tomato|`|hz7Ek1HKaa	spinach..

They tend to get caught in your upper plate.  =(|`|votsoxeGaa	I don't think Toledo would like that. =(|`|1AdzD6bmaa	I love the Asiago Roast Beast sandwich at Panera's.  (and one time ordered it like that..."Roast BEAST"....because I'm so used to joking around calling it by that name that I forgot myself.  The cleark got a little chuckle out of it).  No...I don't eat the scales.  Without the scales, there are no calories.  Make sure you ask the cleark to trim the scales off for you.   (She WILL understand).|`|7fbcRjdCaa	If the woman failed to take them off for you, be nice and eat them.  Then in private slap shitz out of her for not scaling your beast!<br>  <br>  giggels|`|DS21ekeJaa	I prefer no scales, but hear they are good for "roughage"!
kLlA2JTjaa	Maybe in Uganda..|`|VvX51zueaa	Probably not. The last time I saw them was in Woolworths about 5 years ago. You don't even see many of the old style colour tv's these days, so I'd be amazed to see a black & white set, outside of a museum.|`|7ciw1aCXaa	You can still get small B&Ws from many places. Especially for use in CCTV installations. Maplin, maybe?|`|7WlHyq8Taa	I don't think you can buy new ones anymore...<br>  <br>  I tried to get one for an old lady years ago. She couldn't afford a colour TV licence but I never managed to find one for her....|`|GKEDoCFTaa	I have a black and white portable which will last me for the remainder of my days|`|2sxV424aaa	not in any major department stores, you could try yard sales or thrift stores maybe.|`|6eab4b3bcfe099adea6e536cf375ba45aa	In a Black and White store|`|hkUzSsRZaa	I know!!!!

Rzp30xIQaa	im the 2nd youngest of 4 kids and yes im wild...my oldest brother is real mean and cold as ice, the next oldest a school dropout but not wild, than me(taking after a kid in our nighboorhood who benn arrested 18 times, he does everything, fight, get drunk, you name it), than my little brother, the smart one.<br>  <br>  I am not so smart: 17 in 9th grade...i just go to skool for kicks, but im like this becuase i live in a bad side of town<br>  <br>  the kid i was talking about b-fore in my best friend and his name is dallas|`|Nipbluclaa	I am the wild one,<br>  More so anчwaч,<br>  No im the wilder one :D<br>  Alwaчs riskng mч life bч using a spoon as a knife :]<br>  <br>  I dont look like anчone,<br>  I prefer that :D|`|BjmJharpaa	ya I am<br>  I look like my dad|`|0M6DSPQPaa	It's a tough call.  I'm not that wild, but compared to most of my family, I'm probably the more daring, impulsive type.  Then again, my younger brother is a bit crazy and he definitely gives my parents the most trouble of us three kids.  I guess it depends on what you would consider wild.  I've been told that I look like my parents....I don't see the resemblance....lol|`|4YnoykD2aa	I'm the youngest of 3 girls, and I am the wild one.<br>  I look like everybody in my family.|`|NDFN04sqaa	I am the wild one, and always will be!  It's my trademark.<br>  <br>  And yes i look similar to both of my sisters - but we all have different body types - and i look quite a bit like my mom.
2XQstX3xaa	I think everyone would go into a survive or die mentality and we'd all see what the basic human emotion is. It's survival of the fittest and every man for himself. The true colors of the whole world would come out and we'd all see the ugly truth. I think I'd be pretty fine without money. I've been poor almost all my life so I'd find a way to live.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	It would be cool, then everyone would truly be equal.  And everyone would have to work together and help each other.

3cae1a173ced8370d2a6d3af83b9b006aa	Ain't nothing better than 'Football Fight' from Queen's soundtrack to 'Flash Gordon'.<br>  But I'm a fan of Brian May's soundtrack efforts and he really shined with the stracks to 'Mad Max' & 'Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior'...

Ubb4RiXLaa	I'm excited to hear you'll be trying out, and I will be rooting for you all the way. I would suggest going with songs, exactly like you said, that are similar to your voice, hence bring out the best of your talent. From what I've seen on past season, the ones who go home are the ones who outdo themselves trying to hit odd notes and extra-difficult numbers. A good resonating song that lets your passion for music and personality shine through will get you noticed. You will know songs that you can bellow from your heart and soul, friends who have heard your voice will also be of help..will let you know if I think of a particular track. You go girl! Rock on!!|`|95f7247eb624aa87ba4619aeec8608ccaa	Hmm. We would have to know what you voice is like?  <br>  <br>  I really love the song Climb by miley cyrus.<br>  <br>  I think you should sing Love will find a way by christina Agulera! Good luck.

QnoysJJaaa	There is truth in the time-honored adage that “An apple a day keeps thedoctor away.”<br>  <br>  Want to receive the benefits of about 4 grams of fiber in just 80 calories?<br>  Enjoy a crunchy, medium-size apple WITH ITS PEEL ON. By eating just one apple you will have reached 15% of the minimum amount of fiber advised daily for adults. Also, the soluble fiber of the apple may help lower blood cholesterol levels and help waste move through the intestinal tract faster.<br>  <br>  A powerful antioxidant, quercetin, is found in apples---especially the peel.<br>  <br>  Quercetin may reduce the growth and spread of cancer cells and<br>  protect your blood vessels from fatty deposits.<br>  <br>  Feeling nervous or stressed? Aroma and flavor of an apple mostly come from fragrance cells in the peel. The scent of an apple is one that makes people feel less anxious, especially when mixed with cinnamon and clove. Also, just underneath the skin of the apple is vitamin C.<br>  <br>  Hey...you asked!|`|RqqAzFFEaa	Yay . I have my apple in a pill form though.|`|fcku4bGjaa	yup|`|AA11596713	i'm going to be a doc soon.. so stop eating those apples!|`|jUEoujN2aa	yay! but i need to start eating them|`|QEqGukjZaa	YAY..apples attract the nurses tho=)|`|b4twAWp7aa	And an onion a day will keep everybody away|`|ozmqdlEbaa	Yay!! :)<br>  <br>  or Huzzah!|`|jpH4IjWnaa	Yay! :)|`|KPSevkIdaa	Yay!<br>  not that it's true...<br>  <br>  apples are yummy1!

But its more of the have a baby now or you can't when your older.|`|bbUYbEGUaa	I wouldn't be a teen mom because then you, yourself, would miss out on allot in the future. You can miss out on college too. If you have a baby then you might not be able to go to college. An the risks of AIDS and other disease increases if you have sex before you get married. And being a teen mom can also mean being a single teen mom. They might say they will be there for you and the baby until when you need them most and they wont be there.
g3IXprk9aa	I think the movie IT really killed it for Clowns, haha.|`|4AavBJy8aa	yes :(|`|JITTMjasaa	Clowns have been associated with a lot of negative things in movies and life. It has something to do with the old "wolf in sheep's clothing" idea. They look silly and harmless but they are tricksters and often act out of the ordinary. As a child the unexpected can often be intimidating. The movie "It" really creeped a lot of people out. Including me. John Wayne Gacy, the famous serial killer dressed up as a clown and went to children's hospitals to try to cheer up the sick kids (to make himself look better). He also painted many clown pictures and many were sold. Here's a good link <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/John_Wayne_Gacy" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/John_Wayne_Gacy</a>   No wonder so many people are afraid of clowns.<br>  <br>  Personally, as a child I was wary of them because one day I was walking with my mother and some jerk dressed up as a clown sprayed me in the face. We were just crossing the street not trying to acknowledge him. A couple years later a nice lady dressed as a clown gave me a balloon and a stick on tattoo and demolisheded my distrust in clowns as a whole. Then when I got older I did a report on John Wayne Gacy and my grandmotherer told me about my great uncle. He was the last known victim of Gacy. Nice. So my overall outlook on clowns is not very good.|`|eb1eB1hCaa	Well I do have to say, after seeing that epic fail of a movie "It", that just made clowns look really...non imaginitive. they aren't that scary. just like regenerators in resident evil. they aren't scary, yet thousands of people find them extremely terrifying.|`|IqoRBVUTaa	Those things flippin' freak me out man!! My brother once dressed up like a clown and pounced on me in my sleep, I screamed so loud the neighbors hat were walking down the street heard it and called the police!!

XQMm3Ahraa	any type of yaoi, yuri, eechi, and hentai<br>  <br>  and the only thing I dislike about anime is that sometimes the voice actors of both the japanese and english suck|`|gzxjcVURaa	How about when anime gets dubbed they change what the characters say so it makes sense here in America. Let me explain this one...<br>  <br>  When Anime gets dubbed the studios that do it will often times change what the charaters are talking about or even change the conversation so Americans can get some sense out of it. Ordinarily it's usually things that only people in Japan would understand but sometimes it's other things. Something as simple as a character's name (Lunch became Launch. Mr Satan becomes Hurcule) or a character's outfit will change (HELL becomes HIFL) or even when characters die things are messed with so Americans won't complain. I hate it when we have to screw with the way the Japaness wanted their stories to be told.|`|AA10968947	I agree!!!! Say no to yaoi, yuri, and hentai!!!!!<br>  chyeah~!!!!!<br>  <br>  but then again, some people like them..so no..<br>  I guess yaoi/yuri/hentai fans should just stop forcing it to the other people who doesn't like it. I mean, e are all entitled to our opinions, right? :]<br>  <br>  <br>  Dubs..many people prefer dubs more than subs, and we gotta respect that.

That generally ruins a lot of english dubbed animes for me]<br>  <br>  extreme mushy scenes [cut it in half and you still have enough love to go around]<br>  <br>  scenes where characters spend too much time talking to their enemies before a battle; sometimes we don't need an explaination for everything.|`|wdJS5MuUaa	Bad subbing!|`|SB4N01OOaa	Bad dubs! And filler arcs.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	If you're against yaoi or yuri, you're going against gays and lesbians, and you're not respecting their community and their way of love.<br>  <br>  Well, there's none that anime can do without.<br>  <br>  Do we need comedy?<br>  <br>  -yes<br>  <br>  Do we need action as well as romance?<br>  <br>  -yes<br>  <br>  Do we need fantasy and sci-fi?<br>  <br>  -yes<br>  <br>  Do we need subs as well as dubs?<br>  <br>  -yes<br>  <br>  There's always something that complete's anime. <br>  <br>  Of course, we all have our likes and dislikes. Just because we dislike something anime related, it doesn't mean that we should go against fans that like those kind of attributes of anime.<br>  <br>  You say yaoi and yuri needs to go. But, what about the fans? Don't you think that the fans would like to have their favorite genres?<br>  <br>  You shouldn't take something. It'll cause a rouse. <br>  <br>  You might also lose fandom for anime as well. <br>  <br>  If we subtract some of the genres, like comedy and fantasy, it'll make anime dull. It would be just slice of life, drama, romance, and action.<br>  <br>  How about we take action away? And, what are you left with? The answer is anime that you wouldn't enjoy. You might go back to watching action movie flicks like Marvel and DC.<br>  <br>  So, as for my final answer, there's nothing I would want to get rid of even though I hate a few things.

AA11885973	I'm in my third year in Miami and we are given free flu shots at the hospital I work at.  I missed the first go round because I didn't start until after Christmas, 2006.  I got the flu shot in 2007 at the start of flu season and got the flu in February.  I didn't get a flu shot last time and I'm still healthy.|`|VBdXray0aa	I used to get very sick every year.  The flu shot really didn't make much difference with me.  Then I started taking a Korean White Ginseng every day and every year, everyone gets sick but me.<br>  The ginseng builds the immunity system.  It works!<br>  But, rats! It doesn't do a thing to help allergies.|`|votsoxeGaa	As a heathcare professional it is strongly suggested that we get the flu shot.  Every other year I got one and got sick anyway.  This year no flu shot and I have remained flu-free!!*|`|xWqKKp0Naa	Hey JB .             I get them every year & it really has helped me on certain strains going around . the flu shot can not get every single bug & inevitably i come down with a wee one each year .<br>  now ... Hubby refuses to get one as he thinks it may give him more of a chance to GET a bug , lol.<br>    Hugs , Zzid  :)|`|k9DWHrJ7aa	nopper. never have. so far, so good. in the past i had more hangovers than colds or flu, or maybe i just couldn't tell the difference.|`|t9htoO50aa	I used to get it but not for the last two years. I haven't got the flu with or without it.|`|XAioHGKbaa	No|`|d09ca82ef4d1521ac23c334df2e8eedeaa	Never had one :)|`|AA10698792	Absolutely...my job requires that I have a flu shot and I haven't had the flu since I started working there.  I used to get it every year.<br>  <br>  The problem with the flu shot is that if you're allergic to eggs, you can't have it.  Also a lot of people think the flu shot gives you the flu.  This isn't true.  The shot takes about two weeks to build up enough immunities in your system to fight most strains of the flu and a lot of people catch the flu within that two week period before the shot has fully kicked in. This is why it's important to get it as soon as it becomes available each year so that there are fewer people who actually have the flu who could pass it on to you while the shot is taking effect.|`|c4q4lpr0aa	Yes & yes. I have the shot cos I have asthma, I never bothered before I was 18 but then I got flu, I mean proper flu when I was 18 & I've never been so ill. Ever since I've gotten the flu shot & I've never had flu since.....*touch wood* !! Have a good week, also. x|`|147b4a346dd471babe83771bba6a0923aa	Hi, Julie-Baby!<br>  No. And I've been well. Mostly -in my experience- the flu-shot gives people the flu. I know it was live-virus, and they've stoped that- but it<br>  still seems to be true. So... why fool with success?.. <br>  As I am now about to leave my 20's ( ;0 ) <br>  I may have to reconsider.<br>  Old people have to be more careful. };>|`|1tlgYKROaa	I get one every year and sometimes I still get the flu but never really bad.|`|AA11537389	No, but my son has.  The first few years it seemed to work quite well for him.  This year, not so much.|`|fIAFaNozaa	I didnt have the flu shot and i havent gotten sick|`|TnF42yfRaa	Yes, and not in the slightest...I just got over the flu...out of school for 3 days|`|OLcXtWQyaa	yes. and yes, it seems to help a lot.|`|00CowMv3aa	yes and no|`|Z2GZdpvhaa	no|`|kVDGsDuZaa	No, never had one.<br>  <br>  Thank you!! :) You, too, have a great week!! :)|`|ugvgt6rMaa	Yes i have gotten the flu shot and i got it to not get that sick in the flu reasons. One year i didn't get it because there weren't enough so i got really sick from the flu and didn't go to school for two weeks and my lungs got really bad from it. So yeah it does help to get, now i get every year and i don't get sick like that.|`|7xHfvMIZaa	I think it's against the law not to have a flu shot. We all get them when we're six months old. And yeah, I suppose I would've gotten more sick if I hadn't. Though I don't exactly recall getting the flu at 6 months of age anyway.|`|P93I8CHtaa	i had it,didnt want it,but had it<br>  <br>  it helped me|`|iuWfp2fEaa	No, I have never gotten a flu shot.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Heyyy!<br>  <br>  Yes I have; and they did help.
ThddtEC7aa	Well in terms of music, John Frusciante is far more talented (a better singer, guitarist), is so active in music releasing 5 records in 2004, active in Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ataxia, work with the Mars Volta...<br>  <br>  Has released 10 solo albums which are by far the best music, in terms of a higher level of writing (in particular the empyrean)<br>  <br>  Although John Lennon is more important to music, him and the Beatles really did revolutionise the overall music scene...<br>  <br>  John Frusciante is a better musician though...<br>  And is proberly the best musician since Hendrix...|`|AA11111233	Lennon revolutionized pop and rock music and what it is today, but I'm going to go with Frusciante as well.

fcdZoH72aa	Yes. Miss America's Outstanding Teen is a little sister pageant to Miss America. It's seperate from the more well known Miss Teen USA system, which is part of Miss USA and Miss Universe. <br>  <br>  Outstanding Teen, like Miss America, requires talent and a platform issue.<br>  <br>  I posted a similar answer to your other question, but I saw another poster below me had some really confusing information so I wanted to clarify. A good way to keep the teen pageants seperate is to think about the meaning of Outstanding. Miss America is more focused on scholarship, community involvement and achievement.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.<br>  <br>  For more information you can visit www.missamerica.org or www.maoteen.org.|`|w7G3PVIuaa	yes i guess although theres lots of pagents everywhere|`|cjLxrrTBaa	You must be the smart one in your family...|`|V483nKaeaa	yes

oVxr5B3Eaa	I think the most money-saving way would be to have her KEEP the phone. Try putting it on a lanyard. All phones come with a little spot to hang a charm, you can easily attach it to a lanyard, then maybe she'll have an easier time keeping track of it. <br>  Either that, or call in and report it stolen/lost. That way, you can suspend your contract until she is a little older. It doesn't completely get rid of it, but it will hold off on paying it until she is old enough to handle the phone. Even an 8 year old can handle a phone much better than a 6 year old. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

AA10153769	Congrats!<br>  I just got my Yahoo Answers Top Contributor Badge!<br>  <br>  "A "Top Contributor" is a member of the Yahoo Answers community who has shown that they are knowledgeable in a certain category. Each user can be a top contributor in a maximum three categories.<br>  You earn it or lose it depending on your recent participation in a certain section.<br>  The more positively you contribute, the more chance there is that you will get a TC badge. Just like featured users or category leaders, it's another way to give credit to community members."<br>  <br>  The TC badge is awarded on the number of questions answered and best answers received by the user in a particular week, in a particular category.<br>  <br>  It is rumoured that you need at least a 10 percent best answers in your chosen category to get a TC badge although the actual percentage and the number of answers is Yahoo's secret. <br>  All you see and read on the subject is speculation, rumour, assumption, imagination, and guesswork.<br>  <br>  A user who is on the leader board may or may not have a TC badge, the criteria is measured on weekly participation in a particular category (number of answers and % of best answers in the category).<br>  <br>  The easiest way to get a TC badge is to concentrate on one category where many questions are asked and hope to get some best answers.<br>  <br>  The Polls and Surveys and Jokes and Riddles categories do not have Top Contributors.<br>  <br>  If you have contributed enough to meet Yahoo's criteria, the orange badge will appear below your avatar on Monday morning.<br>  <br>  It can disappear just as easily on Monday morning, if you don't keep answering questions in your chosen category.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  ^_~|`|bsnnEsp5aa	Well you are a TC in this section that basically means you answered a lot of questions in this section last week. A Y!A week starts on Monday and ends on midnight on Sunday, and if you have answered enough questions that week in a particular catagory you get a TC badge for that section.<br>  You also need to be over 11% BA which you are, so that also enabled you too get a TC badge.<br>  To get the badge you would have to get 300+ points in a particular catagory in a week so last week you must have got that in C&A.<br>  <br>  Just a little warning though, you need 75+ points a week from now on too keep your badge. If by Sunday you have not racked up over 75 points you'll lose your badge the following monday, also you must always be over 11% BA.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps :D|`|Hiasgb75aa	Yep, wrong section, but get a decent percentage of best answers in a category and you should get a Top Contributer|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	I don't really know, but it will go away if you stop answering questions for a few days. I need to stop.......Some people are really nasty to Top Contributors........|`|GFndpsBaaa	I would have to point out this is the wrong section, but really, no one knows. Yahoo doesn't release figures. There has been a lot of speculation and guessing though, and as far as we know, it hinges mostly on your percentage of best answers.|`|kU45pIcMaa	umm....well maybe u got alot of Best answers in a certain section and ur Best Answer % is over 11%. Also to keep ur Top Contributor badge, i heard u have to get around 40 Best answers a month.|`|YyaKq8praa	You have to:<br>  get 150 points in that sec.<br>  and at least 10% best answer,<br>  so CONGRATS!<br>  *stars*|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Congrats.<br>  <br>  You just basically answer questions with good honest answers in a particular section. You need about 12% or more to have a TC badge.|`|btFSgJmlaa	TCs is based on a percentage of how many BA's you get in a week, and how many answers you give in a week.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I try to keep over 100 points a week.

RQfLKOPQaa	My religion is stopping me from believing in my religion. That's right!! Just this week there was an article in the news that a 9 year old that was abused by her father was pregnant with twins. When her mother took her to the doctor, the doctor had no doubts, she had to do an abortion, not only it was a rape, but she was also a 9 year old and too young to have children , but it was the doctors opinion that her body wouldn't survive the pregnancy because she had twins. The Catholic church, issued a press release that they would excommunicate the mother  and the doctor, but on the other hand they didn't do it to the father that rapped the child. It wasn't in my country, but it's the same religion, and although I'm catholic, I don't believe in it, and reject it's teachings. No way any God would allow for this to happen and think it's OK. I'm not stupid, and I bet I can match my intelligence to any religious leader in the world. So, the more they try to make me believe and obey, the more I see through it, and look at their hypocrisy...|`|Tj2xROpwaa	nothing, i rarely drink and have not smoked for a year and three months but i do have sex. normally people with a religion think this is bad but i think it is ok since i am with the guy i probably will marry|`|21fee98831946197f4886f287f0a38c1aa	Nothing.

Idk, I feel like i'll die there or something. It's the weirdest thing! Like last summer my family and i went to Florida, and the whole summer after that, I felt like I or someone close to me was GOING to die. Like i was stressing out like crazy. It was weird. <br>  And sometimes, really frumpy lace makes me SO depressed. I don't know why. Like lace curtains.

4r9LRObHaa	"Vag-etarian" is slang for a lesbian. It implies that she only "eats" vagina and thus has no sexual interest in men. It has also been used, also as slang, to describe a male that has no homosexual tendencies. It basically says "Vagina only, please!"<br>  <br>  If you did indeed make a typographical error, as some others seem to think, then you probably meant "Vegetarian". A vegetarian is an individual who does not ingest meat. There are a variety of vegetarians that range from "does not eat meat and fish" to "only eats vegetables" and everything in between. This includes people who both do eat eggs and dairy products and those who don't.|`|4GYCaoP6aa	A lesbian who doesn't eat meat.|`|GW4M0U9Uaa	you only like vagina|`|yqy5xfSbaa	someone who doesnt eat meat|`|mNC4r3EIaa	VAGetarian? lol that's new to me...|`|9z5YJKqLaa	go here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=+vagetarian" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.ph...</a>|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	VAGetarian?<br>  Someone who eats strictly ρussy...<br>  I think they say that in Superbad|`|7hrOjPwjaa	Someone who only eats 'vagina'<br>  <br>  A vEgetarian doesnt eat meat.|`|NREqhragaa	.... are u 5? ... i figured out what vegetarian ment wen i was 4...

Z15TM1VQaa	Tail of the Moon (aka: Tsuki no Shippo)<br>  Becoming a ninja is the best think that can happen for fifteen year old Usagi, but it’s impossible! Usagi is only good with herbs and making medicine, she can’t even do the basic things all ninjas know and everyone knows that. The only thing is she wants to be a ninja so she can go on missions and leave the small village she has always lived in. One day Usagi’s great grandfather (the leader of the village) tells her that he has an assignment that only she can do, “marry Hanzo Hattori and bare his children”. Usagi along with Mamezo (a child she has raised from a young age) go to Segachi, the place Hanzo lives at. Hanzo instantly rejects Usagi the moment he finds out why she came, but she doesn’t leave and he is made her ninja instructor by… Her grandfather? With love on the horizon, enemies almost around every corner, a strict teacher, and her ex-fiancé Goemon around all the time, will she be able to do such a treacherous life-long task?<br>  <br>  Love Monster<br>  After failing her high school entrance exam, Hiyo Osora becomes desperate; so when she receives an acceptance letter from the prestigious SM Academy it is like a godsend. The fact that she did not apply is trivial and she immediately decides on going. However, what she didn't expect to find there was a school full of monsters, least of all one that was convinced she was his fiance!<br>  <br>  Tokyo Crazy Paradise (gender bender)<br>  It's the year 2020 AD, and Tokyo II is a city infested with crime. Women can no longer go out in the streets alone without being victimized. Not wanting their daughter to suffer the same fate, Tsukasa Kozuki's cop parents raise her instead as a boy. When they are suddenly killed by one of the yakuza's in-fights, Tsukasa is left orphaned on the streets along with her three brothers. With no other options, she goes to the only person she can think of for help: pokerface Ryuji Shirogami, her classmate of 8 years and also the head leader of the powerful yakuza group, Kuryugumi. Ryuji, whose father was also a victim of the same yakuza fight, agrees to take her on as his personal bodyguard. As they set out to find their enemy, Ryuji slaps on an increasing amount of debt onto Tsukasa using all manners of ploys necessary to keep the reluctant Tsukasa by his side.<br>  <br>  Animal X: Aragami no Ichizoku (Gender bender)<br>  27 year-old Ayukawa Yuuji has never been much of a man. He's more comfortable sewing than fighting, he faints at the sight of blood, and his fiancee is tougher than he is. He's also a terrible pushover. So when his boss at the medical lab volunteers him for some experimental drug therapy, how can he possibly refuse? All's mediocre for Yuuji: master of the pathetic.<br>  Mediocre, that is, until a juvenile mass murder suspect jumps out from under Yuuji's bed, declaring him his "mate." Before Yuuji has time to argue, the stranger transforms into a 16 foot-tall dinosaur and beheads his roommate...<br>  Yuuji suddenly finds himself the sole target of a lost race that turns into dinosaurs, an extremely scary woman with a Goddess-Complex, the yakuza, and a mad scientist.<br>  Animal X: Daichi no Okite (sequal to Animal X: Aragami no Ichizoku)<br>  Animal X: Genshi Sairai (I think this is the last part of the Animal X: Aragami no Ichizoku books)<br>  <br>  Kami to Sengoku Seitokai<br>  '...if you actually decide to go for it... and do become president of the student council...'<br>  'This school... is at the center of the entire universe.'<br>  Those were the words of Vice President of the Student Council, Kagura Mami that were said to Katsuragi Musashi on the first day they met. <br>  What's the secret of that school? What's the mystery behind it all? And what's the past that haunts Kagura and Katsuragi?<br>  <br>  Gravitation<br>  As a member of a musical duo on the verge of making it into show business, Shindou Shuichi has a lot on his mind -- especially since he writes the songs for his Bad Luck band. His life gets no less hectic when he bumps into Yuki Eiri, a successful yet cynical author extraordinaire, who immediately insults Shuichi’s lyrics upon reading them. Seeking him out to demand an apology, Shuichi nevertheless sees other facets of Eiri’s personality. Can he accept the fact that he might be developing feelings for the novelist who discredited his work on their first meeting?<br>  <br>  Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles<br>  It's about a group of four people that come from different dimensions; their names are Syaoran, Sakura, Fay, and Kurogane. They have to travel to different dimensions in search of Sakura's memories (also known as here feathers) that scattered around the galaxy or she will die. Syaoran is her childhood friend, Fay is a powerful magician who doesn't want to return to his world, and Kurogane is a powerful warrior who wishes to return to his world. Together they travel through various dimensions with the help of white mokona (they had gotten mokona from the Witch of Dimensions) to find a solution to their different goals.. <br>  <br>  Fruits Basket<br>  About a young high school girl named Tohru who begins living under the same roof as the most popular person in the hole school, Yuki Sohma. Tohru finds out that certain members of the Sohma family have a curse on them, when hugged by members of the opposite sex, they turn into animals from the zodiac. Since Tohru is a girl living with three of the zodiac guys, she sometimes turns them into animals (obviously).|`|b6a987550f582ba088fcd9ab0f50f52aaa	Just seconding Ellie's suggestions.

On the other hand, if you tell a lady she's hot, she won't just take the compliment, she'll even think that you're into her. Then that's another story. So if people are being straightforward, you have to read between the lines. Maybe they're not interested in the conversation or you. Sometimes telling the painful truth is the best way to end things.|`|yaAhsEwxaa	im straight up with things.if your ugly ill tell you.if your a ***** ill say it,,if your hot ill straight up tell you that id hit it. your right though most people dont really come clean about these kind of things.but i like to live my life to the fullest,,not taking life to seriously and learn from my mistakes so i have no problem being straight up about this kind of thing.|`|UnqAjpVOaa	isn't being straight forward and truthful the whole point of it being ones opinion?

39cf945a4e570ec03e0673777fc1d801aa	Maybe Helena just had someone to have plastic surgery to look like Emily.  I definetly think that Rebecca is up to something, why stay in a town where everyone thinks you are a ghost and you place of employment burned down.  She has an agenda.|`|ce35927379e187a9a9405823379c0faaaa	What if Emily wasn't killed off (like I'd really care). It would make sense the way Rebecca looks and acts so 'confused' at times. This is, after all, soap land.<br>  But if this is 'Rebecca Shaw', I have no doubt that Helena would use her to her advantage to obtain control over Nicholas. And if Rebecca is Emily's twin, it may just come out on it's own. Rebecca seems to have a desire to remain disconnected from all of Emily's friends.|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	Rumor has it that Helena is coming back and may have brainwashed Emily into becoming Rebecca. Maybe that will come to light in the next few months.|`|tgVGE2Umaa	She may not be Emily's twin. Nobody really knows yet, it is all just speculation. I'm sure something big will happen with her in coming months.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	She may not be, Helenda Cassadine is on her way back to town and rumor is she drugged Emily to make her appear dead. Diego strangled her but she didnt die thanks to the drugs and after they took her away, Helena took her and paid people off! Just like she did with Lucky!|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I don't think Rebecca knows Emily. I think Helena rescued Emily and brainwashed her, giving her a new life. I read she has memories of Emily.

Use whatever comes to mind or whatever fits. Anything can be turned into an excuse, its not like theyll know exactly what your doing at the moment anyway since your only on the phone. Good luck! I know how you feel! I know it sounds bad but i often used these excuses on my old girlfriend.|`|yGm29f3Eaa	Say "I am really sorry but I am having a bout of diarrhea and if I don't get off the phone right now I am going to be sending you a dry cleaning bill"|`|fDYxwfYwaa	Say -You need help, You're on the telephone and you won't shut up!|`|SjLDdUh7aa	Tell them your boss needs you.|`|Z2GZdpvhaa	act like you dont hear them and hang up|`|e7410cdd309fbe8be4f14fa845e27703aa	Call your work number from your cell phone and let it ring a few times and then say "I'm going to have to let you go.

VzzQP2PJaa	Through your subjects in highschool see what interest you most.  Its good that your concerned but don't get worried you still have time.

Spend the next few years figuring out what interests you, where your passions lie, what you're good at. Once you get a handle on those things, you'll have a much better idea of what your career path ought to be.

Lol most people just end up in a job, its very difficult to decide what you like doing when you have never done it, so my advice would be to do lots of voluntary work and see what suits you.<br>  <br>  I am 28 with a degree in Fine Art and Art History and I ended up in admin with a huge student loan hanging round my neck! Talk to family and friends, maybe ask what their jobs are like, even if you don't find something you do like you can narrow it down if you find things you think you wouldn't like.<br>  <br>  Its best if you do decide early and stick with it coz your A-Level and uni choices affect how your cv turns out. I am often asked at interviews why I am not an artist, my answer is always coz its not financially viable and takes a lot of time for a little money.|`|0O3JvmE7aa	First,before anything else,you need to learn how to spell the words "what" and "you".|`|nwYZWwDHaa	idk... its confusing... dont worry... it'll come to you... try to take those free career tests online... and try talking to your counsleor. good luck! :)|`|yDnBqGheaa	Chill, I didn't figure it out till my 3rd year of college.<br>  <br>  Just go to college and take your general requirements, you will figure it out.|`|K4fpxwNxaa	DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT...

I am an English teacher so let me make a few suggestions (very minor!!)<br>  <br>      Some may see him as our nation’s most courageous athletic competitor; others may distinguish him as the individual who fought severe cancer. But overall Lance Armstrong is an inspiration to those who have battled the devastating disease of cancer. In 1999, Armstrong was diagnosed with testicular cancer, from that point he has defeated not only this disease but has proven to all that he can attain any obstacle that may come in the way of his success. As he once stated, “Beyond that, I guess there is no real ranking, but my commitment in the cancer community will increase significantly.”|`|VA3tGarQaa	repulsive isn't the right word.<br>  and neither is 'obtain' any obstacle.<br>  <br>  apart from that,it's great.<br>  <br>  don't be offended, i'm only trying to provide constructive criticism.|`|SY9OaAwbaa	ok looks good, be sure to continue writing in a standard that looks like youre trying so its more of a shock when you bel air it near the end.|`|C5QV222iaa	good good|`|Uzayv72kaa	great!|`|IM6UsVC2aa	numa numa yei<br>  numa numa yei<br>  numa numa numa yei<br>  <br>  this is definately the wrong category. i just put up some lyrics to the numa numa song. does that say anything about p and s?|`|3VnkDP6maa	the phrase, the repulsive disease of cancer, doesnt sound right, try using something like destructive instead of repulsive|`|ekpg6v1Kaa	Girl it is as good as you have typed it?|`|SAhLZ85Laa	f'ing fantastic|`|DPZ5g3NCaa	like it|`|LOgmCZdzaa	ooo, i like that.|`|9CHjZ8sBaa	That guy is a huge inspiration to me.

Some time ago, it joined the pantheon of brands adopted by label-conscious but not particularly upmarket british youths, notably soccer fans. As a direct corollary, and most damagingly of all, Burberry - and particularly its iconic check pattern  - has become associated with 'chavs'. The etymology of the term 'chav' is unclear - theories range from the romany word for 'child' to the starightforward acronym of 'Council Housed and Violent' - but it has been widely adopted by the british media to describe a certain type of downmarket consumer. ALso known as Britain's peasent underclass.'<br>  <br>  <br>  As with emo's on the otherhand, they appear to be much more friendly in nature with a better quality of life. I found out recently that it is considered that 'emo' people generally move on in their lives to become lawyers, or work in the professional industry such as accounting and even nursing aswell as in the creative industry such as art, photography and fashion whereas chavs have a less advantage and earn the lesser mostly staying behind and working in the trade business or retail shops. <br>  <br>  There's more but I can't be assed to write it.|`|CRuxWsi0aa	I like your boyfriend|`|ne2sEeLJaa	I'm not any of them, but I prefer emo's to be honest.

rwGTRUj0aa	Their relationship does not effect me at all. Even though domestic violence is not tolerable at all it is a sad truth that it happens every day in every country all around the world. The only reason it is such a big deal is because they are 'celebrities'. I don't remember hearing nearly this much about the scott peterson  or the chandra leavy cases and those were way more serious.|`|ft8t98Pnaa	Rhianna is the only person that will have to realize that... people can tell her all they want to.. but she is the one that has to have the courage to leave|`|822da6b7b24693d516953606bfb56517aa	i agree!<br>  if rhianna takes chris back, she is setting a horrible example for young girls|`|AA11660242	I totally agree with you. I don't know what it is, but people are too gullible and just plain stupid to know what's good for them. If you get your *** kicked by someone that "loves" you, then they don't really love you, do they? I hope that if Chris hits Rihanna again, it will serve the world (especially women) as an example that you shouldn't go back into the arms of a person that hurts you either physically or emotionally.|`|fnytzXWTaa	I agree.....I did feel bad for rhianna,but now I'm not all that sorry she got her self in this situation. So, what ever happens she knew it would be coming sooner or later.|`|MzSFaebraa	I Agree Completely.|`|x0J8S5sWaa	Agreed on all points. Chris Brown probably (don't personally know him) isn't a horrible person, but he does need to learn his lesson so that he never does that again. If Rihanna does or already has taken him back, how is he going to learn? In his mind beating up girlfriend = girlfriend taking him back = no consequences = why not do it again next time he's mad? Like you said, domestic violence is a very serious crime. Without treatment and help it's a cycle that often continues from one generation to the next. Chris Brown's stepfather was apparently abusive, and now we can see it's starting in his life. <br>  <br>  Hopefully Chris Brown get's sentenced, for both his own good and Rihanna's, and Rihanna gets a mandatory resting period to collect her thoughts. She was the victim here and she needs to have some space. If he goes to jail and comes out a changed man and they want to get back together, I'm all for it. But for now I don't think it's good for either one.|`|xr7JRAuzaa	i think that oprah is wrng i dnt thnk chris will hit rihanna nemore but she is right about 1 thing rihanna should wait b4 another relationship. chris shouldnt have 2 go 2 jail though.|`|2OS6mq6Saa	I think this story is over done, what about the unfamous females in abusive relationships, nobody gives a rats about them it seems.|`|6kmlboNAaa	ah who cares its only rhianna im pretty sure worse things are happening in the world than that!|`|e913314056b0ff092cd25829149fdd7faa	Not her place.

I think it's just a weird little sketch..|`|87f0ad7fe13903495b1962fa8df652efaa	At the 51st Grammy Awards ceremony on February 8, 2009, all three members of the band appeared onstage for the first time since December 2004.[10] Barker announced the band's reformation, stating that "we used to play music together, and we decided we're going to play music together again," with Hoppus adding, "Blink-182 is back!" A message appearing on the band's website the same day confirmed the reformation and added that the band was in the studio writing and recording a new album and preparing for a world tour.[10] The band also updated their "smiley face" logo to feature six arrows instead of the previous five.<br>  <br>  After the on-stage announcement many fans began to speculate on Travis Barker's arm being in a sling. An MTV article released on February 10 claimed that Barker had recently undergone surgery to repair "extensive nerve damage," from which a recovery could take up to ten weeks. This will not affect the tour, which is scheduled for the summer of 2009.[24]<br>  <br>  On February 16, DeLonge confirmed that Blink-182 would be touring in "a big event" this summer. DeLonge went on to note that his commitments with Angels & Airwaves would be held off and the band would release a new album coupled with a feature film in 2010. DeLonge stated that the new Blink-182 record would be a fusion of all his previous works, including Box Car Racer and Angels & Airwaves.[25]<br>  <br>  On February 19, Mark Hoppus was interviewed by Alternative Press about Blink-182's reformation and plans for the band's next album. Hoppus stated that they are six songs into the album and are hoping for a 2009 release date.[26]
y2t3F690aa	EVERYTHNG IMAGINEABLE<br>  <br>  MSM / Mechanically separated meat / advanced meat bone separation / meat recovery systems - if it does, this is often chicken, either way, the "meat" is obtained as follows: Once they have stripped as much "real meat" from the bones, the bones (along with skin, feet and heads) and put into a giant centrifuge - that spins at an extremely high speed. VERY powerful (x,000 psi) water jets are directed into the drum and the contents basically break down into a "slightly gritty pink slurry".<br>  <br>  Better quality hot-dogs may not contain chicken / MSM - but the "budget" ones nearly always do.<br>  <br>  Add to that the rest of the pig that you would not normally consider "meat". In the UK - and I strongly suspect elsewhere - the **ONLY** part of the pig that cannot be legally added to the pot if the left ear - which is the part that takes all the jabs / inoculations / hormones etc.<br>  <br>  EVERYTHING else is fair game, intestines, brain, "bits", skin, bone (after being liquidized into slurry by high pressure centrifuges).<br>  <br>  Then they add a hint or two of glutinous matter, a bit more pink dye and some spices to it. Squeeze it out into an edible plastic tube and voila - one hot dog :) Intestines ARE fair game for a hot-dog but are not usually used as the casings - these are used only for better quality (!) sausages.<br>  (((((THERE YU GO)))))|`|LMNAJxf7aa	aniaml extra parts i dont eat them i ony eat all beef ones|`|dksB1B0Laa	I know hotdogs come from a part of the pigs intestines...idk<br>  But it can come in pork, turkey, or beef|`|P4WJD6Cpaa	Most hot dogs are beef.

UnqAjpVOaa	To be honest there are no advantages of wearing one, except it migt make you feel a bit sexier. The disadvantages are that they are uncomfortable (I think), Leave nothing to the imagination, they don't look to good and you also get infections down there because it rubs from back to front passing bacteria around if you get me...|`|79677842fc75f4c703b1a6bba9de5d48aa	i dont like thongs|`|KHL4N6mtaa	pros ; no panty lines<br>  cons ; easily stick out of your jeans & they are annoying. it's like a constant wedgie sometimes.|`|VA3tGarQaa	advantages: there are none<br>  disadvantages: they are uncomfortable and they increase your chances of getting a bacterial infection.|`|A1YlBTkDaa	wearing one-<br>  when your wearing tight leggings or tna pants or jogging pants, your underwear line won show.<br>  <br>  not wearing one-<br>  the underwear line will show|`|AilIV0oPaa	I dont wear thongs at all.

tgCuwPJ5aa	You should consider that marijuana, while not addictive, does have lasting negative effects. I'm no expert on it, but I do know that serious use of the drug can cause the neurons in your brain to have difficulty communicating with each other. Whatever the case, I am not just reading off a website, because i have some personal experience. When I had just started college, having had my parents kick me out of the house for reasons that are too complicated to get into but entirely not my fault, I moved in temporarily with a friend who sold pot. Long story short, I smoked myself silly for a while. I only smoked for about 3 months, but there was some heavy use there. I haven't smoked for three years, but i still feel a few lasting effects. For example, my reading speed has gone down, my concept of time is completely shot, and I'm not as good with math anymore. But i'm an english major and numbers suck anyway.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'd say yes, this is probably a result of your drug use. I wouldn't worry too much, because the effects i'm feeling are more of a bother than a handicap, but when you smoke marijuana, there can be effects even if you haven't used the drug recently. And, honestly, not to make fun, but your problem does sound exactly like someone that's stoned would do.<br>  <br>  My advice to you, not to harp on you, would be to stop. Not because you're above the influence, not because it's a gateway drug, not because it's illegal, but because of what can happen. I do know how much fun it can be, but I can say with all honesty that I wish i'd never done it to begin with. But, you know, its life. we just deal with it.|`|x3uCecWsaa	Alzheimer's|`|DUjr9tNUaa	Yeah get baked and watch a stupid/funny movie...your thinking wayyyy to much.

But girls are more comfortable with themselves and can appear more sensitive than guys!|`|xuIDb9YTaa	I think so, but there are some sensitive guys out there too.|`|QhT9MjEoaa	Some. I've dated a few guys who were JUST as sensitive as I am  which was comforting but a little weird at the same time.

b32501726d33018adfee15dc84a32f79aa	I worked in a record store for about a year in '95 or '96.  Being surrounded by tunes and helping customers with questions and suggestions were the high points.  I wasn't a fan of the hours, though.<br>  <br>  The band part was earlier...I was in a band back in '94.  I liked recording and working with some of the musicians involved, but it was difficult working with one person in particular who really wasn't open to any ideas or input from the rest of the group.  I had a very idealized notion of what it would be like and it was a rude awakening when this particular situation didn't follow suit.<br>  <br>  Most of what I've learned about Rock music, though, has just been from listening to it and interacting with other fans.  That was the best education as far as I'm concerned.<br>  <br>  Edit: Perse - AGREED.  I keep the very cool interactions and customers I dealt with front-of-mind, but there were some rather annoying aspects of the job.  It did seem like we were pushers for certain pop acts/artists at times, having to plaster the entire store with collateral and stuff sent to us from the labels and marketing people.  And then play the music too...ugh.  We always took over the stereo over for an hour or so before closing and played what *we* wanted...fight the power! :)<br>  <br>  And the alphabetizing...ick!  It was also horrible when people decided to stick discs they decided not to buy in other sections as they walked out... *grrr*<br>  <br>  PJ - getting free stuff *did* rock...|`|01828ba3a2ceab3b3b6ed1d24349e9d6aa	I personally never worked at a record store, but I used<br>  to go weekly in the 1980s & the 1990s and go buy a bunch of used CDs, tapes and Vinyls...all the time. I probably have spent about $10,000 on Cds, DVDs, gig tix, etc in my lifetime in the last 20 years...<br>  <br>  This is how I know so many bands because of all the thousands of dollars I spent on music in the last 20 years. But, I have also have worked at a music store in 2002 for month in the drums dept, I didnt sell enough drums so I was fired. I also worked at a rehearsal studios in 2003 for 3 months too. I also was former drum roadie for 2 underground LA bands. They are my former friends bands and I no longer speak to him because we are 2 completely different places as musicians.<br>  <br>  I have personally in the Guitar Center 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 , 2007 Drum -Off contests so that does qualify me as real musician.<br>  and in the Sam Ash Drum finals in 2000 too. I've been working as a Solo Artist for 5 years now and I know poeple who own Rehearsal and recording Studio because I have spent so much time and money in their places. Recording Studios are like big candy stores because you really can make kind of song you want to make if you're willing to try and experiment a little with all the weird and cool sound effects.<br>  <br>  I also used to be good friends with a guy who owned a local record store, but his Record Store business went bankrupt due to mass online music sales. He sold his business like 5 years ago. Because all people have to do is just go online and buy singles....they figure...why should I go to an actual store and buy the real CD when I go download it for 99 cents???|`|tx2lX6Rfaa	I have my own record store in my room lol<br>  Let's see I learned what I did about rock music because one day when I was about 9/10, my teacher in school told me about this band called "The Who" (Heard of them? LOL i'm kidding but back then I was clueless<br>  <br>  Anyways I thought their name was cool and I checked out a book in the library. Soon after I saw this documentary on woodstock and I was hooked on rock and roll. First I knew about the who, then jimi, janis, beatles, stones, zeppelin, ac/dc, aerosmith. etc etc<br>  <br>  My favorite bands are Led Zeppelin and Nirvana.<br>  But it was The Who's interesting name that got me into rock. Back in 1999 :)<br>  And now I am a walking talking musical encyclopedia, not just of classic rock but I mean everything from 40's jazz to modern indie<br>  <br>  I've never been in a band but I play the guitar because of my dad.|`|vvbhO88maa	I always heard the music my parents listened to growing up, so they influenced my taste. Especially my dad. He'd give us(my brothers and sisters and I) albums and tell us to listen to them. My parents also took the family to a lot of concerts, they still do. Concerts like Jimmy Page  Robert Plant, Prince, Elton John, David Bowie, and a few others. My mom did a large part too. She would get me to watch The Monkees reruns on Nick @ Nite with her, I guess they reminded her of her childhood, and she got me to like Steely Dan and Stevie Nicks a lot. So, my parents introduced me to certain groups and artists, and then I further ventured into them and found different ones on my own. My older sister got me to appreciate The Beatles, Stevie Wonder, and Queen a whole lot too at a young age, way more than my parents did. It would be cool if I did get to work in a record store.|`|yS61H04haa	I worked at one for about 3 years. I was like a crack dealer, trying to push Mer Des Noms on people. LOL! Working at a mall isn't as awesome as people think it would be. ;)  That was almost 10 years ago. ( Wow! Mer Des Nom is almost 10 years old! )<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't claim to have too much knowledge, just opinions.<br>  <br>  <br>  *****<br>  <br>  <br>  Its not as much fun as people think, is it Sookie? You have to listen to what the labels pay to get played. For example if the new Britney Spears is out, you will have to play that. When I was working there, there was a new N Sync and a new Britney Cd, not fun to listen to. It isn't like you get to blast Tool, Alice In Chains or Pantera all day. Plus, constantly following people re alphabetizing the CDS is not what its cracked up to be.<br>  <br>  <br>  ***<br>  <br>  Oh PJ, I forgot about getting Promos. I had the coolest promo of hungarian prayer chants. It had Perry Ferrell on it. It was so ethereal . I loved it. I can't remember the name anymore and haven't run across it. <br>  <br>  Moral of story: Never loan out your CDs. <br>  <br>  <br>  I miss the discount too.|`|XO4talxxaa	I learned everything from my parents! They have great taste in music and taught me so much about music! :) We watched Mtv and Vh1 all the time and played watched the music Jeopardy on sunday lol! Music is a huge part of my life and will always will be. We always had the music on in our house!|`|WrUTuQdlaa	No. But in 60's and 70's there weren't as many artists as today so was a lot easier to keep up.<br>  So many today that gave up.|`|TCehI17kaa	Nope. Can't say i ever have.|`|yz6G7jfXaa	Yup, i did work in one for a year.<br>  sadly, not many of the records i sold were rock.<br>  <br>  i used to listen to music on Mtv or VH1, and slowly collected music, until i got the entire music collection of a friend. got around 20 gigs now, and that includes the records i got for myself from the store i worked in.<br>  i have to say, the work really enhanced my music knowledge, although i wasn't allowed to open CDs, but managed to listen to them on a request from costumers, sometimes i opened them without telling my boss!<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  I gotta agree too, working in a music store wasn't the most exciting job in the world, especially when costumers ask you for records of artists you've never herd of, and couldn't care less about! I had to sell them something or the other, just to make my boss happy.<br>  after all, you're just a salesman most of the time.<br>  but the worst part was listening to horrible music, over and over and over agin! I mean Britney and other solo blood suckers! mostly because I was out numbered by panzy co workers who didn't ever listen to a single rock track before i joined.<br>  I did get my revenge by playing Pantera and Maiden when my boss wasn't there.... and i did blow the amp once!|`|dFacbjIZaa	No but I used to hang out in one a lot for almost a year cause of this smoking hot babe that worked there, I wanted her bad, lol. I was also pretty good friends with the manager so I know a lot about how they work, place their orders etc.<br>  <br>  I learned what I know about rock music by soaking up ever single piece of information I could get from books, magazines, TV shows, liner notes and whatever else I could get My hands on about rock music for the last 26 years.|`|vyibqOKXaa	I've never worked at a record store. All i know about rock music I got from listening to the radio, searching a lot online, and hearing my friends different iPods. I am also into playing the guitar, so I looked tabs up and other things to play songs, and I developed the knowledge of different bands and stuff.|`|Ml22a6evaa	have an older sister by five years she was 13 in 1964,Listening to her music come out of her room got me hooked at an early age|`|N62uLMf3aa	I've been trying to get a job at my local record store since I was 15, but they are NEVER hiring! I grew up listening to what my mom listened to, and she would tell me things. No, I am not in a band.|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	I learned what I know about rock music from several different sources:<br>  There were NO personal computers when I was "growing up".  I learned a lot by reading music publications such as Rolling Stone, Hit Parader,etc., reading about the artist on the album covers, hearing about artists on the radio & news, and from word of mouth from other people who liked the same artists as me.|`|tuvcxnJXaa	A lot of what I learned, I learned just like most others : from listening to various musicians, from talking to other music fans, MTV (when they actually played videos), radio, etc.<br>  <br>  I also worked at a radio station between 1988-90.   I was exposed to a lot of music I might not have otherwise been exposed to during that time.    I also grew to hate most of the music released during that 2-year stretch, simply by having to hear it 5-10 times more than the radio-listening public did.<br>  <br>  The worst part, for me, about working in radio was having to pretend that I was SO excited about playing a song that I hoped to never hear again.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	No but I would spend hours on end  in the stores, you could say I was there more than the staff. We had no malls, and a lot of the music stores were family run, so in most cases you knew the family, I have or had many friends in the music field doing one thing or the other. I play a little guitar also. I was a DJ and bouncer a little later on in my life at a biker bar. There were some really crazy night at that time. When I was a teen my house is where everybody wanted to be, be cause of my music collection which was not as big as it is today. But still I had 10 times more music than my peers of that time.  Plus I was listening to stuff they never even heard of yet, at that time that is. Today I have well over 3000 lps not counting over 600 cds and tapes.<br>  And most of my record collection are all original albums I bought as a teen. And I had all most every type of music book, paper you could think of. My friends would say if you needed to know something about a band or artist, just go as Dave. So almost every waken moment of my life has been music. Today I don't follow a lot of the new bands not because they are not good, its just there are to many for me to keep up with. But I do try and own music from different styles of music just so I know whats going on in the music world. Speaking for myself, I don't know as much as I thought I did, until I came here on R & P, there are some very knowledgeable people here. and you are one of them my friend, I've learned from young and old.<br>  take care<br>  dave|`|OTFzJbaMaa	ello. <br>  <br>  no ive never worked in a record store but that woudl be a terrific job for me it would actually make working enjoyable lol. <br>  i know what i know about music by watching alot of documentairs and vh1 classic where they play only stuff about rock n roll. <br>  also i look things up on the enternet.|`|7fEVNng5aa	Yup. I spent 7 or 8 glorious years in one. One of the best time periods of my life. I went in a metalhead and came out with love for just about everything. Getting promos was *awesome*. "Neener Neener Neener! I already have Aenima and *yooooooouuuu* doooooon't"<br>  -------<br>  <br>  Perse- Luckily for me, I wasn't at a mall store, and we didn't put up with that BS about the Labels buying the playstock. The last 4 years or so I was one of the managers there, and it was *my* playstock, so we did get to listen to Tool, Kyuss, etc.<br>  ---<br>  Sookie- probably half my collection is promos! Nothing like free cd's to expand your tastes!<br>  -----<br>  Perse- Excellent moral! I don't know how many I lost by loaning them out. And the discounts, ahhhhhhhh, those were awesome. I had an account that I could charge stuff to, also. That was dangerous for me.

9W3nLL6iaa	Plot summary for<br>  Genesis II (1973) (TV) More at IMDbPro ?<br>  advertisement<br>  <br>  Dylan Hunt, a scientist, puts himself into suspended animation in a NASA cavern in 1979 to establish if he could be brought back to life in a couple of days to research into extending the process to astronauts. However the cavern collapses during an earthquake and Dylan doesn't recover until the year 2133. During the 154 years he had slept, war has broken out and the world's scientists rebelled against the war-loving military and developed a society known as the Pax, whose goal is to keep the spirit of mankind alive. However there are also the mutant Tyranians who plan to be Nazi-like rulers of the slowly recovering world. Dylan is tricked by the Tyranians who plan to use his knowledge of the past to rebuild their nuclear generator and therefore make their plans complete.

QRWIUk7Naa	Honestly, it just came to me today after seeing the report come back at the police station.  I think it's Steffy's brother - I forget his name but didn't Pam make a sweater for him?  It was black and he responded that it's his favorite sweater and he wears it all the time.  Anyway - that's my guess.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Erm with an avatar like that and you aren't asking footy questions..?You deserve Beckham.|`|arjB50zBaa	My guess is Pam.<br>  Ridge is far to obvious and so is Owen because Owen already threatened him.<br>  Pam is disposable to the show so she is who my money is on. Although it sounds like it is right up Stephanies alley.|`|BLmyeLdTaa	I think it is Pam or Owen because they are not regulars on the show so they would be the first to leave. I was also wondering though about that weird guy Jake I think his name is but I don't know what his motive would be. He just looks shady to me.

In my opinion its as bad as "how to build an a-bomb in your basement".<br>  <br>  Now, these guys and girls who read about how to be a better date, how to impress people or get noticed, I dont blame them. Some of those things are skills and you can b e born with them or acquire them through time. Its like people who read books on how to lose weight or how to cook. Same principal.|`|Uq9qPZ75aa	It comes naturally.|`|VA3tGarQaa	Lonely. Little bit desperate.

pMFLqU0Yaa	No, that's not typically Victorian. <br>  <br>  The reason "why" - Well, it's called "artistic license" and it's when someone alters things in a movie, novel, poem, song that is based on another work or on actual history to make their version more exciting or interesting to their audience.
nDhWb5Fgaa	Hahaha Guy - I'm usually as p*ssed as a parrot on Saturday nights if that's any help lol!

However, as my wife often indicates, my attention span is that of a butterfly which flutters around in my vacuous skull. Therefore, I would say, as I ease into my Gillows chaise-lounge and allow the gin to flow to my head,  I am, guilty as charged.|`|mMmNEljxaa	I'm clean dear my name is Maureen and I get sheets out anyday there is wind.|`|186deac21531919b3fa042717df297e7aa	only on a saturday , rest of the time i use a duvet xxx
S5mGcUewaa	I'm not sure how long but it takes a very long time. It all starts with an idea, and by the time they start turning that idea into reality it could take years for them to get a project over and done with. I'd say from when they actually start the project, it takes about a year or so. But as I earlier mentioned it could also take years, e.g. they could announce to start working on a film and not actually start production until a bout a year or more later.|`|4bc7b70eda9643e233469e2d9bca1f54aa	it depends on the film. if it's an indi film then then it will only be a couple of months because of the low budget whereas a big budget movie can take up to a year depending on what it's about and how many locations it uses. it also depends on whether everything goes alright or if they have problems and also like i said before how many locations it uses.|`|MCXsFvgnaa	i think 10 months. that's approximately how long all of the films i've ever watched seemed to have been made during.<br>  it depends on whether you want it to be really good, or a film for just a laugh, which rarely happens these days.<br>  <br>  Nish

He hates like, half of my friends. He doesn't go to my school. He likes any girl who likes him. He's an athiest. When I broke up with him he threatened to comit suicide. but he didnt. Oh ya and one more thing. When he can't get a girlfriend, he texts like, every girl he's ever went out with "i love you" so he can get a girl. He was the biggest idiot i've ever met in my whole life.|`|y5FfKGAsaa	Lack of communication.

I thought that I could forgive him & get over that, but as time went by I realized I couldn't. He also lost my love & concern by always pointing out my flaws & never admitting to his wrong doings. <br>  <br>  Now when I think back on him & those times I am thankful I was able to part from him just in time.<br>  <br>  I'm now focusing on myself & trying to meet new people. ^_^|`|TbvRLumkaa	we dated for a year and we were both 17 and he hadn't dated anyone else so i got the whole "i need space to date around" speech..really broke my heart too but it worked out for the best looking back now..(that was about 7 years ago ) ..he was also my "first"   <br>  <br>            :o)|`|VA3tGarQaa	he was so jealous of everything i did.<br>  so i dumped him while i was in the airport, waiting to catch a flight to france so i didn't have to be with him for the rest of the summer!|`|mr5qcM3Laa	because my best friend decided it would be cute to get oin my boyfriend's IM and pretend to be him and break up with me to mess with me.|`|uLelMuqZaa	I realized I was too young for a boyfriend (and I don't plan on having another for a year or two).

He would put me at the bottom of his priority list and he would hardly ever look at me at school..<br>  He broke up with me because he thinks that I deserve way better, which i do.. I'm just stubborn and still want him haha =/<br>  He still loves me and cares about me and that's why (he said) he broke up with me-he wants me to find the one I'm meant to be with and if I'm dating a "jerk like him" --his words-- I wouldn't find him, which is true.. So all in all, this breakup was probably for the better. =(|`|wUSfYGGzaa	I don't really know. He just became distant and secretive so I just broke up with him.

hXSSCFZIaa	I love Tom Green and at this point I want him to win.  I also like Jesse James, but I'm not sure he is shrewd enough to go all the way in the competition.  However, Jesse reminds me a lot of Trace Adkins (who got second place last season).  Both Trace and Jesse are soft-spoken nice guys, but both are very smart and have good ideas.  In my opinion, Tom Green is the smartest person on the show (and he is the most entertaining person to watch as well).  Scott Hamilton was a moron for picking "EEE" as a name for super hero...what a douche.  I'm so glad he went instead of Tom.

W9XTYRHpaa	I think the Beatles song is about possibly going through a rough relationship, and wanting to resolve it instead of running away from it. It's a good song, but not so much sentimental value to me. The Blue Oyster Cult song doesn't mean as much to me.<br>  <br>  Another song that touched me was "Fade to Black" by Metallica. Some will say, "Oh, heavy metal, thats all about anger and hate." But honestly, it's a great song. It was written after singer/guitarist James Hetfield had much of his equipment stolen, including a rare amplifier given to him from his mother. Him and drummer Lars Ulrich were obsessed with death at the tie. It's a suicide song. When I feel down, all I need to do is listen to this song and it helps me channel the sadness to... well... anger. It makes me want to do things. You should listen to it, it's one of Metallica's more emotional songs.

Obviously they aim for getting the approval of the public and present this celebrity as someone to relate to.<br>  <br>  What I consider that affects public opinion the most is the media, mostly gossip blogs, magazines and certain so-called journalists, and the PR team behind celebrities.

xqrwDmyUaa	Slumdog Millionaire is a VERY good movie, critics are raving about it with good reason, it's well writing, well acted and beautifully shot. There is never a dull moment, it's goes from sad to funny to frightening all in few minutes and then back again. It's definitely worth watching. I was a bit, disappointed is the wrong word, but I am so used to great movie having this shock or twist this movie isn't like that, it's pretty straightforward, what happens is shocking but not it that "holy crap what the hell!!"  kind of way more of kind of a "ohh that's shockingly sad". But watch it it's very good.|`|P6fT0LBiaa	Its a great rags to riches story. I saw it the day before the Oscars for 5 dollars. Highly recommended!|`|XWC99fdFaa	I also thought the same thing you did.

If you have enough, it would take some time to set up, but equal time to pour them all out.<br>  <br>  3)  Take your friends cell phone and tape it under a chair, under a desk,or hide it somewhere safe and then start calling. Watch them try to find the phone. too funny!!<br>  <br>  4)  I used to pull pranks on friends in computer class all the time, but one of my strongest and most fun jokes to pull on people was simple and didn’t get me in too much trouble (most of the time).<br>  When you’re friend is away from their computer, just unplug the mouse from the back of the computer and wait for the entertainment.<br>  Typically you get to watch about 5 minutes of frustration before they figure out what’s wrong.

227b14cb2ec949a2ecdd4ba7068ff421aa	Well believe it or not there are company's that will pay you based on your knowledge of the rather than Height weight. It's true that taller thin handsome people probably get paid better. They're probably more successful in sales mostly because of looks. <br>  <br>  All that being said, there are things you can do to help yourself. First work on yourself, lose some weight, learn a skilled trade. Get a specialty license in a specific trade and become your own boss. I earned my Building Contractors license and went in business for myself. I'm not tall but yeah I have the looks and I'm successful for the most part. You can find a way if you work toward becoming who you want to be. Good Luck!
bZud91iuaa	I couldn't find anything on the acoustical guitar "Grand Prix" but found a couple of sites that talk about Galanti Grand Prix electrics.  One selling for around $2200.00. My suggestion is that you look on the internet for guitar historians or contact your local guitar shop for more info. depending on where you are located.  e-bay may also be a source.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped|`|UAHjJpC0aa	I haven't heard of them either<br>  <br>  over the years, there have been thousands of "distributers" that just buy guitars, from a manufacturer, <br>  like Samick, Saehan, Harmony, Danelectro, Kay, etc, <br>  and put their own name on it, and resell them.<br>  <br>  Sears did it starting back in the 1950's (Silvertone)<br>  Wards (Airline)<br>  <br>  there really are just few companies that make 90% of the guitars sold every year.<br>  (not counting all the EXCELLENT small builders around the country/world that hand build very specialty guitars)<br>  <br>  and it has always been that way.<br>  <br>  good luck on your search
ovDqPtg8aa	you really shoud talk to YOUR REAL DAD about coming to live with him. becasue your mom will not allow it. you need to leave or you will end up without a job! i feel horrible for you!<br>  just dnt tell your mom about it until the moving day comes. if you tell your dad what you just told us, he will for sure let you come live with him.|`|C2sZREuAaa	Seems like your having a hard time adjusting to your new family.<br>  <br>  I think you should speak with your guidance or school psychologist to help you figure out what you can do.  They deal with students with difficult times all the time.   If you feel your having a bad influence in your life please call social services.  They will investigate your family structure  <br>  <br>  I am sorry to hear about your issues at home.

This is not fair, and i would feel the exact same way as you. Were the pictures real? Like saved on her computer? If they were i would leave to go live with your dad. Your mom isnt treating you the way she should. If you feel safer, you should go live with your dad. And i would be upset if i saw those pictures. Go for it, tell them both how you feel. and if you want to, you can live with your dad. It seems like your 12? 11? 13? Talk with your dad about it. If you have any questions, you can contact me. on my profile. Good luck, and keep your head high!|`|dMBSE8ilaa	Troll? This can't be true<br>  <br>  Besides, why would you be looking at private pics on your mom's computer? Gross!!|`|y5FfKGAsaa	I'm so sorry this has been happening to you. Just hang in there, and I'm sure you'll get out fine, as long as you stay strong. Do you have family members who don't like your mother? If so, keep in contact with them. You'll never know when you'll need somebody to talk to about your current situation. If they do you any more harm, talk to your school counselor, teacher, or someone that you can trust. ASAP. Keep trying your best in school, no matter what. Try cooking, cleaning, and staying active to show your mom how it's done. <br>  <br>  It sucks that her new husband has been changing her, but there's nothing you can do to stop her from being with him. Try talking to her about it. If she doesn't listen, keep having faith that someday, things will work out -- and they will.<br>  <br>  Good luck! I wish you the best.<br>  ~|`|HH15Q6Cxaa	u need 2 **** yo step father up dude real talk|`|cbQIzvrHaa	You should talk to another family member or an adult or school counselor or just anyone you can trust for help.|`|nDEsGNrmaa	This sounds a little crazy and maybe a bit far-fetched.

Good luck, FYI: i live in FL, and have a rought life

KX9LehiOaa	put the tone and volume on your guitar all the way up, put the treble at about 3o' clock, the base on 12o' clock, and mid at 3o' clock and gain at 9o' clock, i don't have the same amp as you. i have a marshal mg50dfx. try that though, it might work.

Those are the releases that have been recently added. Each one may have many songs. In many cases, these releases were added in the last few hours or minutes. In fact, if you refresh it once in a while, you'll more that come up. <br>  <br>  The music world isn't as small as you think.

If they ever killed him off half the show would be gone and I probably wouldn't watch it anymore.|`|YyaKq8praa	I like Naruto, 'cause it's more animeish and has romance :D<br>  thanks x|`|X3dfHBGGaa	naruto,I didn't like dragon ball
aYNoQvfMaa	Early Modest Mouse, or the new sunshine, watered-down version?<br>  <br>  The old music is raw, and it's hard to find an analogue. Don Caballero, Faraquet, Japandi, RX Bandits, OXES, Tera Melos, and Sleeping People all have that same rawness in parts, but don't really sound like Modest Mouse at all.<br>  <br>  As for the new version of Modest Mouse I would assume most pop-rock bands sound like them, so, just turn on the radio.|`|FytCcZx7aa	Built to Spill<br>  Neutral Milk Hotel

While playing his ninja games, he meets a mysterious woman that reveals to Recca his past, his bond with the powerful Hokage clan, and the special flame power that resides within him. Meanwhile, the evil Kurei has plans to gather the madougu from the Hokage clan so that he may take control over the elemental powers, but Recca is determined to master his flame and stop Kurei’s evil plans. Does he have what it takes to live up to his own expectations and put a stop to Kurei himself? <br>  <br>  Yu Yu Hakusho<br>  Yusuke Urameshi was a normal middle school punk until he was hit andkilled by a car, while saving a child. His selfless action earned him theright to gain his life back and serve as a detective of the spiritworld, keeping the world of the living safe from a myriad of demons. But being reborn has its price: Yusuke must hatch a spirit beast that will develop according to his actions, and if he doesn't act in a good and honestmanner, it will eat his soul. Can Yusuke protect the human and spiritworlds and still manage to save himself in the process?<br>  <br>  Rurouni Kenshin<br>  In the revolutionary Meiji period, Japan is undergoing enormous political change. It is a time when vagabonds and terrorists will use any method to prevent the modernization of their country, even if it means trampling on the innocent in the process. In such a time, Himura Kenshin, a wandering samurai, has dedicated his life to protecting the weak and desperate peasants from those who would oppress them. However, Kenshin has a dark past which threatens to destroy the values he is fighting for. When he meets his new friends Kaoru, Sanosuke, and Yahiko, and tries to build a peaceful life with them, events conspire against him. Can Kenshin overcome the demons within and without, and finally ensure the peaceful future that Japan deserves?<br>  <br>  DNA2<br>  In the future, mankind faces a terrible dilemma: overpopulation! The origin of this epidemic has been traced to one young man named Junta who, in his time period, is destined to become the Mega-Playboy who fathers 100 children (though currently, he vomits uncontrollably whenever a woman gets near him!). Karin is a DNA Operator who has been sent back in time to put a stop to the budding playboy's hormones, but accidentally becomes the cause of his transformation! As if things couldn't get worse, is Karin actually... falling in love with Junta?!<br>  <br>  Claymore<br>  In times of olde, humans live in constant fear of demons known as yoma. These vicious creatures can take the appearance and memories of humans they have devoured, thus blending into society as they freely feast on human flesh. The key to stopping the yoma lies with the tolerated yet feared Claymores - women who are half-demon, half-human, and fully fated to become the demons that they hunt. Meanwhile, in a village, the young Raki has been banished; his only crime was losing his family to the yoma. Raki is drawn to a Claymore named Clare, and together their journey begins. While Clare fights the yoma plaguing the land, can Raki help her in her struggle to retain her humanity?|`|3337cc33a3e69c4d2e55dd53705aa778aa	u didnt like fma? omg well i would recommend:<br>  <br>  ACTION:                  <br>  bleach                                       <br>  naruto                      <br>  prince of tennis         <br>  <br>  LOGIC/STRATEGY:<br>  Code Geass    <br>  Death Note<br>  Hikaru no Go<br>  <br>  DRAMA?idk not really good with it but here are some popular ones:<br>  onegai teacher<br>  full moon-kinda a love story but not really...thats all i can think of lolz sry not good with love theme|`|7wVsKuQraa	full metal alchemist<br>  one piece<br>  air gear|`|CZWncknXaa	Try...<br>  <br>  Ghost in the Shell<br>  Samurai Champloo<br>  Cowboy Bebop<br>  Code Geass<br>  <br>  Any other specific details?|`|1K8NPRUOaa	try one of these:<br>  <br>  Code Gease<br>  Elfen Lied<br>  Bleach<br>  Death Note|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	You might like Clannad.

Too powerful to be let loose on the world, the magical Clow cards were sealed away long ago by their creator, Clow Reed. But all is not lost! For the guardian beast, Keroberos, was sealed along with the cards. Can Sakura, with the help of Keroberos, retrieve the cards before they wreak havoc on the town? <br>  <br>  InuYasha<br>  Kagome is a normal high school girl who falls into a well, transporting her back in time to the feudal era. Upon her arrival to this world, she mercifully unleashes Inuyasha, a half demon. As if this isn't enough, she also discovers that she is the bearer of the Shikon no Tama, a jewel of great spiritual power, a jewel which has just shattered into a million shards. Now, along with Miroku the priest, Sango the demon hunter, and Shippou the mischievious fox-demon, they must set out to find the Shikon shards and defeat the evils of the demon Naraku.<br>  <br>  Blood+<br>  In world where flesh-eating monsters roam the streets, only one organization has the means to save civilization from annihilation: Red Shield, a specially-organized unit designed to fight these monsters, and the only weapon that can destroy them: Saya.

Things change when Kenichi meets Furinji Miu, whose grandfather runs a dojo; and not knowing what he’s getting himself into, he signs up to become a disciple. As Kenichi’s life-threatening training continues and he becomes more and more powerful, he inadvertently becomes the target of the deadly gang called Ragnarok.

qLvhoRpsaa	I have millions so is hard to single just one out. <br>  <br>  I am pleased about something that happened on Friday afternoon. I had some banking to do. It turned out to be an International Banking nightmare. I was in that damn branch for over an hour and by the time I left, not only did they all look at me like I was a terrorist, but I was pretty spent on patience and warm fuzzies other humans. <br>  <br>  It is cold here. It was probably about 28 F and the winds have been really cold. I had managed to call the Taxi to pick me up and take me home but was now waiting outside of this horrible bank, filled with their horrible people, and there was a crowd of drunk 20 something's that were hanging around, openly drinking and just being a waste of space and rude. I was glad to see my taxi coming. I then noticed a girl, maybe 18 years old, sitting on the sidewalk, playing her acoustic guitar with her guitar case open. <br>  <br>  These guys were walking back and forth, getting right up in her space, saying stuff a man would not say to a young woman and were clearly starting to frighten her. Now I am less than 5 feet tall, 43, and have a lung disease, so I am not about to kick their butts, physically anyways. But this was not going to happen and me jump into a cab and drive away. <br>  <br>  I flagged my taxi driver over, threw him a $20 so he knew that I too was not a drunk and going to screw him out of a fare, and went into the crowd, said some stuff I shall not repeat here, asked her if she would like to get out of there, she did, and took her guitar case while she gathered the rest of her stuff and we slipped into the taxi. <br>  <br>  She kind of looked at me like perhaps I too was up to no good, but had the taxi take her down the road to a Starbuck's, gave her $10 and wished her well. Last I saw of her as I drove away was her, guitar case and backpack in hand, walking into the coffee shop for that hot chocolate I suggested. She gave me the a wave good bye. <br>  <br>  I hope that she understood that being a street busker is cool, but safety comes first. <br>  <br>  The fact this chick was playing for her supper in freezing temperatures on a cold sidewalk was appreciated by me. She was good too from the little I heard before she was bothered. <br>  <br>  I felt good and all was well in the world at that moment. It was a perfect 3 minutes of my crappy day. <br>  <br>  Peace:)|`|AA10053661	I have a best friend who was moving from town. He had a fabulous job opportunity and couldn't pass it up, but had mixed feelings about leaving his family and friends. One day he came and picked me up for one last day of fun. I had no idea he was as creative as he was. But what he did touched me beyond compare. He combined all the 'favorite things' we had ever done all scrunched up into one amazingly special day. It was perfect!<br>  <br>  We went running, to the lake, to our favorite grease fix restaurant, to hear our favorite band, and ended up skating on the hockey practice rink. It was THE most fun ever. It wasn't just because of the day..... but it was the perfect way to cement everything that had taken place in our friendship.

RS3fjNboaa	As soon as i read this question, I started laughing. When my son was young and I was trying to teach him to swing a bat, I thought it would be fun for him to whale on some potatoes so we took a whole sack of them to the park. We had a blast. he learned to swing and hit because he was having so much fun bashing those taters. LOL! Thanks for invoking a terrific memory!|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	no but along time ago when I was bad I smoked out of one, but I am a good girl now.|`|BTkHkkJTaa	no but this summer, be ready|`|m7BFxtBkaa	no but with water balloons|`|Uz1RzHzlaa	No, but we played with little pumpkins and also apples.|`|yJou1Ktmaa	no lol|`|iuWfp2fEaa	Why, yes, I have.

t9htoO50aa	I have been venting lately. Too much pressure lately to hold it.|`|AA11885973	I was sent to anger management and all it did was piss me off. It ain't worth the hassle, anymore.  I strongly believe suppressed anger is one of the reasons I drank. When I first got sober, I stopped holding it in, but like a typical newcomer, I didn't always vent it in healthy ways or places. When I learned that anger is based in fear, I inventoried and faced my fears and the anger doesn't have a leg to stand on.|`|bcf393e4db41afbc89350db8fced8a1aaa	dizz, I'm the best!!!  I, uh, hold it in---I guess.|`|80lWqRFiaa	I hold it in and then explode. I was told I am a volcano.

It wasn't really a love letter, it called me down to dirt(for example, the letter said "I love your ugly greasy hair." My hair is not greasy at all, the person that wrote it is a sick person that needs to get a life.). I pretended that the letter was a nice letter and a funny love letter, when I knew the truth. Also, The person that wrote the letter skips off school most of the time, and has a kid. I don't have anything against her for having a kid, but the fact that she skips off school frequently and does stuff like write fake "love letters" for April Fool's jokes shows me that she needs help. She is obviously not as mature or sensible as one would think.|`|eDySIDPQaa	I don't [pretend about anything, if I have something to say, I am gonna tell you right off the word get go, why hold back, say your peace and get it over with and move on.<br>  <br>  Holding anger in or frustration can take a toll on your heart and overall health....get it out in the open and clear the air right then and there.<br>  <br>  I am a Red Head and Scorpio, nope we do not hold it in...LOL|`|147b4a346dd471babe83771bba6a0923aa	Hi, Dizz!<br>  For the most part, I'm passive/ agressive all the way.<br>  It depends on a lot of things... Face to face, I'm much<br>   more apt to say what I think when I think it.<br>  On line -it's hard to tell, so I try to wait until I'm sure...<br>  Also, if it's someone really dear to me, I let a lot of stuff  go...<br>  Until it;s "one too many"... };>|`|yiBSvLf8aa	I'm good at pretending to be a bunny rabbit! :o) ... does that count?<br>  <br>  “I refuse to answer that question on the grounds that I don't know the answer."<br>   -- Douglas Adams quotes (British comic Writer, 1952-2001)<br>  <br>  "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing." <br>  -- Socrates|`|iQOqj2KVaa	I am a good pretender when it come to my kids = ).

Since its a school project and not probably not something that you would be doing for profit on a large scale it shouldn't be an issue.<br>  <br>  Edit: If you are doing this for profit on a large scale then the safest thing to do would be to contact the copyright holder for permission. Copyright law is very ambiguous and hard to interpret so its best to be on the safe side and make sure that you're not going to get sued.

Most of these songs are more happy and upbeat.  A few have harder songs at the end of the CD like the last few songs in Euphoria: Hardcore Disk 3.  Hardcore Nation albums have a little more bass in them I think, you'll probably like the song "X-Rated" off Nardcore Nation 1 Disk 3.<br>  You might also like "The C Commander" by Hixxy off the album Clubland X-treme Hardcore4 Disk 3<br>  <br>  Scooter makes a few good songs, 'Fire" is pretty good.  He's in the genre of Hardstyle.

g7uMKvEzaa	If it is still here, I probably will...myol  habits are far too hard to break.<br>  I just reached level 7 yesterday and sort of find it not as much a quest to get to a better place..since they don't have a level 8 as of now...I guess there is something about being on top .It is a contest and a quest..But , I still come here mostley to keep myself occupied and out of trouble with spare time..I shop so much less and I don't chat anymore..So this is a good place for me..I also learned alot here over the yrs.I haven't got bored yet ever. <br>  Hopefully by then, I will have some grandkids to play with and keep me busy..|`|2c4e6005843e2624086af284a2e71120aa	In five years I hope to be moved away and successful. I -might- still come around.|`|rTtQnw4Baa	Maybe...I usually search things I find interesting so I'll probably stop by...|`|PDB2YbA4aa	The place would be trolled completely by then.

TlcMyJeuaa	That one bald guy used too much relaxer on his new hair, and it caught on fire.  It was pretty much the most dramatic episode I've ever seen.  Dr. Bosley kept saying to him that he could give him new hair again, but he kept shaking his head no behind the guy's back.|`|MwSaCettaa	LOL<br>  <br>  When my ex & I split up I called Bosley & had them send him a free video package and I also conveniently gave his ph #, too!! I just HAD to!!!<br>  <br>  ???|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	I usually record it for later viewing.|`|B6BUR6zJaa	LOL!!!<br>  <br>  Thank you...I needed that.|`|0USM8JG1aa	Oh man, they were asking if you wanted to call this number and get your hair back|`|mvotlqL9aa	then,no offense, but you suck|`|D4XWrwuaaa	No, I missed the entire thing.<br>  <br>  I am still surprised Bosley went from Charlie's Angels to being a hair doctor though!|`|KQJPWWjeaa	Oh, that guy walked off the set and his wig fell off.

uE6o9pF0aa	Depends on the laws there.  Where I live a college professor cannot even have sex with a student.<br>  .........................................|`|4sW8MFxCaa	that happened in my school too<br>  but the student was 17 so it was considered rape<br>  she's in jail i think|`|76f188939b997c72ffed710f70520cdaaa	No, they're legal, but it's prohibited to have sex with a student anyway. Even in colleges with students and professors.|`|sfUUml0Daa	no its illegal.|`|apUkTo3maa	NOPE|`|HwfYEQUOaa	Probably. You hear about it all the time. Depends on what state and how much of a background check they do.|`|dqCTS60raa	I don't think so|`|Zj9viuGAaa	WOW at how many school ddoes this happen . . at my school an guy in my year (18 at the the time) was having sex with the maths teacher . . . I really want to spice this up by saying she was really old or a guy, but the teacher, she was only 25.<br>  She didn't get fired, just suspended for a while. I think they are still together! Fun how love finds people|`|tLVZXLRSaa	I think there's something in the contract about not having sex with a student even if she is legal.|`|l9IGytB0aa	He could get a job at a different school,<br>  only because she i eighteen and no longer a minor.|`|kdlWcH3zaa	Yes*. 18 is considered an adult.|`|MxO4vMtraa	EWWWW<br>  <br>  I DON'T think it's legal|`|MuPxWmJhaa	why would he go to jail if she is 18...?....|`|xYLnLCVVaa	well what he did was not right, but the girl was 18, which is legal. i am not sure.|`|pGtZVaMPaa	I'm pretty sure he can. Legally the student is considered an adult, so they didn't break the law. He was only fired from his job at your school for breaking policy by sleeping with a student. Anyway, aside from the teacher losing his job, and most likely both of them damaging their reputations to some degree, everything else should be fine. He might have some trouble finding another job as a teacher because of what they did, and how people are going to take that into account when they consider hiring him, but he should still be able to find another job. I hope they can both look back on what they did and feel it was worth it though.|`|PUP3hK5uaa	It is legal, it's not like she was 14, 18 year old people can vote, join the military, etc. so they are adults. he'll be fine.

Never in your life have u heard somone overdose on pot. If u take 12 Tyenols...that will be the last headache u ever have. You cant get addicted to pot also. Ive never smoked pot but logically if u think about it, pot should be legal|`|sNoRTobUaa	according to me cigarette and alcohol companies are paying hefty amount of dough to the government to stop the legalization of marijuana....<br>  the base line is <br>  "why to drink and die when you can dope and fly"<br>  vote for marijuana.............|`|CU3hW5iRaa	well my problem isn't with pot it's about not wanting to support some scummy dealers.  like my town is weird.  and no one respects anyone<br>  <br>  and i know what's happening<br>  <br>  and stuff<br>  <br>  but this is different.  like some people didn't respect me when i decided to quit because i was going skitso from it<br>  <br>  and that's just too much.  like if you're like that you're way out of reach|`|x3uCecWsaa	I agree with you,everything in moderation.Its like alcohol,just because you enjoy one or two, doesn't make you an alcoholic.|`|crBmcntyaa	Your kidding yourself if you think its harmless. Just better be sure that you're not the one that harms any of my friends or family because of it........<br>  <br>  Ive seen first hand many variant consequences. so dont tell me its no big deal|`|RrKED6b2aa	this is just a rant. ask a REAL question! =/ x|`|U4dHE6Kwaa	because it ***** with your mind paranoia etc<br>  when i used to soke it we used to try and make people paranoid now i realise how mean that is and how it can seriously **** with ur head especially if you get in a bad buzz|`|9Igo15ZPaa	Im not against or for the legalization of it, just way too controversial|`|0USM8JG1aa	who knows|`|t4BpFdmdaa	P-O-T SPELLS POT.

Its better than other drugs & even liquor.<br>  They should legalize it (;|`|s7UWLOS9aa	So many reasons why pot is bad...<br>  a) It kills your brain cells.<br>  b) You can get Lung Cancer from it.<br>  c) You can become addicted to it.<br>  d) People call it the 'gateway drug,' as it opens you up to a whole new world of drugs.<br>  e) If you use it long enough, it WILL turn you into a full-blown addict.<br>  <br>  Exactly! You can get addicted to anything. And yes, a lot of things higher the risk of Lung Cancer, and that is one of the risks. And maybe you haven't turned into an addict, but a lot of other people have. Example: My sister. She ended up smoking this evil drug and soon, she realized that it wasn't good enough for her, so she decided to use a drug that made her more high. And the same thing happened again and again. And eventually she overdosed on heroin and almost died. Same thing for my cousin, and he's dead now, because of it. All it takes is ONE puff of it. Does this answer your question?<br>  <br>  Yes, they do. They use it for cancer patients and such, BUT most people tend to abuse this stuff.<br>  <br>  I understand that it doesn't happen to everyone, but do you get what I'm trying to say? It does effect a lot of people in a lot of ways! if we made this drug legal, I can grantee death rates will go up. Also, I'm not saying that you can't smake the thing at all, but once in a while.

toM0EXNgaa	I went to there WYLMITE tour:<br>  <br>  1. 8:00-11:15<br>  <br>  2. Be there 3 hours earlier. I got there when the opening act was paying and regretted it.<br>  <br>  3. It's okay look for some perky outgoing people next to you and hang with them.|`|pBpZAk2uaa	1. Jonas Brothers concerts are like 2 hours long but that is without the opening act. so i would say close to 2 and a half hours.<br>  <br>  2. We were there a good like 5 hours before but we also went to Summer fest. I would say a good hour and a half, because outside the ticket place where they check your tickets they start gathering around an hour and a half before.<br>  <br>  3. I don't know. I think she should at east have a friend go with her so then she has someone to scream with. Either a friend or adult should go just to be sure she is okay.|`|x1ET3REFaa	the concerts is not to long and not to short. if you go i am telling you ;you will love it: the concerts are awesome. i will say go way before the concert because it will be a long line because it is alot of fans of the jonas bros. if i was your mother i will trust you to go by yourself if you are 13. form your in the teens and i hope i am best answer|`|ViEgekyIaa	No, but you'd probably have to get there an hour and a half early (or earlier depending on the size of the venture) and I wouldn't recomend a 13 yo going alone:<br>  <br>  most parents go with them, consider it bonding, lol.<br>  <br>  It's probably about 2-3 hours long like a regular concert.|`|nzcEbjhzaa	The one that I went to was somewhere from 1 1/2 hours to 2 1/2 hours long.<br>  My best friend and I got there 4 hours before and there were a bunch of girls there so get there, if you can, at least 5 hours before!<br>  I suggest not to go by yourself, I am 13 myself and I was freaked out by all the crowds and people, so I suggest you go with a friend or a parent!<br>  Hope that helps!!|`|KMcjfeX7aa	I'll answer even though i havent gone...but my friend has...<br>  <br>  1) i'd guess hour/half hour/two hours<br>  <br>  2) i'd say alot!! no, be there like two or one. <br>  <br>  3) No, always take a parent or adult.|`|UHUw5zS2aa	no but i love them|`|kGDdqTylaa	no, but they should be good. my daughters love them|`|bmwR7RdMaa	don't waste your money on talentless concerts.....<br>  they emit UV radiation that can poison young girls minds....|`|tae4IGumaa	1. about 2.5 to 3 hours<br>  <br>  2. if its outdoors and you have lawn, about 3 to get good seat. If its a normal indoor concerts and you have your seats, maybe 1<br>  <br>  3. you should go with a friend. But yea, a 13 year old could go alone|`|Z2lRv9TRaa	1. The shows are normally like 1 hr 45 minutes or so, NOT including the opening performances... (demi lovato, honor society, etc).<br>  <br>  2. If you're goin to a show where you already have ur tickets, it doesn't matter but i would recomend a little while earlier... maybe 2 hours or so? like if it starts at 6 get there at like 4 or 4:30... u wanna try to beat the crowds as much as possible! especially in a big place.<br>  <br>  3. well, i would recommend going with a friend or parent... it's pretty crowded and the venues are usually HUGE... it's insane.<br>  <br>  Hope you have funnn!! seriously they put on a CRAZY show...!!<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|VrPTLsecaa	1. Too long<br>  2. three weeks (Ya. Sad.)<br>  3. No. You should go see someone good.|`|ZUD25nA3aa	DON'T GO!! PLEASE!!|`|sJNoTGQVaa	I'm still living, right?<br>  so the answer is no

So just pick up anything and randomely strum it and scream LOUD!!!!!|`|PxuZBDGxaa	Get any crappy guitar and poison up the badboy with some nice pickups, that's all!<br>  And if you got chash to spare, a nice set of pedals would add a killer sound.<br>  But really, Anything Ibanez with a low action is great to pull off some awesome licks.<br>  Good luck!|`|n8OVRhs7aa	epiphone sg<br>  if your price was a little higher, i would say gibson sg|`|qgYGLbCraa	a gibson les paul strut ephiphone mcfee

fQEn8PCHaa	I was 20 (I think that's fairly young, but not a teen thankfully) and I had an abortion because my fiance and I were not able to support a child financially or emotionally. We also were not willing to pawn off our responsibility on someone else such as our parents or someone who might adopt. We also didn't want to give our child away and possibly never know them.<br>  <br>  As for what happened, I was not far along, only a couple weeks. I went to a private clinic and had a medical abortion (the RU486 pill). Essentially with this, a miscarriage was induced. It was definitely an awful experience and quite expensive, but I know we made the right decision for everybody, including our future children.<br>  <br>  Ideally, if we could all have affordable/effective contraception (which was my problem) abortion would not be an issue, but unfortunately birth control is quite expensive and abortions even more so. If we all wonder why there are urban "ghettos" and so many problems within large, poor families a lot of it has to do with inadequate family planning.<br>  <br>  This may seem weird that I am willing to share this, but I have ALWAYS been pro-choice and when I found my self in this situation I used my right to choose and decided to not be ashamed about it. Though, it's only when I experienced this situation personally that I knew just what it meant to have this right and how deeply important it is.|`|ntb2rNXcaa	this girl in my math class talked about her teen pregnancy. she was really loud about it. she got an abortion. all she did was talk about how her mom was this and her mom was that and never even seemed to care that there was a baby involved. it was like all she cared was that her mom was pissed. she was 16 i think. its really sad and listing to her was upsetting. she had the wrong attitude about the situation and if i was her and had got into that situation i would have had the baby. and if i couldn't give it a good life i would give it up for adoption. it would be the hardest thing to do but i feel like i would have to give my baby the best chance at a good life.|`|sq9AtIRHaa	Yes..I kept him and he is now 1 years old.

WpA7n8Iwaa	it's impossible to always have nice breath, but one thing people overlook is drinking a lot of water and swishing it around.  It's keeps the bad stuff from building up.  Other than that, floss and if you don't have a tongue scraper, you should get one.  A lot of bad breath germs reside on the tongue and they need to be scraped off.|`|BdlGBdE5aa	You are so observant.  The correct answer to your question is found in knowing what really causes bad breath.  Up to 90 % of bad breath comes from bacteria that grow on the top of your tongue and produce the bad smells.  This bacteria can often be seen as white stuff on the tongue, especially in the back of the tongue.  This must be removed to cure bad breath. I use an OraBrush because it is both a brush and a scraper.  It really gets to the back of the tongue to remove the white stuff.  Brush and floss the teeth and then clean the tongue.  You will really notice a great difference.  Twice a day should do it.<br>  Here is the website if you are interested: <a href="http://www.orabrush.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com</a>|`|6ZmiuwWDaa	Do you smoke by any chance?<br>  <br>  You obviously have bad oral hygiene.<br>  Forget the teeth, it is your mouth you need to deal with.<br>  If your breath always smells bad, it is quite worrying.<br>  It could merely be something you ate, or if you smoke...<br>  Disgusting, sorry, but I can't stand it, it is insulting, sitting next to a  person with bad breath is like sitting next to a sewer grating on the wall.  Smoking is disgusting, and I actually hate people that smoke, personally. People whom smoke with the smoking attitude (The typical "cool" smoking attitude) will get an automatic 5% charm taken off before I even meet the person.|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Brush your tongue, floss between teeth with anti-bacterial floss, and chew sugar-free chewing gum, and mints.|`|ztzL7ntwaa	I just heard this the other day. They say there is a relatively simple surgery to stop bad breath. Maybe check this out with your doctor~~~|`|QuokZhuqaa	Get mints(;<br>  Brush your teeth OFTEN!<br>  Mouthwash. (:<br>  Saltwater.|`|8LISL0LOaa	Watch your consumption of foods such as alcohol, coffee (both caffeinated and decaffeinated), dense proteins (such as those found in dairy and meat products), garlic and onions, and sugars. These are all bad-breath offenders.<br>  <br>  Try to breathe through your nose. Breathing through your mouth can lead to having a dry mouth, which creates a breeding ground for odor-causing bacteria.<br>  <br>  Keep a regular log of your eating habits and medications, as these can cause bad breath. Share the log with your dentist.<br>  <br>  Brush your teeth and tongue twice a day to remove food particles and plaque, and floss between teeth once a day, preferably in the evening after you eat.<br>  <br>  Try using a fluoride mouth rinse with antiseptic ingredients and a pleasant mint flavor. This helps to protect your teeth, and the flavor masks odor problems.<br>  <br>  Consider internal breath fresheners'such as over-the-counter pills you take before or after a meal to aid the prevention of malodorous breath'or go the natural route and munch on some parsley after a meal.|`|PhwIltQFaa	This problem is not uncommon not all mouthwashes are suitable for what you have in mind they merely disguise the problem  short term as you have already found out.<br>  My suggestion would be to go here <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Halitosis-Can-be-Cured" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/Halitosis-Can-be...</a> and there you can grab yourself a copy of "Bad Breath Bible" for FREE this will give you all the information your require.

An Asian-American kid with a Run-DMC T-shirt, before they were mainstream. <br>  Now, it did affect my identity a little bit, but still I'm aware I'm Asian-American and I know and study my culture. But I just saw an injustice in America that black artists weren't getting their do in the arts. White artists would "steal" their styles and make mints, while the black originators would be poor, or sell less, because whites wouldn't buy black music by black artists.<br>  So, anyway, if your obsession with whites is indeed an obsession, it could be unhealthy.<br>  If you desire to be white, that could be bad. I know friends who long to be white, and they grow to hate who they are.<br>  As much as I like black music, I still know who I am, and I don't believe myself to be black, nor do I want to be. I don't deny my heritage, I also like Japanese actors, artists, culture, etc., and I stand up for them.|`|qwInrvUGaa	i don't see whats wrong with liking people your family is weird for thinking you are weird for liking people|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	There's nothing wrong with this.

And I still do love those things. I'm a real girly girl. But as I've matured I've come to recognise the superficiality of the celeb world and I don't want to be a part of that!<br>  <br>  I'd much rather do something with more substance. My ideal profession would be a counselling psychologist or a writer. Or both. But I'm currently doing voluntary work in my community as well. <br>  <br>  As My Chemical Romance's song Skylines and Turnstiles states; <br>  'If the world needs something better lets give them one more reason now'. <br>  <br>  When I turn 18 (2 years time) I want to do a thing called 'Vinspired' because my ethos is to serve those less fortunate than myself before I serve myself.

Thats just low.  I don't even know this guy and he makes me ahsamed to be a Gemini.  =/<br>  <br>  As for the main question, I believe (or want to believe) that we are good people.  Just because a guy did that to you doesn't mean that all of us are liars, cheats, and thieves.<br>  <br>  Again, I'm sorry you went through what you did, no one deserves that.|`|b17a48df36c34a162276766c7b3fa8b0aa	Just delete the "gemini" and you have a real question|`|OHfcGAgIaa	no you're just a mug. do you enjoy being treated like s***?|`|ILdFmUfUaa	Hey hun,<br>  I was with a Gemini for almost a year (on and off). we started out just hooking up and having fun and then it lead to him saying he had feelings so I took him seriousely (being a libra girl). Long story short, he never fell through wtih his word : everytime he said he cared for me and I took it further by saying lets go out to the movies or tried to make it official in someway - he denied that he had feelings and would always be hot n cold. To add insult to injury he's now dating a girl who's much younger for about 8 months and say's he's in love and has made it public and official. The point is that Gemini's are shady -esp the men - they never act on the truth and they're always pining to be the center of attention and get what THEY want at the cost of others until others catch on. Your best bet would be to completely ignore him! I mean that - the minute I let go completely he was after me and my friendship - generally he's like i miss you - but I still ignore him<br>  Bottom line: if he's willing to do those things to you hun you don't need that in your life and are better off letting him go and moving on to another star sign ;) xxxx|`|GvgmSxdCaa	Don't generalise ...|`|Pew3CdCjaa	yes<br>  I never trust gemini guys because I saw them cheating on somebody too easily. and also they are biggest liar ever<br>  so watch out girl...

It's battered person syndrome, a physical and psychological condition.<br>  ICD9 code 995.81 [1] shows the syndrome as including "battered person/man/spouse syndrome NEC" and any person presenting with identified physical descriptors rather than psychological descriptors falls under the general heading of "Adult physical abuse", classified under "Injury and Poisoning" [2]. In lay terms, this is a reference to any person who, because of constant and severe domestic violence usually involving physical abuse by a partner, becomes depressed and unable to take any independent action that would allow him or her to escape the abuse. The condition explains why abused people often do not seek assistance from others, fight their abuser, or leave the abusive situation. Sufferers have low self-esteem, and often believe that the abuse is their fault. Such persons usually refuse to press criminal charges against their abuser, and refuse all offers of help, often becoming aggressive or abusive to others who attempt to offer assistance. Often sufferers will even seek out their very abuser for comfort shortly after an incident of abuse.|`|AA10898914	Yeah!
