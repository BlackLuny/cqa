Nothing special about it.  It has high miles.  When I am in park and hit the brakes it sounds like it is reving up.  But when I am comming to a stoplight and I have to stop fast, the motor will shut off, all the other power stays on. If I come to a slow stop, nothing will happen.  It is only when I am stopping fats that it shuts off, and I have to put it into neutral and restart it. When it does die, there is no funny sounds, it just silently shuts off.  I have heard it could be possible brake booster, or tcc converter, but I have no idea.  Anyone have any ideas of where I should start first?  Or what it would be and how much it would cost.

The bank re-did the loan and released the lien so I could get rid of the car. They made the loan balance into a personal loan. I am unemployed so I am behind on the loan but still paying it. I got a letter from the bank saying if you do not pay in full they will reposes the car! I called the idiot woman and she said this was an error on her part and that she knows that there is no car. So, after clarifying this I am still worried that these screwballs are unorganized and they could send somebody to repossess the car. Which could be extremely embarrassing let alone if I could not produce the car I could go to jail or who knows. What do you guys think, have I done enough?

I was just curious.  What happened was my mechanic told me my car had leaks (oil, transmission, and on top of that Chrysler 2.7 engine on the verge of another water pump blowup) and told me to start looking (trade in and get another) and I've been looking around for the cars but hadn't done it yet. Well I finally set my eyes on a car I like and  today I was gonna go and do it  but then leaving for work, my transmission wouldn't change gears so essentially I'm screwed. I had to get a ride to work and figure out what to do with this. I'll just have to buy a car without trade in I guess, but my original question was, if I had bought my car and traded this in say yesterday and it broke down at the dealer, would I still be screwed no matter, or I have been disavowed all responsibility since the deal was done?

20090226112129AABsd8p	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Car with no tax, was transported to my home and unloaded onto a grass verge , it was clamped, Highway or not?	On the 21/02/09 i purchased a car from a friend, a Vauxhall Corsa with 8 months MOT but no Tax, as agreed the car was to be transported to my house on Monday the 23/02/09, the car turned up at around 08.10 the car was unloaded outside my house onto a grass verge off the road, i paid for the car, collected the documents (Logbook & MOT) and with my insurance policy left to get the Tax. i bought the Tax at 09.09, arrived home at 09.30 to find the car had been Clamped, the time on the document said 08.36, I rang, I pleaded i told them what had happened and they could'nt give a Damm, I feel Bullied & Robbed, They have Stopped me in the street and Mugged me, all they could say was that it is illegal to have a untaxed vehicle on the public highway, Well it was not on the Public Highway, it was on a grass verge outside my Home, according to tthe legal experts "the Public Highway" is a Road that is paid for by the public (road-tax) the grass verge is not a road, i have witness's, my neighbour is a Police Officer, and many other people that saw the car being unloaded.... The Wheel Clamping Division of the DVLA are Horrible, Nasty, Robbing, Money Grabbing People, They have labelled me as a Tax evader...........

20090226113028AAsoTPA	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Car accident and need some answers?	My husband and I were in a car accident about 2 weeks ago, we were stopped at a red light in a busy intersection of town. The man that hit us had been driving down the road before the accident, was under the influence of alcohol and blew threw the red light and hit us head on at 50 mph in a 35 zone. My car was totaled instantly and we were rushed to the hospital. I received a broken ankle and can't walk for a month and a half. My husband got a sprained ankle and tore his knee up pretty bad. I was released back to work after a week and a half of sitting at home, but my husband hasn't been yet because they don't know exactly what is wrong with his injury. In the mean time he is the main contributor of the household and he's going on three weeks of no work. We're not sure what to do because were not getting any money from the man that hit us because he is an illegal and has no insurance. We may be getting money back from our insurance company but that wont come in time to pay rent and all the bills. So now that you know the story here's my question; is there any other way we can get money back for our lost wages before we lose our house and everything we've worked for?
20090226113238AAxR74H	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Minor car accident what to do???PLease help ASAP?	Okay I was in a 3 car accident 2 days ago. Me and another car behind me was at the light waiting for it to turn green, and a mini truck can behind and the car behind me twice which caused them to hit me once. He hit me pretty hard but it's only a dent in my bumper. (the insurance company said buick's are strong cars) my neck went back and forth twice and i started cyring because i was in shock. I didnt get out the car, both of the men got out of theirs, and asked me was i alright, did they need to call an abulance, and I said no i'm okay i was still in shock. i had a very small paon in my neck at the time so i was holding my neck so i got a police report and drove straight to the emergency room and the doctor told me that I had whip lash. when i got to the hospital it was only hurting on one side and a small pain that ran down my arm. so he gave me a perscrition and told me to follow up with a family practice he preferred in a week. I woke up the next morning and had a very bad headache along with my neck hurting in the back and on the side. I made a claim with both insurance companies and the person who caused the accidents insurance company told me they would only pay for my damage to my car and my first hospital visit which was the emergency room, because i was a minor car accident and the guy behind me was hit worse than me and he was okay. But i told him he was driving a big van and my car was in front of his he the guy hit him so hard my car kept his form jerking so much. but now when i sit in the car i have to sit a certain way because my neck feels uncomfortable and i toss and turn at night because it hurts. I told the inssurance guy what if i had to go back to the doctor for pains and he said they would not cover that. I dont think it's right because i did not ask to be hit, now my neck has to suffer from something i did not cause. the insurnace guy was not in the car when i got hit and he dont know what impact it had on me. What should i do, the doctor told me it doesn't matter how major or minor the accident is you should take them all serious.

20090226124048AAJkSNq	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	How much would I get for a 2005 Dodge Neon at an auction?	I just got laid off from my job because I'm pregnant (which I'm already pursuing legal action) and can't make my car payments. I've talked to the car company and they said if they "voluntarily repossess" my car, they sell the car at an auction and I owe the rest to them.      Its a black 2005 Dodge Neon SE, 4-DR Automatic in good condition. I just got new tires and a complete tune-up. There is about 66000 miles on the car and I owe them about $8000.      Please let me know if you have any options for refinancing, too, because I really can't let this kill my credit! Thanks!

20090226125437AAUqcRv	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Chrysler	What is the "clunking" noise on my 1994 Plymouth Sundance every time I hit a small bump in the road?	It's 4DR, 2.2L, 5-Speed, with a 100,000 Miles.  I have had new struts, strut mounts, motor mounts, installed and I still can't figure it out.  The garages I've took it to said the ball joints, tie rods, and everything else, are tight and they can't see where it would be coming from.  It's sounds to me, like a ball joint clunk, if you know what I mean.  I've looked every where underneath and I can't figure it out!!!  If you turn the steering wheel back and forth real quick when your driving, you can hear it clunk also.
