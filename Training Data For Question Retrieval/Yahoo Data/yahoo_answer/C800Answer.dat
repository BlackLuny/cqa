Some of them do dinner and the play.<br>  <br>  6.  Dinner on a train or boat.  If there is a river near you or a old time railroad, they might offer this.  Sometimes they even do murder mystery dinners where you watch them act it out and try to figure out who did it.<br>  <br>  7.  Amusement park<br>  <br>  8.  Local natural history museum/aquarium.<br>  <br>  9.  If you have a local lake that has a boat rental, you could canoe out on the lake and have a picnic.<br>  <br>  10.

Most producers of Louisiana hot sauce pride themselves on making a product which is “not too hot, not too mild,” in the words of Bruce Foods, a famous producer of this style of hot sauce. There are numerous uses for this moderately hot condiment, and it is famously included in many Cajun and Creole dishes; it is also a feature of the classic Bloody Mary, a cocktail which blends tomato juice, clam juice, vodka, and Louisiana style hot sauce for a fiery kick.<br>  <br>  Both cayenne and tabasco peppers can be used to produce Louisiana hot sauce. Some famous brands include the Original Louisiana Style Hot Sauce, Tabasco, Crystal, and Frank's Red Hot. Sauces made with tabasco peppers such as the eponymous Tabasco sauce tend to be more peppery, while cayenne-based sauces can be more gentle. Many of these producers continue to make Louisiana hot sauce in the state that it is named for; Tabasco, for example, is still made on Avery Island, Louisiana, where some of the peppers for the famous sauce are grown.<br>  <br>  Numerous markets across the United States sell at least one brand of Louisiana hot sauce, while stores in the Southern United States often carry an assortment. Louisiana hot sauce is also a ubiquitous condiment across the United States in places like diners, where it may be set out on the table along with salt, pepper, ketchup, and sweeteners. Many consumers have a preference for a specific brand, as different companies use slightly different formulas which have unique flavors and levels of spiciness.<br>  <br>  In most cases, Louisiana hot sauce is actually fermented and aged for up to three years in casks with vinegar and salt as a preservative. The aging creates a distinctive hint of fermentation in the flavor which some consumers enjoy. By tradition, other ingredients are not added to Louisiana hot sauce, as these would obscure the heat of the peppers and the natural flavor of the sauce. Some companies do make variants with other types of peppers or ingredients like chipotle peppers, which are slowly smoked to yield a very unique flavor.<br>  <br>  Although Louisiana hot sauce is generally mild, some varieties do carry a kick. For people who are not used to hot sauces, it can seem unbearably hot. If you find yourself with a mouthful of hot sauce which is too much for you to handle, squeeze some lemon juice into your mouth. The acid of the lemon juice will neutralize the basic capsaicin of the chili peppers, calming the reaction and soothing your mouth.<br>  <br>  Louisiana Hot Pepper Sauce<br>  3 cups distilled white vinegar <br>  2 teaspoons salt <br>  2 pounds cayenne or jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped <br>  <br>  Simmer vinegar, salt and peppers for 5 to 10 minutes.<br>  Process in food processor or blender.

ttfuh5pKaa	Hi -<br>  <br>  I believe this is what you are looking for along with the link for the recipes of the sauces.  Hope this helps you!<br>  <br>  According to the ultimate cooking reference book, The New Food Lover's Companion, by Sharon Tyler Herbst, the French are credited with refining the sophisticated art of sauce-making. The development of various sauces over the years stems from the 19th-century French chef Antonin Carême who evolved an intricate methodology by which hundreds of sauces were classified under one of five "mother sauces." Those basic sauces are the white sauce Béchamel, the light stock-based Velouté, the brown stock-based Espagnole; the two basic emulsified sauces, Hollandaise and Mayonnaise; and the oil and vinegar-based Vinaigrette.<br>  <br>  (Tomato is considered to be among the 5 mother sauces, however, it actually came about later...although it certainly has earned the title since it is the base for a large variety of sauces in today's cookery.)<br>  <br>  The method for preparing the various types of sauces incorporates some of the same techniques. For example, a roux is basic to many of the white and brown sauces. This cooked mixture of flour and fat (usually butter) is an important contribution to the sauce-making art. In addition, these classic sauces have been joined by a plethora of modern-day sauces such as sweet dessert sauces, tomato, pesto and barbecue sauces, as well as a wide variety of gravies.<br>  <br>  Always remember that when a sauce is used on a food, it is the first thing to touch the tongue. A sauce is only as good as the ingredients you put into it and the care you take while preparing it. On the other hand, a good sauce does little to make inferior food taste better. Always put a good sauce on good food. Thankfully, we no longer use sauce to mask "off-tasting food" as was once the practice in times before modern refrigeration!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  DEFINING THE FIVE MOTHER SAUCES<br>  <br>  Béchamel, the classic white sauce, was named after its inventor, Louis XIV's steward Louis de Béchamel. The king of all sauces, it is often referred to as a cream sauce because of its appearance and is probably used most frequently in all types of dishes. Made by stirring milk into a butter-flour roux, the thickness of the sauce depends on the proportion of flour and butter to milk. The proportions for a thin sauce would be 1 tablespoon each of butter and flour per 1 cup of milk; a medium sauce would use 2 tablespoons each of butter and flour; a thick sauce, 3 tablespoons each. <br>  <br>  Velouté is a stock-based white sauce. It can be made from chicken, veal or fish stock. Enrichments such as egg yolks or cream are sometimes also added. <br>  <br>  Espagnole, or brown sauce, is traditionally made of a rich meat stock, a mirepoix of browned vegetables (most often a mixture of diced onion, carrots and celery), a nicely browned roux, herbs and sometimes tomato paste.<br>  <br>  Hollandaise and Mayonnaise are two sauces that are made with an emulsion of egg yolks and fat. Hollandaise is made with butter, egg yolks and lemon juice, usually in a double boiler to prevent overheating, and served warm. It is generally used to embellish vegetables, fish and egg dishes, such as the classic Eggs Benedict. Mayonnaise is a thick, creamy dressing that's an emulsion of vegetable oil, egg yolks, lemon juice or vinegar and seasonings. It is widely used as a spread, a dressing and as a sauce. It's also used as the base for such mixtures as Tartar Sauce, Thousand Island Dressing, A?oli, and Remoulade.<br>  <br>  Vinagrette is a sauce made of a simple blend of oil, vinegar, salt and pepper (usually 3 parts oil to 1 part vinegar). More elaborate variations can include any combination of spices, herbs, shallots, onions, mustard, etc. It is generally used to dress salad greens and other cold vegetable, meat or fish dishes.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  TIPS FOR SAUCE SUCCESS<br>  <br>  Constantly stir roux-thickened sauces while cooking to prevent lumps. If you must leave the sauce for a few seconds, set the pan off the heat during that time. <br>  <br>  If a roux-thickened sauce develops a few lumps, beat them out with a rotary beater or wire whisk. As a last resort, strain sauce with sieve to remove lumps. <br>  <br>  Cook egg-thickened sauces over low heat, or cook these sauces in the top of a double boiler over hot, not boiling, water. Always temper (warm) the egg yolks before adding them to the sauce by first stirring in a little of the hot sauce mixture into them. Then add to the remainder of the sauce mixture. Never let a sauce boil after the egg yolks are added as the sauce may curdle.<br>  <br>  Don't let water boil in the bottom of the double boiler if you use it to make egg-thickened sauces. Also, be sure that the water doesn't touch the bottom of the pan holding the sauce. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Basic Bechamel (White Sauce) with Variations<br>  Basic Velouté Sauce with Variations<br>  Basic Espagnole (Brown Sauce) with Variations<br>  Basic Mayonnaise with Variations and Basic Hollandaise with Variations<br>  Basic Vinaigrette with Variations<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm includ|`|56VRs1GFaa	Béchamel (white sauce)<br>  Velouté (based on stock)<br>  Espagnole (Brown stock based)<br>  Hollandaise (emulsified)<br>  Vinaigrette (oil & Vinegar)|`|DHiqm9Ojaa	mother sauces?!
ttfuh5pKaa	Hi -<br>  <br>  Try this one!<br>  <br>  Mayan Hot Cocoa Recipe <br>  <br>  Inspired by the movie, "Chocolat"! Cocoa was used by the Aztec and Mayan as a sacred drink. It was brewed with various spices and drank unsweetened as part of ceremonies. This recipe uses pure cocoa and several spices, including chili peppers. The flavor is very rich and aromatic, like a dark perfume. Experiment with the sweetness to your liking. <br>  <br>  40 min | 20 min prep <br>  Makes 4 1-cup mugs of cocoa <br>  <br>  4 cups milk <br>  1/2 cup cocoa powder (I used the Dutch brand, Droste) <br>  1 teaspoon flour or Wondra Flour <br>  1/4 cup brown sugar <br>  1/4 teaspoon nutmeg <br>  3 whole cloves, crushed <br>  1/4 teaspoon chili pepper, crushed <br>  1 cinnamon stick, broken up <br>  2 teaspoons powdered sugar <br>  1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla <br>  1 teaspoon cornstarch (optional) or Wondra Flour (dissolved in 1 tablespoon of water) (optional) <br>  <br>  Sift the cocoa powder and flour. Measure out 4 cups of milk. From the 4 cups of milk, slowly whisk about 1/4 cup of it, a little more if necessary, into the cocoa/flour mix until it becomes a paste. If you add milk too fast, you get clumpy cocoa. If that happens, use a hand blender to smooth it out. <br>  <br>  When all the cocoa and flour are a paste (no more dry flour,) add the remaining spices (sugar, nutmeg, cloves, peppers, and cinnamon). <br>  Heat the rest of the 4 cups of milk in a double-boiler or a saucepan over medium heat. <br>  <br>  Add the cocoa/flour/spices mix to the hot milk in the double-boiler. Stir constantly to keep it from burning. <br>  <br>  If you prefer a slightly thicker drink, you can add the optional cornstarch/water mixture now. Continue stirring on the heat until it's to your desired thickness. Not too long; you don't want to be forced to use a knife and fork. <br>  <br>  When the cocoa is ready (it takes about 10-15 minutes until the flavor and heat level are *just right*), strain the cocoa in a fine sieve to remove the cloves and cinnamon pieces. (Careful, it could splatter - I found out last night. *grrr*) Then add the powdered sugar and vanilla and stir. <br>  <br>  If you like, you can put whipped cream on top, add small marshmallows, or add a stick of cinnamon for stirring.|`|hT7BhNamaa	Kaiti J, try google, allrecipes.com foodnetwork.com<br>  <br>  Chris

You should hand out invites about a month in advance, or you could do evites- they're free. I think Dave & Busters is fun, you could have dinner there then hang out- or you could all go roller skating - or to karaoke, or you could do a scavenger hunt -boys against girls or couples against couples- and you end up at Dave & Busters- scavenger hunts are a blast! The best one that we did had a lot of random stuff you have to find things (hospital gown, bridesmaid dress) do dares (eat slurpee from the nozzle at 7-11, dance with a complete stranger, go to a bar and get the bouncer to sing the barney "I love you - you love me" song- the guy at the door (I know your not 21 so if they're not out side you probably wouldn't be able to do this)- get your picture taken w/ a cop, take a picture with a new car that costs at least $50000.00, go to a fancy hotel and ask that the valet get your car and throw a fit when he says he doesn't have it- go through a drive through and order something that they don't have on their menu- and ask if they might be able to make it (IE: a big mac at taco bell)<br>  <br>  I hope this helps- email me if you need anymore ideas!

xrRZeROmaa	Having never owned one, the feedback I've checked out on web sites, state that it is heavy, although on wheels, and movable.  The biggest gripe I've seen is that the cooking space for regular grilling is very limited.  The cooking space for smoking, and the smoking attributes of the grill are touted by everyone as the best.  It' is the usage as a regular grill that is limited.  <br>  <br>  The only other complaint that seems common, is the fact that it is ceramic, and thus subject to cracking.  So one of it's best attributes, ceramic holds heat, is also one of it's biggest drawbacks, ceramic cracks when banged.<br>  <br>  For myself, I will probably try one because I like slow smoked foods, and I've never worried about portability.  The best smoker I ever owned was a refrigerator from the 1920s, with a wood stove providing the smoke through the side, and, a chimney out the top leading to a cold smoker chamber for cheeses.|`|sDKCX43caa	It is possible some of them have used one and not got a good result, and for other people who have never tried one but believe their own is better.<br>  I haven't heard of that one, but to me it is just another, and it will have it's good points and bad, but that doesn't mean I would put one down.<br>  If it doesn't suit me then that's that.

I've been making a Sour Cream Beef Enchilada thing for a long time. It's a bit time consuming the first time you make it, but once you get all the prep done, putting them together is rather simple. You can also substitute ground beef for the roast beef to save money. Just brown and season it first. I posted it on a few cooking sites a while back and everyone seems to like it. I'd double it and make two dozen enchiladas for your crowd. Serve with a simple green salad, some Mahatma brand Spanish Rice from the market (my favorite rice mix) and some canned refried beans. Here's the link to where I posted it on Recipezaar (since that's the one I have open right now) -----><a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/Roast-Beef-Sour-Cream-Enchiladas-311643" rel="nofollow">http://www.recipezaar.com/Roast-Beef-Sou...</a><br>  <br>  Here's a popular meat and noodle casserole my family has made for a long time. All you need with this one is a salad. Here's the link to where I posted it on the 'zaar -----> <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/Beef-and-Noodle-CasseroleJohnny-Mosettifrojos-331684" rel="nofollow">http://www.recipezaar.com/Beef-and-Noodl...</a>  This is a very, very simple and fast recipe.<br>  <br>  There's also always quiche. Who doesn't like quiche? It's also got a reputation as a "froo-froo" dish. If you have a couple of deep dish pie plates, it's another good option. You can put anything you like in  a quiche and it's one of my favorite ways to deal  with some of my leftovers.  Just remember the ratio of eggs to cream or milk - 1 egg to every half cup of cream or milk. My 9" deep dish pie plate takes two cups of cream and 4 eggs. Some of my favorite combos are:<br>  <br>  Ham, cheddar, swiss and green onions<br>  Shredded zucchini, onion, garlic (saute to soften and remove excess liquid first), crumbled, crisply cooked bacon, monterey jack, parmesan and cheddar <br>  Crispy bacon, tomatoes (squeeze the liquid out first), green onion, avocado slices, cheddar and monterey jack cheese <br>  Leftover cubed roast beef, caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, cheddar and swiss<br>  Cubed leftover chicken (or canned chicken), crisply cooked and crumbled bacon, avocado slices and cheddar and swiss<br>  <br>  Just use your imagination! If you want to add "moist" seasonings like mustard or salsa, mix those in  when you mix your eggs and cream for the custard. Also, pile your ingredients in the pie plate before you line it with your pastry (purchased or homemade) so you don't over fill your plate. Dump everything out into a mixing bowl when the pie plate is full. If you have moist ingredients in there, add a tablespoon or two of flour and toss it all together along with any "dry" seasonings like salt and pepper and dried herbs. The flour is your "quiche insurance" so you don't end up with a runny quiche. Line your pie plate with pastry, dump everything in and then pour your custard mixture over everything. Bake it at 350 for an hour or until the top is brown and everything is set. Let it sit for 10 minutes before cutting it. It's much easier than it sounds. I can knock out a quiche in  mere minutes. The hardest part is waiting for it to bake!<br>  <br>  Good luck and most importantly, have fun cooking!|`|7QoeRvI7aa	Well I could come up with many things if I thought about it more...but here's a recipe that has been a hit at my house. <br>  <br>  Salmon Alfredo<br>  <br>  1/2 salmon (or less...don't use steaks)<br>  2 containers Alfredo sauce (don't use the stuff in the jar, it's nasty...use the fresh stuff w/ the fresh pasta..probably near the deli maybe)<br>  Whole pealed garlic cloves (about 6-10)  Don't worry when you cook it in the water, the garlic comes out quite sweet. <br>  Fresh Basil...don't use the dried..it's nearly worthless.<br>  Salt, Pepper<br>  Pasta..I like to use Penne for this but you could use any pasta product.<br>  <br>  Place salmon on a pan with foil.<br>  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

It's rather simple, and since it need to rest for 5 minutes (or a little longer), it gives you a chance to get the rest of the meal ready to go. My suggestions are:<br>  ** toss the cooked and drained pasta (I used rotini) with 2 T butter or margarine<br>  ** use about 8 ounces of sliced provolone<br>  ** use regular or lite sour cream, your choice<br>  ** go crazy and use 8 ounces (or a little more) of mozzarella<br>  ** make sure it's good and hot before removing from oven, then set on a hot pad and cover loosely with a sheet of foil while it rests<br>  You can wrap a loaf of sliced and buttered Italian bread in foil and put that in the oven 5-10 minutes before you take the pasta out. Leave it in the oven while the pasta rests. Have a big green salad already made up and in the frig, and the meal is ready. A relaxed host always makes dinner more fun.|`|uap6JAqQaa	i would also suggest making a pasta dish; they're very easy but delicious and almost everyone likes them! some good ideas are lasagna/baked ziti, spaghetti & meatballs, eggplant or chicken parmesan, fettuccini alfredo with chicken or shrimp and broccoli, & chicken pesto pasta. you can find recipes for these & MANY others at allrecipes.com, along with helpful tips & user reviews. serve along with a salad & some garlic bread & voila, instant fancy dinner!|`|Vge3KBaMaa	order a chinese then say you made it from scratch

jZRtTpZiaa	Yes.  Einstein was a vegetarian towards the end of his life.   He wrote, "I have always eaten animal flesh with a somewhat guilty conscience."  and also,  "So I am living without fats, without meat, without fish, but am feeling quite well this way. It always seems to me that man was not born to be a carnivore." <br>  <br>  Before that, he expressed an interest in vegetarianism, writing, ""Although I have been prevented by outward circumstances from observing a strictly vegetarian diet, I have long been an adherent to the cause in principle. Besides agreeing with the aims of vegetarianism for aesthetic and moral reasons, it is my view that a vegetarian manner of living by its purely physical effect on the human temperament would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind.""<br>  <br>  ** edit:  I agree with the person who said vegetarian may also mean vegan.  The word vegan didn't come along until the 1940's.  People who were vegan before then, and even after that were also referred to as vegetarians.  All vegans are vegetarians,  but not all vegetarians are vegan.   Even today, many people who eat a completely vegan diet refer to themselves as vegetarian.   More people are still familiar with the word vegetarian than vegan.   I never even heard of the word for the first part of my life, and had no clue how to pronounce it when I first saw it.|`|yJSPecgoaa	It appears he was a vegetarian only in the last year of his life, although he espoused it before then.|`|c4058327d20f41accfd1c3c424c72f6faa	I agree with the other answers.<br>  <br>  Also<br>  At one time "vegetarian" in the West could have meant that he was either referring to being 100% vegetarian (vegan) or also including dairy and such.  Usually in the West vegetarian meant no 'meat' to most.<br>  <br>  I have found that talking to people from Asian and India and other areas, that the word for Vegetarian in their country means Vegan, that is, 100% vegetarian, and there is no such thing as different degrees of vegetarian as we have in the West, i.e. vegetarians that eat dairy, vegetarians that eat fish, vegetarians that eat eggs, and so forth.  In most places in the world it seems either you are, or you are not.  In these countries vegetarianism has been around since before history, so it is not viewed as a 'new' thing as is often is in some Western countries.

Melt butter in saucepan and add about 1/4 of your total chopped onions (about 1/2 an onion). Cook and stir for several minutes; add rice and stir until mixed. Add chicken broth and turmeric and stir. Cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling, stir once and re-cover. Cook on low for 20 minutes or until rice is fully cooked.<br>  <br>  2. In skillet, brown ground beef with remaining onions; drain excess grease. Add lemon pepper, chili powder, cumin, pepper, bell pepper, tomatoes, sugar, corn, and peas. Cook and stir until simmering; simmer for a minute or so.<br>  <br>  3. Lightly grease a 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Drain a little of the juice from the meat mixture into the dish, to coat the bottom.<br>  <br>  4. In a large bowl, combine cooked rice, meat mixture, beans, and cilantro.

Bkl0515eaa	Beans and lentils are great vegetarian protein sources.  Here is a recipe for a spicy stew with beans, hominy, and sweet potatoes, with a slow-burn warmth from chipotle chiles.  Serve it with brown rice and a salad, and you have a meal that has the same protein as a steak, with practically zero fat and cholesterol.  And a lot more vitamins, fiber, and micronutrients.  I cook my brown rice mixed with lentils for an extra protein kick.  The lentils cook faster, so I add them about 15 minutes before the rice is done.<br>  <br>  1 tablespoon light olive oil <br>  1 large onion, chopped <br>  2 cloves garlic, minced <br>  1 medium red or green bell pepper, cut into short, narrow strips <br>  2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and diced <br>  One 16-ounce can Great Northern beans, drained and rinsed <br>  One 16-ounce can whole white hominy <br>  One 16-ounce can salt-free diced tomatoes, undrained <br>  1 cup frozen corn kernels, thawed <br>  One 7-ounce can chipotle chilis in adobo sauce (use only half the can unless you want the stew to be really hot)<br>  2 teaspoons ground cumin <br>  1 teaspoon dried oregano <br>  1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro or parsley <br>  Salt to taste <br>  Dried red pepper flakes to taste<br>  <br>  1. Heat the oil in a large soup pot. Add the onion and sauté over medium-low heat until translucent. Add the garlic and continue to sauté until the onion is golden.<br>  2. Stir in the bell pepper, sweet potatoes, and 2 cups water. Bring to a rapid simmer, then lower the heat. Cover and simmer gently until the sweet potato dice are just tender but still firm, about 10 minutes.<br>  3. Add the beans, hominy, tomatoes, chilis, cumin, and oregano. Simmer gently for 15 minutes longer. Stir in the cilantro, and taste first befored adding any salt. You may not need any due to the canned beans and hominy. Add red pepper flakes to taste.<br>  4. The stew should have the consistency of a thick chili—moist, but not soupy. Add a bit more water if too thick. Serve at once, or let stand off the heat for an hour or so before serving, then heat through as needed.<br>  <br>  Nuts are also great protein sources, just be careful of their high fat content.  I enjoy a stew with red beans, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and tomatoes flavored with ginger, cumin, green chiles, and peanut butter.  When people walk into the kitchen they cannot believe the aroma is from a vegetarian dish.  Served with brown rice/lentils and a salad, it has enough kick to fuel a full triathlon workout.

SCiY5JESaa	that is correct|`|HZvdr8VLaa	The yolk of an egg is the yolk of an egg, a placenta is part of a mammal.  Eggs are are how birds form.  These things are in no way comparable, they are totally two different things. Birds do not have umbilical cords or placentas or hair or milk etc.  I really doubt the 'nurse" did very well in anatomy class with the answer she gave you.  Also, the 'forming' chick does not consume the 'white' of the egg.  The forming chick survives from nutrients in the yolk  The white (albumin) is a liquid cushion for the yolk and forming baby chick.|`|AA10063059	yes exactly the same
ozWi3TJlaa	I'm with Marina...I'm in the U.S. and I've never heard of crackers and gravy.

I forgot that about the U.K.  Sorry.  Here's a recipe to make American biscuits (I'm sorry I can't convert the measurements to metric, but I found a degree converter online so I included the temperature info):<br>  <br>  Baking Powder Biscuits<br>  (from a 1933 Recipe)<br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  <br>  2 cups sifted flour<br>  <br>  2 tsp. baking powder<br>  <br>  4 tablespoons butter or shortening<br>  <br>  1/2 tsp. salt<br>  <br>  about 3/4 cup milk<br>  <br>  Sift Flour once, measure, add baking powder and salt, and sift again. Cut in shortening or butter. (this is where I use my hands by rubbing the butter into the flour). Add milk gradually, stirring until soft dough is formed. Turn out on slightly floured board and lightly "knead" for 30 seconds, enough to shape. Roll 1/2 inch thick and cut with 2 inch floured biscuit cutter (I actually just use a glass dipped in flour). Bake on ungreased sheet in a 400 degree F. (200 degree Celcius over there) oven for 12-15 minutes. Makes 12 biscuits.|`|QWY0P98Haa	I have never heard of crackers and gravy....just biscuits and gravy.<br>  A biscuit in America is kind of like a scone, only not sweet like a scone and fluffier inside.

That dates back to the Civil War and even prior.<br>  <br>  It is not a sweet biscuit. It looks like a small muffin, usually made with a flower called "Bisquick", which is probably available in the U.K.<br>  <br>  For sweets, small danishes or donuts are served, which is a bread product in the U.S. as well.

Also, high fructose corn syrup is often in soda which has led to obesity as it isn't digested well.  Maybe they could get chocolate milk as a treat?  If not, lemonade is a good choice to as it isn't caffinated. <br>  <br>  Finally, if sodas are a must- rootbeer and ginger ale tend to be the best for you as they come from plant sources, and aren't completely made up.

It is like a real soda but MUCH better for them.<br>  <br>  However, if you prefer to just give them some soda on occasion I would stick with a moderate portion of the real stuff, not diet, as a treat.

It is unrealistic that some of these people suggest that you NEVER give your children soda, come on...

It is typically between 27% and 30% (30 being HIGH) .  That is 27-30 cents on the dolar to make your food.  The reason for the 70-73% increase?  They are a business, they need to pay staff to make the food, need to pay rent, electric, gas, etc etc.  Most restraunts only make 5 cents to the dolar (so on $10 they make $0.50 profit) and that isn't counting any food that needs remaking, droped on the floor, or broken dishes.<br>  <br>  So yes, you are paying for the simple convinence of not having to make it yourself.|`|sDKCX43caa	Wastage.<br>  <br>  Having helped make them by the dozens, they don't always peel easy and you have to put them aside, and there are so many other things that can go wrong when they cook.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	profits|`|jr2yqSJqaa	Just about everything "pre-made" is more expensive because you're buying it for convenience and the store marks it up accordingly.|`|NwBfuUNaaa	It's the labor, to pay a person per hour wages to make them.|`|AA11786341	probably because of the cost/time of labor=high<br>  versis the shelf life,which is very short|`|6d461f9d3d9b1e07b249bea91e8bfb01aa	Long preparation time and high mark up.

Drain, and add the onion and bell pepper. Pour into large crock pot and add all remaining ingredients. Stir to combine and cook on low 3-4 hours. <br>  ---<br>  <br>  Basic Stew:<br>  1 pound stew meat<br>  1 or 2 carrots peeled and cut into big chunks<br>  1 or 2 ribs of celery cut into big chunks<br>  1 onion chopped<br>  1 large white potato or 2 medium potatoes peeled and chopped<br>  1 clove garlic chopped<br>  1 can stewed tomatoes<br>  Oil<br>  Flour<br>  Seasonings such as seasoned salt, granulated garlic, pepper, celery salt, onion powder and a few bay leaves<br>  <br>  In a large skillet heat the oil. <br>  In a zipper seal bag add flour and all the seasoning to taste-except bay leaves. You want to season it kinda heavily because it will basically season your whole stew.<br>  Toss the meat into the bag of flour and coat well. Add the meat to the oil, adding a little extra flour.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile add all veggies and bay leaf to a soup or crock pot. Add the meat when it is done frying, add all the flour drippings as well. <br>  Simmer on low heat until the meat and veggies are tender. Adding more water or seasonings as needed. Stir from time to time as well.<br>  ----<br>  Crock Pot Chicken Salsa Curry<br>  <br>  10 chicken thighs-bone in<br>  1 jar of your fav salsa<br>  1/2 onion chopped<br>  1 tablespoon curry (or about 1/2 if you don't like a strong curry taste)<br>  1/2 cup sour cream<br>  <br>  Place the chicken in the crock pot. Mix the onion, curry and salsa. Pour over the chicken and cook on low for about 6-8 hours.<br>  <br>  When the chicken is done take it out of the crock pot and put on a serving plate. Add the sour cream and mix well. Spoon the sauce over the chicken.<br>  <br>  This would go well with rice or cous cous.<br>  <br>  If you don't have crock pot you could also do this is a roasting pan or a casserole dish with a cover or tin foil(about 200) check it though since it may cook faster.

This recipe is easy to do smaller portions of as well.<br>  <br>  Mexi-rice:<br>  <br>  Use rice that is still warm.<br>  <br>  Heat a skillet or griddle pan to a med-low heat. Add the rice and your favorite salsa, some olives, corn and ground cumin. (A great salsa to use would be the kind in the plastic tubs in the produce section, I think it's labeled as "Fresh Salsa" but El Paso or whatever would work as well.)<br>  <br>  Instead of pre-made salsa make your own using roma tomatoes chopped small, red onions, chopped cilantro, minced garlic, finely chopped jalape?o pepper, adding some lime juice, and garlic salt. Then toss this fresh salsa in with the rice and cumin, olives, and corn.<br>  <br>  Serve hot and I like mine with just a sprinkle of melted cheese.....yumm!!!<br>  ----<br>  Creamy chicken enchiladas:<br>  <br>  1 pound boneless chicken breasts diced<br>  1 8oz package cream cheese cut into cubes<br>  Flour or corn tortillas<br>  1 can diced green chili peppers<br>  ground cumin<br>  1 or 2 can green enchilada sauce<br>  Shredded cheese<br>  <br>  Cook the chicken in a skillet and when the chicken is done add the cream cheese, it will melt. As the cream cheese melts add the green chilis, and a couple of good dashes of cumin. Continue to heat on low until the cream cheese has melted.<br>  <br>  Fill a tortilla with the chicken mix, roll and place in a baking dish, Continue until the chicken mix is gone. Top with the enchilada sauce and sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 350 for about 10-15 min or until the sauce is nice and hot and the cheese is golden and bubbly.<br>  ----<br>  Polo Verde Sauce:<br>  3/4 cup butter<br>  3/4 cup flour<br>  1 1/2 tbsp cumin<br>  1 tsp garlic powder<br>  2 cups 1/2 and 1/2 or evaporated milk<br>  2 cups hot chicken stock (or hot water with bullion)<br>  1 small can diced green chili's<br>  4 tbsp canned jalapenos chopped<br>  <br>  Melt the butter and stir in the flour. Let it cook and bubble for just a few minutes. Then whisk in the cumin and garlic powder. Then add a healthy splash of the 1/2 and 1/2 and whisk well, let it thicken up a bit. Then add a healthy splash of the stock, whisk and let it thicken up. Repeat until you have added all the liquids. <br>  <br>  Add the chili's and jalapenos.<br>  <br>  This is good on a chicken tostada salad-tortilla bowels or layer of chips. Lettuce, chopped onions and tomatoes, sliced olived and canned sliced jalapenos, and some shredded cheese. Do 2 layers of these. Then add the sauce and serve with salsa, sour cream, and guacamole.<br>  <br>  This is also good on top of breakfast burritos, pork burrtios, as a green sauce for encheladas etc…<br>  ------<br>  Autmn Chop Skillet:<br>  All you need i|`|hV43wyvJaa	Lemon Basil Bowties<br>  Rachael Ray<br>  <br>  1    pound bowties, or other short pasta<br>  ?  cup extra virgin olive oil<br>  ?  cup pine nuts (about 4 ounces) toasted<br>  1 ? cups cottage cheese or ricotta cheese<br>  1/2 cup packed fresh basil leaves, chopped<br>         Grated peel of 2 lemons<br>         Salt<br>  <br>  In boiling salted water cook pasta until al dente; drain<br>  <br>  Transfer the pasta to a large serving bowl and toss with the olive oil.

Make sure you cut some slits in the top and bake for about 35-45 mins @ 425 or until nice and golden.  My kids love it and it really doesn't cost much.

I am replying this question form Japan. Most of the  Japanese beers are so dry, Espacially "Asahi Super Dry" is too dry to drink, I think.

In Japanese supermarket, it is sold about JPY 250 a 35cl can including almost 50% alcoholic tax and VAT. 30-40 yen enpensive than other Japanses beer. My British teacher called Mr. Dunk ( I call him as "Mr. Drunk") who loves beer, recommend this "Yebisu".  I hope you woul like it!  Enjoy youeself much more than you pay for beer!

No wonder they have such problems with binge drinking and drunkenness in colleges here.  They've been taught all sorts of weird things about alcohol so it retains a sort of "forbidden fruit" status here in the US even after they hit 21. For those of us from countries where drinking wine or beer or mead with your meals is no big deal, it remained no big deal even after we got to legal drinking age in the US. So we tend not to abuse alcohol as much.<br>  <br>  Yes, alcohol is forbidden for people under 21 in the US and that law is enforced. Like all laws though, you gotta be caught to get in trouble.

I place my pork roast on a rack in my backing dish, and add water just enough to sit just below the rack. Here I squeeze an orange, and throw the orange in as well after I hand squeeze it. I add two to three springs of thyme and the same in rosemary, into my oven at 400F and prepare the accompaniment as the roast cooks. <br>  <br>  With the drippings of the pork, the orange, and the flavor from the thyme and rosemary, because after a good twenty minutes the liquid has reduced some, I would use the remaining liquid and give the roast a good basting. do that lets say a further three times. When the roast is cooked take it out of the oven baste, cover and let it rest. <br>  <br>  When you carve, do it on an angle. and that liquid in the bottom of your dish should have reduced well enough to be your sauce or gravy.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Rosemary and Garlic|`|AA11441495	Try this out, I know it sounds odd but it works.<br>  <br>  SPICE RUB:<br>  2 teaspoons salt<br>  1/2 teaspoon black pepper<br>  1 teaspoon ground cumin<br>  1 teaspoon chili powder<br>  1 teaspoon cinnamon<br>  <br>  GLAZE:<br>  1 cup packed dark brown sugar<br>  2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic<br>  1 tablespoon Tabasco|`|Yl8JZrataa	Garlic, cayenne pepper, and rosemarry.|`|a6779150ee307fd979ff5c54c79e3cabaa	bay leaf|`|jr2yqSJqaa	Sage, definitely, some ground pepper and a bit of salt (it is pork so not too much) and even an apple pie spice mixed in would be delicious!

It all depends on your verbiage "Sealed" if no moisture could get in then it is good enuf for the GI's.

AA11885259	All good plastic wraps can slow oxidation,..the key is to wrap the product tightly while removing any trapped air from being sealed inside.<br>  That being said, cling types of plastic wrap tend to work better than some that don't. And all good cling wraps are not quite the best either if the thickness, mil of construction, is too thin. Thin wraps tend to tear when stretched and the coverage is then compromised. You may have to shop around to find the best wrap in your area, but usually Saran wrap has a good reputation for doing the function of preventing spoilage of foods. <br>  Some food items will oxidize even while wrapped so even the best wrap will not prevent it. Good luck with your food storage and stay safe.|`|DvlwN9kdaa	Vacuum sealing

m1cEbzBcaa	Applications:<br>  <br>  In fuel cells: Alcohol dehydrogenases can be used to catalyze the breakdown of fuel for an ethanol fuel cell. Scientists at Saint Louis University used carbon-supported alcohol dehydrogenase with poly(methylene green) as an anode, with a nafion membrane, to achieve about 50 μA/cm2 [2].<br>  <br>  In biotransformation: Alcohol dehydrogenases are often used for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure stereoisomers of chiral alcohols. In contrast to the chemical process, the enzymes yield directly the desired enatiomer of the alcohol by reduction of the corresponding ketone.

Your average california roll is made up of imitation crab meat (actually processed fish), cucumbers, vinegared rice, nori (seaweed) and avacado. Of all of those ingredients, the only "fattening" one is avacado...but avacados are good for your heart..they are the "good kind of fat". Sushi is MUCH lower fat than most American foods, has Omega 3 and 6, and is a very healthy meal. <br>  <br>  Plus, to clear up misconception, "sushi" does not mean raw fish. The word for sushi actually refers to the type of rice, which is sticky rice with vinegar...you can have cooked sushi, veggie sushi...it is not all raw fish. In your case, the imitation crab in your california roll is cooked...no raw fish there. The spicy tuna will be raw though...sashimi (which DOES mean raw fish) grade tuna, chopped up fine and mixed with the house's spicy sauce, then put on rice or rolled. <br>  <br>  If you haven't tried other types of sushi...try to be adventurous|`|TPmMzW0Gaa	It's depends on what type of "neta" (the fish) you take. <br>  <br>  You could eg take a look at the neta-calorie table here:<br>  <a href="http://homepage3.nifty.com/maryy/eng/calorie.htm" rel="nofollow">http://homepage3.nifty.com/maryy/eng/cal...</a>|`|Ml7cadEQaa	very healthy and very low in fat, generally

Wipe out the pan with a wad of paper towels (and crank up the heat), add a decent amount of a neutral oil, like canola, and heat it until you get some smoke. <br>  Once the oil is hot, carefully add the potatoes and shake the pan a couple of times to make sure nothing sticks. Lower the heat a little and let the potatoes brown. Season with salt and pepper. <br>   <br>  After a few minutes, shake the pan and get the other sides going. When the potatoes are almost completely cooked, add the red onion and let everything cook together. Once the onions are caramelized, add the capers, red wine vinegar and deglaze.

One more important element for a fluffy and good pancake is the right type of flour; the kind that is for cakes and not for bread.

I always make cakes and cupcakes and never had a problem.<br>  <br>  Cupcakes need 12-15 minutes to be baked, based on the oven temperature. Set the timer and insert a tooth pick or skewer to see if the inside of the cupcake is baked.

There is no meat but I find it rather salt if you want you can get it without salt.<br>  <br>  If you use the seasoning mix either wet or dry from above. I would suggest that you use some coriander leaves (cilantro) as an addition rather than parsley.<br>  <br>  Yes you need to add olives and use spanish olive oil for a more authentic taste.
SSDp4YpPaa	Do you use dairy cream in pina colada?...If so, sacrilege!  I would suggest cream of coconut(canned type, not the blocks), ice cubes, white rum and pineapple juice in the blender.  The dairy cream would be curdled by the acid in the pineapple.

sQXSKaO3aa	Being able to "handle it" is besides the point. When drinking that much alcohol you can easily get alcohol poisoning and die. If you are only drinking once a week or so that should be fine but you need to reduce the amount that you drink so that you don't end up frying your liver, your brain, or killing yourself. You might want to look into the reason that you find it necessary to drink that much at once. Do you have frustrations ect that you are trying to drown?|`|axxQzOCHaa	Seems your body is used to it, but that doesn't make such behaviour something to be proud of.|`|x73nQ4gBaa	You say that you can handle it, but your friends must think differently.  Otherwise why would they say you have a problem?  After drinking that much, you may not be able to evaluate your own actions.  Listen to your friends, and get help.|`|AA10280598	You have a high tolerance for alcohol. So, does my hubby. He is rarely affected by alcohol. He needs to drink alot to get that buzz feeling eveyone talks about, so he simply doesn't drink that much. He just has a few when we go out once in awhile. If you need to get buzzed when you drink you may have a problem and if people tell you ,too, then you may want to take it down a few notches. It takes courage to tell someone they have a problem and even more to face it. Good luck.|`|rhTCejrtaa	I have never liked it when my friends drink, it makes me worry about them. people are worried for you. and honestly you should not drink that much. If it takes you that much to not even get drunk then stop drinking so much. drinking every now and then is ok, but big amounts like that can cause serious problems in the future.

It's more a matter of your friend noticing what foods trigger it.  For me, it's fruits, fruit juices, sweets, chocolate, and cooked tomato products.  But yet I can eat spicy Mexican with no problems as long as it doesn't have cooked tomatoes.

It will mean that you have more business because you can serve a wider range of clientele.<br>  <br>  The cons are that you have to be very vigilant that minors are not drinking. A parent giving a kid a few sips or anything can make you lose your alcohol license.|`|uxvskU7Xaa	its against teh law u can be fined a lot of money and have ur lic taken away|`|AA10280598	I believe it is unlawful for a minor to be in a bar unless it serves food and would then be considered a bar and grill. I also believe they have to still have an adult with them. Minors and alcohol don't mix well together. They are not mature enough to know when to quit and not be self-destructive(some adults, too). Let them get their booze the old-fashioned way, by sneaking drinking at parties and crap with their friends.|`|YGnaI88Saa	Depending where you live the law states that you must be 21 to enter any bar. Now if your bar serves food you can let underage kids in only with parents or Adult supervision but they must be out by 9pm. If you have just a bar and serve no food then absolutely do not let under age minors in your establishment because if they get caught drinking you will be heavily fined and if it is more than one occasion then you could loose your liqueur license and you will be out of business.|`|b8754e91196200e84629988cb6632b19aa	Some one buys a drink for a minor.

There are some great books out there on plate presentation.  I just don't know the titles right off hand.<br>  <br>  As for making food that tastes great, its just a matter of trial and error.  The great chef Georges Auguste Escoffier once said that you had to prepare a dish 100 times before you could fully understand and appreciate it.  In other words, practice, practice, practice.
