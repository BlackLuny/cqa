20090223160337AAJwMpx	Sports;Martial Arts	For martial artists/martial arts in general...?	Well I'm 15 and was looking into a martial art to do over the summer. From what I've read the martial arts are great for not only body but for your mind. They can decrease your overall stress and boost self-confidence. Physically of course there are many aspects. I am asking what things you have obtained mentally since learning a martial art (such as the few examples above).  Just need an inside perspective. Oh and before I forget. The 3 that I want to do are Tae Kwan Do, Muay Thai and BJJ. Haven't found a Muay Thai place in Orland Park, IL yet, but there are tons of BJJ and TKD places. Any suggestions on which one to do (money issue here.......)?

Arteta was sidelined for up to 6 months following a tackle on the weekend. I personally believe he will be a great miss and Everton will start to slip up. So far they have had a great season and are frightfully close to Arsenal. I now believe however that they will start to dip in form after this.

20090223165343AAPb1Tv	Sports;Football (American)	Who is NFL Playoff Hungry for 2009?	What teams do you think are just hungry, hungry for a playoff appearance?  Here is a couple teams I think that will be:      Houston Texans:  The Texans have been creeping up there and I think that they are due for a good season.  Mario Williams (Round: 1, Pick: 1), I mean he's going to do something sometime.  They also have one of the best recievers in the league-Andre Johnson.  Plus the guy who's passing to him-Matt Schaub-did very good in his debut after his injury throwing for over 400 yards in a win over the Packers, so they are playoff hungry.      Philadelphia Eagles:  Donovan McNabb and the Eagles went to the NFC Championship and lost to the Arizona Cardinals in 2008.  Earlier that season the Eagles (Cincinnati Bengals) became the first team to tie a game since 2002 (Steelers vs. Falcons) this made their playoff chances much harder to get to, but with a blowout against the Dallas Cowboys they marched into Wildcard, and were one of the hardest teams to beat.  McNabb and a better Eagles defense will be back next year and looking for the playoff.      Cleveland Browns:  I like Brady Quinn, I think he has all the skills to be one of the smartest Quarterbacks in the league, and he is very athletic.  He and Eric Mangini will turn the Browns around and be a big surprise to the rest of the world and will be very playoff hungry this season probably finishing with a 10-6 season and a division title (That is if my Ravens have anything to say about that)-GO RAVENS

The guy fixed it and told me everything on it looked good. While riding it back home the chain came loose again.      It seems to pop out when I'm shifting my left side. It works fine when I shift the ride side as long as I keep the left side on 2 (I have 1-3 on that side).  Keeping in mind I never use gears 1-3 on the right while I'm on 3 on the left side and vice versa.      I'm convinced the sales rep doesn't know what he's doing.  Is there a way to visibly see whether the chain is too loose or too tight, thereby, slipping out everytime I shift my left gears?  I think this may be my problem and I don't know how to fix it as long as I don't know what the problem is.      Thanks.

20090222112355AABMZFh	Sports;Cricket	Does your country's Twenty 20 league also have stupid gimmicks?	Yesterday was the Finals match of South Africa's T20 domestic series (in SA, we refer to domestic T20 as Pro 20). Anyway, in yesterday's match, the umpires arrived by helicopter which landed in the middle of the field. Do you realize what a stupid gimmick that is? I thought T20 had moved past ridiculous gimmicks. I don't particularly likes gimmicks like cheerleaders, etc in T20. In SA, we even have a "dunk-tank" gimmick at T20 matches. Whenever a 6 is hit or a wicket falls, someone (usually kids) get dunked in a tank. Although I don't like gimmicks like cheerleaders and dunk-tanks, I still DON'T think they are silly - they have some merit. But what is this crap of the umpires arriving on field by helicopter? It was so corny, so stupid. It would perhaps have made sense if it were players arriving by helicopter. But umpires? I think it's time that the FAKE, CORNY, CONTRIVED, OVER-THE-TOP, gimmicks used in T20 get ditched! Does your country's domestic T20 league have any overly-ridiculous gimmicks? If yes, name your country and its stupid gimmick.

Okay, so our school is putting together a volleyball team for this competition, and we want pink uniforms (because our name is going to be the Pink Panthers). Anyway, I found a really cool-looking uniform that I know everyone would approve of, but I am not sure if it actually comes in that exact color! Here is a link to the site:       http://www.teamsoftballuniforms.com/prod...       The pink uniform that the girl is wearing is the one that we all really want. But when you go to order it and it says "start designing" (<--because we want our own design), it doesn't show that color. It shows a fushia color that is really ugly and too light-colored, but I'm really not sure. Could someone please go look at that site and see if there is that color or not (because they will kill me if I get the wrong color...lol)? Thank you thank you THANK you! I am choosing a best answer! :D

We're going up for one day, and he's never been on a set of skis in his life, and doesn't want to shell out the money in hopes that I can teach him the basics since it's only one day.       Before you tell me he should take a lesson from a professional, let me explain.  I'm now 26, and have been skiing (and spent 15 of those years in ski school, learning by professionals) since I was five years old.  I'm more than capable of teaching somebody how to do wedge turns and ride a ski lift, and that's about all he's going to be learning in one day.       Right?      Is there anything else I should be showing him in particular?  Any tips about teaching a beginner?  Anything I should avoid?

20090222151359AABJKlM	Sports;Baseball	Does it matter where you have the label on a baseball bat?	I was taught in little league that you should always have the label facing you on a wooden bat, since the companies put the label where the wood is the weakest.  For the most power and least chance of snapping the bat, you should hit the ball to the side of the label, since the grain is thickest there.  But after talking to some friends, I have a doubt that this is just a myth.     Since it's the off-season, I can't watch the major leaguers to see if they keep the label facing the sun.  But I do have a Sam Bat maple professional bat that supports my tee-ball coach's lesson.  Just wondering if anyone can shed a little more light on this one.

Thinking it was valuable he rubbed it to clean off the dust. To his surprise out popped a Genie who said, "Oh master, I grant you one wish."

Since I like going to Spain to find young players I would like you to build a bridge from Liverpool to Spain since I don’t like flying and the trains are unreliable - this way I could drive."      "Oh no master," responded the Genie, "that is an impossible request, it would take the will of a thousand genies to grant you that wish - you must choose a task I can grant you."      Rafa mumbled under his breath for a bit before saying, "I have a player in my team who should score more goals, can you make Babel into a 20 goals a season player?"      To which the Genie replied, "OK, what colour lights do you want on your bridge."

I also believe Rubio sold himself out anybody else agree and why?      My reason simply because I've seen Rubio fight many times and I have never ever seen him not fight back and to quit I mean we Latinos aren't known for quitting in boxing.      I mean just look at Rubio's fight against Enrique Ornelas prior to his fight last night going 12 brutal rounds without giving up and winning a split decision now that's the Rubio I know not the Rubio I saw last night.  I just believe Bob Arum paid Rubio to lose so that he can continue to bring up his fighter Kelly Pavlik after his one side beating to Bernard Hopkins.  All I have to say is no matter what Kelly Pavlik will never be a great fighter although I must say "The Ghost" is an exciting fighter but as far as a true boxer never!

Is it generally expensive Skiing holidays or just expensive once you get there and what would you say are the very basics you'd need to go in the way of clothing and safety gadgets? Thanks.

I cant go much over the ￡400 mark, I want to get into BMX-ing, am 18, 12 stone, about 6 foot, I've had a cheapy bmx before that made a cracking sound when you pedalled to hard.       So I have had a go of several trials bike, liked, but I need something I can do a small amount of riding around on, college isnt too far, but Ive decided on a BMX, and Id like to give all of the different types a go, ie. freestyle, dirt, park... Ive got large open spaces near me, a dirt track, and a smallish park close by but a much larger park a little further away, so I have all facilities nearby me too to try them all.      I also have given them all a little go, except dirt (but even then I have done a few MB trails), but now I've got some money Id like to buy a decent bike, I've looked around but I dont really have a clue. It seems you want a Cro-mo frame and forks, sub 25lbs, brakes and pegs are your choice, and 48 spoke rims... I think thats alll...      So all in all, Id like to spend less than ￡400, I've explained what I know, I think dirt is what I'm looking for, but I just want a strong, reliable, good looking BMX to get me started on, I understand things like pedals and chains will break too, but Ive put together MBs before and presume BMXs arent too much different. Im not afraid to build my own custom, but Im sorry to be a pain, but If you can name all parts if you suggest a custom setup for sub ￡400 cos in terms of brands I dont really have a clue... (If you could recommend a full custom setup Id be most grateful, 10 points to u)        Thanks for reading...

He sounds like a tired Peter Purvees commentating on a Royal garden party or Rememberance Sunday      No enthusiasm, seemingly no F1 knowledge, and that annoyingly constant same level drone.      He constantly talks over the other coverage team and is quite frankly boring      I don't want to miss Martin Brundle's commentary but may be forced to switch to the alternative      I was no big James Allen fan, but come on BBC , Legard is sooooo wrong for this job      What do other f1 fans think of Legard?

20090222083218AAS7nTD	Sports;Surfing	Surfing... where do I start? I have a little bit of a lead already... some advice?	Hey guys,   I'm very interested in surfing, and I absolutely love the water (I'm a swimmer, and I am plenty strong enough to surf) and the beach. A year or so ago, I took surfing lessons with my cousin in Ocean City, New Jersey and I couldn't get enough of it. We rented some long boards and surfed the rest of the week, although, we weren't very good.   After that, we hit up Surf City, North Carolina. There, I went through all of the surf shops looking for an affordable board (considering I'm 15 and I don't have a job), and I really didn't care what it was, so I got a short board (like 6ish) and it's really old... they practically gave it to me for 75 bucks. It's a stewart... I did have a little bit of trouble getting up on it, and fell a lot, but I was out on the ocean every day at 8 am till around noon.   So, for christmas this year, my dad got me a board that's 7'6 and I haven't gotten a chance to use it yet.   I just wanted some advice on... well everything I guess. How do I get started the right way? I now have two surfboards, and I know starting with a short board was definately the wrong way to go. But how do I do everything? I have no idea about fins (so anything about fins would be helpful, the stewart board's are like stuck on, like you can't change them), and I know a little bit about wax. I have a wetsuit (I'm a certified scuba diver so I know all about that stuff). But what else do I need to know????   Thanks to anyone who contributes!

I currently live in United States. I have contacted this agent and he is helping me try out for Manchester City. Do you think I can go try out with out my parents? what is the rule? Can i still sign contract to the academy or youth team without my parents moving with me. How does FIFA know if i make contract? is there any other possible ways i can sneak in one club? Can I get permanent residence or work permit? Can you tell me my chances.

20090222103934AAX3hdI	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	Aside from performance, how would a Londoner choose between Arsenal and Chelsea? Class differences?	Let's ignore how good each team is for a second. That means no answers like "cuz arsenal kicks chelsea's ***" or "because the arses suck!"      Both clubs have had a degree of success throughout time, so how would a person living in London who is completely new to football (no family ties) choose between Arsenal and Chelsea?      Is there a class difference between the two? Just like the Olympiacos and Panathinaikos from Greece represent the working class and upper class respectively, do Arsenal and Chelsea supporters tend to be from separate classes?      eg.) Which of the two would a blue-collar worker cheer for? How about a glamorous upper-class executive?      As well, what kind of stereotypes exist among both fanbases that would draw certain people to cheer for each club? Is Arsenal famous for a certain kind of supporter? What about Chelsea?      Thank you.

He is fast, has excellent hands - he can hold onto the ball w/ ease, and has a nice inside game can put the ball in 8 feet. He is also a banger down low and gets his team 2nd chance opportunities.      He is impressing me. Just, his 3rd year in the NBA and this his only year of playing time and if he keeps this up he can be a new faster version of Anthony Mason. He is built for the transition game.

Everyone continually saying they want Undertaker's streak to continue without unpredictability at WrestleMania 25 against HBK kind of makes me want to see The Undertaker lose to HBK at WrestleMania as much as I love the Deadman. I can't stand the mentality of some of these fans who just want his streak to continue with absolutely no unpredictability whatsoever. I just got off youtube hearing some fan saying he would go so far as to stop watching if Taker lost at this year's WrestleMania. That's so lame. How predictable do you want this man's matches at WrestleMania to be anyway. Fans are going to make things so lame. I am shooting for HBK just because of that. And against HBK at that. If there's one person I wouldn't be mad with Undertaker losing to it's him
20090222125302AAcNykD	Sports;Wrestling	Ok! So what's with all this nonsense surrounding Taker vs. HBK at WrestleMania 25 with Kozlov and JBL?	I don't like all this nonsense surrounding The Undertaker's match with HBK (or at least that's what I think the match will be and what is predominately expected from most fans) at WrestleMania 25. What's with HBK having to earn anything? HBK should not have to earn a match with The Undertaker at WrestleMania. He's Mr. WrestleMania and a legend in the WWE. I could see it if JBL or Kozlov's behinds had to earn a match to contend against The Undertaker or HBK but why does HBK have to earn a match with The Undertaker. There shouldn't even be anyone trying to earn anything; just Taker vs. HBK and the lead up to their match at WrestleMania. They need to keep Kozlov and JBL's behinds out of it. If they try to make it something else other than just Taker vs. HBK it's going to suck. Even some kind of fourway or threeway garbage with those two cheaters involved where their won't be a clean outcome

20090222134044AAY09b1	Sports;Wrestling	Could Vince MacMahon actually be president of the US?	Before you scoff, consider this:   Arnold Scwartzeneggar - former bodybuilder and actor became California governor   Jesse Ventura - former pro-wrestler became Minnesota governor   Jimmy Carter - former peanut farmer became US president   Ronald Reagan - former Hollywood B-list actor became US president   George W Bush - former MLB baseball team owner became US president      Well, then would Vince MacMahon as US president be so far-fetched? He has experience owning and running a large corporate entity. The nature of WWE requires him to understand how to relate to both big business and the common man. And with all those USO tours by WWE, Vince is pretty respected by the US military too. So all in all, do you think it's a case of "lol" for MacMahon to be US President?

Where the Jays have a winning season and fail to miss the playoffs cause of the Yankmees and Blowsox and last year because of the Tampa Bay Gays.

Cito Gaston is a good manager and can handle "Manny being Manny" moments.      Also, Manny Ramirez is a lifelong Blue Jays fan. He rooted for guys, like Tony Fernandez and George Bell, so he will not mind going on the Jays. Where he can also stick it to the Red Sox and Yankees something he would like to do as well. Cause Jays have a handful of good players.       Think of it now...      Pitching:   Ace.) Roy Halladay   2.) David Purcey    3.) Jeremy Accardo   4.) Jesse Litsch    5.) Shaun Marcum   6.) Dustin McGowan   Closer.) B.J. Ryan      Infield:   C. Rod Barajas - Good acquisition    1B. Lyle Overbay - w/ Manny & Vernon = Big 3 in Hitting   2B. Aaron Hill   SS.

20090222142903AAb7piu	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	Left handed rifle help... looking for a .243...?	hello, i want to start hunting, and i have chosen to go with the .243 caliber. i chose this cal. because i want to hunt smaller game such as coyotes. groundhogs, etc. however, i also want to hunt deer occasionally. with the .243 i can do both. i will not be hunting larger game than deer until i am older (when i have more money) and then i will just buy a rifle for elk, etc. so please don't suggest a different cal.      i have been searching for a good .243 rifle for awhile now and can't seem to find one, i was hoping all you people out there could help me. If you can show me a rifle with in the specs i am looking at, that would be great.      i am left handed and i am looking for a rifle with a synthetic stock preferably, but, if i like the rifle i may just make an exception and go with wood, and i am also on a budget, as i am only 15. so i want to spend $500 dollars or less, but if need be i may go up to $550.      i was also looking for a scope that i could use but i am unsure of which one to get. i would like a variable power, mil-dot scope, probably with a power of 3-9x but I'm also not sure how big of an objective lens to get? i was looking at maybe a 40? and as i stated before i am on a budget so I'm looking to spend $100 dollars, but if i need to i will spend about $20-25 dollars more.      But, if you guys can point me to a good combo deal that would be perfect, so i don't need to go and get both the rifle and scope.      thank you in advance for your help, and i hope i gave you enough info and specifications. and sorry to mention it again but i am left handed.      p.s.   i was looking at the Tikka t3 lite rifle because my friend has one in .270 and it is a nice rifle but it is at the top of my price range. also i had my eyes on a Remington m770, i also like this rifle but haven't seen one in real life.

20090222143722AAJ2yOX	Sports;Basketball	Is Sam Cassell the Greatest Impact Player Ever?	I have always had a wee bit of a soft spot for Sam. Cause, I am a Suns fanatic and he did play with the Suns. When there was a three some of promising guards. It was Jason Kidd, Steve Nash (the rook), and Sam Cassell all on the same team. Much better than Steve Nash, Leandro Barbosa, and Goran Dragic no? Lol, if only they could have been kept together.      Anyways, looking back on Cassell and the 3 championships he has won. 2 of which were he was a big time player on Houston hitting clutch shot after clutch shot. Take a look at his track record for changing teams completely around in his career.      NJ Nets - Before, Cassell in 96 won 30 games, in 95 they also won just 30 games. Cassell comes in and they win 43 games in 97.      Milwaukee - Ray Allen and Glen Robinson were a great duo. But, could not stand each other and the Bucks lost in the early stages of the playoffs year in and year out. Cassell comes in and they reach the ECF almost making the Finals.      Minnesota: KG's 2nd option Wally Szczerbiak and him feuded and did not really get along, like Allen and Robinson and they never made it out of the 1st round either. Cassell comes in makes it to an All-star game and also helps KG take the T-Wolves not only passed the 1st Round, but into the WCF.      LA Clippers - Elton Brand's only season of making the playoffs came w/ Cassell. He was the best player on that team and Cassell was voted in the All-NBA 3rd team w/ the Clipps for taking them to the playoffs for the first time since the early 90's. He also was the reason Clipps won their first and only playoff series in franchise history. Almost, taking the Clipps to the WCF. Losing, in 7 to the Amare Stoudamire less Suns.

We always hear about players having "upside" or the potential to be better, but when has it been long enough and the upside doesn't exist?  For example, we've heard about Antoine Vermette's upside since he hit the NHL.  He has top end skill, he has 2 (nearly 3) 20 goal seasons.  Yet, he hasn't hit that next gear that makes him a top line forward, or a point per game player and we STILL hear about his upside?  When do you call a spade a spade and say Vermette is a 40 point player?      I don't want this to be about Antoine Vermette, but when do YOU think a player's upside has expired?  Thoughts?  Obviously this is a bit subjective.

I know that this lifestyle will limit my social life, but it is my life, and i wish to fulfil my dream. If you have any comments, ideas or any way to to help me, I would greatly appreciate it.
