usltkMnwaa	tephejees downtown. good music and atmosphere.|`|ltg4YHRsaa	Brooklyn Jazz Cafe is very cool if you can get there early.  It gets pretty packed.  Great atmoshpere, and good artists.    I would stay away from Sambuca unless you like overpriced drinks and mainstream jazz.  The crowd is pretty lame.    I've never been to TePheJe'Z, but I thought it was a club that played other music as well.|`|AA10541300	http://www.sambucarestaurant.com/    Fabulous place.      -Kevin|`|NbWFJjvraa	We've been to both Sambuca and TePheJez.    Sambuca is more of a "supper club" and the jazz is really mainstream.  Food is expensive, but good.    Whereas TePheJez is more edgy and is more about the music.  TePheJez's music is more varied.  I think they even have  had George Clinton.  Fun place, but small.    Guess it just depends on what you're into.    Have fun!|`|TLDC5mlvaa	the Blue Lounge

kedcv0glaa	I'm an adult, I can eat whatever I want, whenever I want. It is awesome :)|`|JfVxCDb7aa	When I was a kid I had to not eat between lunch and dinner.|`|WRbbpRZzaa	Eat whenever you feel like it, Kid!|`|I7mBG3Dnaa	I dont think there are any set times...Id say at least 15 minutes though to let your dinner settle, that way you dont over-eat|`|6tE9eaBRaa	When you want to!|`|VXcp8hvHaa	72 hours|`|MVAyYCByaa	u wait however long u feel like waiting all that it is is just more food|`|oSyFBCwSaa	If you're overweight, wait 20 mins or so. If not, chow down!!!!|`|xc5fhhCAaa	eat the sweets before dinner so you spoil your appetite.  you can even eat dessert when you wake up in the morning before breakfast, or as breakfast!|`|39572a1f937c182f27bd29b894eacbb1aa	My mom allows me to take a bite of my dessert 20 minutes before dinner every day if I want to. Then I have to drop dessert down and eat my entree. For example, I have 2 Grandma's cookies I can have 1/2 cookie before dinner. If I have M&M's I can eat 3 of them. If I have Sara Lee cake, I can have a small bite.(1/8 of cake) She wants me to enjoy the rest after a delicious dinner.|`|92edf0c7b50fbc4193d0d0409a4da541aa	One time, I was fixing my entree (Stouffer's Lasagna) and my friend gave me some cookies from the bakery and she said eat one now. I said, it would not hurt by eating dessert first and I ate the cookie right then. I start every dinner by first putting my dinner on and then opening my dessert that I will have and start by "tasting" dessert. One time I ate 2 M&M's out of my pack and then told myself put the dessert down, I did leaving a M&M out of its pack and then when I was ready to put my entree on the table I ate the M&M out of the pack. Now if that happens I put the M&M back in its pack. I enjoy lemon pound cake and opened the pack it came in 1 minute before dinner  tonight and ate a bite of that before my entree. Sometimes when eating my entree, I eat dessert with it.|`|yn8uNUO1aa	I eat dinner at 6pm and no desserts after 3pm. I can get dessert and open it though and see all those cookies waiting for me and smell all the chocolate in Russell Stover candies. I have to earn it even though I am an adult. Once I bought a big bag of M&M's tear and share and opened it at 3:30pm but waited until 7pm to eat them because main course first then wait 20 minutes then dessert.

eua5YYYcaa	Not, depending what you put in it.  If you get it with syrup, sugar whipped cream and the works,...watch out!  But just coffee is nothing.  It is Paul Newman's at least in Massachusetts.      I just got the book Eat This Not That and says coffee in moderation is good for brain stimulation|`|h6NqNzHAaa	The only potentially unhealthy parts are the sugar and cream you put into it. Try it without the sugar/syrup and only add a little (or no) cream. Black coffee has no calories,|`|69bp1IMfaa	Just as unhealthy as their other stuff.|`|V5osj5o8aa	idk but there both relle good. all coffee isnt too healthy tho|`|zDWRaNa2aa	a 24 oz (smaller one) vanilla flavoured will rack up 180 calories.  Not great, not bad necessarily but I think you can custom order some places to use no sweetener which would lessen the punch.

2c10ae9d03edf5d663e295c5fc61a2caaa	Yes,so lazy parents of overweight kids don't have nobody else to blame but themselves|`|UbHlArNtaa	I think they should be given a choice of reforming to be healthy (not just healthier) or being shut down. currently they (the fast food industry) have the power of money and ignorance on their side, people know its bad for them, but not how bad. people see cheap easy convenient food-like substances and don't look deeper than that. If you want to be educated, I recommend The Omnivore's Dilemma.|`|PmKq5XKgaa	Never!!! Where will I work when I lose my job then?<br>  <br>  Seriously, it is a choice. And it is only bad if you eat an inordinately large amount of it and do very little (more like no) exercise. If you treat it like my parents did (as a once a month treat), then it's just as healthy as that candy bar you had at lunch. <br>  <br>  Long live Subway!!!|`|KqxQlPrNaa	No, because most of us would starve otherwise!  So, view it as "feeding the people" sort of.|`|Dx0CAHeiaa	no, of course not! i'm 16yrs old....cant live without fast food.|`|IM3QwSS2aa	Not necessarily shut down but a different paradigm of menu choices and preparation.  does every thing have to be put in the deep fryer?<br>  <br>  /jerome|`|RpR3MkH2aa	Fast food is Ok once in a while.It won't hurt you if you have it once a week.|`|tc1oaf6taa	No, I don't think they should be shut down, but I do feel that the FDA should enfore mandatory guidelines and implement healthy options instead of fried fatty everything. <br>  <br>  Granted, many companies offer healthier options, like apple dippers from McDonalds, and Taco Bell's Fresco Style, but there should be more. All places should either offer or be mandatory to have whole wheat bread. The cheeses should be low-fat, as well as the mayo, ranch, etc. Fried foods should be limited, or eventually removed. Milk Shakes should be made with skim milk. <br>  <br>  If people are forced into eating healthier without options, they will. But most people are lazy, and chicken nuggets are fast and easy.|`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	Several points I can make about fast food being shut down.<br>  <br>  1. No government should be able to regulate what we eat.  I do believe they can educate the public on making healthy choices that is fine.  If they want to teach eating in moderation etc.  fine.  <br>  <br>  2.  I would not want to see any restaurant worrying about being closed because of government intervention on this subject.  Closing these businesses would affect so many people i.e. jobs, convenience, and the local economy.<br>  <br>  3. Fast food like any food is not "unhealthy."  Over indulgence is.|`|vwYbFtkqaa	Post this question in "Politics and Government, Elections" and you will be swamped with responses.  Most of them will be accusing you of being a socialist/marxist, just like President Obama.<br>  <br>  Can't shut them down, all the major fast food franchises are international corporations.|`|VvbOSbRnaa	Nope. They are not there for health reasons. They are not your mother and make sure you eat your fruits and veggies. They are a business and out to make money. There will be those people who refuse to go there because it's not healthy but there will be other people who don't care that it's not healthy (like me) and will stop there because I am hungry and want something quick.|`|o7wGYLZ5aa	No, I think fast food should be looked at as something that is not so casual.  You can eat it but not every day all day long.  You can have a burger once a month and ice cream one a week.  It is how it used to be when people did not have much money and so they would eat this scarcely and therefore they were not fat or had so many cardiovascular problems even though they eat this food sometimes.|`|5eoO6qosaa	No, that is one of our inalienable rights - the freedom of choice. If you can not control your self, and not over eat the fast foods why do the ones who do control themselves have to suffer? Are we not regulated enough? Why the need for all this governmental control?|`|nFQSTaRvaa	fast food is the equivalent of dirty old school porn. no one wants to admits they love it.  but everybody does, even the greatest chef. its one of the biggest guilty pleasures on the planet. but its just soooo goood.|`|jsxphZJEaa	No they should not. This question has been asked and also stated.  Fast food is only bad if you truly over indulge. Many people eat far worse at home and non fast food places. People need to learn how to eat healthy and if they choose not to, so be it. It is their own fault.|`|yGu5gdGaaa	No! The government shouldn't be allowed to regulate what/where people eat! It's so ridiculous that trans fats are being banned in certain cities. It's socialism. What's next? Are we gonna be forced to buckle up when we drive? Oh wait.. too late for that (at least in MA).|`|ODvnyAdlaa	no people should be able to choose what they eat with their own free will and you have to admit it may be unhealthy but it tastes darn good! xx|`|nwuL7M7saa	It is bad for you but people choose what they put into their body.|`|LSqHgFBDaa	No they are to good and convient to be shut down
