FKxrJxbPaa	LMFAOOO<br>  <br>  <br>  most police are puppy dogs?!?!<br>  <br>  On new years eve in Oakland, California a police officer EXECUTED a man in a train station while he was on his knees, unarmed. In New York last year police officers fired 54 shots at 4 unarmed black men, killing one on the night before his wedding. Amadou diallo was murdered in a hail of 41 shots while he was trying to get his wallet to show his ID...something the police TOLD him to do. Abner Louima was anally raped in a bathroom with a toilet plunger by police officers on duty. <br>  <br>  <br>  The problem is that the police overall are, and always have been, rather corrupt and have typically served their own interests over those of the ghettoes they patrol. They even have this ting called the "drug courier profile" which essentially outlines what your average drug dealer looks like. Guess what it describes?<br>  <br>  Black/Latino male<br>  15-34 years of age<br>  typicall baggy pants, etc....<br>  <br>  <br>  Which is quite ridiculous considering the the MAJORITY OF DRUG USERS AND DEALERS IN AMERICA ARE WHITES!<br>  <br>  In New York 94% of the people in prison for drug offenses are of colour, despite the fact that 60% of the people using and buying and selling drugs are white.<br>  <br>  A Question....<br>  <br>  Do you live in a middleclass neighborhood? Are most of your neighbors white? are you (presumably) fairskinned? If so...then I'm not suprised you aint been hassled by the police. They're your neighbors. Their kids went to school with you. They aint gonna bother you if they KNOW you.<br>  <br>  <br>  I dont snitch because the police officers have a really sh*tty track record when it comes to protecting the people that snitch for them. I live in new york and theyre STILL finding bodies of man who got killed by the mob for snitching. There's soo many good cops, but there are soo many crooked ones that I simply cant trust the system as a whole. At the end of the day its my block versus the cops and I chose the people I live with over the people who failed to protect me any day. <br>  <br>  I've had the "what if's" before and they havent changed my opinion. My uncle was murdered by a man who was paroled. My OTHER uncle was beat down in the street and robbed....people SAW it, TOLD THE POLICE WHO DID IT and no arrests were made. <br>  <br>  Anyway, the police THEMSELVES dont even snitch on each other when one does wrong, why do you think its so hard to indict a police officer and charge him for a crime? They got some big-man solicitor hired for them by the munincipality and they babylon bredrin dem dont say SH*T in court.<br>  Cops dont snitch on each other to protect us...so why snitch for them to help them lock us up? They got no qualms about bussin our skulls and walkin away so why the f*ck should we give a rass bout dem?<br>  <br>  F*ck the bumbaclaat bway dem|`|vcdhCiU6aa	Its a threat minority men (black) use to keep people from calling the police.|`|StRaKUf6aa	Group mentality.  It's a dangerous thing to have.|`|kvWF1a2Yaa	they say " snitches get stitches"|`|5tY3eZcoaa	I agree with A Dreamer, good to see this question.  And those black people who abide by this ridiculous don't snitch policy cry and complain about missing black kids or women, or when the police aren't that involved in solving some one's murder who is black, yet there were witnesses who won't come forth about what happened.  I mean do they think witnesses don't help solve crimes?|`|oKY0s2THaa	I don't care what the ''rules'' are, if I see something wrong I'm going to report it for the safety of everybody<br>  <br>  I mean if there was a killer or a gunman on the loose after you. Wouldn't you want somebody to try and stop them?|`|AA11355027	its in every commiunity in black/spanish/white..<br>  its just that like dont be dry snitiching (like randomly snitching)  it started in balitmore but it got out of control after the stop snitching dvd|`|PLtU5AuYaa	That is a normal mentality for a lot of people and communities not just black ones.|`|1acc6a03dc8acb93ccd9b56b409139d2aa	I guess you seem to have black people all figured out then right.. cause god knows t.v and the media never lies! lmao!|`|jYy6dDAZaa	I'm white.<br>  The no snitch is used by gangs to enforce their control over a captive neighborhood thru fear.Only after a devastatingly bad crime does a community raise up and demand help only to recoil after that need is met.<br>  About 10 years ago in Chicago the house of famed bus rider Rosa Parks was burglarized, word spread within minutes and a gang was out to lynch the thieves when the police arrived, the (suspected) thieves ran and jumped into the police car.<br>  Black on black crime  outweighs black on white by about 10 to 1.Community pressure can solve black crime only by speaking up and shouting that they will not defend these ppl and send them to jail then running them out of communities on the first misstep.|`|lvWqfnfpaa	Yeah, if you snitch then you're a 'snake'<br>  <br>  I live in South London and go to a school full of Jamaicans, Nigerians and Ghanians. But it doesn't matter if you're not Black, the rule still applies to everyone.<br>  <br>  I haven't seen even one of my friends (I have no white friends, by the way lol) support the police. I understand that the police force were racist back in the days e.g. when Brixton Riots occurred. But now most officers treat everyone equally. <br>  <br>  Outside my house, there's a school (it has a really bad reputation) and it always has about ten police officers in vans. I dont know why but Im glad, I feel like theres a shield of protection around me and I know the kids wont find me easy to pick on because I'm Bengali/Asian|`|wTqid2ONaa	I would say that goes for anybody that comes from any inner city area, not just black. There's alot of lazy azz cops, that just look for anybody that "fits the description" so they can make a arrest and go home, i'm not making this up, this happens alot.<br>  <br>  Nothing good ever came from talking to a cop either. Snitches get stitches is true, the system just uses the informant for what they need and never really protects them.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing you never had to deal with dirty cops.  On my old block the cops got a cut from every hustler and most of the times if somebody got snitched on it was because somebody wanted their turf for the clients or whatever.<br>  <br>  Edit: what if something happened to a member of your family. would you not value the police then?<br>  <br>  No, they and the legal system are useless to me, i would take care of it myself.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: what Lex said, you have never been on the recieving end of those night sticks aka n-beaters.|`|zW8tc64qaa	I'm Black living in America, and I don't get it either. It's one dumb-a** rule that should be disregarded. I don't care who thinks it shouldn't. <br>  <br>  What's more important, keeping confidentiality, or living to see the next day by stopping something that can be easily prevented?<br>  <br>  I mean, I think it is pretty foolish to withhold information that could mean the difference between being alive today and not seeing tomorrow.|`|qSWQx2Guaa	It is the same reason you black people cry race discrimination if there is too much police patrol in your neighborhoods.  And when you call race discrimination when there is too little police patrol in your neighborhoods.  There is too much emphasis on being petulant children to the police department than improving their own community.|`|fusc1cykaa	Hmm theres a "no snitching" culture in my community too which is white/mexican.|`|J8txpWJkaa	Because the ones saying no snitching are criminals themselves. Guilty by association.|`|8auEgQf2aa	Nobody likes a snitch|`|RDoFAwv1aa	cosign|`|npTZTzWRaa	its how some people were raised, if you are going to be respectable in the streets than thats how it is, if a person is supposedly carrying themselves as a Gangster and then they snitch, this means they were a fake gangster and are snitching to benefit themseleves and throw someone else under the bus, in the streets it is immoral to be a snitch because you are already aware that this is the street code and you claim to be living by the street code yet you renig when sh*t hits the fan, it shows you are a coward and were all talk<br>  <br>  If I was to snitch on a freind or relative I would be an outcast and my own FAMILY members would disown me and maybe even try to hurt me because this means that I was a fraud and a phony because I claimed to be street.<br>  However if I keep my mouth closed as I say I will then I am a man of my word and that is respectable in the streets.<br>  <br>  Someone who is not "hood" would be expected to tell because they arent kept up to the same standards and are a normal citizen<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  edit- listen to ma boy Lex, hes spitting that knowledge, Ive literally heard white Attorneys say its never a good idea to talk to the police because it almost never benefits you<br>  <br>  <br>  this is a white law school professor with DEGREES out the wazoo for all you 'pro snitching' folk who like to think "Educated" people are better, he is explaining why talking to police is NOT beneficial even for average citizens<br>  <br>  <br>   watch the video and for all you people trying to blame BLACKS for Americas injustices against us and the black community, try again<br>  <br>  Snitching is Dumb|`|4Vmlf902aa	Yeah in the U.K. Here there is no "no-snitching" rule.|`|2sLv6uXtaa	Its not even blacks trust me im from london and in my college....theres this indian girl...who acts like shes ghetto and like she says she hates the police blah blah...dont act like this is a black thing cuzz i know many whites, asians and other minorities....that operate on this 'rule' its mostly the what i call urban areas....yes it happens more in black communities becuz there are many black communties in the city...etc.<br>  <br>  anyways i have nothing againts the police as im a law abiding citizen...etc

1OzuuDcpaa	Oh wow I live right next to Laurel in Greenbelt hehe! My friend lives in Laurel and for his birthday party, we went to play laser tag at this place called XP Laser.

They do birthdays too but I think it's a bit too late because they want you to reserve in advance. <br>  <br>  But you can still go play and everything lol. What we did was we played and went to the Pizza Hut down the street and that worked out pretty well hehe.|`|AA10542176	There isn't much in Laurel, except for the mall...

Music, morales, technology, politics, etc. The "Leave It To Beaver" days were on their way out. Young people wanted more freedom, and to be able to "express" themselves. I won't say all of the changes were for the good, but there were many, many good and happy times for a lot of people. I guess what I notice most now is that a lot of commercials use the music of the '60s to advertise their product. Also a lot of the shows have theme music from rock songs of the 1960's.
zLXmOXkBaa	Yes. Some accents even change within a state, so sometimes it can be hard to tell, but generally speaking, yes. <br>  A lot of the midwestern states accents sound the same, so people might not be able to tell right away the subtle differences. The east coast accents are very noticeable, and there are many different variations from state to state on that side of the country. The southern states have their own accent which is extremely noticeable, and would sound all the same to anyone not from the region, but people living there could pick out which state they are from.<br>  <br>  I guess it's easier to distinguish a regional accent, rather than a state accent since they tend to blend together by region instead of by state...typically.|`|wTqid2ONaa	Yes.  America is a pretty big country with alot of different regional accents.|`|tVUBqdSzaa	yes sometimes.<br>  i can't distinguish by state, but i can by region.<br>  :]|`|AA10232076	Yep, almost always.|`|9wdAKAGRaa	No I really don't think so, not to the same degree anyway. We can definitely distinguish between and northern and a southern accent and of course a Bostonian or a New York accent but that's about as far as it goes. Many people can't even tell the difference between a Canadian and American accent. The only way I can tell is by their pronunciation of words like 'about', which they pronounce 'aboot'. It's interesting, our differences. . .|`|oUBUWfS6aa	I live in Connecticut. I didn't know we had accents.|`|uZT5qGWsaa	mostly by region|`|3m00lxxuaa	Sure, Boston accents, and southern accents at least are easy to distinguish.|`|420d72e7d945fb5cb4d470808614f009aa	There's a big difference between a southern drawl and a New England accent, midwesterners have their own way of talking, too.

The mortality rate for children under 5 years of age is 28%, the worst in the world. Inadequate nutrition, HIV/AIDS, high ratio of orphans per capita are some of the reasons why. Many of the men mine for diamonds for pennies a day and few opportunities exist for women except for subsistence farming. Sierra Leone is a pretty desperate place.

VsamHLPOaa	There's nothing wrong with defending yourself especially if they were being racist. But if you struck out and made racist remarks yourself whether you believe in them or not is wrong. I have answered many questions that were negatively directed towards black ppl without striking back and insulting someone else's race. I will not let a few ppl push me so far as to say something so negative and stoop to their level. I have many white friends and refuse to degrade them by making offensive remarks toward their race just because of a few ignorant ppl. But if no offensive remarks were made and you just defended yourself than keep it up. Just my opinion.|`|fAp0vFAHaa	There's nothing wrong with defending yourself against racists but they are different approaches to defending yourself against racists that you can do on your own.|`|hMYW2vDhaa	I'm not sure, because they can defend their selves but we can defend our selves?

Not sure what you mean by that.<br>  <br>  If you're going for a therapeutic massage with a licensed or certified massage therapist who just happens to be gay, you can expect a thoroughly professional (ie: NON-SEXUAL, non-erotic) massage to help you relax and/or treat any muscle tension you might have in your back, neck, legs, or whatever. <br>  <br>  If you're going for a so-called "sensual massage" he might make a perfunctory effort at giving you a massage for awhile, and then finish you off with a hand job or "happy ending".  :-((   Be aware that this person is NOT a bona fide professional massage therapist, he's basically a male prostitute. No self-respecting massage therapist would degrade himself to performing a sex act with a client, its totally inappropriate and unethical, not to mention illegal.|`|m2PlMByKaa	take condoms.

Philosophy is merely the practice of asking moral questions, or, as the Merriam-Webster online dictionary puts it, the"pursuit of wisdom." There is nothing wrong with wisdom!

bfWcfCKXaa	The bigger question is, what happens when Muslims with all of their scientific knowledge start exploring outerspace? What happens when they make use of the miraculous scientific knowledge only yet to be "mined" out of the Koran and start learning how to terraform other planets? When they move billions of light years away to distant planets which direction will they pray to then? Straight up? Straight down? It will then change each hour, each day, each month, each year! LOL! They will be really confused then. They will have to devise astro-charts to have a theoretical fix on earth and the point of Mecca in relationship to their distant planet every few minutes! Their prayers could miss the earth by millions of light years if they get their calculations wrong! If they don't get it exactly right, their prayers won't bounce off the Kaba'a (which is really a sophisticated satellite dish - "a prayer transmitter") and transmit their prayers back out to where Allah lives. Why, he might not ever hear them! You didn't know that is what they put that meteorite in the Kaba'a for, did ya?|`|xv7KV1jAaa	Wherever they stay they have to face that idol and pray.

Make sure that you pay your FULL tithe and offering to the Church on time or God the Holy Ghost will zap you on the spot and the Church people will give you a quick Christian BURIAL without notifying anybody in your family. This is the Godly way of “doing” overdue Church account holders after Jesus Christ did away with the gross LAW of his Daddy God in the Old Testament days! Then they were dealing with only one God. In the New Testament we have 2 additional identifiable deities one is a make believe “sweet Jesus” and the other one is God the Holy Ghost! This last one is very touchy and unforgiving about money issues.<br>  <br>  Act 5:9-11 (NIV) Peter said to her, “How could you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord* (*alias “The Comforter”, alias “The Helper”, alias “The Paraklete” by not paying the FULL tithe and offering to the Church!)? Look! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door* (*in a truly Christian funeral nobody in the Church notifies anybody the death event to any spouse or relative! Have you noticed how cold bloody is Saint Peter about tithing?! God won’t allow him to do any counseling on money issues!) and they will carry you out also.” At that moment SHE FELL DOWN AT HIS FEET AND DIED* (*Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus! The Bible writers say that Saint Peter expected that the Ghost of God was going to slaughter her on the spot “at his feet”! Just like her husband was Divinely slaughtered a few moments earlier! The lady died without knowing that the Ghost of God killed her husband the same way! In his Popish authority Saint Peter made no intercession whatsoever for any of them! That ought to teach everybody a big lesson to get serious about giving to the Church and how truly Christian funerals are conducted!). Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband (Praise the LORD! That ought to teach moron Christians a big lesson on giving to the Church!). GREAT FEAR SEIZED THE WHOLE CHURCH AND ALL WHO HEARD ABOUT THESE EVENTS* (*Holy solution! There is nothing like a Holy Mafia option to keep Christians paying their dues to the Church on time and IN FULL!).<br>  <br>  It works all the time! Just have somebody slaughtered in the primitive Church and the rest will learn AND FEAR! It is the wanking Bible writer way to teach anybody a lesson! What if Ananias and Sapphira had children at home? Who cares? No Bible College student would dare to ask this question to their “God sent” teachers of the “Word”! Too bad the CNN or even FOX News was not there to report…! Not even the Mafia operates like that! You don’t need too many neurons in your brain to figure out that the Bible is a bloody religious fantasy book written to control religious people into submission to the Clergy! Some moron atheists don’t have the slightest idea how it is that Christians are so masochistically submissive! It is all a form of sexual gratification! Check with Kinsey!<br>  <br>  Any member of God the Holy Trinity puts to shame any mobster boss intimidating and killing anybody without mercy just to get your attention about paying your tithe and offerings IN FULL and on the spot to the Church… NO RAIN CHECKS! The Bible writers were very smart! They thought of everything! Although today the preachers use a more civilized "sow the seed and harvest bountifully" scheme to get your money. They do it with a CLEAR CONSCIENCE AND CLEAN HANDS and it is perfectly legal in most countries where politicians take FULL advantage of people’s religious gullibility like in the USA!

38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	Canon Law doesn't supersede the Commandments, considering that it is based on them and clarifies how the sacraments and practices of the Church are to be administered. This does not contradict the Commandments for this reason: <br>  <br>  Catholic doctrine is  based on three things --Scripture, the teachings of the Magesterium, and Sacred Tradition. One must be in full agreement with the other two and cannot disagree with them in any way. If it does, then it is automatically rejected. Since Canon Law explains and clarifies the practices of the Church, it, too, must follow Scriptural guidelines. <br>  <br>  For example, when Jesus instituted the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist, He said, "This is My Body." The absence of the verb in the original language gives us a direct correlation: this (the Host) = My flesh. As a result, the Church formulated the doctrine of transubstantiation. <br>  <br>  If a priest should say to his congregation, "Hey, this isn't really Christ under the appearance of the elements, so I'm not going to go through the Consecration," he would be in error. He has violated both the practice and the underlying principle of what constitutes a valid Consecration.<br>  <br>  I do have one question for you: what business is it of yours what the Catholic Church believes and teaches? You're not a member of the Church, Canon Law doesn't affect you, and I get the distinct impression that you're not just seeking information for learning's sake. If you genuinely want to know more about Catholicism, I'll do my best to answer your questions or find the answers if I don't know them.<br>  <br>  If you're just another basher, bigot, or busybody, then may I suggest MYOB?<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  I just read your last question, and I think I understand a bit more of where you're coming from. I apologize for being suspicious of your motives: it appears that you *are* genuinely interested in what the Church teaches, and I'm sorry for misjudging you.<br>  <br>  Catholic bashing is something of the sport du jour around this Forum, and it's really gotten on my last frayed nerve lately. I'll be looking forward to reading your future questions and answering them to the best of my ability.|`|I0aosHnuaa	why overlook the major FACT ; the evil catholic cult is GUILTY of crimes against humanity !!! ... there is NO god ... our parents made us.|`|hQPi5t1Gaa	More control over the masses?|`|G2yUpoqfaa	Decretals are included in the canons, and these were dogmas (divine <br>  law) from the Early Fathers who were taught by the Apostles. These Decretals cannot be altered, erased or omitted because their source is that found in the Patristic history on record. <br>  <br>  The Decretists commonly referred to ecclesiastical laws (church laws) as canon law.  Sometimes canons meant laws promulgated by the Pontiff overriding other inferior laws.  Trent and Vatican Councils designated definitions of dogmas by the term canons. It is the Code which refers to disciplinary laws of the Church as canons. Confusing, yes?<br>  <br>  Dogmas at these two Councils, plus previous Councils, promulgated de fide dogma. Divine law is in the canonical law. Laws on the behavior of the faithful apply directly in regard to divine law. But the laws are also called canons. Only one more de fide dogma was promulgated after the 1917 Code, the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which was promulgated by Pope Pius XII in 1942 and is shown in the Acta Sedis.  Commentary by Woywod on Canon Law shows this dogma in the 1952 addition.|`|N53y9qohaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  1) To have some sort of agreement and cohesion in the church's teachings, beliefs and administration so we do not have 30,000 differing, arguing denominations as we saw after the Reformation.<br>  <br>  2) When talking to Peter, Jesus gave him, his apostles and their successors (they think) authority to make some laws and regulations.<br>  " Thou art Peter and upon this rock you'll build my church and .. the gates of Hell shall nor prevail against it.

I was married, the marrige was not conducted intht echurch, but it did recieve a blessing.  I divorced, I wanted to marry again.  I need to have the first marrige annuled.  Now a marrige just cnat be disolved by the churhc, thta has to be a specific reseaon according to cannon law.  In my case I was not a full participatnt in the blessing.  a marriage can only be anulled if it is deemed not to be sacramental, regardless of a secular divorce.<br>  In my own case there were a couple of points in cannon law which made the marrige nullable and thus not sacrmaetal.  Without cannon law to deceid these things, ie did i give my full consent, did i know that the blessing was going to make the marriage sacramental, were we both open to having children, now wihtout cannon law, and I give only one example; we would just as you foundies do get a secualr divorce and remarry over and over again hopping and a popping with any one we want , but just have our pastor remary us after a divorce.

First, to say that Jews thought the ten commandments ignores the fact that they too have what could be described as corpus of canon law.  You can read the Talmud to see what I mean.<br>  <br>  Second, canon law deals in the governance of the Church, which could be described as an expounding upon the ten commandments to an extant.  The canons from the early church councils also dealt with problems the such as apostate bishops, converted heretics, kneeling on Sunday and the dating of Easter.  Later, canon law began to take on other problems as they appeared in the church, such as simony, selling of relics and indulgences, marriage and divorce and so forth.  Some are disciplines, while others relate directly to faith itself.<br>  <br>  To say that canon law is to be used over and against the ten commandments simply isn't true.  The problem is that the practical aspect of governing a church that encompasses over one billion faithful, one requires a bit more than just the ten commandments.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	If you read any Canon Law (it is available on a number of websites), you would see that nothing in Canon Law is "over the Commandments".  Canon Law deals primarily with specific ways of doing things - how the sacraments are to be administered, etc., none of which is in any conflict with the Commandments, which deal directly with moral issues, and which the Catholic Church also accepts fully.  You want to know if adultery is acceptable?  Look to the Commandments.  You want to know what the requirements are for being a baptismal sponsor?  Look to Canon Law.  The two work hand in hand to guide Christ's Church in the fullness of truth.

When said friends are all goths/metalheads/nerds/otherwise socially awkward some rather hilarious things ensue. Anyway, I'll go with a particular story.<br>  <br>  Just after I broke up with my boyfriend, I met this goth dude. Now, I like goth dudes, they're cute and smart and they look after their hair. The guy was pretty nice, if a little bit weird even for my tastes. At the same time, I met another guy who was a gamer dude and a musician. So of course I was a bit confused as to what to do. Here comes the creepy part.<br>  <br>  The goth dude asked me to go outside to the trees between our rooms at university. He was incredibly drunk and started going nuts at me, saying that he'd just had to turn down another girl because he loved me (we'd known each other maybe a month) and quoting creepy song lyrics at me. We had been on one kind-of-date and that was it- I had explained my situation to him and he'd seemed okay- and yet there he was, acting like a stalker ex-boyfriend. Needless to say, I decided to go out with the musician dude and we're still together.<br>  <br>  Interestingly, a friend of mine briefly dated my ex (we'll call him Bob) after me, and then went out with this goth guy afterwards. When they broke up, goth dude said "I'm sick of getting 'Bob's sloppy seconds" Excuse me? I hadn't even kissed him, let alone slept with him and he said that? Ugh.<br>  <br>  There you go! Long and possibly boring but yeah, there we go.<br>  <br>  And I can assure the alternative ladies out there that I've only ever dated goth/metal guys and assorted weirdos, and this fella was the only freaky one.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	His name was Sean.

Sorry, it's been a while since I was into all that, but I hope I helped.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Here are a couple websites on the topic:<br>  <a href="http://www.ecauldron.net/articles/archives/2006/07/entry_70.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecauldron.net/articles/archiv...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wicca-spirituality.com/wicca-altar.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wicca-spirituality.com/wicca-...</a><br>  <a href="http://blessedbe.sugarbane.com/altar.htm" rel="nofollow">http://blessedbe.sugarbane.com/altar.htm</a>|`|KXQVRQdjaa	There is no one right answer, but here's the basic accepted format:<br>  <br>  There are usually at least two candles on the altar, to represent the goddess and god.  The most common are black and white or silver and gold pillars.  I like having a black sphere for the goddess and white pillar for the god.  If one lacks subtlety, occult shops carry penis and vulva candles of all colors.  Some use statues or symbols instead.  I have the candles plus an antler (naturally shed, not killed deer) and a statue of a goddess.<br>  <br>  All things feminine are usually placed to the left (cup, cauldron, etc.) masculine to the right (athame-a knife used to direct energy -second picture-, wand).  Some people have crystals or divination tools, like tarot decks.  Pentacles (first picture) to charge amulets, and a boline (curved knife-third picture) for cutting herbs.  A book of shadows is often found on it.  Usually inscence and candles, too.<br>  <br>  The links are to pictures of altars.<br>  <br>  Again, this is typical, but that doesn't make it right.  They are very personal and diverse.  They can be as big as a porch bench or kitchen table, or a portable little pocket size to go with you.  They are often decorated for the holidays.  As you can see by the pictures I linked to, there is a HUGE variety.|`|Ji1DVABtaa	Whatever you like when all is said and done, but the basics are here at www.witchvox.com
uji29VvRaa	My personal choices... anything by Scott Cunningham or Raymond Buckland.<br>  <br>  One of the first books I ever read pertaining to Wicca is called Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner by Scott Cunningham. It was very informative, and well thought out. I have a couple of other books by the author and they are quite good.<br>  <br>  As for Raymond Buckland, any book by him is worth reading. He is generally refered to as the first person in the States to openly admit to being a practitioner of Wicca, and introduced the lineage of Gardnerian Wicca to the United States in 1964, after having been initiated by Monique Wilson in Britain the previous year. He later formed his own tradition dubbed Seax-Wica which focuses on the symbolism of Anglo-Saxon paganism.<br>  <br>  Aside from that, keep an open mind and be careful of which books you read. Some are garbage, some are great.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Also, DJ Conway is a good one, if you're interested in Celtic Wicca. <br>  <br>  I'd stay away from ones that target the teen audience, such as Raven Silverwolf. <br>  <br>  Specific books to look for:<br>  <br>  by Scott Cunningham -<br>  Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner<br>  Living Wicca: A Further Guide for the Solitary Practitioner<br>  Earth Power: Techniques of Natural Magic<br>  <br>  by Raymond Buckland -<br>  Wicca for One<br>  Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft<br>  Wicca for Life<br>  Practical Color Magick <br>  <br>  by D.J.

4aveC2aaaa	no one knows their religion in its fullest. there is still so much to learn and explain. <br>  <br>  things present in the Quran are miraculous, it was sent down centuries ago, and scientists today are "discovering" these things.|`|qRue8Xdraa	It's usually circular... the reason that is.|`|1GZ8nrjyaa	Actually, I have more faith in messiness, than in order.<br>  <br>  For some purposes, that is.<br>  <br>  In order to bypass the ego's left-brain orderliness, the Divine has to root around and sneak in through the disorderly right-brain's messy, intuitive thinking.  At least part of the time.<br>  <br>  Here's an example from "Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle," by Carl Jung, p. 110:<br>  <br>  "My example concerns a young woman patient who, in spite of efforts made on both sides, proved to be psychologically inaccessible. The Difficulty lay in the fact that she always knew better about everything. Her excellent education had provided her with a weapon ideally suited to this purpose, namely a highly polished Cartesian rationalism with an impeccably "geometrical" idea of reality. After several fruitless attempts to sweeten her rationalism with a somewhat more human understanding, I had to confine myself to the hope that something unexpected and irrational would turn up, something that burst the intellectual retort into which she had sealed herself. Well, I was sitting opposite of her one day, with my back to the window, listening to her flow of rhetoric. She had an impressive dream the night before, in which someone had given her a golden scarab-a costly piece of jewellery. While she was still telling me this dream, I heard something behind me gently tapping on the window. I turned round and saw that it was a fairly large flying insect that was knocking against the window from outside in the obvious effort to get into the dark room. This seemed to me very strange. I opened the window and immediately caught the insect in the air as it flew in. It was a scarabaeid beetle, or common rose-chafer, whose golden green color most nearly resembles that of a golden scarab. I handed the beetle to my patient with the words "Here is your scarab." This broke the ice of her intellectual resistance. The treatment could now be continued with satisfactory results."<br>  <br>  So if you are expecting all of human experience to be always structured and orderly, then perhaps your expectations of everything being "in order" are themselves "out of order."<br>  <br>  When I think about evolution and paleontology, plate tectonics and Carbon-14 radioactive dating, I use the same left-brain skills that help me balance my checkbook.<br>  <br>  But when I deal with things like knowing who is calling the moment I hear the phone ring (yes, it happens on rare occasion, and no, I don't have Caller ID)--or why I have learned to trust the nagging voice of intuition the most, when I feel like doing what it is nagging me to do the least--those are the moments when the left-brain's unique, holistic skills make me more fully human.<br>  <br>  WHATEVER their disorderly, messy, maddeningly helpful cause may be.<br>  <br>  Carl Jung, Preacher's Kid that he was, saw the subconscious, intuitive part of the person as the part of ourselves that is most in touch with the Divine.|`|1KcQbEopaa	I have faith that Mr. Crabs will make me laugh everytime I watch him but you never know carton writers may have an off day.|`|cZ3h1dffaa	And if like me you have faith in chaos?<br>  .|`|xfYUxKmvaa	Faith is built on trust.

For example, Jesus emphatically said that he was not God the Father, but he claimed to be Jehovah of the Old Testament, whom the Jews frequently called God.<br>  <br>  The reason why a mistaken sort of monotheism developed in the first place probably arose because Jehovah didn't want people thinking that stupid little lifeless statues are gods.  I think that most or all references to Jehovah being the only god are in the context of idols and local deities.  The same does not necessarily apply to real Gods, or Jesus could not claim to be both Jehovah and the son of God.<br>  <br>  I think Paul's explanation is clear enough; there are many Gods, many Lords, and many things that are called such but are neither.  We still only have one God to worship, the Father, and one Lord to save us, Jesus.  The only other meaningful option is the Trinity, which cannot be, since it is indistinguishable from the idolatrous Ashtoreth.|`|9CoaKELzaa	Who said the "Holy Bible" is credible?

I just stared at it for a minute wondering whether I should scream or just sit there, and also wondering if we were getting robbed or something. Well, I stared at it for a few seconds and the Figure (as I've taken to calling it) turned and walked away...I immediatly got up and followed it, But try as I might, I couldn't find it. I saw m Grandma sleeping, but I couldn't find the Figure. <br>  Well, a few days later, my Dad, being the Ghost hunting geek he is, went over to my Grandmas with a video camera. My Grandma wasn't home, (she was at work and gave him permission to go in her house,  yes we are close with her lol) well, he turned the camera on, and left the house for a few hours. Well, most of the stuff he picked up couldn't be exoplained. The camera getting moved, noises, stuff moving and a mysterious white light.  We still don't know what is going on there.

Now I'm never going to go clubbing. <br>  <br>  I don't understand what the appeal is. I do not understand most people.|`|xp4mhkqgaa	It depends which club you go to, all clubs are different.<br>  <br>  I used to be a big clubber, I'm getting a bit past it now, so only go very occasionally.  <br>  <br>  The places that I went to, about 90% of the people were there to listen to the music.  We hardly ever bumped into any idiots.  Most of the guys didn't really go out looking for girls, they were more interested in the DJ and the tunes.  Also, they weren't drunk (they were all nutted), so that made a big difference.  I met some cracking people at clubs, really genuine, nice people.<br>  <br>  Of course, there were places like the one that you've described, but I avoided them.  Apart from numpties who were bevvied, annoying girls, the music was cheesy crap.  I usually went to places that played underground stuff (house & techno).  <br>  <br>  So, basically it depends on the type of place that you go to.|`|yogjnd4qaa	Like taking a golf club and smashing through everybodys window!

Uy58ixnvaa	I'm probably going to get a thousand thumbs down for this (judging from the other answers) but I honestly don't see what's so insulting about it. <br>  <br>  I mean, yeah, the historical people you chose were influential and such, but so were the more recent people like Will Smith. They may not have done something big like helped end slavery, but technically they are a part of black history because they've contributed to the society and entertainment. <br>  <br>  The teacher wanted icons. And of course most kids would pick poeple like Hariet Tubman of course; I'd say the kids that did someone they can see eye-to-eye with were being creative and thinking outside the box. <br>  <br>  When people think of black history, they see Frederick Douglass, Henry Box Brown, etc, but they don't think that today's icons are a part of black history. They were black, and they are a part of history, and that constitutes as "black history" to me; not how many speeches you delivered or how many segregation laws you abolished (though those are awesome things as well).<br>  <br>  This is just in my opinion. Sorry if I offend you, but I really don't see anything wrong with it. Kids are more like to be on the same page as a great black actor than a 100 year old, dead abolitionist (sp).|`|rHHm4XNpaa	no...<br>  <br>  Isiah Thomas, he was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.  Cool.<br>  <br>  Jerome Bettis, Bettis is considered one of the best big backs ever due to his amazing footwork and sheer power, and is fifth on the National Football League's all-time rushing list. Cool.<br>  <br>  Mr. T, He is a born-again Christian.  Cool.<br>  <br>  Will Smith, He is the only actor in history to have eight consecutive films gross over $100 million in the domestic box office as well as being the only actor to have eight consecutive films open at #1 on the domestic box office as a Lead Actor. Cool.<br>  <br>  Give those kids an A+.|`|AA10232076	Well...not necessarily. I mean, the teacher should have guided them a bit better on people to write about, but it's not truly offensive. Will Smith for instance, is a hugely successful actor  and he has done good things for people. But still, the teacher should have given better people or examples to do papers on, because that's just a tad pitiful.|`|2xaVpnNNaa	well that is typical kid behavior, their role models are always what is "hot" and "in".<br>  <br>  some dont even know enough about the older blacks that made REAL contributions. to even decide.<br>  <br>  its not really insulting but it is pretty funny.|`|ZMn9vY7Jaa	It's not the children's fault.<br>  In a way it could be the teachers. <br>  The kids are not as educated as older people and when they think of African American people, of course famous people that they hear of everyday like Will Smith are going to pop in their head. <br>  Most of them probably haven't even heard of the notable people like Benjamin Banneker who the month is pretty much made for.<br>  I don't know how that is racist to you at all because all the kids are writing about is how an African American has changed their life, it doesn't have to be a more noteworthy person. As long as they wrote a good paper they should have gotten an A. <br>  If there was ever an Asian month, most people  would write about people in our media, and that is not at all racist.|`|DJMPQlFDaa	Black history month should be January so that kids can have Martin Luther King Jr's birthday off. February is president's day month and my birthday month.<br>  <br>  It depends on how much effort the child puts into his or her paper if they deserve to fail. If they can name the reason why or how these people contributed to black history then they deserve an A.|`|n1Ga3kdYaa	Honestly yes. I agree you should give them an F. If the only people they can think of are entertainers, then they are ignorant and deserve an F.

If they were told to choose a black person to write about, then they did the assignment as it was given and should not be given an instant F. If I had that assignment, I would probably choose Damon Wayans.|`|kYItYRo9aa	who cares they cry racism every damn time|`|4Vmlf902aa	No maybe it's the only ones they know.

Mercy is a word used to describe compassion shown by one person to another, or a request from one person to another to be shown such leniency or unwarranted compassion for a crime or wrongdoing. One of the basic virtues of chivalry, Christian ethics, Judaism, and Islam, it is also related to concepts of justice and morality in behaviour between people.<br>  <br>  In a legal sense, a defendant having been found guilty of a capital crime may ask for clemency from being executed.<br>  <br>  To be "mercy", the behavior generally can not be compelled by outside forces.

AA10034051	Some claim that confessing to a priest is not biblical. In John 20, we read of Christ appearing to the disciples on Easter Sunday. He breathed on the apostles giving them the authority to forgive, and not to forgive. This means they had to hear the sins in order to forgive/not forgive. Jesus then says “as the Father has sent me, so I send you”. This means the apostles are to continue Christ’s mission, the essence of which is the forgiveness of sins. In 2 Corinthians, St. Paul describes the apostles as ambassadors of Christ’s work of reconciliation. In the Epistle of James we read that the presbyters (priests) are called to pray for the sick and forgive their sins. Why are priests called to perform this task? Obviously, the priests have an authority that ordinary Christians do not. <br>  <br>  It is clear that Christ gave the apostles the power to forgive sins.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Sacrament of Reconciliation is one of the seven sacraments Christ gave his church. The Sacrament of Reconciliation is also known as the Sacrament of Penance or Confession. This sacrament can set us free from our sins, and from the burden of guilt that comes along with our sins. Through the Sacrament of Reconciliation – confession – we are brought back into union with God. Our sins separate and damage our relationship with our Lord, and it is through this most powerful sacrament that our relationship with the Lord is repaired and strengthened. Through the Sacrament of Reconciliation we can walk more closely with the Lord once again, without the burden of our sins weighing us down and distancing our relationship with God.<br>  <br>  Some ask why Catholics confess to a priest rather than just going straight to God. Some claim that confessing to a priest is not biblical. But that is not true. <br>  <br>  We confess to a priest because that is the way Jesus instigated the sacrament. It is at his command that we confess to one another. When we sin against the Father our sins also affect our Christian family. Confessing sins to a priest is something that was a universal practice and never debated in the Early Church.<br>  <br>  Jesus himself was able to heal not only the physically sick, but the spiritually sick as well. Christ had the power to forgive sins (see Matthew 9:1-8; Mark 2:5-12). <br>  <br>  He passed on that power to forgive sins in his name to his Apostles. <br>  <br>  "Amen, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again, I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything for which they are to pray, it shall be granted to them by my heavenly Father." (Matthew 18:18-19)<br>  <br>  "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I sent you." And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit. Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them, and whose sins you retain are retained." (John 20:21-23)<br>  <br>  Jesus entrusted his Church with the power of forgiving sins through this most wonderful sacrament. The priest is simply the one who acts in persona Christi (in the person of Christ) in the confessional, but it is our Lord who forgives our sins. The priest grants absolution (sets us free from our sins) using the power Jesus entrusted to his Church. It is through Christ, however, that our sins are forgiven.<br>  <br>  St. Paul tells us, "And all this is from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Christ and given us the ministry of reconciliation, namely, God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting their trespasses against them and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. So we are ambassadors for Christ, as if God were appealing through us." (2 Corinthians 5: 18-20) <br>  <br>  Does this mean that we shouldn’t speak and pray directly to God and express sorrow for our sins? Not at all! In fact for daily faults that is exactly what we should be doing. But for more serious offenses, for grave and mortal sins, we must repent and confess through the Sacrament of Reconciliation because that is what Christ commands us to do. <br>  <br>  <br>  Reconciliation (also known as Confession and Penance): Penance is a Sacrament in which the sins committed after Baptism are forgiven.<br>  Biblical references: Matt 9:2-8; Jn 20:22-23; 2 Cor 5:17-20; James 5:13-16; <br>  Matt 18:18; 1 Jn 5:16|`|f5FmJRfIaa	Yes, it means that church leaders are descended from the original apostles, and just as they had the ability to absolve sin, so do modern day priests and pastors.  The Catholic sacrament of confession is based on that.  The Christ forgave sin often in the Bible, and in giving that authority to his apostles, he charged them with a responsibility that he had carried out.  He knew he would not be around long, and delegated authority to do that.|`|rU6nh42Eaa	These verses have very little to do with priestly confession and forgiveness.  <br>  <br>  The word isn't actually forgive, it's bind and loose. "And I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" (Matthew 16:19). Jesus said in John 20:20 “If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.” <br>  <br>  The keys of the kingdom refer to the availability of the good news of salvation to the people.  Religious leaders in Jesus' time were actually keeping people away from God with their rules and esoteric teachings.  Jesus was giving the disciples the authority and the responsibility to tell the Good News to all. They would be responsible for the discipline and rule of the church according to the word of God. <br>  The binding and loosing were a rabbinic notion that had two meanings: to provide rules or to discipline. Both meanings are given in the direct context of the given texts. In John, Jesus is talking about how our lack of forgiveness continues a bond between us and our offenders.  If you look at the verses around them, it talks about how the church deals with grave misconduct by other Christians, and the power of the church to judge wrong acts and refuse to have fellowship with the offender.|`|LKRXCFuWaa	yes, it's the great commission given to the apostles from Jesus. Years later, Peter would use this commission after arriving in Rome to pass on his authority to Linus of Rome. The commission has spread throughout the ministerial priesthood sine then, passed through the generations from the twelve and Paul, and today we know it as the sacrament of reconciliation.|`|oeO8Tgroaa	I don't see anyone forgiving anyone if it was not from the All Mighty first.|`|AA10641825	Yes that's what he meant, I rather suspect he didn't know what he was talking about.|`|TzY9vkinaa	yes it does, if they have the correct priesthood authority.
AA12006309	It's possible you're going through a phase, experimenting with your gender expression (how you display your gender to others).  You could be transgender or genderqueer.  The only person who knows that for certain is you.<br>  <br>  Being transgender isn't like being transsexual.  It's not just "boy wants to be girl" or "girl wants to be boy".  There's more than just two choices.  The gender spectrum is wide, varied and colourful.<br>  <br>  For example, I'm third gender.  I don't identify as either male or female.  My gender expression is very male though.<br>  <br>  There's plenty of people in the transgender and transsexual community that wouldn't mind talking to you and helping you through these feelings, we're all over Y!A.  Don't be afraid to contact us to ask questions.  It's kind of why we're here.<br>  <br>  I'll place some links below for you, and if you need something more specific, feel free to send me an email.

I think the best thing you can do is find someone who might understand and talk to them because it might just give you some reassurance.<br>  And really, I think almost anyone has sexual fantasies in which they take on different roles, whether they admit it or not (most people don't talk about such things openly) so don't worry too much about it. <br>  Honestly, I think you shouldn't hide the fact that sometimes you feel masculine or other times feminine. Be what makes you happy, that way, you won't feel suppressed and confused. <br>  I hope you find a solution.|`|bb2cafcc1198c3f1dea9c78f472dc7e9aa	gees your not gonna have a easy life with that combo, one is bad enough|`|AA12022623	You do sound confused...I would suggest a therapist who specializes in this area.

Wanting to be what you are not?  Welcome to the human condition.  I'm not sure that it is even possible to answer your question because gender-confused and "should be transgendered" are awfully close together.<br>  <br>  The next question is whether you are ready to make a commitment to being the other gender by going to counseling.  You don't mention your area and I wouldn't know where to look anyway, but you might be able to find some reputable psychologists or psychiatrists who could help you tell the difference.<br>  <br>  Just be aware that there is a huge commitment if you decide to really do a trans-job.  Surgery is involved.  And given the cost, pain, and healing time, it is not likely to be reversible if you turned out to be wrong.  I guess my best advice is don't make any permanent and irreversible decisions without professional help.|`|65QqZBnjaa	My advice is to speak with a gender therapist:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.DrBecky.com/therapists.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.DrBecky.com/therapists.html</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!

Tledw3eAaa	It was a while ago. I think I must have smelled something very faint, though I have no idea what the smell was. It reminded me of being inside my bedroom as a kid, and making a house out of popsicle sticks. It took me a second to realize this, but when I remembered, it was like going back in time. I could even see myself in the middle of the floor, trying to figure out how to keep the roof on. lol. <br>  <br>  I have no idea why I got the nostalgia. Maybe it was something that smelled like the wood of a popsicle stick or glue.<br>  <br>  I'd rate it a 5, not because the nostalgia lasted a long time, but because it was vivid and very strong as far as most nostalgic experiences go.

VN30ib8eaa	Salam.<br>  <br>  Running away from anything .. is never a solution.<br>  <br>  First of all, you need to realize that, this life is nothing but a test from Allah. Allah created us for a reason and he told us that in the Quran. He also said :<br>  <br>  '' And certainly, We SHALL TEST YOU with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but GIVE glad tidings to As-Sabirin (the patient ones, etc.).''<br>  <br>  2:155<br>  <br>  Second, you need to know of the promise of Allah. Allah never breaks His promises. This is the promise of Him :<br>  <br>  ''.....And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). ''<br>  <br>  65:2 <br>  <br>  ''... And if any one puts his trust in Allah, sufficient is (Allah) for him. For Allah will surely accomplish his purpose: verily, for all things has Allah appointed a due proportion. ''<br>  <br>  65:3<br>  <br>  ''......and whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make his matter easy for him. ''<br>  <br>  65:4<br>  <br>  <br>  Thirdly, you need to know believers NEVER give up. Read Surah Yusuf. When Yousuf (as) was lost, his father Yaqub (as) was upset. He cried a lot as he loved Yosuf (as) a lot, but what did he do? Did he run away? Did he give up?What did he say?<br>  <br>  This is what he said:<br>  <br>  "O my sons! Go you and enquire about Yusuf (Joseph) and his brother, and NEVER give up hope of Allah’s Mercy. Certainly no one despairs of Allah’s Mercy, EXCEPT the people who disbelieve."<br>  <br>  12:87<br>  <br>  Not only it was Yaqub (as). Allah has set this example in each of his favorite slaves life:<br>  <br>  ''And many a Prophet (i.e. many from amongst the Prophets) fought (in Allah's Cause) and along with him (fought) large bands of religious learned men. But they NEVER LOST HEART for that which did befall them in Allah's Way, NOR did they WEAKEN nor degrade themselves. And Allah LOVES As-Sabirin (the patient ones, etc.). ''<br>  <br>  3:146<br>  <br>  <br>  Fourthly, Know that wherever you are , whatever you do, Allah knows whats in your heart. If you did something wrong,  He will forgive you. Its also a promise of Him. He counts every single tear that you drop. He is there to protect you all the time and none loves you more than Him:<br>  <br>  ''And you are not (engaged) in any affair, nor do you recite concerning it any portion of the Quran, nor do you do any work but We are witnesses over you when you enter into it, and there does not lie concealed from your Lord the weight of an atom in the earth or in the heaven, nor any thing less than that nor greater, but it is in a clear book.  <br>  <br>  10:61<br>  <br>  ''Now surely the friends of Allah-- they shall have NO fear NOR shall they grieve.  ''<br>  <br>  10:62<br>  <br>  ''Those who believe and guarded (against evil):  ''<br>  <br>  10:63<br>  <br>   ''They SHALL have good news in THIS world's life and in the HEREAFTER; there is NO CHANGING in the words of Allah(PROMISE); that is the mighty achievement.  ''<br>  <br>  10:64|`|bRLCxmP6aa	Don't confuse depression and sadness - if something very sad or upsetting has happened to you recently, you have to give yourself time to heal and to overcome the sadness. If you are sad about something in particular, remind yourself that it does get better over time, and treat yourself gently for a while. If it persists, or if there is no easily discernable cause for your sadness, then you should seek help.<br>  <br>  Discuss any mood issues with your doctor, to check whether you may be experiencing side effects from medication or something similar. Your doctor can help you to determine whether your depression is mild, moderate, or severe.<br>  <br>  For mild to moderate depression, try to get involved in a sporting activity or some kind of exercise. This will help with stress, too. When you're feeling less stress and your depression starts to abate, your moods will even out. High stress can be a cause of depression, so see if you can get involved in some kind of meditative practice as well - I find that yoga is very helpful in reducing the effects of stress, calming me, evening out my moods, and reducing depression.<br>  <br>  If your depression is moderate to severe, meaning that it interferes with your life or gets in the way of your activities, you should get some counseling and also discuss this with your doctor. You may need some medication to help you to deal with the depression for a while - don't just rely on the medication, though...it's not a cure. You need to address the issues or behaviors that are causing the depression, so the counseling is very, very important. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you - this can and will get better, as long as you take the first steps.|`|FMiCHxHgaa	Chocolate|`|Tledw3eAaa	Grab yourself a kid. If you don't have children of your own, it can be a sibling, a niece or nephew, or even someone you could simply babysit.<br>  <br>  Bring them to your house, and really let your imagination go wild while you play with them. Drag out on old blanket. Turn it into a sailboat, use a hairbrush as a fishing pole, and see who can catch the biggest fish. Turn it into a spaceship, and pretend you are traveling to different worlds, and take turns with the kid describing the color of the tree's and the shape of the clouds. Use it to travel through the jungles on a river, to fly over other countries, etc. Or don't use the blanket. Imagine the two of you are birds, and then figure out what birds talk about when they chirp. Ponder the reason the grass is green and the sky is blue. Decide whether it would be more fun to be an elephant or a bumble bee.<br>  <br>  It may sound stupid... but sometimes if you learn to simply have fun for the sake of having fun, as kids often do, it will lift you up long enough to work out the problems that are bothering you without falling apart.|`|PnE35NZlaa	prayer,exercise,traditional chinese medicine is good.They can get to the root of why your feeling depressed and give you herbs and/or acupuncture to fix it.Theres also many natural remedies out there.<br>  Getting quality sleep is important and so is family<br>  Putting your life on pause and concentrating on healing yourself is a good idea|`|l7UTyy9raa	Put all of your worries aside.

Calamities and disasters are a test for a person, and this is a sign that Allaah loves him, because this is like medicine: even though it is bitter, but still you offer the medicine, despite its bitterness, to the one whom you love; and Allaah’s is the highest description. According to a saheeh hadeeth: “The greatest reward comes from the greatest trial. When Allaah loves people, He tests them, and whoever accepts it gains the pleasure of Allaah and whoever complains earns His wrath. <br>  <br>  Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2396; Ibn Maajah, 4031; classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani. <br>  <br>  For calamities to befall the believer is better than punishments being stored up for him in the Hereafter. How can it be otherwise when he is raised in status and his bad deeds are erased thereby? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When Allaah wills good for His slave, He hastens his punishment in this world, and when He wills bad for His slave, He withholds his sins until he comes with them on the Day of Resurrection.” <br>  <br>  Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2396; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. <br>  <br>  The scholars have explained that the one from whom calamities and trials are withheld is the hypocrite, for Allaah withholds [his punishment] in this world, so as to bring him with all his sins on the Day of Resurrection. <br>  <br>  also u should make a du'aa:<br>  Islam encourages us to make a lot of du’aa’, and not to be hasty in seeking a response. That is because du’aa’ is a great act of worship which is beloved to Allaah. Indeed there are texts which warn us against neglecting du’aa’, because neglecting it is a sign of arrogance. <br>  Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <br>  “And your Lord said: ‘Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your (invocation). Verily, those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness, (Islamic Monotheism)] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!’”<br>  [Ghaafir 40:60] <br>  It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “(The du’aa’) of any one of you will be answered so long as he is not hasty in seeking a response and does not say, ‘I prayed but I have not had a response.’” <br>  Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5981; Muslim, 2735 <br>  It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim who calls upon Allaah with words in which there is no sin or severing of family ties but Allaah will give him one of three things: either He will answer his prayer soon, or He will store it up for him in the Hereafter, or He will remove something bad from him that is equivalent to what he is asking for.” They said, “Then we should make a great amount of du’aa’.” He said, “Allaah is greater.” <br>  <br>  <br>  i ask ALLAH(swt) to give u happiness and joy..amiiin.<br>  btw here's a du'aa for sadness:<br>  Ahmad (3712) narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: <br>  <br>  “If a person who is afflicted by anxiety or sorrow says: ‘Allaahumma inni ‘abduka wa ibnu ‘abdika wa ibn ammatika naasiyati bi yadika maadin fiyya hukmuka ‘adlun fiyya qadaa’uka as’aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw ‘allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw asta’tharta bihi fi ‘ilm il-ghaybi ‘indaka an taj’al al-Qur’aana rabee’a qalbi wa noora sadri wa jalaa’a huzni wa dhahaaba hammi (O Allaah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your female slave, my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You with which You have named Yourself, or, or You have taught to any of Your creation, or You have revealed in Your Book, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Qur’aan the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety)’, then Allaah will take away his anxiety and sorrow, and will replace it with joy.” <br>  <br>  It was said: “O Messenger of Allaah, should we not learn it?” He said: “Yes, whoever hears it should learn it.” <br>  <br>  salam.|`|4aveC2aaaa	besides chocolate, i sleep <br>  <br>  i also read, write<br>  <br>  listen and read Quran

God's commandments always take priority over man-made rulings. The Church cannot yield to civil law in that case because it is in violation of both divine law and Canon Law.<br>  <br>  Again, Canon Law is based on the divine law and works with it, not against it or above it.

They may be confusing you and your question.  The responders will also be bewildered by the same website, without even realizing why.  Whether any newcanons will be applied as disciplinary violations of dogma is a real question.  When Cicognani wrote Canon Law in 1934, the laws applied as described all the way back to the Apostles. The patristic history proves this right on through Gratian and Gregory XIII.  It is now not known except by scholars of what is shown on the website is accurate according to the Code of 1917, which is the only Code.  NewCode has variations in it which do not connect to the Decretals. In at least one instance, Fr. Cekada has discovered that the 1983 Canons are missing completely a reference to the change in the NewMass, one which cannot exist without patristic authority behind it.  It can be concluded soundly that NewMass was altered without any divine authority because it does not appear in the Acta Sedis. <br>  <br>  So, it is bound to us to hold to the Code of 1917, which is trustworthy and to which no new dogma will be added after 1942, the promulgation of the Assumption of Our Lady by Pope Pius XII.  Pope Pius also reformed Holy Week in 1958, or someone did it in his name, which is given in the Code of 1917, addition in Woywod of 1952.  Why do we all know that it might have not been his change?  Because in the last five years of his life, Pope Pius XII was too ill to conduct papal business of any kind, and was bedridden.  Any serious changes could not have been signed by him, according to reports of his illness. Who could have changed it?  And what about the missing Acta recording on the NewMass?  Why isn't it there?  It never happened.|`|XsTJPMHqaa	From what I understand Fire and Hail has it right.<br>  <br>  Canon Law governs Church disciplines, like not eating meat on Fridays or married men not being allowed to be priests. A dispensation can be granted for any Canon Law, and Canon Law can change.<br>  <br>  Divine Law is teaching that the Church has received directly from Christ, such as women not being able to be priests, or what is valid matter for a Sacrament. Divine Law cannot be dispensed and cannot change.<br>  <br>  The two cannot contradict each other, but yes, Divine Law would be higher as it is timeless and of God not of man.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I am Roman Catholic.<br>  <br>  Canon law is written down.  Divine law may not be.<br>  <br>  The statement you quoted says that canon law will recognize civil law,  and that the civil law will have the force of canon law,  unless there is canon law that already contradicts the civil law,  in which case canon law would prevail.   The mention of divine law concerns the fact that not all divine law is considered to be already a part of canon law.   Thus,  a civil law might contradict divine law without explicitly contradicting canon law.<br>  <br>  A civil law can agree with or contradict canon law only if the subject matter of the civil law already is addressed by canon law.    If a civil law arises that is not yet dealt with by canon  law,  there is no immediate contradiction or agreement.  However,  divine law is eternal - it already exists,  even though we may not yet have thought of some specific aspects of it.  If a civil law is enacted that is not immediately addressed by canon law,  reference needs to be made to divine law.  If divine law contradicts the civil law,  then the divine law, of course,  prevails.   In such cases,  canon law likely would be altered to incorporate that part of divine law.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.
KM5MNRJmaa	the Bible doesn't say when you should go to church. instructions were given to the Jews to hold a sabbath on the 7th day (saturday) but no instructions were given to Christians about when they should gather for worship. Jehovah's Witnesses usually hold their meetings on sunday because that's when it's most convenient to the congregation. its really easy to get the time off work.|`|AA10024451	For one....the Bible doesn't say anywhere on what day of the week one has their religious services. For another, you seem to be stuck on and going back to the sabbath requirement, which was part of the old Jewish system of laws and commands, which is something the Christian congregation (from the time it was founded all the way up to today) is NOT required to do.|`|MSHxYrLEaa	can you show me a scripture, please?<br>  <br>  when the bible was written, they went by a certain calender.<br>  <br>  in our time, a day ends, and a new one begins at midnight<br>  <br>  in that time, the new day begun at mid-day.<br>  <br>  that, just messes up our calendars compared to theirs.|`|QyAyQf3Laa	Jehovah's witnesses are a crock basically; a sham. You should beware of organized religions because they are a crock and means of mind control.. the brainwashing and hypocrisy are the worst.<br>  <br>  I speak from personal experience, and their organization is founded by white men who banned Black people because they felt they were too inferior to be members and to have their publications. If this so-called truthful religion is based on the "truth" why then would they ban Black people from it? That is not from God and is not unity.<br>  <br>  Plus their publications all SHOW THE BIBLE CHARACTERS as being white, even pale white in most cases, and in some cases more white than not with Caucazoidal hair texture.<br>  <br>  There is a lot of criminal activity that goes ignored in this organization and the elders and the society headquarters in New York tell you "you''re a murmerer and complainer" for coming forth. Lots of secrecy in child and women's sexual abuses just like the Catholics. Lots of lawsuits and at headquarters they have only one Black token man who is there; the rest are white old men like your grandpa who repeat themselves and change the scriptures, or meaning of them, while changing the END OF THE WORLD FROM 1914, TO 1925, TO 1975, AND ON AND ON...<br>  <br>  They teach that there is only 144,000 coming from only Jehovah's Witnesses throughout the whole world that will go to heaven, and the rest of us have an earthly hope. In my congregation in Oregon, in a very small town a whopping 4 of the heavenly class went to my congregation??? Out of only the miniscule 144,000 worldwide who are the only people going to heaven, FOUR (4) of them were from my tiny town in Oregon? These ones being prejudice and stand-offish from the few Black people that attend the congregation, and pretending to be something that they are not.<br>  <br>  Elders telling us "Well, what do you want me to do about it"!! -- when there is criminal fraud going on in the kingdom hall?? Other elders saying beautiful words, going into their childhoods, and floating away in their words while stating "I don't want anything to do with this situation and I want to wash my hands of it. Go tell Brother such-and-such; isn't he in charge of this"? Then when you go to that elder, he croaks "Well, I gave everything to this one", and then you go to that one, and it's "Oh, Brother such-and-such has this case", and they continue to send you in circles and ignore the abuses letting them go on. Meanwhile the victims continue being abused and the wolves, which are most in the congregation, laugh and continue on in their evil ways.<br>  <br>  The elders pass out a pamphlet and say "Keep peace and JEhovah will take care of everything". Prayer is essential but God continue to show me that my prayers were being hindered because I was not praying in the right way. I was praying and being part of a Satanic cult that is used to ignoring serious criminal offenses and allowing extreme abuses to go on in the organization unattended to, and ignored.<br>  <br>  The hypocrisy and runaround is very prevelent in this organization. The witnesses have a lot of fat mouth but they do not heed what they preach; they don't practice what they preach which makes them the worst hypocrites because they preach that they are the one and only true religion. REALLY I WAS PROUD TO BE A WITNESS AT ONE TIME, BUT NOW I'M LIKE, "WOW WHAT A FOOL I HAVE BEEN. I SHOULD HAVE DONE MY RESEARCH BEFORE I SO BLINDLY ACCEPTED --IN --".<br>  <br>  Here are some sites to do some research for your own good, but you should steer clear of these slobs. They have a lot of fat mouth, but will lie to you at the drop of a dime. They smoke and are porn addicts, yet they will celebrate birthdays and other pagan holidays too. They have no respect for the children or women very much, but only if you are politically correct and in their "click" within their congregation and society headquarters in New York.

In many cases where several congregations meet at the same Kingdom Hall, one or two of those congregations will have their meetings on Saturday instead of Sunday.  We also have mid-week meetings.

myowidoNaa	The first day is believed to be Tishri 1, or Rosh HaShana.  Some say this was the first day of creation, others say it was the day Adam was created.<br>  <br>  You should also be aware that there is a problem with the calendar.  Due to the way the current year was calculated there are several years missing from the calendar, somewhere close to 250 years.  From what I can understand this has something to do with the Persian kings listed in the bible.  There is some confusion over the names of some of them and possibly a few who weren't listed.  The calendar was arrived at by counting backwards from a known point so missing kings = missing years.|`|OzvcaJhYaa	The Hebrew calender begins in Nissan.

AA10304847	Here are some ideas:<br>  <br>  1. go upwind at least 30 miles or more of all major cities or military installations to avoid the radioactive fallout.  <br>  <br>  2. bunkers and shelters will keep you safe from the radioactivity, but can you outlast the nuclear winter and radioactivity above ground?<br>  <br>  3. stock up on 22 and shot gun shells (they're plentiful) the higher calibre will run out, facing the mobs trying to steel your food and water.<br>  <br>  In a 2-megaton explosion over a fairly large city, buildings would be vaporized, people reduced to atoms and shadows, outlying structures blown down like matchsticks and raging fires ignited. And if the bomb were exploded on the ground, an enormous crater, like those that can be seen through a telescope on the surface of the Moon, would be all that remained where a city once had been. <br>  <br>  The detonation of tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that now sit quietly, inconspicuously, in missile silos, submarines and long-range bombers, faithful servants awaiting orders would bring the end of the human species. <br>  <br>  The World Health Organization concludes that 1.1 billion people would be killed outright in such a nuclear war, mainly in the US, Russia, Europe, China and Japan. An additional 1.1 billion people would suffer serious injuries and radiation sickness.

Morals are created by and define society, philosophy, religion, or individual conscience. An example of the descriptive usage could be "common conceptions of morality have changed significantly over time."<br>  <br>  In its second, normative and universal sense, morality refers to an ideal code of conduct, one which would be espoused in preference to alternatives by all rational people, under specified conditions. In this "prescriptive" sense of morality as opposed to the above described "descriptive" sort of sense, moral value judgments such as "murder is immoral" are made. To deny 'morality' in this sense is a position known as moral skepticism, in which the existence of objective moral "truths" is rejected.<br>  <br>  In its third usage, 'morality' is synonymous with ethics, the systematic philosophical study of the moral domain.<br>  <br>  Ethics seeks to address questions such as how a moral outcome can be achieved in a specific situation (applied ethics), how moral values should be determined (normative ethics), what morals people actually abide by (descriptive ethics), what the fundamental nature of ethics or morality is, including whether it has any objective justification (meta-ethics), and how moral capacity or moral agency develops and what its nature is (moral psychology). In applied ethics, for example, the prohibition against taking human life is controversial with respect to capital punishment, abortion and wars of invasion. In normative ethics, a typical question might be whether a lie told for the sake of protecting someone from harm is justified. In meta-ethics, a key issue is the meaning of the terms "right" or "wrong". Moral realism would hold that there are true moral statements which report objective moral facts, whereas moral anti-realism would hold that morality is derived from any one of the norms prevalent in society (cultural relativism); the edicts of a god (divine command theory); is merely an expression of the speakers' sentiments (emotivism); an implied imperative (prescriptive); falsely presupposes that there are objective moral facts (error theory). Some thinkers hold that there is no correct definition of right behavior, that morality can only be judged with respect to particular situations, within the standards of particular belief systems and socio-historical contexts. This position, known as moral relativism, often cites empirical evidence from anthropology as evidence to support its claims. The opposite view, that there are universal, eternal moral truths are known as moral absolutism. Moral absolutists might concede that forces of social conformity significantly shape moral decisions, but deny that cultural norms and customs define morally right behavior.|`|aj5IBTuXaa	"Your species?"<br>  <br>  I guess it would be nice to know what you think YOUR species happens to be.  But that might be asking too much.<br>  <br>  As to morals?  Morals are a learned behavior.

I also had some straight friends that were fine with me being gay, but as I began to date guys and spend more time with my fellow gay crowd I spent less time with my straight friends.

P7phsL52aa	Love is something that can't be defined in words nor actions. It just can't. It's something so unique, that nothing has relevance to it, such as age, gender, race, etc. No matter how people try and define love, it's not correct because everybody has their own definition to love. <br>  <br>  Bottom line, Love is unexplainable.|`|mzIgLo0vaa	love is an action, a force, an energy. just like you put effort into anything you do, it doesn't have to be defined. if you don't believe in love that is perfectly fine. it will be less stress on you because once you "love or fall in love" it becomes this illusion and eventually a mess and someone gets hurt. i believe in love because that's what i know ultimately. human relations aren't always based off love. we connect on different levels and for different reasons. the world seems to believe everything has to be defined and that's where all the confusion comes in.|`|TZgVwGzeaa	It can feel so good or hurt so bad (sometimes both)....that my dear, is love!....LOL|`|hZiwiboRaa	I think that it can either make your life or destroy it.<br>  I'm in love with someone, they don't know, but it's just an amazing feeling<br>  it's indescribable, all the feeling you feel when you are around them,<br>  the anxiety, i can't even speak sometimes he just blows me away.<br>  <br>  That's what i think about it.<br>  : )|`|pcHCLfZkaa	I think I'm afraid LOL. <br>  So many relationships and marriages are ending nowadays, how the hell is it gonna be when I finally do find that 'right one'?

As a mother, the most pure love you can have is for a child and the pain (both physical and emotional) that comes from that is not a burden at all because there is nothing in the world more pure than that kind of love.<br>  <br>  However, when you get into romantic love there are all sorts of things that come with that.  As good as it is that's how bad it is as well.  If you ever get to the point where you can love someone so much that you can become so emotionally attached to them (and I'm fearful of ever being that in love) then it can destroy you if it ends.  If it doesn't end it can be the most fulfilling thing in the world.|`|ye1muYCfaa	i'm worried about love, im usually quite lonely, ive hardly any friends ,i cant make conversation and on to of that im gay.<br>  <br>  im not ashamed about it or anything im just worried, if i cant mmake friends or talk to people then how will i ever find Mr. Right.

Sn0CViR7aa	Hi, Gypsy.<br>  <br>  Yes, I did know that Catholics (like me) compare the Ark of the Covenant with Mary, the Mother of God.  In both cases, the Creator of the Universe is within.  If Jesus is God, and Mary is his mother, then Mary is certainly the Mother of God.<br>  <br>  That Mary is the mother of God is evident from scripture, which Protestants say they not only believe, but claim to be the only source of revelation, forgetting that Jesus established a church to maintain the truth of his teachings.  <br>  <br>  Matt 16:18-19: "And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I  will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven." <br>  <br>  Jesus was talking to Peter, the first leader of the Catholic Church.  Those who claim the authority to overturn the consistent and original teachings of the church Jesus began are making themselves into individual popes, which is why we have 30,000 denominations instead of the single organization Jesus envisioned and authorized.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Bruce|`|AA10192697	IT'S CALLED TYPOLOGY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You assume that you have a greater understanding of our book than some of the greatest theologians of history. We know what the bible says, we wrote it. It is our history book. We reject the heresy of scripture alone, we reject the heresy of faith alone also. You seem to reject a little event in human history we call the incarnation.

"The Blessed Virgin, because she is the Mother of God, is believed to hold a certain infinite dignity from the infinite good which is God." Theologically, Roman Catholic Mariology not only deals with her life, but her veneration in daily life, prayer, and Marian art, music, and architecture; in modern and ancient Christianity throughout the ages.<br>  <br>  Roman Catholic Mariology is ongoing and continues to be shaped not only by papal encyclicals but by the interplay of forces ranging from the writings of the saints to the construction of major Marian churches at the sites of Marian apparitions to children on remote mountains based on sensus fidelium. In some cases, sensus fidelium has in time influenced Marian papal decisions, providing Mariology with a "theology of the people" component that distinguishes it from other parts of formal theology. In terms of popular following, membership in Roman Catholic Marian Movements and Societies has grown significantly in the 20th century.|`|eJMAbtfXaa	My Bible says, WHOSOEVER calls upon the name of Jesus shall be saved.

Not on YA forums.|`|AcLjARwyaa	the new testament is the story of the foundation an ealry formation of ht ekingdom of god/heaven on earth -- the catholic church.  this is what jesus came to do. this is the context of the bible; we are the only ones|`|Bqoydq1Oaa	I admire the fact that you posted this with proper grammar and took the time, without appearing to be shouting<br>  I'm sorry that it's all false and that you misunderstand Catholic teaching. <br>  Mary is just human. She's not a goddess. I hope you know that too. Jesus is her Son as well as her saviour. Catholics believe that. <br>  Mother of God doesn't lessen the importance of God the Father, it shows the importance of Jesus, who IS God. If Mary is not the Mother of God, then you are denying that Jesus is God. <br>  None of the stuff you posted has messed up with my reasoning of Mary.

We also refer to her as the New Eve, Star of the Sea, Mystical Rose, etc. Mary is greater than the Ark of the Covenant, just as she is greater than Eve, a star, a rose, etc.  All are not equal to Mary.

xbCGVdiOaa	I did in my previous life.<br>  <br>  But not in this one.|`|cq6nMsuuaa	Yes! I 'believe' in re-incarnation...but i cannot prove it...but nor can I disprove it. And yes...I believe we have the opportunity to experience everything we need to experience.<br>  <br>  I ask myself this...what would be the point of re-incarnation? to answer this I think you first have to ask yourself....why are we on this earth in the first place? Personally I believe we are here to learn to love. To grow and develop our soul, consciousness or whatever you want to call it. We are also here to make mistakes...because how can you ever learn if you never make a mistake. We are here to experience the unique human condition, love, pain, hate, tranquillity, passion, suffering, compassion, the list is endless...When seen from this perspective, re-incarnation starts to make sense. It is also highly unlikely one can have the complete human experience in a single lifetime, so why not just break it up into many lifetimes?....But then i ask myself...If we do re-incarnate why do we not have clear memories of our previous lives? or even memories of the existence in-between lives? well..what would be the point of this? we would never learn anything new...we would most likely just fall back on our past experiences when faced with life's many difficulties. It is only in the life between lives that we would have the chance to review our lifetimes on the earth...to see what we did wrong and how we could do better next time. <br>  <br>  In answer to your question. ' where are all the extra souls coming from ?'  I would say this...There is a source (call it god or Love or whatever you like) and I think when a soul is born it will go through many, many, many stages of evolution and growth, it will travel through realms that we just cannot possibly imagine, until such time as it is ready to return to the source from which it came. You can also take the idea that a soul will split, perhaps more than just once...I know its hard to imagine that, but take into consideration that we actually leave a small essence of our soul back in the 'afterlife' or 'heaven' (for want of a better term) when we incarnate on earth. So we may also choose to occupy two or maybe more bodies on earth at the same time.|`|BHNlBSf5aa	no, Each human being who has ever lived is unique.|`|kX0T1urdaa	The below link shows what I have learned about reincarnation.<br>  <br>  <br>  Purgatory, Reincarnation, Ghosts<br>  <a href="http://armageddonangelsufos.com/new_page_15.htm" rel="nofollow">http://armageddonangelsufos.com/new_page...</a>|`|BlA60kDVaa	The electricity in your body and your brain must go somewhere.

He has never cheated on me. He was never in remedial classes. In fact, he graduated at the top of his class.

AA12006309	In order to get a sex change you'll have to undergo gender therapy, get a diagnosis, and be referred to a gender reassignment surgeon.  This would also involve hormone therapy.  <br>  <br>  The idea that you want to be a girl with a penis won't work.  Female to male surgery is extremely expensive, costing upwards of $50,000 in some cases.  It's results also leave something to be desired, leaving the patient with an undersized and non-functioning member.  Many surgeons don't perform a vaginectomy, leaving the vagina intact.  Most FtM transsexuals don't undergo reassignment surgery at all, because the results just aren't worth it.<br>  <br>  If you simply want to be a woman with a penis, stick to hard packing and strap-ons.  Surgery at this point just isn't worth it to get parts that don't work and steal your sexual satisfaction from you.|`|3OZgcntfaa	If a condition is not considered "immediately life threatening" or "preventative" a smart surgeon won't touch you until your body has finished growing and forming on it's own. <br>  <br>  To undergo SRS is not an overnight process. To do it safely there are many criteria to meet, and it takes a few years to get from A to B. Getting from A to B isn't the point anyways, it's making you comfortable in your own skin.<br>  <br>  "Getting a penis"... there isn't one way to have that formed. The most commonly understood surgery for that is phalloplasty (that's if you are willing to sacrifice to get size), which is the most expensive and the most likely to fail at some point. The price tag varies based on surgeon, your location, and all sorts of follow up work and rest time (you have to pay the bills while you recuperate, and you likely won't be going to work during that time).<br>  <br>  I'm not entirely sure what you mean by "to be both". If you're looking to only partially transition your body, you'll probably have some more bumps in the road to face.

AyEkA6Flaa	This is so clear.<br>  <br>  You can always tell a guy who loves guys by the eyes.  His eyes are glued to you -- that says something.  And if he quickly looks away when you notice him staring at you, that proves it.<br>  <br>  (I do the very same thing when I find a guy attractive -- gaze at him and then quickly look away if he notices, LOL.)<br>  <br>  And that he hugs you is a very warm, tender sign of affection.  By the way, that is brave of him -- please respond and do likewise.  Don't be afraid to touch this boy.<br>  <br>  Yes, he has a crush on you.<br>  <br>  Say hello to him, find out what his interests are, like, if he enjoys hiking, shopping, going to games or concerts, movies, lunch, whatever.  Find out if he has a hobby and learn about it from him.<br>  <br>  But I'd say, yes, he has an interest in you.|`|1hxcSPYSaa	He might like you, do you like him, why don't you just ask him out and see if it is meant to be, if it dose, you have to invite me to the weeding just because it was all thanks to me!

swkhohjgaa	I agree it looks like no way to answer, but i'll look back for updates.<br>  <br>  Edit: <br>  Well, then welcome to the journey. <br>  <br>  Being transgender is to discover who you are all over again. Some realise there is a differennce between their mind and body early on but hide it. Others later, often in the teens. But the rule is their is no rule.  Everyone is different. You should google transgender you will find many sites to explore where you might fit in. <br>  <br>  Remember that the word transgender is refered to as  both an umbrella term and as a identification in many places. <br>  <br>  What does transgender mean? <br>  Transgender is an umbrella term used to describe people whose gender identity (sense of themselves as male or female) or gender expression differs from that usually associated with their birth sex. Many transgender people live part-time or full-time as members of the other gender. Broadly speaking, anyone whose identity, appearance, or behavior falls outside of conventional gender norms can be described as transgender. However, not everyone whose appearance or behavior is gender-atypical will identify as a transgender person. <br>  <br>  What are some categories or types of transgender people? <br>  Transsexuals are transgender people who live or wish to live full time as members of the gender opposite to their birth sex. Biological females who wish to live and be recognized as men are called female-to-male (FTM) transsexuals or transsexual men. Biological males who wish to live and be recognized as women are called male-to-female (MTF) transsexuals or transsexual women. Transsexuals usually seek medical interventions, such as hormones and surgery, to make their bodies as congruent as possible with their preferred gender. The process of transitioning from one gender to the other is called sex reassignment or gender reassignment. <br>  <br>  Also many transexual people dont care for being refered to as transgender. <br>   <br>  An if you can try to find a gender therapist they can save you a lot of time an money in the long run. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped<br>  <br>  ps, sorry for the typos as a im being rushed on this end.|`|EY0wnkh3aa	Ok I'm just really curious so please tell me, why would you want to change her sexuality??

PjwWWMu4aa	If you don't believe in (any) god you're an atheist. Perhaps I misinterpreted but the way it was phrased it seems that you think atheists don't believe in anything. This is not the case, though, we believe in much - chief among them on here is usually the value of human life and freedom (although atheists come in all political colours - there's only one common denominator).<br>  <br>  However, if you believe there was something that created the universe, but isn't from any particular religion, and doesn't really intervine now, then congratulations! You're a deist.<br>  <br>  But about the religion thing, yeah, they do suck, don't they? I think anti-theist might be a lot closer to the mark than atheist, but you're really after something like "anti-religionist", aren't you. Perhaps that's enough. Anti-religionist?|`|AA11323749	Well, many religions have nothing to do with the bible, so you could be anti-bible and still very religious.<br>  <br>  Atheist typically means not believing in God or any gods.  So if you don't believe in any gods you are atheist, but perhaps that does not include all you want to cover in your self description.<br>  <br>  How about "irreligious"?  You can look that up and see if it matches your descriptive goal.<br>  <br>  How about your opening "hater of religion and what it stands for".  Of course, this means that you sort of have to hate all religions not just ones you know anything about.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	That's sad. You sound so angry. To hate something that much - something you can't even attempt to understand - there must be more to it. Remember religion is a huge part of world culture and has been since the beginning, even pre-historic man. <br>  Whatever has made you this hateful I doubt it has to do with a book you don't even believe in.<br>  The Bible is an extremely complex book. It's not a superficial narrative about good and bad read from start to finish.|`|2LfMvxwBaa	Atheist means that you believe that there is no god. Agnostic means that you are not convinced either way.|`|46e820e9ba704c6776305bf6a1b991efaa	Antichrist.  And there are many.  They are growing in number every day.|`|566cnzTyaa	Agnostic theism, <br>  <br>  also known as Spiritual Agnosticism is the philosophical view that encompasses both theism and agnosticism. Per theism, an agnostic theist believes that the proposition at least one deity exists is true, but, per agnosticism, believes that the existence of gods are unknown or inherently unknowable. The agnostic theist may also or alternatively be agnostic regarding the properties of the god(s) they believe in|`|aff7e6a6dc2c90e42f516817ab2318c1aa	I'm not entirely sure, but your hate for any kind of faith is ignorant alone! I am not for any religion I have faith in those who surround me and in reality that's just trust! <br>  However maybe try to seek higher learning and find happiness for yourself. The negative emotions and your thoughts are only causing brain damage. Seriously look it up! It is true!<br>  Look into other religions and learn ... doesn't mean you have to practice it, just learn of a few to broaden your awareness. <br>  In my learning, we all need something to believe in .. I believe in myself I am awesome and I know it. Now some will say that is just the ego, but now without that ego the soul wouldn't have any power steering in the brain, and the body would turn into a few hundred pounds of lard! <br>  So I say to your ignorant train of thought, wake up and realise who you are and who you want to be. Stop being against something that you don't fully understand and stand for something a bit more solid!|`|b0AvMRqbaa	Balios has the answer.<br>  <br>  Until you figure it out yourself.|`|gQEFy4BVaa	Anti-theist.<br>  If you believe in a god, but not a theistic god, you could also describe yourself as a deist.|`|uJO0MbShaa	Irreligious.

From my experience, my friends and I only joke in regards to masturbation. Girls don't make as many sex jokes since it seems less socially acceptable - it's sort of like the phenomenon of when a guy getting laid he's called a "playa", but when a girl has sex she's called a "sl-t". In both cases, I think it's just about social expectations women set for themselves.|`|a1d7539ac2479c53542542eef301b5dbaa	This is something natural i have friends that is girls and they told me that they masturbated.

People born transsexual can be straight (like me), gay/lesbian, bi or asexual just like everyone else.<br>  <br>  edit:  Maybe the following will help:<br>  <br>  To know a persons sexuality you must know how they identify gender-wise first.<br>  <br>  If a person identifies as female, no matter their surgical status, and they attracted to men, they are straight.<br>  <br>  If a person identifies as female, no matter their surgical status, and are attracted to women, they are lesbian.<br>  <br>  If a person identifies as male, no matter their surgical status, and are attracted to women, they are straight.<br>  <br>  If a person identifies as male, no matter their surgical status, and are attracted to men, they are gay.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Gender identity trumps all.|`|fFmbBRbcaa	i guess i would consider him straight because hes only into women maybe the once had something dangling between there legs but not anymore lol|`|VRsu7c3Paa	Sexual orientation is your attraction to a person's gender and not sex.<br>  <br>  Straight is liking only members of the opposite gender (man/woman).<br>  <br>  Gay is liking only members of the same sex (man/man, woman/woman).<br>  <br>  Somebody who is a transsexual (I'm guessing you mean male to female) is a woman regardless of her past/current physical sex.<br>  <br>  Your friend is straight based on what you've said.|`|W11nQzVPaa	He sounds straight to me!

AA10601065	Does it have to be somebody in the NOW, or can it be an historical person?<br>  <br>  Well, if it has to be somebody now, then I'd want to be Bill Gates. Not because he's rich and created Microsoft, but because he and his wife are very much into supporting many charities through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. They are especially focused on helping schools so children can get better educations, which the kids in this country desperately need.<br>  <br>  As for what I'd do... I'd spend that one day organizing a campaign to run for President in for years. If Bill Gates could do for this country what he's done with Microsoft, then we'd have little or no national debt to worry about!<br>  <br>  Now, if it can be an historical person, then I'd want to be Leonardo DiVinci because he was such a forward-thinker. He devised sketches and drawing for things that weren't actually invented until decades and centuries after he died.<br>  <br>  And what I would do is focus on his ideas and designs about flight and solve the one thing that prevented him from creating the first aircraft so men could fly (I guess that would take all the glory away from the Wright brothers, eh? Oh well). I'd solve the problem of airflow and aerodynamics so he could go on to build a working model of an aircraft that could transport man and make flight possible 600 or so years before the Wright brother did.

vMXk9ohSaa	It is a very good idea to ask for your to-go box at the beginning of a meal.  Put half or more in there, put it aside, then enjoy what's left on your plate without being tempted to eat more than you planned. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about the server.  Just ask for your to-go box when you give the order and dish it up as soon as it arrives. If you are in one of those "fancy-schmancy" restaurants that require the server to box up leftovers, go ahead and ask for your box when you order.  If they don't like it, tuff stuff.  If they "refuse", then ask to see the manager.|`|280PZZA9aa	People in the service industry, such as restaurants, are there to do just that - service.  They shouldn't show their opinions to customers in expressions or words.  There have been many times when I can not eat all the food served to me and don't want it to be thrown out and wasted.  I ask for a box and take it home and eat it later.

(In fact, I think that if there was less attention to 'self-esteem' and more to the 'etiquette' (good manners, not meaningless ritual), the world would be a better place!)<br>  <br>  What you're talking about is that time-honoured institution, the 'Doggie Bag'.  It doesn't matter whether or not you have a dog. Or any other pet. Whatever.  Everyone knows that the "Doggie" in question is the b*tch asking for the bag. And it's NOBODY's business but yours what you plan to do with the contents. (Eat it immediately, or later; throw it at someone who looks at you the wrong way, perform scientific experiments on it; give it to a hungry stray, dig it into the compost heap ....)<br>  <br>  It's part of the server's job to have your leftovers put into a 'Doggie Bag' or, at the very least (depending on the restaurant) to give you  appropriate take-out packaging.  And to do so with the same level of courtesy one would expect of them performing any part of their duties. It's their place, their job, and  a reasonable duty.  They are SERVERS, for heavens' sake, not arbiters of social conduct!! <br>  <br>  There are some people who, unfortunately, have been trained to eat everything on their plate.  Which may explain some of the extreme obesity we see. <br>  <br>  There are others who (because of ignorance, or the belief that conspicuous waste, like "conspicuous consumption" makes them look like they're somebody) feel they must waste what they don't eat.<br>  <br>  Conspicuous waste is never good manners.

Different traits were present in different gene pools and that resulted in different average heights. <br>  <br>  Also many environmental factors such as diet, excercise and lifestyle are also important in determining height. Populations that drink alot of milk and use a great deal of dairy products and consume alot of meat are typically very tall, whereas peoples who dont are typically short. What you eat is crucial for height because vitamins and minerals are basically what builds your bones. <br>  <br>  Look at Europeans. A century ago, being 5'6'' was considered average for a European male. Napoleon was "short" by our standards but his height (roughly 5'5'') was pretty normal. But as their standards of living improved (thanks to slavery and imperialism) their diets improved and they got taller.

The verses about Isa (AS) in the Qur'an are mutashabih verses, most of these Quraniyoon or Qadiyani do not know the Qur'an nor Arabic, so they always misinterpret these verses.  Many who read the aya(3:55) think Isa is dead. People think this because the word 'wafaa' in arabic means 'death', and the word 'tawoofi' means 'he died'. Mistakes like that come because of not knowing the original meanings of the words. I'm sure Mirza Ghulam Ahmad lacked strength in the Arabic language because he made a simple yet major error. A word in english I would compare 'wafaa' to would be 'to' 'two' and 'too', three meanings one sound. In arabic it his hard if not impossible to spell a word three different ways, but the meaning can have three different meanings. The word 'wafaa' is no different. Yes, the word can mean death, but it also can mean 'sleep'. Allah subhana wata'alla in other verses of the quran refers to sleep as 'wafaa'. So you think to yourself does this verse mean death or sleep? Be careful don't stop right there. The third being 'take whole' or 'take completely'. This last meaning is not only the original meaning of the word 'wafaa' but it is a word that is still used today. I mean it can be read in hadith when the prophet told people to pay debts back completely he used to say 'wafee alajaar' or 'pay him in full' or 'pay him completely'. From understanding the words used in the rest of the Ayah and using the original word for 'wafaa' it is clear to anyone that understands arabic the only one meaning truly fits there. The word 'mutawafeeka' in this ayah simply means that Allah will take Isa body and soul, completely to himself(Allah). One must understand when we use the word 'wafaa' for sleep or death, we are using secondary meanings of the word. The origional meaning of the word 'wafaa' is to 'take completely'. "Ith qala Allahu ya A'eesa inee mutawafeeka warafi'auka ilayya wamutah hiruka mina alla theena kafaroo" meaning "Oh Isa, I will take you completely, raise you to me, and purify you from those who disbelieve." There is more evidence of this in Surah Nisa verse 155-158. None of those uses the word 'wafaa', but verse 158 again reiterates that Allah raised Isa to himself.|`|mOWyzwubaa	Our (Muslim) commentators of the Qur’an have blindly followed the Christian traditions to forge such Ahadith. These so-called experts have assigned totally erroneous meaning to “Raf’a” or the raising of the prophets Jesus (3:55) and Enoch (19:56). The Quran absolutely does not portray the raising of these prophets bodily up into the heavens. It describes raising them in honor. The prophecies of the coming of  Messiah have been introduced into our history by non-Muslims. <br>  <br>  by the same argument why wouldnt Prophet Idress come back ! shouldnt Prophet Idress come back again !<br>  <br>  MUFTI SHEIKH MUHAMMAD ‘ABDUH (1849 to 1906)<br>  <br>  The celebrated scholar of Islam, Muhammad Sheikh Abd-e-Rabbuhu of Egypt maintains that the stories of a living Jesus in the heavens and his second coming were inserted into our Ahadith centuries ago by Christian scholars so that Christianity may seem superior to Islam.<br>  <br>  <br>  THE FINAL WORD, AL-QURAN<br>  <br>  3:55 “O Jesus! I will cause you to die of natural causes and I will exalt you in honor and I will clear you of the slander of the disbelievers. —.<br>  <br>  The word Raf’a means honoring or exalting. “Nowhere in the Quran is there any warrant for the popular belief that God has taken up Jesus bodily into heaven.”<br>  <br>  19:56 And make mention of Idris (Enoch) in the Book. Verily, he was a man of truth, a Prophet.<br>  <br>  19:57 And We raised him to a high station of honor.<br>  <br>  Jesus was taken up to the heaven in body is absolutely non-Qur’anic and, therefore, it has no merit.<br>  <br>  21:34 We have never granted everlasting life to any human before you. If you die, can they be immortal?<br>  <br>  3:144 Remember that Muhammad is only a Messenger. The Messengers before him have passed on. So, if he died or were slain, would you turn about on your heels?<br>  <br>  This verse makes clear that Jesus too has died. He has passed away and was not raised to the heavens. When Muhammad  died not one of his companions complained why he was not raised to heaven like Jesus and Idrees.<br>  <br>  5:3 This Day, I have perfected your DEEN for you, completed My favor upon you, and chosen for you Islam as the System of Life.<br>  <br>  6:115 Perfected is the Word of your Lord in Truth and Justice.

And He is the Profound Hearer, the Knower.<br>  <br>  Hence, no further Divine revelation, no further messenger or ‘promised one’ is to come.<br>  <br>  33:40 Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, but he is Allah’s Messenger and the Closing Seal of all Prophets.

There's no such thing.<br>  <br>  1.     Please read to what wrote by Kingswood, Surrey, in the Book "The Faiths Men Live" in 1955, page 81.<br>  <br>  "It is more read than any other book in the world. The Christian Bible may be the best seller, but nearly 250 million followers of the Prophet Muhammad read or recite long sections of Alcoran five times a day, every day of their lives, from the time they can talk".<br>  (Now the followers of Muhammad is 900 million).<br>  <br>  2.     Now read this from the Reader's Digest written by James A Michner, "Islam-The Misunderstood Religion", in the Reader's Digest (American edition) for May, 1955.<br>  <br>  "The  Koran was revealed to Muhammad between the years 610 and 632 in the cities of Mecca and Medinah. Devoted scribes wrote it down on 'scraps of paper, bark, and the white shoulder blades of animals'. The early revelations were dazzling assurances that there was only one God, Merciful and Compassionate: He is Allah, the Creator, the Maker, the Fashioner. Whatever is in the Heavens and earth declares His Glory: and He is the Mighty, the Wise'.<br>  <br>  __________________<br>  <br>  At about 52 years ago, None Muslims had discuss on Al-Qur'an. "The Quran is probably the most often read book in the world, surely the most often memorised, and possibly the most influential in the daily life of the people who believe in it.

4Rt7Mm8Aaa	Our devotion and love to the prophet can be illustrated in two ways. One is to emulate every action, and perspective of the prophet Muhammed Sallalahualayhiwassalam, to the extent that one is easily recognized as the follower of the prophet Muhammed Sallalahualayhiwassalam. The second is that whenever the opportunity arises, the prophet’s life, sunnah, and the beauty of Islam should be brought up. <br>  <br>  An example can be seen of Umar’s RA son. He had such a respect and love for the prophet’s life, that when he went for Hajj, he repeated all the actions of the prophet Muhammed Sallalahu Alayhiwassalam. He would rest where the prophet rested, relieved himelf where the prophet relieved himself, rested where he rested.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Salaf us Salihoon (pious predecessors) never implemented Milad Un Nabi after his death, nor did the prophet ever celebrate his birthday in his life. They didn’t celebrate his birth by just implementing Islam in one day, but for everyday of their lives.<br>  <br>  As time passed, the masses, and people became weak in faith, and as such, they decided to have a day to remind themselves of the responsibilities of being a Muslim, and how to gain Allah’s pleasure.<br>  <br>  Alhumdulillah, this ummah never fell into complete degeneracy, one will find those people that implement every sunnah. However, regretfully, there are very few like this.<br>  You will find that these people that go to these gatherings to celebrate the life of the prophet, yet their lives do not reflect an iota of Islam. Thus, their claim of love is hollow and transparent.<br>  <br>  When we do not practice on Islam, it causes pain to the prophet Muhammed Sallalahualayhiwassalam. <br>  <br>  In the year 604 after Hijrah, the first formal of the day of Milad Un Nabi was established by Sultan Abu Saeed Muzaffer, and Abdul Khitab Ibne Wahiyah.<br>  <br>  In the year 604 after Hijrah, the first formal of the day of Milad Un Nabi was established by Sultan Abu Saeed Muzaffer, and Abdul Khitab Ibne Wahiyah.<br>  Special care was taken care of the following things, the specification of it being the 12 of rabbiulawwal. They distributed food, with the intention to gain reward for feeding the Muslims, and they wanted to send the blessing of such an action to send the blessings upon the prophet. On the surface, this is nice, but in reality, this is a form of bidat because there was never a set day for miladunnabi and it is not mandatory to celebrate it, hence, due to the fact that it was specified for a day, and also because it was considered mandatory, then this is an innovation because it was never practiced or done by either the prophet or the sahabah. And the prophet would have been the first to practice upon it if it were virtuous. <br>  <br>  The problem here boils down to the intention, if one considers it mandatory, and necessary, and due to the conditions of these gatherings by specifying dates it becomes an innovation in deen. Also today, many of these celebrations contain sin, such as dancing, music, loose clothing, free mixing of sexes, and also the fact that they go late into the night, hence making them unable to awaken for Fajr. Additionally, people think that attending these organizations is mandatory, and a source of blessing, and not attending these is a source of sin, and label those that do not attend is a cause of being labelled the ‘enemies of the prophet’.<br>  <br>  And this has only taken root 6 centuries after the prophet of Islam passed away to have developed this practice. Hence from this logic, are the sahabah wrong and enemies of the prophet for not partaking or establishing these practices? Of course not, calling them as such is illogical to the extreme, as they are the best of the generation. So then why is the worst of the generation making up a new practice in order to become closer to Allah like the best of our Ummah. Islam was completed on the plains of the Hajjatul Wadah. Anything after this is innovation and bid’ah.<br>  <br>  If Islam considered the birth of pious scholars, and great Muslim personalities as a day of celebration, then everyday would be considered as a religious observance due to the great amounts of people of note in Islam.<br>  <br>  According to one narration, Islam boasts 200,000 prophets. Were we to celebrate the birth of these people, without implementing their lives, the ummah would not progress forward, rather it would regress.<br>  <br>  If you look at the history of Islam, Islam was progressing until the 6th century when this practice became vogue. After this, Islam experienced its first great defeat against the Christians. And it was also around this time that internal strife became part of the Muslim Ummah. From the seventh century onwards, Ulama have labelled the Milad as being an innovation.<br>  <br>  The hadith that says “Don’t make my grave an eid”. Yet in some countries, they have added into an already complete deen, a third eid, the mildunnabi. This is a disgusting innovation into Islam.|`|UxYkISitaa	kullu bid'atun dalaala wa kullu dalaalatun fin naar.<br>  <br>  every innovation is a misguidance and every misguidance is in hell fire<br>  <br>  <br>  i dont celebrate it...but many people do..they say...is it wrong to be happy on that day cuz Allah sent his mercy on this day...but wateva its all krapp according to me.|`|nS7koC7Oaa	Never, every Bid'ah is a misguidance and every aberration is in Hell wal Iyathu billah,,<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  sister, Miladul-Nabi (saw) never been celebrated by the Sahaba or the Tabi'een, thus it's an innovation and the Prophet (saw) said that every Bid'ah is Dalaalah, and every Dalaalah is in Hell :)|`|77AJmExlaa	he didnt celebrate it nor  his  companions|`|gyrihMqhaa	PROPHET Muhammad (saww):<br>  <br>  CELEBRATING EID AL-MILAD<br>  <br>  <br>  ‘Eid’ means festival and ‘Al-Milad’, which originates from ‘Wiladah’ in Arabic, is in reference to the birth of Prophet Muhammad (saww). There are a lot of arguments going on about celebrating ‘Eid al-Milad’. Some Muslims Scholars – particularly those of Wahhabi School of Thought have condemn this openly and have declared it as ‘Bid’ah’ meaning innovation; whereas others, who are in majority, and popularly referred to as Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama’ah insist that there is nothing wrong in celebrating this great day. The Shia’hs believe and support the celebration of Eid al-Milad too.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Among the objectives of celebrating the birth of Prophet Muhammad (saww) are:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  - To remember the historical events, which took place during his birth time<br>  <br>  - Remind ourselves of his noble Seerah (character) in all aspects of life & revive his Sunnah (traditions)<br>  <br>  - Send Salawaat upon him as commanded by Allah (SWT) as many times as possible and earn its spiritual rewards<br>  <br>  - Take this as an opportunity to convey others about the message he (saww) brought for the entire mankind<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It is proven in the Holy Quran that celebration of Milad of noble and God-fearing personalities is a praise-worthy act.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Allah (SWT) says: “Certainly We sent Moses with Our signs: Bring your people out from darkness into light and remind them of Allah’s (holy) days. There are indeed signs in that for every patient and grateful (servant)”. (14:5)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In this verse Allah (SWT) orders Prophet Musa  to remind his nation about the days of Allah, the Almighty. "The days of Allah" are those days in which great events took place or Allah; the Almighty bestowed His great favours and rewards to His creatures. The example is then cited in the verse that follows:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  “When Moses said to his people: ‘Remember Allah’s blessings upon you when He delivered you from Pharaoh’s clan who inflicted a terrible torment on you, and slaughtered your sons, and spared your women and in that, there was a great test from your Lord”. (14:6)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Emancipation of the nation of Prophet Musa  from Pharaoh is a day of Allah. The birthday of Prophet Muhammad (saww) is also, without any doubt, a day of Allah, because Prophet Muhammad (saww) emancipated the whole world from the darkness of ignorance and brought them to the light of guidance.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  “Allah certainly favoured the faithful when He raised up among them an apostle from among themselves to recite to them His signs and to purify them, and to teach them the Book and wisdom, and earlier they had indeed been in manifest error”. (3:164)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Holy Prophet Muhammad (saww) celebrated his own Milad by way of fasting. When the Prophet of Allah (saww) was asked about the fast of Monday. He (Allah's Grace and Peace be upon him) said: "I took birth and the Quran was revealed upon me in this day." (Mishkat Sharif, Page 179)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This narration proves that to celebrate Milad al-Nabi is a tradition of the Holy Prophet (saww) on every Monday. Secondly it is lawful to fix a particular day for Milad al-Nabi (saww). Thirdly it is an act of Sunnah to worship (fast) whilst celebrating Milad al-Nabi (saww).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  On the joyous occasion of the birth of Prophet Muhammad (saww), we extend our heartiest greetings and felicitations to Imam al-Hujjah (AJ) and to all Muslims.

They loved the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) far more than we do, yet despite that they did not celebrate this day. Hence we do not celebrate this day, in obedience to the command of Allaah Who has commanded us to follow the commands of His Prophet. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <br>  “And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it)” [al-Hashr 59:7] <br>  And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah [way] and the way of the Rightly-Guided khaleefahs. Adhere to it and cling tightly to it. And beware of newly-invented matters [in religion], for every newly-invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is a going-astray.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Sunnah, 3991; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, no. 3851). <br>  The extent to which a person loves the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is to be seen in how he follows him with regard to all that he commanded or forbade. That includes following him in not celebrating the day on which he was born. See question no. 5219, 10070. <br>  Whoever wants to venerate the day on which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was born should follow the alternative that is based on Islamic evidence, which is that one should fast on Mondays, not just the day that he was born but every Monday. <br>  It was narrated from Abu Qutaadah al-Ansaari (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked about fasting on Mondays. He said, “On that day I was born and on that day the Revelation came to me.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1978). On Thursdays deeds are taken up and shown to Allaah. <br>  Conclusion: celebrating the Prophet’s birthday was not prescribed by Allaah or by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so it is not permissible for the Muslims to celebrate his birthday, in obedience to the command of Allaah and the command of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). <br>  We ask Allaah to guide you to the Straight Path. <br>  And Allaah knows best.<br>  Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid<br>  so its a bid'aa....<br>  <br>  salam.|`|hl6lDPvDaa	Do you know how Muslims celebrate Milad-e-Nabi? <br>  <br>  by remembering Prophet Muhammad(pbuh) and thanking him for showing us the way to success. <br>  <br>  We don't go out n cut the cake and sing happy birthday to Prophet Muhammad(pbuh). <br>  <br>  We celebrate it by remembering Allah & his Prophet(pbuh) and dustribute sweets and candies among kids. All shias and sunnis do that.<br>  <br>  Tell me what is Bidah in doing that?<br>  <br>  ______<br>  <br>  BTW, saying RA after sahabas is a Bidah too, cause Prophet never told us to say RA after the names of companions and neither did any sahaba say RA after each others name.|`|be059bdf4ef4d8d4f864f42d17a8e06eaa	Yeah.

He is incomparable and is nothing compared to His creations. <br>  <br>  Allah is the only God. There is no god apart from Allah. That means, only Allah could have made mankind and the earth, moon, sun and stars. Allah is the only One who created all these.<br>  <br>  Of course, you know that many things on earth just work by themselves. For example, when you put seeds in the earth and wait a few months, plants will grow out of them. To put the seeds in the earth is easy, but there is an important question you must ask yourself: Where do we get the earth and from where do we take the seeds? You may say that the seeds can be taken from other plants, and you would be right. But just think: those other plants also need earth to grow in, so where does the earth come from?<br>  <br>  Educate the children about Allah by using Qur'an and Hadiths. Also use the concept of the universe. He is the creator of the universe, and we will return to Him in the hereafter. There are various stories in the Qur’an itself which include the biography of Allah.  Try being easy on the education and let the children learn through stories and step by step storyboards. Kids love bright colours and eye catching headlines. Try to make education more enjoyable but at the same time, instructive.|`|1ICX0JlAaa	Asalaamu alaikum,<br>  Ameen wayyaki.

Well, to be honest, Left 4 Dead and 28 Days Later have the zombie idea down better than most every other zombie thing out there... thing is, zombies couldn't be literally "walking corpses", they would be some kind of infection that decays parts of the brain causing the human to see any moving, living creature as it's prey, and remove the logic to plot out a strategical attack against it... causing the "zombie" to sprint at whatever the victim is, with no caution to consequence, and devour it.<br>  <br>  What's the chance? Really, really low. A disease like that, completely unnatural (it's never happened before, has it?) would have had to be caused by humans... if scientists wanted to create a "zombie", they could sit in a lab for years with hundreds of human test subjects and eliminate key parts of the brain until the subject acts like a zombie from Left 4 Dead... but nobody has the time, the patience, or the freedom to do something like that. Plus, it has no benefit. If someone tried to create a cure and a "zombie" was the side effect... the cure/vaccination would be so intricate, it wouldn't be possible to create for hundreds of years.<br>  <br>  So to be perfectly honest, a zombie apocalypse couldn't happen for... at least a long time. But, I hope you see, that it is completely possible.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  Hey, email me sometime if you like talking about this kind of stuff... tell me what you'd do in a zombie apocalypse.|`|bNu2acRbaa	NO!!! that's why they're in FICTIONAL stuff like games and stories. its just comon sense, i think you already knew that they weren't real.....|`|A2nKiMsuaa	If you truly believe they are real, then perhaps they are.

These days, I suppose you'd have to qualify "casual" with "dressy".<br>  <br>  ("Semi-formal" and "cocktail attire" aren't what you want.

AA11287806	I think it is a matter of perspective.  There have always been 'gay' as well as 'straight' people.  All that has happened is the family unit has broken down and fractured into all sorts of variants.  The short of it being more people live alone, even within their family units.  Therefore the stereotype of what a gay lifestyle appears to be can seem appealing and also inspire jealousy.  As it appears to be carefree, financially independent  and a 'better off' lifestyle in terms of money and opportunities open to a person.<br>  <br>  However the reality is vastly more complicated and open to interpretation.  If I were to be honest there are alot more 'greys' to peoples lifestyles and sexualities there might appear to be the case, therefore meaning the sharp division between 'gay' or 'straight' isn't so sharp and that unsettles alot of people.|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	There is no rise in Gay lifestyle<br>  <br>  Where are your figures for this claim?|`|6SwaWSoyaa	The rise of homsoexuals isn't really a rise.

jN5SXl5Caa	I would agree with you but in the sense that the religion does not preach good things. I would say the other religions are "real" because they teach you to do good deeds for your earth and fellow humans. They teach you to put yourself last and to become a community. I always saw all religions as having some good points, how people use them I disagree with. Scientology though is just as unbelievable to me as christianity or Islam. They are all very out there stories, with people from the sky coming down. But were the disconnect happens is there is no lesson to scientology. Every Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, Jewish story is a parable with a meaning and lesson. Scientology is , as you said a corporation a money maker. No religion, in my eyes, should ever ask for money. If your religion is teaching the right things people will donate, not because they have to but because they want to. I feel every religion has it's short comings but this one has more than most. And I hate tom cruise because he uses his religion to tell people all the bad they do and wrong decisions they are making. Instead of helping them to make the right decisions by example. Which no modern religion does.|`|AA10985325	No.... but there's definitetly something very obvious about you and your intent behind you're rant,  thinly disguised as a "question".<br>  <br>  My answer to your question is based on facts  from personal observation and experience , the rest is purely  my opinion.|`|0c44db9bf3337a894a67a66af6d2192baa	I agree with you!

Not the just the fact that L. Ron Hubbard was a crappy sci-fi writer and thief.<br>  <br>  But really? Christianity, Judaism, and Islam don't receive ANY money?<br>  <br>  Umm...have you seen the Cathedrals in Europe, Mosques like the Dome of the Rock,  or the massive totally technologically decked out churches, or televangists? If those churches were REALLY doling ALL that cash out to help the poor, we probably wouldn't have any poor people in this country!<br>  <br>  "I'm calling them real, because they are widely accepted" I've heard this argument so many times, and it simply doesn't hold water for me.<br>  <br>  Just because they are popular, and been around doesn't make them right!|`|gQEFy4BVaa	You can't ask people to 'back off Christianity and Islam' since your question is based on your opinion that these religions are more valid than Scientology.<br>  Does the requirement of money negate it from being a valid religion? No it doesn't, you are only speaking from the perspective of your own religion. <br>  Although, it does say in the Bible that Christians should give 10% of their money to the church.. and come on, televangelism?

It trivializes God and is a bad influence on it's target audience of teenagers.<br>  <br>  The idea behind Scientology charging so much for it's services, which people don't have to pay for, is to use it to expand the church worldwide in order to save the planet. The church is non-profit. Hubbard probably didn't steal the money, the church has the belief that productive people deserve to be rewarded for it, and since he is the church's founder, he may have been paid a lot of money, I wouldn't say it was 200 million, and the IRS probably said that anybody getting paid from the church is illegal since the church is supposed to be non-profit. <br>  <br>  Hubbard was always in hiding because the govt or the psychs were always trying to kill him, and he wouldn't die from a drug overdose, which to me sounds like a rumor.

DTog0VZWaa	Your own quote answers the question.  The high priest is cleaning out mistakes made by some followers.<br>  <br>  The Tanakh & Jewish holidays have many examples of straying from the path & coming back.  Do you think it was easy in Temple days to say focused when surrounded by peoples worshipping pagan Gods of all sorts?  The idea of monotheism & an ABSTRACT God is relatively new at that time --- & considered as odd as declaring that the earth circles the sun & is not the center of the universe.  <br>  <br>  You had to "dare to be different" in order to be Jewish.  Of course people were tempted to add a few of the other local Gods.  Especially in those days at the risk of not surviving if you didn't worship the right or powerful enough Gods.    After all rain & fertility & day to day survival was thought to depend on it by -everyone-.  (A little Pascal's wager maybe?  That's kind of the sense I've gotten when I've read it.)|`|z74a7wvlaa	The jews were pagan even at the time of Abraham. Terah, ABraham's father is a pagan. It is only Abraham who knows God, thus God made a covenant with him to the be father of ALL nations.<br>  Remember Rachel/Rebeccas who stole the idol of her father. In  2 Maccabee 2:40-46,  <br>  40 And they found under the coats of the slain, some of the donaries of the idols of Jamnia, which the law forbiddeth to the Jews: so that all plainly saw, that for this cause they were slain. <br>  12 41 Then they all blessed the just judgment of the Lord, who had discovered the things that were hidden. <br>  12 42 And so betaking themselves to prayers, they besought him, that the sin which had been committed might be forgotten. But the most valiant Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves from sin, forasmuch as they saw before their eyes what had happened, because of the sins of those that were slain. <br>  12 43 And making a gathering, he sent twelve thousand drachms of silver to Jerusalem for sacrifice to be offered for the sins of the dead, thinking well and religiously concerning the resurrection. <br>  12 44 (For if he had not hoped that they that were slain should rise again, it would have seemed superfluous and vain to pray for the dead,) <br>  12 45 And because he considered that they who had fallen asleep with godliness, had great grace laid up for them. <br>  12 46 It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	The Hebrews had not as yet decided to distinguish themselves from their neighbors and pick only one god.

The latter portions of Ecclesiastes reflect his repentance and return.<br>  All of these stories of straying to follow the false gods of others also illustrate the fact that there have always been and shall always remain at least a remnant who have not strayed, or that it is always possible to choose sincere repentance and return.  This is the importance of those stories, and what has given the faithful Jews strength to know, throughout every effort to destroy our faith and covenant, that it truly is eternal despite all odds and failed efforts, even if we stray, we can return.  Read all of Jeremiah, that's a great book in context to display the eternal nature of the covenant.<br>  The book of Ezekiel also records another time when people in Israel adopted the idolatrous beliefs of those around them. He referred to Tammuz worship.  Tammuz, an ancient nature deity whose worship originated in Babylonia. A god of agriculture and flocks, he personified the creative powers of spring. He was loved by the fertility goddess Ishtar, who, according legend, was so grief-stricken at his death that she contrived to enter the underworld to get him back. According to another legend, she killed him and later restored him to life. These legends and his festival, commemorating the yearly death and rebirth of vegetation, corresponded to the festivals of the Phoenician and Greek Adonis and of the Phrygian Attis. The Sumerian name of Tammuz was Dumuzi. In the Bible his disappearance is mourned by the women of Jerusalem (Ezek. 8.14).<br>  <br>  Hmm Man/god born of virgin dies and Ishtar resurrects him in the spring...Ishtar ( Easter) spring resurrection...striking isn't it?<br>  <br>  Sunrise services in honor of Tammuz and praying for his resurrection is an ancient heathen custom. It is actually described and condemned in the book of Ezekiel.<br>  <br>  12. And He said to me, "Have you seen, son of man, what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness, each one in his paved chambers? For they say, 'The Lord does not see us; the Lord has left the earth.' "<br>  13. And He said to me, "You will yet see again greater abominations that they are doing."<br>  14. And He brought me to the entrance of the gate of the house of the Lord that is to the north, and behold there the women were sitting, weeping for Tammuz.<br>  15. And He said to me, "Have you seen, son of man? You will yet see again greater abominations than these."<br>  16. And He brought me to the inner court of the house of the Lord, and behold, at the entrance of the Temple of the Lord between the porch and the altar, about twenty- five men, their backs to the Temple of the Lord and their faces toward the east, and they were prostrating themselves eastward to the sun.<br>  17. And He said to me, "Have you seen, son of man? Was it [too] trivial to the house of Judah to prevent them from performing the abominations that they have done here? For they have [already] filled the land with violence, and repeatedly provoked Me, and behold they send disgrace into their nose. <br>  18. I too, shall act with fury; My eyes will not spare, neither will I have pity, and they will call into My ears with a loud voice, but I shall not listen to them."<br>  <br>  This was a warning prior to the destruction of the FIRST Temple. The Second Temple was destroyed just after another man/god was being worshipped in Jerusalem. Coincidence?<br>  <br>  This terrible lesson was not lost on the faithful of Isarel who have always rejected such impositions into Torah.<br>  <br>  Belief in a savior man/god whose blood and death atoned for the sinful nature of his people was common to many in the Levant. Original sin, meaning to be born with a burden of sin is also  foreign to Torah and Judaism.<br>  <br>  Polytheistic peoples of the ancient world were used to their political leaders telling them what gods were to be venerated during their rule and which deity their ruler was representative of in human form. Adding a new deity or giving a new name to an ancient deity whose belief was already established was not that big a deal for most of the Gentile population. Tanakh recorded that any time such a practice of a Jewish king telling the Jews that they were to worship a foreign deity...the entire Jewish people suffered..and most often at the very hands of the people whose deity they had left God to serve!  That lesson is told right in our Jewish Bible, the same one the Christians have as an adaptation of their Old Testament, yet they rarely see this in the story because their New Testament also imposes topsy-turvy meaning to the context of the stories in so many places.<br>  Christians did not want their flock to know the Paschal lamb represented a false man-god of Egypt, so they changed it into a sacrifice for sin to justify human sacrifice (or deicide depending on whether or not they are calling Jesus God in human form). Rather than his blood expiating sin, the blood on the door was an act of defiance showing the Egyptians that the life force (blood) representing their deity was spilled by the Hebrew slaves and their god was powerless over the God of Israel to do a thing about it. It was an act of rejection of the gods of Egypt and alliance to the God of Israel, and that’s in the Torah in Exodus in context. Rather than show that Isaiah was slamming a man for calling himself a man/god, Christian dogma personifies and makes a proper name for their Latin translations word for star and turns that story into something about a fall of angels (no where mentioned in that narrative at ALL) and justifies creating of the "name" Lucifer for a demi-god of the underworld Devil. (That isn’t in the Tanakh but fits the underworld described in Plato’s narrative recalling the ancient the Myth of Er) Every aspect of Jewish belief is given a new spin. <br>  Things that I once thought must have been fabricated outright I later discovered were beliefs of the ancient Greeks and Romans. This was the longstanding battle for souls going on..the Hellenized Jews, those who had become apostate to Judaism, desired to entice other Jews to worship as the Greeks that they believed superior in philosophy and knowledge, so they created texts that tried to say..see this is what it was supposed to have been all along. However, reality was that those beliefs were identical to the beliefs and practices that the Torah demonized <br>  Once one begins an in-depth study of the religious practices and beliefs of all the peoples surrounding the Jews in the centuries just preceding the beginning of Christianity, one can see these developments take place. It was a concerted effort to do away with Israel and Judaism. <br>  The New Testament demonizes the Pharisees, the sect of Judaism whose tenets actually agree more with the “quotations” of Jesus, and barely mentions the Sadducees, the Hellenized Roman collaborators…and also removes the blot of crucifixion of Jewish rebels from the Romans onto the Jews to demonize the Jews.<br>  I think that your attempt here BACKFIRED in a MASSIVE manner here, as there is nothing in context to support it EVER being acceptable to God in the Tanakh when pagan or idolatrous elements of worship were forced or enticed to Israel. <br>  The fact that Judaism has ALWAYS and CONTINUES to REJECT Pagan and idolatrous elements of worship is also the single most important refutation of your spurious claim.<br>  Shalom :)|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	The Jews were regularly disobedient to God and fell into all kinds of idol worship. It is no wonder that judgment fell upon them so frequently in the Old Testament. <br>  <br>  Read Hosea... It's an expose' on God's faithfulness, as opposed to Israel's.

That is a quote from the inspired Word of God, which teaches that Jesus is the only path to God.

This is no way to guarantee that a person will be morally 'good' when no one is looking. Rather, quite the reverse is likely, because there is built up a "if nobody saw it, it didn't happen" moral mentality.<br>  <br>  2. This kind of forced moralizing leads to repression, which IMHO is the most virulent of neuroses. I consider repression to be a psychological 'force' which carries with it 'counter-force'. When this force is triggered, it can manifest itself in all kinds of dangerous and unpredictable ways (to distinguish it from a physical force).|`|zefFTf8Aaa	karl, these verses are for you.<br>  Purgatory <br>  Mt 5:48 - be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect <br>  Heb 12:14 - strive for that holiness without which cannot see God <br>  Jam 3:2 - we all fall short in many respects <br>  Rev 21:27 - nothing unclean shall enter heaven <br>  Jam 1:14-15 - when sin reaches maturity gives birth to death <br>  2Sam 12:13-14 - David, though forgiven, still punished for his sin <br>  Mt 5:26 - you will not be released until paid last penny <br>  Mt 12:32 - sin against Holy Spirit unforgiven in this age or next <br>  Mt 12:36 - account for every idle word on judgment day <br>  2Macc 12:44-46 - atoned for dead to free them from sin <br>  1Cor 3:15 - suffer loss, but saved as through fire <br>  1Pet 3:18-20; 4:6 - Jesus preached to spirits in prison <br>  2Tim 1:16-18 - Paul prays for dead friend Onesiphorus <br>  1Cor 15:29-30 - Paul mentions people baptizing for the dead|`|kX0T1urdaa	Acts of charity should not need bribes to get people to give.

I'm a non believer, and I go out and do the exact same good things as a believer and I only get to get to purgatory. That's like if I do community service out of the goodness of my heart and I get a million dollars and you do the same community service out of the goodness of your heart and they say ok well your reward is we will only put you in jail not prison and you will only have to be there a week. Also in the middle ages when they did this it led to the church becoming super rich and corrupt No where in the bible does it say that money gets you into heaven. "Give to ceaser what is ceasers and give to god what is god". Not "give the church money and give the church money". The church is still trying to separate the wash from the unclean. I feel my good deeds hold just as much weight as a catholics.

yDBkQG8maa	Nope. Well, scientifically, we get menstrual cycle to produce offspring. <br>  <br>  However, there are Islamic perspectives on this. We cannot fast or pray when we are on period, and when it has ended, we must make "Ghusl", a shower. <br>  <br>  We cannot have intercourse during this because it is harmful for women. <br>  <br>  You may have heard that having intercourse during period can ease cramps, but that's not true.

You cannot touch Qur'an because Qu'ran is pure and you are impure, so there is no sense of touching it.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Also, when women have given birth, and she gets period for 40 days, then she is not required to pray or fast or having sex.<br>  <br>  After 40 days, she must make Ghusl, but (this is what I heard...I may be wrong) if the period continues for a long time, then she can have sex....but I am not sure exactly.|`|7ACD6yDraa	No prayer while a girl's on her period|`|IxoBFCpTaa	We believe menstruation to happen for the scientific reason, not a religious one.<br>  <br>  One rule we have is that there is no sex during a woman's menstruation period as it is forbidden.

d0600880a83eef4da79264e4dc7c8f12aa	At the time of the Edomite revolt in the tenth century B.C.E., Libnah also rebelled against Judean King Jehoram. (2Ki 8:22; 2Ch 21:10) In 732?B.C.E., Assyrian King Sennacherib’s army moved from Lachish to Libnah. He had sent a military detachment from Lachish to threaten Jerusalem. While at Libnah, the Assyrians received reports that Tirhakah the king of Ethiopia intended to fight them. Therefore, Sennacherib, to encourage Jerusalem’s surrender, sent messengers a second time with intimidating letters to Hezekiah the king of Judah. Subsequently Jehovah’s angel slew 185,000 of the Assyrian host, apparently still encamped near Libnah.—2Ki 19:8-35; Isa 37:8-36.<br>  <br>  A son of King Sennacherib of Assyria. Adrammelech and his brother Sharezer killed their father while he was bowing down at the house of his god Nisroch at Nineveh. They then escaped to the land of Ararat, apparently in the location of ancient Armenia in the mountainous region to the W of what is now known as the Caspian Sea. (2Ki 19:35-37; Isa 37:36-38) An inscription of Esar-haddon, another son of Sennacherib, relates that as his father’s successor he engaged and defeated the armies of his father’s murderers at Hanigalbat in that region.|`|3WJi9zLsaa	are you serious? should I start from verse 1 or 37? be more specific...<br>  <br>  summary: god is ticked off at the assyrian king for thinking he could just kill Gods chosen and then He tells hezekiah not to fear cos God will protect the city.. and he does... so he punishes the assyrian king for his pride and saves the day for his chosen people!<br>  <br>  WOW!!! i love God and His word!

Firstly, no one knows when the next step in life may render them paralyzed by a speeding motorist, cancer is diagnosed, ALS, a heart attack, or stroke, or some other malady strikes them down. It is a natural instinct for humans to utilize their free will, so having to depend on others is a primary effort in any such circumstance, however, that is because they've already lost "power," independence per se.<br>  <br>  Generally, people who are not marginalized by health conditions, or economic concerns, etc. are not highly concerned about independence, because their self-esteem is sufficient.<br>   <br>  The US is trying to move forward with "Money Follows the Person" so that people may merely request to be kept out of or move out of institutional care, assisted living, nursing homes, state institutions, etc. because the U.S. Supreme Court in 1999, reviewing the Americans Disability Act rendered the Olmstead Decision, (also considering a court case) and found out it was far less costly all around for people to be cared for out of institutions (all the former above). Thus, now, in most states everyone, anyone, can request to be on "home health care" and be at home, or in a rented residence (apartment, etc), to help them be more independent, and healthier all around.<br>  <br>  Much of "independence" is psychological, and everyone must be aware that they are unique, deserve respect, and excellent care - at least in civilized nations.

And the first year or so I felt like doing just that, but we do adjust to things we believe we could never live with.  But the one thing I cannot stand is being indoors all the time.

I think this is wonderful, if he did not have this he would be in a home which he would hate.

Having realistically recognized others' kindness as well as their faults, love is always focused on the other person’s welfare. We have no ulterior motives to fulfill our self-interest or to fulfill our desires; we love others simply because they exist. Attachments exaggerates others' good qualities and makes us crave to be with them. When we're with them, we're happy but when we're separated from them, we are miserable. These attachments are linked with expectations of what others should be or do. Is love as it is usually understood in most societies really love? Let's examine this a bit more. Generally we are attracted to people either because they have qualities we value or because they help us in some way. If we observe our own thought processes carefully - we'll notice that we look for specific qualities in others. Some of these qualities we find attractive, others are those our parents, or society value. We examine someone's looks, education, financial situation, social status. This is how most of us decide on whether or not the person holds any true value to us. In addition, we judge people as worthwhile according to how they relate to us. If they help us, make us feel secure, listen to what we have to say, care for us when we are sick, we consider them good people and it is this type of people we are most likely to be more attracted to. But this is very biased, for we judge them only in terms of how they relate to us, as if we are the most important person in the world. After we've judged certain people to be good for us, whenever we see them it appears to us as if goodness is coming from them, but if we are more aware, we recognize that we have projected this goodness onto them. Desiring to be with the people who make us feel good, we become emotional yo-yo's - when we're with these people, we're up, when we're not with these people, we're down. Furthermore, we form fixed concepts of what our relationships with those people will be and thus have expectations of them. When they do not live up to our expectations of them, we're disappointed, or may become angry. We want them to change so that they will they will match what we think they are. But our projections and expectations come from our own minds, not from the other people. Our problems arise not because others aren't who we thought they we're, but because we mistakenly thought they were something they aren't. Checklist: "I Love You if __________ " What we call love is most often attachments. It is actually a disturbing attitude that overestimates the qualities of another person. We then cling to tightly to that person, thinking our happiness depends on that person. Love, on the other hand, is an open and calm, relaxed attitude. We want someone to be happy, and free from suffering simply because they exist. While attachments are uncontrolling and too sentimental. Love is direct and powerful. Attachments obscure our judgment and we become impatient, angry, and impartial, helping only our dear ones and harming those who we don't like. Love clarifies our minds and we access a situation by thinking of the greatest good for everyone. Attachments are based on selfishness, while love is founded upon cherishing others, even those who do not look very appealing to the eyes. Love looks beyond all the superficial appearances. If we see unattractive, dirty, ignorant people, we feel repulsed because our minds want to know attractive, intellectual, clean and talented people. Love recognizes that regardless of the others' appearances, their experience is the same as ours: they wish to be happy, to be free from sufferings, and to do their best to avoid problems. When we're overly attached to a person, we're not mentally and emotionally free. We overly depend on and cling to the person to fulfill our mental and especially our emotional needs. We fear losing the person, feeling we'd be incomplete without him. However, this does not mean that we should suppress our emotional needs or become aloof, alone and totally independent, for that too does not solve the problem. We must simply realize our unrealistic needs, and slowly seek to eliminate them. Some emotional needs may be so strong that they can't be dissolved immediately. If we try to suppress them or pretend they do not exist, we become anxious and insecure. In this case, we can do our best to fulfill our needs while simultaneously working gradually to subdue them. The core problem is that most of us seek to be loved, rather than to love. We yearn to be understood by others rather than to understand them. In all honesty, our sense of emotional insecurities comes from the selfishness obscuring our own minds. We can develop self-confidence by recognizing our inner potential to become a selfless human being with many magnificent qualities, then we'll develop a true and accurate feeling of self-confidence. And then we'll seek to increase love - without attachments, to increase compassion, to cultivate lovingkindness, patience, compassion, generosity, understanding and wisdom. Under the influence of attachments we're bound by our emotional reactions to others. When they are nice to us, we're happy. When they ignore us or speak sharply to us, we take it personally and are unhappy. But pacifying these attachments doesn't mean we become hard-hearted. Rather, without attachments there will be space in our hearts and minds for genuine impartial love for them. We'll be actively involved with them. As we learn to subdue our selfish attachments, we can have successful friendships and personal relationships with others. These relationships will be richer because of the freedom and respect which the relationships will be based on. However, our lifestyles and interests may be more compatible with those of some people more so than with others and that is alright. In any case, our relationships will be based on mutual love, mutual interests, and the wish to help each other in life".|`|S4XUl7qWaa	I love my husband, and he loves me.

zZxX5PXBaa	It is morally wrong to wash a tea cosy. The tea cosy is merely being conditioned by the dribbles of tea. Over the  years, they produce a fine crusty quality and a rich dark brown stain ... this cannot be mimicked. It's like the patina on fine old furniture; washing it would be like taking a power sander and stripping away all the rich texture.<br>  <br>  Walter Benjamin once wrote an essay on 'The Work of Art in an Age of Mechanical Reproduction'; he was thinking of things like cheap lithographed reprints of famous paintings. The real thing, he said, has an 'aura' which comes about because of its history, including events that have damaged it. No reproduction can ever have that.<br>  <br>  A true tea cosy is a work of art. A true tea cosy, of course, can only be handmade, preferably knitted. No tea cosy can be reproduced by the thousand as part of some colour co-ordinated 'designer' range. The mass-produced tea cosy is an apotheosis of domestic, vernacular culture, while an elderly, crusty tea cosy is a treasure.<br>  <br>  When the thing does finally become disgusting, of course, when it climbs off the teapot of it's own accord and starts crawling menacingly across the room, then there is nothing for it but to slay it. Mercifully, if possible. And then place it on a burning boat and send it out onto the ocean, like a Viking warrior bound for Valhalla.<br>  <br>  Then back inside for a nice cup of tea.|`|zJUXsRlGaa	Funnily enough I have wanted a tea cosy for about ten years (of course if I had wanted it badly enough I could have bought one!).

At the age of 12 they changed the format and it became childish and vapid to the point where even a 12 year old couldn't get in to it...<br>  <br>  So I asked my Grandma that after this subscription ended, to please not renew it... <br>  <br>  I couldn't think of anything else I wanted at the time so I told her to get me what she wanted but that I couldn't read the mag I had enjoyed for all those years...<br>  <br>  Eventually I found Scientific American and now I get THAT in the mail but it took a LONG time before I found a replacement mag for the subscription that I had been gettting... So she got me books or clothes and eventually I found something to fill what she USED to get me. <br>  <br>  Just like me, it isn't as if you are telling your mom that you hate her gift...

The pollen taken from the fabric only dates back to the 9th century or so. Plus radio carbon dating also agrees with this date. Which is pretty accurate on carbon based material like fabrics. <br>  <br>  Practicing shaman.. quantum physics rocks .|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	It's the Shroud of Turin.<br>  <br>  Yes it is true, (don't know about the book).<br>  <br>  It is on public display at the current time.<br>  <br>  For detalis, photos, etc. go here.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shroud.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.shroud.com/</a><br>  <br>  Edit: I note that a lot of the atheists were quick to tell you it is fake.  The issue is not that simple.  <br>  <br>  There are radio carbon dating tests that show the Shroud was made in the Middle Ages.  If this test is accurate, it would be impossible for the Shroud to have been Christ's burrial cloth.  <br>  <br>  However, the people who claim the Shroud is fake have never been able to come up with any sort of a coherant  explanation as to how it was made. There are theories about using chemicals etc. but these normally  require technology that did not exist at the time it was supposedly made, and they aren't able to explain the depth (it is 3D) and clarity of the image on the Shroud or why it shows up better as a photo negative than as a positive.<br>  <br>  The biggest flaw in these theories is that it fails to explain why the Shroud is the only one of it's kind. If the image is natural, well then there should be other similar cases. If the image was faked, then the faker would have made several copies to sell in different parts of Europe, or someone else would have copied the process.<br>  <br>  Arguing in favor of the Shroud being genuine are the depth and anitomical correctness of the image, and pollen data that fits with the Shroud having been exposed to the air near Jerusalem in the springtime. (It has pollen traces of a plant that is only found there and only in the spring). <br>  <br>  People who believe in the Shroud, like myself, feel that it is more likely that there is a problem with the carbon test data (perhaps due to it having been in a fire in the Middle Ages) than that it is a fake, that was made in Italy, shipped to Jerusalem so as to get the right pollen on it, etc. etc. etc.<br>  <br>  Lastly, the burrial customs of the time argument is irrelevant. The Bible clearly states that Jesus was NOT burried in accordance with the customs of the time. Remember He was executed right before the Passover, at time when Jews are not allowed to perfomr any sort of labor, so rather than leave his body to hang on the cross and be nibbled at by birds and such, it was quickly taken down and put into the first tomb that was available. The women who were coming to the tomb on Easter morning (Matthew 28) were coming in order to wash his body and give him the proper burrial, in accordance with the customs of the times, that He had been denied, due to a lack of time.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Yes. The mysteries still remain about how the image was made, the date of the cloth, and whose image is on the shroud (or even whether it is an actual man's body that made the image).<br>  <br>  The Roman Catholic Church has been good about getting accurate answers through scientific study, but reluctant to too much which might be destructive. Curiously, it is one of the holiest of relics without having any proof of it's authenticity, or who the image is of, which basically equates to treating it as Jesus's image until proven otherwise -- though church clearly states it makes no claim since there is no scientific proof, they still treat it as holy.|`|UH1ipgJmaa	Yes, Juventus football club is from that same place <br>  <br>  <br>  Common Juve beat Chelse|`|BZMPax7Naa	Shroud you mean.

The means of preparing a body for burial in the times of Christ are very different. The body was not wrapped head to foot as is expressed in the scripture which talks about the linen napkin that was wrapped around the face. This is not shown with the shroud of Turin.|`|QluBTwCvaa	The Shroud of Turin is a legitimate cloth that bears the reverse image of a man upon it.  No scientific explanation has been able to be formulated for its markings.  Whether or not it was the burial wrapping of Yashua / Jesus is up for debate.  The fact is it appears to be one of a kind.  Surely the burial cloths of Yashua would have been shown as evidence and not discarded by the early church.  Maybe it would have been given to the church fathers, the disciples and the like, for safe keeping and for preaching.  <br>  <br>  The reverse image was discovered when photography was used. In old photography, before digital, the reverse image was a light scar on photographic film.  It was in this form that the image was recognizable as the form of a man.  Seeing as how they did not know the image was there until the discovery of photography, photography seems to be proof  of authenticity.<br>  <br>  The pollen found upon the shroud agrees with the areas of its storage. Remember, they did not have vacuum storage for relics back through the ages.  <br>  <br>  I myself find it interesting but unnecessary as to any validation concerning faith in Yashua Ha Meshyiach.  The LORD must have had some reason for preserving this cloth though. It is very old. It does draw interest to the cause of the LORD, the saving of souls through faith in the purpose of the death, burial, and resurrection of Yashua Ha Meshyiach.|`|Fpi8im9taa	Well, of course the Shroud itself is *real*, but the story behind it is dubious at best.<br>  <br>  Scientists still need to test for the age of the Shroud that supposedly wasn't altered by near-perfect craftsmanship.

The Hebrew language meaning has never been lost to the Jewish people who have had a continual use of the Hebrew in it's original language for 3500 years.----------last edit.  The ACTUAL TRANSLATION to English is "like a lion", period.<br>  Many Christians mistakenly believe that their KJV, that depended largely on the Greek "Septuagint" was from a Hebrew translation of the ENTIRE HEBREW BIBLE by 72 Jewish scribes/scholars in approximately 285–246 BCE, and in fact, many apologetic web sites simply state that the Septuagint is the "Old Testament" translated into Greek by the Jews. That's misleading.  It was the Torah alone that was translated by the 72 Jewish scholars in that commission and the rest of the Hebrew Bible, the Prophets and Writings, that we find most of the translation errors and purposeful mistranslations, often to retrofit dogma.  Please read this long answer and it will address not only the above mistranslation of the KJV but many other issues. <br>  <br>  ~~~~ First, I'll directly correct the problem above: This is one that some believed to have been willfully mistranslated in order to support Jesus hands and feet being pierced on the cross, others believe that this may have been sinple error and later misused.  This Psalm of David refers to his enemies waiting to crush him,  surrounding him and waiting for him like a lion at his hands and feet, and in fact lions are mentioned *elsehwere* in that very Psalm. It doesn't refer to anything pierced. The disputed word here is "k'ari" which is spelled kaph - aleph - resh - yud. In Hebrew ari is a lion, and the use of the letter "kaph" before a word means "like" or "as." The Christians appear to have invented a new Hebrew word which they pronounce "koari" yet no such word exists in Hebrew with the same spelling. There is a similar sounding word to koari that is used to mean to dig, or perhaps bore (as in a hole), although there are better words for that. But it isn't spelled as the word there in the passage! In "koari" there is no letter aleph as there is in the word k'ari and no grammatical reason for dropping it. ~~~~~~<br>  The Christian “Old Testament” is an adaptation and alteration of The Jewish Bible. Tanakh, is an acronym for the three sections of the Scriptures, the Torah (Pentateuch, first five books of Moses, Torah meaning teaching/law) the  Neviim (Prophets) and Ketuviim  (Writings or scriptures)<br>  Tertullian, early in the third century CE named the Christian amended version of the Tanakh the "Old Testament" *specifically* to designate it as having been superceded and done away with in contrast to the "New", despite the assertion within it's texts well over a dozen times from Genesis forward that it is an eternal testament (covenant).<br>  <br>  The Christian Bible's Old Testament (it’s adaptation of Tanakh) reveals that in many places there are significant translation differences rendering the meanings of the passages quite different. Not only are the books rearranged so that the books are not in the order of Torah, Prophets and Writings, but Kings, Ezra and Nehemiah are divided. The Protestant Old Testament contains roughly the same books; the Vulgate has additional texts added to the canon that were originally written in Greek. The Greek Septuagint (meaning 70) was originally referring to the Torah portion only, and in fact, that is the only portion that was translated by 72 scribes whose translations matched. The rest of Tanakh was translated from the Hebrew to the Greek over the course of about 300 years and scholars cannot tell who or when exactly any of them were translated. Yet the common name of Septuagint is now generally applied to the whole Greek translation. By the beginning of the first century CE, there were many different versions of each text that appeared, some of them with less accurate Hebrew to Greek, and during this time, many other texts appeared being originally written IN Greek such as the books of the Maccabees. By the time of the beginnings of Christianity, some of these texts of Tanakh had become so changed through the Hellenization (introduction of Greek philosophic concepts through language) that they were no longer adherent to Torah precept. The Hebrew Bible canon had been more or less "closed" since the time of Ezra/ Nehemiah (around 423 BCE) but of course, Jewish scribes still penned what was going on in Jewish life in Judea and wrote and discussed how to apply Torah to their lives. It has been debated by many Jewish scholars that if the Books of Maccabees had originally been written in Hebrew they may have been more readily accepted by Jews as Jewish texts..but as a part of Talmud, since the Tanakh was already formed..not as a part of our Bible. <br>  <br>  ****The Greek Septuagint called the Old Testament is not a Jewish document, but rather a Christian one. The original Septuagint, created 2,200 years ago by 72 Jewish translators, was a Greek translation of the Five Books of Moses alone. It therefore did not contain prophetic Books of the Bible such as Isaiah. The Septuagint as we have it today, which includes the Prophets and Writings as well, is a product of the church, not the Jewish people. In fact, the Septuagint remains the official Old Testament of the Greek Orthodox Church, and the manuscripts that consist of our Septuagint today date to the third century C.E.  The fact that additional books known as the Apocrypha, which are uniquely sacred to the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Church, are found in the Septuagint should raise a red flag to those inquiring into the Jewishness of the Septuagint.<br>  The fact that the original Septuagint translated by Jewish scribes more than 22 centuries ago was only of the Pentateuch and not of prophetic books of the Bible such as Isaiah is confirmed by countless sources including the ancient Letter of Aristeas, which is the earliest attestation to the existence of the Septuagint. The Talmud also states this explicitly in Tractate Megillah (9a), and Josephus as well affirms that the Septuagint was a translation only of the Law of Moses in his preface to Antiquities of the Jews. Moreover, Jerome, a church father and Bible translator who could hardly be construed as friendly to Judaism, affirms Josephus' statement regarding the authorship of the Septuagint in his preface to The Book of Hebrew Questions. <br>  <br>  In fact, Dr. F.F. Bruce, the preeminent professor of Biblical exegesis, keenly points out that, strictly speaking, the Septuagint deals only with the Pentateuch and not the whole Old Testament. Bruce writes, "The Jews might have gone on at a later time to authorize a standard text of the rest of the Septuagint, but . . . lost interest in the Septuagint altogether. With but few exceptions, every manuscript of the Septuagint which has come down to our day was copied and preserved in Christian, not Jewish, circles."*****<br>  The accuracy of the words we see now in the Hebrew Bible was confirmed with the findings of the Dead Sea Scrolls where fragments of each book except the book of Esther (the last book to be included in the canon) match quite well with the Tanakh's Jews use today. The majority of the Dead Sea scrolls were written in the Hebrew Language (approximately 90-95%) with Assyrian Block script. From this majority there are a few cases in which the scribes used Paleo-Hebrew (see for example 4QPaleoExodus). Modern Hebrew is different from the ancient Paleo Hebrew, but the Hebrew of 2000 years ago is closer to modern Hebrew than the English of the 1700’s is to the English we speak today. <br>  There was a council of rabbis and scribes at Jamnia in 90 CE who worked hard to rid the Tanakh of the Hellenized versions of scripture that were being spread. Christian apologist scholars often try to claim that this was when the Jewish Bible's canon was FORMED in response to Christianity, but that ignores that their very own writings refer to it as a formed work already. Some of the texts that Judaism never considered as a part of Jewish scripture were early apologetic attempts to tie in Christian dogma to the Tanakh. Others show pre-Christian attempts to Hellenize Judaism. These texts known as Pseudepigrapha were largely written between 200 BCE and 100 CE and included great amounts of Greek philosophy. <br>  You can discover on your own with comparative reading where key passages stand out to change meanings. One well-known portion is in Isaiah. The word lucifer does not appear at all in the Hebrew Bible. It is only in the Christian Bible’s translation from the LATIN..lucifer means morning star in Latin. The Hebrew word Isaiah wrote is heylel, meaning star. In the English translation of the Christian Old Testament they make the Latin word lucifer into a proper name ( Lucifer) and then personify the word referring to the planet Venus in a passage that Isaiah slams Nebuchadnezzar for styling himself the god/man representation of Venus (the morning star) on earth. Isaiah is condemning a human for calling himself a god. There is no fall of angels in the Hebrew Bible. There is simply no such thing as a Lucifer who became a demi-god of an underworld hell to be found in the Tanakh. Most of the book of Daniel and portions of Ezra and a single sentence in Jeremiah are in Aramaic, a related language using Hebrew letters. All else in the Jewish Bible was written in Hebrew.|`|hceNM6Uxaa	I think you're referring to that verse which in my JPS translation reads "Dogs surround me; a pack of evil ones closes in on me, like lions [they maul] my hands and feet" while the KJV has "For dogs have compassed me; the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me; they pierced my hands and my feet."  The Christian version is a misreading of the Hebrew.  Whether it's deliberate (to make the verse into a prophecy of Jesus) or just an error, I wouldn't know, but no Hebrew scholar is questioning for one second that the word is 'lion'.<br>  <br>  You'll find more about this at<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApP1QErwRAxEFh14oxFHZs8jzKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20080914084538AAo2ucq">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|8I9uduIiaa	You will find many differences between the Christian OT and the Jewish Tanakh.<br>  <br>  Also, some versions of the OT are good ones, and reliable; but the KJV does not happen to be one of them.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Here are other discrepancies between the two, taken from <a href="http://www.ajewwithaview.com#" rel="nofollow">http://www.ajewwithaview.com#</a><br>  <br>  1. Zechariah 12:10 ? The Hebrew Tanakh: “and they shall look upon me whom they have stabbed/ thrust through [with swords”)<br>  <br>  The King James Version of Zechariah changes one word [stabbed] to “pierced.”<br>  <br>  BUT John 19:37 (New Testament) misquotes Zechariah to change the entire meaning by saying, “They shall look on him (instead of ME) whom they pierced.”<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  2. Isaiah 7:14 ? The Hebrew Tanakh says “Therefore, the Lord, of His own, shall give you a sign; behold, the young woman (alma) is with child, and she will bear a son and she shall call his name Immanuel.”<br>  <br>  **Take note, this was written in the present tense.<br>  <br>  But the Greek Septuagint changed “alma,” saying “Behold, a virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel” (Matthew 1:22-23). The church changed the entire verse from present to FUTURE tense and then went further to change the Hebrew alma, meaning a young woman to virgin.<br>  <br>  3. Isaiah 53:10 ? The Hebrew Tanakh says “And the Lord wished to crush him, He made him ill; if his soul makes itself restitution (acknowledge guilt) he shall see children, he shall prolong his days and God’s purpose shall prosper in his hand.”<br>  <br>  But the KJV says:: “Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he had put him to grief: when thou shall make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand”..<br>  <br>  4. Psalm 16:9-10 ? (KJV) “Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope. (10) For thou will not leave my soul in hell, neither will you suffer thine Holy One to see corruption”. Why not continue to the next verse? Christians can not because David wasn't talking about Jesus; David was talking about himself. (Psalm 16:11) “You will show me the path of life, in your presence is fullness of joy; at your right hand there are pleasures for evermore.”<br>  <br>  Psalm 16:9-10 in the Hebrew Tanakh says “Therefore, my heart rejoiced and my soul was glad; even my flesh shall dwell in safety. (10) For You shall not forsake my soul to the grave; You shall not allow Your pious one to see the pit.”<br>  <br>  Where is 'Hell', and 'Corruption' as the New Testament stated? It did not exist! .<br>  <br>  The Hebrew translation of Psalm 16:10 tells of David again talking to God, rejoicing that God will not forsake his soul to the grave. While David is alive he will dwell in safety because God will protect his flesh from injury, and G-d will show him the way. Does verse 11 relate to Jesus? If Jesus is part of the godhead, as Christians say, how can G-d show him the way?<br>  <br>   5. Isaiah 9:5 ? The Hebrew Tanakh reads: “For a child has been born to us, a son has been given us and authority has settled on his shoulders. He has been named “The Mighty G-d” Isaiah was referring to King Hezekiah, son of Ahaz.<br>  <br>  Again, in an attempt to insert a Jesus prophecy, the KJV changed the tense from the present to the future, making it, “A child is born, a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty G-d”. [In Hebrew Hezekiah means “the mighty G-d.”]<br>  <br>  6. In John, the New Testament author tries to make Jesus as the perfect sacrificial lamb of God (who then supposedly takes away the sins of the world) and relate this to the Jewish Passover. [John’s writings have Jesus die on Passover, while the other Gospel authors say he died the day after.] John 19:32-36 tells of soldiers breaking the legs of the crucifixion victims to hasten their deaths, yet sparing Jesus because he was already dead. To this end the author of John supposedly quotes Hebrew Scripture saying, “For these things were done, that the Scripture should be fulfilled, a bone of him shall not be broken.” The New Testament “fulfilled prophecy” supposedly refers to Exodus 12:46; Numbers 9:12 and to Psalms 34:20.<br>  <br>  Notice how conveniently John changed the entire meaning by simply changing of Exodus 12:46 by changing one word: “it” to “him.” Exodus 12:46 refers to the PASSOVER-offering, “…and you shall not break a bone in it (the animal).”<br>  <br>  Numbers 9:12 again refer to the PASSOVER-offering, “…nor shall they break a bone of it”. Again, by changing one word, the original message is lost.<br>  <br>  Psalms 34:20 refers to David saying no one becomes truly righteous and great without his share of mishaps,<br>  CONTINUATION:He guards all his bones, even one of them was not broken.” Nothing ever shows that this Psalm was intended as prophetic, certainly not applying to the future fictitious character of Jesus.<br>  <br>  (NOTE: Jesus would have been disqualified as a Passover 'sacrifice' because the female lamb had to be “without blemish.” Jesus was wounded, whipped and mutilated.)<br>  <br>   7. Psalm 2: 11-12. By simply leaving off one Aramaic word, Christians altered the entire verse. The KJV reads, “Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry and you perish from the way”<br>  <br>  The original Hebrew Tanakh records the verses as “Do homage in purity (nash-ku bar) lest He be angry and you perish”. The meaning of the Hebrew word “bar” is pure or clear. Yes, in Aramaic, the word “bar” does mean son, but it is used only as a combination of two words – SON OF. If in Aramaic, the author wanted to mean just the son, he would have used the phrase “ber’a with the letter alef at the end. (Psalm 2:11-12).<br>  <br>   8. Matthew 2:23 ? “And he (Jesus) came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets”<br>  <br>  Which prophets said that?<br>  <br>  According to scholars, rabbis and historians, the city of Nazareth did not exist during the writings of Hebrew Scriptures.<br>  <br>  The word “Nazareth” does not appear anywhere in Hebrew Scriptures. This is even verified by the New Testament Concordance!<br>  <br>  Therefore, Nazareth and Nazarene are Christian words, not Hebrew words. Nazareth is not mentioned in non-Christian sources until the third or fourth century.<br>  <br>  Nazarites are not a sect. but rather it is an individual oath taken by a person to be in effect for a time period. During this time the person is not allowed to cut their hair, go near a corpse, eat grapes or drink wine. Afterward he must bring special offerings to the Beith Hamikdash and shave his hair.<br>  <br>   9. Psalm 22:16 from the Hebrew Tanakh when correctly translated reads “They surrounded my hands and feet like a lion” (the word “ka’ari clearly means like a lion, as evident from its use in Isaiah 38:13 and other writings, even in the KJV).<br>  <br>  David was pursued by his enemies and often referred to them as “lions” (see Psalms 7 & 17).<br>  <br>  Yet, when read out of context the KJV dmistranslates: “They pierced my hands and feet.” The passage was altered to indicate Jesus.<br>  <br>   10. Using Isaiah 59:20, Christians again misquote Hebrew Scripture. The New Testament in Romans 11:26, has Paul supposedly saying, “And so all Israel shall be saved; as it is written. There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.”<br>  <br>  The Tanakh recorded a different event. Isaiah:“A redeemer will come to Zion, and to those of Jacob who repent from willful sin. Is it in or out of Jerusalem? Just change “to Zion” to “out of Zion.”<br>  <br>  11. Hosea 6:2 ? The Christian Bible has the authoress of Luke (24:46-47) telling that Jesus rose on the Third Day: “Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.” This could have only been designed to satisfy a prophecy in Hosea 6:2. The New Testament has Paul writing in I Corinthians, “and Jesus was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.” Further 1 Corinthians 15:4.says “After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight.” Which Hebrew Scriptures are these authors talking about?<br>  <br>  As usual, the source documents, The Hebrew Scriptures, say something entirely different:<br>  <br>  Hosea 6:1-2 “They will say, Come let us return to God for He (God) has mangled us and He (God) will heal us; He (God) has smitten and He (God) will bandage us. He (God) will heal us after two days; on the third day He (God) will raise us up and we will live before Him. 'We' refers to the nation of Israel.<br>  <br>  The last verse in Chapter 5 sets the scene and explains the situation very clearly: “I (God) will go, I will return to My place until they will acknowledge their guilt and seek My face; in their distress they will seek Me (Hosea 5:15). Hosea explains in verse 5 that God sent a clear-cut message to Israel through My prophets; you heard and refused to repent, so My offer resulted in your death sentence. How could I vindicate you after such defiance? Then Hosea explains: “Come let us return to God”!<br>  <br>  Does this refer to Jesus?<br>  <br>  Answer: No.<br>  <br>   And a few more...<br>  <br>    Psalm 2:11-12. This passage is cited often by Christians seeking to prove the Trinity. In the King James Bible, it reads:<br>  "Serve the L-rd with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him."<br>  <br>  But the verse is mistranslated. The word rendered "the Son" is "bar". In Hebrew, the word mea|`|VxtA3ckhaa	Can you please quote both places. I can't find the Prior.

CSysSbnlaa	I am a Vamp, I can tell you what NOT to believe. One, we sleep, we just sleep during the day so we can avoid the uncomfortable Sun. We can sleep at night but it's are only time to go out if it was really sunny that day. We don't go after animals. We don't hunt, we just go buy steak. Where does he go "hunt" anyway. Sound weird to me. But the Vamp thing could be easily true. Good luck!<br>  ~Midnightrose|`|AA11432517	NO, I would not. Quite simply, vampires are born as such, not "bitten and turned". The biting stuff is pure fiction and I think you should view his claim as fiction, also. If he chooses to engage in his vampire fantasy, that's his business, but don't feel as though he's really needing to "hold back" from biting you. He sleeps and eats like anyone else, although he probably has forced himself into unhealthy sleeping patterns in an effort to live his fantasy. Vampires are all the rage now. It gets tiring to those that really are.|`|bNu2acRbaa	OMG!! you are so gullible. ok, so it is physically impossible to be a vampire. we need sunlight for vit D. we cant drink blood because we will throw it up because our bodies cant handle it. and we all need sleep or you'll die because sleep is when the body repairs itself. that's why vampires are in FICTIONAL books, because they're NOT real!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  EDIT-<br>  well, actually, to the person BELOW of me there was a program on this on ricky lake about people being vampires and there was this women on who had done years of research on vampires to prove that they wernt real and she did PROVE that humans can not handle all that blood and so WILL throw it up. vampires arent real (well humans cant be them anyway, theyd have to be like another breed or something)|`|Kru3PZbkaa	I know one thing for certain about vampires.

You are seriously gullible if you believe him.|`|g7ouXuoQaa	ha. lol. who knows..|`|A2nKiMsuaa	Ask if you can go on a hunting trip with him.

He's lying.<br>  I have an open mind on things, and one of my cousins believes she is a vampire, but they way she describes is actually believeable.<br>  <br>  That guy? Uh no. According to my cousin, you dont find out til the changes accure which is 17 or older, and they arent big. They don't find the need to constantly bite people. They sleep like everyone and you cant be bitten and turned into one. In the myth folklore there was mentioned you had to be bitten completely drained of blood and then the vampire would have to you their blood, which why would they give the curse they have? According to my cousin you have to be born one you cant be turned. <br>  <br>  Looks like he's been watching too many movies. I usually refrain that kinda of comment but I think he has been. And you shouldnt believe everything someone says. I personally SORTA believe my cousin because i know she doesnt lie -that much, there are some fibs usually harmless ones-  and hers is believable. She makes it sound like a disease. Which it is, and in truth her blood consumption -she also isnt reframed from drinking and eating other foods, she loves chocolate- is like less than ..what was the measurement... a pint? i think, i cant remember<br>  <br>  EDIT: And to the person above me, thats  not true, you wouldnt nessary throw it up. Think cannibals and teh blood countesss. They eat/ate people and whats part of people? Oh Riight blood. Though MOST people are revoted by the thought. Along with have you ever cut your self then sucked on it? You're drinking blood -but a small dose so i can see the non throwing up part of that. I can eat like a small small smalll glass of apple juice but anymore and i get dizzy and throw up- There has been diseases where 1.people can't be around natural light/really strong lights it can make them sick, dizzy, burn and die -its an allergy but its REALLY rare- or 2.have a strong desire for blood and actually drink it along with the flesh. -also REALLY rare-<br>  Really think before you speak, though most dont really know about those diseases so i wont pentalize you.|`|TffCSzHxaa	He probably just wants attention.|`|elY5vkVyaa	Does he also wear an anorak and play Dungeons & Dragons?|`|RrQNJsVsaa	No, because they aren't real!|`|2h913O0Saa	omg, he just wants attention.

Just try to keep your head low and don't make a big issue out of anything unless it is something you can't live without.  For instance, if laptop doesn't work, instead of going to Dad and saying "This stupid f**king laptop is busted again!!"  Instead, say to him - "Dad, I'm having trouble getting my laptop to boot up.  Can you help me when you get a chance?"  Think about how YOU would want to hear it.  Be nice. Be civil. Don't demand - ask.|`|pWoMaxwkaa	That always used to happen to me. Before when my parents were together usually my father would get blamed and she'd go around chasing him. But right now its all on me and no one else. When I was small I would go out shopping and getting food with my mother because she would force me to carry those stupid paper bags that rip in the rain. And she has the same saying your dad does " Whatever you touch breaks , you have bad luck , you are a bad luck charm! " and she'd go on talking about it all day. Just think in your head that whatever he says and even if he hits you , take it as a blessing. I tried telling my mother once , and oh god it was going back and forth like a debate. Dont do it.|`|XItuKiZSaa	Yeah parents have a way of wanting to blame you for everything because it makes them feel better I guess.

Perhaps your only encounter with Americans has been with tourists.  For some reason or other, there are more American tourists in Europe than there are European tourists in America.  Perhaps you are just spread thinner when you come here because America is larger than any one European nation.  With the tourists coming elbow-to-elbow, you are more likely to meet up with those unfortunate few who lack manners. As another poster pointed out, they do stand out in a crowd, don't they?  That by no means indicates we are all that way.  <br>  <br>  Why do you think that Americans get the impression that "all" Europeans are snobish and rude?  I think that when some stereotypes exist, then we are more likely to notice when those occur, instead of noticing that those are simply a small percentage of the whole tourist population.|`|dCewrtXaaa	There is no such thing as "America as a whole." It is too big a country to generalize about. There have always been criminals and corrupt politicians, but they are now featured on the news more than they used to be. Many children learn good manners at home but, as teenagers, temporarily flout them in public situations. When they have children of their own they will probably teach them basic good manners as well. And of course the exposure of a foul-mouthed politician or two, including our recent ex-president and vice-president, is taken by some people as permission to curse.

AA12360579	Considering all of my friends are atheists, agnostics or freethinkers, I would have to say that we're a silent majority here in America.  Either that, or I'm some sort of magnet to people who reject Christianity.  And I live in Indiana--not usually a place considered to be 'Godless'.<br>  <br>  I don't know anyone who's been polled, by the way.  I certainly haven't been, nor has my family or any of my friends.  Strange how polls claim to know exactly how many people are Christian, but I don't know anyone who's participated in such a poll.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I can't say for sure.  I haven't heard of it.|`|YLqVv7Lzaa	It would be pretty bad. Mind you, at least separation of church and state is enshrined in their constitution. In Britain we have no separation and the head of state is also 'defender of the faith'.<br>  <br>  That's a bit wierd, we have state religion and ignore it and they ignore their state secularism.|`|ae69df0205dd6e6d96e6d67fdc47b203aa	Why would it put you off?

In addition, I think most Americans are fundamentally atheistic but when asked in general terms, will say they believe in god in the sense that they believe in some form of 'greater meaning and purpose'. American Christian zealotry is overstated subterfuge. Economics is the religion of America and in that regard, the correct response to your question is, YES... zealotry and evangelism... and, YES it is insufferable. The official state religion of America is economics. Gold, currency and profit are our holy trinity of father, son and holy ghost. Corporate executives, Wall Street tycoons and 'financial experts' are our high priests, prophets and seers of manifest signs. Our mass communications serve the single function of economic evangelism and our society is a superstitious ritualistic economic theocracy. Use us as a reference point, but I implore you, keep your attention focused at home because I assure you... American Evangelistic Economic Theocracy... COMING SOON TO A THEATRE NEAR YOU!|`|1wfLZrTQaa	I live in America. Yes, most Americans would probably say they believe in some form of God but that doesn't mean they go around shoving religion down your throat. I've never felt like someone was trying to persuade me to their religion except my own grandmother. <br>  <br>  Just because someone says they believe in God doesn't mean they actually go to church or preach to strangers on the street. We have iron clad separation of church and state here so it won't effect you in terms of getting a job or getting accepted into a school, and you're not going to get carted off to prison or anything. <br>  <br>  It's considered bad form to pressure others about your religion OR LACK OF IT here. Atheists would do just fine here as long as they treat people who do believe with respect and don't mock them and this is the same for Christians towards atheists; it's about just minding your own business regardless of what you do or don't believe. <br>  <br>  Personally I find atheists to me more militant in my face trying to persuade me not to believe than Christians trying to convert me.|`|UOIcXs7Haa	I could but i'm happy where i am.

Good and evil are opinions espoused by those who wish to judge, control, lead, or otherwise impose their will on others as if they were God.  According to the Bible, only those who follow God are allowed in His presence.  Those wanting to play god are banished from His sight.<br>  <br>  This is why God warned Adam and Eve, and thus mankind in general, that life as they knew it, meaning the freedom they were born with, would be lost if men became gods having the ability to play god and judge others. Satan (the serpent of the Bible) said God was a liar and the knowledge of good and evil would be good for them.  <br>  <br>  Today, law, which defines the "opinions" of good and evil, is the god that rules the world in God's place, because it is men holding the power to say what is good and evil who hold human life in their hands.|`|Bq0gqw7qaa	I am constantly amazed that moral relativists claim good and evil are subjective human perceptions (out of one side of their mouth) then subsequently (out of the other side) claim certain things [un] fair or [un] just. Fairness and justice are concepts only retainable to someone that retains belief in the objectivity of moral values.<br>  <br>   Sorry but you can't have it both ways; It is circumstance and intent that affect the moral culpability of any given act, the act itself remains what it is objectively. Charity is good (right to do) but Charity performed for reward of recognition is insincere and of less value than Charity performed out of true concern for the well being of another. In the former instance the charitable act is not evil, only the intent. Similarly, Stealing is evil (wrong to do) regardless of circumstances and intent.  The moral culpability is obviously lower for a mother who steals a car to rush her dying child to the hospital, than for a punk who steals a car to show off to his buddies, but in neither case is stealing good. Charity is good and stealing is evil objectively IMO<br>                                                         Peace; D.D.|`|gQEFy4BVaa	'Good' and 'evil' are human perceptions.

But, the way I see it is that God would know, before it even happened, that Jesus would get questioned about it. Could Jesus lie and say He didn't know, if He did, and was for very good reasons told not to tell? No, of course not.  He would have been in an invidious situation. God has a VERY good reason why we are not told the day of Jesus' return.  I guess, it would be for the very same reason that we do not know the day of our death individually. The Word tells us that sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.....  whereas you do not know what will happen tomorrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away. (Matt.6:34, James 4:14)<br>  <br>  If we knew that we should submit to God and seek His forgiveness for going our own way and we knew the truth of what we SHOULD be doing, but we had X-amount of years, months, days and hours to live before we had to answer for our mess, a VERY large number of us would op for "HAVING A GOOD TIME" then repent JUST before we died so we would be OK on Judgment Day.  But God makes it so VERY clear to us that we should be seeking a relationship with Him TODAY for TODAY is the day of our salvation-VOLUNTARILY come to Him without the pressure of a time-line, but to appreciate that we ARE a mess and WANT to get our lives cleaned up before another day goes by.<br>  <br>  The ancient wedding practice was as follows.Jesus refers to the Wedding many times.<br>  During the betrothal period, the bridegroom would prepare a wedding chamber for the honeymoon. This chamber was typically built in the bridegroom’s father’s house. The wedding chamber had to be a beautiful place to bring the bride. The bride and groom were to spend seven days there. The wedding chamber had to be built to the groom’s father’s specifications. The young man could go for his bride only when his father approved. If the bridegroom was asked when the wedding was to be, he might well say “it is not for me to know, only my father knows”.<br>  <br>  Just as a bridegroom would have told his bride that he would go to prepare a place for her, so Jesus told His disciples: “…In my Father’s house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.” — John 13:1-3. In ancient Israel the bridegroom could get his bride only after his father approved. Similarly, Jesus said: “No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be on guard! Be alert ! You do not know when that time will come” — Mark 13:32-33<br>  <br>  This site explains it as: <a href="http://bryanmcanally.com/blog/archives/003950.php" rel="nofollow">http://bryanmcanally.com/blog/archives/0...</a><br>  I think the real problem we struggle with is the idea of "know." We always think about "know" in the sense of knowledge or awareness. "Do you 'know' something factually?" is the way we always think an issue. We're basically asking "Did Jesus get the memo from the father that told the date of his return?"<br>  <br>  Remember, though, that the Bible speaks of "know" in much more comprehensive terms. We've got the biblical "know" that speaks of intimate relationship. You know, the way Lot "knew" his daughters (ick), or better perhaps, when God says, "I know the plans I have for you." (Jeremiah 29:11). It's not a matter of God just being aware...it's that He authored every one of your life's plans, with a full understanding of you that is far more exhaustive than your own self-awareness.<br>  <br>  Jesus talks a lot about "know" in terms we just don't get. He tells in Luke 13 of the people who will say, "we ate with you and you taught in our streets," and Jesus will say to them, "I don't know you." This doesn't mean that he doesn't recognize them...He's God! Instead, it means, "you never gave your spirit to me, you never trusted me intimately with the most important part of you that I created! You chose to be far from me and oppose me."<br>  <br>  So...my point is that I agree with the scholars who say that Jesus is using "know" in the way we use "know" when he says, "it's not for you know know when..." If we knew exactly when, we'd be lazy until the last moment and try to cram in all our obedience in the last moments. However, when he's saying that he does not "know," I believe he's saying that it is not the Son's responsibility to reveal the hour that he determined as The Father, and he's okay with that because he is in perfect relationship with the Father. <br>  <br>  Even as I read what I just wrote, I can hear the arguments of "so he's lying?" Of course not. I believe that Jesus understands things on levels we don't on this side of eternity. Our thoughts aren't his thoughts. Our ways aren't his ways. He asks John and James if they're ready to drink from his cup...they're thinking "power" when he says "cup," and he's meaning "suffering" when he says "cup." We think "give me a date" when we say "do you kno

You do not have to learn Spanish, but there is nothing wrong with learning the language of an increasing part of the population of your country.<br>  <br>  I am Belgian. We have 3 official languages : Dutch, French and German.

When I was 7 years old I emigrated to Canada from Italy with my family.  At the time, there were many French schools in Montreal but not that many English schools.  My parents tried to register me in one of the many French schools in our neighborhood but back then the French in Montreal were quite bigoted against immigrants from any country.<br>  <br>  So, I ended up having to walk blocks and blocks to attend an English school.  Myself and some Italian girls and some Portuguese, Spanish, Polish, Ukrainian, Hungarian, even a few Irish and Scottish girls, all attended English school.<br>  <br>  That is the biggest favour anyone has ever done for me in my life.  The French school system's refusal to have us attend the French school at the very corner of our street, gave us all the opportunity to learn English, which became our first language.  There was an added bonus:  we also learned French simply by playing with the children in the neighborhood.  So now, instead of being unilingual, I speak 3 languages fluently, plus a fourth (Spanish) which I later studied in school.<br>  <br>  I have been lucky, my knowledge of languages has broadened my horizons and opened the doors to many job opportunities I many not have had otherwise.<br>  <br>  Chances are the new Mexican immigrants you are referring to will learn English.  Actually, they very probably will.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, you are not obliged to learn Spanish.  You may however, be shutting the door to many unforseen opportunities.  You may want to reconsider.|`|ab12bf1cc4fcd2264e88fe8e2ee186f2aa	Aye Aye. I don't like Spanish: all the songs are about only that thing.

As for the Earth, it could very well be that life will no longer exist by that time. This could be caused by a number of events, e.g. destruction caused by humans, or perhaps by a comet or meteor smashing into the planet at a formidable speed, maybe even deadly radiation from a source far across the galaxy. no matter what happens, the Earth as a planet will continue to exist, with or without our "civilizations"- we're totally insignificant in the grand scheme of things!!!|`|QP8LdPLeaa	probably burnt alive since we're doing a good job frying the ozone layer.|`|G8MD91FQaa	No civilization will be there nooo way we can survive till then with the resource left .<br>  Well in the case of galaxy and earth same as all ways|`|WJQLPGqsaa	Dead.

C7Ujon3Xaa	Why did you post the same question twice? <br>  Loss of points!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Hey, sorry! Now that I saw your first question I realize why you asked the other two. You want to become a fashion designer, don't you. Hey, that's cool, but listen, you need to respect other people's choices as well. In a way I know what you mean, I attend this really nerdy college and it makes me sick to see people in western wear without any sense of style and it makes me feel such people are better off wearing salwaar kameez- but at the end of the day, it's their personal choice.<br>  <br>  By the way, Sabyasachi Mukherjee, a male designer, has made it big in the fashion industry, back home.<br>  If you go for fashion designing, I think you've got it in you to change the Indian fashion scenario but you need to respect the Indian Temperment and understand the traditional-modern Indian mind. <br>  The major problem with our Indian designers today is that they blindly copy Western patterns; we urgently need some original designers.<br>  <br>  And ya, some people concentrate more on studies, so what? Respect them for that- it does not mean that they don't have a smart persona or don't like having fun; it's just that they don't spend 3/4th of their day in perming and trimming their hair.|`|GllB4mPZaa	Stay there forever.WE r exporting our retardedness.|`|cgomb6Dwaa	yeah. i think it is because we feel so excited an make the strange ascent. but dont worry when u grow up every thing will change. this hapen to all my friend and my cousin from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal. <br>  i have no Paki friend because they kill a lot of people.|`|BCyWKUtKaa	idk I'm Indian. I think my parents just want to save money bcuz tehy buy me cute clothes when they r on sale. I don't shop at like American Eagle or aberacromie and stuff but I like the way I look. I don't really care if all the other American girls have retarded straight hair and super expensive clothes. They just wanna fit in with everyone else and be "cool". ( which fyi...they look like sluts trying to do so) They r the most annoying people bcuz they think they are so cool and better than ever1 else. My parents don't want me to be like that. That's why they don't spoil me.
AA11732853	It's sometimes very easy to slip into the victim role; we like someone very much, we would like a relationship, but they don't seem interested, so we just carry on regardless, carrying a torch and secretly resenting them for not seeing us as we'd like them to.<br>  <br>  Some people see online dating as a safe option, and they can pretend to be anyone they like.  With you perhaps this guy is comfortable to just be himself, and that is something to be thankful for.<br>  <br>  The truth could well be that he is not sexually attracted to you and that is your cue to find someone else.  Perhaps when you are happily involved with another partner you will come to see your friend as just that: a good friend, and you may be glad of that.|`|2OO9U8o9aa	Tell him that you care for him more than just a friend , how else will he know ??? He is not going to ignore other hot guys just waiting to see if you want more , so TELL HIM NOW   Good Luck|`|Jpq6nEXeaa	try and find other people,dont spend your life liking just one person that wont have any feelings for you.and if he wants to waste his life on a computer then let him do what he wants.|`|ixqpmUVLaa	You have to be true to yourself, true to your feelings, and let this guy know how you feel.  If you can't be true to yourself, if you can't love yourself, you can't love anyone else. If the feeling is not mutual, move on.  Perhaps try to keep this man as a friend; but perhaps that isn't possible.|`|OoLJQNYwaa	find a new crush|`|l6MioubMaa	shave|`|9zKC07KQaa	I think that you should always state the way that you feel. Do not hide your feelings for anyone. If he doesn't want you than your ego should be big enough to know he is the one loosing out on a good friend. You could also just be patient and time could tell what happens next. My grandparents were split up from their thirties until their sixties before they reunited and now they are married.

Just be naked and confident.  Of course you could throw a towel around yourself as you walk to and from the showers if you want.<br>  <br>  No one will make comments - and if they do turn it around on them.  Ask them what they're doing checking you out?  Do they check out all the boys or just the ones they have crushes on?  They won't make any more comments.<br>  <br>  Trust me.

2mU1bbAZaa	mature singles only is one site that i found but when i typed in dating lessons I got a lot of interesting sites. I'm single too (happily) but would love to meet a guy (someday) who had taken a lesson or two on dating. My son and his wife give me hope, I suppose he got his lessons from me and the bad experience of divorce. I hope the websites helped a bit.
gknPGlDCaa	Heeeeyy :) <br>  Listen, if your gay, your gay. Scream it to the world, nothing anybody says is going to change that and as long as you true to yourself and your proud of yourself and not ashamed of yourself nobody will care! They will just have to accept you the way you are and if thats not good enough for them then theyre missing out. i understand why you dont want to tell folk though, you get the wee hard ned that will make jokes and stuff so i'd be pretty sacred too but if you trust your friens tell them but dont make a big deal out of it and they wont either. being gay isnt going to change the fact your their friend, you were there friend before you told them so what gonna change? Dont try not to seem gay, my frinend is the campest boy in the world and he denied being gay and he got jip about it but now hes gay and proud and nobody cares. You can't hide from yourself!! <br>  right, im kinda babling on nowww... :/ lol <br>  And just be nice to folk and they be your friend :) <br>  xoxox|`|pncKHqkOaa	I found that it is a good idea to bring up homosexuality around the friends to help you decide if you can tell them, thats what I did, worked out great.|`|AA11791155	Being a teen you always have to deal with the chance that people will want to beat you up for being gay. This is wrong of course but you should know how to defend yourself if you are going to come out and deal with school bullies. <br>  I would take some martial arts or fighting skills before I came out if I was you. <br>  The scary psychological side of coming out (losing false friends) is not such a scary thing once you do it. Living in your truth is the best. <br>  Still be safe. Know how to protect yourself from those that are afraid of you and would want to hurt you.

AA10214265	You'd want to use a wood sealer in order to waterproof the particleboard, like a deck sealant. Use Liquid nails to glue your styro tombstones to the front of it.<br>  <br>  You can also cut PVC pipe and use Liquid Nails to glue it to the back of your tombstones, then hammer a length of rebar or stiff wire into the ground, bending the top over the edge of the PVC tube to secure it.<br>  <br>  Some folks go so far as to make their tombstones out of cement.

NlXbzfQ9aa	I think that there is a difference between how it feels to have a man or woman touch a guy. A guy understands what it feels like to have his d-ck touched, tasted or caressed, so he can do that to another guy. I don't think a woman would understand the feeling. Really do some soul searching about this as it might have an impact on your relationship with your wife.

In what context do you mean??|`|WaYZQhnHaa	I guess it all depends on the context of your speech, and the preference of the person to whom you are speaking.  Personally, I would prefer "lady", as I feel it sounds more respectful than "woman".<br>  For example:  I'm asking for assistance at a store.  The employee asks another worker to assist me.  "Will you please assist this lady?"  sounds more courteous than, "Will you please assist this woman?"<br>  <br>  Just my .02.  :)|`|pWoMaxwkaa	Those old women might think that you're being rude and trying to address her as old. <br>  But I mean I wouldnt like it if someone picked up the phone and said <br>  " Hey lady , whats up?

Y6odIQgJaa	I had the same problem with my sister.  I started telling her to be somewhere about a half-hour before the real time to meet.  It worked for awhile.<br>  <br>  People who are habitually late are rude and saying quite loudly that their time is more important than your time.  They are manipulative and use others for their own gains.  Actually, they tend to have very low self-esteem....<br>  <br>  Try asking her the next time:  "Is this the EARLIEST you've ever been LATE?"<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|GqfiRXu3aa	As the others suggested, tell her to meet you 15 minutes earlier than you really want her there.  If she's still late just tell her, "You're always late!"  If you're good friends you should be able to say something like that to her.  She should be confronted for her rudeness, not catered to for it.|`|WaYZQhnHaa	Some people just don't manage their time well, and don't consider how it affects others.  If her chronic lateness really bothers you, I would do as others suggested:  Ask her to meet you 15 minutes earlier than necessary.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Next time she is late, leave without her.|`|fnBPI4OAaa	I can't STAND this!!!! It annoys me so much- lateness. And disgustingly ALL my friends do it. I am the ONLY one every on time ANYWHERE.<br>  <br>  I understand completely where you're coming from.

I'd just come off sounding uptight as usual though.|`|t79pLOCUaa	Tell her to meet you 15 minutes before time and that you will only wait for her for 10 minutes.<br>  If she has not arrived in those 10 minutes go ahead without her. At the moment you are rewarding her lateness by waiting for her. If you did not wait for her sh would soon get the message and be on time.|`|iTEf1dP3aa	How about instead of meeting at 3:00 tell her 2:45?? Then you show up at 3:00 together....no?

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

YUAegpPoaa	To be an apologist is difficult at best, when the person on the other end of the conversation is willing to try and see your point of view, much less here. In these forums you are not given any benefit of doubt and answers are not sought.<br>  <br>  I could just skip over your question. Not want to look at the ugly bits of things that are difficult to explain or justify. It is tempting, since I know any answer I give will not be popular or well received by my audience in general but it is your question and I think I can explain it to you.<br>  <br>  Excommunications are symbols of what is already there. An irreconcilable difference on what is felt by both sides to be something so important that they are not willing to listen, budge from their position, ask each other for forgiveness, or ever change. What do you see as vicious in one side that you do not see in the other? When people start claiming they do things 'on principle' they are often about to do something really dumb so they can feel better about their decision.<br>  <br>  Leave God out of it; he did not issue any excommunication. Leave the rest of the Catholic Church out of it, they did not issue any excommunication.<br>  <br>  When I see this question asked I see a forum full of little Archbishops who are more than willing to turn a human tragedy into their own personal political 'point'. Score one for you then but I don't know why you want that goal.<br>  <br>  I will remain Catholic. I think it is God's position to judge and not mankind. I think all life is sacred. I think there is a difference between infallibility and inerrancy. I think it is less than wise to turn this girl's particular tragedy into a decision on principles. If you want to know what I think all you have to do is ask; I'll even answer the Godwiny rhetorical questions.<br>  <br>  Does that answer your question?|`|AA10847209	So this was a Catholic Church group that excommunicated the mom?  For trying to help her daughter avoid further pain? Whoever in the church did (presumably male) should be hung by their cojones and never cut down, period. Did the nine year old bear the twins, and what happened to her? This is outrageous! And was the step dad punished by any of the church representatives?  Or was he just given a pat on the back for ruining the child's life and being macho? Why ( I wonder) doesn't the Pope step in to excommunicate the man and give the mom and her daughter some much needed help? I can see no valid theological reason that a loving God would support and/or mandate this type of abuse. The little girls' life is destroyed, and if she actually had the twins that would be three innocent lives lost--all in support of the alleged edict of a cruel and unyielding creator/dictater. Horrible!|`|8ubAwaGCaa	Your comparison fails because, I hope, you are not a member of the KKK.  It wasn't some random organization.  <br>  <br>  Being excommunicated in North America might not mean much, but to a Jew or a Catholic (especially in Latin America), or a Latter-day Saint it is almost sure to mean ostracism.  For the Saints, excommunication is supposed to be a way to get back to square one so we can repent and be baptized again.  In the case of the little girl, it was just abuse.  She didn't sin, and so she shouldn't be punished.<br>  <br>  Did they excommunicate her stepfather?  Did they put him in jail?  Did they shoot his b---- off?|`|jard50Yiaa	Excommunication is a religious censure used to deprive or suspend membership in a religious community. The word literally means putting [someone] out of communion. In some religions, excommunication includes spiritual condemnation of the member or group. Censures and sanctions sometimes follow excommunication; these include banishment, shunning, and shaming, depending on the religion, the offense that caused excommunication, or the rules or norms of the religious community.|`|IWtHxOrSaa	you thought Micheal Plain was joking when he sang every little sperm is sacred?

Once people hit prison, they tend to "find Jesus". (What did that dude DO that he's always in prison???) True, a few go to other faiths, but the vast majority seem to suddenly convert to christianity. Now if they *stay* christian after their hearing with the parole board is something that is open to debate. I imagine most do, since that faith teaches they can be forgiven for  pretty much anything.  That would be a hard deal to give up, no? <br>  <br>  1. Rob convenience store<br>  2.

5N3odm3Qaa	Your own question is confusing you. And the answer above me is correct -- the vast majority of Israelis are Jewish. But the opposite is not true, which you made up a percentage (unreferenced = imaginary) to support. The majority of Jews are NOT Israeli. Are you still following me?<br>  <br>  I do not know anyone who interchangeably uses the terms "Israel" (not Israeli?) and "Jew." However, the loose usage of "Muslim" and "Arab" is simply due to ignorance. As you should know by now, many people are stupid and/or uninformed. Chalk it up to your ability to watch the news more attentively than others.|`|gQPFHHnWaa	Almost half of Israelis are Arabs who follow Jewish faith. Sephardi and Mizrahi are Jews too not just Ashkenazi. There are also Arabs in Israel who follow Muslim faith.  So not all Arabs are Muslims and not all Muslims are Arabs. Indonesia is the biggest Muslim country in the world but Indonesians are not Arabs.<br>  <br>  Most Americans don't know the fact that there is no such thing as Muslim looking or Jewish looking people.  Likewise, we don't have Buddhist looking people either.  Richard Gere doesn't look Buddhist to many people but he is.  Goldie Hawn definitely does not look Asian but claims to be JuBu.

JWjq5iaXaa	A realistic zombie invasion? Well, to be honest, Left 4 Dead and 28 Days Later have the zombie idea down better than most every other zombie thing out there... thing is, zombies couldn't be literally "walking corpses", they would be some kind of infection that decays parts of the brain causing the human to see any moving, living creature as it's prey, and remove the logic to plot out a strategical attack against it... causing the "zombie" to sprint at whatever the victim is, with no caution to consequence, and devour it.<br>  <br>  What's the chance? Really, really low. A disease like that, completely unnatural (it's never happened before, has it?) would have had to be caused by humans... if scientists wanted to create a "zombie", they could sit in a lab for years with hundreds of human test subjects and eliminate key parts of the brain until the subject acts like a zombie from Left 4 Dead... but nobody has the time, the patience, or the freedom to do something like that. Plus, it has no benefit. If someone tried to create a cure and a "zombie" was the side effect... the cure/vaccination would be so intricate, it wouldn't be possible to create for hundreds of years.<br>  <br>  So to be perfectly honest, a zombie apocalypse couldn't happen for... at least a long time.

VWvI5RyBaa	First yes, Jesus rose form the dead.  As for the second question, it's funny that you ask, I'm 47 and I lost count of the people I lost.  It seems that death on earth has been part of my life from the time I was born.  When my father died I didn't cry, when my mother died, I shed a few tears(more with exhaustion and for what I would tell my 5 year old daughter and my 2 year old son since my mother was visiting us everyday but my baby who wasn't 4 months yet wouldn't realize) but after I told them and explained heaven, I took my shower and I felt strong again.  I had also had to tell my two only siblings who are sick that our mother had died rather suddenly,within 2 days.  My parents were my best friends and when people asked me how I could be so strong, since I was smiling once in a while, I told them that I was happy for them since they had started their real life.  Some people didn't get it so I had to tell them that, for me, earth is just a passage, some sort of test I guess, and that life only starts after death on earth.  My answer is without a doubt that one die first and then rise to start his or her life.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	yes his physical body rose from the dead a eternal body<br>  <br>  your physical body dies then god will one day raise the physical body into a eternal body.|`|CQz8dMzFaa	No. He was never crucified/killed in the first place.<br>  <a href="http://www.free-minds.org/Jesus" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-minds.org/Jesus</a>|`|TOBYij3Qaa	yes<br>  he was killed, and rose days later<br>  he would have suffered hypovolemic shock, and hemorrhagic shock<br>  he was wrapped in about 70lbs of burial herbs and cloth<br>  I think from the Gospel account the pericardial sac burst when they stabbed him|`|QCejFqXgaa	Blessings yes, and one die first then rise after like Jesus did.|`|mg6gAfwYaa	Jesus was the chosen one of God who did rise from dead, the difference bieng that he appeared in the same physical form in which he had died and he was certainly not a Ghostly appearance. One need not die first or rise first because one's true nature is not physical but rather metaphysical, the spirit once released from the body remains in its natural state of bliss before transmigrating into another physical form. The nature of the soul remains unchanged, so it does not make any difference whther one rises or dies first, it all depends on the phase in which the spirit or the soul manifests itself.|`|j5YwuVEIaa	One must die to be resurrected.<br>  <br>  “The Dead in Christ Shall Rise First”<br>  WHAT hope would there be for the dead of mankind were it not for the promised resurrection? The resurrection of the dead is an absolute necessity since the human soul is not immortal. Hence, at the body’s death it could not enter into a fuller life on a higher plane in an invisible world. (Ezek. 18:4, 20; Isa. 53:12) For dead humankind to live again anywhere there needs to be a resurrection. That is why God has laid the basis for such a miracle to take place in his due time. When he raised his self-sacrificing Son from the dead on the third day, he opened the way for this worthy Son to ascend back to where he was before, to heaven. The Son took along with him the full redeeming value of his perfect human sacrifice. Never again will Jesus Christ die. He offered up one human sacrifice for mankind’s sins forever. So, when he comes the second time, it does not mean his facing death.—Heb. 9:28; Rom. 6:9.<br>  2 Jehovah God follows a certain order with regard to the resurrection of the dead. This is called to our attention by the apostle Paul, who himself saw the glory of the resurrected Jesus and talked with him. About 18 years after that, Paul wrote to the Christian congregation in Corinth, Greece, and raised this question: “Now if Christ is being preached that he has been raised up from the dead, how is it some among you say there is no resurrection of the dead?” (1?Cor. 15:12) Following upon this question, Paul went on to develop the inspired answer. As he goes along, he says: “Just as in Adam all are dying, so also in the Christ all will be made alive. But each one in his own rank: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who belong to the Christ during his presence [Greek: parousia].” (1?Cor. 15:22, 23) God alone was responsible for Jesus’ resurrection.<br>  3 Jesus Christ was resurrected on Nisan 16, 33?C.E., the day when the Jewish high priest offered up the firstfruits of the barley harvest. This fits in accurately with Jesus’ being the “firstfruits” in the resurrection of the human dead. (1?Cor. 15:20) This put Jesus Christ in the first “rank.” Just as in the Jewish barley harvest there were afterfruits to be reaped, so too there must be afterfruits in the resurrection of the dead. But since Jesus Christ ranks first, Paul called him “the firstborn from the dead, that he might become the one who is first in all things.”—Col. 1:18.|`|6a1ce2ab43657c5b8abeb67e6a9dacf7aa	In answer to the first question;<br>  Yes, but it is up to you, if you believe it or not.<br>  <br>  As to your second question;<br>  From a spiritual side you must die to your old beliefs.<br>  But physical live.|`|4OEOxOmPaa	BRAINS!

It is hard to write a fictional story without utilizing some common frame of reference.

One example would be King Herod. What is in conflict with the Bible though is the historical accuracy of the claims for what he did in the Bible like the slaughter of the innocents which is not corroborated by historical accounts outside the Bible. There are a few other figures like this that we know probably existed and were woven into the Bible's tales although there is debate about how the Bible portrays these figures and weaves fiction and fact together.|`|YLqVv7Lzaa	Pontius Pilate was a real Roman governer<br>  and King Herod was a real king of Judea, although he died 4 years before Jesus was supposedly born.<br>  <br>  Also the lists of Babylonian kings are fairly accurate.

OJB9L1Qraa	Masonic? I don't think so. The freemasons are not the ones we should be watching. There are far too many what ifs out there. It doesn't matter if the Freemasons want to exploit or enslave us. Watch them while I switch things up without you ever knowing. This is misdirection—don’t allow yourself to be deceived.<br>  <br>  Regardless of who wants to control us, the government is the entity that can give or take our liberties. Talk to friends and family about what's going on within your country so that you and the people you know may better understand. Read about the laws being passed by your government in order to find out who those laws help or hinder. Be informed and ready to talk about politics with everyone you meet if you really care about your country's future. Politics and policies may seem like small talk, but having an informed population is vital to our freedom. Vote whenever possible and make your country as free as you can so that the generations after us can have more liberties and choices. <br>  <br>  The world is much more simplistic than you think. -- We are the people that enable the government to act and without us, it would be disabled.|`|pNxuvKUOaa	Do you have any real knowledge about Freemasonry or are you just drinking the special kool-aid?|`|Z6TNsJluaa	You are on to something here that Christians have been trying to warn people about for years.

The Mark is already here and people are receiving it in order to monitored by satellites. But little do they know that Almighty God has already said of those who receive it, they will not enter the Kingdom of God!

Odds are it's a mixup or curiousity.

If he didn't orgasm or prec*m in you -- then you don't have an STD.<br>  <br>  2.  Involvement in worthless fundamentalism (which is probably what you mean by "loves god," has, in my experience, caused many gay boys to lie to themselves and others about what they want.<br>  <br>  Factually, we know that about 12% of males prefer males to females -- this was recently confirmed yet again recently by Pathela and others (Columbia Presbyterian University Hospital) in a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine for September of 2006.  However, only about 4% of males openly admit they prefer other males.  The rest hide, lie and obfuscate.  That includes most of those who are gay but belong to some form of fundamentalist religion.  They hide at any cost - they are taught to.  <br>  <br>  It is unfortunate that our society and some of its less... productive... religious groups cause some gay boys that type of self-image problem, and that type of agony.  It is also extremely unfortunate that you got caught up in the constant hiding games that some gay boys connected to SOME churches, or even worse, the so called "ex-gay" movement have to play out of fear or out of shame -- fear and shame that they never should have to feel.<br>  <br>  I've linked to a couple of things below that may help you understand the situation.<br>  <br>  As for what you should do -- it depends on how you feel now.  You probably should just leave him.  However, if you still love him, the best thing that you can do is accept him as he really is -- tell him you know, refuse to accept the lies that will spew from his mouth initially and tell him that he would be happier and that so would you if he was just  honest -- and further if he would just ignore the falsehoods he has been taught by his church -- at least when he is talking to you -- and act and talk reality, not what he thinks he's supposed to say or the way he is supposed to act.<br>  <br>  Again, I am truly sorry that this happened to you.<br>  <br>  Kind thoughts,<br>  <br>  Hermes|`|jIk2ttH1aa	You have a right to feel betrayed.<br>  He made it seem like he was straight and he isn't.  He made himself out to be a very conservative type person.<br>  Also, if I were involved with somebody and found out they were doing sexual things with others, I too would be afraid of contracting an STD too!   So don't listen to the people calling your question dumb they are getting OVERLY DEFENSIVE.  ( like it or not my GLBT friends, sexually transmitted diseases are higher amongst homosexuals than any other group.  *I am sure you don't like that statistic and neither do I, but it's not a crazy notion)<br>  <br>  As far as him loving God, his relationship with God is private and between them. I do not believe at all that homosexuality is a sin.<br>  <br>  You sound very innocent/naive which is a very different thing than being crazy or stupid-<br>  so let me educate you  even if he inserted his penis into you, that is sex.  You don't have to be rockin' or anything, you made the 'connection' to become one.<br>  <br>  I would confront him and tell him that you know about his cheating and that you feel very hurt and betrayed.  I would not trust him again either.<br>  <br>  As far as trusting another, that will come with time.  You need to heal your heart and clear your mind of the betrayal.  Next time you are in a relationship, try to learn through communicating with the person.  Realize what sex does and does not entail.  And ask them if they have any fantasies of same sex, and what there true intentions are.  The only way your going to get an honest answer though, is if you are open enough to accept what you hear.<br>  <br>  Best wishes....|`|1xivkqkfaa	He put his "thing" in you, yet you've never had sex?   This must be how the immaculate conception worked.  I understand that you are upset and confused and lost - that's what the conflicting morality of religion is all about.

7hpXsYOCaa	The traditional Japanese demons or "Oni" are an interesting breed.  They are more ogre than evil spirits.

But in a less "threat to mankind" way. There are demons of nature, demons of man, and demons of the gods, but each one stays within their own boundaries.<br>  <br>  Really, I can just say wikipedia the Shinto religion.

So they would all be equally "free-willed".<br>  <br>  Others, like the Judeo-Christian faith, see man as unique.

Some apes have amazing skills, like using tools for various jobs.<br>  <br>  Religious people believe their god who says that animals are on earth for the use of humans and their god hasn't granted animals anything other than to allow them to be used by humans to do as they wish with them. I've read a lot of bible stories in my life but have never seen where cruelty towards animals is condemned.

Every creature on this earth can go back to the same source.

Anyone who has had a pet can understand that. The difference is that animals highly rely on instincts to do certain things and humans do not. For example, have you ever seen a cat poo on the floor and still try to cover it up with dirt, even when there's none?|`|qy0whHiCaa	Christians will say that no animals have free will of course.

Before some of the critics go off on a rampage, let me explain.<br>  When humans were created, they were given free will and animals, mountains, etc. were created and asked if they would like free will to worship or would they always like to pray to God and God alone. The animals replied that they always wanted to worship their creator and neede no free will for that.<br>  <br>  So humans have free will for everything and animals have free will for everything except worship. <br>   <br>  (I seriously hope I restated that right lol)|`|2mqQ1eWJaa	that i don't know why you did not see on the bible.......????|`|daDJrtcvaa	free will is bad for us

They will say, "Where is this 'coming' he promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation." But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water. By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.

Views about the nature of this return vary among Christian denominations. The original Greek of the New Testament uses the term parousia (παρουσ?α from the Greek literal meaning of parousia: presence or arrival, derived from 'para-': beside, beyond, and 'ousia': substance) the "appearance and subsequent presence with" (in the ancient world referring to official visits by royalty). The Second Coming is also referred to as the Second Advent, from the Latin term "adventus", for "coming".

Jesus said, "When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory" (Matthew 25:31). When He comes again, His true identity as the Son of God and the King of kings will be fully revealed.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, the Bible teaches that when He comes the whole earth will behold Him—instantly and completely. The Bible says, "Look, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him" (Revelation 1:7). For those who have believed in Him it will be a glorious day—but for those who have refused to believe in Him, it will be a day of mourning. For them it will be too late.<br>  <br>  Yes, someday Christ will return. We can barely imagine what it will be like, for it will be far more glorious than anything we can picture. But are you ready for that day? You can be, by giving your life to Christ and becoming His follower today.
AyEkA6Flaa	Is he an honestly nice guy, and would this be shared in a spirit of friendship, respect, and care?  I mean, do you really *like* each other as human beings, so that it would be a fun and affectionate thing?<br>  <br>  If so, I must be honest: I'd do it.<br>  <br>  I could never regret the sharing of honest affection and joy.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if he just wants to use you like a tissue and doesn't give a rip about you or your life, then I'd say no.<br>  <br>  My one caveat would be to talk a little more with him and find out what is behind his request.  If he is trying to figure himself out and thinks you are nice and cool, well, I'd be flattered and would be happy to help someone.  Find out for sure whether this is "just for fun" or if maybe he might kinda be interested in you.  If it is an honest experiment to figure himself out, and just for the fun of the experience, I'd still do it -- but would guard my heart from expecting more.  I'd just enjoy the bliss of the moment, teach that boy well, and make him feel great.<br>  <br>  Who knows?  He *might* end up wanting more.<br>  <br>  EDIT: ROFL!  Okay, you didn't say he said, "Let's f*ck".  If he said, "Heyy, I'm kinda curious and I'd like to try out stuff with you cuz I think you're nice", that's one thing -- I'd do it then.  But just "Let's f*ck"?  Um, no thanks.  To me, that sounds like he just wants to make use of you.  (Let me guess in that case -- he is a "top only", right?  LOL, give me a break.)|`|aPcw0sz7aa	I would say he is bicurious at least.<br>  <br>  Im not like that either, and i wouldnt do it, only because i dont like to be that kind of person. To me, sex should mean something, thats just my opinion though. Do what you want, enjoy =)|`|m2PlMByKaa	hey if he's hot & wants to have sex with you, go for it, its not like he's paying you, you're just messing.<br>  <br>  p.s. "straight" guys wouldnt just want to have sex with guys.|`|AA11589320	Lets get this right.<br>  You have never had offers from straight guys. <br>  You have had offers from guys who are bisexual.   Ok maybe they need to be drunk before they will allow their inner feeling to the surface, but that does not mean the feelings are not there all the time. <br>  <br>  They simply claim they are straight as they don't want others knowing their secret.   My bet s they told you that you are the only guy they do stuff with. I say that statement is rubbish.    They are the highest risk of a social disease as they are in total denial of their sexual activity.  <br>  <br>  You also say. <br>  "no one has ever asked me when we're sober before"<br>  Your playing a dangerous game.  Today sex with a person who is under the influence of alcohol is seen as sex with out consent as they were not capable of giving consent.  Yes it called rape.   <br>  <br>  If he is hot and you want him so bad why are you placing walls in the way.  We only live once.  Either say yes and take it like a man or say no and return to the hand.|`|6SwaWSoyaa	If he's hot and if he is a possibly a good friend or an acquaintance of yours then do it. However if he has a history of being quite the immature fellow and is stupid about being bi-curious then I would not recommend it. I honestly would have to know a little more about this character to tell you exactly what I think, but I think you can make good judgments. Just don't fall for him unless you are sure he falls for you.|`|e0lfV7skaa	Here's the deal:  <br>  <br>  As long as you realize that this is going to be purely physical and don't get involved emotionally<br>  <br>  AND<br>  <br>  As long as you realize he may freak out afterward (if he can't handle it) and it may never happen again,<br>  <br>  Then hey - get your freak on.  Think of it as working on technique ;)<br>  <br>  And if it happens again, just work on your technique some more!  :D|`|grYkoDaraa	no i would not be any ones experiment.  i would hate it if i fell for them and after the "experiment" they found that they couldn't return the feelings.  i think experimenting is wrong and unfair.|`|k1zn8nBWaa	dO iT......Well he's hot and it seems like yu want it, go for it. No one is gonna stop yu, unless if he dosen't wanna do it anymore.|`|52VDjbNTaa	I would, but that's because I'm unsure if I'm bi or lesbian or what...<br>  <br>  I don't think I'd do it, personally.<br>  It could get a bit odd if he decides he's not gay or whatever... =S|`|j27SONW9aa	lol..im going to sound really nasty...but toss your morals out the window..and do it...you never know...he could be the one!|`|Syn6WhZBaa	i would do it|`|AA10601065	Would it really be meaningless sex? Think about it. He turned to you because he wants to know what our world is like (well, in the sexual part of our world, anyway), and he turned to you to help him experience it. Right off the bat, if I was in your shoes, I'd feel honored that he has entrusted you with this idea. So, you'd be fulfilling his curiosity to see whether or not he wants to have relationships with men, or stay with women, or maybe become bisexual.<br>  <br>  As long as you taught him about safe-sex and you went slow and were patient with him, I don't see that it's a moral issue at all. You'd be helping somebody to discover who and what they are. So, I would have to say, "go for it and enjoy the experience." You might also discover new things about yourself in the process.<br>  <br>  Who knows, this little "experiment" might lead to the two of you forming a meaningful and long-lasting relationship. I know, I know, that's a huge long shot, but it COULD happen.<br>  <br>  If you decide to go ahead and do this, maybe you could do a follow-up and let us know how it went.|`|l4mgGYDraa	No I use straight guys as my expiriments.|`|SIFyxFFpaa	why not.<br>  <br>  nothing to loose.|`|vTd5MQ1waa	Do it! You never know. Maybe he is gay and really likes you?|`|ybn6beqiaa	I personally wouldnt. I mean, I doubt that he would want anything more than that. I would want to have sex with someone that it actually meant alot to, not just a meaningless experimental ****. I would just wait for a actual guy who likes you for you, not just for your dick and your sexuality.<br>  Maybe I'm different, but when I have sex with people.. its got to mean something. <br>  Good luck with anything you choose anyway. <br>  *hugs*|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	No I'm not a lab rat<br>  <br>  don't do it
839be5UKaa	In Irish-<br>  <br>  body, mind and spirit for eternity joined in love, like an unbroken chain = corp, intinn agus spiorad (ceangailte) le chéile i ngrá go deo, cosúil le slabhra gan bhriseadh<br>  <br>  You can leave out the word (ceangailte) if you want.<br>  You could also use The word "anam" for spirit. "Anam" means "soul".<br>  <br>  (If you wanted one of the other Gaelic languages the translation will be different)
zRyI5CMGaa	No, they are completely separate Church's. Although both Christian.|`|FGcwxZz0aa	I am not sure what you mean. Certainly one has more power over the truth but one is no different than the Protestant clergy in that one still lacks the authority from Christ of the ordained Catholic clergy. Only validly ordained clergy in apostolic succession can confect the Eucharist as they alone have the power to act in persona Christi (in the person of Christ). God bless!<br>  <br>  In Christ<br>  Fr. Joseph|`|wxBFZ41Taa	No. But you do have the fullness of truth that they are missing. <br>  <br>  Only ordained priests can consecrate the Host. And you could not use the elements most Protestants use in their communion services. When I was Methodist, we always used grape juice and a cracker type bread that was broken up.<br>  <br>  ADDED: Actually, Jesus used unleavened bread as specified in the Passover ritual.  Catholics must use the same. It doesn't have to look like the wafers we use but it elements must be wheat flour and water, nothing more. Additionally, Jesus did not use grape juice.|`|AA10733606	You are welcome to come to our church, but you would be in the congregation like everyone else. Also you are welcome to partake communion with us but you would have no control over it.|`|ZDrXFS2daa	Not hardly. No one has more power than anyone else in other protestant churches. The Deacons or Elders oversee the church but they don't have any more power than anyone else.|`|VR7JfxM4aa	No - unless you're an ordained priest you can't effect the transubstantiation of the bread and wine.|`|bK5MJCxhaa	I don't know.  Let's check the "God Loves My Religion Best" hierarchy.|`|OeAfpIZAaa	I can has weed too?|`|RoYL4tyjaa	yes we have power over Satan|`|pOP0Jt0Qaa	That's not very humble of you.|`|oChTv3k5aa	No. <br>  Nein <br>  nada <br>  nyet|`|AA12136918	no|`|AA11923447	No, of course not. And why would anyone want to interfere in the operations of another church in the first place?|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Absolutely not.|`|z74a7wvlaa	Confirmed catholic does not make you a priest, a bishop or minister. When we are confirmed, we are just a church member and abides with the church rules.<br>  Don't forget the freedom of religion: There is a difference in the catholic consecration of the Holy Eucharist compare to the protestants. The consecration is from the divine liturgy written by St James as instructed by the Lord: <br>  [at the Anaphora]<br>  Then the Priest holds the bread in his hand, and says:— <br>  XXX. Having taken the bread in His holy and pure and blameless and immortal hands, lifting up His eyes to heaven, and showing it to You, His God and Father, He gave thanks, and hallowed, and broke, and gave it to us, His disciples and apostles, saying:— <br>  The Deacons say: <br>  For the remission of sins and life everlasting.<br>  Then he says aloud:— <br>  Take, eat: this is my body, broken for you, and given for remission of sins.<br>  The People. Amen.<br>  Then he takes the cup, and says:— <br>  In like manner, after supper, He took the cup, and having mixed wine and water, lifting up His eyes to heaven, and presenting it to You, His God and Father, He gave thanks, and hollowed and blessed it, and filled it with the Holy Spirit, and gave it to us His disciples, saying, Drink ye all of it; this is my blood of the new testament shed for you and many, and distributed for the remission of sins.<br>  The People. Amen.<br>  The Priest.<br>  This do in remembrance of me; for as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do show forth the Lord's death, and confess His resurrection, till He come.<br>  The Deacons say:—  We believe and confess:|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	No, you mostly just get attacked by them.  After all, aren't they all playing King Of The Hill with the same basic text?<br>  <br>  I believe you have to be ordained a priest before you can perform ceremonies, or at least a deacon.|`|AA11193401	nope|`|qxteTM9Kaa	no
crVFU6lBaa	...Mate, he's just talking about any different religions that arise. Not necessarily scientology. It isn't a prophecy when they speak about things they KNOW will happen - i.e people getting a different religion going. They knew it would happen because THEY made a religion themselves that was different from the ones before.<br>  <br>  Control, sweetie.|`|8Zey1ntAaa	Your cult guide book means nothing to me.|`|AA11923447	I'm a Christian, and I wouldn't classify that as a prophecy about Scientology or any other NRM (New Religious Movement). Do you know how many groups were classified as "mystery cults" even during Paul's time? The existence of alternative religions is not a new thing.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	The same as John gave us the picture of false religion Babylon the Great in Revelation the 18th chapter read it.|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	Paul was attacking anybody who disgreed with him.  If you'd simply re-read the text carefully, he's offered no specifics about Scientology or Mormonism or really any religion active today.  If a person truly had the power to predict specifics, wouldn't you expect there to be proper names or explicit descriptions in their prophecies?  Why wouldn't you?  Because your religious belief would preclude you from demanding such rigorous evidence?<br>  <br>  Then you need a new religion, kid.<br>  <br>  You're claiming to find a needle in a haystack and then showing us another peice of straw.|`|WalnRzfGaa	how is saying something that is obvious to any person with a brain a prophecy?<br>  <br>  there were many other religions at that time as well, there was the Chines and japans religions similar to that of the Egyptians. there was Hindu.<br>  <br>  not to mention the thousands of small tribes out there that had their own religions.<br>  <br>  nothing in your question is correct expect for the obvious statement that there will be more religions after this one. anyone could of figured that out.<br>  <br>  EDIT- oh and i guess telling people they will have eternal life if they accept Jesus isnt a seduction?|`|o4UrRbTvaa	What "religion/cult" doesn't that describe?<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:  solarius, you are my hero|`|ttTDiJWfaa	That is merely your opinion. Sounds like he was talking more about strident "christians" on sites like this!|`|AaKZekyRaa	It's a prophecy that couldn't help but become true since everything that doesn't agree with perfectly with Paul's teachings would be considered false.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	He didn't.  You're reading way too much into that passage.  It could be applied to virtually any non Christian religion at any time in history.|`|KT7cllsLaa	This ''predicament'' can be applied to almost everything|`|hii5wweQaa	it was already happening there have always been strange religions|`|DDFgKxcaaa	another vague prophesy that can be made to fit anything|`|URO3gDXcaa	i predicted this recession 2 years ago.  what does that make me?|`|YLqVv7Lzaa	What Paul essentially said is 'one day someone will stop believing in Christianity and will say things that other Christians don't like, he will then feel guilty'<br>  <br>  Could he be any more vague?|`|eCp0ERSCaa	Error: "..at that time, all there was, was Pagans, Jews, and then Christians." <br>  <br>  I'm not even sure what that means. "Pagan" is too vague to be of any value. It is a useless term, especially in this context. To be more accurate, you need to recognize the rich variety of religious beliefs in Paul's time. You will see that the variety and types of beliefs have changed very little in the intervening centuries. True, Mormonism and Scientology have added a certain Science Fiction element that is somewhat new, but otherwise "there is nothing new under the sun." Paul did not predict anything that he couldn't see by just looking around himself. Remember, he was from Tarsus, the spiritual center of the Mithra cult (a late off-shoot of Zoroastrianism.) Much of his christology is derived directly from this "Pagan" tradition, including hemomancy (blood magic), cosmic dualism, and The Judgment.|`|0c44db9bf3337a894a67a66af6d2192baa	How do you explain me correctly predicting that it was going to rain?<br>  <br>  I stated simply, "From this day forward, water shall fall upon us!".<br>  <br>  And now it is raining.<br>  <br>  Obviously I am the prophet, and the only prophet, that can predict such things.  You must follow me and my god.<br>  <br>  He wants you to give me some Taco Bell.|`|GHdscZ2Haa	Paul predicted that other religions would occur.<br>  <br>  <br>  Wow.<br>  <br>  <br>  I predict that someone will make a new type of cheese someday.<br>  <br>  When that happens will it mean that you will accept me as a true prophet of the FSM?|`|UOIcXs7Haa	I think he was just talking about other religions and cults in general, not specifically scientology.<br>  Besides Paul did have a habit of talking crap it would seem.|`|qSHO1wQtaa	He mentioned nothing of L Ron Hubbard or Scientology itself.  Not a prophecy.<br>  <br>  It however, fits Christianity to a tee.  See how vague statements can be applied willy nilly?|`|Ne9rXERpaa	Geez....would you and Paul just get a room, already?<br>  <br>  And while you're at it, you'll probably need a couple of these...:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH1uo4UcPl4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH1uo4UcP...</a>|`|v6V1eg3taa	A very vague prediction and you find truth in it?

Same goes for non-biblical so-called prophets.<br>  <br>  But that prophecy basically boils down to "People will disagree with what I have said.  They are evil."<br>  <br>  Check it out:  "I'm speaking for Jesus here... buttsex is awesome.  God loves buttsex.  Good, holy stuff.  Also, Jesus says there will be people who deny this truth.  Watch out for those guys.  They hate Jesus."<br>  <br>  My little prophecy at the end there should be fulfilled in the next 10 minutes or so if you keep browsing Y!A.  So you know what I'm saying is true.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Saul, who liked to copy other people who are actually awesome (unlike himself) had one legitimate prophecy, which involved how awesome I am, and so he stole my name.  As soon as I figure out how to make time go the other way we're gonna have words, me and him.|`|vouUQQzBaa	Well not at all. He didn't foresee anything lol<br>  <br>  Translation of that quote: People will move away from the religion seduced by devils. Brainwashed. (read back on the bible, as soon as Moses turned his back, people were making sacrifices and worshiping statues. Already HAD happened prior to Paul)<br>  <br>  Back then there were non-believers, there WERE people who believed in multiple gods, whether we call them pagans or not is irrelevant. You are ASSUMING he's speaking about future religions. But different views were already around before-during and AFTER Paul's lifetime. PURE COINCIDENCE.<br>  <br>  I can tell you as well my predictions, if they come true, does that make me a prophet? (BTW I have made many many accurate predictions lol, I'd still wouldn't classify myself as such)

GqfiRXu3aa	It depends on the circumstances.  If I'm not calling for any specific reason, I don't always expect a call back when I leave a voice mail.  Sometimes I don't even leave a voice mail because the person can see my name on caller ID and knows I called, so he/she can call me back if he/she wants.  <br>  <br>  However, if you have plans with someone and they don't call you back, or if it's been several times and they haven't called you back, then yes, that is rude.

PeOODdgiaa	someone once told me that if you're doubting God/christianity/etc. then that's because God really trusts you (to eventually come back to him and christianity). It may sound far-fetched, but I'll just tell you my personal story and you can make your own decision about it. I'm also a fairly analytical and logic type of person. I've grown up surrounded by christians. A couple of years ago I began to doubt, in got to the point where I stopped praying and believed God was just a story. How could he possibly exist? I began to feel confused and nothing made sense. Science classes only made me more confused. I grew to the point where I was uptight and cranky all the time. My siblings avoided me and my parents frequently asked me what was wrong to which I always said things like "I don't know" or "Im just tired" or simply "nothing". I felt like I was living a double life in a since because there was no way I was going to tell my family I didn't believe - I was afraid of there response. A big mistake I thin people often make is thinking that a good christian is perfect and has never doubted ... well that's totally wrong. I believe. good christian is the one who has doubted and left the religious path of their 'family roots' so they find out for themselves if that's really the right path for them as an indivdiual. The people who grow up and say they've never had a moment where they doubted their faith are the ones I consider 'fake' because they are the ones who don't know WHY they believe. Wondering why and how you can believe such a crazy thing builds your character and strength as an individual and gives you the true piece of mind. Anyway, what happened to me, was I ended up studing things myself - trying to find out how and why anyone could believe something so crazy. I studied other religions and studied christianity. In the end I made up my mind that of all of them I liked Christianity best but I still couldn't accept that something like that exist. I studied christian scientists and began to look at how these analytical people tied their faith in with logic and science. One thing that really got me was the fact that God never tells us HOW he created the world. Maybe he used the big Bang to make it - I can believe that. Also, maybe the world did form over millions of years - the bible says he created the world in one day, but who says that one day for him is same amount of time as one day for us? No one ever said that. As far as evolution is concerned think about the dimensions of Noah's ark. I don't remember the exact measurements but there is no way in heck that all the different species and animals of the world could have fit. so how come we have so many animals then? I tdon't think it's because Noah's Ark never happened - they've actually found proof that it did, christian and non-christians (most of them) agree that according to something about soil formation the earth was probably once flooded in water...hmm. So I think evolution is real. It has to be, all the animals on noah's ark habve since evolved in the billions of species around today. I know I am a happier person since my long bout of doubt (haha I rhymed!), I've only recently accepted God again. I wouldn't say it's made my life easier, but it has my my life happier. Now rather than have a copy of the faith my family has, I have my own. True, it's same faith, but now it's personal because of the journey i took to reach where I am now in my walk with God. I feel like a new and better person. I'm in no way perfect, but I'm happy and other people can tell. That doesn't mean I don't doubt anymore, I still have doubts but I know they make me stronger so I accept as challenges for myself.I still struggle with trusting my life to God, but that's just another challenge and it's part of growing up. I start college next fall and I'm terrified but that's just how life is. For the void in your heart, you may want to hear it, but I think that's need for god to come back in your life. Something else that helps is finding a friend who's christian - especially if they're christian and struggling too, friends like that to support you can really help. I don't if I've really helped or if what I'm saying makes any sense, but I want to help you so feel free to send me a message ( pinkbleach4@yahoo.com ) with any questions or comments. :D|`|IiWz11Kraa	Serious or not?|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	you're not alone.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.exchristian.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.exchristian.net/</a>|`|wtg8vtzBaa	Hey, I'm a biomed engineer major too!

Daily prayer and bible reading can draw you closer to God. Ask God to come into your life because you want to get to know Him better. If you don't have faith, then nothing will make sense to you. Once you understand God and have a personal relationship with Him, it will start adding up because He will put the truth and knowledge in your mind. Didn't God say "Whoever seeks me shall find me."?|`|vDr5aROwaa	If you were a true Christian once, then you are saved, and you cannot lose your salvation, even if you decide to being an atheist, but if you don't turn your life back, you will still go to Heaven when you die, but you will fall in the category of an Apostate.

Accept first the truth that there is a God.  Then the rest will follow.|`|8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	Your question poses several issues. <br>  <br>  First, your Christian background is limited to a denomination founded by one man's vision, a break-away church thus giving you a distorted view of Christianity. Religion is supposed to give you what you need to cope with the trials of every day life, live a moral life and eventually be saved, not "make you happy".  This is a delusion that causes many to leave their faith and is a major flaw in modern Protestantism. <br>  <br>  Second, crazy people don't rise from the dead on their own power, and they didn't have sophisticated special effects crews 2000 years ago, so either Jesus is who He says he is, the Son of God, or he is crazy and millions of intelligent and educated people have been deceived. THAT is insane. <br>  <br>  We Catholics believe that we can know truth by faith and reason. We can know things by reason alone and we can know things that reason cannot tell us. For example, we can know the Big Bang, existence of Pluto, formation of a star, and mathematics from reason alone. We do not need God to tell us these truths. However, there are some things which we cannot know by reason like the Trinity, Virgin Birth, and Incarnation. We can only know those if God told it to us, like revealing them in Scripture. Reason is like the eye. We can see a lot of things with the eye, but we cannot see everything with it.<br>  <br>  Faith is like a microscope or a telescope. We cannot see a cell from the naked eye, but we can see it with the help of a microscope. This is like the relationship between faith and reason. When people think of faith, they immediately think of something that cannot be reasonable. This is not true. Though reason does not produce faith, faith can be based on reason. It can be a reasonable faith.<br>  <br>  With other truths we can know by reason, we can know God's existence by reason. How? From the world. From the effect, we can know the cause. Scripture says, "Ever since the creation of the world, his invisible attributes of eternal power and divinity have been able to be understood and perceived in what he has made." (Romans 1:20) So we can be sure if God really exists by looking at the world and even ourselves (CCC 31). So we believe that since God's existence can be demonstrated, we can be sure if He exists or not. Here are some examples of demonstrations for the existence of God.<br>  <a href="http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/p28.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/p28.h...</a>|`|AA11212224	Okay, first off, I am a Christian, and I also accept evolution.  The love of science and faith are not mutually exclusive.<br>  <br>  Second, I would love to be able to give you a pat answer to help you become a Christian, but the fact of the matter is, there isn't one.  YOU have to decide what's right for YOU.  No one can tell you which path is right for you.  You're going to have to find it yourself.  I'm really sorry you feel you can't believe.  I hope someday you're able to.  But if you're not, that's just who you are.  Don't force yourself to be something you're not.<br>  <br>  But, I do have one piece of advice for you:  Don't settle.  Continue seeking knowledge, from every place you can find it.  Even if you decide that atheism is right for you, don't only read things to support it.  Read the other side, too.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best, and would you mind if I prayed for God to help you?<br>  <br>  And by the way, the Bible never says how old the Earth is.|`|ylZ3cORcaa	You said you want to believe but you just can't.  Take it from there. That means the "seed" of faith is in you.<br>  <br>  The feeling of wanting to believe is the tiny speck of light at the end of the tunnel.  So keep going. Your folks must have been constantly praying for you to see that light, and their prayers must have been answered.  Your loved ones have already done their part, the supreme one has already given you the grace to "see".  Now the ball is in your hands.    <br>  <br>  The void which you feel inside you could be the emptiness waiting to be filled with God's goodness and that is what christians call faith.  It starts as a small seed like that of a mustard, and when it grows, it's so huge that it becomes the biggest tree you can find.  However, you are so pre-occupied by the stuffs you learn in school that made you so humanly logical barring anything that lies beyond human reason.  Your current state of mind and heart completely rejects the essence of faith and its opportunity to grow in you.  <br>  <br>  The theory of evolution and everything science teaches is not bad.  What makes it anti-faith is when man looks at it from his own point of view as a human person where human reasoning serves as the only framework of all that he learns.  Try to loosen your human reasoning a bit and look at things beyond logic.  Think of abstract ideas sometimes like feelings of love, patience, kindness even though how illogical they can be.  This is tough but I believe once you do this, abstract nature of creation will slowly reveal many things to you that will complement your logical thinking and start making wonders for you to search.  Once you reach this point, keep searching while armed with logic and abstract concepts you now have.  This will gradually open your mind to see beyond what human reason can see.  And if at this point faith presents itself, just let it come and occupy that void in you.  Believe me, it will be the most magical thing you'll ever encounter in this life.  <br>  <br>  Bless you!|`|fyKydb6Iaa	I don't think that you are an Atheist, like many who say they are Atheist it is more of a matter of a lot of questions and concerns, basically they do not know enough to be Atheist.

My suggestion is that you stop battling and repent and believe.  I am also under the impression that you've heard the gospel seeing that your parents serve God.<br>  <br>  However, if you are only concerned about how you parents feel and you really don't care, one way or another, about if there is or is not a God then I can't tell you how to "fix it" with your parents... they know that you are headed for Hell and that will torture them all the days of their lives.<br>  <br>  Which is it?

Theirs is a convincing argument, and since you are required to do nothing as an atheist, theirs is the easiest to follow.  I am sure that your dad as a pastor could show you what you need to know.  I bet you haven't told him that you have atheists leanings.  You are at an age when the testosterone starts to flow, big time, and it is natural to rebel against our parents at that age.  We want to do it our way, and we really want to resist authority.<br>  <br>  This is a natural place you are in and we all have been there.  What is important is, that you do not turn your back on Christ.  Realize that there are a lot of evil influences in your life right now, and they want you to go down the tubes with them. Misery loves company.  Don't do it, Each day ask God to show you what you need to see, and He will. Pray for wisdom to make the right decision and I know you will do that too.|`|jGhOJKl5aa	Well being anti-religious myself, I can tell you that your beliefs are probably more than correct. <br>  <br>  The fact is, is that the bible is full of fictional stories, not meant to be taken literally, but since it at the time (hundreds, if not thousands of years ago) was the best explanation of where and how we came to be, it was taken literally and sadly, there are still people who take it literally, regardless of what science and other greater knowledge has proven. Trust me, those who claim they are religious are far from it. If a person wants to actually be fully religious they cannot swear, they cannot commit a "sin", which is utterly ridiculous.<br>  <br>  And, yes I know people will disagree with me, but being open minded and actually thinking religion through can help. And you are being open minded, unlike a lot of people who stay closed minded who believe immediately what they are told.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, you do not need help. Believe in what you believe, because it makes you a better person. Don't feel alone, feel special, simply because you aren't believing in a childish character who is apparently within the clouds, funny we don't see him when we're on a plane or going into space.|`|niYixDU4aa	first of all....hell is a myth.  don't beleive in that crap.  why would god make people suffer like that? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ok so you think we evolved from monkeys?  ok how were the monkeys created?  how was that created?  then you will probably wonder how god was just there from the beginning?  well no one can really give you an explantion.  you just have to beleive.  i'm not really good at this preaching stuff.  but just pray even though you don't believe, no matter how hard it is.  if that helps even a little....read the bible too.  no one can make you beleive but YOURSELF.|`|trxEyVRLaa	This is a simpe thing to answer. If you don't believe in God, accept your non-belief. If you accept it every one else will too. I personally strongly believe in God and Jesus - But there are some parts of the Bible like God creating Earth in 7 days or whatever it was definatly isn't true. My whole family is Christian but my brother isn't sure if God exists. You may not believe in God as a person, but if your family want you to believe in God you could start thinking about him as..er...nature? love? Just something that's all around. There's no reason why you shouldn't be allowed to not believe in God. So if you don't believe - then don't feel as if you have to, because that'd make you something you're not. :)

For example here in Canada that man who beheaded the young man on the Greyhound bus, claims he heard God say to kill this young fella. Well, God says in His Word, "Thou shall not kill". So there is no way this was from God. However, if a person claims to hear from God to do something that is in line with the character of God and it brings a benefit of goodness or mercy to another, then that is probably God.

The church is not opposed to people's rights as citizen's of the US and children of God.  But, the church also will not stand idly by and say that "sin" is OK just because people have the "right" to it.  It's not about taking away people's rights, it's about standing up for the gospel of Jesus Christ.  People have a right to view pornography, the church leaders have firmly counseled us as members to avoid it like the plague.  Does that make us hateful toward those who view porn?  No.  Same with same-sex attraction.  We know everyone is a child of God, with temptations and same-sex attraction IS a temptation and one that some give in to more and more often.

Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, “Peace to you!” 27 Then He said to Thomas, “Reach your finger here, and look at My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it into My side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing.” <br>  28 And Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord and my God!” <br>  29 Jesus said to him, “Thomas,[a] because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”|`|gplfqOEHaa	According to john 20:24-29, Thomas wanted to,<br>  <br>  "unless i see in HIS hands the imprint of the nails,<br>  and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into HIS<br>  side, i will not believe."(20:25)<br>  <br>  And he was shown what he wanted to see and still was accepted as a believer.<br>  <br>  And thats where I saw a loophole in Christianity.<br>  <br>  If Thomas can get away with what he wanted, I can live a life in what ever way I want and if on Doomsday I find out that Christianity was the truth and see Thomas entering heaven(which you Christians believe that he will), I can easily challenge God that I wanted to see It too but It never revealed Itself to me as the God who choosed Christianity as the final word and due to that I waited before accepting Christianity.|`|Fpi8im9taa	Is it logical to believe that nothing exploded and made everything?<br>  <br>  No, but who thinks that?<br>  <br>  Your first claim is ridiculous and in a word, idiotic.

The only question worth answering is the first--is it logical to believe in the big bang--the original theory predicted that a cosmic background radiation (the energy signfature of the big bang) should be found coming in all directions in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum.  A few years after the big bang was hypothesized--researches at Bell Labs while looking into microwave reception and transmission (this was back in the 60's) created the "dish" antenna so familiar to us all now--and low and behold--discovered a microwave background radiation where it was predicted--coming from all directions.  The signature of the big bang as it were.  So yes--it is logical to accept the big bang hypothesis because it has confirming evidences--by the same token it is equally as valid to reject the abrahamic god hypothesis as it can be readily shown that many of the stories in the xtian bible are plagarisms of much earlier mythologies.  it can further be shown that there is 0, zip, nada, evidence for many of the "big" biblical stories.  On that information alone--yes--it is logical to accept the big bang, and reject the abrahamic sky moneky.|`|m3YC7Jcyaa	Jesus nor Moses ever confirmed them or wrote them down. No one around them wrote anything down. After they left most of the people were slaughtered or murdered less one. Do you get it yet?<br>  <br>  I can't seem to understand why anyone would ever believe a book like that, that is the devil's plan. Jesus can't hear a damn word they say, he is beyond gates and an alter they have to die to see him and let him hear their prayers. They are praying to the wrong thing, the Lord is the creator not the created. AstugfarAllah... its so simple its stupid.<br>  <br>  Jesus put Al Jinn in the swine, anyone eating it is also taking in Al Jinn = the spirits. Look left they have been watching you this entire time, when do you think you are going to put that tainted book down and see the truth for yourself, the devil is into everything you do and you allowed that. Most Christians and Catholics allowed that by not understanding how to be clean inside and outside.|`|vouUQQzBaa	ohh wow LOL..I'll try to be nice here.<br>  <br>  There were ONLY 2 people Adam and Eve in this world, they had 2 sons and later on the 3rd.  <br>  <br>  Is it logical to think they committed incest? And the sons had sexual relationship with the mother?<br>  <br>  Is it logical to think that Eve therefore must have reproduced like a rabbit?<br>  <br>  Is it logical to believe (yes the Church says to give blind faith there lol) all the B.S. the Bible says which BTW was written AFTER all these people were dead? How the HECK am I supposed to believe ONE single word about that?<br>  <br>  However I do believe on the Big Bang theory. I believe there were dinosaurs (ohh wait..where does it say that on the Bible? *blink*). I believe humans somehow descend from monkeys (go ahead, read up on the prehistoric men)|`|wia35rNKaa	This jump loses me...<br>  "But the BIBLE is not about logic, it is about GOD(YHVH), and human logic does not apply to HIM."<br>  You can pretty much apply that to anything that does not have an answer, but just reaplce the words Bible and God and it fits for pretty much anything.<br>  <br>  "Is it logical to reject The BIBLE because it is not logical?"<br>  YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  <br>  I think one of the best things I ever heard was....yes I believe in god, but I dont follow any religion. <br>  That is perfect. <br>  I have no problem with a "god", a supreme being that had his hand in the creation of everythign to an extent, but the god of any religious teachings here on earth is not believable. There is no way that one is right and the rest wrong. I think they are all wrong. And if you just stduied the bible, I woudl think you would come to dismiss it or at least question it as well.<br>  And when I mean study the bible, i am not talking about reading the bible. I am talkign about figuring out who wrote it...when...was there a chance of manipulation and leaving things out, adn adding thigns later, and it is not a factual accoutn of things...why were some books left out and others added. Seems a bit too coincidental that all these stories by different people had an underlying "truth." Does that mean it is true...no, but it leads it open to the fact taht things were cahnged to make it all work together. The bible was written as a way to convert people to their religion...OF COURSE it needed to sound good and have a good story that flowed together and answered questions that came up.<br>  Abandon, for the time being, that the bible is the word of the lord, or inspired by god, and look at it from a skeptical point of view, and TRY to poke holes in it. It wont be too hard to do. Once you do that, then try to go back and believe what it says...I hazard a guess you wont be able to, unless you play the god did it or faith card, in which case, you will never be able to look at something with different eyes. <br>  Imagine you had to debate the other side...you had to prove the bible was not the actual word of god. I would say it is much much easier to disprove the bible than to prove it.<br>  The other thing I love, is when people agree the bible may not be 100% accurate etc, yet still believe in a lot of things. That is like believing the Lord of The Rings is not real, yet still believing in the things in it. The whole reason you beleive the things you believe is because hte bible says so. Well if the bible is not real and was made up, then the foudnations of your belief is a lie, and your beliefs should be abandon as well.|`|qSHO1wQtaa	Is it logical to believe anything that has mounds of evidence for it.

If the existence of god isn't a logical argument, why do you spend so many words trying (and failing, by the way) on logical arguments trying to prove god exists?<br>  <br>  By the way, in your "is it logical" section, you made at least 10 incorrect statements of fact...so your logic isn't based on real information, simply your own ignorance.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|LjsRfaskaa	Did you know that in experiments with salamander and frogs eggs.

There is NO OTHER WAY for any of your sins to be paid for and forgiven.|`|UK7vxGU3aa	You see this passage is talking about casting out demons in Jesus name (notice it is not any other name). <br>  <br>  The Apostles thought that only they had the authority to cast demons out under Jesus name because they where the ones that where always with him. Now understand that the Gospel was shared and witness among thousands of people and thousands of people also excepted the Gospel that Jesus was teaching. There for just as the apostles received salvation, the word of God and his Power so did all the others who believed in him and followed his word. So when Jesus states "for whoever is not against you is for you" He is talking about other believers, people that we don't know, but practices, believes and lives the word of God.<br>  <br>  Remember one thing in order for anyone of us to cast out any demons we all have to have the power of the Holy Spirit and the proses of getting the same power is the same proses everyone must follow.<br>  <br>  so it is not talking about someone from another religion or someone that has a different believe. It talks about that who ever is not against what Word of God teaches us and is following it just as we are is apart of us (in the body of Christ).<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	I think you are on thin ice when you use 1 verse to justify things.  You need to look at the ENTIRE bible.  There are OTHER verses which talk against consorting with spirits and magic, and things which are associated with pagan religions. <br>  <br>  So why do you ignore those verses, but latch onto this one?  Why not interpret BOTH of them together and realize that YES,  those who HELP and do Charity Work should not be stopped.  BUT, that does not mean everything we do is OK.  Charity work is one thing, consulting spirits is another.|`|uAMzmAwaaa	"Where does it say he was saved?"<br>  here: "we saw a man driving out demons IN YOUR NAME..." so obviously the person was doing it in Jesus' name (sounds like a follower of Christ to me).<br>  <br>  besides Jesus also said in luke 11:23 "He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me, scatters."

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist?

In fact data in the UK shows that the straight community are more likely to be positive nowadays. I am not gay but my best friend is gay and the thought of someone I love being discriminated against in this way angers me a lot. I think its like comparing being gay to someone who has abused drugs and used unsterilized needles. <br>  <br>  Anyway to get off my soap box and answer your question I can not find a definitive answer on whether you can or can not in america, but in Canada you cant.

It is the same gospel and word.  The word of Jesus Christ.  It is only a more accurate accounting of the gospel because it has not been through countless translations.  Because their are not books that have been lost or omitted from it.  God knew that the scriptures would be changed by evil and designing men.  He made allowances for this fact by bringing forth a second witness a second book of scripture that would clarify the plain and precious parts of the Bible that have been lost, and would testify that Jesus is the Christ.  <br>  See this link:<a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/2_ne/29/3-4,6,10#3" rel="nofollow">http://scriptures.lds.org/en/2_ne/29/3-4...</a><br>  <br>  Think of it in this way.  You have a recipie for chocolate chip cookies that has been given to you by someone else the only thing is that the salt has been left off of the ingredient list.  You make the cookies and to you they taste very good. Then someone gives you another recipie for chocolate chip cookies.  You see the added ingredient of salt.  Do you reject the recipie or try it out?  If you try it out you discover the cookies taste better, more like they were intended to.<br>  <br>  The same goes for the Bible and Book of Mormon.  The analogy is the same.  Now you ask we Mormon's to prove to you from the Bible that their is a need for the Book of Mormon, but you are still looking at the recipie that has been tampered with.  <br>  <br>  Their is only one way to know if the Book of Mormon is the word of God.  That is to read it with a sincere heart and with true intent and then to ask God.  I quote here from Moroni 10:4-6  and ask you to sincerely consider the Book of Mormon.  If it is scripture, which I testify to you that it is, you will be held accountable for it's teachings as well as the Bible, so it is important to find out for yourself.<br>  <br>    4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. <br>    5 And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things. <br>    6 And whatsoever thing is good is just and true; wherefore, nothing that is good denieth the Christ, but acknowledgeth that he is. <br>    7 And ye may know that he is, by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore I would exhort you that ye deny not the power of God; for he worketh by power, according to the faith of the children of men, the same today and tomorrow, and forever.|`|ac0d4c45bf78507770b21657ff6f8f59aa	"Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder.

They deserve to be cleaned out because they are SO willing to pay for the "You so handsome, I love you" bull and amazingly they believe it !!  There is no fool like an old fool, especially a Western male in China.  <br>  <br>  I have no respect for the women either, they are whores, trading sex for gifts and money, but the men are the stupid ones who let them do it to them<br>  <br>  The sad part though is the familes these old fools dessert and who suffer the consequences.|`|CvSKPHiqaa	hehe. i would say that they are both using each other so game on!!
FOzN3xwzaa	Nobody today is under the law of Leviticus, so it doesn't relate in terms of keeping rules (we're not supposed to even try and keep the rules). <br>  <br>  There are many pictures of Jesus in Leviticus  :)  Which is always exciting to see  :)|`|sy7ytm9Kaa	In my opinion, the relevance of Leviticus to a daily life of a Christian is that the book reveals over and over that God required blood atonement  for sin.  Jesus' blood was spilled to atone for man's sins, making the sacrificial offerings of animals was no longer required.|`|VxrsfAfyaa	As a Christian, I consider it irrelevant.|`|ULUpOqplaa	It doesn't apply to our modern life in many ways.

Leviticus. <br>  <br>  Most of Leviticus doesn't relate to daily life - at least, not in this culture. Much of what's written there passed away when the New Covenant was completed. (aka, when Jesus died, was buried, and rose again.)|`|AA11521494	Christians seem to ignore all of it except for the two little verses that condemn homosexual sex.  Why those keep getting quoted but nothing else from Leviticus beats me.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

They are of one substance - each of them having the one identical essence or nature. <br>  The Trinity is the central dogma of Christian theology. It also is one of the most difficult doctrines. Don't even try to understand it as a simple mathematical equation. It's God. Even using the numbers 1+1, those are separate units. God is not separate. A cube would help visualize it  - one whole unit with equal sides of the same substance.<br>  Really, give it up, the finite mind cannot understand the wholeness of God.|`|ylZ3cORcaa	To those who believe:<br>  <br>  God cannot fight Himself.  He's not crazy to inflict "injury" or "injustice" to Himself.  The Holy Spirit exists because of God's love. <br>  <br>  Whether you believe in the doctrine of trinity or not, you know that God does not fight anyone except the devil.  God is love, and to fight anyone runs counter to what He teaches us.<br>  <br>  Now, just for the sake of argument, let me share with you my opinion.  If ever this most impossible thing happens that God fights himself (the Holy Spirit who is the result of the immense love between the Father and Jesus, the son), then love will cease to exist in God's kingdom and in the entire universe.  No one will ever emerge as the winner, everyone loses including you and me.  All of God's creation will be extinct since all was created out of God's love which is now gone.  Entire universe will be in chaos as it collapses and dies forever.  <br>  <br>  You may say God must be crazy to do this.  Yes, and I'm just glad He is not.  God bless us all.|`|GEcdCoz1aa	The Holy Spirit is God, they are the same person. Just like you have a soul and a spirit, and a body.

VG7k5QRFaa	Heck no.<br>  <br>  1. Whites don't report most crimes that occur in their neighborhoods in order to keep the standards of the neighborhood up.<br>  <br>  2. Crimes committed by blacks are given more attention, are labeled in terms of race (unlike white crimes), are reported more, are treated more seriously.<br>  <br>  3. White collar criminals (mostly white crimes) get plea deals while blue collar criminals (mostly black crimes) are forced to serve their time out.  <br>  <br>  4. Whites are unsympathetic to black cries of improvement to neighborhoods, equal funding for schools and increased job help.  Whites can get this if they wish and yet they are still the top serial killers, school shooters, wife beaters, financial criminals, drug manufacturers, wife beaters, rapists, etc.<br>  <br>  5. Blacks lose their jobs more often and it is harder for them to get jobs or schooling and yet many keep trying.  Son of Sam was in a good job in the post office and look at the murders he committed without showing an ounce of compassion.|`|tvzzSCSGaa	No, the American government is. America has much longer prison sentences than Europe, (for almost any offence, in England for example a typical life sentence means 15 years). America also has capital punishment, Europe doesn't. Yet the levels of crime in America would shock any European nation. People need to be punished for crimes of course but it makes more sense to prevent it before it happens. In England, working class white boys tend to fail at school and get sent to prison more. In America, it tends to be non whites. It has nothing to do with colour. It has everything to do with social disadvantage :- people being born into often poor inner city areas with high unemployment, substandard education, low expectations, discrimination, the list is endless. Sociologists claim that poverty can produce disaffected youth that have a ''look out for number one mentality'' and can become socially deviant.Of course that is not true in all cases, there's always the exception to the rule. A lot of different races in America live segregated, there are areas of extreme wealth and extreme poverty, ''white flight'' from neighbourhoods. It's easier said than done but the gvmt should step up and do more, provide better education, youth services, opportunities and a way out. That would lower the crime level|`|0651510ee77f85030276f24fa5f8244caa	Sorry honey....I don't think minorities are the problem right now!!  Take a look at Wall Street, the banks, Bernie Maddof, ENRON etc!  Now that is where the real crooks are and why this country is in the state it is now!<br>  <br>  As for others....lack of education leads to lack of work which leads to you get the picture!  There needs to be a resurgence in helping the uneducated learn and make sure our kids are not growing up without a decent education.  Education, education education!!|`|hqvPk8WIaa	Ask Bernie Madoff and all other white white-collar criminals, whether Enron or bank CEOs, etc etc. Ask Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, Ed Gein, John Wayne Gacy, The Unibomber, Son of Sam or any other of the long list of white individuals who have been mass murderers.|`|O4YhMhXVaa	No, the president is in the minority.

XqpRYh52aa	I was a Christian,then I studied the bible for myself.<br>  Now,I'm an atheist.|`|muHctmaGaa	My family was Catholic, and I was always skeptical. I don't believe I ever followed anything from church because I was either too young to understand it or never found comfort in its teachings (like being terrified of death and rejecting the idea of Heaven). I read the Bible a lot in church and sort of detected the metaphor/mythology early on. Then was too lazy or disinclined to research other religions before writting them all off.|`|hYzfzu9yaa	Raised Christian. Then turned agnostic. Now atheist.<br>  <br>  First step - read the Bible. Left Christianity.<br>  Second step - studied many other religions.<br>  Third step - realized I didn't need or believe in any of them.|`|AA12181796	A fetus. I haven't always consciously been an atheist, but I've never believed in God.

Strangely my mum was quite upset when I would not get married in a church|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	I was born without any beliefs in gods, hence an atheist.<br>  <br>  I was raised as a christian.<br>  <br>  Then I did the research about god-beliefs, and became an atheist again.|`|9Ur1VL9Paa	I was raised as a Catholic; but I never for one day of my life considered myself as Catholic. By right I was an Agnostic for 17 years before I decided to become an Atheist.|`|gQEFy4BVaa	We are all born atheists. I was raised Christian, but I was never a believer as far as I can recall. It wasn't any particular religion that I had a problem with, it was the very idea of 'god'.|`|jkW2b55Qaa	I were a general non-believer, or one who didn't really know what to believe.<br>  <br>  Now I am an atheist as well as an anti-theist, as I beleive religion is harmful.|`|QpF6Tjtiaa	catholic, non religious theist, deist, agnostic, and finally atheist.<br>  <br>  it was a slow progression for me|`|UO3i8BqVaa	The only thing that 'made' me become a-theist was the FACT that there are NO invisible space chappies messing about in my life.<br>  My life is real, healthy and mostly good; I couldn't ask for more.<br>  ~|`|b164e8d4d76ceb0d7f6bd403bdc7ecd8aa	Originally I was christian but not a practising one, then i became wiccan for about 2 years in high school.... then i got some common sense and became atheist.|`|JOankL0eaa	Agnostic Christian.|`|zq8s9gtwaa	Sikh.

I'd change my shyness and not make me so sensitive. I wish I was good at words, and I wish I didn't speak with an unknown accent...  Really, all above falls into the accent factor, so if I never grew up with it, I would speak up, have confidence in myself, wouldn't be so shy, wouldn't be as sensitive about it, and I wouldn't be as afraid of self failure...|`|uF7In6yoaa	lol noub, 10 dollar bills are for grandmothers pearls like you<br>  <br>  now real hustalz like me use humans for toilet paper|`|qkmxkVnuaa	my ability to hold grudges|`|3uiIrxojaa	my size lol|`|0K9p9OPfaa	My sensetivity.|`|4aveC2aaaa	i want to be able to do everything on time. not delay washing the dishes, not do my chores late in the morning, etc|`|n49i9t6paa	lol, NOUB she asked what you could change, not what you want<br>  <br>  lmao...NOUBster...you told me in your other question to check my mail...I got nothin from you|`|K5nwQfnjaa	I would change the anti-social parts of myself.|`|kkO87h0Xaa	Procrastination.|`|IEaedB5Eaa	I would make me taller. :-)<br>  <br>  loool@my size, good one

ed6dd97680f16853ceee083850fe8bd6aa	When the world gets into such a bad way that it is agreed to have a world government. It won't be long after that when one world religion is the only one allowed and all others are forbidden. Its happened in totalitarian states before (and still does). It'll come. Soon enough.|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	Certain practices, such as inducting children into these cults will one day be illegal.  But religion itself never will be.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	It's already been proven right, with the existence of God for example. <br>  <br>  Ilegal or punishable reminds educated people of the death of Socrates in Athens. You might want to reword that so it doesn't look like what it is, namely you telling people to act like you.|`|PjwWWMu4aa	I hope never.<br>  <br>  Like Dan Dennett, I hope for religion to be changed into a more gentle beast, harnessed and made tame and non violent. Banning it would be a flagrant violation of human rights.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	It's highly unlikely it will ever be so.  Do you really believe in preventing people from believing as they wish and speaking as they wish, within certain public limits?  I don't.|`|qEYYHNyyaa	Hopefully it will be a choice people make, not forced upon them by oppressive governments.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Never|`|rFFYCmOGaa	As much as libertarians (like myself) would oppose or not care for religion but would hesitate to pass laws against it, at some point, perhaps after some major catastrophe with religion at it's root cause, legislation that would categorize it as "hate speech" that would be backed up by a constituency that has grown sick and tired of the same old bickering would probably seal such a fate.|`|yN3fWUCuaa	If you're like the rest of the atheists out here, you detest the intrusion of theist-based laws into our government.<br>  <br>  Certainly, then, you should detest any law denying one's right to practice a religion.|`|n55igpCUaa	Private practice will always be protected in the constitution.<br>  Organized religion, public demonstrations, and fervor will be illegal in the US by 2040, Europe and Canada by 2030.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	I think there is already plenty of evidence that all religion is mythological but even as an atheist I would never want it banned. Intellectual freedom is a value I have.|`|Fpi8im9taa	Never. At least in America, that's what makes this country so great: that we can practice (almost) any religion that we want.<br>  <br>  Your bigotry is showing.|`|bK5MJCxhaa	Hopefully never.  I'm an atheist, but I'm no fan of that level of governmental intrusion into people's lives.|`|Q4MqzxX7aa	In my dreams!<br>  <br>  No really I think everyone should be able to worship whom ever they like|`|hii5wweQaa	soon i hope for all our sake|`|g8EViy1Raa	As an atheist who hopes that, as time goes by, less and less people will be fooled by religion I would hope that religion is never actually illegal.  The government has no right to tell you what to think or believe even if what you think and believe is completely irrational.|`|rHqe7oMoaa	How do you propose we go about proving it wrong? By that I mean, unless someone legitimately comes back 'from the dead' and says "nope no God" and brought back a way for us to test it (and show it to be true with the scientific method) then I don't really see how it can be done. <br>  <br>  Why would it be illegal/punishible if it were shown to be conclusively false? Have you heard of the "Flat Earth Society"? These people believe that all the evidence we have regarding the Earth is wrong, and that its actually flat.<br>  <br>  Stupidity and ignorance are not illegal.|`|uK3tkaOJaa	It should never be illegal to believe in wrong things.  It should only be illegal to act on them in certain circumstances.  I think we'll always have religion with us.|`|212F2EO0aa	Within 5 years.<br>  <br>  FEMA and other EO have all the pieces in place to declare martial law and retain anyone without warrent or charge.<br>  <br>  Christian whose oppose the NWO will be first on the list.|`|VxrsfAfyaa	It is protected in the US constitution and in many other nations too.|`|EiyhWrwwaa	It's already been proven wrong, but I hope it will never be illegal.|`|QvlL83AJaa	When a Xian like Obama makes it that way.|`|Bq0gqw7qaa	When hell freezes over?|`|OywIJxobaa	go to China, if you want to live in a place where it's illegal.

LhCGU3F1aa	Slaves? Thats so rude. My neighbours are very hard working filipinos. The father is so freaking smart, yes your right, hes really talented. He can basically build anything. I wish my stupid dad was more like him. Hunny, rasism exists all over the world. In many countries the lighter ones are more prettier, which is pure bulls8t. Honestly, how are kids going to get education if their parents are working crap jobs back home? Might as well migrate to some other country with your kids, or send money back home. My dad works at this company, and this new filipino guy moved her about a year ago. His families coming here in june, he needed some help, so we gave him our old furniture and stuff. Trust me, filipino people are so kind! They are very loving people. :)<br>  I live filipnos:)|`|kANR98tIaa	Slaves? Name these countries? All I know that in this modern world/era, there is only sex slaves. <br>  <br>  Yes, filipino's can be, but the main factor holding them down, is family. They can't help looking back in the past, although some are succesful, but those successful filipino's, you can see that they are all alone. They were selfish, did not support their family, so instead he looked into his future other than carrying a burden of "work to feed, abandon your dreams so we can live"|`|pfke6Jieaa	i dont think they work as slaves what r u talking about? we had a lot of filipinos in iraq and most of them were working for professional companies there back when iraq was a rich country before the war. only few were maids but the rest were professionals and had no problem living there. they even knew how to speak arabic which shows they respect the culture.|`|J03Qy5aoaa	Actually you only really see this with the islamic population, they ship Filipino women to arab countries as mistresses.  They could have been the 51'st state, now look where they are.|`|AA12369549	Not all filipinos work overseas as slaves, some are professionals and expert on their fields, example are engineers in middle east, seamen, IT Specialists in singapore, Nurses and many more.  Philippines is still a developing country and the ones who prefer to be maids in the foreign countries are mostly composed of people who had finished only lower education or did not finished college or high school due to poverty.  If you are on the shoes of this people who didn't have finished a degree, you would only think of working as domestic helpers could save poverty.  It would not always mean that you will work as a domestic helper in your entire life, Most filipinos are intelligent and most of these domestic helpers save their money and make some small business in their homeland.  They don't just waste money and a work of a domestic helper isn't easy.|`|BCuIcYRqaa	They don't look up to whites, you are right<br>  Anyway i never knew they did.<br>  I know that is what many illegal latinos do here in the USA  <br>  <br>  Whites control because most are evil and stick together with their evil.<br>  Most other people in other countries don't stick together when it comes to fighting. The ones that do are not conquered by whites.<br>  Has nothing to do with their intelligence, anyone that thinks that is crazy|`|afQBWPWzaa	Well I am a filipino, in the Philippines they need money to help their family and buy food. we have talent.... NO matter they talk trash to filipinos they need money. Really hard to fine money now. The community and economy is hard this century... ( A lot of filipinos look like chinese,mexicans, and etc. They have mix of blood or genes )|`|rvZtro2uaa	definitely agree!!!!!|`|eoxx8KKPaa	Working as maids in hongkong is not limited to fililpina, but also thai and indonesian, and they are not slaves. They work under the protection by the hongkong law. <br>  <br>  Of course, some employers treated them badly and have been punished by the law, but majority of them treat them as a regular employees as everyone else.  Many of my relatives in hongkong helped their fililpina maids immigrate to canada with them, so you can see their relationship are very good.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the reason why the development of philipin  always stays below east asia all because of the corrupt government.  Thats something you guys should deal with.|`|8G42oyydaa	You said it yourself, they lack the will to change their situation. As in they arent interested in becoming American, or any other driven Westerner<br>  <br>  Its cultural, you cannot expect everyone to conform to a Western way of thinking. Why should they? You apparently determine success on material possessions and money. Most cultures in this world dont, stop thinking you could or should  impose your cultural values on others and respect their right to their own beliefs and culture.<br>  <br>  Different standards, different values, different goals, different expectations.  The world would NOT be better place if everyone became a rat on a wheel consuming as much as they possibly could, using up way more resources than they have to or IMO are entitled to, creating mountains of trash, all in the name of material possessions.<br>  <br>  Who do you think is happier and healthier as a majority in their own culture? People driven to the point of having heart attacks, road rage, killing stress, frantic to keep up with the fanatical consumerism or the culture who takes life slower, easier, and places more value on families and just being happy and doesnt need 2 or 3 cars in every driveway, a 70 inc heTV in every room, a swimming pool etc <br>  <br>  I think the person who has the most friends, and the closest family members wins, not the one who has the most toys and the pacemaker to prove it

qMcTeBavaa	I bump into people I haven't seen in years on a routine basis. To the point that it doesn't even surprise me anymore. <br>  <br>  There are also what's referred to as a "doppelgangers." I grew up with a guy that looked so much like me that teachers we saw every day couldn't tell us apart. It was interesting, ten years later, when his father brought his son into the bar I was working at for a drink; his father looked from his son, to me, back to his son, down at the scotch I'd served him with some suspicion, back to me and back to his son.<br>  <br>  About the only noticeable difference between the two of us is that I have brown eyes, this guy has blue eyes. His father was terribly confused for a moment or two. <br>  <br>  I don't think it's fate. These things just happen. I was at a beer booth at the State Fair when the guy serving the beer looked at me and asked if my name was Damon. I'd been standing there, coupons in hand, thinking he looked familiar. Sure enough, it was a guy I worked with more than 20 years ago. <br>  <br>  It happens. If you want to contact him, dig up his phone number. If you don't want to contact him, then don't. I wouldn't creep out over it.<br>  <br>  D|`|AA11263450	Too much coffee?  Naw, it's just the weird parts of our brains that sometimes latch onto our strangest desires then can't let them go.

0j61Cewwaa	Crikey. You're having a pretty rough time by the sounds of it.<br>  I have to say it sounds like the problem may be the company you work for and the town you're based in. Is it a small town somewhere? Somewhere with a bit of a 'closed-mind' attitude?<br>  <br>  I've met many Germans over the years (one of my closest friends is a German who lives over here in England) and most of them have been very friendly and approachable. They generally like the opportunity to practise their English, and find the UK an interesting country to hear about. The fact they're making your life a misery sounds like it's a very close-knit community.<br>  <br>  Are the American bloke and Spanish girl having problems too?|`|QkIJEG1Gaa	are you in the former east germany?

Been there, done that adjusting to living in a foreign country. <br>  <br>  How do you approach them and what do you talk about? I find while living overseas the people who constantly referred to their home country and how things were done there, made comments about how they miss this or that, or say their country is cleaner, more advanced, more modern etc etc wont make friends.<br>  <br>  Those who are interested in local culture, food, entertainment and history and make NO comparisons are those who make friends and are included,  Ask them questions about their country, their cultures, their history - <br>  <br>  I could go one forever about everything I find appalling and miserable and hard to put up with in China. But as a person living there, and meeting Chinese people I tell them their country is so beautiful, and the people so friendly, and I love their country !  I say I just love the history and standing on the Great Wall or the banks of the Yangtze river was SO moving for me because of the history.  <br>  <br>  I sympathize with their dislike of certain other countries and nationalities because of their history of occupation and horrible things, like the Nanjing massacre. I dont discuss things I dont agree with, like Mao, they seem to still feel he was some kind of hero.  I dont try to convert them to my way of thinking or my culture.<br>  <br>  I compliment them on their food, I admire their products for sale.  I join in with their culture and respect it.  I have gotten so used to giving a little head bob, a standard greeting in China that people at home now think I am odd. When I get off the bus I thank the driver, I call him "shifu" (phoetic) which means "skilled master", I dont refer to him as "driver". Little things ..  <br>  <br>  Show respect, show interest, show appreciation and never never never say "In America, or Canada or whatever,  we do it this way".|`|dDas43FZaa	I lived in Germany for 6 years after high school and played on a German soccer team (only American) and they stared at me too.

O6EqTO6vaa	They basically don't want to answer the question because most likely, they don't have the answer to the question. They know that if a conservative asked a question and also has the facts as well, they can't do anything about it because the conservative proved their point as well as asking a question that intertwine with the facts. So they name call or attack you for asking the question. They call you out on your grammar or spelling too. They try to take the attention away from the question. That's why they personally attack you on YA. If some people really did have another point of view or if they actually thought they were right, they would type it out and prove it. They wouldn't have to talk about your spelling or attack you about a question you have. Today, more people try to follow others and think they believe in what others think. They can't be a leader and have a mind of their own. Since they are followers, they don't have anything to back up their statements or any point of view. Think about it, if they did fully believe in being a liberal, they would answer your question and have a really good debate about it.

An unclean spirit (a devil, if you will), being a case of arrested development, never got the bequest of the first estate, lacking several important human characteristics and faculties.  <br>  <br>  Because of either this incompatibility or because there is contention on the network of the host's nervous system, possessed people typically exhibit some symptom of conflict.  The only cases of possession that I ever heard of without such a symptom would be Judas and, possibly, Cain -- they were just fine with what the parasitic spirit wanted.<br>  <br>  In the case of the swine, then, a different species would be much harder for an evil spirit to control than a human being would be.  The spirits could not prevent the swine from committing suicide.  Either the swine had their standards, or possession is a painful and unwelcome experience.<br>  <br>  Of course, my older brother insists that swine, not blinded to the spiritual world like humans are, saw the evil spirits coming, in effect said, "No way!", and stampeded to avoid the spirits altogether.  Or perhaps the gist of their cries was, "Over my dead body!"  (Though that would be silly, since possession would no longer have been possible.  How about that? an unclean animal being too sacred and/or smart to agree to host an evil spirit.)|`|znt2s3sMaa	Having all those evil spirits in them all of a sudden just drove them insane.<br>  <br>  "For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, and of love and of a sound mind" 2 Timothy 1:7<br>  <br>  They were probably nice normal, peaceful pigs, with no spirit of fear....and after those spirits got in them, they were no longer loving pigs...but scared, and they certainly didn't have a SOUND MIND anymore. <br>  <br>  Just my guess...|`|98db094f444e5154c3fcacd3e51e23c2aa	Are you a mormon?<br>  <br>  Its funny how some christians. eg 'Light and Truth ' say its because eating pig was against the eating habit or laws of the time.

And, I have a bachelor's degree in HR. <br>  <br>  I just went back to my HR textbook for Trans World Airlines V. Hardison 432 U.S. 63 (1977). The book is Employment and Labor Law by Cihon and Castgnera, 5th edition (2005), page 117-118. <br>  <br>  The ruling on Reasonable Accomodation in terms of Discrimination based on Religion and National Origin <br>  <br>  "Even when religion is not a BFOQ and the employer is not within the Section 702 exemption, the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of religion is not absolute. Section 701(j) defines religion as: includ[ing] all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonable accommodate to an employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business." <br>  <br>  However, the issue is that undue hardship is not clearly defined, which is why, when I am working in HR, I cannot guarantee a worker the right to have Sundays off. <br>  <br>  BFOQ = Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (for instance a pastor's religious belief is an essential qualification to be a pastor). <br>  <br>  Your fiance would have to prove that the company can accommodate his religious preferences without an undue hardship on them. And, a company can require Sunday work if that is a requirement of the position and alternating the schedule would make an undue hardship. <br>  <br>  In the case I outlined above, the case went through the appeals process, because the employee was in a seniority based system and transferred into a job where he was lower in seniority in the union. It was ultimately argued that the employer had the right to enforce the work. <br>  <br>  Think about it....when your fiance insists on a certain day off each week due to religious beliefs, does it not mean that another employee must work on the same day to give him a day off. Is that fair to the other worker? <br>  <br>  When I worked on Sundays in the restaurant, you may be interested in knowing that all 4 of us managers wanted Sundays off to attend church. It was not possible to give all of us the busiest lunch period of the week off. <br>  <br>  Also, as a Christian, if you feel that Sundays are wrong to work, can you assure that you will never create work for another person on the same day? That means that you would also agree not to use electricity, water (a utility worker has to be there to monitor those items). You will not go out to a restaurant, go shopping, or do any form of entertainment that requires another person to work. Can you also ensure you will never use a hospital, police, fire, or any other service that requires a person to work on Sundays?<br>  <br>  As a Christian, I understand that you both want to honor the Lord by honoring the Sabbath, but I also know that there are positions that require work on that day. The best way to eliminate this is to ensure that you and other consumers don't create a business need for services on that day. The malls, movie theatres and restaurants are filled with people who attend church and then go shopping or out to dinner.

4H9zv8lAaa	To the person whose avatar is named “Amazing” I know you were probably joking, but I am still a little perturbed by your generalization simple because there are those who may take you seriously.  Most White people are NOT racist.  In fact, a lot of us have in-laws or even aunts and uncles that are American Indian, Black, Hispanic, or Asian.  I’d be willing to bet if you went back far enough in your genealogy you would see that you aren’t as “White” as you may think you are.<br>  <br>  The President of the United States is a Mulatto; he is half Black and half White.  Mulatto is a term that hasn’t been used much since the slavery days, but back then it was very popular along with quadroon (1/4 White) and octoroon (1/8 White).  There are also reverse Quadroons (1/4 Black) and reverse Octoroons (1/8 Black), but because their features are primarily White they are considered White.  They are also sometimes called “racially indeterminate,” which is considered a less kind term.  However, it would be impossible for you to ascertain any of this from their behavior or just by looking at them.<br>  <br>  It’s like the guy said about the dot and the piece of paper.  If you have a thousand White people at a ball game having a great time and ONE starts screaming racial slurs it makes it look like the whole group is racist and that just isn’t the case!|`|zTuc5eDIaa	Damn, Marvin pretty much nailed it.<br>  <br>  Even if a stereotype is largely true, we should try to avoid it as much as possible, just for the sake of the the few exceptions.|`|8iJe2S2Daa	Yes, white people should openly admit that they don't know much about any other race/culture that is not their own and that most of them are racists.|`|jiMAtaCraa	Your assertion on what forms a stereotype is heavily biased. Not all stereotypes are formed because the majority ascribe themselves to a certain behaviour or characteristic. In many cases, it is what the minority does that makes it appear as being representative of a whole group. Such can be seen even with a simple case of drawing a small dot with a black pen on a white piece of paper. What do you notice first - the White paper (majority) or the small Black dot (minority)?  <br>  <br>  It's also flawed on the premise that it conforms to a sort of collectivist philosophy, wherein people are not judged as individuals, but are judged on the certain traits the group they belong to are deemed as possessing. This inevitably supports and gives rise to racism, discrimination, sexism, among a long list of other "isms" because of the opposition towards the trait the group they adhere to is perceived as possessing. It is to say that being a police officer shooting a Black passerbyer on the basis that the week prior a Black person robbed a shop as alright. It is to support the suppression of Muslims going onboard aircraft due to the incident of 9/11. It is prevent Men from having sexual intercourse on the grounds that there are more Male rapists than Female rapists.<br>  <br>  It is undoubtedly a sick way of seeing reality. I'm not responsible for my next door neighbour's activities, and neither are you.|`|4Vmlf902aa	I've got one simple rule: If you, just you not your whole race, don't fit into a certain stereotype just ignore it.|`|QsVMeaPXaa	Marvin, you were doing pretty well there, but lost me at "It is prevent Men from having sexual intercourse on the grounds that there are more Male rapists than Female rapists."<br>  <br>  ????
bRLCxmP6aa	I've never been to Scotland, but some of my family is from Scotland and I'd love to go.<br>  <br>  There aren't a lot of Scottish programs available on television - the last obviously Scottish program that appeared on my Public Television Station was Taggart.
AA12181796	When I told my Catholic mother that I was an atheist, she went "Oh. Okay, then" and went back to reading her magazine. I couldn't imagine having parents who would be angry with me for my lack of religious beliefs. Perhaps other people's parents are just a lot less easy going than my mum.|`|AA11058044	That is weird.  I'm not sure why there would be such a fear of telling their parents.<br>  <br>  I think it's probably more of a cultural expectation, as part of the larger American culture, where it seems to be expected that everyone is a member of some religion.<br>  <br>  I went to a Catholic school in Canada, and the ratio in our Religious Studies class was about 40% atheist, 40% agnostic/apathetic, and 20% avowed Catholics.  Most of the atheists reported that their parents were well aware of their stance.|`|YyEEAJBkaa	Debates between schoolmates or workmates usually contain a certain amount of brave talk and you have to allow for this in both what you say and what you hear.|`|Yzcptoagaa	Breaking with religion usually means confronting the previous generation.  Religion is primarily spread from parent to child.  I guess they're just surprised that you had the guts to do it.  Maybe they want to get out of the house before they create that kind of conflict.<br>  <br>  I'm surprised there are high school student espousing solipsism.  That's a pretty "out there" philosophy for a teenager.|`|7dN1ANT4aa	I would say that there are definatley more atheists now then ever, but some of them are closet atheists. It does matter where you are geographically and socially though. Illinois is generally a pretty progressive state and a science and math school would probly have more atheists as well as more closet atheists that would come out.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	There are atheists and agnostics but more likely you are dealing with people who are just apathetic.|`|io7nHB3Oaa	Are you in rural Illinois?

dPi7zMxWaa	okay if you have a big backyard walk your friends out there as far as you can go sit them down on the ground and you and one of your friends walk around them in circles and say bloody Mary and then go hide behind something it will scar the pee out of them if you don't want to do that get on of your parents to go outside your bedroom window and tap on it and smear blood on it the best way to do that is to have a really scary movie on.|`|xZA35cqraa	watch scary movie b4 bed, the when there nearly asleep, jump and scare them|`|AA11259554	Find the most scary movie you know like The Exorcist if your parents will let you but that is an 18 and its pretty terrifying. Look for a book of ghost stories in the library. Also try looking for a book of urban myths as some of them are grim and scary. Look in a joke shop for masks to wear or face paint so you can paint freaky designs on each other. Buy gummy sweets like snakes and spiders and make jelly with them in.|`|cYsPx9sSaa	you could record scary noises in your spare time onto a recorder, from youtube or tv, or just make your own, then watch a horor movie with your mates, and late at night, when your all awake but the parents are asleep, play the tape, dont make it obvious, scare the hell out of your mates, have fun, and happy birthday for then
91fcc8b613eebc31050dad00a0ce0943aa	thats a good question i dont think that race should come into consideration when applying for a job or college because it doesnt matter what race you are what matters is the way you present yourself and the qualities you have and if that person is not qualified then that person is just not qualified race should not come into account regarding that <br>  <br>  when i fill out applications i never state my race i just mark other|`|oUBUWfS6aa	Employers may legitimately need information about their employees or applicants race for affirmative action purposes and/or to track applicant flow. One way to obtain racial information and simultaneously guard against discriminatory selection is for employers to use separate forms or otherwise keep the information about an applicant's race separate from the application. In that way, the employer can capture the information it needs but ensure that it is not used in the selection decision.<br>  <br>  Unless the information is for such a legitimate purpose, pre-employment questions about race can suggest that race will be used as a basis for making selection decisions. If the information is used in the selection decision and members of particular racial groups are excluded from employment, the inquiries can constitute evidence of discrimination.<br>  <br>  The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission<br>  <br>  My opinion:<br>  Jobs may ask so they can have a fair amount of race working. It's not fair to have ten white people and one black person to be working at the same job.<br>  <br>  As for college, I agree with the poster above me. They ask for stats rates at the college. Colleges don't really base on race. It's all about grades, test scores, etc. Also, the college doesn't want to be looked down upon.|`|UHfA9yHPaa	I don't think they should either.<br>  <br>  It's because there are certain races who will get more lee-way, so to speak. And I'm not gonna list which ones do, but anyhow all of you know it's true that some races do get favored more than others. Cough, cough. <br>  <br>  And it always looks good to have a "diverse" workplace, it makes it seem friendly and etc. It's all about the reputation, and not about the actual work put out. <br>  <br>  *But don't get me wrong. Anyone from any race can be a great worker.*<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh yeah, same thing for colleges. More diverse college = looks better.|`|fpyLWbVxaa	No its illegal for jobs but most colleges will look into it not many do anymore though|`|zTuc5eDIaa	Public universities are especially guilty of this. They ask for your race because of racial quota laws. Also they want to seem "more diverse" because it makes it seem like they are not discriminating against minorities. The truth is, if they accepted applicants based entirely on grades, test scores, and overall academic merit, the vast majority of the students would be white or Asian, which isn't good for the college's reputation. (Note I said "vast majority" not "all" so please don't get uptight you PC liberals.)<br>  <br>  As for job applications, employers are usually required to submit that information to the government for statistical purposes. Sometimes they will use that to give a minority an advantage over a white person, but not as much as colleges do.|`|pDmTRG82aa	i agree. but colleges dont want to seem "racist" so they would much rather turn down a white guy who has good grades and take in someone else who isn't white with bad grades just so they can say "if we were racist then we wouldnt have so and so who isnt white"<br>  <br>  and you cant really blame the colleges moreso as the people who accuse the colleges of being racist<br>  <br>  although in the past some schools have been racist so I guess I cant really judge the accusers too much.|`|hfGE5jieaa	They don't want to seem unfair (too late) by having a student population that is made up of one race.|`|3YXAZFKzaa	i dont know why.<br>  i never really thought about until now...<br>  <br>  i think they shouldnt ask.|`|CEChcfKwaa	I've never been asked my race on a job application. As for colleges, it is for statistical information.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	It isn't for the college and employers to take into consideration. It is a requirement by the government. The information is sent to the government so they can track the ethnicity of the students and employees and 'strongly urge' the college and the employers' to become more diverse or be  labeled racist or anti XX  ethnicity.

Native Americans are their own race.|`|8Nqq7tkwaa	we are our own race and there are about 2 million of us in the usa and another million in canada|`|AAgX0SDcaa	The government classifies them as a separate race. Personally I don't believe in race just ethnicity. Race was created by one group of people to control other groups. Consider the Aborigines of Australia, they are most closely related DNA-wise to North Koreans. Most people wouldn't guess that by looking at their outward appearances. Some of my ancestors were Cherokees, many had paler skin and lighter hair colors than other groups of Native Americans, but are still classified the same race.|`|O7w6XGqPaa	The Census Bureau has a separate category for Native Americans versus Asians.

T1beLIQqaa	65% (both modern and ancient Egyptians) were Arab Semitic White. Here we go again-this seems to be a very popular question.Most are Arab(Semitic White) and has been since 5,000 B.C..When the Arabs conquered and settled the area now known as Egypt(Arabic name given by the Arabs(Semitic Whites)-the area had no name before this The Black leaders of Nubia/Kemet which made up the southern quarter of Egypt(lost to the Arabs) and Sudan, made a pact with the Arabs so as not to be destroyed and permitted to to become Pharoahs, hence some Black Egyptian Dynasties(800-700 B.C.) much like the Indian Police and scouts when the European Whites drove out the Indians in America.This is based on fact and often gets many thumbs down and disagreements by racists,including many Blacks.<br>  <br>  The Egyptians are Arabs(Semitic Whites).The pre Egyptians were Black(mostly Nubian, some Nilotics).Nubia/Kemet(making up 1/4 of southern Egypt and the remainder in Sudan) was conquered by the Arabs-the Black Nubians making a pact with the Arabs to be Pharaohs.<br>  <br>  The feaures of the Sphinx are White by facial structure-the nose being busted away could have provided more clues-the thin lips, high forehead, and recessed jaw are Caucasian (White) features.<br>  <br>  ******ARABS (SEMITIC WHITES) AND BLACKS ARE TWO DIFFERENT ETHINICITIES.ARABS ARE GENERALLY SWARTHY(olive colored/golden brown skin).******<br>  <br>  Because people live/or originated in Africa, does not make them Black, but Africans, much like being American does not mean everyone is White.<br>  <br>  The builders of the pyamids were Arabs(Semitic Whites-yes like Jesus and other Jews, and, Arabs and Jews ARE related) and as proven by genetic(DNA) tests on the mummies, anthropological measurements, and asking the Egyptians themselves. Egypt is an ARABIC name-no name prior to this, existed for Egypt.Before the Arab invasions and pyramid buildings,pre- Egyptian Black Africans did inhabit the area in ancient(keyword) times(before Arab-Semitic White invasions and settlement).Most were driven out by the Arabs(Semitic Whites),much like the European Whites drove out the American Indians in America -the few remaining, intermingled(mixed unions producing descendants) with the Arabs, some even making pacts to become Pharaohs(i.e.-Nubians/peoples of Kemet), much like European Whites allowing Indian police and scouts.Many of the people on wall art are, in fact, Black Egyptian slaves(also some free) as well as peoples of other ethnic backgrounds-much like in America, and the difference shows up in the use of different pigments and physical features drawn-many standing side by side.Many drawings, paintings, statues, and other likenesses of King Tut do exhibit both Black and Semitic White physical characteristics, most notably in his facial likeness(even this varies the spectrum from Arab(Semitic White) to Arab(Semitic White)/Black admixture). He is portrayed anywhere from light brown skin to dark black skin.<br>  <br>  Because Egypt is in Africa, many Blacks, as above, erroneously claim Egypt as Black , when it has NOT been since at least prior to the pyramid building about 5,000 B.C.-MUCH AS IF THE AMERICAN INDIANS WERE TO CLAIM ALL OF AMERICA IS INDIAN.Egypt's culture and foods are Arabic, far different than Black culture and food. Many Blacks often point to Anwar Sadat as being Black. In fact,he was half White(Egyptian-Semitic White) and half Black(Sudanese mother)-denied this until shortly before his death).<br>  <br>  Present day Egypt is 65% White(Semitic Arab)-comparable to 70% of the White population of the US- and 35% nonwhite(predominately Black admixtures and Black, with the remainder Asian(Oriental and Non Oriental(Indo Ruropean Aryan), Indo European Aryan-Greeks, Romans, Turks,Iranians/Perians, etc., and other Semites(mainly Jews)).<br>  <br>  To my Black friends and others, bottom line, Egypt(an Arabic name) is Semitic White and has been since the building of the pyramids based both on history and genetic(DNA) testing on the mummies and yes, some of the Pharaohs(i.e.-Nubia-result of pact with Arabs(Semitic White invaders)), were, indeed, Black-MOST were NOT, being Arab(Semitic White)-please, read your history.Before Egypt(the Arab(Semitic White) given name), as it is known today, Blacks did inhabit the area, but it had not been invaded and settled by the Arabs(Semitic Whites) and given the name, Egypt,its Arabic name, again very similar to European Whites invading and settling America.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, for those who claim Cleopatra was Black, thousands of busts, drawings, paintings, and other likenesses(i.e.-coins) of her, along with written descriptions of her, from that time period, exist.One look and you can tell she is NOT Black(did not say she was Semitic White/White either,but definitely, not all ,if any, Black either), although she may possibly have some Black ancestry.<br>  <br>  The scholars seem to agree: Cleopatra was the last in a line of Ptolemies--Macedonian Greeks(Whites)--who ruled Egypt from the death of Alexander the Great in 305 B.C. until Antony's defeat in the battle of Actium in 31 B.C. The Ptolemies, as was the custom, were an incestuous, intermarrying peoples (to preserve the royal bloodline),also often having relations with the courtiers and concubines who filled their palaces. Many of the children born of these unions were given a place in the royal lineage despite being illegitimate, the secret unspoken.<br>  <br>  Many believe that Cleopatra's father was the product of such a union--his mother may have been a concubine from Nubia(Black) or Alexandria(White). Lending credence to this theory is the fact that Cleopatra's bond to the people of Egypt seemed greater than those of her Ptolemic ancestors, who aligned themselves culturally and linguistically with Greece. <br>  <br>  Yes, as I acknowledged, BEFORE the pyramids, Arab(Semitic Whites) invasions, and Egypt identity, Blacks did populate the area.Technically, Egypt did not exist, so those Blacks are really not ancient Egyptians any more than the American Indians can be called ancient Americans.Show me any kind of scientific proof that Blacks(not including slave labor),and, NOT, Arabs(Semitic Whites) built the pyramids.<br>  <br>  An even better question might be,why do so many Blacks want to claim and insist, Egypt, a majority Arab(Semitic White), Arab culture, food, music, identity, and pyramid building as their own against all factual evidence instead of hearasy? Black Heritage has much Ancient art work an herbal medicines they can rightfully claim as their own rather than trying to claim Arab(Semitic White) Heritage.<br>  <br>  From the time of the pyramid building Egypt has retained about 65% Arab(Semitic White) majority, 35% Black/Black admixture,Indian, and Asian ratios.Anything prior to that, was an area populated by Blacks, but not labeled Egypt(an Arabic name) hence, not really Ancient Egypt or Architects of the pyramids.<br>  <br>  Arabs(Semitic Whites) and Blacks ARE two different peoples despite many racists(including many Blacks) wanting to claim otherwise-totally different food, cultures, music, physical characteristics(ethnic characteristics)-side by side, the differences are readily apparent.Why many Blacks insist, contrary to evidence, Arabs are Black, I do not understand.Being swarthy alone, does not make it so, any more than Indians, Asians or any other swarthy ethinicity would make it so. <br>  <br>  MODERN ETHNIC SAMPLINGS OF ARAB(SEMITIC WHITES) COMPARED TO BLACKS<br>  <br>  Arab(Semitic Whites) Americans: Lebanese heritage: Ralph Nader, Jamie Farr(Clinger on Mash), and the late Danny Thomas.<br>  <br>  Arab( Semitic White) Americans: Egyptian heritage: Dina Powell, Rami Malek<br>  <br>  compared to:<br>  <br>  MIXED: half Arab(Semitic White)-Egyptian/half Black(Sudanese): Anwar Sadat and King Tut<br>  <br>  Black Americans: Bill Cosby, Denzel Washington, and Will Smith<br>  <br>  Clearly, you can tell the sets of men and one woman, do NOT fit in the same ethnic classification.The late Anwar Sadat, was half Arab (Semitic White)-Egyptian and half Black(Sudanese), many of the same features attributed to King Tut, whom most likely, was also bi-racial.<br>  <br>  When Blacks and Egyptians(Semitic Whites) intermarry, Black traits do dominate(i.e.-Anwar Sadat-(Egyptian Semitic White Father-Black Sudanese mother)).<br>  <br>  Homo sapiens idaltu, (similar to modern Blacks/N*egroid features) whom had Black features and Cro Magnon(similar to modern Whites/Caucasoid features) whom had White features, lived in Africa about the same time-both forms of Homo sapiens, now extinct-modern humans are a subspecies of Homo sapiens-Homo sapiens sapiens to be exact-so you can not say the first humans were Black or White.Also, the indigenous(originating there) peoples of Maghreb(the term is generally applied to all of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, but in older Arabic usage pertained only to the area of the three countries between the high ranges of the Atlas Mountains and the Mediterranean Sea). are classified as Aboriginal Caucasoid(resembling/<br>  appearing White/Caucasian).<br>  <br>  The Hamitic THEORY is outdated by DNA testing(haploid groups) and anthropological measurements.The Hamic people have been portrayed from Black to White(Semitic and/or Indo European Aryan) to an admixture. <br>  <br>  HELPFUL LINKS:<br>    <br>  <a href="http://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpress.com/2008/07/22/the-faces-of-ancient-egypt/" rel="nofollow">http://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpre...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/enbp/pbs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/enbp/pbs.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_in_africa/v032/32.1keita.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_in_...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Gates" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Gat...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.catchpenny.org/race.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.catchpenny.org/race.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/RaceOfAncientEgypt.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/R...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://naturescorner.wordpress.com/2008/12/13/where-the-ancient-egyptians-black-or-white/" rel="nofollow">http://naturescorner.wordpress.com/2008/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://connection.ebscohost.com/content/article/1030876701.html;jsessionid=F297D4F420700ED29340B14CB" rel="nofollow">http://connection.ebscohost.com/content/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.egypt-tehuti.org/articles/egypt-bible-similarities.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.egypt-tehuti.org/articles/egy...</a>|`|MXYWSsM7aa	Well, if you're talking of the Biblical Egyptians then they are the ones that enslaved the Jews for 400 years. After Joseph came and made them a strong nation during the seven year drought they'd forgotten about that and got scared for they saw the Children of Israel growing stronger by number and so they enslaved them. <br>  Egypt in the Bible is a type of the world to the Christian. As the Lord took the Children of Israel out of Egypt so He has taken us out of this world. Joseph knew that one day they would all leave Egypt for he prophesied this when talking about his bones being taken from there.Exodus 13:19.<br>  I hope I've help answer your question.

87e7b956696278de07838481b900732caa	Why? Because your child is three years old. It's normal for a child that age to not yet speak clearly, so don't get ahead of yourself. A lot depends on how much exposure your child has to [proper] language. Wait until your child begins kindergarden to worry if he/she has a speech impediment or not. In the meantime, just make sure you pronounce words correctly around him/her and coax him/her to imitate you when he/she mispronounces a word. Don't be pushy about it though; make a game out of it but don't try to force him/her to learn it right away. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lifespy.com/2007/how-to-help-a-child-speak-clearly/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifespy.com/2007/how-to-help-...</a>

283tO9j9aa	You don't just decide, it just kind of happens. If you actually make a decision to do it all of a sudden then it's probably a phase or a rebellion and you'll grow out of it. Believe me, I used to look normal and found that the clothes I bought made my wardrobe darker and darker. I decided to get an emo haircut. Eventually I started getting told I was a goth and I hadn't really realised I looked like that to people. I'm 21, not 15, so I can see it from a slightly older point of view rather than "I hate my parents"- I moved out almost three years ago.<br>  <br>  Anyway. If you're prepared to make your own clothes or make the best of what you already have/can reasonably afford, that shows you have the dedication to an alternative lifestyle rather than just wanting to look different to shock your parents. Remember that being goth or emo is not about telling everyone how dark and depressed you are, or bragging about hurting yourself- essentially these people are the same as anyone else but they follow different fashions. They choose to fit in with a different group rather than the majority.<br>  <br>  Honestly, people who go 'oh goth is so lame and all these kids in black cut themselves' are idiots. Yeah, I'm calling a lot of people idiots. I see the goth scene and various other musical subcultures from the inside and they're no different to anyone else. I see Pagans in their fifties, old punks, goths with kids.

It is about seeing the beauty in the darker things in life, usually referred to as morbid fascinations. Both the goth and emo subcultures involve music. Listen to the music of whichever you prefer. Goth is NOT emo, nor is emo goth. Are you trying to fit in with a particular group or something? If so, they will greet your attempts with scoffs of "poseur" most likely.

40c85b996c134163f45223b2c362cd80aa	Josh, <br>  <br>  As many people have explained to you already, the "Viking" language was Old Norse.  Although it is a dead language, if you really want to learn it, you still can, just like you can still learn Latin, Old English or Classical Greek, which are also dead languages.  There are both courses available online, books, and several universities teach it (please see my previous answer in response to the question "Is there a simple name for the Viking language?").<br>  <br>  However, the closest *modern* language to the Old Norse which the Vikings (aka "the Norse") spoke is Icelandic.  Iceland was founded by the Norse.  <br>  <br>  You could go about learning Icelandic exactly the same way:  there are online courses available, books, and it is taught in several university language departments.  The "Teach Yourself" series also has an Icelandic book & audiopack, which you can probably find at a large bookstore like Barnes & Noble (or Chapters if you're in Canada) or you could order it order from Amazon.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Icelandic. It still contains most of the features of the oldest Norse language.|`|w3plOs6uaa	It's called "Old Norse" That's its simple name.<br>  <br>  This website is an introduction to Old Norse:<br>  <a href="http://www3.hi.is/~haukurth/norse/" rel="nofollow">http://www3.hi.is/~haukurth/norse/</a><br>  <br>  Here is an English-Old Norse dictionary"<br>  <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/language/Engli..." rel="nofollow">http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/language/Engli...</a><br>  <br>  A book you might look for is:<br>  "An Introduction to Old Norse" by E. V. Gordon and A. R. Taylor (1981)<br>  <br>  If you are *really* interested in the langauge, there is a discussion group you can join called "Old Norse Net" (I'm a member of it).<br>  <br>  Old Norse was spoken between the 8th century and 13th. By the 14th century, Old Norse had splintered into the current Scandinavian and North Sea languages: Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Icelandic, and Faroese.<br>  <br>  It's kind of like how English is decended from a language we call "Old English" or "Anglo-Saxon" (two names for the same language - the language "Beowulf" was written in).<br>  <br>  Nobody speaks Old Norse anymore - like Old English, the language is extinct. However, Icelandic is very close to what Old Norse was like.<br>  <br>  I hope this explains things well enough for you.|`|5s3uFazlaa	I think it would be Scandinavian.

It may be a combination of those principles.<br>  <br>   It will not have anything to do with the Satan, Old Scratch, Beelzebub, or any of the other names attributed to the Christian devil.

qMcTeBavaa	As an agnostic and history buff, I have to think that it's more along the lines of classical conditioning. <br>  <br>  In short, the human race went from a hunter/gatherer society, to an agrarian society. Religions sprung up as the river valley civilizations began. The river valley civilizations, an agrarian culture, revered fertility, which is about the time that we start seeing idols that are impressively well endowed. <br>  <br>  Thus fertility has been emphasized for a few hundred centuries. <br>  <br>  As men took to the fields and women took to the households and raising children, fertility became even more emphasized. The mother had a daughter that could help her with her chores, the father had a son that could help him in the fields, with the cattle, etc. People prayed for fertility, both agrarian and sexually.<br>  <br>  So, here we are a few thousand years later, when someone who "spills the seed" is considered abhorrent. Women are worshiped for the size of their breasts, men are measured by the size of their penis and testes because it symbolizes fertility. And people who have sex without reproducing are seen to be as disgusting as land that won't produce a crop.<br>  <br>  I couldn't even blame it on religion if I wanted to. It's classical conditioning, Pavlov's dogs if you will. We've been trained to look for fertility since before the evolution of true religions. A person that can't, or won't, reproduce, seems a waste of time.<br>  <br>  D|`|Ji1DVABtaa	To imply to that all religions are intolerant of homosexuality is propagating the kinds of lines that keep the devisionists happy.<br>  If people in general would think in terms of facts rather than being motivated by fear, there would be more tolerance in general.|`|sVkBdQ28aa	Yeah, I mean it's entirely natural so it's fair to assume human's have somehow had influence over it.. but then that human had to feel that way to begin. Only fair assumption is the first person to say that it's wrong actually said something else, and it's been mistranslated through time.|`|hyYWX82Eaa	Nah, people who want to hate will find a reason to no matter what. If they had to they'd go back and quote aristotle I imagine.<br>  <br>  I know plenty of gays of faith, so I figure it's all mixed up.|`|8tYaHBEKaa	Religion is a longstanding obstacle yes, but even if it were disbanded then Homosexuality would still be shunned and despised to this day. The unfortunate unacceptance of certain individuals is not due merely to Religion but also to the fact that people find something they don't quite understand, frightening. They don't understand that people can love who they want so what they don't understand they attack, verbally or physically. It's a sort of basic primal instinct if you look at it that way. That is also why bisexuals get a lot of stick from both communities because they simply don't understand. Now if Religion was to go, then things would change yes, but you will never, ever, get rid of those "trolls" who insist on not understanding. And that in my eyes is a great shame.|`|xKoaQgp8aa	Yes... Religion is what leads others to believe that homosexuality is wrong/sinful. It would be extremely hard for anyone to protest the idea of "Gay Marriage" without the bible telling them that marriage is between a man and a women and is a sacred bond meant only for heterosexuals. Homosexuals like myself would not be frowned upon by others who do not understand it as often, if they had nothing to back their ideas of right and wrong.|`|EfIXhZdqaa	Hate is not a natural occurrence. It's human nature to be accepting of everyone. The only reason that people hate another group of people is because there has been that seed planted in their heads. That seed usually comes from family or religion.<br>  <br>  So yes, without many current religions the human race would be much more accepting.|`|iuyYfQHmaa	No. Religion isn't the source of peoples hatred or unacceptance. It comes from their own phobias, and then they impose their phobias onto their spirituality, and then organize it into a religion. Don't use religion as a scape goat for peoples stupidity, and fear.<br>  Peace!|`|2lim0SHvaa	Religion is the root cause of hatred, racism, war, poverty, ignorance, and immorality.<br>  <br>  Keep religion out of politics, out of the public square, and stop allowing religion to function as a tax free business.|`|wgtjMcjEaa	Probably would, but people are always judging others, religious beliefs put aside...|`|yr0UZVZAaa	yes, most definitely.

In cultures not influenced by the Bible, like the Japanese, African, or Native American peoples, they managed to be quite religious without being homophobic.|`|AyEkA6Flaa	It depends on if you are talking "religion in general" or "religions which want to control and dominate the lives of their followers".<br>  <br>  I belong to a gay-friendly Christian church body (ELCA Lutheran), and Episcopalians and United Church of Christ are also LGBT-friendly.<br>  <br>  There is now a sea-change toward gay acceptance happening among Protestants, and I think it will slowly spread into other groups as well.<br>  <br>  But to be sure, those religions which try to dominate and control are a problem -- and sexuality is only the beginning.

Lawful unto you (for food) are all four-footed animals with the exceptions named."<br>                                    [Al-Qur’an 5:1]<br>  <br>  "And cattle He has created for you (men): from them Ye derive warmth, and numerous benefits, And of their (meat) ye eat."<br>                                    [Al-Qur’an 16:5]<br>  <br>  "And in cattle (too) ye have an instructive example: From within their bodies We produce (milk) for you to drink; there are, in them, (besides), numerous (other) benefits for you; and of their (meat) ye eat."<br>                                    [Al-Qur’an 23:21]<br>  <br>  <br>  3.   Meat is nutritious and rich in complete protein<br>  <br>  Non-vegetarian food is a good source of excellent protein. It contains biologically complete protein i.e. all the 8 essential amino acid that are not synthesized by the body and should be supplied in the diet. Meat also contains iron, vitamin B1 and niacin.<br>  <br>  <br>  4.   Humans have Omnivorous set of teeth<br>  <br>  If you observe the teeth of herbivorous animals like the cow, goat and sheep, you will find something strikingly similar in all of them. All these animals have a set of flat teeth i.e. suited for herbivorous diet. If you observe the set of teeth of the carnivorous animals like the lion, tiger, or leopard, they all have a set of pointed teeth i.e. suited for a carnivorous diet. If you analyze the set of teeth of humans, you find that they have flat teeth as well as pointed teeth. Thus they have teeth suited for both herbivorous as well as carnivorous food i.e. they are omnivorous. One may ask, if Almighty God wanted humans to have only vegetables, why did He provide us also with pointed teeth? It is logical that He expected us to need and to have both vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian food.<br>  <br>  <br>  5.  Human beings can digest both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food<br>  <br>  The digestive system of herbivorous animals can digest only vegetables. The digestive system of carnivorous animals can digest only meat. But the digestive system of humans can digest both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. If Almighty God wanted us to have only vegetables then why did He give us a digestive system that can digest both vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian food?<br>  <br>  <br>  6.  Hindu scriptures give permission to have non-vegetarian food<br>  <br>     1. There are many Hindus who are strictly vegetarian. They think it is against their religion to consume non-vegetarian food. But the true fact is that the Hindu scriptures permit a person to have meat. The scriptures mention Hindu sages and saints consuming non-vegetarian food.<br>  <br>     2. It is mentioned in Manu Smruti, the law book of Hindus, in chapter 5 verse 30<br>  <br>        "The eater who eats the flesh of those to be eaten does nothing bad, even if he does it day after day, for God himself created some to be eaten and some to be eater."<br>  <br>     3.<br>  <br>        Again next verse of Manu Smruti, that is, chapter 5 verse 31 says<br>  <br>        "Eating meat is right for the sacrifice, this is traditionally known as a rule of the gods."<br>     4.<br>  <br>        Further in Manu Smruti chapter 5 verse 39 and 40 says<br>  <br>        "God himself created sacrificial animals for sacrifice, ...., therefore killing in a sacrifice is not killing."<br>     5.<br>  <br>        Mahabharata Anushashan Parva chapter 88 narrates the discussion between Dharmaraj Yudhishthira and Pitamah Bhishma about what food one should offer to Pitris (ancestors) during the Shraddha (ceremony of dead) to keep them satisfied. Paragraph reads as follows:<br>  <br>        "Yudhishthira said, "O thou of great puissance, tell me what that object is which, if dedicated to the Pitiris (dead ancestors), become inexhaustible! What Havi, again, (if offered) lasts for all time? What, indeed, is that which (if presented) becomes eternal?"<br>  <br>        "Bhishma said, "Listen to me, O Yudhishthira, what those Havis are which persons conversant with the rituals of the Shraddha (the ceremony of dead) regard as suitable in view of Shraddha and what the fruits are that attach|`|2652ba9a7c4b6c7d461554ae484d484eaa	...........<br>  <br>  Just repeating....<br>  <br>  <br>  Scientifically both plants and animals are having one basic unit common i.e. cell. It's contents are remarkably common except few like chlorophyl, centrosome, plastids, vacuoles etc.These cell constitute the whole body of an animal or a plant. <br>  <br>  Now basic difference being it's inability to create sound [ cry ] when broken /eaten /plucked, a plant or vegitable, can not make it eatable, ethically and logically. <br>  <br>  People eat vegitables just becoz they don't scream or cry or BLEED. The only purpose of production of fruits in the plants is to propagate it's kind and not to feed humen beings. Then why do we eat fruits or vegitables ? <br>  <br>  There may be a reason that blood of the killed animal generates guilty feeling, which is red and like ours becoz of hoemoglobin. But then the blood of plants, incidently not red, is as important as red blood. We love to kill kockroaches just becoz they dont have red blood. <br>  <br>  The canines are the teeth which are not found in Herbivorous animals. The fact that canines are present in humen beings make it clear that humen are Omnivorous as the God meant us to be. Humen are having long and very peculiar kind of intestine meant for digesting both meat & vegitables. The intestine of herbivorous animals can not digest meat. You can not feed meat to a sheep and grass to a lion.

iEnI3WSmaa	If logic and reasoning are applied, the result is that there are no pink unicorns nor leprechauns because there is no evidence of those beings.<br>  <br>  Most religions claim supreme beings and rules of conduct based on those supreme beings.  Without any evidence for said beings, no one will "discover" the religions' materials without people evangelizing the products of that religion.  So, built into most religions, is some sort of scheme to promote the religion.<br>  <br>  Just look at all of the people who did and who will quote from the bible on this one, and then they will provide proof of my argument.|`|TJRMNDHPaa	Christianity, and the like, are classified as "Universalizing Religions." That means that they attract people from all different ethnicities around the World. Because there are many other religions that have similar beliefs about God, they have to push theirs to get more people to join. Also, they are only as strong as the amount of followers they have. Churches get money from their patrons, remember?<br>  <br>  Other religions, like Atheism and Buddhism, that don't believe in a higher power welcome those that feel the same way. They accept other's beliefs as long as the other respect theirs. There are some exceptions from this, but not many, and most are single people who are vehemently opposed to the idea of a higher power.|`|HbCWNCQzaa	Timothy 4:3-4 (New King James Version)<br>  3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; 4 and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.|`|Rb30AJlvaa	Athiests don't need publicity?

Locke said we don't appreciate the world and all of God's greatness in it because we are so accustomed to it.

The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

The Book of Mormon isn't true, but I don't think something like skepticsannotated can really demonstrate that.

Gods feet alone can cover the whole Earth.<br>  <br>  Jesus responded, “Yes, it is as you say, ‘but I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven” (Matthew 26:64). <br>  <br>  Read below:<br>  <br>  ACTS 7:49-50<br>  " 'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool.<br>  What kind of house will you build for me? says the Lord.<br>  Or where will my resting place be?<br>  Has not my hand made all these things?'<br>  <br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26.

Swings and cycles.  I do agree that many cultures right now are trending less religious.

The tug from atheism is probably the least pressure people experience.
iuyYfQHmaa	You are assuming that all "religious" people believe in things that cannot be provable. Ever hear of Religious Science? Check it out. It approaches spirituality in a provable manner, through the scientific method. And yes, there are things that'll never be provable, one way or another, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.<br>  The physical sciences are meant to be used in the physical world.<br>  The spiritual sciences are meant to be used in the spiritual world.<br>  One is not necessarily meant, or is capable of being used in the others sphere of influence.<br>  Peace, and Namaste!|`|KXQVRQdjaa	I'm sorry: Did I miss the part where Religion is defined as Conservative Christianity?<br>  <br>  There are plenty of religions then encourage scientific study, thinking, learning, questioning, etc.  There are even Christians who like to think and don't dismiss science.  Not all theists will blindly dismiss all evidence contrary to our beliefs.  Theists are capable of understanding that we can be wrong!  So far, my theology seems to mesh well with science.  If new evidence comes along that puts holes in my ideas, I'll examine all the facts and, if it seems my ideas are irrational, I'll think about it and adjust my beliefs.  I'm a skeptic about everything, and I'll never believe anything just because someone tells me it's true.<br>  <br>  I think you're imagining that all religious people are like the morons that push for intelligent design.  That's a very small portion of theists, and we shouldn't all be judged by their stupid-headedness.   Many of us hate them as much as Atheists do!|`|yHD5wVopaa	Science tells us what is, not what ought to be.

Darwin's theory of evolution how can he made such a theory without the monkey who was also created by God.

It doesn't even qualify as a scientific theory much less qualifying as core principles of science . Science advances by new information replacing old, that being said, this is why I don't see evolution as science, but more of a religion that's protected with religious fervor , no new theories or evidence is allowed to be introduced that would in any way shape or form suggest evolution an invalid theory . So no, Religious people have not chosen to reject science, but evolution, which is not science. As a matter of fact, some of the greatest contributors of science the world has ever known were very devout Christians, why would they be against or attempt to tear down something they themselves contributed so greatly to ? here is a list of just but a handful of Christian who have contributed greatly to science below.

The universe has *rules* (which physics is slowly unraveling) which constrain the options that can occur.<br>  <br>  > "the only alternative to a random universe is that there is some higher power controlling stuff, but this is not the simplest explanation and it carries with it assumptions, implications and complications that create more questions than they answer."<br>  <br>  There may be other alternative possibilities, of course. The multiverse hypothesis suggests that there are an infinite number of universes, and among those universes, everything that could possibly occur does occur somewhere.<br>  <br>  But you are correct that positing the existence of a controlling higher power does cause problems for science. BUT, and this is a very important point, if such an entity is omnipotent (as most models for God describe Him to be), the He could meddle with the universe, and do so in a way that was impossibel for us to recognise: essentially, God may well be puppeting everything in a manner imperceptible to us (because science cannot examine, or even recognise anything that can break the laws of physics at will).<br>  <br>  So, while actually being a scientist, a scientist *must* ignore the possibility of God's existence and interference. But for the rest of his/her life, the scientist can believe as he or she wishes.|`|VeLdDMbgaa	Not really, no. You can believe in laws governing the universe that are nothing like a 'god' or any conscious being.<br>  <br>  Look up the view called 'determinism'. This spells out how you can believe that NOTHING is random, at yet it does not require religion. (Though quantum mechanics strongly challenges this view, but does not make it impossible).<br>  <br>  I think you need to clarify what you mean by 'random'. Truly 100% random, or just complex and chaotic? Many scientists believe that the universe is just a chain of complex, chaotic reactions.|`|GeoiGjbCaa	"Even though there’s no evidence to prove that the (universe is an ongoing chain of random events)"<br>  <br>  You don't get out very much, do you? The above is as absurd as saying there's no evidence that we breathe air.|`|4AxBMYpUaa	yah-what?<br>  completely random events? My typing this answer is not THAT random is it?|`|AA11969509	Evolution usually refers to the development of life on earth, and does not apply to most of the rest of the universe.  Some people will refer to evolution of stars, etc, but this is not normally what is meant by the word evolution.<br>  Evolution of life is not random.  It is caused by natural selection which is not random.|`|TOm0lawCaa	NO.<br>  Evolution has nothing to do with cosmology.<br>  Evolution does not explain or attempt to explain the origin or nature of the universe as a whole.<br>  Evolution doesn't even regard the origin of life.<br>  <br>  And most importlantly<br>  <br>  The universe is not random. It is governed by laws of nature.|`|LqyOHY37aa	No. Natural selection is not random. Evolution doesn't answer to how life started. Didn't you have any biology classes in high school?|`|jOZWekKjaa	Evolution has nothing to do with the origin of life and the universe. -.-|`|JseyoIfLaa	There is nothing random about evolution.|`|IWtHxOrSaa	my sentiments exactly it is after all the only explanation that fits and has the added prerequisite of simplicity|`|T9kMy13Haa	yeah I guess that's kind of right.|`|AA10181489	Yes and no, although you are also confusing a broad topic in science with evolution.<br>  <br>  Consider a very simple world with only one variable and no constraints, that is there are no rules other than the one we are about to use.<br>  <br>  Consider the series X(t+1)=B*X(t)+e(t+1) where the numbers in parenthesis are subscripts or alternatively view X as a function that is determined by time alone.<br>  <br>  If this is true for all values of t, then X(t)=B*X(t-1)+e(t), where e is an error term and X is measured.  This means that X(t+1)=B*B*X(t-1)+B*e(t)+e(t+1).  By iteration this means that any current value of X is equal to the sum of a polynomial of error terms alone, although there could be a starting value, it is unimportant for reasons that are too mathematically difficult to explain in a Yahoo post.  So such a model would mean that the future is predictable, subject to the shape parameters of the statistical distribution of e.  However it also means that only the errors matter, the random events.  Any initial parts really do not matter because they are basically constants.<br>  <br>  This isn't an assumption, it is simple math.  Now, lets change our model a bit.  Instead of just one variable we have many variables and they are connected by physical laws that can be modeled as equations.  In such a system the curves that are possible are driven by the laws in place.  As such, there are only deterministic processes.  Since these processes cannot be predicted they act just like the random sequence above.<br>  <br>  The nice thing about randomness is that as long as the B above is less than one then the system becomes orderly quickly and is predictable to a degree.  You can predict the weather tomorrow but not next month.|`|1Te4sfqIaa	Actually you have a fundamentally flawed view of evolution if you believe that.  Evolution is the theory that explains the PATTERNS that we see in the development of natural life.  These patterns indicated that life is not developed randomly so scientists came up with Evolution to describe how they believe the process works.  In fact the universe is decidedly not random and i'm sure any scientist will happily tell you that.  It follows the laws of physics.  If it were a random universe than that would mean that the fundamental laws of physics that allow us to exist would be in a state of constant random change.  But since we continue to exist we show that there are indeed very unrandom rules that the universe follows.  Science simply attempts to explain them.|`|jBIotay5aa	I don't believe this life is random. It has its purpose, whether or not it is beyond our imaginations. We might be part of something that our imagination can not even comprehend. Do not assume that the answer can be found in a book or by some other person's heresy. I think you have to formulate your own thinking.|`|2rcSILkWaa	No, it has nothing to do with the universe.<br>  <br>  There is nothing random about the universe.  There are things known as "forces, " and "reactions" that take place to effect matter within it.|`|zrmaX7YCaa	Caveat:  Randomness does not preclude probability.  Radioactive decay is random but also subject to probability.|`|RDoFAwv1aa	Cosign above.|`|fWWSWkIaaa	In a random system all possible outcomes have the exact same probability.  With the definition of randomness out of the way the answer to your question becomes no.  Evolution is an ongoing process with random elements but it's the deterministic elements, such as inheritence, chemistry, and natural selection that play the most important roles in the theory.<br>  <br>  Also there is actually a lot of evidence to support the theory of evolution, in paleontology, biology, genetics, pilogenetics, mathematics and logic.<br>  <br>  I should also point out that every discovery in science actually indicates that the universe is not essentially an ongoing chain of completely random events.  Instead it indicates that the universe is essentially an ongoing chain of events some of which are random, other with various outcomes of differing probabilities, and many others which are completely determined by how the components interact with each other.<br>  <br>  The fact that new discoveries in science often create more questions than they answer is not even close to an argument against the discoveries or the theories they are part of are incorrect.  In fact it's what is expected of any useful scientific theory.  As we discover from the theory answers to questions the answers often lead us to think about other aspects in a new way that leads us to ask new questions.  This is a natural result of the fact that we don't know everything, and we don't even know all of what we don't know.  A new answer makes apparent the existence of another bit of information that before then we weren't aware we were missing.<br>  <br>  So is a proper scientist is going to believe anything at all about the origin of the universe and the universe as it is now, an ongoing chain of events, some random but most not random at all, is the best belief for that scientist based on all available information.

It was a theory first postulated a physicist named Father Georges Lema?tre in the 1930's.  Subsequent discoveries have supported his theory, including the detection of residual energy left over from the BB.  As to what happened before that, I don't know.  However theists insist that something could not have come from nothing, therefor God must have created the big bang.  What I hear when I ask the logical follow up question, where did God come from, is rationalization.  God was always there.  Something can't come from nothing but that rule doesn't apply to God.

First came the Plank epoch to 10^-42 seconds, where all the laws and dimensions (there are 4 dimensions that humans can detect) were discombobulated. Then came the grand unification epoch to 10^-36 seconds, where the universe had only 1 controlling law. After that was the electro-weak epoch where there were three governing laws, and then after that, the four known laws were separated into what we know them as today, but it wasn't until the quark epoch that they even were able to interact with anything after 10^-6 seconds|`|pfNnuD5saa	No, the laws that govern our universe would have been born with it. If there are multi universes it would be possible that each would have it's own laws. <br>  Of course there is no way to observe any universe other than our own.  Our universe is self-contained, and no other universe can affect anything in our universe, so we cannot gather evidence about its existence. <br>  To say that there is no order in the laws of physics is just wrong.

So yes your kinda right, the laws that govern the universe did come into existence the instant the physical universe did, but because they did, doesn't mean God didn't kick start it all , as a matter of fact, the fact that there wasn't a physical universe or laws, makes it even more plausible that a infinite God not restricted by time matter and space was the one to kick start it all .

No one really knows what happened at the instant of the "Big Bang." (BB)  but we have gone back to to 10-42 second and have found that the laws of phsyics changed  few times in those first critical moments.  <br>  The Holy Grail of science is to go all the way back to the instant of the BB in hopes of finding where we came from and where we are going.  We have a pretty good idea, but in science pretty good is not good enough.  One thing they do know...there was NO GOD that created it.
AlybkawCaa	After Jesus was crucified, but before He ascended, He appeared to many believers and reinforced his instructions on his great commision to teach his Gospel of salvation to all of the world. Here is a small part of one of his appearances. This time in the courtyard of Nicodemus.<br>  <br>  "On this evening the Jerusalem believers had made their first attempt to get together since the resurrection. Assembled here at this time were the eleven apostles, the women's corps and their associates, and about fifty other leading disciples of the Master, including a number of the Greeks. This company of believers had been visiting informally for more than half an hour when, suddenly, the risen Master appeared in full view and immediately began to instruct them. Said Jesus:"<br>  <br>  "Peace be upon you. This is the most representative group of believers--apostles and disciples, both men and women--to which I have appeared since the time of my deliverance from the flesh. I now call you to witness that I told you beforehand that my sojourn among you must come to an end; I told you that presently I must return to the Father. And then I plainly told you how the chief priests and the rulers of the Jews would deliver me up to be put to death, and that I would rise from the grave. Why, then, did you allow yourselves to become so disconcerted by all this when it came to pass? and why were you so surprised when I rose from the tomb on the third day? You failed to believe me because you heard my words without comprehending the meaning thereof.<br>  <br>  "And now you should give ear to my words lest you again make the mistake of hearing my teaching with the mind while in your hearts you fail to comprehend the meaning. From the beginning of my sojourn as one of you, I taught you that my one purpose was to reveal my Father in heaven to his children on earth. I have lived the God-revealing bestowal that you might experience the God-knowing career. I have revealed God as your Father in heaven; I have revealed you as the sons of God on earth. It is a fact that God loves you, his sons. By faith in my word this fact becomes an eternal and living truth in your hearts. When, by living faith, you become divinely God-conscious, you are then born of the spirit as children of light and life, even the eternal life wherewith you shall ascend the universe of universes and attain the experience of finding God the Father on Paradise.<br>  <br>  "I admonish you ever to remember that your mission among men is to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom--the reality of the fatherhood of God and the truth of the sonship of man. Proclaim the whole truth of the good news, not just a part of the saving gospel. Your message is not changed by my resurrection experience. Sonship with God, by faith, is still the saving truth of the gospel of the kingdom. You are to go forth preaching the love of God and the service of man. That which the world needs most to know is: Men are the sons of God, and through faith they can actually realize, and daily experience, this ennobling truth. My bestowal should help all men to know that they are the children of God, but such knowledge will not suffice if they fail personally to faith-grasp the saving truth that they are the living spirit sons of the eternal Father. The gospel of the kingdom is concerned with the love of the Father and the service of his children on earth.<br>  <br>  "Among yourselves, here, you share the knowledge that I have risen from the dead, but that is not strange. I have the power to lay down my life and to take it up again; the Father gives such power to his Paradise Sons. You should the rather be stirred in your hearts by the knowledge that the dead of an age entered upon the eternal ascent soon after I left Joseph's new tomb. I lived my life in the flesh to show how you can, through loving service, become God-revealing to your fellow men even as, by loving you and serving you, I have become God-revealing to you. I have lived among you as the Son of Man that you, and all other men, might know that you are all indeed the sons of God. Therefore, go you now into all the world preaching this gospel of the kingdom of heaven to all men. Love all men as I have loved you; serve your fellow mortals as I have served you. Freely you have received, freely give. Only tarry here in Jerusalem while I go to the Father, and until I send you the Spirit of Truth. He shall lead you into the enlarged truth, and I will go with you into all the world. I am with you always, and my peace I leave with you."  (No copyright, freely share)<br>  <br>  This gospel of our sonship in God's Light and love later became polluted by Paul and others; adding old false religious doctrines of blood sacrifice, God's wrath, priesthoods, hell-fire and damnation, etc.  But Jesus' Spirit of Truth is winning !|`|1fb7aea767ff3f9acc21f4f310b2ee94aa	Nope.  the Gospel is that the Messiah has come. Through Him, one can be saved from the coming destruction.<br>  One must only accept the gift of redemption which has been fully paid by Jesus' sacrifice. <br>  He told us (humans, that is) that He would be killed and would rise again, which He has done.  Face it, Jesus is the Christ.  To be safe, one must only accept the freely given gift and to tell others about it.|`|iXI7n6Gmaa	Yes, Christianity evolved few decades after Jesus (pbuh) was raised.|`|BAaf9NKdaa	Jesus had explained to the apostles in various ways that he was to<br>   be put to death but would rise. They knew this but their zealous<br>   love for him caused one to react by means of the sword on the night<br>   of his betrayal and arrest. Jesus was closer to several of his apostles<br>   and loved them all but this did not calm their fears of the events taking<br>   place that night as Peter who loved Jesus but acted on impulse did<br>   as Jesus foretold he would do and that was to deny him by claiming<br>   not to be associated with him or even knowing him. Their understanding was not full until they were anointed by means of God's<br>   Holy Spirit which revealed to them things as it had revealed to Jesus.<br>    In sending the apostles out door to door he was sending them to the <br>   Jews who should have been expecting the Messiah but by means of<br>   the Sanhedrin and the Mosiac priesthood were instrumental in having<br>   Jesus put to death. Jesus had taught his apostles that love of the <br>   Father and the Son would manifest their love for the things that the<br>   Creator desired and that was the love of his creation just like Jesus<br>   himself came to love. If fact Jesus was calling a new priesthood to <br>   him by this means to replace the Mosiac priesthood that would be<br>   fulfilled by his living to the letter the law that God had given Moses.<br>   God knew that no man in the Adamic sinful state could live the law <br>   perfectly. That is why his only begotten son was more than willing<br>   to leave his place in heaven and have his life transformed and transferred into the womb of one who worshipped the Father  and who he found favor with. Jesus was raised accordingly and baptised then<br>   he went into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan as Eve was<br>   decieved and tempted in their meeting. These men or anointed were<br>   fulfilled in number not by the blood Jews but by those men who were <br>   of all nations over a period of time circumsized in their hearts into<br>   the heavenly government of God headed by Jesus Christ as the<br>   King and Highpriest. They too, become kings and priest and are <br>   given the duty or throne of judging mankind and the "ANGELS". They<br>   are part of the covenant Jesus ask the Father and his God to accept<br>   as being the same covenant the Father made with him for a Kingdom<br>   or Government. That's why we pray the LORD'S PRAYER; Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Jesus <br>   returned to heaven to prepare for those of the bride class which the <br>   new priesthood is referred to as, a place for them. God told him to sit<br>   at his right hand; the Bible tells us that 7 times would pass over themselves before God gave to the one he chose the Kingdom. This <br>   was to be Jesus. Once that time came, Jesus who has a more perfect<br>   and beautiful "angelical" name as the highest spirit creature in the <br>   heavens next to Jehovah himself, Michael the Arch Angel cleansed his<br>   adversary, " Satan the devil, the dragon like serpent"  and his demon<br>   spirit folowers "angels" from the heavens and down to the earth where<br>   he walks about like a devouring lion causing ruin to all. Once the <br>   heavens had been cleansed then those of the bride class could start be ressurrected. Today their are few members of the bride class left on earth but as each one fulfills their earthly ministry and dies they are<br>   instantly given a spiritual body and meet their brothers in their heavenly home taking their given position. They will help with the earthly ressurrection that will bring Jesus reign in cleansing and re-<br>   storing the earth back to it's former glory as a paradise, this time<br>   world-wide; not just an area called a garden. Those who live during<br>   this period will get to chose for themselves as Adam did whether they<br>   will continue to seek God to guide and provide for them as his servants and children or die the second death that those of the bride<br>   class will sit in judgement of. After that new scrolls will be open and <br>   as a people and as indiviuals will be made perfect in body and mind<br>   serving and rejoicing in the house "earth" of our God, Creator and <br>   Father. Even Jesus and those of his priesthood become insubjection <br>   to Jehovah and we can have a true one on one relationship with God.<br>   Jesus as of now is our mediator to a perfect God by imperfect children. IT is through his name of sacrifice and duty as high priest that<br>   we now approach the Father in prayer and supplication. <br>       Remember that many of the apostles had died by the time God <br>   gave Jesus the information about his future role over mankind on <br>   earth by means of the book of Revelation. There was no way they<br>   could teach the gospel in whole. They were teaching as the Holy<br>   Spirit revealed as God allowed the scriptures in whole. Primarily that<br>   Jesus was indeed the one whom Jehovah sent forth to represent him<br>   on earth from heaven.|`|xelkbdbdaa	They must have read the Jewish Scriptures!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|nHizaTiDaa	When Jesus was crucified- everyone thought "this is it- all is lost"  Jesus, our wonderful rabbi is gone... he wasn't the Messiah!  <br>  <br>  Then, when he came back from the grave- even then, they did not fully understand!<br>  <br>  In Acts 1, they asked Jesus "are you now going to restore the kingdom to Israel?"

AA11232725	That's one possibility. Another is that the person really doesn't have to lie, they just lie because they are too lazy to do a good job of researching how to defend their faith.

In addition to the many birds which visit, a wide variety of botanical species contribute to the natural offerings. The site is historically significant due to the presence of prehistoric Indian shell middens, mounds composed of discarded oyster shells. The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 14, 1973. It is administered by the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.|`|fusc1cykaa	You mean Indian mounds?

This ensured a Democratic victory and therefore *they* would take the blame for not being able to repair the past 8  years of "grab your ankles and say 'thank you'" that were just inflicted upon us quickly enough for most US citizens.

65QqZBnjaa	In general about the same.  The vast majority of intersex people have firm gender identities.  That is they strongly identitify as male or female.<br>  <br>  Just wanted to say it was good to see an intelligent question for a change when it comes to intersex people.|`|yzgS5KiQaa	I'm not sure what you mean because I don't know how you define intersex. I believe transexuality is an intersex condition, because my brain is physically, and functionally male, while my body is female. I have parts of me that are female and parts of me that are male, so I consider myself to be intersex, I don't think I need a penis and a vagina to have both male and female parts, and I think the reason only people with ambiguous genitalia are called inersex is because of two things, one being that people don't believe things they can't physically see with the naked eye, and second being that gender in this culture is determined by genitalia, if you have a penis you're a man, if you have a vagina you're a woman, only if you have "both" will they say "okay, maybe you are both male and female". Never mind about the brain, you can't see that. Professor Milton Diamond also said he believes transsexuality is an intersex birth defect. <br>  I'm not sure if transgender people, or genderqueer people are also intersexed to some degree, but I suspect maybe their brain was ambiguously formed? Like how an intersex person can have ambiguous genitalia, then couldn't a person have an ambiguous gender? As for crossdressing, I think it's not as serious as people make it out to be, I crossdress, wear feminine outrageous drag costumes. I just do it for fun, and I don't feel that it reflects my gender or my sex, it's just roleplaying. I could be wrong.<br>  <br>  Edit: If you are asking if intersex people with ambiguous genitalia are more likely to have an intersexed (genderqueer) brain as well, I honestly don't know. In a question Radgirl answered, I believe she said that people with ambiguous genitalia usually have very clear gender identities. Perhaps having an intersex body, And an intersex brain would be something like winning the genetic lotto twice.

They flatly refused and mocked at him, and severely injured him by inciting their children to throw stones at him. Gabriel (as) visited the Prophet here suggesting that the angels were ready to destroy the town if he were to ask Allah for the punishment. Nevertheless, the Prophet declined and prayed for future generations of Taif to accept Islam.

Good lord...|`|4GiIXWUXaa	There is no book in existence that "proves" the existence of God.<br>  <br>  IF the Bible is the only 'proof' that God exists, then he never really existed in the first place.<br>  <br>  God exists because He does. If there were never a Bible, he would still exist. The Bible is for our benefit, not God's. He already knows who he is and what he can do; but man is foolish. We want everything in writing so that we have something to refer to, hence the Bible is (you could say) "God's way" of putting into writing: I EXIST.<br>  <br>  But There are plenty of books about plenty of things. All those books prove, honestly is that mankind has mastered the art of written language, and that people like to read. Some perfer fantasy based reading while others prefer more logically based reading. <br>  <br>  The reason for quoting scripture is (or is supposed to be) to demonstrate WHERE those ideas or notions expressed by the individual about theological issues stems from.<br>  For instance, IF i am arguing about the Doctrine of The Atonment with someone who misunderstands The Bible (or certain verses), i am going to cite those verses for emphasis and correction. <br>  I am going to show the person that i am arguing with where i am getting my ideas from. Understand?<br>  <br>  If you said to me, Hey Christian, where in the Bible does it say such and such about sin. I would repsond by citing verses, since i am basing my rebuttal argument on those verses while addressing the question and demand for proof.<br>  <br>  In any case, i think that those of whom rely solely on the Bible as their only evidence for the existence of God must not have a very strong faith to start with if they cannot explore other ideas and theologies outside those 66 books. (80 if they're Catholic). <br>  <br>  But as mentioned above, and to answer again: I do not think that ANY book proves the existence of God. <br>  And, I am a Christian and well versed with Scripture.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. xoxo ?<br>  <br>  EDIT: *slams head against wall*  Jered: faith does not mean belief without proof.  If i have "faith" that the sky is purple does that mean that my feelings have compensated for the lack of evidence? Certainly not.  Having faith is putting trust into something: a notion, and idea, a theory etc.  Faith can be validated or dismissed based on proof and evidence. Just because someone believes something doesn't make it the truth. Therefore you really cannot logically equate faith with truth. Faith is only a belief in something ... sort've like a hypothetical guess.|`|TzY9vkinaa	It doesn't. But the Holy Ghost does, and the Holy Ghost is what tells us the Bible is true.

After all, atheists do not believe in God because they haven't experienced Him.  Theists do, because they have.  We don't know which of us are right (and therefore not delusional), nor will we until we die (and no, this is not a reference to Pascal's wager).<br>  <br>  What I personally believe is that the reason people in other religions have experienced God is because He is not limited by our own narrow-minded perspective.  God will walk any path to reach us.  He's not bound by religion.  God isn't a Christian, LOL.<br>  <br>  As a side-note, have you ever tried casting any of the spells in Harry Potter?

Of course not. We will never love them. Absolutely not. The Jews are infidels – not because I say so, and not because they are killing Muslims, but because Allah said: “The Jews say that Uzair is the son of Allah, and the Christians say that Christ is the son of Allah. These are the words from their mouths. They imitate the sayings of the disbelievers before. May Allah fight them. How deluded they are.” It is Allah who said that they are infidels.<br>  <br>  That's Qur'an 9:30.<br>  <br>  Your belief regarding the Jews should be, first, that they are infidels, and second, that they are enemies. They are enemies not because they occupied Palestine. They would have been enemies even if they did not occupy a thing. Allah said: “You shall find the strongest men in enmity to the disbelievers [sic] to be the Jews and the polytheists.”<br>  <br>  Qur'an 5:82.<br>  <br>  Third, you must believe that the Jews will never stop fighting and killing us. They [fight] not for the sake of land and security, as they claim, but for the sake of their religion: “And they will not cease fighting you until they turn you back you’re your religion, if they can.”<br>  <br>  Qur'an 2:217.<br>  <br>  This is it. We must believe that our fighting with the Jews is eternal, and it will not end until the final battle – and this is the fourth point. You must believe that we will fight, defeat, and annihilate them, until not a single Jew remains on the face of the Earth.<br>  <br>  It is not me who says so. The Prophet said: “Judgment Day will not come until you fight the Jews and kill them. The Jews will hide behind stones and trees, and the stones and tree will call: Oh Muslim, oh servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him – except for the Gharqad tree, which is the tree of the Jews.” I have heard that they are planting many of these trees now. [...]<br>  <br>  That Hadith can be found at Sahih Muslim 6985.<br>  <br>  As for you Jews – the curse of Allah upon you. The curse of Allah upon you, whose ancestors were apes and pigs.<br>  <br>  That's Qur'an 2:62-65; 5:59-60; and 7:166.<br>  <br>  You Jews have sown hatred in our hearts, and we have bequeathed it to our children and grandchildren. You will not survive as long as a single one of us remains.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  Oh Jews, may the curse of Allah be upon you. Oh Jews... Oh Allah, bring Your wrath, punishment, and torment down upon them. Allah, we pray that you transform them again, and make the Muslims rejoice again in seeing them as apes and pigs. You pigs of the earth! You pigs of the earth!

The reason that they are recorded in the Old Testament is that they were highly unusual events. The Old Testament didn't take place over a couple of months or years, it covers about 3,000 years of history, so your flippancy with regards to the events of Exodus is rather misplaced.  When God moves it's big news, no matter what the era. Don't be under the impression that God smiting Sodom and Gomorrah was filed under "in other news" right behind the football scores and next to the classified ads.<br>  <br>  Secondly, God does still move today. I saw a lady get healed at Church just a few hours ago. Not one of those "White suit" fall down stunt healings either.  She couldn't walk on the way up the prayer minister, fell down right in front of me... started walking away from the minister still using her cane, and then she didn't need it any more. Didn't draw attention to herself, didn't shout out, just got healed. Praise God.... now that's not as spectacular as seeing the Death Star explode I grant you...but it's a pretty big deal to her and it has the advantage that it IS real.<br>  <br>  Thirdly... and this is where you are right... people think they are too smart to believe in God because that is what the schools teach them to think. Education teaches you to be "clever".  It encourages people to be clever. Most of life isn't very clever.  Take finance for example. You save money, and you don't spend what you don't have, and over time you get rich. That's not clever, but it works. "Interest only, balloon payment, teaser-rate adjustable home equity mortages" ARE clever...and you can see how well THAT has worked out. <br>  <br>  Same is true for God.  You had to rely 100% on faith in those days too. It took  a lot of faith for Moses to go all Charlton Heston and do what God said at the  parting of  the Red Sea. <br>  <br>  If people won't believe in God, if people don't believe in God, if people reject God because they are too smart to believe in God...well that puts a barrier between them and God's power. That doesn't mean that God's power isn't there any more, it just means that we are blocking it from coming into our lives.|`|AA12288361	GOD's greatest miracles are performed in the hearts of men today! <br>  <br>  GOD bless

There are some religious leaders who make unnecessary fatwas, but that does not mean that Islaam has to be blamed for that. <br>  <br>  ?

2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	Well you are absolutely right. <br>  <br>  Being a Christian is hard. Not everybody is up to it. Everybody screws up at least some of the time... as the saying goes "Pobody's Nerfect".<br>  <br>  And yeah, there are Christians who are hypocrites. There are hypocrites all over. Look at how much trouble Obama is having finding  Democrats who have NOT cheated on his or her taxes to serve in his government. Look at all the Republican "Chicken Hawks" who were all for invading Iraq, but had somehow managed to avoid ever signing up to serve in Vietnam. I'm still trying to figure out how an atheist can both be certain God does not exist, and also be mad the God they say they don't believe in for all sorts of things. <br>  <br>  The people you talk about get angry because you tagged them as hypocrites, and are embarrassed.  They want to claim the mantel of Christian, but without all the hard part. Sort of like the guys who spend years at the VFW telling everyone about how they were at D-Day and how they stormed Omaha Beach, and it turns out they spent the whole war peeling potatoes in Nebraska, if they ever joined up at all.<br>  <br>  At least they understand that they want to be a Christian, even if they aren't up for the hard part yet. That's better than nothing. Just pray for them.|`|AA11521494	I don't get it either.  Christianity IS however impossible to practice fully (one reason I left it), and certainly in the USA I get the impression that for most people it is something to pay lip-service to and not to live out.  It looks like a way of justifying their own irrational prejudices while ignoring the bits they don't like.  It may be less widespread in Europe, but churchgoers here are far more likely to be sincere believers.|`|3ccd31e0b38f18f3123974ce88fcb948aa	So who are you to judge if they do or do not "practice The Bible"?<br>  <br>  I don't know why they do it.

And most of the time I am doing just fine - I can show patience, love, kindness, joy, self-control and all the fruits of the Spirit. <br>  But there are times in which the flesh comes out - you won't even realize it, but suddenly you start answering back to whoever is offending you and in an heartbeat your old self comes out. Then it's too late.<br>  Not only you are sorry because the Holy Spirit is grieving in you, but you feel mortified because the world saw you reacting and it was surely not Christ-like. And His mercy is bigger than man's...

0b1bc0d20db45e766b5bd783ee1b2812aa	Excellent point!<br>  <br>  I don't think it is far-fetched to assume God would probably set up similar extraterrestrial conditions (e.g., soul, sin, heaven, Jesus, etc.).<br>  They seem to have worked so well here.......................!<br>  <br>  Anyway, following up on Titou's point, Jesus could certainly look like a reptile,  bacteria,  plant, or anything that we have seen on Star Trek.<br>  <br>  Several scientist believe that we are way too homo-centric. Life doesn't necessarily have to be carbon-based or even look alive.  The difference between living and non-living things is greatly exaggerated- simply involving a few extra chemical reactions.<br>  <br>  Consequently, on other worlds, Jesus may simply be a rather complicated replicating chemical reaction or a collection of ions. If so, the next obvious question would concern what "cross he would bear", thus dying for his chemical brethren.<br>  <br>  For an ion , a wooden cross would have little effect, but perhaps if he was held magnetically in an innert gas.....<br>  <br>  Someday, we make contact with other life forms and if there places of worship are aglow with neon, well.... we might then know that ion Jesus was there!|`|jSPj3S6faa	When I was a delusional theist, I had to consider this question also.

Logically a belief in God means that God created the dimension of heaven and the dimension of earth. Those in the dimension of earth can't see the dimension of heaven, but God in the dimension of heaven can obviously see the dimension of earth. And the Bible tells us that God created angels, so God and his angels reside in the dimension of heaven. Obvioulsy God and his angels in the dimension of heaven have more power than those in the dimension of earth, and can see the dimension of earth from the dimension of heaven. So it must be logical that God and his angels in the dimension of heaven would desire to communicate with human beings in the dimension of earth. That must be logical, for if that is not so why would God have created the dimensions of heaven and earth, with God and his angels having more power in the dimension of heaven, the power to see the dimensioin of earth and the power to communicate with human beings in the dimension of earth. God and his angels then, having this power, the power to see the dimension of earth and the power to communicate with human beings in the dimension of earth, must desire to use this power of communication, must desire to communicate with human beings in the dimension of earth. And so we have a history of divine communication and divine intervention. <br>  <br>  Examples of divine communication\divine intervention. <br>  - An angel appears to Mary and tells her she is going to conceive the immacualte conception. <br>  <br>  - An angel appears to Joseph in a dream and tells him to take the baby Jesus out of Israel. The point in this is, where did Jospeh get the idea to leave Isreal unless from God. <br>  <br>  - Christ says to George Fox "There is one who can speak to thy condition, namely Jesus Christ." The point in this is, George Fox couldn't have founded the Quakers unless he got this inspiration from Jesus Christ. Therefore, there is a methodology in the inspiration of George Fox by Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  - Christ hypnotises Mother Ann Lee. If hypnotism can be described as control of the mind, then it must be so that Jesus Christ hypnotised Mother Ann Lee. Again, there's methodology in the inspiration because Ann Lee wouldn't have founded the Shakers without this inspiration from Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  - the concept of entering the mind. The Bible says "Satan entered Judas." <br>  <br>  - The appearances of divine beings such as the Virgin Mary at Lourdes, Fatima etc. <br>  <br>  - The history of music. <br>  <br>  And so if dvine communication is possible, if divine intervention is possible, then other things could also be possible such as hypnotism, possession, control of physiology, feelings. <br>  <br>  These powers of God then are logically deducible simply from a belief in the existence of God. The actual existence of God shows that these powers are real. <br>  <br>  God who created heaven and earth, the universe, and who created human beings, therefore has an interest in human history. I think you will agree that God, having these powers, must be of the view that history would be boring if God didn't reveal, show, demonstrate these powers to human beings and in fact give these powers to human beings. <br>  <br>  To show that this must be logically so. We have the idea the Jesus Christ will come again. Supposedly then as we have this idea, we imagine that Jesus Christ comes again and the world is transhormed so to speak. Is that the end of history then? But God in consideration of this idea of Jesis Christ coming again must reflect on previous history if the coming again to earth of God signifies the end of history. For God must reflect then that history would have been boring if God didn't show God's power, didn't give God's power to human beings during the course of history. So Jesus Christ comes again and thinks for example "I never showed you time-travel for instance during the course of history." Then history would surely have been boring. Therefore, it must be logically so that God gives God's powers to human beings, to his political allies during the course of history, and this is the truth because this is what God has already done. And to do this, God must live in the world as a human being to form a relationship of trust with those to whom he has given God's power. And God has told me that history will continue indefinitely.<br>  <br>  *******************<br>  Do you accept the god of the emperor -- they screamed?   Will you pray to Jesus -- and profess allegiance to the religion of the emperor?   But this question was only a mere formality -- for the soldiers knew before they even entered the community that we were Ebionites -- a people who it is said were too Christian to be Jews, and too Jewish to be Christian, and very much the direct followers of Yeshua (Jesus), the great Teacher and Prophet who had come to reveal to mankind the Spiritual Meaning of the Law through the teachings of The Way.   For three hundred years following the crucifixion we had preserved the Sacred Teachings of The Way of Life -- and Yeshua himself remained with us even to that very day.   The great Teacher and Prophet often visited with us -- teaching and healing in accordance with the promise of the scriptures.   But alas, great change was on the horizon -- and I realized that the time had come where another biblical prediction would come to pass -- one that to our own detriment is ignored by a great many believers today.   And what was that prediction?   The time had come in accordance with the vision of the the man known as the Apostle Paul when he foretold that in the very near future the True Church of Christ would cease to exist -- as the forces of darkness and the god of this world began to rule the church and reign over the hearts and minds of the people who called themselves Christian.<br>  <br>  On that fateful day as I watched in horror at what was taking place in the name of the god Jesus and the religion of the emperor, I saw the soldiers begin to usher the people into our assembly house.   Bare breasted young women whose tattered clothes had been torn from their naked bodies by these savage intruders who had violated their innocence, cried as they were dragged along by beastly and unruly animals who masqueraded as human beings.   Bloodied and broken men carried their brethren, while the beasts of the Christian emperor jeered them in their struggle.   As the soldiers laughed, they barraged the door with furniture and dry wood, threw oil lamps on both the wood that blocked the doors and the thatched roof, and set the building on fire.   And as the smoke swirled and the flames engulfed the wooden parts of the structure, the people inside prayed -- prayed for the Light -- and prayed for the forgiveness of those who persecuted them.  And in a vision, the whole of the congregation saw Yeshua (Jesus), the prince of peace appear in the mists of the people.   And as he opened his mouth to speak, we heard him say: “Be strong, little children, for on this day you will be with me in the Paradise of our Eternal Father”.  And as they looked to him, his feet raised two feet off the floor, we saw him totally surrounded by the Light, and each of us could feel the radiation of his Love.  In unison we then prayed in the words of our Master and Teacher: “Father forgive them, fore they know not what they do!”<br>  <br>  Outside the soldiers celebrated as the smoke-filled building became enveloped in the fire.   They had enjoyed the spoils of another successful mission -- and they reasoned that both their emperor and their god Jesus will rejoice over the destruction of the heretics.   Thus, if one could take a step back and observe the two worlds that clashed on that fateful day so long ago, one would immediately be struck by the reality of the dual powers that had been brought together.   Inside the burning assembly hall with the tormented victims of the god of this world was the Master Yeshua -- the Prince of Peace who had lived as the Son of the Eternal God.   On the outside were the soldiers who called themselves Christian -- a people who the Apostle Paul wrote would worship the Prince of Darkness as he sat upon the throne of the church -- and while from an historical perspective these savage and ruthless barbarians called themselves Christian, we must ask if these heathen and bloodthirsty barbaric men were truly the faithful flock of the Church of the New Covenant that was created to be a Light to this world?<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|ec55348158c3fd8764f5daba79c0af3daa	First, we don't know for certain what this planet's Jesus looked like.  He is depicted several ways.  He was probably somewhat dark-skinned, stocky, brown-eyed, with the scars that come with being a carpenter.<br>  <br>  Second, Jesus came because of sin.  Do other planets have sin?  If they don't then God would not need to rescue them.<br>  <br>  If other planets have sin, and if God has control over them, he would find a way to save them.  Since we at this time know of no specific inhabited planet, I would say the question is academic at best.|`|YFhhlp7taa	If that's the case there is probably a Jesus of bacteria, saving them from eternal damnation (white blood cells?).|`|F5lCFvqeaa	Jesuses or Jesii?|`|uRV8SqThaa	I guess it depends on if people on other planets have sinned.  :)|`|AA10387455	The same Jesus visited all the inhabited planet one by one.

They may not have a complete explanation for the workings of the universe either, but if they were intelligent, they would dig a little deeper than "goddidit."|`|AA11562077	Well, considering that life as we know it on Earth depended on an encounter with an asteroid or comet at exactly the right moment, other Jesuses will probably be descendants of dinosaurs rather than warm-blooded mammals.<br>  <br>  Then again, in an infinite Universe, such an occurrence could have taken place any number of times, particularly if God is sort of an ace quarterback who likes to throw celestial touchdowns (Hail Marys?) whenever the mood strikes him.  The crowd roars!<br>  <br>  As for those who would insist that God made Man in His image: I have no argument with that.  For all we know, He may look at each one of us and see -- a star.
JZxZ8mKRaa	John 5:28,29 -<br>  <br>  "Do not marvel at this, because the hour IS COMING in which all those in the memorial tombs WILL hear his voice"<br>  <br>  Those were Jesus' words using the future tense.<br>  <br>  Acts 24:15 -<br>  <br>  "that there is GOING TO BE a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous"<br>  <br>  Those were Peter's words using the future tense.<br>  <br>  1st Corinthians 15:23 -<br>  <br>  "But each one in his own rank: Christ the firstfruits, AFTERWARD those who belong to the Christ DURING HIS PRESENCE"<br>  <br>  Those were Paul's words using the future tense.<br>  <br>  And of course, since most churches or religions who claim to believe in Christ are still looking for this "presence" to take place, then their belief would indicate that till that happens that none of those in union with Christ have been resurrected. That would be their teaching of their own volition.<br>  <br>  According to this scripture, if our religion is still waiting for the presence of Christ, we are still waiting for the resurrection. <br>  <br>  But some have commented contrary to the scripture.<br>  <br>  Either the presence is here and the resurrection has begun or the presence is not here and the resurrection has not begun.<br>  <br>  Plain and simple.|`|oVHFz52Laa	Jesus resurrected and showed us that the death has no power over us when we place our faith in God|`|cetqJFuBaa	I think you can make a distinction between a spiritual resurrection and a physical one.  Jesus never had a spiritual resurrection because his spirit was never dead.  He did have a dead body, though, and it was resurrected, along with many others at the time of his death.  The idea that there is a resurrection now can be seen as the resurrection of the spirit.  You are born again now (presumably).  The resurrection at his second coming, though, will be a bodily resurrection, where we will get new, uncorrupted bodies.<br>  <br>  That's my thought, at least.|`|uTJsoYzzaa	Peoples souls never die, when the physical body that they reside in dies, they either go to heaven or hell.  Immediately.<br>  <br>  Though, when Jesus comes to earth for the 2nd time. . . well, that's another, long, complicated story.  The best way I've seen it told is through the LEFT BEHIND SERIES by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins.  This is sci-fi, action packed, and based on Bible prophecy.  It's kindof like a historical fiction, just, futorial, or something.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I hope this helps,<br>  God Bless,<br>  jazmagirl
JZxZ8mKRaa	No. Blood is not to be used to sustain the body, either medically or through food use.<br>  <br>  Blood was to be offered back to Jehovah God per Genesis chapter 9 - by either symbolically offering it back by pouring out, or as was done in the past, offering it as/in a sacrifice.<br>  <br>  Today we do not offer animal sacrifices, but we still do "pour out" by properly bleeding our animals for food.<br>  <br>  Re-adding that blood back into the meat in a sausage for human consumption would not be obeying the edict to "pour out".|`|tx4bRDrXaa	(Acts 15:28-29) For the holy spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to YOU, except these necessary things, 29?to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication.

Whether someone has a brilliant voice or is a brain surgeon, they're both talented. <br>  There are different kinds of talent too. What is being 'good' at something? Does it mean you've inherently got the gift to learn the skill quickly, or does it just mean someone who's worked really hard at something so they're at a high level? For example, if you learn science really well, but you don't try so you don't achieve a good exam result.

pxf9LwQJaa	A major mistake people often make is assuming that ancient egypt was a homogeneous society. Truth is it was one of the original melting pots. Not only is it very close to greece, but it was close to the ancient land of nubia and cush. <br>  Egypt had blacks, by way of nubia and cush, as a matter of fact the first egyptian empires were black (When I say first empires I mean before the kingdom united under the scorpion king), however egypt, like most ancient kingdoms always has had a turbulent past. Many invasions, takeovers, etc. Naturally this leads to confusion. There were blacks in egypt, however their contributions are mostly in the earliest histories, by the time that egypt had reached it's zenith of power, arabs were the majority of the populations, and technically they are considered caucasian. This doesn't mean that blacks disappeared however, there were distinguished black scholars, and the reported mother of king tut, queen tiye was nubian in orgin.|`|e6t9FPUdaa	White people is a term which is usually used to refer to human beings characterized, at least in part, by the light pigmentation of their skin. It often refers narrowly to people claiming ancestry exclusively from Europe.A broadly corresponding and sometimes synonymous concept is the Caucasian race. Caucasoid people from the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Central and South Asia are therefore also sometimes considered "white."<br>  <br>  Do a little research and you will find what I found above.

They are of people in varying shades from pinkish, to light brown to black. They have varying facial features too,from caucasoid to African. They were mixed race people. I don't think the divisions we have today regarding 'race' were anywhere near as deep in ancient times.<br>     Certainly Ramses II was a white man-a Libyan with a very  prominent nose and naturally red hair. His mtdna was H, a common European type.<br>     I don't know why I'm bothering to even write this though--i mean you wrote 'I didn't see one blonde or blue eyed one'. Um,the vast majority of white people do not have blonde hair and blue eyes!! That colouring was a late mutation and is much les common than brown hair/eyes. When people first entered Europe from the near and middle east (yes, that's where they ALL came from, they didn't spring out of the ice in the far north like some people seem to imply!) they almost ALL had brown hair and brown eyes (there was probably a small minority of red heads thrown into  the mix.)|`|pfke6Jieaa	egyptians were already proven to be of the caucasoid phentoype, which means they are dark skinned caucasians. who are dark skinned caucasians? middle easterns of course. there were some nubians and europeans later on who mixed with egyptians but that doesnt mean that they were black or white. <br>  <br>  the first ones to invade egypt were africans i believe. then it was arabs from the arabian peninsula. europeans came after that. i think u need to take a look at the ancient drawings from thousands of years ago and then tell me if egyptians were black. there are africans in the picture also so just compare. if you think a long nose and deep-set big eyes are black features then u must smoking something.<br>  <br>  i find that only blacks claim ancient egyptians were black. yet there is no proof that states they were, even egyptian art shows they looked caucasian. i will upload some pictures to show you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bazaarinegypt.com/catalog/images/Ancient%20Egyptians%20Dress%20Papyrus.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://bazaarinegypt.com/catalog/images/...</a><br>  <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/3538/Egyptian0001D29D.Egyptian.gif" rel="nofollow">http://library.thinkquest.org/3538/Egypt...</a><br>  <br>  notice only africans were painted with very dark brown color. egyptians were painted maroon brown and lighter too. and look at their facial features. last time i checked black people didnt have straight sharp noses and deep set eyes. that is a caucasian feature, but it doesnt mean they were white either.<br>  <br>  and the nubian empire has nothing to do with egypt. you people are uneducated i swear. and king of london, that is only ONE person. one person doesnt prove thats how all people look. and nine, you are even dumber. blacks dont have sharp noses and deeper eyes. we have those features. stop being so damn ignorant and get educated about history.<br>  <br>  for the dumbasses that said they are black, maybe u should type in ancient egyptian people and see how many blacks are in the artifacts and drawings. most look like middle easterns. u see one black person and you think they are all black. everything great is black. did u ever read the bible?<br>  <br>  when moses went escaped to egypt no one was able to tell him apart. i think you people need to put down ur facts, especially nine. all ur answers are ignorant with VERY little evidence and too damn general. plz just get over ur self or at least be intelligent. ur answer makes absolutely no sense. <br>  <br>  i challenge anyone that can prove to me they are black right now. email me if you have the guts and if you think you can back up that they were black. im open to anyone. if i dont get any emails or answers from the people who claim they are black then it must mean you are a DUMBASS.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Race_of_Ancient_Egyptians/Draft" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Race_o...</a><br>  <br>  the ppl who thumbed me down are more than likely black. and im probably gonna get labled as a racist because of the sensitivity to losing an argument.<br>  <br>  angry cat, they will never believe you. to them even if a person has arab features as long they were in africa it means he is a different looking black person....lol....THE most ridiculous mindset. i dont see any proof that they were black. i mostly see articles on here and evidence, strong one, that they are middle eastern. im still waiting for someone to prove me wrong. all i hear is opinion. because that is the ONLY thing that wil make someone think they are black, THE only thing.|`|qSWQx2Guaa	When you say 700ad invasion you are speaking of the spread of Islam though military might through the Arabian peninsula, into Africa and into the modern day ares of the western Russia.

It was the military spread of Islam.  <br>  <br>  Blacks were not Pharaohs.  Genetic testing has proved this.  Get over it and stop trying to change history to make yourself happy.  You can not change history or genetics.<br>  <br>  So you are basically saying the Egyptian historians and scholars we have today are in a conspiracy against you and the black people to keep you "down".  wow, good luck proving that theory.

Oh wait, yes I do. White people can not believe that there could be a successful Black empire.<br>  <br>  But also the idea that a desert somehow seperates PEOPLE ON THE SAME CONTINENT better than an entire sea. <br>  Map of the world for people who are intelligent:<br>  <a href="http://www.lib.washington.edu/subject/geography/geog371/map_world.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.lib.washington.edu/subject/ge...</a><br>  <br>  Here is Middle East:<br>  <a href="http://www.musicoftheworld.com/map_world.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicoftheworld.com/map_world...</a><br>  Yes I can see where people get the idea that there "sub saharan" Africa is so seperate from North African and the Middle East is much closer. The Middle East and North Africa are NOT the same things. I hate how people try to seperate Africa.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh man people are very stupid. So becuase it is on a "list" (a list created by white people) we just need to accept it. And since when is caucasion a skin color. Race doesn't exist anyway but ever notice how first white is European and as new empires are discovered soon the whole world is Caucasion. Lol. And then you have the retards who think becuase the statures depict a phenotype different from the one found in West Africa they were not Black. AFRICANS ALL LOOK DIFFERENT AND THEY ARE ALL BLACK. At this rate Nigerians will be the only ones allowed to call themselves black. Apparently even Middle Easterns are "dark skinned white". Lmao. But don't worry Nigerians just come up with a really succesful idea and you will get to join the white family. Becuase clearly being sucessful is all it takes to be called white. And then I hear people talking about DNA tests but I see no sources. And these mouth breathers don't even see anything wrong with their statements. Too busy enjoying the smell of their own white farts.<br>  <br>  DOUBLE EDIT: I shouldn't have to research on your claims. And Ely I know you are not trying to use modern day Egpytians as proof of Ancient Egptians, it has been proven numerous times that the two are not the same since various invasions. Yes yes Anosh we all know you are desperate to be white. I am the one who backs up my points with nonsense? I already know your position on any blacks who don't look like this:<br>  <a href="http://breleasedradio.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/DSC00288.15583905_std.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://breleasedradio.com/yahoo_site_adm...</a><br>  not being Black. Maybe East Africans are mixed with Middle Eastern but what bugs me is that it works both ways but you and people like you don't want to accept that. The same white people saying that North Africans were Europeans and Middle Easterners (anything but black) would refuse to believe that Europeans are Black. If White people found their way to Africa then Black people found their way to Europe. If East Africans are mixed with Middle Eastern then MEs are mixed with East African. Oh wait, I forgot. Anything successful in Non-African societies is attibuted to the intelligence of the Non-Africans but anything successful Blacks do is attributed to Non blacks. I can't email you because you blocked me becuase other people with valid points different then yours make you strain your brain too hard. I don't want to email you anyway, some of your crazy nonsensical illogic might wash off on me. In fact, I can feel my IQ points slipping right now. Pretty soon you will see me walking around all zombified, the only thing I will be able to say is "Black people must have wide flat noses, ebony skin and big lips. Anything else is a White person. The Saharan desert seperated North African and Sub saharan Africa like an impenetrable wall. This is so clear to me now. But of course the Mediterranian and Red sea and Cacuasas and Alpine Mountains were no match for White people and Middle Eastern people and Semitic people to find their way to Africa. Everyone knows Sub Saharan Africans are allergic to sand and wouldn't have the technology (ie camels) to cross this impenetrable ocean of sand. They would be repelled. Of course Egyptians were White and looked like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.mrdowling.com/images/702cleopatra.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mrdowling.com/images/702cleop...</a><br>  How silly of me to think otherwise.

Ancient Egypt (Kemet) was next to another large empire called Nubia that was NO DOUBT all African with dark skin. They also had pyramids and traded with Egypt. They even almost conquered Egypt once! The Egyptians were a mix of Middle Eastern people and many black Africans, NONE were white until Rome started to have kids with them and the nations got close. But Anciet Egypt, where all the great things come from was mostly black and some Middle Easterners. Thats why the Sphinx was a black man. <br>  <br>  And an American slave owner (i forgot his name) took a trip to Egypt back in the old days and commented on how Ironic it was that his "inferior" slaves and Africans could've once had such a great empire. Somehow through the years people decided they weren't black, but anyone with a brain can find out how stupid that is.|`|jiMAtaCraa	Didn't you know - Blacks are genetically inferior? <br>  <br>  Of course, the only things we are good for is having a high libido and jumping a few hurdles. I mean, anything successful was always in part of a White person's dexterity and talent.<br>  <br>  Becca: That wasn't a slave owner. It was Napoleon. He and his soldiers shot off the noses of all the statues they deemed as having "Black features", with the nose being one of the most exemplary of a Black individual. They could never allow it to be known that such an "inferior" race could have built something of such magnitude, magnificence and importance.<br>  <br>  Some of the answerers here are too funny. Egypt is "White" or "Middle Eastern" (which in fact in itself doesn't exist - it is a relatively new term) in terms of civilized advancement but "Black" when used to show how somehow Blacks started slavery.

What you do purely grieves the spirit, and this is not good at all.<br>  Yes almost everyday I want to be away from my parents house because the bible is true that when one comes to the Lord it causes divisions in the home. I am an open book and so is my life, so what I speak about is no shame to me nor should it be hidden. My father is a non believer and for some odd reason he is always at odds with me, and I have come to realize that he has demons inside him. He sleeps during the day and tapes up his window so that no sunlight can come in, he is always negative and can never be wrong. He scares me because he does not believe that he has anything wrong, and he would rather sign me off to a mental hospital than to listen and learn about the devil that has existed well before mankind was created.<br>  <br>  Yes I feel like waiting on the Lord is the hardest thing for me. He is petty about the things that dont matter and what does he shuns. I admit that he helps me being back at home but its not him, more than its my mother and the fact that I am a single parent. I wonder, how does one honor a man who has done nothing truly GOOD for you all your life? HE does exactly what the bible tells a father NOT to do, and my mother though she has faith, she worships the way that she wants as well not wanting to pray together as a family should. I am often flabbergasted by the way things really are, but what can I say except keep striving for the LORD?<br>  <br>  Hang in there my friend, things will get better, but maybe you need to be sure that you are in the faith.

Speaking of love and compassion towards others fills us (fruit is a positive thing), so the opposite would cause us to feel empty and angry inside.|`|fsLcf6Nfaa	Our Words, Over Time, Define Us:  “From the fruit of his mouth a man’s stomach is filled; with the harvest of his lips he is satisfied”.<br>      Our words produce consequences.  People respond and react to us depending on what we say to them.  This is not only true in the immediate situation - but over time.  Over the long run our words at as a frame - bringing the picture of who we are into focus.  Our words create the understanding that people have of us.<br>      Consequently the person who uses filthy language - over time - comes to be known as a filthy person.  The person who speaks with gentleness over time comes to be known as gentle.  This is obvious.<br>  <br>  <br>  Our Words Seek to Satisfy Us:  The second half of verse 20 is an ironic statement.  “... with the harvest of his lips he is satisfied” - meaning both “filled” but also happy about being filled.  This gets down to what is going on in the human heart.  We satisfy ourselves with our own words.  The words we speak are chosen and spoken to fulfill the desires in our hearts.<br>  <br>  ~ The arrogant man who despises others and rehearses his entitlements is setting himself above others.<br>  ~ The unbelieving man who rejects the testimony of others and rehearses his doubts and objections is following his own faith.<br>  ~ The recalcitrant man who refuses to change his ways or listen to others and rehearses his excuses is choosing his own will and way.<br>   <br>      Each of these are filled or satisfied - (although our own words never truly satisfy us) with the harvest of what we say.   We feed ourselves on our own words|`|rU6nh42Eaa	That's a reversed metaphor.  The book of Proverbs is full of interesting figures of speech.

Choosing to have faith in God isn't much different the having faith that the sun will come up every morning.

They'd butchered animals, or had female animals die in various stages of pregnancy. They may have dissected human cadavers too, why not?  So they would know that a baby forms from a lump, and grows.<br>  <br>  What they had in common with the Hebrews of a couple thousand years earlier was the belief that the woman contributed no DNA to the baby.  Of course they didn't know what DNA was, and that's forgivable, you wouldn't expect them to.  But they believed the woman's body was just a 'vessel', that all the baby came from the man.   I know ancient Jews and Greeks and Romans thought that, an this text seems to make it clear that early Arabs knew it too.<br>  <br>  The Arabs of that time were among the most advanced culture on earth!  They invented algebra, they had very deep philosophers and writers, and they collected written works from all over the world to study and learn about.  That a baby grows from a 'clot' is not too much to expect people of that time to understand.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	Why do you keep asking the same question in different forms?

The proposed system is simple, comprehensive, and conforms with present embryological knowledge. The intensive studies of the Quran and Hadith (reliably transmitted sayings and reports of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) in the last four years have revealed a system of classifying human embryos that is amazing since it was recorded in the 7th century A.D. Although Eric Statle, the founder of the science of embryology, realized that chick embryos developed in stages from his studies of hen's eggs in the fourth century B.C., he did not give any details about these stages. As far as it is known from the history of embryology, little was known about the staging and classification of human embryos until the twentieth century. For this reason, the descriptions of the human embryo in the Quran cannot be based on scientific knowledge in the 7th century A.D. The only reasonable conclusion is that these descriptions were revealed to Muhammad from God. He could not have known such details because he was an illiterate man with absolutely no scientific training."|`|LGvwl67waa	Hardly impressive, those are only observations that don't so much as require a microscope.<br>  <br>  The reason the western medical field didn't get that is because it was punishable by death to study the human body, considered inviolable and sacred by the Church. The interdiction lasted until the late 18th century and even then, people were very judgmental of people who dared study human anatomy.<br>  <br>  If you want to be impressed by ancient medicine, you should study the Ancient Egypt's healers manuscripts. They had knowledge of virology, fractures, male & female biological clock... they even performed open skull surgeries!<br>  <br>  But the ancient culture that impresses me the most are the Inca and their knowledge of mathematics and astronomy.<br>  <br>  ...

Doubt it.<br>  <br>  So, in my attempt at best answer, according to the "ego" (Everybody's Got One) I decided to challenge you with a question of my own. <br>  <br>  You normally ask questions of some valid spiritual content as though seeking the things of the Kingdom with all your heart, and I thought I would ask you LOB...did you just get bored today, or are you really interested in a bumper sticker?<br>  <br>  Here's the kicker. You were in the parking lot when YOU saw it.  If you are following Jesus that closely, then you are not really following at all, are you?  Shouldn't we all think for one minute that maybe we believe we are following Christ closely only to realize that we parked behind something that "looked" like Christ.  To our astonishment, some time later, we realize that we have not, in fact, moved at all in some time.  Jesus never stopped in the things pertaining to the Father, so if we find that we have pulled up and parked somewhere,  it most certainly is not Jesus behind whom we have parked.

It could be the word Spanish flows easier than Hispanic. Plus, the language they speak is Spanish... so perhaps they're just identifying Spanish as those who speak Spanish, though it may not be technically correct.<br>  <br>  Some people wonder why Iranians mostly call themselves Persian today.|`|2gyJUTzRaa	they don't|`|vs5rK3iRaa	They don't, in my experience.

355JLlcLaa	Monkeys and apes have a sense of morality and the rudimentary ability to tell right from wrong, according to new research. <br>  <br>  In a series of studies scientists have found that monkeys and apes can make judgments about fairness, offer altruistic help and empathise when a fellow animal is ill or in difficulties. They even appear to have consciences and the ability to remember obligations. <br>  <br>  The research implies that morality is not a uniquely human quality and suggests it arose through evolution. That could mean the strength of our consciences is partly determined by our genes. <br>  <br>  Such findings are likely to antagonise fundamentalist religious groups. Some believe the ability to form moral judgments is a God-given quality that sets humans apart. <br>  <br>  The scientists say, however, that the evidence is clear. “I am not arguing that non-human primates are moral beings but there is enough evidence for the following of social rules to agree that some of the stepping stones towards human morality can be found in other animals,” said Frans de Waal, professor of psychology at Emory University in Georgia in the United States. <br>  <br>  In papers at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) this weekend de Waal described experiments on monkeys and apes to see if they understood the idea of fairness. <br>  <br>  The animals were asked to perform a set of simple tasks and then rewarded with food or affection. The rewards were varied, seemingly at random. De Waal found the animals had an acute sense of fairness and objected strongly when others were rewarded more than themselves for the same task, often sulking and refusing to take part any further. <br>  <br>  Another study looked at altruism in chimps - and found they were often willing to help others even when there was no obvious reward. “Chimpanzees spontaneously help both humans and each other in carefully controlled tests,” said de Waal. <br>  <br>  Other researchers, said de Waal, have found the same qualities in capuchin monkeys, which also show “spontaneous prosocial tendencies”, meaning they are keen to share food and other gifts with other monkeys, for the pleasure of giving. <br>  <br>  “Everything else being equal, they prefer to reward a companion together with themselves rather than just themselves,” he said. “The research suggests that giving is self-rewarding for monkeys.” <br>  <br>  Related research found primates can remember individuals who have done them a favour and will make an effort to repay them. <br>  <br>  De Waal, who has written a book called Primates and Philosophers, said morality appeared to have evolved in the same way as organs such as the eye and the heart, through natural selection. <br>  <br>  The debate over whether animals can tell right from wrong and make moral choices dates back to Charles Darwin, originator of the theory of evolution. <br>  <br>  He suggested that when sexual reproduction first evolved it forced animals to develop codes of behaviour that became built into their genes. In humans these instincts developed into a sense of right and wrong. This fitted with his view that humans were derived from animals - a view fiercely opposed by the church at the time. <br>  <br>  The big question now is why, alone among the primates, humans have developed morality to such a high level. It implies that humans were once subjected to some kind of powerful evolutionary pressure to develop a conscience. <br>  <br>  Some researchers believe we could owe our consciences to climate change and, in particular, to a period of intense global warming between 50,000 and 800,000 years ago. The proto-humans living in the forests had to adapt to living on hostile open plains, where they would have been easy prey for formidable predators such as big cats. <br>  <br>  This would have forced them to devise rules for hunting.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	These are not just human traits.

Each animal has a different personality and in a pack of hens or dogs, there will be a dominant one, a kind one, a weak one and the ones who follow the dominant one.Some types of animal are more prone to different personalities (Labradors are easy going, Rhode Island Red hens are bossy).<br>  <br>  In the summer, our Silkey hens had a lot of chicks and in the evening when the hens fluffed up their feathers to keep the chicks warm , the cockerel did the same.When last summer, a doberman had pups but was a lazy mother, so it was the male dad who would check on and clean the pups.Our bantam cockerel always lets the smaller, weaker hens take food first, but the Rhode Island Reds would never do that.The same cockerel keeps watch for the hens when they are stealing food from the dogs kennel, often with the dog in the kennel at the time!Cows will trust a friendly face enough to get a back rub of a friendly person.I had a spaniel who enjoyed the company of cows.My grandparents' dog knew to be gentle with  them.<br>  <br>  So, yes animals do experience the same emotion as us humans, but they cannot rationalize their thoughts or make a deep decision.They can make minor decisions, such as doing something they know they should not, when they think humans are away.|`|wcDUOiC8aa	We, as humans are damned to burn forever.

For example, they hide their food and then move it when nobody is looking because they know that if they saw someone hide food they would dig in that place afterwards to get it.<br>  <br>  We have to bear in mind that our emotions and skills must have come from somewhere and it's likely that other animals need similar skills, so for others to have them is no big deal.<br>  <br>  Edit- Woah, dude, why so angry about my classes?

Many Heathens believe that the battle is actually on the page now.  Combating misconceptions, getting information out to those seeking and standing proud for the gods.

Some of them did this when there was not much war.  One could always wear a Valknut and hope for the best.  I don't recommend killing yourself at all.  Odin is also tied in with bravery, knowlege, and poetry.  Remember, he hung on Yggdrasil for 9 days to get the Runes.  Working with the Runes, seaking knowlege, and being un-afraid of challenges might also land you a spot there.  <br>  <br>  Also of note, only half of the slain in battle make it into Valhalla, the other half go to Freya's Hall.

Agnostics do not.<br>  <br>  I'm frankly astonished that you even ask.|`|usIma0vIaa	Agnosticism (Greek: α- a-, without + γν?σι? gnōsis, knowledge; after Gnosticism) is the philosophical view that the truth value of certain claims — particularly metaphysical claims regarding theology, afterlife or the existence of deities, ghosts, or even ultimate reality — is unknown or, depending on the form of agnosticism, inherently impossible to prove or disprove. It is often put forth as a middle ground between theism and atheism[1], though it is not a religious declaration in itself. Agnosticism does not preclude religious belief; that is to say, an agnostic can be a theist or an atheist, but can be 'agnostically' so. See Nathan Seldomridge Demographic research services normally list agnostics in the same category as atheists and/or non-religious people,[2] using 'agnostic' in the sense of 'noncommittal'.[3][dubious – discuss] However, this can be misleading given the existence of agnostic theists, who identify themselves as both agnostics in the original sense and followers of a particular religion. Some authors assert that it is possible to be both an atheist and an agnostic[4] and some nontheists self-identify as agnostic atheists.<br>  <br>  Philosophers and thinkers who have written about agnosticism include Thomas Henry Huxley, Albert Einstein, Robert G.

Agnosticism is not to be confused with religious views opposing the doctrine of gnosis and Gnosticism—these are religious concepts that are not generally related to agnosticism. Huxley used the term in a broad sense.<br>  <br>  In recent years, use of the word to mean "not knowable" is apparent in scientific literature in psychology and neuroscience,[5] and with a meaning close to "independent", in technical and marketing literature, e.g. "platform agnostic" or "hardware agnostic".<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Qualifying agnosticism<br>  Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume contended that meaningful statements about the universe are always qualified by some degree of doubt.[6] The fallibility of human beings means that they cannot obtain absolute certainty except in trivial cases where a statement is true by definition (as in, "all bachelors are unmarried" or "all triangles have three angles"). All rational statements that assert a factual claim about the universe that begin "I believe that ...." are simply shorthand for, "Based on my knowledge, understanding, and interpretation of the prevailing evidence, I tentatively believe that...." For instance, when one says, "I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald shot John F. Kennedy," one is not asserting an absolute truth but a tentative belief based on interpretation of the assembled evidence. Even though one may set an alarm clock prior to the following day, believing that waking up will be possible, that belief is tentative, tempered by a small but finite degree of doubt (the earth might be destroyed, or one might die before the alarm goes off).<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church sees merit in examining what it calls Partial Agnosticism, specifically those systems that "do not aim at constructing a complete philosophy of the Unknowable, but at excluding special kinds of truth, notably religious, from the domain of knowledge."[7] However, the Church is historically opposed to a full denial of the ability of human reason to know God. The Council of the Vatican, relying on biblical scripture, declares that "God, the beginning and end of all, can, by the natural light of human reason, be known with certainty from the works of creation" (Const. De Fide, II, De Rev.)[8]<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Types of agnosticism<br>  Agnosticism can be subdivided into several subcategories. Recently suggested variations include:<br>  <br>  Strong agnosticism (also called "hard," "closed," "strict," or "absolute agnosticism") <br>  —the view that the question of the existence or nonexistence of a deity or deities and the nature of ultimate reality is unknowable by reason of our natural inability to verify any experience with anything but another subjective experience. A strong agnostic would say, "I cannot know whether a deity exists or not, and neither can you." <br>  Weak agnosticism (also called "soft," "open," "empirical," or "temporal agnosticism") <br>  —the view that the existence|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Unitarians do not believe in the central dogma of Christianity which is the Trinity.

1CS2KR7Taa	Since all religions were invented by humans, from the Creator's point of view it does not make any difference. All humans are equal, there is absolutely no difference between us.<br>  There is nothing else in creation but the creating force and the creatures.<br>  All we have to do is find the direct connection to that force by adjusting ourselves until we reach the qualities of that force, and then we will be able to sense it.<br>  And this can only happen during our normal life here on earth, where we can actually work on ourselves. The whole work involves understanding that we humans are completely disconnected from each other due to our egoistic selfish qualities, and we need to change that.<br>  So we need to establish a new type of human society, where everybody is interconnected, but the connections are based on unconditional giving and love, the priority being the well being of the whole instead of the selfish pleasures of the individual.<br>  And this change has to be free, open to all the people, and practically easy to achieve.<br>  If we honestly think about it neither the religious nor the present atheist (or scientist) world view can achieve this.<br>  I hope it helps with your question, all the best.|`|UWKF7x4faa	At least some of them used the brain I gave them!|`|283tO9j9aa	If there is an omnipotent, omniscient being out there I'm fairly sure the actions of a few individuals over the course of eternity wouldn't bother it too much.

The proofs are presented to those who will listen and if they don't want to believe it, thats their choice. If they're stupid enough not to recognize the facts then they are presented to them then He (God) considers them stupid and unreasoning. What person doesn't admit it when the proof is as plain as the nose on their face? A person that just doesn't want to believe. People though can change and if an Atheist comes to his senses through proofs of God's existance and grows in knowledge of the evidence that God exists,  God's veiwpoint and feelings for that person can change. An Atheist doesn't have to accept things merely because he or she has experienced bad things or whatever reason caused them not to believe, he or she should really make sure that what they believe is factual. It is our obligation in life to make sure of things because its too much of an important thing in life to find out about someone that is said to have created life and this earthly home. We should be grateful to a person that does that for us. Gives us the air we breathe and the existance we have. He is not responsible for the bad that happens to us but he does give us reason to hope that life can be better for us now and even greater not much later from  now when he takes charge of the rule over the earth.|`|uJO0MbShaa	IF gods were real, (and that's a very big IF) gods would probably consider us the more evolved, more free-thinking, less dependent of the human race.|`|rh8szekzaa	I'm sure he wouldn't care.

So know that while you are young & adjusting you will get to feel more comfortable & be as at home there as you are at home now. You will get a good education & do well in your feild. It is as if you are going to grow into yourself. You will make new freinds where you are going so this is not a problem cause you will meet good people who will be lifelong freinds. You will alls go your own way after graduation but with e-mail & phones & planes you will see your friends again & the connection will be strong no matter how far the distance. You worry for nothing. You will apply for something that can help you financially & eventually get a job maybe at the University or some place that will help you financially. You are going to make a nice income in the career you end up in & so you might have some loans.

And he will punish the Jews when they sin, for they do have the law. 13 For it is not merely knowing the law that brings God's approval. Those who obey the law will be declared right in God's sight. 14 Even when Gentiles, who do not have God's written law, instinctively follow what the law says, they show that in their hearts they know right from wrong. 15 They demonstrate that God's law is written within them, for their own consciences either accuse them or tell them they are doing what is right. 16 The day will surely come when God, by Jesus Christ, will judge everyone's secret life.

Because it is part of everything, it is both impersonal and personal.  One cannot be apart from God because it is part of everything, but at the same time, it gives all life energy to be creative and learn, and connect back to one's source so it can also learn and expand from the experience of its parts. Being disconnected from God, therefore, is a psychological aberration, not a a spiritual reality.<br>      Sometimes I will tell people that I don't believe in God - my inside joke -  but then follow it with the comment 'belief implies doubt'.  It is like believing in gravity while on this planet - you don't have to believe in it, but its force will still keep you from flying into space.<br>  <br>       Like gravity, the essence of God is a given - something that exists beyond belief.

It is also the term we use to describe the consequences or effects of that fall.  For Adam, original sin was a personal, actual sin.  For us, it’s an impersonal sin, not an actual sin.  But here we distinguish; we do not separate, because it’s all of a piece.  There is a bond that unites sin in all its forms.<br>  <br>  When teachers discuss the mystery of original sin, they often use the metaphor of a “stain on the soul”.  But that’s only a metaphor. Sin isn’t essentially a stain; it isn’t a spiritual substance.  It isn’t a thing at all.  It is, rather, the lack of something, the absence of something, namely sanctifying grace.  The indwelling life of the Trinity was evacuated from human nature by Adam’s sin.  That’s what original sin is.  We have to get at it by explaining what it isn’t.  It’s the absence of something necessary for human beings to reach their divinely appointed end.  The absence of sanctifying grace certainly does plunge us into darkness and blindness and death.<br>  <br>  But it’s critically important for us to recognize that original sin is not something that’s transmitted biologically or psychologically.  Yet at the same time we can speak of original sin as being something hereditary.  Pope Pius XI wrote that “Original sin is the hereditary but impersonal fault of Adam’s descendants.”<br>  <br>  Even that word choice - fault – might lead you to believe that original sin is something that renders us guilty.  But it isn’t.  Think of fault here in the sense of the San Andreas Fault, the fracture in the earth’s crust that renders California vulnerable to devastating earthquakes.  It isn’t my fault, but it’s like a fault line that runs my soul and inclines me to be separate from God.<br>  <br>  Original sin is the hereditary but impersonal fault of Adam’s descendants: One man’s trespass led to condemnation for all men…By one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, who have sinned in him. (Rom 5:18-19)<br>  <br>  The mystery, of course, is how we sinned in Adam.  We sinned in Adam, in a sense, because there is a mystical solidarity we share with him, based upon two realities: biologically, we’re his descendants; and theologically, he’s our covenant head.  As our father, he is our representative in making the covenant with God.  Since he broke the covenant, we, his progeny, inherit the consequences.  Consider an analogy from human relations:  If I mismanaged my business affairs and ended by declaring bankruptcy before passing my estate to my sons and daughter, my creditors could pursue my children, now rendered debtors through our family bond.<br>  <br>  In effect, original sin means the loss of sanctifying grace and, therefore, the loss of eternal life.  The soul is immortal, and people in hell will live everlastingly, though miserably.  Eternal life is more than everlasting.  It is God’s life, divine life.  God alone is eternal because He utterly transcends time.  So when we speak of eternal life, we are talking about sharing in the very being and communion of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  And that is what humanity lost through original sin.<br>  Original sin is hereditary but impersonal.  It is contracted, not committed; and we contract original sin without consent.  That is why God can remove original sin without personal consent, as He does with newborn babies on their baptismal day.<br>  <br>  The same thing can be said for actual sin.  Actual sin can only be committed through informed consent.  And so it can only be removed through informed consent.  That’s why we need confession.|`|BAaf9NKdaa	Again, God is NOT punishing anyone. he warned Adam about<br>   the tree and the results of the tree in staying free of it. Instead<br>   Adam chose to steer free of God's warning about the tree. As a<br>   matter of fact he developed the desire to be like God. God had <br>   told him about the tree and also told him to multiply and have children.<br>     Had Adam listened and had children before he decided to do as<br>   he pleased their possibly would have been no need for Jesus to<br>   manifest human life on earth to give back to God what Adam<br>   gave away and that was a perfect life. Adams children inherited his<br>   desire to sin and therefore they too, inherited death. It took Adam<br>   930 years not to live but to die the natural effect of his sin because<br>   of how perfect he was in being a created life with freedom to chose.<br>   Adam brought this death on his children. All God did was warn him <br>   what the results of his actions would be and thus was not the cause<br>   of Adams or anyone's death except in protecting the lineage of the <br>   seed that was to be sacrificed in giving a perfect life back to God.<br>   An eye for an eye; a tooth for a tooth; perfection for perfection; Adams<br>   perfect life given away and Christ Jesus giving his perfect life as a<br>   ransom for all of us from Adamic sinful death to his Father, God and<br>   Creator. Learn what God has in Store for those who are loyal to him<br>   and you will be rejoicing and giving him praise as you pray that his<br>   will be done on earth as it is in heaven....think about it!!!!!|`|dwPxU89Vaa	We are not punished because of Adam, humankind got coursed because of his desobeidience (excuse me for the spelling), we have now a flesh nature that lead us to sin. We are judged because of our own individual sins. As nobody are able to hold the holy perfect God's law, He send His only son so we can be forgiven for His blood and His ultimate sacrifice. You don't have to do or to probe nothing to get an A or a 100, you just need to present before God the Holy blood of the Lamb to be safe.|`|uVL1kJr4aa	if that was the case we'd b paying for our parent's sins. dont believe everything religon dishes out.  find your own answers and the truth.<br>  <br>  i believe we arent paying for adam N eve's sins. heck i dont even believe in "SINS". but i do believe in a right or a wrong.|`|9oWzVEToaa	Wow!  What school do you go to?  Since when does everyone start with an A and not a zero?|`|HbCWNCQzaa	we do....if a baby dies it goes to heaven.....as we get older we become more aware of whats right and wrong.....and for some reason we all seem to do wrong|`|rdEm25fEaa	It's supposed to be Jesus. Jesus is your 'chance' to get it right. You're born with sin, but through Jesus it gets wiped clean...like Adam started out. <br>  <br>  "Same within society. If someone breaks the law, only the one that disobeyed is punished, not society as a whole."<br>  <br>  Agreed, but sometimes the only reason a law or rule exists is because of a single person. This is a bad example, but when I was in school a kid fell off the monkey bars and broke his arm. His mom flipped a lid and got the monkey bars removed, ruining it for the rest of us. I know there are some laws like that, but I can't think of any right now.
AjPbtm7oaa	She wants to get married. What does Christian have to do with it?|`|luwBPdE8aa	I guess because she wants to get married.|`|3MM64geHaa	She may be actually practicing her beliefs.

vMXk9ohSaa	You need about five different paragraphs here.  Try to focus each paragraph on one subject and try to explain the issue before going into the details.  For example - after "...the rest is history."  Should be another paragraph, but you should say something else, because "the rest is history" sounds like it should be the end of a story. <br>  <br>  Sit it down for a few days, then pick it up again and re-read.

w3plOs6uaa	The Hebrew word for faith is ????? (emunah - Strong's #530) and is an action oriented word meaning "support". This is important because the Western concept of faith places the action on the one you have faith in, such as "faith in God". But, the Hebrew word ????? places the action on the one who "supports God". It is not knowing that God will act, but rather I will do what I can to support God. This idea of support for the word emunah can be seen in Exodus 17:12.|`|M9CWk3braa	Who wants to learn hebrew!|`|TyRfv0eoaa	You're probably not getting an answer because many of the people who speak Hebrew don't approve of tattoos.

There are actually law to protect you from this kind of behavior.  I suggest you sit down with her parents and tell them what has been going on.  I'm sure that if you tell them that, It's not that you don't like their daughter, it's that you don't feel comfortable with people in your apartment while you are away. Also have a talk with the daughter and tell her to please not volunteer you for anything in the future, because you have enough on your plate and can not handle anymore.|`|676ffb2c003e629d54b40e0eb68860f4aa	I would change the locks.|`|yjvv5bDjaa	grab her by the thorax and tell her to cut the ****!|`|u4liwDhAaa	She has no right to come into your residence when you are not there.

The best thing to do is to tell her parents, calmly and unemotionally, that she has been letting herself in to your living space and that she has violated your privacy and your security. Tell them that you don't want to cause ill-feeling between you, but that their daughter has overstepped the bounds of what is acceptable behavior by invading your living space, telling your private business to other tenants, and offering your services to your neighbor and that each of these circumstances makes you very uncomfortable. <br>  Part of what you are paying for is privacy - you do not pay rent to live in a public space.

XN0cYCATaa	If God is all powerful and loving, why is there suffering in the world? <br>  It is often asked why is there suffering in the world if God is all powerful and loving.  Why doesn't He stop it?  Can He or is He weaker than we think?  Suffering can fall into three simple categories: emotional, mental, and physical suffering.  But, there are a variety of causes for suffering:  morally corrupt (evil) people, disease, earthquakes, floods, famine, etc.<br>  <br>  There are different explanations for why God allows suffering, but none of them can satisfy everyone.  Therefore, I will simply list various reasons offered to account for suffering and evil in the world.<br>   <a href="http://www.carm.org/apologetics/evidence-and-answers/if-god-all-powerful-and-loving-why-there-suffering-world" rel="nofollow">http://www.carm.org/apologetics/evidence...</a>|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Consider life a "refining process."<br>  <br>  And truly, I didn't find God until life left me humbled and broken.<br>  <br>  Why do people suffer?  Because there is evil in this world.  And truly, people want to have the right to do evil if they want to...and so God lets them...just as He gives people the right to do good.<br>  <br>  Perhaps we should ask people why they make the choices they make that ultimately lead to human suffering?|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	I've noticed this and wondered this, too.  Among people in general, some suffer so much and some have a comparably easy life.  And it does not always coincide with whether they believe in God or not.  God must have a reason, but it sure is hard to understand from our perspective.|`|GGGpVvjBaa	Some people seem to suffer more than others but this is a matter of perception. We observe and place a personal construct on their situation  - we see ourselves there inside of their suffering.<br>  <br>  So, we do not - and cannot - really know the scope of another's suffering. We can empathize.|`|AA11212224	I can't speak for anybody else who's familiar with suffering, but I can speak for myself.  I was acquainted with death from a young age, and I was betrayed as a child in the worst way possible by someone I trusted and even loved.  I've had friends die, I've suffered from depression, anxiety, and PTSD, I've been witness to horrible accidents.  I have a sick husband and a mother with cancer (she's my only surviving parent).  <br>  <br>  So yeah, I'm familiar with suffering.  And you know what?  I praise God for it.  First of all, it's made me more compassionate towards others.  We need to carry each other.  How can we do that if we never suffer?<br>  <br>  Secondly, it's made me an incredibly resilient person.  I can handle just about anything, and survive it.  My family's worried about me, because of my mom, and because I'm living a continent and an ocean away.  But really, the first twenty-eight years of my life was a prelude to this.  I'm okay.  I'll be okay.  I'm glad it's me dealing with it, and not somebody else.  God chose this life for me, because He knew I could handle it.  And I can.<br>  <br>  Third, it's made me thankful for what I DO have.  I have a very special, close relationship with my siblings.  We're all very loving towards each other.  I have some of the best friends in the world.  Even living 7,000 miles away, knowing that their thoughts, hopes, good vibes and prayers are with my family and me means more than anything.  I have friends I can lean on, and who can lean on me.<br>  <br>  Fourth, it's taught me that nothing is promised to us.  If we love someone, we should tell them so, even if we have to do it through clenched teeth.  They could be gone tomorrow.  Life is so fleeting.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the long answer, but this is obviously something I'm passionate about.  I wouldn't wish my life on anyone, but I also wouldn't trade it.  In a way, I think I chose it.|`|IhSE9gPBaa	When  child is being abused, usually its by a human. That human had free will to hurt the child witch in turn effected the child in a negative way. The Chimpanzee attack was a choice the owner made by getting a chimpanzee knowing something like that could happen. One that drinks to much that was their choice when they took their first drink.<br>  <br>  Humans that make good choices, bad choices effects the world, effects other humans. Most of the world sadness and pain was caused by humans that makes wrong choices. I am a christian, but what I said is very logical.
DW2u5HODaa	I don't know about other Christians... but my husband and I are night owls. We stay up until one or two most nights.

Everyone who knows me know that come 6:00 P.M. on Saturday night I go into what I call Church-Mode. No phone, no company. The majority of the time I watch "In Touch Ministries," with Dr. Charles Stanley on T.B.N. (Be careful what you watch) then my shower, clothes, clean-out my vehicle if needed, prepare early morning med's if needed and whatever else that must take place. I pray that none will leave the church without becoming familiar with Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  I look forward to serving the Lord on the Sabbath, it is a day to honor and to glorify Him.<br>  <br>  One that willingly sleeps in on the Sabbath sacrifices his own soul.|`|82AAOxCfaa	my hubby and i go to church on sat nights (well at 5pm), go to dinner after, the movies or we go play pool or chill with friends. we don't get to bed to late...(if you know what i mean). we stay in bed late on sundays and then make plans for the rest of the day.|`|AA11503457	I do now that I'm in my 40s, but I once upon a time I was up pretty late on Sat nights.|`|tuOe65Pcaa	Most stay up late.|`|fsLcf6Nfaa	Everybody is different.

xFFZ0rH7aa	Well albinos have an obvious problem with sunlight. Maybe they come from an ancient people who were driven to live in caves by some horrible monster.Or possibly an ancestor was seduced by the moon goddess and all her offspring are as white and glowing as the moon. The main thing is it's your story whatever you say must be right. Have fun making up a new reality.

I know we evolved and the universe started with the big bang.|`|G9dZN8omaa	Hmmm....I'd have to say a little bit of all three.<br>  <br>  Science is more logical, and offers a lot more facts then religion does.<br>  <br>  I'd rather be an individual and think for myself instead of being told what to think.<br>  <br>  And I think that if there was a God, the Bible has it all wrong; the God in the Bible is a cruel sadistic being.|`|6jAVElX7aa	when atheists complain that God is a cruel sadistic person, makes me wonder if they are talking about themselves, because when one points the finger, two point back at them.  Anyone with thoughts like that in their hearts are most likely to act upon those thoughts.|`|hiCSVwchaa	The third option isn't really an atheist.  It's just a pissed off theist.|`|GeoiGjbCaa	You tell me.|`|Znw52fxkaa	I'm the first...I'm not saying I'm smart. But I'm not an atheists to be different, or claiming to gate god, etc.<br>  <br>  I simple just...don't believe.<br>  <br>  But I do believe in evolution, etc. so I do believe in the scientific side of life.|`|751b6d52b808446c5c6ff2cb8a8d596aaa	I'm one of the smart ones, but it had nothing to do with science, it was common sense that made me give up religion.|`|iZIM4I8xaa	I disagree with putting people in such narrow categories.|`|rkhXCiIBaa	Actually, there are billions of types of atheist: one for each of us.|`|SRQXt14Baa	I don't know.

Einstein was some-what of a philosopher. When sweeping generalizations on religion are some what dangerous to make, this aspect of the atheist arena leaves the door open for innocent observation. Philosophy will never go away, and everyone has a right to it.|`|33701467e3b8f5182f183c20854ba38aaa	There are two types of atheists: 'strong' and 'weak'.  Atheism means “without belief”, specifically without belief in gods.  That includes both:<br>  <br>  Strong atheism, that says god/gods absolutely do not exist.  <br>  <br>  Weak atheism, that says there is no evidence that god/gods exist, therefore there is no reason to believe in them.  ie. A weak atheist doesn't claim to *know* that there are no gods whereas a strong atheist does.  Most scientists would take this (weak) opinion, as its the default stance for the existence of anything, from undiscovered species to unknown stellar phenomenon.|`|yJE7INkUaa	1.<br>  i just dont see how its possible for there to be a god.<br>  everything ive ever leaned about science rules against it|`|zrmaX7YCaa	Nonsense.

2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	Well that has nothing to do with God, it has to do with the culture of the area at the time. <br>  <br>  In those days (and even today in Moslem nations) the culture of the Middle East is very sexist. I have a friend who was over in Saudi Arabia with the Army in Gulf War 1, and a Saudi Officer he worked with quietly took him aside one day and asked "How much do you want for the blonde Sergeant that works for you?".  He tried to make a joke out of it after my buddy told him "I can't sell you a commissioned officer in the United States Army", but the guy was serious.  Women aren't respected over there, and the Saudi figured if he named a high enough price, arrangements could be made for her to be purchased. That's how it works in his country, even today.<br>  <br>  So if Abimelech died as the result of a woman killing him, he would be disgraced. It's not a "manly" way to die. Now you might say "Hey, he's dead, what does he care?" and there is something to that....but you name was very important to you in that culture, apparently he didn't want that being said of him, even if he wasn't around to hear it.<br>  <br>  Also, any of his sons, or anyone in his family would also be disgraced. Just as they would take pride in being related to Abimelech the mighty warrior, they would be shamed by being the guy who (in the schoolyard vernacular)  "got beat up by a girl".|`|x9iv6oBNaa	Men are ninnies.|`|EBGdlo35aa	Jdg 4:9 - no "disgrace" is mentioned.

Many Blacks claim Jesus was Black, when, in fact, the preponderance of evidence show he was Jewish Semitic White-whenever I,or, anyone else presents the facts, even when by true Black scholars(have the credentials), we are called racists.If you read my answers, this is the farthest from the truth in my case.I do not, have not, and will not condone prejudice against anyone.

How that happened, does NOT change the fact-not only that , there are artifacts in America with Chinese inscriptions on them-whether by sea or by land, they share a common heritage with the American Indians-many anthropologists actually classifying American Indians as a subclassification of the Mongoloid ethnicity.  Arabs(Semitic Whites) and Europeans(Indo European Aryan  Whites) are not related, again, proven by DNA. <br>  <br>  Marvin the Martian-again DNA proves the Ancient and Modern Egyptians are Arab Semitic White-statues, portraits, busts, show every nationality under the sun and are not proof-to date, the majority of DNA testing shows Arab Semitic White, small amounts of Nubian-people of Kemit-Sudanese,some Nilotics, Black/Arab Semitic White admixtures(i.e.-King Tut-experts disagree with me on that-call him Caucasian)-Moors, Berbers, Hamites, and very small amounts of all other ethnicities-do your genetic research.

Its also been proven that native americans and Asians have not had any similar DNA for at least 40,000 years (just before the Neanderthals died) and that we have our own unique blood types. However, the american public school system refuses to adapt their curricula to incorporate these new findings. They insist to this day that all native americans crossed a land bridge (never mind that this theory has never been proven) no more than 11,000 years ago and that we are all Asian. Yet, when even more evidence indicates that most Europeans and Arabs have common ancestry, recent common ancestry (as in only 10,000 years) everybody is quick to Deny it and pretend its all untrue (in the U.S. anyways, this research is being done by Europeans who have no problem linking their ancestors to asia and the Middle East) its sooo hilarious....|`|kHx1upOpaa	because you have to be white in america to be taken seriously.

Like when they say that the Moors were Black and Italians/Spaniards are part Black. <br>  However, i do think that sometimes Black researchers get undermined when they are speaking the truth-for example, it really annoys me when people say that the Ancient Egyptians weren't Black because it is obvious in both the remains, drawings, and statues (i.e. the sphinx) that the Ancient Egyptians were Black africans.|`|jiMAtaCraa	Both Afrocentrism and Eurocentrism are false schools-of-thought, as they orientate around the belief that the only people that have contributed to society are the people it supports and rallies (be it Blacks for Afrocentrism; Whites for Eurocentrism). Afrocentrism in its own right would assert that the ancient Chinese civilizations were Black, and/or would take parts of certain Central Asian civilizations and proclaim upon it that they were "Black" and that its adherents are simply defending themselves against the lurking miasma of White supremacists. Likewise with Eurocentrism, which steals a myriad of literal African nations and civilizations successes and proclaim upon it that such successes were due only with the help of the "White Man" (which in turn suggests undertones of genetic superiority). The most exemplary of this would be the whole Ancient Egypt debate. <br>  <br>  The above however was simply in theory (ceteris paribus). I've noticed that the term "Afrocentrism" has now become one of the utensils, amongst the multitude of many, that is used to demean and somehow nullify when a Black individual truly knows his/her history. When it comes to acknowledging that the Ancient Egyptians were Black, such notion is mitigated and struck by the label of "Afrocentrism", to denote that the historical belief the Black individual possesses is inaccurate and is simply that which belongs solely with that of psuedointellectuals. It is surprising in the sense that "Eurocentrism" is not thought of as a utensil to denote historical inaccuracy, but more so deemed as being the barometer of historical accuracy! <br>  <br>  The ownership of history ultimately gives rise to egoism and self-hatred. One party possessing the egoistic notions; the other with the self-concious ones. Guess who owns what.

6DmsiLGbaa	Maybe the people who started out on the Crusade honestly believed it was all for God, but of course it wasn't.  Why would God want all that suffering?  The Crusades and the Spanish Inquisition and all the rest were caused by man alone.  <br>  <br>  You mentioned free will.  Though I don't believe it's "free" since Christ suffered terribly on our behalf and since the choices one person makes can cause another great pain, all of the examples you mentioned were the results of agency exercised by man.  God allowed the Crusades for the same reason that He allows any of us to make choices for ourselves--so that we can learn.  The entire point of this life is for man to learn the difference between good and evil, to learn from our mistakes and the mistakes of others and then to one day return to God with that knowledge, having progressed both spiritually and emotionally.  If we never witnessed or encountered trials, if everything in our world was perfect and joyous, we would still be the spiritual equivalent of children, and there would have been no point in living at all.  Man alone is responsible for the choices we make, but in the end, everything does fulfill God's plan for us.  <br>  <br>  And I have no problem at all with organized religion.  The purpose of any faith is for the members to help and guide and strengthen each other, and while the Crusades are a very tragic example of this gone wrong, there were also political and economic factors involved.  Religion was only the excuse in those cases, not the cause, and for every person who suffered in the Crusades, how many more have benefited from the fellowship and love of other members of their faith?  Though I can understand where you're coming from, you're condemning the whole for the exception.  Organized religion is not the problem--only the choices a man makes in its name.|`|gxWYcxa3aa	Christians will fully say that these vicious, terrible christian-religion based 'holy wars' had nothing to do with religion at all.<br>  <br>  That's like a pagan saying that our religious ancestors didn't squabble over god differences.

So I can understand why you may be confused. but from what I gather, god knows what's going to happen in this world before it happens. In other words, he knew that the telephone would be invented and so on. God leads us to fulfill are destinies because he knows us so well and therefore lets say that he knows something dangerous is about to happen at a place that you like to go to. God doesn't want you to die, so he knows that you don't look where you're going when you walk and he puts a sharp nail in the place that he knows you need to walk by to get to the place you like to go. thus, you get hurt and cant go any further and the people at the place get shot.. We can do whatever we want to in our lives, but if god does not see fit for us to do a given thing, then it wont happen. So because of the tensions between the crusaders and their enemies and because the false beliefs that these jihad guys have, god knew that the crusades would happen and that these guys would start blowing themselves up. because he knows how humans work, but he doesn't actually "make" us do these things. I hope that helps|`|iXI7n6Gmaa	People plan and plot for many reasons and more multiplies intentions<br>  and God will let them do that but He will allow them to succeed in what His eternal pr emits<br>  <br>  The all the groups will gather in the day of Judgment to account for their actions each individual for why he agreed, joined and task he performed on the personal levels even for the intentions<br>  <br>  e.g. a martyr comes to God and please to say oh God I died for your cause and God would tell the Angels cast him into hell he is a liar, he fought for the honor of so and so, he fought out of hate and anger or he fought so people will say he is a hero, etc. Nothing works! no one can outsmart God.|`|Nglm1b1vaa	If you believe in gods will then free will doesn't exist, right?

It sounds like the homily was focused on the Lenten season, not on the specific issue of abortion or any other "political" matter so I doubt it was meant as any sort of serious reference to President Obama's policies; he is the president of the United States now, in case you didn't hear, by the way, and it is appropriate to address him as such, not just as "Obama".|`|AugnsMZ7aa	People will not agree to change or give up anything they like or want unless they have a belief in a reason to do so. <br>  <br>  The priest was asking people to recognize God and act according to Gods commandments. I think he was suspect of parishioners not having total belief and faith in God. <br>  <br>  The priests wisdom would dictate that the only way people could remove themselves from sin and change their ways would be to love God through renewed or new-found faith. Through belief in God, sacrifice becomes very desireable, or certainly less difficult.<br>  <br>  I really don't see how this ties to rhetoric of a politition whether he was good or evil. The words Change, Belief, etc have been used and abused through the centuries. I think the priest was coming from a completely different perspective.<br>  <br>  Surely we should never put the same degree of faith, belief or desire for change in another human beings hands as we would in God's hands. That would be worshipping false Gods'.

Maybe you just think they won't accept you if you tell them, but they're your parents. They should accept you for who you are, you shouldn't have to pretend to be something you're not around your own parents. Your almost 18, you're going to be able to make your own decisions later on. <br>  <br>  Expect them to be surprised at first when you tell them (which you should. Even if it's not right away, you still should tell them sooner or later). I mean, any parent would be surprised that they're child is gay/lesbian. But, they should understand that it's just who you are. It'd be setting a wrong example if they get prejudice on you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

The concept of the Trinity is apprehesible but not fully comprehensible.  Other attributes of God are like this as well, such as God's infinity.  We cannot fully comprehend the concept of a Being without beginning or end, but we can comprehend it.  In addition, only finite things have parts that add and detract.  If things could be added or detracted from God, He'd no longer be infinite (another tough concept).<br>  <br>  Gotquestions.org offers concise answers to questions about the Christian concept of God.

Not an exact translation but you get the idea.  They are the same but they are different.  You might say my mind says leave but my heart says stay and my feet won't go.  You are still one being with three pieces that make the whole.  Or maybe the way a man, woman and child make a family.  Of course God is not at odds with any of His pieces/parts.    <br>  <br>  <br>  Be advised you are trying to put reason around an entity that has the ability to take the power behind spoken words and turn them into a earthly being made of flesh that is why we have a heart, faith and spirit that tell us things are true or not true even when we don't understand why it is.   <br>  <br>  You know I can explain it to you in many different terms but all Christians all people say the exact sames things when they experience God and the sacrifice of Jesus for themselves, if you really want to know what it's about invite God to come into your life and show you.|`|KXQVRQdjaa	Technically speaking, Christianity is NOT monotheism.  It has nothing to do with the Trinity belief, because according to most Christians, the father, son, and holy spirit are three parts of one being, which is weird, but not completely unrealistic.  The church I went to as a child explained it as the fact that the membrane, yolk, and white are all part of the same thing, but different substances.<br>  <br>  However, monotheism is not the belief in one god, although the exact etymology translates as such.  It is defined anthropologically as the belief in only one **supernatural being**.  Because Christianity includes angels, demons, and the devil, anthropologists define Christianity as polytheism.<br>  <br>  But since most Christians would consider polytheistic an insult, whatever.  If they consider themselves monotheistic, it's all well and good.|`|DWJOMWQ8aa	God is made up of three persons in one being, sometimes called the Trinity: The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. <br>  <br>  Think of God as one person, but with three roles. Much in the same way as you are one person but have different roles such as daughter, wife, mother, or son, husband, father. <br>  <br>  Jesus is still God, but he is the Word made flesh (John 1:1). He came to earth to implement the plan of salvation. <br>  <br>  I could go more in depth, but it would probably take me pages to explain.

fE628A9xaa	Yes.  Religion is nothing more than an excuse to explain how certain people feel about real issues.  It warps the mind and deludes it from experiencing reality.  We don't need an imaginary friend to tell us what is right or wrong.  Let's stop using god(s) as a means to back up our stance on humanity.  Open your mind and then open your eyes!  Throw your god(s) in the garbage with the rest of the trash.=)  Only then can you discover your purpose in life and your responsibility to the future of our species.|`|KXQVRQdjaa	Nope.  It would be better without dogmatic, condemning, hellfire, hateful religion.  There are lots of religions that are very uplifting and good for people.  As long as all the religions teach knowledge, tolerance, and understanding for people who believe differently than they do, they can be very good and live side by side without warring, stealing the rights of others, and trying to form theocracies.  I hope someday the world will be filled with religious diversity (including Christians, who at the moment, in the US, are a big problem) and that that diversity will be seen as a good thing by everyone.  Unfortunately, a lot of religions have become bogged down with hate, but that really isn't the fault of the spiritualities themselves.  It's individual groups and people who pollute the religion.  The beliefs themselves can be great.  <br>  <br>  Let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater!|`|c0KKHMsAaa	better? maybe.<br>  <br>  but definitely different|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Yes. Religion and Christianity are not the same thing. Christianity was founded and begun by Jesus Himself. Religion is a man mad doctrine that has gone in many different directions in their beliefs, and doctrine, all claiming to be Gods doctrine when they are not. They all divided. and that is what God told man not to do.<br>  <br>   1 Corinthians 1:10 Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.|`|FRwaGpJaaa	No, then everyone wouldn't have an afterlife. It wouldn't be possible to have a world without religion because God has revealed himself to some and they truly believe.|`|Nglm1b1vaa	religion is a major factor in every war ever in history. No religion, no war. But also if there was no religion what other crutch would the weak pick up. It may be worse than religion.|`|P8CBDLiKaa	Yes, but I think we'd find something else to kill each other over; we're really not all that bright, as a species, when it comes to differences of opinion.|`|gTS6xTO4aa	well there are 2 different perspectives<br>  <br>  1. it would be better because lets face it religion has caused some of the worst conflcits in history.. so many lives have been lost because of religion.. and so has racism and discrimination<br>  <br>  <br>  2. but on the other hand religion gives hope to millions (maybe even billions) of people and actually gives them a reason to live. especially in poorer countries religion is literally their only hope. it gives them a community to be part of and inspires them to live good lives.<br>  <br>  so if you weigh it up and down.. i dunno. personally i think it probably wouldnt be better without religion.|`|7mxCMfYKaa	Yes.

There is absolutely, no way to determine the exact origin of our ancestors, since the beginning of existence.  We can most certainly speculate, assume and guess where we all came from, but even scientists, don't have a sure answer, to an otherwise, complex question.<br>  If you consider yourself a good, decent and humble enough person, then you can consider yourself a descendant of that same type of genealogy.  Possibly.  But if you look further, at your analogy of Cain and Able, you can definitely open a valid discussion of good and evil.  Using and comparing, both of these characters from the Biblical text.  Same mother and father.  Complete opposites.  They say that, "the apple doesn't fall to far from the tree from which it came."  By this, you can clearly see which son, took on the distinct characteristics of each parent.  Cain, more like Eve.  Able, more like Adam.  Very characteristic of even today's family comparison, of gene pool distribution.  You remember your mom, declaring when she was upset with you as a child, the very phrase.  "You're acting just like your father!"  Why do you suppose, parents sometimes make statements, such as these?  <br>  I guess the important, or relevant fact to acknowledge from your question, is that we are here, right now.  Living, breathing and existing in a world that only has grown quite significantly, from the past.  We are continuing to grow, towards the future, for which we were all born.  The only thing you should be confused about is what to do first about your very bright future.<br>  LIVE LIFE!  The Jian.|`|ZZcPCoGgaa	This is directly from the Bible:<br>  <br>  Genesis Chapter 4, Verse 17<br>  New International Version<br>  <br>  "Cain lay with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch.  Cain was then building a city, and he named it Enoch after his son Enoch.  To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.  Lemech married two women, one named Adah and the other named Zillah.  Adah gave bith to Jabal and Jubal.  Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain and a daughter named Naamah.  Adam lay with his wife again and she gave birth to a son named him Seth.  Seth had a son named Enosh."<br>  <br>  Now you have to be aware that people back then lived for an extremely long time.  Adam lived 930 years by himself.  The scripture says, "After Seth was born, Adam lived eight hundred years and had other sons and daughters."  <br>  <br>  Later in the chapter it says that Seth lived to be 912, in the meantime having 'other sons and daughters'.  Obviously 900 years gave you plenty of time to have kids.  So yes, Adam and Eve did populate the earth.  The distance between the family relationship was probably lost since everyone lived so long, much as it is today.  We are all related in some way since we all originated from Adam and Eve, so everyone you date is your distant distant distant distant (like extremely distant) cousin or something.  Plus God told them to populate the earth.  If God told you to do something, I would assume you would do it to the best of your ability.  Obviously they were only getting by with what they had.  These days, there is a lot more ancient cousins to choose from, who aren't so close.  Incest is wrong in every sense.<br>  <br>  I hope this cleared things up :)|`|TYmJXpFOaa	It also says they had another son after the killing. And it doesn't say that they had no other children, so they may have had more.|`|TOm0lawCaa	Or, the whole story is inherently incoherent, and evolution is responsible.|`|AA12302228	try read hansel and gretel it<br>  makes more sense|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Cain evidently took his sister with him when he was cast out of the garden.Adam and Eve had girls too. Seth was one of their sons and he was a righteous man.The son of Adam and Eve born when Adam was 130 years old. Eve named him Seth because, as she said, “God has appointed another seed in place of Abel, because Cain killed him.” Seth may not have been the third child of Adam and Eve. According to Genesis 5:4, Adam had “sons and daughters,” some of whom may have been born before Seth. Seth is worthy of note because Noah, and through him the present-day race of mankind, descended from him, not from the murderous Cain. At the age of 105 years Seth became father to Enosh. Seth died at the age of 912 years (3896-2984?B.C.E.).—Ge 4:17, 25,?26; 5:3-8; 1Ch 1:1-4; Lu 3:38.No that was not incest because that was God's command for them to be fruitful and fill the earth.They were so close to perfection at that point in time there was no problem with it.What does the Bible really teach?<a href="http://www.jw.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jw.org/</a>|`|AA11264399	Evolution.

Methinnks you haven't even made it through Sunday school, so how can you possibly assess this mammoth piece of writing.<br>  To come up with a more profound view you need to study the text. Exegetical reading of Scripture is how the clergy, educators, scholars or layman study the biblical text. This way of reading Scripture has as its goal understanding the meaning of the biblical text for the larger purpose of drawing theological, doctrinal, or homiletical conclusions from it. <br>  It involves using various methods of biblical study, such as: historical, cultural, and social backgrounds; the original languages; the history of interpretation; relating texts to the whole canon of Scripture; theological implications, etc. There are a variety of emphases in these methods, but most are aimed at understanding the theological message the text communicates. <br>  While not all Bible students agree on all these methods, or their results, there is a great deal of agreement about the basic principles, and about the boundaries of interpretation that arise from careful study (what the text can't mean).<br>  Theological and doctrinal positions are (usually) constructed from such deliberate and careful study of Scripture.

b9906294d88c8e875c10481120cf0286aa	I am surprised that not many Christians have answered this question. I am an ex Christian but the qualifier for a true miracle is the bible. True many Christians claim to have had miracles in their life but there has not been one verifiable miracle since the first century even then skeptics believe no miracles happened. A bible miracle is when God breaks his laws of nature to bring something about. Passing a math test is not a miracle. Winning a ball game is not a miracle.  Surviving a terrible crash or healing with a doctor is not a miracle.  As a Christian I knew the difference between the providence of God and a miracle.  A miracle is for example getting an arm cut off and growing a new one. According to the bible Jesus could make arms and legs grow anew. That is a miracle. When Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead after 4 days in the grave that was a miracle because God broke his laws of nature. Newborn babies are not miracles. Anytime someone experiences something good and if there was slim to no chance of it happening to them they call it a miracle but a true miracle is going against nature itself and if anyone claims a miracle but nature itself was not broken then it was not a bible miracle. <br>  <br>  I am a paranormal investigator and I actually started out investigating claims of miracles back in the 1970's I have investigated hundreds of claims and not one true miracle using the bible as the guide for a miracle.

Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. <br>  <br>   42Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. <br>  <br>   43Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. <br>  <br>   44Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do.

And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? <br>  <br>   47He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God. <br>  <br>   48Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? <br>  <br>   49Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. <br>  <br>   50And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth. <br>  <br>   51Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death. <br>  <br>   52Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil.

We believe that all who call upon the name of Jesus will be saved. We believe that through the power of His shed blood we can be cleansed from our sins.

Being baptized represents the death burial and resurrection with Jesus. We believe that the word baptize means to submerge or put under. We love because he first loved us and gave himself up for us, because He knows that the wages of sin is death.  Because of sin there must be a blood sacrifice. We believe that God in the form of a servant went to the Cross. For the gift of God is eternal life.|`|faceb0da83e7b433b86d3ae6836703f3aa	The Only Begotten Son of the Living God, the Father.  The Lamb of God without Blemish. The Resurrection & the Life.<br>  Jesus said, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me to preach the Gospel to the poor; He has sent me to heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them who are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. Luke4:18+<br>  <br>  Jesus used the 'I Am' a lot in the book of John.<br>  John5:43 I Am come in my Fathers Name, and ye receive me not; if another shall come in his own name, him ye shall receive.<br>  I Am the Bread of Life.<br>  I Am the Living Bread.<br>  I Am from the Father.<br>  I Am the Light of the World.<br>  I Am not alone, I and the Father Who sent me...<br>  I Am one who bears witness of myself and the Father who sent me bears witness of me.<br>  I Am from above.<br>  I Am not of this world.<br>  I Am, if you do not believe I Am, ye shall die in your sins.<br>  I Am before Abraham (Before Abraham was, I Am.)<br>  I Am the Light of the World as long as I Am in the world.<br>  I Am the door of the sheep.<br>  I Am the door.<br>  I Am the Good Shepherd.<br>  I Am the Resurrection & the Life: he who believes in me, though he dies, yet shall he live; And whosoever lives & believes in me shall never die. Believe thou this?<br>  I Am with my servants.<br>  I Am your Lord & Master & wash your feet. You should do likewise to one another.<br>  I Am the one who is betrayed, as scripture has said, 'he who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.'.<br>  I Am with you.<br>  Where I Am, there you may be also.<br>  I Am the Way, the Truth & the Life; no one comes to the Father, but by me. If ye had known me, you should have known my Father also: and from hennceforth ye know Him, and have seen Him.<br>  I Am in the Father and the Father is in Me.<br>  I Am the True Vine, & my Father is the husbandman.<br>  I Am the Vine and you are the branches.<br>  I Am not alone, because the Father is with me.<br>  I Am no more in the world (when suffering before the cross).<br>  I Am not of the world.<br>  I Am. (Jesus answered when they asked if He was Jesus of Nazareth.)<br>  <br>  When Pilate questioned Him, 'Are you a King then?..' Jesus answered, 'Thou say that I am a King. To this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the Truth. Everyone who is of the Truth hears my voice.'.<br>  <br>  I Am King of the Jews. (Pilot had this written above Jesus head on the cross. The accusation that Jesus said I Am.)<br>  <br>  Exodus 3:14; 20... And the LORD God told Moses... 'Tell them I Am that I Am sent you.'.<br>  I Am the Lord thy God one Lord.<br>  I Am the Yahweh thy Elohim Echad Yahweh.<br>  The Yahweh our Elohim is God the Father, Word & Holy Spirit.<br>  God the Father, Word & Holy Spirit is One Creator God.<br>  <br>  So Jesus left His place as the Word of God & came down and became one of us. Becoming lower than the Angels. He was the Only Begotten Son of God. Who did His Ministry as a man anointed by the Holy Spirit. And overcame the serpents temptation. He did His miracles by the Power of the Holy Spirit...  He is our example for when we receive Him as our Savior & atonement for our sins. And for when we are anointed by the Holy Spirit unto the Day of Redemption.<br>  <br>  Jesus had also said, 'The Father & I are One.'. His heart was always one with the Father. Because sin never separated Jesus heart from God.  Only did our sins separate His heart from the heart of God. That Jesus died of a broken heart.<br>  But since He was with out personal sin. The curse of sin & death couldn't keep Jesus in the grave. Jesus raised from the dead. For us. So us who believe in Him can raise up like He did.<br>  <br>  So I think that Jesus considered Himself the Son of God & Divine.<br>  <br>  <br>  After reading other answer...Jesus never said, "I Am Michael the Archangel..."<br>  It is written in Revelation that when Mary was about to give birth to Jesus, that Michael the Archangel and other warrior Angels fought with the big red dragon (satan) in the heavens. And the dragon & 1/3 of the angels fell from heaven.<br>  And this was an astronomical sign of Israel, the virgin birth & Jesus being conceived & born that was written in the sky at the time of Jesus conception & birth.<br>  I don't see how the Word is being Michael when He is being conceived in the womb of the virgin Mary.|`|usIma0vIaa	well yes I think he did since God is Jesus and Jesus is God.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB-IRa66oX0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB-IRa66o...</a>

Bad-breathed, with my hair all nappy.  I stomped up and turned off my alarm clock.  It was just a normal morning.  It was just a normal day in front of me.  Then, my mother called me to her room.  <br>  <br>  My sister was there too, and my mother told me that my own grandmother just passed away.  I cried and cried until i couldn't even stand to keep my eyes open.  I prayed to her to please somehow tell me that she is happy wherever she was.  I closed my eyes and fell asleep.  I dreamt that she was sitting on a couch in my dream,and she was extremely young.  She was sitting with my grandpa who had passed away a while ago, and he was young too.  They were laughing and talking and hugging eachother, like that they haven't seen eachother in a long time.  My grandpa was young too, in the dream.  <br>  <br>  When I woke up, I had realized that I had never even seen my grandpa when he was young.  I remembered how he looked from the dream.  He had a black leather coat and jeans.  I looked through our old pictures to try to find an old picture of my grandpa around the age that he was at in my dream.  a picture was lying on top of the picture case, and I had never seen it before.  And there were my grandpa and grandma, just as in my dream.  I had never seen teh picture before, and had never seen my grandpa at that age, but somehow I dreamt it. <br>  <br>  I do believe that my grandma entered my dream so that she could somehow tell me that she was with her long lost husband now.|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	I lived in a nice house in a ritzy neighborhood.There was a sunken living room off the kitchen and my girlfriend and I would be watching tv and the refrigerator which had an ice and water dispenser in the door would just start dumping ice as if someone was holding the handle down.(Never found a problem with it).Cabinet doors would start opening and closing,the door to the garage off the kitchen would open and close.This happened about 4 times in six months.I talked to a local man who had lived there all his life and he told me that this subdivision was built on an old indian burial ground and other people in the subdivision had similar happenings.Then I found out that this house had belonged to a doctor,who had it built and he only lived there for a year and sold it because of the encounters.Also I was renting this house and several previous tenants had moved out for the same reason even breaking their lease.<br>  <br>  TRUE STORY----it's a subdivision in Richmond Texas.<br>  The funny thing is that all of the activity seemed to be in the kitchen.|`|k8Emqid7aa	About a year ago, I was sleeping in my bedroom.

No one there.

So I'm guessing they're going to talk to their pervert friends about the woman they took pictures of that day.  I don't think there is much you can do.  If they come back you can ask them to leave.  If you have a manager on premise, you can ask him/her to intercede.  If you work in a mall you could maybe talk to mall security, they'd may be on camera themselves (secuity cam) and maybe they could keep an eye out for them.  Obviously if they come back and make you feel uncomfortable, you can phone the police/911.  You could also ask your local police force if there are any anti-voyer laws in your city.|`|kX0T1urdaa	This is going on everywhere. It is a real invasion of privacy.

I have prayed for you as I write this. <br>  <br>  hp 4:6  Never worry about anything, but in every situation let your petitions be made known to God in prayers and requests, with thanksgiving. <br>  Php 4:7  Then God's peace, which goes far beyond anything we can imagine, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. <br>  Php 4:8  Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is fair, whatever is pure, whatever is acceptable, whatever is commendable, if there is anything of excellence and if there is anything praiseworthy-keep thinking about these things.
ejFbnhU5aa	Well, the devil use to be the closest angel to God, and in the Bible, it says that he was crated in such perfection and beauty, that he eventually became so full of pride he got booted out of heaven. So, now that he's in hell, I'd expect Lucifer to look like the complete opposite of perfection and beauty. But since he was too powerful to be killed by Arc Angel Michael, I'd expect Lucifer to look pretty much the same, but in a more morbid and gothic style. A sorta deadly, sinful look. Toxic beauty. (seriously, just look at this statue <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Lucifer_Liege_Luc_Viatour_new.jpg/250px-Lucifer_Liege_Luc_Viatour_new.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a> )|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	If you mean Lucifer, the bible describes him in the book Ezekiel.

0lnamekJaa	Yes and no...<br>  <br>  A MAJORITY of "Ghost" etc. are just seeing things... Hearing things... Misinterpreting things...<br>  <br>  BUT<br>  <br>  I will not rule out the chance that there is a creature, an animal; something NATURAL that we just can't detect that may cause some of the physical things that are caught on tape.<br>  <br>  We humans have VERY limited senses... There is the chance that there are creatures that we can't currently detect that play some roll in nature that we are just not currently aware of. <br>  <br>  One of the things that I was SO HAPPY to see when I watched a few episodes of Sci-Fi Channel's show "Ghost Hunters" is that they KNOW that some things cause humans to see, hear, and feel strange sh*t but have a perfectly natural explanation...<br>  <br>  There was one episode where a guy said that there was a "Ghost" that was causing him depression and mood disorders and would cause strange sounds and feelings in the basement of his home...<br>  <br>  The two head guys (the bald guy and the dark haired guy) went in to the basement and looked at how the house was built and designed... <br>  <br>  They took out tools and realized that the electrical system was almost dangerous in it's design and that the readings on the Electromagnetic Field Detector (I don't remember what it is called) showed that the main electrical box was throwing off HUGE amounts of energy which were being spread around by the pipes and wires... <br>  <br>  They said "Get an electrician in here... Fix that before you have a fire... And most of your problems will go away."<br>  <br>  They felt 'strange' when they went down the stairs but didn't jump to "I feel like I'm being watched, therefore there is a ghost watching me."<br>  <br>  They not only found a logical and reasonable reason for what was happening, they also may have saved the guy from having an electrical fire in his home.|`|d3VV4b6vaa	I don't believe that at all.

How do we see a human face in that bunch of punctuation?<br>  We can make a human face out of almost anything.<br>  So if we think that we see a ghost or something else paranormal, that can just be our minds trying to find another human shape.<br>  Same thing if we hear something, we can take any sound and try to make it into some word.<br>  The human thing is an amazing thing, isn't it?|`|uVL1kJr4aa	they actually can and an example of that could be sleep paralysis. i wouldnt say that fear of death has something to do with it entirely.|`|hzoUwZGiaa	That makes sense....you are probably right there..of course its in your mind.

Really? Come to a heavy metal festival with me and I'll show you one atheist who cares very much about something other than science.

What the hell are you on about? Have you ever actually encountered anyone *that* sceptical? Enough that you can make this claim about all atheists? Plenty of atheists aren't sceptical about issues that *are* spiritual - lack of belief in deities doesn't automatically mean we believe nothing at all, and to make the assumption that it does is just ignorant.|`|1WisnX8naa	The only thing atheists are apathetic about is the existence of gods...<br>  <br>  nothing more or less. beyond that, it depends on the person, so your rant made no sense...<br>  <br>  I happen to know I love my wife and children and they love me.

hceNM6Uxaa	Actually, people WON'T know by looking that you're not Jewish.  Jews come from every ethnic background.  There is a big community of Indian Jews, for example.  So while it isn't wrong for you to wear a Star of David, it IS confusing to other people.  I've had the experience of assuming that someone wearing a Mogen David was Jewish and was frankly embarrassed to realise she wasn't.  I never did quite understand, in her case, why she chose to do so.<br>  <br>  I think there might be better ways of supporting Jewish people - which is a wonderful sentiment to hear, by the way, I'm not trying to put you off!!  Speaking out when people are being nasty about Jews would be a really valuable contribution, and to be honest that would be of more value to us than your wearing a Mogen David.  Going along to Jewish events to support them might be good - or go and ask your local synagogue if there is anything they would particularly appreciate from a non-Jew.|`|Ji1DVABtaa	I would suggest you learn something about the Jewish religion AND its people since all Jews do not "look" a certain way.  And you don't wear a symbol to show support.  You support by either participating or volunteering your time to causes important to that religion.|`|d78420f6881261db90170d41d16536a0aa	I don't think most Jews would mind unless you're trying hijack Judaism by posing as a "Christian Jew."|`|TVJsOEKNaa	There are Asian Jews (along with Jewish people of all races), and nope: Wouldn't be a problem.|`|425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	Judaism isn't a race, so anyone could be Asian and Jewish. I went to uni with a couple of Asian Jews, one a 2nd generation convert, the other farther back.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, Jewish symbols have been co-opted by certain groups who are Christian in their beliefs (Jesus as Messiah, salvation, hell, etc.) but insist that they have the right to call themselves Jews. Part of their agenda is to convert all Jews to Christianity (belief in Jesus), the upshot of that would of course be the end of Judaism.<br>  <br>  So, however well intentioned your support might be, if you were to wear a Star of David right now, you would unintentionally be giving your support to those groups. If you want to help us, please learn more about these groups and teach other Christians. And please, don't wear a Star. It will only be misinterpreted by those who wish us harm.|`|DTog0VZWaa	Here's another idea.  The HAS advantage charge card, puts out a card that has a picture of the Israeli & American flag.  When shopping this would give you a chance to say you support Israel.  Also a small portion of sales goes to charities in Israel.  It's a Visa card issued by USBank.  You also get 1% back on your purchases.<br>  <br>  If you can find a way to wear a star, while making it clear you are Catholic such as wearing a cross separately too or finding a symbol from one of the Christian organizations that support Israel that would be great.  I wouldn't wear a combined cross & star because that's messanic & they aren't supportive of Judaism (unless it's to convert us to christian beliefs with manipulative tatics.)<br>  <br>  Being Asian as others have said, wouldn't tell anyone you're not Jewish.  My mom just sold a Tallit to a lovely adopted Asian girl...   For sales sites, I like this one <a href="http://www.genesis-gallery.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.genesis-gallery.com</a> (I do the web support for the owners & all products are purchased in Israel.)<br>  <br>  PS Letting people know that as a non-Jewish person you support us & Israel, is very meaningful to us...|`|kX0T1urdaa	I'm not Jewish and I wear one. I have two necklaces that are stars of David. I got one from a magazine that IFCJ puts out. International Fellowship of Christians and Jews. It is headed up by Rabbi Eckstein.

tbeO3Lataa	I have a good perspective here, because my mother is Jewish, my father is Christian, and they went through the same thing.<br>  <br>  This is what I would recommend - Choose a religion you would like your child to grow up in until they are old enough to decide for themselves. Once they are old enough to do so, let them choose, and as hard as it is, try not to stand in their way.<br>  <br>  You could always raise them in both!

Why not let them go to services with both of you? Whenever Dad goes to Mosque, the kids go with him and whenever you go to Church, the kids go with you. That way they'll have an understanding of both faiths and can make their minds up about which to follow when they're older. That's what I'm going to do with my hypothetical children.|`|5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	It is very dangerous for a Christian to marry someone who has not made a heart and life commitment to Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord. <br>  <br>  To be ready for marriage spiritually means, first of all, that both individuals have accepted Christ and eagerly intend to make Christ the Head of their home. To consider marriage without the possibility of spiritual agreement is to invite argument and unhappiness into the future household. <br>  I would not guarantee that with becoming a Christian, the whole problem of marriage and the home is automatically solved. But I do say that complete fulfillment in marriage can never be realized outside of the life of Christ. ... I would advise every couple planning to establish a home to first come to a complete agreement on their religious faith." Amos 3:3 states: "Can two walk together, except they be agreed?" <br>  God ordained marriage to be a "perfect triangle"—God, you, and your spouse. The closer each marriage partner lives to God, the closer each will live to the other. Such closeness is impossible when one spouse does not have a personal relationship with God. <br>  <br>  This is the reason the Bible says we should not be unequally yoked; read 2 Corinthians 6:14-15. The apostle Paul applies this principle in the case of widows when he writes, "But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord" (1 Corinthians 7:39b).|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	Decide if having children is more important than having them grow up in your religion.|`|2ogimlBxaa	Why don't you just let your children decide for themselves when they're of age?|`|ab406a9a5d69ca0d2cc95e30217f543aaa	That's a very important question.<br>  <br>  Talk to his clergy and talk to your clergy.<br>  <br>  I admire people who decide to have kids. So much responsibility!<br>  <br>  You want to do the right thing, that's admirable.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

UinOWcMUaa	There is no such thing as being born gay :( If they were born gay, then it wouldn't be such a hard thing coming out... and well majority of those who are gay have expereinced some form of sexual abuse :)<br>  <br>  William C. Holmes, MD, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, and Gail B. Slap, MD, Associate Chair of Pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, in their 1998 Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) article "Sexual Abuse of Boys," stated:<br>  "Sexual abuse of boys appears to be common, underreported, underrecognized, and undertreated... <br>  <br>  Abused [male] adolescents, particularly those victimized by males, were up to 7 times more likely to self-identify as gay or bisexual than peers who had not been abused. No longitudinal studies examined the causal relationship between abuse and gender role or sexual orientation, however. Gender role nonconformity and gay or bisexual identity may precede abuse."|`|AA11264399	"Abused adolescents, particularly those victimized by males, were up to 7 times more likely to self-identify as gay or bisexual than peers who had not been abused (P<.001).83-84 No longitudinal studies examined the causal relationship between abuse and gender role or sexual orientation, however.

The vast majority of gay people were never molested. I certainly wasn't. And of the hundreds of gay men I know, only one was, and he knew he was gay before it happened.<br>  <br>  Since most pedophiles are male, those being molested would have had male molesters. So if being molested by a man makes another man become gay, does being molested by a man make another woman straight? Or does it make her become a lesbian? You see, your theory is full of holes and won't hold water. Sexuality is innate. It is neither chosen, nor caused by events during childhood.|`|ocy7FEcaaa	These studies do not have anything to do with the fact that some people are born gay.

But maybe incidents in childhood or youth have a powerful influence.<br>  <br>  Maybe if I'd have been raped by a woman at the age of 16 I would have turned out straight.<br>  <br>  Who can tell?

I'm bisexual, but my parents have been together since high school, and have been married for 25 years. They've never needed any marriage counseling or anything like that, and I have never been sexually abused. Think about this, I like guys and girls, the same way a heterosexual male might like both blonde and brunette girls. I was not born bisexual, but my sexual attraction towards people developed during puberty, the same way your's did. Sure, there may be some boys who are sexually abused by men who turn out to be gay or bisexual, but what about the boys who turn out to be heterosexual after being sexually abused by a male? I think either way, the boys who are abused by men and turn out to be gay or bisexual, would've still been gay or bisexual even if they weren't sexually abused. There's even been scientific studies that have proven that in the natural world, there are homosexual and bisexual acts with several different animals. What more do you need? If you're having trouble just accepting LGBTs, then put it this way. You know what happens after you die? You're going to rot in the ground, and people are going to keep on living without you. Whether or not there is a heaven and/or hell is regardless. But the point is, life is short, and if you want to continue living it debating online about whether or not homosexuals are born with their orientation, then be my guest, but you're just wasting your time.|`|sVkBdQ28aa	It's a lot more complicated than that. Homosexuality is in the brain; scans have proved this. Studies can show an effect, but wrong conclusions can be drawn from it. From your study, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that, for whatever reason, they begin to think that they're gay.

The older people are usually happy to talk, and can usually be found in the beer gardens in summer and in the cafes in winter. Just be friendly and I am sure you will get your share of German conversation!|`|lShJ6S8saa	Well, I'm from Germany and we often have exchange students at our school.

I also studied German and spent a year over there as part of my course. It was difficult at first because I wasn't confident in my German and everyone was willing to speak English to me. <br>  <br>  But, I worked for a German company and shared a place with two Germans. In the end, the only time I spoke English was when I phoned home once a week. <br>  <br>  Generally speaking, the German people are delighted that you are making an effort to speak their language. As long as you try, you will get to speak German. If someone answers you in English, reply in German. If they continue to do it, ask them politely if they will allow you to speak German so that you can practice the language. I don't think you'll have too many problems.
YOt6uTSzaa	*GIGGLING MUCH* ....<br>  <br>  No one knows the time or the hour, take heed and stay stead fast in His love........|`|355JLlcLaa	The second coming seems to have at least some of its origin in reading back later beliefs into Old Testament scripture. <br>  <br>  Isaiah seems to have been quoted by New Testament writers as applying to Jesus' second coming, but Isaiah wouldn't have been writing about Jesus. To him, God is One and "there is none else". I suspect that if anyone suggested that God had a son or that there were three persons within Him, Isaiah would have thought that blasphemy. He could not have been writing about Christ.<br>  <br>  In Romans, Paul has probably quoted Isaiah in his epistle, and adapted it to show that Christ is the judge of mankind, and that men should leave that judgement to Him. This is something that is quite common in scriptures, and the way many interpret them even now. They re-interpret scripture to fit current beliefs that the original author or prophet could not have meant. An example of this is in Revelation, when John identifies the great dragon (derived by the Jews from Babylonian myth) with the serpent in Eden and Satan; if you read the Genesis story and the Book of Job, you will see that these were not identified with each other and weren't intended to be; the stories were re-interpreted to fit the beliefs current in the 1st century.<br>  <br>  In Philippians, Paul has claimed that Jesus is the Lord, again reading back into Isaiah something that Isaiah couldn't have meant.<br>  <br>  John, in Revelation 1:7, makes the second coming of Christ unmissable, and he talks about Christ being seen even by those who pierced him, implying that Christ's second coming was expected within the lifetimes of those living when the letters of Revelation were written. The rest of Revelation talks about expectations of the time, like the imminent fall of Rome (the whore of Babylon) and of the Beast (Emperor Nero); another prophecy that didn't materialise in the expected time frame.<br>  <br>  So the expectation of the second coming of Christ was in the late 1st century or early 2nd century. But this didn't happen, and believers have tried to re-interpret when this would happen - for example, the Millerites. Some even try to interpret that the Fiirst World War was foretold by Revelation, and that we are now in the end times; no doubt, this will again be re-interpreted when iit doesn't happen.<br>  <br>  To me, the scripture refers to expectations held at the time they were written. Reading changed beliefs back into older scripture seems contrived.|`|fjidmhxsaa	Absolutely not.<br>  <br>  God's Ways are Not Our Ways <br>  Isaiah 55:8-9<br>  1.

Your body ceases to function in any way other than to decompose (unless man interferes by means of cremation).  Decomposition is natural.  It is just a way of transferring energy and matter into a different physical arrangement of atoms, as is cremation (1st law of thermodynamics).

It is earned by showing up on time, listening intently, displaying a solid work ethic, and being thorough in all that you do on a daily basis. <br>   Respect is also earned by going above and beyond what is expected of you without expectation of anything in return for doing it. This also means that you shouldn’t stand around bitching, complaining, and making statements such as, “That’s not my job.” It means that occasionally you will have to perform duties that are outside your scope of responsibility. <br>   During this age of the entitlement there is a common - lack respect for others yet expectations of respect from peers.  o_O|`|8Nqq7tkwaa	i think you just about gave the perfect example of why people hate america (not necessarily american people).<br>  <br>  you are quick to claim all the good things that supposedly come from america and forget that the scientists and engineers etc that worked together on these things, came from all over the world. <br>  <br>  americans think they are some bastion of charity and good will, while ignoring the ugly facts of wars and setting up dictatorships even within their own borders (oneida nation). <br>  <br>  and while the rest of the world knows quite a bit about usa, americans in general know very little about other countries. actually many know very little about america too. so while not all americans are fat, lazy, arrogant and stupid, there are enough of them to promote the stereotype.<br>  <br>  americans need to learn a bit of humility, admit their shortcomings and be willing to give others credit where it's due. enough of the "usa is the best country in the world" crap.|`|xfm2LVTTaa	Immigrants don't respect America at all, they come to apply for welfare, and to have kid after kid so the amount on that welfare check increases.|`|26e0b0c65ed49aa633c795f53d072963aa	I think is a matter of envy and jealousy.the world simply envy America<br>  because it has what they lack.prosperity and wealthiness.now,the fact that America is such a great place to live that doesn't mean it's better than other countries which is the idea that people have in their mind.|`|QobOFiCLaa	Not all of them hate America, my aunt is an immigrant and has lived here for decades now, payed taxes, etc.<br>   <br>  I think other people who poke fun at America are doing so because everyone else is doing it.

That they're rude, cowards, anti-american. There are plenty of people in America who honestly believe that so it's not surprising to me that many people elsewhere in the world how think America is a cesspool. It's what they're told to believe by friends, news, politicians, etc. Most people rarely ever think for themselves.

I then used this to learn learn words based on what I already knew. For example:<br>  <br>  Basically, the way to say "it is/am/are" is "desu" (the french, "c'est" pretty much). If a character says, "Kaze desu."  and the subtitles say, "It's the wind." I know the word "the" is not in the japanese language. That leaves "It's wind." I know that it's is "desu." Therefore, wind must be kaze.<br>  (eventualy the thought process becomes second nature, so it only takes a matter of seconds)<br>  Unfortunately, the problem with this technique is you rarely learn words that are really important.

hceNM6Uxaa	I think you need to define what you mean.  At my UK Reform synagogue, a bar or bat mitzvah often involves the young person taking the Shabbat morning service with the rabbi, including reading from the Torah scroll.  So the service is about 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours long.  After that we make kiddush and there may be a special kiddush, sometimes even followed by a sit-down lunch, as part of the celebrations.  Usually, there is an evening party as well.  So it really depends what you're referring to.  The service on its own, 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours.|`|4GiIXWUXaa	LOL It's "Bar Mitzvah"  and it really depends; anywhere from an hour to about three.<br>  <br>  how fast can your friend read and speak hebrew so you can get to the party? THAT's how long!! <br>  <br>  xoxo ?<br>  <br>  EDIT: *dang my slow typing!* there was one answer when i started! *drat!* lol|`|AJr98ZReaa	It indeed depends. Whats on the itinerary? Is it just a torah reading? Maybe just Haftorah? Or is there a kiddush after it? A meal at the birthday boys house? Maybe even a whole party the following sunday?|`|8I9uduIiaa	Do you mean a bar mitzvah...?<br>  <br>  The Synagogue service would be about an hour to two hours.<br>  <br>  The lunch or party afterwards will be a couple of hours.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://jewishanswerstochristianquestions.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://jewishanswerstochristianquestions...</a>|`|gYmQSIaZaa	okay, first of all, its "bar mitzvah"<br>  <br>  and second, it depends, if its a reform ceremony not long at all<br>  <br>  if its conservative, maybe an hour<br>  <br>  if its orthodox, a few hours (but they are lots of fun)|`|LBqDQNFSaa	Try spelling it correctly first.
EWR01atlaa	you should probably ask your parents who lived in the house before you. If the ghosts wanted to talk to you they would. Do NOT make a ouijia board! That is dangerous, don't do it inside if you MUST do it. But you don't know if they are evil or good. And you certainly don't want to be talking to evil spirits. Just hope they can't read! :) haha anyways.. it's not that unusual to see ghosts in a new house. Maybe you should try and figure out why they are haunting the house. Do some research or something. Talk to your parents. Of course don't go up and say ''Mom, dad, i see ghosts'' that would land you a spot at the hospital. But just ask them questions about the old people who used to live there. When you find stuff out email me. I'd be glad to tell and help you more! =)<br>  -M-|`|2fJJMJBAaa	first of all i do believe you and i think that you shouldn't try to communicate through the Ouija unless you want trouble. you should try talking to them i know it sounds creepy and weird but what else? or your other option is to just let them be i mean is not like they are bugging you maybe they don't even notice you so why should you? just try to ignore, and as long as they don't harm you is all good.|`|UJO8EUPGaa	If this is true, the spirits might be mad cause they think your invading their house.  And if you use an Ouija board, don't ask when your going to die, because bad things happen when you ask that.|`|2s7V2wSPaa	You should consider a psychiatrist.|`|NDwpLGHNaa	i would strongly recommend staying away from a ouija board. not only am i terrified of them. but once you own one you can get rid of it. you have to give it back to the person who either sold it to you or gave it to you. as long as the ghosts arent doing nething harmful u should be fine. if its that bad tell your parents or ask them if they have seen ne thing if they have, have the house blessed.|`|nqLGVMicaa	First: this really very interesting. I don't know what I would do, I think I'd be very scared. Well, that thing with the ouija is a bit risky, I guess. When I was younger, I sometimes made something similar to that with a glass and a circle of letters (don't know how you call it, in Germany we call it like "glass shifting"). It was a bit scary, but we could be very sure that there was nothing real about it. It seemed that there was always someone who moved the glass. But like this, with actually seeing ghosts and hearing them, I would not have the guts. Try talking to them, but don't do anything risky. Do you think that they know you can see them? Or do you think that they would be scared if you talked to them? Do they remind you of people or do you think they are something...well, beyond? How do you feel with them in the house where you live???|`|C8Dk5hGiaa	I love stories like this. But don't use the ouijia board that's really bad. Try to talk to the ghost ask why they are there. What do they need or if they need help. Ask your mom and dad questions if you have some. Or you could try to go to this web site I always go to. Its called WWW.YOURGHOSTSTORIES.COM. You can post stories like that. But you have to make an account to do that. But if you want to ask there too. Hopefuly this helps you out. I have had some paranormal experiences too.|`|26LZAOWraa	I would stay under the bed every night until the morning comes to dawn. For now, if under the bed scares you too much to be frightenment.

S8pIwxpwaa	What happens? You will either get caught prior to walking out the door, of you'll get away with it.<br>  <br>  If you get caught, you can easily be charged with theft. Chances are though, they'll give you a chance to pay the full amount and then ban you from the restaurant.<br>  <br>  If you don't get caught, the restaurant will lose the money they spent buying your food, paying people to deliver it to them, paying people to prepare the food, and paying the server, maitre d, and managers to take your order and serve it. Basically, you'd be screwing over a lot of people who work hard for the pay that they get.|`|abT0o6hHaa	I think they will hold your credit card number or somthing|`|aa376eb750675ff77dcfb63ac715c201aa	Unfortunately the waiter who served you gets the amount taken from their pay check (at most restaurants any way).  So pay your stupid bill or don't go out!!|`|9jiqylzRaa	I've done it before.  The waitress serving us was absolutely rude to my friends, gave us slow service and ignored us for the rest of the night.  If that's not a biznotch that deserves to have a table walk out on her I don't know what is.  So yeah, we left her a couple of pennies by the check and hit the door.  Actually, we bolted towards the door...then sprinted to the car lol.<br>  <br>  Do I regret it?  No.  But I wouldn't advise it to anyone.  Getting caught isn't worth it.  I think for now on I'll just speak with a manager about a server rather than basically banning myself from the restaurant.  Which is basically what we did considering we won't ever go back.<br>  <br>  Oh well...you live, you learn...|`|yjvv5bDjaa	i'm a waiter. <br>  <br>  we let them go. <br>  <br>  nothing you can do about it. <br>  <br>  the son of a ***** had two kids, too. bastard|`|NzIywCkpaa	i don't know|`|3sZSkepVaa	You'll probably end up paying some way.

pMFLqU0Yaa	The US military uses the DLAB to test your potential for learning a new language. They take your score on the DLAB and then consider your native language as well, to determine if you would be better suited to a level 1 language for native english speakers (the easiest for you to learn) or something more difficult for a native english speaker all the way up to level 4 languages. <br>  <br>  The DLAB has a total of 126 questions and your score indicates which language would be easiest for you to learn as a native english speaker.  The score and language level breakdown goes like this:<br>  <br>  * 85 for a Category I language (Dutch, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish)<br>  * 90 for a Category II language (German)<br>  * 95 for a Category III language (Belorussian, Czech, Greek, Hebrew, Persian, Polish, Russian, Serbian/Croatian, Slovak, Tagalog [Filipino], Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese)<br>  * 100 for a Category IV language (Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) <br>  <br>  If you don't feel like joining the military (but you should, you know) you can find books on the DLAB at most public libraries and have someone help you take the test. Some books also will let you self test.  That will give you a good idea of what language(s) would be viable options for you to learn and obtain some degree of fluency.

But many Mormons believe that the Curse of Cain Doctrine/Priesthood-Ban Policy was official repudiated on April 1st, 2006, by Gordon B. Hinckley: then President of the Mormon Church.|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	Interesting that those who are not Mormon who have responded to you, seem to know more than Mormons who have been members their whole lives.  Seems pretty arrogant to me, to claim that you know more than someone else.<br>  <br>  Can I tell you what you believe and make it fair?<br>  <br>  Additionally, some one claimed that "those over 50" used to believe this and this about blacks....  Guess what? The entire country had certain prejudices back then.<br>  <br>  Mormons have always given kindnesses and generosity to blacks. Blacks have ALWAYS been members of the LDS Church, since the 1830's when it was organized.   Mormons have supported numerous welfare programs in many black African countries, including utility construction, medical care, and other programs.  What have many of our critics done lately in that regard?  <br>  <br>  If you want to know what the church feels about blacks, seek an unbiased source like here:  <a href="http://www/blacklds.org" rel="nofollow">http://www/blacklds.org</a>   It will tell you what Mormons believe.<br>  <br>  Finally, it is so awesome that some think that the Mormons have so much power.  I only wish it were so.   Mormons were only 2% if the vote for Prop 8, MEANING that many other people voted for it.  It is a delusion and an illusion to think that Mormons were the reason for the outcome.    But, if you think we have that much power, so be it.|`|AA11359317	I don't believe it was a curse.

XbFEFJsgaa	I dont know why she hate gays/bi, i use to be that way and i dont even know why. I think since thats not how i was then anyone who isnt like me is wrong. but i have learned that no one is the same, that would be boring. Sounds like you may be hoping that she likes you deep down but hides those feelings by putting gay people down. I wouldnt get wrapped up in thinking she likes you. the best thing you can do is talk to her about how you dont want to lose her in your life as just a friend or anything else. If she still avoids you and makes rude comments then please dont be so hard on your self and get over her, there are plenty of people out there that would be happy to be close to you no matter your sexuality. basically let her go and if she comes back then shes a true friend, if not move on.|`|PeNTl6KOaa	leave her have time to get used to the fact ur bi<br>  <br>  x|`|a457e9a42af7d95c857ddbcfefd4f337aa	First of all, I don't think she's really your friend.

They're too negative! Dump her and find some true friends that you can be yourself with and relax.|`|wOburhzwaa	Give her time and space to think about it.

Didn't you ASK her if she would hate you if you were bi and she said, "YES"?  Sounds like you had fair warning.  You had every right to tell her, but now don't be surprised if you lost a friend.  If I were you though, I'd ask for clarification on her feelings before writing off the relationship forever.  <br>  <br>  Also, If by "religious" you mean "Christian", please don't make sweeping judgements.  Only some are haters or bigoted and they are not following the teachings of Jesus Christ by being that way.|`|dRzfqYu7aa	Hmm...<br>  i think she just needs some time.<br>  <br>  one of my best guy friends just came out, and at first his brother was acting just like your friend. but, as time went on, he gradually became totally cool with it. your friend may be a little bit shocked/ unsure how to react...and i find that in many cases, when someone isn't sure how to react to something, they react negatively.<br>  <br>  don't worry. she'll come around :)

Then the age of which they become an inconvenience will become younger and younger.  Man is evil and wicked for the most part.  Porno is the most popular and wealthiest business in the whole world. Children are being drenched in gasoline and ignited.  Or young children are being sexually assaulted by their mothers or fathers.  The world is insane. This system will soon come to an end.

Wwgobzjaaa	I think that when you are in the comfort of your own home you should go barefoot if that is what you like.

tYqUutidaa	Language of the Werewolves. Werewolves are able to speak wolfish (the language by which wolves communicate) and mannish according to what they were raised with. In the height of Werewolf culture, all werewolves spoke wolfish, mannish and a third unique language that was the tongue of werewolves. It is mostly a spoken (out loud) tongue but also incorporates some of the body gestures of wolfish. It is speakable in any form between wolf and man. Outside hearers of this language describe it as a guttural growling and snarling that still resembles a language of man in some ways. (Having a pattern recognizable to the human ear as "speech.") Lately, however, most werewolves speak mannish or wolfish according to the shape they keep most often, and have lost the werewolf language entirely|`|CSysSbnlaa	I don't think they can talk in wolf form. They talk in human form, but they can't talk as wolves. I think they make signs instead. They aren't connected by thoughts, that's just b.s. They probably make signs in the sand and stuff. I have a lycan brother but I don't like to be around him. I've always wanted to be a were something. Do you think there's a werebird? I mean there's a werewolf and a werecat so what if there's a werebird? That'd be awesome. But yeah, they probably make signs to others. Hope this helped!

IcDYEf3Naa	When I was younger, I lived in West Virginia. At the time, I was about 3 or 4. I used to talk to an invisible person (says my mom), but she was very real to me. I used to talk to her about anything and everything, and she used to turn on our washer (which wasn't plugged into the wall) to show she knew I was talking to her.<br>  I called her Annie, and we found out years later (after we had moved away) that there was in fact a house maid who lived there called, you guessed it, Annie.<br>  She was a really nice ghost; she never really caused much trouble. Once in a while, my three cats would run around, scared of something invisible. She used to close screen doors on my dad and he would walk through them, close our kitchen cabinets when we left them open. She seemed very protective. We think she stayed behind to look after the house she grew up and served in.<br>  <br>  More recently, my deceased cat Zena has taken to visiting me in the wee hours of the morning. Usually sround 330 or 400 am, I can feel her jump up on my bed and lay down.<br>  It's very comforting to know she is still around, because she was one of my favorite cats.|`|xFFZ0rH7aa	Yes. I lived in an old house in Shelbyville Tennessee that was called wolf meadows. It was originally a plantation then in later years it was an asylum for insane people.There are stories that the man who ran the asylum would chain the inmates to the trees and leave them. I do know there were chains attached to walls of the basement and the doors in the house would open and slam by themselves and the lights would turn on and off all night long.After my father found out that the old man who lived there before us went crazy we moved.|`|9obyO79raa	Yeah, doors slammed on their own when there was no one else there and no air flow, saw red running down the wall, dark hallway would deepen and expand, cats screaming when there weren't any cats there, something always standing behind me, wierd scratches, cold touching my arms, dark figure coming through the wall and sitting on me at night|`|NuPcpR8Haa	yes, have lived in haunted pub, also me my mum an dad have a ghost who seems to flit from one to the other, we think cos we have all moved homes lately the poor thing doesn't no were he wants to be, ha ha. doesn't seem to particularly like me mum tho ha ha|`|t8vabQZwaa	I have felt my bed shift as if someone was sitting on it or if a cat jumped on it.

(My mom calling me or something and I didn’t know) But as for my bed shifting, I have a cat so it could easy be her, but a lot of times I have my door shut and she’s not in the room.|`|RwMnZyOFaa	no, but i would LOVE to!!  i have my own paranormal investigation group, and the whole thought of living in a 'haunted house' would be awesome . . .|`|xETCO0rUaa	I slept in a haunted hotel room all by myself when i was 12. well my parents were down the hall but it was still really scary.

oXCo6VX4aa	I'm not sure exactly when they started using it since sometimes patents come out later than the actual invention but by the 1880's they were using a "mosquito netting" or "bar netting" on doors in America for sure.  I've seen reference to it in period books.  In the Laura Ingalls Wilder books it is described as being pink.  You might have more luck researching netting rather than screen.  I've also seen references in 1850's home journals to mosquito netting that was hung around the beds, it was woven out of a gauze.  Prior to netting people just shut the door at night since it was commonly believed that night air was what caused what we now know as malaria.  They called it "fever and ague" or "ager" or "the shakes".  You could also combat the annoyance of mosquitoes by building a "smudge fire" outside open door.  I've seen reference to people using a wire screen flap (no frame) in 1830, but it was in India, not America.  <br>  Metallic screening used in screen doors and windows was patented (#297,382) on April 22, 1884 by John Golding of Chicago, Illinois.  <br>  Torrey  Bartlett  N.  window screen    232573  09-21  1880  <br>  Good Luck!|`|bRLCxmP6aa	I would take the screen door out of the story - apparently, screens for windows, which one must assume came first - were only invented in 1861, per Wikipedia.|`|vYAgIMLdaa	Metallic screening used in screen doors and windows was patented (#297,382) on April 22, 1884 by John Golding of Chicago, Illinois.<br>  I'm sure the screen door was invented shortly thereafter.<br>  <br>  Google "screen door patent" and there is a list of many kinds of screen doors.

I haven't heard of feathers being left behind on visits, but I heard one sometime about someone who kept finding pennies (apparently the person who had died was a coin collector or something like that). Eventually we will see everyone who has died again after the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. Something to look forward to!|`|3ccd31e0b38f18f3123974ce88fcb948aa	My identical twin sister has come to me in dreams.  This happened several weeks after she died.

The Bible says that when you die you are dead and nothing of you lives on after that.  But, Satan told Eve she would not die when she ate of the fruit even though God told her she would.  So who do you think wants us to believe that our loved ones live after they die?  It is a blessing that they do not know what we are doing or what happens to us.  The tragedies that happen in many of our lives would make it very hard on them if they knew.  Would it be a paradise to our dead loved ones to see us suffer and cry over their death and they could do nothing about them.  When I was young, I had a friend that was very old.  We talked about death and at that time I knew nothing about the Bible.  He thought of me as his daughter.  He was never married and had no children.  I asked him to come and visit me after he died if it was possible.  He said that if there was ever any way that he could contact me after he died he would.  He never did.|`|BHNlBSf5aa	God says:"The dead know not anything neither have they any more reward for even their memories are perished."  The theory that the dead visit us is propaganda spurned on by the devil in preparation for the deceiving of the whole world in the end time.  Satan's demons have visited you!  See my 360 blog on death for all the scriptural back up for these statements.

TyRfv0eoaa	It's not Hebrew. It's pseudo-Hebrew. The final letter indicates "my" but the rest of it isn't a real Hebrew word.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	Since "Moroni" is the name of the capital city of the Comoro Islands (in the Indian Ocean, very close to Israel), the name might not be Hebrew.  It could be Arabic or Egyptian for all I know.  I don't recall ever having been told what its etymology is.  For that matter, many human beings today have no idea what their names mean, and (worse still) some have names that are complete nonsense, but their parents thought they sounded cool.<br>  <br>  I see that the -i at the end could indicate a possessive, e.g., Ishi, Adonai, etc.  It could be a shortened version of the name Moronihah, or something-or-other of the Lord; or it could simply be "my such and such," possibly referring to the Lord implicitly.<br>  <br>  Other than that, I'm not a scholar of antiquities.<br>  <br>  In fact, it doesn't particularly matter to me, now that I've actually had a reason to think about it.|`|AA11359317	"The first land settled by the Jaredites was Moron.

If you only concentrate on this mortal life, from birth to death, then any humanly possible behavior could be institutionalized. But if you have information about where we came from before being born on this physical earth, and if you have information about where we are going to be after living on this earth, then it becomes a question of whether or not the true fulfillment of human beings as children of God comes through obedience to the law of chastity or not. The optimal development, based on my experience and studies, comes through obedience to the law of chastity--that we should strive to stay chaste (no physical relations with someone who is not our spouse) until we are married to someone who is of the opposite gender. If someone tries to transgress or transcend or flout that law, all kinds of complications will result. They may not be readily visible complications, but it is similar to diverting a river to a highly-acidic desert where vegetation doesn't grow properly. There may still be some kind of harvest, but it won't be what it could have been.

AA10601065	I really had to think on this one, since school is so far in the past for me...<br>  <br>  Yes, there was one teacher... my 9th grade English teacher. Boy, oh boy was he cute. All the girls in the class definitely thought so, too. He couldn't have had his teaching credentials for very long because he was younger than just about every other teacher in the school. I don't think he could have been much more than 30, if even that. Anyway, if he'd have ever tried anything with me, I'd have gone right along in a heartbeat. Being a 9th grader (I'd have been what? 14?), I certainly wasn't going to try anything with him, but I sure would have liked to. English was my favorite subject that year. Ha-ha!|`|uky2nsh8aa	lol, i haven't, but my fiance really likes her literature last year. he is awesome though. i had him last year and she liked him a lot then, and was ecstatic to have him this year. lmfao|`|ecywznKRaa	OHH YESSS.<br>  I have a teacher this semester who like just got out of teacher college and came to teach my class.<br>  She's 24, and shes so HOTTTT.<br>  Like I can't even concentrate XD.<br>  I think she knows I like girls cause everytime she looks at me I'm flirting with someone in my class and she just smiles at me.<br>  She looks at me a lot.<br>  RAWR.

He's the tall muscular type kind of guy. His hands are so huge, when he hands me something, I get the jitterbugs in my stomach. He has a tattoo on his bicep, and this one time, he was showing the class because someone asked about it. I stared and drooled, basically. <br>  <br>  The other one is a Japanese teacher whom I don't have, but I know who he is. He's gorgeous looking, and has a soothing voice. He's so short, but that's what makes him so adorable. This one time, I was part of a fundraiser selling eggrolls, and he bought some. I handed him his plate of eggrolls, and he touched my hand. Again, jitterbugs in my stomach. <br>  <br>  They're both Caucasian. The first one's married, the second one not. I'd die if he were gay. Economics teacher is 35. Japanese teacher is in his 20's I would guess. Or maybe he reached 30.|`|paRGbr7Xaa	lol it's not a huge crush, but I do get a little flustered around my art professor.

Its like when people say that Spaniards and Italians are dark. The majority are just as light as Northern Europeans. I remember when i first went to Spain i thought the people there were British tourists at first because they were so light. At that time i too had fed into the stereotype of all Italians, French, Spaniards, Portuguese being dark and swarthy but now i know that is not true.
3bbtzjBuaa	It's interesting the way you asked the question.  The first thing you have to realize is that terms like "white" and "black" are political identities as well as social identities.  By this, I mean that the terms by which one is technically classified by the government can be different from those for society.  for example, if someone looks white, but has a great, great, great, great, great grandfather that is black, the United States' "one drop rule" deems them black, though most people will treat them as white until otherwise noted (of course the degree to which this plays out in politics and society has changed some between the 1700s and now).<br>  <br>  What's interesting, is that in many Latin- and South American countries do not use a "one-drop rule", and subscribe to different notions of indigenismo, mestizaje, blanquamento, etc. all of which can be researched on the internet or in a multitude of books, etc.<br>  <br>  The point is that Mexico had indigenous peoples, just like how the US has Native Americans.  With the arrival of white conquerors and black slaves, the populations engaged in a certain degree of miscegenation (racial mixture/coupling/...).  Because the United States had it's own unique proportions of each "race" of persons (coupled with other facts including where the immigrants largely came from - England as opposed to Spain), the society there treated the idea of racial mixture differently than the people in other newly-formed countries.  <br>  <br>  The bottom line is that, just as someone in the United States may have a Native Ancestor from generations back that does not show in their phenotype (the way they look), the same is true anywhere.  But looking at the racial makeup of Mexico following the arrival of Spaniards, as well as the social and political (sociopolitical) context of the area thereafter, it is pretty safe to say that most Mexicans have some combination of native, black, and white blood, though to varying degrees (hence the diverse-looking population).<br>  <br>  In terms of how Mexicans are legally classified in the United States:  We recognize that some Latinos (or "Hispanics") come from Spain with little-to-no mixture of other races - they're typically called White Hispanic regardless of how long their family has lived away from Spain.  However, there was a famous case in American History where it was declared that Mexicans are not white (even the whiter-looking ones).  This is what I mean by it being a political identity - though society may treat you as one race, the law ultimately factors in to justify or negate difference.<br>  <br>  Sorry for being so long-winded|`|I9Qp0wF6aa	Mexicans from the Mexcio City and up are generally caucasian but there are some caucasians living in southern mexico to. <br>  <br>  The majority of caucasian mexicans are from Spain, and France.|`|AA11858035	Mexicans are citizens of the country of Mexico, and just like Americans, they are white, black, native, and even a few asians.<br>  <br>  Mexican describes where they are from, not their heritage,<br>  <br>  And Mexico was colonized by Spain and ruled by France for many years, there are many Mexicans of European descent.|`|eskZfVBkaa	It depends on the Mexican. Remember that Mexican is a nationality, just like American. There are lots of White Mexicans who are of European descent (normally Spaniard, but also Italian, Irish, German) and also some Native American Mexicans. The majority of Mexicans in the USA are Mestizo (mix of European/White and Native American) which is why people are so shocked whenever they see a full White Mexican. White Mexicans are the minority in Mexico (i think they are only about 10% of the population) but they do exist!<br>  <br>  Alana A: U do realise that Spanish people are from Spain and are therefore White European?<br>  Apple, Kid: Latino/Hispanic is not a race. It is an ethnicity, meaning that someone can be racially White and still be classed as culturally Hispanic (as is the case with the White Mexicans in the photos.)|`|5Bpzt3Cnaa	They're very diverse <br>  Mostly a mix of Native Americans/European settlers<br>  and some are look very native american and some others look mostly european (spanish ancestries).|`|8Nqq7tkwaa	yet ANOTHER question about spanish and natives from the one obsessed.  what is your problem girl?|`|tVUBqdSzaa	they are hispanic.|`|pDmTRG82aa	mexicans can be brown white or even black depending on their ancestry<br>  <br>  im not surprised that youre speechless. most mexicans in the US dont look anything like that(most are usually brown skinned). quite frankly I also would have thought they were white americans and Im mexican and I look white.|`|tEsIu7FIaa	Both.

V8dXNAGeaa	You should DEFINITELY report her.  You're right that "Anyone making fun of a child with disabilities has no business working with them."  If she has willingly posted this information throughout the internet, then she obviously has no problem with people reading them.  Bring her Myspace to her boss's attention, file a complaint, and get her away from your child.  If she can't be trusted to want to nurture a disabled child, then why in the world does she work with them?|`|7IveT0RMaa	I would want to report her but I would not want her to know that it was me, in fear that she would treat my child differently.

Maybe it is her husband's ex-wife.  <br>  <br>  Haven't I heard a couple news stories about teenagers creating hurtful 'identities' on my space? <br>  <br>  I guess I would try to establish that this is really a page she put up herself.

Unless you are behaving without thinking, your confidence is not too much.<br>  <br>  As far as full of yourself and conceited... one way to know is to look at how you view others. If you have a tendency to believe you are better than others, you have a problem. I don't mean in the area of ideas, as we all sometimes believe we are right and others are wrong. I mean as a person. If you are constantly under the impression you are better than others, be it smarter, kinder, whatever... you probably need to work on being a little more humble. <br>  <br>  I'm assuming you are not purposefully showing off because you know it will impress them. As that, of course, would probably mean you have a problem with conceit as well. <br>  <br>  Though remember... especially over the internet, it is easy for people to take things the wrong way. You could be an expert on computers, and simply be trying to show you are knowledgable through your educational background, and someone could misinterpret this to be conceit. Reading words is different than being face to face, as you can't tell the way in which someone is saying something, or see their body language (particularly the look on their face). So if you really don't believe you are full of yourself... you probably aren't. You know yourself better than strangers, after all.

CSysSbnlaa	Well, over the modern years good magic and bad magic have gone through to "white magic" and "black magic". Black of course is the bad one. Though it is up to us there are spells for evil use. A white witch could be an herb witch or healer. Hey, lol, Witch of Endor is cool. But, yeah, a White Witch is like a really good witch. Of course this comes from Wicca and before Pagan so this goes back awhile. Yes, you can be any mythological creature and still christian, of course the religious peoples will get mad. Who cares? But I have a Vamp friend who's christian, it works. I'm just happy I'm free to be Wiccan. I love Wicca being a Vamp Witch.<br>  ~Midnightrose|`|AA10455120	Well if you want to branch out, Wicca is a good religion to try, since it's VERY ecclectic.<br>  About combining Wicca and Christianity; from a Wiccan stand point, that's fine, since Wicca is inclusive, and believes there is no "One True Way"<br>  From a Christian standpoint, that's evil and will land you in hell, since God specifically forbade any such thing.<br>  <br>  Now since you are young, most wiccans will not teach you anything without some form of parental consent(because parents can get pretty upset about that sort of thing, sometimes).<br>  <br>  What it means to become a white witch is this:<br>  Freedom, but the responsibility to consider your actions and do no harm.<br>  "power" but not nearly the amount you'd think.<br>  Nature-consciousness, but many people will think you are evil.<br>  Possible enlightenment after a great deal of time, but you must work hard for it, and you will probably be alone in your search for  your truth.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck, and blessed be.|`|EWR01atlaa	You can become a white witch it's a power you have when your born. You can become a wiccan [look it up online] A white witch is a good witch. A black which is supposed to be ''evil'' but of course i know some. And they are not at all evil. It's not something you can just ''think'' about becoming. It takes time if you want to become a wiccan. Probably a few years.... if that.|`|UyDkYaXuaa	A white witch is A Pagan/Wiccan who does spells/prayers to the gods or goddesses and directs energy. <br>  <br>  <br>  There really is no good or bad magick though. it's up to you and your will. <br>  <br>  A knife is neither good or bad. You can use it to free a defenseless animal from a trap or stab someone.|`|ZYOJQdjyaa	The word used in the original text of the old testament's admonition "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live" actually refers to a person who uses dark magic or uses magic to cause harm. When it was translated the translators used a catch-all term for magic user which then allowed Christians to burn herb-witches, wise women, and other followers of 'the Old Religion' as evil beings.<br>  <br>  Since Christianity co-opted many pagan rituals and beliefs I don't see why it can't work in reverse.|`|vouUQQzBaa	Some people refer themselves as colors meaning what THEY do. But colors are for the PRACTICE not for yourself (they're just used to identify yourself and your own practice)<br>  <br>  For instance:<br>  white - pure, good magick<br>  black - referring to magick meant to hurt someone (evil)<br>  green - referred to herbs and healing practice<br>  <br>  I'm sorry but christianity and paganism don't go together. Even though some wiccans worship Christ, it goes against christianity's beliefs any practice considered pagan (the altar, rituals, magick)|`|xFFZ0rH7aa	Sure you can be a white witch. But,no you can't have anything to do with the occult and still be a christian. Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.|`|Ah458EfWaa	a white witch is a good witch. u would use your powers 4 ONLY good things.|`|T1n3jt6Zaa	It means very little except to you and your beliefs|`|dFBccLExaa	Most people consider a white witch to be a "good witch" though the statement is kinda false... magick is grey, it's neutral, and it doesn't have intent or a purpose. So really, it can't have a color. Because of that, many people shy away from labeling anything with a color. <br>  There is no harm in learning and using magick, so long as you are responsible with it. Many people will tell you that Christianity and occult don't mix, but I've seen some people make it work. It's really kinda up to you, and what you feel is right for you. Don't be afraid to branch out and learn new things. Your loving christian god will always be there, if you change your mind.
8jK33jK1aa	No, but I've seen a blood red moon.
psWY3ZnWaa	I advise against basing your opinion of all Northern people on your friend's manners. She may be shy, or have been brought up poorly, or simply feel out-of-place. Some people try to cover such inadequacies with a pretense of "coolness" or not caring what others think. <br>  <br>  Granted, mid-Westerners I've had the privilege of meeting have been, if not quite as open and friendly as Southerners, still very warm and personable people. Perhaps that mid-Western warmth will rub off on her eventually.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	to say that it is rude means that you feel that it is wrong.  i see it as more direct and honest.|`|AJB1QcHzaa	She`s from New Hampshire...N H...also means "No Hint" on how to act civilly...Some of the rudest people live there. (of course, a whole bunch of them are originally from Massachusetts, which is the RUDEST place on earth)|`|QHI1crU9aa	I have lived in both the north and the south.  Both have their good and bad people but I would have to say that the south has generally better manners than the north.  My daddy was in the military and he grew up in the south, and when I moved up north all my teachers in school commented on how great my manners were and how I was one of the most polite kids in their classes.  I think it really depends on how you were raised.  Most northerners were raised to keep to themselves, whereas southerners like reaching out to people.|`|Wwgobzjaaa	This is something unique to her.

Not to say this is true of everyone, but just in general. Now just because they are colder, doesn't mean they are good people, they just have a different way about them.<br>  <br>  Southern hospitality and warm friendliness is second to none. I don't understand why exactly, but it seems that almost everyone I came across in the south was just warm and friendly and welcoming. Like you had known them forever.<br>  <br>  I have never understood the reasons for the differences, but have certainly noticed them. Don't get me wrong, I have met many, many wonderful people on the east coast, but they are just different. Even most of the ones I hit it off with were not the same kind of warm, open people I found in the south.<br>  <br>  I would say that in your girlfriend's case, it is probably a case of partly just the way people are where she is from...and also a bit of nervousness and uneasiness in unfamiliar surroundings.<br>  <br>  You might mention it to her delicately and see if there is a reason she wasn't interested in the conversation or what have you...I bet once everyone gets to know each other a little better, she will fit in just fine.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

AA10276327	According to Adventist teaching, the works of all men and women are written down in "books of record", kept in heaven. During the investigative judgment, these books will be opened (as described in Daniel 7:10 and Revelation 20:12), and the lives of all professed believers, living and dead, will be examined to determine who is truly worthy of salvation. "The books of record in heaven, in which the names and the deeds of men are registered, are to determine the decisions of the judgment." "As the books of record are opened in the judgment, the lives of all who have believed on Jesus come in review before God. Beginning with those who first lived upon the earth, our Advocate presents the cases of each successive generation, and closes with the living. Every name is mentioned, every case closely investigated." The judgment will show those who are authentic believers in God from those who are not. "All who have truly repented of sin, and by faith claimed the blood of Christ as their atoning sacrifice, have had pardon entered against their names in the books of heaven; as they have become partakers of the righteousness of Christ, and their characters are found to be in harmony with the law of God, their sins will be blotted out, and they themselves will be accounted worthy of eternal life." On the other hand, "When any have sins remaining upon the books of record, unrepented of and unforgiven, their names will be blotted out of the book of life, and the record of their good deeds will be erased from the book of God's remembrance." "Sins that have not been repented of and forsaken will not be pardoned and blotted out of the books of record, but will stand to witness against the sinner in the day of God." During the judgment, Satan will bring accusations of transgression and unbelief against believers, while Jesus acts as defense. "Jesus will appear as their advocate, to plead in their behalf before God." "While Jesus is pleading for the subjects of His grace, Satan accuses them before God as transgressors." The good news of the judgment is that Jesus is not only the Attorney, but He is also the Judge.(John 5:22) With Jesus as Attorney and Judge there is nothing to fear.|`|UL3XOKJxaa	You have been an adventist your whole life and you do not understand these foundational truths? Maybe you should consider a faith which would answer those questions for you using the one source of truth available to mankind today...the bible. God is not about days, Mark 2:27 plainly says that man was not made for the sabbath, but the sabbath was made for man... God is about belief and obedience to His word, not the words and traditions of man. In fact, God says that you worship Him in vain by your traditions. You may want to reconsider your present position. God Bless

He has over-enhanced and embellished  the story of Lucifer's fall as it is explained in Isaiah 14:12-21.<br>   The chapter is often misunderstood by readers because it first deals with God speaking to the king of Babylon then God speaks to the spirit that was motivating the king of Babylon( ie Lucifer) Read it for yourself . Isaiah is in the old testament. <br>  This isn't a religion lecture but the subject is religious in that our own fall can be paralleled to how Satan fell.

If it is not in the Bible, I don't pay much attention to stories.  The name Lucifer is not even mentioned in most translations of the Bible.  And the ones that have it are referring to the King of Babylon.  That is the name Isaiah gave to him because he was arrogant and boastful.  That is why Isaiah called him "Lucifer" or "shining one".|`|OBid7Ozsaa	Nothing is fascinating about Lucifer....|`|angW1Lkfaa	Every person has his story most them are pasted on and people believe them.
