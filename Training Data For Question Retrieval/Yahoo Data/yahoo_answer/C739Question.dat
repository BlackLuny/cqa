Well, I've been a vegan for about 4months or so for my own reasons, and I just got a job at a bar and grill, which is a western style Bbq place. Wev'e been going through training for a few days now, and the next step is to try the food, so we know what to reccomend and what's good, but I don't eat meat, which is pretty much all my resturant serves. I don't want to tell them I'm vegan cause I fear they won't keep me long, considering it's a meat resturant. If I try the food will I get sick since I have't ate meat in months? I just don't wanna be rude and not try the food.

20090204222434AAU92zf	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	What do YOU consider an "alcoholic"?	I'm going to ask this as rationally as possible. I don't care too much I just like opening up questions to people. Alcoholism is a serious disease but some people have differing opinions on what it actually is.      I, personally, believe that "alcoholism" is indeed someone who is dependent on alcohol in their daily life. However I know some people will go as far as to say that if you have one drink every day you're an alcoholic.       I'll admit that I do drink, but not every day. I'll have some beers a few times a week when the opportunity comes up.       If someone has two Mountain Dews every day does that make them an addict of that too? What about a burger a day? Doesn't seem like that's as big of a deal to most people.

I have attempted to "cure" my new cherrywood humidor by sponging down the sides, leaving a shot glass of water in it, etc, and am properly filling the humidifier, but it always loses humidity after a day or two.

The bill pulls out, but there seems to be some grip. Wasn't by any means impossible to pull out, but it did resist.      I emailed the company I bought it from and since it was out of their 30 day policy, they wouldn't replace it. So I'm stuck unless I can some other suggestions. I'd really rather not spend money on another humidor.

I had drunk literally a 5th of vodka by myself, stayed up untl like 6-8 am and ha no hangover whatsoever. Now whenever I drink a little bit and go to bed I have the wort hangovers the next day. Could the reason I had no no hangover the 1st time be because I stayed up all night?
