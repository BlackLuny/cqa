I have been running home based businesses since 1994, some were excellent some were not worth it.  That didn't make them scams, it just wasn't worth the effort.  Most companies like that have closed their doors.  You really have to take the time to find a product you believe in and that you can see the benefit for others.  Once you've found that, you get to work doing just that.    I have run many home businesses, none of them were scams in any way, shape or form.    I just applied myself, paid attention to the people who had already done it, took their advice and earned an excellent income from home.

PAWbTYLoaa	A removal cost is calculated by taking into consideration: loading, unloading and time traveling to the destination, as well as how many porters it will take to clear the property in the given time frame. Long distances can be considerably put up the price of a removal, this is because of the high fuel prices with a removal vehicle only managing around 10 miles to the gallon (around 60p per mile). Labour costs also contribute as wages still have to be paid even though the porters are not working just traveling and enjoying the view.    Restrictions on driver's hours will also come into play. There is also night out money (subsitance), parking costs and wear and tear on a vehicle to include as well. If you do have a long distance to move have a cup of tea ready for your movers when they arrive, after all they have just spent the night sleeping in the van protecting your belongings.     for other information you can check my source site|`|YyAUdSPeaa	People in the business know what needs to be done moving house or items.  They will look at the project from all angles such as age, size, height, and what ever else needs to be looked at.    It depend on what part of the world your in but here most will think up how many hours it will take to move the house and how many employees it will take.  They will times the hours by $50.00 an hour.  Then they will look at the equipment that will be required to do the job and the charge by the hour what ever the going rate is.  They will add the permit cost times 10% or more.  After they have a list of everything that need to done and what it will take and how long it will take and times all the prices and come out with w grand total then add up to 10% for their profit. and then hit you with taxes and other fees.    The price that they give you will be on a contract that is signed by both parties.  The contractor must do the job for that price.  However you can ask 3 companies to submit bids for your job and you pick the best cheapest one.  then you can talk them down to a better price if you think you can.  If it cost more then the contractor looses money but if it cost less then he makes money.    It will be up to you to check out the contractors.  find out where they live and what kind of life style they live.  If they drive to work in a limo then you know this guy maybe a little high on his prices.  But this is not a great rule to follow as some can drive nice cars but be the cheapest guy.  Check with the BBB to see if they have complaints against them.    It is your money so spend wisely call some local people talk to people who the company worked for before.  Take your time and don't jump into something you can't stop.  You may still need to get a building contractor to build the foundations and hook the house up so you can live in it.

UDaFpPp8aa	Besides all the crap below, there are many pet suppliers that will inundate you with their stuff just to sell their products. This is good because you can pick and choose the best supplier. Owning a pet shop is a FULL TIME job. regardless of any public holidays, these critters need to be fed and given fresh water supply every day of the year regardless if you want a sicky. Good staff is of a priority and cleanliness, good fresh air is a priority. These days councils will investigate any breach of animal rights/cruelty and fine you. Customers may also come in, look, think and call the RSPCA because they feel that any animal may look likes it's unhappy needs to be investigated. Whatever you do, the pets/animals must be a priority in your business. They're not products that sit on your shelf with use-by-dates.

You need to check financial comparison websites like Motley Fool, Martin's Money Tips etc for the rates they offer.  What you can't invest immediately in an ISA  because of limits of investment, I would keep in a high interest account with any bank or building society- again check the websites mentioned above - but you need to check the conditions, e.g. you could invest for 6 months, 12 months or longer.  And then later, you could transfer the money to your ISAs, when it is O.K. to transfer, oer spend it on a deposit.

9wtpCNb6aa	Ok, well, as someone who clearly isnt even on the lease, you have no legal obligation to pay the rent at all.  Im not sure if the landlord is aware you are there, but if he doesnt, then the girls sub-let that room to you which is illegal, therefore they cant very well take it up with the landlord.  On the other hand, if the landlord does know you are there but you are not on the lease, he or she is also breaking the rules as a landlord for allowing sub-letting which is also illegal.  Therefore you are not the bad guy in all of this.    Its not your concern if the other tenants dont get their deposit back as that is between them and the landlord, not you therefore they should give you your money back and if they dont then simply dont pay your last months rent.  Like i said, they cant take it up with anyone as it doesnt seem you are legally living there.  Who are they to keep your deposit just because they feel they will not get theirs?  This is your deposit, a deposit which wasnt given to the landlord anyway.      If there are rent arrears and you have paid all your rent, then this wont affect you, and if its because of house repairs that they think they wont get it back then its the landlords obligation to fix any repairs, probably as per their lease, so they can take that up with the landlord accreditation team - a legal team who support the rights of tenants and once again this is not your concern.    I would certainly not pay your last months rent, why would you?  If you have been paying your rent and have had nothing to do with the house repairs, and are not even on the lease, then there is nothing legally that they or the landlord can do.    I wouldnt stress about it, just start packing and start looking elsewhere, but dont lose another months rent over this.    If you have any other major concerns, you can talk to the landlord accreditation team yourself.    EDIT - well even better i guess, the landlord is breaking the rules by knowing you are living there but didnt get you all to re-sign a lease, therefore if you dont pay your last month rent, he cant do a single thing about it without getting himself in a lot of trouble for sub-letting which i can assure you is illegal.  Seriously dont worry about it!  The whole thing is a sham, you cant be blamed for anything, in fact, if it ever did come down to it you could deny all knowledge of living there in the first place, is your landlord going to say otherwise?  I dont think so!  Your safe as houses mate, just keep the money you were going to pay as your last month, get out of there asap, screw the other housemates, forget the deposit and use what you have to get a new flat.  Always remember to sign a contract though!!  Let this be a lesson learned!!!  Good luck|`|REC4YgOuaa	Like everyone else has said I wouldn't pay the last month's rent.

You made a mistake though in handing over a deposit before you had a written contract as now you have nothing solid to lean on, as you handed the money to them you have a contract with them and not the landlord so you can't get your money back of him.  As you have  no contract though (as there were no agreements to the terms and conditions) you might escape being able to pay the rent if you leave. As if the court doesn't acknowledge you paid a depoist, you can be veiwed as being their guest, as thre would of been no contract saying you would pay them rent.|`|213Tajn3aa	dont pay the last months rent|`|USzLnQn6aa	Balls to 'em,  don't pay and save it for the deposit on your next place or a weekend away.|`|oFiGyMWraa	Have you ever signed any agreement with the landlord? If not then you are not a tenant.    It could be possible for you to have a formal tenancy agreement with the current tenant, making you a sub-tenant, but you are probably only a licensee (guest) of the current tenants. Either way, your agreement is solely with them, and if you have stuck to it then you should be entitled to your deposit back.    However, they clearly have not done anything properly. They probably aren't allowed to sublet under the terms of their contract with the landlord. And they have probably spent your deposit.    The simplest thing to do is not pay the last month's rent. You are not out of pocket, and the 3 of them can sort out the mess with the landlord. As I said, unless you have made an agreement with the landlord he has no hold over you at all.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	you silly girl...whatever made you pay a deposit to anyone other than the landlord of the property...they've ripped you off here and as you dont have a contract there's nothing that you can do...it's not fair for them to keep your deposit because they haven't got their deposit...try thepolice or the C.A.B. at least...no good going to the landlord as you had no agreement with him.|`|ugqaDJSRaa	I would make up a fake story...honestly u have 1 month 2 go so id be doing all i can to get my bond back    say to them that u have sought leagl advice and they are required to pay you. you legally do have a verbal contract with them and that bond isnt their money, its yours and you have done no damage to the house....they cannot kick you out, and if they try cry harrasment or assualt or something, but do not leave without your money.    i had a problem like this once and my mum went around at ike 11pm at night demanding the money..it worked well.|`|lVuBtzS2aa	No contract = no money    You shouldn't have paid any rent at all to them    Just have a shi*ty last month and move out without telling them    It's not your problem if they don't get their deposit back    Also talk to the advisors in student union    But you're not legally obliged to pay anything without a contract|`|y1BjjH10aa	stay calm - what can they do? as the other respondents have said don't pay the last months rent - we've all done this sort off stuf (trusted people etc) - just learn from this and be more careful in the future - like the place you're moving to. Good luck in your new home.    edit - there is a misconception that a contract is not binding unless it is written down - wrong. A verbal contract is still a contract. The issue is having proof of the contract (which is evident if it is written down). In this case you have given your flatmates money to stay there and they have accepted it - that is the proof
awmfPEiIaa	Yes. It has been proved over and over again that advertising indeed does have a significant impact on consumption patterns and general social mindset towards a particular product or product class. Watching massive-budget advertisement of cigarettes being portrayed as something cool, stylish and ordinary over and over and over again is bound to make many people have a generally less negative perception of them in the long run, especially if this has been an everyday thing since their childhood. Advertising on products that can have significant negative impacts on society should definitely be banned or limited imo.|`|ccM9uNcWaa	No.  Just because things aren't advertised, doesn't mean people will not buy them.  Take cigarettes for example, there's a ban on them because they're unhealthy, and yet, millions of people still continue to smoke.  Advertising does not have a massive effect on everyone.  I think there should, however, be a rule that says certain things such as alcohol, cigarettes and violent/pornographic adverts shown after a set time.  I know this is the case for some but for cigarettes there is none. Just countless advertisements in the day encouraging people to stop smoking.

Property ownership is a matter of public record. Go to your city or county courthouse and check the ownership of the property. In many jurisdictions, that information is online (do an online search for "[city or county] tax assessor"). That'll get you close to the right place. Then just find out who owns the property.    There are plenty of other ways, too. For example, ask the neighbors. They'll know who owns the house. Ask the mail carrier. He or she probably will know.    You say that your roommate is the "main lease holder." He may be in a Catch-22. Did you sign the lease? If so, then the lease should have the owner's name and address. [You added that you did sign the lease. Then check the lease; the landlord's name and contact information should be there. And you are entitled to--and should have been given a copy of--the lease.] If not, your roommate may be in violation of the lease. Leases often require that all tenants (often all over the age of 18) be signatories to the lease. If the lease requires that, and you didn't sign, then your roommate may be violating the lease.    However, assuming that he's the only one on the lease, then--as other answers noted--you don't have a legal relationship with the landlord. Your only obligation/commitment is to your roommate. In that case, it probably wouldn't do any good to talk to the landlord; he certainly wouldn't have any power to override an agreement between you and your roommate.    Hope that helps.|`|jYLZYxDvaa	Keep punching him till they tell you.|`|a73a11fa642e15167d49c1ea43b54b8caa	Your deal is with the roommate.  The landlord probably won't even discuss your roomies lease with you.|`|9pO3XVxMaa	You can search the property tax records for your county and it will list the owner's name and address.  From there, if his phone number is not listed...you can mail him a "registered" letter.  This way you will have confirmation he received the letter.    On the otherhand, if you have not the lease...if the lease was only signed by your room-mate, then I don't think you have a legal obligation to the landlord.      Third option, wait until your room-mate is in the shower and search his phone contacts.|`|NpdAmv2Uaa	Go to the city Housing Authority dept. and see if someone in that dept. can do a reverse lookup for you as to who owns the house. Did you sign a lease? Do you have a copy of it? You should!  Just pack your stuff and move out!!    Also, go to your local Barnes & Noble bookstore or Borders or something like that and find books on Landlord tenant law for your state....they should spell out the details... if  you signed a month to month agreement, you should be able to move out whenever you want.. If you didn't sign any lease agreement at all, how do they have anything to leagally bind you to stay or pay for any period that  you are not living there? Go to the bookstore, get your info and then move on with your life..    your soon to be ex roommate won't give you the information because they are lying to you and trying to make sure that they don't have to cover your extra portion of the rent if you move out earlier? Why else would they withhold the the Landlord's contact info from you? See if you can get your OWN place next time.. roommates SUCK!|`|V3kzue7Zaa	Google the landlord or look up in Whitepages.  Yikes, Skip is probably a nickname.      Do you know how your  immature roomate found the house??     If it was a newspaper or rental publication, maybe call the newspaper where the house was orginally advertised?      Explain the situation, they may atleast give you a proper name?    If the other roomies won't squeal, steal your crappy roomate's phone for a min as a last resort.       Unless you did something really horrible to this one roomate, they are being way out of line.      There are websites out there that allow you to post how bad your roomate is being.  This informs other people in your metro area, so they don't make a mistake.|`|sYKoPw3uaa	A real-estate agent will be able to provide you with that information
AA12349988	Without knowing the rest of your circumstance I could not pass judgement.    But assuming your didn't have any disabilities or other reasons as to why you couldn't work more than 16.5 hours a week - they yes I would call you a scrounger as you can work more.    And some peole blame immigration for the unemployment levels in the UK.    Whats wrong with a bit of pride my man?  That is priceless.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	The newspapers make up stories about benefit scroungers to take attention away from tax evaders like News International.|`|B1CfeLu9aa	Yes - you are a scrounger  what's wrong with working full time, as you'd be able to work your way up a career ladder.. eventually earning more etc etc    do you do unpaid/volunteer work for the rest of your working hours?|`|721V5Busaa	Yes.|`|5bWZ39B7aa	i agree with mystical mamba.  Haven't you thought about it this way? - you may not be getting taxed on your earnings, but we are to pay for scroungers like you.  Go get a full time job.|`|Te7H58XEaa	Why dont you work full time and look after your family along with your wife and pay your own way!?! So basically you dont want to struggle like everyone else?! I wish I had 297 TAX FREE!!! per week but I dont, cos I have to pay my rent, council tax, and many other bills!! I cant have kids because I can only just afford to keep myself!     I think its wrong you should get off the benefits and pay your own way if you are fit to work.    To end it, yes you are a scrounger.    How can you say enjoy your free time.... i have 2 jobs one full time and an evening job just to keep my head above water..... and your swanning off enjoying yourself on tax payers money......people like you are what is wrong with this country!!|`|acfc72c06b0a4dc20dc3f97089ebc786aa	I don't think its you that is wrong...you are doing your best in a bad situation.   The system is at fault because you should be able to earn a living wage...then the benefits you receive wouldn't be needed.   The minimum wage and tax system in this country is a joke and completely unfair.  With the scraping of the 10p tax rate and the increases to come because of the debt Gordon is wracking up ,it will only get worse for the low paid I am afraid.  The little propaganda trick they played to make everyone think that they reversed the tax decision didn't actually help the poorest..but rewarded those who weren't even on that rate! And that just about sums the system up doesn't it.|`|gUJEdJh8aa	I don't consider you a scrounger. But the system is wrong. You should be able to earn more working than not working. But as someone else said, by working you may be able to improve your situation by promotion etc. but of course that cannot be guaranteed - and you could be made redundant at any time anyway. It is about time we had a government strong enough to correct the situation. In your circumstances I would probably do as you are doing.|`|9c53EJskaa	Yes i would. That's not to say i don't think that what you're doing is smart and ideal for any slacker to give a try, yes, I think you're a scrounger.    I work 35 hours a week, and while i get around a grand less than you annually i'm proud of the fact that I work for my money and every penny of it has been earned.    I don't get any government handouts, my rent and council tax are both sky high but you know what? I'm standing on my own feet- I'm supporting myself. And that's something that you can't say.|`|t5SZ1uAWaa	Pride, where is it...    Im in agony, im disabeled, i work more than full time hours to get a decent wage on minimum wage... i could sit on my backside and claim everything that you are doing but no... I have pride, and love working and getting my own independence and a decent wage knowing no matter what pain i am in i wont let my disability stop me and will work for my standard of living...    I would never do what your doing, why isnt your wife working, why arnt you doing a full time job?|`|dAn9koABaa	no not a scrounger, very lucky to have any work at all , you are working with the system that we have in this country, over 3 million unemployed, the statistics tell us there are only 66,000 jobs|`|pRoyFWL6aa	Some people are so short sighted it amazes me.And their math is poor too! 7000 jobs being created at asda at 5.73 an hour.37.5  hours a week = 214.88 a week before deductions.So all those who feel that the adult who works full time to support their families are scroungers! Should we not be applauding somebody who works full-time to support their family instead of calling them scroungers.The fact that their full time wage is insufficient to support their families is not their fault,as for bettering themselves with more education for better wages people on three time as much are still entitled to benefits .What do you want a nation of brain surgeons so there is no need to give out benefits.Two adults with children both working full time on minimum wage would still be entitled to several thousand in benefits.I don't hear of the 50k+ a year workers with children giving back the family allowance...now these are the scroungers.When you complainers are having your dustbins emptied your post delivered and the tesco van dropping of your shopping remember these people are scroungers .you disgust and embarrass me.|`|4Ef8yCbfaa	I wouldnt call you a scrounger.    Your doing your best in a man eat man world.    Kudos to you my friend.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	no i wouldn't but at the moment the way things are people are being made redundant every day so its no one s fault you or they are on benefits

7YPdogmDaa	i am a receptionist for the state of Texas. i remember being asked what were the important aspects of a good phone message. Which is easy, but then again so is being a receptionist. anyway in case you don't know what the important things are, Who, Time and Date, and what the call is in regards to. Don't be nervous and good luck!    also, it is hard to talk about yourself when asked those ridiculous questions like what makes you good for the job or whatever...mention that you are fast learner, that you are willing to help others if needed, and are prepared to give 110% everyday. At the end of your interview, be sure to thank them for their time and the opportunity to apply for their opening.|`|cWuumdy7aa	You should not be nervous go confidently and answer the question looking in to the eyes of the person interviewing you. he will ask you about your self and why you are suitable for the job of receptionist also he may ask what are the requirements to be a good receptionist. may i wish you all the best god bless you.|`|DCP2GJDZaa	1 tip is to ask questions yourself, employers like that just never talk about pay. never gone for a receptionist's job so cant help you much in that respect
ztFk9lh4aa	Well no company can have a stock market other than the likes of the New York Stock Exchange. Private companies can have shares of stock for the company which are traded privately. For example, Publix Supermarkets is a privately held company which has shares of stock. The only way you can own them is to be an employee. Publix does not have its stock listed or traded on an exchange such as NYSE, AMEX or NASDAQ for the sole reason it is a private company. Once a stock is listed on one of those locations, anyone can buy and sell it, making it a public stock by definition.
99804191e04925088d15b9fd886583a3aa	This goes back to the basic question of who's got the right idea: The Democrats-who treat everyday as if it's April 15th and want to take from the "rich"(I'm not rich-are you?) and redistribute it to the 15 million illegal aliens and make sure that the people on Government subsidies get more so that they can become more like you and me-the people that work for a living and only want to have a fair playing field to compete on.  If we work harder or smarter we expect that we should be able to keep the fruits of our labor and not have Big Government bully their way into our lives(read:wallets, pocketbooks, bank accounts, etc).  Or you can get behind people like the Republicans that say "No, America was established as the land of opportunity and all Uncle Sam should be doing is assuring our freedoms as already spelled out in the Constitution. Republicans treat everyday as if it's July 4th. Getting back to the letter of the Constitution would turn our country around to where it should be.  By the way I am even more staunchly Republican leaning because I believe in everything Ron Paul and his platform presented to the American public this past year.  Most Americans that viewed it as "to radical" didn't realize that it is exactly how a government that is based on our Constitution should be run.  I also believe that the we need to eliminate the "Federal Reserve"(did you know that it is as much of a Federal office as is Federal Express?) and the IRS has to be eliminated also(go to http://www.Fairtax.org and see what it can do for us).    As to what are they going to do when they can't "rob peter to pay Paul"?  Well, let's just hope that all Americans quickly see what a mistake they made with that illegal President they elected and what him and all his empty suits are already doing-trying to rob Peter to pay Pablo-and they vote him and them out in 4 years.  Otherwise quickly get your FOID card and buy a few weapons because there will be chaos in our country.

vzqKVGnsaa	Well, I will just try to explain the difference between planing and organizing, and with it you can assume how is that connected to some event. A planner is a person who plans things, events or whatever. It's just planning in theory, and written on paper. The organizer is actually the executioner, he takes the plans and make them reality, he decides when it happens and where, who will come, where will they sit, who will bring the food and drinks etc. I hope I explained it ok :)    +-------------------------------------...
qWytoOMmaa	I'll start out by saying you might not like my answer, but it's based in fact.    Employment agencies are typically paid by the employer, and therefore may not respond to you with the urgency you would like - unless you are the ideal candidate.      Based on the Information that was provided to you, you say you are a perfect match.  But the agency job post provides Information that is typically geared to attract a very wide swath of talent/skill.  What "Dave" may be actually looking for in the details may be missing in your resume.  Also consider that you are being compared to potentially 100's of other applicants, especially in this market.    The other typical scenario with agencies is that the posting is for a job they hope to have in the future, or what they typically recruit for and they are creating a pipeline for anticipated needs.    Is it bad form not to respond to any kind of outreach? Yes.  And that tells me that "Dave" is probably overwhelmed with resumes and there is a lack of follow through resources available to him.  So what to do?  I would move on and look for work elsewhere.    I've worked on the agency side and can tell you that what you are experiencing isn't what the best agencies do.  the best agencies respond with a "thanks but your skills aren't right" e-mail or call.  When they don't respond it is a clear sign that the agency either has what it needs, or isn't as good as they should be.|`|ZEwAalKPaa	It is a basic fact of life that many recruitment agents are not interested unless you completely match the profile given to them by their client for the person they want to find.    As he has not called you back he obviously does not consider you to be likely to be called for interview and feels he has better things to do with his time.  Sorry, but i rather think your 'dave'  is more interested in the agencies' commission than giving you due courtesy.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	There's tons of applicants, and he just doesn't have time to respond to everyone. Weekend office job - there will be many stay at home mums as well as others, who are in the same situation as you, and think yes that would perfect for me. That's not to excuse him not returning your calls, it is rude, but some agencies do operate on the basis of 'if you haven't heard back from us in a week, your application has been unsuccessful' or the job has already been filled...  do double check those monster adverts, and the date they were posted online. Bear in mind some jobs get re-posted each day to make them seem like fresh opportunities.     You'd be better off actually registering with the agency, and then if something comes up that they think fits your skills, they can contact you straight away. Afterall, all the best jobs get filled with people already registered, before they even get put on Monster.|`|vqNt37cDaa	It sounds like he is not interested in you but don't take it personally.  With so many people out of work it is a"buyers" market.  Employers have a lot more to choose from  and there may be someone who's qualifications are a better match.   Recruiters are notorious for this type of bad behavior.  If nothing happens after a week move on. You are better off to keep your cool and continue looking

hVZ1EBVfaa	HI,  You may get a free credit report (Expirian, Equifax, Transunion)and see if it's there, if it is, how long since the bill was due? close to 7 years?? since 7 years is the limit that it can be on your credit report, they cannot sue you after 3 years, BUT and READ THIS CAREFULLY... if you make an arrangement with the collection agency and make a single payment and decide not to pay them later, then the 7 years start from the date you made the last payment (the pymt arrgmt) with them, it starts all over again. 1st check you credit report, if it's not, then don't worry about it. if it is, I would dispute it with the credit report company, saying you dont know what this is, they have 30 days to provide proof to you and the credit bereau of this proof, if after 30 days they have not provided any proof, then the credit bureau will remove it.    Good Luck.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	How did you find out this debt is actually on your credit report, because if it is and the credit bureau cannot tell you exactly who you owe  I believe they have to remove it. It is unreasonable to expect someone to pay a debt when they do not know what creditor they   owe .If you do not have a credit report obtain one from all the three credit report depositories.

LeNeinDUaa	knowing where you live would make my answer easier. But I will give you my opinion based on teh info you provided.     45K is good, depending on how they calculate the commission. Do you get commission based on a goal they set for you and % you hit? Or do you get commission per sale, meaning one sale = $X. Get an understanding of how they do this. Then, think about your skills, do you have what it takes to meet and exceed their expectations, thus making a lot of money?   I worked at a sales job with a crappy base worked 6 days a week (everyday but Tuesday) and made pretty good money since it was retail sales and commission was based on the margin for each item. The higher I sold it for the more I got. However, if they said I had to sell $100,000 worth of products each month or whatever, that would have been harder, especially if commission dropped significantly if I didn't hit say...90%...  My advice, get a better under standing of their commission structure etc, assess how much money you NEED to live each month and decide if you think YOU can do it!!|`|AA10405438	In this economy taking the job offer would be the wisest decision.

a3WTEzR6aa	Most people have to finance their own start ups.  My husband and I had perfect credit and little debt.  He had written up an extensive business plan.  But it's rare you'll find a bank to take the risk.    We took a second out on our house and used credit cards.  Once we got the ball rolling, opened up business accounts, etc., we were able to get a line of credit with the bank.    But even after a year of the business paying for itself we could not get a general loan to wrap all the debt together.  You have to be in business long enough for it to start showing up in the business credit reporting agencies.  That can take a while.    Not to mention, they are not going to want to give you a business loan to pay off personal debt.  Have you tried other means to wrap all that together on the personal side?    Until you put a solid business plan together they won't even consider anything, so that should be your first step.|`|ZEwAalKPaa	Dream on!  No bank is going to give you a business loan to start a dog walking 'business'!    It is crazy to think of starting the sort of 'business' you are thinking of while you have any debts at all.  If you must do this you need to be debt free and have enough in the bank to keep you for 3 months at least while you build up a regular clientele.    You might like to consider the possibility that your efforts and good ideas could result in YOU becoming one of those 'big cheeses' in due course!|`|STYhiMEyaa	Ev-ian gives you some good advice.  As he says, think about starting your business in your spare time.  You shouldn't need a lot of capital to start it up.  You might want some fliers to pop through local letter boxes and you'll definitely need insurance.  That should get you started with your dog walking.  Aim to make your business self-financing as soon as possible.  Once you've built up a bit of cash from dog walking, you can then reinvest that in your dog care service.    The bank is unlikely to consider a loan to pay off your personal debt to help you start your business.  They want a business plan that demonstrates clearly how the money they loan you will be invested and what the return on it is going to be.  Clearing personal debt doesn't count as a business expense.    Think about taking a day off work and attending one of Business Link's free seminars on starting in business.  They cover all the basics, have information on some specific businesses.  They also help with the format of your business plan and, if it's appropriate, they can guide you through applying for funding.    Try paying a little bit more each month off your credit card bill.  The quicker you can reduce the capital you owe on it, the less interest you'll be paying each month.  Say your basic payment is 100 per month and you pay 120, that slowly helps bring the debt down.    Good luck with your new business.|`|uJDCoXH9aa	Change your name.|`|tFfUMQtyaa	You would be best off asking your bank for an interview to chat about this...

Do you currently own (in cash value) more than you owe? Or are you upside down. Banks usually do not give loans unless you have the means (collateral) to back the loan, if you fail to pay, the bank can get at least some of the money back by seizing & selling your collateral. why waste your time asking your question here. If you are really serious, ASK YOUR BANKER!|`|L6aR6GJbaa	You need to put together a good business plan. This will set out the financial issues and thats what the bank/lender will consider. But why do you need money to invest: can't you start in in your spare time and if it gorws then maybe swap to a part time job and then quit that. I.e., build it up 'organically'...don't live on borrowed cash or savings waitng for it to grow. A good business plan will take time to do: work through a book chapter by chapter. If you start it up part-time you will have a good idea of what income is realistic and so won't make the usual mistake of being over-optimistic....(expect 50-100 hours to do a comprehensive business plan)|`|qyS1RC2yaa	http://answerr.isimo-spain.com  A very informative website, you can also get much information in website|`|bwddqxxpaa	***Make Sure To Check Out, www.macsmaverickcashclub.com, The Best Online Business!

The usual places asbestos is found are insulation (wall, duct, pipe) and old floor tile.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	If you hire a certified asbestos removal firm, they will insure that all asbestos is removed in a safe and complete manner.  Be aware that this is NOT inexpensive. Heavy precautions must be taken to insure that all asbestos fibers are removed with special vacuum systems.    As well, not ALL asbestos poses a danger.  As example, if it is contained in exterior siding which is in good condition, the asbestos fibers pose no dangers.  The danger comes from asbestos which was used in ceiling tiles, used to wrap heat ducts and pipes, and similar.  Asbestos which is 'fully contained' in other products poses no danger unless disturbed by cutting, sawing, or similar.

I was... for many many years but toward the latter end of my career my employers instigated a bonus scheme, from then on the whole idea of work was a total no, no, and I was overly delighted (On a personal scale) when we were privatised and I was made redundant.  At one time work was where I took a great pride in the product that I gave, because in those days I took the time needed to give my all at the task in hand.  Once the bonus schemes came into force then either the job was timed to be done far too quickly for me to be totally happy about the safety, or, I'd spend many an extra hour per month of my own time in customers homes providing what I considered were workmanlike results, this practice allowed me to book some hard earned bonus to keep up with the cowboys... who quite frankly didn't give a damn.    In my opinion:  Bonuses never give good results, nor in fact does it help a company long term... when sub contractors are employed to allay paying holidays, national insurance, or pension funding, some day all of this has to be funded by somebody when it should have been done and done with at the time, instead of the shareholder,employer,  growing ever fat from the quick fix bonus buck.  The customers always suffers the loss of quality work and the future generations will have to foot the ever missing pension bill.  I would never ever invest my hard earned money in a Company where the workforce were embroilled into such schemes for fear of loosing my share value when the shoddy work is finally discovered and the once shining reputation of the company goes belly up.|`|yp3ktx0Caa	no i want to jump infront of a train

19V1ehfqaa	Hi Dolly    Market Segmentation.    Market Segmentation is the marketing process of identifying and breaking up the total market into groups of potential customers with similar motivations, needs or characteristics, who are likely to exhibit homogeneous purchase behaviour. Undertaking this process allows marketing efforts to be targeted at select groups. In determining their segmentation strategy, organisations can choose to pursue the whole market with a single offer (Mass Marketing), pursue only certain segments with specific offers (niche marketing) or pursue individual customers with specific offers designed just for them customisation).      The process enables a company to develop a suitable marketing mix for each of the chosen market segments. A Market Segment is a (relatively) homogeneous group of customers with similar characteristics, wants, needs or behaviours that is likely to respond similarly to a given marketing mix.     5 Ways or bases of market segmentation  1. Geographic Segmentation.  2. Demographic Segmentation (age, gender, income occupation etc).  3. Psychographic Segmentation (values, attitudes, social class, lifestyle and aspirations). Compare: value and benefits  4. Behavioural Segmentation (occasion, benefits sought, loyalty status, user status, buyer readiness).  5. Product differences.  Steps in segmentation. Process    1. Identify the total market.  2. Determine the segmenting dimensions.  3. Profile each segment.  4. Assess segment attractiveness.  5. Select target market.  6. Determine (marketing mix) for each segment.  Strengths of Segmentation. Benefits  ? Organisationgets to know its customers better.  ? Provides guidelines for resource allocation.  ? It helps focus the strategy of the organisation  Limitations of the Segmentation. Disadvantages  ? Targeting multiple segments increases marketing costs.  ? Segmentation can lead to proliferation of products.  ? Narrowly segmenting a market can hamper the development of broad-brand equity.

People are human and times are hard--and medical bills -divorce--and a host of other things can blemish a good persons record. If he plans on checking it he wiil ask you to sign a consent---and that would be a good time to let him know your situation.|`|REC4YgOuaa	If you find a private owner and explain your situation they may be a little understanding and try to work with you. I am a landlord and have roommates that have had terrible credit, but I still rented the room to them. But out of the 6 roommates that I have had with bad credit two of them had problems paying their rent each month. One of them even went as far as going online and making fake checks from banks that didn't exist and giving to me. But it's all on the landlord that you find. So of them are understanding and some of them are not. You may end up having to pay a security deposit that they give you back after 6 months(that's only if you have paided your rent on time in that 6 month period.) Hope that helps|`|kJ4g1vujaa	It can. Some landlords do credit checks.  Some landlords want insurance to cover the rent payments and the insurance companies do a credit check.  It depends how long ago and how much debt you have left.  The fact you are making payments now should help.|`|pt6wIlS1aa	It may make a landlord decide not to rent to you. The fact that you are paying off your debts works in your favor, though. Don't make a big thing of it, but when the landlord mentions a credit check, let him know you've been working to repair your credit and it should be fine. Many, many people with bad credit still need places to live and get them.|`|sM8PKUtoaa	i dont see what credits got do do with renting|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Yes it definitely can.   You can get turned down for renting a place if they see something on your credit report they don't like.

It also depends on whether or not you choose to rent with a private landowner or if you choose to go with a rental company.  Usually landlords are more leniate.  They are more concerned with your previously rental history, as opposed to how timely you are or were with your other bills.

e44b7050fb792247b231f218559774e8aa	Well those are some crazy fees. I suggest getting a new bank. Although a dormant account may get fees.     Generally each account has certain guidelines that have to be met. Example of a couple of our interest checking accounts. One you must maintain a balance of 1500 or get a 12 dollar service fee. Another must have direct deposit or automatic bill payment or get an 8 dollar service fee.     Savings must have a minimum balance of 300 and limit of 3 withdraws per month. or 3 dollar service fee and 1 dollar per every extra withdraw.    Or as almost every bank offers a completely free no interest, no minimum balance checking account.|`|a3WTEzR6aa	My bank (Wells Fargo) does not charge me for any service charges unless we use another atm - and we never really use atm's.

Sometimes you can be good academically and get loads of qualifications but have no common sense, no initiative, no enthusiasm, no sense of responsibility - none of the things that help you get on in the workplace.   Other times the academically well-qualified choose to pursue a career that is poorly paid, because they care about their society and their world and want to use their brains to help, rather than purely to make a lot of money.

NsbGM74iaa	What a wierd question.  Im glad ive never seen questions that strange when I took Accounting courses or on the CPA exam.    Anyway to answer your question, I guess it can be argued that Firm A has a higher turnover ratio since they will have to repurchase more fixed assets sooner than Firm B will.    As far as lower fixed assets, im assuming this question is trying to make you take depreciation into account.  Obviously Firm A will show a lesser NET fixed assets number since they have been taking depreciation longer.|`|rLP9wjPtaa	A. will have a lower value in fixed assets due to much of it having been expensed to depreciation (and, presumably, bought in the past when things were cheaper).
joiacDUdaa	This is a GREAT question!      I'm a coupon user I get the Sunday paper, online coupons and checkout the local stores for rebates.  Walgreens is my store of choice it's close by and they have the monthly money-saver online so I can plan out my savings!  Walgreens uses their own coupons that you can combine with other coupons for even more savings.  They also offer 10% MORE back if you load it on a Walgreens giftcard... Easy to do online!  I get make-up, shampoo/conditioner, toothpaste etc... FREE !  Just depends on what's on sale or FREE..  I do that a lot and then with the money-back on the giftcard I've gotten refills for my computer for both blkwht/ and color refills it was about $15 for BOTH....         I also sign-up at company websites and get coupons online, in the mail etc.. Just be sure that you can use online printed coupons at your local store... I also use coupons when shopping online.  I'll find what I want and then look for online coupon codes... For example: this past christmas- I bought my children a toy giftset that normally cost $50 a piece.. I wanted one for each of them.. So, I waited and the sets went down 50%  then I looked online for some additional codes..This particular store lets you use 2 at a time.. So, I had an additional 30% off AND FREE SHIPPING  so I got BOTH sets for under $20 !   PLUS I shopped in my pj's and didn't deal with snow and people !        We also- to save money on our electric/gas etc... We turned down the thermostat to about 65 degrees and wear warmer clothing... Also we don't run two big appliances at the same time... For example:  when I do laundry I will run the washer and NOT the dryer at the same time... Instead, I'll run a load of laundry that goes in the dryer ... While the dryer is running I'm SOAKING the next load... My clothes come out cleaner/brighter.   On the same vein to save money on laundry soap I use the obvious coupons AND I use 1/2 the amount and add 1 cup of baking soda to the wash.  12 lbs. of BS costs about $4 and can be used all over the house!  So, a traditional 90 load container of laundrysoap will last me 125-150 loads... Quite a bit of savings!         We also run our dishwasher at night on time delay- so it's using HOT water and electricity in the off-peak time.  Just by NOT running all my major appliances at the same time saves roughly 50% on our electric costs.. .Our bill last year was $114.00 a month running everything together.. Now it's about $75.00 a month.. depending on if we are running out A/C or electric baseboard heat...         We also grocery shop at Bulk/discount stores.. We split our Bj's membership with another family (giving them the "spouse" card) and upgraded to the rewards card which normally is $86 but, we had a coupon for 50% off and an extra 4 months!  So, for around $40 we get 2% back of everything we purchase including the family we split with AND we get extra money-saving coupons...!  We have already gotten back over $100 so the membership has paid for itself double...         We buy meat in bulk and lucked out they had some PURDUE split chicken breasts on clearance for under $1 a lb !  Ditto with some drumsticks/thighs... So, we stocked up and saved $2-$3 a lb. !  We also bought some discounted mozarella cheese 3- 5lb. bricks for $5 a piece and used them to make all sorts of dishes.... I also buy my cleaning/laundry supplies in bulk and save a bundle.  Especially, when Bj's does it's own coupons.. For example: usually around spring they have all sorts of deals on cleaning supplies... In the Bj's coupons you can save $2 on a gallon sized windex w/ filled sprayer... Normally, it's $6.99 for the gallon/sprayer- I get coupons from SC Johnson 2- $2 off coupons for any WINDEX product.. I can use all three coupons saving $6 off the price.. I pay .99 cents for a gallon+ of WINDEX.   I also do this with PLEDGE, SCRUBBING BUBBLES, LYSOL, GLADE and AIRWICK and other household cleaners.  Or if you want to go more green.. Use vinegar, baking soda to clean the house.... I haven't gone "green"  I don't like the products!      With rebates and coupons I save an avg. of $200.00 + a month !          Pack your lunch you'll save a bundle just by brown-bagging it.. Or have a day where everyone brings a little something to share.  Drink ice-t or water instead of buying pop/snacks etc from the vending machine or going out to eat.. Make coffee at home or bring in a coffee pot to make coffee... Heat up hot water for cocoa or tea.... Just think you can save $5-$10 a DAY just by bringing things from home... You could easily save $100 or MORE a month !          Carpool with people you work with and share the expense of gas and wear n tear on vehicles... Or take public trans. whenever possible.          Instead of buying books, magazines- cd's, dvd's... Rent them or get them for FREE at the local library.  I have a friend that buys books weekly spending $20-$30 a week if not more... She also buys DVD's blu-ray ones and spends another|`|VELnLnIKaa	walk when you can rather than ride ride the bus 1 a week clip coupons rent a movie rather than go to the movies|`|M3maZgdyaa	Buy in bulk It saves money  I also bought a motorcycle.

Keep a list of items you're getting low on or are out of and take one trip into town for your shopping.    Make foods from scratch.

Grow your own vegetables this summer and learn to can.    Make your own coffee at home and skip the gas station or starbucks.    Prepare foods on days off.  Most will keep during the week, and if you prepare main course meals, you can portion them up and freeze until you need to use.

Most of the time items on sale = the bulk cost. I calculate this all the time, I call Costco and BJ's and comparison shop, make sure you're comparing apples to apples. Also I think BJ's is cheaper than Costco and it provides bigger quantities, and BJ's takes credit cards and Costco only takes Amex. I use credit cards for expense tracking and also I get points  - Clip coupons and use them!  - Sell unwanted stuff on the internet (Craigslist or try ecrater.com it is free) and make $! Or donate the stuff and take a tax deduction!  - Cut down on alcohol, it costs a ton    Your question inspired me to save $! Thanks!

Simple things like switching the lights off, taking the tv off standby, turning all electrical sockets off at night, although they sound like little things, they really help as they add up.  Use energy saving light bulbs, as they last longer so they cost you less.  Buy your food from a cheaper shop, go for cheaper brands rather than the famous ones.  Don't feel the need to shop as a cure for boredom.

Also I got a Magic Jack and you pay about $50.00 to buy it but then its only $20.00 a year after that (must have internet). You get free directory assistance and long distance etc...

Do your own repairs.  Volunteer at your job for extra work or try harder to do better work, so you don't lose your job, should your employer decide to cut back.|`|AA10925759	Also look at your phone bill if you have a landline. Usually there is a lot of stuff on there that you don't need. If your cell gives you free long distance you don't need that on your house phone.    The clothes thing is a biggie as that uses up more energy than anything else in the house by far. You can hang up the clothes until they are just slightly damp and then put them in the dryer to fluff them up.     Set your dishwasher to not heat dry after washing. That uses a lot of energy. iFyou only have a couple of things hand wash.     Your hot water heater is continuously heating water. There is a switch where you can turn that down. Most people have that set way to high. You can turn it down a tidge and still have hot water.     Things that trickle charge need to be unplugged as it adds up. I realized that I have 6 portable phones in the house drawing power even though I only really use one. I also had a couple of TVs with cable boxes plugged in that I never use. Unplug cell or laptop chargers when you are not using them.     Check the settings on your freezer and fridge. Usually people have them set to high     When you can look into your car insurance. A lot of times people have just been with one company for years and don't think about it. I looked around and found cheaper rates for the exact same coverage. I called my company and told them I was thinking about switching...... they dropped my rate then and there. Plus I don't remember what the miles are but you might get it cheaper if you drive under 25 miles or whatnot to get to work.If you have any points on your license take the quicky traffic school course and inform the insurance company.     A freind of mine who is a car guy told me to have my fuel injection checked. I did so and it was like $50. Now my car uses half the gas it did before. If you drive a nice car that says premium gas only.... not true. I researched it and also spoke to the mechanic at the dealership. If you are just doing normal driving there is no harm in using a lower grade say 3 out of 4 times.    Yes food is a major thing. Plan ahead and eat at home or take your lunch with you to work. I actually like it better to take my lunch. It gets monotinous going to the same old places anyway. People in my office are always sniffing around to see what I bring. Now everybody does it.    I find that better time wise as well. So instead of getting in the car, going to a restaurant, waiting for the food and driving back I can just sit and relax.     Store brands for food and actually some are better than the major brands. An example would be something like tomato sauce. The Safeway store brand actually has less sugar and actually tastes more like tomatoes.    Don't buy a bunch of things in boxes. When you do buy, buy in bulk as that is an investment. You can split up a huge pack of chicken and freeze it.

t5SZ1uAWaa	I would say yes, your not as bad as some, but your taking advantage of the situation.    To get working tax credits you have to work 16 hours a week, you qualify by half an hour..     Your 42, and have no kids, isnt your wife working as  you are only saying one lot of wages... and u get free housing and tax...     Sorry but you should be hanging your head in shame, your not really paying tax are you as your below the tax threshhold.. you should be working full time hours..    What really annoys me about this is, Im 42, Im disabeled with osteoarthritis and kidney problems... and I could quite easily sit on benefits and cream the state of each week quite legitimatly... but no, I get up each day and I struggle to work in pain and I work for minimum wage and i work a hell of a lot of hours each week to make sure I get a reasonable wage for my family...     Its called PRIDE, one day I might have to rely on benefits and state handouts, but while theirs any chance of me working, I will grab it with both hand... I have my own house, holidays and a good life...

Oh and at only 42 (hardly retirement age!) you can still retrain and change career to get better prospects - you have enough time to study as you don't work that much, and you'll get free courses as well as you're on benefits.    I hope one of the results of the credit crunch will be a review of the benefit systems and the minimum wage, as it's absolutely mad that you can have more money on benefits than working (that bit isn't your fault of course).|`|6aaCfPJiaa	No you work|`|66a2033899b05175e184558f79110fe4aa	unfortunatley yes  there are people with serious problems out there, who work more..  if you take state money you take money out of the mouths of other peoples childeren... just the way it is im affraid|`|65de15f23f2269f4a1cd8334a7b742f9aa	No, I don't consider you a scrounger.

You need an account in Hawaii (hopefully you have had one since when you lived there last) and to just go to the bank you use in Japan.

You would have to carry separate earthquake insurance (see CA Earthquake Authority).|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Absolutely.  YOU are responsible for the full loan amount, until the house title transfers from your name.  After it's sold at auction - regardless of damages - you're STILL responsible for the difference between the sale procedes and the loan balance.    Not only that, but if someone is hurt on the premises, while you own it, YOU ARE ON THE HOOK for the injury!  Pain & suffering, medical payments, the works.

57e2f61534cb280dd3b9f69e82a68f67aa	First observation, your real estate agent or lawyer did not adequately represent you in this closing, I would go back to either one and give them a little bite of your mind since they allowed you to be placed in this situation     In hindsight you should have never closed while the old owners where still in possession of the house period, this is basic closing procedure hence not sure why your real estate agent or lawyer allowed this to happen     Today to cover your buts, should file a thirty day notice to terminate landlord tenant relationship, absent any agreement in the closing, it maybe the only venue available to you to get them out    It will be hard after the fact i.e. the closing to demand certain monies per day or demand security deposit etc, this all should have been agreed to at closing when you held all the cards, back again to you real estate agent and attorney ,      Also remember this is your property, I would also give notice that in 24 hour you will be entering the home to video document the current condition of the house, and will hold the old owners liable for any damage caused at move out, also since its your place give proper notice that on Sunday/ Saturday you will be coming by to do some lawn work i.e. you get the picture do not make it comfortable to stay in your house, keep going by walking the property etc , which is your legal right with proper notice i.e. usually 24 notice     Talk with the police but my guess based upon this fact pattern they are going to say its a civil contract matter, and most likely now has turned into a landlord tenant situation even though you never agreed to such it maybe based upon the allowing the closing to proceeded knowing full well they where still in the house and failure to make contingency agreement at the closing of how long they would stay, amount of monies to be paid, etc    Thats why I have no idea what you paid your agent and lawyer for this type of advice|`|N7G26k4Iaa	Talk to your lawyer asap.

They could stuff you with a big interest rate if that is the case.|`|ypnWDDB8aa	And if the interest suddenly goes up? :P|`|XXIpmAL4aa	No.  Mortgage documents are locked contracts.    But credit cards have the ability to set many traps that would cause you to lose that rate and they would be ready to spring those at any time for any reason.  Late payment, even by one day, and they could jack the rate up.  There could be fine print that states they can take away that rate under a set of circumstances like your credit score dropping, or other factors.    Not worth it.
6292d9ef630e6d4aba7bd0e0e2d0d97daa	No.    The answer depends on how the property is owned.  It it is held as joint tenants with right of survivorship, then anyone alive and on the deed owns it. It could be 1 person, 2 people, etc.  For example, you and I own a property.  I die. You now own it outright.  I cannot will my share to anyone because you have the right of survivorship.    If the property is held as tenants in common, the percentage owned by the deceased person passes on to their heirs.  For example, you and I own a property. I die.  My sister becomes heir to my 50% share, and you still own your 50%. Instead of you and I owning the property, it is now owned by you and my sister.|`|N7G26k4Iaa	It depends on the state, assuming that you are in the US.  In common property states, the portion of the property owned by the decedent goes to the other owner no matter what the will says.  If it is not such a state, then the will will determine what happens to the share and the property will have to be sold to pay of the inheritor.  You really need to talk to a lawyer who works in this area to see what needs to be done.|`|AA11206283	Depends on the tennancy of the deed. In many states, Husbands and wives take title as joint tennants with a Right of survivorship or as Tenants by the entierty, in which case the remaining interest in property on the will MAY pass to the survivor outside of probate.    I'd need a lot more information here to give you more. Or call a probate lawyer; or talk to the county probate clerk|`|AA10405438	The person on the deed holds the property.  A will does not mean anything if the person on the deed is not willing to relinquish ownership.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	That's simple.  If they're on the deed with one other person they are entitled to half the property.   The person who passed away was authorized to give up only half the property, not in its entirety.|`|57e2f61534cb280dd3b9f69e82a68f67aa	In the US, the will can not override the deed; the person on the deed has all rights a deed owner maybe entitled to no matter what the will may say|`|EXJfoGtAaa	It all depends how (the two of you) held title.  If you were tenants in common then when one owner dies, his interest goes to the heirs.  If it were joint tenants with the right of suvivorship, the deceased ownership would transfer to you.    realtor.sailor|`|ZjqdLSv2aa	A will is a statement on what you would like to have done after your death and as such is not a legal contract. The person on the deed owns the property.

"Joint tenancy with survivorship" would mean the person on the deed gets the property and the heir will not get it.  "Tenancy in common" will mean that the heir gets the share of the property that the deceased used to own.    Please be careful with the advice you have received here.  All of the answers you have received are incomplete or wrong (Including mine, which is only incomplete:) ).  There are many responses here that are flat wrong.  Best to see an attorney if it's a big worry for you.    It gets better after this answer.  A couple of the later responses are okay too.|`|Ns6I7MmBaa	Confusing question.  A will only applies to something someone owns.  If that person is not on the deed, the will would not apply to it.  If that person is listed on the deed, it depends how the deed is worded.  If they are listed on it with you as "tenants in common", the will would only apply to their share, and you would still have the same rights you had for your share.    If both names are on the will as "tenancy by the entireties" or "joint tenancy with rights of survivorship", the will would not apply, and it would be split among remaining owner(s) on the deed.    Note that if there are any liens on the property from that person before it was transferred to you (like from a loan), such liens would still apply.

Has he offered a new lease?  If you give notice, then he might fix stuff but if not, you can ensure that you will get your deposit back on time.|`|AA11988604	In most cases, if you have not explicitly agreed to renew the lease, it either expires on the date stated on the lease, or it automatically converts to a month to month lease.  You have to read your lease to know which version you have.   Normally the best thing to do is send a certified letter with return receipt to your landlord telling them that you understand your lease is up at the end of February and you intend to move out.  That gives you evidence in court that you provided notice in a timely manner.  But since February has 28 days this year and its already Jan 29th, you don't have a full 30 days to provide notice, so I wouldn't do that this year, just in case your lease requires 30 days notice.    As a practical matter, if your lease says it expires on Feb 28th and your landlord has not contacted you to renew, they are not very well organized, and you shouldn't have a problem just moving out on or before the last day of the lease.  clean your apartment and be assertive with the landlord about getting your deposit back and all should be okay.|`|rHhtn7plaa	just tell them your not renewing the lease cause they won't fix anything and you can't live there no more like that .|`|EXJfoGtAaa	Read your lease and Google landlord tenant laws in your state.

M3maZgdyaa	They only have to pay you for the actual hour that you worked. It might be time to look for another job or a part time one to fill in the needed hours. Then let your 1rst job know what hours you can give them.    EDIT: You are paid an hourly wage. You keep referring to a contract. What they did was to agree to hire you at an hourly rate and in the hiring package it stated your overtime pay if you worked overtime. All salery workers (Under contract) are paid for 40 hours a week no matter how many hours they work there is not any overtime because they have a contract. They also collect full pay even if they don't work 40 hours. Since your job does not pay you in this manner you are not "under contract".|`|2N6oTOLQaa	If you actually have a written contract signed by your boss that promises you, in writing, that you will be working a minimum number of hours, then they must honor that contract until they notify you in writing that they are changing it.    If you are simply on a verbal agreement that you work 40 hours per week they are free to cut your hours at anytime. I'd imagine that if you raise a big stink about this you'll soon be unemployed, it sounds like they have more employees than they need right now anyway.     Its standard to allow someone the option to cash out their vacation pay when their hours are cut. This is their way of giving you an option to keep your paychecks coming in at the same amount. If you choose not to take this option, they don't have to pay you for time you didn't actually work.    As far as overtime pay, they do actually have to pay you if you work over 40 hours in a week. I think what they said is that overtime is no longer allowed, which means if you hit 40 hours for a week, you aren't allowed to work anymore that week.|`|IHzv611caa	I don't know about the contracted hours, but I was always under the impression that overtime pay was a legal thing, and that they were required to pay that if they work you. I'm not really sure though.|`|0KVws6REaa	They are exactly that, contracted.  If they rota you fewer hours they must still pay you the contracted rate.

2xO8AxYRaa	This is how it works. When you file bankruptcy creditors must go in and erase the balance due and in the remark field put in discharge in bankruptcy (7 or 13). This will stay on your credit report for 7 years (7 years from time of update). Under public record the fact that you filed bankruptcy will be listed and this will stay on for 10 years.    What some do not understand is, (it used to be this way but in to days economy its not so likely) most people who filed bankruptcy received credit almost immediatly after getting out of bankrutpcy, because creditors know they can not file bankruptcy again for a while. So all that think that filing bankruptcy is bad for your credit trust me its not.|`|MxHRjPFHaa	yes it will be there but wont count against you...     but after you file you cant buy anything for 7 years ...You got to use cash|`|AA12340941	Yes it will stay on there for 7 - 10 years.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Bankruptcy does not erase your credit history, it simply cancels your debts.

The accounts will show for 7-years and the bankruptcy will show for 10 if it's a chapter 7 and 7 if it's a chapter 13.

AA11284831	Since you are married you cannot file as Single.    You can file a joint return with your non-resident alien spouse if he agrees to be treated as a resident and be subject to US taxation on his world wide income.  If he agrees you must attach a joint signed statement to this effect to every joint return that you file.  If he paid any foreign income taxes on his earnings you can claim a credit for the foreign income taxes paid using Form 1116.    Since he does not have an SSN he will need to apply for an ITIN in order to file a joint return.  Attach a completed Form W-7 along with apostilled copies of his proof of ID to the first joint return and mail the entire package to the Austin, Texas Service Center.  (Leave his SSN field blank on the return.)  They will process the ITIN, apply it to the return, and then process the return.  Allow 14 to 16 weeks total processing time.    If he does not agree to be treated as a resident and be subject to US taxation then you must file Married Filing Separately unless you are otherwise qualified to file as Head of Household.  Your spouse cannot be the qualifying person for HoH filing status though.  If he had no gross income you may claim his personal exemption but will need to secure an ITIN in this case.  See the procedure above.  If you do not claim his personal exemption then he does not need an ITIN.  Just write "N R A" in his SSN field in this case.|`|ETeWLHEGaa	you should file it married cause your technically married

DGFu03Q3aa	Dear Dick:  If you look at the IRS tax tables for $38,000 you will see $4901 and $21,000 equals $2351. Now add 38 and 21 to get $59,000 and the tax table shows $8051 due. You can see by this example the tax table has a different % built in as you make more money and your W4 can not compensate for this when you have two incomes. To compensate for this you will need to change your W4 to have an additional amount withheld each paycheck.    These figures are for illustration purposes and I know you do not pay tax on your gross income i.e. $38 and $21.    This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provide. Click on my profile to read more.   Errol Quinn  Enrolled Agent   Master Tax Advisor|`|AA10469473	Sometimes the withholding tables don't work very well for a married couple who both have an income unless one of the incomes is very small.  Try changing the W-4's to "married but withhold at the higher single rate" on at least yours, if not both.|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	The problem is that by both claiming Married on Form W-4, two Standard Deductions of $10,900 were figured into the withholding calculations.  You are only entitled to one Standard Deduction when you file so this cuts deeply into the withholdings.    That actually worked out almost perfectly in your case though.  The goal is NOT to receive a large refund at filing time but to come as close to break-even as possible.  A large refund is just an interest-free loan from you to the government for up to a year or more.  You get smaller paychecks during the year and NO benefit in exchange!    Note:  Your mortgage interest and property taxes are not enough to warrant itemizing.  Unless your itemized deductions exceed the Standard Deduction of $10,900 you should NOT itemize.|`|fKwkTkxnaa	I don't think either of your employers withheld enough.  I also claim zero and made just under 29k but paid 2420.01 just to federal.  My spouse claims 1 and made just under 15k and paid 808.52 to federal.  I would check with my employers to make sure they are withholding enough.  I'd also get a second opinion we were once told we had to pay into federal about 400.00 by an H&R Block agent but my brother redid them with the same info on Turbo Tax and we got $600.00 back.
VvPJkjjZaa	Havent they bailed banks out?    As for businesses they set up a new helpline called the business payment support line http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pbr2008/business-... so they are giving businesses longer to pay tax and the chance to pay up tax without the fear of legal action or penalties|`|0e6dbae94ebf31677d30c3c898c470afaa	My simple answer is: Too much.    If someone makes a gamble down at the bookies, they lose their money. If a bank does the same thing, they get bailed out by the government ... maddening.

e1jgTlEMaa	It will definitely vary based on the business line / industry.  But at a high level, business support managers ensure that the goals and objectives of the company, as outlined by senior management, are implemented.      The business support manager will usually have a team of people to work with in order to accomplish the goals.  The role could involve working internally as well as with external clients.  Some degree of experience is usually necessary.    Good luck!
e98af447d889fc4d0fa1016941966d10aa	Versus a respiratory therapist, a technician works with the therapist doing certain breathing treaments and some teaching of patients. If you wish to become an "RT" for short (respiratory therapist) schooling is a bit longr ad more in depth. There are state boards as well as certifications in this area as well. I have worked with them closely in the ER and on the floors. You will have a strong knowledge base.
Dv43MoGaaa	The IRS is all screwed up this year...I called the IRS this morning and the lady that I talked to said that they have no idea why the date changed (I have the same message as you), she went on to tell me that the 10th is the lastest I should expect to get my refund.  I am keeping my fingers crossed that I get it in the morning but I am not going to hold my breath on it.|`|DAMZKbpDaa	How does it work? Right now, it isn't working. Try the refund cycle sheet, http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p2043.pdf|`|AHyDHombaa	I think the money will be sent on the 6th as said on the refund cycle chart, but they are allowing a few days so that the funds can clear the the taxpayer's bank.|`|8nanMoLsaa	Once it gets close to the actual date which you are saying the 10th, it will tell you that you'r money will be direct deposit on that Friday before the 10th which is the 6th. They normally add this leeway. But they will be depositing it on the 6th. Mine was scheduled for the 2nd and then it changed yesterday to 30th, today I called my bank and they said that I already have the direct deposit from IRS "pending" and it will reflect on my account tomorrow. Good Luck to you.|`|Fbxiwvohaa	WMR has been having lots of problems.  Yesterday mine showed that it had deposited on the 23rd and that I should contact them if it was not showing by the 28th (which it of course was not showing).  In reality it is to be deposited on Friday the 30th.      I and lots of other people have flooded the IRS with calls about the discrepancies.  They have said they are having issues with the system.  I would recommend calling the IRS and talking to a person.  They can better answer your question.

I'm not denying there are less and less jobs out there. I think it's hard to get a job because employers are looking for ways to be cheap, as well as to cut labor but keep the same tasks needing completion (i.e. fewer people doing all the work), and have ridiculous standards. That just adds to what's going on with the economy. You have more people competing for the same jobs, so employers can get away with their craziness right now. Those "normal low paying" jobs you mention? Yeah, people with college and graduate degrees will have those.     In Memphis, where I currently live, the main issue is this is never really a great place for employment, period, unless you want to do jobs like McDonald's, Dollar Store, the mall and crap like that. The best job here generally will be being an executive assistant, i.e. secretary, and even then they want you to have 5-7 years work experience as one to be that. It has always been hard to have a real career here.
2c3rcQRbaa	With cashier's checks the sky is the limit.  You get those at banks.  With money orders the max is $1000.00.  Money orders you can get pretty much anywhere.  But I would suggest the post office since you need to mail it anyway.  No sense in making a separate trip!|`|AA12284392	I'm going to guess somewhere around $500, but it's probably a lot higher.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Don't go to the post office. Go to your bank and ask for a cashier's check. They write the check out to the person you specify, in the amount you specify and hand it to you. Then you'd take the check to the post office and mail it to them.     Note, some banks charge a fee for a cashier's check but it varies by bank.     There's no maximum amount, its only limited by the amount in your account. What the bank will do is remove the amount of the check from your available balance to ensure that the check clears.|`|64eba52b7a7dcdb30b1e7b1223d7eb33aa	9999999999999999999999999999999999999999... dollars|`|kqnaqakLaa	i think 500|`|CZFcH1ykaa	$5000.00 at least at every bank I've used.

However, if all you want to do is complain that the refund isn't in your account yet, you won't be happy with the answer.    It can take 2-3 weeks to process an efiled return.  It hasn't been 3 weeks yet.    If your tax return listed anything on the rebate recovery credit and you got a check last year for the full amount, you caused the delay as the IRS is manually reviewing returns that asked for more than the IRS expected you to get.

AA10469473	Obviously what he has done is illegal.  As to last year, don't know what happened since the IRS should have it straightened out by now.  Sounds like you did all the right things.  For last year, since it's still hanging, I'd call the Tax payer Advocate office at 877-777-4778.  For this year, with any luck your visit to the IRS office will set things on the right track.    Good luck.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	BTW, I'm am hoping you a merely guessing how your ex-filed and not that the HRB person pulled up his return and read it to you.

Step 2) Contact the IRS and let them know exactly what has happened.    Step 3) Talk to H&R Block and let them know that your ex has knowingly given them false information.    You should be able to get your money, and with any luck, your ex will be sitting in a jail cell for tax fraud.    If he makes any threats to you - contact the police and report him.    Good luck!!

dC6A5R5Saa	I had a look at airlines, both charts and financial statistics, and I wasn't impressed.  Many airlines in 2008 including UAUA made loses and LUV's profit was a lot less in 2008 than 2007.  None of them are even listed in the S&P500 and they don't pay dividends.    If you really have an interest airlines, why not invest in a profitable company that all these airlines depend on:      BOEING (BA) : http://www.boeing.com/companyoffices/abo...    http://www.boeing.com/companyoffices/fin...    BA is one of the 30 companies listed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.    Over the last five years BA has consistently increased its dividend.    Made 2.684 billion net profit in 2008|`|JsHG73v9aa	I have followed United (UAUA) for quite a while now. With the price of fuel down, their stock price has varied between $10-$12 and is holding steady. I have made a lot of money with Covered Calls on them because of the range-bound price. However, I would not want to advise anyone to invest long-term in any airline with the exception (maybe) of Southwest (LUV).|`|AA10259042	Airlines are not the greatest investment opportunities but since you asked you might possibly consider LUV,  although I would not.|`|wIZNsqG1aa	Airlines are very risky and have never really performed well. So at this point you best stocks would be in resources or alternative energy.|`|zI2KS0HOaa	Over the long haul, airlines have proven to be among the worst investments around.  Investigations have shown that the industry as a whole has lost money, not just recently but for all time.     Also, the financial downturn will mean lower bookings, a price war, and thus lower profitability for an industry that can't seem to make a profit.    However, in terms of business and financial operations, Southwest (LUV) is the best-run of the bunch.  They have been profitable throughout their 36 years.|`|4gMdp2nwaa	Airlines in the long run have never made money. Competition has always run each company out there into some sort of trouble at least.    So much of the industry depends on fuel prices since that is really the major component in how an airline will perform. Equipment, employee costs and the rest of it are fairly fixed costs. Unless you can accurately predict the direction of fuel prices in the long run it will be hard to predict how a company will do.    I personally don't like the volatility of oil prices so I'd stay away from airlines - even if I think one airline has a competitive advantage over another.

e059dcbf3dff565e26421b37773f7e1eaa	Great question, however you need to clarify. If you are saving for something in particular, like college, then a state sponsored 529 plan may be more beneficial. Right now is the perfect time to open UGMA (Uniform Gift to Minors Accounts) held in brokerage. The market is very volatile and big swings equal big gains for your kids. Savings accounts aren't paying much right now because the federal funds rate (the rate at which banks borrow from the feds) is a quarter percent. Your current bank more than likely has a $50/month minimum to start investing for your childeren. Let's suppose you deposit $50/month into an investment account and it averages 7%. Over 15 years you would have contributed $9,000.00 and it would have grown to just under $16,000.00. I believe the market is going to produce more than that, but I'm being conservative to illustrate a point. The 50 year average for savings accounts is just under 3%. The 50 year average for investment accounts is just under 12%.    Cheers!
AA11284831	Gambling winnings are gambling winnings and must be reported regardless of the amount, whether taxes are withheld or not.    You may deduct gambling losses up to the amount of your winnings as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Schedule A.  This is not subject to the 2% limitation that applies to most miscellaneous deductions though.  To claim the deduction you must have meticulous records.  Records can include receipts, player's card statements, betting slips, etc.  For cash gambling you must keep a detailed diary of all gambling activity including casino, track or gambling parlor name, dates and times, machine or table number, and detailed records of all gambling sessions.  This is a high audit potential item so be sure that your records are complete and accurate.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	You can claim gambling losses up to the amount of your winnings if you itemized deductions.

Lrb8uVh9aa	I think it would be best to have a think about which you prefer- art/design or writing. Of course you can keep them both as a hobby but it might be difficult to find a course, or a job, that combines the two, so once you've decided which direction to go in, the choice about courses and jobs will be easier.  You could try to arrange some work experience in both industries to decide which you prefer.   You might also want to consider doing an art foundation course (you might need to do one anyway in order to get into art school). They usually only last a year, and if you decide at the end of that year that you'd prefer to focus on writing, then you haven't wasted too much time, and it will be good experience if you choose to go down the art route.  I would recommend choosing the course based on what you love, and making job choices later- I think it will become more obvious once you've had more experience.

The IRS is so mired down with their own rules and regulations, they can't make clear decisions on anything related to tax matters.  Ask any IRS agent a tax question and they'll give you 2-3 answers.

sKto5Hucaa	I filed on the 16th was accepted on the 19th. It said I would get dd by 1/30 then it changed to 2/3 and stayed like for that for a few days then last night I checked it and it said 2/24 yeah Im freaking out so Im on the phone holding for an IRS rep right now, I will let you know what I found out...|`|GvGcIC6Waa	You may want to call them because according to them it is fixed ...|`|8sCIIx5Gaa	Well i was to expect my refund by the 3rd also and until this morning i was ok. But now due to processing delays it says feb 24. I mean thats a long way away. Has anyone else recieved this scary note...|`|AA11555162	Those who have the recovery rebate coming appears to have their refunds delayed.
GvGcIC6Waa	If you are supposed to receive your deposit on the 30th, you should be able to see it pending in your bank account today (or you can call your bank to see if it is pending). I am able to see mine and so are others who are scheduled to receive their deposits tomorrow.    Unless your date says the it was deposited on the 23rd and you should receive it the 28th (the problem that the majority of the people were having yesterday) than the new dates they are giving you are probably accurate.    As of last evening, the "glitch" was supposedly fixed ...|`|TTpRZOdVaa	I am also seeing a changed date, when I called the IRS yesterday the rep said according to the chart I should be receiving it on Jan 30th.  I asked if she could see saw a definite date and she said no.  I don't understand how she couldn't see a definite date of deposit.  She also claimed it was a glitch, I think that is a scam.|`|Y0ki95Pwaa	no it is not fixed, but it is not a problem with the irs themselves just with their website and the refund hotline. i spoke with an irs rep yesterday and she said that my dd would be jan 30tha nd sorry for the inconvience of the website and hotline
bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	Probably not...just filling out their application should be enough for that position.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	No.   But if you have prior cashier experience note that on the application
eY005pu8aa	If your refund amount says x dollars then you would get x dollars. But don't count on the date. And if you were in any way dishonest or if you exaggerated expenses, etc, on your return then you could get audited, which would hold things up a lot longer.|`|VXkOZ4rEaa	You will get the refund amount that is shown on WMR unless you owe backtaxes or child support or student loan they wont just send you a portion they will send the full amount|`|lkLKx6v3aa	back loans dont really count. As long as you dont owe back taxes or child support you should receive the payment even a couple days sooner than they are telling you, and yes you should get the whole amount as long as you do not owe taxes or child support.|`|5Ks5kEKZaa	Back loans do count they will offset your refund.  If you owe student loans they will take the whole thing if they have too.
NncP5z24aa	It's the same glitch that we were all having yesterday. Check with your bank tomorrow morning. They should be able to tell you if it is at least pending. Mine is pending right now. Hope that helps. :)|`|AA12340941	Oh no, I hope that doesn't happen to me.  I will have to check because mine is due on the 30th as well.  I e-filed on the 13th.|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	The WMR tool is broken.  Just be patient.|`|8sCIIx5Gaa	Mine got changed today also yesterday it was the 3rd and today its the 24th.. one lady i talked to said high eic-ctc and rebate claims are being reviewed manualy so i dont know what to say but gl. i have the eic and ctc but no rebate and my brother has the rebate and no eic and his changed to the 24th as well so maybe this is the case|`|WYzVw19Uaa	OMG we haven't filed yet but need our Refund ASAP ON TIME!!!  if anybody gets theirs tomorrow even so it said delayed to February XX let us know|`|ACekh5iTaa	Crazy.. Crazy...Crazy!!  We filed on 1/12 and was denied RAL on the 16th. We were then told by the IRS we should expect a deposit on 1/30, Nope!!!  What confuses me is some of you are getting your IRS update & finding out your deposit date has changed, mine has not. Today when I checked the IRS website my deposit date still showes 1/30. I don't know if that's a good thing or bad. According to the H&R block update the IRS is experiencing delays and for those expecting a deposit on 1/30 will now get the deposit on 2/2 or 2/3. Oh, this whole thing with the IRS only doing deposits on Fridays is not true. The IRS dose the deposits in batches at anytime. Banks are telling this to people because in the day to day business world the ACH are done on fridays or the company's payday. This process has nothing to do with the IRS.  Yes, I am an Accountant. However, when it comes to the IRS nothing makes sence.  like my mom says," Don't count your chicken before they hatch"...Whatever!!|`|5VQEgNtwaa	Yes same message.I filed on 1/16 was accepted 1/18 and for a week had gotten the message I would get it by 2/3 on WMF.Then overnight it changed to the should receive it by 2/24.  And to all the generic quoters here just to leave any answer to get their 2 points no I do not owe child support and no I do Owe on a student or government loan.And no I don't owe back taxes either.|`|M9Wv50rTaa	Honestly I wouldn't count on anything. I filed on the 17th was approved the 20th. First it said 1/23 then said 1/30 then 2/3 now 2/10 and when I called the IRS it also said 2/10. I went through Turbo Tax and used SBBT, SBBT has no record of a deposit and it is the 29th. I have heard that the IRS had a computer glitch but we would still get it on the 30th, apparently even the IRS has no idea when we will get our refunds.     Good news though, they are depositing everyday instead of just Fridays....if you believe them.|`|YXCOYlwnaa	ok so I got the weird message from SBBT this morning and my date on the irs site was switched to the 10th this morning as well. I talked to the IRS who said they are being instructed to tell people who efiled that they will receive their refunds 3 weeks from the time they filed. Also being told that there is a computer glitch going on. The tax office I filed through hasnt received any info from the irs except that people who claimed the recovery rebate are having some delays, but that wasnt me. I called SBBT and they said they still show my ACH date is set for tomorrow....my return was accepted on the 22nd. I dont know whats going on but the IRS isnt very helpful and they will not transfer me to a supervisor (who would probably know more). My tax preparer says that the people who answer the phones at the IRS are pretty much average joe customer service reps who dont know more than they're told. My tax guy is looking into it. I am like alot of people on here, single mom, everything riding on receiving this money tomorrow...if anyone gets any new answers please let me know?|`|ZtHQUpe1aa	If anyone gets any updated information, please post it.  I was supposed to get mine tomorrow as well, but the Where's My Refund has changed overnight to say there are processing delays and I will not get it until 2/24.|`|lqkgzFmMaa	I got the same...supposed to get it January 30...then FEB 3, now Feb. 24....why didnt they just hold the EIC portion of the refund if thats what this delay is about(I googled why they are supposedly delayed)....this sucks
49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	Yes, if the lender agreed to a short sale they gave him a time limit to find a buyer.  They will not do anything during that time limit as long as he is making payments.    If he is not paying them they continue to ding his credit, but not foreclose.|`|AA11206283	If all the lenders agree to go forward with a short sale agreement, that by definition supersedes a foreclosure action.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	That is the whole idea of a short sale.  But the lender must agree to it to stop a foreclosure.
wQJBFcluaa	You don't have to pay the RAL fees but you have to pay H & R's preparation and filing fees.  As for doing it yourself and saving money yes you are right.H & R didn't let people know how many were being turned down this year for RAL's and RAC's and mislead people into thinking they would get them.Why?So they could file your taxes and collect their overpriced prep and filing fees.They know you can't file again yourself or with another preparer after they file for you.You got Crooked.H & R Crook.    Edit  yes it is H&R Crooks fault travelguruette.They knew full well most RAL's were being declined this year and led people to think they would get them by filing with them.Do you ever "think" before posting your sub-generic 2 point answers?You seem like you don't even know what an RAL is.|`|AA11132354	Well, you should be saving some money by not getting the RAL and not paying the interest.  The IRS would normally return your refund within 8-15 days from receipt.  When you were denired by the bank, it turned into an assisted refund where Block collects your refund, takes out their fees and a bank fee, and then delivers the rest to you.  Approval is NOT automatic and you SHOULD have been so informed.  Chances are you owe back taxes, back child support, delinquent student loans, or owe Block's bank from prior year.  Or your refund was entirely EIC--from government not you-- and you had no withholding, or below a set amount.  Call the bank and they will tell you why your RAL was denied.  Block can give you phone  .  Certainly you could have prepared your own taxes and saved yourself the tax preparation and efiling fees, but it is TOO LATE now, as the IRS has accepted your return.|`|cTpbr0Znaa	i'm in the same situation,only with jackson hewitt.i feel ripped off! now the irs says2/10,and the preparers say 2/6.i'm anticipating my bank account will reflect tommorow,if not i look foward to next week. so join me in the waiting game. i need my money NOW is the only reson these people lure us into these offices.so keep ya head up it's OURS they go to pay us.|`|AA11555162	It is not Block or JH fault. The IRS was delaying refunds for everyone with the recovery rebate and there was no way they could have known. The RAL's were giving you everything but the rebate which would come later. If you do not get it then you will not pay the RAL fees.
8nanMoLsaa	Who said that you'll have it on the 6th? When did you file your return? If the IRS site said that it's schedule for 30th more than likely you will have it tomorrow. You can actually call your bank today and see if you have any pending deposit coming. I had mine scheduled for tomorrow and I called my bank and they told me that YES I have a pending deposit and I will have it by tomorrow or tonight at 12:00AM.
4ZNl4V3Oaa	If your Federal refund was offset for unpaid child support your state refund most likely will be as well.    Your State refund can be offset for unpaid state taxes of any type.  Generally it cannot be offset for a private debt with the occasional exception of certain medical debts.
Zgs4RncIaa	Any interest paid on a student loan is a deductible on your taxes. I graduated 4 yrs ago and still claim the interest.
49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	They have to keep them on file for however long your states SOL is.    But they never have to give you a copy, they are the personal property of the complex.|`|fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	They are not required to keep a copy once your tenancy has ended
zpmXGZsCaa	Unfortunately, you'll either need a co-signer or a private loan, and either will require you to know someone who trusts you.       BTW, $17,000 is a lot of money for a used car.  There are plenty of good used cars available for $3000 - $5000.  Why not get something that will be much more affordable?      I think you should find someone who knows about cars, a mechanic for instance, and have them look for you or at least look over what you find.      Some auto repair shops have cars for sale that are good mechanically and reasonably priced.  Also, your local newspaper, thrift ads, and Craigslist will yield better bargains than used car lots.|`|N956bVxhaa	get a cheaper car - go ahead and report me|`|AA10279901	Why the HELL would go go for such an expensive car?  No.  DOn't.  Get a 98 lexus or a 90s Honda or something.|`|UgyI5uB0aa	ok, repost....     honestly, if you're looking for a place that will give you a loan with no credit requirements,  at the moment I'd try anything owned by GM  hahahaha|`|kyBZhNMpaa	Your not going to be able to get a loan for that much based on your income (and thats if you could show proof). The payments would be $400 with a good rate but since you have poor credit your looking closer to $600.     I worked for one of those "in house" dealers for a couple of years. I left because I got sick of seeing good people ripped off. 2nd chance lenders are no better. They charge over 21%, some will charge for comp insurance (which you still have to have liability), there are also the ones who put those starter interupters in your car so if your 5 days late your car won't start. 2nd chance lenders will call you non-stop and will repo your car within 30 days of a late payment. With larger banks if there is a problem they are more willing to work with you by giving payment extentions, 2nd chance lenders will not.    Your also going to need a large down payment. Best bet is to buy you a cheap car and use the money you would put towards payments to fix your credit.|`|BQTiRS25aa	Below is the site for your reference:|`|FFNIThIcaa	buildcredit.ifastnet.com - try this service to boost you credit score before getting loan. After credit repair you can get the loan with minimal interest rate.|`|mYhuGonfaa	Horrible idea from the start. Buy a 2-3000 dollar car from the ads in the newspaper. I understand your car is old, and you need a new one, but when you are in financial trouble, you need to buy what you can afford with cash and wait until you have a more steady income to buy a nicer car. You will probably find a car lot that'll accept your credit, but you will end up with a high payment and insane interest rate, meaning you will pay only minimum each month and end up paying double or triple what you originally want to pay for the car. Cars are the WORST investment to make because they lose value so quickly. If you are going for a loan of any type, buy a house, that is a good asset. Good luck and make the right decision.|`|miVegGIPaa	It should really save you hassle to just get an auto loan estimate online to verify what the going rates are.  You might be really happy.  Also if your credit is not good, a lot of them are more able to work with people.

Yeah, it's not going to get you any hot dudes/chicks, but I'd much rather NOT have a car payment.    There is almost no chance that you will get approved anyway without legal proof of work. This is especially true today.|`|cUDUrGyBaa	you could go to a car and credit lot and look at their cars...i think you have to pay them every 2 weeks though. also have you tried different banks...ot credit unions for preapproval on a loan for a car?? credit unions are usually better...i got a loan for my car through a credit union and with declining credit [which i am in the process of trying to sadly fix now]     and for what your doing with the credit cars DO NOT. i promise youthat doesnt help...it only hurts your credit and it doesnt build because it doesnt show you as making payments when you just pay it all off...get one credit card..buy something for like $20 and then make monthly payments on that..sounds ridiculous but thats truly how it works...i know this from banks and credit unions..they will both tell you thats the way to go.    also have you tried talking to different car dealerships because they usually give you the loans through themselves.

Is there anything you like and passionate about. If not, then I'd suggest some tips below. I'm going to break this down to products and then later on what you love doing...:    1. Find out by researching online, the market that is making money. Now, you maybe into clothes, but clothes can be quiet a wide range. So it might be sports clothes, it might be lingeria, it might be something else.    2. Look at the one you want and see if the market is making money. See how much and if it is an opportunity enough for you to go into or it's not making money.    3. If it is making money, then study the keywords people use to find these products and services. Because I would advice to set up your business online and it be using keywords to attract people to you, using different skills like Pay Per Click. Or free advertising.    4. Now, let's say you found products that make money. You're sure, you've done your market research. Ok, now you create a blog with YOUR NAME not company name.     Get photos too. Because people want to know who you are, who they are buying from at a later date. People don't buy products but emotions, and that means.."you, your name, your authority, knowledge."    5. Now, you got a blog, start writing about that particular market and do so not by sales pitch but give tips, how to articles. If your product is nutrition then talk about free radicals, health, how eating fruits and veg is good for you, what scientists said, etc etc. practical stuff of how to.    6. People then see you an authority on what you speak and know, if they buy a product, from your blog, they know they can come and ask questions.     That's why you have comment box, and even put some google connect gadgets for people to review your blog, leave comments.      Now, second part. Let's say above is not you and you want to do something you love doing. You have a passion.    1. read up more on this passion and have knowledge. Become an expert in this field.    2. Create an ebook of 10 pages that is laid out professionally, broken with images, and valuable on the topic you're an expert as.    3. This will lead to your bigger book or course, teaching what you're pasionate about.    4. How do you get people to the first ebook though? From your blog?    How do people come to your blog. There are different ways and I teach quiet a lot but one of them is creatine a capture page.    Then have a form on that capture page which people can fill in their details to recieve your free 10 page report to gain knowledge they need.    5. They fill in that form, they get the ebook mailed to them. Now you can later direct them to your blog because in that ebook is a link to your blog.    Lots of strategies but the question is..    a) Do you want to do something you love doing?    b) Do you want to do something you have to learn from start?    I think (a) is a good idea and you got knowledge and people may want that know, and buy it too.    If you need more help on what I am sharing then just pm. Be Glad to share more info.    Good luck and hope you find what you're looking for.
wQJBFcluaa	The IRS doesn't send your W2's to you,your employer does.Ask your employer about the W2.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	they don't come from the irs the come from your employers!|`|htSZsds7aa	your employer must mail them by Jan 31st....if u are using HR Block u can use your last pay stub for 2008 to file until u get the w-2 in the mail
oKFAt7Lsaa	There are two state pensions the Basic state pension and the second state pension. You are allowed to opt out of the Second state pension and instead of paying money to the government you get a private pension and pay them the amount of money you normally pay the government.  Its difficult to say which scheme is better as you may not retire for some time if you are young and things change over time.(like financial advice)  However the government has a black hole when it comes to pensions and any money you pay in to the government scheme is spent to pay existing pensioners. In the future when you retire the new workers will pay for your pension but as the ratio of workers to retired is changing with more pensioners than ever before the burden of tax will increase for the future generations.The government may reduce the amount payable to pensioners in the future who knows but in a private pension scheme the money paid in is attributed to your pension when you retire.Pension schemes invest money in property and stocks and shares and if they perform poorly your final pension may not be as much as you thought is was.  Who knows what will happen in 25- 30 years time if its that long before you come to retirement age ????
N7G26k4Iaa	If you cannot get hold of anyone handling the business unwind, you have to wait until February 15th and contact the IRS.  You will need to fill in a form, 4852 and take it from there.

You don't need to be a fancy stock analyst to make intelligent investment choices - you just need to know the baiscs.  Don't rely on "experts."|`|WwXrTQgaaa	Join a local investment club, if available.    Caution - when investing comes up in conversation, you will hear many myths and falsehoods. People love to -think- they understand investing, the markets and the economy, but in reality very few do, and very few can offer good advice.    Like automobiles and computers, investing is one of the most misunderstood, yet talked about topics.|`|QikvnTnqaa	personally, i would just save it in a savings account. the stock market isn't much of a good idea right now.     You could put it into a CD (Certificate of Deposit) at the bank. It's (basically) like a savings account for however long you say you'll leave it in and it gets high interest. But you can't touch the money untell the times up or you will get "fined" and take a lot of the money back. That or just a regular savings account I think would be your best bet right now. :)

The IRS uses a "presence" test based on the number of days in the US.

Your choice.|`|a78860b2cdf2c89664191c16471d2353aa	You can file as married filing jointly (MFJ) or married filing separately. In most cases, it is better to file as MFJ.

Only thing, I haven't added mortgage interest or property tax because I am not sure if you live in house or not.  You also can claim for going to college, supplies on your taxes to get refund.  If you need to get your tax calculator go to https://www.taxbrain.com/taxcalculator/d... or go to TurboTax.com.  Good Luck!|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Let's see.  You made $24000.  MFJ.  2 kids.

So even with income, Married zero on a biweekly paycheck can have quite a bit of income and still withhold zero.|`|AA10469473	With three kids, you won't owe any income tax.

If you didn't, you'll owe tax on that for self-employment tax for social security and medicare even though you won't owe and income tax.

a5b6eaf1e6e065c5886203f517c6f330aa	Mine is still the same message for almost 48hrs now....     The IRS issues refund deposits each Friday, so your delayed deposit may not arrive until the following Friday. You may visit www.irs.gov to check the status of your refund.    The IRS did not deposit funds to your account as originally expected. The IRS usually makes refund deposits within 9 to 16 days, but your deposit was not received within that period of time. At times the IRS will delay a refund deposit by one week, so you may check back at this site seven days from now. If no deposit is made by then, you should contact the IRS. For more information on the status of your refund, we recommend you visit the IRS website at www.irs.gov and select the "Where's My Refund?" link. Thank you.    Mine was originally for RAL but got denied so i have no other choice but to wait for SBBT for my funds to be forwarded to WACHOVIA.|`|MkD4tBBqaa	I can't see mine yet.

Pjm9pg7iaa	Do not prepare for the interview. The interviewer has heard all of the "prepared" answers and will not appreciate hearing them from you. Just go in with a positive attitude. Answer honestly. If you don't know the answer, say "I need to think about that for a minute".  They will ask you about your previous jobs.  About your desire to work.  About why you picked their company.  Are you available for different shifts.
ScaAyzKHaa	Study whatever you want, whatever you think plays to your strengths. For most people, what you get a degree in has absolutely nothing to do with the job you get upon graduating (unless it's in the science/medical fields), employers just want to see you've put in the effort of getting a degree. If you want to work with non-profits, see if the colleges you're looking into offer a Cultural Resource Management degree program. It basically covers a lot of business management stuff, in combination with a concentration in a subject of your choice that would help you to work in a non-profit.|`|RDzDkVSAaa	a teacher or a nurse|`|6t76bgS3aa	it sounds like you like a lot of things.  that's good so do i ... trucks, jim beam, fishing lol.  but you want me to give you some useful advice so here it is -- do what you do for fun, do what you like best and make that your career.  what kind of websites do you go to, what would you read about first if you read a newspaper.  and also try things, get involved in something and see if you like it.  if you want to know what it's like to be a doctor maybe volunteer in a clinic.

Specifically, what kind of humanitarian work?  You will earn income, of course .... but it depends on what you do.  Working for the UN is decent enough, as is working with most international organizations.  If your on the ground work with african or asian organizations, then don't expect much money at all.    Good luck and please don't give up on this world or sell out (I'm ashamed to say that I have and it's too late for me to go back!)|`|d4af98bef4634072715e0b3c20d8beefaa	Social work. Teaching or engineering even as well as law or medicine. When you do humanitarian work you do it for the love not money. You could get into being an investment banker and make lots of money and give it to charity. An engineer could help design a power plant etc.
AA12116276	You sound like me. I love computers and know more than a lot of people who work in the field, but I would probably never be able to get through the curriculum. I looked at the Comp Sci curriculum when I was considering going back to school and said "HELL NO." Looking at Information Technology or Information Systems currics are not really much better since I can't really tell what kind of math, science or other complex stuff that'd entail. Still, I might recommend you go to some of those IT or IS (whichever program is offered, but they're the same, basically) classes if you can find any locally and see if you can handle that. I would think it can't be terribly difficult, because I've seen lots of grad programs that take two years and you can be coming from any background academically and still get in.    To be honest with you, nowadays there's really no sure way to make "good money." You have to look at the economy and then ask why it would make sense that there's anything out there that's surefire. It's something that almost seems completely luck of the draw or who you know. IT is no exception, and neither is anything else tech-related. A lot of those jobs keep going overseas, and the salaries keep going down in that field. Being that I already made a mistake borrowing money chasing a field that is similarly not hiring/paying like I thought (law), I decided that, personally, it would be best to leave IT where it is.     I'm just saying, you need to understand that studying any field is a gamble right now. Maybe when you get out of school, it won't be. But with something like tech and the way jobs keep going overseas, I kind of doubt it will change in that field, because it's just too cheap to have people in other countries "solving" our tech issues. This is why you call Dell and can't get anyone on the phone who speaks/understands English, unfortunately.|`|PwnQuNnKaa	As a chinese , I felt very honored that i can suggest something to you.

QoVL5cDHaa	He may get away with it for the first month, but I guess the computer will pick up on it sooner rather than later. Employers have legal obligations. If he is not fulfilling them, HMRC will come down on him, not you, like a ton of bricks. He will have to pay deductions due, whether he made them or not, and he will get a financial penalty.  If he pays normal net pay, that is the pay that will be legally regarded as the gross pay, so in effect you are all getting a pay cut. Does he propose correcting as the tax year goes on? Or is this to be the start of something ongoing? The NIC situation could affect any future benefits, such as state retirement pension and income-related jobseekers.  Employers are required to pay monthly, so if he is three months behind, HMRC will already be looking at him for recovery. It is possible a special Revenue employee (am not sure what the official title is now, it used to a Deputed Collector in my time in recovery 25 years ago) will call on him to inspect the books and calculate what is due. Sooner or later alarm bells will ring, and your employer will wish he wasn't.  Another thought comes to mind. What will he claim on his own Tax Return for tax relief on labour costs? Sounds as though there may be a big discrepancy............. One of the things looked at by HMRC.|`|0PHR8cICaa	Don't have anything to do with it.  It is fraudulent and if you go along with it you will be a party to the fraud.  If his cash picks up and he can put matters right by March, I doubt if anything will come of it.  But if he can't (and that seems quite likely if he is so hard up this early in the recession!) it could all come unravelled.  You could personally be liable to pay the missing tax and NI, and he could wind up in jail - leaving you with no job?|`|at3fTytsaa	The law quite clearly states that it is the employer's responsibility to deduct tax and NIC from wages and to pay these sums over to HMRC. If you are being paid this month, even if the money comes from his own pocket, he still needs to pay the tax and NIC - it will never be your liability.  Why doesnt he ring the special helpline which has been set up by HMRC to help businesses which are experiencing diffculties?|`|aaa51db58764fc242d17e84ad48c9d0aaa	officially your employer is liable to pay these, If however you are officially being paid nothing, then he has no contributions to make,     It wont affect your NI etc or tax code,    BUT    You then have an income that you wont be declaring and basically its whether you get caught or not,     If you did a "homer" for someone and they paid you cash would you declare it, you should but how many people would,  this is a smilar situation, it may draw attention to it though as the inland revenue would be querying the no pay and possible investigate the employees|`|AA12016864	i very much doubt whether the revenue would believe this arrangement.  When - after regularly paying every month - he suddenly pays nothing do you not think alarm bells will ring? If he personally has spare money why does he not simply inject the cash into the business?    The responsibility for making the payments of tax and NI would normally fall 100% on the employer but if you are seen to have connived with him I wonder if they will take a different view?|`|VvPJkjjZaa	It's not a good idea! Tell your employer about the business payment support line http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pbr2008/business-... I phoned them the other day about my SA tax and I'm sure they an help with PAYE too.

However, there are some who do invest the time, get educated and have converted their knowledge into cash on the internet. They have developed a successful online business, but their growth is limited by what they can personally do.    To continue to grow their business they establish an affiliate program to allow others to piggyback on their success and they are willing to share in the profits of their business as you help them promote it.  This is called affiliate marketing. I found an interesting article that explains how you can profit from affiliate programs listed below.    The main advantage of affiliate marketing is that you can "Get Paid Today." (GPT) You simply begin promoting the affiliate links you have been given and you are paid regularly by your affiliate partner for the sales you bring in.  This blog article listed below explains the "GPT" concept further.    The drawback of most affiliate programs is that they only pay once or twice a month, or once you have earned a certain level of commissions.  The disadvantage to you is that you will not get paid until you have met the timeframes for payout or the commission thresholds.     There is a company that has overcome these disadvantages by paying their affiliates immediately upon making a sale and the the affiliate marketer gets to keep 100% of the profit!  You do not have to wait for the program owner to pay you. I've included a link to the video presentation that explains how this is possible. Just click on the link below the recommended affiliate program.    Do your own due diligence, but for me affiliate marketing has been the best way for me to make an additional income working from home on the internet.

He has a couple of options--first, he needs to talk to the apt manager/landlord to explain the situation and see if he/she may have a suggestion.  There may be a way he can do a lease buyout which would allow him to break his lease without penalty and still receive a neutral landlord reference.  But if he is strapped for money, this may not be an option.  The other option he may have is to have someone take over his current lease.  Again, this would be another topic he should discuss with the landlord because if he doesn't know of anyone that can take it over, maybe the apartment complex can rent it out to someone who may be interested (they may even have a waiting list, you never know).  If he breaks the lease (i.e moving out without notice, failure to pay, etc.) not only will he owe any unpaid amounts from now until the end of his lease term, he will jeopardize his rental history by having a collection on his credit for an apartment community, as well as having an unfavorable landlord reference.  It will be very hard for him to be approved for an apartment down the road with these blemishes on his record.|`|fCF02V87aa	loss of income is not an acceptable excuse for breaking a lease---but as a Landlord I would rather let the tenant go and re-rent then get stuck for months of rent and have to evict someone.

39c2446b919f263832a80ca402b9f06eaa	Last year, you likely did not have much, if any taxable income while you were going to school. What was left over from your tuition credits got carried forward to be used this year (or future years if you don't use them all up). Since the tuition credits are a "non-refundable" credit, you use only as much is necessary to reduce your total payable to zero (if possible). Then the rest is carried forward. They just reduce your total payable... which would mean a bigger refund for you or less taxes owing.    Even if you don't have any income this year to pay taxes on, you will still need to file a return to be able to continue to forward your tuition credits to future years. You can carry forward these amounts indefiinitely until you have taxable income to use them against.     This credit will probably not benefit you much right now while you are going to school and working little... but once you're out of school and earning that big pay cheque, it sure will come in handy! =)|`|y7Mwptsraa	Unused tuition amounts are used to reduce your income tax obligation. The fact that you have an unused amount means that you were previously in school, but you didn't need all of the tuition and education credits to reduce your income tax obligation to zero.    Contrary to popular belief, these credits cannot be transferred dollar for dollar to pay down a student loan, nor can they be used to reduce the amount you need to pay in tuition when you go back to school.

A1kiUMgvaa	From what you describe it would appear that the law firm is issuing you a 1099 MISC rather than a W-2.  If you were an employee meaning that you did work at their offices, at their direction and with their equipment they should have been deducting SS and Medicare from you and paying the employer half.  If those are the facts you should file a Form SS-8 and Form 8919.  That will force them to pay up and avoid you from paying the SE tax.  That is a pet project of the IRS this year so it should be well received.|`|396e0df85e9b2414f391d81a9892f542aa	When you get a 1099 its like you were in business for yourself when you worked for that employer.  You have to pay self emp. tax on the 2000.  But you also get to take off things like your gas to and from work, any notary fees you paid (if your a notary). Its probably best if you let someone like HR Block prepare those taxes for you...just bring all your w2's and 1099's and any gas receipts for the time you worked at the lawyers office.|`|DGFu03Q3aa	Dear B:  You are required to report the 1099 Misc. income on Sch. C or Sch. CEZ. You claim income and if you have expenses for the job claim them as well. When you are paid on a 1099 you are also required to fill out Form Sch.SE (self employment taxes-medicare and soc. sec.  about 15.3%). In addition you pay federal income tax on the amount (bottom line) of Sch. C.

Errol Quinn  Enrolled Agent   Master Tax Advisor|`|6Cp41lb6aa	That law firm is in BIG trouble if you were an employee there.    A lot of companies are defrauding their employees by paying them with 1099s instead of W2s.    With a W2, the employer and employee each pay half of the social security and medicare taxes.    But with a 1099, the employee has to pay both halves himself.

You file as Single unless you are married or are supporting a dependent that qualifies you to file as Head of Household..  That holds true whether you can be claimed as a dependent or not.    You say that you lived with your parents all year.  If you are under age 19 or under age 24 and a full time student then they can claim you as a dependent unless you provided more that half of your OWN support.  And as noted above, if you can be claimed as a dependent you lose your personal exemption and are ineligible for the stimulus rebate whether your parents actually claim you or not.|`|1da69de5d66630d36a6f1f05ecd687b1aa	If you did your own taxes they should not have been able to claim you.

QoVL5cDHaa	Salary available before benefits are taxed is 8500, including benefits. It has been that figure for about 40 years, and has never risen with other allowances. Some benefits with a cash value are taxed at the start irrespective of salary level, such as if you were to get vouchers your employer purchased from a firm like Argos or Marks and Spencer. Employer has to send form P11D to HMRC at end of tax year where there are benefits and salary is over 8500, or form P9D for amounts of salary less than this when benefits are made. Employee should also get a copy. See www.hmrc.gov.uk, and enter "form P11D" in search.  This has no connection to the personal tax-free allowance of 6035.|`|at3fTytsaa	The annual tax free allowance is 6035. Assuming you earn well over that, your private medical insurance would be taxed at 20% (or 40% if you are a higher rate taxpayer).|`|oFiGyMWraa	You are liable to pay tax on all income and other non-cash benefits that you receive as reward for your services. The total value of the cash salary and the other benefits is calculated, and you pay tax in the normal way on that value.     IE first 6,035 free of tax, the next 34,800 taxed at 20%, everything else taxed at 40%.    For a non-cash benefit such as your insurance the taxable value of the benefit is the amount paid by the employer to provide it. So if your premiums cost your employer 100 a month, that is the additional amount you will be taxed on.    There is no minimum earning level before these benefits are taxable, although there are different, more favourable rules for "lower paid employees". However, the threshold for this is 8,500 per year, including the non-cash benefits. I suspect that if you are getting private medical insurance then you are earning a lot more than 8,500.|`|99452267df499e5605dfcfb9197d1ec4aa	The tax allowance is the same for everyone, I think its about 5,000 after that you pay tax on everything.

They are typically below the threshold for tax though so if all you earn in a week/month is your statutory rate of SMP then you will pay very little/no Tax and NI.
NwkZ5OmCaa	There is no such thing as a tax-free zone.  The IRS taxes on worldwide income.  Your W-2 should reflect both fica/mc and income taxes withheld because you could not have been exempt based on your circumstances.    If you do not qualify for the form 2555 (the 330 days rule), the only remaining form is 1116 which gives you credit for taxes paid to the other county only.

Zgs4RncIaa	All I know is when the IRS sees your social security number is duplicated, it's going to hold up both of your tax returns.  Do you pay rent? Do you have it documented that you pay rent (i.e. receipts?) Most likely you will have to provide proof that you are taking care of yourself and renting a room from her.   This may also cause problems for her as well, because if you have proof of rent and she doesn't claim the rent you paid (if you do) she is going to owe taxes on that money.|`|tw44fqCpaa	The most important question here is what was your age at the end of 2008.  Were you still 18 and just turned 19 in January?  If your under 19 at the end of the tax year she may still have a claim (it would be older if you were a full time student).  If you were already 19 then you are past the age of a qualifying child because you're not a full time student and your income being over 3500 means she loses you as a qualifying relative as well.      Now since your taxes are already done her efile will be rejected as the system automatically rejects a duplicate ss .  So she can file by paper only if she wants to try to claim you.  When the IRS contacts both of you to sort out who gets the exemption she will lose the exemption and her taxes will be adjusted.|`|78m1v4imaa	If you have claimed yourself, and you are providing for you and your son yourself then no, i do not believe she can claim you i believe that is fraud.  and if she carries it out against your will i believe you can call the tax people and request them to fix this please.  and they will.  the federal government dose not play with taxes|`|AA10529334	Nope - you are legally able to claim for yourself and your son.

4ZNl4V3Oaa	No, sorry, that's not possible.  You cannot do a Section 1031 exchange involving a personal residence.  You must pay the tax on the gain on the sale of the land.  The CG tax applies only to the gain.  Since you owned it for over 1 year the long term rate applies.  That's 15% unless your marginal rate inclusive of the gain is already 15% or less in which case it drops to 0% for 2008 and 2009.  In 2010 the reduced rate will revert to 5%.

Q4ntN5FBaa	If you are filing all of that, I HIGHLY recommend you get a professional to assist you.  At least price them to see how much.      Every year, I have many people come to me that did Turbo Tax but it isn't as easy as many people think.  They get notices from the state or IRS and then hire me to fix it all.  Fixing the errors usually takes more time and costs more money than if I had done the return the first time.      I am not saying Turbo Tax doesn't have a place in the market for some people...just if things get complicated...better to go to a pro than turn in something you are unsure about.
DAMZKbpDaa	The IRS is fine with it.    Many banks aren't fine with it. Some bank policy forbids it, it will bounce right back to the IRS and they will mail a check.

Call your bank to see if that is what they will do.|`|AA11284831	If the bank or credit union is following procedures the refund will reject if his name is not on the account.

Your box 2 on the W-2 is only the federal tax withheld.  You do not get to put down fica/mc taxes (boxes 4 and 6).|`|AA10469473	Your employer prepares your W-2, not the IRS, so if there is a mistake it was made by your employer.  The IRS only receives a copy from your employer.    Box 2 on your W-2 should be the total of everything deducted for the year for federal income tax only.    Ask your payroll department if you have one, or your boss if you don't have a payroll department.|`|6oC6k6hQaa	First of all, the IRS does not compute your W2s.  Your employer creates those based on your tax withholdings and wages for the year.  The only taxes that are going to show on  your W2 in Federal taxes are just that....federal taxes.  Your social security and medicare (FICA) are not included as a part of your federal tax, these are totally seperate taxes shown in seperate boxes on the W2.  You also need to take a look at your state taxes.  The state taxes are shown in the bottom of form W2.  Are the local taxes withheld from your check from your town or municipality?  There are many things to look for and take into account here.  YOu did not give any detail on the breakdown of your taxes so it is hard to tell where the amounts come from.|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	10 points ain't a lot of points, friend!  That's all that you can "give."    The IRS does not generate Form W-2, your employer does.    Post the exact taxes listed on your pay stub and your W-2 and we'll see if an error has been made.  Don't forget the State income tax listed on the very bottom of your W-2.  If an error has been made your employer would have to correct it.  As a practical matter, the only thing that matters is the amounts in boxes 1 and 2 on your W-2.  As long as box 2 matches up with the Federal income taxes withheld on your pay stub, you're good to go.

0uWqjL2raa	No you do not pay tax on the stimulus package.        Economic stimulus payments received  Q. Do I have to claim my stimulus payment as income on my 2008 income tax return?    A. No, the stimulus payment is not reportable as income on your 2008 income tax return.  Christine Wilkins EA Master Tax advisor    Any advice included in this message is based on our understanding of current tax law as it applies to the facts that you gave us.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	No.  This rumor never dies.    When you do your taxes, if you received a check last year, chances are you already got your entire stimulus and will get nothing more for the 2008 return.    Tax software is screwed up.  Instead of assuming you got the stimulus, it's been assuming you didn't, asking if you got a check and then going oh, you don't get a $1000 refund, you get $700 and pissing people off.|`|BoAEgaAGaa	The reason the question has to be asked as to how much of the stimulus was received in 2008 is to determine if you had received all that you were eligible for.  There are certain taxpayers who did not receive the full amount due to too much income, too little tax liability, or claiming a new child on their 2008 tax returns.    Therefore, you do not pay taxes on this amount or have to pay it back.

49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	I personally would not rent to you.    An eviction is not a reflection of financial stability.   It is a reflection on your ethics, you are unethical.  For whatever reason you decided to screw another person and phuck off a written contract.    That is a character flaw, it has nothing to do with money.   There are plenty of people with little money who would not dream of going back on their word and would certainly never take financial advantage of another person.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	No just find one complex that has a lot of vacancies.  They will take you.|`|63f94a5a994ccc0cca358ddcef453f65aa	I wouldn't reject such an application, but I would look at it very carefully. I wouldn't necessarily dwell on the eviction 4 years ago, although I'd take notice, but I'd really scrutinize your current situation. I'd be very concerned with the divorce (outcomes are often unpredictable), job, any debt, any history of late payments (especially recent ones). Also, the fact that this is the first time you are renting yourself means that I would not have any references from a previous landlords.    Assuming that everything is OK except for the eviction 4 years ago, it would depend on how desperate I am to rent an apartment. If I have tons of vacancies and you are the only applicant in a month, I'd go for it even if there are more red flags. If it's just one vacancy and there is a steady flow of potential renters, I'd let you go.|`|fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	I wouldn't rent to you...especially with many qualified tenants applying who do not have an eviction in their past.  Your too much of a risk.|`|KGRikkJeaa	there is only one way that they'll know youve been evicted. And that is if you tell them.

You are not financially stable of you still owe money after 4 years.

rLP9wjPtaa	There may well be limits, at least to the extent that you can find a buyer. You can try a local bank, look for a large bank with international operations with a local branch, or you might look for currency brokers in your area. If the currency is from a country that doesn't float the currency, you might have trouble finding a buyer.|`|0lnamekJaa	Start Calling Banks...     Or    Go to the Airport...    Wherever you go, there will be a charge but it is better to be out a % then to have money you can't spend.    Some big big branches, especially in high international travel cities like New York and Chicago, a BIG BANK should be able to do something for you.    You may need to seek out Curency Exchanges... Again... Most only do this in big international travel cities.    There are ALWAYS places in the airport's international section that do it... But I'm not sure how you can get it to them without having a ticket.    I would start calling banks... They should be the easiest option.|`|86e0fcff22774bed26d5e5f6773ca754aa	Not all Countries have convertible currencies ..    In UK, the anti-money-laundering laws means that you will be asked for proof of identity where-ever you change your money (in the old days, they only check transactions over 10,000 .. but now they have computers that look for 'suspicious patterns' and can 'cross-check' against your Tax return etc.. )    So you might as well use whatever service gives you the best rates .. I suggest you check your Bank first ..|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	Any limits would be based on the bank that you exchange it at. Not all banks do currency exchange and they each have their own rules and regulations. Some things that you may come across are fees. If you don't have an account with that financial institution then you will get a fee for that. If you exchange under a certain amount in "american" dollars then there is a fee. If you have a large amount it is up to the bank and the company they exchange through if they are going to accept it or not. The only way to know for sure is to contact banks and ask about the currency exchange policies.|`|SAgkmyqYaa	No limit to how much you can change though once you reach a certain threshhold you will need to show proof of funds such as you took it out of a bank or sold your house or something like that.    What middle eastern countries currency do you have. Certain countries like Dubai and Kuwaits currency is more valuable than the us. Oothers however like Iraq are not worth much and it will be hard to find someone who will buy it back from you.     Fewer and fewer banks are doing this service anymore, do some googling for a local foreign currency exchange. Two big companies who are in most cities are Travelex or ICE
49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	No, she needs to pay the rent.  Her rent is not effected.    She pays the landlord as usual as long as he owns the property.    When it actually forecloses one of two things will happen.   If the apartment has more then 4 units she pays her rent to the bank (they will hire a real estate broker to act as manager).   If it is less then 4 she will need to move.    She will face the same consequences of anyone else if she up and decides to stop paying her rent, she will be evicted (only take a couple of weeks in FL) and have the eviction on her credit report for the next 10 years.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	As long as she lives there, she owes rent to the person who owns the property. The foreclosure is between the landlord and his/her lender, its none of your niece's business.     If she still occupies the unit, she still owes rent, its that simple.|`|6292d9ef630e6d4aba7bd0e0e2d0d97daa	She should contact the lender.  She owes rent to her landlord but the lender may have an assignment of rents and leases if the borrower defaults or falls behind.  In that instance, her rent would be paid to the lender or a receiver of rents.    **************  Looks like a lot of people here haven't done closings on investment properties, lol.  An assigment of leases and rents is very common, and all that is required for it to go into effect is that the borrower be in default.  The lender doesn't need to wait for a full foreclosure if they have this assignment.    Example language: "Upon Assignor's (the borrower) default under the loan documents, Assignee (the lender) shall have the power and authority to demand, collect and receive from the tenants, lessees or parties in possession of the premises or part thereof, rents now due  or to become due; " etc.|`|cUP8PmRIaa	if the house is in foreclosure that's a different story, the landlord is losing the place most likely before her lease is up and the bank couldn't care less about her. I'm not sure of the laws in FL, but she may want to find out soon and move asap.|`|aEeCCHVlaa	As the tenant, she should have received an official notice of foreclosure. She needs to contact whom ever holds the mortgage and ask them to put her rent into an escrow account, not give it to the landlord.  If she just stops paying her rent, the landlord can sue her in small claims court to try and recover missed rent payments even though the apartment is in foreclosure. If she did not sign a contract (lease) for one year, but had been on a month-to-month lease, it would be a different story.|`|fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	She does not get to live there for free if that's what your thinking.      As long as the landlord is the legal owner of the property, she is obligated to pay rent as agreed in her lease.  Failure to do so can result in an eviction...which can take place rather quickly in Florida.    What the landlord does with the rent money is irrelevant and legally none of her or your business.|`|AA10645224	SHE'S GOING TO GET EVICTED ANYWAY.  IF I WERE HER I'D STOP PAYING RENT AND START LOOKING FOR A NEW PLACE    THE CONTRACT IS VOID AS SOON AS THE LANDLORD DEFAULTS  IT'S GOING TO take him at least 30 days to legally evict    EACH COUNTY HAS A LNDLORD TENENT DIVISION YOU CAN CALL FOR MORE INFORMATION

bVROvLNSaa	I am thinking that the company you work for needs to spend some time developing position descriptions for the managers of various departments.  By now you know that work is for the willing, only you can change the situation you are in.  Decide if you even want to stay with the company you currently work for, decide what you would really rather do instead and take the necessary steps and DO IT!!|`|ReX5PzOZaa	My boyfriend is a Buyer/Purchaser and no one gives him their typing or errands list.

I would start applying for other jobs my boyfriend has no time to make copies for others we work for the same company and I know for a fact he is a busy bee!
ygGr1nX7aa	If you're talking about the British supermarket chain... no idea about their ISP, but they are owned by Wal-Mart, who judging by their track record have the goal of dominating the market so that they can make as much money as possible.  Wal-Mart actively seek to put small shops and stores out of business by moving into towns and lowing their prices systematically until local businesses cave, so that they can then charge what they like.  They actively oppose the unionising of their staff.  ASDA's own line of clothing has also been reported to be made by underpaid third-world labour.    ASDA also boast to have more cheaper products than other supermarkets; however, as shown by ad campaigns run by the others, this does not take into account what products people actually need or buy, nor the quality of those products.  Given Wal-Mart's policies, it seems mostly to be a ploy to lure custom away from their competition.
YK8JBUeOaa	An internship in line with your major would be a great start, especially since most companies will work around your schedule.

Good luck in your job search|`|09fb14d66d014c3ec713bb71c64b144daa	Are there any book stores local to you that you might be interested in? Or perhaps a local church or something who can use a typist or filer. My brother told me recently that restaurants actually hire people to do no more than fold napkins and or insert silverware into them. And they make big bucks doing it. Because the servers don't want to waste their valuable time doing it. Hope I was of some help|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Search for part-time jobs in the field of your major.  Companies are downsizing from full time to part time employees due to the recession.  This is the chance to work in your field of interest.  A good employer will try to develop you for future positions.
A8fFtV8Caa	When delivering pizza, job satisfaction varies from day to day: Some days, tips are good, some days they're terrible.  The best part was making money, the worst part was having to actually deliver pizzas. Usually, unless the store you work at is really busy all the time, you'll help out a little--and you'll want to so that things get done faster, so that you can deliver your pizza faster and make better tips.  If you work at a smaller store, you'll do a lot more than just deliver pizza.

tdQTZPI7aa	Longevity raises are necessary to keep qualified employees happy.  Not happy with the system then enter the private market
YQ1Q7XeEaa	Lot's of companies are going this route.  It's either done because they feel they really can't lose headcount and remain viable but at the same time they need to reduce expenses quickly or risk going bankrupt.    There are other companies who look at it as a way to take care of their people.  They don't want to place a lot of folks on the streets at a time of elevated unemployment.  The answer for them is to lower salaries to avoid laying off.    The 3'rd type is the unscrupulous business owner who tells everyone he's doing it to keep from laying off but in reality he's doing it only to add to the bottom line.  - This is more rare than you might think because people look for jobs when their employer reduces salary or benefits.  Cutting when it is less than necessary might create a talent vacuum in the company.|`|Ghx1XqSjaa	Either they get lower wages and keep working or either they don't work and collect unemployment..... (collecting a lower wage while looking for work)    It depends on if you can afford to accept a lower wage. If I had to take a lower wage, I would rather accept unemployment.

We are paying to much of our paychecks to the govt.  You have to work from Jan to March basically for free and then you still have to pay more taxes.  Talk about not being fair.  Maybe the dems in power now will resolve that-since they are SO intent on making things FAIR for everyone.  But then again you do work and are moderately productive so you probably won't get any of that help.

2Skznsq8aa	Having the big boss find a mistake regardless of who made the error, can be embarrassing. Keep in mind they have the big picture in their head and are well practiced at spotting discrepancies.  If the person who prepared the information spent a lot of time on a project, down in the weeds as I like to say, then they may well miss an error. Regardless, as their supervisor, you do have to take responsibility for the error.  If you blame a staff member that makes you look small and petty and will cause your manager to question your ability to supervise.    Everyone makes mistakes.  When you are in a supervisory role, you are responsible for the work product produced from your department.  You can't control your staff's every move.  It's important to be able to rely on their performance and accuracy.      When an error is made by staff, whatever you do, don't correct it yourself.  It takes more time but you have to show then their error and, if they don't know how to correct it, you make sure that they are trained properly.|`|crJKIqloaa	If your boss cares about quality then blame shouldnt matter.

g09x06Zpaa	Go on yahoo jobs and pick a category and look for jobs that interest you.     Think about what you like to do the most, and make sure its something you can be happy doing when you -have- to do it.    I didn't really have this problem because I've been thinking about what to do 'when I grow up' since 5th grade.    I hope you find what you want to do.    Don't feel pressured into making a hasty decision, even if you're getting college credit now, you can pause your education at any time.     Also, ask yourself: Where do I want to work (home, office, outside, in a lab, etc)? What am I good at already? What do I like to do? What kind of lifestyle do I want to lead after college (and will my college choice's income pay for it?)     These questions will help you pick jobs by other goals. If you don't want to work in an office, and want to work outside, consider what kind of places you like to go and what kind of jobs would let you do it.

My husband and I are paying $1070 for a rented house, $800 or so on the vehicles, and $700 on credit cards and we have an income of $70K per year combined.  So yes, we are broke too.  We're trying to file bankruptcy to get a fresh start, but don't know if we'll qualify.    Staying organized is good and try to cut back spending some.  Pay off your lowest amounts of credit cards first if you can.  You make a good income.  I know they say to pay off the highest interest, but that doesn't work.  For example, if you could pay off 3 little credit cards and they were each at 10% interest, you just paid off 30% and now have money for the others.  Debt management will ruin your credit.|`|OnnwkKZnaa	There are a couple of things you can do.  Yes there is budgeting, lowering expenses, etc.  But let's be real, 10k is a lot but no HUGE.  You can knock this out.  First, you pay a large amount every month to your car.  Could you downgrade the vehicle?  Sel the car and buy something for cash.  Then you would have hundreds of more dollars each month to pay down debt.  Second, how about a second part time job.  It can be anything.  Deliver pizzas if you have to.  Since you can obviously live on what you make now, pay every single dollar that you make over that into the debt.  I'm sure you could make enough within a year to pay it off and be done!|`|rDsKB0uXaa	try not to spend so much money

3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income:    1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor.  A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a  particular real estate listing.  The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7.  Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.    Good luck!|`|Fd4EBV1Vaa	I'd be very cautious of any jobs you are offered as you are only 13.

AqVKFaaGaa	If you are in the UK, go to the Citizens Advice Bureau straight away, they will give you some (free) advice and if they can, they will help you talk to your creditors to stop you having to go to bankruptcy.    Also, have a look at the money saving expert website - there's lots of free tips and advice on contacting your creditors yourself if the CAB can't help (seems some staff are better than others, as for every organisation).     Finally, if things are looking very black right now, you may need to see your GP and check whether you are not starting a depression (which would make you feel even worse, and you did write about not sleeping, eating...).    One thing though - you will get lots of answers from people offering you loans (scams mostly), IVAs (legal but close enough to scams) or earn cash quick scams on yahoo answers - avoid them at all cost...

If you've been hired to recruit then be sure they aren't handing you the unfillable jobs.    If they hired you to do sales be sure you haven't been handed the un-sellable accounts and can do your own prospecting.    Times are tight at recruiting agencies now but if you can hang in there the economic turnaround should be particularly strong in that industry since they supply people to all other industries.

That would be a ridiculous amount of work for an overstrained office.    If the return is delayed, then this is probably just because more people filed early than expected. This could happen easily in a down economy when people expecting refunds are eager to get them asap. Of course, they might also be looking to audit YOU for some irregularity in your tax return that has nothing to do with the day on which you filed it.    If your issue is in part with state taxes (I know you said the IRS, but I don't know if you are having a second issue so...) then that goes on a case-by-case basis and I don't know what to tell you.

You could invest the 5k into one of these accounts and leave there for the 8 months.  After the bonus rates expire move the money into another account offering a bonus rate.

RNqRnG86aa	It pays to start shopping around for a new policy. The good news is that more than a dozen insurance companies have entered the market since the hurricane-induced meltdown of 2004-06.    Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the state's insurer of last resort, has been farming out hundreds of thousands of its policies to startup companies. Firms in that group include American Integrity Insurance, United Property & Casualty and Federated National Insurance. Many have been dubbed poor financial risks, though none has been tested thanks to our mostly storm-free hurricane seasons since 2006.    Companies with stronger ratings have been branching out in Florida, too. One is St. Petersburg's ASI, which recently insured only newer homes, but now is taking on older homes.    If you struggle to find coverage, contact the Florida Market Assistance Plan at www.fmap.org or by calling toll-free 800-524-9023. FMAP helps consumers find coverage. If you still can't secure a policy, an agent will place you with Citizens Property Insurance.    Above poster is not correct because State Farm Florida Insurance Company (State Farm Florida) had filed plans to discontinue its property insurance lines in Florida (not just new business). Their statement is @ http://www.statefarm.com/florida/florida...|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Yep, there aren't any companies, except Citizens (the state run company), rated by AM Best, that are writing new homeowners policies in Florida.

They will be doing so indefinitely.  However, they will not continue to write new business.    But...it never hurts to shop because State Farm could change their mind and you could be left scrambling with 30 days to find new insurance.    EDIT:    I stand corrected.  The preliminary reports that State Farm sent to non-Florida agents stated that they'd continue to carry current customers but would not write new business.  The other poster is correct.  State Farm is trying to get a plan approved through Flordia regulators to drop all fire lines within the next two years in an attempt to provide current policyholders sufficient time to seek new carriers.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	I've read some pretty awful things about their Auto Policy practices, so I am not surprised.

9k4d7Kytaa	I'm not familiar with that company, but in general agents will not try to swindle you out of extra premium on a homeowner's policy.  Comissions are relatively low on these products so even if they could talk you into paying an extra $100 a year it will probably only amount to an extra $3 - $5 for them.  To make extra money, the agents will attempt to also capture extra lines of business with their clients (ie, cars, life insurance, health insurance)...which in often cases can save the client money anyway.    If they are advising you to buy certain coverages or cover your home for a certain limit, it is probably because in their experience those coverages are important and that limit is appropriate.  If they don't advise you to buy appropriate coverage, they open themselves up to an errors and admissions lawsuit.|`|CW7Sej2uaa	The best way to know if you afe getting a good deal is to get multiple quotes before you buy a policy.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Nope, they will try to get you covered appropriately.

r201SVRraa	I doubt whether a previous employer would volunteer information that a previous employee had a disciplinary as it may leave them open to action being taken against them, but a lot of reference request forms will ask the question - and in that case it is illegal for the previous employer to lie and say no - they would probably either leave it blank or have to be truthful.|`|ZEwAalKPaa	In many years of reading references from ex-employers i have never once seen one where they mentioned having disciplined the person.|`|ye1tS9a2aa	yes, if you go for another job, and they ask for a reference from your previous employer|`|AA11169105	yes.|`|S5H0NmEWaa	Yes, it can.    But all references are, in theory, open for the employee to see - at least, you have an entitlement to request that any information about you is disclosed to you on request under the Freedom of Information Act.     This means that referees tend to be wary of putting in anything which could be interpreted as damaging or disparaging - but it does also mean that concerns about an employee can be expressed more subtly in the way a reference is phrased without actually saying anything explicit.    However, a disciplinary is a disciplinary, so they are entitled to say that there was one.|`|91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	No. That is an internal matter for the employer's organisation. No previous employer will mention that or for that matter anything which might be considered derogatory in a reference. If necessary, they will simply decline to give a reference.|`|5yB5ciSmaa	no, a new employer will ask for reference usually the ex employer will either say yes they will give a reference which will be good or decline the issue which usually means bad
V0uzsE6kaa	Getting another CC won't hurt you unless you rack up charges on it.  If you get one and only put your TV on it, then make the payments on time every month, you'll actually be helping your credit score.      I would recommend getting a card through Best Buy, as I really like their service plans and warranties.  My TV broke once and they sent someone out the next day to repair it completely free.  Their service guy was completely friendly and professional.. I was really impressed.    As for the credit report thing -- You can call equifax or experian and ask to talk to a person.  They should be able to answer your questions and tell you when the last one was requested.|`|jaAolejUaa	no, cc's will help ur credit score get lower|`|13c2458f4413df812625a9103d5e4204aa	To get the best credit score long term you need to open another national card (like Visa, MC, AMEX, or Discover).  Store CC's limit where you can use them.    You will take a hit for the application and for lowering the average age of your accounts.  Your score will go down for about 60 days until it starts aging.  In the long run your score should be higher.  Its best to keep your individual CC utilization between 1%-9%.  You also want to keep your overall utilization in that range as well.  Both factors will affect your credit score.    I would recommend trying to use the Sear's card or just pay cash.|`|gYFtQyyQaa	It probably won't lower your credit score if you make all of your payments on time.

Meaning even if you have no withholding, you can get this amount.  The program IS an interest-free loan, so a really good deal, and you only pay back $500 a year.  Greed is what got us into this economic mess.  Best thing to do with the money is to put at least HALF down on principal of your loan, increasing your equity, reducing the interest you pay over life of loan and term of loan.  It has a HUGE impact when you make extra payments of principal is first 5-10 years of your loan.|`|AA11284831	Pure rumor.|`|KmAgTil6aa	At this point in time, it is still like an interest-free loan, and the money still needs to be paid back at $500 per year for 15 years.

0Z2aBH0Daa	UPS is different than USPS. USPS is the postal service. Go to www.usps.com, create an account and go from there. Once you have the hang of it it's awesome.    It's about 20 cents cheaper if you print out your label (can be on regular paper have to tape it to the front of the pkg) at home vs. doing it at the post office (plus it saves time). I purchased a box of sticky labels (2 on each sheet, print without receipt to save the 2nd label and then print receipt next) and it is awesome.    BUT you have to ship it the same day you say you're mailing it -- if you don't ship it that day, take it to the post office and ask them to put a new date label on it (free).     USPS is so much cheaper than using FedEx or UPS. They also have flat rate shipping boxes (free) which are great for heavier things.|`|AA10464818	Only at the USPS Post Office -- not UPS    You can also pay your postage online (free with delivery confirmation).     https://sss-web.usps.com/cns/landing.do    Make sure you use the Priority Mail envelopes or boxes as they will cost cheaper|`|zc9ZhoMIaa	Post office|`|MxHRjPFHaa	post office is a lot cheeper unless the package weighs over 20 pounds then take it to ups...........but postal service ''post office '' is the way to go...
YQ1Q7XeEaa	This is not as difficult as it would sound.  In most states you are entitled to unemployment if you lost the job due to no fault of your own.    In other words, if you had attendance issues, cussed out a customer, violated a major company policy like stealing then you won't get it.    If, on the other hand, you got fired because the boss was not happy with your work performance - even if he is right you would still probably get unemployment.  In most states they blame this on the employer by stating if this person was so unteachable then why did you hire them in the first place?    Hang in there - most staes are pro-employee so they would have to go a long way to change their minds.  If you truly were honest then you should have little to worry about.

Wz6jHzSEaa	Direct deposit funds are always posted to the account. Regardless who owns the funds initially , they are your funds until you prove otherwise. AS such they can be seized to satisfy your debts. IRS is notoriusly slow in releasing  seized funds and banks are slow in implementing the release. Get a copy of the release, take it to the bank and show it to them. This will help the bank track it down. Be patient otherwise.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	The bank would not "reject" a direct deposit unless your account has been closed.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Direct deposits are never rejected.

Yesterday it said deposit on 2/10, later last night there was no information available for it at all and this morning it now says again 2/10.      update  I checked the IRS site for our recovery rebate amount and we received $1800 not the $1200 I thought.  I called to see how to fix this and they appear to have found the problem so our rebate should be DD on Feb 6th. This is why the date changed from 2/3 to 2/10, for us anyway. Fortunately if they are able to fix this  I shouldn't have to file an amended return. After it is processed I will defiantly double check though. You get great service if you call  and say yup I screwed up please help me.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Accepted by the IRS simply means that your tax return had a valid SSN and name on it.  It hadn't gone through any additional processing.    While efiled returns tend to have fewer errors on them, they can still have errors.  The BIG error this year is the rebate recovery credit.  Virtually nobody qualified, yet everybody seems to think they were to get $600 or more.  Consequently, these tax returns went to error processing--causing the expected completion/deposit date to move.|`|5SYwrf6Zaa	Unfortunately you will not receive your refund until Feb. 6th.

UrFDyPCJaa	No, passive smoking does not void a life insurance policy.    Usually, as long as you were not a smoker before you took out the life insurance policy which was rated as a "non-smoker" they cannot void the coverage.    Since you do not smoke and it's only second-hand smoke you have exposure to this should be built into the life insurance rates for non-smokers, since we can all be exposed to second-hand smoke as non-smokers if we live with a smoker.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	No.|`|y2ZukikXaa	After your policy is delivered and paid for you could get on a 10-pack a day habit and it won't matter...at least as far as the life insurnce is concerned.      You can also start piloting aircraft, bungee jumpping, deep sea diving, bridge painting and a laundry list of other hazardous items that insurance companies wouldn't underwrite you for before hand....of course so long as you were being honest when you bought the policy.    Same goes with most individual disability insurance policies.  You could start as an accountant and then get a job taming lions (in Vegas) and you're (usually) good to go.|`|xWl8IJIhaa	No.  Even active smoking does not void life insurance|`|JuE6QMTTaa	No, once the policy is issued, your rating won't go up unless you want to receive a higher coverage that requires a medical.
5dXsErAaaa	You will receive a nonrefundale tax credit of 15% on the first 200$ and 29% on the next 100$. In your case you are taxable and it will help reduce your taxes. However if you keep your receipts you can claim them up to 5 Years. So if a person donated 300$ a year for five years they would get 15% on the first 200$ and and 29% on the remaining 1300$ which would be a better tax credit however if you do this you will have to wait for five years to receive your credit. I beleive most people just claim them every year and don't wait. The numbers here are for federal tax and there is also an provincial amount which depends on what province you live in. It doesn't matter what tax bracket your in because it is a precalculated credit the only thing that matters is that you are taxable and based on the information you provided you are there for you would be able to take advantage of the credit.|`|42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	At $300, if I remember the formula correctly, will generate about a $20 credit. This means you can apply that credit against your liabilities. If your Liabilities exceed your Credits, you owe. If your Credits exceed your Liabilities, you see a return.    If you actually earned $30,051 for the year, CRA is not likely going to come after you for reporting $30,000 as an income. (Although they may send you a "polite" reminder to claim all income and dock any return/increase any owing by an appropriate amount.) The same if you earned a few dollars less and rounded it up, they won't care.    However, make sure you claim all income on your actual submitted paperwork, as it will affect your refund or tax bill.    Good Luck!

YQ1Q7XeEaa	The general rule of thumb is any time over 40 hours in a single work week is paid at OT.

Some states only consider overtime if you work more than 40 hours in a week.  Others, like California, require overtime for more than 8 hours any given day regardless of the number for the week.  It could be your state only looks at the week, and you employer wants to adjust your schedule so you will not have gone over.

When you work over 40 hours in a week you get paid overtime for every hour past 40, it is not based on how many hours you work in a single day.

They sent the new "bill" to a different address, so I never did get it or pay it. When I went to do my taxes the following year, they just factored that in, and took it out of my new return. Also, when you go to open a bank account, they just look up in their system to see if you owe other banks money. Just other banks. If you do, you have to go to the bank and pay, and then go back with a receipt to show it is paid, before you can open one.  Also, sometimes they cant even pull up this info, so just go try. You will be fine.
Qqz0H2hEaa	You need to contact the mortgage company (or companies) that have liens against your rental property.  Tell them that you have no choice based on what you have said here.  Offer to attempt to do a "short sale" or a "deed in lui of foreclosure".  Both of these choices are very bad on your credit but not as bad as a foreclosure- they also will hold down costs which may be held against you as a personal lien after the foreclosure sale.    Contact a Realtor that has done a lot of short sales and they can help you navigate thru this mess.  The mortgage company will want a Realtor (if that is the way they want to go) involved and will adjust the payoff so that it really is no extra cost for you.    Call the mortgage company now- they will need a lot of information from you to verify all that you say is true.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	It will stay on your credit report for at least 7 - 10 years and it is a huge red flag and negative item, like a bankruptcy.  Be prepared to get turned down for almost everything you will need a credit check for for at least that amount of time (or if not turned down you will get ridiculously high interest rates on things such as loans).  It will also lower your credit score a lot.    Basically you will have terrible credit for the next 7 - 10 years if you have a foreclosure on your credit report.

YQ1Q7XeEaa	As a career person I can tell you without reservation - follow your heart.    Do not go into a career you won't like unless you are just a glutton for punishment.    If psychology is what you want then create a plan including your advanced degree.  There are many graduate programs that take BS degree holders and get them a PhD in 3 years (plus practicum).  It's expensive BUT you will earn a lot more than a nurse and can pay it off faster.  You also work as a Grad assistant and work to get fellowships and paid internships or co-ops.    The important part is focus on your end goal more than short term money gain or loss.    Live on ramen for a few years drive nice cars the rest of your life.  All while doing something you enjoy!  Sounds like a winner to me.|`|bVROvLNSaa	Here's how I suggest approaching your aunts and grandmother.      "While nursing may have been a wonderful career for you, and you may wish you had become nurses, times are different now.

I have decided to become (you fill in the blank here) and I would appreciate your acceptance and support of my decision.  Thanks, I love you all."  Be sure your mom is there too, she will be your ally.     Nip all other attempts to bring up nursing again.|`|8ERjkyysaa	It's YOUR life to live, not theirs.

Now I'm in the IT field, and still regretting not taking up what I would have been much more happier doing.|`|myG2hhaKaa	Be strong and stand up for what you know is right for you. It takes a brave person to do that. Your family are not the ones who will be working 40 hrs a wk at this job, you are! So, pick something you like.    You are right. You will need to go on for something else as a psychology major. I was a psychology major. Luckily, you can go in many directions - counseling, become a school counselor, an occupational therapist, etc.     I am planning to become a psychiatric nurse or an occupational therapist. If you decide that you MIGHT want to do something in the medical field later, aside from nursing - I'd take anatomy & physiology at least as an undergraduate. You will cover most of your other pre-req with a psychology degree.     And kudos for you - for trying out something different (nursing classes) to get a feel for it. You dived into it and know it wasn't for you. So, now, you can have some peace knowing that it wasn't for you.     So many people are going into nursing, simply because it's in demand and nurses make good money. But, they are just sellouts- if they don't have the passion for it!|`|e98af447d889fc4d0fa1016941966d10aa	As a nurse I am often too busy to note the great rewards and satisfaction. Clearly it is not piece of cake to stuty for that RN or LVN title. We all find areas where we do and enjoy the work best. Nursing has become more specialized and with this has ciome better pay and respect professionally. At the end of the day though be sure that you have done your own research as you have here. Remember that there are allied health fields too. I was a funeral director before I chose nursing and often kid around stating that I could not keep a straight face for 8 hrs. The myths are, more often, not true. Oddly enought, though, after 28 yrs worling in medical and psychiatric ares, Im studing to get a certification in forensic nursing doing death investigations. Hopefully you will choose what makes YOU happy. It could very well not be nursing. We are all valuable not matter what we do especially if it helps others. Most jobs do either directly or indirectly.

You can even work in a Psych practice for extra exposure. This will allow you to not be in debt while getting your advanced degree.  Your other option is to go into Psych off the bat. While the money is in the Master's Degree, a BS may qualify you as a BSW. This pays competitive with a general BS degree (but not as much as an RN). Another draw back is at this level it generally pays to be near a significant population area. Check the local program in your area for certification/educational requirements and go from there.  The choice is yours.

cwKNDZz9aa	Ignorance is expensive.    So what are we paying JH for? Why am i still being charged for a (RAL) if I'm not getting one!    Didn't you read the CONTRACT you signed? No? Too bad.    You're getting hosed in a number of different ways.    EIC can be delayed because of the high incidence of fraud related to the EIC. Poor people having babies.....not a good combination.     That's life.|`|AA11132354	BECAUSE it's NOT your money, it's not what you earned or had withheld, it's money from the government, a gift to the deserving, working poor.  If you don't get a RAL, you get an assisted refund from J-H and should NOT be paying the RAL interest, although you will still pay for tax preparation and a bank fee.  In fact you have paid J-H NOTHING, not one cent yet, and if you owe back taxes and the IRS grabs your refund, they'll get nothing.  ALSO, read all those papers you signed at J-H, and learn just what YOU agreed to.  However, I've heard NOTHING about IRS delaying any refunds because of the overwhelming number of EIC returns, and NOTHING about some refunds going unpaid.  The IRS is stepping up investigations of Fraudulent EIC filings, though.  And there were some delays due to the Rebate Recovery.|`|fQ5KYnqgaa	Actually the IRS is delaying refunds due to EIC, A freind of mine just told me her message changed in the WMR sight, She will get her direct deposit tomorrow as sceduled but not the EIC part|`|AA11555162	I am surprised to hear the IRS is delaying refunds for EIC.

bFRVSDteaa	Yes, you should be concerned.  The first thing to do is look at one of your recent pay stubs.  If it shows city tax being withheld, then contact your employer to ask for a corrected W-2, saying that the amount that was withheld for city tax does not show up on the W-2 they gave you.  If the pay stub does not show city tax being withheld, then contact your employer to ask why they are not withholding city tax.    Note that you will still be responsible for paying the NYC tax that is due.  If your employer did not withhold it, the taxing authorities can fine them,  but YOU still owe the tax, along with any penalties if the total city and state income tax were not paid in a timely manner.|`|ZeDjn4cVaa	If your residence is in New York City, then you will owe New York City taxes even if your employer erroneously failed to withhold any.    You would calculate these taxes when completing your return and pay them when you file your New York State return.  Since New York State collects the taxes for New York City, if more than enough has been withheld for New York State, the New York State taxes withheld could be enough to also cover your New York CIty taxes.    You need to contact your employer and ask them to start withholding the proper amount of New York City taxes.

AHCelSY1aa	I have an EEOC case against my former employer that has been ongoing since February of 2007.  What's important here and you do not mention is did you get the name of your investigator?  Who was the case given to?  In the event you have this information and he/she is not returning your phone calls I would contact the EEOC and ask for the supervisors name to request a new investigator (that's what I did and my investigator is absolutely awesome.  Returns all calls and responds to all of my emails.)  The investigation process can be upwards of 2 years.  EEOC also has new procedures that went into effect September of last year.  All new cases that come in now take precedence over any old cases.  Definitely DO NOT sit tight.  You have to stay on top of it, but do not harass your investigator with constant calls.  Calling once a month will suffice.  I would love to give you more information, but without knowing if your case has been appointed to an investigator it is difficult to give you accurate advice.  You also made a good decision on waiting for the EEOC investigation to be concluded since once you secure an attorney the EEOC can not give you any information regarding your case without a letter from the attorneys office they are allowed to do so.  Also now that your company has refused mediation that means they now need to determine if you will be given a right to sue letter, no cause, or a conciliatory letter.  You have a long way to go.  If you'd like you can email me directly and I'll be happy to help you along the way.  I know more about the EEOC now than I ever thought I would.

However, make sure it is legitimate and not a fraud, because if it later bounces or is a fraud, then the bank will come after you for the money.    Lots of internet scams start out that way.  They ask you to cash a "check" for $1,000 and offer you a $300 "commission" to do so if you give them back the $700.  By the time the $1,000 is proven to be a fraud, the scammer is long gone, and you are out the $1000.|`|rHlEqiRbaa	whats the meaning dude????????|`|4a82038d5eaef1f51e57e5b97d13746eaa	The question is not really clear.

If the check is payable to your brother and if you want to deposit it in your name the same can be done if the check is a bearer and not an account payee check.    If the check is signed by your brother (drawer) and you want to make payment of the check, you can't. At best you can return the check to the drawer and issue your check instead.    If you can spell out your question clearly answer is possible.|`|rntbNVjVaa	quetion not clear.    if it is issue in favour of brother then you have to deposit in your brother's account only.    if you want to pay somebody else by cheque. n you are taking your brother's cheque with his sign. then you can do it.

Upon speaking with h&r block it is a delay due to the recovery rebate credit. From my understanding some of us that did NOT receive a stimulus check last year may be due monies. If there is an amount on your tax return on the line that says Recovery Rebate Credit then your return is being held up because the IRS is doing it manually.|`|SdTQVUaKaa	I'm at this very moment on the phone with IRS trying to get around their machines ...

Please allow the full 3 weeks to pass to find out what will happen in the end"    Mine was also accepted on the 21st and given the 1st date of 2/3, now 2/10.

In general the IRS takes 4-18 days to do a direct deposit of the refund after they have accepted an e-filed return and usually on Thursday or Friday. The first anticipated day this year is Jan. 30 (tomorrow) since they started receiving e-files on the 16th.   Also there may be a delay if your refund includes any rebate recovery credit, apparently they are having a great deal of errors associated with this credit and it can delay the release of the refund an average of a week may be more.|`|zMD16t9naa	Filed and accepted on January 16th through Tax Brain and accepted by the IRS on January 17th.  Requested the 2 week rapid refund and paid for it, and expected date from SBBT was January 30th.  Checked irs.gov three days ago and it said that expected refund would be February 6th.  Checked yesterday as well as today and now it says February 10th.      After endless answer searching online I still could not find a plausible answer.  So I decided to go through the expected nightmare of contacting the IRS by phone and speaking with a machine...errrr...robot.....errr some form of life that speaks.  After a 20 minute wait my call was answered.  I was not told anything about a glitch or error.  What I was told was that I would NOT be receiving my refund tomorrow.  I was told that the IRS had to make a minor correction to my return and that is what caused the delay.  He could not tell me what the correction was(the system does not tell him), only that it was minor therefore the IRS did not need to contact me to make the correction.  Prefaced by "its not set in stone", he said I should receive my refund on February 10.  I went on to ask what could have been possibly corrected seeing as I used the same certified website which uses software to calculate the return for the previous 8 years and I have never had this problem.  Again, he did not have an answer.  He concluded with the IRS company line of "check the website next week and you should see new updates".    The only correction I think that might have needed to be done was the correcting the control number on my W-2, as I filed off of my last paycheck.  Since filing I have received my W-2 and everything but the control number was entered correctly. Soooooo.....I guess cynical as I am I still don't have an answer I can trust and honestly that sucks.

First off, the customer service rep did tell me that there is some sort of computer glitch, so the website and hotline are giving wrong dates.  In my case, my refund is still being processed with no assigned refund date...kind of disappointing since my return was accepted by the IRS on 1/21 and according to their "refund schedule" I should have mine by 2/3 as originally indicated...now there is no telling when it will happen and there were NO errors.  Good luck everyone...seems as if this is going to be a frustrating process for all of us this year!|`|3EherTCkaa	My Dates went from 1/30 to 2/6 to 2/10. Just got off the phone with the IRS.

She said they were having some problems with "where's my refund" giving out the wrong dates.  In my case there was a problem but she couldn't tell me what it is.|`|blTNhKOHaa	I've been scanning the web myself for answers since my date was pushed back to Feb. 10th as well, it seems that the IRS is telling everyone that they had an error on their return, I don't think that this many people with the same issue could all have an error, I'll bet the IRS is just telling everyone that so that they can place the blame on us instead of taking credit for the delay. I'm really frustrated because I was just going off of the January 30th date that Turbo Tax gave me until last night, that was the first time I checked Where's My Refund, so now I'm going to have my bank account in the red if my deposit doesn't go in today. Really sucks!

But you could always make the low offer and they can counter offer or say they are not negotiating on price.     In this market I would guess they would make a counter offer somewhere in between and you can go from there.    Bid what you want to bid and what you feel is right, not what your dad tells you, no one really knows how someone else will react so you just have to do what you think is right.|`|rGWiOVDIaa	Go for it.

676d10c0f66a8a7b48b37a6ef35a74ccaa	Last time I checked, the underwriter is a person employed by a financial institution (bank, etc) that makes the decision whether to approve a loan for an applicant.    When people call up a bank to get a loan, they talk with someone, a loan officer or some other consultant.  This guy does not make the decision of whether to actually offer you the loan.  They can give their advice if you have a good chance (or bad one).  They can also tell you the specifics about the loan.  But they do not make the decision and you canNOT talk with the underwriter.  They make it priority to shield you from him.  His interest is the company and/or shareholder's investments, and you are a risk to their money.    A "commercial multi-line underwriter",,  hmmmm...  A commercial underwriter sounds like someone who discerns loans for businesses, and a multi-line sounds like a line of credit/cash where the collateral is the business (including its equity).    That's my best guess.

FEb0qWoVaa	Hello,    I went to LJCC (Loring Job Corps Center) in Limestone Maine. I studied Computer Tech. I actually thought it was more of a college environment, but once I got there learned that it was mainly designed for dropouts and criminals lol. It was a good place though. I miss it a lot. I'll tell you a bit about it.    If you're going to go to a campus, I'd highly recommend the Loring base in Limestone. It's very scenic and the staff people are all nice. I'll run you through a typical day:    You are to be out of your dorm by 7:30 and make sure your bed is made. Eat breakfast (the food was really good, though everyone complained about it) and be at your shop by 8. Lunch break at like, 12.. Eat. Shop until 4. After that you can pretty much just do what you want. Dinner ends at like, 6:30. They have a rec center, where they have a little movie theater, a gym, a gamer room with computers networked together and a huge tv where you can set up gaming consoles and play with people. They also have a music room (I was the music room manager) with a drum set, a piano, a guitar, a bass and a mic. It's a fun time. They also have an art room. AND they have a raquetball room which is awesome.    On Tuesdays there is linen exchange. You take your pillow cases and sheets to your RA (Residential Advisor) office and get new linen. On Thursdays there is Stewardship. From 6:30 - 8:00 PM you're in your room cleaning. Dusting, vacuum, etc. They'll come inspect it and such to make sure it's clean.    At loring, you'll only have one roommate, and share a bathroom with a dorm next door to you that usually has two people in it. Sometimes you'll score and not have to have a roommate, though they are pretty laid back when it comes to requesting roommates.    There is a lot of drama up there, fights, etc. But if you find a small crowd of good people, you should be able to avoid most of it. The ratio for guys to girls are like 5 to 1. Drugs and alcohol are strictly prohibited and last I knew they banned smoking, but it caused such a... problem, so I don't know if they've let it back in yet or what.    If you want to leave campus, you can do so on Friday after shop. You have to sign out and sign back in on Sunday (If you live on the campus, that is. I'm from Massachusetts so I lived on the campus)      You can bring stuff with you, and you have to log in just about every item so they know what you own so theft isn't such an issue.    I lost a ton of weight up there!! The buildings are so damn far apart there is so much walking involved throughout the day. Plus the gym and the raquetball room and they serve healthy food. I went up there and weighed in at 300, and when I came out I was 248. I was only up there for about 4 months.    And as for how long it takes to complete. That depends really. I already had my diploma and passed academic testing so I didn't need to take academics or do any GED or diploma program. Some do, and some even get their driver's license up there. And there are some courses that ARE two years so you could be up there for a long time if you wanted to.    Overall it was such a life changing experience. It's like a little secret society up there. It's quite amazing. There are a lot of idiots at every given time, and it seemed like each new batch of kids were worse and more ghetto every time, but you learn to stay away from negative people. If you can handle a very structured lifestyle with a strict routine you'll be all set. It was one of the best things I've done.    Oh, and yes they do pay you. It's like $25 bi weekly. To most of the people up there, it was not enough but I live cheaply and since you're living for free up there, it wasn't bad at all. It was more than enough to get the things I needed. And soap, shampoo, etc are provided up there. Also, they pay you upon completion. Things may be differently now days because I was up there in 2006.|`|sEvDjT78aa	I went to job corp for 6 months and I kinda liked it. I went to Potomac Job Corp which is in Washington DC. The thing about other job corps is that they are located in other areas that are in the woods and are not very good if you like going out and having fun. Friends i know that went to other job corps in other states that were transferred to dc said it was so boring because it was not located in the city and they had nothing to do! But as far as the teaching other locations are better. if you go to job corp go for a hard trade like plumbing or electrical. I did administrative assistant and i can not find a job because most administrative assistants have degrees from colleges!! but i did get my HSD and that was what i really wanted. While you are there you will get a LITTLE bit of money which is meant to help with necessities. and also every weekend you can either go home or do some activities on campus. but depending where you live going home can get pretty expensive!! if you want to know anything else just email me.

Hx88UGlpaa	So far the only thing Obama has proposed as a tax cut, would be less money deducted for ss tax in your paycheck...so, if it all passes, if you get paid weekly, it'll amount to about 20 bucks, if it's bi weekly, around 40.00...it's not that much of an increase or help at all..but...it would be a little extra each paycheck.  It was supposed to run the course of approx 2 years, and 500.00 for individuals, 1,000.00 for couples...Sarah...I hate to tell you, it passed the HOUSE...not the Senate, the Senate can still reject it..|`|AcWMpmPwaa	i don't believe those numbers have been worked out yet...still has to pass the senate. not sure what you by applying to 2008 tax year, i believe it's tax free if that's what you mean.|`|da226878178305e69798e83c0c9aa3d8aa	well for one thing, i'm not sure it will apply to the 2008 taxed, but probably not.  and this stimulus plan is bs. you will be taxed extremely more and don't get anything out of it.  it's not a "tax break."  trillions of dollars are supposed to be in it and 9/10ths of it doesn't go to the people.  obama is an idiot. the goverment can't "create" jobs.  he's turing this nation socialist.    so anyway. expect a whole lot of taxes coming your way. and it will affect you, but in a bad way..

Like you, I always payed on time.|`|AA12065007	Most all credit card companies have whats called the universal default clause in their terms and conditions this means that if they check your credit and find that you have paid someone else late or not at all suffered a foreclosure, bankruptcy, collections, tax lien, law suit or just about anything else they have the right to up your interest rate to the State maximum, lower your credit limit or cancel your card all together regardless of how you have paid them in the past.|`|FKhWEd5kaa	Many credit cards have begun to tie your available credit and interest rate to your overall credit score.

That rate went up to 27 cents per mile for all medical miles driven after June 30th 2008.    If you provided charitable assistance to a midwest disaster area in 2008 tou can take 36 (41 after June 30th) cents per mile for miles driven related to that assistance.    Qualified mortgage insurance premiums. The contracts have to be made after December 31 2006.     General State and Local sales taxes.    Property destroyed in a disaster (not caused by you), or theft (not arranged by you). You will need to talk to a professional if you are going to take this one, because the code and calculations are complex here.    Personal Property taxes. You only get this if the tax is assessed yearly and is value based.    Real Estate taxes. Take only if the tax is value based and the assessment is uniform across the community. There are some nuances here so you'll probably want to talk to a tax pro for this.      You can deduct taxes from foreign countries and from US possessions. This is usually investment related, and most people don't get this.    Home Mortgage interest and points. They are deducted in the year paid.    Investment interest can also be deducted only if the interest paid is on a loan for property held for investment purposes. You'll have to attach form 4952 to your 1040.    Gifts to charities or churches. Be sure to keep records of what was gven, what it is worth on the market, and who it was given to in case the IRS decideds to audit you. No sense getting hit with back taxes and penalties because you forgot to keep a record. The gifts can be personal property or money. Keep you recipt either way. Oh, and you can deduct last years charitable contributions that were not used.    Unreembersed employee expenses. You can check your W2 and see if it has any reembersments from your employer.    Gambling losses to the extent of winning.    Partnership losses. These will be listed on schedule K-1 Box 2    Federal estate tax on income recived from the deceased. This is because tax was already paid by the deceased's executor. Despite the Government's greed, they rarely tax income twice (at least in such an obvious fashion).    You can take an exemption for your spouse, kids, or other dependants ($3500 a pop).    Alimony paid. HSA contibutions. Moving Expenses. Child care.     There are a few others that can be had. Just check out my source and look over a 1040. The 1040 is available at your local IRS office, college, library, or on the IRS website (www.irs.gov). And they are all free, so please glance over them.      Finally you will want to check with a CPA or other tax pro if you are at all unsure abou a deduction you want to take. It is better to pay $100 than to have to pay $500 in professional fees and have your life ruined by an IRS audit because somthing was not documented to their liking. Guess what?? The fee for tax preperation is also deductable!    Best of Luck to Ya!|`|1c4256f905a272aacbd200f6119e4124aa	That really depends on your situation.   You can claim medical expenses if they exceed a percentage of your Adjusted Gross Income - 7.5% to be precise. The total expenses must be more than that amount.    You can claim mortgage interest paid, including interest from home equity loans. You cannot claim interest paid on car loans, credit cards or other loans.    you can claim charitable contributions. You can claim the proven value of goods or services donated to charities. You can claim moving expenses, including mileage to and from your old and new places in order to move--IF you had to move to be closer to a new job. You can't claim moving expense if you simply moved your household.    You can claim sales tax or state or local income tax paid.     You can claim other things as well--but these things need to be proved, and you will need to fill out the Schedule A to the Form 1040. You cannot claim any of these things if you don't fill out the income tax "long form" (the 1040.)     There is plenty of information available on the IRS website: www.irs.gov

Also your mom should have set up something in her will if she had one. Did she have a life insurance policy to pay the house off? Sorry for your lose and good luck.|`|FpUcT5u4aa	Yes, you do need to qualify for a loan in order to have your name on the title.

If you cannot qualify for a loan, the bank will own the property.

What they do is they send you a bogus check.  What happens the bank tells you you have to waite for the funds to clear.  Then while you feel safe and secure, you write a check or money order to this so called son.  They get your check or money order, cash it and then you find out the money they sent is bogus.  They end up walking away with your money and you are left holding the bag.  You are now out 3000 of your own money and are stuck with all the fees for lack of funds.    That is why he could not go Western Union.  Western Union requires you have the funds up front before they will issue you a money order.    Go to your local law enforcement.  Give them all the information and the check.    There are many money scams coming out of the continent of Africa.  They use the funds they scam, for terrorism, drug trafficking, illegal guns, other weapons like land mines, and human slave trade.
BLMh0dG6aa	My beast guess is, if you had these problems B-4 you got the card, they've already done it, which is put you on a higher interest ate card; but having no card and no other debts also hurts your credit rating, as an Insufficient Credit History" rating; so don't take any drastic action w/o looking into it.    Also late payment swill almost certainly bring you trouble with the school which may cause you fiscal problems immediately, as well as down the road.|`|YMHwOBlaaa	Talk to your school before you just not pay that first quarter. You may be able to strike a deal with them where you can pay a portion of the $1800.

5cd65fca68a8e4880afd3f1b31db04a9aa	The previous answerer is correct up to a point.  You can't legitimately claim lots of deductions in order to lower your taxes during the year to magically at year's end have the "deductions" disappear.  And while your goal is to "save" the money, it's not yours to save, it's what you already owe the government.  With interest rates what they are now, any interest you earn will be minimal, and having that money at your disposal will make it very tempting to dip into the pot during the course of the year.  Why take the risk of being short at the end of the year?   The IRS has a help line you can call without identifying yourself, and ask more questions about the status for your wife.  You can get the phone number from the website, www.irs.gov.   There shouldn't be a problem with taking two deductions, one for you and one for your wife.|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	Get your tax forms straight is  1.

If you want next to no taxes taken out, then you need to claim a very high number of deductions on your w-4.  I believe 18 is the maximum.

5Gxll9Hkaa	Just under 1.1 million Americans filed bankruptcy in 2008.    ref:    http://www.creditslips.org/creditslips/2...    Given that over a million Americans filed bankruptcy last year, it would not be surprising if "at least 5 people" asked questions about filing bankruptcy on Yahoo!Answers every day.      Actually, I'm not sure it is that many.  I answer a lot of questions about bankruptcy in the USA on Yahoo!Answers and I don't think there really are 5 new questions about bankruptcy in America each day ... although it could be close to that.  But a lot of those are multiple questions by the same questioner and/or questions from people who haven't filed bankruptcy and later decide not to and/or questions from other countries.    Responding to the larger issue:  bankruptcy is really not an "easy way out" of debts which could be repaid.  If the debts could be repaid, the bankruptcy court will require them to be repaid.  People can't just file bankruptcy because they don't "want" to repay debts (well, they COULD do that, but if they have the means to repay the debt the bankruptcy court will require that they do so).    An even larger question is: do some Americans take on more debt than they can possibly repay?  The answer to that is, of course, "yes," some do.  But my experience (and also the results born out by virtually all bankruptcy statistics in the USA) is that most people do not intentionally take on more debt than they can repay.  Usually there is some precipitating factor that causes debtors to be unable to repay debts which they genuinely thought they would be able to repay.  (In fact, debts which are incurred with no intention of repaying them are specifically NOT eligible for discharge in bankruptcy.)      According to the research of Elizabeth Warren, a bankruptcy expert on the faculty at Harvard law school, more than 50% of all bankruptcy filings are preceeded by a significant medical event which impacts the debtor's ability to repay.  That could either be medical bills, or the inability to work (or to work as much) as a result of a medical condition or injury, or some combination of both.  Other research has shown that the single factor most predictive of a bankruptcy filing for families in America is having a severely disabled child.    Other factors which have large impacts on bankruptcy filings are divorce, job loss, mortgage foreclosure (often bankruptcy is the only viable strategy for keeping the family home out of foreclosure), and disability of the breadwinner.    So my opinion is: yes, maybe you are being a tad too harsh.    EDIT: One more thought: Also, one other thing I wanted to add... most people who file bankruptcy are somewhere between deeply ashamed and embarrassed about the fact that they've filed bankruptcy.  A lot of bankruptcy clients "put on a brave face" to the outside world to hide their own shame or embarrassment.  So whatever they tell friends or relatives about their financial situation may not be the same things that their lawyer knows.  I have absolutely seen clients who are drowning in - say 100's of thousands of dollars of medical bills for a severely ill child or spouse, or drowning in credit card bills that they wracked up buying food and medicine while looking for work after being laid off by their employer through NO fault of their own ... who've walked out of the attorney's office only to put on a fake "attitude" in front of their friends and family ("Yeah, I went bankrupt to get out of my credit card bills, ha ha ha, you ought to try it" blah blah blah) when their real situation is MUCH more serious than that.  The attitude is all fake.  I don't know WHY some people do that, but some do, and I assume it is out of embarrassment or shame.|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	Well bankruptcy isn't' the way out like it used to be. If you claim bankruptcy you have to pay it back. Most people have a common misconception of what bankruptcy entails. I wouldn't recommend it b/c then your still out the money and your credit goes to crap for the next 7years.

OnnwkKZnaa	Here is the situation.  Yes you can buy this house, but only if you can qualify for it on your own.  This means, for the past several years you have filed separate tax returns, your personal credit is good enough to qualify, AND your income in enough to satisfy the bank's requirements.  If any one of these three criterial are not met, your husband's finances will be considered and you probably would not get financing in today's market.  Sorry the news is not better.|`|t1qAcTZbaa	You don't say how long you've been married, but the bad things on your credit report only hang around for 7 years. Are there any good things on your side of the credit? Probably, right now, you won't be able to buy because you have to have almost perfect credit to get a loan from a bank, because, due to the financial crisis, the banks don't have any money to loan. So, unfortunately, though the home prices are now low enough for people to afford a home, there isn't any way for them to get a loan. Then when this is over, and the banks are back in business, the home prices and mortgage rates will return to their normal out-of-reach levels. So, no more bad choices, and  buy some things, and pay on time. Maybe someday that dream will come true.|`|KhBmlaefaa	Try FHA. You might be able to get one just using your credit if yours is good.|`|f2b9bac6ba2f1b4719753cb0987d5d4faa	Then u should not buy a house right now. Save more money and have a larger down payment.

Banks learned their lesson, so unless you have a HUGE downpayment...good luck|`|DbK7oJMraa	Unless you can afford this home on your own you are out of luck.  Your husbands credit is the problem even if you were the primary borrower.  The economy has changed and they are not going to give loans to people with even minor credit problems (which is why the first stimulus package was a joke)  The only thing you can hope to do is pay off your husbands outstanding bad debt.  Re-establish his credit by opening new accounts under his name.  Unfortunately this will mean High interest credit cards.  Carry at least $150.00 on those cards for roughly 6 months without missing or being late on a payment and his credit will improve. (I say "carry at least $150" dollar balance or the company usually won't report it to the Credit Bureau.  It doesn't do your credit any good to just have a credit card)  I know this is not what you want to hear, but that is the way it works.  Given the housing Mkt this house you want could still be available and even cheaper than it is now?    No your credit is seperate unless you are both on the agreement.  Joint accounts reflect on each of your credit ratings.|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	Im afraid that there will be no bank that will loan you money for a house in this financial crisis with a record like that. You can try to qualify for a loan with just your name on it (if you have decent credit) . There are companies out there to help you fix your credit, but that will take a while to do. And even then it may be difficult for him to qualify for such a large loan.

Some seller's or builder's don't like dealing with USDA because you don't really know when you'll close, make sure your agent has worked a USDA loan before and can explain it to the seller or builder at the time of offer.

Most people think of a corporation as a large entity with huge plants and many workers (IE Mobil/Exxon), but again if you have proper filings, a corporation can be just one person who does a few odd jobs (if more business, then like some have said previous, local ordinances may not allow business conducted in a residential district..if you are incorporating and are going to be larger than my main point, talk with your city/town offices first to avoid issues).|`|EaGk5P9Vaa	It most certainly can.
