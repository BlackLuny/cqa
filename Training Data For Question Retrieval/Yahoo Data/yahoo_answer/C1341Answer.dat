Iarvsn7yaa	I really understand this dream.    You wanted to be accepted by your friend. You are someone very sincere in your relationships. You invited strangers to your room, which means that you see yourself as being someone who is kind and willing to help people - and you look for them to appreciate you. But when this girl had a criticism of you, you couldnt take it because you felt that you were so sincere that you didnt deserve it. You felt that she's just being cruel for no reason. (which she probably is).|`|BiY6gDguaa	i think you are working out your breakup w/ your friend in your dream-your conscious is reassuring you of why broke up-  -the girl in the dream that KNEW you, SOUNDED like a friend and talked like a friend BUT really was NOT a friend:  that's the friend you broke up with...|`|AvwveaQvaa	i think you still have some unresolved issues with that person. and your mind is probably telling you to Just remember all the good times you had and not to focus on the bad ones. you had a good run, just keep the good times in your head and forget the bad ones. i hope i helped you out a little. :]
rc4B8Vdaaa	I will give you our political and economic analysis,you will see on it the superior quality of our analysis and the inferior quality of the analysis done by Capitalist "economists".    "The entire world historic landscape has changed. The exacerbation in September-October 2008 of the world capitalist crisis that exploded last year takes unprecedented dimensions driving to collapse the world stock markets, the international banking system, gigantic industries and a growing number of States on the edge of default.             The global crash has already taken place. The capitalization of world stock markets has halved; losses on debt instruments now amount nearly $3 trillion, and debt destruction inexorably continues; there is a "near-disintegration of the western world's banking system" (Financial Times, 28/10/08) despite unprecedented State interventions.              World economy is contracting; The IMF predicts for 2009 a generalized recession in the developed world as a whole and more than 20 million new losses of jobs. Conditions of starvation produce already hunger riots in the so-called "Third World" countries, and the falling of commodity prices will accelerate the bankruptcy of raw material exporting countries. Nothing can be the same anymore.                Nearly two decades ago the disintegration of the USSR was celebrated by capitalism as "the end of communism" and of History itself; now capitalism itself faces its own implosion in its metropolitan centers, in the United States, Europe and Japan. The post 1989/91 myth of an apparently triumphant liberal capitalist system, including the fantasy of a "uni-polar world" centered in the "unchallenged" American Empire has collapsed.           The strongest capitalist superpower on the planet, capitalist America as a whole, not solely the evaporated US "sub-prime mortgage market", is transformed into the most "toxic asset" of the global system. Trotsky had predicted that America rising to world hegemony accumulates all the world contradictions as dynamite in its foundations. This dynamite, accumulated during a century of expansions and crises, of wars and revolutions, is now exploding changing the shape of the world in the 21st century .......    continues|`|P4yT4JWAaa	unions have priced themselves out of jobs, for one. they can't even afford their own products. and all the bailouts. i realize sometimes big corporations need help,but some of these people are highly incompetent-or just don't care.(they will get their millions in bonusses even if they bring their company to bankruptcy). i think much of this bailout money should go to the everyday consumer who will use it to pay bills; or wwill at least spend it in the areas of their homes. this will ensure that the money makes it back into our economy and won't be spent on frivolous vacations overseas or on million dollar bonusses to overpaid ceo's who are failing their companies and our once great country.|`|YIW1KIi6aa	www.heritage.org/research/EnergyandEnvir... - 93k -  www.onlinejournal.com/artman/publish/a... - 33k -  www.groundreport.com/article.php?artic... - 37k -   www.rense.com/general69/econm.htm - 36k -  www.associatedcontent.com/article/1022... - 54k -

xGb2CBgkaa	OPEC has about a dozen countries, but they in total only produce 1/3 of the world's petroleum.  The last time OPEC wielded any power was in 1973, when they controlled 2/3 of the world's petroleum.    The reason why they don't have the control is b/c they have only 1/3 of the worlds oil production, divided among its many members, and so when they try to set some production quotas to try to drive up price, there is too great an incentive for countries to cheat and produce more.    Let's say you're one of the smaller OPEC producers.  OPEC told you to limit production to 1 million barrels a day but you decide to cheat and produce 2 million barrels.  It's impossible for your partners to know you cheated b/c you are on the honor system.    Plus, you have major oil producing countries now like Russia and Canada who will be happy to take advantage of any price increases by selling as much oil as they want.  And there are just too many energy alternatives such as coal, natural gas, nuclear, wind, etc.    OPEC will likely not wield any pricing power going forward.  They certainly have little to no pricing power now.    Not that I have any sympathy for OPEC (I don't, they made enough money off of me), but these countries derive essentially their entire government funding from oil production.  They will run big fiscal deficits going forward.  This is why they're rather desperate to try to get oil back up to about $60-70 per barrel.|`|AA10023809	They could do that, if they were driven by hate of US. But I doubt they are. Governments of these countries are driven by greed for money and power.     Money-wise, they are getting maximum profits when the price is at a certain level (around $70/barrel, I guess), so they manipulate output to achieve that price (if price gets too high, people drive less, so OPECs profits go down too).    Power-wise, anti-US actions are a tool to retain domestic power. Their rulers blame US for what really is their own failures, such as poverty and lack of jobs outside of oil sector. They use Israel and Iraq to keep fundamentalist Muslims distracted, lest they start going after indulgent rulers.  They also bad-mouth US to discredit the pro-democracy voices in their countries.     So yes, they do increase price, but there is nothing personal in it. Strictly business.|`|rc4B8Vdaaa	Most of Oil in the World is not coming from OPEC.Are you a Zionist?When Oil was at 150 US dollars the reason was the speculative actions of Edge Funds .I remember those ignorants that said that the reason was China and that USA was not in recession.    aaahahahahaha!

3ISGQ4Csaa	That's a good question. sometimes when a person passes out it is because of an inadequate amount of oxygen to the brain. Passing out can also be caused by hypoxia, where the whole body or just a part of the body is deprived of oxygen, because the lungs aren't working properly because the person isn't breathing. When we are confronted by a horrifying image, we may temporarily stop breathing from the shock, and, if we aren't breathing for a while, then our body is deprived of the oxygen and we pass out. I'd imagine that that would take a while though. I've never passed out.|`|C0yagFFoaa	safety mechansim, if we fal unconscious we dont have to see the crime etc..|`|1QLp7iC5aa	its your body's way of protecting itself, of course I've never gotten to pass out, ever. So I guess my body doesn't give a crap about me! lol... but seriously, its your body's way of self preservation, its like an animal feigning death, it keeps your mind and hopefully body safe until the danger is gone.
m89kGXBnaa	There's an argument for it - it's certainly abnormal. Most people are capable of impulse violence (coming home and finding your family murder/spouse cheating etc). Few people are capable of cold violence (there was a study of soilders in WW1. The majority, at the start, dilberately aimes over the heads of the enamies. They had to be taught not to care about killing).    So in that sense, it certainly is a disorder - psychopathic killers (not the majority of killers), serial killers, sadistic killers, etc... all have disorders.    However, like other criminal disorders (peadophilia, for exampel) these people are still rational and capable of understanding the consequences of their actions. So they are still culpable and liable. If someone kills in a schizophrenic episode (extremely rare) they are not, so they are less liable. These people have a disorder but also control over their actions|`|872f4d28837b0b839ed695238bef2e97aa	From a natural point of view it isn't because the ability to attack our peers is part of how evolution wired us, it is a resource for survival.  When someone kills, his mind is working as intended, his circumstances drove him to the kill, his mind did what it was designed to do: adapt to the circumstances.    From a society point of view there is a tendency to label "diseased" anything that is harmful to the majority.|`|bO2rzfISaa	I think that murderers are largely sociopaths, which is a personality disorder. This is not insanity, as the defense for insanity goes here in TX.|`|OikNR8Ufaa	I dont think so, I think it's more mental if you just randomly do it for no reason without thinking about it.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	No.  It has to take a lot of thought and planning to do something like that.  There have been many people commit premeditated murder and try to use mental illness/insanity defense and after psycological evaluations, it is usually determined they are/were not mentally ill.|`|1QLp7iC5aa	No. I think it is a lack of self control. Maybe something  close to ADHD, the inability to control your thoughts, but to a much further extent. Most people I think could plan it, but following through would stop most people in their tracks. Well, so maybe I am changing my answer while typing this...I dont think its a disease so much as a disorder.|`|TDGhHIvNaa	To a degree yes. There are serial killers who thoroughly study and stalk their victims prior to actually killing them.  As most of society would never even think to do such acts or go to such lengths means that there is some sort of disorder there.  Should that be used as a legal defense to get them off--no way.  A lot of slick lawyers, and criminals themselves try this route all the time.|`|p3NW0Mstaa	No- Pre Mediated means of sound mind when thinking it through.   Like a project, it takes planning and good follow through skills to complete the task.  You may be insane and be able to plan a murder, but the murder would not be a mental disease part, they were already that way.|`|C0yagFFoaa	no,most people could kill some one given the right stimulus.   ie: they come home and find their family have been murdered, the killer is still in the house and you have a gun.|`|PwgDhNyNaa	No. It's mental if it comes from nowhere. Maybe some other mental disease can cause a person to commit pre-meditated murder but usually no. they just claim insanity.|`|YtcLq3d5aa	No. Thinking through a horrific action and still being able to go through with it is alot more sane than impulsively killing someone.|`|ogUJ6G0Caa	The word itself implies you are of sound mind. Enough so that you can plan an entire murder. If you have a mental disease, you cant "pre meditate" anything. Hence why if someone with schizophrenia for example, commits a murder, they go to a mental institution not regular jail like a sane person would and also why you can go free for killing someone else in self defense.|`|WMrNa3Doaa	I don't think the ability itself is a mental disease. And I know alot of people say that if it's premeditated, you must be in your right mind in order to plan it, and that you cannot blame it on mental illness.    But what about in the case of a stalker, someone who becomes to obsessed with another person, all they can do it eat, breathe, sleep that person. Using every minute to plan on how to see that person or follow them. Maybe they even have a shrine to them and pictures plastered all over the place. They would spend time planning, constantly. And when they planned to kill that person (maybe because they want to be with them forever or some other nonsense), that also takes premeditation. However, it's clear that the person is obviously bonkers.    So, if your question is can someone commit premeditated murder but still be mentally ill, yes. The ability to plan something is not exclusive to the sane.|`|tGDOZrUTaa	Not at all. Insanity is a traditional defense to murder, due to lack of required mental state. In NY, the rule is that due to a mental disease/defect at the time the crime was committed, the defendant lacked capacity to know a) nature and consequence of conduct, OR b) that such conduct was wrong. (A deliberate and premeditated murder (first-degree) requires specific intent. An inability to premeditate lessens the guilt to second degree or common law murder, in NY.)

6ELSwKKvaa	Yes, most know from a young age they are different and learn along the way how to behave in certain circumstances to appear normal. Many become very helpful member of society and never go out and harm anyone because they have learned they are not suppose to.    Edit: Guilt is not the only thing that makes a person understand they are different. The way people react back to you including your parents would also be a sign to them that they are different. Most do not alter their behavior because they feel bad, they do it so they can stop getting punished by society.|`|R75tldc8aa	I hard that a sociopath feels no guilt over what they do.   So no I don't think they see anything wrong with what they do.|`|9kjpm2oQaa	I heard they are born without a conscience,there for whatever they do that is considered wrong by society,they don't see it as wrong. They do not feel bad about it @ all.So maybe they really don't think theres anything wrong with them.|`|REffunLGaa	sure|`|OLbo7Fvxaa	Most people will not do something they believe is wrong. A large portion of sociopaths believe that they are justified in their behavior. They are generally comfortable with what they are doing.  a smaller portion have compulsive urges that they are unable to control, these people will be much more distraught about their actions and may even seek help.|`|suLTN10laa	Wow, that is WAY over generalized to answer-  I am sure there are some that do and others who don't.

Then empathy goes out the window agian.    too much empathy is not good ether. it also can over rule logical thoughts and behaviors.|`|pkHSuJi3aa	oh man! thats kinda funny. anyway i doubt they actually realize it so they cant help it|`|qq804CE8aa	From what I've learned - most sociopaths don't think there is anything wrong with them.|`|qB4KvbDiaa	i think all sociopaths no how they r ,as well as everyone  else around them.i guess u never know when it hits you,or weather it can be controlled.|`|fe8RxYsfaa	No.  They think they are alright and the rest of the world is crazy.

She is obviously acting like a damn fool coming all up in your face like that. Dont take it soo personal dude. However, if you feel you have other emotions that are surfacing and you cant figure out why, then maybe you should speak to a professional, you know just to let out your feelings? maybe you got some repressed childhood issues you dont even know about. but as far as i see, youre fine!|`|qB4KvbDiaa	you should not bring personal problems into work,|`|xjBFwsVMaa	Dude... you have to take up for yourself and not let people walk all over you. Just ignore this girl she sounds like trouble. E-mailing her or talking to her face about whatever it is, is causing you problems. If she starts bugging at you completely ignore her. If your allowed to bring in a portable cd player, mp3 player, ipod or plug earphones into your speakers and listen to some soothing music. If you get to stressed just take a break (if your allowed) and get out of the office for a few. Maybe a quick drink and a short walk then back to the office. Have one of those squeezy balls too just incase tension gets to high and you can't go anywhere. It sounds like to me that you have security and self confidence issues... and that's why you are becoming more introvert because you are afraid of what can happen. You may need some sort of therapy. Maybe not professional (though I do believe that can help as I am in therapy myself for similar reasons) or talk with a friend about it. Sometimes that helps as well. If someone starts putting you downn stand up for your self tell them what you think in appropriate terms.... and why you think what you do about whatever is going on. If you continue to have problems at work maybe you need to talk to a supervisor or manager. Or perhaps if it gets to bad then you need to find a new job.|`|c4XBHw6laa	yo listen wat it is  you scared of people that all and you are shy yo fear no one stand for your self you no wat ever comes ta ya head speak it we called that speak ya mind and dont hold bak the more u hold bak the worser it get my ***

If the people in your life are making you unhappy, find someone else who makes you feel good, and focus on them instead.  What are your interests?  Hobbies?  Focus on your number one!  (You) and do what you love, and what makes you happy.

I think I was around 3-4, based on the size of my brother in the memory.|`|il7bLkSIaa	I remember A LOT from the age of 4 and up...but never age 3 or under|`|mggll8dRaa	Feeding the Chickens and the Ducks...!!|`|ogUJ6G0Caa	My first memory was when i was 2 years old and ran naked from the bathroom where my mom was about to give me a bath, into my room across the hall to get a toy. My dad saw me and proceeded to beat the crap outa me with his belt and then kicked me when he threw me down. All because i ran naked across the hall to get a toy to play with. Can u imagine? anyways, thats the only memory from 2 years that i do have. most of my memory began at about 5|`|5QF6n2g7aa	something thats been haunting me for ages, when i was raped at the age of 5.|`|vOTcVMsdaa	I don't remember it fully, but I always get this warm fuzzy comforting feeling when I would see the care bears (the older ones - not the new ones on TV today). I told my mom about it and turns out my bedroom as a baby was care bear themed.  That was really cool and freaky at the same time when I found that out!! LOL. My subconscious must remember it.
SUR1MHqWaa	I believe a child should stay with their mother until they are 3 as this is the most important age in a child's life and bonding in this time is crucial to their relationship. I do not believe that a family should stay together though if the parents are unhappy because the child will pick up on this and become upset. A child can have an equally good relationship with each parent even if one lives in a different house.    I am a happy mother of 2 who is married and I have stayed at home with my babies|`|7i6qj4OXaa	As someone who has studied psychology, I firmly believe that mothers should be at home with their children until they are at least two years of age.  This is because children suffer from separation anxiety.  If this is not possible, a good substitute would be grandparents.  I was lucky enough to be able to stay at home with mine until the youngest was eight years old and now help with the care of my granddaughters.
UmZznLuhaa	Agree completely!  It is *so* pompous and silly to assume that people who *want* a living wage and are willing to work for it, can just *get it*, with a snap of their fingers!    People work far more hours now than they did 40 years ago, but if you adjust the salaries to inflation people make *less* in sum for their labor.    Go to China and Japan - do you ever see a Ford truck or a Jeep Liberty? No?  That's because over there, they won't even let American vehicles off the ships for their consumers!    But when it comes to Toyotas and Hondas, they are only too willing to fight for them to be shipped over here!  That is because time and time again, America keeps getting *shafted* because of globalization!    Our corporate tax rate is the highest in the world!   American companies, therefore, have no choice but to hire Chinese and Indians to do the jobs meant for us!  It's time to say ENOUGH! It's us AMERICANS that are the developed economies!    Indians and Chinese should make their *own jobs* for their *own citizens*!  If capitalism is to work in the US, there has to be strong regulations and barriers to protect decent working Americans from economic exploitation!|`|rc4B8Vdaaa	US Working Class will become increasingly aware about the burden of supporting a parasitic class ( bourgeoisie).This is how History is driven.A class replaces another class.It is very possible that the money from US Tax payers will be used to nationalize US Banking system because bankers are refusing to invest a single cent,US people will realize that they really own all that bankrupted banks.    We are very happy!We love all this mess!|`|ebqQAzk1aa	I am all for socialism, but with incentives to keep the working class working hard.|`|4Z5T98pKaa	It's funny that you mention the greed of the rich. how do you define greed? according to my definition, everyone is greedy, with money, time, the safety of their loved ones, etc.    i am greedy. i want money. as much as possible. i am not rich.    why do you think your so-called greed is killing the working class? are the presidents of companies, who are greedy, not paying their workers enough money? is that a good example? are they selling their widgets of too much money? is that greed? that's what i would do, if i had a factory. i suppose you would welcome unions, pay your workers a lot, a nd sell your widgets for too little.
c7b7aspZaa	My theory on this is there are more females than males on the planet. As the reproducing gender of the species, there is more competition among women for the attention of others, especially men, to ensure procreation of their genes.      Why be nice? The old adage, "You can catch more bees with honey," seems fitting. Through centuries of trial and error, women have realized that being nice and fitting in tends to yield better results. Being a beezy will catch a few blokes, but being nice will catch more.    Another reason, and perhaps one that holds an equal share, could be that humans are social animals. We have a strong desire to be with our own kind.  Again, people want to be around you if you're attractive and cool.    As for your last part about you personally wanting to be "smarter and just not worried about..." it, it's very difficult to forgo something that isn't conscious.  For example, we're bombarded by advertising every single day. Every ad connotates that women must be attractive and nice to be successful at anything. After seeing enough ads over and over, it becomes subliminal.  Once your reasons for doing something become unconscious, it's hard to stop doing it.

qjHUuwIXaa	One wouldn't necessarily be introverted or boring.  It's actually rare that three people will get along equally, the two who talk together more may have a longer friendship than you with them, have more common interests, be more talkative, demand attention, etc.      I find this goes on a lot with me and my friends, too, but then again I am content to not always be talking, and kind of enjoy it.  Maybe I'm still a little bit introverted ;)|`|aZXnW6AUaa	too hectic|`|652f1ace7d0e4554d654822f229e8c9daa	Neither. That person may talk allot because you listen to what she has to say.

If that makes Sense to you.|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	could be introvert but what have  you don't to participate in the convo?   have you asked questions to the other peopel? or do you just make I statements!   like I like xyz.. i don't like this next class     instead of talking about yourself!  make them do the talking.. then the tables will turn!     people love to talk about themselves@!  or most do!   and i can think that the other girl who gt's talked to more! makes the girl who is talking feel good and she get's to say what she wants to day!     control the conversation!  by asking questions!   they wiill think your interested in them in turn feeling better about themselves who don't want to feel better about them self!  so they will hang out more!   to keep that feeling!   hope this makes sence!    wish i would of known this in highschool!|`|kFE7wL8taa	There probbally not talking to you as much as to the other because you feel that they arn't. They can probbaly recognise that your feeling insecure and will wait until you start talking to them..... That a bit confussing so imagine this.....    2 girls sitting next to eachother on swings. The 1st girl is thinking "she looks nice but ill only be friends with her if she talks to me"  The second girl is thinking "she looks nice but ill only be friends with her if she talks to me"  See, its like a never ending circle....    looveeyouulottss xx|`|872f4d28837b0b839ed695238bef2e97aa	Yea you might be boring.

f05277e680abdc8e4d01ac4fff6a95ccaa	Be yourself!!! Quit trying to be something you're not.  It sounds to me that you are to focused on what other people think instead of worrying about what you think.  Find something that you REALLY enjoy and put yourself into it.      The world is big and can be quit scary, but if you let yourself be scared you will never be yourself.  I think you should try doing some really outgoing things...go skydiving...go bunji jumping...go do something that is so extreme that normal activities seem mundane.  Or you could try taking a speach class to start out...get into some sports...just push yourself WAY out of your comfort zone!|`|kK2mecABaa	The only way to be less shy is to put yourself into situations where you are shy.

People in general are too self-conscious and should not be. You could have a social phobia if it really bothers you to be around people. Do you sweat when around others? Does your heart rate rise in the public arena? If so, there are ways, such as self-talk, in which you tell yourself before you go public that you have that confidence and everything will be fine. If it is real bad, then seeing a psychologist/psychiatrist is not out of the question. It worked for me at least. Always walk with your chin up and smile at others...|`|ZAqlySc1aa	Well don't let nobody intimidate you, always stand for your self. if you keep letting people run over you they always going to do that.

mULJMC0waa	This is hard to say. Sometime if you have a bad experience with someone in the past it can carry over onto an new friendship. This could be your case. I hope that you were not hurt by someone else. Also gut feelings about someone are usually right. If this is happening to all of your friendships I would caution the gut feeling and feel out the relationship. So to answer you question it could go either way. I hope you can figure this out. It could be hurting a great friendship with someone.|`|0c6ca298bfb2c525a1855a0052583340aa	You're probably picking up on the frenemies vibe that many people give off.

Tolerance is a learned behavior, comming from being socialized, and or traveled. Some people very much stay and live their lives in a small community of shared values, or they themselves are a more solitary person.  In this day and age of fast stressful living, I can understand nesting and not wanting more stress but then I'm in my fifties. I myself find alot of 60yr olds too old thinking to hang out with, and can only handle my 20 something kids and their friends for short periods before I become like you.  But people are endlessly interesting, and its fun having a husband that is a really good at small conversation and friendly, he really is socially very good!

It sounds like you are in some pain, as you call yourself "Full of Regrets".  One of the things that helped me when I was going through depression after a tragedy was to find things for which to be grateful.    Sometimes all I felt like doing was sitting outside in the sunshine, and some days, even that did not seem like enough to keep me going.  But, when those times come, it is important to look around you, and find the things that DO make it worth living...things for which you are grateful.      Look around the world and see how better off you are than a good 75% of the world's population, who live with poverty, disease, hunger, war in their neighborhoods, and more...    Find someone locally to help...there are soup kitchens, half-way houses, food pantries all over these days that are stretched beyond capacity because times are hard...lend a helping hand and let the salve of helping someone less fortunate heal your hurt...    When you can begin to take your days one day at a time , instead of an hour at a time, you will know you are improving....find some help...find a counselor or a pastor or  a trusted friend in whom you can confide...confession is good for the soul...    Hang in there...you are worth more to the world than you think you are!|`|15jfF0tKaa	First off, my husband gives me a full body message. Then he takes me for a country ride or to my fav places.  So he is my first line of defense.   Most often though I pray. (the way of the cross, or rosary) I read scripture also. My relationship with Christ is paramount to living  on this planet. He will help you if you but ask and believe.  Also Joyce Meyers program encourages me---its only a half hour.

BNhLWBEqaa	You know how it`s saying : after the night shines the Sun  So believe in the sun ! When you feel sad, be happy, that after a few days/weeks/etc. your life will turn into better&cooler stuff, and when your happy be happy, just think about that problems may come sooner like you would imagine  About your Job : be happy that you can leave it, if you don`t have the heart for it ! Think about that maybe you will find a job which will be way better  About the gf : women come and go, appear & disappear, and see the good thing : if she doesn`t see you as a men, just remain friends, because that means that the Life shows you : She isn`t your soulmate  If you catch her up like gf , about the gift : don`t be scared, okay ? The gift it`s something from You to Her, it reflects your personality, your feelings, and this is beautiful ! Just be open-minded and you will find the perfect gift !  p.s. I suggest you to search for another woman, women are a lot ! Just imagine : You, You`re new gf, Valentine`s day, and you handing over the gift ,maybe some surprise too !  Hey, if you won`t have a gf for V`s day, don`t mind ! When you will have one, you will know to value it, if you will have a gf next year, you will know to be happy, that in 2010 you have a gf , looking back, you will see that in 2009 you made this day special only for yourself, in 2010 you will make it for someone else too !  Good Luck ! Life is Just a Game ! Enjoy it !|`|100BcRpTaa	I'll give you the advice I basically live by when I feel down.    "Stand taller and laugh louder. Keep things light, happy, and walk with a smile on your face and you will always feel better."    This means when you are down saying negative stuff isn't going to help.  Look at Stand taller and laugh louder, ok so when in a bad mood just remember you will and can get through it. Have a good time and lighten up.    Next, Keep things light and happy and walk with a smile on your face and you will always feel better. Lets take your situation - Your jobs sucks so you will probably leave.  Say to your self with a smile "I didn't need that piece of crap job, now I can go out and take time to look for a job I enjoy."    As for finding a girlfriend we are back to stand taller and laugh louder and always remember to wear a smile.  Maybe right now isn't the best time for a girlfriend but let your personality shine through and some one will notice. No girl is going to want to be with a some one that is so depressing.    Good luck to you and I know you can get through it. :)|`|sziO5hK7aa	I am goint to be honest, you life sucks. but you can change it. it takes effort, you will have to push yourself beyond your limits. nothing of value comes easy  read this book: the game by neil strauss
P4Jc76GPaa	I believe the root of your problem stems from a few things. Your stalker could cause anxiety when you meet new guys until you feel comfortable with them. The problem is that you aren't in a state of mind right now to try and get close to someone. I believe this is from you breaking up with your boyfriend of 5 years. he was unemotional, which you could relate to from your past. You are not over the relationship because I can still sense some love and pain in your message. if you want to start feeling better about yourself and possibly seeing someone again, you are going to have to make the first step. You will need to start talking to these men to find out if you have anything in common, or is there any chemistry. You will need to trust your instincts, but you need to start thinking about moving on and starting fresh. I hope this helps. Good luck.

anF78HOxaa	I can see where you're getting your opinion from.. but if we all were to do that, decide WHEN we are to die becasuse we've had enough of life and have seen and experience all that we'd want to.. well it would be much much different. Because if you were to die earlier thinking you had enough.. well you'd never KNOW if you had.. because you'd never know what you've missed out on and stuff.. because as the days go by.. technology goes by.. if you were to die in the next month or two.. and then in late 2009.. they were to make like flying skateboards or cars or something.. that would be something you'd never get to experience. You'd just be left out on a bunch of new things.. but you'd never even know it.     But you're also right with there being nothing wrong with getting assistance to die if its what you want.. because we all see and feel things differently so we all have our own opinions. I don't there's anything wrong with it.. but i think you would be missing out on a lot.. but if you didn't carea bout that .. well i don't think you'd be doing anything wrong. just be an organ doner! lol     i think the people out there who are not as fortunate as you who don't have a healthy lifestyle and money and health to go out and be able to decide for themselves that they're ganna die at 36 or whatever wouldn't agree with you on that though. =\     You're only given one life.. might as well make the best of it  I'll leave you with that   lol|`|Kw2J0whGaa	I don't think there are laws against it or people oppose it simply because its 'wrong'.

Its not ur choice whether u want to leave this life or not. its god's. And u will die when hes ready.

If somebody is thinking about commiting suicide they should find something worth living for and hang in there. It could only get better as time goes on. Time is the best medicine.

And yes, absolutely, it is your [our] choice and the state has no reason or, in my view, power to interfere.    There is nothing wrong with assisted suicide.  It's simply made by law -except in Oregon and soon [maybe] Washington state- by the dominant class (typically white old men) to be judged wrong.      And those concerned with "assisted suicide" being some cover for murder ... please ... between the politicos and lawyers that issue can be addressed without panic and fear.    In my view, these judgments are short-sighted and based on weak and myopic interpretations of religion as well as social perogatives.  As an example of this "weak and myopic" rendering, consider that these same people (out policy- and law-makers) have absolutely no problem -or conscious- when it comes to murdering people of other countries under the guise of "war" or "changes in government."    It is hypocritical and absurd to believe that the people who scream against assisted-suicide are the same folks who allocated billions of dollars for weaponry to kill people ... it is non-sensical.  At that's just a social position.    From the "individual" point-of-view, the state has no (zero) right to interfere with the wants and wishes of any individual as long as those wants/sihes do not detrimentally affect the community ... and let's be clear, other than in someone's narrow thinking can you argue that my choice to end my life affects my community.  If that type of logic is used then it's an easy transition to "well, then every death affects the community"  ... therefore "no death affects the community."    The underlying question is why is there such a formidable resistence to assisted suicide and whether or not the answer -or, at least part of the answer- is found in the "economics" of the dying.  Let's be candid, there's a lot of money that goes into keeping people alive -even when there is no quality of life or when the individual would choose otherwise.|`|NJyYpYiYaa	I actually agree with your statement, my only reservation is that it's a pity you have to go to Switzerland for this.

Tal vez lo confundes con la desesperacin, imaginate que tienes 14 a?os y tu novio tiene 15 y de pronto resultas embarazada, nadie te apoya y simplemente tienes que hacerle frente a la situacin, y no sabes por dnde empezar, te casan a la fuerza y debes depender econmicamentede alguien que ni trabajo tiene, que harias?     Bueno, ese problema tuvo mi esposa cuando eramos novios, de acuerdo por culpa de ambos, es miedo e ignorancia si tu quieres, pero debes controlarlo y enfrentarlo, no hay otra.    Lo mismo cuando tienes un arma de fuego enfrente y la empu?a alguien que quiere quitarte lo poco que tienes, no puedes salir corriendo por mucho miedo que tengas, lo mismo, debes controlarlo y desarrollar el valor enfrentando el miedo.     En otras palabras el miedo es lo que mantiene a este mundo activo y en constante progreso, digamos que el miedo es el padre de la comodidad y la desesperacin es la hija de la ignorancia.    Bueno, ya te cont algunos de mis traumas.

El miedo se aprende, excepto al ruido y a caer, son innatos. Y si se aprende se puede "desaprender" o superar. Por lo general con la accin misma y sobre todo a la repeticin.

w0UB3S3Maa	Woo ... take it easy, that's far too many goals to set yourself!     Pick 1 or 2 at a time, you're more likely to achieve them and feel good about yourself.         |`|AA11812015	Just be a kid.  Dang.  Maybe get a girlfriend.  |`|53e825bd7214ff8635097f3a354c0738aa	maybe the goals you set do not mean anything to you one way or the other, so it doesn't matter if you hit them or not. Another problem with the goals you describe is that they do not appear to meet the criteria of being SMART - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-boxed.     For example, rather than saying 'getting better at piano', say 'learn to play such and such a (challenging) piece of piano music and perform it in public by a certain date'. Do the same with all your goals, and then actively work at achieving them, with a proper plan, where you can see your progress, and tick off once achieved. The good feelings that come from doing something in this way will encourage you to stick at other goals ...    At the same time, wean yourself off the computer by rationing the time you spend on it each day, to a certain time of the day for a certain period, and that is all you are allowed. |`|NJyYpYiYaa	Yeah me too, (Well OK, maybe not the Break dancing bit) and these are probably familiar feelings to quite a lot of people you know as well.

cab63c7629d665e7d2f0151df748fdd5aa	When people are neurotic (OCD, anxiety, some depression, etc.) they are attached to reality and affected by it.  When people are psychotic (episodes can occur in schizophrenia, bipolar, borderline) they are detached from reality.      If you tell an unmedicated bipolar person they are insane during a psychotic episode (when they appear insane) they are too detached from reality to get it.  If you tell them when they are medicated and not psychotic, I would argue that they're not insane.    I think you have to define insanity.  Does it mean "mentally ill" or does it mean "psychotic and out of control"?  The above argument is based on my understanding of the definition to be  the latter.|`|d607be78b22052655b29d90f0342ca59aa	it depends from other peoples view points.  some people may seem insane, but to them it isnt, then there are those situations where to you it may seem insane, but that would be because you didnt understand or know the missing peice that would make the situation understandable and not the least insanely toward the person you beleive is insane.|`|LXiZWJ4Baa	I would assume a insane person would stay insane whether or not someone told them.|`|32Ldv6Sbaa	Well, first you'd have to assume that the insane person would actually believe that they're insane when told. If they do, they're still insane. If people say, "Someone who is insane does not know it," it's a generalization; they just mean that SOME people who are insane aren't aware of it. A lot of insane people are aware of it.    If you're talking in a nonrealistic sense and saying that, "Anyone who's insane doesn't know it," then technically telling them they are would make them sane. (Then again, you could kinda go in a circle because once they were sane, they would believe they were sane, and thus could become insane again.)    Anyway it's a silly question. =)
45d774f93cd8fa9f498a7d7487bd0caaaa	For the sake of our own supposed comfort and of ideas of more habitual safety, most of us are attracted to qualities that we know well, to qualities that we are well acquainted to.    In addition to having given you your life, and thus genetically being a lot like you, your own father resembles you, and you are quite well acquainted to much of his behavior if you grew up under his care.    Therefore even while dreaming of a blue prince and of great adventure, it is quite well possible that while thinking of the choice of a male you almost automatically will turn your own attention towards one that resembles you thus also resembling your own father.    But naturally women, and also men, sexually are sort of often attracted much to exotic persons because of the unconscious inclination towards some genetic renewal.    But, having a duty towards our tribe and caste or class, towards our own local human contexture, in the choice or in the acceptance of our own spouse we may have to decide for somebody of our own people or nation when we may try and make a family of our own.    The admonition "Moglie e buoi dei paesi tuoi" is well known to italians in that it means "Choose wife and cattle from your own village"! Many women may even go nearer than that, in that they will choose a man that much resembles their own father, and there are women who marry, or are given in marriage to, a cousin in their own tribe for the sake of purer race, for in-breeding, for preserval of own family riches or values.    Thus many things are true in this world, even the fact that women often are attracted to men, even much older men, that resemble their own father.|`|NJyYpYiYaa	Could be.

People give symbolic meaning to things. In that sense, hair has been given a symbolic meaning in many ways. Men wearing long hair was related to freedom and non compliance. Short hair in men is usually related with formality. Black people in the USA started wearing an "Afro" look during the 60's as a way to demonstrate that "black is beautiful", in other words, as a symbolic way to strengthen their identity. You will always find that people tend to use their hair in a way that relates to their ideals and personality, so we "say" things with it.|`|AA12018289	pubic hair can grow on your head if you think too much of sex.|`|AA10762368	Hair like sheep's hair is that given by Allah to "his" sheep who "he" leads out of the wilderness and into the glorious nature's bounty and they live as they should do so.

Why do some good people get treated badly, could be because people will treat you they way you allow them to.  Good people are generally less aggressive and operate from a non judgemental and non confrontational stance.  You need to be at an advanced stage of emotional evolution to know that violence breeds violence and that it is time for humans to stop beating our heads to the same brick wall.  Why not try a different approach?|`|d1af129c0a31108c895fa2c27fe0efbfaa	The job of psychiatrist is not to solve the problems (if the solved your problems you would not have to go to them anymore), but to make you have more problems so that they can tell you that you need their help.

UD0qpONQaa	Men and women continued to wear three unstitched garments, as in Vedic times. The main garment was the antariya of white cotton, linen or flowered muslin, sometimes embroidered in gold and precious stones. For men, it was an unstitched length of cloth draped around the hips and between the legs in the kachcha style, extending from the waist to the calf or ankles or worn even shorter by peasants and commoners. The antariya was secured at the waist by a sash or kayabandh, often tied in a looped knot at the center front of the waist. The kayabandh could be simple sash, vethaka; one with drum-headed knot at the ends, muraja; a very elaborate band of embroidery, flat and ribbon-shaped, pattika; or a many-stringed one, kalabuka. The third item of clothing called uttariya was another length of material, usually fine cotton, very rarely silk, which was utilized as a long scarf to drape the top half of the body.

Come si diceva qualche anno fa, al tempo del femminismo, la paura di essere stuprata, serve perch la donna stia al proprio posto.  E' cambiato molto nel costume, da allora. Ma non abbastanza.

Llorar es parte del ser humano, es una necesidad para desahogar emociones y sentimientos fuertes.   Al igual que las mujeres, lloran por muchas razones, porque quebro con la novio, porq un familiar murio.... hay muchas razones.   Llorar no es signo de debilidad, sino que es signo de fortaleza, de superacion porque ellos tienen el valor de demostrar que no necesitan ocultar sus sentimientos para sentirse hombre, ellos son lo que son.. y no tienen miedo de mostrar sus debilidades porque como seres humanos, todos sentimos temores y llorar nos alivia ese temor.|`|0ADOskcDaa	porq somos seres humanos, yo soy como le sucede a shakira, "lloro una vez al mes y sobre todo cuando hay frio", tambien es bueno desahogarse de vez en cuando, cuando sufrimos algun dolor sentimental, bueno entre otras cosas, tenemos derecho a llorar y no me impor lo que piensen los demas.|`|VIMHC4rPaa	si lloran porque tienen sentimientos aunque algunos lloran nadamas por chillones porque son el sexo debil|`|pyeedQF3aa	hmm pro un amor por un a perdida, no por cualquier cosa claro esta sino por algo q realmente los motivo, por ejemplo cuando una chica toca su alma.

She should be able to talk to the speech therapist in her high school to talk to about this, but if not, she can find one by going to the American Speech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA) website's "Find a Professional" section.

CuX1RLp1aa	That sounds real similar to me, the avoiding loving parents and severe depression, cutting. If you think about something like getting help, you'll bail out, but if you DON'T think about it, you won't bail. Just go to the school counselor or whoever, and don't think about it at all.|`|NJyYpYiYaa	Nat,  go and talk to someone, anyone, someone you love or someone you respect, or even someone like a Church Minister or who is qualified to listen.  But do go and talk and do it right now.     |`|a0e785ff77fcd81dc3d86d3303e42917aa	Stress happens to all of us so you are not alone.  You just have to find the right way to deal with it even though that may be difficult is well.  Just be thankful you are alive when so many other people in the world have it much harder.  Keep your head up!
OwotHpa6aa	Ambition can be good & bad. For an instance, Adolph Hitler was an ambitious man, and it is his acts that brought disgrace and destruction to human kind. On the other hand, we have Mahathma Gandhi, the well known Indian who is called the father of non-violence. He was ambitious too, but his acts brought glory to his people and harmony to many more.|`|KCiTtdayaa	No, I don't believe that.  People with ambition have strong mind and don't give up.  |`|NJyYpYiYaa	Damn right, and I work for just such a person.  His ambition is so great he will disregard safety just to get a job done on time and cheaper.  A quote I find myself using to him is:  "Always remember who you climb over on the way to the top,  because these are the same people you will rely on to save you as you fall"   
6ln1IWadaa	If they are nightmares, then there are a number of things you can do. The number one reason people have nightmares is because of subconscious problems being drawn out but watching something disturbing before bed...possibly scary movies or the news. Also, diet... Do not eat a heavy meal before going to sleep, at least 4-6 hours. you might also try exercise. Often when our bodies are very worn out, our minds tend to not focus on the normal activity and tend to the needs of the body. Hope this helps you a bit. Also, if this is re-occuring and very disturbing you may need professional help. Get well soon :)|`|57f9561499a48f9b24fcf46b5c8f7974aa	I too have very vivid, strange dreams (including one where I turned into a squid to escape a pursuer).  This is normal for me, but it's also exacerbated by certain medications.   Anti-depressants increase sleeping brain activity some.  The worst I ever came across though was when I was taking both Paxil and Trazodone, (Paxil for anxiety, and Trazodone to help me sleep)  My dreams were so vivid that I would wake up feeling just as tired as when I went to sleep, and because I didn't want to dream, I would alternate nights sleeping and staying up all night.  So, bottom line, if you taking any medication, talk to your doctor.  They might be able to adjust your level to help lessen the intensity of your dreams.  If you're not on medications, some other things that affect dream intensity are pot, stress, external stimulus while sleeping, and just natural body chemistry.  Definitely talk to your doctor if your dreams are leaving you feeling exhausted, or if they are inhibiting your ability to sleep.  Restful sleep is important.|`|b4QpFkL7aa	pray before bedtime. |`|wKkeHX3Kaa	Your dreams relate to what you do in your day, so when you go to sleep, think about the routine and normal things that have happened that day, rather than the unusual things.|`|300ivj1yaa	don't eat anything heavy before you go to bed  are you stressed or worried about something???    it will pass|`|DyIoNhKWaa	this sounds dumb, and like a joke answer,  but try m@$turb@t1ng  before bed. seriously, it works 4 me.    I AM NOT JOKING!!!|`|Z0GZeATJaa	From the little  know from my Psych class, its perfectly normal.  Dreams are your brains way of sorting/filing information. Making sense of the day.  I dont know what your dreams are about.  But it could be possible that there is an unresolved issue/problem going on in your life.  It may weigh your mind and cause your distress while sleeping.  Another suggestion is you could not be getting enough REM sleep.  Make sure your not lacking any sleep.  Sleep is vital to your health and well being.  Sleep restores your body, replenishes you for the next day.  Try to compeltly relax yourself, whether that be a bath, shower, some calm music.  It may help.  Good luck|`|AA12158031	I too have had some really weird dreams these days and weeks. Maybe some strange biorythm.

Try reading a good book before bed (like the bible) and pray and have a nice cup of tea. Think about happy stuff as you dose off. Dont drink caffine at least 8 hrs before bed.

mCAWxobNaa	Anything short of utopia will not meet the feminists' expectation of "social equality."  Defining what that means in plain language is impossible.|`|BkleL3F4aa	i think there needs to be equal representation in "male dominated" fields.    even if the ratio of females to males that are interested in that particular field is 20/80, the outcome must reflect parity between the genders, otherwise its sexist and proof that we are living in a patriarchal society designed to oppress women and protect the fragile male ego.|`|62ZBofvPaa	Equality would be a world where gender doesn't even matter in how people judge you, where you are seen as an individual first, where everyone (men woman or transgendered) acts like themselves without needing to fit a certain gender role, only fitting it when they want to.|`|7LSonIoraa	social equality has already been achieved for women tomboys/butch are not seen has deviant|`|qPlx1Ejhaa	When as many women die at work as men do (currently men outnumber women 20 to 1).|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	well one thing would make me happy is if you opened up every military position for females.

That woman wouldn't have thought it OK to ask me to help her get her carry-on into the overhead compartment last week.|`|P1VXjLPOaa	The bottom line! A world with out morals or standards. A world where outcomes are controlled. Where the unacceptable becomes acceptable. Where once we saw uniqueness, we will now see sameness. Where God's laws are replaced by man's laws.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	1. A generally weaker military because 'some people' got in because of lowered standards or quotas.  2. Increased unemployment among males because they were pushed-over by women who were 'equally qualified' who got jobs just because of their gender.  3. A weaker fire-fighting force because 'some flat-foots' got in there because of lowered standards of testing.    Some or all of these SHOULD happen for Feminists to finally realize that equality is indeed achieved.    Well, to the TD'ers : There is no feel-good answer here. How can you expect a strong force when certain people got in through quotas/lowered test standards? Think LOL !

AA11532132	Questionnaires are less confrontational. They are also confidential and anonymous. It also allows the researcher to study a broader range of people, because interviews take a lot more time.|`|Mf2YLNyEaa	I THINK HAVE BOTH WILL REALLY GET TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER.!!!!!!!!|`|NAGiNKFWaa	You can post your questionnaire here and you get tons of answers from such a wide range of people and genders and age groups.

Can't influence the person as much through a questionnaire    That's all I can think of.|`|AA10332346	Because questionnaires are usually private and discreet and no one knows who is answering them if there is someone interviewing someone else they may be pressured to answer loaded questions.
Kil7sZUSaa	He is not ready yet to move on to another relationship coz he could still be in love with you.  Meanwhile he has some "needs" so he's going with the easy, cheap and available access.    Or just maybe that's the type of a relationship he's more comfortable with.  He cannot handle a serious one like the kind he had with you.|`|RWEyZZXWaa	Tell him to get a grip and join the Marine Corps.  6 years humping up and down the hills of Afghanistan hunting bin Laden should clear the crap out of his head and make him see life as it really is.     It will cut down on his drinking and give him a reason for liking the girls who shop at Lane Bryant.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	maybe he's just trying to keep his mind occupied so he doesn't think about you and this chick is the only way he knows to do it?    or maybe he's just a goofball... only you could tell.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well it would appear that he has given his life to a bottle, and there is nothing you can do to change that.  Even if you made the mistake of getting back with him, he will continue to choose the bottle of booze over you, and it doesn't matter how pretty or thin or perfect you are, the bottle is always going to come first.  You dumped him, now move on with your life and find someone worthy of you.|`|AA10529198	You need to move on.  It is none of your business what he does.  You should leave him alone.    And for you to put this girl down, because she is overweight and a bartender ?? Seriously ??? Who are you ?    As to who might be his type ??? What do you know, and - in fact - what business is it of yours ?? Move on.  As to whether he is partying too much.. it is none of your business.    We all "love" our ex's - And, he would probably answer the "booty call".  But, now it is time for you to leave him alone and move on.  He's lucky that "you" decided to break off your relationship.    Quit guessing what his type is, and move on.  He is over you, and has already moved on.
AA10652430	I agree. Yes, I have heard of the show, no I don't watch for most of the reasons you mentioned.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	no. its hot.|`|84gK4XlHaa	Reality shows are crap.  Every one of those women has a producer whispering "Be more of a b*tch!" off-camera, and they do because that is after all what they're being payed for.  And I'm sure that as the producers keep the free liqueur in full stock it becomes easier and easier to follow their ques.  There's nothing "real" about it.|`|rjj75n6Yaa	Feminists love that crap, I personally could'nt care less about Oxygen, And I swear every time I see a chick pretending to be bada$$, I lose interest in television shows|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	I'm not a fan of reality shows in general and I've never heard of this one nor would I watch it.     But I think any shows that makes a spectacle of people who probably need counselling or at very least some private way to heal their demons is exploitative. Whether it's men or women, young or old, I don't think my entertainment should come from other people's problems.|`|A71Uu05Uaa	Shows like that annoy me more than just about anything in this world.    It's glamorizing women behaving badly.  They're not being exploited.  They are getting attention, which they love.  This is exactly what happens to women when nobody teaches them morality or shame.  It's a horrid train wreck and I have no idea why anyone watches it.    If you want to see hot chicks, just get some porn - they get naked in porn.|`|dGwa8sFPaa	No, I try to steer clear of that reality show garbage unless it features conjoined twins or mermaid girls.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	A: I watch it, purely for voyeuristic reasons.    B: The show is pathetic, but they are exploiting themselves.    C: The show does nothing to show women in a good light.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	I don't even watch Oxygen channel. However, I don't see how any normal man in his right mind who has a daughter, would enjoy watching a show like that.   From what you explain here, the show is about many uneducated parents who thought, the "school" should be doing their "parenting job". I don't enjoy watching even "wife swap" or "super nanny" with her stupid "naughty corner". Wtf? Ridiculous how parents, feel the urge to go on National Television and learn "how to raise your own child"! How sad for our young children and not to mention Society !|`|pYimIJAWaa	Yet another good reason to not waste money on cable TV.
AA10187097	You think he might be gay? It sounds to me like this guy is competing for your attention by bringing up subjects he thinks are more interesting. If he annoys you that much,though,maybe you should ask him if he's gay. That might change his behavior,just like a cold shower.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	If I were you I could care less and would say something to him, or start giving him the cold shoulder.  Make a comment like 'do you like that guy or something?'. That should embarass him enough to make him snap out of it.    Freaks will be freaks. Don't try to figure them out, they'll only confuse you.|`|trMsK86jaa	If you really want to find out, i suggest you punch/slap the person who is constantly attempting to draw your attention away from this other guy you're talking about.    It sounds to me as if;    Guy A and Guy B have history - perhaps even only a few words or harsh glances, Guy A considers Guy B to be a threat to his popularity for some hidden or unknown reason.    Which is why he spends so much time talking, he's afraid if he stops Guy B will get an edgeways in and people will realise that Guy A really isn't as great as he makes out.    Basically, Guy A is exhibiting neurotic behaviour and this is making Guy B look bad because he's good at hiding it.|`|3CWoQ10kaa	it seems like they are trying to prove to the other that they have a batter relationship with you no matter how minuscule the relationship is|`|kqXQA2ILaa	he is gay and flirting withh you
rjj75n6Yaa	Because you're guaranteed whatever you like.    I however, have never done that before because I am respectable of myself.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	The women who don't think there's any problem will be the same who don't think the men going to prostitutes are creepy losers. Just FYI haha =o)|`|3862H0WVaa	I think it's more of a thrill and a prostitute will do anything (if agreed) you want.  You might have a kink for example that you don't want anyone knowing about or would be embarrassed asking of an ordinary women.  Some men actually take pleasure in paying these women to do anything he wants as it's his fantasy.  Men like variety so many different women and types of women would be appealing.    I've only done it once when I was on a trip to Amsterdam and found it great fun ( though I am not proud of myself ) It was really exciting at first, you know , the forbidding.  But the actual sex is actually really disappointing and mechanical.  There is still that thrill of the unknown though|`|H55nCLqPaa	What that guy says doesnt surprise me in the slightest. The whole arrangement is just a lot cheaper, easier and more hassle free than going through the official routes for obtaining sex.     Probably the best advantage is that the price is agreed beforehand, unlike with marriage when you only find out how much of a bill you ran up when she leaves you.|`|NsFaPI9waa	Because it is ordinary for men to have a higher sex drive then women due to a hormone called testosterone.     I personally don't have a problem with prostitution.   Is it degrading for the woman?  Yes I think so but after all they are the ones willing to take off their clothes for the money. No one is forcing them to. To be honest they are the last ones laughing because they pocket a damn fortune for not a lot of work! There are a limited number however, who would lower themselves in such a way.    I agree with 'Guy, 52.'   Sometimes men just want sex. No strings attached, emotional BS sex. I don't think it's right if you're already in a relationship but if you're free and really desperate why not? (EDIT: Because I assumed that to seek out a prostitute, you need to be quite desperate for sex, lol. Someone who spends a lot of money on just a couple of hours must be quite in need of it. It wasn't 'snide.' Lol)    It's a hella lot better than raping someone, right? At least the woman is willing and giving her consent.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	Because they need no strings attached sexual relief, and are willing to pay for it.    Legalize it!|`|qPlx1Ejhaa	Prostitution is a very honest and simple arrangement - she sleeps with him for money.  Relationships, under all the games and pretence, are very often the same thing.   Women are attracted to wealthy men (see the list of most eligible bachelors) and men are attracted to beauty.    http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Inv...|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	because they are horny.    And if they are seeing a prostitute they aren't "respectable" now are they?|`|fDGPbwdsaa	Perhaps they simply find it cheaper to acquire the services of a prostitute than to marry one.    However, soon thanks to feminists  - as usual - things are about to change and the 'cost' of hiring a prostitute will increase.    Accounting that feminist groups (and classes) have repeatedly claimed that all men are rapists - feminists in government are making it that any man using a prostitute will be charged as a rapist from hereon even though he clearly has not raped anyone.    But why let reality get in the way of a hateful, bigotted movement.    Sick.|`|62ZBofvPaa	It isn't an issue.  Just because an article somewhere is written about why ordinary men visit prostitutes, doesn't mean that women want to stop it or some ****, though I think certain religious circles might....possibly law enforcement too.    And it definitely doesn't mean anything with respect to porn, which most women consume anyway.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	Look, it's like smoking: I don't know why anyone would choose to do that to their bodies but they do and it's their choice in the end.    I can't think of any woman who's paid a strange man for sex so perhaps it's hard for us to understand because we don't have the urge or drive.    I think doing a hooker who's done 12 guys already that afternoon is pretty gross and I would obviously not want my husband doing it. I would be happy if we lived in a world without prostitution but that's not likely to happen.    At the same time, I think it's better for all involved for it to be legal and don't really care if men I don't know go to one.|`|AA10584077	Marx, stop shooting off at the mouth, you dumbass. You don't speak for all feminists, and judging from the picture you've chosen for yourself, your frat brothers don't know anything about the movement either, so stop pretending as though you're some sort of authority on the subject.    I'm a proud feminist, and I am also very firm in my belief that we should legalize prostitution in this country. Not because I think it's a good, wholesome business to get into or support, but because the world has apparently never gotten along without it, and it might as well be regulated. That, and because I'm concerned about the girls who get involved in it that have no legal recourse if they want to leave. Pimps, as far as I'm concerned, are the only truly bad guys in the entire industry.    I recognize and appreciate what the man you quoted is saying, and if his decision is to never get married again and to visit a working girl every once in a while, that's perfectly fine with me. Why? Because the dude is SINGLE. He's not disappointing anyone with his exploits, because he is unattached. He's off the hook (and on the hooker), so to speak.    The only issue any woman should ever have with a man visiting a prostitute would only be if they were also sleeping with said man (e.g. husband/fiance/boyfriend). This is where legalization would also come in handy; theoretically, you could keep records of the johns that visit a prostitute and then cross check them to see if they're cheating on anyone. There are registries online for child molesters, why not johns?
YQOT68xFaa	I think it saves a buttload of trouble!! I think you're right, if people waited for marriage there would be far fewer unwanted kids and the STD rate would be much lower than it is right now. And I bet there would be fewer broken homes as well. Safe sex is a myth. There's safER, but not safe. Condoms break; pills aren't all that effective (I know several women who conceived while faithfully using the Pill); some diseases can't be prevented by using protection. Safe sex is a myth. If people just stopped engaging in risky behaviour there wouldn't be so many people reaping the consequences of risky behaviour.    Hubs and I both waited. Totally worth the wait! We have no regrets, we don't have to worry about getting tested for STDs because we are not at risk at all...and we have a good time together too.  ; )  There are no cons to waiting.      ADD because I couldn't resist...  "If you've only ever done one person, you'll always wonder in the back of your head... Is this good? bad? I wonder how that person over there would be in bed.    Would you buy a car without a test drive? What if it turns out to be terrible?"    I've only ever done one, and same with my husband. And I never have to wonder if it's good or bad! It's so illogical to think that way, really. I know he's good because - get this now - I have alot of fun. It feels good. He knows what I like, I know what he likes. It only gets better with time. I know it's good because it's good! The only caveat is that the couple needs to communicate and focus on one another's needs instead of only seeking to gratify themselves. And that really isn't hard!|`|KfG4cv6Yaa	As a means of controlling both unwanted pregnancy and STDs it is excessive.  Both of those things can be kept in check by being responsible, using contraceptives, and not being promiscuous.    EDIT to Trevor (above): yes, exactly!  In a world where everyone is a serial monogamist, i.e. has a short term devotion to a single partner, and is not 'promiscuous', it is far easier to control STDs.  Promiscuity is the main cause of their spreading.  I don't equate serial monogamy with promiscuity, if that is what you're thinking?    To the asker:  You say that people prove they can't take enough responsibility, so they should wait until marriage.  That is a form of taking responsibility - how do you expect them to do this?|`|iRKOJhYeaa	Well, i am 39 and i dont believe in marriage....|`|uXqDYPNVaa	It's not my bag. I prefer safe sex and I couldn't be paid to have it without protection.|`|pYimIJAWaa	Actually, I think it's the same religious-right lobbying for 'no sex before marriage' as for the 'abstinence only' education in schools that has a lot to do with people not using condoms, rather than "irresponsibility". Perhaps the solution would be teaching proper sex-ed in schools.    Also, why do you assume that "most people" are not using condoms? Of all the news we've heard lately about big businesses suffering losses and/or going out of business, so far not one has been about a condom manufacturer...|`|AA11532132	Waiting to have sex until you are married is a great idea! It is better emotionally, physically, and spiritually.   You don't have to worry about pregnancy or STD's.... Some STD's are contageous even if protective measures are taken. Take herpes for example. You can catch even if you use a condom and it is a lifelong thing. You will have it forever and potentially pass it on to your future mate. Not to mention risk not being able to give birth naturally if you have an outbreak when you go into labor.   You are emotionally healthier if you wait. I have heard the whole, "you would buy a car without driving it would you? What if the sex isn't that good." My answer that is, how would I know if the sex isn't as good as it could be, because its the only sex I've ever had and thus is great. P.S. Good sex takes time and practice. That's how it was in my marriage. It took awhile to get the hang of it, but now we are pros! ;-)  Spiritually, because when you sleep with someone you become spiritually connected to that person. That can be a bummer let me tell you!|`|TYl7kmPeaa	i think its a great thing too... at least wait until you are 18.. you are way smarter then and can actually make good choices for yourself|`|AA10652430	I think it's fine.  Also, it's fine to stay single...|`|W76VDFKCaa	I think it is a good idea to wait until marriage, although I didn't but I encourage many young girls to wait.  Sex before marriage has destroyed the family unit, there are more unplanned pregnancies, STD's are out of control,  etc.  I read the other day the sexually activity on college campuses are equal to the sexual activity in brothels.  Scary!|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	I think it is a great idea. I am waiting and I am engaged. I think it shows love and faithfulness to your partner to show you can resist any temptation to be with them. I think it is very romantic. :)    but I can also understand people who chose not to! EIther way, its personal choice. :)|`|ODORT37Paa	I think it's a great idea.  Then, when you're married, sleep with as many people as you can.|`|bGsXsDhBaa	it's stupid    Most people want to have sex by the age of fifteen or sixteen and thats exactly when they should start doing it    Most marriages fail and it's a failed and crumbling institution and there is nothing special about it - in fact there is a whole lot wrong with it - so why talk about 'sex' and 'marriage' as being connected at all?    The average first marriage ends within seven years (study: USA consensus bureau). Why wait for that??    Marriage is for chumps and sex is natural.    Play the field starting at about fifteen or sixteen and then have a series of one to one relationships until you're elderly and then hopefully you can see out the rest of your life with friends or a partner.      EDIT:    To JIMBO  (below)  Having multiple partners over the course of a lifetime ie what humans do naturally and the word 'promiscuous' is just a loaded insult.  Human beings are not monogamous: they can be for short periods of time but it isn't designed to last *forever*|`|rjj75n6Yaa	Thats great,...just as long as you're ok with being stuck with one c$@k for the rest of your life.    Pardon my french|`|egqveuPjaa	I wouldn't wait for all the money in the world!|`|joplKMsLaa	Waiting could be a good thing, but it wouldn't be fair if the other partner didn't wait either. So for me, what's the point in waiting?    Yes, pregnancies will be low and there will be fewer STD's, but it's all about protection also. People need to responsible.  And besides, what would happen if the other partner isn't good? A healthy marriage relationship also depends on the sex life. And if there are problems, they could either work it out, go to a sex therapist, or try something new. But it'll require some work.     However, I am astonished at those who wish to wait. That's very rare now these days, but I also hear horrible stories about marriage. Their partners cheating on them behind their back. One lady sued her husband because he cheated on her and contracted an STD, thus giving it to her. If that happens, you lost your chance forever and waiting didn't make a difference.    You can't assume now these days that just because you wait, other will wait and be faithful to you.|`|tTIXhe7daa	I am still a virgin and I'm 26 years old, and don't laugh|`|BkleL3F4aa	don't see the point really, marriage is gone now anyway, the failure rate and lack of interest/fear at the other end makes it unsustainable.    NOW are objecting to taxpayers money being used to promote the concept of marriage again.    Marriage will be gone in a generation or two.|`|mRnTvuOPaa	I think it's great. I didn't but have great admiration for those that do. It is a personal choice yes, but I agree kids these days (I'm only 23) need to think before acting. Too many unwanted pregnancies and STD's because people only think about the now. It makes me sad to see the age that some people start at. In my opinion it's something special that you share with someone you care for. Anyway........your question is what do I think...I think good for them!|`|7lPspOboaa	I waited and glad I did.  When my husband and I are together I don't have any baggage to carry into my relationship.      Not having sex before marriage made my first time very special.  A night I will always remember even after 20 years.|`|3e3a79551e54dcec91edbfed2b6166eaaa	I wanted to wait but I was at a weak point in my life and I had sex ONE time. never did it again. yes I am now a mother alone but accidents happen. and I have taken MY responsibility. sorry I am human and had to feel something one night. and God knows I have been punished enough so has my child. she can't help it her mother is STUPID.     Yes waiting would be best but you also have to understand people are human and do STUPID things with out thinking.     So yes waiting is better. but that's life I will try and teach my daughter NOT to make the same mistake i did. God Bless|`|PcjZrNwWaa	its prolly a good idea although many dont believe it is.|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Provided both people agree and stick to the agreement, fine.    Trouble is one person agreed while the other didn't.  What about people who still got STIs despite waiting because the other didn't disclose their past.  This happened a lot back in the Victorian Era. The women got syphillis because their husbands had went out and 'sowed their wild oats' and either didn't realize they were infected or chose not to tell them.|`|iHKJsyfTaa	No, no , no ! If the sex was not really awesome why would he want to marry you ?     A guy has to have a thrilling test drive before he buys.|`|dGwa8sFPaa	I think it's misguided. Well, Marissa, I believe it is misguided because a healthy sex life is of paramount importance to a healthy relationship.|`|OXP3tSuqaa	That would be a lofty goal.  I didn't wait either, but I wish I had.  I feel like saying to some of the next generation, "How's about waiting until after Junior High?"|`|A71Uu05Uaa	If people used condoms more often, there'd be less unwanted pregnancies and STDs as well.  Just be responsible, no need to go and do something drastic.    I think waiting until marriage is the more foolish thing you can do.  If you've only ever done one person, you'll always wonder in the back of your head...  Is this good?  bad?  I wonder how that person over there would be in bed.      Would you buy a car without a test drive?  What if it turns out to be terrible?

I suspect they were used in choking and cutting arteries in the neck so I will proceed with that assumption.  Sabertooths were big and strong and not particularly fast which tends to confirm they were ambushers.  Just focusing on the teeth, the canines in particular, saber teeth have evolved in various predators.  As the animal tries to choke its prey, it probably ends up having advantage when the canines are longer due to the physiology of the prey, specifically its neck.  If the canines are too long, they are prone to getting broken yet the longer it is, the more likely it can penetrate into the neck possibly cutting arteries and wind pipe.  The teeth evolve with the animals behavior and how it continues to kill prey.  Those successful cats that grab the prey by the throat survives.  Those successful cats that grow longer, yet adequately strong teeth preferentially survive.  They become very specialized killers, typically focusing on larger prey.  It becomes difficult for them to manage rabbits for example.  When their prey die, they typically have a hard time adapting to it and die.  That is why there are no known sabertooths left.|`|AA11415608	A good example of this is Darwin's finches,  finches living in nearby islands, but separated by geographical barriers, developed different characteristics according to habitat.

houWY7qvaa	Because in some instances it is overrated.  You may not have encountered it but racism does exist and it does hold you back.  That and the fact that they hold a monetary value on a person, whether or not they were born into money, prestige, fame, and then people whine that they have to take care of these people.  It's a vicious circle and we're all a part of it.  the sad thing is that they want to better themselves, but the elite will never see them as better at anything.  Harsh,but that's the bitter truth.  So, they're happy being themselves.  What's wrong with that, especially if they don't want a handout.  And you may not know this but many schools are scams.

To start with the 'smart people' from these areas always have an initial drawback and this is called Material and sometimes Cultural deprivation.    Material deprivation is simply not being able to afford certain things, in terms of education it can include things such as stationary, books for research, field trips etc. This can cause great problems in schools as I remember definately at my school, children used to get bullied for not having certain things and not being able to afford to go on trips.    Cultural deprivation is a bit trickier it basically means inadequate socialisation. This is where the children from poor backgrounds have been taught in a way which means that they can only relate to people from the same background as them, also a sociologist called Bernstein incorporated ideas of restricted and elaborate codes into the idea of cultural deprivation.     Restricted codes is what poorer people use, as they are only socialised with other poor people.  Elaborate codes is what middle and upper classes use, as they are taught how to interact with everyone.    It is also said that poor families do not instill the importance of education in to their children and that maybe why they go back to crime and the way of life they began in.    Self fulfilling prophecy is the last thing to look at when assessing this situation, sociologist Robert Merton said of the SFP;  'The self-fulfilling prophecy is, in the beginning, a false definition of the situation evoking a new behaviour which makes the original false conception come 'true'. This specious validity of the self-fulfilling prophecy perpetuates a reign of error. For the prophet will cite the actual course of events as proof that he was right from the very beginning.'    This basically means that people get stereotyped for different reasons, if a child is told he is stupid, even when he may not be, he will end up acting in such a way to live up to the stereotype he has given.    Therefore in the case of the mexican guy, he may have been labelled by certain people as a criminal, and in the end just decided that he would go back to that life as that was how people percieved him.    Hope that helps!|`|AA10292836	look at your comedians,who ope goldberg came from jamica queens ny,she's a multi millionaire,and many other people in show buisiness,if you want to definately be rich go into show buisness,you can do it!

Perhaps a great many people will begin to liken the American obsession with nationalism to how things were at the beginning of the roman empire.    But there is one key difference between Roman Empire and America - The Roman Empire conquered the KNOWN world, And now The Entire World is Known.    In terms of size and enlargement, America is in-fact rather small when compared to how the Romans viewed the world in their time.

One, people have dreams to relieve them of stress. So if you are worried about the ex, and perhaps pissed at her, in your dream you beat her up...sort of a "wish fulfillment" thing.     The part that bothers me is that Ben did not stand up for you. This could imply that you don't think he's always there for you, or that he wouldn't be when you need him. Did somethign happen recently to make you feel that way? I'm not sure what your relationship with your uncle is like, so I can't say what his involvement was. However, if you are very tight with him, it makes sense you'd sic him on the boyfriend and his ex. It also makes sense that you'd be especially pissed at all this happening at your uncle's house, a place that is supposed to be safe for you.|`|R0X9RONwaa	well obviously the ex of your boyfriend is troubling you...because you hit her. you might be subconsciously worried that your boyfriend still likes her or something?  and you might (key word there) be having problems with your boyfriend, trust issues, too little communication, not paying attention to you, etc?|`|W6zLJ96eaa	By the sounds of it, you're jelous of this girl. You don't trust your boyfriend around her (sorry this might not be true but the dream sounds like it).  i had ALOT of problems with my ex-bf's ex girlfriend, and when i see her i still feel jelous.   And if the part about 'you shouldntbe here', if its all linked together, it could mean your best friend knew something, and didnt want you to see them together.  But its just a dream, it might not mean anything.|`|7hAiw408aa	It seems that your boyfriend was not too concerned with what you were doing throughout the dream. He was just a bystander, almost oblivious to the fight you were having with his ex girlfriend.    When you saw your boyfriend laying on the ground with his ex girlfriend this may symbolize the fact that you believe he still is attracted to her or secretly yearns for her to be with him.     Your anger which lead to beat up the girl was your brains way of coping with that negative emotion.     However, as I said, the fact that your boyfriend didn't seem to care what was going on may be a sign that he doesn't in fact care what happens between you two (He and yourself) in real life as well.    Perhaps you should really look at your relationship with him and decipher whether or not it is worth sticking with.     Hopefully this helps. Cheers

SdKYHk6zaa	why are you angry?  there is no pressure to to be the 'life of the party' or whatever, do what makes you happy. Your success is not measured by how others perceive you, but how you perceive yourself. Friends are nice, don't close your self, be more approachable or approach others. I don't why you are angry and why you want to lash at others, come to understand suffering and forgive yourself for perceived shortcomings. imperfection is beauty.|`|ojEkgJoqaa	first of all keep up with the martial arts class  you have made friends there and you are handling your anger in an appropiate way.    maybe you could hook up with some of the friends at that class.it will keep you busy and you have friends there    as far as school just stick it out as much as you can. maybe talk to a guidance counselor for some advice on how to handle it.     that is my suggestion i hope it helps somewhat.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Hey you're into your studies & Martial arts Great!! so stay with them just think when you're a CEO & all those so called friends need a job who are they going to ask? you that's who so just hang in there OK all your hard work will pay off for you believe me  I also took Judo with my bro & I found out this helps alot with self esteem  Good luck to you|`|bjmDAjnpaa	explore different styles of music. i get angry alot too so i like to relax to my ipod oor just listen to music on the computer
ojEkgJoqaa	maybe talking to a therapist about this  sounds like you need help with your self esteem. but hurting yourself is not going to solve anything. it is only temporary and you will feel worse after it    and killing yourself is not the way either. i would seriously try to talk to a therapist to discuss these problems and just have someone there for support and you can talk to.|`|RWEyZZXWaa	Welcome to puberty.  Spend less time on the computer and more time with other people.     I would advise though that it's mostly hormones.  However thoughts of self-destruction while not uncommon, if they are obsessive you better go to talk a counselor; teacher or maybe even a parent.|`|BVyZfC04aa	Okay, first off, you didn't "becoming unnatractive overnight". Your perception of yourself changed because you hit puberty. Puberty is a tough time and your body undergoes changes obviously, but the hormones mess up your emotions and its extremely common for it to result in a lack of self-esteem like this. You need to try and build your self-esteem and confidence by forcing yourself to socialise and make friends. I used to be painfully shy and have a lack of self-esteem and self-worth like yourself, but you need to get out there and find friends who'll make you feel better about yourself.    I'll also tell you this. People see you how you see yourself. If you think you're great, that exudes from you, and others will think you're great too. If you don't, people will see you as an easy target, and will think the same. It comes with growing up.|`|9w9Q83tFaa	You are sixteen and your hormones are all over the place, you are not ugly you are changing into a man and ,the trick is that eventually you have to act like one and real men don't commit suicide which is an easy way out, you might have become Schizotypal which is learned behaviour caused by shutting yourself away from people,   When you are with your friends the next time face them with a smile and see the difference it makes, if you exclude yourself from friends they will naturally make fun of you and talk about you because they will know that you are somehow different from them and therefore they will be suspicious of you, get in there and be yourself, live life you have a right to be here and to enjoy yourself, go for it.|`|h479qjNoaa	You are becoming a real woman.   Beauty is no everything in the world. Focus on a lot more that is going on in your life, on your studies, and you will love your intellect and much more in yourself.|`|VUqlQmJcaa	Truthfully, you're 16 what knowledge do you think you have? THINK, don't use hormones or other peoples attitudes and emotions to control or judge what you think of yourself. The new attitude of therapy and drugs putting you into a comatose state so that you can deal with life I don't believe is the way out. Granted this is all only my opinion and hiding it isn't healthy either. Sounds to me like you need to find things in your life that YOU enjoy that make you feel good about yourself and focus on those instead of sitting on a yahoo forum and asking complete strangers for sympathy and ways to kill yourself.|`|NNii9kKBaa	I'm really not good at this stuff, but i had to answer you :(  the way you look has nothing to do with the way you live your life.  You're 16, you have the rest of your life ahead of you, and you can do AMAZING things, don't keep your head down, ever heard that real beauty lies inside? That's true, and you will meet nicer, better people as you grow up, i know there are some arseholes about!  Of course you're normal, every teenage girl hates the way they look!!  I'm 15 and girls at my school that are really pretty say theyre ugly, and are concious of the way they look ALL the time.  You're not ugly, you're normal, like every other person on earth!  And you can't live life just feeling down, you have to get out there and have the time of your ******* life!  I hope this helps :D
KX5ALUzWaa	That's totally normal, I'm exactly the same. I remember when I first started college, I had to move away from all my close friends and start fresh. At first it was really difficult and I was shy and extremely nervous, but confidence always builds over time and now I have an awesome group of friends that I can just chill out and be myself with.  Try chatting to people you don't normally chat to  Learn to be a little bit more independent, go places on your own and meet people...an after school club for example :)  Just believe in yourself and you'll be fine, your confidence will build in no time :)  x|`|B79lX9Inaa	I am going to give you a clue.      YOU!|`|1Y1CTj9aaa	I'm the same. You just need to open up. Don't be afraid.
XPnIjCoEaa	This really does seem like a serious problem, since therapists have not been able to help. I think you should seek psychological assistance.    But many of our problems, we can solve ourselves without even knowing it. First, observe yourself and see how many times and how often you "spazz" in a day. Then make a goal to worry about one less thing a day. Try to make time for yourself to relax and just be with yourself. Listen to some calming music, take a bath, talk to a good friend, eat something you love, go shopping, whatever makes you happy. I think if you forget about the world for just 10 mins a day, you'll feel like a better person. Try to think positively and when you catchy yourself worrying, divert your attention and believe that it will all be over.

Those are the keys to survival, not how attractive one may appear to be or lack there of.  =P|`|cWxwHMQWaa	Sounds pretty dreamy haha =o)|`|Kz3qsxWVaa	Well pecs and broad shoulders don't really mean much to me, and I like arms toned, not grossly large.

vzQBmR4Paa	mayb hes gud in bed?|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Insecurity.    Or an absent Father.    Or her single mother telling her to think of mom as dad.    Older guys usually tend to be more mature/richer/considerate and know more tricks in bed. What more does a whiny teen need ?|`|PKhIXkJAaa	I'm sure that in some cases the reasons you gave are correct. However I mostly think it's just a "type" thing.  Most of us have a type that we find attractive, blonde, dark hair, tall, thin, muscular, blue eyes, brown eyes, younger, same age or older... sooo many variables.      Age is just another variable for many women, including myself.  I was always more attracted to much older men, yet I wasn't attracted to men my age or younger men. In some ways I think I have had an Alpha Male complex, nothing to do with money, more to do  with being attracted to confidence and experience. An appealing man with presence, grey hair and a resonant voice can hypnotize me (I look but never touch !). The funny thing is that I ended up marrying a man a couple of years younger than I am, I married outside my "type".    As you see, I can only answer for myself, and I am sure that the actual reasons behind it are as varied as the people concerned.|`|dGwa8sFPaa	$$$|`|A71Uu05Uaa	Money and/or daddy issues.    Maturity is the oldest lie in the book when it comes to this.  There are plenty of mature 20 year old guys and plenty of immature 40 year old guys.      Just as big of a lie as when a 35 year old guy says the reason he's dating an 18 year old is because she's mature or smart.  We all know it's because she's a young hot chick.|`|iHKJsyfTaa	Money, status, maturity, better sexual skills.    And maybe she has "Daddy issues",those chicks often like older guys.

Another reason might be "flattered", especially for girls in their teens...when you're a 16 year old girl, a 26+ year old guy hitting on you is flattering, makes you feel mature and more adult, I suppose.  That was what happened with my relationship with an older guy when I was 14...damn glad I grew out of that though!    Edit: Nataly is right too...maybe she just happens to like the individual guy and doesn't care about his age.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	It could be true love... but it could be she enjoy's his money.|`|rjVALevtaa	I married my husband when I was 19 and he was 32. I was not desperate nor am I a golddigger. He has never made me feel insecure. I like the fact that he is older and wiser than myself.     I had my first child at age 16 and I quit high school at age 17 (although later obtained my GED) so I really couldn't relate to kids my age since I was not going through the same things. Also, most of the boys in my age range did not want to date me because they didn't want to deal with my son.     My husband has always been very supportive of me. He has helped me with many things, including understanding myself. I have never once thought of our age difference as being a bad thing.    But your friend's case is a bit different considering that if they are sexually active, he is committing statutory rape.    EDIT: I think it's unfair for most of the people here to assume that it's all about money. I'm sure that's a fairly common reason but I know for myself, it was not. My husband is a construction worker so as you can imagine we don't have a lot of money. It's called being in love.    EDIT: Why does telling the truth give me 3 thumbs down?    EDIT: If you are under the age of 18 and you're having sex with someone over the age of 18 (the difference usually needs to be above 6 years for it to be a felony), it is statutory rape. Period. Although 16 is technically the age of consent in many states, this does not apply with a great age difference.

My work-study is in Student Activities this year and he comes in every couple of weeks to do programs for the school. He's funny and tells cool stories. He's also an alum and tells us stories about when he went to school here. He's cute, but not hot, and I know he's not rich. He's married, so I know nothing would ever happen, but he's flirty and uses a lot of double entendre. I don't fantasize about the guy, but if he was single and asked me out I'd go out with him.     I personally don't want a BF right now. My old roommate is ALWAYS looking for her future husband. I'm pretty sure if she would find that guy tomorrow she'd quit school and start popping out babies. Some women want that. That's fine, but not for me.
1djOVJ0daa	In the last few years the growth of the economy was based on lie. In my opinion to correct that: every prices of services/goods should be reduced by percentage amount that the economy is down.    If we are trying to hold on the value it used to be during the fake growth, then this recession will continue and even will lead us to depression.     Countries, companies, individuals must understand that and let the economy correct it self without loosing jobs but with less price for everything.|`|NsFaPI9waa	Who knows?    Some are saying that this depression could plunge us further than the 1920's Great Depression and some say this will be resolved in little under a year.    The bottom line is we can't be sure but people are doing everything to try and prevent it from becoming worse.    It depends on whether your optimistic or pessemistic. I am realistic and I think we will see worse before we see better|`|H55nCLqPaa	I think it will turn into a depression if not already. The fact is that the one thing that the government could do to fix the situation is the one thing it absolutely will not do; shrink. How bad this turns out to be will largely depend on how much more government bungling we can expect, and I have a feeling it's going to be a fair amount. Have no illusions, this could well turn out to be worse than the Great Depression, as things are going the best we can hope for is to ride out of it on the back of another inflationary credit boom and put the whole mess off for another 10 years.    The only alternative would be as another poster mentioned; issue a new, sound, currency.

As a result, the state is issuing IOUs to taxpayers expecting a refund, all construction projects (like roads, bridges, repairs) have been suspended, state workers are being furlowed and have taken pay cuts and services are being cut.

But umm I have no idea really....there's no way that that's coincidence because first of all I don't believe in that..and second, because it was the same girl who you've never met before! Just last night I had a dream about a guy I've never met before and we were hanging out in the dream and everything too..and a couple years ago I had another dream about the same guy...I think that would be crazy if I actually met him like you met your dream girl!

Sorry that I don't know exactly what it means though :/|`|7hAiw408aa	Very strange indeed.    If this is all true as you say, I will take your word for it and give you an honest answer.    If I had a dream like that, involving a woman who told me to find her and then I subsequently saw that exact woman in person, I think I would try and talk to the girl.    Perhaps you are as they say, "soul mates" or something of that nature.    Who knows, perhaps she even had the same dream with you in the same spot, telling her to find yourself.    But you will never know what could become of this oddly enticing situation unless you go after it and try to see for yourself, what in fact the meaning of the dream was.

The common perception of what hypnosis is isn't accurate.  There is nothing mystic or mysterious about it.  It doesn't mean someone controling your will.    Hypnosis is a relaxed, uncontrolled state of mind.  It's deep daydreaming.|`|4WXK187vaa	Shannon,    When a person is daydreaming they are in an 'Alfa' state. It is not the ideal time for a suggestion to be planted in the subconscious mind. Aside from the science of the technique, you need to ask the person in question for their permission use Hypnosis on them.    Remember that humans were born with free will...when you go against that, you create Karma. Another thing is that the person in question can block your request...because nobody can do or say anything that goes against their nature.

c7b7aspZaa	I'd also add that paranoia is fear-based.  A paranoid feeling comes forth when one is scared of a possible outcome, so the mind makes up the most ludicrous option to keep one from participating.

Intuition gives you good feelings but hope also does this same thing.      The only way to know is to trust your feelings.  The good or bad part are just reflections of who you are.   You must have a stress free and guilt free life to come anywhere close to being able to trust your own feelings.  You must be balanced financially, emotionally and physically in order to create a benchmark to know your feelings.

1djOVJ0daa	Let's start from inflation definition:  In economics, inflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.    Higher employment is an increase of labor demand. As labor demand increases, then employees will have a lot of opportunities that will result in companies to increase wages. As companies increase wages they also increase the prices of services or goods they offer to the consumer. This means that the increase in employment results in increase in prices of goods and services (including wages), which is higher inflation.|`|zpXTgUpiaa	basically, the less money a company has, the less people it can hire to do work, meaning that less people will buy from other company's because they lost their jobs, meaning that the company needs to rise the price of its stuff so that the company's stuff actually makes a profit, but that cause people to have less of an ability to buy their products, making the company have to let go of more people, etc..|`|54aa7dbfd2cf8b220db82322e5228d56aa	the higher level of employment means that people have more money to spend and demand increases.  when demand increases production also has to increase which in turn increases pay rate, amount of overtime, bonuses, etc...  this in turn increases inflation.     the economy is basically inflating like a balloon, everything gets bigger; payroll, prices, bonuses and production costs (more factories, more shifts, increased volume on shifts).  all this is another name for inflation; a rise in consumer prices.

AA10988215	It may be that as yet no theory has been proven that matches your ideas but that doesn't mean you can't challenge previous research.    Any study which concludes human theories based on animal research is open to criticism and so yes, you could quite easily challenge their conclusions and indeed in a psychological essay you are expected to do this.  Also, theories such as the 'sexy son hypothesis' are now very dated, having been developed in the late 70's.  ALL psychological theories are influenced by the social norms of the time and so again you can challenge older theories (especially those in social psychology) in saying that they may no longer be culturally relevant.    A previous lecturer of mine is doing his PhD on what women find attractive in men.  He has used only human participants and has looked at aspects such as facial features, body ratios and voice pitch using computerised images and sounds.  Although his research was incomplete when he taught me, his findings to date were all (very significantly) in support of women finding masculine physical characteristics more attractive (such as the wide shoulder to narrow waist ratio and deep voice).  However, he had not at the time begun looking at more complex aspects such as personality or attitudes to child rearing etc so I can only tell you what he found about the superficial aspects of attraction, which doesn't support your androgyny theory unfortunately.    I have no doubt that some aspects of your own suggestion will be accurate to some people.  But it may that the majority of female populations (e.g. as little as 51%) have a preference for masculinity.  As you will know a study does not have to have a 100% effect rate to be deemed significant and to support a hypothesis.  Indeed many studies are deemed significant when they are just below the threshold of a 0.05 p value.  However, if you can find methodological flaws, especially those relating to ecological validity/generalisation, then again you can produce a good argument against the conclusion.    Personally, my advice would be this.  You will know that in Psychology, you cannot challenge a theory based on your own opinion as such (e.g. "I know people who like androgynes men and so masculinity is not important" etc....) but you can challenge their methods and the conclusions they make from their findings.  This way you can conclude an essay by stating that further research needs to be developed to improve our knowledge of the areas that other theories either fail to approach appropriately or simply are no longer culturally relevant to describe.  Then, if you get the opportunity to develop your own research you can use your reasoning about previous studies to develop your own study to see if masculinity still dominates over androgyny.    I know how frustrating it can be when a theory just seems 'wrong' but it's always worth looking at the actual stats of experimental studies and seeing just how strong an effect was.  Poking holes in other peoples studies makes for interesting research studies of your own!    Good luck with it all!|`|7i6qj4OXaa	Add this to the theory pot.  Astrology.  I know it works.  I am not a nutter and have an M.Ed in Human Relations but I have studied astrology and know that it plays some part in human attraction.  The comparison of two natal charts of people in a relationship is called synastry.    There is also a lot in the pheremones theory.  I have been in love twice, as opposed to sexually attracted and they both smelled so familiar to me that I knew we belonged.|`|FBR7cMshaa	hey there,  it is quite a dilemma you're facing,although you firmly make a great point there seems to be no 'conclusive research' on your theory.  im sure you've heard of 'the descent of man and selection in relation to sex' by charles darwin as this is the basic premise of the theory of sexual selection.  maybe you should look up some of the work of richard alexander and the 'machiavelian hypothesis' or the work done by matt ridley on the subject.  i know that probably isn't much help to you on the matter.  i do totally understand your theory and it is widely know among the younger generation that the more well-groomed,sensitive and adoring male{metro-sexual} is widely sought by the opposite sex but until there is an offical study and analysis on the subject,it stays just a theory!   i'd advise you to get in touch with a lecturer and have a chat with them on the subject,express your view logically with examples {beckham,metro-sexual and three kids} im sure they'd be delighted to discuss your point of view.many people forget lecturers become bored with monotonous lectures and it'll show you're intereted.if no-one questioned anything i wonder where we'd be!!|`|kqXQA2ILaa	get PhD.|`|AJeaWX8Paa	Your theory is interesting.    I would encourage you to look a little deeper into the attraction literature.  Specifically, it seems like the crux of your argument is based on the distinction between masculinity and femininity.  However, you're right in saying that there are a lot of other things that contribute to human attraction.  Look into social psychological theories of attraction for a possible answer.     With respect to evolutionary psychology, the argument is that women prefer men who can provide for them (these days that usually means they have connections or money).  Men prefer women who can provide a lot of offspring.  This theory disagrees with what you are saying, though, because biologically, there is a certain body type that is optimal for reproducing.  In males, it is bigger, stronger, faster, i.e., more masculine (this is so that they can hunt and provide shelter for offspring).  In females it is a certain hip/waist ratio that is is optimum for bearing children.  Evolutionary psychology is mostly just theory, though, since you can't disprove any of it.  It's something you should look into and be aware of though, as it pertains to your argument.
q5lreoiWaa	I can speak to this from a knowledge base not many have, for I am legally blind, and will eventually be totally blind.  I also taught a headstart program for children who were born blind or visuallyimpaired aimed at starting them in school at the same point as sighted children.  I taught a boy who was born without eyes.  He did not have black but rather a sense that you might call like fireworks as his brain tried to transmit random messages and emotions, no "hardware, but "software".  Sort of like dreams where your brain is still firing.  I have less than 3 percent vision and I often have sensations like you would have when you try to follow objects as you ride on a midway, streaks of color and light.

aSvSicbbaa	I would love to be idealistic and say "sure, this country has come a long way in it's race relations", but based on what I see and from what I hear locally it is still the same if not getting worse.  I am really starting to get discouraged about the whole idea of it getting better.  I think that the majority of the people in this country claim to be educated, fair, patient and tolerant but that is so far from the truth.  The majority of white american would claim that is getting better but they don't experience the unfairness, the hatred, and the judgmental nature that black americans see on a daily basis.  The thought of racism is such a primitive thought that one would think that in today's society it wouldn't even be discussed.  If you were to ask someone who continues to believe in the concept of racism "why" they are racist, they wouldn't even have a good concrete answer for you.  It has been learned by everyone in the world that this concept is stupid, silly and just plain wrong.  How can you say that I am different from you just because I have different pigmentation.  Come on now!!!!  I also have a huge problem with religion is this country when you say you believe in a higher power but you continue to perpetuate hatered and judgement.  I do however know that the reason people buy into racism is based on a "fear" that is unresolved in white america.  Let me be the first black man tell you.  We don't want anything that you have and we don't want to hurt anyone.  We just want a fair chance to have the same earning power, educational oppurtunties, and basic rights as everyone one else.  I personally believe that if you choose to be racist, that's you.  Just don't bring anyone else into your ignorant form of thinking like telling people how racist your are.  You carry that hatred in your heart,   I just can't see the positive in it.  I'm sorry.  It's not that hard to stop hating people because of their skin color.  People just don't want to change.

I don't know what jobs these people will transfer their skills into now.

You can't blame the people who moved here for they were looking for a better life which is reasonable.

Kil7sZUSaa	This is an example of selective evidence.  If you don't put equal weight between evidence arrived at by systematic search and evidence based on first-hand stories, you are committing the fallacy of selective evidence.  If you overemphasize one over the other, it could lead to a mistrial or you could unduly influence the jury.   It would all depend on the instructions of the judge on what the jury should or should disregard.    In our everyday life, this is an instance of selective evidence.    "Yeah, I've read the health warnings on those cigarette packs and I know about all that health research, but lots of my friends smoke, and they are all okay, so I know smoking can't really hurt you."
R1prwIuXaa	I seem to have a similar issue.  They are testing you to see your response.  You must be putting it(some kind of trigger to make them want to test you) out there, to have them say or do something.  It is hard to identify exactly what it is because we don't know your personality.  <br>  <br>  But one thing you can do is respond with negative reinforcement.  That means DO NOT walk away, or call them on it, just slow things down a bit so you collect something good to say in your head and respond (only a few secs.....so you dont just blurt something harsh out).  Say something that will rub off negatively but not harsh.  Then that way if you continue to respond in a way that is not positive, they will stop testing you.  Hope this helps.|`|oOVAbKPmaa	Maybe it's because, for one reason or another, some people underestimate your assertiveness at first.

iMMcvPyyaa	Generally speaking most people will feel responsible for the anger of another if you manage to catch them off-guard.  A quick burst of unreasonable vitriol will push most people into an acquiescent posture simply because they presume that it must have a real and proper origin.  But when you get beyond instances of emotional "shock and awe," people's reactions to criticism and attacks are far more telling about them than they are illuminating of some overarching principle.    A fundamentally insecure person will always feel responsible because they give their own perspectives less weight than the perspectives of others.  Although they might feel that they have done nothing wrong, they allow the perspectives of others to override that - they MUST have done something wrong if someone else is angry.  Continuing along that path, it's now their obligation to apologize for their obvious failure in the situation.  In allowing the outlooks of others to dominate his/her own, this form of insecure person allows the constant weathering of human interaction to erode their own thoughts and values.    As for a person being "left standing there given the responsibility to mend things," that's an instance of a less personal form of insecurity that manifests as a fear of conflict or of "rocking the boat."  Instead of believing that the incident is caused by a personal fault, the problem now is the existence of a rift.  To allow a social break to happen, even if it is caused by someone else, is what this insecurity labels as sin.  Sometimes it can be worthwhile to work to heal wounds, but there's always a matter of judgment, and someone motivated by this insecurity will find themselves metaphorically torn to pieces as they desperately struggle to hold their relationships together against the tides.    Accepting suffering and showing compassion are not one and the same.  Allowing someone to lash out and hurt you is, in most cases, simply enabling them.  Choosing to forgive someone who has hurt you in the past is compassionate.  But remember to temper forgiveness with truth - actions that have been forgiven were still wrong, and would still be wrong if repeated.  There's a very thin line between sainthood and martyrdom.|`|HoYvAueuaa	All these answers are very good and pretty much explain it. It comes down to esteem issues and wanting to avoid conflict. Everyone has their wants and needs. I just had to realize that she didn't want the same things I did. Even though it's hard to walk away, it has to be done.|`|WvfTOjRFaa	maybe because we feel that we are in a way responsible for his anger, and so it is better to ask forgiveness for the wrong we have done that way we can also forget and forgive and continue to move on. well, that is just me.|`|6GmtcZteaa	We are afraid that the problem well grow bigger, so we act resposibly by ending it.  We love those people and we feel they do not know it, so we just walk along and take them for who they are.  We have big open hearts and do not want the relationship with that person to break.  We might feel that that person is probably pissed at something you did a longer time before, so when we aplogize we are really apologizing at that previous mistake, we are doing it to make ourselves feel better.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	Because we simply hate confrontations and we don't want to be "angry all day long for a damn stupid thing". I am sure, if the matter can not be resolved at times, it is because of some "major issue" or we simply have way too much pride on our shoulders. Life is too short, who wants to be angry all day long? I also have said many times "sure, you're right" when the other person wasn't right at all !  Does this show compassion necessarily? No, it doesn't. It means that we have lived our life with some very big problems in the past, and we know exactly how much worse it can be !!|`|zZY3JX30aa	"We?"    I am not responsible for another persons choice to get angry or inability to control their emotions.    I feel no obligation to repair or "mend things. The problem is clearly theirs, and I have enough of my own without adding their issues to mine.    to apologize for something you are not responsible for would show weakness, not compassion.|`|AhRRhe1Yaa	I tend to do that and I have been told that it is low self esteem and wanting everyone to like me. I believe that that is true.|`|AA11879518	Because "We" are addicted to feelings of guilt.    and HE is addicted to feelings of Anger, Victimization, etc.|`|6fPfKfLVaa	We apologize because we want things to be better, we want things resolved, and we want to move on.  Its not compassion, its more of a need to avoid conflict.  But take my advice, IT SOLVES NOTHING.  You are not responsible for someone else's anger, that person is.  And everytime you apologize, they learn that they can take advantage.  An example, my husband of 3 years has been verbally abusing me.  I used to think that he did it because he was upset about work or whatever. To patch things up, I would apologize.  I knew he was wrong but I just didn't want to fight with him anymore.  Now he has learned to take advantage of that & calls me names whenever he feels like it.  And you know what his excuse is now: "you hurt me".  I'm done apologizing to him for his shortfalls.  And you should not apologize for another's shortfalls either.  Whether they are angry, or whatever lame excuse, there is no reason for you to apologize and clean up that person's mess.  I had to learn that the hard way.  You shouldn't.|`|BC5AzEbAaa	i do that if the person running away is someone special to me. i know i can't afford to lose them that's why and i know that's a bigger problem than the other.|`|lhqqDCrAaa	Probably because we're afraid.  and embarrased. And we don't want to keep on feeling that way so we just apologize.|`|5TjJQq5Kaa	It tends to be as the person feels.    1. could mean sorry for what i did to anger you    2. could mean sorry that you feel the way you do    3. sorry that your not getting the response your expecting    4. desperate attempt to end the conflict    5. sorry that it didnt work out between us
af533b17ca68713705564cacfb86ba98aa	And loud people are winners? Honestly...these humans are all the same.|`|AA10510845	Explain to your family that you are an introvert.  There is nothing wrong with that.  It simply means that your thoughts are turned inward, and some of the most famous philosophers, those very wise people whose reputations have followed them for centuries, were also introverts.  Weak minds? Losers?  That's ridiculous!  Your mind is stronger, because you use it more.  Extraverts are outgoing, partying-type people, but introverts are among the deep thinkers of the world, the problem solvers and the intellectuals.  Your family should be proud of you, and not make those disparaging comments. Pay them no mind.  Good luck and God bless!|`|V9ddU84Iaa	Whether or not you choose to be loud, and whether or not you are shy has nothing to do with a "weak" or "strong" mindset. While being shy and quiet is usually associated with being weak willed, it doesn't mean that this is always the case. It's just a generalization. Personally, I'm usually quiet and shy (especially around people I don't know) but I am, by no means weak minded. People who know me very well know that I'm very opinionated and very able to express what I think about things. Let them know that not everyone has to act loud and obnoxious, that it's not something you feel you need to do. You are who you are. I think that some people think like that because of how they grew up. They may have grown up in a very loud, argumentative family and everyone they knew who was quiet had a weak mindset and, to them, were losers.  My family thought a lot of very stupid things about me, and I think I did a good job of proving them wrong, and I didn't change a thing about me in the process. I don't know if telling them that it's annoying will change anything because some people will do it more because they know it annoys you. However, I find that a good retort to what they say shuts them up pretty well.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|4p1m2Saeaa	Can't change what people think.  just prove that you aren't.|`|SaPkXOCaaa	I am an extremely quiet, introverted person. Not only do I get the "weak" card played on me, but people often mistake me for being snobbish as well. <br>  (My mother tells me that if I were to smile more, people might not jump to that conclusion as much.)<br>  A lot of the time, I just don't have anything to say. I like to observe, to listen. <br>  Somehow it has gotten to be a common belief that charisma equals a bright, intelligent mind. I feel like these people have to put on a show for an audience a lot of the time...and if you are not comfortable with yourself, how can you stay inside your own head for extended periods of time? <br>  Quiet people have some of the strongest resolve I have encountered among people. We know our minds, we know ourselves to an extent that we are pretty good at knowing what we stand for.|`|KJmuHxcCaa	NO, not true at all if u are shy usally means your very smart and has nothing to do with being a loser trust me|`|QvSwo3X9aa	Society values gregarious people more because their personalities make OTHER PEOPLE happy. Your family probably thinks there is something "wrong" with you because you don't fit their idea of "right".<br>  <br>  "To thine own self be true"|`|fF1WbPltaa	I think the old adage that 'Still waters run deep' can be very true.
AA10343094	alot of people experience this after their loved ones die. i can't remember what it's called though. i really do believe that through dreams people can communicate to their loved ones, to bring closure to the situation.    it's happened to me. when my bushie (sp?) died, we were driving through the city, and all the sudden, the doors started to lock. the vehicle had automatic locks, but no one was touching them. every time we drove through the city, she would always tell us to lock the doors! we really believe it was her.    in the sources, i'm going to give you some links to some forums where people have had similar experiences to yours (and mine). you're not alone, and consider it a blessing. my best freind's landlord's son just got electrocuted at work, i wish you two could meet, because you would probably be a great source of comfort to one another. it's a terrible situation, and i'm so sorry he had to leave a loving family behind.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	No. That's you missing your dad and your subconscious is manifesting itself.|`|CnLIJSUNaa	I honestly don't believe that people can communicate to you if they are dead....I think that because this was a recent tragedy and your probably thinking about and hearing a lot about it all day long, that is why you are dreaming about it. Most people do dream about things that are constantly on their minds, its naturally.|`|7hAiw408aa	Firstly, I am sorry for your loss and I hope you will find peace with this issue which has presented itself to you.    Do you harbor any resentful feelings towards your father for the cause of his death? If you have even the slightest feeling of anger this can be causing your dreams.     The fact that he is constantly letting it be known that he is sorry for not being responsible or being more careful at work may in fact be your own consciousness dealing with the fact you wished he would have been more careful during his accident.    Most importantly you must realize, as you stated in your dream, that your father loved you very much and that his death was, an accident. A tragic one nonetheless...    Try and acknowledge that even though this incident has left your family as you say, completely devastated, that your father would never have wished this against any of you. Hopefully this was of some help to you, and I am very sorry for what you must be going through.    Stay strong and remember the great things and the fond memories you and you father shared. I'm sure he would rather see a smile than a frown.    Best of luck to you and your family    My regards
EtLVwQOeaa	I'm kinda young but did go through this too... I found that calling him atleast everyother day worked well to keep the connection. I have to ask you, what was the fight about exactly, and why didn't you call him when he was not calling you? is he really into you? Do you really like him? okay so heres the deal I want you to go tell him everything, (guys would rather be insulted than ignored, even though I wouldn't intentionally insult him.)Then sit and listen to his side, but don't pester for information. you need to try to work it out this is NOT going to solve itself.|`|7fa0FWu2aa	WATCH THIS VIDEO AND ASK HIM INTO YOUR HEART: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2bpc7LSRZc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2bpc7LSR...</a>
JNQezEGqaa	From working in the mental health field for 15 years....  I personally do not feel that a person with this disorder is capable of loving anyone...  There is too much disassociation from the feelings and needs of others.,....  Now, there is a possibility that with counseling and intense therapy that person maybe able to care for their child, but not with the intense love and devotion of someone who does not suffer from this disorder.  And   That mother would need an extremely strong support base to remain a supportive mother....though I would hope there was someone else there to give the children the emotional support they will need....  Peace.|`|WNhQzmo3aa	Very good question....  I would say they are incapable for the simple fact that the disorder is based on deceit and manipulation....I maybe wrong because I am not a doctor or patient but that is my view...|`|aLwrpMPXaa	I would like to understand right now, how these two can be related and why you assume, it is could not be possible.....    Edit: I just googled it but first of all, the symptoms are very similar of those of Post Partum Depression (which I have proudly endured and survived) and yet I have never failed to assist or even love my own child. That's why I'm so confused right now. I remember, at the time, taking also medication for it.    People with antisocial personality disorder tend to have few symptoms. Rather, they cause discomfort or distress to others through socially unacceptable behavior and by being:  Deceitful  Impulsive  Aggressive or irritable  Reckless  Irresponsible  Remorseless    Edit: I expanded my research and you and the other answerers are right. These are two different problems. There is no way, a woman with the symptoms can love her own child! Sorry for the mix up and thank you.

U69Q6rsWaa	By the sounds of it, I think it would be difficult to say too much about what the brain is doing. What were the pictures you used  (Rorschach inkblots, 'magic eye' pictures, something else?)?<br>  <br>  With the stroop effect, you infer that people have a hard time ignoring the processing of verbal information, with motion illusions (e.g. involving a series of 2-4 still images, which when alternated look like perpetual motion) you can make claims on the mechanisms that detect motion in the visual system. <br>  <br>  In what you're saying, you're looking at whether or not they can identify an image from/within the same source, so their brain would likely be processing many of the same things whether they saw it or not (eg. the same colours, the same lines etc.)<br>  <br>  You could look at some of the stuff on cognitive style, which refers to individual differences in how the brain processes information . It looks at distinctions between wholist (those looking at the 'big picture) and analytical (those who break it down into component parts) processing for example. You might also be able to look at the stuff on attention (e.g. if those who do see it look at different parts of the image than those who don't, though it would depend on you asking them if you weren't tracking their eye movements or some such).
CTYZDGeQaa	hi there again delera. thanks for the little message on your last question-appreciated. i believe that if you are with people who you feel comfortable around you should be yourself as you shouldnt care what other people think. but i also think that, like there are two sides to every story, there are two sides to every person. not being your true self is almost lying to youself. but i do know what you mean. i am not always who i truely am, for fear of my freinds, peers or people who look up to me, not accepting me if they knew the true me. i have always been known as the ahppy girl, who find school really easy and has a load of friends. i always smile and love who i am. about a month ago i was diagnosed with depression and have to go to counselling and talk to people who i can really trust, but still, i am still the happy girl every loves and knows at school. i do this because i am fearful that people and my friends wont accept me for who i am becuase they will know that i am not as what i pportray.    i have good friends who will stick by me no matter what and those are the few people who know my full story. as for the others, well, i am still the happy girl at school.    one last thing. your last little comment.question. are you really who you are in the eyes of others? i think that without opening your mouth or saying anything people will automatically judge you and will see you differently to who you truely are anyway. they will pick out the bits they like and want to believe and ignore the rest they dont want to see. so in a way you are seen differently in the eyes of other people without even being  a different you.    hope that answered your question.    ^_^|`|42SipZEPaa	I'm not who I am in other people's eyes, well not most people. I'm rather quiet and people think I'm a b*tch because of it, but I'm really not. When I do talk to people I'm really excited and happy and interested in what they say generally. But most people see me as cold and unemotional because I don't smile or laugh a lot....but I am a really happy person, just wasn't raised to show much emotion and I'm shy around people.|`|Co3LvzBoaa	most people lie on the internet so u can say most people r not who they say they r but if u meet the right person sure they will like u if they know hu u r|`|1aCiHd96aa	they know who I am, that's why they always know what to expect from me|`|QDa2fKIjaa	HELLO NO!  - I even have to lie about my age too! and I'm a guy.|`|F8m1VaoYaa	honestly no.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	Most of us have `two selves`.

0d2f0d1dc0ce34a02a90647e43e5524caa	The key to discipline is consistency and firmness. Nicole is like that because she is so used with getting her own way. But her parents need to teach her that sometimes we can not always get what we want. Maybe this is also part of her adjustment and she needs to feel that she is not left out and neglected but this does not mean that she should be given what she wants all the time. When a child feels insecure, he/she will do whatever it takes to get the attention. Let her feel needed and part of the family. Give her a responsibility that will make her feel important. Spend time with her and make her feel special and loved. Sometimes we spoil our children because we don't have time for them. Loving our kids does not mean spoiling them but giving them proper attention and guidance that is essential for their growth and development.|`|85d25c63c9c8d4e4ad0e4c097927a33faa	I think that it's very important both girls feel love and attention (although not too much) It is very sad that jade had cancer, but Nicole does not have the emotional experience of an adult, and can not appreciate this situation as adults may expect her to. I think to help them you could take each of the girls on seperate occasions and have fun with them. On the spoiling side of things, it's important to teach the girls that while they are loved, they cannot have everything there way. This can be achieved by when they throw tantrums not giving in. However this is really something for the parents to deal with, and you just try and get by as much as possible without adressing that so they can enjoy their time with their aunt. Hope this helps :)|`|AA10200409	I know this situation well. My little sister was 3 when I got Polio at age 5. I was in hospital 6 months and when I got home, all attention and gifts came my way. i know it hurt my sister and she felt left out.   When I was in hospital, my grandparents became her "parents" as my own parents worked on my recovery. As we integrated again as a family, my sister did not have tantrums, but her loneliness was easy to see. At the time I was too young to know how it made her feel, but now I do.    My advice is for you to help by being Nicole's best buddy. Take her places, draw with her, and praise her for what she does well. She needs that a lot now! And in some alone time, help her to understand that to have cancer is very hard too, and that Jade feels lonely too. Maybe together you two can paint something for Jade and give it to her.  You are the perfect person to do this because you can see the family "from the outside" because you analyze well.    It's very good of you to care. You can have the power in this to change Nicole's entire life for the better.    Best wishes for all of you.
85d25c63c9c8d4e4ad0e4c097927a33faa	I think that maybe he wanted something more from the relationship, maybe wanted the game of two women at once. When he didn't get this from you, maybe he simply had no desire to persue a friendship because his intentions were never really pure.

BoqbYQ1Naa	Trevor, please:    Do NOT cook your steak for 10-13 minutes per side unless you're planning to make shoes out of them.    Do NOT let your steaks sit in "course" salt for any length of time.  This will draw out the juices and will not add anything.  Poultry and pork are brined, beef isn't.    Personally I'd pan-fry them because I don't like how they come out under the broiler, and I don't like grilled anything.  Yes, you're right - sear them for a few minutes per side over medium-high to high heat, depending on your stove.  Salt and pepper each side gently just before it hits the pan, and coarse salt is best because it creates a bit of a crust.  Once each side is seared, place the steaks in a hot oven (400 deg F) for just a few minutes, depending on how you like your meat.  You can use the same pan if it's ovenproof.      Important:  Let the steaks sit off the heat for a few minutes when they're cooked.  This allows the muscle fibers to relax and the meat juices to redistribute.  You'll wind up with a nice juicy steak instead of a gray, flabby thing with the juice all over the plate.  Believe me, this is a very important step and makes a huge difference to the success of the dish.    I start the onions early and cook them until I like them, then cook the steak in the same pan.  Adds a nice oniony flavor to the meat.    Mr. Know-It-All is right this time.  Pay attention to him.      Oh, and before you start the cooking, pat the steaks dry, then salt&pepper, then cook.  A meat thermometer will come in handy.  If you don't have one, it's a worthwhile investment.    We had the exact same dinner as you earlier this week, and it was lovely.  I hope you have a nice bottle of wine and someone special to share it with.    ETA:  worcestershire marinade:  1/4 c + 1 tsp. Worcestershire    1/2 ts Instant minced garlic    2 tb Lemon juice or lime juice    2 tb Olive oil    1/4 c Instant minced onion    3/4 ts Salt      Combine 1/4 cup of the Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, oil, minced onion, salt and minced garlic; mix well and set aside. Place steak in tight-fitting bowl or plastic bag. Pour Worcestershire sauce mixture over steak. Marinate 2 hours.    Always toss a marinade; never put it on cooked meat unless you've boiled it first.  For your steak, melt 2 Tbs butter and add the remaining Worcestershire sauce and some chopped parsley.  That will make a nice sauce for your steak.|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	Wait....was femininecorn trying to insult a gay man by saying that he's gay? Well, congratulations, femmie corn, it was bound to happen one day....you actually got this one right! You've finally called a man "gay" who is ACTUALLY gay!    DO NOT marinate your steaks, Trevor! All you need is butter, salt, pepper, and a little dried garlic for the best steak you ever put in your mouth.     Melt the butter in skillet and add onions and dried garlic. Cook until onions are caramelized (about ten minutes), then cook them on high heat, long even to sear the top and bottom. This will give you that great char crust on the top (the butter facilitates this), and cook until desired temp is reached (rare, med. rare. etc) Do you have a meat thermometer? If not, you'll have to cut into steak to make sure its cooked to your liking. Once it's done (and this part is VERY IMPORTANT!) let your steak "rest." Don't cut it, don't touch it. It needs to rest for about 10 min. This allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring you steak is tender and juicy.    ENJOY!|`|9VAnsWYUaa	I couldn't say it better than this :    Sirloin steak is a cut of beef that's easy to overcook; after that point, it's tough and unappetizing. The trick to a good sirloin steak is to cook it no more than medium, or slightly pink in the center. Use your finger or a sharp fork to see if it's cooked enough.    Step 1  Season your sirloin steak before you cook it to enhance its flavor and tenderness. Use a steak rub, a marinade or salt and pepper on both sides of your steak.    Step 2  Pan fry your sirloin steak by heating a skillet on high heat. Drop your sirloin steak in the center of the pan and let it cook for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, turning it only once. The length of time depends upon how thick the steak is cut and how well you want the steak done.    Step 3  Broil your sirloin steak using the broil setting on your stove. Place it on the rack to directly below the broiler. Broil your steak several minutes on one side before you turn it over, turning only once.    Step 4  Grill your steak over hot coals for about 3 minutes on each side. For grill marks, rotate the steak a quarter-turn after a 1 1/2 minutes on one side, then flip it over and repeat on the other side.    Step 5  Use a sharp fork to poke gently into the center of the sirloin steak. For a medium steak, the juices should run slightly pink and the meat should be tender and easy to penetrate.    Step 6  Push on the center of the steak with your finger. When the steak is done, the meat should be easy to push in and should spring back quickly once you remove your finger.    Yes you should.    BlueChristian's theory of Osmosis is correct.|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Go online and find a recipe.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Here's what you do. Put the steak in a glass dish on the counter and cover it in course kosher salt (sea salt works too, as long as it's course) on both sides. You need to use a good teaspoon or so per side, depending on the size of the steak. If you want seasonings, put them on before you put the salt on. I suggest a bit of liquid mesquite smoke. Anyways, let it sit in the salt for 30 to 45 minutes before you start cooking it. Then rinse it thoroughly and pat it dry. Voila! It's ready to cook. To pan fry it, you will need a bit of olive oil. Sear it on both sides for about a minute, and then lower the heat and cook it for a few minutes per side. Oooh, and if you dice up some mushrooms and toss them in the pan to cook alongside the steak with a bit of crushed garlic, it's really delicious.    But you *must* prepare it with salt first. It sounds insane but it makes the steak really tender and flavourful.      The salt makes the meat tender. The salt draws the meat juices out. Then the juices dissolve the salt, and the salty (and seasoned, if you use spices) juice is sucked back into the steak through osmosis. Then the salt starts breaking down the protein molecules so that the steak becomes tender. Hardly any of that salt makes it into the meat; just enough to make it tender and yummy. I've tried this myself when I made steaks for hubby and I last year for our anniversary. It tasted like something from a fancy steak house! I barbequed it too.    Whatevs. I got the recipe for this steak from an actual chef, who swears by it. And I've home tested it. It sounds all wrong but it actually does work. I've cooked alot of steak, and the salted one was the best by a long shot.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	The key to thick cuts of steak is to marinate them at least 3 hours before cooking them, and take them out of refrigeration at least 10 minutes before cooking them.  If you don't, the cold meat will seize up as soon as it hits whatever hot surface you're cooking it on.    Also, let the meat rest for about 5 minutes before cutting it so it can retain its moisture.      I like my steaks well-done so what I do is marinate them with seasoning, then, in a really hot skillet, I sear both sides of the steak, then finish them off in the oven (tightly wrapped in foil).    For sauce, you can heat some butter in the pan you seared the steaks in, cook some onions (or shallots) and add some steak sauce or mushrooms to it.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	????    Why assume only ladies know how to cook?    Slice the onions, and sautee them in a little oil and butter.    Salt and pepper both sides of the steaks.    Put them in a super-hot pan, then turn the heat down to medium. Flip.    Let the steaks rest for five minutes before eating or cutting them.    I'd leave out other flavorings.    Read the labels for the potatoes and gravy (unless you have real potatoes, and are asking how to make mashed -- dice, peel if you want first; simmer them in water until tender; add salt, pepper, egg, butter, a little milk, and mash them then beat them).    Why didn't you ask this in the Food category?|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Dur, with Montreal steak spice.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	I've never cooked on before but I've heard you're supposed to sear the outside in a pan first and then put it in the oven until it's cooked to your liking.

Cook the steak uncovered for about  10 to 13 minutes If you want it medium rare to medium done turn it occasionally to evenly cook. Some other tips for top steak that I can recommend are: Pat raw steak dry with paper towels to promote browning.To add flavor, season steak with a rub just before cooking, or marinate briefly. Cook over medium heat; high heat chars the outside before the inside is done. Turn with tongs or spatula; piercing causes loss of flavorful juices. Remove excess drippings from skillet as they accumulate during cooking. Good luck with your steak! :)|`|OTT79NAtaa	Asking women how to cook steaks?|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	Well my suggestion   - you want to marinate your steak in some sort  of mix! I suggest oil, taryaki .. but by all means use what you have.. itailin dressing and mountian due taste good too!  don't use salt you don't need it! well maybe fore the mashed potato's!!!     let it sit for a good 20 minutes at the very least overnight is best!     your only suppose to flip it once!  so put it on med heat. once it is hot and up to temp put the steak on!     you will know it's time to flip when there is a pool of blood on the meat!  only when the pool of blood is there flip - this does take a bit to get it down but you have got to start somewhere!  AND i'm not 100% if that's only for an outdoor grill!     once that is done you flip it over!   when you push on the meat with your figure to see if it's done!     take your a hand look at the palm of it!  if you take your index finger and push on the meaty part of your palm (under your thumb) that would be a rare steak... your middle finger pressed in the same spot is Medium rare,, ring fingure is medium, and pinky is well done!     you have to compair that to the steak and you have your desired level of cooking!

Could be something in yoru endoctrine systerm.  They do have prescription anti persperants.  Might even have to see a dermetologist.    I do not know off hand, but anxiety makes our bodies run a little faster and harder than normal.    Again, I would discuss this with your family doc first.|`|9w9Q83tFaa	At sixteen your hormones are in overdrive, the good news is that women find that the natural odour of a man is a big turn on regardless of what the ads may say, what you are giving off are Pheronomes which is a sexual signal to a red blooded woman (if you can find one)  anti-persperents can cause cancer (proven)  don't use them just wash under your arms more frequently until your hormones settle down.

El valor de una formacion que lleva a la sabiduria o una vida con principios no depende de cuanto tienes o de cuanto careces.   Puedes tener un perro o cuatro, pero lo importante es si lo puedes llamar amigo tuyo.   Puedes tener un patio hasta el muro o hasta el horizonte pero lo importante es cuanto te recreas eficazmente en el.   Puedes iluminar tu noche con bombillas o estrellas, pero lo importante es la luz que halla en tu corazon.   Puedes tener a tus padres cerca o verlos muy poco, pero lo importante es si te dan consejos y te ense?an como funciona  la vida.

eVyzEZAMaa	Hola.  Siempre he pensado lo siguiente: Para que las personas que estan a nuestro alrededor estn bien, primero debe estar bien uno mismo.  Lo que vemos mal en otras personas muchas veces lo estamos proyectando.  Hay amistades que en definitiva no son sanas, hay que darles la vuelta por el bien de todos.  Dicen por ahi, que los mejores amigos son los peores enemigos, y considero que s porque cuando hay diferencias, el amigo sabe cmo eres y maneja a la perfeccin tus puntos dbiles. S ms inteligente y no permitas que interfiera en tu vida.  Para pelear se necesitan dos y en alguien debe caber la prudencia.   Analzate objetivamente y si en realidad quieres terminar con esa situacin ponle remedio, la respuesta mejor est en t.   Eres muy inteligente, asi que estoy segura que saldras victoriosa de esto.saludos|`|247faa5d0ca75bca8d98bc57f498c1b1aa	hay una terapia que se llam reflexologia podal contactame  georgeft_25@yahoo.com.mx|`|PsgueyXxaa	Llevalo al siclogo, es importante que alguien externo a la familia lo haga darse cuentra de todo lo que vale.

d53a1da7f35c7051494c4a699eba209caa	Bueno en base a lo k he investigado...    la prostitucin.  Surgi justo cuando el varn se vincul a su pareja y familia y se encarg del sustento. Y a la par las mujeres perdieron el derecho a ejercer otras profesiones con las que autosostenerse. Y as la prostitucin era la nica que poda ejercer en esas condiciones.  La causa original de la prostitucin se encuentra en LA INSTAURACIN DEL MATRIMONIO que tuvo como consecuencias:  (a) - El establecimiento de la herencia patrilineal, por lo que la propiedad del suelo cultivable pasaba a los hijos varones. Por ello la mujer dej de ser due?a de los frutos del campo y ya no poda autosostenerse econmicamente.   (b) - Al perder la mujer su valor econmico, slo se la valoraba en su funcin de esposa y madre de muchos hijos. Dado el exclusivo papel de procreadora que la esposa tena en la familia patriarcal, estara siempre embarazada. As que los esposos acudiran a otras mujeres para que les proporcionasen placer, con lo que la demanda de prostitutas incrementara la oferta. Comenta Kneissler en (1993, 64) de la sociedad patriarcal griega: "Cuando no estaban embarazadas, los maridos se limitaban a cumplir desapasionadamente tres veces al mes con sus deberes conyugales."|`|aee023633663954822e70e1dc0515c5aaa	EN REALIDAD LAS MUJERES LO INVENTAROS   EL DINERO HACE MARAVILLAS...........|`|c6651f87019cf0361303a46b4729d6c4aa	No se quien lo invento pero sin duda la ms beneficiada es la mujer, porque al saber lo basicos que somos nosotros los hombres, averiguaron como sacarnos plata mientras nos mantienen contentos!|`|e0baa1b2b4707ea343a9ac4b76e82b13aa	Tomalo como quieras, invento, necesidad, promiscuidad, .....

Me parece que mas bien la prostitucin, para los que la eligieron como trabajo y estilo de vida, es ponerle precio al placer, tal como lo es cobrar por dar un masage o por tocar msica. Para aquellos que no la eligieron y fueron forzados o forzadas a hacerlo, es simplemente un infierno, una vejacin, una humillacin, que no tiene que ver con quien la invent, sino con la perversin y la ambicin de los que la causan, sean hombres o mujeres.|`|e0c027c06030f3c91c0211b7007f3615aa	que pregunta!! no creo q sea un invento de los hombres ni de las mujeres se dio asi por q en otra epoca existia la prostitucion como algo re normal!! me parece q puede ser por las dos partes muchas mujeres se dejaban por q les pagaban y muchos hombres querian tener relaciones con ellas!!|`|d27de20a119bf582f3523bc9574f5677aa	Pues si es de los hombres, no se me ocurre de quien mas podria ser|`|AA11525409	No, como va a hacer un invento?

cc478a76ead63d939834df89f8a19807aa	El problema de todo pais hispanoamericano queda claro en la distribucin de las rentas, queda claro que hay una injusta distribucin de las rentas del pais entre sus ciudadanos.    De tal manera que a pesar de que digan que por ejemplo la renta percpita de Espa?a a subido, en realidad unos se llevan 5000 euros y otros menos de 600, nada o muy poco.    Y esto es porque tenemos todos una injusta, discriminatoria, distribucin de la renta y de la consideracin de los derechos a la persona y a sus dignidades.    Y unos precios poltcos de la bolsa de la compra que no se corresponden a lo que ganamos los que lo ganan, por ejemplo en Espa?a un caf solo vale un dolar treinta centavos o sea un euro; un paquete de cigarrillos 3 euros, o sea 4 dlares, ir a cenar vale 30 euros por persona, un litro de gasolina vale un euro, un dolar con treinta centavos, un kilogramo de carne de novillo vale 16 euros o sea veinte dolares el kilogramo, una barra de pan vale un euro, o sea un dolar con treinta centavos. un piso vale ms de 160 mil euros o sea casi 200. 000 dolares el ms barato. entonces comparad.      Hispanoamrica; Espa?a incluida va bien. ?Para quin?, podramos preguntarnos.     La economa crece  y la revista Forbes nos incluye en la lista de pases con mayor nmero de ricos; pero lo cierto es que los empleos son cada vez peores, los salarios han ido perdiendo poder adquisitivo hasta situarse en su nivel ms bajo desde hace diez a?os, y nos vemos condenados a una especie de cadena perpetua: encadenados a nuestra hipoteca de por vida.     As, podemos ver que las grandes fortunas de nuestro pas se han construido sobre la base del relativo empobrecimiento de los dems. Y es que Espa?a sigue siendo diferente    Tras una dcada con unas tasas de crecimiento econmico que asombraban al resto de pases, y despus de ver que algunas empresas se han tragado multitud de empresas de otros pases, nos podemos preguntar:     ?Cundo tanta bonanza econmica va a llegar a nuestros bolsillos?     Lejos de atar a los perros con longaniza, nos encontramos con que la ciudadana cada vez tiene que apretarse ms el cinturn, los jvenes ven imposible la idea de emanciparse por falta de recursos hasta que prcticamente dejan de ser jvenes, y los matrimonios son reacios a tener hijos hasta casi los 40    Ante los histricos beneficios de las empresas (basados en la contencin salarial) y la escalada de precios  sobre todo en vivienda, el PIB necesariamente tiene que reflejar un notable incremento.     Dicho de otro modo, nuestro modelo de crecimiento se ha sustentado en salarios bajos y precios altos, para que las empresas hayan podido obtener grandes beneficios, que se han visto traducidos en un incremento del PIB.    un saludo, no confundais crecimiento econmico con desarrollo econmico y con una justa distribucin de rentas.     Lo que hay en HispanoAmrica es una injusta distribucin de las rentas que son acaparadas por unos pocos; lo que est dando lugar a que estemos en crisis de consumo perpetuas.     Pues los consumidores que somos muchos no tenemos rentas para poder consumir y eso da pie a que las industrias fracasen, a que haya crisis econmicas perpetuas y a que la desigualdad econmica brille todo el tiempo por la mala e injusta distribucin de las rentas y de los salarios.    un saludo.,|`|mHWykE7Naa	bueno soy de el salvador y el salrio minimo de mi pais es de 160 dolares al mes  yo digo q toda latinoamerica esta jodida porque somos unos pendejos q le hacemos caso al biejo corrupto de bush  por eso no prospera latinoamerica no cren|`|LgWypJ5gaa	$5.15 Puerto Rico|`|cBp0s9Itaa	soy de Puerto Rico y el salario mnimo es $5.15 que poquito verdad?|`|c0edc7d6192005084b51fb70ae30b49baa	En Chile el sueldo mnimo es de aproximadamente $135.000, lo que equivale a unos 260 dlares      Ahora que te respond esta pregunta, ?Puedes responderme esta otra pregunta?:    http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|gJ8cexfjaa	En colombia son 460.000 mensuales, algo as como lo que gana un yankee en dos horas............pero, bueno hay que vivir con eso..........|`|RD3OFTQraa	Soy de Panama, y el salario minimo depende de tu oficio, y de si es empresa peque?a, mediana, o grande, por lo general es un poco ms de 250 dlares al mes-|`|haRIapVuaa	En Panam el sueldo mnimo es de 285 dolares mensuales.

0YQRbq9faa	I worked as a legal assistant to pay my way though grad school and seminary.  We had only civil cases.  My wife has been a senior paralegal for a large firm for almost 20 years.  She has only had civil cases.  I have served on juries before on civil cases (i.e. disputes over money or property or something involving money - not criminal acts).    The way it works is the judge gives you instructions - "jury instructions" which both sided basically argue about in court and agree that these are fair instructions to guide the jury's decision.    The judge basically gives you the basic dispute summarized in a sentence.  He shows you the requirements of the law.  He tells you to summarize what you all think then make a decision yes or no on the various disputes between the litigants in the case.    In the jury room, we talk about who we believe is telling the truth and who is lying.  We banter the facts and questions the judge tells us to decide.  The testimony of the eye-witnesses or the written documents weighs heavily upon who we thought was lying and who was telling the truth in their testimony on direct and cross examination.    I personally think that a jury trial is okay for civil money matters.  They are cut and dried and straightfoward though lawyers try to lead you down their legal rabbit trails to distract you from the real matters that are not favorable to their client.  All lawyers are trained to do this by quibbling over procedures, technicalities, and things that have nothing to do with the absolutely crystal clear, verifyable facts of the case.    However, my wife and I personally think that for criminal matters, they should be held before a 5 panel judge.  I know the founding fathers built into our system a jury system of your peers.  However, are any of the people really my peers?  Do they have good, sound judgment based on the clear facts?  Do they have an ax to grind or a hidden agenda motivating their opinions?  Are they even educated?  Do they speak English?  Do they understand what is going on in the case as presented to the jury?      I think there really is no more "jurors of your actual peers" available anymore in our country because people have become so subjective, self-centered, and immoral in their personal life that they don't make clear, rational, factual decisions anymore.  They don't think critically, analyze and weigh carefully the weight of the matters before them.  Therefore, I think you would get a better, more fair, more reasonable, more well thought through verdict in a criminal case if it they did away with the jury system and had a panel of 5 to 9 judges sit on these cases; and they cannot be lifetime appointments.  They should serve like 5 to 7 years then can never serve again; otherwise they would become corrupt and the power they hold over life and death and prison would go to their heads and they would open up to bribes and influence peddling sleazy lawyers and the rich who can pay them off.  (I know the majority of lawyers are not sleazy but the sleazy ones are extra sleazy politician wanta-bes that is why they stand out so clearly and make the other attorneys look bad).    Good luck in figuring all your questions out.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	The jury can only listen to the testimony and the evidence provided for that case and then debate the outcome.  The jury has the right in the jury room to ask additional questions, and to look at evidence again, and the Judge will allow or disallow that.  It also helps if people on the jury know the law, and ironically some jury members have a talent of skill that can add additional information to the case.  Sometimes the information is not enough, you are right.  You can have jury members who get on a case just to throw the case.  I had jury duty on a capital case and there was a jury member who was catholic on the case.  He should have never been allowed to be on the jury as his religion prevents him from voting the death penalty.  Luckily the laws then allowed the judge to vote the death penalty if the jury couldn't agree on it and since we voted 11 to 1, the judge sided with us and voted the death penalty.  I think when you are on the jury you can tell which people you think are lying and telling the truth.  In one case I had a cop did a bad thing, but he admitted he did the bad thing, and explained why he did it, and not one member of the jury ever brought up the thing the cop did, I guess because he told the truth.  There is a book out I think it is called "The CSI Effect" and it is about how there are things on tv shows that have not been invented yet.  So tv shows like CSI and Bones and shows like that are claiming computer programs can do this or that, but in reality, technology is not that far advanced yet.  They are claiming they have machines that do this or that, and again, there is no technology that can do the things they claim.  Whereas these are just tv shows and they are fake, real people expect the cops to come up with some of this kind of evidence.  There are many states overturning convictions because of DNA evidence that was not available at the time of the trial.  There is more and more proof that eye witness testimony is often wrong.  You can also sway jury members to vote your way if they don't know they have the right to ask for a smoke break.  They will change their vote just so they can go smoke a cigarette.  I guess a jury has to make the best possible decission on the evidence and information provided, and hope they did the right thing.  I had a jury duty case where a man murdered 2 women, and we found out after the case was over that there were 3 other dead women this man had also killed, and probably more the police don't know about, so that helped us know we made the right decission.|`|e7a3fccfb2817fc53718752de19ad354aa	I had to serve jury duty once.  You have to listen intently to both arguements and then the judge tells you what you need to base your decision on.  More or less a set of guidlines to follow.    You have to hold true, that no is guilty until it is beyond a reasonable doubt that something is amiss.  Then there is a debate among jurers.  Different outlooks are exchanged, as well as what others might have missed.  Then put to a vote, and when there are some left that do not agree with the masses, it is up to the court to determine what the winning vote count is.  Sometimes it is 75% or !00% agreeable.    On my particular case, it was 100% agreed upon, in a fraud case.  So there are a lot of different things to consider, and it is a very important task to serve on a jury.

Think twice before you commit to anything, -- say okay "i will think about it "or " well i dont know maybe"." i will see if i have time", or " i will try". Then if you think you can do it then do it at all costs. Make up your mind sacrifice other stuff and do that one thing you commit to.  4. Dont dodge people, politely refuse, but dont forget  telling them the reason you refused.  5. Make your life less complicated by making less friends less socializing, less thinking about hurtfull stuff.  6. Make up a good routine get up early sleep early. Have good food   oraganize your time table.  7 Keep a note book about you weekly plans and on fridays check them up and know how many tasks and appointments you were successfull in meeting and how many you weren't and why.  8. keep distance from people you think will make you mad.  9  Read books watch movies hang out but not too much , remember studies are your first priorities,   iam sure you are very smart  Hope i would have helped you out  Good luck!|`|trMsK86jaa	I command thee to jump off a cliff.|`|e7a3fccfb2817fc53718752de19ad354aa	Well, first off... stop cancelling your counceling sessions.  Those are probably panic attacks that stop you from following through on your word.    Second, instead of giving a yes or no answer, tell whomever asks for a favor, that you will have to check your appt book first and then get back to them.  That leaves you with not saying yes or no.  I think you are starting to progress with social anxieties.  You need to help yourself before you can be there for others.  Again KEEP AND ATTEND ALL counceling appointments.  I also do this constantly.  You are only hurting yourself in the long run by trying to evade facing your issues head on.  Best of luck!!

Dance has a power to build communities too.|`|fBkTU9Kjaa	it depends on the country, for instance in latin american it is very important if you are looking for a girlfriend/boyfriend, dancing means not only fun but a "feature"  your might have, and if you do it well you would be considered cool and girls may go out with you.

It is one of the many things we were meant to do together. It is on the same plain as laughing, smiling, singing, talking and as many things we can do together. It is another form to bring man together in a joyful setting.

AA10324123	More information would be necessary to answer your question.    Are you seeking a comparision for general knowledge, or for a reference resource?    Any old comparison of the two practices will likely not be helpful.  Proponents of both camps would likely sway a written comparison, based on their rates of success.  Of course, the case history of the group/client/patient will ultimately dictate which techniques are likely to be most beneficial.  And, of course, they are not mutually exclusive.      Are you theorizing that one technique may be more applicable to certain types of change?    Your question is kind of like asking for a comparison between apples and oranges.  They are both fruit, yet very different.  And, can be beneficial alone or mixed into the same fruit salad.|`|695a2ec4fb904e20a43e655165fdb482aa	NLP is merely modelling and copying the best attributes of all the psychological disciplines, including TA, and using shortcuts to get the same, or at least similar results.

OUbNSXjJaa	There will be sunshine. Do not worry. No need to breakdown.    In general, it is always better and useful to forget the bad past. Take that as a big lesson in your life. And start everything afresh. Do not at all remember any bad episodes.|`|nHizaTiDaa	Seriously- there isn't anything that has happened to us or that we have done that someone else hasn't experienced either.    It's a big wake up call, to realize we are not all that unique in the world.      Yes there is only ONE you, and ever more shall be only one you-  but we don't experience anything that isn't common to all mankind.    Seek out others like you so you have someone to talk to.    You'd be surprised at what a friend some older person who has "been there, done that" could be too.    But you will find someone to talk to if you give it a good try.|`|0YpknkNsaa	I've been in your position Sunshine and it's like a living hell. The thing that got me through was going along to a modern Buddhist temple. They taught me to meditate to try to 'still' and quiten the thoughts in my head which were all encompassing at the time. They also showed me how to 'live in the present moment'. This meant really trying to notice and absorb everything that happens now, the present moment in time. Try it for yourself........sit still and notice everything that is happening......sounds, smells, temperatures, physical senstaions, sights, colours and so on. The more you practice it the more you will notice. the more you notice, the less space you give to thoughts of your past. Even when you're going through a really **** time emotionally, practice it time and time again.    These ideas may sound stupid, but they work. Believe me it will get better because YOU can make it happen. Believe yourself and you will learn to love your life again x    Somewhere, sometime, you WILL have to draw a line under the past and 'start again'. Make that start today and start to write down all your feelings, however small, in a blank book. Let all your thoughts, feelings and emotions out onto the blank pages. Write down EXACTLY how you think and feel at the time you are writing. Let all the hurt, pain and venom (we all feel that so get it out) make their way out of your head and onto those pages. Don't let anyone see your book and don't write in it as if you think someone else is going to read it. Write it from the heart.     At first it will seem as though you are always writing. But as your pain eases you will find that you are writing less and less. Eventually you will be able to gather all your books together (yes there will be more than one!) and decide that you can move on now that all your feelings are contained in those books. What you do with them after that is your decision.     Start drawing that line today Sunshine cus it will be longer than you think it is. But from today onwards it will get shorter. Be brave and face your demons......you are a courageous lady x|`|1PJeTaVLaa	Miss Sunshine,time heals everything|`|jg1pbV5Xaa	You will break down. You are doing that, and this, to yourself. As long as you think you will break your weakening yourself. Everyone breaks now and then, some hide it better than others though.    Dumb as it sounds read some positive thinking books, they give you a boost while they teach you how to forgive your past. Yes we are all damaged goods, have all done bad things, had bad things done to us. That was then. Today you are a person made up of all that, but it is a new day your a new person today that has a new future. Forgive the past, what they did to you as well as what you have done and move forward as best you can from here, now. It takes time to forgive, not forget because kowing those things keep you from doing them again.    No one is perfect, I may be close, laugh, at least until I look in a mirror and have to face myself again, Look in a mirror and forgive that person who looks back at you, talk to them as if they were someone else entirely and make friends with them. The two of you can make it through this, you did before, must have since your both here.    You know what to do even if you do not want to do it. You can deal with anything life throws your way, that does not mean you will like everything that happens, but you can deal with it, will deal with it, you do not really have any other choice.|`|65653c6c063e99db1f7f272c5c93e006aa	Effi makes very good points but when push comes to shove, I need something bigger and more powerful than myself give me lasting peace.

Are you restless in your sleep; move around, kick off the covers, talk in your sleep, a history of walking in your sleep?  Do you snore?  How long have you had this problem?  Once you've written out all your adverse symptoms try and see what it matches the best:<br>  Sleep apnea - snoring<br>  Biplor illness - racing thoughts<br>  ADHD - constant thoughts or worries, restlessness<br>  Restless Leg syndrome - Jerking legs<br>  Poor sleep hygiene - too many distractions<br>       I'm sure there are many more, including medical reasons.

Perhaps it is difficult to decide to hope, but being oriented towards hope means to already have a degree of hope that might only need to be enhanced, as hope, like confidence, has got a life of its own that must be dreamingly nurtured and lovingly made to grow.<br>  <br>  So, where there is hope there is a dreamy possibility of renewed life. You have the feeling that you want to regain your confidence and that is a wonderful basis for your becoming more open-minded and more outgoing, with renewed emotions, for love, and for more hope.<br>  <br>  You might decide to confidently start, at this very moment, diligently working at building up some good glowing memory for a future.

I wouldn't worry about it too much, he could just have a lot on his mind, and doesn't realize he is being rude.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Yeah you can get bad vibes about someone.  They might have a demon or two.  I meant quite a few people I couldn't bear to be around.  People are so hateful and some are planning murder or doing atrocious things.  If you feel bad vibes, I think God is warning you.  It might even be dangerous to be in the class.  What if he brought a gun to class with him?  I mean God knows what is going on so we have to listen to his voice.  13 Christians were killed at Columbine High School in CO and 32 were killed in West VA.  Pray and seek God's face and He might tell you something.|`|VArXPOMPaa	Who knows what is going on in his head or life for that matter. Your perception of how he looked/looks at you may be off.

There are other stages of sleep that must be reached first to achieve dream sleep.  If not...restorative sleep won't be adequate.  People who fall alseep too quickly usually end up with disorders like narcolepsy and what they call 'excessive daytime sleepiness".
AA10510845	I don't think I would want to experience any of those things, and even though rape seems to be the lesser of those other two evils, it would still leave its brand on the psyche.  Rape is something no woman ever gets over.  So I can't honestly answer that question, because it's like asking which method of death to do you prefer?  Strangulation, drowning, or being pushed out of a ten-story window?  There is no acceptable choice.  I'm female, not a psychologist or a counselor, although I know human nature quite well.  I am not religious per se, but I believe in God.  I have grown children and grandchildren, so yes, I guess you could say that I've had sex.

Then I called the corporate office of that chain and complained about her.<br>  Yes, ironically, I did talk with family and it made me sad.

He was stuck at a standstill on the icy highway, and there are cars that skidded off the road in a ditch.  He's close enough to turn around and come back, but wants to stick it out and try to make it home.  It's dark, icy, and he's tired.

cDjWONryaa	I can only think that possibly you changing your life and doing things different and getting a better view of what you life is supposed to be like has changed you in more ways than just not doing drugs any longer.<br>  <br>  You may be becoming less dependent on the need for whatever it was that she provided to you in your friendship or whatever it was that she was doing that helped you feel better about yourself now since you have gained more confidence in who you are and where you are going you no longer need that to feel good so there is a sense of loss of something that once was when in reality its still there your body & mind just isn't in as much need for it any more.<br>  <br>  And in reality things have changed, you say it "SEEMS" like it did but it DID change and you CHANGED.<br>  <br>  So it's ok not to love her anymore, just like her and be the friend that she was to you obviously in a time in your life when you really needed her to be there for you emotionally.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|V9ddU84Iaa	Have you considered that maybe you don't anymore?

Now that you're off the junk and trying to make something positive out of your life, maybe subconsciously you are trying to forget all the things and people that were in your life when you were on drugs.  Now that your mind is clear, you can think more rationally.  Maybe this wasn't such a good relationship, and your brain is telling you to move on.  You can still be friends, even if you don't feel love for her anymore.  Just don't slip back into your old habits.  Good luck!
45d774f93cd8fa9f498a7d7487bd0caaaa	Your wonderful son is no more,<br>  <br>  but all those years of good memories are, and those memories have wondrous lives of their own that can be nurtured, that can give you great nostalgic company, and for a little while make you forget all that pain and all those tears,<br>  <br>  and perhaps they will give you more strength, telling you that life must go on, and that you have a further holy loving duty with your present children, with their well-being and unfolding and future, and with others about you that might treasure your loving help.<br>  <br>  Do your have great albums of photos, or just some few ones. If you do, you might try and go through them, on your own, or in the warm company of a good friend. The glowing memories with those photos might afford you some good moments of consolation that for a while might silence the pain that so much wants to oppress and to deeply sicken the warm throbbing vaults of your own chest.<br>  <br>  We that have children out into an ever dangerous world must live in constant fear about their health and about their destiny. But we must try and also think that the life short or long that Providence will afford our children, and all our other beloved ones, has got a wondrous meaning that may not be up to us to understand. I know that it is tough to have to realize this, but we might try and humbly acknowledge this with humility of soul and peacefully wait till tears once more have been shed.<br>  <br>  We may have loving hopes for those souls that are no more with us, and we may have ardent hopes for those who are with us and who so much will need the treasures of our own presence and of our loving help.<br>  <br>  We have got to try and at least regain the possibility of a loving smile for those at home with us who need our further protection, and thus a warm tiny glow of confidence and hope. These, in fact, go hand in hand.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I am so sorry for your loss, and your pain, and your hurt.  I wish I could say something to make you feel better.  It certainly sounds like you need a new counselor.  I think most people can offer sympathy when you child first dies, but they forget that there are days when the loss smacks you in the face.  You are lucky you still have two other kids though.  I wonder if there are support groups or church groups you could join that could offer you some comfort.  I am sorry your heart hurts, all I can do is pray for you.  <br>  <br>  God grant me the serenity<br>  to accept the things I cannot change<br>  Courage to change the things I can<br>  And the wisdom to know the difference   <br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|s3IBrhZCaa	i am indeed, very sorry for your loss. <br>  <br>  i can not imagine the pain that you must be going through, and i wont pretend to "understand."<br>  <br>  it is ok to be sad. you can not help but feel how you do. <br>  <br>  the only thing i can say is........your Son, God bless his soul......would not want you to spend the rest of your life in misery.|`|0NcRUSCoaa	My heart goes out to you.  I can't take your pain away, but I can relate to how you feel.  I lost my beloved fiance to suicide 8 months ago and the pain is terrible.

I just want to be with him, but I keep going for him.  One thing I do is write a journal to him whenever I can.  It helps a little.  Maybe it is your son who is giving you your strength.

My thoughts are with you-please feel free to email me if you want to talk.  x|`|AA10510845	I'm so sorry for your loss.  I know what heartache is.  I lost my only brother with whom I was very close.  I still cry when I think of how he was taken in the prime of his life, and never got to do the things he wanted to do.  It seems so unfair.  He's been gone for a year and a half, and I miss him very much.  The pain goes away, but you never really forget someone you love.  Those precious memories can never be taken away.  I'll tell you what someone told me after my loss.  He said that God always takes the most beautiful flowers from his garden for a special bouquet.  Your son was as special to God as he was to you.  And someday, you'll see him again.  Good luck, dear, and take good care of yourself and those little ones.|`|JQjl5obUaa	I fail to see how anything you said could be considered "dumping".<br>  <br>  My older brother was about 3 years older when the Al Qaida / Contra / Dope Dealing Conserfative Republican resident fifth columnists shot him to death for the 'crime' of trying to be a good citizen and narcotics interdiction team member.<br>  <br>  I blame myself sometimes, even though I know he was in trouble with the mob from before that, because the resident thugs were so anti-Jewish that they would 'hunt' them, using juvenile convicts to do it. He had little sympathy with murder, especially State Employee's using underaged children to shoot people to "express" said State Employee's prejudices. (He had had trouble of some kind that I never knew anything about, but joined the police after this was expunged ~ still he shared what the criminals running the "corrections" departments were doing in the way of murder for fun and profit and gang innitiation ~ yes, in Maine).<br>  <br>  This was about 1980 when they shot he and I whilst we were on a drug interdiction patrol for the Warden's Service.<br>  <br>  Parts of our government was importing (and likely still is) dope in the hulls of contaminated Soviet Submarines, that had evidently had problems with their reactors and were officially scrapped. Officially, this that we in our derug interdiction team was fighting was a covert operation to fund the Contras. And "our executive branch" had OK'ed such breech into our common interests and national security along with the fun type money laundering services of Al Qaida ~ who were then fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan, and thus could get a Soviet sub via their opiate trade with the occupying Soviet Armed forces / mob, but they did not tell us.<br>  <br>  In fact, they told us our pistols would easily penatrate any body armour out there ~ whilst outfitting our competition with ceramic body armor, some of whom didn't have to buy their own weapons (I went to WAR on DRUGS outfitted with a borrowed pistol I had fired only two cylinders worth of ammo through). And that armour the drug smugglers for Reagan had was good enough to take two well placed shots from my brother's Smith and Wesson 38 special without a glitch.<br>  <br>  And they had automatic rifles and an automatic machine pistol, etc.<br>  <br>  He got stitched over 20 times; I was shot 13 times.<br>  <br>  I get no pention.<br>  <br>  I get no counceling ~ officially it didn't happen. They even stole my brother's ID.<br>  <br>  And yet so many still vote "cons Serfative"<br>  <br>  Now, see ? <br>  <br>  <---- that is Dumping.|`|UxSF3Doaaa	Hi! A contact sweet friend of mine asked me to pray for you, and I sure will hun! I am here for you if you ever need to talk. I'll also pray that you get the professional help that you seek and is available enough to you.<br>  <br>  If there is one greater loss than a parent, it is THAT of a child. Nothing hurts worse than that. And because you expect children to out-live you, not the other way around, that what makes it so painful. You expect to see if you're going to be a grandparent, you expect to see all that is going on in their future as long as you live. But then, when the child dies, you get left with SO many uncertainties, and that is part of the biggest parental heart break.<br>  <br>  Even the strongest person is going to feel pain sometime. That is why there is that Beattitude in the Bible: Blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted.<br>  <br>  Though the pain does not ever fully go away, do try to do what you can to be the person your son can be proud of, and know he does not want you sad.

They don't in the long run. Besides, it's not really a change with them, it's the substance that's doing it. There's nothing wrong with being quiet and shy, but maybe if you talked just a bit more people wouldn't think you're boring. Maybe decorate your office or desk (if you're allowed) or find things in common with people at work. Wear an outfit with a splash of color or pattern to it. It's all in how people perceive you. If you appear confident and friendly, even if you are still quiet and shy, people will be less likely to find you boring. Perhaps you could try humming or whistling some random happy song while you work. And don't forget: You can't please everyone. Not everyone is going to think you're exciting and not everyone is going to think you're boring either. You don't really have to change yourself to change people's perceptions of you.|`|gmZLGuNtaa	this is how i am at school...<br>  <br>  i was always quiet and shy...when teachers pick on me to answer a question.....i answer it but they always say what, speak up please...<br>  <br>  its annoying...but over time i learned, that you can be however you want without caring what other think..<br>  <br>  i mean theyre not the ones putting a roof over your head, <br>  theyre not the ones who feed you day by day, <br>  so why worry about them...<br>  <br>  i guess its all about devotion...<br>  if u set ur mind to changing your personality, you will<br>  its like losing weight if people want to lose weight, they will do it if they set their mind to it....<br>  <br>  be positive about things and anyone can do what they set their mind to....<br>  <br>  good luck|`|n2y17YsOaa	You can change your personality all you want, but you will not be happy with a false personality.

Call a local mental health hospital or 911 and tell them that your friend is cutting. They will be able to help him. Your friend might be mad at you for it, but in the long run they will thank you, I know. <br>  <br>  Talk to your friend and find out why he cuts. See if you can help him to stop, but don't do it alone. Help him to get help. <br>  <br>  I had to call 911 for my friend when he told me that he was cutting and that his arm was bleeding severely, and I was in another state at the time, so I had to call someone in the town he was in and get them to call 911.

Your friend has some psychological problems that need to be addressed because he does not have a proper outlet to express his feelings. If they won't seek professional help, assure your friend that you are there for him no matter what, and that they don't need to do the cutting because it doesn't accomplish anything. If it keeps up, you have to be the bigger person and tell someone else who can help.|`|QwKiK85eaa	Yes but he is most likely cutting to show he needs help people mostly cut there wrist when they are seeking attention sorry but this is just the truth|`|0NcRUSCoaa	It means he is in a lot of emotional pain. It may not directly lead to suicide, but he does need help.  People who cut themselves do it as a release to the agony they are in.  If he is not getting help, he needs to.  He is lucky to have such a good friend as well.  Good luck.
