20081118074720AAYD96n	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	In the book Pride and Prejudice, what does "coming out" mean?	It has mentioned the idea of younger sisters "coming out" after their eldest sister gets married. I think it may have something to do with their ability to be out in society, but I would really like to know the specifics of it. I tried to google search it, but you can imagine the things that came up... lol      Here are some quotes:   After Charlotte agreed to marry Mr. Collins, the narrator states,   "The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done" (chapter 22)       It comes up again when Lady Catherine was speaking to Elizabeth, "Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?" (chapter 29)      Thank you for your help!

20090220200130AAqL1Q6	Arts & Humanities;History	If Lincoln didn't save the Union, where would we be today?	If Lincoln didn't save the Union, do you think that the world as we know it would be drastically different? Would the World Wars not happen? Would America be as broken up as Europe? Would the Confederate States have slavery for a long time after that and now be considered something as extreme as a terrorist nation? Would the Confederate states not "survive" and come back to the Union? Would The US become a world power, which would lead to the roaring twenties which would partially cause the Stock market crash and eventually the great depression. And if the great depression didn't happen, would Hitler be as influential as he was which would start WWII?         BTW if you give a decent site about this potential scenario, You'd be more likely to get best answer. The most likely chance wold be someone who posts their opinion as well as posts a site. The time you post doesn't matter, and the ratings themselves don't make a ton of difference. So don't rush to get the information as fast as you could

20090220215756AADPea2	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I would like some feedback of a excerpt of a short story im writing?	the clipping is of a romance part of the story. its taken somewhat out of context, so im looking more for feedback of the formation of thoughts as well as the storytelling. the "a, b, and c" in the story in italic font represents characters i have yet to name of develop. any constructive crit is appreciated. the word family here means a strong group of friends. it is only a draft so far, so don't expect any extremely beautiful grammar.      "Look at me" she said as I started to walk away from her and everything I left behind so long ago. "Look at me!!!" she said again, this time much louder. It wasn’t her voice, but the echo of her voice which screamed through the night air that sent a cold chill through my soul. I couldn’t help but to look back at her. Then I walked back. She completed her sentence. "…like you used to" her eyes were glassy. She was so strong. But she couldn’t fight the tears back any longer. I had little time to word exactly how I felt. I let my words flow. "For so long, you have looked at me with that pain in your eyes. and even now, there is nothing I can do".   "What do I have to do to make you look at me again, the way you used to, to look at a again the way you used to. At b. at c. to look at you family again.. Then her words became almost mumbles. The emotions and tears were vividly carried through the words. What do I have to do? What do I have to do, she said again. Silence entered. For what it seemed was so long, silence stayed. "Why did you come back", she mumbled, tears still streaking down her face. I had no answer..so she answered for me. "It’s because you couldn’t let go. You can’t let go. And now you’re holding on more than ever”. As she said that, her head fell on my chest. The weeping now turned to cries. She asked again, her face against my chest, this time as if she was whispering to my heart, “What do I have to do”.   "You have done enough. Now, lay your head and rest”. The three forbidden words weren’t needed to be said as I pushed myself away from her, and walked away into the silence of the cold dark night. It started to rain.      excerpt 2: this i acutally plan to place far early in the story.    ...so i let my words flow.   "i missed you...alot. for some reason, you were the only one i was able to think of. not a. not b. not even the people i pledged to protect. heh. i often found myself asking if you were thinking of me, as i was about you."   i found myself looking down. i was embarrased by what i said. i sounded like such a loser and so desperate. i was thinking about things too much and too fast again until my thoughts broke as she started talking.   "i did think of you. i thought i was just being a little girl...but now with what you've told me...ive missed you, very much, almost too much."   i went blank. all i could do now was stare through her in amazment. i found myself looking down again, but this time with a smile on my face.   "thank you", she said.   "for what?"   "for missing me."   i let out a breath of a laugh."why wouldnt i miss you?"   "why would you?"   "i love you". as i said that everything went silent. even the wind that was blowing her beautiful red hair against her face died down. her eyes seemed almost empty. it felt like time itself stopped.   "..."   i knew i had to say something. i couldn't help what i just said. i had to change this moment. i had to make something out of this. i had to recover from this mistake.   "i hope that didn't come out too cheesy. i spent the whole trip back trying to word that right without sounding so--"   "hey..stop talking." she cut me off. i was ready for a verbal lashing. i felt terrible and sick. after all she went through, i should be aware of her feelings. it was so obvious. what was i thinking. was i thinking? these thoughts raced through my head so fact that i COULDN'T think. i attempted to stumble for words, but before i could say anything, she finished what she started saying.   "i love you too."   i felt like i went dead.

20090220163531AALVC7o	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Please help with a John Donne poem :)?	have to write a 4 page paper (I know, not that bad) on one of John Donne's holy sonnets (#13, attached) and I'm not very good at translating poems. I think it has to do with Jesus' Crucifixion and the speaker is pitying Jesus because all beauty is to be pitied and ugliness is to be feared...??? what do you think?      What if this present were the world's last night?   Mark in my heart, O soul, where thou dost dwell,   The picture of Christ crucified, and tell   Whether His countenance can thee affright.   Tears in His eyes quench the amazing light;   Blood fills his frowns, which from His pierced head fell;   And can that tongue adjudge thee unto hell,   Which pray'd forgiveness for His foes' fierce spite?   No, no ; but as in my idolatry   I said to all my profane mistresses,   Beauty of pity, foulness only is   A sign of rigour ; so I say to thee,   To wicked spirits are horrid shapes assign'd;   This beauteous form assures a piteous mind.         How is Donne doubting or knowing anything?

In this afterlife deep in the abyss of black and white I fight to remember the difference between wrong and right. Memory fading...secrets spilling…all of me revealing to the world. Torn away from material things all I want to see is my angel with wings. Come to take me from this place…away from this demon man with all my sins strewn across his face. I remember now, as I’m in his grip… how has my life come to this?

Just a list.   Names of those who had done nothing wrong   She hadn't realized her own faults-she needed to be strong   And so of course she can't resist      "To Let Live," she wrote in that same messy scrawl   Because it was then that she knew that those three words said it all

I know that Luxemburg and Liebknecht were murdered so basically the leaders of the Sparticists were gone meaning the Social Democrats really had no competition for power.      Another reason may be because german people wanted stability, and the Social Democrats were a moderate party, they weren't extremists.      This is what i think helped them gain power.      Any other info would help me greatly thanks.

20090220182657AAXxd9W	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Will you read my book report rough draft?(harry potter fans)?	I asked this, but, i editied it a little, so, here it is again. i'm not done yet, but, this is it, so far.   do you think it is good, for an 8th grader?      After reading the first chapter of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix by JK Rowling, I was extremely anxious to keep reading. In the first chapter, Harry Potter, the main character, and his cousin, Dudley Dursley, were at a park, when they were approached by dementors. Dementors are not supposed to go places where non-magical people, muggles, live. I was very anxious to find out why the dementor tried to attack Harry, and also extremely curious to find out what happens to him, because he performed magic in front of his muggle cousin, which is against wizard rules.     After reading about half of the book I really wanted to keep reading. I was so curious about how the Defense Against the Dark Arts group, “Dumbledore’s Army“, would work out, as well as what would happen to the horrible Hogwarts teacher/ high inquisitor, Dolores Umbridge. I was really hoping that Dolores Umbridge would soon be defeated, because through only half the book, I had grown to loathe her.     As soon as I finished the book, I was extremely sad. I was in shock that one of my favorite characters, Sirius Black, died. I was also shocked by the prophecy. The prophecy states that both Harry, and his enemy, Voldemort cannot live while the other survives. This means, that in the end, one of them will have to kill the other. This frightened me, because although Harry is a strong fighter, I was not sure if he would be able to defeat Voldemort.     Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix made me cry. The books in the Harry Potter series, in general, are the only books that have made me feel such emotion. This book, specifically, made me so emotional because I felt so bad for Harry. Sirius Black was the only family member Harry had that actually loved him. Harry was only beginning his relationship with his godfather, Sirius, but then Sirius was tragically killed. When Sirius was first introduced into the Harry Potter series, I fell in love with his character right away, so when he died, I was heartbroken.

What would be the appropiate settings if I wanted to take pictures in a low lit, enviornment such as restaurant?

These things shouldn't factor into your decisions.

20090220173514AAA0O56	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	How is my poetry and what could i work on as far as writing it?	Thoughts held captive.    The need to run free.    They try to escape through every part of me.    My mouth stays shut and I stay unheard.    Cant express my thoughts.    no not a word.    I pick up a pen    draw out some paper   crinkled paper    but paper none the less    sit down to express.    Every feeling I’ve felt gets dished out    so fast I skip words    just knowing    I need to get it out,   be heard.   Once jotted down    a weights been lifted.    Feelings turn to sweet poetry    But me im not gifted    or even beautiful    because wouldnt someone have told me so?    I need to be publically known    I can see it in my future and feel it deep inside    through my vains, my blood, intertwined.    But if I have a skill then    why, do I feel like a failure?    Even so, at the end of the day    I can let every thought held captive release.    Reveal.    When I have my poetry and music to feel.

20090220183459AAVAvYH	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	In Twilight the movie?	With the field trip.......I always wondered why Jasper was at the field trip with Alice. Edward, Bella, Alice, and Bella's friends are all juniors (pretty sure Jessica, Angela, Eric, Mike, Tyler and them are) but Jasper is a senior as well as Rosalie and Emmett, but he was at the field trip.      I guess it doesn't really matter. I liked that part and liked that he was there. Just thought that the other vamps should of been there as well lol.
20090220182753AA6MWkA	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Twilight fans, alright....?	Do any of your Twilight (book fans) find somethings about the movie that just annoys you? Things that were either put in or they did not put in? Yes give me some examples.      I'm annoyed that Bella is not that klutzy in the movie, as she is in the books. I am pretty sure she only fell down about 3 times. One of the reasons why I love Bella so much is because she is a total klutz. Its cute and hilarious lol.      Also the actor they chose for Emmett. I love him he is so hot and sexy....but he did not seem as 'funny' as I would of expected for Emmett to be. He did have a few cute, funny parts though. Just was not as silly, he was more serious.      Also on Emmett..... I remember seeing that trailer for Twilight so many freaking times and I always remember a certain scene that they didn't put in the movie and it annoys me. Its when someone says to Edward 'She's not one of us' I'm pretty sure its Emmett.      Kristen is okay, I didn't think I'd like her at all, but she was okay I guess........just think they could of found someone better. But thats fine, don't hate her.      The biggest thing that annoys me about the movie is we can NOT hear Edward hearing other peoples thoughts. It is so stupid that they did that, seriously. The movie would of been more of a hit I think. At least Edward hearing his vampire family thoughts, when they talk to him. If you watch the new show 'True Blood' you'll know that the girl hears thoughts and we can actually HEAR them. Its so awesome.      They showed Alice's gift at least once.....so that's good at least. But Edward is like one of the main characters and he is the main vampire. Does anyone agree with me on this subject?      Also it seemed to end very quickly. James took her, she went to the hospital, and then she went to prom lol........it just should of been like at least 20 more minutes. Also I'm annoyed that none of Edwards friends were at the prom. I mean Alice, I really figured they would of shown Alice dressed up, and dancing, having fun......and heck even Rosalie seems like she'd do that also. But Rosalie is in another year, so that's why she was not there. But Alice is not in another year lol.      Also in the movie they go out to eat a lot and in the book she cooks for her father all the time 'I thought that was cute lol'      There are some things that were different from the book and movie that I liked. Like the scene when Bella met everyone,  they were cooking I liked it. Rosalie is mean but it was funny. And Emmett, cooking was just so cute lol.      Then Jasper did not leave and go outside during the James scene, instead he was having fun with Emmett, killing James. Great part.      End of ramble. I do actually love the movie,  not as much as the books, but it was good. So I'm not complaining because I hate Twilight lol.
20090220183153AAbKhgM	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Favorite Twilight (movie) scenes?	Mine is the baseball scene, the 'bella meeting the family part, when they cook for her', The part where Bella goes to the ballerina studio and finds out that James lied and him getting killed lol, I loved the scenes in the lunch room with Bella looking at Edward and the vampires always staring at her, and the apple scene....though its funny he saves the apple from hitting the ground, but he lands on his dirty shoe lol....i'd not eat that haha. There were others, but these are my favorites.

20090220181530AAS4XIA	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Twilight or Confessions of a Shopaholic?	Both are series.   Twilight's a fantasy and romance.

It's got a bit of romance, and drama.

20090220183759AA312iC	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What is the theme of this poem ?	My Hero   By:  Keri   You may not consider yourself,   But you may very well be   A leader, a winner,   For all the world to see.      In the eyes of others,   You are a martyr.   You have received recognition,   And you have worked harder.      But why ? Why all the praise?   I have done nothing but kept my word,   To a dear friend who needed me,   In every incidence that occurred.      But friend, I tell you, you are a hero.   You helped me see the light.   When I had no eyes,   You saved me, and you were my sight.
20090220180115AA1ZAws	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you like my Speech? Any Suggestions?	Ok so heres the speech i wrote. I wanna know any suggestions. B.T.W im 13 and in the 8th grade. Rate on a scale of 1-10 please:      It all starts with one. One person. One citizen of the world, just like you, and me. One person, who’s ready for change. One person who is ready to stand up and make a difference. One person, who cares about the global community, and wants to make life better, for the people of the world. It starts with 1 person, and changes the world.       Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Every generation of people has had a problem faced before them. Years ago, African Americans had to fight for their right to be considered as equals in our society. Years ago, women fought for their rights to vote, and be of importance in our world. Now not just global citizens but residents of our own country are living in poverty. The world is calling for our help! This is our turn, our time, to change the world.      It was the great Mahatma Gandhi who once said “You must be the change you wish to see in the world.” It takes an action to create change. I look around and I can see that everybody wants to make change, wants to make a difference in the world. Everybody has the desire, to make a difference, though we often put barriers in front of ourselves. We think that it’s too hard. We think that we don’t have enough time. We think that we are too young, too old to make a difference. Because of these barriers that we are constantly placing in front of ourselves, our desire to make a difference never gets put to action. Imagine if we all removed those barriers in front of us. If we all worked together, as a community, what a change we could make in the world, what a difference we could make, what a great place the world could be.       Education, is a foundation, the first steps, what we need to live a better life. Unfortunately, millions of children simply cannot go to school. These children could be in a school, receiving the education they need, but can’t. Some of these children are forced to work in sweatshops, put in dangerous situations, making very little money, when they could be in a classroom. Some of these children, are forced to be child soldiers, without a choice, fighting for something that they are against, forced to fight family members, friends. It’s hard to imagine, this happening to children, simply because they cannot afford it, not able to have everyday things we take for granted.      At least 80% of humanity lives on less than $10 a day. People are living without a place to call home, without the amount of food they need to survive. Many of these people have to live on the streets, because they cannot afford even a small place to live in. Some of these people die; from diseases they don’t even know about, diseases they could have prevented. These people do not have access to clean drinking water, and are risking their health every time they simply take a drink. Imagine if this was you. Imagine being on your own, waking up in the morning and not knowing if you will survive another day. This is life for so many people of the world, It’s time to give these people help, give them a future, its time to change life for these people in our world.      Making a difference doesn’t have to be a difficult thing. It can be as simple as holding the door for somebody, giving somebody a smile. Buying a coffee for someone. These little things may not seem like much, but can make a difference. It doesn’t matter if you are doing little things, or big, if your helping people in your own community, or helping people of the global community. You’re making a difference. Little steps can lead to bigger steps and soon enough we will be making lives better, improving the world.       Today, I challenge you, to remove the barriers you place in front of yourselves. I challenge you to take action. It doesn’t have to be big! I challenge you to do something, anything, to change the world. I challenge you to get the community involved, the more people who help, and the more people who strive towards the goal, the bigger the action becomes. It seems like such a big challenge, such a big goal, but if we work together then the easier it will become to reach our goal, the easier it will become to make a difference.      It all starts with one, starts with one to make a difference, starts with one to create an action, so go out, be that one, be that leader, and make a difference, to change the world.

While Dad was polishing his new car, his four-year old son picked up a stone and scratched line on the side of the car.   In  his  anger,   Dad   took  the   child’s  hand   and   hit   it   many times,    not realizing    he    was   using  a  wrench.   At     the    hospital,     his     child    said,    “Dad,    when    will    my    fingers    grow    back?”    Dad    was    so   hurt.   He          went        back         to         the         car           and         kicked         it           a           lot         of           times.

20090220184411AAjgoZV	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you think this is very good?	i'm not really sure if this is worth continuing.      I found myself beginning to hate my home.  I hated the new couches, the silky drapes, the comfy pillows, all of which reeked of a furniture store.  I found myself hating the carpet the most.  It was everywhere.  No matter where I walked I could not escape it, even within the confinements of my own bedroom, the one room in the house I told my mom not to go near with her redecorating tools at hand.  But of course, mother knows best, specifically the best time to put in new carpet while I wouldn’t be home to stop her.  Everything in my house was a constant reminder that I had just lost my father, and an even bigger reminder that my mother was trying to create happiness by buying truckloads of things we didn’t need with my father’s life-long savings.

20090220193306AAVP5IN	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Dance with me?... Another poem by Oriah...Hope you like...?	"The Dance"    by Oriah Mountain Dreamer (The Dance book)         I have sent you my invitation   the note inscribed on the palm of my hand by the fire of living.    Don't jump up and shout, "Yes, this is what I want! Let's do it!"    Just stand up quietly and dance with me.       Show me how you follow your deepest desires,    spiralling down into the ache within the ache.    And I will show you how I reach inward and open outward    to feel the kiss of the Mystery, sweet lips on my own, everyday.       Don't tell me you want to hold the whole world in your heart.    Show me how you turn away from making another wrong without abandoning yourself when you are hurt and afraid of being unloved.       Tell me a story of who you are,    And see who I am in the stories I am living.    And together we will remember that each of us always has a choice.       Don't tell me how wonderful things will be . . . some day.    Show me you can risk being completely at peace,    truly OK with the way things are right now in this moment,    and again in the next and the next and the next. . .       I have heard enough warrior stories of heroic daring.    Tell me how you crumble when you hit the wall,    the place you cannot go beyond by the strength of your own will.    What carries you to the other side of that wall,    to the fragile beauty of your own humanness?       And after we have shown each other how we have set and kept the clear, healthy boundaries that help us live side by side with each other, let us risk remembering that we never stop silently loving those we once loved out loud.       Take me to the places on the earth that teach you how to dance, the places where you can risk letting the world break your heart.    And I will take you to the places where the earth beneath my feet and the stars overhead make my heart whole again and again.       Show me how you take care of business    without letting business determine who you are.    When the children are fed but still the voices within and around us shout that soul's desires have too high a price,    let us remind each other that it is never about the money.       Show me how you offer to your people and the world    the stories and the songs you want our children's children to remember, and I will show you how I struggle    not to change the world, but to love it.       Sit beside me in long moments of shared solitude,    knowing both our absolute aloneness and our undeniable belonging. Dance with me in the silence and in the sound of small daily words, holding neither against me at the end of the day.       And when the sound of all the declarations of our sincerest    intentions has died away on the wind, dance with me in the infinite pause before the next great inhale of the breath that is breathing us all into being, not filling the emptiness from the outside or from within.       Don't say, "Yes!"    Just take my hand and dance with me.

20090220195722AA8kEbc	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Chapter one beginning draft for my novel. Please fix it up a little? Opinions? Advice?	I'm writing something about a 15 yo. American girl living in Brooklyn during the early 20th century when all the immigrants were coming though Ellis Island. She falls in love with an Irish immigrant named Oliver. He's magical in the literal sense. There's more to it,but I'm not gonna give the whole summary. I'm 12, by the way, so if the narrative in the perspective of a 15 yo. old isn't great, just say. I'm not quite sure how to write a love story about a 12 yo. so... Yeah.      Chapter One: The Market Place      I woke up to my grandfather’s voice. He was yelling at me to get out of my cot and get ready. We were going to the market today. I always kind of hated the market because we livid in the Irish ghetto and everyone there always had really thick accents. It was so hard to understand them. The slang that they used was very different to the type that I had grew up with in Georgia, but we had to move to Brooklyn in hope of a new and bright future in the city. Oh, how I missed the country, but we couldn’t survive there. The city was an oppurtunity like no other for a not necessarily a good life. A life that we had enough money to live, eat, and drink.   A friend of my grandfather’s had very generously given us the store and our home. The store was downstairs and we lived upstairs. It wasn’t the greatest place, but it was much better than one of those tenements that all those immigrants live in. We would probably be off the same way if it weren’t for him.    Call me na?ve if you like, but I never quite understood why all these immigrants were coming to America and taking American jobs. They were filling up the city. I don’t have much problems with the immigrants, but I don’t really understand. They don’t seem too happy here, anyway, with all the racist people here that want them to go back to their own country. Some people are just cruel to them and always takikng advantage of them. We need to treat them like how we want to be treated. Isn’t that God’s greatest commandment, anyway? Love your neighbor as you love yourself. Or something like that. It has been awhile since I had read it. Two years ago, I think. I left it in Georgia by accident.   “Beatrice! Are you ready yet?” my Grandfather asked from outside my door.   I realized I haven’t even got up. “Um… Just almost. You need to give a lady a minute!” I replied and jumped of my cot.

Give me your hand and I’ll lead the way just tell me you’re here to stay. Baby please…I’m down here begging on my knees. Can’t we just run and never look back?
20090220201554AATgb4i	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	So heres another poem/story. tell me if its good Warning very dark!?	Contemplating taking this blade and tearing flesh bone. Taking it deep into my soul. Puncturing my heart and letting all my feelings go. Sitting in this puddle of blood. Seeing visions of scarlet red. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME INSIDE MY HEAD! Voices screaming DO IT, tearing at my brain SLIT YOUR WRISTS…COME ON YOU ENJOY THE PAIN! Demons swirling in my visions beckoning me to join them. The man in red whispering in my ear “Come my son relinquish to me your soul to me and we will be one.” Falling down into the black abyss. Why did I let my life come to this?   This suicidal romance I have with this blade. I cry and it conforts me. Slicing flesh from bone. Leading the way into the dark. Draining my blood. Draining my pain out onto the floor. I follow the man in red down the long corridor…screams and moans coming out of every door. He leads me to my doom. I walk into my cage. The dead bodies with the heads of all my fears are clawing at my back. I faint on the floor. I wake as I see my reflection in the blade. My face…my eyes I’ve changed…. I’ve become the man in red. I take the blade and slice away what isn’t there. My eyes rolling past me on the floor I scream as I awake. I’m back in the corridor. Stuck forever to relive all my sins…. Dream all my fears. The man in red is back along with a man in black. He whispers to me in his evil tongue. You my son will spend the rest of eternity with ME! YOU CANNOT CONTROL ME I SCREAM. I rip at the bars…clawing with fangs that aren’t there. He takes his weapon of death, and tears a whole in my chest. Holding my still beating heart in his boney hand he screams YOU WILL OBEY MY EVERY DEMAND! I can’t see his face his cloak hides it. He goes and sits in the corner. As he is looking down holding his scythe in one hand and my heart in the other. I hear the others screaming bloody murder. I find my blade…my lover. I cut away my soul. The man in red can’t have what doesn’t exist. As I see myself float away. The man in black stands up and screams. I AM THE KEEPER OF SOULS! As he fly’s over me to catch it I grab his cloak and pull him down. I take his scythe and relinquish him of his crown. NOW I AM THE KEEPER OF SOULS I scream. I put on my cloak, and take my scythe. The man in red returns, and I give him the reapers soul. THAT WAS VERY BOLD BUT NOW YOU WILL FEEL YOUR BLOOD TURN COLD AS YOU DECEND INTO DARKNESS! He screams. I accept my fate as the keeper of souls. I wake up and see my lover once again. She is scarlet with my blood

20090220193544AAy7qHj	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would you read this book?	This is just the beginning, and it hasn't been edited.  It is supposed to be Cinderella-ish.  Thanks for reading!      Prologue          Whispering.  Mayhem.  Madness. Despair.  Within Hours everyone in town knew what had happened. They would whisper about how the poor girl was Left motherless and alone, with only a crazy old father to watch over her. They would talk about her father, how his madness would force her to run away.    Rumors would continue on about this family, the whisperings never stopping, fingers pointing in her direction wherever she went.    “The ol’ man went an’ got ‘imself a wife.  I bet she only married ‘im cause she wanted ‘is money.”          “The girl’s father is gettin’ sick.  ‘opefully ‘e’ll die soon, and leave the poor girl to ‘erself.”    The rumors continued on about the same family until the old man died, and then, they only became worse.       Chapter 1        I don’t recall ever feeling less wanted, or loved, or useful in my life.  But, I can tell you this; I certainly don’t need a prince on a brilliantly white horse, or with a charming smile to save me from my sorrows.  I’m an independent woman, with values, and morals, and an independent record to keep straight.  Never in my life have I needed a man.  Not once.  And I don’t see that changing anytime soon.    “Cinderella!” That was my stepmother, more like slave driver, but still stepmother nonetheless, calling me to do whatever evil deed she thought of next.  She considered me as her personal servant, who deserved nothing in return for all my hard work.    “CINDERELLA!  Now!”  Oh, by the way, my name really isn’t Cinderella; it’s Joelle Abigale Emerson. My stepsisters had given me the name Cinderella after they had forced me to crawl up the chimney to fetch a nonexistent ball they had “gotten stuck” up there.  When I came back down, I was covered in cinders, and lo and behold, my forever-permanent nickname was formed.    As I walked down the stairs to see what my Stepmother wanted, I felt a pair of cold eyes staring right through me.  Of course I had taken too long getting down the stairs.  I always did.  You’d think she’d be used to it by now…    “Cinderella, when I call, I expect you to come immediately.  Do you understand?”    “Yes.”    “Yes What?”    “Yes, ma’am” At first, she had wanted me to call her ‘mother’, but that was when my dad was still alive.  In other words, it was only for show.  Now she didn’t care what I called her, as long as it showed that she was socially higher ranking than I was.  Figures.  But behind her back, I just called her ‘the witch.”
20090220195054AAsXCh4	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would you read this story... part 3?	Part 1:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       Part 2: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...          Thank you!      “Thanks… I can’t stand everyone following me everywhere I go! It just… sorry, I don’t even know who you are.”    “No problem.  I’d rather hear your problems than mull over mine.”  I looked at the prince, then remembered what Bessie had said.  He was quite handsome.  He was unusually tall for his age, with warm brown, slightly tousled hair.  It was hanging a little past his ears.  He was dressed in a fashion so expensive I couldn’t dream of looking at it, much less wearing it.  But even with his hair, height, perfect face, everything, the thing that really captured me were his eyes.  They were a bright gold color with flecks of green and brown in them.  I couldn’t seem to take my eyes off of them.    I realized that he had said something to me, and was looking at me expectantly, thinking I would produce some type of answer.    I wasn’t about to say, ‘Sorry, could you repeat that, I was lost in your eyes,’ so I just nodded and hoped I wasn’t agreeing to something strange.  He looked relieved, so I guessed that I was safe.    “I just don’t see why I have to go through with it.” Huh?    “you shouldn’t have to.”  Please let that be okay… PLEASE!    “You’re right.  Thanks for your help.  I’m going to stop this right now.”  And off he walked, leaving me desperately hoping that he wasn’t going to hurt himself or do anything stupid.  Some guys were just like that sometimes.    “Cinderella!  You know mother hates when you wander off like this!  Come, we almost had to actually carry our own bags.  You know how that is on us.”    “Yes, yes, I’m coming.”    “Well, hurry up.”    I shopped for another few hours, no really, I should say, pushed around, carrying everything that was purchased that day.  Over the years, I had built up some serious muscles.    Home was the same old story, and so was company over for dinner.  I was the servant girl, who was totally non-related, and my evil Stepmother was Glinda the Good Witch, emphasis on witch.    As I walked up to my room that night, I thought of the Prince’s eyes, how deep they were, and almost as if they had much too large of a burden placed on them.    “Cinderella!  Where is my tea?”  I wished that I could ignore her, but unfortunately, I would only hate life worse if I did.    When I was finally able to go to sleep that night, I fell into my bed, asleep before my head touched the hard lumpy pillow.

20090220193708AAMxyd8	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	First part of my chapter?	I was at school singing along with my iPod (and scratching this persistent itch I've had since this morning), when I heard something different from the song I was listening to.     "Hi Lillian!"       I heard the voice of my familiar brunette haired friend Gracie Rein call out to me. Today was the anniversary that marked us being best friends for a total of nine years now. I saw she was holding a similar wrapped package like the one I was holding in my hands. We were just so much alike.      "Hey Gracie!" I shouted giving her a smile."Happy anniversary!" I said while giving her a big hug.       "Aah, I can't believe it's already been nine years!" She exclaimed. "I mean, I remember just like it was yesterday when I first met you."      "I know what you mean." I said truthfully.      It really did just seem like yesterday when we first came into each other's life. I had just finished begging my mom and dad to not make me go to school. I wouldn't know anyone there. (Besides, they said I wasn't supposed to talk to strangers anyways.) Mrs. Palmer was trying to calm me down by giving me the "Everything will be okay, you're going to make lots of friends here." talk that teachers always give scared, little kids that are afraid of rejection.       "Why don't we find you a seat?" she asked in a sweet voice. "Hm, how about you sit right here with Gracie, okay?" she asked.       "Okay." I said looking up at her.       "Great!" she said smiling brightly. "I'm going to leave you two to get to know each other. I'm sure you two will become the best of friends." she said while walking to another student who seemed to having it worse than I was.       You know, looking back now, I don't think I would have ever met Gracie without the help of Mrs. Palmer.       "So Lillian," Gracie started bringing me out of my thoughts. "Is that package, that looks strangely like a wrapped present, for me by any chance?" she asked while pointing at the object I was holding in my arms, while one of my hands was busy scratching the other.      "Only if the package that looks like a strangely wrapped present in your hands if is for me." I said eyeing the gift in her hands.       "Oh you know it is!" she said while we handed each other our anniversary gifts.       I started unwrapping the paper to find a brown cardboard box. I took the lid of, and inside I saw a beautiful picture frame that had a picture of Gracie and me that we took last summer while visiting my aunt and uncle in California. It was also the very same thing that I had gotten her.       I felt tears coming to my eyes, and when I looked up, I could see that Gracie was already silently crying. She must have noticed that I was looking at her because she looked at me and gave me her humongous smile. It's times like this when we didn't need any words of thanks. We could just tell by the other's face just how thankful we were.       Just then, the bell rang letting us know that we had five minutes until our first class started. Advanced math was my first and most favorite class. Most of my friends had made it to advanced math, including Gracie, which I was especially happy about. Not to mention, I was pretty good at math even though I sometimes say I suck at it. (Also, I kinda had a crush on the teacher, he-he.)      "Come on," I said while wiping my eyes. "We'd better get going, we don't want to be late."       "Yeah right. I'm sure you're just anxious to see how good Mr. Ript looks today." She said winking. She was the only one who knew about my little crush. I wouldn't trust anyone with that information except her.       "True, true." I said nodding my head and winking back at her, while my fingers stretched out to scratch the itching one.       She laughed, and then her face got serious. "Do you remember if he said that page was for homework last night?"       "Nope. You'd know that if you'd paid attention in class." I said.      "Well some of us aren't as obsessed with what our teachers say like you are." she said rolling her eyes and smirking. "Come on, you don't want to be late for your date!" she yelled while running off.       "I am NOT obsessed!" I yelled. "And what do you mean by date?" I asked running after her to Mr. Rift's class.

20090220194654AArTfLM	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What is this book? I read it in school when I was little and always thought it sounded interesting.?	It's about a boy that lives in a city that is grey. Families are arranged, parents don't actually give birth to their children, that is the job of maternity women of some sort. Everyone has specific jobs, so there is no freedom of choice or anything. The boy starts seeing colors, first example being a red apple. He ends up becoming the apprentice or something to the man who keeps the memories of the past. I don't remember why, but the leaders were about to kill this little baby with blue eyes(which again is a big deal because everyone else sees grey). The boy decides to take the kid and run away with him on a bike I think. After that I just remember him going through many terrains, feeling weather that he had never felt before. I don't remember, if I ever knew what it was at all, the ending to the story.      Please, I neeeeeeed to know what this book is. It is bugging me so badly and I have always been intrigued by the story.      So the question is, does anyone know the name of this book?

It's a gift for my husband, he is 29 and have never played a guitar before (but really wants to learn).   He is not sure what kind of music he wants to play, probably something that is not as fast as rock.    One good thing we value about an electric guitar is that he can plug in the headphones and practice not disturbing others.    And if you recommend one type of a guitar, please, advise me also what brand to buy.       Thank you all so much!

20090220202056AADxcNm	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	First of all, i need feedback from someone who has good knowledge of the classic book les miserables?	i have to write an essay for extra credit because i have a c in the class. the essay has to be one of character analysis and i picked the most obvious one Jean Valjean. i need help writing it and overall on how to approach the book. I need help with paragraph structure and when you should use certain examples and details without ruining what you're trying to say. it's tough to put in words. I actually wrote thte introductory paragraph and it goes:      Though initally Jean Valjean realizes society may not accept him for who he really he is, eventually his hope and determination mostly withstand his external conflicts. Society can be harsh, but its also (in Jean Valjean's case) an indicator of what's right and wrong. When Jean Valjean was depicted as a criminal and as unhuman, he absorbed all this negativity and showed he could be much more than what his destiny had allowed him to be, because of the fact that he changed and became somewhat of a positive influence upon those who were once like him and even those who weren't. Therefore, my analysis will be on Jean Valjean's various reactions to negative influence from society, and also his positive feedback from who were once his internal antagonists (society).

20090220202348AAzE6YC	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of this start for my novel?	There are only things three things a human needs to survive - food, water, and dreams.       Some would beg to differ, but this isn’t about them now, is it? No, instead, this is about a girl. A girl who liked white rabbits, top hats, and at times - Cheshire grins. A girl lost in her own illusions and imagination. This story is about a girl, ironically, named Alice.       ------      Boredom is a very bad happening when dealing with Life. Literally.       I spent day in and day out plucking souls from their weave, and then dropping them carefully into their place within the world. The bright blues of spirits swirling to fuse with an embryo, thus becoming a being. This is not as easy as it sounds though, soul placement happens to be a very tricky process.       I’m going to clear up one silly misconception that you humans seem to carry. A soul is not just there to wonder on the earth. A soul is to have a purpose. Each purpose of every soul intertwining so delicately that it is almost too hard to find where the threads lie anymore.       It was my job to place those threads. Yes, it is entertaining to place a spirit in the world and then watch what they make of themselves with other characters set alongside them. Shakespeare for example - a brilliant man set in the world to inspire others with his work, but . . .  He wouldn‘t have been able to write the things he did without his wife, Anne Hathaway.       So you see, everybody has a purpose. Even it is to inspire the one who inspired millions.       However, to do this from the very beginning became boring. So I did something I never should’ve done.       I reached into the weave and began to juggle three souls.       It was then that Fate happened.       My sister, Fate, barged in, acting like the borderline lunatic she always had been. When asked why she had been bought into existence the Creator only said she bought a certain spontaneity that lightened  things around the universe. I just thought there was something wrong with Fate.       Her ’spontaneity’ caused me to drop the souls. I managed to catch two, but somehow one inconspicuously escaped my grasp. I watched in horror as it slowly tumbled to the earth in the maddening hues of bright blue and wisp.       For the first time in my history, the history of Life, a soul was not meant to be.

20090220203519AAlU7oX	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Working on a fable and i need someone to please revise this?	There was a forest where a werewolf lived and didn’t have any friends. The werewolf wasn’t mean, but the creatures that lived around him still bullied him anyways. He didn’t really understand why the creatures insulted him only because he was a werewolf. Until it got to the point of moving somewhere more civilized. Days before moving out to a nice village just outside the forest he met a fox who was going to live where he lived. The fox asked why he was leaving from the pleasant forest and the unwelcomed werewolf told him about how he was mistreated. Although the fox didn’t really know the werewolf well he knew it was still wrong to treat the werewolf so rough. After the werewolf’s departure the fox moved in the wooden cabinet. The fox wanted to do something about the injustice that his new neighbors did to the poor werewolf. So the fox decided to go early in morning to see his new acquaintances and tell them that it was incorrect to treat a creature without knowing them. Although this set a bad expression to the rudely neighbors, but the fox was standing up for what he believed in.             Okay so the lesson is supposed to be: No matter what you'll always have someone to right besides you...."bully"

20090203091615AAN1UDt	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	If you could change one thing about your favourite book, what would it be and why?	My favourite book at the moment is Twilight, and if I could change one thing, it would probably be Bella falling in love with Jacob. I would make it so she just became friends with him, but it never went further. Or maybe I'd change it's success, so there'd be less haters and stuff. Haters bug me.      Another of my favourite books is The Book of Dead Days. If I could change that, I'd probably give the character Boy a real name. I always thought it'd be better if he was called Graysen for some reason.      What about you?
20090203092047AA1W9aF	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Can you help me with my story plot?	warning - long question follows.      Originally, the plot for the side-project story I'm writing was going to be this:   Years ago, the Cruenti (a race of blood-sucking parasites evolved from humans) and a human activist group, the Restorers, were wiped out during a war against each other. Somehow, in amongst this war, a Cruentus and a Restorer found love and produced a half-Cruentus-half-Human baby girl, Hero. Hero Laker grows up with her human grandmother, Cross, after her parents die. Cross was a Restorer in her youth, and had a chip implanted in her which enabled her to seek out and pinpoint Cruenti. 17 years after the war ended, Cross tells Hero that she knows there are still many Cruenti in hiding, and she is sure that they are plotting revenge. Cross instructs Hero to get close to a Cruentus boy at her school, Broden Huntre, to find out where the Cruentus are and put a stop to them. Hero begins to use Broden to her advantage, but they form an unlikely friendship and this begins to cause problems, as Hero has to decide whether she should stop using Broden, tell him the truth and risk losing him, or carry on using him, not tell him the truth and risk losing him.      But that idea didn't go to well. I change it up a bit so that Hero was completely human, Broden knew her story, and they were not seeking hidden Cruenti, but rather looking for an item which the Cruenti and the Restorers were fighting over. While I was doing a little bit of character profiling, I dreamed up some Cruentus characters [Holden, Arbor, Aspen, Winter and Ember] which I grew attached to. In order to use them in my story, I decided I had to change it up again. I made all the Cruentus characters into a family [Holden = father, Arbor = mother, Aspen = eldest son, Winter = eldest daughter, Broden = youngest son/protagonist, Ember = youngest daughter].      I was, at last, content. Until, of course, I realised that my plot was weak.      Can you help me think up the basis of a new plot, please?      Basically, I want these things to stay the same.   - The Huntre family [Holden, Arbor, Aspen, Winter, Broden and Ember]   - Hero being the descendent of a Restorer.   - A war having taken place between Restorers and Cruenti many years ago.   -Hero and Broden coming together at some point for a good reason      I really don't want to let go of my characters, so I would like to have a new plot to write them into.   Thanks so much =]         *All concepts ? S.A.Laker-Gray & The GBW Guild

Okay this is what I need to do for a song or "piece"(for all you Politically Correct people.)      With my left hand I need to play the g# note on one octave() and then play the g# minor chord on an octave higher. then I need to go back to the 1st octave to play the d# note and then play the d# major chord on the higher octave but the thing is I keep missing especially on the g# minor chord.      the way I play them is that I play the middle note with my thumb, the 3rd note with the index finger and the 1st note with my pinky finger. should I do that or use a different fingering method to play those chords? if it helps this is sort of what Im talking about    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm0R6djB7...       go to 1:14 and look at how the hand jumps from one octave to the next. this is what I want to do for the piece Im playing.

I do not stay on the exterior for long; however, I soon submerge into the waves. The force of the impact pushes me in all directions.  I become soaked with knowledge, inspiration, fear, anticipation, and much more.  From this, I have learned to follow my own tide.       3rd:   She begins her journey ashore.  Not knowing who she is, she watches as waves of ideas, wonders, experiences, and discoveries surge past her.  Stepping closer to the water, her gaze shifts down to the figure below.  The face blurry, but somehow familiar, makes her stagger forward.   She plunges into the water, the sudden impact pushing her in all directions.  She becomes soaked with knowledge, inspiration, fear, anticipation, and much more. From this, she—or rather, I have learned to follow my own tide.

20090220212052AAgpaXA	Arts & Humanities;Other - Arts & Humanities	How do I know I love music and I want to pursue a career in it? Scared HELP !!?	since i was small i loved music. connected with music, one with music. im having serious debates with myself whether i want to pursue a career in the Music industry or the criminal justice field. I think I love law and protecting people for a living would be extradonary but if I dont chose Music I'll wonder what it could have been my whole live. Should I risk it? I just dont want to waste time, money, most importantly life for something i am NOT in love with . I am not sure if i have a passion for music or if i want to so bad because there is no one else i can turn to for support. Am I forcin myself to like music I dont know but I feel so DEEP intertwined with music. I love it. When I listen to Music the sound of a piano and guitar makes everything in me shutters. when I get in my vulnerable mood I can write poetry forever to express myself. Music puts me in a place i cant explain. I often compare myself to other artist and find I am very similar personality wize. I am very insecure and find my self often thinking are you serious you think you can make it as an artist and I almost laugh at myself. when im in the mood nothing could shift my mind from beliveing I belong to the public. I belong there because ive never belinged to anything or anyone else. Should I try and pursue My music?
20090220212522AAOb6zw	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	What could possibly be wrong with my guitar amp?	This seems to happen only when I bring my amp in the house in my room. Most of the time I keep it in the garage. My amp is a Marshall MG250DFX.      Anyways, I begin playing my guitar everything is well. Then I begin tapping my foot to the rhythm of the music (like the tempo i guess).    Now when I do a big stomp, my amp gets louder like it moves 3 volume steps up.      For example, when I play it at Master Volume 2. Then I stomp and it's as if I were to move it at level 5 when it really is at 2... and when I move it at level 0 it's as if I would have it at volume 3. The only way to bring the volume back down is disconnecting the cable from my guitar.      I mean more volume is cool. But maybe there is loose wiring. WTF?

20090220204516AAjfLMB	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Essay help, please!!?	Critique, please! Make any necassary changes.           The story of Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester may not be completely realistic, but it certainly should NOT be regarded as a fairy tale. My main argument against this common misconception is just this: the characters are portrayed as human and fallible. In the first place, Mr. Rochester is no prince and is hardly ever charming. For the most part, he is arrogant and rude. In my opinion, this is partly the result of his upbringing and also because of his nature. For , he had the examples of his father and elder brother. All we know of them is that they cared enough about bringing money into the family to manipulate Edward into marrying a mad woman. Also, because he came from a privileged family, he was used to his word being law.           After he reconizes Bertha for the monster that she is, he is driven by desperation to "" all the world's pleasures. We are provided an example of this in the realtionship with Celine Varons. He relates the particulars of this    relationship to Jane in reference to Adelle, his ward and alleged daughter. He does not believe she is paternally related to him, but takes her on regardless. This shows  "" on his part. The relationship with Celine Varons was like many others; it ended badly.            Edward also shows decietfulness in not informing Jane directly of his past and present entanglements. His reason for keeping the truth of his _ marriage was that he feared she would not consent to being    committed to him. Perhaps, another reason for this discretion was he did not want to spoil her innocence. That is what she represented to him - innocence. I think in some ways, she reminded him of himself    before he went down the wrong path.               We are presented with yet another of Edward's faults when Jane talks of leaving him after the knowledge of his existing marriage is made clear to her.He goes so far as to warn her of his short temper: "Jane, I am not a gentle tempered man--you forget that: I am not long enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate. Out of pity to me and yourself , put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and-- beware!" I am certain he would    never actually harm her. In fact, he says himself: "I could bend her her with my finger and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed her?"..."WhateverI do with it's cage, I cannot get at it-- the savage beautiful creature! If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only let the captive loose. Conquerer I might be of the house; but the inmate will escape to heaven before I can call myself the possessor of it's clay dwelling place."           Edward is not the only one with imperfections. Jane has faults of her own. For one, she allowed herself to be influenced by her dismal life. Before making Thornfield her home, she was forced to live among family who resented and continually persecuted her. She was ,then,    thrust into a bad living environment in the form of Lowood School. Before Rochester, she had but one friend in the world who was taken from her by an epidemic at the school. Most everyone in her position would succomb to the same melancholy.            Jane also wavered many times in her resillution to leave Thornfield Hall and Mr. Rochester. She allowed herself to be tempted to a life of sin. In the end, though, her resillient character enabled her do what was right.            I love this story so much, because it NOT a fairytale. The story of Jane Eyre personifies and at times exaggerates what everyone feels and acts upon. It's a vivid representation of life ,both as it is and how it should be-  bad alongside good. It should not be coined a fairtale simply because it ends happily.

It worked fine however I wasn't very familiar with locking tuners so I messed with them and 3 of the strings came out.  So I went out to the store and bought a set of the same exact gauge strings and restringed my guitar but now my E string has a buzz on all the frets and so does my A and G string slightly.  I changed the strings one at a time and I cant quite figure out whats wrong.  The only thing I noticed was that my tremolo is sunk into the body and before I think it was parallel with the body but Im not sure and I don't know how to adjust it nor do I see why it would need readjusted because I didn't touch anything.  If anyone is good at this stuff any advice would be nice.

The air fell flat   I looked behind me   But I couldn’t go back      A squirrel fell down in front of me   And climbed my side so that I could see   The pleading look drawn on its face   It stayed there for a while   Not making a sound   And though it wanted me to turn around   I just set it down on the cool, damp ground   And whispered, “Scurry back”   It ran to where I was before   Making mournful glances here and there   But I couldn’t go back      A little longer   And snow came down   The trees went out of sight   Replaced by dampened light   I shivered some   And clapped my teeth   A large white wolf   Appeared by my side   It paced along quietly   With long, soft strides   I was glad to have   A somber friend      It wasn’t long   Before my skin   Was numb and red   And the warmth inside   Was drawing thin   I fell into a bank of snow   But before my senses drifted away   I felt a careful tug   The cold cut short my day      I woke to a pulsing fire   And a summer day’s sun   I was greeted by friends   I’d left behind   When I asked about   The quiet beast   That traveled by me the day before   The response was faces, facing down   And looking sadly o’er.      I stood beside the creatures form   Stroking its silky fur   I looked up   My vision clouded with a tear   And saw a warning sign   By the mouth of a road   I had walked down not so long ago.

20090220213815AAHzwal	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Could the big publishers be closed out or marginalized?	With digital reading now looking like the immediate future of the book industry are the big traditional publishers going to be able to stay on top?      Digital distribution of books will cut the overhead costs of publishing and distributing books drastically.  New publishers offering only digital prints will start popping up left and right, and there will inevitably be a new class of literary all stars who are strictly digital.  Will this increase in competition and talent diminish the long standing reign the big publishers have had over the industry?        Given, authors probably won't be able to make as much money, however with a lower overhead royalties will become significantly higher and that will appeal to a lot of high output, already-working-two-jobs writers, it is very conceivable that plenty of writers would jump ship to the new format.        What are your thoughts?        (Keep in mind that I'm not talking about tomorrow, but it will be much faster than people seem to be thinking.  Remember how quickly the iPod became the standard for personal music?)

20090220215855AAeqahy	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Clowning? Slapstick? Pratfalls?	This is probably one of the most random questions that have ever come to me, but after searching in vain for a few hours i figured i may as well come to my good and trusted friends at Yahoo! Answers. I have a tendency to become fascinated with the most random things, i am a bit eccentric (don't ask anyone i know, they'll say its an enormous understatement), but i have ALWAYS loved charlie chaplin, to the point of obsession, and buster and all my other slapstick legends, and would love to read up on the subject, but i can not, for the life of me, find a reliable site or suggestion on any books that might pertain to the finer points of Slapstick and physical humor, or to a lesser extent clowning, and just so you all dont think i am a complete airhead or something i am a criminology major, going into law school in a few years, this is just something i would like to add to my repertoire of trivia and odd talents, so if anyone  might know where to find a decent book or books on the subject (i.e. slapstick, pratfalls, physical comedy, etc.) please give me a heads up,       thanks so much all!

So, I tried my best to translate it,try to get as most of the feeling across as I could.      Last night you gave me a kiss   that kiss you would not give me   Because when I opened my little eyes   It was becoming day time      Because of your sight I don't sleep   what wouldn't I give,my entrails,for your kiss   I hold my wants for your caresses   For your body I die!      With your tears I will make for me   of clear water some "zarzillos"   and shoes of honey made with your delirium       Your kisses I will embroider    to my wild steering wheels       And with your blood I will paint spots   little spots on your dress      To know where you come from   No one has to be a fortune teller   It doesn't take more than to see the form of your dress      He has a forge in his eyes   Where my soul founds(sinks)   And a baggy iris eye   Were he spills it      My boy has in his eyes   Two prisoned stars   Two rose gardens on his face   Where it is always spring   Where I wait for the alba      Look how Flamenco you are    that singing "por bulerias"   Oh gypsy how my chest throbs   Singing "por bulerias"   Gypsy how my chest throbs
20090220214357AARJwtY	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Is this poem good? Constructive Criticism please?	I am submitting it to my college's literary magazine and I was wondering if i could get some constructive criticism. Here it is-      I took myself through forgotten wood   The silent breeze   It felt so good   An Owl was perched on marble rock   It stared at me with judging eyes   And showed no sign of any surprise   I quickened my pace to get away   But it just stood there   Watching me      I turned a corner   Down the path   The trees were dead here-   Natures Wrath.   The air fell flat   I looked behind me   But I couldn’t go back      A squirrel fell down in front of me   And climbed my side so that I could see   The pleading look drawn on its face   It stayed there for a while   Not making a sound   And though it wanted me to turn around   I just set it down on the cool, damp ground   And whispered, “Scurry back”   It ran to where I was before   Making mournful glances here and there   But I couldn’t go back      A little longer   And snow came down   The trees went out of sight   Replaced by dampened light   I shivered some   And clapped my teeth   A large white wolf   Appeared by my side   It paced along quietly   With long, soft strides   I was glad to have   A somber friend      It wasn’t long   Before my skin   Was numb and red   And the warmth inside   Was drawing thin   I fell into a bank of snow   But before my senses drifted away   I felt a careful tug   The cold cut short my day      I woke to a pulsing fire   And a summer day’s sun   I was greeted by friends   I’d left behind   When I asked about   The quiet beast   That traveled by me the day before   The response was faces, facing down   And looking sadly o’er.      I stood beside the creatures form   Stroking its silky fur   I looked up   My vision clouded with a tear   And saw a warning sign   By the mouth of a road   I had walked down not so long ago.

Basically, I have no idea, I think it is a bit of both, but I'm not sure at all.
