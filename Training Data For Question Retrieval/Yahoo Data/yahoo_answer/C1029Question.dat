Boy do I remember the hype around this guy. He dropped thirty points on some scrubs during some summer league one time. And so many experts and fans alike hyped him up like he was a superstar in the making. His name was often mentioned as a potential rookie of the year candidate. Look at him now! Struggling to get minutes over Steve Blake(lol) and Sergio Rodriguez(lolx2). The Blazers though they were getting their point guard of the future, instead what they got was an undersized shooting guard.      Jerryd Bayless=Fail!

How come I never hear about Tim Duncan anymore on Sportscenter updates and NBA on TNT. I'm sure he's scored at least 2 points this whole damn season, I'm sure he's dunked a basketball in a game at least once this whole damn season. I'd like to see more Duncan Highlights and less Lebron and Kobe show. LOL I don't care about slashers, I like my up and under, drop step, post spin move in the paint big men....and Tim Duncan is on that list. Hell, Dwight Howard isn't even getting enough sports publicity because of Kobe and Lebron. I'm getting tired of hearing about them two. There are other NBA all stars in this league not just those two. Every year neither one of them win, they're just passing time during the regular season is what I believe it is. Celtics or Spurs winning it this year. Put your money up! I'm also tired of everybody comparing Lebron James and Kobe Bryant to Michael Jordan. Even Michael Jordan said it himself, he was better than them in his prime. Michael Jordan is STILL the best at that position. He did it with weak, old a$$ Bill Cartwright on his team. So it's no excuse for Lebron not to have a title or Kobe.

20090306221834AAMmSTt	Sports;Football (Soccer);Other - Soccer	Spain's 2016 Olympics and 2018 World Cup bid harmed by racism?	Well what do you think Spain? Are you guys ready for all the different type of ethnic groups and races to come to your country without giving monkey chants and pulling your eyes back to look Chinese. I feel you guys are not ready for any of the events and none should be hosted in spain.. And i know most of your spaniards will come on here and say Oh spain is not racist, they were just having fun like you usually do so dont even to there.. I thought spain was a pretty bright and educated country but i'm think i may be wrong as spain is still living in the hitler time period or something..      MADRID (AP) -- Spain is a serious contender to host the 2016 Olympics and 2018 World Cup, but a failure to clamp down on fans' racist and extremist behavior could end up compromising both bids.      Buoyed by Rafael Nadal's Grand Slam tennis wins, the national football team's European Championship triumph and Alberto Contador's sweep of cycling's three premier events, Spain is in a golden age of sports.      It would seem the perfect time to land the two biggest sporting spectacles on earth.      But scenes of offensive fan behavior still tarnish the country's image, an issue that came to the fore when spectators at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium greeted England's black football players with monkey chants during a friendly in 2004.      And the problem extends to sports such as Formula One, where fans don't known when to differentiate between competitive spirit and racism.      "In Spain, there is a profound problem and the fight against racism hasn't been taken seriously. The problem is a lack of education and sensibility when it comes to tackling racism," Esteban Ibarra, head of the Movement Against Intolerance, told The Associated Press.      "The public would react positively to a campaign, but there is a real lack of political push in this fight."      Spain's friendly against England on Wednesday — the teams' first meeting since the events in the Spanish capital in November 2004 — comes at a crucial time.      It's a day before Madrid submits its documents to the International Olympic Committee outlining its bid plans for the 2016 Games, and a little over a week after Spain confirmed its joint bid with Portugal for the 2018 World Cup.      "It's going to be a great test to see if we've overcome that episode or if we're just continuing on with this problem," said Ibarra, who has been charting racial incidents for 20 years.      Monkey chants still rain down on players across the country, with Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o of Cameroon nearly quitting a game at Zaragoza in February 2006 because of the abuse.      "When I first experienced it, I didn't even hear it. It was reporters that brought it to my attention," said Julian De Guzman, a Canadian of Filipino-Jamaican heritage who plays for Deportivo La Coruna. "Then I was watching (a replay of) the game and I was like 'Wow.' It was pretty surprising and kind of disappointing.      "The fines are never enough. They're just a slap of the hand and they're back at it again. It doesn't really do anything."      Last month, Real Madrid was fined 3,000 euros ($3,900) after some fans displayed fascist banners, made gestures and chanted slogans with reference to the death of their opponents and the gas chamber.      The Spanish football federation said fines correspond to current laws, but preferred not to discuss the issue at length.      "In Spain, we take all preventive measures possible to fight racism," spokesman Jorge Carretero said. "I don't see any type of problem with racism in Spanish football. The same problems exist in England, in Germany, in France, and elsewhere."      Spain's bid with Portugal for the 2018 World Cup is up against competition from England, the United States, Russia, Japan, Australia and Netherlands-Belgium, among others. The host will be selected by FIFA in December 2010.      "There is no place in football for corruption and racism," FIFA said in a statement sent to the AP. "Football, given its global reach, power and influence has a duty to act in a responsible and progressive manner."      Spanish Olympic Committee president Alejandro Blanco doesn't believe recent events will bear any influence on Madrid's chances of hosting the 2016 Games, with Tokyo, Chicago and Rio de Janeiro also in the race. The IOC will choose the host city on Oct. 2.      "These things can happen in any stadium in any country in the world, from Brazil to Italy to anywhere," Blanco said. "It's too easy to just say that Spain is a racist country, when it is not."      The Spanish government passed a law against racism in sport in July 2007 in a bid to clamp down on the behavior, but experts say that it is not being used. Clubs can be fined up to $842,000 and deducted points, places and even relegated for serious incidents, but it's up to the league to enforce such punishments.

I'm not really good for the time i've been skating-my best trick is a varial or double kickflip. He always makes fun of my shoes being Nike 6.0's instead of him having Nike SB's, and many other annoyances. He always claims he can beat me in skate and he's serious about it. When he invited me to go somewhere for a skate session, I decided to play him in a game of skate. I just did an ollie, and he did the most stationary, sketchy, unbalanced, and low ollie i've ever seen, and he claims he's just not trying and going easy on me.When I did a shove-it, he randomly started telling jokes and going off the subject till I finally made him do one, and he didn't even get the rotation-he said he's just going easy on me. By the time he messed up on the shove, I had to go home, so I kind of suspect he's the poser, not me. He even randomly called me out of nowhere and told me he landed a backside casper-the casper that the board is on the ground laying upside down;he seemed really excited about it too. Am I the poser or is he the poser?

20090227060419AAAgJHP	Sports;Basketball	Bench rodney stuckey?	a lot of people are b*tching about whether to bench rip hamilton or A.I. or bullsh*t like that.   hamilton is an all-star. A.I. is a future hall of famer and MVP. who is stuckey?   if you're coach and you don't know how to incorporate a hall of famer into your offense, then you have some problems.   stuckey is absolutely horrible. he rarely gets on the line and is very passive on the court. (3.3 times per game. iverson 6.1 per game, 9.7 last year with denver) he showed flashes, but who doesn't have potential in the nba?   they say iverson isn't a point guard. well stuckey is not a traditional point guard either. cornerstone of the franchise? heck, i'd take randy foye over him. at least foye is a better shooter.   joe dumars and michael curry should go back to the basics. cut the crap about youth movement and put the 5 best players in the starting lineup.

Liverpool are the number one team in Europe, according to Uefa's co-efficient ranking system.     Wednesday's famous 1-0 victory over Real Madrid at the Bernabeu propelled the Reds to the top of the official Uefa table for the first time since 1985.         The complicated system ranks clubs on their performances in European competition over the past five years, with points being awarded for matches won and the standard of opposition.         Liverpool top the table with a score of 114.077 points, ahead of Premier League rivals Chelsea, who are in second with 110.077 points.         Arsenal (fifth) and Manchester United (seventh) are the other English teams who occupy a position in the top ten.         The Reds have also amassed the highest points total for the current season with a tally of 18.1775.         Bayern Munich are in second place, while La Liga clubs Barcelona and Atletico Madrid hold joint third position.         UEFA co-efficient rankings:         1 - Liverpool FC (114.077)    2 - Chelsea FC (110.077)    3 - Barcelona (109.403)    4 - AC Milan (109.306)    5 - Arsenal FC (101.077)    6 – Sevilla FC (100.403)    7 - Manchester Utd FC (99.077)    8 - Bayern Munich (93.664)    9 – Olympique Lyonnais (90.576)    10 - Inter Milan (87.306)

20090306231400AAeuLzF	Sports;Baseball	So what's your take on Manny Ramirez?	I don't know about everyone else, but I like Manny Ramirez alot.  Everything that happened in Boston is overblown I think.  The man wanted to leave and they didn't want him gone.  So  he dogged it to tell Epstein that he really didn't want to play there anymore.        Now that he's a Dodger I think that it is great for Baseball.  I also feel that many people want the Dodgers to lose just to show how all the talk was a let down.  Plus, everyone thinks that he'll do exactly what he did in Boston to the Dodgers.      I however don't think he will because Manny wants to prove to everyone that he isn't very predictable as some would think.      By the way, if any of you saw the ESPN interview with that one good looking lady who asked questions to Manny, what did you think about that interview?     I think he burnt her constantly on her simple Q's.      So what's your take on Ramirez?

Shahid have been too much inconsistent with his batting for last 3 yrs.      In last 2yrs he his batting average doesn't cross 20 also. Some people and former cricketer of pakistan  say that he was always selected for pakistan team as a bowler only.       Do u agree that shahid afrid always being selected for pak team in the past as a bowler only?      Even if he is selected as a bowler, do u think he can play the role of specialist or genuine spinner (like murlitharan or shane warne or harbhajan or any quality spinner) for pakistan team always?      Do u think pakistan selectors and team management had done a mistake by not dropping him on a correct time?      Do u think he can be consistent again on his batting in the future time being as he has done before earlier in a short period of time?      I don't know why afridi is still able to get a place in his team whereas there are other young talents in the pakistan who deserve the place in a team according to their domestic circuit performance.      Don't u think that instead of taking shahid afridi as a spin bowler, pak selectors should have given chance to some genuine spin bowler from their domestic circuit?      I just want to end up here, there are lots of reason which i feel afridi should have been dropped but i can't write now everything because it will be a very long story to describe.      I hope this will be a interesting question for everybody.                 GOOD BYE AND HAVE A GOOD DAY.

They don't play enough games and don't practice enough because of NCAA rules.  They finish when they are 22 and maybe sign with the MLS for no money.  Now they are 26 years old and they have no money and this still are not getting better.  The MLS is boring.  It is not like Europe.  The only way we are going to get better is if more players bypass college and go to Europe.  Somebody help with connections.  Look at Johnny O'brien and follow his model at Ajax.  He did it at age 15 and is one of the best Americans ever.  Something has to change.  College soccer doesn't work like the NBA and football.  It is not the training ground.

20090307115954AAofQtG	Sports;Swimming & Diving	How To Become A Better Swimmer And Catch Up?	Hello! This year, I decided to join the swim team for some apparent reason. Due to the fact that I had very little experience swimming, I sucked. I was a 13 year old swimming in a group with 8 and under year old. Besides the annoying kids, I also had to deal with my peers teasing me because I sucked and swam with 8 year olds. I knew that I would get embarrassed and come last, so I didn't go to any swim meets. The only time I have is a 54:00 on the 50 free when I first started. (I'm pretty sure I've improved considering all the conditions). My swim coaches ignored me because I didn't come to meets and didn't teach me anything. At the 8 and under group all we did was flipper/kick board drills, which were extremely easy. Next year I'm planning to join the swim team. I seriously need to become better. I want to move up to the advanced group (and keep up with them) with people my age and come in 4th (in a race with 6 people). For this I need to make up for years I've missed. So how can I become better and achieve what I stated (Said on the previous sentences)? I have about 7 months and can't be that dedicated to it because I'll be busy. Please be detailed and give a thorough answer.

20090307114605AAq4hSc	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	Pistol shooting stance question?	I am right handed, but do a lot of things backwards.  I also have noticed as I have gotten older that I am extremely left eye dominant.  When I shoot my pistol, I literally tilt my head at a 45' angle to use my left eye to shoot (both eyes open).  I recently read on a shooting forum about another guy who claims he's left eye dominant, and his brother in law (who's in law enforcement) told him to try shooting left handed.  He did and claimed until his strength failed him he was significantly more accurate.  For some reason I have never tried to shoot with my left hand. I guess it just feels awkward to me.  I was wondering if there was any truth to this claim.  I'm sure the next sunny day I get a chance to go out and shoot i will try it for myself but any more testimonies to this?      Also, if you have any other advice about proper technique i'd love to hear it.  Yes, I know how to line up my sights, but more info on stance, hold, and other intricacies would be nice.  I am a decent shot, i'd just like to be a better one.

Or, even better, anyone know a good place to get some open sights for the Gamo big cat?    (I have asked where to get open sights a few times, unfortunately all of the sites that were given to me don't specify which air rifle the sites work on). If anyone know a good gunsmith, or anyone/place that could add the open sights for me, that would be some nice info as well :).

I read a book called "Crossing Jordan" the main point of it wasn't running though.  I thought it was really good. Now i'm just looking for book about running.  I've been running my whole life ( i'm 16 years old.) Running is my lifestyle.  I run track in high school ( 400m, 4x400m relay.) I enjoy running just for fun, i don't care about winning.  I really would like to read some books about track and field or Running books in general.     thanks for the help.

Currently I throw very hard! hardest on the team and unless I'm in kind of a rush I throw off more often like maybe 30 percent of the time they are off.

Basically I just wanna know how to throw a hard accurate throw in all situations.

20090307143752AATiPLJ	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	How to buy a mosin nagant?	I am considering buying a mosin nagant. I am a huge fan of vintage firearms and I would really enjoy having one. I plan on collecting vintage firearms in the future. I want to buy the same type used in WWII or even better one that was actually used in the war! I want know everything i should know before buying one. I would mostly just take it to the range, and i dont plan on hunting anytime soon with it. also, what is the deal with the finnish version? like i said i would prefer a model that would have been or was used in WWII, but any info is greatly appreciated. one last thing; how big is the recoil of the gun and is the ammo relatively cheap and easy to obtain? i would like to take it to the range with my 14 year old son but he is a bit on the smaller side so he has the build of about an 11 year old and i would like to know how well he would handle it.

20090307145257AATsbIg	Sports;Cycling	Will I get in trouble for crossing a double yellow line to go around bikers?	Driving on a two-lane road (one going in each direction), there were bikers in my lane. Everyone else started going around them, so when the road was a straightaway (I waited until it wasn't curving), I sped up to go around by crossing the yellow lines. Just so happens that after I did that and safely returned to my lane, one of the cars going in the opposite direction was a cop! I'm a very safe driver, but it seemed safe when I did this, but will I get in trouble? He didn't put on his lights or come chase me or anything, but could he like take a picture of my license plate from the back of his car and send a ticket? Also, how much is that fine? I'm really scared!!   Oh I live in Georgia if that matters.

20090307145621AAWkNLl	Sports;Cycling	Should I change my raleigh mojave 2.0 mountain bike for a lamborghini forza?	Hello   I am just started into mountain bikes last summer and I have no idea about it. There is a chance for what looks to be an upgrade. This is selling my RALEIGH MOJAVE 2.0 to a friend and getting a LAMBORGHINI FORZA from some guy.  It looks like an upgrade given the fact that the lamborghini has disk brakes and other stuff but I may be wrong.       Please  let me know what you guys would do!
