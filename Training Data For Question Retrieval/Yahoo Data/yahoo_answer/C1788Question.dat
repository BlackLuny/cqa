20090128133201AAzTQYj	News & Events;Current Events	Isn't this so tragic?	8th Mich. Resident Dies From Harsh Weather    A Grand Rapids man is the eighth person in nine days to be found dead in the Michigan cold.      The body of 52-year-old Thomas Pauli was found this week in the snow at an auto salvage business in Grand Rapids.      Investigators are trying to determine the cause of death, but it doesn't appear to be suspicious.      The eight victims were found dead in the cold between Jan. 17 and Jan. 26, when Pauli's body was discovered. Four were older than 80.      The Grand Rapids Press reports seven of the eight victims were found outside. Many apparently fell on their own property and couldn't get up. Ninety-three-year-old Marvin Schur froze to death inside his Bay City home just days after the municipal power company restricted his use of electricity because of unpaid bills.

20090128133556AAoWR7J	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Working With the Media Where is the Reporter Coming From?	Reporters, their job is to get a good story!        http://www.studentsforbhopal.org/Media.h...         The below came from the above site and seems to be good info if we want to use the Media to get a good story fact point over to the public, which is what I am trying to do.        "Working With the Media Where is the Reporter Coming From?   Keep in mind that reporters have a job to do, and their job is to get a good story. They are not your friends and they know little, if anything, about your issue. They are under deadlines and often have multiple stories going at once, and they are under constant pressure from their editors. The media are businesses with the ultimate goal of selling papers and increasing their ratings, which place added constraints on reporters.Don’t let that intimidate you. You’re not going to lose anything by trying. If you’re not having any luck, be direct. Ask the reporter what it will take to get them to cover your story. They might tell you exactly what you need to do. And remember, reporters want to cover good stories, which are what you are providing."       If the below is true can President Obama work with the right legal system legally to fix it aright for good?       See my Profile for last question I ask. Some may be (gooder) at putting it together than I but over all the Media MIGHT find interest in the idea there just the same. You think?

We read that some people believe that part of the earths surface is reserved for them and them alone and they are entitled to re-habit it, forcing out the people who live there on the grounds that it was once promised to them by an unseen deity.      How does one go about obtaining a 'Promised Land' today, or are all the 'Promised Lands' already allocated to preferential peoples of a one time unseen deity ?

I am in journalism class at my high school, and wanted to write about something that I felt would matter in our high school. As I look all over the school in the halls, lunch and in my classes I see many different identity's form. Most students at my high school our preps and sports jocks. However, we do still have other types that need to be answered. We have hippies types, nerds, over achievers, smart asses and many more. Our school comes form smart honors students, that mom and dads spoil them and they don't even know it. What I am trying to do it is to start it. I can't even find a way to make this work for me.

20090128132956AAestGy	News & Events;Current Events	Is this a satisfactory response from the BBC on their refusal to broadcast the DEC Appeal for Gaza?	Their email response...    Thank you for your e-mail. We note your disappointment at our decision not to broadcast an appeal by the Disasters Emergency Committee to raise funds for Gaza. We decided not to broadcast the DEC's public appeal because we wished to avoid any risk of compromising public confidence in the BBC's impartiality in the context of covering a continuing news story where issues of responsibility for civilian suffering and distress are intrinsic to the story and remain highly contentious. We also could not be confident that the aid resulting from audience donations could reach those it was intended for at a time of a fragile ceasefire and sporadic border access. We will of course continue to report the humanitarian story in Gaza. The BBC's director-general Mark Thompson has therefore explained the decision in more detail in a number of television and radio broadcasts and online at our Editors' blog. Please follow the link to read his explanation in full: http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/20... Please be assured that we have registered your comments on our audience log. This is the internal report of audience feedback which we compile daily for all programme makers and commissioning executives within the BBC, and also their senior management. It ensures that your points, and all other comments we receive, are circulated and considered across the BBC. Once again, thank you for taking the time to contact us.  Regards BBC Complaints

Did the grandparents put new tile down in their backyard after Caylee was missing?      2.  Was there an original 911 tape in which Cindy spoke to Casey when she thought the 911 operator was transferring the call and said something to the effect of "We'll tell them you were south of here..." or something to this effect?      3.  Did the family know Caylee was dead before they reported her missing? Is that why Casey called her mother numerous times on a day around the time she may have died? (in other words did she drown in the pool? Casey calls mom...mom is a nurse...)      4. Did Casey go on a crime spree (checks) after she killed her daughter? Mad at her friends who went to Puerto Rico?      5. Did she chloroform her daughter to stage a kidnapping to get money from her own parents?      6. Do the jail house interviews looked staged to you?      What do you think happened in this case?

The Israeli army's chief rabbinate gave soldiers preparing to enter the Gaza Strip a booklet implying that all Palestinians are their mortal enemies and advising them that cruelty is sometimes a "good attribute".      The Israeli army rabbinate appears to be encouraging soldiers to disregard the international laws of war aimed at protecting civilians, according to Breaking the Silence, the group of Israeli ex-soldiers who disclosed its existence.      Do you think this rabbi should be fired for inciting lethal hatred as several groups are calling for?
