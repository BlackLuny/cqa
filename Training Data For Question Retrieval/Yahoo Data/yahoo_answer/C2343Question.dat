20090227074527AAgs5zy	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Please answer this poetry assignment if your going to say do your own homework or something then just dont ans?	Select a topic. Remember, a Haiku is about nature. Here is a list of possible ideas to get you started:       rain      sunshine      the four seasons (winter, summer, spring, fall)      flowers (a specific flower can be used)      insects (a specific insect can be used)      birds or other animals that can be found in nature -- not a pet      Brainstorm the ideas for that topic. Write down everything you know about the topic or everything the topic makes you feel.       Look for actions, verbs, and adjectives on your brainstorm list.      Write the first line of the poem -- count the syllables to make sure you have only 5.      Write the second line using only 7 syllables.      Write the third line, again, using only 5 syllables.      Read through the poem. If you are happy with it, try this again with a different topic from nature than you just used.       Look back over both poems and check your spelling.

20090305125953AADmmrd	Education & Reference;Quotations	Can someone explain this quote by Aristole to me? What is he saying in layman's terms?	Nicomachean Ethics 18/1103a15-26      “Virtue, then, is of two sorts, virtue of thought and virtue of character. Virtue of thought arises and grows mostly from teaching; that is why it needs experience and time. Virtue of character [i.e., of ethos] results from habit [ethos]; hence its name is ‘ethical’, slightly varied form ‘ethos.’    Hence it is also clear that none of the virtues of character arise from us naturally. For if something is by nature in one condition, habituation cannot bring it into another condition. A stone, for instance, by nature moves downwards, and habituation could not make it move upwards, not even if you threw it up ten thousand times to habituate it; nor could habituation make fire move downwards, or bring anything that is by nature in one condition into another condition. And so the virtues arise in us neither by nature nor against nature. Rather, we are by nature able to acquire them, and we are completed through habit.”

My Romeo And Juliet questions are:   who said this quote?: "Thursday will be a wonderful day. He (Paris) has said yes. All I hoped for will come to pass. It will be a suitable match. Juliet will make a good wife."    "Will this city ever be at peace? Those two dreadful famlies have been fighting again, and I've told them I'll have no more of it."    The next questions about Romeo And Juliet are not quotes.      Which character first persuades Romeo to attend the feast? (the party, where Romeo meets Juliet.)    What, at first does Juliet claim that Romeo hears the morning after their wedding night?   To what does Romeo first compare Juliet during the balcony scene?    Who is the young cousin who tells of Juliet's "death"?      Now, these are the Biology questions:   What happens to the volume of someones chest when they inhale?   How does oxygen that someone breathes in with the air get into their blood?   What does the epiglottis do when someone inhales?   What happens to ribs when they exhale?

20081105134818AAnGjA6	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Has this happened at your school?	I go to a county middle school, meaning there aren't any gangs or anything, and most of the kids are well-behaved. BUT, a few days ago, this kid had a knife in the pocket of the hoodie he was wearing. He didn't do anything with it or threaten anybody. Now, we aren't allowed to wear sweatshirts at all during school. I am so angry! Our school is SO cold, plus I have a lot of cute sweatshirts.  We're allowed to wear sweaters, but do they expect us to go out and buy sweaters just because of one stupid kid?       You know what else? You can fit a weapon anywhere. You can fit a pack of cigarettes in a pants pocket. You can fit a small knife or gun in your bra. You could hide a gun in a binder. What's next? No pants with pockets? No bras? No BINDERS?      I feel this is going a little too far.      So, my question is- has this or something similar happened at your school? Also, do you think schools are going too far?

As a whole, these tissues are vital to the overall functions of an organism. For example, in the bladder, connective tissue is used to connect transitional epithelium to the lining of the bladder, where it works with smooth muscle tissue to expand and contract based on the information that is sent to the organ by the nervous tissue.

American Hero; tall, bold and strong,   Proudly listening to his country’s song.   At only seventeen, he made a choice,   By listening to his inner voice.   Through hard work and determination,   He soon begins to defend his nation.   Personal sacrifice is day-to-day,   He wouldn’t have it any other way.   Consumed with tears and fears, he boards a plane,   The flight over seas will be a huge drain.   He boards the flight and hears the engine roar,   As he sets off on his first Iraq tour.   With hot, humid days, and cold lonely nights,   The haunting drams, he is learning to fight.   Being far away from family and friends,   Makes him want the war to come to an end.   Our letters and cards help him remember,   His family and friends that will leave him never.   When he comes home, and hears all of our cheers,   He’ll feel at peace for the first time in years.

20081030121218AAkOqmi	Education & Reference;Teaching	Can ANYONE be a teacher?	My sister-in-law is working on her bachelor's in education, but she has absolutely no grasp of the English language! I've read her blogs, and she refuses to punctuate, frequently spells and uses words incorrectly, has no concept of proper grammar, and sometimes makes absolutely no sense! She is barely scraping by in her classes, but she'll pass.      I'd hate to see her blow all of my brother's hard-earned money on online school if she won't be able to get a job, but I find it disturbing that there's a possibility she would be able to TEACH someone.      Aside from background checks, is it possible that anyone with a teaching degree can just go out and get a teaching job? Do they not have some sort of competency test before letting you educate our future leaders?

20080210093706AAO1KxY	Education & Reference;Teaching	Est-il vrai qu'en Allemagne, les enseignants sont moins autoritaires et que pourtant cela se passe très bien ?	Voilà ce qu'on entend, dans la bouche de pédagos et de 68tards échevelés, depuis l'affaire de la gifle sur un sale gamin de gendarme.      Alors, c'est vrai ou pas ?      J'ai pour l'instant de bonnes raisons d'en douter : en général, les jeunes profs pensent qu'ils seront moins autoritaires que leurs a?nes. Ils essaient, leur première année, de changer les rapports prof-élèves.      Mais ?a ne marche pas : les gamins en profitent et ?a devient très vite un bordel absolument ingérable dans la classe, et en général c'est irrécupérable. Le jeune prof alors est obligé, l'année suivante, de devenir autoritaire et surtout de le faire dès le début de l'année (sinon c'est foutu).      le mythe des pays du Nord ayant dépassé cet autoritarisme m'a aussi été démenti par une prof danoise, m'expliquant qu'en réalité ?a ne marche du tout pas là-bas : c'est tellement le bordel que l'on a généralisé la présence d'une deuxième personne dans la classe.

20081120113130AAlVBN2	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Is the word "incidences" ever correct?	I almost only ever hear the word "incidences" in use in TV and radio reports in circumstances where I think that the word "incidents" would be more appropriate.      For example,  "there were 25 indicences of murder in the county last year" sounds incorrect to me.      "There were 25 incidents of murder last year" is both shorter, easier to say, cleaner and seems more correct to me - but I am not a grammarian and can't quite put my finger on why.      It seems to me that the word "incidence" - can be fairly used - but "incidences" should nearly always be changed to "incidents."      For example, "there is a high incidence of murder in this county - last year, for example, there were 25 incidents of murder."      Agree or disagree?   Comments?   I am curious as to what others think about this.   Thanks.   Or am I the only one who notices?   Or am I just in the wrong on this one?

En décembre 1991, la Commission européenne publiait un mémorandum sur l'enseignement supérieur. Elle y recommandait aux universités de se comporter comme des entreprises soumises aux règles du marché. Le même document exprimait le voeu que les étudiants fussent traités comme des clients, incités non à apprendre mais à consommer.    Les cours devenaient ainsi des produits, les termes ?étudiants?, ?études?, laissant place à des expressions mieux appropriées à la nouvelle orientation: ?capital humain?, ? marché du travail?.    En septembre 1993, la même Commission récidive avec un Livre vert sur la dimension européenne de l'éducation. Elle y précise qu'il faut, dès la maternelle, former des ? ressources humaines pour les besoins exclusifs de l'industrie? et favoriser ?une plus grande adaptabilité des comportements de manière à répondre à la demande du marché de la main-d'oeuvre?.

20081011133128AAAO4qD	Education & Reference;Trivia	Can someone settle this argument!!!.. Mahler? or who?	In the film, "Death in Venice", main character, played by Dirk Bogard, was the main character meant to be Mahler?  Reading in Wikipedia, it says that Visconti (director) changed the original character of the story from an author (some guy residing in a hotel in venice who fancies a teenage boy there with his family) to Mahler?  Was the film then based on Mahler (Visconti according to Wiki used Mahler's music for the film).  Incidentally, what's good'n juicy if one wants to listen to Mahler?  I know he's meant to be 'good' but don't know what to listen to.

Select one of the first four arguments we studied in class (jefferson, Stanton, Wollstonecraft, or Woolf) and make a case for which is the "best" argument.
