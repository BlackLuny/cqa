9Qf4khqLaa	The store manager is in charge of the entire store, all the departments. Associate manager is basically a store manager in training, they can be paid less during the meantime, but they are consistently learning store manager duties, they may also take on special projects. The Assistant manager is generally the manager on duty, they may lead lower level management such as supervisors. A key holder is someone who basically has keys for the store. They know the opening and closing procedures, they handle the cash, they may be in charge of a small number of people. They're also in charge of pushing sales, making sure daily goals are achieved. 1st, 2nd and 3rd key holders are basically the rank, so if i was the 3rd there would be 2 above me.|`|8cN4e8Vmaa	THe store manager is the big chahuna, the accociate manager  is right beneath the store manager just about the same but not quiet yet, the assistant manager does the store managers dirty job, and a keyholder...idk?
wvDh3PdFaa	yap i am a registered nurse i spent my married  life working as a nurse. and im glad my 4 children they are about to finish their school just because of my job as a nurse.my salary is just enough to support my family .and to meet standard of living that  i wanted|`|3cBeyNWxaa	I'm not really a nurse but my mom and brother is one and I'm currently studying for nursing and hope to get by next year. <br>  <br>  To answer your question, my mom is in the medical-surgical department and she loves working there. She describes her work as going into her patient's room, introduce herself, and start assisting the patient according to his/her needs. This assisting may even go as far as assisting the patient wipe her/her own poop! But that's just because the CNA working with her is too lazy (she gets angry with them all the time). This is one of the downside of nursing though. <br>  <br>  She also describes her work as being stressful enough to deal with all the paperworks (assessments and such) without the (sometimes) demaning patients who views nurses as petty servants. And yes too, she has to keep standing most of the time but she gets several minutes off from standing when doing the paperworks and having a nice break.<br>  <br>  For my mom's salaries (she's a BSN), even though the average salaries posted in the internet is somewhere between the $40-60,000 yearly, my mom made something from around $80-90,000 a year. Last year she made $92,000. All these from $40/hour + little overtime, night differential, weekend differential. Don't ask me how she got to the 90's but she did, it even surprised me from time to time and doesn't get too much stressed from work when she gets home as well as many of her nurse friends. My family and several other nursing families can even find some time together to visit places far from their workplace. <br>  <br>  For me, I wouldn't stick with nursing after I finish my degree. I'd go straight ahead for advance practices or degrees (like CRNA,RNFA, NP) and I'm seriously even considering a career in medicine. I just don't want to be stuck forever in basic nursing, but that's just me.

AA11284831	I assume that you're asking about the mortgage interest deduction on Schedule A.  Interest on a principal and second residence is deductible, however it's limited to the interest on $1,000,000 of mortgage loans for home acquisition debt.  Further, if your total mortgage acquisition debt exceeds $1 million, you can treat the excess as home equity debt up to the $100k limit for HE debt or the FMV limit.<br>  <br>  With this in mind, you have $1,150,000 in total acquisition debt ($700k + $450k).  You can deduct  the interest on $1 million of that, plus a full $100k as home equity debt since the total loan amounts are well below the $2 million property values.  Therefore the qualified indebtedness for the mortgage interest deduction is $1.1 million.

(Example: If you'll be around hazardous equipment and need to be at least 18.)|`|AHCelSY1aa	No they CANNOT.  At most the job application can only ask if you are over the age of 18 and can legally work in the United States.  The reason being is to avoid any form of age discrimination in the hiring process.  The EEO is very clear about this. Date of birth can be given ONLY after the person has been employed for tax purposes. It is not necessary for background checks.  The only requirement necessary to conduct a background check is the persons social security number and home address.|`|nyqoPvL2aa	The trouble is that many applications state on the form that the material can be used for background checks.

7Du8UYB0aa	Hey, I hope you join because I just did last week! I know a few people who sell it and it is NOT a pyramid scheme...anyone saying that is very uninformed and not aware of how much you can make from it. Since when is selling a product and making 50% commission a scam?! It's the REAL deal! I wish you the best of luck and don't listen to them. If you want to sign up, then you have to sign up soon because there is an awesome deal going until the end of March where you get $100 for selling $600 worth of product (after commission) and of course, more after that. I just got my kit a few days ago and it is so cool! You get so much stuff for taking care of your skin. Lol, even if it doesn't work out for you then you still have the chance to sell it back to Mary Kay for 90% of what you paid for it. The kit is worth so much and the parties are so fun. The product practically sells itself. People need to consider that for one, Mary Kay is an amazing brand with amazing results. Two, the economy going down doesn't mean you won't be able to find women who take care of their skin...seems like we have some drr de drr's posting here;D|`|KyShUk8kaa	Mary Kay is a scam. It's a pyramid scheme that sucks you dry if you can't keep up.

Ask the couple thousand women who are making over $20,000 a MONTH in Mary Kay how great business is.  Go for it and good luck!|`|ncCWCIEFaa	Well first of all women are still buying skin care and make up they will not give that up just go to a department store and see.  Second CNN reported cosmetic up 11% and featured Mary Kay so decided based on fact no negative people...............who don't even have the facts.<br>  <br>  There were three things that did well sored during the depression and cosmetics was one of them.  Think about it would you stop washing your face or would you give up something else???<br>  <br>  Mary Kay started her Business with 5000 life saving when everyone else said she would fail so you either let other people sway you or you don't make up you mind based on the facts and what is best for you.  If you don't give it a try will you always wonder if it could have worked ??? <br>  Lastly I have to address the pyramid thing people who don't know the facts tend to believe in the pyramid scam which is illegal Mary Kay is not about getting you friends to sell it so you can make money you make your money from product sales 50% you get a small commission form the company 4% when you add a team member seems to me you make a little more selling ............. Also it is no different then other business they give sign on bonus es when you make referral I worked for a company that did that in Corporate America.  Department stores mark up products and sell but direct sales always gets a bad wrap. Think about it|`|1FAggU5Zaa	lol.. well i say not because i mean the economy is goin so so bad!! whos going to be thinking to buy make up!|`|bgtNYOp5aa	Sorry we don't want to be apart of your pyramid scheme.|`|Vq8Szjs9aa	ugh.
3tg9iXJIaa	Your ASVAB score is going to determine what job you get. I do not the requirment info. but I can tell you what to expect. 1. Your going to have to go to basic for x weeks, then go to tec. school for x weeks. You are not probably going to have a car until you get to your first duty assign. which could problably be overseas. You will not make alot of money, but you will not have to pay for room and board, insurance, etc. Personally, I would go to college for 2 yrs. first, then go in as an officer. A Lt. in the AF makes more a yr. than a Master Sgt. who has been in 20+ yrs. If you manage your money and take advantage of what the AF has to offer, you will be just fine. Also be sure to pick a job that is in high demand in the civilian world.
MbzyriZ4aa	The bank paid the person that sold the condo to your uncle $320,000 and your uncle is on contract to pay that amount back plus interest.<br>  <br>  That fact did not change.<br>  <br>  Now your uncles condo is worth $175,000 if he wanted to sell it but he still owes the bank for the $320,000 they paid out.<br>  <br>  Do you see the problem here? They will not agree to forgive $145,000 to bring the mortgage down to $175,000. You wouldn't do that either, would you?<br>  <br>  The new mortgage bail out for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac backed loans will not reduce the original mortgage amount but reduce the interest rates and may extend the length of the mortgage so that you can get lower payments. It doesn't change the fact that your uncle borrowed $320,000 to buy the place. He still owes that principal amount.<br>  <br>  A short sale can only be done if his bank agrees to forgive the difference. Very unlikely that they will agree to forgive $145,000.<br>  <br>  Both short sale or foreclosure will ruin your uncles credit for years to come.<br>  <br>  Instead of buying the condo from him you should find him a room mate to pay for the mortgage.|`|DXZK6eMNaa	He owes the bank the money, regardless of what he could sell the condo for.

5rYChsWFaa	They will not and can not freeze her bank account funds.  The most that they can do, if it is a valid account, is take her to court to get a judgment, which is unlikely for the amount of money.  Once they get a judgment, they could add it to her credit.  In order to enforce it, they would have to get a judge to garnish wages, also very unlikely.<br>  <br>  One very important aspect to look at is where the company is located.  A quick search found that they are located in New York and South Carolina.  The company can not sue you or enforce the collection from another state.  They must work with a collection agency or an attorney located in your state (Illinois) to enforce a collection.  Unless that happens, she doesn't need to worry.<br>  <br>  Also, I've heard about this company before and you can read through the posts in the link below.  They may not even have a valid account.  This might just be an attempt to get money for a non-valid account.  They will offer to "settle for less" because they know that they're not going to get anything if they try to do anything but harass your mother and send her letters.<br>  <br>  The worst thing your mother could do in this situation is send them money.  Probably the second worst thing to do is to contact them.  That being said, I'm not an attorney so don't take my advice as such.<br>  <br>  Collection agencies work off of people's fears and lack of knowledge of how collections work.  Don't let them take advantage of your mother.<br>  <br>  Let me know if I can help with any thing else.<br>  <br>  Jared|`|I5LngQcFaa	here are certain types of funds that are exempt from garnishment and notifying your bank that the funds are from one of these sources should release them.  If you put these funds in the account with your regular income, however, the bank may have difficulty determining which funds are exempt and which aren’t.<br>  <br>  The exempt income is as follows:<br>  <br>      * Most government benefits, including Social Security, unemployment insurance, veterans’ benefits and public assistance<br>      * A percentage of your earned wages, which varies by state<br>      * Alimony or child support payments, and other payments for the support of a dependent<br>      * Proceeds of the sale of property which is exempt from collection, such as a homestead exemption<br>      * Disability or unemployment benefits from your employer<br>      * Workers’ compensation<br>      * Retirement benefits, such as pension or annuity payments<br>      * Life insurance benefits due to the death of an insured or for wrongful death claims<br>      * Payments due to personal bodily injury, in an amount that varies by state<br>      * Proceeds of guaranteed student loans<br>  <br>  If you are behind on any debts, set up a separate account for any of the above types of income.  This will make it easier to protect them from garnishment.  If you have had your bank account frozen and you are receiving any of these types of funds, you need to take a letter to the bank detailing the kind of funds you are recieving and the amounts.  If you are not receiving any of these types of funds, your only option is to try to negotiate with the creditor.|`|E0xuQFFnaa	I would call the bank it could be fraud.|`|BvZvZaxzaa	Collection agencies often use scare tactics and threaten legal action when in many cases the dollar amount isn't worth even consulting an attorney. Your mom needs to gather all her "evidence" that she settled the overdraft charges and mail them to the collections account manager registered mail with return receipt. Wait 3-5 days and follow up with a phone call to make sure the collector received it and is researching with the bank. Have her make a few copies for herself before mailing them. Be prepared to mail them several times before this is resolved. Unfortunately, the collector is going to keep calling until she either pays them or proves she doesn't owe. If this is the first letter, I doubt her account will be frozen, but it's odd that it's been three years. Providing the proof should resolve this quickly but it's important to follow up and have a paper trail (return receipt your correspondence and do everything in writing). I had a similar debt from my bank and the collection agencies kept selling my debt so about every two months I would get called by a different agency over the same bill and have to send them a whole packet all over again. It was very frustrating but it's worth the effort to keep negative data off of your credit report. If this gets posted (or is already) to her credit report, she can dispute it. Keeping good records of all your dealing with the collector will go a long way in getting it removed from her report if it comes to that. THe worst thing you can do in this situation is nothing.

AA10045620	Unless the landlord will let him off the lease, he needs to fulfill his contract with them.  Loosig his deposit would be nothing compared to what a court would order him to pay for not doing so.<br>  <br>  He is responsible for the full term of the contract.  A judge would find him guilty of not abiding to the contract and make him pay for all of it, along with court costs and attorney fees.<br>  <br>  This would have an extremely negative affect on his credit report and could possibly stop him from renting or getting a loan.

v8b1psohaa	Affiliate Programs are a way for you to sell another company's products or services and receive a commission (or when you are ready, it is a way for you to get others to sell your products). Selling through another company's affiliate program is a great hands-off way to sell on the Internet. You promote the product or service on your web site (and don't forget your email). The company is responsible for the product or service; they process payments and ships the goods. You get the commission.|`|D8m1eqlVaa	Yes, as long as you are signed up with the site as an affiliate, and you use your affiliate link. Affiliate programs will provide you with special links that track any traffic from your site. Then, when someone makes a purchase, you get a predetermined percentage of the sale.

If not, send one.  Make sure it is handwritten - add that personal touch.  This will help you to be remembered in the event there were many people interviewing.  From the viewpoint of the interviewer, it is very difficult to always meet that one week time frame so don't get too down if you haven't heard from them yet.  If no word by early next week - 13th, give them a call.  Ask if it has been filled.  If they say yes.  Ask them if they would please tell you what you could have done better to improve your chances at the job.  Don't feel weird about asking this.  It will help you for future job interviews.

Set it up in their name and encourage them to make regular deposits. One way is to match their deposits. Let's say your ten year old son saves $5 a week and you match each deposit dollar for dollar, so a total of $10 goes into the account each week, or $520 a year. When he's ready to buy his first car in a few years, the down payment, if not the whole amount, will be waiting for him. <br>  <br>  Teach them how to spend money. That also means letting them make mistakes. When I was a kid, I blew a whole dollar on penny candy, one hundred pieces. It sounded like a good decision at the time, until the ice cream truck came down the street that evening and I had no money. No, I didn't get ice cream that day, though my parents did explain how I could have had some candy and some ice cream if I had chosen more wisely. The point: Take a proactive approach to educating your children about money and how to use it wisely. <br>  <br>  <br>  at first you child will probably think your lame for doing this but in the long run they will thank you.<br>  <br>  ps:<br>  you should still get them something nice so they dont feel empty handed lol|`|5MCmDpX5aa	Invest : buy a government bond for her... that the safest bond although not high return.. but it should be usable once she grown up..<br>  <br>  or buy laptop instead.. at her age, she shall been exposed to internet usgae... this may help her in school homework at later day too...|`|sVstXgc6aa	Laptop.<br>  <br>  Or just buy something reasonable like clothes.|`|XI4k0SZtaa	Lap top definately!

There are a few different kinds of licenses; one of them will enable you to sell only beer and other soft alcohols (wine, etc.), but no hard alcohol.  You'll have to apply with the state, and I believe the process takes a few months.

They do a hearing and vision screening and take a look in your mouth. They usually have some kind of bag lunch because yo will literally be there all day. I cant remeber if you could bring something with you. but i think you can. I would take a book and if you cna t bring it in then you'll get it when you leave. Ask your recruiter though. Wear sweat pants and a tshirt. you will want to be comfortable and if it is a hot day then wear long sleeves because the air conditioning can be border line freezing

RNqRnG86aa	It is entirely dependent upon the State where you live. The money in question — millions of dollars to each state — comes with strings attached because the federal government is requiring an expansion of unemployment insurance in order to receive the money, a continuing obligation that some governors have criticized as an unfunded mandate.<br>  <br>  Florida has already come to terms with the Department of Labor and has signed an agreement. Other States such as Georgia, Tennessee and Louisiana may not accept the economic stimulus money targeted for unemployment benefits.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	The bill needs a chance to get going first.

AA10774810	Don't listen to the nuts above.  If they close at 10 pm, then I would put "close" because it shows that you're willing to stay till 10:15 if the stores needs it.  But if you're really only available only 10 pm and not a minute later, then put down "10 pm".  Anytime you're available but don't actually want to work that specific hour, just put down "negotiable".  For example, who wants to work every Friday night?  Not me.  So you may write in "negotiable" and during your interview explain that you're willing to do every other Friday.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8cN4e8Vmaa	That is a tricky part cause I've learned to make yourself available so I used to put from open to close or on a computer app I would put the earliest time (for me) to the latest time. Then the employer would be like what does this mean?? I would feel pretty dumb cause that was what I was taught in classes so I would just explain that I was available anytime between those hours. Soo the lesson is put specific times I guess but the down fall on that is if you put hours and an employer needs a worker to work a different shift they will toss out your app quick! So just put open or put the hours that are the busiest for the business.
p3vjvzRPaa	Often the word marketing is used in job titles inappropriately.<br>  <br>  The positions are usually in fact sales or promotional roles, but the word marketing is used to jazz the job up a bit.  Very misleading unfortunately.<br>  <br>  A real marketing role would mean being responsible for liasing with other sections of the organisation to do things like:<br>  <br>  - investigating what the target market actually wants/needs (through market research).  In your case that would mean finding out what the community wants from the church.<br>  <br>  - determining what the overall approach of the organisation will be in terms of how people see it - will it be seen as youthful / traditional / innovative?<br>  <br>  - developing products and services to meet the community's needs efficiently and effectively. (Eg in a church, if it turned out that people would really prefer shorter services/more singing/a creche/whatever, the marketing person would work with the church leaders to see what could be done)<br>  <br>  - considering how the church can best deliver it's messages & services to the community.  Eg Would people prefer that the church has meetings at different days/times or at different locations?  Which members of the community may benefit most from church members visiting them in their own home?<br>  <br>  - identify ways to collect revenue to fund church activities.  Eg Are there some services that the church could charge for to support other services? If donations are required, how best to collect them?<br>  <br>  - how to communicate with the community  to ensure it is aware of what the church has to offer. <br>  <br>  It is more likely that your church is misusing the word 'marketing' and that your role is predominantly the last one I mention above - basically communication and promotions.|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	They think of 'genius' ways to tell lies to make something appeal to other people.<br>  <br>  If you're a Church going type you'll have to forego the 'lies' part and try and think of useful things that your product can do that other peoples' products can't do.|`|EwvZCLkjaa	you're like the middle man between the church and the people who might want to go there<br>  you are essentially trying to find new ways to sell your product which is in this case your church|`|EUlEES22aa	their main work is to sale the product and have the idea of its competitor

When I was born most people didn't have telephones. My parents were on a waiting list to get one. Then we had a party line until years until we could get our own phone line. Now some would say you need a telephone or even you need a cell phone. It isn't true I have had years as an adult with no phone and have had a cell less than a year. Now with messengers I rather send a note than make a call. My cell phone is upstairs all day today, I haven't bothered to go get it because I don't really need it.

ug00j0S8aa	To expand on what v b said, it looks like you sold the assets.  Did you actually just retitle the Vanguard account or did you sell the Vanguard assets and invest it with Bank of America?  If the latter, you definitely sold and owe taxes.  If the former, I would be surprised if you would owe.  You can give away shares without selling them, so you should be able to give them to yourself without selling them.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	According to Vanguard's reporting, they cashed out their existing accounts when they moved the money.

You have essentially calculated the yearly annuity payment and divided it by 12.  That's not correct.<br>  <br>  You need to amortize the interest accrued during the year after reflecting decreases in the monthly balance.  So, another way to do this is to convert the 7% annual into a monthly interest rate that corresponds to an APR of 7%.  That is, find monthly rate, "r", so that (1 + r)^12 = 1.07.  <br>  <br>  r = .005654.<br>  <br>  Now recompute, and the answer is:   $374.69

It's a theory used by investors, fund managers, financial planners, etc to diversify thier risks of investing. Real solid investors will use value investing with focus eg. Warren Buffetts to become the 2nd richest man in the world. This theory is used for those who would like to spread their investment capital into different baskets of instruments with proper assets allocation. Click the resources below to educate yourself as the best financial adviser is in front of your mirror.|`|9754ddf34893bfe1ddede28a953d843baa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  My name is Dr. Syed Alamdar Ali. The significance of Modern Portfolio Theory has been well defined in the anwer given by Mr. Sean Toh. The process of chooisng a right portfolio does not involve a single decision. It is in fact a continuous process of decision making i.e., keeping on looking at the Market Index and accordingly keeping on alternating the components of your portfolio. The whole of this process is so dynamic and instantaneous that even the speacilists sometimes make errors regrading the performance of a particular security or whatever the investment. To advise a pensioner to get involved in the act making an efficinet portfolio is the same asking a layman to start the practice of medicine by itself.<br>  <br>  This act cannot be supported at all.<br>  <br>  The best advice in this case is to definitly look for another company reviewing its performance in the past. There are many links on Yahoo Website to check for such good performaing funds.<br>  <br>  Loosing a portion of your Income for once is definitly better than loosing your investment for all.|`|544fd37b8dcc1b9f611f8acf906a6147aa	I DONT SUPPORT IT AT ALL

Get a panelized home package such as Eagles Nest. That way you can quickly (in 5 or 6 days) complete the exterior roof and walls on a foundation. That's called "dryed in." That way you are protected from the elements and people who like to steal building materials. Store everything inside. Then take all the time you need doing the interior walls, HVAC,  etc. in stages. That will cost you less and if you do it right you will finance the project in such a way that you will actually gain a subtantial amount of money (from what is called instant equity), to build out the home or upgrade it.|`|61ab44aa9a3e1e0423641102a4f9db7caa	yes u can...but, check w/building inspector for building permit expiration.  some municipalities have restrictions.  if u want 2 build in pieces, u may have to purchase permits 4 each aspect of phases of construction.  most locations will allow u to complete as much as possible until the permit expiration.  u may have to purchase multiple permits til the completion of your home.  when in doubt...contact your local zoning board/building permit office.

NcFWcO3Laa	Having an experience agent is always important.<br>  <br>  Let someone else help the new agent get the experience they need to get better.<br>  <br>  For example:  Most REO banks require the buyer to sign an addendum that states if the escrow period go beyond a certain time the buyer must pay a substantial per-diem penalty.  Often the escrow does go beyond that time and its not the fault of the buyer but the fault of the bank or the banks services (like escrow) that they used.<br>  <br>  It's important to have an agent that is on top of the process and  to date and document the bank's screw-ups so the bank will waive those late charges.  Also the agent needs to be on top of the buyers lender making sure that the loan in done on time and that a file doesn't sit on someones desk untouched for a week or two.<br>  <br>  Just two issues, but does anyone think that a brand new agent knows these things and knows how to fix screw-ups?

NxPPdCSjaa	Hi je t'aime: From the Dumb American!<br>  <br>  First try to understand in your own mind why they are asking this question! If you were sitting where they are, what would you like to hear in a short amount of valuable time!<br>  <br>  From Experience, (A lot of it) what they  want to hear is this:<br>  <br>  Where were you raised (Large city, small town, country Girl etc).<br>  <br>  What is your Education, might include latest GPA! <br>  <br>  Did you excel or participate in Extracurricular activities, at what level?<br>  <br>  What types of clubs or associations are you affiliated with, did you hold any leadership position in any of them.<br>  <br>  What type of experience do you have. IE: other internships or related after school/summer jobs. They are truly interested in how ambitious you are!<br>  <br>  What do you believe you bring to the table with this position you are applying for?<br>  <br>  Why do you see yourself as qualified? Besides education!<br>  <br>  Where do you see yourself in 5 years!<br>  <br>  Are you willing to travel/relocate? This will probably be a requirement at the firm you are going to! (Fleishman Hillard)<br>  <br>  Now balance these with your knowledge of the company you are applying to.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  I looked at some of your answers here on YA to get an idea of "who Your are" kind of like "Tell me about yourself"! I learned you are 21 living in England, (White-Portuguese/Asian, Probably Chinese), live in Leeds but grew up outside England, Petite (4-11 Medium long hair), Speak French, Spanish and Chinese in addition to English! (Multi  lingual is very good in your chosen profession)! You Like Soccer (Portugal) (good to have a sports interest) have had troubled with room mates but made it through etc. ( you can hang in there that is good)! You seem to be Politically "Conservative, Middile", Have or had a Boyfriend (White) that works 6 days a week but you still hang in there as well and that speaks well for you! You seem to have disdain for men thare are sexist and shallow! I personally like that! But, I am 73 years old!<br>  <br>   You are going into Public relations! Applying at "Fleshman Hillard" ( I think you meant Fleishman Hillard, if so don't make that mistake again or it will cost you)! What you write and how you write it tells a great deal about a person. You are quick to chastise, recommend punishment without all the facts, and slow to accept responsibility or give thanks! You advise taking only the required classes and not a well rounded education. this shows you are not real ambitious, just do the minimum! Your Grammer is juvenile!<br>  <br>  Now I say this as constructive criticism not trying to put you down in any way. I am just showing you how you come accross to someone who has never met you. I have interviewed many people not only for jobs but in white collar criminal cases and know a little of what to look for!<br>  <br>  Public relations requires a broad knowledge and excellent communications skills. You need to work on it a bit! I can't judge your body language here but you might want to consider it because it will be a big factor in a face to face interview! Some experts I know can tell more about you from that than anything! I have worked with Retired Secret Service agents as well as current FBI agents and equivilants in other countries including Scotland Yard and have seen them in action! Back to Mlti lingual, I got slammed rather hard one time by the Dutch National Police for not speaking Dutch when I came to the Netherlands to present a Criminal Case and Complaint in Amsterdam. They ultimately accepted my English version and made the Arrests! Being Bi Lingual would have been a great asset at Fleishman Hillard:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fleishman.com/careers/working-at-fh.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fleishman.com/careers/working...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://pov.fleishman.com/?cat=8" rel="nofollow">http://pov.fleishman.com/?cat=8</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I haven't been to London for a few years for meetings but are you sure you want to wear pants and jacket for the interview or a nice skirt and jacket. What is the dress protocol in Public relations firms in Britain? You don't want to down dress or up dress just try to stay upper middle for an interview. If you smoke don't light up unless you first ask permission and then only if your host does so as well! If offered Coffee or tea accept but don't be overly interested in it or ask for special ways to make it! Again better only if your host is having it as well!<br>  <br>  Once again, Why should they give you the position instead of someone else? What do yo bring to the party and are you a team player? Do you interact well with others above, below andat the same level? Do you take instruction well? Do you give instructions clearly and concisely with clear objectives? Do you have leadership potential?<br>  <br>  BTW as I read, I voted and you got some new BA's now! I only voted for your answer if I thought it was good. I could tell your answers by your writing style!<br>  <br>  Just trying to help out .! I am British by ancestory and I spent 1 1/2 years in Vietnam 68/69 as a civilian Computer Specialist for the US Army and kind of like the White/Asian combination!<br>  <br>  Proud Vet|`|fnytzXWTaa	Just tell them who you really are.

That is a people business and you will need to build a rolodex of potential clients who will also act as your word of mouth advertising.<br>  <br>  Would you decorate for hotels and businesses?  They key there is to build a relationship long before the season - say Spring.  You want people to think of you and you only when the time comes to make a decision.  Remember that people will buy from the famililiar vs somebody new hitting them right before the holidays.<br>  <br>  When it comes to sales, be sure to show people in your conversations that you are prepared to get in and get out - "making their lives easier".  That's what business people want to hear especially in the holidays.<br>  <br>  Birthday parties - network with catering businesses and other residual businesses that cater to that crowd - moonwalks, party rentals etc.  Let them know that as you get referrals you will mention their business and would like them to do the same - create win-win partnerships.<br>  <br>  Also, if you have a day job, keep it at the very least until you have your first few customers.  Most birthdays will be on weekends and decorating can be done then too. <br>  <br>  Best wishes!

You need to do that to be worth anything. Now, to continue, in my experiences, many companies do not see the value in PMI certification because of the incredible processes it demands teams to go through. They simply don't do it these days, even if they say they do. Creative thinking requires quick movement, trying new things, doing more of what works, less of what doesn't. It's not dependent on how much process (read bureaucracy) is created by the environment. Good Luck! Check with the kind of companies you are interested in working with. They may or may not want or see the value of PMI certification.|`|EmQ50DFVaa	If you are planning to seek PMP certification this year, then it would clearly be worthwhile, as the member's discount on the examination is is roughly equivalent to the year's dues  <br>  <br>  At the Mile Hi (Denver) chapter, the discounted educational programs may also represent a savings as you  bank Professional Development Units (PDUs), needed for the renewal process of your PMP certification.

Then have the photographer photographer pictures for your calling card. This will be both color and Black and white. With full body. How much should this cost. Well 500 to 1000 dollars. Good news though if you are truly model material and are easy to photography most photography's would strike a deal. I.E. you sign a release so they can use your images for marketing only . Then order about 250 -500 head shots and calling cards and hand deliver to commercial photographers that photograph for catalog's. or model agents. P.S. homemade cookies deliver with head shot always helps to get an interview. That's all for now God Bless and be save out their.

You need products that sell like Chocolates at Easter-Time, Toys at Christmas, Turkeys on Thanksgiving or Cold Drinks during a summer heat-wave. <br>   <br>  2.

75831f13ea8cf0732e02df4dff254816aa	Most states have whats called a tenet and land lord agreement. (even if its not in the lease) Its a book that you can usually get at your city hall that has all the regulations that the state puts on the landlords and what the tenet is suppose to do. <br>  <br>  In texas for example. did you know they can not charge you to change the locks? <br>  <br>  If you house is unlivable you have to send i think its three letters (via certified mail) and after that you can take the money that you would pay in rent and you have to pay it to a savings or be able to show that you have the money availible but you dont have to give it to the landlord. and they cant kick you out (CHECK THE BOOK FOR FULL DETAILS I AM RECITING FROM MEMORY HERE) Anyway every state has something similar. it really pays to read up. <br>  <br>  Most landlords dont fullfill all the obligations they are suppose to....<br>  <br>  (i had a LL that tried to charge me for almost everything that was on the move in list and i asked for a copy of the move in to prove the charges ~yes i really kept a copy for my self but i was not about to tell them that~ but they refused to produce it so the charges were dropped.!) <br>  <br>  Know your junk lovie....

However, roaches lay thousands of eggs at once and no matter how you treat them, they are going to hatch.  The solution is to keep treating the problem once a week for about 2 months.  Then they should be gone.  However:::::<br>  Roaches are usually due to food left out, messy apt, garbage out or basically a dirty person.  You didnt say if you lived in an apt complex or a single family home. You could have a perfectly clean apt, but if your neighbor isnt, then the roaches get throughout the whole building.  If a single family home, make sure the kids arent taking food and throwing it under the bed or in the closet to hide it from you (I did if I had something I wasnt supposed to have). Make sure all garbage is in a bag and put in a covered garbage can. Dont leave food out in the kitchen.  You also can spray around the baseboards throughout the home. Wipe down your cupboards with bleach water inside (roaches hate bleach), put moth balls inside closets around the floor, get some more roach bait and put in under the sink, behind the stove and fridge, behind the washer and dryer. They will carry it back to their nest and it will help kill them.<br>  I had to deal with large cockroaches in GA. Not because I wasnt clean, but because of the area.  They are not easy to get rid of, but it is possible.<br>  As your landlord, by your own admission, is treating the problem, NO, he is not responsible for your TV.  As far as you breaking the lease, explain to him you have children and that you cannot live there any more.  Ask him to release you from the lease.  You still may have to pay a penalty for breaking the lease (usually 2 mths rent), but it is well worth it.

If the value of their currency decreases while another country's currency remains strong, the exchange rate will be altered as well.<br>  <br>  For instance, our inflation rate increases and causes our dollar to be worth less (less purchasing power).

As the 'wealth' of a country changes the value of it's currency will fluctuate too. The interest rate is also is a good guide of how well a country is developed and how much money investors are prepared to contribute. <br>  For example, South Africa is a developing country, and people, after many years, are prepared to invest in it again. <br>  England has the strongest currency as it's an 'old' and very well developed nation. <br>  SA's inflation rate is going down, the UK's is fairly steady.<br>  The exchange rate is therefore sitting around R13 ( 13 South African Rands) to buy ￡1 (One British Pound)<br>  Thats just a rough outline and hope it helps.

ESFtkbCPaa	maybe gay spam... uhh
Gun3UGzaaa	The only way you will get out of this is by paying more than the minimum.  First, I would take one of the weeks where you have $200 left over, and scrape up another $100 from somewhere, and put that all on the $300 balance account so you have one where the interest stops running.  <br>  <br>  Second, ruthlessly go through your house, and anything you bought that you haven't used - return - and get the credits applied to your credit card.<br>  <br>  Third - Pay only cash for everything.  Once you get into a cycle of paying interest, everything you charge is 20% more expensive.  That $30 tank of gas you bought - it is now $36 because of the interest.  <br>  <br>  Fourth, google the term "debt snowball" they have some great ideas on how to tackle snowballed debt.  Basically it comes down to paying at least the minimum payment on everything, and then the most money you can possibly throw at a bill with the highest interest rate so it brings that one down.  Then, when it is paid off, use the money you were making on those payments to increase payments on the next highest interest rate.<br>  <br>  Fifth - get second jobs - for both of you.  Even if you only work one weekend day each and only clear $10 an hour each from the jobs, that is an additional $128 a week that can be put on your debt.  In eight months, this debt will be caught up.<br>  <br>  Six - stop going to the grocery store except for perishables.  Spend the next weeks using up things in your freezer and pantry, and use that money to pay off debt.<br>  <br>  Seven - Go through every item you spend money on and decide if it is a need (like medicine, rent) or a want.  For example, you need to have water to drink. You want beer.  Stop buying beer and drink only water until you are paid off.  Look over all of your household bills and find things you can cut/suspend until you get more room in your budget.<br>  <br>  Eight - I love this technique - if you plan to pay $200 on a credit card, don't pay $200 at once.  Use the bank's online bill payment system and pay $10 every single day.  Not only are you more likely to keep a promise to pay the full payment, but it drives your interest costs down by lowering your average daily balance.<br>  <br>  $10,000 is not that bad a balance, and if you really tackle it creatively, you can get out from under it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	If you have an extra $200 a month to put towards your credit cards then it will take two months to pay off the smallest credit card.  Take this $210 and put it towards the next smallest.  Once this is paid off take the total of say $220 and add it to the minimum payment for the next smallest until all are paid off.  That is what people mean when they say to pay the smallest off first, you put all of your extra towards one bill until it is gone then roll this amount into the next bill to pay off.  Once you have the credit cards paid off then use this technique to pay off your cars.  Finally, once you are out of debt take all of this freed up money to put towards savings and retirement so that you can pay cash for future cars.|`|qDBjH4s8aa	Don't make just the minimum payments! See if you can consolidate to one card at a low or 0% interest rate (Discover is always sending me stuff about this). Pay off as much as you can each month. When the rate goes up, switch the whole balance to another card with a low or 0% rate. Cut back where you can. See if you can rebid your insurance with another company, drop coverage options that you may not need if the cars are older and not worth a lot.|`|kpKBwOcnaa	Have you considered consolidating your debts into one affordable monthly payment?

Then once that is paid off either cut up that card or freeze it in your freezer in a container or bag of water.  yes you heard me right, this allows you time to contemplate using it again.  When it is paid off you add that payment on to the next, and next until they are all paid off.

If you don't want to sell it, mothball it (meaning no insurance, no gas, etc) for a couple of months till you get your credit card paid off. <br>  <br>  Consolidate your credit cards into one lump sum. Some companies will do this for you. <br>  <br>  Cut something out of your budget. Go without TV or Internet for a couple of months till you get your credit cards paid off.

After that, put every penny you can into the highest interest rate cards first.  And (as you say), stop using credit cards!|`|JXJvxhZPaa	Put together a list of all your monthly living expenses, including mortgage, property taxes, insurance, groceries, etc.  Add the minimum payment amount of all your credit cards to this list.  Subtract these items from your monthly pay.  Take the extra you have left over and apply it all to the card with the lowest balance.  I know it seems like you should leave it alone because minimum payments are so low, but each card you are able to pay off will feel like a moral victory for you and keep you motivated to keep getting rid of your debt.  As you pay off a card, modify your budget accordingly (i.e., don't include it in the list of minimum payments).

vYnIUIy7aa	Paying off the balance of your debt will help your credit. myFICO.com says that you should be somewhere between 10-30% of your credit limit. Above that lowers your score. Paying it completely off may also lower your score. Think about it! Creditors want to make money off of you, that's why they report negitive items so they can charge you higher interest rates. Why would they want to give you credit if you are not going to use it. <br>  <br>  According to myFico.com 35% of your credit score comes from payment history, and 30% comes from amounts owed, AKA - debt to credit ratio. The key to raising your credit score quickly is to keep making on time payments and keeping your debt to credit ratio between 10 and 30%.<br>  <br>  You said that you already paid of $2500 and have $2400 left. You are almost there. It looks like your credit limit is around $4900. Get your balances below $1470 and you should see an improvement.<br>  <br>  If you do not have the money to get your balances that low. you can try to raise your credit limits. HorizonCardServices.com, offers a Card for their merchandise, but they give up to a $7500 credit limit and report it to all three of the major credit reporting agencies as an unsecured revolving account. This card might even be a benifit if you what to obtain higher credit limits on your other cards. Creditors are more likely to give you a higher credit limit if they see that others are doing the same. Its that old paradox "loan money to somebody who does not need it."|`|AA12189612	It will make your credit better you should destroy your cards to keep from falling into the same circumstances again .(just a thought)|`|ehZYvw0Haa	your credit score will definitly improve . there is no question , if your credit was bad it may take a little bit to get back up to normal or above average but dont focus on that , you paid that much off :) GOOD FOR YOU! just pay all bills on time if possible and your credit rating will go up even more. I think  it depends how bad  your credit rating is , but the main thing is that you improved it . i do not  think it would be no credit .|`|oOaSLI9Jaa	It will make it better but if you really need help with your credit email me mmtrevor@aol.com I have a free book that helped me when i was in a similiar situation.|`|0f5d04e62f3e98fa3f80625e9fe9c6a0aa	Depends on what type of credit you are tlaking about and if you already have a bad credit rating or not. Generally paying off your credit within the time limit allowed with no false payments (payments with insufficient funds) then that will give you good credit. <br>     However IF you already have bad credit rating by false payments then you will have bad credit for 5-7 years after the debt has been paid off.<br>  <br>  Unless of course its with the marfia <?> or other thugs then your in deep doo doo.|`|AA12337032	It will leave it in good standing.. and your score will go up in time and good for u...

J1ljUfDzaa	My daughter works at SportChek and heard this to and has talked to the manager at West 49 (they're in the same mall) about getting a job there when they merge. She likes the music and teen guys that come in to West 49th. so she wants to be there instead. Small world eh?|`|w2dHX2cQaa	It's very likely, because West 49's stock price is at least 30% below its current value.

xNCIICISaa	Thank them for thinking of you, and let them know that you would have been glad to work for them, but because another company has extended an offer you accepted because of the unknowing economy. Let them know because they have hired you, you feel loyal to them to continue this job. Employers like loyalty, someone whos not going to immediently abandon ship.  but if circumstances should lead you away from the other company that you would like the contact information of the manager, and as someone else said, to keep your records in their database.|`|AEZ75dJ7aa	I would be honest with restaurant A and tell them you accepted a job elsewhere but would like to keep your application on file.  That way if you don't get all the hours you need or the job doesn't work out with rest. B than you can go back to rest. A-  But I also wouldn't sweat it to much because of the turnover and demand in the restaurant industry they won't "blackball" you.  They are usually desperate for competent help and almost always have openings.  You can most likely negotiate hours to work both places if you wanted to.  They tend to be pretty flexible.|`|tthuKag8aa	take the sure thing.  let the first one know that you appreciate them, and may work with them in the future|`|LK3PJVD3aa	Tell them the truth. You'll only be on bad terms with restaurant A if you lie to them and waste their time. <br>  <br>  Respectfully decline your interview and tell them you hope to stay in touch in the event you look for employment in the future.|`|8WCHCiEjaa	Many people say you should just politely decline the interview, BUT, times are tough and more people than you think will keep restaurant A hanging until you see more about your hours.  This isn't a Mary Poppins world and times are tough.  You are looking out for yourself.  Don't do anything outwardly rude, but say at the last minute you were offered another job and you accepted it (to restaurant A if the hours are worse) What will be your problem is if A is better than B and you have to quit.... there's not much around that, though there are masses of people out there looking for work.  I'm sure you won't leave them hanging. And you wouldn't need to put it on your resume for future applications.

1zWMTtZUaa	what is required depends on your location. You could go to the local library and see if they have village (or city/county) building codes and look it up.|`|EHEukHxPaa	It depends on your location. Many areas have statewide rules, but some areas have different local rules.<br>  <br>  You should simply ask the health department what they would like you to do. It is very difficult to look up local codes in the library. They don't always have them and many times unless you are familiar with code language it will be difficult to understand (I struggle with them sometimes and I've been doing this for 20 years!)<br>  <br>  In my area (Ohio) we would not replace a properly operating septic tank, but would require adding another tank to make 1500 gallons of capacity for a 3 bedroom house. Our county rules (each county is different in Ohio, but generally are similar) require at least 1500 gallons for a three bedroom home. The cost of a 500 gallon tank might be more than a 1000 gallon tank, because they don't make very many 500 gallon tanks. I would recommend a 1000 gallon tank. Keep in mind the rules are minimum requirements and going beyond them will benefit you in the long run. I would also suggest adding a septic tank filter at the outlet of the second tank.<br>  <br>  You will likely have to add more leach lines, assuming there is enough room and the soils will allow it. Again, the health department is your best resource here.<br>  <br>  The best way to make your system last longer is to use less water. <br>  <br>  To prevent the malfunction of your sewage treatment system the following materials should NOT be discharged into the sewer:<br>  ? Plastic Materials (including condoms)<br>  ? Tampons, tampon applicators, sanitary pads, etc.<br>  ? Cloth<br>  ? Large quantities of acids or caustics – soaps or cleaning materials, with a high or low pH factor<br>  ? Cigarette stubs<br>  ? Coffee grounds<br>  ? Disposable diapers<br>  ? Rubber Products<br>  ? Paper Towels<br>  ? Tissues<br>  ? Grease or fatty materials<br>  ? Oily materials, motor oils, grease, kerosene, gasoline, paints, etc.<br>  ? Any material which does not disintegrate or dissolve readily<br>  ? Backwash water from water softeners<br>  ? Sump pump discharge<br>  <br>  In short, the ONLY thing that should be flushed into the sewage treatment system is what naturally comes out of humans and toilet paper. This includes septic system additives! There are no additives that will significantly help the system, and there are some that can hurt the system. Here's some info on septic system additives: <a href="http://www.shelterpub.com/_shelter/ssom_additives.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shelterpub.com/_shelter/ssom_...</a><br>  <br>  Good septic system maintenance info, including how often to pump:<br>  <a href="http://ohioline.osu.edu/aex-fact/0740.html" rel="nofollow">http://ohioline.osu.edu/aex-fact/0740.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Great resource for more info:<br>  How septic systems work<br>  <a href="http://www.inspect-ny.com/septbook.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.inspect-ny.com/septbook.htm</a>

1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	I interviewed with a local macy's here in central Pa.  It was a huge disappointment and a joke.  They didn't give me any idea what type of sales job it would be and I filled out a few web pages of information to get to that point.  I was involved in 2.5 hrs of waiting and interviewing to find it was for a part time job with very few hours per week...enough that I have no interest even though I've been unemployed for 9 months.  The management seemed so disorganized and ridiculous I should have walked out.  The canned questions they ask are stupid and anyone in sales for any length of time could answer them with ease.  I could be called to be GM of the local store but would only consider it without near the hassle or indignancy I encountered even though I'm really pretty easygoing.  I have no respect for their credit card pawning BS cover for a department store.  Good luck...I hope your experience is much better though I suppose with any corporation you encounter a very thorough jack job.
egCSxjRiaa	Can sell anytime after you own. Call your broker & givem hell.|`|P4gEmKaGaa	Any account should allow you to purchase a stock position and then sell your position immediately. However there are several rules you must be aware of.<br>  <br>  First off, you must have the necessary cash in the account to complete the transaction, keep in mind that you must pay commissions.<br>  <br>  Secondly, if you are practicing a day trading strategy there are day trading (also known as Pattern Trading) requirements. The first is that in order to make 5 or more round trip day trades, your account must have a minimum value of $25,000.<br>  <br>  If your account is below this $25,000 threshold, then you will be limited to a maximum of 4 round trip day trades per week. If you make 5 day trades within any given trading week and your account does not have the required funds, all purchasing activity in your account will be frozen and you will only be able to sell your positions until your account value surpasses the $25,000 minimum balance.<br>  <br>  PS - Be very careful day trading if this is your intent. There is great money to be had, but just as great are the losses.

8b96e0549932f6f7dc7802568aa00011aa	Wow, what a terrible thing for a landlord to do to you and your dog.  How irresponsible of your new building management.<br>  <br>  "Immediately" is not very specific which is why this sets off a few warning bells to me.  In my experience as a tenant for the past decade, landlords usually give you a specific time frame like 3 days or 30 days notice.  When my building's new management company sent me an informal notice with non-specific terms like "immediately", I called my local Legal Aid office and my Housing Rights Center and learned they actually didn't have the legal right to issue that kind of order.  They were trying to intimidate me into controlling the way I live beyond legal limits. <br>  <br>  I live in the state of California.  You don't say what state you are in, but I recommend you call your local Legal Aid office and find out what your rights are.  They differ from state to state.  Are you living under a lease?  Is your dog included on the lease?  Are there other tenants with dogs similarly sized in the building?  Did your previous landlord offer written permission for you to have your dog?  These are issues you should explore.<br>  <br>  If you learn that you have the right to keep your dog, take a deep breath and proceed with the goal of maintaining a good relationship with your landlord.  Talk with Legal Aid or whoever your legal resource is and ask them how you should proceed.  As you have done here, write out a list of your dog's positive attributes just so you know where you stand.  <br>  <br>  If I were you, I would do everything I could within legal limits to keep my dog.  Good luck with this, and I wish you the best.|`|RZzMse3Haa	It is legal for landlords to have a size limit on dogs.  If they say he must leave immediately then that is the same day of service.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	immediately means right now, if not sooner, bet your house smells nice|`|FPqO2ef3aa	Don't give him up no matter what try looking up the laws ect if the rules in the building changed do they have to give you a 30 day notice? I don't know wea you live so it makes it even harder to say.  Don't give up the dog tho.  Look further into it call the management office speck to them are have a friendly neighbor call for you and try and find out.  They might lie and tell you right away b/c they want your dog gone when in reality you have more than that.  Did you have a lease that says it was ok for him to live there?  Don't give easily!!!  Good luck to you and your dog I would never give my golden retriever up!!|`|YJDJO3XLaa	I'm not sure they can legally do that. You have a lease contract? Until that expires you should be fine. According to that it was ok. Legal document. Or did the new managment handed a new  contract to you? I really hope you won't put the dog in the shelter though, I would rather go than give any of my animal up..Don't give up!|`|kifwyOgKaa	Immediately means as soon as possible.....it doesn't have a set time limit, but I would think within the next week.|`|LpVwWJVsaa	I am suprised that they are not grandfathering your dog into this?  Do you have a valid lease agreement?  If so, they may be prohibited from making you give up the dog until your lease ends.  Many leases have a clause in them that basically states no matter who owns, works at or manages the property, the lease will remain valid and enforceable.<br>  <br>  I would talk to the management and explain your situation.  Ask them how much time you will have to find him/her a new home.  Offer to pay an additional security deposit (if you haven't already paid one) and even additional pet rent.<br>  <br>  Is your dog considered a companion animal?  If so, do you have validation from your doctor stating that the dog is a necessity?  If so, they cannot make you get rid of the dog under the ADA.<br>  <br>  I hope that everything works out for you and wish you the best of luck!|`|WA7MzJeIaa	So sorry to hear that you have to give up your beloved pet. I know that must be hard to do.<br>  <br>  If they said immediately, he should probably be out of the apartment within a week.<br>  You could go speak with management and ask them exactly how long you have to find him a new home. Explain your situation, etc.
nxEoR9CEaa	Seems your father is filing married, head of household claiming 1 dependent.  Calculate your own refund, and have your father do the filing without claiming you.  Calculate the difference.  If your father has said you will receive the whole difference between your filing and him claiming you, take your fathers offer.EDIT:  your mother will receive a larger refund claiming you as a dependent.|`|AA10469473	No, the only people who can file a joint return together is a married couple.|`|AA11607373	First off, I would like to know your age. Simply are you above 18? Next, you do not need to file taxes if you make that much. If you are living with your dad, you are most likely still a dependent and will benefit from giving him the information.<br>  <br>  It is possible to claim income you make if you are a claimed dependent. I do not believe you are required to file income tax. You will not get any more if YOU file the taxes yourself.<br>  <br>  *Edit: If you are living w/ your mom, then I would suggest you try filing your own taxes. You can do it online for free (for federal, you have to pay for state). Go to turbotax or something easy.

Depending on the reason the APR is increased you MAY have the option of closing the account and keeping the same APR. If you have been in default for ANY reason you will not have this option.

It's beause they can, they don't have to have a reason. Once you put that kind of balance on your card they may as well pump as much interest out of you as they can right? Yes, it's immoral and greedy but also perfectly legal.  Credit cards pull dirty tricks like that all the time which is why I don't use them.  But one thing is this, they hope you simply will not notice or care. Most people they do this do just accept it.  If you were to pick up the phone and raise holy hell with them there is a good chance they will revert it. Right now all they are doing is ripping you off, you know it and they know it. Call them out on it.|`|c61325aa87935d634d6579671f1b48a9aa	You can call them and tell them how you feel. If they value you as their customer they can, if they want...make some adjustments.<br>  <br>  Otherwise since its in the clause...thats that and you cant do a thing about it regardless of if you asked for the card or they just sent it and you ACCEPTED the card and their terms.<br>  <br>  If you dont like it transfer to another card with a lower rate.<br>  <br>  There are some cards that will give you a 0 percent rate for the first six months.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Debts cannot pass down to children or between siblings.  Debts can't really pass to spouses either but if the spouses own property jointly it can be attached to a debt held by either spouse, so debts by one spouse can nonetheless hurt the other one financially.|`|AA12164734	of course not!!

BoOAdCWhaa	Greetings,<br>  I saw your question and I think it is a scam.  I've done a little bit of research looking into the email that I received as well (whole email below).  It looks to good to be true. I do have my resume posted on CB but my qualifications are not in shipping/receiving import/export  I went to the Cargo Express website and found that it looks like a legit company based out of UK; however looks can be deceiving.  I went to Whois and looked up the domain and found that it's registered to a company in China.   I am still looking more into the aspect of it being a Scam.  I don't think I will be sending my resume.<br>  <br>  Dear jobseeker,<br>  We've reviewed Your resume on CareerBuilder and found that You fit our <br>  basic requirements<br>  to become our merchandise manager.<br>  <br>  DESCRIPTION<br>     Over the past four years, Cargo Express Company  has emerged as the <br>  leading innovator <br>  in the merchandise forwarding service with an approach focused on <br>  European. <br>     The US take-up of Internet trading is much higher than in the <br>  Europe. Many Internet <br>  auctions and stores in the United States of America do not ship the <br>  products overseas. <br>  As the result thousands of customers in Europe are not able to access <br>  the large market<br>  and purchase high-quality merchandise at so low prices. Cargo Express <br>  provides <br>  European customers with US and Canada street addresses that can be used <br>  as the shipping<br>  addresses. Then our merchandise managers forward the packages to the <br>  country where the customer <br>  is located. It is the same if they had relatives or friends in the <br>  United States and could ask <br>  them about such service.But not so many Europeans have friends and <br>  relatives in the United States. <br>  Our service is in the ever growing demand. Today we have few <br>  merchandise managers on the territory<br>  of the United States and Canada but quantity of our customers increases <br>  and we plan to expand.<br>  <br>  <br>  JOB REQUIREMENTS:<br>  Competencies Required. The Merchandise manager must possess the <br>  following competencies: <br>  - Ability to analyze situations, identify problems and implement <br>  solutions. <br>  - Ability to communicate effectively with associates and customers. <br>  - Home computer with Internet access,computer skills and working <br>  knowledge of the Microsoft Office Suite (Word,Excel  <br>    and Outlook);<br>  - Ability to effectively supervise the work of other associates. <br>  - Ability to read, write and perform basic math functions. <br>  - Ability to complete all necessary paperwork. <br>  - Opportunity to check e-mail for new letters regulary (several times <br>  each day);<br>  <br>  <br>  SALARY AND BENEFITS <br>  As a Cargo Express Team Member, you may be eligible for great benefits <br>  like: <br>  $4,247 entry level / $5,594 maximum earnable excluding longevity and <br>  educational growth. <br>  Employer-paid medical, dental, vision for employee and dependents to <br>  include domestic partner <br>  (prorated for employees working less than 100% of full-time) <br>  Employer-paid long-term disability for employee <br>  Voluntary life insurance <br>  12 paid holidays plus 1 floating holiday annually; paid non-workdays <br>  between Christmas and New Year <br>  12 days sick leave accrued annually (prorated for employees working <br>  less than 100% and 12 months) <br>  22 days vacation annually (prorated for employees working less than <br>  100% and 12 months) <br>  Personal necessity leave and personal business leave <br>  Educational growth incentive program from $35 to $175 monthly <br>  <br>  <br>  If you are looking for a career opportunity in a positive and exciting <br>  environment, mail  your resume to: SoniaWohler@cexpress.info|`|333ded3464500456eb2a58352d69f5b7aa	I to have received this e-mail and I agree with the previous respondent who feels it is a scam. The reply to e-mail of job@cexpress.info just doesn't feel right. I would be very cautious in replying to this e-mail if I were you. I do have a logistics background, but will pass on replying. Most legitimate companies will put the name of their recruiter in the e-mail if it were sincere. Good luck.

cr5EoqVjaa	I've been in commercial real estate for over 25 years. It's a good field and you can make good money on the brokerage side (leasing or investment sales) in most economies. But you'll have to work hard and forego immediate gratification (money) because most agents are on commission only.<br>  <br>  I would stay away from residential. Too many losers in the game because it's easy to get in.|`|brOOXQfYaa	All of those jobs are great opportunities, but you have to look in the mirror and decide if that is what you want to do.  I know mortgage brokers and agents that are making well over $100k, even in this market.  It boils down to if you are willing to do the necessary work to make the moeny come to you.  That is sales 101.  The more people you can convince to use your services, the more money you will make. From experience, if you are mortgage broker, just starting out, are you willing to make 100 calls a day for the next 5 years? And you can sell, then you will make a ton of money.  It is network, working long hours, finding business that others are too lazy to work for.  Sales is not just a Job, it is a lifestyle.|`|W2YtVUqKaa	residential or mortgage broker. you might not get rich but at least you ll have work
fSlZQzS4aa	Nobody can garnish your federal tax return.  Your federal tax return is the document that you file with IRS.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	Only the IRS can garnish your tax return.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	Can you provide more specific information?|`|4bIKv1UOaa	They can garnish both. They have been for 3 years on me.
AA11383475	You have to pay|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	What the doctor says doesn't matter. It's what the insurance plan says that matters.|`|y2ZukikXaa	You're talking about two different things.  If the doctor bills the insurance company $200 and the insurance company discounts the bill to $130 (because that's the 'negotiated amount'), they then cover 80% of the $130 (assuming that's the design of the plan - they could also cover 100%, 90%, 70%, etc...).  Assuming they pay 80% then you'd pay the balance of 20% of the $130.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, if the doctor is not 'in-network' and doesn't accept your insurance then the math above still works, but IN ADDITION to paying the 20% of the $130 you'd also pay the difference between the $200 and the $130.  If they are in-network that $70 difference disappears.<br>  <br>  You always match your EOB (Explanation Of Benefits) up with the bills from the doctor/hospital and if they match you pay them.<br>  <br>  If you don't pay them then your bill will go to collections and it will hurt your credit.|`|9FxR4khCaa	Many years ago, your doctor may have gotten your dad a professional courtesy discount on the balance or he may have just talked them into accepting what the insurance paid. These days, those types of reductions are few and far between. If the EOB matches what you are being billed for, legally, your dad is responsible for the balance.|`|AA11598210	~~He will have to pay the 20 percent of the contracted rate (not the full amount, but the negotiated rate your insurance company receives). Never pay a bill to a doctor until you receive the EOB (explanations of benefits) from you rinsurance company. This tells you exactly what the patient responsibility is for every billed charge. If he has not received one for this procedure, have him call the number on the back of the insurance card and ask a rep to tell you the responsible part he owes, and have them send you the EOB.<br>  <br>  Doctor's offices make many mistakes in billing, therefore you need your EOB's to know it is correct. You want to make sure they wrote off the difference of the full amount and the contracted amount prior to charging your 20%.  Many times they bill the 20% without the insurance contracted rate, and that is illegal. This may be what the radio discussion was referring to. So call the insurance and they will tell him exactly what he owes.~~|`|KN3I89Ycaa	He needs to pay that bill.  I don't know what he heard on the radio or what happened before, but he had a surgical procedure done and his copay is 20%.  If he doesn't pay, it'll go to collections and hurt his credit.  Verify what the copay is actually for and call your doctor to verify and then call your insurance company.<br>  What I will mention is this: we are military and our insurance is Tricare.  Our bills come with one amount for what the doctor charged and what Tricare paid.  There is always a difference because our insurance pays docs less.  It looks like we owe all the time.  The front of the bill reads "this is not a bill", it's just to inform us what was charged and what was paid for our tax records.  It may be the same if he's on Medicare or something like that.  <br>  The fact that he had the procedure done before could be the problem.  Maybe he has coverage for one surgery or something like that, which is why they aren't paying it.  <br>  Again, find out what they are charging you for specifically and call your insurance company to find out why that isn't covered or why you have the copay.  Good luck.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	The insurance policy states that the insurance company only pays 80% of the total amount that the doctor or other provider charges.  Some doctors will prepare a bogus bill indicating a total charge of 125% of the amount that they actually require, so that the insurance company will pay the amount that the doctor actually wants, and will think (incorrectly) that you are paying the rest.  <br>  <br>  In any case, you are required to pay the 20% unless the doctor or other provider agrees not to make you pay it.  You do not have the right to refuse to pay.  If you do not pay, they may sue you or (more likely) send the bill to a collection agency, which will ruin your credit for 7 years.|`|UdtzY5ciaa	Yeah, I've never heard of anything like that.  As far as I know, you'd have to pay it.
FKzZTtw2aa	you can only add funds to paypal from your bank account. you can probably sell the card on ebay for face value, lots of people do. let them bid up the price from 99cents. then they pay you thru paypal and you mail them the card.|`|LOrFtSCHaa	If this is credited in your pay pal account, try the feature withdraw money and see if you can transfer that money to your bank account (which I doubt) you may have to purchase something.

A1kiUMgvaa	Only if the property you are asking about is rental property.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	No.  Repairs are not "home improvements."  Even if they were, it only adds to your cost basis when you sell - it is not a deductible expense (unless you're talking about a rental property).|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	At best he adds it to the cost basis.  That will reduce any gain at sale and reduce the capital gains tax if any is due.  It's not deductible though.|`|F3UxxmrLaa	Work on the upkeep and maintenance of a personal residence is not a tax deduction unless it is a multi family home.  If it's a duplex he can deduct half the costs.
3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S., Canada and Europe which you can create to generate income:<br>  <br>  1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|EFOBeGu4aa	Babysitting.  Raking leaves.  Mowing Grass.

MGhUkJhEaa	Got any things you can get rid of? eBay and Craigslist  are great ways to make extra cash. I've been doing that since becoming pregnant to make up for the money I'm spending on maternity clothes and baby gear. Also try cleaning houses when you're up to it, my mom did that a lot. Also, there's a website called FusionCash that I recently joined where you take surveys and stuff and get paid for it. I know most people think those are scams, but this isn't. I already earned $68 on it. So, if you're really desperate and have time on your hands, you could try that.

So it doesn't matter that you lose; you just have to look after yourself.<br>  You are fit, and can work any losses off.<br>  <br>  That condition is very helpful.<br>  Me??<br>  I started much later, but my first effort at business at 29 was clear failure  - not enough research into the area that needed to carry the multi-service business I started.<br>  Tehn again, I had a friend who started his own business when single - at 18 - a green-grocer's business.<br>  He moved quickly; before he was 20 he had a 2nd business.<br>  He eventually became a millionaire - when becoming one meant more than today.<br>  His main asset, to me, was his very great 'Generosity', but he did believe in hard work and he put in 75 hours per week as an 18 year-old!<br>  That is tough stuff!!<br>  <br>  2.<br>  You need to know your product very well; you need to get to know your suppliers very well, and what can and can't be done.<br>  You need to thoroughly learn your field, and everything about it ... don't rush in.<br>  Do your Research.<br>  <br>  3.<br>  Get a Mentor.  ... a Mentor who believes in 'doing the right'<br>  It is often very well to get an Expert [I mean a 'Real' very successful person - not just a Broker, for instance - a Guru.<br>  [As they say, "brokers" are often called brokers because  they are 'broker' than you!]<br>  But he has to also be a Guru of great personal ethics and Godly disposition; there are many many well-practised fakes out there, who catch the inexperienced easily.<br>  <br>  4. Like all people you will have to pay for mistakes early<br>  You will have to pay for good mentorship as well.<br>  As they say, "When a person who has money meets a person who has experience, the person who has experience will get the money, and the one who has the money will get the experience!!<br>  <br>  5.<br>  Even in Real Estate, get a trustworthy successful operator in that field to help you - certainly, not just a real estate agent or a [so-called] "financial advisor"; you need someone who knows "investment" thoroughly and is proven personally successful, and is willing to take you through the whole process, unless you are one of these people who is very savvy.  I was not, and needed honest reliable help.<br>  By the way, I knew a man who started buying properties at 18.<br>  He now has 6 - all fully paid for for years now.<br>  But he hasn't needed a job for at least 10 years.<br>  <br>  6.<br>  You can also invest in stock; but, again the maxim applies regarding the man with money and the man with experience.<br>  You will certainly lose early on.<br>  If you are going to risk the stock market, you should at least minimize your losses by sticking with regular stocks [not "futures', etc.] and gamble only on 'blue chip' [top 200 companies].  They are less volatile and more reliable performers.<br>  Nevertheless, get a proven Mentor; remember, 80% of stock market traders lose money - overall.<br>  10% of them break even, but ONLY 10% OF THEM ACTUALLY MAKE ANY MONEY!<br>  That mere 10% however, are only there because they have, over time, learned the real principles and have become 'the well-informed'|`|43jSsf9Jaa	put it in a mutual fund|`|1c2578f5490983feceb33c751d00d2fdaa	invest some in high risk, some in moderate risk, some in low risk|`|ill5xYkCaa	There are lots of ways to invest your money.  A financial advisor can guide you through your best options and can also work out a strategy based on how comfortable you are with risk (the more risk the bigger the gain/loss). <br>  <br>  Ask to see their credential and references before taking their advice.

Now people with poor credit can get the same choices as those with the good or mediocre credit. Today you can use bad credit personal loans for many purposes like car purchase, vacation or even debt consolidation.<br>  <a href="http://pay-your-debts.com/category/Personal-Loan-With-Bad-Credit.html" rel="nofollow">http://pay-your-debts.com/category/Perso...</a>|`|6cd7bc1f4ea89423120a941654af1d9baa	Sure, if you have a sterling credit score.|`|JOVqN9GLaa	If you have high credit, I would recommend opening a new credit card with a great 0% A.P.R offer on all balance transfers.  They almost always offer them at that rate for one year out, so that will give you more than enough time above your 120 days.<br>  <br>  Why would you do this?  Because you can either charge the 19K on your original credit card, and then balance transfer to the new one at 0% A.P.R. OR, often times you can obtain "convenience checks" if whoever is due the 19K won't accept a credit card.  It works just like a check.  Provide your ID along with it and they should accept it.  THEN, balance transfer the 19K over to that new card of your with the 0% rate.<br>  <br>  In 120 days, you'll have the money, and you can pay off the newly opened credit card, full balance.   And you wouldn't have paid a dime in interest!<br>  <br>  Not too shabby huh.

They will not force you to refinance.|`|8zdE8Ic5aa	You will definitely be able to keep the loan as long as it was a joint mortgage.|`|AA10614067	If your name was on the mortgage then yes, you keep it as is.<br>  <br>  If your name was not on it then you have the option to assume the loan.  You will need to have enough income to qualify for the loan but you will be able to keep the same VA loan.  Contact the bank who currently services the loan and tell them that you would like to assume the loan.<br>  <br>  If you don't have enough income to support getting the loan on your own then the estate will need to sell the home.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|RJHq1WEVaa	Mortgage companies always want you to refinance because they make tons of money off or you.<br>  <br>  Most likely the loan would stay as is if the loan was joint.

663da2330c0f3cf1cc8b90d22d5a9919aa	First off, I would highly recommend against any thing that is promoted through an infomercial, in addition, you need to talk to the many others on the internet who have experience in working at home.  I know that it is hard to get straight answers when someone is currently working for a company but you can get an idea of what is popular out there and use your intuition if something just doesnt sit right with you.  You are going to have to do your homework to find the right business for you, and no matter what, you can not get rich quick... PERIOD!<br>  <br>  With any home based business, generally there is an investment and you will have to work hard to promote yourself and your site.  Making $6000 a month isnt going to happen overnight!  I am involved in a business opportunity that can help me create that type of income, but it takes work and time to build the foundation. <br>  <br>  If you want guarenteed income, you will need to look for a telecommuting job.  However, those are not easy to get.  Everyone and their dog wants one!  You will need skills and a solid portfolio or resume proving your ability.  <br>  <br>  There are home based businesses that work, many will, if you do two things:<br>  1.  Believe in yourself<br>  2.  Work hard and stay motivated<br>  <br>  I know a good resource for work at home jobs and can tell you more about what I do if you want to email me at justagrl30@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  Good luck! <br>  Amy|`|00q4bc4Faa	If you are trying to work from home or just trying to make a little extra money check out this site below.

But you have to always be able to pay them on time every month. <br>  <br>  The problem with bankruptcy though, is that until it drops off your credit report it can very hard to get your score above 600.

By paying on time, and always more than the minimum, your score will increase every month. Just make sure the balance you keep on it is minimal.|`|bVkz2IDiaa	Hi. The absolute first thing you need to do is request a copy of your credit report from all three credit bureaus and make sure that everything included in your bankruptcy that is on your credit report states either discharged in bankruptcy or has a zero balance. There are so many errors on credit reports after bankruptcy. If there are things that aren't shown as "included in bankruptcy", just dispute it with the credit bureau and they will correct it.<br>  <br>  As far as obtaining credit or purchasing a vehicle, there should be several dealerships in your area that will finance you provided that your case has been discharged. Please be advised that your interest rate may be a little high...maybe lower double digits {11 - 12 %} but you can get financing. <br>  <br>  The most important thing to do is to review your credit report. There is no need for you to contact a credit repair company because they will charge you for something you can do for free.|`|k2IJujEvaa	Here are some easy steps to help you fix your credit:<br>  <br>  First, make sure all the information on your credit report is accurate. <br>  <br>  Second, try to pay off all or any accounts that are currently in collections or make payment arrangements with the creditor to pay off the balance monthly.<br>  <br>  Third, any credit card that is over 50% of the available credit line should be paid down to under half of your total credit line. Your credit score is lowered when your available balance is over 50% of your total credit line.<br>  <br>  Finally, if you have bad or no credit and have no credit cards try to obtain two credit cards and make sure all of your monthly payments are made on time. This will help increase your credit score. If you cannot be approved for a unsecured credit card, obtain a secured credit card.

I see no problem, but check your lease to be sure you are permitted to attach anything to the outside of the structure.

Worst case scenario, the birds build a nest, chirp all day long, and attract bugs and such.  Not worth it in my opinion.  Just watch the Discovery Channel instead.
