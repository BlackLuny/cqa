20090309145750AAC9dJK	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Is it ok to eat only this at dinner everyday?	So...   Have you ever heard the saying: eat breakfast like a king, eat lunch like a prince, and eat dinner like a pauper?      Well.. I am trying to apply that saying to my eating regimen.      What do you think about eating only fruits and vegetables (serving size each) for dinner each day? I mean some days will have exceptions--like if I was going out with a friend somewhere, etc..but for the most part, each day would be just fruit and veggies for dinner.       You may think I will get bored with this..which may be true. However, I think we can train our bodies to do anything really--even become used to what we eat and when.  For instance, I would never choose to eat meat/fish/pasta, etc in the morning--no matter how little the amount. I am assuming this is because I am just not used to doing that.

20090227102140AAB7tWx	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Bored with food; What do you eat as a vegetarian?	I've been a vegetarian for about a year now and I feel a lot better.I do understand the whole "animal rights" thing, but that's not what made me become a vegetarian (Although, I do keep it in mind). I've always naturally disliked meat, but I do love milk, so I go for the organic milk. It's more expensive, but I suppose it's worth it, I'd rather eat anything organic to be honest. Anyways, I guess I'm feeling a bit bored with my diet and I just want to know what kind of dishes you make, add prices in too, if you'd like. Also, where do you shop for your food? There's a Whole Foods and a Rainbow near my house, but they're both expensive. I usually go to Kroger, they're not AS expensive, but they have less variety. So if any of you vegetarians know of a good place to shop at online or anything like that let me know, any good recipes or anything like that, because I have a few things that I buy every week, and I just need a little change. Thanks!
