I'm voting Democrat because when we pull out of Iraq I trust that the bad guys will stop what they're doing because they now think we're good people.

I'm voting Democrat because I'm not concerned about the slaughter of millions of babies so long as we keep all death row inmates alive.       I'm voting Democrat because I believe that business should not be allowed to make profits for themselves. They need to break even and give the rest away to the government for redistribution as THEY see fit.       I'm voting Democrat because I believe three or four pointy headed elitist liberals need to rewrite the Constitution every few days to suit some fringe kooks who would NEVER get their agendas past the voters.       I'm voting Democrat because I believe that when the terrorists don't have to hide from us over there, when they come over here I don't want to have any guns in the house to fight them off with.

20090225080847AAp1hN5	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	I'm a guy. If Octomom can proclaim her 8 ovum "precious life" should I freeze my seed to produce 10,000 babies?	This speaks to the age-old debate as to when does life actually come into being and are the current definitions we have in the law truly correct or appropriate.      In the Feb 2009 CBS interview with Nadya Doud Gutierrez Suleman (a.k.a. "Octomom"), Nadya states two of her reasons for going ahead with the implantation of 6 invetro-fertilized eggs was that: a) she considered her preserved eggs to be precious life, and b) she thought only 2 of the 6 might survive to produce offspring.  As it turns out, not only did all 6 survive, but 2 split to produce a new brood of 8 to go along with her existing brood of 6 (14 total children).      In the 2/25/09 episode of "The View", Sherry Sheppard related how she has several of her eggs preserved at a clinic and must pay each year to keep them preserved.  Even though she has 3 boys, she still pays to keep her eggs preserved because she considers them to be precious life as well.      O.K. so if a female's ovum is so precious that one can call it "life" worth preserving, what about a male's sperm?  Is a male's sperm "less precious", and if so, why?       Shear quantity, eh?        Then one might argue that the more human lives there are in a nation, the less precious each one becomes under the law in deserving protection.  Are our laws in the United States constructed to operate that way?  I don't think so -- at least in theory -- although in actual practice, inequity under the law between parties is often shown in the verdicts handed down based on overcrowded courts or a defendant's lack of funding to afford a good attorney.  In that case, quantity enters into it (e.g. either too many cases backlogging the court or not enough dollars to afford a good attorney), but the laws themselves don't canonize quantity as a factor worth considering in the application of the laws.      So if a guy releases any of his seed, should he proclaim each one of them has a "right to be BORN!" as the Octomom might proclaim of her own precious ovum?  And if people sell their genetic material to fertility clinics, should 1 ovum fetch the same price as 1 sperm?      Or might there be natural reasons for inequality in some things in our society?

20090225082230AA7MzkM	Politics & Government;Politics	Should we keep BOBBY JINDAL out of the White house?	His positions:      Abortion and stem cell research      Jindal has a 100% pro-life voting record according to the National Right to Life Committee.[33] He does not condemn medical procedures meant to save the life of a pregnant woman that would indirectly cause the termination of the pregnancy.[34][35] In 2003 Jindal was reported to have stated that he did not object to the use of emergency contraception in the case of rape if the victim requests it.[35] He opposes embryonic stem cell research[36] and voted against increasing federal funding to expand embryonic stem cell lines.[33]      Same-sex marriage      Jindal opposes the legalization of same-sex marriage, and has voted for the Federal Marriage Amendment to restrict marriage to a union between one man and one woman.[37] In December 2008, Jindal announced the formation of the Louisiana Commission on Marriage and Family, including individuals representing organizations that oppose same-sex marriage, including Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, Gene Mills, the executive director of the Louisiana Family Forum and Mike Johnson, senior legal counsel for the Alliance Defense Fund.[38]      Tax policy      As a private citizen, Jindal voted for the "Stelly Tax plan",[39] a referendum named for former state Representative Vic Stelly of Lake Charles, which swapped some sales taxes for higher income taxes. Whether or not the "Stelly Plan" is giving the desired results is still hotly debated statewide. Early Republican challenger Steve Scalise challenged Jindal on his vote for this tax plan before Scalise dropped out of the congressional race in 2004. As Governor, Jindal initially opposed reforms to the Stelly plan that would result in over $300 million in tax cuts. He later agreed to the tax cut after the legislature appeared headed to eliminating the entire personal income tax which Jindal also opposed.[40] Talk show host Moon Griffon subsequently refused to air radio ads paid for by the organization Believe in Louisiana crediting Jindal for Stelly reforms saying "Now, they are taking credit for the biggest income tax cut in the history of Louisiana and I felt like it was a lie. To be real blunt, very misleading and it was an outright lie because he had fought hard against it".[40]      Civil liberties      Jindal voted yes on making the PATRIOT Act permanent, voted in favor of the 2006 Military Commissions Act, supported a constitutional amendment banning flag burning,[41] and voted for the Real ID Act of 2005.[42] Jindal has an "A" rating from Gun Owners of America.[43]      Health care      Jindal also supports co-payments in Medicaid.[44]      Offshore drilling      In 2006, Jindal sponsored the Deep Ocean Energy Resources Act (H.R. 4761), a bill to eliminate the moratorium on offshore oil and gas drilling over the U.S. outer continental shelf, which prompted the watchdog group Republicans for Environmental Protection to issue him "an environmental harm demerit".[45] Jindal's 2006 rating from that organization was -4, among the lowest in Congress. The nonpartisan League of Conservation Voters also censured Jindal for securing passage of H.R. 4761 in the House of Representatives; the group rated his environmental performance that year at seven percent, citing anti-environment votes on 11 out of 12 critical issues. Jindal's lifetime score from the League of Conservation Voters is seven percent.[46] Despite claims that Jindal's bill was successful,[47] H.R. 4761 was replaced by S 3711 (known as the Domenici-Landrieu Fair Share Plan). The original Senate version was passed by both houses of Congress and signed by President Bush.[48]      Earmarks      In 2007, Jindal led the Louisiana delegation in Congressional earmark funding. According to Taxpayers for Common Sense, in 2007, Jindal's earmark funding was 14th among all Congressmen.[49] As Governor in 2008, Jindal used his line item veto to strike $16 million in earmarks from the state budget while allowing $30 million in legislator added spending.[50]      Intelligent design      Jindal supports the teaching of "intelligent design" in public schools.[51] Despite calls for a veto from groups as diverse as the the Roman Catholic Church, the ACLU, the National Review, and Jindal's own biology professors at Brown University.[52] Jindal signed the Louisiana Academic Freedom Act in 2008.      Crime and punishment      On June 25, 2008, Jindal signed the "Sex Offender Chemical Castration Bill", authorizing the chemical castration of those convicted of certain sex offenses.[53]      Jindal has also voted against giving the federal government jurisdiction to help local law enforcement with hate violence based on sexual orientation, gender identity, gender and disability.[54]

Why is Senator Robery Byrd (D-WV) the longest serving Democrat in government, gravely concerned about Barry Obama's abuse of the office of the president?      From Politico      "In a letter to Obama on Wednesday, Byrd complained about Obama’s decision to create White House offices on health reform, urban affairs policy, and energy and climate change. Byrd said such positions “can threaten the Constitutional system of checks and balances. At the worst, White House staff have taken direction and control of programmatic areas that are the statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials.”      Even the longest serving Democrat thinks Barry is making an unconstitutional, and therefore illegal, power grab.

20090225083455AAwrY1u	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How to handle former employer owing me money?	ok, I got laid off Dec 23rd...over the phone, they told me that they were paying me until the end of the year, and because they laid me off right before Christmas, i still had about a weeks worth of vacation pay that they pay back if you don't use it.      I got my last paycheck, and it did not include the week that they said they were paying me for, as well as the vacation pay. I let my boss know and she said it was being taken care of, and keeps putting it off saying the HR guy is out of town. I've been trying to get this money for like a month and I'm starting to feel like I'm being ignored. What can I do???
20090225083527AAXAf3G	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	How Do I Press Charges?	My ex boyfriend came to my house and choked and strangled me multiple times, slapped me, beat my head against things and pushed me over furniture. I did call the police on him because i could not get him to leave my house. When I called them he got afraid and left my house, but the police found him in bed asleep at his house and he was taken to jail, I wasnt sure if that counted as me pressing charges or not. The officers did take some pictures of the knots, bruises and marks on my neck, and I think my ex's mom has gotten him an attourney. I was also wondering if I would have to attend a court date to testify against him, I just dont know what is going on right now with this situation and I dont know if I should call my local police department and ask them. I do know that I want to prove to everyone that he did it to me, because he is telling people that I did it to myself. I feel like doing all that I can to prove that he did it to me.

20090227123025AAn1ieL	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Can Republicans not speak proper English?	I am an independent, but I'm also a stickler for grammar and this irritates me to no end. Whenever Republicans go on TV to criticize their ideological opponents, they always refer to the "Democrat Congress", "Democrat policies", "Democrat elected officials", etc.       The word Democrat is a NOUN - it should not be used to modify another noun. The ADJECTIVE form of this word is Democratic. Thus, when you criticize Obama's spending, you should refer to the Democratic Congress, the Democratic tax-and-spend policies, etc.      Surely I'm not the only one who has noticed this. Maybe it's because Republican is the same in both the noun and adjective form? They just carry that grammar usage over to the other parties?

During that whole time he has had a lawyer, and the lawyer told him that if I write a letter convincingly enough to immigration stating that our marriage was real and the he deserves his permanent green card, that he might get it.    I don't know what to do, I don't answer his email, but at the same time I feel bad for his baby,    What worries me is that if he gets deported , his baby will remain in the us, and he makes it seem like its gonna be my fault.   My question is should I write the notarized letter for him and send it to immigration , or should i just ignore him.   I dont know if im being selfish, I dont wanna go to jail, even though ive been divorced 3 years now.

Most made some mention of her wanting to repeal the 19th Amendment. Here's a quote I found on a blog:       Conservative pundits supported this view, with Anne Coulter pushing to repeal the 19th Amendment.   “Look, women are too liberal to be allowed to vote. I won’t miss voting at all, and I’m a woman. Any man who thinks women should have the vote must be a fa&&ot, or a communist. Besides, how many of you really think a Saudi King is going to allow elections? He’s been promising elections to his own people for years and somehow they never get around to it. Get a clue, you boobs, nobody’s going to be voting anymore. It’s Unamerican to vote. That’s why the majority of Americans don’t bother.”      If she believes that, does SHE vote?       I'm just curious. She doesn't really get under my skin much, as the summaries of all her books seem to be, as they say, a load of dingoes' kidneys. No editorials, please.

20081009094110AAs6lgu	Politics & Government;Elections	Why is Mcain so much like Bush?	McCain has 20 years of experience more than Bush      McCain has REAL war experience, not pontoon boating in Texas       McCain has a brain and can think for himself, instead of pre-written speeches and teleprompter reading      McCain has relationships with world leaders      McCain wasn't the "Golden Child" of the Republicans because he worked closely with democrats on issues as well.       Interesting... Bush has more in common with Obama than McCain does. Maybe my question should be, "Why is Obama so much like Bush?"      By the way, saying McCain voted so heavily with Bush is NOT a valid arguement... A LOT of what they agreed on was limiting financial earmarks that the democrats are typically supporters of, and Obama is well known for.

They call me "socialist" for wanting to make sure that those who are not as fortunate as me are taken care of. Maybe I am misunderstanding, but is that supposed to be a bad thing? We help people throughout the world with our tax dollars. How would helping people at home in our country who are in need be considered "evil"?

The only countries that field state of the art fighters are mostly allies, with a couple of exceptions.   It would seem that the only way for fighter pilots to score enough kills in actual dog fights or squaring off in fighter to fighter combat would be in the form of training flights.   Would a single shot from a fighter's gun be enough to disable a foe's fighter? Considering most fighters hose their targets in bursts of fire from their vulcan.   Which fighters still carry auto-cannon? As MIGs used to have them, but are there any MIG's in service today?      Do any of the friendly nations who have their own Air Force/Naval fighters, square off for the purpose of keeping their pilot's fighter skills honed or do they just keep their training in house?

20081006120255AAufJmy	Politics & Government;Elections	Castro endorses Obama?	To echo the sentiments of the brilliant and non-corrupt minds of amazing men such as William Ayers, Barney Frank, and Jeremiah Wright, Fidel Castro has released his own endorsement of Barack Obama:      he calls Barack Obama “the most advanced candidate” in the race. (That’s the English translation as provided by Associated Press and Reuters; the Granma English-language site translates his characterization as “this strong candidate.” The article in the original Spanish is here.)      “I feel no resentment towards him, for he is not responsible for the crimes perpetrated against Cuba and humanity,” Castro wrote. “Were I to defend him, I would do his adversaries an enormous favor.”      That makes perfect sense. If Obama wins, we’ll all enjoy the fantastic quality of life the Cubans have!      But hey, they’re finally allowed cell phones (the restrictions on medical care, food, and speech still stand) so they *must* be making progress.      Any time people are willing to float across shark-infested oceans in makeshift boats to escape their government, it should send up a red flag.      It speaks volumes about Obama’s envisioned “change” for America that Castro is so fond of him.         Does this make you as excited as so many others to vote for Obama?

Those who think Obama';s tax plan is in their benefit, those who believe his tax deduction for 95% is a great idea.  Go into work today and ask your employer   What is their plan if their business taxes are increased?   How much does the Company make per year?      I can bet most employers will say, we will have to either cut jobs, cut hours, cut benefits AND increase product cost.      So if you work for lets say a Car Wash or even the company that makes the shammies that the car wash uses, if the car wash owner cuts jobs and increases the cost of a car wash, gets what happens?     1.   Less people visiting car wash   2.   Cost of car wash goes up   3.  people working in the factory where shammies work less   4.  Delivery driver that delivers them works less   5.   They business owner has less money to go out and buy new cars and tvs,     SO....   Now those that work at the car dealerships work less, those that sell tv's work less, the delivery driver of cars or tv's works less   SO...   Now the car manufacturers continue to lay off, and tv manufacturers lay off..   And on and on and on.      Does anyone else see this?  Please ask your employer today.

The way Obama sounds we are all eating from soup lines and digging out of garbage cans and have no shelter. I pay my mortgage, live on a budget, save when I can, kids are clothed, house has heated, no credit card debt and life is good! There is not a single person I know that has lost a job because of the economy.      Not my fault if there are those who choose to live beyond their means, drink, smoke, get their nails done, buy designer cloths, buy cars they can not afford, run up their credit cards, don't save for hard times and then complain how badly they are doing when those bad times roll around.       Call me heartless if you choose. I was raised to take care of myself and my family without relying on the government to fund programs to "save" me. If I needed "saving" I'd get a second job or a third.

I have trained with many military and law enforcement training companies. I usually out shoot every one I train with.      I graduated from a top level university with a descent gpa.      My downside is that I am not that aggressive and I would say that I suffer from some depression. I am thinking that maybe it is because right now I feel like I am doing nothing living the nine to five job and working out. I don't have a higher purpose in life right now and I think I should be serving my country.      I have barely a speeding ticket, I have never done drugs, and barely drink.

Guess what? John McCain is a liar: John McCain told the Des Moines Register this week that he always tells "100 percent absolute truth," even in campaign ads. There's one big problem with that bold statement: it's just not true. McCain has made a number of statements &mdash... in paid ads and on the campaign trail — that simply cannot be described as 100 percent accurate. Some aren't even close.

I would be offended by everyone talking about her experience. She is the only one of the 4 that has executive experience.      Obama:  State Senate 6 years and voted present 130 times, US Senate for almost 3 years, 2 of which he has been running for president. No Executive experience      Biden 30+ years as a senator. Never ran a company or govt. No Executive experience      McCain Military experience then alomost 30 years as a senator. No Executive experience      Palin 4 years on the city council. 6 years as mayor (Executive) and 2 years as governor (Executive). She has had to make decisions and lead. None of the rest has.

Why is it that whenever people talk about the upcoming election they always regurgitate the same stupid cliches about their candidate of choice. If they support Obama it is because he is "about change" or "supports the middle class" or "Mccain is more of the same".  It is always the same crap from both sides. I dont know as much as I should about politics, but I know I am sick of hearing people blab about the same crap as if they know what they are talking about.

After all this I finally had it he doesn't have any bills to pay, as he lives at home with his mother (his 20 by the way) and he does work part time. He says that he is in debt with people but still managed to buy the Iphone 2 and a couple other things he wants.      Now the hard part I know him since 2nd grade so it's kinda hard to go threw with this but i believe he is taking advantage of me. Now I only see 2 ways of going about with this anymore.       1. Talk to his mom and tell her whats going on, ( I don't believe this is right since we are both adults and it really doesn't involve her, plus she works her behind of to make ends meat)      or      2.

20090307014353AAW1PvZ	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Am I in legal trouble?	Here's what happened:      I love my girlfriend and we are planning to spend the rest of our lives with each other. I just started college and she's still in high school, so she's not 18 yet.      Her parents (mostly her dad) doesn't allow her to hang out with friends, go out or anything. She's basically incarcerated in her own home (yes its REALLY bad)      They didn't know about me, until they found out that she ditched school to be with me the whole day since we NEVER get to hang out unless she ditches school once a month or so. We just hung out and talked since I rarely get to see her and we love each other so much.      I want to know if I am in legal trouble? We didn't have sex or anything, we just talked about our lives, feelings, etc.       Supposedly I am since I helped her ditch. But I mean, people that ditch or help ditch can't be in legal trouble. And I didn't help her: she asked me if I could pick her up.      Also, he REALLY hates me, so I was wondering if I can be sent to jail if he says I had sex with her? The AP at her school asked her this and some cop and she said no, so I was off the hook. But if her dad files a complaint, can I be prosecuted or does SHE have to say it?       He might file a restraining order too.      [I don't need advice about how I have to stay away from her or whatnot. I just need legal counseling].

Singapura, Malaysia dan Brunei masih menerapkan hukuman cambuk untuk orang melakukan pelanggaran berat atas hukum di negara2 tersebut. Implementasi hukuman ini sangat efektif untuk mencegah kejahatan yang bakal terjadi (khususnya di Singapura). Silahkan simak di :       http://www.corpun.com/singfeat.htm       Nah kita tahu di Indonesia, kejahatan korupsi merupakan hal yang sangat sulit untuk diberantas, bahkan ada anggota DPR yang lagi diproses di KPK atas korupsinya .... eh ada pula anggota DPR yang lain malah masih berani korupsi dan ambil uang tunai di Money Changer.      Nampaknya EFEK JERA dengan ancaman hukuman badan belum membawa hasil, para koruptor yang masih punya uang banyak merasa yakin bahwa mereka bisa cincai, hingga bisa tetap hidup bebas setelah diputus untuk dihukum penjara.      Anda pasti ada yang berargumen HAM, tapi ingat kita sedang berhadapan dengan koruptor yang sekaligus pelanggar HAM berat, dimana kelakuannya telah menyengsarakan rakyat (kelaparan, penyakit dll yang mengakibatkan kesengsaraan rakyat bahkan kematian).

Jesus, keep cheering on these people that have $500 million in the bank!      As far as I know, you have to earn below $30,000 to 50,000 to be considered broke in most parts of the country. Do you really think it's going to hurt rich people if they get taxed more? You have to do it people, too many rich people hurts trade. When trade is hurt, even the rich people's existing businesses will get clobbered.      America will turn into Latin America with this kind of economic thinking. Even basketball is a team game. I think people just don't understand how an economy works. We all have something to contribute to the economy. No one wants to stay on welfare, and the fact that people do want to stay on it says that the local economy doesn't provide jobs that pay much better than it.       Encouraging and cheering rich people on is a recipe for destruction. You're telling people who have a net worth FAR above $30-50K that it's acceptable to make even MORE money! That will destroy an economy!      And it's a myth that more wealth is being created everyday. Where are you people getting this from? America has a HUGE trade imbalance. We're LOSING wealth! We would be gaining it if there were more production jobs exporting products overseas! That's how wealth really grows!

You can only have one king in every country; everyone thinks that they are the king now.      I predict democracy is going to be finished soon. Too many people are abusing their freedoms. Things are out of control out there. It's getting ridiculous. People need to be ruled and subjugated. It's a fact of life.      I think democracy is going to end in my lifetime. It might end sooner because of the economic crisis. I wouldn't be surprised if many people embraced the end of democracy either. If you can't maintain a democracy in wartime, why should it be maintained in peace? That makes no sense!

20081214194615AAYFQ6a	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Adakah celah untuk menuntut Operator Seluler Indonesia?	Di luar negeri (terutama Amerika Serikat), para pengusaha harus ekstra hati-hati. Salah sedikit bisa kena tuntut. Sedangkan di Indonesia, Operator Seluler (terutama Big Three: Satelindo, Indosat, dan XL) justru yang paling memberikan contoh yang tidak benar.   Berkali-kali mereka memasang iklan yang tidak jujur.      Contoh:   "Dari pagi ketemu pagi tetap Rp 0,1 per detik. murahnya tarif Rp 0,1 per detik SEHARIAN!"      Apakah di sini ada pakar logika? Jika 130 detik pertama tarifnya Rp 15, maka Indosat tidak boleh menulis Rp 0,1 PER DETIK SEHARIAN.      "Rp 0,1 Perdetik seharian" artinya selama 86400 detik nonstop, sejak pukul 00:00:00 sampai pukul 23:59:59 tarifnya Rp 0,1.      Jika secara logika iklan di atas salah, maka Indosat bisa dikatakan menipu. Jika Indosat menipu, sebaiknya masyarakat melakukan tuntutan ke pengadilan, lalu jika menang, uangnya untuk kesejahteraan rakyat, misalnya untuk  membiayai pembangunan telepon umum yang murah di desa-desa, dsb.      Saya yakin, di sini banyak mahasiswa hukum. Daripada turun ke jalan demo bakar-bakar ban (yang bisa dilakukan oleh siapa saja, termasuk tukang becak yang tidak pernah sekolah), lebih baik tunjukkan kemampuan dan intelektual dengan cara menuntut perusahaan-perusahaan yang seenak dhewe.

20090227123831AAyxANL	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How do I settle an auto accident without a lawyer?  How much should I expect?	One year ago I was in an auto accident.  My friend was driving apparently to slow for the driver behind us and was we started to pull into a parking lot they decided to speed up and try to pass us by using the sidewalk. We were hit at my door and I was turned looking at my friend in the back seat.  The police cited her and her ins has accepted 100% fault.  I went to the ER for head (I hit the door window) and neck pain and fallowed up with my doc.  Since then I have had 3 months PT (he said he could not fix me) and still see the chiro.  I had 2 MRI, CAT and several x-rays. I was placed on medications including: Valium, Percocet and Oxycodone initially but after a week asked for something weaker and went to hydrocodone which still left me sleepy so I went to IBfrofin 800, meloxican and Skelaxin. Seen a back specialist too.  All agree with my doctor that my SI joint is messed up and my chiro put my back at 20% permanently damaged and will need to see him once a month forever  My bills are about 9,000.  I don't want a lawyer to take money from my pain so I don't want to have one.  Now that it has been a year and my doctors say I am as good as I am going to get I was to settle.  What should I do?  Is there a form I can give my doctors to fill out?      Also I was 12 weeks pregnant and ended up having him at 22 weeks in which he died right after birth.  With everything that happen the month after and all the medications could this have been a cause?  My doctor that delivered him says he can't tell me the reason I went into early labor.  I was on seasonal and didn't know I was pregnant till 16 weeks .

My father filed a petition for me and my sister last 1996, but, since she's under 21 yrs old, she got a chance to go there. That time, I was single and already 21 years old when the petition was filed. After years have past, I received two letters from NVC last January 14 & 15,2009. The first letter contains DS-3032 form, the second letter states that I am a son of a US citizen under 21 years and I need to submit missing documents, but there were no documents mentioned. I'm already married since 2004 and having a single child and I'm here in the middle east as an overseas worker. Is the petition still valid? What actions should I take?

I was on a site where the members usually do things that are illogical and the only reason I used logic in the first place was to be prepared. Anyhow, someone stated a fallacy arguing something about me, I pointed out the fallacy. I stated that I was using logic but they said I wasn't. I had continued to state the fallacies and I asked "What did I do that was wrong?" He had stated "You're being an asshole." All I was doing was stating fallacies. Anyhow, I stated that he was using ad hominem and not even depicting what I was doing wrong. I didn't break any of the rules on the site. Was him banning me just? Isn't pointing out the flaws within an argument a part of logic? Someone stated, and I quote "You're not using logic, you were just being stupid."

He had almost six years of economic growth including increased employment numbers. The economy started heading south after Nazi Pelosi and Dingy Harry took the reins of government into their hands.       True, Bush didn't veto the bills that he should have, but isn't this really the Democrats economy? And since Nobama was supposedly in the Senate at the time, missing as usual, but a member none the less, it IS HIS ECONOMY and he really inherited it from himself?      Give me one piece of evidence that Nobama is not just Pelosi's trained flying monkey, and that this is anything but her economy, Dingy Harry's and oh yes, the other Democrat John McCain's.

I'm scheduled to go to traffic court next month for a speeding ticket and was wondering if anyone could give me some pointers?  This time, it's before the District Attorney.  Yikes!          First, I lost the Trial By Declaration (written trial), then I lost the appeal even though 1.) the cop misidentified my car as the wrong make in the written trial which the judge said wasn't admissible because "I didn't like the decision and this was a new trial, the old trial was thrown out" ***cough, cough, BS***, 2.) incorrectly said I was a lone driver when I had a passenger/witness, 3.) stated he was by himself when there was another cop on duty with him, and 4.) didn't have any of the records I requested in court (maintenance log for radar/training certificates).  This trial happened 6 months after the incident occur and there's no way he could've remembered as much as I did and his testimony proved it.  Anyway, I think I'm getting shafted but if you have any "legal" suggestions, similiar experiences, or advice it'd be greatly appreciated.  Either way I'm going to fight this thing.

20090306214728AAXHxsY	Politics & Government;Politics	Is the Obama Administration the most brazenly deceptive White House staff ever?	WASHINGTON -- Forget the pork. Forget the waste. Forget the 8,570 earmarks in a bill supported by a president who poses as the scourge of earmarks. Forget the "$2 trillion dollars in savings" that "we have already identified," $1.6 trillion of which President Obama's budget director later admits is the "savings" of not continuing the surge in Iraq until 2019 -- 11 years after George Bush ended it, and eight years after even Bush would have had us out of Iraq completely.       Forget all of this. This is run-of-the-mill budget trickery. True, Obama's tricks come festooned with strings of zeros tacked onto the end. But that's a matter of scale, not principle.       All presidents do that. But few undertake the kind of brazen deception at the heart of Obama's radically transformative economic plan, a rhetorical sleight of hand so smoothly offered that few noticed.

20090306165424AARPslg	Politics & Government;Politics	Will the Obama recovery follow the pattern of the New Deal?	The New Deal took a while to work.  In 1933, the year FDR took office, the GDP shrunk by 1.3%.  This was a drastic improvement over the 13% contraction in 1932, but still a slowdown. The stimulus took a while to work.  In the remaining 7 years prior to US involvement in WWII the GDP posted substantial gains in every year except 1938 - a resounding success of the New Deal.  Employment, which was severely depressed, didn't fully recover until the massive additional government spending of the war effort spurred even larger GDP gains in 1941-43.      Our unemployment is less severe, as is the recent GDP contraction (6.2% in the last quarter of 2008), but I expect the pattern to be similar:  steady GDP gains, with employment somewhat lagging.  Do you think it will be otherwise, and why?          http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Tabl...

Shouldn't CEOs, who are much more educated and intelligent than the average worker be rewarded more for their hard work and determination?       I think it is an outrage that workers get paid so much. The average worker is replaceable, CEOs are not. Good CEOs are going to leave the country at this rate, especially with the increases to the capital gains tax.

I'm in Michigan and need some help.I can't afford a lawyer,not that I need one but I can't seem to get through to the cops.they just don't seem to care. what can I do? if I go take her they'll get me for kidnapping,even though I have court ordered custody.I filed all the correct motions but time is running out.I'm extremely desperate.
20090306180602AAbK5gN	Politics & Government;Politics	A question about the stimulus and jobs?	1)  President Obama said that this money would create or save 3.5 million jobs.      2)  He said that it is a stimulus and not spending and it would all be spent in one year.      Given these two facts would a sure sign that this spending actually created or saved 3.5 million jobs would be that when the money runs out in 14-18 months we see 3.5 million people suddenly unemployed.      Even if they get new jobs we should still see a large spike.      Am I correct on this?

Also, i know it's against the bible for gay marriage, but i thought the government wasn't supposed to be run by the church...      i'm a straight Christian, but i believe in equality, so i was just wondering if it is actually illegal to ban gay marriage since it's against the Declaration..      thanks..

And I'm voting for Obama, and he indeed looks like a monkey! Calm down black people!

20090306174632AArjh8a	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Right to access for landlords. Is my privacy being violated?	I live in Vermont.  Vermont law is written ambigiously.       The landlord is allowed "reasonable access" to "inspect" with 48 hours "notice".      My landlord has been in my condo 5 times in 2.5 months. Once every two to three weeks on average   My landlord was there on Dec 13 when he gave me the keys. he was there again the following week to remove items from the closets he left behind as agreed. He was there three weeks later to "get some books" he left behind.  While he was there he went into another room and looked in my closet. All of these times were agreed upon. Three weeks after that he left 6 messages within two days on my VM saying he was coming to inspect. I was away. We never made contact. I came home to find he had been there, without my knowledge and filmed the apartment. I also "know" he was there a few days before on President's day without telling me (4 days before his last "inspection" things leaning against the door he uses were no longer leaning on that door) but I can't prove it. After the last inspection he came again a week later to inspect again.      My question is: Does notice mean he has to speak with me, or does a message on an answering machine count?      Also: It is a furnished apartment. I moved to twin beds to accomodate my treadmill. he says this is a lease violation. The lease does not say furniture moving is prohibited.      He claims it is "dirty"- the realtor came and inspected and there was no dust or grime anywhere in the apartment and nothing lying around. he had come in when the floors needed a vacuming. Is this unreasonable of him?      He claims cigarette butts on the garage floor (there is no smoking taking place inside the premisis) are a violation. There is nothing about smoking at all in the lease.      My lease says he has to give me 24 hous notice. VT law says 48 hours. Does the law trump the lease, or have I limited my rights by signing a lease that says 24 hours?      He has a different excuse every time- to reclaim things left behind, to show the apartment (which is false, he comes alone with no realtor or perspective tebants and boldly says he is inspecting) Is he violating my rights?      Is this harassment?  IS HE the one in violation? Is 5 times in 2.5 months enough for him to be satisfied that his house has not been burned down or whatever?

20090306171543AADcJyy	Politics & Government;Immigration	Does an infant need a passport and visa to move to a country one of its parents are from?	I plan on moving to England next year to live with and marry my soon to be fiance, and we also plan on having a child within 2 years of me being there. We also plan on moving back to the states within a few months of having the child to be closer to my family. Now here's the questions.      1. Since the child is born to an American citizen (living in the UK on a spouse visa who is still an American citizen) and to an English citizen (born there and lived there his entire life), would the child have duel citizenship, or would the child only be a citizen in England?      2. Once we decide to move back to the states (the child would be up to a few months old), do we have to fill out a visa for the child? if so, what kind of visa? It would be a permanent move (for at least 10+ years), we would have a sponsor if need be (my parents) and a place to live, neither me, my then husband and our child would have to rely on the gov't for money at all.       3. Also, when we are getting ready to move, would we need to get the child (up to a few months old) a passport as well? I'm guessing yes, and an English passport, but would like a more defenant answer.       4. What other information should we look into regarding moving with an infant from England to the United States?         Thanks very much :)

20090306173705AABrmgB	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	NEED LEGAL ADVICE! Whose responsibility is installing a carbon monoxide detector?	My family and I are renting the basement of a very expensive historic home, one of many properties my landlord owns.  This particular house is up for sale, and they wanted to rent the basement to make extra money until it's sold.  The entire place runs on gas, and our primary source of heat is a gas fireplace, because the furnace does not heat the basement.  They are aware of this, which is why they installed the fireplace years ago when they were living there.  They have acknowledged in the past that it is our source of heat.      The fireplace is very old and has had trouble staying lit during the last couple months.  We've informed the landlord of this, and it has not been fixed.  So it's no surprise that the other day, it finally malfunctioned and began releasing deadly levels of CO during the night.  Luckily, I'd installed a CO detector when we moved in, and we were woken up by it and called the fire department.  They disabled it, and the paper they gave us said not to use it at all and have it replaced immediately.      First question:  Are property owners responsible for installing fire and carbon monoxide detectors in the apartments they are renting to people?  If I, the tenant, had never purchased a detector, we would be dead now.      Now they're saying they don't plan to fix the fireplace because we "won't need it for much longer" and they "don't know what cost they will be getting into."  Unfortunately for us, it's still cold outside.  At night, our apartment is freezing.  We pay for utilities with the rent, so we pay for the use of the now-broken fireplace.      So my second question is: aren't they supposed to fix it if we're paying for the heat that comes from it, especially since it's our only actual heat source?      I'm being serious when I say that at night, it's extremely cold in our apartment (we live right on a river).      I have a 2 year old daughter, and for that reason I'm furious that they won't fix this problem.      In case it matters, we're in the state of WV.      Thanks in advance for any answers or advice!
