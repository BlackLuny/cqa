McDonald's seem to be quite busy in Gujarat, specially in Surat city it self.<br>  <br>  I went to Bandra, Mumbai quite a few times and they were mostly busy. <br>  <br>  You know in India, two people are eating and 5 people are there for nothing. So may be that is why restaurants look busy. I don't know. I haven't seen the cashier.

1Mc6BOvKaa	I worked for Odeon in one of their multiplexes in the Midlands, but using the "skills" I got there, I managed to land a job with Royal Mail in London - a real step up the economic food chain for me. <br>  <br>  <br>  I worked in projection, so maybe a bit different, but I did assist in the "front of house" roles when it got busy.<br>  <br>  My advice is to keep it concise on a CV, but bullet point all of the particular skills you can highlight, explaining in some detail only where necessary. Also try and connect to how this will help in any further jobs. Example:<br>  <br>  <br>  Jan 2008 - Feb 2009<br>  Odeon Cinemas (UK) - Cinema Attendant <br>  I fulfilled a number of "Front of House" Roles, including:<br>  -> Cashier - Cash handling, customer services<br>  -> Cleanliness <br>  -> Information - Phonecall handling and data processing<br>  -> Usher - Customer management<br>  -> General Skills - multitasking, time management<br>  I have shown my trustworthiness in handling cash and my people skills in my customer services roles.<br>  <br>  <br>  This isn't ideal, just an example, but something for you to work from.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Being concise in a CV is good, as long as you can elaborate in an interview and it looks like you can. Also make sure that in the CV you highlight any skills directly relevant to the job you're going for (either by deleting any irrelevant skills or by moving the least relevant to the bottom).<br>  When I went for my Royal Mail job, I made a big deal out of the time keeping, teamwork, and position of trust/responsibility parts of my own time at the cinema. For you, I suggest you focus on people skills and information management.<br>  <br>  Good luck - let me know if this helps!
w88Sijh1aa	Both companies are large and offer good benefits as you can see if you follow the links below.<br>  As far your personality and comfort zone, as best I can tell, that you described, I would think Sprouts may fit you best.<br>  I say this because Staples is in a highly competitive field and you really have to keep up with fast changing technology. They also try to keep their workforce slim due to overhead and competition.<br>  I think Sprouts is best because in their field, technology doesn't change so once you learn their products then you know them well and it will be consistent if you choose to change jobs in the same field. As you know, people always need food and Sprouts is popular.<br>  Also, at a food store, people don't often have buyers remorse and angrily try to return items that they can't figure out.<br>  Good luck on your decision.|`|AZPxEhL3aa	stein garden and gifts<br>  more benefits
KykXuKAKaa	Refer <a href="http://www.techpackdesign.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.techpackdesign.com</a><br>  <br>  TECHPACK IS A DOCUMENT THAT <br>  contains all the details of any specific style of the garment. This document is usually prepared by the designer and finalised in consultation with the merchandisers, and then forwarded to bulk sampling department or to the production department for the reference and guide for bulk manufacturing.<br>  THE OBJECTIVE<br>  The Objective here is, once techpack for any style is frozen, the production department must be able to go ahead with the manufacturing process without having to refer back to the designer for any aspect of production. The merchandisers are thus able to go ahead and ensure that the required material as per the techpack is made available to the production department, in the right quantities at the right time. The marketing department can use this document in their presentation, particularly to the large format stores and their key customers. The preparation of a techpack and using it to manage and co-ordinate various activities in production brings in efficiency within the company as, various departments refers to the common document for discussion or carrying out any activity.<br>  Almost all garment manufacturing companies prepare a techpack. In many cases, the cutting instructions or job card issued to production acts as the techpack. However, the details given in the techpack are likely to vary with the sizes of the company. Large manufacturing companies generally have a detailed techpack for each of the styles under production, for the simple reason that any manufacturing that is not in line with what was desired results in a huge production loss. For exporters, preparation of a techpack is almost mandatory, as the buyers prefer to sign on the techpack before placing the order or would send in a techpack themselves.

See Below:<br>  <br>  Medicaid for Pregnant Women <br>  <br>  The State of Florida has several programs designed to provide Medicaid for pregnant women. When determining eligibility for pregnant women, the unborn child is always counted when looking at the income limit for the family. Women that are found eligible for Medicaid remain eligible throughout the pregnancy and for the two months following the birth of the child, as long as the mother remains a resident of Florida. The baby will automatically receive the first year of Medicaid. <br>  <br>  For more information, please see the Family-Related Medicaid Factsheet. (Page 10) <br>  <br>  There are three ways to apply: <br>  <br>  1. Presumptively Eligible Pregnant Women (PEPW): A temporary coverage for prenatal care only. For more information, please see the Family-Related Medicaid Factsheet. (Page 9) <br>  <br>  2. Simplified Eligibility for Pregnant Women (SEPW): A simplified “full coverage” for pregnant women only. To apply, please complete the one page application linked below. Print the application and mail, fax or return it in person to the nearest ACCESS office: (English)  (Spanish)  (Creole). <br>  <br>  3. ACCESS application: This is an application for “regular” Medicaid, including children, cash assistance and/or food stamps. Please visit this link to begin: <a href="http://www.myflorida.com/accessflorida/." rel="nofollow">http://www.myflorida.com/accessflorida/.</a> <br>  <br>  Women over the income limit for Medicaid, may qualify for the Medically Needy Program.

This first write-up is taken from Hulda Clarkís book, "The Cure for All Diseases," pages 529-530.]  <br>  A small plastic dishpan, about 10" x 12"  <br>  A glass or enamel 2-quart saucepan  <br>  1 can of lye (sodium hydroxide), 12 ounces  <br>  3 pounds of lard  <br>  Plastic gloves [really; use eye-protection too]  <br>  Water <br>  <br>  1. Pour 3 cups of very cold water (refrigerate water overnight first) into the 2-quart saucepan.  <br>  2. Slowly and carefully add the lye, a little bit at a time, stirring it with the a wooden or plastic utensil. (Use plastic gloves for this; test them for holes first.) Do not breathe the vapor or lean over the container or have children nearby. Above all _use no metal_. The mixture will get very hot. In olden days, a sassafras branch was used to stir, imparting a fragrance and insect deterrent for mosquitoes, lice, fleas and ticks.  <br>  3. Let cool at least one hour in a safe place. Meanwhile, the unwrapped lard should be warming up to room temperature in the plastic dishpan.  <br>  4. Slowly and carefully, pour the lye solution into the dishpan with the lard. The lard will melt. Mix thoroughly, at least 15 minutes, until it looks like thick pudding.  <br>  5. Let it set until the next morning, then cut it into bars. It will get harder after a few days. Then package.  <br>  <br>  If you wish to make soap based on olive oil, use about 48 ounces. It may need to harden for a week.|`|NqWl2qlPaa	You can go to a hobby shop and buy glycerin soap cubes, dye, and scent.  Buy some molds too.

They will dry and then you have soap.

Remember, lye is dangerous and can cause severe burns. <br>  Make soap<br>  <br>  Step1<br>  <br>  Take the weighing scale and place a plastic container on the scale. <br>  <br>  Step2<br>  <br>  Add water in the container and carefully mix in lye in 1:3 ratios. For e.g. For 11 ounces of lye use nearly 33 ounces of water to mix it. Remember to add lye to water and not vice versa. <br>  <br>  Step3<br>  <br>  Be very cautious as lye emits lot of heat and fumes when mixed with water. Therefore, mix the lye and water in an open place as the fumes can be dangerous when inhaled. <br>  <br>  Step4<br>  <br>  Let the lye cool down. This will take around two to three hours. Ideally, prepare the lye mixture one day in advance and leave it at room temperature. <br>  <br>  Step5<br>  <br>  Measure the lard and oils and pour them in a stainless steel or enameled container. <br>  <br>  Step6<br>  <br>  Put the container on the stove and heat it slowly till the fats melt and form a uniform mixture. <br>  <br>  Step7<br>  <br>  Stir gently and use the thermometer to check whether the mixture has reached the ideal temperature, which will be between 120 and 130 degrees Fahrenheit. <br>  <br>  Step8<br>  <br>  Add the lye mixture to the fats carefully and slowly. Use a spoon to mix the solution while you are pouring lye. <br>  <br>  Step9<br>  <br>  Stir the mixture well using a stick blender and spoon alternately for short spans. For e.g. If you have used blender for 1 minute, follow it with mixing with spoon for nearly the same time. Do not use the blender continually for longer duration. <br>  <br>  Step10<br>  <br>  Note that the texture of this mixture will start changing in some time; say in about 5 minutes. It will become thicker and more opaque. This is soap in liquid form. <br>  <br>  Step11<br>  <br>  Measure out the fragrance and add it to this mixture and stir again with a spoon. <br>  <br>  Step12<br>  <br>  Add 1 oz. coloring dye if you want to add some color to the bland soap mixture. Use the blender to mix the color uniformly. <br>  Mold soap<br>  <br>  Step1<br>  <br>  Pour the mixture into the plastic molds immediately and let it cool down. <br>  <br>  Step2<br>  <br>  Let the mixture sit at room temperature for 24 hours. You will know that the mixture has condensed if its temperature has dropped down to the roam temperature. It may be still a little warm to touch, which is fine. <br>  <br>  Step3<br>  <br>  Remove the soap bars from the molds. They should pop right off, but you may need to twist the tray a little so that they may come off. <br>  Step4<br>  <br>  Still struggling? Put the molds with the soap mixture in the freezer for 2 to three hours. Take it out and use a blow dryer on the back side of the mold for a few seconds to dislodge the soap. This will make the soap come off instantly.|`|ceQqYxtnaa	...you save all of the little ittybitty pieces of soap that's to small to use an after they have accumulated you wet them then smoosh them together and WAA-LAA you have soap!!!!!|`|FC9gJ4ilaa	Sometimes you can buy soap making kits at craft stores.
