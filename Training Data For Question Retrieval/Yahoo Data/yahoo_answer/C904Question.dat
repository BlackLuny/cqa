Now it's about $950 an ounce.      That's $150 increase over the past 30 years.      I'm not going to do the math but that is a very poor earnings over 30 years.      So why do people still think gold is a good investment?

20090227044310AAzTpaD	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	30 day notice required to vacate a rented room in home?	My friend and I moved in on the 4th of February, and paid $650 combined ($325 each) for the first month, and $400 combined ($200 each) deposit. We're renting out a privately owned home in CA, with the owner still living in it with us (we found on craigslist). It was a month-to-month type thing when we agreed upon it, and now I am having a bit of a dilemma regarding the legal aspects of the whole ordeal.      Basically, we moved in with no papers or anything, until recently when the owner gave us an "application," which we didn't get until the 21st.       I told the owner yesterday that I would be moving before the 4th of March (so basically only having stayed one month), but he said I can't, and that I need to put in my 30 day notice.      My friend is going to be staying there, and since we both might as well be one person in relationship to the owner, shouldn't I be able to move out before the 4th, and my friend would just have to pay the $650 all by himself?       Also, the owner is trying to have us pay for the next month from the 25th (today) until the 30th, even though we didn't move in until the 4th. Is this legal? And, am I able to leave without the notice?

I have never been late or went over the max on the card.  I paid 4600 to get it down to about a 200 dollar limit.  They lowered my max to 500 dollars now.  So my question is that my average will probably be around 4500 and my max on the card is 500 now.  Will this screw up my credit score?

I have some normal bidders, but also some bidders that are using stolen ebay and paypal accounts. These fraudulent bidders bid up the price to around $3500 and eventually win the item. I'm not stupid so I don't send them the laptop and I report them and then relist the item. The problem is, each time this happens I have to pay the ebay listing fees. I get back the final closing fee that is a percentage of the $3500 but never the original fee. The fee is only a few dollars but every time I listed something this happened.       How do I make sure this doesn't happen? Is there a setting somewhere that can help me prevent this? In laptop example I also tried a buy it now for 450 and it was also bought by someone using a stolen account. Any ideas?

During my visit to New York City I noticed a building with a name on its awning: Oliver Cromwell.  Why would a coop or a condo choose such a name?  Is it for the purpose of sending a very subtle message to potential byers that Catholics are not welcome?  As we know from history, Oliver Cromwell was a Protestant whose troops killed many Catholics during civil wars in Britain.  What is your opinion?

Everyone at my job feels this way and this is not the first or the last time that he has done this. I don't know how to deal with it, other than say something to him, or talk the GM about it, both of which  I fear could bring about retaliation. I'm all out of ideas.

I was wondering if you guys think I could have this fee lifted by calling the bank and talking to a customer service manager. I don't want to call and get rejected or embarrassed.

So I've been working at Marylou's coffee since July of '08 and on Feb 6 I went into pre-term labor (I was only 34 weeks pregnant at the time) and the doctor put me on bed rest until Feb 20 (36 weeks). I told my manager this and said that I had a note from the doctor and she said it was fine. So I talked to her on the 20th to put me back on the schedule and she said okay. I go into my work 3 days later to get a coffee and she said she "by accident" filled out a separation form and im technically no longer working for the company. So i call the main office and they say that my store all of a sudden doesn't have any open hours (but they haven't hired anyone new since I went on bed rest) and they will keep my number on file for when a position opens. Isn't this technically being fired because I'm pregnant. This is illegal right? What should I do?

Ciao a tutti, l'anno scorso ero libero professionista e ho chiuso tutto (partita iva, camera di commercio) a dicembre 2006 perchè avevo guadagnato pochissimissimo. Ora lavoro come impiegato mentre mia moglie ancora non ha trovato lavoro (sta finendo anche l'università) ed è a mio carico. In azienda mi è stato detto che non ho diritto all'assegno famigliare per mia moglie perchè c'è una legge che impedisce di ricevere tale assegno se l'anno precedente si era liberi professionisti. Il reddito dell'anno scorso è stato veramente bassissimo, possibile che non ho diritto? E certamente se guadagnavo milionate non cambiavo per un posto retribuito a soli 1200 euro....

20090304081601AA0DeLM	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Technology	What are some good career paths for someone good at computers and art?	I have a younger brother who lacks the motivation to get back into college; mostly because he isn't sure what to do.  He is super smart (4.0 GPA in High School) and is a really fast learner.  He is really good at:      Math   Computers   Art   Video Games   Music      So far I suggested he go into a graphic design program, something involving creating web sites or video games or iPhone applications.  What other areas could he look into?        It seems there are a lot of careers out there, but they don't get discussed in High School.  They only like to talk about doctors, lawyers, teachers and cops.  They fail to mention "hidden" jobs like retail buying, networks admin, estate manager, etc....      I think my brother would be a good fit in the world of technology, but I'm not sure what other 'hidden' jobs are out there involving art and computers.

20090304083855AAdbJ0h	Business & Finance;Investing	Is it wise to buy stocks in this economy?	Such as Washington Mutual stocks, a few days ago it was at .03 cents a share.  I think about 12-15 months ago it was at $45 a share, prior to the fall of the market.  Is it wise to buy these stocks now, and let them sit to earn money.  I know the market will eventually rise.  However, with Obama desiring to nationalize some banks, is it worth it to buy bank stock?      Thanks.

20090304063658AA5LjQ9	Business & Finance;Taxes;United Kingdom	I asked for a payslip but was refused as I am a temp?	I was refused a payslip yesterday. It seems like I am getting cash in hand (well cheque). I started this job at the end of January and I have only just got my second cheque. I thought I should wait at least a month to bring it up to the manager. But she wasn't in. So I asked the assistant manager and he said temps don't get payslips there. But in my last temp job several years ago I remember getting a payslip. I said I wanted to make sure nothing illegal was going on and I want to pay my taxes. I think I must of offended him there...:/ I don't know how that slipped out. He then asked me to talk to the boss next week when she is in.       And btw, I am not working for any temp agency. I just turned up at the GP surgery and asked if they have any vacancies and got the job. Does this mean I am responsible to pay my taxes?
20090304080323AALVvaW	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	My husbands student loan taken out of my return?	My husband and I are trying to figure out if we should file a married joint return or married separate.  I have been working for a company and getting a regular paycheck but he runs a business and his pay comes directly from a customer to him and the pay varies each week.  He still owes a few thousand in unpaid student loans and for the past few years they have taken the entirety of his tax returns, and his economic stimulus as well.  If we file a joint return, could they take money from me as well?  Also, if he finds out he has to pay in a lot of money for his business, and we filed a joint- could they take my money to go towards that as well?

20090304081040AAe8EPA	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	How much do YOU pay for your mortgage? How much were you preapproved for?	I know this is a personal question, but it seems like something that could be helpful.  I hear a lot of "how much can I get with such and such conditions", and generally people will get pointed off to some mortgage calculator.  They are helpful, but putting in the same stats I have gotten some seriously different advice on what I might be able to afford on different calculators.      I am going to be setting up a meeting to get preapproved in the near future, and I know that will give me a better idea of where I stand.  However, I haven't seen any questions about how much you can get preapproved for, versus how much you should actually spend.  Is it generally true that you can afford what you get approved for?      Moving on to the main question.  I was hoping to stop all this theoretical bologna and get to the real meat of the subject.  I wanted to get some responses from real people in real situations, fill out what you can.  Thanks!      1) How much were you preapproved for (amount, interest rate, term)?   2) How much did you use from the loan?   3) How much did you put up front as a down payment?   4) How much are your monthly mortgage payments (and taxes/insurance too)?   5) How much is the annual gross income of your household?   6) How do you feel that the mortgage payments stack up against your income (are you living above/below your means?  are you strapped for cash, or do you think you could've afforded a more expensive house? or is it just right?)?   7) Please feel free to add anything else about your situation that you feel adds to the discussion!      Again, I know this is all personal information, so I'm hoping we can keep this all respectful (no knocking on people who took a mortgage too high during the boom or anything disrespectful altogether).  Please respond with as much or as little information as you'd like.  I just wanted to see if I could get some people to give some real world examples of how this works out, for all of us people who are thinking about buying now and are having a hard time getting any hard and fast evidence on how the system works.      Thanks, in advance, to anyone participating!

20090304082551AAlhP5l	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	I Have a Check Cashing Question !!!!?	I'm asking for anyone's help because I really don't know what to do. I ran away from my moms house when I was 16 years old because she forced me into taking a pregnancy test and when she found out she wanted me to get an abortion and I was definetly against it. But, while living there, I worked for a metal company for only 3 months and the last paycheck I got from the company I forgot to take it with me when I was running away to save my child. I was only 16 so I had no bank account, I used to sign it and give it to her to cash it in for me when I was in school or work. The bank tellers knew her for so many years that they never even asked for i.d. at all and I have no clue if I was in her bank account. My last paycheck, I also signed (regretfully) and gave to her to cash it in. I would like to know if there is anyway I can find out if that check was cashed in or not? I would like to know because now we're are talking a little bit and she swares to god that she would never do such a thing.....(everything she says is always a lie.) Please Help!!! Best, correct answer gets 10 points!!!!

20090304075201AASrKnv	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Ways to make money at home?	I am a stay at home mom but I do work one night a week bartending. This works out very well because I am home with my daughter all day and when I do go to work my husband stays with her. I am able to make almost as much money in one night than I would working 40 hrs. a week.    However, getting home at 5 in the morning and then waking up at 7:30 takes  a toll on you.Plus bartending has a tendency to wear on you after awhile. I'm getting to an age where it's no longer fun to do.    So my question is, does anyone know of an at-home job where I can work my own hours and still make extra money? Luckily my husband has a good job that pays well and any money I make is just extra. I work so that I can feel as though I contribute to the household monetarily in someway.   I don't want a job in which I have to solicit or phone people, as I find that intrusive. Just something that is legit and will give me the flexibility I need.

Back in the fall, I registered a sole proprietorship and made a bit of money on the side sub-contracting for a friends' construction co.  In the meantime, I kept every receipt I could, mostly for gas.  I made a little under $1000 before the end of the year.  I also have a full-time career which makes it difficult to put in much time in construction.  My father turned me to his accountant who specializes in businesses at tax time.  Does anyone think I should come out of this for the better or is it a strong possibility that I will just get taxed harder for the extra money I made?      thanks for your answers.....

20090304074621AAB9UVQ	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Administrative and Office Support	Is it just me, or is this really up tight?	Lately, the company I work for has 'cracked down' on administrative staff overtime hours. Apparently there are some admins in other offices around the country who would leave for lunch without clocking out, etc in order to get the overtime they weren't actually earning. I think that's horrible and that those people should be corrected.       However, no one in my office is abusing the system. If we got overtime, it's because we were actually working. And it wasn't even that much -- maybe 2 or 3 hours over the course of a work week, and most weeks, even less.      Now, corporate has commanded all administrative staff to take full-hour lunch breaks (previously, 30 minutes was the minimum required and many of the admins were so busy, they would work through their lunches to get everything done) and any overtime -- even 5 or 10 minutes -- has to get approved in advance in writing. We've been told to do personal things (one suggestion was applying our make up) in the mornings if we get here early because we can't clock in more than 5 minutes before our start time.      I really, truly understand trying to cut back and save for the company. But when this office is hiring two new employees (6- and 7-figure incomes respectively), I don't see how they can justify scolding me over, literally, $12 worth of over time.

20090304074759AAxDL6z	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Taxes: Can I claim my Child Care Costs paid to a Private Non-Profit School?	Background: I am the sole parent of a 5 year old. There is no other parent, no support or shared custody. My income is slightly less than $30,000/yr and we live in PA. I am accustomed to claiming my child's daycare costs, but this year my child started school in a private non-profit school and I can't get my child transported to the daycare after school so I've decided to use the schools after school care and summer care programs instead of going back to a daycare just for the summer. I did not claim any of my after school care expenses for 2008 (I didn't think I could), but I did claim the cost of the daycare in 2008 before my child started school.       My question is can I legally claim the cost of the after school care & summer care paid to the private non-profit school even though it is not a "registered/licensed child care provider"? I have the schools EIN number but I'm not sure if I'm allowed to claim the cost since the school is not registered/licensed as an actual day care or child care provider through the Department of Public Welfare. Can I legally claim these costs?

I'm an independent contractor in California. Federal taxes are totally clear to me, but I'm having trouble with state taxes: I can't find info on which forms I need to attach my California 540 form in order to declare that income that I earned shown on my MISC-1099.      For federal: I already filed my 1040, and attached Schedule SE and C-EZ. I already sent in my quarterly taxes using 1040-ES.      For California taxes, I already sent in my 540-ES to the franchise tax board for each quarter. But I'm looking at my 540 form and I cannot find state form that are comparable to the federal schedules SE and C-EZ.       Where do I declare the income from the 1099-MISC on the California state forms?      Thanks so much!

I'm turning 16 in May and I am thinking about getting my first job (ahh!) for during the summer. I was thinking a job at the local library.      Anyways, does anyone have any ideas? I want a paying job (of course) that will not be too stressful but gives me good experience at the same time.       I enjoy anything having to do with computers, but I can't think of a starting out job that involves computers.       Anyways.. I have a few questions that need answering:   -What was your first job if you got it at 16?   -If I got a job at a store like wal-mart or a clothing store in the mall, what would be my duties and what would be asked of me?   -At 16, whats the range of salary I could get (per month) for my first job?      I'd appreciate it if you answered all of my questions in full sentences. Anyone who does so will recieve best answer :)      Thanks!

20090304084920AAoHfsZ	Business & Finance;Credit	Credit bureau not reporting my info... because of my name?!?!?	Hi, I asked a question in here a couple weeks back about why one of the credit bureaus (Equifax) was not reporting any of my credit information while the other two were.  I called all of my creditors and got the "We report to all 3 bureaus, but we can try re-submitting your information" line, until I called my auto loan company.  They actually took the time to have somebody in their loan department investigate it.  When they called back, they informed me that because of my 'unusual' last name, Equifax has been rejecting the information that all of my creditors have sent to them and hence my blank report.  Needless to say, I'm FURIOUS!  Being denied credit because the bureau doesn't like my last name... Is this grounds for a lawsuit against Equifax?  What steps can I take to fix this situation?  Thank you for listening.

Any personal insight? The pay and the opportunity to "get my foot in the door" of this company are what prompted me to take the consulting position, so I could deal with no vacation this year if I had to.
