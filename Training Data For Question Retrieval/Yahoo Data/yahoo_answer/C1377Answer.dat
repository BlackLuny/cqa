OcfUTWataa	A wild rodent eats small plants and insects - it's a consumer.  A snake eats the mouse or rat - it's the secondary consumer.   The website dictionary.com gives definitions only about the animal kingdom.  In economics, a company that manufactures spark plugs sells them to an automobile company - the primary consumer.  The auto company sells a car to you or me -- we are, to the spark plug maker, the secondary consumer, even though we are the primary consumer to the car company.

We were doing the laundry-which she usually helps with,  But yesterday---oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.............I came home and told my husband I was having a PAMPRIN day or something.  I still have a couple of weeks to go for my period too, so didn't know what was happening.    I took 2 pamprin (way later) and they helped calm me down.  (pink bottle)  especially when my 12 yr old got home from school. Then I REALLY needed them :):):)    try it. It worked for me.    Good Luck  (and try to)have a GR8 day
WYwGrcknaa	do you have any hobbies,do you enjoy reading or even going out. All these things sre things that you can tallk about. Be yourself and when conversating talk about your interest and what you enjoy doing. people will appreciate and like you more and you will feel comfortable being yourself|`|B1LkXUKvaa	don't try so hard; be yourself. talk about things that you love, and love to talk about. that way, people will come to you, and only people who you have something in common with
QxIhMHwAaa	I am an MSW. Your best bet for finding a definition is in the DSM-IV-TR (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). There is however no singular definition of anxiety since there are a wide variety of anxiety disorders, each having their own definitions/symptoms...generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, separation anxiety, panic disorder, agoraphobia...it would depend on the type of anxiety you had in mind.
OcfUTWataa	1) change in the 20's:  Women began to feel they were worth as much as men and not lower-level creatures. The change in attitude affected how women dressed -- affected fashion, affected how women thought about themselves, and got women interested in politics.   2)affected the USA today -- For the first several decades, women voted the way their husbands did -- for the same candidates. During the Reagan years (1980s) women began to vote for different candidates than their husbands; Reagan was mostly elected by men, but the fact that women did not vote for him was noticed.  Women voting for Pres. Clinton elected him, and women were an important group who voted for Pres. Obama, along with Latinos, African-Americans, etc.  Since the end of WWII, women have held more and more political jobs; the 1st woman Senator was in the 50's, and recently we had a women run for President, and she is now the 3rd women Secretary of State. We have our first in history woman Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi.  3)I voted differently than my late husband, and I have been able to show my son the importance of participating in our democracy by voting in each election, primary, etc.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Women got the vote in the 1920 in the USA, but in fact the decade was generally an era when women's interest in politics declined rather than increasing.  The pre-WW1 era was when women were far more politically active than they were in the 20s.  And in fact politicians soon realised that the women's vote made scarcely any difference, because women tended to vote the same way as their fathers, husbands, etc, not necessarily because they thought they ought to, but because they tended to have similar political views to the men close to them.    There were great changes in the behaviour and fashions of women in the 20s, but I don't know how much the women's vote had to do with it.  Women shortened their skirst, bobbed their hair, took it drinking and smoking and wearing makeup and going out with men without chaperones.  I don't know that this had much to do with the vote though.      And I imagine the same is true of the USA today.  Women do not vote en masse for any one political candidate, if they did then the results of elections would be a foregone conclusion.    How has it impacted my life?  Well, I'm glad that women have the vote, because I think everyone should have a voice, however small, in the democratic process.  I am however wary of some of the more eccentric feminist legislation being passed by the government.

NrOJ24hSaa	Absolutely not. It is good to consider other people's feelings when making a decision, but ultimately you should do what makes you happy. Staying in a relationship or job that is not satisfying to you is only going to make you more unhappy and make you resent the people that you stayed there for. They are not you and may not fully understand your decisions, but you must stick to what you believe is right. Do not let anyone tell you what to do with your life  :)|`|ewgDtqD3aa	happiness might be overrated but like love but we all know when we have it, it's the best feel ever and it make life goes around. you have to do what make you happy period.|`|fvamen09aa	Absolutely not.

P1H02dqgaa	Well, clearly he's and idiot!    I know it really sucks when someone you cared for, and you thought cared for you, treats you this way.  It's a sorry fact that some people (both men and women) don't know how to behave.  It does appear that he wished to break up with you, but even so, no one should manufacture an argument then give the silent treatment.  He clearly isn't very mature - and not very bright.    That doesn't help with your hurt feelings I know, but remember, you're the one who still has their dignity and knows how to behave properly.  I think you'll just have to start dealing with this in the usual way.  Accept the breakup (no matter how badly done), go and get a new hair cut, massage, manicure or something to make you feel nice (even if it's just a nice home treatment), get dressed up and go and enjoy a good night out with the girls.  If you ever happen to bump into him, say hi and move on.  Even if it's only acting, don't let on that he upset you, that you're happy to see him, or even angry to see him.  Essentially, indifference is the best way to go - ie. you couldn't care one way or another whether he was there or not!  I promise, no matter what he's pretending - that'll sting any man's ego!    Many moons ago a similar thing happened to me.  I bumped into this guy several months later during a night out with friends.  I said "Hi James.  This is my friend Sarah.  Sarah, this is James."  I then politely excused ourselves and went on our way.  His face was a picture - his name was infact 'John'!  It was sweet, simple and really effective!    All the very best, and onto bigger and better things!  Karen|`|kXZKtw2yaa	He sounds like a nob.

Chances are, he accused you of doing what he did out of guilt and wanted to break up. He obviously s*cks at it.    The good thing is, you know now that he's not the right person for you. He should have talked to you if the relationship wasn't working for him instead of doing what he did. People learn to work out problems together when they want to stay together.     If you really wanted to contact him, I don't think there's anything wrong with trying. He probably won't answer the phone though. Bottom line, you did nothing wrong and he should have manned up.|`|lwc0n0zCaa	the begininng of this sounds like a weight loss commericial thing  "have you tried multiple ways to lose weight? did it fail for you everytime? becky lost 31 pounds in two weeks!"|`|8bcd238c8b848fb63a058d03732252b7aa	dail 118 118 :P|`|AA11498686	Get a new BF that willing to be honest...

qXJnNelsaa	To me, the most important part of respect is to treat someone how you think you deserves to be treated.  I also believe in not judging people or talking about them, always try to put yourself in someone else's place and think "If I was in this situation, how would I react?"    I think respect is so important in the modern world because of many reasons.  One thing is, we need someone to look up to and respect because in society, we need leadership.  We need someone to take on responsibility for things in our country that we cannot control and that position must be taken on by someone with great knowledge, experienced, wisdom and power.  Another reason is because in history there were so many obstacles that have been overcome which caused wars, battles, unfair treament of countries and races, etc.  In this day in age, a huge part of life (and following the civil rights movement), is that we are all equals.  If people have prejudices against people or groups, they are not being treated with respect.  Respect is crucial in making sure that things are run smoothly and so that people know they are treated as an equal and that they are just important and valued as anyone else.|`|xxT7YGcMaa	Because everyone deserves the courtesy to be held in high esteem by their fellow men or women!

pWlVHm6kaa	You're an interesting 15 year old!    I have only known one true sociopath and they work well with secrecy. Calling one on his or her behavior and asking about it would likely make that person uncomfortable or angry. Not being vulnerable or feeling weak would be much better than showing any kind of weakness. They sense that in others and have learned to exploit it. So I would say truth is the weakness of a sociopath and assertivness would be recognizing his/her techniques, calling him or her on them, and walking away from the draw that you have for someone like that.|`|AA12213253	Ignore his wit and intelligence and keep him at a distance...completely out of your life is best for you.  The only thing a sociopath/psychopath can offer you is a lot of problems and once it's over with you'll just feel violated and drained.  The constant lies, the manipulation, constant desire to be the center of attention, constant underhanded schemes. And if he gets into trouble, he won't mind stabbing you in the back to save his own hide, believe me.   I speak from experience and I know  how sociopaths are.     I only hope my words don't go unheeded.
DsEEATKSaa	No. The "silent treatment" is a character issue. It has nothing to do with bipolar disorder, nor does his failure to return voice mail, etc.    The bottom line, is that you need to decide whether or not you are willing to put up with behavior like this for a lifetime. People who treat others in this manner RARELY change.

OcfUTWataa	I once slept in a house where everyone was speaking Hindi, the language spoken around New Delhi, India.  I thought it sounded a lot like Italian -- plenty of vowels -- and that night dreamed I was in Italy, hearing Italian spoken around me.  I don't speak Hindi or Italian, but I had been in Italy as a tourist and thought the sounds were similar.   I think your experience with Arabic prompted your dream.   People who really are studying or speaking a second language during the day dream in their native language, or perhaps use a few words of the second language in a dream.  Using the second language in a dream usually happens to people who live, work, play the second language every day, with little or no contact in the native language.

For example: "Understanding the laws of attraction will be beneficial to society".    I'm not going to do your speech for you, but you might want to use a powerful metaphor, like they use in the beginning of the book. Then come up with 2 or 3 reasons to support your original proposition. You will need to address the arguments against using the laws of attraction and have decent refutations and cite sources that may be converts to this concept.    Close your speech with a recap of what you had just said, and reference your metaphor again for a powerful finish.    Here's a pretty good video on how to begin:|`|AWlnm6N9aa	Be honest and say what you really believe. Also, ask the universe and it will provide with the most appropriate things to say.|`|AA11231339	Do you really believe in the Law of Attraction?   Do you really want to help people with it?  Can you understand their objections or even their fear of it?    Get yourself into the feeling-place of your message before you write and your writing will be much clearer and stronger.     If you aren't sure how to write the words, experiment with a tape recorder and stand up and start talking.    See what comes up and what moves you.    But above all, be honest.    Riveting speeches are real.  They give details.    If I say:  "Law of Attraction works" and give some quantum physics info that's one thing.    But I say: Let me tell you a true story.  I was 9 months pregnant and about to burst.  I was sitting in a bankruptcy hearing and I was scared for my life and the future of my child.  In that moment I knew something needed to change.  I just didn't know how....    ....that is something else, isn't it?    Speak from the heart.  Mean every word.  Give real examples.  Be real.  You will be amazed at the results.    (And from a Law of Attraction stand point you can always picture how great it feels to be holding an amazing speech in your hands or to hear the people's chairs scraping as they pop out of their seats with thunderous applause after your amazing words are spoken.)  :-)    Best to you and to your speech!

For example, sure, I love being dominated.  BUT I also like to dominate back.  I find that most women are like that--we like variety.  Sure its great for a guy to hold us down and go wild, but its also fun to handcuff him to the bed and have our way ;)    Not everything has to be black or white, up or down.  There is a middle ground and there are plenty of women who like to play in that middle ground and dabble in both worlds.
6778c2c9e69d0178fdc42f6dd1af603daa	Having dreams about that is natural. Your subconscious mind could just be projecting the truth about how you feel about him. Or if you don't feel that way, it could just be curiosity to know what it would feel like to still be with him or to find out his response to your admittance. Don't worry about it too much.

AA12022384	Are you so blind in your hatred of women that you refuse to accept facts.    From acid attacks in Asia to the economic inequity between genders in the U.S., women face a vast array of discriminatory practices and human right violations worldwide. A few of these are highlighted below. There are many more.    There is a worldwide discrepancy between women's access to basic resources such as health care and education and the access their brothers enjoy. Education is gender-imbalanced in this regard because in many countries it is seen as pointless to send a girl to school. In fact, two-thirds of the world's children who receive less than four years of education are girls.    Women are paid less for doing the same work as men in every country on earth.5 In the U.S., women earn only $.74 cents on the $1.00 paid to men, African American women earn $.63 and Hispanic women $.56.6 Only 3% of senior managers at Fortune 1000 corporations are NOT white males.    Equal representation is not a reality when over 50% of Americans are women yet only 22% of American senators are female.11 That's only slightly better than the world statistics which show that 52% of the humans on the planet are female, yet only 13% of members of national parliaments worldwide are women. Far from leading the way, the U.S., with its powerful origin myth of freedom and equality, is way behind developing countries like Argentina, which has more than twice as many female representatives.    It has only been a little over 100 years since the first nation to grant women full voting rights (New Zealand) did so. In the U.S., it took 70 years for the Suffrage Movement to reach this goal. As unbelievable as it may seem today, a common argument for denying women an equal vote was that a woman could not be expected to comprehend matters of politics and thus choose intelligently. In some countries, women still cannot vote. In many others, a woman's opinion, choice or testimony is legally given third-class treatment; for example, in Jordan's Shari'a courts, which govern marriage, divorce and inheritance issues, for Muslims and Non-Muslims alike, a women's testimony is worth half a man's    The majority of the world's women cannot own, inherit, or control property, land, and wealth on an equal basis with men which could explain why 99% of the world's assets are in men's names.    There are thousands of websites, books, journals and scientific papers which substantiate the above (mostly written by men) and you dare to call women who point out the huge inequalities which still exist against women in the word liars.

Basic preventative male healthcare is covered by insurance, while basic preventative female healthcare, such as a mammogram, often is not.  Research is primarily done on the male body and then applied to females despite obvious differences in bodies.  Women still make less money doing the same job as men.  Domestic abuse, primarily towards women (yes, there is domestic abuse towards men, also, but the numbers are not even close), is still rampant, and the laws in place do not adequately prevent battery and homicides even with ample evidence of a problem with an abuser.

d08rkYlpaa	OK, first of all, something you probably already know - having sex dreams is perfectly normal and natural and everybody has them. Your sexuality is now a part of who and what you are, and your emotional development depends on your acceptance of that fact.  Some indulgence in fantasy about your bf is harmless. It's ok to think about him, appreciate his sexiness, and imagine having sex with him (especially when you are in private. Or in the shower, or in bed). That might help you get over your frustrations at having incomplete dreams, especially since your subconscious mind obviously recognizes that your self control in real life is unsatisfying, and you would love not to be so in control for once.|`|YW74O9aNaa	happens with almost everyone at that age :D   nothing wrong with it as long as you don't get so attracted to the idea that you try it out in reality.

It's natural for us to dream those dreams, and I think it's because we haven't experienced 'that' yet. And our minds are just curious to how that situation would turn out and what it would be like (even though we don't care to have those dreams). I couldn't tell you how to stop having those dreams, but if it helps, I stopped having that kind of dream after a week or two.
vAdtlZDpaa	It is less likely that the dream means your friend will be murdered and more likely that it means you friend is being betrayed.     To dream that you are murdered suggests that some important and significant relationship has been severed and you are trying to disconnect yourself from your emotions. Your friend may feel that her own best friend can no longer be counted on.
FdRGuMKraa	Hey, I just went to the library and I found a bunch of books about dream interpretation. You may find this interesting:    1-Symbols of entrapment, such as imprisonment, commonly occur when you feel constrained by necessity in your life, like keeping a job just to pay the bills. Dreams about various forms of entrapment are common to new parents who have growing family responsibilities and are uncertain as to the limitations this will place on them.    2-Dreams of running away imply avoidance, confusion and an inability to deal with a situation. Dreaming of running yet not making ground suggests that you are stuck in a situation and feeling helpless. Or perhaps you need to take life at a slower pace but are finding it difficult to do so. It might also mean that your impatient self is finding it difficult to learn patience.    I hope this information helps explain why you are having this dream.|`|LKv2mQrfaa	wait is it a 3 story house with a bone ladder in the front but you couldnt get to it, there was just some like force or something stopping u? and its suppossed to be a ladys ghost and when ever you see her you jsut stare, get real cold and turn around?

BJmLaAWiaa	Your planting a flower represents new birth. An object has stopped that new birth, those are snakes(frightening creatures). You were trying to create something new from something old, and the snakes (your fears) kept you from doing so.   The dream is stating that the fear of events of your past are keeping you from moving on in your life (planting anew).  Even if you do have a new baby on the way, I think the dream is a physicalization of your inner fear of not being able to succeed in bringing forth a child.    There is another layer however.   If the potted plant is the new child on the way.   You would be COVERING the grave of the old child with the potted plant as if covering the death of the old child with the life of the new. Maybe something inside you feels bad for trying to REPLACE or COVER the death of Abigail with the new child. You feel Abigail would be hurt(hence the snakes representing her bitterness)|`|8dc5NMexaa	I am struck by the vivid dream of such sacred nature.  I am also struck by Rishi M's highly sensitive interpretative rendition.  I submit the following not for replacement of Rishi M's astute and remarkable rendition, but as a possible additional consideration.  Snakes are often seen as symbols of life, death and rebirth. In writing about Snake Symbolism, Gillian Holloway, Ph.D. wrote, "People who are dying or who have lost a loved one often dream of snakes, at or near the time of death. For whatever reason, these dreams seem involved with the psychic awareness of the transition from this life to the next...." Psychoanalyst Carl Jung talks about a similar connection between earth and heaven in his discussion on the snake as a symbol for medicine. In Man and His Symbols, he writes, "perhaps the commonest dream symbol of transcendence is the snake, it seems to embody a kind of mediation between earth and heaven." It was a jolting dream, hard to forget, and one which others in similar situations would want understanding.  It would be my hope that as you have done well in the grieving and healing process, that you resolve this dream as revealing to you that Abigail's transcendence and mediation between earth and heaven is.  It just is. And the jolt and the fright of the dream scene can pass and transform into a soulful acceptance of  the transcendence and mediation. To all other material in your dream, I yield to Rishi M.

Just because they call in sick and take personal days 6 times more often than men , They should get paid the same .    Even though they don't want to work overtime, , holidays or weekends,They should still get paid the same.    Just because women are 20 times more likely to file a sexual harassment or discrimination case , They should get paid the same.    And even though after costly , extensive training , they are likely to get pregnant and disappear for months ,possibly not to return at all ,They should  still get paid the same.

I think that's hardly fair on the employer, who gains absolutely nothing from the mother looking after the children. Welfare benefits from the government would make more sense, since its society at large that is going to benefit from the children having a decent upbringing.    Also, the mother does get paid - she gets paid in love from her children.

I try not to answer questions when the person who makes a question out right lies in it but ehh what ever.     It is a PROVEN fact that in metropolitan areas women tend to make 1.25$ more on average then men.     Let's see.. the feminist's claim women make 75 cents per every dollar men make(0.25 cents difference), BUT the facts say in some areas of our country women make a whole 1.25$ more on average.            But I suppose bigots will be bigots regardless of reality.         If you want a decent paying job, work hard and take as little time off as you can. If you want a career and a family you might be better off with a partner that is willing to be the primary care giver. Also use birth control(even if you are married) and plan pregnancies so your employer will be able to work around it for the 4 or so months when you might not be able to work as hard.           You can't have everything, sometimes you have to earn your way through life.|`|nXMMVBOHaa	they get paid equally    feminists use biased studies and lies to spread all this "unequal pay" bull ****|`|ZqmgJvHBaa	If a woman is being paid less based on the grounds that she is female, she has a lawsuit on her hands.  Equal opportunity means we cannot be paid less simply because we are female!  Women were originally paid less because traditionally it was the man's job to earn the money for a household.  Women who worked were often seen as trying to take valuable pay away from a man who needed a job, and therefore they were paid less.  Women were also often seen as "just trying to make extra money on the side," and since they were not supporting an entire family, they made less pay.  This still lingers on today in some places because women and men are still not considered to be equal.  Employers may get around this by hiring less female employees, but once a woman has been hired she cannot have lower pay just because she is female.  Being a wife, mother, and provider is the hardest and most important job any person could possibly ask for.|`|rzaq0bwfaa	well, well you forced yourself to look away from the lifetime channel.     look at the porn industry, the feminists in that line work get paid alot more than men    p.s. get off the cross, we need the wood|`|yS9a9jk5aa	Most are fat and deserve low pay?

Do you see what I mean? If women really do have the same work output, then they should be in massive demand.    I really don't think any sane employer would be prepared to fritter away money on men if they have the same output. The fact that they are paid even more than women implies they generate more income or are more valuable. And don't quote "old boys networks" etc.    At the end of the day, men do generally do the longer hours, after hours, undesirable and dangerous jobs.     I doubt their wives would be happy if somebody got paid the same for doing less.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	Usually, they're working different jobs or less hours.  Rarely, it is due to outright sexism.

Sometimes, some types of women are afraid of letting go in the bedroom-we get performance anxiety too, men don't have the corner on that market.  So maybe they are so afraid of making the wrong moves they make no moves.  Secondly, if you are sleeping with much younger women, that may be your problem (yes I know that is diametrically opposed to everything you have ever been taught).  I was a MUCH better lover at 26 and after, and WAY better once I hit 31.  Once women achieve a certain age, and/or level of confidence, we stop only thinking of the mans pleasure and start to demand our own--little did we know that by doing that, we became even more attractive to our men because we weren't afraid to ask for what we wanted in the sack.  When I was 20 I would NEVER have moved my lovers hand from where it was to where I needed it to be and  whispered "If you touch me HERE, like THIS, I will come".  I  wasn't confident enough, and (at least according to my hubby, and one lover previous to him) that confidence can be pretty erotic.  Also, we aren't as coy about our fantasies.

Even at that, both guys I've been with, took me a while to really unleash the beast, because there's the worry that if you pull out too many sweet tricks, they're gonna start to wonder where you learned it and the thought will ruin it for them.     This an area that's tough for both genders, but was definitely tougher on women in the past. You wanna be good, but not *too* good. Or, you just choose to do nothing and let him think you have no experience or you're not one of "those girls" who loves sex.    It's dicey, just like for men to be super good making women wonder how many he's had, women worry about the same. Probably still more than men. The ones I know anyhow.    I still remember first going crazy on my current boyfriend and he DID seem freaked out and asked where I learned to "do that". He knew about who I'd been with and how, but still once I let the guard down he was sorta shocked.     Obviously, he liked it so he got over pretty quick, but it definitely was a bump int he road for us for a quick sec O_O haha    If you were with these women for a while, and they still just laid there...sorry dude.

For these reasons much effort is invested in raising self-esteem, particularly among young people. But can high self-esteem really be the magic bullet this effort assumes? Through a comprehensive review of the available research evidence, this report examines the case for this assumption.    Separate sections of the report look at:    ? the popular image of high self-esteem as an all-purpose social ?vaccine?, and scientific attempts to define and measure self-esteem;  ? what is known about the links between low self-esteem and a range of problem behaviours;  ? the origins of low self-esteem;  ? the relative effectiveness of different kinds of interventions intended to raise self-esteem.    The report raises serious doubts as to the value of investing in programmes to enhance self-esteem, given the very limited impact such programmes are likely to have on most problem behaviour.  ^_^|`|AA10673927	You're always comparing yourself to other people.

It's a label that can't be easily defined because each individual is different, with a whole set of their own feelings about who did what to whom, or who said what to whom and hurt their feelings.  Not feeling good about someone else hurting you, is not lack of self-esteem.  Because you can still like yourself afterwords.  Those who bully however may have low self-esteem because they aren't happy unless someone else is not.  A therapists version of low self-esteem is depression.|`|Osn1xpu6aa	The people around you.

udQvs0kZaa	Well... Was there an open seat over by where her friends were sitting? Did she try to talk to you at all? Did her friends keep looking over at you and maybe giggle a little bit? Are you cute? Has she done anything else to suggest she may have a thing for you? If the answer is yes to any of these questions, then there is a chance she might be attracted to you and is possibly trying to get your attention.     And as far as communicating with her, don't try to throw your intellect in her face to show off. She may take it as you trying to make her feel inferior. It is good that you are trying to carry on a normal conversation... Try not to divulge the fact you are suspicious about her intentions. Make an attempt to just be a good friend, then you can get into a comfort zone and then maybe take it from there. Learn about her so you may know what to expect from a relationship if there ever is one. It may be a lot less stressful for you start out in this fashion, without jumping to a conclusion and messing it up for yourself. It is easier to act in this sort of position and will help you feel more at ease around her.     Good luck!|`|oxEYZB9waa	i dont know man  but people sometimes like other people even when the person hasnt done anything to make the other person like them|`|Q4NFFBizaa	dude just start talking to her normally.

When there may be chance that she likes you, rather than letting it go as goes, you are searching for a definite answer far too quickly.  Do you find it so unlikely that she would like you that you must either doubt it, as you seem to be doing to some extent, or be sure that she likes you, to avoid having to wonder?  Get to know her first, and then you can get a better feeling as to whether or not she likes you.  Get close to her, and if it seems she really does like you, then great.  Or maybe just take your time, and if she does not seem extremely interested, get her there!  See if you can charm her, ask her to go do something, take it slow.  If it seems possible, go from there.      And maybe she's just a nice girl and couldn't bear to see you all alone.  Perhaps she'll just be a good friend.  You are jumping, or attempting to jump, to conclusions far too quickly.  RELAX.  And one thing I must point out is that you will get NOWHERE when you just as well as write yourself off immediately, saying she is 'waaaay out of your league.'  Does that attitude help?  Hell no.  I've found that when I have a positive attitude, I do best.  At least keep a neutral attitude.      And don't be so concerned over 'messing up' with crushes.  It sounds like you are negating yourself.  Stop concerning over it, and you will stop 'messing up.'  Maybe because you aren't messing up like you think, and you are so self-aware that you are thinking you are messing up.  Or just as likely, maybe you make yourself so tense that you are prone to 'mess up.'  Remember that you are equal to whomever you see.  'Leagues' do not really exist.  Leagues contain those who believe they are good enough and those who doubt themselves to where they have no chance.  Give yourself a chance.  You are not the only one who is human and actually has some self-doubt occasionally.  Remember that above everything.  I think if you stay confident and relax, and don't concern yourself immediately over whether or not every hot girl you see likes you or if you are 'in her league,' then you will be perfectly fine.  Be yourself, and be confident in the person you really are.  Good luck!

However we  never lied about being married in dealings with other adults as this was purely a decision done for the welfare of our children.

I don't really like my name, because no one in the Western Hemisphere knows how to properly pronounce it.    Changing a name is hardly giving up "who you are." Also, I find it interesting that you have no problem with a husband taking his wife's name, but find it "pathetic" that a woman would change hers. Double standard much?

A lot of the earlier feminists (certainly not the ones today) were focused on their own issues, conveniently ignoring those of women from different walks of life.

7h5zhoJqaa	No, true free market capitalism would be a completely unregulated market.  We're far from that.  We've never been a true free market capitalist society.  And regulation has grown more and more since Teddy Roosevelt and the Square Deal first put regulation as a role of the feds in addition to the states.    The problem with true free market capitalism is greed.  Left to themselves, many will take advantage of the system.  The nature of capitalism also tends to concentrate the majority of wealth into the hands of very few at the expense of many.    Teddy Roosevelt broke up the trusts held by the powerful elite during his Presidency, and Taft followed, leaving many regulations in their wake.  Truthfully, it wouldn't be bad to have Teddy back around again today to shake up the plutocracy we have going right now.  Our current system dwarfs the one that Roosevelt and Taft broke up at the turn of the 20th Century.  Only, now, the plutocracy feeds the elected government officials through campaign donations and sometimes (maybe often times) illegal gifts, so they have no interest in standing up to the banks and corporations.    I don't agree with your teachers assessment that we're moving toward socialism.  Reverse socialism right now - corporate socialism.  In other words, feeding billions in cash to the failing giants in the plutocracy out of the tax dollars paid by the average citizen.    Socialism in its true sense means industry is government owned, all profits are collected by government, the people provide according to their ability, and everyone is provided for by the government according to their needs.  We have socialist programs - like welfare, medicare, etc.  But every capitalist society in the world has them.  We're not even leaning toward socialism - we're defining a reverse of socialism by propping up failing banks and corporations.    Some information for your reading:|`|sS5abD8Vaa	it isnt a pure capitalistic society any more.

Could it be just to entertain u since ur bored, or is the cause something deeper? Only u can figure it out...well...w/o external help that is. IF it is a phase, that means there should be feelings accompanying it, because I don't think many happy teens constantly think bad thoughts. So first, analyze ur feelings in ur situation, then try n figure out if the bad thoughts are just filling for ur temporarily empty mind. Because usually bad thoughts are more engaging than good ones, because we're more inclined to act on the good, or just pass it by...but when the bad comes in, it's intriguing, so we ponder it, and viola, we're not bored anymore.

4Vchxp32aa	positive people do positive things every day, that's how they stay positive.  what you need to do is to find out what makes you feel positive and keep doing that.  all people are different so any suggestions I make to you will probably be fruitless.  just try to do things that make you happy.  it's that simple.

You only get one guess.    edit:  What some people don't realize yet is that we are having DEFLATION (noticeable thru oil prices) and the money printed so far only kept it at a more stable level than to create inflation. They are correct in saying printing too much money will cause inflation. The trick is to create it without causing hyperinflation. See wiki also about "money creation".    All we are doing is delaying the inevitable and prolonging the agony for most of us.|`|Kx2P8Hikaa	She's right. Besides we will be printing money we don't even have. Like let's say example with the Germans; they did print so much money and what might happen is that a loaf of bread can cost up to a barrel filled with one dollar bills. Pretty much, we can't print more money because it becomes worthless.|`|AA12071655	Imagine you have an apple and four friends to share it with. You cut the apple up into four pieces and everyone gets a piece.    Now you have eight friends, but only one apple. Each person gets half of what he would have gotten.    Money is only a representation of value; the individual dollars are the pieces of the apple. The apple is only so big. Each extra dollar printed devalues the rest of the money.|`|24cf3baf038a7bc020b7521533f2d5ccaa	Because money is only worth something if the government backs it up with Gold or Silver.|`|GR8jsGgLaa	That is what Zimbabwe is doing and you see how that is effecting their economy.  Hyper Inflation is the result of printing more money.|`|1djOVJ0daa	As more and more money is printed and supplied into circulation, it would result in inflation which basically is the rise of prices of goods and services.     What that means is people's savings will loose its value by the percentage of the inflation rate. In maths terms if inflation rate is 5% then the value of money in savings (that was in bank before the inflation) will loose value by 5%.    The best example of inflation problem is to look at Zimbabwe. It has 231 million per cent inflation.|`|oqyf9cJFaa	because the more money we print the lower the value is. the Germans did this back after world war 1. when you continue to print more and more mney the money starts to lose its value and soon everything will have to go up in price becase the money isnt' worth as much anymore. so we'd actually just be making the situation worse.  i know its confusing.|`|ltqHnwivaa	When We Make More Money, The Value goes down. We'd have to raise the products price, because there are so much more money.  For EXP:  David buys a book for $5. He has has $10 left over, so he buys 2 more books.  If the united States, printed more money, david would get more money.  NOW: David buys a book for $5. Now he has $20 in total, so he buys 4 more.  The store, then realizes, there losing the products, and soon they need to do something, before its sold out. So then The Store raises its price to $10.  Now david buys the book for $10, and he has 10$, because he spent the Other $10 on his book, so now he can only buy 1 book, because theres $10 in his wallet.
8a4ab6cd19aef6dc04437de88209d858aa	My daughter has just finished her 'difficult year' (I like to call it that even though it lasts more than a year, because it makes me feel I can last *that* long!  lol)  I have raised lots of children, and have survived the 'difficult year' of boys and girls, and seen them become men and women.      Believe me it is not easy from either side... Assuming you have a regular mother, and that she is not actually horrible in some way.  It is very hard to be supportive if you do not know what you are supposed to be supporting.  We moms are used to knowing what is going on, and what is important, because face it - until lately it was up to her to decide that for your life.  We dash about being supportive of all sorts of things that just do not matter to a particular kid anymore, and we feel used and put out.      You will start getting what support you actually need when your mom finds out what is important to YOU, NOW.  You are inventing this as you go... so how are moms to know unless you tell us?    Moms also assume that if you are old enough to determine how to use your time, you are also old enough to use some of it to take care of yourself... Do your own laundry, pitch in around the house.      It is a pretty good measure of whether you are being reasonable with your mom by considering:  Are you a good guest?  If you invited someone over to your home, and they behaved as you do, whould you want them to stay longer?  Growing up is a time when you change from someone who has the right to complete 24/7 care and support, to someone who is a congenial guest... No burden or inconvenience beyond the help they are to have around.  When you reach that point you are an adult, and truly ready to tell people not to worry about you.    Being an adult, if you expect to share resources, like car rides, telephones, utilities, money, food... involves communication and compromise.  It involves anticipating the needs of others and coordinating so that meeting the needs of all is no extraordinary burden on the others.  It involves communication and predictability.    The difficult year does not really end, and you will not have the opportunity to appreciate your mom again, until you have started to meaningfully display these grown up behaviors.  Growing up is a responsibility as well as a freedom.    Be as polite as you can.  Try and put yourself in your mother's shoes when she is arguing with you, try and remember all she does, and has done, for you and it will be a bit easier.    This woman you hate has limited her life for 15 years or more for your benefit and comfort.  She has faced many fears, gone without many things, all without letting it show... so that you could be happy and secure.  It is pretty likely that without a child, she would have been able to do more exciting or responsible work, certainly she would have had more money and time to spend on herself... All of this she has given *for you*.  She is now probably a bit jealous of your freedom, your youth and ability to make so many different decisions than she did in her time, maybe she is even jealous of your pretiness and energy!  Yet she will want you to use you youth wisely, and feel compelled to give you a whole bunch of needless advice until she sees that you have good sense, or have made some decisions about how to spend your life.  Try and be nice about it :)  And try and give her what she needs to respect you and let you be yourself:  evidence of your maturity and self-responsibility.    And no matter what... this too shall pass.  You will be friends again someday :)|`|d5K8wORqaa	i no what u mean.  wait till ur 18. leave. she will no what she lost then.|`|7HxJvbjMaa	If you are still young and have a few more years at home it's worth it to find a way to work things out with your mom.  Try saying "Mom, I love you... but I don't like the way you talk to me. It really hurts my feelings."  She may ask what you mean by that, at which point you can give a few examples of statements that made you feel bad. But do it in a calm, non-confrontational way. Just tell her that it makes you feel so bad and that is why you have been rudely retorting.   If she responds positively that's your cue to be as nice as possible, and agree to try harder if she will. If she doesn't, then I feel really sorry for you but I do wish you luck. Some people can never resolve their family issues. :(|`|oxEYZB9waa	if you hate her then stop talking to her  just take her out of your life|`|oMF6bXCZaa	Let me guess.  You are in your teens and you want to live your own life without any rules and regulations.    You don't really hate her, you are reacting to your own feelings of how you feel that YOU know exactly what is right for you, and you don't need any help with your decisions.    I guarantee you, that unless you start to realize that in the few years you have lived, that you do not have the answers to everything, your whole teenage years are going to be very unhappy.    One day your MOther will not be on this earth, and you will look back and have many regrets.    Make different choices now, and you will enjoy her company more and you will find that the years will slip by and one day, your mother will be a senior and you, yourself will probably be a mother.|`|72H4hFaHaa	Mums want their daughters to succeed in life the best they can.   They will do anything possible to get their daughters to achieve this. Unfortunately in many cases that includes nagging and criticizing and nothing is ever good enough.    The daughters also want to succeed in life the best they can - in their own way - and that's why mums and daughters have arguments.    I take it that you are in your teens-become-adult age and it's only natural for you to feel this way. Believe me, it will get better. And know that your mum does love you.    I am 57 years old and my mum is 83.   When I was your age, we had the same problem (some things never change).  Now at the age of 83 my mum still criticizes me sometimes, as I do a lot of things differently from her. But now I just give her a big hug and we both laugh.   (Trust me, you don't have to wait till 57 to get along with your mum, it happens much earlier)|`|aBUZl4j0aa	i know what you mean. my parents are always putting me down and when i do something good they don't even congratulate me unless i ask them to. pretty lame huh? they compare me to my sister a lot too. just go on with your life and you won't hate her anymore. when she makes you mad go on a walk or call up your best friend and have a long talk. it works trust me i do it ALL the time|`|suosd9ivaa	same gosh i know what you mean, what i do is tune her out (like right now) and just say okay. Since i don't know the whole story I'll explain what you might be able to do.... just stay in your room. Keep to yourself. Try to stay away from her at all times unless its necessary then your could i guess take deep breaths and talk softly if your mom's like mine then she'll think talking is yelling good luck sorry i couldn't help much
Bww3poJNaa	It's normal! It's having alot of pride in yourself and when you ask someone for help you down yourself cause you know you can do better. And you don't understand how you got into situations that you get into. I am the same way it takes me forever to ask for help or anything like that I feel low. I like doing stuff myself!|`|4Vchxp32aa	CIA agent has an IQ under 100.

CWLlxknoaa	It's not important to have only excellent marks to be a good person. You may be excellent at school but you may be a crammer, a boring and dull person to deal with.   Remember, Albert Einstein also used to have poor marks at school. And when an adult he became a worldknown scientist! Maybe your special talents and skills will show themselves a bit later, or maybe you'll become really great at Geography.  Nevertheless, you must finish school as good as possible. so try to get good marks in subjects you have problems with. Of course, it's very hard, but soon at the university you'll be able to choose only those subjects that you like. Suffer a bit know to be happy in the future.|`|a499884662fa57a7be95d9e42c7ff638aa	Just get a tutor for the subject you are bad at and don't worry about the computer courses.

( in most schools, logic is a part of philosophy)    honestly, it seems to me that if you can be good at philosophy and geography, that nothing is beyond you.  Can you get a tutor for awhile and see if that  makes it easier?|`|i1wKIzVAaa	You don't have to be an expert on every subject to be considered Intelligent, or a good person for that matter. Being intelligent means that you a have an excellent level of understanding of anything - you don't have to be a quick learner either, the end results are all that matters! Also being a good person - has nothing to do with how "smart" you are, but with what you do, how you act towards other people! So if other people say your a good person and you feel like your a good person - then you ARE a good person! Don't worry about how well other people are doing, just focus on yourself and continue working hard in your classes; and you'll be just fine! :)
24cf3baf038a7bc020b7521533f2d5ccaa	well logically of course. Contractors don't have as much work on their hands so the prices drop in order for them to remain in business.   Not to mention usually constructors are never on schedule but when they got no where to be they'll get the job done on time, uncharacteristically.

I would suggest you get a tutor, either paid or through your school to improve your grades.  It will make life easier for you.  I was failing a class in college and got the teacher to tutor me.  I was failing Geometry in high school and got an A student to tutor me. In one case I raised my grade to an A and in the other a B, plus I got a date with the hot teacher.
KdFXk0ajaa	I can relate to math difficulty but mine was Algebra. Numbers and letters don't go together in my world. They still don't as I avoided Algebra (I did not fail but didn't like the "C".. so I dropped it in college).<br>  When in the Air Force I spoke to one of the testing examiners for some general advice. He told me the following: Answer the questions you are sure of first. Then go back and break down the other questions to your level of understanding. He also told me (does not apply to Math but multiple choice exams in the military anyway), that when in doubt if you see all of the above or none of the above then they are good choices. <br>  As Math is a weakness for you spend a little more of your study time on that subject. I always tell my son don't spend time on the things you know for sure spend it on the stuff you don't fully understand. Go over the tough questions/concepts the night before so they are fresh in your mind. Get a good nights sleep before the test. Eat a good breakfast (sounds lame but has scientific based fact). When you get in the testing room take a few deep breaths and clear your mind. Look for the problems you are familiar with and do them first. Then go back to the ones of which you were unsure and see if you can figure them out. Try to relax. Be prepared. All will be alright.

A lot of women who save themselves use that for release, so guys can too.    Re: Your eating example....When you get hungry, you want to eat something GOOD..not just anything.  This is what sex is like when you want to save it for the right person. A woman wants good sex..not just sex with anyone who can't turn her on.      I have experienced males hating on women with high sex drives as well, so it goes both ways.      EDIT:  How do you know I don't have a high sex drive, lol? I've been where you are before, but I've learned how to control it.  Yes, I'm one of those women who have had males put me down for having a high sex drive. Two of those men were my ex boyfriends. Is it worth acting out on my sexual urges just to end up with abusers like my exes? NO. Amanda is right about choosing our battles.  It's worth waiting for the right person and masturbating, instead of finding some random guy to fulfill my daily desires.       I don't know how old you are, but if you're young, I guess I can see where you're coming from. If you aren't aware that women can have high sex drives, that gives me more reason to think that you're young. Some of the older and experienced alpha males I've met are aware that women can be just as horny.      But once people get older, they start to realize that meaningful sex is better than randomly acting out on being horny.|`|240SYAuiaa	What Capone said...and.

Women have the same sex drives which makes it even more pointless for us to ridicule etc. but this doesn't stop some guys from laughing at girls who want it a lot. If there is any ridicule going on it's because of the behaviour of certain people who let it get out of control, not because of their actual feelings. Make sense?

Men with high sex drives have traditionally been called romeos, lotharios, studs, or ladie's men...  Whereas women with high sex drives have been called whores, sluts, and  tramps...    You know I'm telling the truth!     However, lest you think I missed the reason for your question...  It actually works both ways.    People who have low or average sex drives have a very difficult time understanding those with very high sex drives.  It simply does not hold the same priority for them, and they often really do not understand the physical craving and discomfort that comes with it.    And I won't even attempt to address the moral and social conditioning aspect of it because this answer is long enough already.    For people who have extremely high sex drives, it is almost like water and air...it is a biological drive that compels them.    There are plenty of people, both men and women, who accept it, and manage it.  For others, it wreaks havoc in their lives because they allow it to control them.    The ones who are honest and open are often the exception instead of the rule.  The ones who allow it to dictate their actions and infringe on their health and well-being, unfortunately, tend to cross innocent people in their lives who end up getting used, cheated on, or lied to as a direct result.  They leave partners bitter, angry, betrayed, and confused.    Those people then often start to generalize "all men" or "all women" into the categories listed.  (And to acknowledge your point as well, those categories for men have been updated and replaced with derogatory terms more similar to the ones previously reserved for women- manwhores and dogs, for example.)    The people who throw all men OR all women with high sex drives into one generalized category and lambast them have their own issues.  I'll take my high sex drive and be happy with it any day.  They don't live with me, pay my bills, or impact my life in any significant way, so what they think about me is basically irrelevant.    Imho, people in general, male or female, who typically resort to ridicule, insult, and hate, do so because they are insecure with themselves.  They feel the need to be superior to others, and they feel they have the right to pass judgement and make assumptions.  Such is life and human nature.      It's their time and energy, so I suppose they can waste it anyway they choose.  Lol, it's not gonna impact my sex life either way.|`|x5MYW2LPaa	I'm sorry that you feel ridiculed, impotency is not a luahging matter and I suggest you see a doctor because there may be something to help you.

There were those that knew what they were doing and then there were those that didn't want to know.  This is not even to speak of those that refused to stop it from happening and could have, but did nothing.|`|8a4ab6cd19aef6dc04437de88209d858aa	There are two basic problem factors here, and to understand either you have to stop thinking of money as little green pieces of paper, or as numbers.  Money is the moving energy of an economy.    1. Concentration of wealth - which means that too much of the pool of wealth is in the hands of too small a group of people.  Essentially when you get so much money that it would be virtually impossible to personally spend it, it has stopped having a purpose other than to bleed the reast of society through interest and dividends.  It ties up money in ways that prevent fast movement of money.  When regular people are cycling money hand to hand, they get their paycheck, they buy stuff... it keeps moving, it gets to be used by many.  Investment is important, but not so important that large amounts of money are tied up in things that are not even real, and change hands less frequently.  Energy is blocked.  Bob cannot save enough to start his business, so he must borrow, and pay a penalty rather than realize the full value of his innovation and labor.  Mary does not have enough left over after her interest on her mortgage to buy frivilous stuff... so her neighbor is not employed making it.  It is not a matter of personal greed, but of a society that allows this level of concentration of wealth.  Two means of preventing excess concentration of wealth have been historically effective: brutal inheritance taxes and social redistiribution of actual wealth through reduced cost of infrastructure, or high levels of income tax and social redistribution of earnings.  At a certan concentration of wealth, unemployment soars and economies collapse, and generally there is a very large war... which is the other method of redistributing wealth.  We are actually past that level of concentration of wealth now, and this was possible because credit was extended to hide the shortfall of economic energy in those not holding wealth.    2. The flipside of this concentration of wealth problem, on a local (USA) scale, is the tendency to buy products produced by people who are much less well off than ourselves, working in conditions we would not tolerate... This means we pay less for these goods... but also that our neighbors do not make the money to do it, and therefore this money (energy) is lost to our local system.  This is unsustainable unless we become willing to live and work under the same conditions as those who's systems we feed with our economic energy.  In other words, the other face of greed is the person who decorates their christmas tree with lights made by chinese orphan children younger than the ones we sit with to open presents under it.

Referring to 'men' as 'males' kinda dehumanizes us. Especially when you follow up with "women" or "girls" - which reminds us of their humanity.

There is nothing wrong with paternal stuff, just as there is nothing wrong with maternal stuff.<br>  <br>  There was a case which feminists hailed a great success.

No matter what they did for him..her, he wanted to remain a boy.<br>  <br>  He took off his dresses and wore pants (trousers), he threw away his dolls and played with trucks - and despite all the problems - the feminists & socialigists all insisted "job well done"<br>  <br>  Until that is, he committed suicide - unable to cope with the feminist pressures (and obviously the more inate struggles) plied on him, being told everything was successful - when clearly, it was far from.

Generally speaking, psychiatrists only work with the medical aspect of mental health issues. They prescribe meds or other physical treatments. They usually work in tandem with your therapist, who may refer you.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for a therapist who specializes in anxiety/depression issues, check on line for therapists in your area, or sometimes a local publication will have listings.

AA12140689	Asperger's syndrome is a mild form of autism. People with Asperger's syndrome (also known as "aspies") have normal intelligence and no speech delay, but they lack social skills and have obsessive interests. Most people with Asperger's syndrome have some sensory issues and many have poor motor skills. How well the aspie can function varies between individuals. Some are able to live independently as they grow up, while others will always need some assistance.<br>  <br>  Here are some common symptoms of Asperger's syndrome. Please note though that many more symptoms exist and that the symptoms vary between individuals. One doesn't have to have all those symptoms in order to be diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome.<br>  <br>  - Inability to read into body language and facial expressions. The person may use facial expressions little or in an unusual way themselves.<br>  - Lack of eye contact.<br>  - Tendency to take things literally. May not understand sarcasm, jokes, politeness, metaphors and other non-literal things.<br>  - May display inappropriate behavior without realizing it or intending to.<br>  - Obsessive interests. May talk excessively about their special interests, regardless of whether the listener is interested.<br>  - Unusual tone or pitch of voice.<br>  - Unusual choice of words. May speak rather formally for their age.<br>  - Poor coordination and excessive clumsiness, due to poor motor skills.<br>  - Sensory issues (normal light may feel painfully bright, normal sounds may feel painfully loud, may have problems with certain textures or taste, etc.).<br>  - May have meltdowns or shutdowns.<br>  - Stims (for example repetitive movements, used as self-stimulation).<br>  <br>  Asperger's syndrome is a lifelong condition. There is no known cure. It doesn't usually get worse over time. It often gets a bit better with time, as the person learns some of the skills they lack or learns how to deal with things.|`|WUc9TbHCaa	It's an Autism Spectrum disorder.|`|2iUddK03aa	Asperger syndrome (also called Asperger's syndrome, Asperger's disorder, Asperger's or AS) is an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and people with AS therefore show significant difficulties in social interaction and restricted, stereotyped patterns of behavior and interests. AS differs from other ASDs by its relative preservation of linguistic and cognitive development. Although not mentioned in standard diagnostic criteria, physical clumsiness and atypical use of language are frequently reported<br>  <br>  Asperger syndrome is named after Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger who, in 1944, described children in his practice who lacked nonverbal communication skills, demonstrated limited empathy with their peers, and were physically clumsy.[3] Fifty years later, AS was standardized as a diagnosis, but questions about many aspects remainFor example, there is lingering doubt about the distinction between AS and high-functioning autism  partly due to this, the prevalence of AS is not firmly established. The exact cause is unknown, although research supports the likelihood of a genetic basis; brain imaging techniques have not identified a clear common pathology<br>  <br>  There is no single treatment for Asperger syndrome, and the effectiveness of particular interventions is supported by only limited data.Intervention is aimed at improving symptoms and function. The mainstay of management is behavioral therapy, focusing on specific deficits to address poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines, and physical clumsiness.Most individuals with AS can improve over time, but difficulties with communication, social adjustment and independent living continue into adulthood.Some researchers and people with AS have advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view that AS is a difference, rather than a disability that must be treated or cured.<br>  =)

Do not join a gang. you need to focus on the therapy and learning and growing. You mentioned child psychology, so obviously you are young, your family should be your safe place and your back up and sounding board. You need to look at your self in the mirror and see the good in yourself. Positive affirmations are great, that is when you look at your self in the mirror and say good, nice things about yourself. Good luck and and be kind to yourself.
fdNo9Flbaa	Sometimes the smell is a dream itself, a very strong memory of smoke is easy for the brain to remember because of our natural instincts towards fire and smoke.  Sometimes the body may trigger that memory to wake yourself up for some reason or another.  Sometimes the memory is linked into the subconscious causing the memory to seem like a dream, and therefore the smell becomes a dream itself.  Sometimes if there is a difficulty while breathing during the night the body can and more than likely will trigger this response so you can wake up to breathe.   For instance if you like to sleep with your blankets wrapped or draped across your face; sometimes your body may become panicked while sleeping and in order to reawaken the body it may trigger a "dream," of an unpleasent smell, taste, sound etc even if there truly was no dream.  Sometimes these type of dreams can also be considered a, "Night terror" depending on how the sense was triggered.|`|MW5owvvJaa	Yeah I have dreams like that.<br>  I had one where I sprayed this stuff on me and Moises Arias from Hannah Montana was like smelling me and he said, "OOHHH You smell soooo good."<br>  <br>  and then Mitchel musso from hm sprayed cologne and he asked me to smell him and i smelled it and it smelled good <br>  <br>  Lol!|`|yqy5xfSbaa	i know what you mean. i can also taste things in my dream.

He had only ever dated white women, and then said he was dumped each and every time. Initially he came off as having a great fun loving personality, and I could not figure out why he was constantly being dumped, that is until I realized he was a major taker and not a giver! <br>  <br>  For instance he would purposely take me to cheap places to eat (not that I care) and I would always pay for myself (again not that I care) but I got the distinct impression that he was trying to be cheap with me, and it turned me straight off!!! <br>  <br>  I got sick and tired of him pulling these weird stunts in public where he would quickly pay for himself and leave me wondering what the hell he was thinking when he invited me out, so I started making a point of paying for the both of us in the same way I would pay for a friend. <br>  <br>  Anyway this moron let me pay for a whole sh*t load of things and only paid for my dinner one time, and on that occasion he started chowing down on my dinner along with me! LOL. Then he suggested seeing a movie on one occasion and I am like ok, and then hes like "I insist on paying, no arguements, go into the bookstore". Oh so he realized that I was paying for everything and suddenly he insists on returning the favor? <br>  <br>  These scenarios started grating on my nerves, and so did the fact that every time he would set up a date with me he would be 2 to 3 hours late, and always want to be kissing me as if we were two imbeciles in high school. If I didnt want to hold hands in the car while he was driving I was accused of seeming distant. He was always making big plans for us to go places, over weekends, and asked me to request time off from work, so I did, and we got a hotel room around where we were staying and I guess this moron must have expected sex, but I was not going to be engaging that, so what do you know the very next day that we were supposed to be hanging out in the area we drove all the way out to, this schmuck remembers he has a house warming party to go to. YEAH RIGHT!!!<br>  <br>  So I was still trying to be nice and would agree to go out with him, but this moron pulled the same stunt again, we went on a mini vacation and the jacka** pulled the same sh*t the very next day claiming he had some plans. HIS PLANS WERE WITH ME NOBODY ELSE!!<br>  <br>  The very last time I went on a date with him, he invited me out to a Mongolian BBQ that he had frequented in his college days only to find out that "SURPRISE.....CASH ONLY". And he only had his debit card, alll shucks!!! So I pull a 20 out of my purse and pay for the damn meal, which was over salted and I ended up dumping in the garbage. Anyway this moron says "im full" and asks for a to go box, and lets the food rot in the backseat of the car while we go shopping (because hes wanting to save it for later cause hes too cheap to buy food for his house, also he once bragged about stretching one pizza over a week and how much money he saved by doing so....barf!!). Finally I snapped and started telling him what a douche bag he was and that he was trashy and yadda yadda yadda, he starts laughing like im telling jokes!!<br>  <br>  Looking back on it, I feel used by this moron, and I get a strange feeling that he might have been married, cause I was never invited to his house, cause he claimed his room mates mom was living with them and that she would not understand. Yeah whatever, anyway it made me sick cause I felt like I really put myself out there and this idiot took advantage of my kindness and acted like a total tard. <br>  <br>  SORRY FOR THE RANT!! lol|`|wkjncmHTaa	Sure, there have been a couple.

It will be awkward at first because the clubs have been in session for a while, but you will be able to socialize with a small group of people at once and get to know them on a personal level.

And build on it. Be confident about it. Obviously this will be hard because you have problems with anxiety and nervousness. But seriously, give it a try. Go into it headfirst and give it your best shot. <br>  <br>  What I do if I'm feeling embarassed or insecure about myself; I repeat in my head: "I am a confident person." Over and over again. Sounds weird, but over time it really catches up with you. And before you know it you'll actually FEEL confident.<br>  <br>  And don't worry about starting or even maintaining a social life.. those things will come with the confidence. People like to be around fun and happy people. Feeling good is contagious. Try it!<br>  <br>  Seriously man.. it's not that hard, just give a try and I promise you you'll find a spark in some new relationships.|`|Lc6GbpTVaa	hey I think everyone has some anxiety they just hide it better....why do you think so many people drink and use drugs?

Start small & easy....take some music lessons, join a book club, take a college class.  Toast masters is a great place to practice talking. google it.

DS21ekeJaa	When I am very over-tired from insomnia or totally stressed in several life ares, I will have nightmares. I'm not sure if it's my chemical makeup in my brain going haywire, or just my minds way of channeling the stress. I rarely remember my dreams, if I have any, but will occasionally wake up from a horrible nightmare. They are usually about something bad happening to my children so the adrenaline rush is pretty gruesome.|`|G3C1itUHaa	Yes, they're a way to suppress stress you're dealing with. Or when your body relates things to another with symbolism due to past experiences. <br>  However, with that being said, just because you dream of killing someone/getting hurt or any scary dream it doesn't mean that actual sequence is happening in your life.

It's your bodies way of coping with a stressor... If you are sick, then it is a physical stressor, if you are stressed because of work or school, then it is a mental stressor.  If you are having a difficult emotional time, then it is an emotional stressor.  Each different type of stress provides a different type of dream as well.|`|qhU3PDgfaa	night mares are kinda the images of our fears.. <br>  those are the things we dont want them to happen...<br>  and i dont think we can do anything to prevent ... as we dont know when those things will happen, or whther those things will really happen..

Again, many people consider him a hero.<br>  3 - Attila the Hun - Killed 4 Million people at a time when there was only 40 or so million on the planet - thats about 10% of the population - makes Hitler look like amateur.

emOhSyY5aa	That is just one way that certain people of society will try and force men and women into gender roles. You have a good husband, one who is strong enough to know when you are making the best judgments. I would not pay any attention to that friend of yours. They could be jealous or angry that you are moving.|`|k4Ek3jAqaa	He's probably just jealous because he know's he wouldn't do the same thing it sounds to me like your husband loves you a lot and is man enough to follow you where you need to do without being a big baby and all I'm the man I make the rules hear me roar like your friend sounds.|`|a0LbAryDaa	Seems to me that we have a sexist? Dont listen to him, and tell your husband not to let that bother him. I've had a lot of people call me a "wuss" for letting my girlfriend make decisions...funny how none of them have lasted in a relationship for longer than I have, if you get my point :).|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Well its the way men in the west have been brought up to.

So where are you moving to?|`|WkLJI40baa	I thought only Internet trolls made statements like that|`|LYPWNxx5aa	What makes him not a real man is that he is unemployed. Unless he isn't in a coma, he should have a job. Even if you make more than he does financially he should man up and get a job. Many times, I've had 2 or even 3 jobs at a time. This doesn't make me more of a man than others, but I have no respect for a man who chooses not to be gainfully employed. <br>  <br>  As far as him "letting" you make the decision to move, My wife is involved in all my decisions because marriage is a partnership between man and wife, not "do as I say". I see nothing wrong with your decision to move.|`|mZVk3fP4aa	That's just a common sexist attitude that if a man isn't domineering, and controlling, and the woman a submissive little shrinking violet, unable to make any real decisions, they're not a "real man." You'll see a lot of that on here. Men on here associate masculinity with being a control freak, and femininity with being a submissive little bubble head. They accuse women they consider too aggressive (feminists for example) of being "butch lesbians" because they can't get through their sexist heads that just because a person has a vagina, it doesn't mean they shouldn't be able to make a major decision for the family once in a while. I have MUCH more respect for a man like your husband who is willing to discuss it, and go with right choice than some weak little chauvinist who feels threatened by a woman with a mind of their own.|`|iOE9EYVLaa	Don't let your friends expectations of what a man should be doing in a relationship cloud the good thing your obviously have!  <br>  <br>  Your friend sounds like an idiot!|`|VA2hs3Doaa	im willing to bet your friends single??|`|0bYcYz2jaa	The fact that he is supporting your success seems to make him less of a man to some.  I think that what your husband is doing is making sure his family is whole, happy, and provided for.  Talking it out with you, agreeing to support your career, seeing as it is your sole income, and being strong enough to know that this doesn't diminish him in any way makes him a great man.|`|AaoLwJJWaa	yeah, the dude is being too old fashioned.... but then again i know a lot of women who would actually agree with him(and they're fairly young too).|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	People expect men to be the ones making all the decisions in the family, failing to realize that a husband is supposed to be your partner, not your boss.  Your husband is a real man for respecting your opinion and your values and doing what's best for his family, rather than going against you to suit society's idea of a 'real man'.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Twiglet: I'm lovin' the new avatar!|`|fDGPbwdsaa	'real man' is just an insult aimed at men who don't please someone.

But he was not fine, and ended up dead at the end of a rope in our parents' back yard at the age of 22.  <br>  She is your sister, after all, and you can tell if she is sinking into a deep depression, right?  This is not the same as having a rough week or two, or you wouldn't be so alarmed.  Get her help, even if you have to be the one to tell parents or family or school.  Remember, the best help is often the one you're afraid to ask, such as family.  <br>  <br>  College students are in an age-group that's very susceptible to suicide.  Hanging around is good, but she may need real help before this gets even worse.  And it will get much worse if you just leave it untreated, whether she's suicidal or not.  These bouts with depression don't just go away forever on their own.  Believe me.  But most likely, by this stage, she is thinking about ending it all.   Don't fail to bring in outside help, or you may wish you had done it sooner.|`|M9RJLpqEaa	first of all why is she depressed,try to figure it out and make her feel reliefed...Thats really bad that shes mising uni <br>  1)Try to make her feel better and talk to her and tell her how much you care of her and that she shouldnt be doing what she is doing now<br>  2)Take her to the beach , and let her walk at the shore it make people relax and feel calm espacially at the morining or night.<br>  3)Try solving her problem befores she gets DEPRESION its serious.<br>  4)Get her friends over for a party .<br>  5)Let her write in a diary and write all of the things that are annoying her there.<br>  6)GO shopping or watch a movie or swimming or ice-skating.<br>  7)Dont let her feel mad or sad at all it will make everything worst.<br>  8)Go have some facial and nails treatment ....<br>  <br>  BTW the most important thing is to talk to her and now whys she acting like this<br>  <br>  P.S: I'm just 13 so sowy thats all what i can think of for now|`|oojO4WAraa	Try to talk her into visiting the uni health center.

AA11202852	Religion is an abstract concept, and typically kids don't begin to comprehend abstractions until they're ten or eleven. Most of a child's formative years (birth - 10) are very concrete, black and white, no gray areas. <br>  <br>  They will copy what you do, and repeat what you say, but their understanding of religious concepts doesn't begin until they are preteens.|`|c1yfnzuVaa	I started around the age of 12. <br>  <br>  My parents aren't religious and I've been to different churches a handful of times, but I never really started thinking about religion until I became clinically depressed.

ViKjojK0aa	Are you sure you aren't my girlfriend?<br>  <br>  <br>  Ha, but usually it can be explained clinically by serotonin and dopamine imbalances in the brain. This can be because when you get slightly happy, your body doesn't re-uptake on serotonin and so you're left in a buzz of "slap-happiness": by not re-uptaking naturally, the serotonin source isn't depleted. The opposite can also be applicable. You may be one of those personalities who gets very easily excited and very easily depressed, because of how the chemicals so easily excite themselves in your brain.<br>  <br>  Did I hit the nail on the head? There's not much you can do about it, if that is the case. It's neurological in nature, and unless you want to start taking ssri's there's not many options. You'll just have to accept it as a personality trait and move on.|`|UGPiSvhraa	Maybe it is time to go to bed? You are fighting sleep maybe?

People often find them creepy. <br>  <br>  However, they are better than other people in almost every other way. They are almost always very smart, they can trick and manipulate people very well, they are lazy but when they set a goal they can stick to it single-mindedly, etc. <br>  <br>  Some of them are very good with women because women like aloof distant men for sex.

You would like to get a handle on your emotions and you can once you decide you are going to do it. Do a google search for quotes from people like Norman Vincent Peale and Charles F.

wdqZNhL4aa	Schools use a number system to describe how many hours you will be working compared to a full time employee. The 1.0 means that it is a full-time position in comparison to .33 FTE which would mean you would be teaching (or counseling in this instance), 1/3 of the amount of time of a full-time employee or .50 FTE would mean that you would be teaching or counseling half the amount of time of a full-time employee. It is not simply saying that they are looking for 1 full time employee. Hope this helps.|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	They're simply stating that they want ONE full-time employee (FTE) for the position.

You take charge, instead of being like "Do you wanna do this..." be like "We are doing this..." I bet you if you pretend as if it isn't bothering you and you could care less it'll bother her and she'll come running back to you. Things are always opposite, when you aren't trying to find a gf one appears, and when you do want one none appears. Life is backwards, so play the game. Act as if you're even happier now she's gone and pretty soon you will be back to normal.

SMS are a nice way to meet each other better because theres no way you can be shy or get scared by acting in a way or w/e so go on and make him yours LOL|`|2UoZCS3Raa	well i dont think theres anything wrong with that i try to act that around this one guy but this girl is always with him and when i come up she would leave the group and he dosent really talk to her cuz shes like a tomboy and im sorta girl girly but still i think its ok that hes (ur guy) acting like that and it really not a long story <br>  *just incase you think im wrong im just one grade below you 7th grade lol<br>  can u help me out i wanna ask him out but we are like in the friend zone u no??|`|yuGhmhGuaa	Call Dr. Phil|`|AmRARZidaa	I kinda have the same problem, it's like this;<br>  I know this guy since 3rd grade we've always been together up until the end of seven grade. we were best friend, hanging out together and laughing together, then one day he stop talking to me because some "rumors" went around the school saying that i like him but then in 7th grade we got back together (as in friendship) although he's not the same person anymore he's more quiet and  not the old funny one anymore. so then i ask him "wat wrong" one day and he answered me with (IT'S KIND OF LIKE A GUY THING, WE CHANGE AT A CERTAIN AGE) so if ur guy buddy doesnt talk to u like normal its nothing new he's still the same but he think in a weird way.
dlNEGfP6aa	I used to get like that, too. And i used to feel WAY guilty about it... But now the way i see it is its ME time. And like, you shouldnt feel guilty. Its natural to masterbate. Just be careful, and dont get caught. God didnt give you a dick, so it could just sit there, you know? Its the same with girls too. Just see it as exploring yourself, and your body! Also, when you get a gf or bf one day, youll know exactly what turns you on, and it will benefit you in the end.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	one hour for pleasure doesn't seem that bad.

Nothing is wrong with masturbation but if you feel as if your wasting your time, you need some help. Accomplishing your goal is by getting out and trying something new that you don't often do, usually doing something like that is crazy. Sometimes you just need a break of what you are doing and trying something new, and if that doesn't work you need help beyond that.

Sometimes, cognitive therapy helps.|`|JIMWL8vhaa	i use to have a habit like that (i used to tap a lot; with my fingers)<br>  <br>  tell him to get one of those little stress balls and keep it in his pocket. whenever he wants to pick at his skin he'll be able to squeez the stress ball, and slowly he'll ween himself away from that habit.|`|UVOpjpkyaa	That's an involuntary tick. I bet your "friend" doesn't realize he's even doing it sometimes. I pull out my hair and play with the wrinkles on my clothes. I'm currently on meds for OCD, but I still have my ticks. You need to tell others to hit you when you do it. Bring it to your attention. I don't know where you are picking at, but if it can be covered with clothes give that a shot. You've got to try and figure this out. I hope it isn't too harmful.|`|AA11280073	There are meds that can help him. He needs to see a Dr. for a prescription.
DCSfx5coaa	To answer your question, its actually the opposite, our feelings or our desires give rise to out thoughts. Here is a great short video that talks about  how to control our thoughts. <a href="http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/kabbalah-video-clips/how-can-i-control-my-thoughts" rel="nofollow">http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/kabbalah...</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	This is the idea behind cognitive therapy, which helps many people. Try it yourself at moodgym.anu.edu.au - free computerized cognitive therapy. There are some tests you take at the beginning to identify "warpy thinking" that could be making you miserable. <br>  <br>  The above statement you wrote isn't always true - I have bipolar disorder, and feel strong emotions due to having a mood disorder - I feel despair or elation for no reason at all, except I am mentally ill.  Cognitive-Behavioral therapy is a bit more effective than just cognitive therapy, and it did help me in some ways, but did nothing for the bipolar.<br>  <br>  Thinking most other people are pathetic is an example of warpy thinking, imo.  And being overly sensitive is often a sign, too.|`|yS4GKSHRaa	You should read "Feeling Good" by David Burns, M.D.  It explains this exactly.  He also has lots of exercises in cognitive behavioral therapy that will help you identify the exact thoughts that are causing you so much grief and help you find ways to replace them with positive thoughts that can help feel better.<br>  <br>  I think I can understand how you feel when you say you're a deep thinker, because I feel the same way about myself.  Keeping a journal has helped me so much, especially because I really think (and read) about everything that happens to me.  <br>  <br>  Here's how journaling helped me:  I never trusted what other people said, even with solid proof.  I didn't know this about myself until I started journaling.  This belief has really hurt me and it's ridiculous.  Someone could say to me, "You're such a great mother, your son looks so healthy."  And even though this is true, I would think to myself, "You don't really know, he wakes up at night and cries.  I'm a bad mom because..."  I didn't even realize I was doing that.  <br>  <br>  Find this book!  I really think it will help you.  If you can't get the book, at least try journaling.|`|IZq0IQxQaa	yes. that is completely true. mind set is everything! you can effect emotions by waking up in a good mood and saying "today is going to be a good day" the brain controls all. i know this sounds strange, but true. there have been mulitiple studies done. And if things are that bad i recommend a therapist.

yuGhmhGuaa	That my friend is a question only Oprah can awnser.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	An animal in a coma is not operating at it's most "efficient" capacity is it? Humans think, but they don't have a center (or soul) keeping track of it all. Everything thought has all the history it needs to operate in and of itself. You don't think your thoughts, thoughts just occur and sometimes appear to make decisions, but do they? Prove it!<br>  <br>  Consciousness is a myth. Thought isn't, but it needs no consciousness to operate it. Humans are robots with brains. They aren't "special" or better in ANY way. Judgments are pointless or if you believe in god, only he can decide that, so either way judgments are a no go. <br>  <br>  You don't think your thoughts, thought itself thinks it does to meet it's own purposes.|`|9QPt1eTeaa	there is a philosophy that points out things that are uniquely human.  These are different emotions or ways of being.  You are hitting on a long long debate that has plagued philosophers through time...are we objects determined by stimulus and response or are we subjects (souls occupying flesh which is only tempory).  There is a good answer that may existential philosophers suggest going below the split of subject and object.  We have unique human personalities that are not quantifiable or logically determined by some combination of body and environment alone.  Instead, our body and mind interact and help define each other.  So you need to decide what the meaning is of being human instead of trying to define humanity by physical measurements like "brain waves."  Brain waves are great for doctors to determine if someone will ever recover, which is why they will help the body survive if they think there is a chance and let nature take over if they do not.
dL6BcJQxaa	Its both your attitude & your thinking. Cheer up look forward to your date on Friday. Stop confusing yourself|`|8t6zDfzqaa	It's okay to be nervous, everyone is when they're on a date!|`|G3C1itUHaa	Lots of people do that, in fact, I, myself do that.<br>  Could it be that you truly are excited for your date Friday, however, you're nervous you don't want to get your hopes up as to how it may go? Has this happened before, where you've gotten your hopes up? Are you generally a happy person?<br>  If the following questions concluded with a "yes." I wouldn't look too much into it, however if you just suddenly started feeling apathetic and answer "no" to those questions and it continues past your date. I would ask a professional or talk to someone who is educated in physcology.<br>  Good luck.

AcgDcQG0aa	Gold is not used as money anymore.  And if you exchange your money for gold.  Then you won't be able to buy anything with that gold.  <br>  <br>  Gold is a commodity now mainly used for jewelery and some industrial purposes.  A lot of investors also buy gold in the hope that some day it might be used as money again.  But so far there is no government in the world planning to go back to the gold standard for their money.<br>  <br>  The US dollar is currently backed by the full power and authority of the US Federal Reserve, which is currently headed by Mr. Ben Bernanke.  And as long as people believe in the power and authority of the US government, then they will accept US dollars in exchange for goods and services.  Which is how the purchasing power of the US dollar comes into existence.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Labor.

Abraham Lincoln had to devalue money so he could print ridiculous amounts of it, and pay the soldiers needed to fight for the Union against the rebel South.<br>  <br>  Prior to 1861 the U.S. dollar- every single bill- was backed by a piece of gold and could be traded in for its worth in gold somewhere in the U.S. (at a bank, i would presume)<br>  <br>  Now, I will repeat myself. The only thing that makes the U.S dollar worth anything today is the fact that the government says it's worth something.<br>  <br>  Why do other countries value it so much then?<br>  <br>  Because as a world power, America has the privilege of creating value where there is none. We can see that the European's monetary system, the Euro, as well as the U.K's system of the pounds are both ranked higher in value to that of the U.S. dollar. This is determined by two main factors:<br>  1.) The economy of the region in which the dollar is produced and used.<br>  2.) The amount of gold which backs up the said money. <br>  <br>  It gets pretty confusing from their, and this is where my knowledge of the topic gets gray (I have a hard time understanding why the American dollar can be worth anything but a deficit, seeing as we are nearly 3 trillion dollars in debt). <br>  <br>  I hoped I helped

But it 's pretty much controlled now, without any medicine help. I just had to tell myself not to do whatever the OCD was about.

I know, it seems like you can't, but you really can :)|`|9QPt1eTeaa	You may want to go back to your therapist and try to decide if what you have is OCD or generalized anxiety and rumination.  I don't want to make a differential on here, but you can do it with your therapist.  Medicine is one option but is only a short term (8 weeks) method for anxiety, after that the research isn't clear that it helps.  what you could do is work with a therapist on accepting and confronting your anxieties and their consequences so that they aren't so scary and you feel competent in facing them.  There is a therapy called ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy) or existential therapy that is geared towards this.  Other therapies might focus on the source of your anxieties, but may take a longer approach.  You have to stick with it and your therapist no matter what approach you take.  Disclaimer: this is not clinical advice this is just education on what is out there.

8vKrxSYyaa	I used to be painfully shy.  The best thing to do is to join a group or get an interest or job that involves other people.  Even though you might feel very embarrassed and uncertain when talking to someone, they don't know what your thinking.  Once your used to the environment and the people you can start being more assertive and getting your point across.  Most people share the same hopes, fears and dreams and also have a deep-seated worry about being accepted.<br>  <br>  It also helps if you learn the art of talking drivel to people.|`|AA10510845	Everyone has a personality. I think you just lack confidence and are too critical of yourself.  You're working entirely too hard at this friendship thing.  It has to come naturally.  Why not just let things happen instead of trying to avoid people because you're not sure of yourself.  If you're open and friendly, people will naturally be attracted to you.  You don't need to do or say anything special.  I'd suggest joining a club or some kind of group activity where you'll find people with similar interests.  It's easy to start conversations in that type of setting.  And you don't need to amass a whole bunch of friends all at once.  One or two individuals that you feel comfortable with are enough as a start.  And you don't need to say a lot.  Just being a good listener can form a friendship.  I think you just need to like yourself a little more, because there's an old saying, something to the effect of, you have to love yourself first, in order to find love.  The same applies to friendships.

For a start, not everyone thrives in a school environment or 9-5 work environment. What are the environmental & social factors in your life? What choices are you making? Seek the environment, the positive people and doing the things which are So YOU and make YOU happy... that is the best I can suggest... it isn't always easy, all I know is that living in different countries/ social environments have hugely contributed towards feeling like a fish out of water or totally fitting in and being happy ... good luck :o)|`|ebd4b116c0612534749a4cb34b9a7462aa	Everyone does have a personality. I have the same problem as well. Ny family say I am very quiet and have little friends. But the truth is that sometimes people have their own style and comfort zone. For me, I have to spend a lot of time with a person before I consider myself confident enough to put my trust in them as a friend. Look for common ground in people... do you share similar interests. You would be surprised how quickly people get to know you if you have something similar. Don't be hard on yourself. You are the way you are. If you thin you need to change a little, then try to make minor changes to your behaviourour.

I have to wonder if he... sorry, SHE would still want to be with me, though.|`|1wIek546aa	if he looked like kate from lost, most def.<br>  <br>  he recently told me that if i decided i wanted to be a man he'd still love me, which is really sweet.|`|bGsXsDhBaa	I would be friends with him/her but not lovers|`|8QoN4Ktvaa	No.|`|f5d89624a6b6d1985a8ac37809507719aa	No|`|iHKJsyfTaa	No !, that would be weird, bordering sick.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	I think I would..maybe..IDK..I'm not really into women though, so maybe not.<br>  It's past my bedtime, I'm rambling.|`|84gK4XlHaa	Not romantically.  I just a read a memoir by a cross-gendered individual, so I've been thinking about this a lot lately.  I'm not attracted to women sexually (nor am I a homophob), so I don't think that I could continue being their girlfriend/wife.  I deserve to feel sexually fulfilled in a relationship as well.  I would make a serious effort to remain a friend to them though.  I mean, there are really no benefits to cross-gendering beyond being true to your identity.  You lose friends and family members and face an incredible amount of social stigma.  I know it's not a choice, and that would be the moment when they need you most.|`|mZVk3fP4aa	Not a chance.|`|Y3OeeB66aa	no i would say have a nice life you made your choice by by|`|Y7YC2FzZaa	F****** NO, they are out of my home, my life and hopefully my country.
n7T2AJ0Yaa	the reason you say she give off the impression of "acting" is that they basically told her how to act like a normal human being...but since she is not "normal" what they taught isn't really natural for her so its kind of like a 5 or 6 year old trying to interact with adult with the same amount of sophistication and intellect;  what the rest of us have learned over the course of our lives she has learned in three years and theirs no way that is going to be natural for her...now apparently she is definitely attached to you so stick with her you just need to be a little more cautious when around her|`|61abfb3c27511166d19130fdd59840ffaa	Could she be Bi-polar??...other than all this I would assume that she's just trying to get attention.|`|z7FEj9QSaa	She a sociopath not a beast of course she can love.<br>  And of course she tries to brag about being a sociopath wouldn't you?... that was a joke, its likely a defense mechanism, instead of being made fun of for being a sociopath she makes it sound like an accomplishment of some sort. (also the attention idea works) stay friends with her help her, I wouldn't get attached though and i would keep an eye on your belongings. don't endanger yourself though, if she makes you feel threatened stay away.
n7T2AJ0Yaa	dreams are basically your minds way of sorting information such as feelings even if they're on an unconscious level
