tqD9xUpYaa	Every day treats always sell well at bake sales as long as they're home made.  So many people just don't take the time to bake their own.  So brownies, chocolate chip cookies, Snickerdoodles, cupcakes, oatmeal raisin cookies, peanut butter cookies and banana breads come to mind.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Make fortune cookies. You can use any kind of cookie such as chocolate chip, peanut butter, sugar but enclose a little hand-typed fortune with each one, make it clever or a funny quote.      Rice-crispy treats always sell good, you can add walnuts, chocolate chips, m&ms, etc. and if you can shape them like something that will help them to sell (heart for example).    Meringue cookies are very easy to make, basically egg whites with sugar and other flavors. Do a search on All-recipes or other websites. I've made chocolate, vanilla, lemon, spice, walnut, etc.and you can add food colorings for variety too.   Make sure they are wrapped good. You can promote the ones without nuts as "fat-free" to people who are watching their weight, they may buy them when they won''t buy anything else.|`|PgPW8nfKaa	Chocolate Cookies<br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS<br>  1 (8-oz) box cream cheese<br>  1/2 cup butter<br>  1 teaspoon vanilla<br>  1 box chocolate cake mix (your favorite kind or whatever you have laying around)<br>  Confectioners sugar<br>  <br>  <br>  DIRECTIONS<br>  Pre-heat oven to 350F. Beat butter and cream cheese until well mixed. Add in vanilla. Beat in egg until well combined. Stir in chocolate cake mix.<br>  Take the mixture and put in a large plastic bag, cut the tip off of the bag and squeeze cookie dough out onto an ungreased cookie sheet (about the size of a walnut). Roll dough in powdered sugar. Bake for 11 minutes, cool on wire wrack, roll in powdered sugar again.<br>  <br>  Raisin Granola Cookies<br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS<br>  1 3/4 cups your favorite granola cereal<br>  1 1/2 cups flour<br>  1 cup butter<br>  3/4 cup sugar<br>  1 cup packed dark brown sugar**<br>  1 teaspoon salt<br>  1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>  1 egg<br>  1 cup raisins<br>  <br>  Preheat oven to 350F.<br>  In a large bowl mix all ingredients except for raisins.

Combine confectioners' sugar and flour; gently fold into egg mixture. Pour into an ungreased 10-in. tub pan. Bake on the lowest rack at 375 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until top crust is golden brown and cracks feel dry. Immediately invert cake in pan to cool completely. Loosen sides of cake from pan and remove. <br>  For glaze, melt butter in a saucepan. Stir in the confectioners' sugar and cinnamon. Add apple juice slowly until glaze is thin enough to drizzle.

Mix all ingredients together (if the dry ingredients don't coat the apples fully, just add more flour, sugar. cinnamon and nutmeg) and either put in your favorite pie dish or in a crust, dot with butter.

We had plain caramel and then we dipped some of the caramel apples in melted dark chocolate and drizzled white chocolate over them.  (Some we left just like that and some we rolled in nuts, M&M's, etc.  We put them in clear plastic bags and tied with a colorful ribbon.  We sold the caramel ones for $3 and the fancy ones for $5.  Hope you make big money!<br>  <br>  Oh and we sold bags of trail mix and chex mix and popcorn too!
pvNPsG4Uaa	ME AND MY MOM MADE THESE FOR SCHOOL JUST LAST EASTER>>>SHE KEPT THE RECIPE<br>  1 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting<br>  2 cups white sugar<br>  1 tablespoon light corn syrup<br>  1 1/4 cups water, divided<br>  4 tablespoons unflavored gelatin<br>  2 egg whites<br>  1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>   We used Emily's Famous Marshmallows recipe to make approximately 25 marshmallow chicks. The ingredients you will need are sugar, light corn syrup, eggs, unflavored gelatin, water, colored sugars, and vanilla extract. The cooking materials you will need are a large pastry bag, a whisk, an electric mixer, a candy thermometer, and waxed paper.<br>  <br>  2. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, stir together sugar, corn syrup, and 3/4-cup water. Bring the mixture to a boil. While boiling, attach a candy thermometer to the pot so the tip is immersed in the liquid, but not touching the bottom of the pot. Watch the temperature carefully until it reaches the hard-ball stage--when the thermometer reads 250 to 260 degrees F (121 to 129 degrees C).<br>  <br>  3. While the sugar mixture is heating, place the remaining water in a metal bowl and sprinkle the gelatin over it. Place the bowl over simmering water and stir until the gelatin is dissolved and the mixture becomes liquid. Keep this gelatin mixture warm until the sugar comes to the proper temperature. As soon as the sugar mixture reaches the hard-ball stage and you remove it from heat, carefully whisk in the gelatin mixture. Meanwhile, use an electric mixer to whip the egg whites into soft peaks. (You can tell eggs have reached the soft-peak stage when you take a spoon, dip it in and out of the egg mixture, and a peak is formed that is soft enough to quickly bend over.)<br>  <br>  4. Once the peaks have formed, set the electric mixer to medium speed and slowly pour the sugar mixture into the bowl of whipped egg whites. When pouring the sugar mixture into the mixing bowl, never let the stream of liquid grow larger than a pencil's width. Once all of the sugar has been incorporated into the egg whites, add the vanilla extract and continue mixing at a medium speed until the mixture cannot become any fluffier. Add any additional colorings or flavorings at this time.<br>  <br>  5.  Line a flat surface with waxed paper and sprinkle it with a generous coating of sugar. Use a large pastry bag with at least a 1/2-inch opening or tip. Carefully spoon the sticky marshmallow fluff into the bag and twist the top closed. Pipe the body of the chick shape first by making a thick line on the paper. Hold the bag at a 45-degree angle to the surface so that the piping will stand tall.<br>  <br>  6. When the body is long enough, pipe backwards on top of the body, and then make a little head.<br>  <br>  7. Place little candies onto the marshmallow chick's head to make eyes (if you like) and sprinkle colored sugar over the chick's body. To coat the marshmallow chicks completely, let them set for 30 minutes before buttering your hands (for easier handling) and rolling them in bowls full of colored sugar.<br>  <br>  8. Let the marshmallow chicks rest for approximately 4 hours to allow them time to fully set.|`|mcxn8tWGaa	to tell you the truth i don't have the exact recipe but normally i just make homemade marshmallow (recipes all over the web) than once there done i roll them in sugar!

hKlsJgVSaa	Brown is fine. It usually just means they have oxidized. <br>  <br>  When smelling beef a strong or more intense beefy smell is actually best because it shows that it has been aged.<br>  <br>  It it smells sour then pitch it.|`|Z8AhDCWEaa	bad meat has a fairly distinct odor.  Fresh meat will be almost odorless, but as meat ages/decays, then it will be pretty obvious.  As long as they were frozen in an airtight bag, then they should be fine! If you smell it and have to wrinkle your nose, then it is either bad, or is on its way.|`|Ozu3yDMFaa	Did you put them in the freezer immediately? If you did and there was a tiny hole in the packaging the brown coloring could just be due to air on the surface of the meat. If you flip them over and the bottom side is red that was probably the case and they are probably safe to eat. But my motto is "When in doubt throw it out". Better to be safe than sorry.|`|53giV6PFaa	Brown means that the blood in the meat oxidized doesn't mean meat is bad.  Smelling is the best way to tell if it is bad.  Beef should have a fresh meat smell.   Bad meat smells strange, sour-rotten smell.|`|VjyCjdHjaa	Bad beef has smell of fear. Because he knows he is been bad. You should set some ground rules.

Further more, how many ascribers of their faith stick to all its teachings?  I can think of a few Christians who murder, adulterate and steal.  Why are we to assume that Jewish people are more faithful?|`|IAfCPyAAaa	i think it depends somewhat on what kind of jew we're talking about here. there are orthodox jews, reform jews, probably other kinds of jews i don't even know about.<br>  <br>  i'm half heeb myself, and i know that during certain holidays like passover, wine is supposed to be consumed (some just use grape juice), though probably not in large amounts. i would doubt that getting drunk is kosher, but moderate drinking is probably just fine. <br>  <br>  my brother was a bar manager. he converted to judaism on his deathbed, so that he could be buried in the jewish cemetery with our father. the reception was held at the bar, and the rabbi showed up and drank a corona. maybe two. he was probably more 'hip' than like a strict orthodox jew though.|`|24d92bd0241aeea71cccfaf017c6c707aa	If it's koesher???|`|qLb81FkPaa	Yeah|`|tXXRLyFHaa	Yes, in fact there are verses in scripture commanding us to drink strong drink and be merry!

4b63df522adcbbe3effabc36048eabe4aa	It's your party therefore you must provide all the side activities and dishes. In other-words, your going to have to pay for the place you go, the food to supply 500+ people, the activities present, as well as anyone needed to be hired for the occasion. I think to many little teenager girls watch MTV's Sweet 16 and automatically think they need to have millions of people at they're party for it to be considered "cool". It has nothing to do with how many people are at the party, but how good the party is and who you share your sweet 16 moments with, your real friends. You can only invite 5 people and it could still be the best night of your life, also, by inviting more people you open the possibility of more fights or break-outs, arguments, and drama appearing, which ultimately ruins the night.<br>  <br>  I do hope your rich, otherwise you won't be able to afford everything. Providing food alone for 500+ people is expensive, your talking a lot of food and money, even if you spent $1.00 on each person, thats still $500.00 and I doubt your only spending a dollar each person. If you are spending $1.00 each person, then in the end the party is going to be lame because there wont be enough things for everyone. So in reality, the more people you invite the worse and harder the party is to accomplish, although you have a reverse mind-set due to MTV shows and hype built around Sweet 16's.<br>  <br>  Don't think just because it's your party you or your parents won't pay for anything. Your guests are your guests they are not suppose to provide anything or pay for anything, they are required to have a present in most cases, but that is all your suppose to ask from a guest, there mere presence at the party is enough. A guest is never suppose to provide anything but themselves. Take that into consideration as well.<br>  <br>  For 500+ people I couldn't really suggest any place, besides a ball-room. What else can you do with that many people? You can't go to a sporting event, Disneyland, or any other type of place which provides activities, because it will cost an outrageous amount for each person. Nobody wants to go to a party and have to pay for everything at the party, they're admission, they're present, they're food, etc. thats the exact thing that makes a party lame and people will not show up. I suggest you lower the list to under 50 unless your rich...|`|rIQXNxn5aa	Please DON'T bring liquor and weed. but cost could easily be in the $500 area with 500 people, so saying some can't make it, about 450. For a area, try a park or such.|`|I04sOgOOaa	You should probably learn to spell "liquor" before you actually drink it.

Separate eggs; discard yolks or refrigerate for another use. Measure egg whites, adding or removing whites as needed to equal 1-1/2 cups. Place in a mixing bowl; let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.<br>  <br>     2. Meanwhile, sift confectioners' sugar and flour together three times; set aside. Add cream of tartar, extracts and salt to egg whites; beat on high speed. Gradually add sugar, beating until sugar is dissolved and stiff peaks form. Fold in flour mixture, 1/4 cup at a time. Gently spoon into an ungreased 10-in. tube pan. Cut through batter with a knife to remove air pockets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Immediately invert pan; cool completely before removing cake from pan.

53giV6PFaa	Depends on what kind of cake mix you want to recreate.  However, here is a recipe for some common cakemixes.  Just pick which one you want to use.<br>  Ingredients:<br>  <br>      * 7-1/2 cups sifted flour<br>      * 1 Tbsp. salt<br>      * 4-1/2 cups sugar<br>      * 4 Tbsp. double acting baking powder<br>      * 3/4 cup cold butter<br>  <br>  Preparation:<br>  In very large bowl, combine flour, salt, sugar and baking powder and mix well to blend. Cut the butter into small pieces and place on food processor bowl along with 2 cups of the flour mixture. Cover and process until mixture is very fine.<br>  <br>  Divide the cake mix into three equal portions (about 4 cups each) by lightly scooping the mix into measuring cups and leveling off with the back of a knife. Place each portion into a quart glass jar or heavy duty zip lock plastic bags. Cover tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to a month, or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Each portion of cake mix will make two 8" cakes or one 13x9" cake.<br>  <br>  RECIPES<br>  <br>  Yellow Cake<br>  <br>  4 cups cake mix<br>  2 tsp. vanilla<br>  1/4 cup butter, softened<br>  3 eggs<br>  1 cup milk<br>  <br>  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour 2-8" round cake pans and set aside. Pour one portion of the cake mix into a large bowl. Make a well in center of mix and add vanilla, butter, eggs, and milk. Beat mixture 1 minute with electric mixer at low speed until blended. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl and beat 2 minutes longer at medium speed until batter is smooth.<br>  <br>  Pour into prepared pans and bake at 350 degrees for 30 - 40 minutes, or until cake springs back when pressed lightly in center and begins to pull away from edges of pan.<br>  <br>  White Cake<br>  <br>  Use 4 medium egg whites in place of 3 whole eggs. Do not beat whites separately, just add them to the mix along with the milk and vanilla.<br>  <br>  Spice Cake<br>  <br>  Add to the dry ingredients:<br>  <br>  1 tsp. ground cinnamon<br>  1/2 teaspoon allspice<br>  1/4 teaspoon cloves<br>  <br>  Chocolate Cake<br>  <br>  Add to the batter after initial blending:<br>  <br>  2 Tbsp. milk<br>  3 squares unsweetened chocolate, melted<br>  3 Tbsp. cocoa powder|`|28hFhC58aa	A basic homemade cake recipe will take the place of any boxed mix and taste so much better because you will be using fresh ingredients and leaving out the preservatives and additives!!

I wouldn't do that in baking though, because baking is an exact science.  1/2 & 1/2 will make your dish creamier, thicker, smoother and I think maybe you might use it more often.

It does not specify any BAC, just that the goal is to be intoxicated.  This makes much more sense.  Sometimes we do not know the alcoholic content of a drink and maybe indulge a bit too much, before we know it we're past the legal limit (which really only applies to driving, we all know that being 0.09 is legal anywhere outside of the driver seat).  Did we binge drink?  Psychologists would say so, and probably send us to rehab to repent for our sins.  Your average man on the street... no, not a binge drinking episode.<br>  <br>  In Russia, where alcoholism is more common (though still not to the point that we imagine it would be from our American point of view), they choose to define binge drinking as anyone who drinks continuously for 2 or more days.  There, these binge drinking episodes can last a week or more.  That's some serious binging.|`|Nxp9Ld3laa	4 or more drinks for women....although I don't think that is much if you spread it out over the course of an evening. If i'm going to the bars, I normally drink about 4 drinks in an hour to an hour and a half.<br>  <br>  In the United States, sometimes the term "extreme drinking" or "industrial-strength bingeing" is used to describe a more severe form of (single-evening) binge drinking; it is often defined as ten or more standard American drinks on a single occasion (sometimes as eight drinks for women).[9][10] If done over 2 to 3 hours, a typical adult would have a peak BAC of at least 0.20. This particularly hazardous (but less common) type of binge drinking was given a new name — presumably because the term "binge drinking" was no longer strong enough or had already been taken.

Braising - is a moist heat cooking method recommended for less tender cuts of meat. Braising is an excellent method for cuts with high amounts of connective tissue making them succulent and tender. For braising, meat is usually cut into serving-size portions rather than just cubes (as in stew).    Brown braising - the meat is browned (it may first be dusted with seasoned flour) in a small amount of oil, fat or butter in a heavy pan or casserole dish. The browned meat is placed on top of vegetables, or with them, and a relatively small amount of liquid is added. The meat is covered and cooked slowly at a low temperature on the top of the stove or in the oven. At the end of cooking the braising vegetables are removed, and a sauce is made from the cooking liquid. (Sometimes the vegetables are used in the sauce).    Tips on braising  Use the appropriate meat cut - meat cuts with a certain amount of marbling and gelatinous connective tissue retain juiciness better than very lean cuts when cooked long and slowly.    Browning meat - although browning is not essential, it is desirable since it not only improves colour but also develops flavour.    Tightly cover - a tight-fitting lid holds in the steam that helps to soften the connective tissue, making the meat more tender. A sheet of buttered baking paper placed over the meat, under the lid, helps to prevent the surface from drying. (To make a loose lid more tight-fitting, put a sheet of foil over the pan then cover with the lid).    Temperature control - after initial browning at a low temperature, maintaining a sub-simmer is important. While prolonged simmering or cooking close to the boil is necessary to soften connective tissue and make soft meat tender, it also dries lean meat out. As meat is heated, muscles coagulate and proteins shrink, squeezing out water. Cooking meat in liquid does not stop this water loss. For braising, oven temperature may be between 130C and 160 C, seldom higher.    Cooking time - overcooking can make braised meat dry and stringy. Cook a braise until just tender and check for readiness at intervals. If the meat is ready but the cooking liquid has not reduced enough to give a good sauce consistency, remove the meat (keep it covered so the surface does not dry) while you complete the sauce. Then return the meat to the hot sauce.    Beef steaks and cuts to braise  Shin steak, chuck steak, blade steak, thick skirt steak, flank steak, topside, silverside and thick flank steak, and oxtail are all less tender but tasty beef cuts good for braising.|`|gjs1GXdTaa	I made kabobs last night out of stew beef.

Spread the slightly softened ice cream in the pan and, using the wrap, roll the ice cream into a log. Cover tightly with wrap and freeze. When frozen put on a plate.

Let cool for a few minutes then turn the cake out onto a lightly floured or sugared towel. Using the towel, roll the cake into a log and let cool completely. Meanwhile, soften the ice cream to spreading consistency. When the log is cooled, unroll and spread the ice cream onto the cake, then roll it back into a log and freeze.

Salt can dry out your skin, which is the opposite you were drying to achieve by eating a cucumber!

You can use regular pasta since it's usually cheaper than whole wheat... or just use your favorite Cabonara recipe:    1. 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil   2. 3 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto or Canadian bacon, trimmed of fat and diced (1/2 cup)   3. 2 cloves garlic, minced   4. Pinch of crushed red pepper   5. 3 large eggs (pasteurized, if desired)   6. 3/4 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth   7. 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper   8. 12 ounces whole-wheat spaghetti or linguine   9. 8 ounces broccolini or broccoli rabe, stem ends trimmed, cut into 1/2-inch pieces   10. 1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese   11. Salt to taste     2. Cooking Directions  1. Put a large pot of water on to boil for cooking pasta. Also bring about 1 inch of water to a gentle simmer in the bottom of a double boiler (see Equipment Tip).   2. Heat oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add prosciutto (or Canadian bacon) and cook, stirring often, until heated through, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and crushed red pepper; cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Remove from heat.   3. Whisk eggs, broth and pepper in the top of the double boiler to combine. Set over the simmering water in the bottom of the double boiler and cook, whisking constantly in a slow, steady, figure-eight motion, until the sauce steams and thickens enough to coat a metal spoon, 5 to 7 minutes. The sauce may have a few small curdles. Remove the top pan from the heat and whisk the sauce rapidly so it does not continue to curdle.   4. Meanwhile, cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring often, for 5 minutes. Drop in broccolini (or broccoli rabe) and cook until the pasta is tender but firm, 4 to 6 minutes more. Drain and place in a large bowl. Add the egg sauce, the prosciutto (or bacon) mixture and cheese; toss to coat well. Season with salt, if desired.

HbQmDGb6aa	Yes. Blueberry is my favorite. I love making pies, mostly because I make "rolly-pollies" out of the extra dough (dough sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, then all rolled up with a bit of butter and baked together with the pie- I think they're even better than pie!! though the crust always has been my favorite part)<br>  Many here will probably cry, "unhealthy!", but I say eff it dude.

What you can do for a quick supper though is this: once you cooked your meat in a pan or whatever, remove the meat, add a liquid (either beef broth, strong black tea, or wine) and scrape the bottom of the pan to dissolve all the little bits and pieces of cooked meat and so on. Then, you add a little bit of a thickening agent such as corn starch, or browned flour (you just need to cook the flour in a pan until it is golden in color). Mix it, let it thicken and serve it.|`|jlKX6XfRaa	Gravy<br>  <br>  Recipe courtesy Alton Brown, 2008<br>  <br>      * RECIPE<br>      * COMMENTS & REVIEWS(1)<br>  <br>      *<br>        Cook Time<br>  <br>        12 min<br>      *<br>        Level<br>  <br>        Easy<br>      *<br>        Yield<br>  <br>        10 to 12 servings<br>  <br>  Close<br>  Times:<br>  <br>  Prep<br>      5 min<br>  Inactive Prep<br>      5 min<br>  Cook<br>      12 min<br>  Total:<br>      22 min<br>  <br>  Recipe Tools:<br>  <br>      * Print Recipe<br>      * Get Card<br>      * Save Recipe<br>  <br>  x<br>  Select a Card Size<br>  <br>      * CARD3x5 card<br>      * CARD4x6 card<br>  <br>  x<br>  Add To My Recipe Box<br>  Add To<br>  Or Create New Folder<br>  <br>  Please limit to 20 characters<br>  <br>  Adding Recipe<br>  Adding Recipe<br>  <br>  Add Or Do Not Add<br>  <br>  Success<br>  <br>  This recipe was added to your Folder_Name folder.<br>  <br>  Do not show this message again<br>  Close<br>  x<br>  Add To My Recipe Box<br>  <br>  Please sign in to add this recipe to your Recipe Box.<br>  <br>  Sign In or Create your Recipe Box<br>  Ingredients<br>  <br>      * 1 Good Eats Roast Turkey<br>      * 24 ounces reduced-sodium chicken broth (this is in addition to the pan drippings)<br>      * 8 ounces red wine<br>      * 1/3 cup all-purpose flour<br>      * 1 tablespoon chopped fresh herbs, oregano, thyme or rosemary<br>      * Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>  <br>  Directions<br>  <br>  Remove the turkey from the roasting pan, cover loosely with foil and set aside to rest.<br>  <br>  Place the pan over medium heat and add the broth and wine at the same time. Whisk to combine and deglaze the bottom of the pan. Once all of the bits have come off the bottom of the pan, cook in order to reduce slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the liquid to a fat separator and allow to sit for 5 minutes to allow fat to separate. Return the fat to the roasting pan and place over medium-high heat. Add the flour and whisk to combine. Cook, whisking continuously until the mixture starts to thicken and become smooth, approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Once this happens gradually add the liquid back to the pan and whisk until smooth and you have reached your desired consistency, approximately 5 to 6 minutes. Add the herbs and whisk to combine. Remember, your gravy should be slightly thin in the pan as it will thicken once you serve it.<br>  <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/gravy-recipe2/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/gravy...</a>|`|DoHaUEziaa	Well depending upon what type of gravy you want to make, it will vary. You can use 2 tablespoons of butter to one tablespoon of flour. Cook until it has a sandy consistency and slowly add milk, salt, pepper, onion powder and make a white/cream gravy. If you want chicken or beef. Start the same way, only instead of adding milk, add chicken or beef stock. You could put a little milk in that as well. Good luck.|`|f7CufkSyaa	cook your meat whether fry , roast or broil. take some of the meat like the fat and ends of roast, for example and put in food processor or blender if you can , take this and add to  the drippings the oil from the pan you cooked in add  some water and heat on stove .stir to loosen brown s from pan. take corn starch , a couple spoonfulls, and mix with cold water to take out the lumps, add to watery browns in pan and stir  to eliminate lumps add salt and spices to taste. i like some onion powder in mine. thats it , brown gravy.|`|V5Mw6rUtaa	this is easy. <br>  <br>  You need <br>  flour + butter = rue (thickening agent)<br>  meat drippings or broth<br>  seasoning= garlic, salt, pepper, parsley(optional) 4 taste<br>  <br>  1-2 TBS of butter melted<br>  add flour until it looks like peanut butter texture.<br>  slowly stir in meat drippings or broth and continue stirring on low heat until the right consitancy. <br>  Don't add too much, you can always add more after a few minutes.<br>  If it is too thick add a little milk or cream for a creamier sauce.<br>  Season to taste.

doz7RIoeaa	Not necessarily so. Remember that someone who eats meat even just once a week is not considered a vegetarian even though this person may eat more fresh produce than a vegetarian. Especially a vegetarian who relies on mock meats and processed foods. <br>  <br>  that is a common misconception among vegetarians. That people who eat meat eat nothing else. And that just because they ate unhealthy unbalanced meals before they became vegetarians, they assume that everyone else does too.  Stereotypes are not exclusive to any group.|`|2RzEaod9aa	Because veg*ns rely on plants for their main source of food, I'd have to say so.

qMBf2vgiaa	Sorry It's a bit long! BUT It's step by step like you asked<br>  Prepare the cigar. Make sure the cigar is properly cut, a cigar cutter would work best, but to save money or if you don't have one, use any other kind of blade. Make sure that the cut is sharp; you do not want jagged edges as these can lead to uneven burning of the tobacco. Double guillotine cutters are most frequently used because they almost always yield a perfect cut. The most manly way to cut a cigar is simply to bite the tip off. However this often only really works in films (some smokers can consistently, correctly bite). <br>  Remove the ring wrapper (not always necessary; many smokers prefer to leave the wrapper on until the heat from the smoking cigar melts the glue, causing the wrapper to veritably fall off of its own accord). [Note: It is considered rude to show off the brand of the cigar you are smoking by leaving the label on.] <br>  Light the cigar. Wooden matches or butane lighters are preferable as they impart no taste on the cigar. If you're using a wooden match, wait for the sulfur to burn off the end. Hold the flame up to the end and suck lightly with your mouth to draw the flame to the tip (not necessary if you're using a butane lighter). Don't inhale the smoke. An even light is one of the most important aspects of smoking a cigar; if necessary rotate the cigar around to ensure that the entire tip is lit. To check if the cigar is fully lit, turn the lit end towards your mouth and gently blow on it; the lit portions will light up orange. <br>  Smoke it. Hold the cigar up to your mouth and draw in smoke, hold it in your mouth for a few seconds to taste it, and then let it go. It's usually not a good idea to inhale cigar smoke. <br>  Repeat step 4 1-2 times a minute until you are done smoking it. Cigars can last really long (sometimes 2-3 hours). Rotate the cigar periodically to maintain an even burn on all sides. <br>  Extinguish it when done. Simply set it aside in the ashtray. The cigar will extinguish itself after a minute or two without you puffing on it. Before you set it down, gently blow through the cigar to expel any smoke that will go stale. After about half an hour, a cigar will give off a strong odor due to chemical buildup inside the stick. Relighting a cigar after this period has passed generally results in a strong, bitter taste; as a result, most aficionados prefer to throw out a smoked cigar.<br>  <br>  TIPS:<br>  <br>  Rolling your own cigars allows you to see exactly what is added and maybe add your own ingredients, and can also be fun and cheaper than buying the cigars. <br>  Buy a humidor if you will be storing the cigars for a long time. <br>  If your cigar keeps going out, it is either not a quality cigar or you are not puffing frequently enough. <br>  Every brand is different. Some stay lit better than others, some have bolder flavor. If you are starting out, get a mild stick (usually a lighter wrapper, such as a Cameroon, is a good first cigar). <br>  Having a drink with your cigar can enhance your experience. <br>  Be a polite smoker. Do not litter (real cigars are 100% biodegradable, unlike cigarettes, but wrappers sometimes aren't). <br>  Extinguishing and relighting a cigar after a varied amount of time (nicer cigars generally hold out longer) can take a toll on the flavor. <br>  Try 2-3 of a particular cigar before deciding that you don't like that line; individual sticks, even in the same box, can vary in flavor and satisfaction. <br>  Learn how to pair cigars as a dessert or accompaniment to a meal. <br>  Beware smoking in windy conditions; the wind can cause an uneven or fast burn, as well as blowing ash into your eyes. <br>  You don't need to constantly ash your cigar: the trademark of a well-rolled cigar is that the ash will remain on the end of it for quite a while (many cigars will have 1 to 1.5 inch ashes); just make sure your ash doesn't fall all over yourself. <br>  <br>  WARNINGS:<br>  <br>  By no means are cigars healthy; however, cigars often have less nicotine and other chemicals than cigarettes. <br>  Do not inhale the cigar! Especially if you are very conscious of the health effects, you will know that they can be minimized, (but never eliminated) if you don't inhale. Cigarettes were meant to be inhaled because they have filters. Some Cigarettes don't have filters though. <br>  Even just puffing will have nicotine and other ingredients absorbed by the lining of your mouth. <br>  Don't just think about the long-term health effects of smoking - there are also many temporary, short-term effects as well. Any kind of smoke contains carbon monoxide, a gas that depletes your body of oxygen, and affects your physical ability until it leaves about 6 hours later. <br>  Consider making your own cigars (see related articles) and stuffing it with something less harmful than tobacco if you really have the urge to light and smoke something. <br>  Despite some minimal risks, many physicians actually encourage cigar (and pipe) smokers to continue smoking up to three times a week because the psychological benefit|`|XwLjFq3Laa	insert in mouth<br>  light the outter end with lighter<br>  inhale slowly<br>  remove cigar<br>  breath out|`|Bp7Yfsqyaa	Cut the end for your mouth.  Light with a lighter, using short puffs, until you have a good burn.  Note:  Cigars are not like cigarettes.  Cigarette smoke is meant to be inhaled.  Cigar smoke is meant to be kept in the mouth and tasted.  Inhaling cigar smoke is a good way to get sick as hell.  Puff in until you have a decent amount of smoke in your mouth.  Roll your tongue through it and enjoy the flavor.  Then, exhale.<br>  <br>  Repeat.|`|BGw4DGd1aa	<a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+smoke+a+cigar%3F" rel="nofollow">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+smoke+a+ciga...</a><br>  <br>  Look at that site for loads of tips.

VPpZ2TbQaa	Depends on the type of vegetarian you are. One type does not eat any meat, at all. Another will eat fish. Another will not eat any meat but drinks milk and eats eggs. Another refrains from eating anything taken from any animal - including dairy products; cheese, milk, yogurt, eggs, etc.|`|csUUr11gaa	Any sort of meat based product. Hence "veggie" tarian, lol.  They also eat fruit, veggies, nuts, etc.<br>  <br>  The only argument I've heard between vegetarians was whether fish counted as meat or not.  I think that it counts as meat because it's a vertebrate organism that bleeds.  However, many vegetarians that I've known actually eat fish.|`|uPRYwa3zaa	meat<br>  <br>  are you becoming full vegan or just vegetarian, because if you're a vegan you can't wear leather or animal products like belts and certain shoes, you also can't eat honey or dairy products, and you can't use make up/ medicine tested on animals. if you ask me it sounds like too much of a hassle|`|ANsznbWsaa	Well that all depends on if you are vegetarian or vegan. The list is way longer for vegans. Vegetarian, no meat, no eggs, and sometimes no dairy but I never took it that far.<br>  Vegans, no animal products at all.<br>   visit the vegan society website if that's what you are interested in.|`|a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	Vegetarians do not eat fish!

There are different categories of vegetarians so you'll have to decide for yourself how far you want to take it based on your personal reason(s) for adopting a vegetarian diet.<br>  <br>  Vegan: The pure vegetarian. No animal flesh nor animal products at all (eggs, dairy, honey, or any other animal bi products). Vegans do not purchase or use materials with animal products in them (ie. leather shoes, silk clothing, goose down pillows); nor do they use products that have been animal-tested.<br>  <br>  Ovo Vegetarian: Does not eat animal flesh, dairy, nor other products of animal slaughter such as gelatin. The only exception is that they eat eggs.<br>  <br>  Lacto vegetarian: Does not eat animal flesh, eggs, nor other products of animal slaughter. The only exception is that they eat dairy products such as milk, ice cream, yogurt and cheeses.<br>  <br>  Lacto Ovo Vegetarian: Does not eat animal flesh nor animal slaughter products, but does eat dairy and eggs. This is the most common vegetarian.<br>  <br>  Pescatarian: A Lacto Ovo Vegetarian that also eats seafood. ie. fish, shellfish, calamari ( They fall under the category listed next).<br>  <br>  Flexitarian (aka Semi-Vegetarian): Someone who eats mostly a lacto ovo vegetarian diet, but will include animal flesh and animal slaughter products in their diet once in awhile.|`|xssqrr7Yaa	It depends on if you are a true vegetarian or not.  Obviously that means no meat.  If you illiminate dairy, then no milk or cheese or anything made with it, so you couldn't have cookies, (eggs), no pizza,(cheese), no bread made with milk or egg, no cake, no fish, no pasta,   no creamed soups or many other processed foods.  You would stick to veggies, you could have peanut butter (and other nuts) and beans so you would still be getting protein through. You could have soy milk though and tofu, all sorts of fruits and veggies.|`|tHEBPDenaa	im a vegetarian and i dont eat any meat... no beef, pork, chicken, seafood, etc. anything that was once alive! however i'm not a vegan and i do eat cheese, eggs, milk, etc.<br>  <br>  some vegetarians eat chicken and fish although i don't really consider that to be a vegetarian at all...|`|oqh9KThCaa	i think anything that had a face, dairy and eggs..

829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	NOOO!!<br>  You'll overcook them.<br>  Either just boil and serve or fry and serve( not both).<br>  You can boil them frozen but I would thaw them for frying.<br>  I like to bread them for frying.<br>  If they're small shrimp, butterfly them before you bread them.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	NO NO NO. You will get little fried piueces of ruber if you boil them first. Shrimp cook very very fast.<br>  <br>  Make a beer batter. It has a good taste.<br>  <br>  Beer batter:<br>  1 cup flour<br>  1 palm full salt<br>  1 small pinch salt<br>  1 beer-what ever flavor you normally have around<br>  <br>  Mix the dry ingredients and the slowly add the beer. It will foam up as you add the beer just keep whisking. The consistency you want depends on how you like your breading, more breading of course a thicker batter and almost a little fluffier. For a thinner crunchier batter then you of course want a thinner batter. I like min a medium thickness.<br>  <br>  Then dredge the frying food in plain flour first then the beer batter. Gently wipe the tip of the dipped item on the edge of the bowl, it will re-coat as gravity makes it run down and coat perfectly.<br>  <br>  Lower the food in the hot oil and hold on to it for about 10 seconds, this helps to keep it from sticking to the bottom, other pieces being fried, and the heating element if you a frier.<br>  <br>  Fry until golden brown and it floats.<br>  <br>  Drain on paper towels or brown paper bags laid out on a plate or cookie sheet. You can pop them in the oven on warm as you fry all the batches.|`|7KcVSB3Uaa	FYI, to thaw shrimp fast, just run hot water over them for a minute; small shrimp thaw almost instantly.|`|v4vQSzu4aa	Smaller shrimp thaw quickly if you run them under a cold water drip or defrost them in the refrigerator a day in advance.  I don't advise boiling AND sauteing Shrimp for any size, as they cook quickly and will taste like rubber bands with a nasty sea smell upon the finished product.  If you boil the shrimp, look for a pure white color, with no fleshy appearance (watch and don't leave the pot) and for sauteing, the same thing.  Don't leave the pan and look for all around white color. When in doubt, pick one up and taste it...............When in doubt, take them out sooner than later with boiling and ice down right away, in sauteing, remember that even though you turn the heat off from the pan, it doesn't mean that the heat is not still going on inside your shrimp, so yes, 30 seconds does make a difference. Hope some of these suggestions help you to make succulent shrimp, it's not hard but you do have to babysit the pan, but only for a couple of moments.  Have a GREAT weekend!|`|kqmuAa5uaa	you dont have to boil it.. bcause shrimp cooks very fast.. <br>  if you buy the uncooked shrimp, it will change colour to reddish, then you know it is cooked.<br>  its also okay to boil it when its frozen. but i think its better to defrost it first so they wont break. they have very soft texture.<br>  <br>  to fry it i would coat it in flour mixture to make it like mini tempura's|`|pR2hy0bjaa	Don't boil it then fry it unless you want weird tasting shrimp. Also try to wait and defrost it before frying it. If you don't defrost first the shrimp will tak longer to cook and Oil will Splatter everywhere.|`|2e99b2fd412a8d5cf0a0c9c0efb89960aa	shrimp is very simple food and just to boil it takes minutes... so, you don't need to boil them first... this ill overcook the shrimp and you will lost all the good taste it has!<br>  Just make sure its defrosted and no too wet (I sometimes dry them with paper towel before fry), so this will make easy to fry!<br>  I loooove shrimp and its one of the easier food!!

b73296a75da0c37af734e3ef9c03113baa	Good Grief! What nonsense these guys are feeding you! Of course you can be vegetarian here in the West. There are vegetarian societies and many wonderful foods available both in our ethnic grocery stores and restaurants as well as our health food stores and supermarkets.  Not to worry you will not starve and you may even enjoy the experience of exploring other culture's vegetarian foods .|`|khXGGBiTaa	Yes, depends which west you mean. West coast USA, especially California and Oregon, has a lot of vegetarian and vegetarian-friendly restaurants. West coast India would be extremely vegetarian-friendly. Western China wouldn't. Western Australia should be ok, especially in the big cities. West Africa would be mixed, depending on which country. I had no problems finding vegetarian food in the west of England, Scotland and Wales last August. You should be able to manage in western Europe and definitely in western New Zealand.|`|AA11485682	What west? There's lots of wests out there.

I've read stories from Vegans who have had to move because they had to order so much stuff in.<br>  <br>  Now the West Coast - totally different - Western Oregon and California are havens for vegetarians.
03cLY4H8aa	The main dish of the Chinese cuisine may include anything from rice, noodles to steamed buns or mantou.  <br>  <br>  The staple diets in Northern China are: mantou, bing (Chinese flatbread) and wheat noodles; as for the South: rice, rice noodles and rice congee. <br>  <br>  By Municipality, Province or Region: <br>  Beijing - Peking duck, hot pot <br>  Fujian - Fotiaoqiang, popiah <br>  Guangdong - Dim sum, slow cooked soup, siu mei, century egg <br>  Shanghai - Xiaolongbao, shengjian mantou, red-cooked stews, Shanghai hairy crab <br>  Sichuan - Mapo doufu, Kung Pao chicken, Twice Cooked Pork, málà hotpot <br>  Tibet - Momo dumplings <br>   Hong Kong - egg tart, dim sum, roast goose, wonton noodle soup [2], pineapple bun [3] <br>   Macau - Galinha à Portuguesa, baked pork chop bun. <br>   Taiwan - Suncake, Stinky tofu, Ba wan, Beef noodle soup|`|5zNwBQZHaa	China is huge and its regions have their own specialties.

It is definately not something you would always find at Panda Express, unless it's white rice. I'd say that if they did have one, it would probably be white rice, but that's only their staple food, not a dish.  I think in North-Eastern China it would be dumplings and noodles (specifically in soup); In Northern, it would be noodles (specifically noodle soup) or Peking duck; Southern...I don't really think they have a specific dish they would eat all the time because Southern China usually has a bigger variety of food choices (I believe they either have more KFCs or Pizza Huts than America).  <br>  <br>  Peking duck only represents Northern China.
5zNwBQZHaa	Yes - they release new flavors just about every March or there abouts.<br>  <br>  I heard the next flavor is going to be Bubble Gum flavored! <br>  <br>  :-)<br>  <br>  Just kidding - but there will be a new flavor in the next month.|`|bmoCpcdraa	yes|`|JmrQ5Ckmaa	yeah...its called onion butt flavor

Furthermore, EVERYONE'S a comedian. For some reason, loads of people who have no sense of the incongruous or the ludicrous, at all, nevertheless feel compelled to try their hand at comedy.  And then they get their feelings hurt when one isn't amused by their lame jokes. Blech. Last time I checked, this was a free country where we could decide for ourselves what was really funny.

f262cda35c3c0959f3b4089b38f0359faa	It would not be a good idea you run the risk of overcooking.<br>  <br>  If you do not own a steamer large enough and do not wish to invest in one just yet, you can improvise and rig up a simple make-shift steamer with equipment that you already have in your kitchen. Use a large pot wide enough and deep enough to accommodate the dish (heatproof or stainless steel bowl) that you will use for steaming, preferably with a domed lid. Fill pot with 1 1/2 to 2 inches of water, and use some kind of trivet or an inverted bowl placed on the bottom of the pot for the dish holding the food to be steamed to sit on. Bring water in the pot to a boil, cover and steam as instructed.
eAobNmUTaa	No.  I have never heard of added gelatin to yogurt.|`|d41bd2987be2bbb3bb7086e0162c5b82aa	If the label doesn't say gelatin, check and see if it has fruit pectin. Fruit pectin is an alternative thickening agent. If it doesn't list either, I wouldn't eat it just to be safe. Look out for lecithin; if it doesn't say soy lecithin or lecithin derived from vegetables, it MIGHT have animal-derived lecithin. Stonyfield Farm is a vegetarian-friendly yogurt (for future reference). And you're right, MOST YOGURTS DO NOT CONTAIN GELATIN =)|`|c4058327d20f41accfd1c3c424c72f6faa	If something is part of the "process" of making the product, it does not need to be put on the label at all.  For example, adding sugar to honey to prevent it from gumming up the machinery.  Since the sugar is added as part of the "process" and is not intended as an ingredient, it need not be listed on the label.  Same when they boil something and add oil to it as a "defoaming agent" to prevent the product from foaming up and boiling over.  There are ALL SORTS of hidden ingredients, and it's all perfectly legal.  The whole rule book on labelling is designed for the benefit of the manufacturer, not the consumer.|`|HygXYa0qaa	Sometimes there is gelatin in yogurt.<br>  <br>  If there is no label i wouldn't eat.<br>  <br>  Better safe then sorry.|`|llkSmgLJaa	Read the ingredient list, all additives have to be listed, atleast in the USA.|`|9f7c8164ca2d49e24413295051f36abaaa	Actually, it is the other way around. Most yogurts contain gelatin. Only a few do not. To test this theory go to the grocery store and try to find yogurt that does not contain gelatin Good luck!!<br>  <br>  Yoplait, Dannon, Activa, etc, etc... All of them contain gelatin.

They try to tell themselves that it's necessary, but our very existence proves that it's not. But they don't want to face this guilt, because that would mean they would have to--gasp!--change. So instead of changing to become better people, they bully vegetarians to make themselves feel in control. <br>  <br>  It's sad really.

cLa7nwhcaa	In the olden days, chicken feet were kept in making Chicken broth. The feet had the highest concentration of connective tissue resulting in ample gelatin. The best thing was the golden yellow color rendered by the skin of the feet. Nowadays, you add food color or Turmeric to get the color.<br>  Anyway, going back to the issue of chicken feet. I made chicken broth by cooking it in the pressure cooker for about 30 minutes. At then, I could never find the chicken feet they were actually dissolved.<br>  Yes, it is mostly a thick skin.

e4ffd05d5175695c64fc913b628c28a3aa	Its the most successful one of all the marketing strategies ever played in the history of sales. You know what Maggie started its business at least a couple of decades ago yet they market it on the same slogan. Also they call it new. Most people don't measure the time while cooking as its indicated on the cover as 2mins but it literally means 2mins for the noodles to soak and turn smooth in water. They are just bothered about their product and not the time taken for boiling the water and cutting the packet. Also they exhibit a completely garnished end product in a dish. If you chop all the vegetables and cook it'll easily take 30mins.<br>  <br>  Cheers..!!|`|MRmyZX4Baa	Dr it true that it doesn't take 2 mins but it doesn't even take 2o mins also.

Choose something everyone will like, fitting your budget, and not too fancy if someone asks for the recipe since you are passing it off as your own.  <br>  Go to the dollar store and pick up a round metal tray with some design on it or plain if that is all they have. Purchase a doily that will be placed on tray. <br>  Go to the market and get some fresh fruit or berries. <br>  Take it all home. <br>  Place the doily on the tray, the cake in the middle, and cut up fruit or berries around the cake. Be sure to fill the sides edge to edge (cake to edge of tray or platter.) <br>  <br>  Its a huge success and everyone will think you have great talents in the kitchen. For that matter you can use the same idea and bake your own cake from a cake mix. Follow directions on box precisely and the cake should be great. Follow my guidance on everything else. <br>  <br>  You can also let flower petals try out and put it around the cake to look pretty instead of fruit. I like the fruit because of the vast array of colors and you can eat it too.|`|9LFjvDzzaa	Heya. I'll give you a few ideas, ranging from pretty simple to looks-fancy-but-is-easy-to-make.<br>  <br>  This is extremely easy and it tastes good. Then again, not sure how proud you'll be to serve beans'n'weeners to your peers. Get two large cans of pork and beans (can be bought in the soup aisle of your grocery store); add a pack of beef or turkey hot dogs cut into 1/2 inch slices. It's pretty tasty, super cheap, and nothing's easier, but it's not very fancy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Something else you could do is cut pieces of bread into two circles; crumble the rest. Spread some butter and garlic on it and bake them until crispy. Boil some rigatoni pasta, drain it when done, and mix a meaty sauce directly into the pasta. Then spoon small amounts of the pasta onto the baked bread and sprinkle with garlic and rosemary.<br>  <br>  <br>  Strawberry pretzel salad is also good, but it's a dessert. Using a casserole dish or baking pan, bake some already-made prezel in a mixture of a little sugar, and butter; then cool and cover with cream cheese. Make some strawberry jello and fill it with strawberries, then pour it over the mixture so that it's about 1 - 1 1/2 inches thick and cover it with whipped cream. It's delicious. :)<br>  <br>  You could also try something that looks and tastes great... Boil some rice in chicken flavoring and add sauteed carrots, mushrooms, snow peas, and red pepper. Add the vegetables to it when the rice is done and mix them in; let it steam cook. It has tons of flavor and it looks good. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|v1xyZj3Caa	well how about you make dessert?<br>  candy sushi is a good idea!<br>  <br>  take fruit by the foot,<br>  rice krispies<br>  and swedish fish!<br>  <br>  cut the rice krispies out and lay it on the fruit by the foot.<br>  then take the swedish fish and wrap it inside, like a sushi roll.<br>  <br>  its so yummy, i made it for my english class my junior year of highschool lol, they liked it!<br>  :)<br>  <br>  goodluckk|`|4bedkpvLaa	I am a professional caterer and chef here are some recipes that I have created over the years.<br>  <br>  Beef Enchiladas II <br>  Simple and quick beef enchiladas.

NXAk99qWaa	Kristin, if you're using a traditional-style corkscrew (the kind with "arms" to each side of the screw itself), use this method:<br>  <br>  * position tip of screw in the centre of the cork<br>  * while holding the corkscrew in position, turn the handle clockwise (you will need to push down at the start)<br>  * as the screw enters the cork, the arms will lift up<br>  * once the arms are at the top of the corkscrew, pull them down<br>  * this will raise the screw out of the bottle neck and (hopefully) also the cork<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  PB.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	If it's the cork kind, you can use a pen knife.  But it's worth it to get a wine opener because you'll end up with cork in your wind any other way.|`|BGw4DGd1aa	You people sicken me first off <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+open+a+bottle+of+wine+with+out+a+corkscrew%3F" rel="nofollow">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+open+a+bottl...</a> secondly - its not a "wine opener thingg" its a cork screw a 10 year old knows that.

fwnqB0dTaa	It's OK to start when it becomes legal to do so, which (despite some answerers here who think that everyone answering is American) may not be 21.<br>  <br>  Having said that, there's nothing wrong with a glass of wine with meals occasionally, or at Christmas etc.<br>  <br>  Having said that I started drinking with meals, at Christmas, New Year etc when about 12, and started drinking in pubs well before it was allowed by law - and it's done me no harm.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	It is not OK for teens to start drinking before they get out of bed in the morning.<br>  <br>  Seriously, the dose makes the poison. If she drinks in moderation, there is nothing wrong with drinking every weekend, except that it is illegal here in the U.S. The trouble is that teens rarely do anything in moderation  and may try to drive while under the influence.|`|tvdabilNaa	I think kids should be educated and taught to drink with family from an early age (school age).  I was brought up having wine with dinner (watered down at first) and a light cocktail on special occasions.

There are also plenty of irresponsible 40 year olds who can't manage their drinking.<br>  <br>  In some countries it is perfectly legal to drink at 18. In the US, the current legal age is 21 in every state.  It used to be lower and more regulated by individual states.  My personal observation over the years indicates that changes in legal ages hasn't actually changed the average age at which kids start experimenting with alcohol, which is 15-16 as your sister tells you.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is judge your sister, not her age.  If you feel her drinking is out of control, then you need to talk to her about it, without regard to how hold she is.|`|AA10953999	Well, if they are old enough to go to war..... <br>  <br>  Drinking once in a while is fine but drinking every weekend is going to leave her with liver damage.

Yes. It'll kick in a few minutes after you consume it, and last for about half an hour or so. Anything that lasts longer than that is either from caffeine, some other stimulant in the drink, or from the artificial colours (some of which can make you "hyper" for up to 2 days).|`|NWl78qI3aa	yes,u could kill yourself if you have had too much sugar!you could get very obese,and die,or your blood pressure could rise insanely high and you could die.and yes,you can get really hyper from drinkin a power drink,and then havin koolaid right after,cuz its loaded with sugar,and that could make you VERY hyper!!|`|KXpd5kI3aa	well i heard you can 'overdose' on anything .. to much of one thing thats not so much healthy will some day kill you im sure .. <br>  <br>  But if you eat loads of sugar this very minute . then no its not going to .<br>  <br>  And i would guess you would get hyper from the other thing , considering you usualy get hyper of energy drinks and if you take sugar in right after . then im sure you will .

NXAk99qWaa	Hi Mel! The MAIN tasks of a bartender (although there are plenty), are to serve customers the drinks that they order in a friendly manner, and to provide answers to various questions that a customer may have - for example, what mixer goes well with Gin; can you suggest a good Rum based cocktail; what wine would you recommend with a rare loin of venison?!<br>  <br>  Our role is also to keep an eye out for trouble starting when people have a "few too many", and to clean up smashed glass, blood and worse - but let's not talk about that ;-)<br>  <br>  PB.|`|V7JVKApkaa	To take drink orders, prepare them, serve them, collect funds, cut limes/lemons, check ID's, wash and stock glasses, tell lame jokes, overlook my insobriety, call me a cab.|`|BGw4DGd1aa	to water the plants.<br>  <br>  think about it.

1nVVUpGYaa	The trick is to start with yukon gold potatoes.  I use butter, cream, salt, pepper, and my seceret ingrediant is sour cream.  This makes them richer and adds some great flavor.  I add chives, a head of roasted garlic (you can also buy garlic paste in the grocery store) (I love garlic, so add to your own taste).  Def. Try the sour cream though|`|njrKjJVwaa	put a little bit ground nutmeg in it, it tastes wonderful, but dont use too much.|`|d89416ed0e27a36978e0ba1cb1b5608eaa	I love to add the following yummy things to mashed potatoes:<br>  <br>  Sauteed leeks and garlic<br>  Cooked & flaked salmon, hard boiled egg and dill sauce - pretty much a meal in itself!<br>  Cheese, obviously - one which melts really well e.g. Mozzarella <br>  Cooked chicken pieces & pesto<br>  Pesto by itself<br>  Cooked & mashed carrot (50/50 with the potato) or swede/sweet potato<br>  Doritos - odd I know but really good for some reason!<br>  Sour cream and chives <br>  <br>  You can really use your imagination - have fun!<br>  <br>  Riley.|`|b0iUaUJXaa	I would like to suggest to you to make mashed potatoes using Yukon Gold potatoes.Yummy-they taste like butter even before you put butter on them.You could buy one and make a baked potato in the microwave just to get an idea what they taste like.|`|KbnUq585aa	Adobo seasoning(with black pepper)really does a lot to bring out flavors in bland things; that, sour cream or buttermilk and/or a little vinegar or lemon.|`|Ixb3nCIDaa	a bit of salt and pepper does the trick for me.<br>  or add spices you like as well|`|CiFR2xuBaa	cheddar cheese and garlic.......yummmyyyy|`|6qGY4cljaa	Well, you could add herbs such as rosemary, sage, and thyme to give your potatoes kick. Black pepper is generally used, but you could add chili powder and cumin for a more Southwestern flair. Possibly, you can add sauteed onion and garlic. Buttermilk also helps give mashed potatoes a nice edge. Using cream instead of milk will give the potatoes more volume. Meat stock will lend a meaty flavor. And lastly, instead of using butter, cream cheese lends a nice flavor.|`|eAobNmUTaa	I love Russets for the best mashed potatoes.  Boil them gently with a good amount of salt until fork-tender, then drain.  Ensure they are completely dry.  Add a generous amount of butter and light cream (half & half), that has been heated.  Adding these ingredients cold will seize up the potatoes and make them less fluffy.  Taste to season with kosher salt/cracked black.  Optional additions - chives, roasted garlic, pesto, truffle oil.|`|9LFjvDzzaa	Yum! I love these kinds of potatoes. I don't know if you're making them from scratch or using a box mix, but either way, in the mashing process, add some chedder cheese, garlic seasoning, maybe some rosemary and bits of bacon or broccoli... Mmm, delicious! Great with some meat, like salisbury steak or meatloaf.|`|FkxiRWpVaa	add some finely chopped onions which are fried...then add some red fried chillies and mustard oil.....add some bits of mixed vegetables and then serve it immediatelt|`|AA10985522	My ex-mother-in-law used to add mayonnaise.|`|JX0I6x1paa	Instead of milk use sour cream.

Slice them up into 1/2 inch thick slices and sautee with green beans and slices of onion with garlic, salt, and pepper in a little olive oil. Good wice rice and buttered noodles.<br>  <br>  2. Bake with sliced mushrooms, red peppers, carrots, and snow peas. Very easy, and it has a lot of flavor. ^^<br>  <br>  3. Wrap the sausages in dough and cover with your favorite seasonings; then fry and sprinkle with cheese. Kind of like a super tasty Italian corn dog.<br>  <br>  4. Serve sliced over pasta, either pasta with olive oil/garlic/buttery flavor, or with a tomato-based sauce. Now that I think of it, it'd be nice with alfredo, too. :)<br>  <br>  5. Wedding soup with the sausage slices. Boil a little pasta (preferably small pasta pieces, not anything like rigatoni or fettucini) in chicken broth and don't drain it; add cut-up celery, onions, and spinach. Fry or bake the sausage and then rip it into bite-size pieces and add it in; also add a few torn slivers of boiled or grilled or baked chicken to make this into a super hearty meal.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|21a437ee35c55754a09c8056ed529cb1aa	Yes, you can put them in the oven.<br>  <br>  CHICKEN & SAUSAGE STEW<br>  <br>  3 red bell peppers, roasted, skins and seeds removed<br>  1 lb. boneless chicken thighs or breasts<br>  ? lb. sweet Italian sausage<br>  Salt and pepper to taste<br>  Olive oil, as needed<br>  1 medium-large onion, chopped<br>  5 cloves of garlic, chopped<br>  3 cups chicken broth<br>  2 batches of baby spinach<br>  Chopped parsley to taste<br>  <br>              Roast the peppers by placing them in a pre-heated broiler, or on top of a gas stove burner until they are charred.

EMDNVrcjaa	I had an Eiswein in Germany, translated "ice wine" . It is really sweet. I liked it so much I bought 10 bottles of it! <br>  <br>  The grapes for ice wine are naturally frozen. This means that the grapes are picked by hand in the wee hours of the morning just after the first frost hits. It also means no other method for freezing the grapes can be used. In other words, grapes can't be placed in the freezer to make ice wine. If this inferior method is used, the wine must have a different name.<br>  <br>  Once the grapes are harvested, they're immediately pressed. The water, actually bits of ice, is what's extracted. The intense flavor comes from the highly concentrated sugar and acid, which didn't freeze. After being pressed, the ice wine is stored in oak barrels for several months while it ferments.|`|4bedkpvLaa	last week I had a bottle of 1982 Chateau Lafite with the some of the other board members at my company it was splendid and some of the best I have ever had.|`|MlhiDi8paa	Kanu Keystone '04: tobacco & blackcurrant, with firm oak tannins.<br>  South African, Western Cape wine is the best.|`|XKhNw221aa	anything by Boone's farm|`|DT2mU1jOaa	A  Sauterne: Chateau La Tour-Blanche (Bommes) <br>   but I also had a nice 1881 Martino Porto|`|63Ac7vDyaa	I love Sangria wine its so yummy!

I bet you have the heat on too high, you need a moderate (medium) heat and make sure you turn them several times to ensure even cooking. If you haven't got the time to watch over them then put them on a baking tray and cook them in the oven for about 20 mins, turning once or twice, I cook mine this way sometimes and they taste just as good.|`|a6j7Bu9daa	they would cook, but i imagine they would be full of grease because it comes out when you fry them or grill them.

Add a pack of taco bell brand taco seasoning mix..and water like the package says. <br>  Once the cheese is melted and the meat is browned. Add it to the melted cheese. Or serve it seperatly by adding it in your individual bowls. Add more milk to make it dippable. I like to add green onions tops chopped and a cup of salsa or 1/2 can of Rotel. And serve with homemade fried tortillas or store bought chips. YOu can arrange the chips then pour the dip over and add some guacamole, sour cream and cilantro on the top for nachos.<br>  Use your imiganation, add black beans, jalapenos, black olives green chilis. Anything you think is mexican oriented!<br>  <a href="http://www.travelblog.org/Photos/577124.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.travelblog.org/Photos/577124....</a><br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.theimpulsivebuy.com/images/steaknachosbellgrande.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.theimpulsivebuy.com/wordpress/2005/10/24/taco-bell-steak-nachos-bellgrande/&usg=__YLgdoj5R0dbZb6IdxSibqNQjv-0=&h=313&w=450&sz=25&hl=en&start=4&um=1&tbnid=ShZa5dTlthJzBM:&tbnh=88&tbnw=127&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dnachos%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26newwindow%3D1%26safe%3Doff%26rls%3Dcom.microsoft:*:IE-SearchBox%26rlz%3D1I7DKUS%26sa%3DG" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...</a><br>  <a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/ChinuaMelton/Rn8B02U7-WI/AAAAAAAAEkI/xkI7Cpo96RY/rotel_cheese_dip.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://lh6.ggpht.com/ChinuaMelton/Rn8B02...</a><br>  <br>  When you reheat it it will be stiff. just add more milk while your melting in the defrost setting again.
tMURptI6aa	I was watching the Travel channel the other day, and I learned that ppl in Japan use almost every part of the turtle for consumption - even the blood. <br>  It showed a man drain the blood out, pour it into glasses, then add alcohol. <br>  In other cultures, ppl drink small amounts of various animal blood as a part of ancient rituals. And I'm not talking about crazy sacrifices either. Sometimes the animals are not even harmed except for one small cut. <br>  So apparently, some ppl DO like the taste - or at least they aren't grossed out by it. <br>  As long as you're not cutting yourself for the sole purpose of tasting it, you don't have a problem. It's also possible that you were simply happy to have satisfied a curiosity. Since you are into vampire stories right now, you were sort of subconsciously predisposed to the idea that it has a nice taste.|`|4bedkpvLaa	Blood soup (recipe)<br>  From Cunnan<br>  Jump to: navigation, search<br>  [edit]Ingredients <br>  2.5kg duck OR 2kg spare ribs, OR 2kg pork loin ribs. <br>  Fowl trimmings (if available) <br>  3.75L water <br>  2 bay leaves <br>  4 whole cloves <br>  4 whole peppercorns <br>  4 tbs flour <br>  1 tbs sugar <br>  2 tbs salt <br>  2 tbs pepper <br>  1/2 c vinegar <br>  1 cup whipping cream or sour cream <br>  Apples: peeled, cored and chopped into 1cm pieces <br>  Dried fruit: 250g pitted prunes, 250g raisins <br>  2 cups duck or goose blood OR 1/2 cup pig blood. <br>  [edit]Method <br>  In a pot, cover meat and fowl trimmings with water and boil slowly for 1-3 hours, depending on the size and age of the duck. <br>  Skim foam from top of soup <br>  Place spices in cheese cloth bag and add to soup. <br>  Continue to boil slowly until meat is tender. <br>  Remove meat and spice bag from soup. Reserve meat to be added back later. <br>  Take out 1 cup of boiling stock and set aside. <br>  Add fruit to soup. <br>  Boil until apples are soft. <br>  In a separate bowl, blend the flour, sugar, salt and pepper into 1/2 cup of the blood until smooth. <br>  Add cream to the flour mixture. Mixture should be a light paste. <br>  Add the 1 c of hot soup stock and mix until smooth. <br>  Add vinegar and blend. <br>  While soup is still boiling, add flour mixture and remaining blood (or prune juice if no blood was used). Stir constantly. <br>  If a thicker soup is desired, add 1 c of pureed prunes. <br>  Boil another 5-10 minutes. Meat may be returned to the soup. <br>  Taste and adjust seasoning. <br>  Allow to cool and place in refrigerator. <br>  Allow soup to stand overnight before serving. Because of the raisins, prunes and fruit, the soup will be sweeter the next day. <br>  Retrieved from "http://cunnan.sca.org.au/wiki/Blood_sou...|`|QBFbvO21aa	the slight taste isn't bad, but if u drink a glass full of random blood it will make u sick and it's a little weird lol. <br>  you can love vampires all u want, but maybe stick with eating rare steak lulz. ;]|`|dvvQQ6eRaa	Get some help.

lDipkxcTaa	Well I would look for sarsaparilla for different kinds of root beer and here is some info about root beer also that i looked up<br>  <br>  Root beer is a beverage made from a variety of plant roots and spices. Recipes for root beer abound, so different commercially sold brands or homemade versions may differ widely in taste. Root beer is typically non-alcoholic, though alcoholic versions were more common in the past, before the prohibition era. Sassafras root is usually the main flavoring of root beer, which takes its name from this ingredient. Imitation sassafras is most commonly used today, as natural sassafras is mildly carcinogenic.<br>  <br>  Root beer, also known as sarsaparilla, is a carbonated beverage originally brewed using sassafras. Root beer, popularized in North America, comes in two forms: alcoholic and soft drink. The historical root beer was analagous to small beer, in that the process provided a beverage with a very low alcohol content.|`|szJzZ9myaa	Ask the mexican to translate for you.|`|kpvsxlA6aa	Sounds like a job for google.  Try "root beer" and the language, such <br>  as  " "root beer" Spanish " .|`|3paA4nocaa	Mug Root Beer is a brand name of root beer made by the Pepsi company.<br>  <br>  Mug was first produced by the Belfast Beverage Company in San Francisco, California during the early 1950s. Its name was changed to Mug Old Fashioned Root Beer. In the late 1960s, Sugar Free Mug (now Diet Mug Root Beer) was introduced. Mug Cream Soda (and Diet Mug Cream Soda) was later introduced, but it is not as widely available. Mug was purchased by Pepsi in 1986.
b9uOax0aaa	Love it.  The older and stinkier the better.|`|nDOWKhwCaa	I like it. I don't eat it plain, but a small slice really goes a long way on a grilled cheese sandwich or on top of my burger.|`|mzk0t6Ovaa	One of the greatest foods on the planet.  Our two local cheese<br>  purveyors stock somewhere between 1000-1200 varieties, but the<br>  only problem is that there's no real "cheese maker" to manage the<br>  affinage.  Consequently, cheeses that need aging sometime get<br>  abused and go a little bit off.<br>  <br>  Favorite cheeses these days are Boscheto di Tartufo, Pecorino<br>  Toscano, and Scamorza.  They make a deadly combination for<br>  pizzas.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Hello Houston.  Fort Worth here.  I love grilled cheese sammies.

You can Just plain cheese with it, or you can have a tomato sauce with the cheese and chicken. A lot of people have cheese and chicken together.|`|8LXmBXYEaa	my favorite is chicken with Alfredo sauce, its not really cheese, but you use milk and parmasean &romano cheeses to make it.
