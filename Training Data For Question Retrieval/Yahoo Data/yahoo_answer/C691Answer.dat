jVaY4sEVaa	it depends on how you feel about your boyfriend. if you really care about him, i think you should wait for him.|`|kyTBaYFlaa	go for it cuz he going to or he wouldn't have said you could|`|UrGCq6RVaa	If he is giving you the ok to see other people, more than likely he is wanting to do the same thing. A guy that wants you and only you would never "give permission" for you to see others.<br>  You might want to re-evaluate your relationship. Also, think about where he will be for the next two months and if you think your relationship can weather the distance!|`|AdIrjmV7aa	He left and he will date others.  He has asked you to do the same because he is not committed to you.|`|aaMzy3bTaa	if you still love him you will wait for him .if you not date another one|`|izBsVtXJaa	well your choice it is better that you don't bu tif you wanna date :)

fMEypXDYaa	Don't jump back into that frying pay girl, tell him he can see the son, but if father is coming back, why leave yourself open to the same old sh*t you just got away from? The boys father needs to decide which way he wants to go in this matter, and if he decides to take you, then it should just be the three of you, not the four of you. Stick to your guns on this matter, it is really important that you keep your life on track about this.|`|vn2Lq7hIaa	Why are you living with the father, or why is he living with you? You don't get along anyway so why can't there just be you, your bf, and now the baby? That sounds more like a normal family, don't you think.<br>  <br>  As a condition of getting back together "Dad has to get his own place", you must make that clear to your boyfriend, and have him agree to it. If he doesn't agree, let him live with his father, you stay where you are or pack your bags and hop the first train headed away from Dad and son.<br>  <br>  Good Luck - God Bless|`|3orAFoiXaa	well if it was only about his dad...maybe you should give him another chance you never fought about anything else..you left him right? i think you should give him another chance give your baby chance to know his dad my neice and nephew live with me and there dad is not even there for them the poor kids have nothing but me and my mom and there not even our kids and its sad i think you should give him a change good luck to you|`|nmejm9Nmaa	Simply tell him, he can either have you guys there, or alone with his father. It's not good to raise a child under those circumstances. Hopefully his father will be able to find shelter elsewere. Good luck.
Un5u1OCFaa	my mom is also a dick alot of the time and i used to be really angry and argue with her all the time and i wished she could just die some of the time, but i realised i loved her so much and despite all the nasty stuff she does i will miss her when she dies or if i die first she will miss me, so i make the most of the time we have together!!! i realised my mom is a dick alot coz she had a hard life too, so it is a little hard for her to deal with the pain she still feels so she lets it out the only way she knows how! ur mom loves you alot but try to find out if she has had a hard life and you may be able to forgive her easily! and understand how she feels. also , i advise you move out, that way you clash less and you miss her more so then you grow clser together coz you appreciate something more when it's gone! i was clashing with my mom everyday so she sent me on holiday for 3 months to liverpool now i have been back for 1 and a half months and we have not clahsed yet, am so pleased! good luck!|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Teach your mom a lesson.

This seems a bit awkward. does your dad notice this at all?  I suggest you watch them some night when he's laying with your mom, or sit outside the room or something. Do they leave the door open or close it? If they close it just listen into the room. If something sexual is going on, notify your dad, and maybe do what you can to get your foster "sibling" out of the house..|`|a9pWpLfraa	About as normal as a goat plucking his *** hair.

They sound like lovers to me.|`|026463f641c91751757ddeacfc3bac71aa	not normal but i'm not sure what you can do about it.  you might try talking to your mom and impressing on her this could hurt your family.  good luck.
Kleijp4naa	yessss you have to be able to have fun and tease her, and dont be creepy sweet!!!! Be super funny to balance it out, and also have soem talents|`|J9iWzQrkaa	yes! Sometimes guys take it overboard, like the other comment, just be geniune with what you say. Compliments are so easy to see through. <br>  Also! some of my friends often agree that when it comes to really pretty girls where there is alot of competetion, they are used to all the phoney, sweet pick up lines or compliments! I have a friend is absolutly gorgeous and is completly sick of every guy, looking for someone who is not afraid to be themselves, and rude- when appropiate. Having the perfect balance is key!<br>  Hope that helps:)|`|zka26204aa	Only if you are not being genuine.  Girls do not like guys that fall at their feet all of the time.  They want the guy to be confident and have his own opinions, but to be willing to compromise or at least consider their opinions too.  They should also be kind, and considerate as well.  It can't be phony, however.  Most girls can see through all of that.<br>  <br>  Men that are push overs only make themselves look desperate.

Of course, this is a very serious expression of human nature and it lies at the very foundation of our lives. <br>  <br>  It is nature’s work within us that makes these things the most important. First of all, without sex  there would be no continuation of life, whereas nature aspires to continue and develop. Secondly, without sex people would lose a powerful incentive to communicate with one another. A huge superstructure in the form of the human society is based only on this phenomenon, on this inner aspiration,not to mention family and children. Sex determines the entire structure of the universe and the relationship between the sexes. Yet this is not just the relation between sexes; this is also the source of the ultimate pleasure in our world<br>  <br>  However in this world ( our world ) our nature constitutes a desire to receive pleasure. We make love, receive some momentary pleasure and then there is a huge gap, renewal of desire, the need to look for a partner and so on. Then again you feel pleasure for a few seconds and it passes and everything starts all over again. This is when it becomes harmful because we are only using the other person for our own selfish satisfaction. Not to mention that in most cases, the sexual attraction  we feel towards another person is  governed by our hormones therefore temporary.<br>  <br>  Sex  is the ultimate pleasure in this world, and the root of all of our desires in this world. Here's why we are so pre occupied by it.<a href="http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/life-love-family/kabbalah-relationships?p_options=2#why-are-we-so-preoccupied-with-sex-3f" rel="nofollow">http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/life-lov...</a>|`|XPPGphLbaa	One reason is that the entire Bible verse is skewed.  Remember that King James had the entire Bible translated  - and the monks could've mistranslated anything in it. That  Jesus would think that men - or women -would not lust in their hearts is against what God put in us in the first place: the instinct to recreate.  Multiply and fill the earth.  Never mind about the lust stuff - it is our actions that define who we are, not our thoughts|`|Hfp80ylEaa	Yes, but not everyone is religious.<br>  <br>  For those who are they can ask for and gain forgiveness.  Since you clearly are faithful, it is "normal" to lust because of being sinful beings.  Try as one might to live according to the Bible, no one will come even close.|`|WUwIk3Fgaa	how can anyone control what they think or not be attracted to someone, if they are. It's only when you act on these thoughts and desires that you are in the wrong. Just my opinion.|`|ckUBvd2kaa	Lust is  natural whether it is sexual in nature or not.I am in the playpen with Mildred|`|1HYPnwweaa	All religions have grains in heaps of chaff.

If that is what you believe.<br>  <br>  If you do not believe in the bible than that would be a false statement.|`|fMEypXDYaa	Next time you make love to your man, remember how you lusted for him before you got him into bed with you. Lust is a form of desire and we all are designed to lust for the other sex, it is called procreation of the species, each person is seeking the one that they feel is the perfect mate for them, it is normal to look at the other sex and desire them if they are sexually attractive, it is how we meet each other for relationships and marriage. Some people read more into a bible than they should have, after all we were given 'Free Will" for a reason.<br>  Thinking about a person sexually is not lust, just a way to think about how your going to meet them because you are drawn to them.|`|uXOhQidGaa	It's completely human to have lustful thoughts, and you can't control every thought you have. Thus the Bible's prohibition on the very same "lustful thoughts" that the Bible's God allegedly gave every healthy adult human is nothing more than a scheme to turn every normal healthy adult into a sinner requiring the Bible God's Salvation. And since the Bible God doesn't talk to anyone except through his priests, it is a cynical confidence game desgigned to trick normal healthy adults into the psychological control of said priests.|`|d665c8adfe92a87bcbce06e12996f077aa	Unless you are born again as it says in John 3:3, you will never understand biblical talk. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jesus-is-savior.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.jesus-is-savior.com</a>|`|ml2FDYECaa	Human nature takes control over you mind...one that you cannot control. Biblicly cheating on your wife with another M/W would be wrong, and hurtful. "Thoughts, are just thoughts."|`|AA11678629	it's a natural thing to lust. but the bible does say that it is wrong

AA10831821	It depends on the camp.  I'm sure it happens sometimes, but if your friend tends to exaggerate, it is most likely a lie.
0LqslIMLaa	I find that usually the best two ways to heal this is either reconcile with her, but don't stay friends, make amends then leave one another to your lives. But sometimes that may not be what she's willing to do. So if you can't get that, then try to date others, and when remembering her, talk well of her and speak of the good things, don't remember the bad things, soon you'll forget about the bad and you wont feel so painful, its a slow process, but even if she is the Devil on earth, thinking well of her will make you feel better.|`|AcIv8SeXaa	how bizarre|`|771702cc138b8e49b58a97fac0fcaa49aa	Eventually you will get over her.  One day you will realize hey I didnt think about her at all yesterday then soon it will be a week a month 6 months and so on.  Dont worry about what she does the 2 of you wont be getting back together and constantly worrying about how she is dealing with it will just hold you back.  Just live your life go out with friends have fun whatever.

If there are no problems in your marriage then let it go.|`|euQFQzc5aa	Sorry bro.<br>  <br>  I'd get a hotel room for a few nights so that I had a place to think.

If she thought it was the "harmless" variety, I'd just limit time with the friend.  Otherwise, I'd get us into counseling and ditch the friend (marriage comes first).<br>  <br>  Then I'd grill her on her motive for saying it.  Threesome would be out of the question.  If she just said that to make me jealous or get a reaction, basically anything other than she really *did* have a crush on him, I'd blow up at her for manipulating me.|`|PD1fZV7Aaa	Apparently a lot of people here on answers believe it is perfectly normal to Lust after and crush on others. I for one DO NOT agree. I feel it is Betrayal of Wedding Vows. I understand a sudden thought of, "WOW that person looks good."

That is how it was with my last bf I was with for 7 months. Not attractive, but he made me smile. I get it. Just natural. Are your parents not attentive to you? Maybe that could be why; a lack of attention somewhere else.|`|USzwsA0Waa	you like the attention, its flattering and adorable like a puppy. it makes you feel good about yourself. its not a bad thing though, i mean yes its kind of mean but your not evil|`|80piiicYaa	i think u like him but u let other people's opinions get in the way.... ur gonna make him the happiest person on earth if u say yes. and he is gonna treat u the way u should b treated|`|65jyxyz4aa	maybe because u guys r such good friends that u cant help but to smile when he texts u. ur conversations are probably so good that when he texts u, u feel like u gonna have a good time texting.|`|A1rfDaANaa	cuz u lyk him for his persinallity but yu turn him down cuz of his looks dont let looks decive you|`|K8wDgNwbaa	maybe your really a lesbian and he has a girly personallity|`|qM35nXVsaa	time 4 bed for all of us eh <br>  <br>  <br>  from canada|`|13efe42c1b43aea736580b4a5176e231aa	duh cuz you like him. Give him a chance.  why are you turning him down other than the physical?  since your only in 9th grade you haven't made it to the point where you look at a person for more than their physical attributes.  The cute ones are ususally dogs anyways, especially in highschool. And this one is obviously into you cuz he been wanting you for 3 years. Please give him a chance.|`|ws7Et1jpaa	Because maybe deep down you know that it isn't being attracted to the body that matters, that will grow old and die. Maybe there is something much deeper that you are falling in love with.....But be careful love in our time and age is tricky....I mean you think you love someone just to find out that it was just a stupid crush that messed you all up.
gGAbkkeVaa	or maybe the nice guys don'tt have the courage to ask the right girl out so she'll date a jerk and then that's all she will ever know.|`|3IimJWgXaa	haha awwe you poor guy... <br>  <br>  i just think the jerks are better at being rejected so they go for it more ya know? and the nicer guys are harder to read as well, and believe it or not yep girls are scared if a guy likes them. So just keep the faith and youll find a great girl, i have faith haha(:<br>  <br>  also, <br>  my ex? he thinks he's a honestly great great guy, and he's a total jerk. aggressive and snappy. He wouldnt wanna talk or listen to me even. Before we dated tho, he was this perfect guy(: then... became a jerk. So its also that too.. guys fool the girls but they guys friends know the truth. I have a guy friend that is a GREAT guy, but his roommate is a douche, and his roommate gets the girls, but i know girls that know him, and hes just a total believable charmer. He isnt nasty or skanky or anything at all. their just sly... lol
16KUkMP0aa	Tell her you need your space. You can't help it if you're being a "bad friend", even though you actually aren't.
LHzlvfRQaa	It means that you are wanting to be around girls who can be friends or girlfriends. If you see a girl that you like, or would like to be friends with just go up to her and talk to her, be polite, respectful, and considerate. Just say hi! I really like your haircut, who's your hairdresser. Or just ask questions that start with how, when, why, where, who. Ask questions about things that girls are interested in such as hobbies, clothes,books,CD's,music,concerts,food,m... etc.<br>  Ask if they know of any good movies that are on at the moment, and if they name one, say I was going to see that movie, why don't we go together.<br>  Also if you are speaking to a girl and you both share the same interest in a hobby, or activity, then suggest that you both go together, for example, walking, running, cycling, sightseeing, sport.<br>  In my opinion, the dream symbolizes that in reality, you are going to meet the girl of your dreams.
Jn09Cruqaa	He likes you.. Simple... Can't you see it?|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Calls with nothing to say are boring, pointless, and expensive.|`|Exv4AjqCaa	Just so he can talk to you, he probably enjoys your company & opinion on things even in very normal situations.<br>  <br>  Ie he likes you.|`|uZDFVXF3aa	I know a couple who were dating casually who would spend an hour every Saturday night watching Sonny and Cher (really dating the lot of us, aren't I?).  They hardly said a word to each other, other than to comment on the show, and when it was over they said goodbye and hung up.  Not much communication going on but they both enjoyed it.  Sometimes a person just enjoys knowing the other is on the other end of the line for a little while.|`|BI1Ma4vVaa	He likes you and just wants an excuse to talk to you..... Even if that means he really has nothing to say. Ask him out if you like him, if not let him know he's only a friend.|`|0fcwsv7Vaa	He wants to talk to you. Ive called a girl and made up a reason to call her.|`|NIYYN6tpaa	Your lucky...This chick i know like to call me and say nothing just sit there in silence....She says she likes knowing I'm there even tho we aren't saying a thing|`|IpWTMetHaa	Some boys just aren't good with the phone thing - but enjoy sitting on the other end of the line with the girl they like, just to hear her breathe.  That is what the boyz in my past have told me, so I pass it on.|`|cOBk3NxQaa	He likes you and enjoys your company, your presence. consider the movie-watching a "mini-date" lol jk. but i'm quite sure he's into you|`|pRDdtpVIaa	You like him be honest. Just make him talk and stop being so shy. This is what usually happens when two shy people start talking. They usually got nothing to say : ).<br>  <br>  It's normal|`|Wtr1jyAAaa	He either really likes you or he is jelous and wants to know if your with another guy if you enjoy why dose it matter!|`|AIgeMHYraa	simple hes into you but he probably wants you to tell him first or he shy about telling you|`|oLwj5cbWaa	can it be more obvious he likes you! ask him why he does that?|`|5v0jWelOaa	he likes u stupid

Try and see if he is paying attention to you first. <br>  <br>  I just  remember when a girl asked me out and I said sure only not to show up on our date. Sometimes you cant ask any guy out. You must always make sure he is interested in you. So don't be like that poor girl. Good luck|`|0LqslIMLaa	Guys generally have to do the asking. Most guys will be impressed if you ask them, its nice not having to ask. Just go up to him, pay him a compliment. Tell him he looks cute or strong or something that will make him feel good, then just ask him if he wants to go out on a date some time.|`|RDWSc5jraa	OKAY are you sure that he is interested?  if so make a sign that says "Will you go to ____ with me" and during one of his practices or games watch him and show the sign!|`|ZJB24VtRaa	Ask him to go to a movie or to just hang out on the weekend. If he really likes you he will make time for you. Be straight and honest and it will work itself out. Good luck|`|cuGYuz1Oaa	Ask him for a morning jog but dnt pretend to be all atheletic if your not. Thats not a good thing. And be straight forward, guys dont like to guess they just want to know|`|Jn09Cruqaa	Try to find out what he likes to do... You can start trying a Movies...|`|5mFXSgZfaa	ask him to go on a jog  with you or something
fHrYRXXFaa	hey dude forget those people who dont have time 4......, and go ahead.,<br>  i think u dont have passions....,<br>  give proper time to ur studies coz ur future depends on ur kind of studies|`|L7hPYBgVaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Never under estimate yourself. My personal suggestion is do not spoil your studies because of this distraction.<br>  Cool n' just don bother unless someone in your friends list mean much to u.<br>  This is one way, or else the alternate is there's nothing wrong in initiating the chat in order to improve your networking.<br>  Take care..|`|euQFQzc5aa	I have no ******* clue what you are talking about.|`|adbc05b25fb5ee9cfa0f48d2028a46e6aa	The way things are now days is that people only want to give their opinion or attempt to answer questions they have no information about or very little.  Some of them just want to be smart A--'s and anger you or indicate some smart mouth remark.  They don't want to get involved with people on the personal level anymore.  They call that cyber love or hate however you want to look at it.  They may only want to vent their frustrations of daily life and don't care who they take it out on just so long as they are right for a change.  Now: I ask you, is that the kind of person you really want to get involved with?  Personal contact is the only kind of friendship, that way you will know if it's real.  People only want to hide their true feelings behind typed words.  I say some people; but, not all, you need someone to communicate with there are several meaning individuals out there.  You just have to be careful which ones you ask questions of..  The truth even when it hurts is the only true friend and communication companion..
DwiQ66qyaa	hey<br>  <br>  first of, thanks for answering my questions:)<br>  <br>  Now, how can you spend enough time with both? This is kinda tricky, but it can work if you're careful. Make sure whenever you do guy things with your friend, for example go to the gym with him. And do romantic things with his sister like going to the moives, park, and so on. And you can have common hang out times too where they can both come. Just make sure you give each one lots of respect and show that you're concerned. The rest will kind of follow. Situations will make you realize when its appropriate to be with whom. Also text his sister, talk online, if you can't hang in person with her on certain days and have to be with your friend. Or vice versa. This will keep them both happy.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped.<br>  <br>  Gluck :)|`|gH5FPXURaa	i am in a simialr situation....u have to do things you guys can all do together...so u get both
a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Sure. Every day is a new start.|`|vimfbSxfaa	like every sec.<br>  <br>  edit: oh yeah only if you dont regreat anything you ever done and just live a good life|`|fOHn1ISdaa	When I first had sex....that was my fresh start
rg6YMULsaa	dont text her.. it would make u seem desperate.. <br>  when you called her did u leave a voicemessage? cuz u should leave a voice message and see if she responds to it<br>  <br>  if she does, yay!<br>  <br>  if she doesnt, boo..|`|vaZ2qMQ7aa	I don't think it's hopeless.  It's entirely possible that she is just really busy.<br>  <br>  You just have to remain persistent.  If she keeps giving excuses, you'll be frustrated as hell, but keep with it, and eventually she'll run out.  Then you'll get coffee, and both you and her will start to find out if you really do like each other.|`|0LqslIMLaa	Okay, never call someone that late unless they say its alright, and even then try not to unless your dating, it makes you seem desperate.<br>  <br>  Wait two days, if she doesn't call, call her, if she answers, ask her out or whatever. If she doesn't answer, leave her a message, say "call me when you get the time." then do not bother her anymore. If she doesn't call in a day or so she's probably not interested. If she does, then go back to asking her out.
9c27503b79201fde467bfe0f1ef26915aa	I had my first kiss at 21 because I had my first boyfriend at 21. I too am saving sex for marriage, and you should kiss only when you think it's right. So.. don't stress. I feel kissing is fine any time, before or after marriage. As long as you're comfortable with it, and as long as you feel the man you're with is worth sharing that experience with.|`|p4Ss7TsIaa	i'm only 17, but i've never been kissed and i've had two boyfriends...<br>  <br>  don't worry about it.|`|gGAbkkeVaa	i was 20 before some guy got my first kiss|`|8k0TDiO2aa	I'm only fifteen and I know your probably thinking why is a fifteen yr old giving me advice but ive had my fair share of chances of being kissed and even having sex but I was smart enough and said no... Your thing is the religon issue<br>  I think it is awesome that your actually saying no because it just shows that you really care and respect your parents and yourself and you don't let guys trick you into all there lies and deceit I don't think your a loser at all your just not easy like all the other girls that would do anything a man asked her to at the drop of a hat... So i admire you for that|`|A1rfDaANaa	i was stuck with the same question yo you dont have to have sex but yo kiss a dude kissings nothing you kiss ur mom and dad dont you?<br>  kissing is not really sexual it can become sexual if you let it but you dont have to have sex but damn kiss is not against ur religion to kiss because im sure everyone kisses before they get married so juss kiss and ur 19 be urself do what you want ur a big grl dnt be worrying about what ur parents will think|`|fVv1NpKwaa	Look I'm a christian and some ppl tell me that this ways wrong and this way isn't but truthfully you need to make your own decision. If you don't think you should than don't if your sure you can restrain yourself from further going than you know do what you think is right but I don't really think its a big deal..I just think you have to set standards and make your own choice..Stay classy and just think about it some more..theres no rush  ;)
AA10628838	It isn't evil. It just means you received the love, care, and nurturing that your mom didn't give you from your dad and grandmother. You can't really miss it if you have never known it.|`|Bx7F9jscaa	there's nothing wrong with that. My family is exactly the same way, only it's my dad that left, and honestly, I don't really care.|`|TnIsuYqYaa	Yep,i feel exactly the same way about my ex-wife.Out of site,out of mind.No denial required.|`|XX9pFFCZaa	i agree, you cant miss what you never had..|`|CkIeCNS4aa	My dad died when I was 18, but had been sick since I can remember, so he was never really "there for me".  My best friend lived with her dad and grandma after her mom left when she was little.  Both of us turned out completely normal, despite the fact that our families were not "typical".  It's rough dealing with a family member who wasn't there when you needed them, but the fact that you got through it is evidence that you are okay.  Sometimes it really is for the best and being able to admit that just shows how well your family raised you.|`|YoNMn90Maa	I don't think that's weird.

Or wrong.  But... I think with time you will miss her more.  Sure, grandmama is better, she's been there for you.  Your dad too.  Your brothers too.  And no matter if she came back or not, she wouldn't replace them in the least.  It might be a denial type of stage.  Not sure.  But with time I think you will miss her.  I hope that makes sense.
Tw79BIbjaa	I spent two years obsessed with two different girls. I met a girl at work and talked to her about these two girls. As I was about to ask one of the two girls out, I didn't because I realized I was in love with the girl from work.<br>  <br>  Now that girl from work cheated on me after three years of dating so I'm not sure that really answers your question.

However, I can't place the blame on the nature of girls. That's silly. It's ultimately your fault if you keep getting girls like this. You are looking in the wrong areas when you pick up women. Try the bookstore, library, or someplace intellectual if you want that type of girl. Coffee shops are gold. Quit with the bars and clubs crap.

Obviously in the dating phase of the relationship you're going to want to feel this person out, make sure he's the kind of person that is open minded enough to explore with you.<br>  <br>  BDSM is based first and foremost on trust. Going to web sites to find a BDSM partner will definitely get you someone who is eager to participate in BDSM with you, but is that someone you will be able to trust?<br>  <br>  Be patient, find a mate, explore together.

pn9q0JkXaa	First, you need to cut him out of your life, atleast for now while you try to get over him. Try getting a new hobby, something that will take your mind off of him. Do something nice for yourself, go out with your friends, just work on yourself. It will boost your confidence and help you get over him sooner!|`|6tn8DJajaa	fake it till u make it.....this old addage actually works....<br>  <br>  start acting like u are over him, especially around him  or when u talk to him....<br>  <br>  dont show him how u feel, if u arent happy, pretend to be... get out and have some fun, get a new haircut, go tanning, something to improve yourself.... the best way to get over an ex, or to get one back for that matter, is to cut off contact with them.... i truly believe this.. having done it a few times...if u think u can remain friends, but keep your distance, then try that.... tell him that u are ok with you two breaking up, and that u are going to move on with your life... this isnt selfish, he broke up with you, and its not fair of him to keep doing this when he knows u still like him...<br>  <br>  let him find out what life is like without you for a while... see if that is what he prefers|`|s564PQUHaa	have sex with him. maybe|`|izBsVtXJaa	just foreget it !|`|lISrOzyraa	ignore him and change your number, and don't ever fight for someone that does not want you.

TPZZESeeaa	yes, just keep doing what you are doing and if he feels the same you will end up together.|`|angW1Lkfaa	Be friendly be surprised what eye contact can do. Relax and enjoy the chase, you will meet many men and really get to know them before you commit to anything.  Guys want sex as often as the change socks. Find one that also considers your needs. You read this section abuse after abuse and they stay because they say they love him. The only thing that's wrong is your inner being trying to tell you something, Believe me listen to it. I love blue eyes. flirting is fun   but I'm old enough to be your grandpa but I do want you to be safe and have fun. The only time you give your heart away is when they earn it.

If a guy wants to be with you then everything will fall in to place if it doesn't work out it doesn't matter. There are more guys and you are young :). You don't need a relationship to be happy, flings are cool too. You'll know if he's "the one", but you don't even need that yet<br>  <br>  *Good Luck*
pOTigVYPaa	Every person needs some time alone or off with friends.  Doesn't mean you don't love your spouse.  My husband plays poker with his buddies occasionally, or goes out to breakfast on Sunday with his best guy friends.  I go out to lunch and shopping with my best friend, and sometimes I'll go to see a movie alone.  We all need time alone or with friends apart from our spouses.  It's good for the soul.|`|40ed361ed7df354988fb96506fac28e3aa	life does  get to be  perfunctory at  times,  people  get itchy feet and then start to wonder about   getting away, separations and  holidays  alone.. if  trust isn't an issue then why not  do things  that add an extra dimension to ones lives.. in the  end it might save on  lawyer bills  when the   divorce  comes  through.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	I would not tell him you are tired of seeing him every day.  Instead you might plan a trip with your sisters or friends without your husband for a few days.  Hopefully you will miss him while you are apart and feel better when you see him again.  If not, your marriage may be in trouble.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	No, why would you  marry someone that you will eventually get bored with? <br>  I would be happy if I could spend every second with my husband, I hate it when he is gone. I have fun with him, he is my best friend. <br>  People who feel bored with their spouse, married the wrong person.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	the only thing i get bored of is what we do in the bedroom, so we find way s to spice it up liek dressing up or doing it in odd places.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	Nope, never.

I cook, clean, laundry. It is stuff that has to get done,  everyone does it. Say you were with someone else, you have to do the same thing. Looks like your not bored with him, but with the routine you have going. <br>  <br>  Spice it up, have him cook dinner one night (instead of you), if he doesn't know how print him an online recipe to follow.  Instead of watching TV go out for a walk or jog together, around the block to the beach etc.<br>  <br>  You also need time alone from each other, find a hobby, or get a exercise routine for yourself outdoors, while he is doing something else. <br>  <br>  Go out with friends for a whole day if possible, you need to miss him and have the feeling of want again. Go out,  by the end of the day you should be happy to come home to him. :)|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Sometimes, but at the end of every month, the restaurant my husband works for does these big dinner parties and he's got to put in 12-14 hour days - so I get the house to myself quite a bit - sometimes as many as 3 nights in one week and it helps.  I love my alone time and I need it.  Also, he works every Saturday and I'm off so I love that, too.  It gives me time to reflect and recharge.<br>  <br>  Everybody gets bored from everybody every now and then - it's not big deal, it often just means you need time for yourself.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Take separate vacations this summer and you will come back refreshed.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	No.  I used to but I then realized that it goes both ways.

EgzoiW4raa	You, my dear, are in a tough position.  You have set very difficult standards for yourself and now are questioning how your beliefs and expectations, that were established in order for you to be happy; really play into your future happiness.  "What do I do" is consistently running though your head.<br>  <br>  Funny thing is that the added pressure isn't helping is it? :)<br>  <br>  First off, take a breath.  No, I mean it. Right now. You are frustrated and confused. You did'nt want to sacrifice your morals , but you feel as if you have unrealistic expectation. (Did you take a breath..Im going to help u)<br>  <br>  First of all you are entitled to want whatever it is you want in a man. So it is OK to want them to be a virgin, 2 times in, whatever the case may be.<br>  <br>  The problem that arises inst from your values, its how these values are making you feel. <br>  <br>  I know you'd like a "fix it  answer.  But the real answers have to come from you.<br>  <br>  1. What is more important to you? They way a man feels about you, or the umber of sexual partners he has had?<br>  <br>  2. Why is that important to you?<br>  <br>  3. how do you REALLY know for sure if you are being told the truth about past partners anyway?<br>  <br>  It has been my experience that people (especially virgins) put a LOT of weight on their "First time". That's OK. Just make sure you know "why" you want the things that are important to you in a man.<br>  <br>  It is my opinion that you associate a guy with "too much" experience as a bad guy. Either someone that cannot be trusted, has low values, whatever the case may be. Why is it a turn-off that a guy can have experience?<br>  <br>  Find the answer to that. <br>  <br>  You deserve the best. But is the "best" only defined as a number of Sexual encounters?<br>  <br>  What if you met a guy thas was PERFECT.  Everything you EVER wanted.  Take a moment to visualize him.<br>  <br>  He's GREAT! You are incredibly happy! You want to cherish and love him forever...only one problem. He (for some reason unbenounced to you) doesn't want to be with a girl with your color eyes.  <br>  <br>  "What?!?!, That's stupid!" Seems like it.  How can someone be wonderful and perfect but because I don't fit one aspect oftheirr "wants" He's going to throw this away?<br>  <br>  Take some time to think about what you really want in a guy.  If its the morals and values that you need in someone that can only be found in a virgin. Than wait it out. Go to Church. He's out there.<br>  <br>  I think you should dig a bit deeper into yourself and find out "why?" you think the way you do.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  Dr. Chambers|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	What gives you the right to ask other people about their sexual experiences?  It's funny that you want your beliefs respected, but you are judging others for theirs.  Maybe there are people that don't want a virgin because of their lack of experience?   You should find another virgin, that way the victim you choose won't have to worry if you get some hangup later down the road.|`|75cz9e5Kaa	I know you shouldn't change your beliefs for a man, but I think that maybe all the men you have met just haven't been right<br>  <br>  I mean, if a really amazing guy came along who had had sex a few more times, I'm sure you'd be willing to look past it, but only if you believed he was right for you..<br>  Makes sense to me, but I don't know about you..<br>  <br>  Hope I helped a little bit..|`|ik9hP6FBaa	there are guys out there that have had one one sexual partner, and if you cant find one, i say just get rid of your checklist and try to forget about their past. its you and his future together, the past shouldn't effect what you and the guy have. if you truly like him enough to forget about his past, you would be a great girlfriend! just try it, and dont make it awkward because of their past. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :D <3<br>  Cindy|`|nZgZWrGWaa	Urhhhg...<br>  1-GET OVER IT!!!!!....<br>  2-find a virgin.<br>  3-grow up and realize that people are having sex, its normal....<br>  4-be alone till u find ur Mr. Perfect (if u ever do)<br>  <br>  I just cannot stan this type of question, why ask if u already gave urself an answer???|`|IAKbseRMaa	Just go for wwhat you believe...

You are being to hard on that requirement it might not be acceptable to you because you are a virgin but you have to realize that most people at that age are not. You have to lax a little on that because you won't find a relationship ever if you don't get past it. Just because he has had sex more than 3 times or more than 2 partners doesn't mean he'll cheat on you if he's with you. If he's a good guy he will respect you for wanting to wait and not cheat on you. Hope that helps. Good luck.|`|0yaQQSwoaa	20 yr old V huh, I've seen plenty of your kind, nothing special. as for your Little guy problem, just relax and date or like who ever. doesn't matter how many women they've been with, but of course you want to give it away to the right person so choose wisely; someone who you know has a plan in life and you could see yourself with, don't worry people use condoms now and days and as for the sex part its almost logical, I'm pretty sure a V and a Non-V know how to do "it". so it kinda doesn't make a difference. just dont pick a man whore.|`|EJWphb88aa	you again ....<br>  <br>  well my answer is the same<br>  <br>  Dont be so rigid in ur thoughts.. no one is perfect babes.. you just need to feel the spark with ur partner.. but i don think you will feel it if you have closed all ur doors of ur heart and binded with restrictions... <br>  <br>  be little flexible.. u never know u meet the prefect guy in ur life.. but u dont opt for him coz he is not fitting ur screening rules.. being choosy is good... but being an extremist in the same isnt healthy..|`|EZHZW7QFaa	Why do you need to know a guy's sexual past?

Even if a guy has only been with 1 girl they definately did it more than 3 times...sorry hunny - your being VERY unrealistic i REALLY think you need to experience sex b/c at this rate you will be single forever.... BTW do you have a jealousy or ego problem???|`|UpRdvpmXaa	I'm 25 and am also a virgin. I'm engaged to my fiance, who is also 25 and a virgin. Prior to meeting each other we both made our mistakes in previous relationships and dated others who were experienced, which really bothered her wiith previous men but myself not very much. I understand that many don't share the same views as we do but what's important is that you stick to your beliefs which I'm really proud that you have because that someone will come around. <br>  When dating other women that were experienced, I do feel that it bothered me somewhat but I thought to myself...I can't judge them and they were great people. You have to think about what you want...if you come across a really great guy that you fall in love with but he's had a bit more experience then you would like, weigh the situation...you have the right to your decision. If his history really bothers you that you can't look past it, you may be hurting yourself slightly (if love is involved). What if he's resentful of those past situations and really wants to change for you, give him a chance. <br>  <br>  I really think you should keep to your beliefs, which are great. You're still young (I know we hate hearing things like that but I mean there is time). Someone is going to come around that meets everything you've ever wanted in a guy. It won't happen right when you want it but you'll meet a guy who hasn't had much experience and you see if he's the one for you. There is someone out there waiting for you (many in fact)...trust me...you just have to wait until they fall in your path or you fall in theirs. <br>  <br>  Faith and I met each other while dating others. We broke those off to be together and later realized after having a serious discussion that we were both waiting until marriage, which isn't to far away now (after 6 years of dating)...thank God :0)|`|ZzjUHawhaa	In society today some of the things on your list is unrealistic. I am not saying that you won't meet a guy with the standards you have made but it will be very hard to find someone like that. These days guys start having sex in their preteens. As you get older it will be harder to find a man that fits ur criteria. Maybe you should stop looking and let that dream man of yours find you. if you give it time he will come. U will meet him one day.|`|hcoQ8j7aaa	I recommend finding someone in your church that has similar strict  guidelines.  There are ways to find other virgins and I think that is really what you want.  Are you waiting for marriage?  Find some else who is too.  Otherwise you are going to end up with some one willing to lie to you to get to date you and that's not a good way to start.<br>  <br>  It may be easy to blame someone for their past but it may be better to go on what they are doing currently and how they treat you.  Just a thought.  You can find groups of people looking for the same thing you are in your community.  Be careful online!|`|TQLWJEKyaa	u probally are looking for a virgin relax a lot of guys are not as experienced as u think they just say they are don't worry about a persons past specially if you plan on being there present.|`|8YD4b0bzaa	I think u should continue what ur doing.

Personally, I like girls that dont sleep around.|`|NidCYkGpaa	BE GAY THEN CUZ UR ASKIN FIR TOO MUCH|`|7GsYFjHRaa	This is a hard ? to anser but maybe lower ur checklist a little, or look for  a hot virgin dude which will probably be really hard to find since guys r horny ppl, but try ur best. why do these guys have to have sex only 3 times, cause men who r single already probably had sex with his old girlfriend like 10 or more times. Ur weird, with weird standards but i know where ur comin frum. Try findin a guy that really likes u and is sensitive and passionate then maybe if he has been with more than 2 ppl and has had sex more than 3 times total, then u might be ok with doin him, or just bein with him. when ur ready ur ready, and guys sometimes can understand, but a lot dont. go for the passionate sensitive guy and maybe u will fall in love and chang ur standards for him if hes the perfect guy.

But what i have done is in a way just stop caring b/c if you have a chack list and some guy passess it but you dont pass his... well hunny you will just end up single.. im a cool looking guy, college, job, and a great attitued im prety shure your the same. alot of girls where after me as me whit them but when that came up i kindalost respect for them and left them alone. <br>  now what i do is i try to aviod that conversation and respect her past and "what we are doing is judging them" so i try to judge   them on there actions now not in the past. b/c we all regret somethings you know where just humans. what would the world be like whit out forgiveness|`|wBXYRbhhaa	Its nice to hear you are still a virgin and that's is something that we don't see now a days. <br>  Don't look for the perfect guy, just be yourself, don't stress out about past relationships of the guy because that would kill you. It doesn't matter how many partners he's had as long as he's honest. Obviously don't go for a guy who's been with a two digit number ... that's too much and if you fall in love and decide to lose your virginity with him, remember that you will be sleeping not only with him but with all the people he's been with. Use protection.<br>  Don't be scare and most important .. don't judge! There is plenty of good guys out there, just let their heart speak to you.|`|gCdP3NJGaa	What do you do? Accept you will be single for a very long time. If you were saying 'if he doesn't treat me like this, this and this then I won't date him' I could understand and agree with you. But to want to dictate impossible conditions occurring BEFORE he met you is frankly, ridiculous. You seem to be setting yourself up to fail to GET a relationship, nevermind failing at the relationship. <br>  Look long and deep at your reasons for doing this, possibly with a therapists help|`|08y217Rdaa	One day you will have that dirty history too.

I would say stay away from the party boys because they tend to have WAYYY more sexual partners.

But i mean they cant only do it 3 times.... it doesnt matter about how many times they have, its the partners they've had.<br>  <br>  I'd say with your next guy really try hard not to think about how expierenced he is ( if he is) Just think that if you guys get serious and you do have sex than he coould teach you everything you need to kno!

Your so worked up about someone meeting your expectations, that your life is revolved around it. If you think you've found "The One", who cares if they are 40 and have had 20 sexual partners?

So save yourself for the right person.|`|BL4PEjAWaa	short answer is that most guys lie about their sex lives anyway.  They think experience is a plus.  I knew some really active people in High School but out of 900 students I could call all by name and address that had sex on a weekly basis.  The reason the porn industry is doing so well is because guy's are not getting any sexual experience.  <br>    You can go to the local topless bar and every guy that is single has had no sex in the last year.  Have them checked for std's and go on with your live.  There is no way to check to see if the man is a virgin or not.  There is no way to tell how many times he has had sex.  There is no way to tell any thing about his sex live.<br>    It is like saying I will not date anyone who has been swimming more than 3 times in his life.<br>    What you are saying is you do not want to be compared with other women.  <br>  We are  compared to other people every day in more ways than you can imagine.

GFYHRTAJaa	honestly yes some people are that evil just to do it, but dont jump into conclusions. get your heart prepared for it,but not too much because it might be just the way youre feeling. go ahead and see whats up and if she does back out just know that you are way worth better than that. NOBODY deserves to be toyed around. theres a lot of women out there who are looking for a decent guy. p.s. let me know what happens on thursday.

I don't think its wrong of you, but to be fair to him you should tell him how you are feeling and maybe you two need to take a break, and see what your options are. If its meant to be then you guys will end up back together and if not at least you didn't waste each others time on something that wasn't going to last anyways. But hope all works out for the best! take care|`|ovrbTxHEaa	I have been with the same guy almost a year and I can tell you we have hit that thinking mode and that blah phase occasionally.  I am surrounded by couples who have been married from 50 years down to 2 years and they all go through it too.  If you think that he isn't someone you would want around for the long haul better to decide that now, but if you think that this is something worth hanging onto then try to liven up the relationship a little, plan a surprise date or do something silly....just break up the norm.  Although both of you hate this mood, it might be a good thing to sit down and have a discussion on what both of you want from this relationship.  If anything maybe the two of you can salvage a good friendship from a going no-where dating relationship.  Good luck.
05367a0d7cefb29c0600aa24d75c941faa	Be alert at all times juz to be save. Talk to someone u trust abt it...i am not sure what kind of person ur step-dad is. If it was the first time or he has only done that twice, i don't think it is a problem. But, remember that as a girl, u nid to protect urself and noe wad's wrong frm right. Thanks for askin the qn!=0)|`|djUMvICoaa	I think you better have a talk with your mother.  He could be 'grooming' you, getting you to drop your defenses around him and then he will start touching you where he shouldn't, 'little accidents' he'll call them and it will only get worse from there.  At the very least it was not the right thing to be saying to you and grabbing your waist not smart either.  I feel this is all wrong.|`|frRinHFiaa	TOTALLY INNAPROPRIATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Ask your mom what she thinks it means. It could be possibly he actually likes your shorts and that's it. However, it sounds like by "grabbing your waist" he is crossing the line.<br>  <br>  Tell your mother|`|6C5NDSBSaa	Tell your mother right away. It doesn't sound right and he shouldn't be grabbing you anywhere!|`|MlDs21jAaa	i think he meant he was sexually attracted to you. and he likes when you wear those shorts and that he doesn't have a problem expressing his interest in you, or them, when he wants. where was your mom? how long have they been together/married? I would strongly advise you to talk to your mom, and to talk to a counselor at school. let them know what's going on and let your step-dad know that this is not tolerable and you won't accept it either. in some cases, there can be some revenge/consequences for speaking up about verbal/sexual abuse; but speak now before it becomes full on physical sexual abuse!!|`|nVQHPyvJaa	I think he's a pervert.<br>  <br>  Talk to your mother about it. If it happens again, talk to a school counselor or teacher if she's not doing anything.|`|jxeQWLpWaa	ewwwwwww....just use your senses did he hold you in a fatherly way or perverted way??? if you feel that it was wiered and uncomfortable then just watch him if he is really making you uncomfortable do not hold back and tell some one!!!|`|VkmXjmBNaa	he thinks he looks lovely in themand is proud of how youve grown up so much,i wouldnt callhim a perv :]|`|B0ypUuHXaa	He is totally a pervert. Grabbing your waist is not normal, and commenting on your high shorts is also very pervy. Tell your mum about it because he is probably sexually attracted to you, and we all know where that leads.|`|RZ4dpbrJaa	hes a creep. id tell your mom if i were you.
xarKlp0Oaa	I would just ask him and tell him how you feel. I am sure that it is just a phase that he is going through.

BKr3y30maa	Because they are stupid and are never satisified.|`|a984cQjKaa	there are a lot of reasons.  some people are just low down dirty lying scalliwags, who care only about themselves.   others cheat because a need they have-attention, understanding, good sex, etc.-is not being met in their current relationship, and they're taking the easy way out rather than bringing it up with their partner and fixing things.|`|2DNH6maiaa	In my opinion people that cheat are just self centered and only care about their own needs. They have total disregard for who they hurt and seem to only feel guilty about their cheating when they get caught. So therefor I have come to the conclusion that it is an illness and once a cheater always a cheater.|`|drEfr9waaa	The boring truth is that they are untrustworthy individuals.

Those who are your age are more than likely intimidated by it. Those who are older however probably think, again due to your height, that you are older than you are.<br>  <br>  Don't get upset with the "old codgers" at all. Just smile, look at them and say something like..."Think I should tell you first that I'm a minor and you might want to talk to someone else." That should do the trick each and every time...hopefully.
AA11221025	just go and sit with your friends and ignore her childishness. you are giving her power if you allow her to boss you around like this. Push in to the group and dont give her a chance to say theres no room. shes flexing her muscles and showing off to all your friends - show her up as a meanie and just be cool and casual around your friends about her.|`|bc70e3a16900c4dd03ebe4dc89b0161daa	It is always difficult with group friendships because there are so many variables.  But first off, you need to meet with this friend individually, alone.  Maybe after school at her house.  There may be some rumor she has heard that you are unaware of that is against you.  Often when a friendship is strained, it is so much easier to get to the root of the problem 1 on 1. <br>  As with groups of friends, you stated it yourself, they are your friends as well as hers.  So she does not have the right to make you leave the table.  If she is uncomfortable for whatever reason, then she should leave, not you!  Make sure she knows how important her friendship is to you.  I hope things work out for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck and God Bless!|`|Jhr68T0baa	maybe she likes you? <br>  your friends are being out of order for ignoring you too and just following this girl. they seem scared of her.<br>  talk to her and ask her what her problem is?|`|bRQlgxW9aa	If she is going to treat you like that do you really want or need her as a friend? If so try and speak to her when she is on her own and ask her why she is treating you like this, there may be a simple explanation (peer pressure etc). But if she has been to your house and you do a lot of stuff for her and other friends yet you have never been to her house then is there a friendship there or has she just been using you? sorry this may sound harsh but don't let people take advantage of you, if you become friends again then i would stop doing as much for them so you know the friendship is real and your not being used. hope this helped.
UDInHk0jaa	Good quote to ruminate on. I agree and disagree with it at the same time for all sorts of reasons. For example, it implies or I infer that it says<br>  that we don't even know ourselves any more than we know other people which is true at times in our lives (where I agree), BUT there is a difference between the two because we can ALWAYS control what we do while we can NEVER control what others do (where I disagree). <br>  <br>  Usually when one writes "there is as much difference..." he/she is saying that there isn't much difference|`|AXbdNdPzaa	that sounds about right.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Sounds to me like the kind of fake "depth" that any hack philosopher can project by stating a contradiction in misty sounding terms.

We all have our faults, there for no one is perfect.<br>   The funny thing is people have this picture in their heads of what they would like to have in a partner and what they end up getting in the end is nothing like what they thought they wanted, funny how that works. Love works in mysterious ways!|`|Zm3QIw4Taa	we like Perfect men bc they are rare. usually we dont look at "looks" or at least i dont and we just want a gentleman. someone who we can trust and someone we know wont cheat on us.. just be sweet and a gentleman and you'll get someone =]]|`|BKr3y30maa	There is no such thing as a perfect man.  Just like there is no such thing as a perfect woman.  People that think that are delusional.|`|B2HxSOGZaa	I personally don't want a perfect man, that kind of person would not be real. "Perfect" people are fake. I want someone with flaws, and a real personality and someone who can be down to earth. I once dated a so called perfect man.. what a disaster!!!

He's real, honest, and can accept that I'm not perfect.|`|ik9hP6FBaa	ladies want a dream guy, they want everything about him to be perfect, but girl's dont realize that it can never happen. flaws is what makes a guy perfect but girl's dont believe that. to me, i think flaws are hot, no guy should try to be perfect around a girl, and if that girl does not think that you are "perfect", ha screw her, dont try to be perfect! that is just stupid|`|EJWphb88aa	Its not the matter of Perfection... its a fact that Beauty lies in the eyes of beholder.. its not necessary wats good for me might be good for someone else... if you ask me all i c in my man is honesty, companionship, understanding, intelligence... if he excel in this.. he is the best looking man for me on this earth ;)|`|m8alP5kPaa	There is no such thing as a perfect man or a perfect woman.<br>  <br>  All I want is a man that won't cheat or lie to me...is that asking too much?

ZzjUHawhaa	OPEN YOUR EYES!! OMG - he loves you sweetie and he knows you deserve better and he wants to give you better. Oh my goodness your guy friend is in love with you but he will not over step his boundaries because you are married. he respects you and he is not going to put you in that position. he will never say these words to you because you are married but he wants you to get out of that relationship so he can give you a great one. he is rite. u r scared to leave him but look - someone else is waiting for u. ur guy friend is really ur dream husband. that's y he is mad. ur hurting yourself by staying with ur husband and it hurts him to see you that way. Ahh, i think you should talk to you guy friend in person. don't call or tex. u need to see him face-2-face.|`|WdWjdQliaa	Well close friends do get tired and frustrated looking from the outside perspective on in to a situation.  He feels that you are unhappy and that your husband is disrespectful.  As a friend, that can be very hard because you want the best for your friends.  And since he is a guy, its hard to talk about these things like you would to a girl friend.  Guys and girls think differently, us girls over analyze situations, vent about men but never truly DO anything about it, it just makes us feel better to say what we feel and get our anger out without any real action.  Men, on the other hand, do not do that.  Give him some time, maybe he will come around and talk to you normal again, but I would suggest not talking about your marriage or any sort of that talk with him unless its positive and leave the ranting to your girl friends.  Also, he may have feelings for you, because its is almost always impossible for men and women to be friends without someone being attached emotionally.|`|qfuhHeDjaa	hes in love with you. he wants to be more than friends but understands the only way to be in your life, and around you, is to be just friends so it hurts him to see your husband treat you this way and he cant do anything about it because he doesnt want to cross the line by telling you he loves you cuz then he risks losing you totally...<br>  <br>  if id have to venture a guess and its not tooooo bold of me id say you may possibly have feelings for him too? just the vibe i get, i apologize if thats out of line|`|Z3wg4Z3daa	tl;dr version please|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	I think it depends on your relationship style.<br>  <br>  Some women want to go out with their husbands, some women are grateful when their hubbies go out on their own. It just depends what they are doing. For me- The hubbie goes to the club, goes golfing, has a drink with buddies ok. <br>  <br>  It just depends on how much, how often etc.<br>  <br>  What seems weird is your best friend man thing. Could he be into you? Because it sounds like he may be criticizing your hubbie a bit too much. Since you obviously gripe to him about your hubbie, you are kind of opening the door to that behavior.<br>  <br>  If the ebst friend is into you... Then that is probably why it bugs him to see you in a situation *HE* feels is appropriate. Or he could be just possesive..<br>  <br>  My suggestion to you would be to decide for yourself if your' happy and if you like your relationship as is, and if you do, tell your friend that.<br>  <br>  As for your hubbie sending weird email. the best friend should just ask him to stop.

It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. <br>  <br>   8Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. 11When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. 12Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. <br>  <br>   13And now these three remain: faith, hope and love.

X51MqWhhaa	first off most people will assume something is wrong with you if you havent dated before. BUT it doesnt mean ur weird, it just means you dont want a meaningless relationship, your looking for a serious one...and so what you havent found that girl. I dated a few boys I wish I hadent, just because I didnt want to be a "boyfriendless weirdo" so Find a girl you like, get to know her and take it from there.|`|Y8dXwds5aa	no because you wont be happy dont try to please other people the most important is yourself  it doesnt matter about your track record on relationships  there are some people that actually start dating when they get into college...but if you dont want a relationship start meeting girls as friends|`|IAIBzgOgaa	not at all|`|bbbf3755af9f136a17c38ee61766a578aa	they expect you at a certain age that you already have dated someone or got your first Kiss already. its okay if you haven't because some people don't want to be in a relationship and focusing on more important things like school or work. while others that haven't been in a relationship also haven't found the right one. its your choice and if they find you weird then that's there opinion. my bf has only dated me and he is 20. its different but its still cute that im his first gf and 1st kiss and i wanted to make it special for him. if the girl likes you alot she wont care that she is your first gf.|`|74gPuaXMaa	A lot of people do. I didn't get into my first relationship until I was 17, but I dated different girls before that.

It was lovely. <br>  <br>  You do whatever you think best, and take no notice of what anyone else thinks.|`|G64z6K1naa	NO! There is nothing wrong with that. EVERYONE is different its just some people don't understand that. If it bothers you that much don't tell anyone just act casual. Most girls arn't that bothered, they will feel more special knowing you've had no memories with another girl and you get to share them with her. So don't panic and start searching!!<br>  <br>  *Good Luck*|`|AA10928214	That's really just up to you. Who cares what other people think, quite honestly I think it's stupid. If you aren't weird, then the person that starts going out with you will know that and like you for you.

dD8CxaRhaa	She seems to keep on going to her bf who hits her and stuff...<br>  Her sister tells u she likes u but she denies it...<br>  <br>  Maybe she does like you but she's afraid of the concequences, what her bf will do if he finds out. You can see that bcz she told u she liked u but she just went back with her bf.<br>  <br>  I think you should talk to her and tell her not to be afraid. She obviously feels better around you. Talk to her and make her understand that you are much better for her and she will realise it after a while. She's probably confused about what she should do. Tell her that you will always be behind her, whatever she does. <br>  <br>  But she is 15...R u sure u rilli like her? R u gonna waste everything for her? (It's no insult its just something you have to ask yourself)<br>  But u obviously like her since u had a 2 year crush on her.<br>  But I'm sure everything will work out just fine xD<br>  <br>  And it's not about your looks, you look perfectly fine!|`|4LunY702aa	honestly i think you should find someone else. This girl sounds like she only wants you for a rebound guy. And if this girl is 15 im pretty sure she ain't ready for a relationship that you're ready for. Find a girl on your level that's more mature and doesn't play with you mind. Two years for a girl that's only gonna shout you down is too long of a time to wait|`|FmhUZLgoaa	Your 17 she is 15 not a good idea to have anything to do with her romantic wise. Just stay clear and move on.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	You are beating a dead horse.<br>    She has problems with self esteem and if you got with her your life would become a nightmare.<br>    Count her as a lost cause and find a girl that would never go with someone who abused her.|`|jJLc6uG1aa	You deserve someone that isn't wishy washy with you.

She is confused. End of story. I can guarantee if you get a girlfriend she would come running to you. But don't do that because it wouldn't be fair to the other girl. So I think the best thing you can do right now is stay away from her for awhile so she can sort things out and if someone else comes along in the meantime, so be it. I think you are a nice looking guy so I wouldn't worry about that.|`|fQgbBx7caa	You won't take the advice but, she is only using you for comfort.  Girls like this will stay with the abusive guy until one of four things happen.  She gets beat on a daily/weekly basis,  gets pregnant  Or, ask you have seen on t.v. (God heavens forbid this one) death.  Gets pregnant and he beats her.  You can only help someone so long, mention to her that she should get out, if she does not that should be the end of the help from you.  She will keep doing this.
Jhc44hcyaa	Move on. She is wasting your time. Also trust me, you wouldn't wait till marriage to have sex, you are 17. So go out, meet more women, and this one might or might not come around, but your best bet is diverting your attention to other girls, and that way you wont be freaking out if what you are doing is right or wrong.|`|AA10928214	Well, sometimes abusive relationships can be like that, and you don't know how to get away from them, or the person feels like they can't. You should have a serious conversation about your relationship with her. If this guy is seriously hurting her then that needs to be taken care of first.|`|2IILBm42aa	Don't keep waiting in the wings for her. Theres nothing you can do really, if she rejects you when you share your iner feelings then thats her problem. Shes in the wrong path too... shes 15 and lost her virginity? Gosh...|`|0s8EAByGaa	How bout her pic? :)<br>  Kidding. I'm a guy, so this is the best opinion you will get  about you:<br>  1. You look trained<br>  2. tough<br>  3. Way too serious :)<br>  4. I'm not gay<br>  She is undecided and she is 15, naive little girl, you must have a serious discussion about relations and future. And you must think if you really want to put a rock on her finger. <br>  Try to be with her, tell her why you are better than the other guy. But if she is too dumb to see that, then i think there is not much to discuss about|`|zOIgzIy4aa	i,am not a lady but you want to know what i think? i think you better start looking elsewhere because it sounds to me like she don,t know what she wants in life. if she would get with you then she probably would keep running back to him.|`|BKr3y30maa	You're cute.  It seems like she doesn't know what she wants.  It's sad to know that she went back to the guy that hits on her.  If she can't see what type of guy she could have if she chose you, then I think you deserve better than that.  Don't hold on too long and miss out on the right girl.

9624d1b569ca710536d56a309ae51f7aaa	Babies do it too... usually a sign that they have GAS....

ADP9swbMaa	Everyone does it. No one is exactly the same way around every group of people they know. You're not exactly the same way around close friends as they way you are with your parents, are you? Especially when you were his age? How about work acquaintances v long-time friends v strangers? Face it, everyone has a slightly  different persona around different groups of people. It doesn't mean they're being fake. They're just adapting to what is appropriate for the situation.|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	you are probably embarrasing him a bit. <br>  <br>  little bro may be highly sensative. Perhaps the hugging in public thing makes him embarrassed.|`|QyXjTX5caa	'cause his stupid...|`|IMPh53Ssaa	most people are like that, its normal|`|DB5zieYbaa	Is very simple, he doesn't like to be seen like big sisters little cute brother. He is becoming an adult and he probably feel ashamed that you come and "darling-him" in front of his friends, is perfectly undestandable. You talk about solving a problem, and actually the isue is yours not his. It is you who doesn't understand that is completly allright for him that in family to show feelings like that, like you were his mom, but it isn't cool in front of the friends, as simple as that, I don't see why you should consider this a problem. Just be loving in a more intimate situation, but let him be when he is with freinds.|`|uA4tJuZbaa	He's probably trying to "impress" them.
1JVAZbt7aa	dont wear very much just maybe some lipgloss or something at first then slowly go into powder and eyeshadow and stuff|`|05367a0d7cefb29c0600aa24d75c941faa	When u noe that u are in the right age to do so.|`|h0U42w2xaa	Why do you need to wear make-up?<br>  <br>  If it's because of problem skin (ie. acne), then explain that you feel more comfortable wearing it.<br>  <br>  If you don't have skin problems, you are probably already very beautiful and don't need make-up, especially at such a young age.<br>  <br>  Make-up can send the wrong message to older guys, and if you are young, there is plenty of time to grow up.
T9m0YQgFaa	no way, it's a form of cheating.<br>  it's like chatting up a girl in a pub.<br>  you wouldn't except that would you?<br>  NO.<br>  he has you, he shouldn't need anything more.<br>  try talkign to him about how it makes you feel, warn him you will leave if it carries on.<br>  if he doesn't stop leave him.<br>  i know how hard it is.<br>  i spent 7.5 yrs in an abusive/lying/cheating relationship.<br>  chatting girls up online hurt just as much as him cheating in any other way.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	No definitely not.  Whether you know about it or not he is still chatting up other women in the hope it will lead somewhere.  It's the same as if he was chatting up other women right in front of you in the pub|`|911f168b7fa0b89caa5732f8b9174286aa	not if it upsets you  or  you find it excluding your 'over checking'.

If he has you, he doesn't need to chat up anyone else.<br>  <br>  Don't put up with it, I did for a year and wish I hadn't!!|`|f1lpdiNEaa	Not at all! He should be spending time and giving attention to you rather than chatting up other women.|`|Pp4F6D5Waa	Nah not really, its still cheating but not as bad.|`|eb51b2a5d9553593735e2748c3c6f209aa	Nooooo!!!

HE'S USING EXCUSES DROP HIM, RUN FOR THE HILLS AND NEVER TURN BACK.|`|e6Yd5vsNaa	No it is not, i caught my last bf doing this when we first started going out i caught him and confronted him and he was still doing it 3 years later even after begging me not to dump him because it will never happen again so i got rid.|`|a984cQjKaa	i don't mind if he talks to other women, but there'd be a fight if he was flirting or talking dirty with them.|`|10ef8c48e3ba55a59f16e3badd0a5b52aa	NO AND NO|`|1rHgZ0Y8aa	No
dD8CxaRhaa	Tell your boyfriend how much it irritates you, but don't come out too harshly, after all, it is his brother.

BaNrweQ4aa	there could be a number of reasons why this person isn't texting back:<br>  <br>  1) no credit/free texts/minutes left<br>  2) been a bit busy - and have some things to deal with (problems,family problems and just generally a bit confused)<br>  3) they are ill and can't be bothered with their phone<br>  4) phone is broke<br>  5) lost phone charger<br>  <br>  :) it could be anything. why don't you try ringing him on his home phone - or speaking to him on msn? (if he's a close mate; if he's not - just wait until he gets in contact with you) :D don't take it personally; because i'm sure there is a reasonable explanation for it.|`|8McA6xqPaa	I'd say don't take it too personally, maybe they forgot? or maybe they've got bigger things going on? I wouldn't worry about it though, try to talk to him in person or text again when you have something to say otherwise it'll seem like your pestering him. If he's off with you then coolly ask if he's okay and if somethings happened between the two of you, but until then don't jump to conclusions as its probably just a casual mistake.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped :)<br>  Cali|`|CEKAqtB1aa	Well most times I never text back because I cannot be bothered or I forget but my friends know me. I'd say forget about it and don't take it so personally.|`|7fh3JCVxaa	maybe he lost his phone? or maybe he read that text, thought he would reply later but then totally forgot. or he has no credit, it could be anything.x|`|bIjI8BTBaa	do the reverse and ignore him !<br>  <br>  he'll start to know how it feels and uderstand how you felt, then maybe he'll stop!<br>  <br>  but its only a text, there could be a few reasons hes not answering :)|`|oJTxk2cDaa	Yes I agree it is rude, not my style.|`|ZZkInusMaa	My mate is egnoring me 2 .. but you just have to get on with it or why not try confrunting them of what they are doing !! <br>  hope u try it ..<br>  hope it works ..

ovrbTxHEaa	As a woman I have asked for space or to slow down and breaking up was not my intention.  It may be that she is heading toward ending your relationship, but it could be that she has a lot going on and needs a breather to sort some things out in her head.  Ask her if she really needs some time or if she is just trying to end it, either way you will know. If she does need space, be supportive because there is a reason so don't give up on her.  Hang in there.|`|VOLUMBkJaa	No. She just want's you to back off some. Chill.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Just tell her that's fine and to let you know when she has decided and that in the mean time you are going to carry on and act as single till she has made her mind up. She is mucking you around and wants you hanging on and begging. Don't give her the satisfaction.|`|4EWCegiRaa	It means EXACTLY what is sounds like.  She needs a little space and she wants to slow things down because they're moving too fast.<br>  <br>  If she wanted to end it, she'd say "I'm ending it".  It's probably this nervous, freaking out mentality (the one that made you think it's over) that makes her want a break...|`|bbbf3755af9f136a17c38ee61766a578aa	its not over she just wants some time apart from you for awhile and chill. just hang out with your friends and family for the mean time and just call her back after a few days to a week to see if she is feeling up to hanging with you again.|`|Di6FAQxRaa	She wants time to think over if she wants to be with yo or not, or maybe you are moving too fast for her in some ways that she wants you to take it slower.

FXCoGD44aa	You honestly can't expect your first time [[or even first several times]] having sex - whether you waited until marriage or not - to be absolutely "amazing." That's a common misconception of people who do wait til marriage.<br>  <br>  If you want to read specifically about this "tantric sex" then google it. But I'll tell you right now that sex isn't great right out of the gate. Good sex takes time and practice.<br>  <br>  Also, did you know that the majority of woman cannot achieve orgasms through intercourse? I can't at all. Only about 30% can. Don't set the bar so high when you haven't even tried it yet, or you're bound to be disappointed. I'm not saying that you aren't going to be able to, just don't EXPECT it. If it happens - good for you... if it doesn't, that's normal.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	i would say, don't worry too much about it.  it is best to just be yourself the your body react to it, time, love, thought and caring will answer all of your questions.  good sex takes both to make it happenend.|`|Xw0pFjRpaa	<a href="http://www.ivillage.co.uk/relationships/sex/hots/articles/0,,172_626650,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ivillage.co.uk/relationships/...</a> <br>  that should help a bit, good luck

CkN4pgpCaa	I think it's pretty risky.  The website does not allow returns and exchanges, so you will be stuck with whatever you buy.  Besides it possibly not fitting, the quality may not look as good in person and it may not be as flattering on.  Just think of how many times you've seen a cute dress or outfit in a store and tried it on and it was just... not flattering!  Every metro area has lots of bridal shops and you can call ahead to find out if they're in your price range.  I think every bride should try on their dress before they buy it.  It's a major purchase and will be key in making you look and feel beautiful and confident on your big day.|`|RKsn5dD4aa	I would read their reviews first!  I heard really bad things about one of those company's but cant remember if it was that one specifically.|`|di6p10Ifaa	I came very close to ordering my gown from them.

There is a lady with the screen name anabele something like that and she actually bought her gown from there and has pictures and details on quality and everything. I have emailed her before as well and spoken with her about ordering and whatnot. I think you will find this very helpful. I actually did not end up getting my gown there. My friends kept begging me to go check out Davids Bridal sale so I finally gave in and went. I had no intentions of even trying anything on. Before I knew it I was squeezing into a girdle and petticoat and trying on gown after gown. I found the gown of my dreams that day. No intention even considering buying from Davids Bridal. And my gown from Davids Bridal ended up being way cheaper than it would have from lilywedding.com, not to mention I had the satisfaction of trying it on before I bought it. I am not saying no don't give lilywedding.com a shot, I am just saying, Shop, Shop, Shop before dedicating yourself to a risky investment. Feel completely free to email me if you have any questions. Now I am so glad that I gave something out of my plans a shot. Just to think if I would have continued to think that David's Bridal gowns were too cookie cutter I would have never found my gorgeous gown that I am so in love with.|`|66hMQmyyaa	Honestly...I have heard too many horror stories from brides who order there stuff online. This day will only come once, I'd rather spend a little extra money to guarentee that its right, then fight with a company that might mess things up and then be left at the alter with no dress. Plus...the alteration alone might cost a fortune if its wrong. If you buy your dress from a bridal store, all that stuff is included (most of the time).<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you decide though :)
4zqGPICsaa	Hey Johnny T,<br>  Firstly, when you like someone, it will always seem like they kinda like you back, so if you thought she liked you in the past, but not anymore, she might've not liked you from the beginning.  I dont want to offend you, but reality is, if she is distant, she is probably uninterested. And what I don't understand is that You want to tell Her that you had a crush on her awhile back? WHY WOULD YOU? because as far as i know, awhile back means you don't like her anymore, and you only want to get it off your chest. If you don't like her anymore, and she doesn't like you. Then whats the point of this whole thing? Shes already moved on, as you described, she doesnt care anymore, you don't have to feel bad because you "didn't respond" because seems like its too late already.

He has to stop, he needs to get involved in a support group.  Honestly, if you have family or anywhere else to go, I would leave him until he gets his life together.

If he won't then you need to look out for what's best for you and the children.|`|GYoNyoWtaa	There are several things you will need to do and some of them are very hard to do. <br>  <br>  The first thing you have to do is to hide all your valuables, and if this person lives with you, then you need to keep them behind locked doors and if that is not possible then take them to a bank and lock them in a safety deposit box.<br>  <br>  If this person is you child or your spouse then you need to limit there access to your money. In many circumstances people have spent their family's savings and kid's college funds. So if at all possible try to get that persons name of the accounts if it is not already too late, and cancel all their credit cards.<br>  <br>  At some point you will have to confront them. When you do confront them it is important to not yell and do not get angry just tell them how what they are doing affects you. Make sure that all the persons close friends are there to help with this.<br>  <br>  It is important that everyone take turns and tell the person how his gambling has affected their relationships, but in a non angry, caring manner. This will help the person realize that the people that care about him see something that maybe he does not and hopefully will take an honest look at his gambling.<br>  <br>  Remember the goal of confronting someone is not to make them stop gambling, it is to help them recognize they have a gambling problem and to encourage them to seek professional help.<br>  <br>  Some people recommend that you try to get your friend to go to a gamblers anonymous meeting, but I do not recommend this. Gamblers Anonymous is a great organization that truly helps those with gambling problems stay away from gambling, but before you are ready for this most people need one on one sessions with a psychologist or a counselor trained to deal with gambling addiction.<br>  <br>  After all is said and done, you must be prepared because most of the time the gambler continues to gamble, maybe they will make a brief attempt to stop before starting again in secret.<br>  <br>  With most addictions the person with the problem needs to hit what they call a "bottom". This is when the gambler has lost everything that really meant anything to them, such as family and friends, and it is only at this point many will see the problem and seek help.<br>  If you know someone who is unwilling to admit their gambling problem I recommend that after you have tried your best to get this person to seek help if they do not, you may have to be prepared to leave them, remember at some point you have to abandon a sinking ship before you go down as well.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Like most addictions, he does not recognize that he has one, it usually takes hitting rock bottom before they realize that they do have a problem.  As harsh as this sounds your going to need to push him to the bottom, and to do that you may have to file for divorce.  Hopefully he will then get some help and you will once again have a stable household.  But you have to keep in the back of your mind, that he could go the other way, and figure he is worth more dead than alive.  This is what happen to my mother-in-law.  She also had a gambling addiction.  So try to push him to the rock bottom for his own sake and hopefully yours and the kids.  By the way, if he ever touches you again, then you have to file charges against him, you do not want your children to think it is normal to allow abuse in your household.  Good luck|`|RIRa9hUjaa	He's a gambler and an abuser.  Gather as much money as you can and flee.  File for divorce & have the state garnishee his wages for child support. You may also qualify for alimony.  Don't know about your state, but in my state the man usually gets raked over the coals.|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	Suggest counseling.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	Leave his bags on the front porch, have the locks changed and get a restraining order.  He'll never change.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Run for the hills. Things will only get worse. Cut your loses (no pun intended.)|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	you can't fix him. <br>  <br>  Leave him and make it clear you're only willing to come back once he's seeked professional help. This could go on for years if you don't put your foot down now. Take what ever money is left and call your parents. Leave him to sink to the bottom, it's the only way to make him understand the enormity of his problem.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Divorce him and have child support taken directly out of his check before he can lose it gambling.  You will still need a job to make ends meet, so you will have to get creative about daycare.  Home daycare is often cheaper than a center and just as good or better.  Also, a lot of jobs you can work 12 hour shifts, three days a week, so there would be fewer days of daycare to pay for.|`|pOTigVYPaa	You ask how do you confront your husband about his addiction?  You already did and got slapped for it and he walked out on you and your children.  You deserve some peace of mind and security.  I strongly suggest that you get your own place for you and the children and look for a job and cheaper day care. (Ever try family and friends?)  Could you move back in with relatives?  Your husband needs an ultimatum in order to get his act together otherwise I see the ending of your marriage.  He needs to know this.|`|FQ9ZL0PRaa	Give him an choice...you or gambling.
CvMfrY9Naa	Don't you find it a bit ironic that your name on here is no lies just love. If your friend was a real friend she wouldn't be going to hang out with your ex. Regardless of the situation a friend would stay away she probably likes him and is trying to get with him, most girls are catty like that and nothing good can come from them hanging out. As for your ex tell him it will be hard but it can help you in two ways...He'll have less of an interest in your friend and eventually he may cool off and realize how much you like him. Whatever you do lying will get you into trouble especially when a friend and boyfriend are involved.
C30NreILaa	I would go with guy one or three cuz they understand you and want to be there for you so it would be better for your daughter cuz if you think about her future, will it go anywhere with guy number two supporting you?|`|Pp4F6D5Waa	NOT guys 2+3, maybe guy number 1. But dont see anyone at the moment, look after yourself and your children. Good luck
v398Qalyaa	i'd play it cool in front of him, just smile, say 'hello', if he contacts you then you'll know he wanted your number, if not, don't be embarrassed, just pretend it's no big deal|`|927uCSR7aa	so let me get this straight...you gave a guy your number and your already in a relationship...and the guy you gave your number to keeps staring at you? if thats what your saying then im gonna guess that he likes you as a sister and doesnt want to risk anything but he is playing mind games with you and trying to tease you but obviously you dont like it and your boyfriend is going to be really mad when he finds out. especially if the 2 guys are friends...then you are defiantly in for it.|`|SI02JOQ4aa	OK - wait a few days and play it cool.<br>  <br>  Then say, <br>  "OK..... OK.... so the number and email I gave you were fake.........let me know when you want my real ones"<br>  <br>  On the other hand, he might be trying to build up the courage to call/mail you - so give him a chance.|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	You should do nothing. Try to work on the relationship you already have and work on your loyalty issues.|`|bfBzkuRqaa	It's just a number...lighten up!|`|be52fc0d175d76bbbfd17b8117a2d632aa	Give it a few days for him to contact you. If he hasn't by then he is unlikely to. If he does contact you, you will have to decide if you want him as a friend or bf. If you want him as a bf then break up with your present one as its not fair to string him along. When you see him tomorrow just act normally smile and say "hi" or whatever.
AA11733625	I've been in your shoes.... <br>  <br>  IF he knows how you feel about him, and he wants to keep it as friends, then you need to find a way to most past it and accept it. Even if that means not hanging out with him for awhile. It's very hard and it hurts... but that is what you have to do. No sense in staying around him torturing your heart. <br>  <br>  If he doesn't know how you feel, you need to buck up, and brace yourself and let him know and take his answer.. .good or bad and go from there.|`|1ZvrZGCaaa	Tell him =)|`|pyzd6yEYaa	have you tried tellin him on how you feel|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	think positive. you're a worthwhile person. there are more fish in the sea.|`|FkJobxmGaa	let him know how you feel before it's too late....trust me i know i've loved my best girl friend since i was 14 and i never told her now it's too late because she married this great guy....don't live in regret like i did take your chance instead of wondering what if?|`|O5Z6M9Rlaa	This is a difficult one.

AA10478980	He loves you when he takes care of you when you are sick, when he accepts your family and friends despite their faults, when he puts your needs before his own, when he does little things to please you.  That is also how he will know that you love him.|`|AA10389562	There is one true test of love.<br>  <br>  Go shopping for a Christmas tree together.  Decide on the perfect tree.  Bring is back home.

I said the same to my ex, and deeply inside I resented her for making me wait. I was annoyed, but at the same time I couldn't break up with her because I was with her for so long. I ended up playing along with the yea it's fine let's stay virgins until marriage, but I finally burst in the end. <br>  <br>  Guys have horomones. That's the beginning and end of the story.|`|ZzjUHawhaa	if he didn't love you then he would show it in his actions. if he is still doing the same thing and acting the same way and treating the same way as before then he really does love and respect you. all these things would change if he wasn't and if he was cheating. Remember, if he changes his normal loving ways and both of you start arguing over simple stuff then he doesn't love you and he is cheating. if all is good then cherish him because he cherishes you:)|`|4zqGPICsaa	Why would you be paranoid?<br>  Seriously, there is nothing to be worried about.<br>  You have a boyfriend who tells you he loves you everyday, and actually doesnt mind waiting when it comes to sex.<br>  THAT'S RARE!<br>  just appreciate it ,<br>  and don't worry.|`|angW1Lkfaa	Good make him earn your trust.

QVVafz76aa	It seems that you are looking for a simple answer. There unfortunately is not one. There never is when it comes to feelings of love and affection. As you get older in life one thing that becomes apparent is that things happen for a reason. Short of being physically separated say in an invasion catastrophe etc, people drift apart for reason. <br>  <br>  My guess is you are seeking the old boyfriend who is in the military because of the void that has been growing with the guy you have trust issues with now. It is extremely common when a relationship goes into this stage to look back and remember the good before whether it is old flames or old situations like maybe when you were single. It is kind of a trap.  <br>  What you will come to realize is that eventually you will meet boy C, someone who has not even come into the picture yet in the relationship context.  There is no definite answer in this situation. It is part of the process. For every door that closes another opens.<br>  <br>  The reality is that you drifted from the first guy for a reason. This probably has nothing to do with why things have not worked with the guy you have trust issues with. <br>  <br>  As many on here have already said the trust thing is probably something that will never be resolved. It could be that you have trust issues and that is a whole different can of worms that you need to work on. Unfortunately it is something that you will have to do better within the next relationship and something that you can not go back and fix here.<br>  <br>  I guess what I am saying is you need to forget A and B and prepare yourself for the eventual C. I know it seems really difficult now but time does give you clarity down the road.|`|7RFRGDL6aa	how can you love two men at once??|`|xkMkPwZkaa	if you have trust issues with this guy you need to move on, if you go on and marry him whats to say he won't cheat on you. this guy in iraq seems to like you alot, and if yall never really broke up you still are with him. you still have feelings for him wait for him to get home be at airport waiting then see how it plays out. good luck|`|hkl6Zz2zaa	well first of all you have to choose one cause you cant have both and if you see a future with the one your with right now then you were meant to be and stay with him and the other guy in iraq just tell him you want to be friends with him theres notthing wrong with that or you can just let both of them go and wait for your dream guy to come|`|sC2WFC81aa	Drop them both. Chances are, your little lover overseas is prolly goin around with a sandie now. Go find a new guy. =D|`|xZI6noJiaa	Well, with the first guy- you say you have major trust issues. Hun, a relationship without trust will NEVER last, no matter how strongly you feel about him. Since you're moving away from him, the issues are only gonna get worse. As much as it may hurt, making a clean break right now is probably best. You don't want to have to worry about who you can trust for the rest of your life, and not having any trust in a relationship can spread into other aspects of your life.<br>  As for the other guy, who knows. Just keep talking to him. If you don't want to be with him right now, just let him know you're not in a good place for a relationship right now.|`|ik9hP6FBaa	i honestly believe that it would not work out with anyone, its either you dump the person that you are with and wait for the other guy to come back from iraq or you stay single and explore more people.|`|MTvjvVY0aa	If you don't have trust... you don't have anything at all.  It won't last if trust isn't there, hon.  Sorry.|`|Dv7340P0aa	Just juggle both of them.  Neither are worth it by themselves.|`|h0U42w2xaa	If someone thinks they love two people, then in reality they love neither one, only themselves.<br>  <br>  You keep weighing which guy will make you happier. When you think only of yourself in relationships, it will always be catastrophic.<br>  <br>  Each person in a relationship needs to be giving 100% (NOT 50/50 as is commonly prescribed) for it to be happy.<br>  <br>  Loving conditionally is the best thing we humans are capable of, but thankfully, God loves us even though we are disgusting, selfish, and full of sin and sent Jesus to die to pay for our sins so we can have new life and peace between us and God.

HnEcgVGiaa	Hi Emma,<br>  <br>  Our last two lines makes it sound like you're pretty desperate! Don't rush it though! Love isn't something that you can't force. When you do that, it always turns out pretty bad.<br>  <br>  There isn't anything wrong with you, except that it seems like you're perhaps trying way too hard and worrying excessively about it. Everyone wants to find that special someone who they can love and cherish back and forth.<br>  <br>  You know that you have to be patient. This is a test of your endurance. Now, I don't know if you are wondering if you'll find the right guy based upon your previous experience or the fact that you haven't had a boyfriend yet, but either way, you must wait.<br>  <br>  You will see that your friends may be finding their special people while you are getting left behind. But you aren't alone. There are so many people still waiting. And there's nothing wrong with that.<br>  <br>  All this waiting will definitely be worth it once you find the right guy. I guarantee it. In the meantime, try to strengthen your friendships, forge trust with people, and build connections. This will allow you to get a better sense of the real essence of people.<br>  <br>  Let love play its mysterious role in life. Focus on other important aspects in your life, such as school or work, depending on your age. Enjoy your times being a single girl. <br>  <br>  Respect and love yourself. You deserve a decent guy, so don't fall easily for any guy that comes around. Be observant, asking yourself is this the kind of guy that you can trust with your life? Can this guy love you as his own life? Does he make you laugh? Will he wipe your tears away when you have tissues in both of your hands and you're face is drenched in your cries?<br>  <br>  Be patient. Use this time to prepare yourself. There's much to be done. There are guys that look for the same things in a girl. You're time will come.<br>  <br>  Kind regards,<br>  <br>  Brian|`|yIgd5vDAaa	the more you look, the less likely it is you'll find him.<br>  <br>  <br>  let him come to you.|`|AA11660242	I agree with the first two answerers. Somehow, for some bizarre inexplainable reason, we must rely on chance and probabilities if we want to find our perfect mate. You're trying too hard! Just give it more time, and you'll have your perfect mate in time.|`|2644259d7de8478d97da5240b024af35aa	If you are looking for perfection, then you have to be perfect yourself. what makes you think the perfect guy will go for you, if you aren't perfect yourself?<br>  <br>  Every woman wants Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp and David Beckham, but guess what? Those guys are with perfect women.<br>  <br>  so my advice: find a guy in your own "league."|`|U7UjwzVTaa	First..there's no such thing as the "perfect guy".  When you least expect it, love will find you.  No one's perfect so you have to find the qualities you like and accept the flaws.  Like the saying goes "there's a lid for every pot".|`|d19XmTcLaa	you never find the perfect guy you just learn to see an imperfect person perfectly|`|fexR7a12aa	coz ure trying too hard !|`|AA0MuMt3aa	A man isn't necessary. You might care a lot for who could be your guy, but don't forget to care for yourself.<br>  Life isn't about finding the perfect guy and having a happily ever after ending, life is what you make it to be.<br>  For me, it's about experiences and independence and love.<br>  You can't just rush into a relationship, or just find any old random guy who you think could be your perfect guy, because when guys see a desperate girl, then they will most likely use them or just not be interested.<br>  Just let it come to you, stop searching and trying too hard... Stop worrying about it, it's not important until it becomes serious. Love yourself, don't expect someone to love you and take care of you, take care of yourself and love yourself too, even when you are in a relationship, serious or not, because you need to have your own independence too.<br>  In the end, you have your whole life ahead of you, don't rush it, or you'll regret it and end up with some dumbass. You deserve the best! ^_^<br>  <br>  So just let it come, stop thinking about it, and when it comes embrace it, and take it at a pace you feel comfortable with.<br>  And also, there is no perfect guy, you find your true love and see past their imperfections. Just don't rush it or you'll miss out on a lot.|`|CR8RVs4Kaa	well when I was looking for women, trying to find the right one I ran into hell and back, or found nothing<br>  <br>  just get out and go places, love yourself. just be content with yourself and I promise not only will you attract other people it'll be more than you expected.|`|hkl6Zz2zaa	dont go out there and look for the right guy cause sweety your never find him god promise us a guy and you have to wait he will come you may not see it but trust me when the time is right|`|1jIzBUkhaa	slow down , you have all the time in the world for love.

But just focus on yourself. Start doing things that you want to do and need to do. You could get friends to hang with. Don't tell everybody your heart, that way you won't get hurt.

They probably don't want to upset you.|`|otq0Pv3Paa	i know it hurts but they are prob just trying to spare you the pain of divorce, especially since you are so close to being on your own. that is a decision between the two of them and you should really respect that. you couldn't possibly know all aspects of the story. it could be that it is not final yet so they don't want to say anything until they are sure or they prob don't want to disrupt your life. whatever the reason, it is painful for them as well so let them handle it the best they can. just be patient and let them tell you when they feel it's best. divorce is hard. there is grieving and some people feel like failures even though it's just something that happens. it would make it easier on them if you just kind of stepped back and let them handle it. you already know, that will cushion the blow when they tell you. just give them time. this is hard for everyone.
tPRRUs4Jaa	yeah. sometimes, you just flirt without even knowing or trying to flirt. to some people, it just comes naturally. and i'm one of those people.|`|jLaNVvp3aa	Well, my friends say that I flirt with every guy I see, but it just comes natural. I mean like, touching your hair, smiling, I don't really see it, but apparantly I do. This guy I like even says I flirt with everyone! I don't!|`|ye675T8aaa	apparently i do this alot im just a really friendly person so i deniy this to the ground :)|`|bmJf3AVPaa	all the time!|`|Xw0pFjRpaa	definitely i always flirt with just about every girl, even when i don't even realize i'm doing it, and i can control it if its a very serious subject but alot of the time, my friends (who are girls) just enjoy it so flirt back, we all know its a harmless bit of fun, and they know i'm always there for them when they need me, which is why its so easy to flirt around them, coz everyone is very relaxed about it lol :P|`|GA8uInKDaa	I am a huge flirt. It makes me feel sexy and somewhat harmless if you do not act on it if you attached|`|gXBLJecUaa	Girls say I am, I don't see it. But I also don't see why they would lie about it...|`|cusngBDQaa	with ur dad|`|ykPN1GCPaa	ya,  ^.^
kLsh7RCIaa	To me, the looks don't matter.  As long as the guy is caring, romantic, and thoughtful, he is good in my book.<br>  In my opinion, the cuter the boy, the more he will think of himself where as the non so cute boy will like the idea of having a girlfriend and thinking of her.|`|HxtKRMKAaa	No easy answer.<br>  Women are a very varied creatures and the variety is what makes it fun for men.<br>  Some women are romantic and it is the romancing that wins the day.<br>  Some women are driven for financial security so the end total of income and assets is what decisions are based on<br>  Some women are ruled by appearances and base their choice of mate on the physical needs being met. And so on.<br>  I chose to agree to the most part with the scientific worl.<br>  Mates are most often picked based on pheromones something that most people be they men or women are not even aware of.<br>  Pheromones are not the deal breakers, just the icebreakers.<br>  I do not know why some man snags my attention. But when he does the first thing I do is look him dead in his eyes. When talking that's what I am looking at. After the initial moments I then will quite honestly check him out and yet oddly enough for me its all about character and humour and respect. If I don't  see that straight up I tend to  loose interest. After all if I don't get respect as a stranger it will only get worse with familiarity. Looks are a bonus and so are other assets but in the end for me, he can be as poor as a church mouse but if he respects me and my opinions even when we agree to differ and loves me enough to laugh with me rather than at me,then he is the one.|`|979090faf6f85c0f0923e03261b8a308aa	i dont care what hte dude looks like (well of course i do but not that much) i would totally want the romantic dude, funny, and caring and thoughtful... If he is good looking thats just a bonus not sunting i would just date a guy for X)|`|4YB5Em78aa	i think women pick the good looking guys just because but i think women should go for the romantic and caring one because the good  looking one could turn out not so caring.|`|78d6ef8ee0f77ed0f7f9850021641ce6aa	we usually end up picking looks first, but we all REALLY want romance. why can't we have both? :-||`|0iOqIbfNaa	we pick the nurturing/caring guy|`|v7GH7ulgaa	romance. = ) looks aren't everything you know.<br>  <br>  a good romanitc guy who cares about you vs. a guy who is hot<br>  <br>  <br>  deff. going with the guy who cares
0i80jUKeaa	Just tell him, and the sooner you tell him the better.  Don't wait too long or else it will be harder just tell him now while he will still take it well.  And be completely upfront don't keep leading him on any more than you already have.  It would also be the polite thing to do to give him a hummer out of good faith since you did lead him on.|`|sro58m5zaa	if u dont like him anymore, please just tell him frankly !<br>  <br>  its not fair for him...and for u either ! love is not a joke !|`|czdCtTvWaa	Bad idea,  you should have never told him that you like him like him... you should have said you like him as a friend. Tell him you meant as a friend not as a boyfriend.|`|rM9Oqy68aa	You know what? You just gotta be honest and tell him the truth. He needs to know, you cannot lead him on because that will make the situation worse. So tell him, you don't like him in that way anymore and that you are sorry.|`|OLPgKWFNaa	tell him that you like him as a friend.<br>  and that you always liked him in that way.
0i80jUKeaa	No because I'm not a game player.  People who do that are game players and can't be trusted.|`|JnpZESNHaa	How much do you respect her intelligence?<br>  <br>  If you want her to think you lead your life out of some stupid rule book, where you automatically don't call for 3 days even though you want to, go ahead.  If she's clued up, she'll know exactly what you're doing and she'll think you're insecure and a bit pathetic.  If she's as attractive as you say, you risk losing out to someone with the guts to make her feel a bit more special in the meantime.<br>  <br>  However, if you want her to know that meeting her made your day completely awesome, and that you'd like to see her again, then for heaven's sake, make contact.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm not advocating leaving her 18 voicemails, harrying her with calls, or persecuting her with endless texts.  Just drop her a line, chat to her and leave it up to her how she responds.  She'll find that pretty sexy, I reckon.  :)|`|1NWJmx4Uaa	i think its better to talk to her in either way, i mean, text her, mail her or you may make her to notice you while you all are in a group.|`|Ja6ZqHHpaa	3-4 days|`|VvNKTFhJaa	I don't wait a single minutes if I like a girl.|`|xOQwPGokaa	lol yes it's the 3 day rule everyone knows that|`|JdpYMDQpaa	i wait a day or two. so it doesnt seem that im desperate.|`|3J7xX66waa	Noooooooo,, i dont wate my time,, i jsut go and ask her,, or just hint her in some howllolll;|`|IPS3hWweaa	I wait 1 or 2 days. I just don't want to seem desperate so thats why I'll wait. But I won't let 3 days or more go by before making contact. I think thats just mean. Why bother getting a girl's number if you aren't going to call?|`|Y2jJAx1Caa	stop thinking too much and stop playing games and GO for it|`|3199b0876f36ebe2512f34a5dbe2cc82aa	I know you asked for a guy's opinion so ignore me if you like, but from the other perspective, I think men generally should wait till the next day, if you text them as soon as you've got the number then what do you really have to say? seems a bit desperate, I'd text the next day. Any longer than a day or 2 is foolish, because the girl will lose interest and the attraction that you shared will have lost its momentum or worse, she may think the guy is playing games or not interested and moved on to someone else! So don't delay!|`|DhwcHdfVaa	I know for a fact they do that! <br>  <br>  But I warn you, the ones that do this are game players and I would be cautious.|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	Sounds like you are waiting for some sort of contact.  If a guy can't be bothered to call.  Take it as 'he can't be bothered'.|`|FzFSzilmaa	probably text the same day, to make sure it is the real number...
mwW4zIwIaa	No, mothers aren't always right.<br>  <br>  Do what you think is the right thing. Your mom doesn't know the exact situation like you do. So, if you believe that your mother's idea is a good one, you should do it. But if you don't, do not do it.|`|4SDqRs6Laa	Mothers are not always right, I know mine isn't. You sound a little nuts though. If you guys broke up because you are a drama queen, maybe you should check yourself before you drive this guy completely insane.

Mothers, in fact, have much more experience in life than their children do. I'd listen to her.|`|eAIapfXsaa	No. Mothers are not always right. They just think they're always right. They're just people.

Be friends with him. and relax and enjoy life. The sooner you realise he doesn't want the same as you the better. He couldn't have been cheating on you anyways because you are not to gether. I would be casrefull with this because the way you are behaving may cause him to not even want to be friends. I wouldn't go there.

Plus, if you two broke up, and he is dating or flirting with someone else, it doesn't mean that he is cheating on you. It might just mean he's trying to find someone else he feels is better, but he can't find her. Just tell him upfront (or in a letter--sometimes it helps me to write instead of actually speak) what you feel. Tell him you still have feelings for him and whatever else you'd like to add. Give him the letter or the speech and at the end merely say, "This is just how I feel, and I wanted to share it with you. I'm done saying what I feel and have to. Now, please it's your turn." Say something along those lines and see what happens.<br>  <br>  I hope everything goes well for you.|`|46b917a157d5aaff534db257443de9f5aa	I would go with what your mum said.

I think a lot in the US is cultural differences.   I really like Dominican women esp since they really love to make their boyfriends happy in bed and are not so hung up as American girls.   The only thing about black women is some have skin that is rougher than white women.   But I was once with a Haitian girl and her skin was as black as licorice and very silky.    <br>  <br>  I find women with mixed ethnicity to be the most attractive really.  I had a GF who was half Japanese so she had some Asian features but was also busty and tall.  I think the most attractive celeb now is Beyonce followed by Salma Hayak.<br>  <br>  In the US, I think about 95% or more of inter-racial babies have a white mother and a black father, or an Asian mother and a white father.|`|UI79JnJVaa	"They have to deal with their family."<br>  <br>  "Some members of their families are <br>   uneducated, and want to stay that<br>   way."<br>  <br>  "Some members of their families can't<br>   read or write, and want to pressure the<br>   (quote-unquote) 'White Boy', Like he <br>   owes them something, or everything."<br>  <br>  "Some members of their families are<br>   already on parole for a drug related<br>   felony, or a violent crime, or somehow<br>   connected to a street gang, or mafia."<br>  <br>  "Then, some of their families want the<br>   (quote-unquote) 'White Boy' not to be<br>   too involved with 'their women' anyway,<br>   because she wouldn't want to be too<br>   involved with helping solve her peoples'<br>   problems, any more than he does."|`|6ycZ1LO5aa	Because they got attitude and are fiesty... <br>  Same reason alot of black guys don't go out wiv black women... <br>  N i ent being rude or nefin...

On the other hand, black men are keen to marry white women, because their children will be lighter than they are, and - they hope - more successful.<br>  This is deep and unacknowledged racism, on the part of both blacks and whites  -  but it is still racism.|`|CEKAqtB1aa	You can't generalise white boys like that. If they don't find black girls attractive that's their own opinion and preference which they are entitled to have.

78d6ef8ee0f77ed0f7f9850021641ce6aa	unless he has a child with his ex there is no reason to keep her number. i wouldn't go and end the relationship right away, but ask him why he has it. if he can't respect your feelings than what makes you think he respects the relationship. hope it works out for you though. :)|`|b3zGfYMpaa	If your guy had no contact with her and has solely been with you the entire two years..than I would be wondering why her number was still plugged into his phone? Maybe you should inquire about it since this girl is giving you problems. If he loves you he wouldnt want an ex of all people to come between you both and I know if I were him I'd steer clear of her to avoid the mess. Be straight-forward with him, it shouldnt be a big deal to just delete the number.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	If it's so easy for you to think about ending it, maybe you should. You can do just fine as a single parent. I do it every day. He can still know his father. If you aren't happy, go find some happiness!|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Well since there is a baby involved it would be best to try and talk to him first. Tell him that he is in a relationship with you and you all have a child together and he shouldn't even have his ex's number in his phone anymore that is not showing respect for you.  Hopefully he will see your side and get rid of it...if not then you might want to question why he would want to keep it. Is he still interested in her?|`|bI7yzhkTaa	Okay I went through the same thing here about 16 years ago. Just because you are not in a relationship with him, it doesn't mean that he can't see his child. He may not be as involved in his life now as you would want him to be but things may change in the future, you'll just have to wait and see. It's very important for a child to have his father around unless ofcourse he's abusive.<br>  <br>  As for him still having this ex's phone number... Why doesn't he jus go on Jerry Springer and have a DNA test done. If this girl is his daughter than she has the right to see her father but if it turns out that he isn't her dad than he has no excuse to keep in touch with her. Good luck

4x8hiC1xaa	Phoenix (pronounced /?fi??n?ks/, O'odham Skikik, Yavapai Wasinka, Western Apache Fiinigis, Navajo Hoozdo, Mojave Hachpa 'Anya Nyava)[4] is the capital and largest city in the U.S. state of Arizona, as well as the fifth most populous city in the United States. Phoenix is home to 1,552,259 residents, and is the anchor of the Phoenix Metropolitan Area with 4,179,427 residents. It is currently the largest city in the Southwestern region of the U.S (also known as the "Desert Southwest"). In addition, Phoenix is the county seat of Maricopa County, and is one of the largest cities in the United States by land area.[5] By population, it is the largest state capital in the United States.<br>  <br>  Phoenix was incorporated as a city in 1881 after being founded in 1868 near the Salt River, near its confluence with the Gila River. The city eventually became a major transportation hub in North America and the transportation, financial, industrial, cultural and economic center of the Mountain West. The city has a notable and famous political culture. While it has historically been a stronghold for the Republican Party, in recent years, the metropolitan area as a whole and even more clearly, the city itself, have been shifting slowly towards the left. Phoenix has been home to numerous influential politicians, including Barry Goldwater, John McCain, Janet Napolitano and Sandra Day O'Connor. Residents of the city are known as Phoenicians.<br>  <br>  Native American period<br>  For more than 1,000 years, the Hohokam peoples occupied the land that would become Phoenix.[6] The Hohokam created roughly 135 miles (217 km) of irrigation canals, making the desert land arable. Paths of these canals would later become used for the modern Arizona Canal, Central Arizona Project Canal, and the Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct. The Hohokam also carried out extensive trade with nearby Anasazi, Mogollon, and other Mesoamerican tribes.<br>  <br>  It is believed that, between 1300 and 1450, periods of drought and severe floods led to the Hohokam’s abandonment of the area.[6] Local Akimel O'odham settlements, thought to be the descendants of the formerly urbanized Hohokam, concentrated on the Gila River alongside those of the Tohono O'odham and Maricopa peoples. Some family groups did continue to live near the Salt River, but no large villages existed.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Hispanic period<br>  Father Eusebio Kino, an Italian Jesuit in the service of the Spanish Empire, was among the first Europeans to travel here in the 1600s and 1700s. By this time, the valley was within the territory of New Spain, which was controlled by Spain and later independent Mexico. Father Kino named the river “Río Salado” (Salt River) due to the water’s high mineral content. He interacted with the few native peoples who remained in the valley but focused mostly on the Pima missions established in southern Arizona as well as exploring other parts of the Southwest and California. Only southern Arizona experienced the full influence of Hispanic cultures – the Salt River Valley itself remained almost depopulated for several centuries.<br>  <br>  See also: European colonization of Arizona <br>  <br>  [edit] Early United States period<br>  American and European "Mountain Men" likely came through the area while exploring what is now central Arizona during the early 19th century. They obtained valuable American Beaver and North American River Otter pelts; these animals, as well as deer and Mexican Wolves, often lived in the Salt River Valley when water supplies and temperatures allowed.<br>  <br>  When the Mexican-American War ended in 1848, most of Mexico's northern zone passed to United States control and a portion of it was made the New Mexico Territory (this included what is now Phoenix) shortly afterward. The Gadsden Purchase was completed in 1853. The land was contested ground during the American Civil War. Both the Confederate Arizona Territory, organized by Southern sympathizers in 1861 and with its capital in Tucson, and the United States Arizona Territory, formed by the United States Congress in 1863, with its capital at Fort Whipple (now Prescott, Arizona) included the Salt River Valley within their borders. The valley was not militarily important, however, and did not witness conflict.<br>  <br>  In 1863, the mining town of Wickenburg was the first to be established in what is now Maricopa County. At the time this county did not exist, as the land was within Yavapai County along with the other major town of Prescott.<br>  <br>  The US Army created Fort McDowell on the Verde River in 1865 to quell Native American uprisings. Hispanic workers serving the fort established a camp on the south side of the Salt River by 1866 that was the first permanent settlement in the valley after the decline of the Hohokam. In later years, other nearby settlements would form and merge to become the city of Tempe,[7] but this community was incorporated after Phoenix.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Founding of Phoenix<br>  The history of Phoenix as a city begins with Jack Swilling, an American Civi|`|fMEypXDYaa	It's a bird that burns up, then comes back to life.|`|lPNP9bt2aa	it is a wild bird like eagle that according  to the myth it can reborn from its ashes<br>  <br>  also it is the symbol of the scorpion zodiac sign|`|FzFSzilmaa	it is in arizona... :D|`|CURyGQZ8aa	its usually warm there|`|XzAD49iraa	its hot in the summer :)|`|cTAXAC1saa	Hi ,<br>  <br>  I always use this site when i have to know something<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Ar...</a><br>  <br>  Its really helpful try it!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|qF4S56THaa	it starts with phoe and ends with nix. <br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090224163301AAnFi56&r=w">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|xIx9Qskyaa	Erm wot you wnt to no??<br>  <br>  the place??<br>  <br>  thers a bar near were i live called th pheonix!!|`|FsttwYe3aa	its really hot during the summer and a lot of people have pools

Just one of those things that happens when we really don't want to hurt someone's feeling.<br>  <br>  He has a gf, obviously and rightfully he spend more time with her than his friends. gf is a level higher than friends, thats how it is<br>  <br>  you cannot expect things to be the same between you both.<br>  <br>  You got a bf, you too should focus on him.<br>  <br>  <br>  Let this friend of yours be. You've put it out there that you still wants his friendship, its up to him.<br>  <br>  One thing I;ve learn is that friendship can't be forced, and there is such thing as over-doing things. When a person doesn't want to talk to us, the more we keep trying the more in encourage them to hate us and ignore us.<br>  <br>  I've done it before, and it really sucks being ignore by someone we see as a close friend, so don't do that to yourself. <br>  <br>  <br>  Bottom line is, we all make mistakes, sometimes we mess up a friendship, and that's that. Its not always possible to fix things. The more you try, the more you'll damage it. Just hope that particular friend will forgive you and talk to you again some day... like what I'm doing now.|`|AA11659117	You need to give him time.... once he calms down then try again.

What I keep wondering the most is, why these girls are not worried about if their webcam seen by any of known person or relative or parent by chance, then what happens. Even if you are a pros. you wud not like to display sexual pose to your friends or parents or relative, of course they also have this much ethics. There are so many of them and i think there is some trick behind it which we are not aware of.|`|nFQR8VyNaa	yea i seen that almost a year ago on youtube too. i think its pretty bad that all that is out there at easy access for kids and how women like that can actually degrade themselves by whoring themselves out.

If you live with-in 10, 15 minutes of each other, at least 3 times for me.........I mean it wont be the same each week. Maybe one week it is once, another might be 5. In the end, if you are interested in someone seriously, you should be wanting to see them a lot, that is not needy, thats the point of a relationship, to spend time with them!|`|4DDSD9Syaa	It all depends. If you have a great time together I would like to spend more time together. You have to evaluate your relationship. What kind of relationship are you in? Long term? Short term? Booty call? Possible marriage? Then go from there. Sometimes if you would want more then for some reasons guys think you are "needy". I hate that word.|`|wrhG6b1laa	Are you in HS. high School?

All that starts fast, ends fast. Make him miss u a little:-)|`|8AcRi4CPaa	depends how long you have been dating or if he is has commitment phobia..
6b8cbbdcbfb34ad6e49d598a03f113a0aa	Long-distance relationships are not for the faint of heart. Sure, the beginnings of love feel like hearts and giggles and imaginings of what’s to come, but what about the lagging times in the middle when you’re physically apart, and love and admiration start to wage a private war against life-sized fears and doubt? Is this relationship worth it? Are you fooling yourself? Does this person really like me? Do we have what it takes to survive this?<br>  <br>  Take a break from those self-defeating thoughts for a moment and consider this: it’s perfectly natural to feel doubt and fear in the lulls of a long-distance relationship. You need reassurance that your strong feelings of love and admiration are reciprocated. So what do you do? How do you cope with a long-distance relationship? <br>  <br>  Buck traditional notions of relationships - Realize that there are no "regular" relationships— local and not so local. It’s a hard shift to make for many people, but think about it this way - Today it is estimated that approximately nearly 4 million singles (and 3 million married couples) are currently in long-distance romantic relationships worldwide, and that figure is growing. So, just think you’re not alone.<br>  <br>  Additionally, long-distance relationships offer one advantage over local ones: they pose a chance to build a relationship more slowly. Getting to know the right person incrementally over time can forge a strong and powerful union. Still, you still want to take your time and get to know your partner on a very deep level to assess where you’d like to take the relationship. Because of the distance, you have less face time and shared experiences than more local relationships to be able to make that determination right away—so take your time!<br>  <br>  Accept uncertainty and combat it with activity - Most uncertainty in a long-distance relationship comes from having intense feelings of intimacy and connection followed by equally intense feelings of having to stand on your own - separation anxiety can also come with local relationships, too. The rules of long-distance and local relationships are same, except insecurities are magnified. <br>  <br>  The most important step you can take when feeling frustrated is to make a conscious effort to not put your life on hold—do the things that you like to do and pursue interests that you've always wanted to develop. It can be hard for the mind to reconcile being with someone and still "feeling single" simultaneously, doesn’t mean you should internalize your insecurities and cut yourself off from the outside world. The more you isolate yourself, the more your insecurities will rise about the other person’s feelings for you. <br>  <br>  Keep yourself busy with friends, family and loved ones, and continually nurture your social ties - Join a writers’ group or take a class in something, join a gym and start taking group classes, or join a hiking group—find something you like to do and jump in. <br>  <br>  Communicate Your Expectations - Make sure you’re on the same page with your partner by communicating your expectations about the relationship and by fully understanding theirs. <br>  <br>  Keep on keeping on - Every relationship, whether local or long-distance, is unique. There are three things that make for a happy, healthy and stable relationship: Personal independence and growth, mutual commitment and great communication—even through the tough times! Distance can seem overwhelming sometimes, but a love that lasts a lifetime may be well worth the risk. Where there is mutual will, love will always find a way. GoodLuck>r|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Hands down long distance relationships rarely last. People want someone they can see and hold in their life.|`|WsO0ixofaa	chill,<br>   i dont think he sits around at home all day or in front of his computer.<br>  He has a life.|`|czdCtTvWaa	Why so worried...

OzeUfwykaa	well i don't know this guy but i would guess that he is Trying to Flirt with you and saying he has broken up with his girlfriend because he wants you to know that he is single.<br>  <br>  He wants to see if you feel the same about him as he does about you. If you don't like him tell him that directly but do not like yell it in his face try a more private place.|`|JbWGwAFXaa	Okay well theres nothing wrong with him except that he fancies the pants off you. Poking is his form of flirting, playfull way to touch you. Hoping you'll respond by maybe playfully getting angry with him or poking him back!!! He told you he broke up with his girlfriend because he wants you to know hes single. He would be upset if you told him to stop, its hurt his feelings. Try having a little flirty fun with him, its just a laugh!!!|`|St6Jvc3Daa	sounds like he likes you.
NqbBjS0raa	You made him part of your party and let him know they all knew about what the texting was typed in between you two... He no longer felt it was a call between you and him. It was shared and he felt conspicuous with all knowing friends.....|`|3xoEFFOKaa	just leave him alone megs i see u at school with him and u rn't good friends because one he's a pervert and he smokes! he's a bad friend!<br>  just dont talk to him any more and u'll be fine! and he probably hates <br>  u because when u told me to call him on ur cell he picked up and said ur a pervert go 2 h*ll LEAVE HIM ALONE DONT TALK TO HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!
HMhUKAgkaa	If she told people about it, then she had a good time. Obviously if she accepted another date then she likes you! If she smiles a lot during the date and lets you hold her hand or something along those lines then she definitely enjoys your company. Good luck on date #2|`|EEapXFJ2aa	ure asking ths agan fr the second tymm.. ur obsessd wit the gal

AcmfbJVpaa	I think I hang around people that Im comfortable with- why hang around anyone that is going to make you feel bad|`|H6ErlcL1aa	Men often accuse women of nagging, just to get them off their back, and give them a cause for guilt... <br>  <br>  But, hey, often we have to repeatedly ask men not to do certain things, because they actually need it. Such as: 'don't shoot the crossbow inside,' or, 'don't let your friends come over if they're going to break the windows and spray things on the walls'. You'd think it was common sense, but it's often not for men, and in that case it's not nagging. It's a necessary and reasonable request.<br>  <br>  If you have a woman who actually, genuinely, seriously, does nag you, repeatedly, then I have no explanation for that. It's just her personality.|`|4UAZ6O2Daa	It's the only way they can express how they feel (& yes, sometimes it does make you love them more).<br>  <br>  This used to happen to my Girlfriend, she always used to be treated unfairly wherever she was (pretending to be friends with her when they were really trying to ruin her reputation & make her look like a bad person). Even the place she used to live at before, the people treated her like some sort of prisoner.<br>  <br>  At least now that we're together, things have finally been working out for the better.

6EsUGkg5aa	She's just mad man, don't let it concern you too much, she's probably being over dramatic but a lot of girls AND guys can be, it's natural.<br>  Give her the space and time she requires, and periodically ask her how she's feeling and keep seeking her forgiveness if you feel you did do something wrong. <br>  Sooner or later she will crack and forgive you or become as friendly with you once again, if it was no big deal it's nothing to worry about.<br>  Some girls take there men back after they've been cheated on, lied to, and beaten to death, so I think you stand a pretty good shot at redemption.<br>  Best of luck mate.|`|0i80jUKeaa	Then forget about her and find a girl who actually wants you.

lGByR3lcaa	Well, if you're seeing her *outside* the club and not paying for sex, then yes, I would feel that it's true. I've definitely been interested in guys that I've met at my work. It depends though, strippers see the worst in men, so it's hard for a lot of us to really trust guys. Take your time and see.|`|gzBk5NMVaa	Be and show what really you are.|`|5fSXHdeBaa	I personally think its fine if you really do love her...... Make sure you don't do anything stupid.|`|uvAjFW8Yaa	Sounds real to me just that you both have issues to work out.<br>  Maybe you guys are going to learn from each other.<br>  Only you know what is right and wrong for you.<br>  Go with it for now but keep reassessing your relationship with her.  If it starts feeling bad or wrong just ask yourself what you need and maybe you will then meet someone who is better for you.<br>  Or she may turn out to be exactly what you need but you both need to help each other and things will grow into a really great relationship.<br>  Trust your 'gut instinct' and enjoy being with her - life is for living not being plagued with doubts or guilt.<br>  Good luck|`|XoOanmdraa	if something is too good to be true then it probably isnt|`|NZg4hIrYaa	i wanna say how lucky you are to fall in love with a stripper, but your story sounds like a romantic movie more than a real one.

We do the same things we have the same personality and we have the same fashion sense. I enjoy it because I can talk to her and we are almost the same age I am 16 and she is 15. But my cousin is cool with it, I think he enjoys it because he sees that we get along well and there wont be any fighting.

AA11647373	Without pain, how do we know we are alive?<br>  Yes, indeed I have both heard and felt the damage of a broken heart. Once you've felt it, it is'nt so bad. The first is always the worst. <br>  But I agree with some of the answers above, once you have been burned don't go back and touch the oven again.<br>  I am compassionate toward you, I have walked in your shoes, and to be in that place is not fun, but It will get better.|`|n2gEupY9aa	my heart is also broken but its been 6months.<br>  you know what to do?<br>  go out with your friends and meet other people,<br>  in that way you will somehow forget the pain.<br>  before you sleep you think of everything that caused you in pain,<br>  do it every night until one day you will realize that you just don't want to think it anymore.<br>  and also make sure that everytime you want to cry, just cry..|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I have had two broken hearts in my life and I feel bad for anyone that has to go through this.

But the thing is (I don't mean to sound impertinent) but if it's over, it's over. Shake it off, grab a Snickers bar and confidently go out there and find someone new.

YQ8YsYepaa	I think for one you have too much time on your hands. NOw ,  your ideas are very expensive, unless your SEC is upper crust you're going to be in debt before you say "I DO". However, since this is just pretend....<br>  <br>  Drop the rye , add a plain roll<br>  Those soups are too much. Simplify it , you don't want to make your guest uncomfortable.<br>  The salads are fine, I agree with above poster to take one out and add a simple green salad.<br>  You want a riot??  Offer a meat entree.  Lemon chicken would fit in well with the rest of the menu. Most ppl will eat chicken.<br>  Add a simple side as well.  just good ole green beans or something, roasted potatoes maybe. <br>  The desserts all sound delish. Who cares if they wont eat it more for you.<br>  <br>  Now , i have to wonder what economic and social cross section your guests will be from. Even upper crusts want meat and potatoes. Unless your entire guest list will be vegan, in which case go for it. For the record,  Im vegan and i wouldnt eat half of what was on the menu .<br>  <br>  *** ROFL  no that quiche is NOT a "meat option" . Don't be absurd. Meat comes from an animal,  most ppl really enjoy cows and chickens and pigs.  Offer chicken or warn your guests before they arrive that the menu is vegetarian/vegan. My boyfriend is NOT a vegetarian and would be infuriated if I didn't let him know a head of time so he could grab a burger. Then he would sip on a cup of tea during the dinner and maybe have a roll.|`|hkwBR1moaa	Here's my opinion:<br>  Don't have the guests choose one bread.  Put baskets of bread on the table with an assortment.  <br>  Soups- they're all vegitarian.  Can you include a meat or seafood one?<br>  Salads- they sound fine<br>  Main- What is a California Roll and again, is all this vegetarian?  Not everyone is a vegetarian, I am certainly not one.  <br>  Sides- only the eggplant sounds good to me.  <br>  Dessert- I wouldn't eat any of the desserts.  <br>  and I hope you have other beverages other than teas, because I would be thirsty.  I'm not a tea fan.|`|76nTvO4iaa	If I were a guest at your wedding, I would politely push my food around on my plate and stop for something to eat on my way home.<br>  <br>  If my husband was in a diplomatic mood, he would do the same.  If he was being a curmudgeon that day, we would have an unexpected emergency and leave before dessert was served, if we stayed that long.  NO WAY would he come to your reception the following day.|`|4POGapREaa	All of it sounds great but your "main dishes" sound like appetizers.  Mini quiche is not a main dish, neither are mushroom caps, and california rolls are bite size too.  You need something more substantial.<br>  <br>  How about a vegetarian lasagna or canneloni with a basil cream sauce?|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	take into consideration that not all your guests will likely be vegetarians, and that some people will want meat.  one tiny option with meat wont satisfy everyone|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	it sounds very elegant and certainly different from what you'd typically have at a wedding.  and you know your guests...are they into this type of cuisine?  if they're familiar with these dishes and used to eating this way, it sounds great.  however, if it runs more to specifically your taste, you might want to rethink it.  you really do need to consider your guests.  will they look at everything and go 'yum'?  or will they look at the choices and go 'what the h*ll IS that???'<br>  <br>  i would find it interesting, myself, but my mom & my husband wouldn't have much to eat at a selection like that.|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	Personally, I think it's too busy: too many choices in every category.  It would be very difficult for the serving staff to manage, difficult to estimate appropriate amounts and would take a considerable amount of time to serve.  If you really have to have all of these choices, go buffet rather than served.<br>  <br>  I'm a relatively adventurous eater, but there are many things on your menu I either don't understand or simply wouldn't eat.  If it were my family at this event, most of them wouldn't eat any of it except the bread.  Perhaps all of your guests are gastronomes, but if not, you should consider your guests' tastes.  It's not about dazzling people with gourmet frooffiness, it's about feeding people a good meal.<br>  <br>  Put various types of bread in a basket on the tables, offer a more mainstream soup option (and no more than two), and Asian salad only.  I wouldn't eat any of the entree options.  The sides are too many choices.  You have essentially two slaws, and two spicy dishes: eliminate one of each.  I wouldn't eat any of those desserts: ingredient combinations are strange or unidentifiable, and who eats rum raisin pie?  The tea selections are mostly okay, but you need a more mainstream choice for the entree course.<br>  <br>  Frankly, despite all the food available, I'd probably go home hungry.|`|AA11380378	Are YOUR guests vegetarian????<br>  <br>  When HOSTING and event, you should consider your guests preferences, not only yours.<br>  <br>  Secondly, SOUPS and evening gowns do not mix. The soup variety is also not very appetizing. Soups are messy. Skip them.<br>  <br>  Everything else sounds good. I 'll definetly eat all of it <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA12004844	I'd prefer a rosemary asiago bread; add a creamy soup like cream of broccoli; LOVE the mini asparagus quiche idea; sides - prefer the slaw and tricolor pasta - HATE the dessert choices.  have a cake or maybe a flan or creme brulee<br>  <br>  it's gonna be costly|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	To be perfectly honest, I am not a picky eater but nothing on your menu is appetizing to me. However the tea menu sounds great.<br>  <br>  Edit: Unless the quiche has bacon or sausage in it, it is not a meat option.|`|frA6KJwIaa	most of it sounds nasty, except for the greek salad, and i don't know what half of it is.|`|RKsn5dD4aa	I dont like your soups.|`|6b6ff719959d29a5aa770465d592c901aa	Way too many choices - cost will be crazy high. A caterer has to bring enough food to meet most needs so the will bring usually about 75% of load for each choice - that means if you have 100 guest and  salad choices they will bring 75 of each choice - so you will pay for 375 salads. Cut your choices or make them "buildables" (salad w same base ingerdients, different toppings). Also need to nclude more "mainstream" selections.\<br>  Have fun planning|`|LxvA4vGpaa	Well....I can see why your not actually getting married.<br>  <br>  I am sorry, but someone that plans a wedding without being engaged is sad.  It really sends out the message that all you care about is having this big huge expensive wedding and not about what the day is really about-marrying your best friend.  No man in his right mind would marry a girl that already has her wedding planned out before even being engaged.  Unless of course he was just looking for a "starter wife" or a "trophy wife" to tote around on his arm to fancy functions but be banging his secretary on the side.  <br>  <br>  As for your menu.....wow.  About 98% of it sounds absolutely disgusting.  Shorten it up, offer less choices and include meat.  just because you are vegan doesn't mean the rest of the world is.  Think about someone OTHER THAN YOURSELF for a change.|`|qSvOxfw1aa	I initially thought about leaving off the soup, but if the reception is the next day, guests will not be as dressed up, so I suppose it is fine. Are you planning a full staff of servers to take orders and deliver food. Generally, it is easier if you do more of a self serve set up. Or if you want them to be served, you should limit the choices to 2 per course.|`|1HbCWbVjaa	Wow based on that menu, I would actually eat before the reception to avoid being hungry during it! None of the breads appeal to me. None of the soups appeal to me. None of the main dishes appeal to me. I might try the sesame purple coleslaw or sweet and sour tricolor pasta salad. I would definitely drink the tea but pass on the desse|`|osLBdz31aa	honestly, they all sound delicious but you might want to put one familiar plate on the choices for those that are not so adventurous.<br>  <br>  bread: add just a plain roll or cornbread<br>  soup: classic chicken soup or maybe a cream soup<br>  salad: again just a classic side salad<br>  <br>  the entrees look good but again...try and add something familiar.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|IWWZdZRpaa	I don't think you let your guests have full choice, WAY too much work for any caterer.  I think you narrow the choices down for them.<br>  Other than that it's not simple enough.  You need some type of traditional options for older guests and picky eaters|`|8quTABk6aa	Is there a reason for the almost vegetarian menu?  Do you have a number of people coming whole like a more traditional offering? <br>  <br>  Also, people DRINK at weddings.  Sometimes heavier foods are better.|`|AA10918706	Just because you're a vegetarian doesn't mean your guest are.  You may want to put that on the menu - so the guests won't expect a hardy meal.  <br>  <br>  It sound like a spa dinner - not a wedding.|`|o14LmTx0aa	Sounds like you'd better be marrying a millionaire.|`|pfjxEZBmaa	Good luck affording it. lol. <br>  Sounds good, but really expensive.|`|y5iJ50nxaa	good|`|AYH0RPsjaa	LOL,  not getting married and spent all that time thinking about food you will never eat, whoa!  <br>  I have a theory why you are not getting married!!  Do you always spend that much time obsessing over food!  <br>  Who cares what gets served at a wedding as long as you look like a model in the dress.  That is all people talk/care about and the booze.|`|KqQlWbYsaa	I think, frankly, that unless you have reason to know or think that the majority of your guests desire or likely prefer a solely vegetarian menu, it is extremely selfish and exercising poor judgment on your part to insist on making the menu solely vegetarian.<br>  <br>  While I believe that I personally would find the mushroom caps stuffed with saffron fruited kasha/miniature asparagus quiches selection somewhat appetizing (even as an entree), what I propose is this:  Offer a fish or chicken entree choice to any and all invitees.<br>  <br>  The salad selection is absurd:  Best to have one simple mixed salad, but offer as an alternative to all guests the same single salad but with no dressing.<br>  <br>  As  for dessert, all of that sounds just fine, but I recommend that if you are doing a selection (as is apparently the case), you do the same as part of Viennese tables (In case you are unfamiliar with the same, they are tables on wheels pushed out towards the end of the reception (and from which guests, upon getting up and going over to the same, select what they desire in person (and of course return to their respective tables).|`|Pwybznsxaa	Honestly, i'd make a quick exit and hit the nearest Applebee's. Your menu is not appealing. Can you add some more normal/mainstream foods-cornbread, chicken soup like someone else suggested. For dessert, maybe add cookies or a traditional pie/cobbler.<br>  <br>  Also, if you don't know if everyone is vegeterian, i would suggest adding another variety of meat. I would add another type drink-lemonade, soda, water, or wedding punch. <br>  <br>  Seriously, please consider your guests and marjority of people will not eat that stuff!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: I just realized you wrote you are not getting married. May I ask why you have such a....a...not so tasty complicated menu already!!

9kMJJ1giaa	You have got yourself into a very bad position.  My heart truly goes out to you.    Unfortunately no one has the right answer for you.  Only you can make the right decision for you. <br>  Since you have suffered from depression and even been suicidal in the past, no one can know what having an abortion will do to your emotions.<br>  If you go through with an abortion, you have to feel you are making the very best choice.  Then you have to always remember that, and not allow it to sadden you in the future.  If you can not do that, maybe abortion is not for you.<br>  You could have the baby and allow some one to adopt the baby.  This would take a lot of courage.  It might be a little easier to deal with emotionally than abortion though.<br>  You don't say why you feel you can't have this baby.  It might be because of your age, finances, emotions, depression, but it does not matter.  If you can't, you can't.  Realizing that is better than having a baby and the abusing it because you didn't want it.<br>  Abortion, or adoption are your only answers now.  Adoption does not have to be with strangers, if that bothers you.  You could find someone you know to give the baby to.<br>  It is really sad knowing you never knew the love of either of your parents.  You really need to talk to someone, maybe who ever raised you, an aunt, cousin or just a good friend.  You could use some professional help too.  It can't hurt.  <br>  You are not a bad person for asking questions.  Good luck to you, and I'm sorry no one can answer your question for you.  You have to really think about everything and make up your own mind.<br>  I would take your baby and raise it for you in a heart beat.  My son was killed in a car accident, and I can not have any more children.<br>  It seems so unfair!|`|htWw0OlCaa	Well, Im not for abortion, but I can understand your situation. In some cases yes abortion can kill you if the procedure is not done right. That's why you need to make sure you go to an abortion clinic where there are professionals. I cant say what it will do to you mentally, I know it will be a hard thing to get over, but you do have other options. You can have the baby and give it a chance at life, and give it to a couple that really wants a baby. Your in a tough situation, and I feel for you, but this is your decision. Best wishes|`|IyEJfHGSaa	Awhh... Gal... U really need to confide urself in someone close to u.. Whom u can pour out ur feelings to..<br>  U really need to be strong..<br>  There are side effects after abortion and 1 of them is Depression..<br>  U've suffered enough already..<br>  Think carefully gal on ur decision...<br>  If not try and talk to a counsellor..<br>  Be strong ya and take care!!|`|yRAU9MJDaa	Kill your baby and you may be more suicidal.  Do you want that?|`|QZHMckOhaa	i am very pro-choice and think it should be completely up to the couple, but mainly the woman as it is her who has to endure pregnancy - if you don't feel that you can have this baby, then don't go through with it as doing so will change your whole life. however if you think that the abortion will scar you too badly emotionally and mentally then maybe you could consider other options like adoption? if you do decide to get an abortion, it would be good to go over this with a regular psychologist who you see before AND after this to ensure that you don't relapse into depression|`|immI2N4Uaa	It's your own choice, dear.<br>  The morally right thing to do is not to abort your child.<br>  If you abort your child then it's like committing murder and that would add up to your sins.<br>  Everything has a purpose, dear. This event could be something Big that's happening into your life.<br>  And abortion doesn't kill when it is done properly.<br>  Others die because of the drug they take. (Overdose)<br>  So my best advice for you is NOT to abort it.<br>  Talk it over with your bf and if he says he'll take responsibility for it then that would be a great start.<br>  But if he says he won't then...sorry to say this... but I don't think he loves you that much.<br>  If he really loves you then he would want what's good for you and for this child of yours.<br>  Why don't you watch "JUNO", starring Ellen Page?<br>  That baby inside of you has FINGERNAILS!!! :)<br>  God Bless You, dear.|`|0K3EBX2Daa	Okay.  Well you need to think about whats best for yourself. If keeping this baby means your unhappy then, abortion is the best thing to do. You may decide now that you want to keep the baby but in the long run will it be the best decision you made?<br>  I know your thinking about what happened to your mum but this may not be the same when it comes to you.
CUB3wUdiaa	well as a former navy guy i can say this with experience.  its not always easy to communicate.  give the guy some time and be patient.  i know its easier said than done but do your best.  if hes not man enough to tell you to stop talking to him then hes an idiot and you deserve better.  so just give him some time and let whatever happens happen. <br>  <br>  ray|`|xIx9Qskyaa	well th letters probably not there yet!!<br>  jus hang in ther nd itl all come together :)<br>  jus keep writin nd txtin nd then see him wen he gets bk!!<br>  <br>  gd luk|`|ezpyN8pgaa	people who join the navy are mostly gay .. so he probably found some other dude in the NAVY im sorry for you!|`|gdaimMuoaa	he is de@d or he is getting sick of Y-O-U!!!!! stop Writing him!!!!!!!|`|FzFSzilmaa	maybe he just hasn't had time or for security reasons he couldn't write...<br>  <br>  send the pic and make is sexy (or topless)... :D<br>  <br>  if there was something wrong, he'd cut all communications...

He's probabley thinking about her . And what he's going to say to her . <br>  <br>  #3- shocked , he would wonder how can she like a guy like him even if he's not all that good looking . <br>  <br>  #4 - yes , if he finds that he's not that good enough for a good looking girl like her .|`|0AYPgUQIaa	Let me answer all of those at once: no matter how you look if you believe in yourself and you are confident. There are a lot of good looking guys out there who can't accept that they are handsome and they keep telling themselves that they are ugly. That mood sits right on their face and who would want to date a depressed and dim guy?<br>  And the circle is closed up, now the guy's fears seem justified.<br>  <br>  If someone thinks that he is less valuable than an other person, then others will believe this too.|`|w1ZAQXvkaa	I dated a not so good looking guy who was really nice and funny and we clicked so well, but i felt bad whenever i heard ppl say "how can a guy like tht get a girl like her" it really pissed me off.

(unless u only care about what others think)<br>  and to answer ur questions:<br>  1) I asked him, and was the first to kiss him too.<br>  2) He told me that he was shocked and incredibly happy.<br>  3) He doubted himself at first, but got over it when i showed him i truly liked him.<br>  4) He might, but he also might be more devoted to keeping her.|`|65s5XVVhaa	1- doesn't really matter <br>  2-more confidence and he's thankful<br>  3-normal i think <br>  4-why ? everything depens on looking ?!!

It hardly seems worth the risk if you are not keen on him, and would just go for a bit of a laff.|`|RFeYz59maa	When you go to his place don't sit too close to him or stare at him, and if he tries to kiss you or hold your hand let him know right then and there that you don't think that's  a good idea.

Even those that do don't usually see the point. More often than not, it's a spur of the moment thing. They don't plan it out, they're just with someone, and something happens. Human's are very weak willed creatures. We bend to our slightest whims, rather than resist. If you truly love someone, you won't cheat on them. Sometimes though, accidents happen. To err is human, to forgive is devine they say. Doesn't lessen the pain though. And contrary to your thought, most people break up because things aren't working out, they aren't happy with that person. The unfortunate thing with that is that what usually makes them realize that they aren't happy with that person is when they find someone they are happy with. I had a friend who got drunk and cheated on her boyfriend. They stayed together, but to get his revenge, he went out and got a ******* from some random girl. None of it makes sense.<br>  <br>  But I'm straying from your question. The truth is, cheating is bad, and if you truly love someone, you wouldn't cheat on them. My suggestion, as hard as this might be, is to try to hold off on loving them, and saying you love them, until you are sure that those feelings are true. Find someone who is really right for you, and you won't have to worry about cheating again.|`|H7cNZYIYaa	because THOSE people are *** holes|`|AA10797214	I understand but too well, having a mate that does  not have  your best interest at heart, is always looking to inflict a stab of some kind or another, is not an easy way of living.

d89416ed0e27a36978e0ba1cb1b5608eaa	Well firstly, she's an idiot for giving it up at 15. <br>  Secondly, changing your number or disappearing - seriously? Get a grip. <br>  Thirdly, she tells you she likes you then gets back with her ex - anyone else see a problem here? <br>  <br>  Lay it all on the table tell - her how you feel and see what she says. The worst than can happen is she'll reject you and that's called LIFE. You'll get over it and move on. Grow up and deal with it like a man. Then she might have some respect for you. <br>  <br>  Riley.|`|m4geUBLTaa	aww youre a cute((:<br>  id date you.<br>  but dont ever give up.<br>  or give in<br>  stay strong, sometimes life throws some major<br>  obstacles and you just gotta get passes them,<br>  i know you can, maybe shes nervous since shes<br>  been through a lot. dont change your number<br>  stay friends with her. remember with time and God<br>  all things are possible. and im always here to help<br>  ive been through just about every bad situation relationship<br>  and situation and im always here to offer my advice.<br>  dont hesitate to email me for more advice<br>  taekwondochick20010@yahoo.com<br>  goodluck, and remember<br>  <br>  this too shall pass.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	omg you look like my cousin....o well i am sorry that this girl is playing games. she must be confuse. i met the best guy last summer and i fell in love but i had to let him go because my ex kept threatening me into going back with him. maybe that guy made her go back with him and she is afraid to be with you|`|y3eY9x0kaa	email me, you need serious advice.. <br>  emmasmtih@yahoo.com .. its spelled like that.|`|AA11103363	Hi!<br>  <br>  First of all, those her parents and relatives know that her bf hits her? Better yet, do they know she has a bf?<br>  <br>  I mean, it seems to me, she is somewhat young for a "serious" relationship. Especially in a relationship where she is being physically (and mentally) hurt. <br>  <br>  I cannot say you are better for her, since I do not know either of you. And I cannot say that your feelings for her are real, and not simply infatuation, for again, I do not know you.<br>  <br>  However, after all you have said, I this much I can say: you need to forget about her. Obviously she is not mentally, emotionally prepared to be in a serious relationship, not with you or with anyone else. <br>  <br>  This said, I think, that if you really care about her and her well being, you should stick around, and speak to her. If need be, maybe even organize an intervention, because she needs to stay away from this bf of hers.<br>  <br>  As I said b4, it is not healthy for her to be in that relationship.<br>  <br>  Maybe you can start by seeking advise and help from her sister.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|XI7JLX6gaa	reading this made me smile and think how its sweet of u to care so much as u do. but sometimes girls can be stubborn and hard headed and tend to learn on their own. dont put so much pressure on her as in telling her she deserves better and what u can give her.<br>  im sure she knows. but im also sure she has a feeling that this guy can change. maybe on a 50/50 note hell change for better or bad.<br>  just continue to be there for her. hear out her problems she has for him and try to help them out even tho u think/know the relationship isnt well.<br>  she'll seee how thru out what happen between the situation youll still be there for her itll show her alot. and hopefully she see that your the one she may see her self with and not him.<br>  so dont go "casper the friendly ghost" on her,<br>  just be by her side and wait it out. give it time. <br>  IF it doesnt work youll know you tried and how things could have been.<br>  and find some1 whos willing to take u for u are and who you both deserve.|`|fgxF53EEaa	no no no dont do that... i cant beleive she would go out with that guy! i know i wouldnt! .if she is dumb enough to loose her virginity at 15-to a guy who abuses her,  and then decides to play around with your feelings like that, then she's not worth it. beleive me, she is NOT worth it!|`|wjww3fUqaa	No stick around dnt shove it in her face. Just vibe and go with the flow. If you show a woman you like her more than she likes you it gets really annoying to her. So just stick around and just be yourself. Trust me she will come around.|`|nx8HcFDiaa	just please listen to the song i cant help but wait by trey songz <br>  you will cry because thats what your situation sounds like lol <br>  :( sorry|`|aZ1ZxTNvaa	no don't do that <br>  stick around<br>  if she likes you <br>  and u like her<br>  then work hard to get her<br>  if its ment to be<br>  then u will get her|`|nmF5L5oVaa	You should try to move on--->as hard as that is and I am sure seems impossible for you to do since I can tell by what you wrote you are someone with a very sincere, honest, open and loving heart.  Try to focus on other things and people and down the road if meant to be things have a way of working themselves out.  The more attention you pay to this girl the more she will keep doing this to you.  Go find someone that will appreciate and adore how wonderful you truly are.  You are a hands down-no-contest-good looking guy with lots of love to share, just make sure you share it with the right person.<br>  <br>  good luck! ***
4I9ByZcCaa	THATS ******* DISGUSTING in my opinion im sorry but i find it weird if a 17-18 yr old loves a 14 yr old but that i can get past by but not someone 10 years older than you|`|ddbVXDgAaa	yes that is weird|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Yes it's quite weird. It's also not legal for him. Forget the guy and find someone your own age.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Weird - no.<br>  <br>  Dangerous - yes.<br>  there is a 9 year age gap - which at 14 is enormous.<br>  <br>  Now, if you were 22 and he 31, things would be different.<br>  So, i suggest you wait until you are at least 18 - before you take this beyond being 'just friends'|`|YtSGbYqEaa	thats kinda sick your still a kid and hes a grown man he needs to find someone closer to his age be careful with guys older than you|`|d7jd7GYjaa	Yeah its weird. Plus its not legal. Most of the time 23 yr olds are trying to get into your pants.|`|6iR7Mvc5aa	If you are a girl then it's okay|`|KvFdtTsPaa	To be honest, It's not "wierd" it's just not right.<br>  If you are 14 you are not legal. If you were 16 then this would be a different story.<br>  If anything was to happen between both of you then it would be ilegall.<br>  When I was 16 I was with a 29 year old!! Even worse but hey we all make mistakes!<br>  Be carefull anyway what ever you do... :) x|`|bf3841c34a53ac959383bd2e8e91607eaa	um yeah ...can you say that he may go to jail if y'all do anything. You would not get any punishment, but he may be sentenced to jail and be put on a sex offender list! Which is just pure embarrassment! Please stop before its toooo late, because trust me someone will find out!|`|yqML5oruaa	Well love does matter, jail does, he just wants to smurf you so smurfn hard you are sore all next month. He doesnt love you, he loves your unpopped cherry and thats ALL, so **** him all ready and get it done with|`|pVaZty4Maa	no not weird bc it happens all the timebutits not good, he could get into alot of trouble and do jail time if something was to happen, so go out with your friends and look for a cute boy your age okay sweetie|`|r7GMWkPraa	yes, and he's probably a social retard who can't talk to girls his own age.|`|5acf40d2aa61e65eff15834add1f7bd5aa	uhh....yeah......
AA12044809	I don't know about you, but I think guys should always pay for the date. I'd ask him a question like, 'How about you taking me out for some of that slippery spaghetti...the kind you have to suck on with your lips to get it down...' and then see what he says.  And if he says he doesn't like spaghettit then he's not a very exciting kind of guy and you can go on to your next conquest.  Remember, nothing ventured, nothing gained.|`|Or1FSQxKaa	Tell him, I like you, wanna go for a drink?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Age4AUPEOq4LeQ7xxRr3itDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225060500AAmGv4p">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ze4Gt1araa	I'll say "hey, well I wanna tell you that I like you and I want you to be my baby" that's cute of just say "hey wanna be my boyfriend?" But I think that's too directly though. And yeah go for it, fight for what you want! :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Chances are, he like you too. Someone has to make the first move so go for it and just ask him. He may be shy and scared to ask you thinking you may say no and men don't like rejection. Just ask him and you will be happy that you did.
903aae0cc88e1ea841a0eea86ff92767aa	obvs he wants to talk, strike up a convo and talk!|`|Ju57sA1iaa	she may be right. ^^^^up there^^^^ but then again, it's just a text. but you can send him a message back the start a convo the things get better..
HSvfjIrRaa	Not sure how to answer that. What do i like having DONE to me most??? Hmmmmm wild guess. Kiss on the ear, neck, face, belly, ummmm..... LOL <br>  <br>  Seriously though if you mean you want to take her somewhere different why not go sphereing, you both get in this big ball and get rolled down a huge hill, its great fun if you are a thrill seeker or if she loves to laugh like me she'll love it.<br>  <br>  Otherwise plan a night in and read her a raunchy novel over some nice food and wine! Best surprises are the ones you never expected.<br>  <br>  P.s. You kissing, sucking and lightly biting her ear will make her cry out how much she loves you. It is a serious erogenous zone. SERIOUS!|`|jROpVbrhaa	Go down there.... lol|`|d049114526acfea778c9104d0ebfec07aa	Buying jewelerry...

He told you he loves someone else and he reminds you all the time he doesn't love you. Why do you think he is trying to make you jealous? He could just be living his life and you are reading too much into his actions.<br>  <br>  MOVE ON, HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU!! PLus, why would you want a d*ck for a boyfriend anyway?!

To make your choice on your terms in your time is best.  Don't rush.  But remember this very important point.  Looks are not everything.  It's how the young man treats you.  A "pretty" boys looks can change, but a good and honest loving heart is usually steady.   It's always great if you can pair the 2, but if not, look on the inside first.|`|ARmhMq5laa	you're young don't worry about that stuff,don't go looking...focus on school and yourself,it'll happen on it's on.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	You have your whole life in front of you.

e67e5dfc74c396a718533bd7b4a5f8fbaa	i would be interested in knowing if the children are all from the same woman here? as 3 are a lot to get in ,in 5 years, and for some one who says they have no confidence you must have quite a bit, to of fathered 3 children!.<br>  I think if i just met you,liked you and you told me you had 3 children by the same woman, i would have alarm bells ringing,but i would be less suspicious than if you had 3 children by 3 different mothers, so that depends on your story really, i also think you should be honest with the woman from day 1,as if she gets to like you and then you mention all by the way i have 3 children that would be a bit of a shock and to be quite honest if more than 1 woman is involved id of disappeared before you could tell me their names.<br>  You say you need a confidence boost, i would say you need a lot of patience as anyone who gets involved in a relationship with you would have to get to know you for a long time to find out whats been happening here, if not you could always end up with someone to give you baby number 4.<br>  Seriously be honest from the onset, if she likes you and thinks you are worth it, then you will be on your way to hopefully a great relationship, you say you are far from handsome but someone must of thought you were handsome to have mothered 3 children with you, so if someone or something has knocked you back, gain confidence by thinking better of yourself and that you will find miss wright rather than doubting you will find someone who may not like your children, and baggage as you call her.<br>  If you plan on having more children in the future then you would be better off finding someone who likes children from the start anyway, as you could avoid having her introduced to your children and then find out that she could eat 3 for breakfast every morning and that wouldnt do you any good in the future with 3 young children that need to spend time with their father.<br>  Good luck and be honest its the way to most ladies hearts.<br>  And the answer to your qusetion would i date a bit of an ugly man with no confidence, with 3 children under 5 is yes i love children(not for breakfast thou)but i would have to know everything about the relationship before, and it would take time, but could be a great thing if hes HONEST.|`|claUGpVRaa	I am pregnant - my baby is due today and I have found myself very unexpectedly on my own as my ex partner abandoned me after years when he found out I was expecting. I hope to meet someone one day and to be honest I would expect that person to have children. I am mid 30's and would just expect anyone of a similar age to also have kids. If I have a child of my own and hope to find a new partner some day then I would be a hypocrite if I didn't want to date a guy who has kids already, and to be honest, I think most women would expect that so please don't worry. You will find someone one day, just concentrate on building up your own confidence and stop thinking your kids may inadvertently stop you meeting someone. They won't!  <br>  And you are right though - when you do meet someone, keep that lady away from your kids until you are sure about her. Your kids come first as mine will to me!<br>  Good luck to you|`|SyHmExgtaa	A guy with one child, sure...A guy with three children, honestly...HELL NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Not unless I was really into them before I found that out, or unless they were totally irresistable.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I would resist the urge. There are plenty of nice guys without children, so that is one major form of attachment I wouldn't want them to already have.<br>  Is a guy with three kids going to want to have four kids with me? Or are thye more likely to have had enough and not want to go through that again?<br>  That is one question that would go through my mind. Another is, I would never ever come first in his life. Ever. That too would bother me. Coming second to my own kids is fine. Coming second to kids who don't think of me as their mother.. that would hurt. What if I get his approval but not that of his kids? Should I have to get the approval four people just to date one man? And since there are plenty of people with whom that situation would not arise, what motivation would there be to put myself through it? It would be like I know the dating situation would be unfair right from the start, because obviously his kids have to come first all the time.<br>  <br>  I think it would be easiest if you found other women in the same situation as you. I think most would be far more open to and happy with the idea.|`|TdROahUnaa	He's not saying his children are baggage, he's saying in addition to his baggage, he also has three kids.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Yes, if I really liked a guy I wouldn't mind if he had three kids.

But beware that some women might be afraid to make a commitment to children if they know it might not work out and thats the reason some women shy away from such a relationship.|`|JIAo8cbtaa	Personally, if I went on a date with a guy and he did have kids, then I'd like to know whether he had kids or not.

I actually would date a man with children. As long as there isn't any "baby mama drama" and he truly is ready to move on, relationship wise, while still being the father of his children.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	You should mention it on the first date rather than get involved and then spring it on her.   I don't know if it's still in existence, you can google it, but there used to be an organization for Parents Without Partners where everyone is in the same situation. I would also look for clubs (not night clubs), organizations, adult classes anywhere where you are likely to meet women of your age and situation. You may need to see a counselor for ways to develop more self confidence. You give off a kind of aura of when you lack self confidence and that turns a lot of women away. It's akin to acting ashamed of yourself and not conducive to meeting and getting to know women. BTW You are not limited to women who have children, there are lots of women that would not find that a problem. You just need to broaden your life so there are more opportunities to meet women.

0s8EAByGaa	That means that he has fallen for you, but you must be careful what you do "with" him and around him. Don't use him, he has feelings too, and by showing interest in him and asking him to do stuff you show that you notice him. It's male instinct to do anything for a woman that he likes/loves in order to "get" her. If you like him try to go on a few friendly dates, but again, be careful.
LijKVPUYaa	Piggy is a bit screwed up huh?<br>  <br>  I guess it comes down to the fact that no matter how nice a person is it makes them feel good to talk down another.  <br>  This applies more to woman as we are more insecure and tend to feel threatened by other woman.

L37rMgnmaa	well...<br>  i will let him know what i like about him<br>  like for example:<br>  "hey..i like your shoes and how they match your shirt..thats cute..were do you get that idea...oh from me i almost forgot.lol"<br>  lols i dont know just be kindda cute and funny at the same time<br>  and just let him know wut you like about him..but not in a creepy way..be careful with that..that will sacre him.lol|`|7f1gz6JTaa	Yea,why not.Unless you don't want them to think your a sappy lovesick DUMBASS.|`|BqrQFLH5aa	darling i adore you
eceLQUj5aa	Sue him for child support. There are multiple benefits there, you will get the support you need and his "wife" will know the truth. I put "wife" in quotes because I think he is lying to you. Consider all of your options please, go talk to planned parenthood. They can give you information on all of your options, including help on raising a child as a single mother.|`|uBssj3Znaa	Wow, that is super unfortunate. <br>  <br>  Is he legally an American Citizen? Because if he is, I would start contacting the court system now to figure out what you need to do to make sure this man takes care of his responsibility. <br>  <br>  As for being friends with him ... I would tell him to f*ck off. Friends don't treat friends like he has treated you. <br>  <br>  As for getting over him ... HE IS MARRIED AND HAS ANOTHER CHILD! He is a douche bag who obviously didn't care about you, or your feelings. Time will heal all wounds, but first you need to realize what a jerk this guy is.|`|YOt4FOAKaa	Well, he's illegal so child support will not be an option.  You could always threaten to tell his supposed wife about the baby in hopes that he will take care of his responsibilities.  However, I really don't advocate that.  <br>  The best thing you could do is to contact planned parenthood, as previously stated, and start planning a life for you and your baby.  <br>  As far as having him as a friend?  He should man up, tell his wife what he has done and then, possibly you can all come to some adult decision regarding support and visitation. <br>  Hope all works out for you.|`|hkl6Zz2zaa	well that guy is a foo and dosnts desere to be in the babys life and he probly doesnt want to come back for the baby
aF7vfmfBaa	Heres a few tips..<br>  <br>  To get the guy of your dreams back, you have to convince him that he wants you (unless he really doesn't and you know that there is no hope), try:  <br>  <br>  Be absolutely sure not to act desperate. If you do, the guy will totally under-estimate you.<br>  <br>  Talk to him and remind him of some of the good times you used to have. These good memories will remind him how good you two were together. DO NOT bring up bad memories, it will only hurt the bad side of him.. which is not good. <br>  <br>  Let him know how you feel about him. (Only do this when you know he wants you.) <br>  <br>  Sometimes don't call him or text him for two days or cancel plans with him.You've got to let his mind wander. Or, don't talk to him for a couple days and if he starts the convos, you're in the game. <br>  <br>  Don't change anything for him; be yourself he will only go for the real you not a fake person. <br>  <br>  To get the guy of your dreams back, you have to convince him that he wants you <br>  <br>  Be flirty but not too flirty. <br>  <br>  Never take advice from his girlfriend because they are lies. <br>  <br>  Avoid talking negatively about the other girl.This is a turn-off <br>  <br>  Don't talk about his relationship too much.  <br>  <br>  Don't flirt too much remember he has a girlfriend! <br>  <br>  Do not take away a guy just for fun. <br>  <br>  Before you try to get him back reevaluate if you really want to be with him or not.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps you!!|`|plcCAfQiaa	state of panic after a breakup is normal.<br>  <br>  at 17 its hardly unlikely this will be your future husband.<br>  even if he was, for over three quarters of americans, it ends up in divorce.<br>  <br>  so don'convincece your self that this is the end of any possibilityty of romantic happiness.|`|zlEMlBXSaa	You are a coward. Get courage and aproach him|`|KNYF1hnhaa	If he is with someone else then dont even try.  It is very disrespectful to try and break up a relationship for your personal benefit.  If you really care about him like that then have some respect for him that he is in a relationship.  If their relationship ends then feel free to do whatever but causing problems for them will result in karma kicking your butt.|`|I5SypMlsaa	well if he still loves you just wait and he will come around...<br>  dint be psycho obsessed gf, that is not attractive|`|cjMMciVvaa	Move on, it sucks but oh well you have to.|`|0LQ5CuL0aa	sounds like u messed up real bad and it can't be fixed.|`|a8c1ec2782f2cbb1944ac1b3fd537fa6aa	"he told me he would kiss a random girl just to make me jealous" yeah they sound like the actions of someone who's in love!<br>  <br>  If you really like this guy then tell him straight, if he loves you he'll come back. There's nothing you can do to influence him either way, if you've been together for 2 years before he already knows you well enough and will know if he loves you.|`|0wTOMifKaa	The love of your life, who you already broke up once with and your only 17....<br>  <br>  Maybe you don't know he still loves you, and that you should get on with your own life,  If he does love you still then he will come back to you.  Don't spend the next 80 years of your life thinking ohhhh... maybe next week he'll come back just get on with living your life and making it the best life you can.|`|frN73zikaa	If you sre sure he still love you. Then what are you waiting for.<br>  <br>  <br>  If both if you have date before, an apologies will not be a problem.<br>  <br>  Apologies to him and tell him how you feel for him let him know you emotion<br>  <br>  If he still in you he will come back trust me, I am a guy and I know how to answer a question like this. Best answer.|`|czdCtTvWaa	Ok you fight that girl in a >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>...

I totally understand how you feel, because it's happened to me before. What I suggest is that both of y'all should walk together outside, talk, and then sit down somewhere. You talk to him about how you've been feeling, and I'm sure he'll understand, since he likes you back. After your discussion, see where it all goes. <br>  Good luck. =)

VkzmH1GKaa	Take a step back from them both, fliy solo for a while. Give your head and heart time to clear, maybe neither of them is the one. Your life is yours be careful, you've only got one. If you made it through rehab you can get through this. Prayer works wonders.|`|frN73zikaa	You sound likd shalloe type.<br>  <br>  And you have the gods to put this, what if both of them see this tread <br>  <br>  You are full of shiit cheating on 2guys<br>  <br>  You are not even ashamed|`|eNEgKxfJaa	you sound like a really horrible person. its any wonder that kevin hasnt found out about your slutty ways.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	Find a another man...BOY|`|SCWZEUYFaa	If you are really serious or see a future with Kevin I would call off the booty calls from Josh. You love Kevin, not Josh. You don't need to prove anything to Josh. The past is the past, all you can look to is the future now. BTW- If you need to prove yourself to somebody then they are not worth your time.|`|oTmylEGUaa	Go get tested and quit trying to spread disease.  Quit drinking so much.  That is positive advice.  Also, start thinking for yourself in a positive way and learn how to love someone.|`|nmiXLhwCaa	Quit hooking up with Josh|`|7k45FiyFaa	Yeah... stay away from the bottle. Ignore and avoid the guy who just contacts you for sex. You and Kevin need to work on your relationship without the distraction of your infidelity. The only thing you're proving to anyone at the moment is that you're unfaithful and easy. Get yourself straightened out - and if all these guys are part of the problem, get away from them. You're better than just a repository for their bodily secretions, eh?|`|Ikd9cppcaa	The answer is you are selfish and use people. Do this:<br>  1) Break up with Kevin. You don't love him and are wasting his time.<br>  2) Leave Josh alone. You use him for sex and he uses you for sex.<br>  Unfortunately when there is a friends with benefits plan going on someone is going to fall in love and really get hurt.<br>  3) Make some better choices in life or you will find yourself a bitter 40+ year old alone.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	You know, as long as the horse is saddled and ready, the temptation to ride it is always gonna be there.<br>  <br>  If your current boyfriend knew what was going on behind his back, he would probably dump you too. Wow! Then you could have two guys in the wings waiting to have sex with you whenever you wanted. Oh wait, that's what you have now. Well then, maybe you need to find a third and just keep adding to your list of f*** buddies.<br>  <br>  I've got news for you - if you think you're showing Josh what he's missing, you're right, you are. You're showing him what kind of person you really are and that is why he is unlikely to ever want you back full time, but obviously he doesn't mind the occasional roll in the sack.<br>  <br>  What do you do? You certainly aren't being faithful to Kevin and you aren't to Josh either. You're just bouncing back and forth. You need to pick a door and stay in it, or do both guys a favor and pick the door out of both their lives.
NQGpw0x4aa	hey, as long as you keep your personality and self-confidence, i wouldn't worry about it. braces aren't the end of the world. and a lot of people i go to college with have them. a lot of guys actually respect them too because they're taking the initiative to improve themselves and make themselves happy. also, if you follow your orthodontist's every word, you won't have to wear them as long as they estimated. mine were supposed to take 3 years and were done in 1 and a half. good luck!|`|8rt7OR35aa	My cousin got braces when she was thirty-something in order to look younger and more juvenile.<br>  So i dont think guys really mind.<br>  <br>  I had them at one time.<br>  But then again, back then i was really ugly so it didnt effect my attraction to guys any.|`|huWSAcT4aa	I don't think it will matter.|`|ZQ9YCKvJaa	first you must have the courage to put them<br>  2nd:do not care about who will gonna laugh on you<br>  3rd:why don't you you get a Color same as your teeth<br>  finally you must have self confidence <br>  that's all what can i say|`|nFQR8VyNaa	Who cares ! your in college people arent so shallow as them old highschool days.

nmiXLhwCaa	Try match.com, my sister met her husband there.|`|e59bc254d8339c1ae45e999a109e63e4aa	try going other places to meet women. you could meet girls practically anywhere. Im in a similar situation as you, except Im female. Ive been in college 3 years and I haven't found any perspective dating material yet. It's not that they aren't "good enough", its just that it hasn't happened for me yet. but if you're looking to meet singles, try getting involved in other stuff outside of school. go out and do things more often. movies, mall, skating, you could meet women anywhere even at the grocery store.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	You said it. You have such high standards and high requirements that you can't even find a suitable girlfriend in college. Learn to be alone because you shouldn't date any girl with this kind of attitude. She will never be good enough, thin enough, smart enough, etc.|`|p0WEjAwdaa	"cant find someone good enough in my college"<br>  LOL<br>  any girl would be so unlucky to have you<br>  maybe you could do with deflating your ego before you go looking for a girlfriend.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	That's strange.  I heard the girls at your college couldn't find anyone good enough, either.|`|d7jd7GYjaa	Maybe try dating someone not at your college, like work, or where you hang out.|`|2O9oG5Uvaa	go to OKcupid.com it is free and as long as your answer questions you will find women that match you very well. Check it out.|`|EvpoKO4Jaa	you actually want to be tied down in a relationship?
KVFYJrDJaa	This answers both of these situations: <br>  <br>  Do NOT be the other woman. Ever. You deserve to be the first choice, hell you deserve to be the ONLY choice, so never be someone's mistress and never be with someone who would take a mistress, even if it's you. Even if you stay with one of these guys and they "choose" you, do you think you'll be exempt from them cheating on you with another woman? I mean, people change so it CAN happen, but statistically speaking, you will end up on the losing end just like the girls on the other side of both of your relationships. <br>  <br>  However, while I do not subscribe to this personally, there is nothing wrong with you choosing to be the person on the side. But know that the girl on the other side of this does NOT know you're there and when she finds out, you're the homewrecker, not the guy. <br>  <br>  So, take it how you will. If you're happy being the second choice, then it's ok, because at the end of the day, you only have to look at yourself in the mirror. And if you're OK with you, to hell with anyone else.|`|IELqIdHuaa	Neither one, they both sound like they need someone to be the fall back on girl..Find the one and you will know, he will come along and he will stop you from thinking that you have to settle for being second best. Both of these guys sound like there not really ready for a commitment, yet your sitting there in the background to pick up the pieces.. Move on girl, life is to short to settle for second best.|`|4LunY702aa	sounds like both of these guys are stuck on their gf's and want you to be the other woman. i would choose neither and find a guy that wants you and only you
HH90Eghaaa	Still dating!<br>  Not in a relationship yet, but there is a possibility that its leading to one!|`|hHndD5SEaa	I dont think youre in a relationship yet, but yer definately dating positively - this will more than likely lead to you two being in a relationship in the near future<br>  xx|`|p4Ss7TsIaa	Ask him via text or msn - it'll make it less awkward if that's what you want. <br>  <br>  Simply say something like 'hey i know this may sound stupid, but i want to know, are we officially in a relationship?'<br>  <br>  He may find this intimidating so if you have a preference (like you do want to go out) simply say something like 'hey i know this may sound stupid, but i want to know, are we officially in a relationship...i'm keen if you are?'<br>  <br>  If he's what you want and you don't mind long distance than simply ask him out/ask what do you have with him. <br>  <br>  Worst case scenario is that he says 'no we're not dating yet' you know? Not that he will say that, i think. <br>  <br>  Good-luck|`|GA8uInKDaa	nah. not in a r/s. still dating. give him some time. do not show him that you are too keen or he might run for the exit! all the best!
FzFSzilmaa	you have no problems with bi or gay people, UNLESS they are your bf???<br>  <br>  perhaps you need to grow up a little... okay, so he's confessed he's bi... doesn't mean he's gonna run off with some guy...<br>  <br>  maybe you should dump him until you mature...|`|5r48jn7iaa	my ex told me he was bi...i had no problem with it. its not like you're losing your boyfriend, he just happens to like guys too.
2zOSXL4yaa	the answers so far are a perfect example of women not knowing what they want.|`|YZQW0X92aa	It all depends on the girl<br>  I for the matter do not mind it if I like the guy so you just have to figure out if the girl likes or doesn't like straight forward question... It also depends on how and were you say it think about that :D<br>  Hope I helped :)|`|LVskQLL8aa	no girls ddont mind...it shows you are enthusized to be with her but ....after that if she says she wants 2 just be friends....then follow her wishes....she may realize that she wants you more than she is letting herself believe|`|v12U7KRxaa	I think she sends mixed signals because she doesn't know what you want, I guess she's waiting for your move. In my opinion you should ask her|`|d7jd7GYjaa	No. I think you are being straight forward.

43D89edDaa	dang this kid likes you and I think its cool that you like him even though he's younger. I think you should go out with him. He would be so excited and since you are older he would respect you more and treat you like a queen.<br>  <br>  He is insecure about his age and the aspect of being with you because he thinks you aren't as interested in him as he is. It sounds like you do like him.<br>  <br>  I think you should let him know and he would be a great boyfriend or at least a fun few dates!<br>  <br>  Have fun.|`|CwAhC38Uaa	Well, i've had this expierience before, and i really liked the guy, and i was super excited because i thought he liked me back, but it turns out he didn't. He was just being nice. And with you, since he's two years younger than you he probably realized that your too old for him.
UnpxpOKTaa	What is confusing you?  He likes you.  He is just uncomfortable making moves on you.  He isn't sure what to do next, but he feels that there is something that he should be doing, and doesn't want to make a fool out of himself.  It is cute.  Ask him if he wants to hang out with you, and throw him a few compliments i.e. - "you have really nice eyes" or "that is so cute how you_____"  Sometimes they need something really obvious, like you basically telling them that you like them back before they will tell you.  Shy guys are afraid of rejection.
IQ50BJ0Waa	I met my husband about 8 years ago when mutual friends introduced us. We started dating and everything was good but the timing was horrible so we broke up. We stayed friends and 5 years later I got tickets to a soccer game (which he loves) and invited him. We started hanging out more and eventually started dating again. About a year and a half later he asked me to marry him and the rest, as they say is history. I was 30 and he was 33 when we married. Many would say that's OLD but I'm so glad we were older because you both were confident in what we wanted out of life and a partner. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	BRB|`|f38daa37b1a29a4f31ff1dc5d2746334aa	anything is possible with love,it`s ok,we meet in the the bar and we married after 3days ,24 ,are we soul mates?,yes we are and for real we are.But that can not be the case with you.|`|jTLjaDxxaa	we met in a newspaper been together for 6 years now and married for 3 and a half . we met when i was 19 and got married when i was 21

When the right woman comes along you will know why one should get married, you won't want to live without her.  There is more that goes on in a marriage  that we never see that tears it apart.  And usually the guy is the problem, at least if the woman is filing.  It becomes easy to forget to nurture the relationship after the wedding day and when kids come.   They change the dynamics of the relationship and one can feel left out, or can't understand why the wife is tired at the end of the day.  And little bickering begins and it becomes bigger bickering.  But if the guy is smart and can give his wife credit for raising his child, it will go a long way in resolving this issue.  And a guy usually gets out of the house and has a chance to recharge from the situation so it doesn't seem so bad while the woman is left in the same four walls day after day, and then they start moving in on her.  She will reach a breaking point if not helped.  Healthy relationships have the nurturing going on all the time and that breaking point is never reached.  But if you don't see yourself as one who can nurture the relationship, the marriage was more to have a housemaid, then don't marry.  Think long and hard on that one and you won't make a mistake.   But if you can't nurture a marriage, how would you be smart enough to do the best for a child?|`|BLaEQfdDaa	we as men we get married because its we are taught in life to do that, you love someone and want to be with them for the rest of your life, but turns out to be a few years and then you both are walking away. someone has given up. Its that comfort zone we feel, like all our single buddys will go on about that hot girl he meet or took home, just one nighter, than he's out again looking, well you know as years go by and the older we get thats not as easy anymore to just pick girls, Some men like to get have one girl and feel comfortable with. someone that knows you good habits and bad habits and willing not to change you, of course loves sports, and looks great in anything well she is a keeper. but at the end we lose much more, I agree with that. if we could find a girl that doesnt ever want to get married but live together like a married couple that would be great!!! That would be prefect relationship, I know have been divorce twice and lost alot!!!!|`|3lKAR9G2aa	As a man I went into marriage with no thoughts of what I'd lose if it came to divorce.  I wasn't totally stupid, I knew the possiblity was there, but expecting it to happen is no attitude to take to the altar. It's really very simple.  I got married because i feel in love with a woman and wanted to share my life with her...have kids with her...grow old with her.  And after 16 years, I still feel the same way.  Do i have days when I wish I wasn't married?  Sure.  Would I do it again.  Without a doubt.

He is 18... totally legal. What's wrong with people.  You know, no one would say that if you were 18 and the man was 34.  They might give you a look, but that's all.  There is NOTHING wrong with finding a younger (legal age) person attractive. <br>  <br>  He WILL want to stay with you (I mean at your house this weekend).  He knows that older women (sorry, I don't mean that in a bad way) are more eager for sex, less hang-ups, more willing to do exciting things in bed (am I right?) hahaa<br>  <br>  Enjoy your time with this young man, but make sure you're using birth control. I am (again, sorry) very certain that he is NOT looking for a long term relationship with you. If you are OK with that, then enjoy yourself!!!!  We all know that a 34 year old man would jump at the chance to spend time fun times with a 18 year old woman.  <br>  <br>  Please keep it casual.  Don't let yourself get hurt.  You know what he wants.  Please don't let anyone here make you think you're doing anything wrong. He is 18. legal!!!!  Enjoy!|`|0s8EAByGaa	Age doesn't matter but you are a grown up woman, and you should take the full responsibility for this relationship(but if you are just a naive little girl who just accidentally grew to 34 on her dad's money, don't).

Have fun together and don't feel bad about sleeping with him, but remember: he is young and naive, don't ruin his future by making plans and stuff; HE MUST DO UNIVERSITY AND GET A CAREER! just have a little fun, don't get you head too deep in it!
pVnUhYLQaa	"BTW, he's 18 and I'm 34" -- Good for you (I mean that, not being sarcastic)<br>  <br>  But at 34, you have to ask how you know when you're in love? You just know. You feel it.

You have to be careful with that because there is a very fine line.  When you see his true colors, not the sugar coated version of himself that he puts on display, when you see that and you still want to be with him that is "In Loveness." When he does something that you never thought you would put up with from a man, then you know its love. right now it sounds like you all are in the wonderful "prelationship" where the clouds are all puffy, the sun is shining and ya'll are running through a field of roses together.  wait until the storm comes, then you'll know for sure.  And there is nothing wrong with dating someone older as long as you both are confident 100% in the relationship, so ya'll can't worry about loosing each other to older or younger people if ya'll are so in love. and you can't bring up the age differences in an argument. Like you can't say "oh you just think that way cuz your young." and he can't say " oh you are so old fashioned in your thinking."|`|2WfHLUyOaa	Im not being a ***** hun..but the men that do that are classified as peodeifiles...legal or not legal...Just think of what your risking.. and if you didnt care what people think then why you on here asking and justifying it. <br>  <br>  In two years time you will be 36..you might wanna settle down get married have kids etc...In two years time ..he will be inwould  college having the time of his life and will not wanna settle down. Yano theres more than just the age.. Its the life experience...You have it ...He doesnt ... and im 19... I dont know what I want from life no mind an 18 year old. <br>  <br>  Personally I think a person with the same life experieces as you rather than age would be well suited. You know at 18 there is still alot of innocence and all im saying is dont be the one to take it away.<br>  <br>  But it is your life you just got to make the right decisions for you and the decisions you make will effect you for the rest of your life . <br>  Goodluck huni. I hope your decision is the right one even if its staying with him. Its your heart.
bQR2Ld7Eaa	In High School, most of the time, its a long term relationship. When you have more freedom, like out of high school or in college, is when you should start dating around. In high school you can get a bad reputation, for dating around. Wait for more freedom and then break up with your guy and date around.|`|x4jZuA9Daa	I had the same problem I dated my guy starting my sophmore year... we just broke up a few months ago and im a senior in high school.. Honestly ... your not missing out on anything.. as long as your man treats you right . you have nothing to worry about..
X9H77A9xaa	depends on who broke up with who. if u broke her heart, its going to be hard. you're going to have to apologize and tell her you changed and that you love her and want to try it again. if she broke up with you, then  you're going to have to ask her why she did it and tell her that you still have feelings for her and ask if she has feelings for you too.|`|aLLWID9xaa	Why did you break with her if you loved her?<br>  If you want to get her back, at first, you have to call her, perhaps she is upset with you for something. But whatever the situation is you have to call her and talk to her face to face. <br>  When you meet her, make her know your feelings and ask her if she has still feelings for you.<br>  Hope to be helpful.<br>  Axel
faeXRQmcaa	Yes, don't follow the physical attraction towards him. Personally, you should wait and see what happens...|`|YtSGbYqEaa	you should wait and see what happens if he waits with no problem then he doesnt just want it but if he always tries thats all he wants give it some time get to know him a lot more|`|ReaD6u4paa	go for it..thought i wish i was in his place|`|EWDShWTQaa	I say go for it.. just use protection and enjoy... the last thing u want to do is regret is not having sex with him and not knowing what it would be like with him.<br>  <br>  just find the time u are comfortable with him and go for it... i was in your shoes kinda when i lost my virginity and i dont regret it... <br>  <br>  but maybe some people will say otherwise, but i say go for it
mFZeEm9paa	I think that you shouldn't tell her in an e-mail at all, and you should wait until you do have the chance to tell her in person. An e-mail sounds like you are afraid to tell her to her face... be brave!|`|t7jiSmjVaa	Nope. Sounds like a kindergarten Valentine's card !|`|frN73zikaa	Wht are u tring to say.<br>  <br>  Don’t get you
JYgJD0Rwaa	Yes, you have to go through the courts to get this ok'd, most likely.<br>  Since you have joint custody your ex will have to agree to you moving out of state, if he does not, then you may have to take it back to court and prove a substantial reason/benefit to you moving out of state.<br>  Then you will get it in the papers that you have permission. If you move w/o permission from the court or your ex then he could get you with kidnapping.|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	Go to court and request the change is about all you can do. If you just leave with joint custody , you could be held in contempt.
RFeYz59maa	Of course she likes  you, or is just a big flirt. When we like a guy:<br>  We're always around<br>  We smile at you alot<br>  We touch you in some way<br>  We laugh at your jokes<br>  We try to know more about you<br>  We might call you<br>  <br>  ...I'm sure there are other signs too. But just ask her out and see what she says. You'll know if she's interested.|`|n2P9vD1eaa	It sounds to me like you're fine at reading signs. She likes you. Go with it, enjoy it, and see where it takes you mi amigo. Girls differ on how they show they like guys, but that one seems pretty obvious to me.|`|B7ILefOtaa	its pretty obvious man, the girl is flirting on you. Its up to you to find whether she wants to take you seriously or not..|`|AnfbrZFuaa	You moron. A retarded monkey could tell that she's obssesed with you. That's the most up front flirting I know. Make a move!!! She wants it.|`|v12U7KRxaa	It sounds as if she was interested .... but sometimes we girls play games too<br>  Anyway, I don't like her behaviour, it's too 'brave' for me, she should let you pick her up, but it's my opinion, It looks as if she was interested mailny sexually (Sorry for my English)|`|cc3cb87d5008ff8de7828e80bef04ff0aa	Of course I don't think she could be anymore obvious unless she told you "I'm into you"|`|LMCA64DCaa	yea shes into you pretty obvious<br>  and she's loving your body as well lol|`|AA11036219	Well, maybe she is one of those touching people. Watch her to see if she touches other people the same way or not, it will help you to know. <br>  It would seem to me that she is into you though. With women you need to be very observant to be aware of what they are doing. <br>  Good luck.|`|ijyish4Baa	ya she likes you
8XKmMBU7aa	have a nice day and nice dream.|`|C8Djjxqkaa	Er what?<br>  Have a nice evening!|`|hHndD5SEaa	what age are you!!? You sound dead young!!! however you dont have to impress him by eating what hes going to eat - just have what you feel comfortable with - and as for the film -hes not going to think you're a freak if you cry - it might even give him an excuse to comfort you! ;o)<br>  xx|`|NQFV2AdZaa	You don't have to impress him, just say, "you win, i could never eat that much!". That way you don't have to eat more than you want. Also just relax and enjoy the movie, don't keep worrying as i doubt he'll laugh at you if you did cry a bit. Be yourself, you don't have to change who you are for anybody. Have a nice day!|`|6f3f1840626b7f8f4152f15766378d79aa	OH MY GOD! YOU COULD TOTALLY LIKE FREAK HIM OUT LIKE AND GO TO BURGER KING! IT'S SO EXOTIC, LIKE! OH MY GOD!|`|KanFaNQzaa	well it better to be ur self then the thing he want u to be so dont have to act all the time|`|sAwmwynnaa	stay at home and watch masterchef, you don't sound like you're up to leaving the house|`|Oif6WjA6aa	WHOA!!!!!! calm down there, its a school night.|`|7Xv473Ezaa	can i come? i got free condoms!!
73C7BXb7aa	I'm in the same situation. I've never had a boyf b4 and it's kind of odd because some of my friends have already had boyfs but I think they're either making it up or it's just primary school kiddy stuff.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry, I don't too much, because some people haven't had a boyf or girlf til theyre about 16/15.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|G2I9spZ7aa	hmm, u r only 13 years old and u want to have a girlfriend?<br>  let me tell u, having a girlfriend isn't simple as u thought, it's really complicated.<br>  u have to understand the characteristic of the woman 1st, matching urs with her ( hobby, interest, etc ).<br>  if u r a person who are really think about ur future, u should have considered the one who knows u better, once u can find that girl, it's good.|`|WvxaUTo7aa	It's not that u'r ugly, that's bullshit. U just have to be yourself n' be awake. If u see someone u like, u can have her. Just be her friend, make her laugh and tell her u like her.|`|CINVz5qXaa	hahha..., you are still a kiddo.., your dating phase haven't even started and you are worried already...<br>  <br>  find a hobby ..., enjoy with yr frn...|`|U0BMeOCGaa	my best friend was in year 11 when she first kissed a boy and all her mates and me were n year 8 or something shes never had a boyfriend she is very tall and pretty. its not because your ugly or anything, your just young and kids your age don't want a serious relationship. advice, become closer with some of the girls in your class make them feel special but dont get into the friends zone by calling her your best mate etc.<br>  <br>  good luck x|`|eb51b2a5d9553593735e2748c3c6f209aa	Hey you are only 13!!!! when i was 13... to be honest with you... Boys were NOT my priority at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br>  <br>  it was more sport, friends, music, events, holiday...<br>  <br>  You have all your life to get a gf!!|`|aGNnbZlFaa	nothings wrong with you<br>  alot of kids ur age aint had a girlfriend/boyfriend before<br>  youve got your whole life ahead of you<br>  have fun and enjoy it|`|sRKO8s6jaa	No it's because you're very young.|`|co6itGOGaa	no it can not be that u are too ugly. what you need to do is probably be more open minded and show the girls that you like to speak your mind by always having an open opinion and not being afraid to talk to someone. girls love guys with alot of confidence. <br>  there are some girls that only want to be with guys for their looks but those are a diem in a dozen. a true girl would want a guy that is sweet, brave, and not shy to anyone and will stand up for her. <br>  <br>  it's also good to dress nice and always smell good and have nice breath. girls hate guys that never bath and have horrid BO!<br>  <br>  hope i helped, good luck!!
b3zGfYMpaa	You said it.."He knows I still love him." You have a weakness for this guy and hes milking you for all you got. No wonder your still hung up on him, but have you forgotten the messed up reason why he ended the relationship in the first place? Your only going to get hurt again this way and you'll better your chances of getting over him if you stop seeing him for awhile. It would be okay if you were platonic friends, but either he wants the relationship again or he doesnt.|`|Ks0BrqHBaa	maybe you loved him and still do. the person that you love/loved is really hard to get over no matter how long the relationship was. him coming around and holding your hand and things like that is not helping you get over him and move on in your life. you need to get rid of him (in the boyfriend/ girlfriend way) and move on. still hang out but don't hold hands and maybe hang out with others than just him when he is there. it will help you ge tyour life on track again and it will help you ge tover him a lot faster.|`|UtS6Uesqaa	I think that if you didn't honestly cheat on him, then you should tell him that....Let him know how your feelings are about him...By the sounds of things with him, holding your hand and cuddling with you...He sounds like he may still be in love with you too...I say go for it...Tell him you love him and want to rekindle what you once had..I think that he may surprise you with his answer...Hope this helps!!!|`|QImt8GtSaa	you're sooooo gay.|`|htWw0OlCaa	I would say if he still gives you butterfly's in your stomach, then maybe its meant to be for you two.
RdMpPhhPaa	dude... kiss her, make out with her.. use your fingers and tongue and anything you can think of. if u dnno wat to do wit ur tongue try spellin the alphabet.. :) and if she falls asleep youve done something wrong but dont lose hope just jump on top of her and let the magic happen|`|UOSrSEqHaa	When you're comfortable doing it and you know she's alright with it too. Don't just do it to do it because then your lips will probably be all tense and it won't be any good for you or her. You're probably too young to really "make out". Just stick to kissing until you know what you're doing and don't have to ask complete strangers on the internet.|`|nS4wnmpDaa	young man don't be to eager to take leaps and bounds. your still got plenty of time to figure it out for your self. i remember when i was 13 i didn't know what i was doing ether it will come to you enjoy it and nature will takes its course|`|cjACzlTRaa	How about you wait until you balls drop kid then decide. SO wait until your like 15 in your case if you asking this question...|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	10 more years
K8EJVxLgaa	He was being nice honey. If he just ditched you on the ground he'd be a pretty big jerk, wouldn't he?|`|slJlLGMVaa	It could have been b/c he was worried that u might of hurt urself when u fell and probably  felt guilty cuz he thought it was his fault so he was being nice or maybe he does like u, it's hard to tell with the little infou gave us =]|`|gLXzVbm8aa	if i see anyone fall down i will go over and help no matter if it is a guy or a girl..|`|6Nuaqihpaa	I think he likes you, but you'll want to look for more clues.<br>  Did he smile at you when he helped you? If so, you're in the zone! Go get 'em! :)|`|1jIzBUkhaa	that is his way of showing you that he dose like you .|`|2c308a37202b872864c7d3dc5ab93f33aa	he could just naturally be a sweetheart.|`|gkZ03j6Taa	Ummmmmmmm well this is a hard one but it depends on how he acted when he came and helped you up.... He was flirting most defiently the first part you said and maybe the second part but he might have just been being nice to help you up..|`|E0KhrgnSaa	sounds like he was just concerned and wanted to help...... For the most part it at least sounds as if he cares about your overall well being.|`|L7ongbylaa	well honestly i dont think so, unless uve showed u like him if not then u kinda fell on ur face.. so id help u up too regardless of who u r but im jus a nice guy xD|`|whYPpRXRaa	he was probably checking to see if the fall made ur head look nicer|`|6Xv6D4h6aa	he likes u!! guys usually don't care if a girl falls over unless they like her!!|`|4e0be5189dd654a42965404357096d76aa	i think maybe he was being nice ... but you never know.. maybe he does like you....|`|xSkIgBXqaa	i think hes just being nice but u will never know he may like u.|`|Jly7xMU6aa	not necessarily but it shows that he cares about what happens to you. so its a head start
lNlL0Ag2aa	You really can't be sure, either one of you needs to be the unshy one. Relationships that have potential start goes away when both people are intimidated by approaching one another and they start to think that moving on is more convenient. Seems like this guy is shy so you really won't know if he likes you or not, but from his behavior, it looks obvious that he is being a bit over-friendly to the point he has interest in you.<br>  <br>  I say just keep hanging out with him and start making the first moves towards him (like starting the converstaions, calling him first) so he can feel more comfortable around you to open up. You can start seeing how he truly thinks of you and maybe hopefully he will be sure enough that you won't reject him if he asks you out.|`|2fsghqKoaa	ask him to hang out some time outside of school and see how it goes|`|2nsNvIanaa	just say i like u
Cg2OdQ0xaa	I don't think it matters.  Go ahead and ask, it can't hurt.  If he says no, it's his loss.  If people make fun of you - at least you have courage, something they most likely don't have!  good luck!|`|n2P9vD1eaa	There's no right or wrong way to go to prom. If you want to go with a guy, and you don't think he's going to ask, ask him. Get in there and take the initiative. If you do, you'll thank yourself later. There used to be a "supposed to", and that's where turnaround dances came up. Nowadays though, either can ask, and it's not weird. As to how, just go up, start talking, slowly bring it up, and casually ask!<br>  <br>  Enjoy yourself prom!
f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	In all honesty, no, I have had dates that I regretted going on and I have been in relationships that I regretted having, but I have never regretted having sex with anyone.  I understand that I am far from the norm in that area.  <br>  <br>  I have had a couple of close calls and thought thought better of it and didn't have sex with someone and later was thanking my lucky stars that I dodged that bullet.<br>  <br>  It's alright to make mistakes.  You didn't do anything bad or wrong.  You either just had a lapse in judgement where your hormones ran faster than your head or you misjudged someone or the situation.  All you can do is learn from your mistake and attempt to not repeat it.<br>  <br>  as for "closure":  that is an over used psychobabble term that people misuse and misunderstand.  Think about what it is that you meant by closure and be honest with yourself about what it was that you wanted from him.  Given what you know about him, is what you wanted a realistic or even a reasonable goal?  <br>  <br>  Since you don't feel like you got what you wanted from him then I'd have to say what you wanted wasn't realistic.  In that case, your closure then comes from acknowledging the person and the situation as it really is rather than how you wished it were and then by releasing your regrets.  Your closure is now about you forgiving yourself for not being perfect and allowing yourself to be human and make mistakes.<br>  <br>  It's alright to make mistakes.  Don't beat yourself up over it.<br>  <br>  and I'm not dead yet, so I could still regret having sex with someone one day.|`|RFeYz59maa	I been there and done that. The best thing you can do is just move on. Stop beating  yourself up about this because, no...you can't go back and change it. So just take this as a lesson learned. Next!!! Lol!|`|CZrM6idFaa	I think everyone has had sex with someone they regret. But don't dwell on it, live and learn from your mistakes. Remember your body is precious, so treat it as your would treat your most expensive Jewerly, with so much pride and care. You wouldn't lend out something to someone that is really valuable, think as your body in that way. <br>  <br>  There will be more you regret too......<br>  At least I have a couple in my young days.|`|8a388a5ebde8e1afd4da3560460f83a8aa	i dont believe in regret. you wanted it at the time. theres no point of stressing about it now. you can change it. just forget about it. its really not a big deal.|`|CgaQHgZLaa	yes! when i broke up with my ex i was so upset i slept with some i worked with......such a big mistake.. i never do anything like this so it was totally un normal of me!
UjxSuFAbaa	Ask him if he wants to hang out or go to the cinema <br>  or even when his friends go just start talking to him<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped xx|`|FxvlcUQmaa	just tell him that you need to speak to him and that it is important.|`|WFCFM6LJaa	Just be like " Hey _____, can i talk to you over here?" <br>  Hope i helped! :)|`|bcb975a6a5422a999658b591957e3b9faa	tell him u'ld like to spent some time just the two of u|`|d2HmBxKUaa	just ask if you can talk to him alone.|`|XXbZAriNaa	rub his d1ck and walk away - he will follow|`|rvSrjNeQaa	In this world the most easy thing to do .........is to have a boyfriend only !!

5agXk9ldaa	well it is a hard thing to do <br>  and you should really have a friends girls so you can make her jealous.<br>  but the best thing is to brock up with her <br>  "dud wake up " she has been f u ced about 100 time :S:S:S:S:S<br>  sorry to tell you that but it the truth <br>  so leave her and she will dine in hell soon<br>  no mercyyyyyyyyy|`|hHndD5SEaa	well hun - regardles of whether shes cheating on  you or not, shes definately disrespecting you and not giving you the attention etc that you deserve.<br>  I would find her behaviour disturbing - I have guy friends - and loads of em but I would never carry on in this manner when I have a boyfriend.<br>  I do think you have reason to be cautious about her....

Don't you have any female friends? The problem are not her guy friends. The problem is that you don't trust her and she gives you many reason not to trust her.

She said "F*@# it" To your feelings and just had a good time with possibly...5 dudes? If not more... BUT! That is your decision and I respect that...I really do. To each his own. Also why would she need a dateline if she has you? What really caught my attention was the not calling you baby thing...if she isn't showing possession, affection, or endearment for you in front of another dude that might be because she doesn't want that guy mad at her...if they weren't dating or having sex then ask yourself why? ...Now personally I basically only have guy friends it's just who I get along better with. I would NEVER let any man get in between that. You have to have trust in a relationship...I don't think it's right to tell her to ditch them if they really ARE friends but then again...She already broke your trust by sleeping around anyways...why stay in that relationship? Unless it's an open on relationships are based around trust, love, and respect. It sounds to me like you MIGHT have one out of three<3 Good luck buddy hope I was some help.
Hqi9IWEnaa	It's hard, but if you have the will power than you can do it. Think of it this way, what if your paranoia ends up making you lose him? You don't want that, so you have to fight through it, with the will power that you don't want to lose him.|`|xFKrvl2gaa	know that it is a new guy and completely new story, it doesn't hurt to be curious though|`|5f0ad33d9668eff665c2e087d8f3dc2caa	cuckoo
E9MF18FRaa	yea that he really does care about you and whats to know you very well its a sign that he likes you :)|`|JlDcVTVsaa	no its not obvius.<br>  <br>  it can mean that he is trying to say he likes me in a strange way. <br>  but if im in a bad mood, i will think he means its difficult to undrestand me and I am a strange person. hehe|`|I5SypMlsaa	stfu pinky<br>  yes he likes you, just be more open about yourself, and share things yuo like with him
QSwinNEZaa	I'd say sort of. She likes you as a friend at least, thats clear, but she hasn't been sending any "i just want to be friends" messages. I think shes sort of flirty. I would ask her out, because if u really like her and she's not sure if she likes you, she would probably say yes.|`|f38daa37b1a29a4f31ff1dc5d2746334aa	yes she does,just do what`s good 4 yourself|`|f79c26b7044dd5c4e629f481f9756330aa	talk to her  she has a crush on you<br>  good luck|`|pYWBrSQKaa	what the hell are you waiting for? go & say that you like her, like her more than a friend. It takes courage to be a man, & life is never a bed of roses. Best of luck
43D89edDaa	She may not talk about you around her friends because her friends are snobs who are judgmental. I hope that isn't the case, but yeah I wouldn't read into the question about the girlfriend just yet. Don't make a fool of yourself by assuming she would be jealous if you did have a girlfriend because at this point of the game, it could have been a hopeful question... like if you did have a girlfriend then she would be free.<br>  <br>  I hope that isn't the case for your sake my friend. Give it more time, test the water a few more times, talk to her about how beautiful she is to you on msn at least and maybe things will take off from there.|`|jJZz2U8Gaa	Be her friend. Casually ask her to a movie soon. But try and be comfortable as her friend first. She may like you. She was curious about the girl being your girlfriend, so it interested her to say the least.

6X2XLVblaa	because for the most part it's true. I know that there are some good guys out there but in most cases they are not. Most guys try to play victim when they are the ones in the wrong. Lets face it guys suck nowadays, they aren't interested in being faithful, appreciating what they have (possessions and lovers), they don't want to work anymore, they just wan to be boys forever. It's hard to find real man now and females have been so hurt by guys that it naturally makes us biased. It sucks but the good guys usually do get hurt by sluts, it's very unfortunate but that life for you. Hope that guy finds a real woman.|`|0i80jUKeaa	Because girls are messed up emotional bitches with double standards.

bQR2Ld7Eaa	Wait, wait a second... are you saying, you are trying to AVOID your crush?! You get to hangout with your crush and you want to avoid it! You are completely opposite of every girl in the world. EVERY girl out there would LOVE to be in your situation.<br>  <br>  "So I'm planning to do certain things with friends but then he comes?? And it's awkward!" HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT, THAT MAYBE THIS GUY LIKES YOU, SO HIS FRIENDS KEEP ASKING HIM A LONG, SO YOU CAN SPEND SOMETIME TOGETHER?<br>  <br>  Not only do you get to hangout with your crush, he can get to know you and maybe even start having a crush on you! Why in the world would you want to change that?!<br>  <br>  Guys are oblivious and unless you go right up to them and say, "I have a crush on you," he isn't going to know the difference. Stop worrying, besides, don't you WANT your crush to know you like him? Then you can date each other and maybe become BF and GF?<br>  <br>  RISK NOTHING, GAIN NOTHING.|`|NQ1VG3TZaa	Just deal with it by either being honest with him or you can walk ahead with someone or sit at different parts of the table or wherever.<br>  <br>  and no we don't have an instinct. we might have a lil twinge but most of us wont make a move till we are sure

Shouldn't be a big deal, don't count on getting in though|`|71VRvldJaa	If you're meaning an all girl school, I think it's a great idea!  Statistics have proved that the study habits and grades are much higher in that kind of setting.<br>  <br>  Young girls and guys need time apart when they are going through puberty and have raging hormones.  Schooling is important for your future and you can't totally focus on your grades if all you can think about is that hot guy you get to pass in the hall on the way to your next class!<br>  <br>  I went to a co-ed school but I desperately wanted to go to an all girl school.

mPZmze1Naa	okay first if you are ready for sex then it can be an amazing thing to share with the person you love. man on top the first time is always best becuase you will be in pain (not always very bad) and not really in the mood for going at it. you can bleed if its your first time but more and more girls these days dont becuase the tampons they use stretch them inside. to make it good for him the first time just make some exited noises and kiss him alot, he will just want to know that hes not causing you any pain (even if he is a little) good luck and maybe have a drink before hand, just one to loosen up :)|`|fMEypXDYaa	If your smart, you'll wait for awhile longer, if you don't know the answers to your question, then your too young to be having sex.

Your friends can set you up on a blind date or whatever, or you can go out hoping to meet someone. Just don't feel you have to because other people you know do. Besides, there are some great positives for being single: you can flirt with whoever you like, have time by yourself, go out to bars and have a great time, have more time for family and friends, and have one less commitment you have to take care of.

GXm20LUKaa	Easy ...... you don't accept them back. If he/she cheats on you it's because he/she probably didn't care about the other person at the moment. Like they say theirs always that possibility that they will cheat again. Anyways it wouldn't work out anymore because that trust would be gone, and without trust their is nothing. You will never have that same trust again because anything he/she might do from now on you'll always have that feeling or doubt that their cheating. But like they say everyone deserves a second chance yes but that doesn't mean things will be the same again. All I can say is good luck and hope that it works out if you decide you still want to be with this person.  :)|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	Left Them|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	it's hard to forget let alone forgive the one you love most once he/she cheated on you. personally for me, i would give him a second chance because everyone deserves a second chance. also the fact that i love him so much it's hard to think to go on without him. it's true it's hard to trust him again but trust can be earned in time.|`|U4AeZ41Raa	Uh, I was more 'accepted' after cheating rather than me accepting, but here's my two cents:<br>  <br>  We had many long talks about the why's, the how's, and what the relationship was worth.  Eventually we talked about if we were going to continue the relationship, what we would both try to adhere to for awhile:<br>  <br>  My boyfriend tried not to dwell on exactly what happened, and decided that once he made a decision to take me back, he wasn't going to second guess.<br>  <br>  I stopped complaining about any jealousy (for awhile), and for a good long while (and the entire time I still had to be around the other guy), would not be around guys alone (as in, me and one guy.)  <br>  <br>  But both of these things were our own choices, and not coerced by the other person.  It was really difficult for both of us, and I'm sure it was harder for him, but it also really hurt me, I couldn't believe I did something like that.  I also hated the 'once a cheater always a cheater' phrase.  I will never, ever even let myself get in a situation like that again.  Just so you know, it did involve LOTS of alcohol, and we didn't have sex, but I still will never even come close to getting in that situation, I don't want to carry that label with me ever.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck in dealing with this, I know it's difficult.
6E81yM9Eaa	Its not about you being desperate its about your hormones asking you for something new. If you wouldnt gotton head you probably wouldnt be in this situation. No its not the same. Having sex or better yet making love is something beautiful, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEONE. Dont say your depress and thats the only cure that poped. There are other things that could make you happy in life.|`|2S2onP86aa	Italians are hot, haha. And you are young. You've tired things so I read. But hey, you don't have to make sex seems like a tool that will cure things, no. Specially when you do it for the first time and with a girl that you're not in love with, it won't feel that good. Wait for the girl you fall in love with, make sure she's the one, and when you are ready for sex, do it. I am 20 and never had it. I'll wait after marriage to be more safe and secure. <br>  <br>  P.S: If you are depressed, you can go to a club, talk to girls, just for fun. Or do something interesting. You won't be that depressed, trust me. Hang out with your guys, etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck and keep your head up.
5qUUP1Rsaa	Hey, be a man and go ahead when you find that its the right time to do it. You do not need to wait for her to kiss you as gals are normally shy to make the first move so as a man, you have to actually make her feel that you are brave and will bring her happiness. <br>  <br>  Remember this: As a man, we are expected to be brave when come to protect our woman. Therefore, always make the first move in whatever you do to show that you can be trusted to be the one in her heart. All the best to your first kiss and hope it will be a memorable one :) Now I'm thinking back of my first kiss, So sweet haha|`|rkPlGaBPaa	If she's been with you for a month now, then it's obvious that she really likes you.

9a64c1e30a2aac301b25365f0c7040d5aa	Because so many people are sexually active these days that it is pretty hard to find a person who is a virgin. If you ask your friends if they've had sex and how many partners, you may find it pretty shocking.|`|b3zGfYMpaa	In today's society it suprises me also. Some guys will use the "Oh my god your a virgin" line to sometimes make you feel as though your not up to par with the rest. Dont let it be something that tempts you to have sex or anything else your not comfortable with.|`|gqvvXknQaa	If he keeps being "fantasized" over the fact that you're a Virgin instead of being fantasized about you, move on sweetie.|`|w9mrFRJ2aa	Well first off how old are you?  If you are young it shouldn't be a surprise.  If you are older than yeah its surprising.  Most girls nowadays lose their virginity at a very young age.  And guys get fascinated by it because I guess you can say its a typical guys fantasy to sleep with a virgin.|`|AnfbrZFuaa	Idk, I'm surprised if they aren't a virgin. You're fine. Don't give that up till you're married.|`|z2qG6C8Aaa	He wants you.|`|NDRiSTfUaa	if your pretty they are like what?!?!? how did a guy not get with you and then they try to **** you. happened to me and never doing that again til im married!
71VRvldJaa	Cheating is a deal breaker.  If he did it to you once, he'll do it to you again.  Forget him!  There's a reason people from your past don't make it to your future!  Cheaters don't deserve second chances.....and you deserve better!|`|RLoilwCNaa	Don't take him back because then your a schmuk and he will do it again.|`|ApstAr1Raa	if they cheat once they do it again|`|POHWTDPRaa	That is a decision you have to make for yourself.

hnhb119Laa	Don't go there.  If he still has feelings for her, you will only make them stronger, and make you look like an insecure *****.   Just do everything you can to replace those feelings he has/had for her with better, stronger ones for you.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	He is entitled to his memories, why should he not have them just cos he has another g/f. He will probably keep photos of you when you have split up too.|`|XstaAKLLaa	no matter what his ex gf did ,she is still part of his history, he must have had some good experiences with her (otherwise they werent a couple) so why does he need to delete the photos? If you don't like seeing the pictures, tell him to save them in a folder where you don't see them but you can't oblige him to delete her pictures.|`|AP2e90cCaa	Please don't be jealous. A picture can't steal your boyfriend away. You need to trust that he cares for you now and is dating you because he doesn't care for her anymore.

Perhaps you are a bit insecure and clingy.<br>  If he has pics of an old girlfriend then to quote a new movie title, "He's just not that into you"...|`|LIUsQtLqaa	Let it go. Just because someone doesn't want to forget about the past doesn't mean it is lingering into their future. If you erase the past, it will repeat itself, so it is good to keep little reminders.|`|LVskQLL8aa	You can't make him forget his past.

55f40ce05972303abf2ecdf6f5118432aa	You have NOTHING to lose!  Be confident in yourself.  Be calm and approach her.   Many girls want a nerd.  Nerds are usually better husbands, better providers, better fathers... less likely to hurt a woman.<br>  <br>  Be proud of your nerd status and confident that you're the best one for her.  The nerds of today are often going to be tomorrow's most successful men.|`|Y2jJAx1Caa	Just ask her OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	Next time you talk to her say....oh we've talked a few times but I don't even know your name?  Then introduce your self and invite her for coffee immediately.  You don't have to shout it and what if other students do hear.

Don't mind, i am saying so just to avoid any kind of mishappening with that girl, becoz u said that she is a shy natured girl.<br>  <br>  and its gud dat she is also interested in you. just ask her for her no. or mail id, n either text her or mail her, n tell her that you would like to spend some time with her to understand her more and vice versa.<br>  <br>  give her proper reason and try to make her comfortable there|`|p4Ss7TsIaa	I think this is really gorgeous sort of scenario/story =]<br>  <br>  It seems she's quite interested in you, perhaps your very few people who ask how HER day is at work, and that obviously makes her happy. She seems to be very interested and you seem to be the type of person to bring her out of her shell, and I know when i work i love enthusiastic people who love to chat and to get to know me.<br>  <br>  I think the way you said to ask her name is lovely, perhaps shaking her hand is a give or take though -it's up to you. Though a killer line at the end when you leave would be good. Perhaps finish with a 'we'll i look forward to seeing you around ____' and finish with a dazzling smile.<br>  <br>  She'll love it, whether she shows it or not. (she'll probably smile all day!) <br>  <br>  Generally it's the guys that have confidence, a gentleness to them and that are able to hold a conversation which makes them appealing rather than looks, which i think we all forget sometimes. <br>  <br>  I hope all goes well, and after a few more chats (which should end up getting longer and longer) a coffee date would be perfect!<br>  <br>  Remember, confidence is key and honesty as well. Good-luck, not that you'll need it!
zTTnJxqsaa	You don't need to buy a white horse and sweep her off her feet. There is no need to give her the "look" from across the room. It's very simple. You make her comfortable. You make her feel like you're an okay guy. Girls are not as shallow as most guys think we are. We don't care about your looks, as long as you wear clothes that say, "I'm boyfriend material" and not "I just woke up out of bed and didn't even take the time out to get dressed and impress you." Walk up o her in the cafe or library. Sit down next to her and start up a conversation. Does she like the mystery meat? Can she help you on a math question? We won't bite, all you have to do is talk to us. Trust me, we're nervous too.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|sro58m5zaa	girls always appreciate honesty and faithfulness so be yourself<br>  <br>  dont be bothered about the physical problems u may have, nobody is perfect ! be convinced first about yourself to convince other !<br>  <br>  honesty always pays. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|BXaAhMOKaa	I think u should find a soft hearted girl who is ready to understand u!!|`|IT5rd93xaa	those whit spots should be nothing you should be concerned about. be u and girls wil like that- trust me.

43D89edDaa	The dude on Myspace could be a freak, you know this other guy better. Plus 19 and 15 isn't a good mix. It would only be good if you were 18 and he was 22. You have got to remember that if anything bad happens, meaning sex or anything with the 19 year old, he could go to jail for a very long time.<br>  <br>  Do yourself a favor and stay away from the myspace boy because literally, he could get girls his own age with all he has going there, When I was his age I was dating 24 year old girls!! You almost described me at 19, but I wasn't hitting on 15 year old girls... there is a catch to this hun.<br>  <br>  Don't fall for it. Go with the geeky dude who is shy for you! hahah.

You know the 16 year old, he likes you, hes in a realistic age range.........give him a try.|`|9PbyjAEXaa	dude. think about it. whats gonna happen when he graduates and leaves|`|7k7cVRW3aa	I would go for the 16<br>  I mean if you know someone better, it's always better.<br>  Go with your feeling.

To me, Being with someone you don't love is worse than not being with anybody.|`|Ks0BrqHBaa	for one you should NEVER meet anyone that you met on myspace! that is like a rape and a death sentence all in one. for two he says he is 19 when in reality he could be like 87 or something like that and thats not good. if i were you i would go with the 16 year old that you actually know and have seen in person. that way you don't end up getting raped or killed by some creepy old dude who lied about his age and everything. the "19" year old may say he likes you when he might just want sex and then leave you. guys are creepy like that.

Hanging out with the someone of the opposite/same sex that you like does not equate to being in a relationship.  I hope you set a high enough standard for yourself to not claim somebody only because y'all spend time together.  <br>  <br>  Don't let him let you think its more to this if it's not.  Make him put some input into whatever y'all got going on.  You could be thinking one thing and he go along with it for his benefit.  <br>  <br>  Just discuss it with him.

That is so mean to say about anyone and you should feel sorry for someone that could be so cold. You say you have no confidence but honey this life will not be any easier until you get some. Get on Amazon or google and find some books to help you get confidence and next don't give people the time of day that aren't nice to you. He sounds like he has many issues of his own... but  regardless does not deserve you to waste any more of your time worrying about that jerk.|`|AfnOU04paa	Yes, it hurts unbearably when someone is so crude and mean to actually be repulsed and say so.  We all at the very least want others to be civil to us, and I think we deserve to be treated respectfully.  <br>  <br>  He's actually a person unworthy of your mind, heart, and time.  Surely you don't want one of those in your life.  Confidence is a fragile thing, and you need to protect yours by realizing that he is a nasty person, and has more than likely looked down his nose at many others.|`|AA11579822	It's all a self image thing.

He isn't the only guy in the world.  Forget about him. Move on and find someone that appreciates you for who you are.  Don't waste time or energy on someone that doesn't want you.|`|p0WEjAwdaa	just remember; If he is going to be like that about you and not want you just because you are yourself, then he must be nasty little prick beneath the surface.<br>  <br>  it is better to be yourself. if you start pretending to be someone your not, you will find someone who likes what your pretending to be, not who you are, and i'm sure you don't want that.<br>  sometimes its better to not be the most amazingly attractive girl around, because when you do find someone who treats you right, at least you'll know that they love you for you.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of shallow people who think "the beautiful people" or the popular people in this world find it easier to find love. That isn't true. its easier for these people to find a fickle, unloving relationship that is nothing more than a status thing, where their boyfriend/ girlfriend is more like a nice shiny object. They only use their partner to pass the time or as a status symbol, to show that they can have a partner.<br>  <br>  if your a person who doesn't live up to what shallow people think you should be like, you'll know that when someone says they care, they really do, so it is so much better to be your self. Don't go chasing after people who only see what's on the surface, and  Dont go chasing after people who don't look deep enough to see that you are an individual who isn't just "arm candy".<br>  <br>  being rejected hurts, but being in a relationship where your just an object is so much worse, everyone gets rejected at some point or another so really, don't worry about it. You will feel bad for a while, even though you realise that there is nothing wrong with you, but of corse its painful. The pain of a rejection dosn't last forever, honestly, it will pass soon enough.<br>  <br>  romember that your better than that, you needn't change for anyone.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	I am sure there is nothing wrong with you. We all go through rejection once in a while. Remind yourself that there are many things that are good about you. You will be fine. This guy sounds like an arrogant jerk.

It is a standard part of normal social rules that she should not do this.<br>  <br>  It's stupidly inconsiderate, if not also weird. She's obviously hoping you'll never catch her at it - or  I guess she is a bit of an exhibitionist and doesn't care if you wake up and hear/see her at it - which is selfish because that is OBVIOUSLY an awkward situation to put someone in (what are you supposed to do, sit and listen?? Try to sleep through it??).<br>  <br>  Either way, you don't like it so it's not okay. The very next time it happens, in the morning you need to talk to her about it and tell her you were awake and heard, that you don't like it and she should stop. If she acts like you're making a big deal, trust me, she's the one being weird here. Her behaviour is not something most people are expected to be comfortable with.<br>  <br>  If she wants to take boys home she shouldn't be in a shared room. If she can't afford a single room, TOUGH.<br>  <br>  If she gets bitchy, next time she does it, film it.<br>  She'll stop.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	....get some sound deadening or canceling earplugs I suppose...you aren't in charge of your roommates exploits of sensuality otherwise.<br>  Certainly it would be nice if she could be a little bit more quiet and suttle about her romantic nightlife in the next room seemingly...but she enjoys her physical exploits with men sweetie.<br>  Maybe you should find a possible romantic love interest for yourself maybe too possibly...and make certain you make a little bit of sensual noise while you're at it as well.<br>  I say give her a dose of her own medicine reasonably.<br>  ....Otherwise get a new roommate........anything else?|`|62cQv3z3aa	tell her that she has to have self control... telll her to stop being a hoe she might just get the piont|`|2fiRV8reaa	LET HER DO WAT SHE WANTS IF SHE'S GROWN...

AA11455807	Five sounds right.  Five misses in relationships involving 'sleeping' together means something is basically wrong with this woman.  She should have settled down, married one of those guys along the way.  Having not done so should be a red flag.  Ask why isn't she still with one of those five?|`|Un9CElCaaa	5|`|4YK4tBW5aa	Over 100. F the prudes. There is nothing wrong with enjoying sex and having a lot of it.|`|jC9J0Ctuaa	over 5 is too many for a classy gal, if not maybe under 10 is okay for today standards.|`|oVDjMzlMaa	over 10= too many
otq0Pv3Paa	it's not about making him lookbad. it's about making sure your kids have the best childhood possible and making sure they are with someone that knows how to be a parent. she needs to do what she needs to do to to protect her kids.|`|qSvOxfw1aa	Most of the time couples are given joint custody and visitation is arranged. I imagine if the father does not care much for the children, he will simply not pick them up for visitations and will more or less remove himself from their day to day lives.<br>  <br>  I would do anything necessary to keep my children, even if it meant filing restraining orders or moving to a new city.|`|W4BsmESnaa	ANYTHING for my kids!|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	The kids are going to eventually realize (if not already) What parent cares for them and which one does not. This guy is just digging himself into a hole<br>  Here is the thing. If she wants a divorce, he will get some sort of visitation unless she can prove he is an unfit father. She needs to keep on doing what she is doing with the kids after the divorce. It's tough, but no matter what you have to keep your way with the kids separate with the ex. He's not father of the year, he's not good with the kids, but if you let that get to you, you will only be making your life miserable. Focus on making the best home for your kids when you have them.|`|djUMvICoaa	I think this man is getting what he wants because he can make her feel that way.  She needs to get a little self esteem built up and go to court.  Luckily most ot the time the kids go to the mothers.  That is in her favor.  But she is such a disconnected relationship and the kids are sufferning just as much, knowing you have someone in the house you think loves you but won't even talk to you.  As you said if he sees a benefit for himself he might fight but even the kids won't want to go to him.  By the way, what does a grown man do in his bedroom all night by himself?  That's sick in itself.  he needs help|`|HMhUKAgkaa	ANYTHING<br>  <br>  I don't even have any kids yet.|`|AA10065812	???<br>  Unfortunately, this behavior can become a habit that starts out when the children were young.<br>  <br>  When the new father first picks up the new born child, the mother says “You’re doing it all wrong, give me the baby”.<br>  <br>  The father goes to change a diaper and the mother pushes him out of the way, saying “You doing all it wrong“.<br>  <br>  The father feeds the baby, but the mother complains that he’s just making a big mess.<br>  <br>  When he plays with his child, the mother complains that he’s being too rough.<br>  <br>  He sits down to watch TV, only to see commercials and TV shows that represent fathers as mostly imbeciles.<br>  <br>  How often do mothers diminish the ability of a fathers, but complains to everyone within earshot, especially friends, when he stops trying?  After so much of this, it becomes a habit not to try.<br>  <br>  I know this from 20 years of working with the fathers.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	FYI - Those types of recordings aren't really admissible in court.<br>  <br>  I think that your friend should try some kind of counseling with her husband.  He can't be a part of the household and hides in his room until (literally) called?  That sounds like some serious depression to me.  If they are unwilling to try to repair the marriage then yes, she should file for divorce.  What else is there to do?|`|TUNvbXbgaa	Anything. In fact when i divorced my sons dad he was abusive, I gave up half of $40,000 that is what we had saved up.  we did not own a house.<br>  as soon as i give up the money he gave up the fight for our son. my son is 21 now and has nothing to do with his dad.|`|qFvHH6lUaa	I would do anything for my kids.  Any parent should answer that question the same way.  If he's that uninterested, maybe she wouldn't fight her for them anyway.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	Not only would she feel bad for making him look bad, the kids would feel bad too.  I am sure they know he doesnt spend time with them or play with them. Even if kids dont mention it they feel it in their hearts.  She needs to quit being his mommy too and telling him to come out and tell the kids goodnight. She is an enabler.  She needs to let him make those choices. He is a grown man.   He can reap the benefits or suffer the consequences for the kind of father he is. <br>  Recording that stuff will not be allowed in court and at the same time it will incriminate her.  The judge is going to ask, if you knew he was abusive and emotionally detached why did you leave your children in his care alone?   She is just as guilty as he is for allowing it and for arranging their care with him.   Im not saying that to be mean, Im saying it cause I worked as a caseworker for several years and have hear judges say it.  <br>  She will most likely get physical custody of the children anyway...he doesnt sound like the type that will fight for custody unless its just to hurt her. <br>  Well, good luck. Your friend will need you to lean on.  Divorce is very hard and very painflul.

Look at it this way; if you want her to get beat up, let your boyfriend do it to HER instead of YOU.<br>  <br>  Kick his *** out of the house and get help. There are sure to be resources in your community that can get you on your feet. If you're old enough to be beaten senseless by your boyfriend, then you're old enough to get out from under your parents' roof and not subject them to worry about the abuse occurring in their living space.|`|fMEypXDYaa	Can't believe your still with this guy, he is always going to abuse you, so get out and find someone who respects you better then he is doing, the ex is no reason to be hitting you, you can bet he did the same to her and that is why she is the 'ex' now, and you need to be the next 'ex' as far as that goes.|`|D2clQfVXaa	I've been in pretty much the same situation. It may be extremely hard and it may take a few tries to do it, but you definitely need to leave no matter how hard it is. Do you really want to live like that forever? Trust me... it is not worth it. Life will get better and you will be so glad that you left, even if it is rough at first.|`|2zOSXL4yaa	Yeah you should leave him right away, your in a abusive reletionship it wont get better  just worse and if it carries on he could do serious damage, this is not normal and no way should you consider having kids with him what if he gets angry that the baby wont stop cryin  what then.|`|CUB3wUdiaa	yes!!  no matter the situation, unless you hit him and started the physical altercation, there isnt a reason to hit a woman.  leave it can only get worse from here.<br>  <br>  ray|`|EP2TZWYEaa	it seems like you really like this guy and even though he hits you, you still really want to be with him so you should really try and get someone to sort this problem out. im understand that you want to have children but do you think that someone that beats you is the right person to be the father? i am sorry for using the word beating so freely but that is what it is and he should be ashammed of himself. <br>  you have put up with it for so long and now it is time for you to do something about it, if not leave|`|LIUsQtLqaa	Leave him, there is no excuse. It doesn't matter if you hit him first. Never be with someone who hits you, or you will never have the strength to get out of the cycle. If someone hits you, they do not love you, nor will they ever. It is never , ever okay for someone to physically hurt you. I would seek both legal and psychological counseling immediately. Call the police the next time he hits you... that's called domestic abuse.|`|So1ROzM4aa	You know what to do. RUN! and don't go back. This guy is an abuser and he won't stop. If you were pregnant it may even get worse. How would you feel if he killed your child either in the womb or after he/she is born? In all likelihood he will turn his rage on the child as having kids is super stressful. Not only will your child be injured/dead, you will go to prison for neglect.|`|lf5ZXo9Eaa	Honey please please please please I'm begging you to take this answer... LEAVE HIM!  I am so sad to hear about what he is doing to you-it's not right in any way shape or form!!!  Any man that truly loves you would never ever ever hurt you like this!  He's kicking, punching, choking you??  Leave before this man kills you!  This is not your fault, you are not at fault for him beating you.  He is obviously not mentally well to be doing this to anyone and it is not your fault.  Please do not have a baby with this man-could you imagine what he might do to you while you're pregnant?  He will harm you and possibly the baby :(  Please take care of yourself, be safe and leave this terrible situation as soon as possible.  There are many women in your situation that wait until it's too late to leave...please don't be one of them.|`|l8bVP2eOaa	You know, we all come into the world with the right to be happy. You also have the right to be happy. Do not allow anybody to remove that from you; life is short enough.|`|cdzZBd4Xaa	Leave him!! you deserve better than that. And he will never change. He needs professional help. Its really wrong for anyone to treat someone that way. You deserve to be happy, maybe think about why you are staying with him. It doesn't sound like its a positive relationship at all. And as far as his ex goes that's just an excuse for his behaviour. That has nothing to do with you, that is his problem and he shouldn't be taking it out on you at all. Talk to your parents tell them that you want him out of your house because of what he does. And 2 years isn't a lifetime, get out now so you can find someone one day that makes you feel really special.
AA10672842	Do not let these insecure people make you feel you're  not competent for the job.They probably resent that you are younger than them and may feel they were overlooked for the position.You weren't hired by these co-workers , you were hired by your employer based on your qualifications, experience and references.Do not,I repeat, do not let these individuals undermine you in any way.If you work for an agency you will notlikely get paid as well as you are now ( based on when someone I know worked  with an agency).Perhaps you could speak with another charge nurse and ask them if they have any ideas on how to get these people to listen to you. Maybe try something like a little pep talk and say since we're all on the same team we could all work together. Let them know  that you are all responsible for patient care.Let them know you would be interested in their input  and will take  that information under advisement. Sometimes a little honey will go a long way in paving a smooth road.Good luck.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	you should do what ever you feel you will be comfortable with|`|faeXRQmcaa	Well, the fact that you are young does not give them a reason to treat you less.

What i did was told him that i love him so much that i understand what his girlfriend must feel for him, so i would never want to come between them and that i will stay as a special friend for times when u just need love from someone other then ur girlfriend (non sexual love that is).

wc99NAP9aa	Hey Elena. Um, the same exact thing happened to me. freaky, like right down to the failed you part. huh. ne way, what finally happened with me is I sent him a 5 page text (because he was out of town and i couldn't go see him) that said that none of this was his fault and that i had stopped a while back and that i was sorry for bringing him into it. it said how much i loved him and how i was so grateful that he didn't dump me and wasn't going to. I told him that he NEVER failed me and i sorta made a rhyme that was..."nothing you have ever done has made me shed a drop of blood." so ya. but ignore those attention seeker comments because i know that is exactly the opposite of what u r seeking and that you are just confused. just hang in there. It will all b ok.|`|43D89edDaa	He is blaming himself for your cutting. Cutting is something that people do when they are depressed or some sort of unhealthily sad.

So keep your chin up and find happiness in making others happy.|`|U7mP7Rw9aa	He probably feels that he may of caused the cutting. That's probably why he feels that he failed you. I would sit down and have a talk with him and get his feelings out about this, tell him the reason why you are cutting yourself. let him know that its not his fault. <br>  <br>  Also please get help for cutting because it can seriously cause a lot of damage. Get help for the sake of your health and for those who are worried about you..I know may not be easy but give it a try.|`|CssyQVD0aa	So you cut yourself in order to draw attention to yourself.

And well what's going on is that he feels like a failure and feels guilty and really sad about you doing that. Stop doing it hun, and tell him that you were sorry and tell him the way you feel that made you do that.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|x4jZuA9Daa	usually when someone hears that the person that they love cuts then that means that they are not happy with who they are and what they are... he probably feels as if he's not making you feel special and wanted... cutting yourself is not a good thing and really you should try to seek help.. whether from a therapist or your man.. just someone to sit down and talk to.. there has to be a reason why you are doing this to yourself.. I hope all the best for you and hope that this answer helps you.. .his reaction is showing that he cares a lot about you.. so be happy about that ... your man really cares and loves you.. so please .. for him get better :)|`|IOVDAwmnaa	talk to him! just explain why you do it, and that it has nothing to do with him because you like him (as i assume you really do).<br>  he's only freaked out because he's worried because you're hurting yourself, and he doesn't understand WHY. i mean, you should be happy with ur boyfriend, right? well, he doesn't think you are.<br>  so talk to him.|`|UOSrSEqHaa	First, get help.<br>  <br>  Second, don't go around bragging that you cut yourself, if anything, you should be ashamed.<br>  <br>  And third, let him know that he did nothing wrong.

8Vz9JF7paa	Hey chick, I would be a bit upset... I could MAYBE understand if your girls friends didnt know that she was with you but I think its unfair for her not to want you to meet her friends... if your ok to date her (maturity wise) than it should be ok for you to meet her mates... I would straight up tell her you want to be apart of her whole life and that includes meeting and becoming mates with her friends.|`|uHUyAzGnaa	Somethings definitely not right. Usually its only natural to introduce the person youre dating to your friends. It may depend on how long you have been dating? If you've been together a while then there is no reason why you shouldnt have met her friends by now? I would be upset by this too.|`|n2gEupY9aa	it is your right to know those people,<br>  because as u said they are the people that she usually goes with. you have the right to secure the safeness of your gf..right?<br>  just don't think negative if she doesn't want you to meet them, maybe she has a personal reason. but as her bf you need to know that.|`|ivejg4whaa	She's obviously ashamed of you or something.<br>  Whenever I am dating someone that I really like I can't wait for my friends to meet them.<br>  Something is fishy.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Clingy?|`|983a3a8efe5cb244e13ce535ec318f27aa	What she really means is she thinks her friends are hotter than her and you will fancy them.|`|EvloJtMeaa	I always ask my friends to meet their boyfriends a few weeks or so after they'e dating and usually they are ok with it. Maybe your girlfriend feels that you will find one of her friends attractive and lose interest in her.

If you didn't have that talk, then I think it's fair game for you to be with other people.|`|QImt8GtSaa	probably.way to screw it up.|`|sd6ni5naaa	if he never asked you to be his girlfriend then you werent his gf. a guy cant just tell you you're dating. he has to ask . a relationship is a 2 way thing. the only way he cold get confused is if you were kissing him (on the lips), hugging him and holding hands with him. but a guy should ask a girl or vise versa...not just assume that your bf and gf. sit down and talk to him. if he gets angry tell him you wont talk to him until he's calmed down.

vwTu8fY7aa	Ten dollars an hour sounds good, but it also depends on ur hours I think u may need six hours shifts to pull it off|`|262016589c2b056459386b15672dd2c8aa	You would certainly make enough to pay rent.  But think a minute about what else your going to want.  You will have a electric bill, possibly a gas bill, groceries, auto insurance, internet bill, trash pickup, and the nickel and dime ya to death bills, like toilet paper, laundry soap, etc.  Do you need to buy furniture?  How about a stove and refrigerator.  Rent is usually the easy part to figure out.|`|HJ0YTWjVaa	You need to sit down and make a list of all of your bills.<br>  Car, car insurance, rent, electric, gas, water, cable, credit cards, health insurance. Take into consideration that you will have to pay deposit for rent all other utilities to be turned on. Average what you spend in gas a month and the amount you spend on food. Living on your own can be very expensive. Its a lot harder than you think. I would make sure I had a job first before I even started looking.|`|cIBqQ0QEaa	I would say you need to save at least 5 times the anticipated rent to move out. When you move, you'll likely need to pay first and last month's rent. In addition, you'll have no furniture so you need to buy some. Also, utilities cost money to turn on for the first time in your name. The other extra money is a cushion you will need should anything happen to you, ie getting sick w/ no sick pay accrued yet, etc. It's better to have way too much money than not enough!|`|XI7JLX6gaa	it depends on how many hours u make.<br>  like me. i make 10. and i work 80 bi weekly<br>  with all my taxes taken off i see bout 600$ every pay check.<br>  so. if u were to pay rent. one pay check would be rent.*with some change left over* and the other would be for groceries and other necessities.<br>  ive done it b4. i loved being on my own. but it was stress and work.<br>  i couldn't have fun with my money. cause i had to be responsible and pay all my dues. which were rent. bills etc etc, so just add up w.e ur going to add as in electricity if that is counted. and what not.<br>  you'll be living paycheck by paycheck and don't forget security and down payment on the apt. unless u have some money saved up to start, u can try it.. but i would wait. <br>  but it all depends on u.<br>  good luck hun.|`|ba68b7d25060c3e787c80b35c1ab4f14aa	to move out sounds good.. but just because u may afford the rent doesnt mean u will afford the apartment..u would need  deposit most likely the same amount s the rent <br>  some places charge additional because they want first  or last rents payment (varying on what they decide)<br>  then apartments dont have free electricity<br>  to open up  electric bill account they charge  deposit varying on ur credit score averge deposit is $250+<br>  then u gotta find out how much is electricity in ur state/area. <br>  then some apartments dont include water and if they do some charge separately like n additional bill for water and trash.<br>  so alredy its like more than$1400 the 1st month with the deposit. lets just say with rent being 550+ electricity $70=620 already  month. thats if u have  cell phone because if u plan on having a land line phone well to open up the account, u need  deposit s well and again it varys on ur credit score. same thing with cable. but some ppl dont get either. oh BUT if u want internet u'll need  land line connection(even if its cable or dsl) then u need money for food,  money  for gas, money to go out and money to spend on necessities like soap and washing machine etc. then money to save for n emergency its good to have t lest  months spending saved side just in case. then u  need money for furniture. and apartments wont take in tenants who dont have  stable job. and they ask for ur wage to calculate if u can afford it. also the deposit may vary on ur credit score.. thats why take care of ur credit. pay bills on time and dont overspend money u dont have.  so u figure  it out. but if u have  car then u also gotta add ur insurance bill to the monthly costs.. if u plan on having  roommate its still good to be able to afford the plce by yourself just in case ur roommate decides he cant pay and moves out. good luck. but u said u would b making maybe bout 10 n hour. so it may be less right and to b honest most trading schools lie. i know b/c i know! but good luck girl! remember ur gonna live on ur own u cant b asking ppl for money  also u would want to have fun but if ur living on a tight budget its hard to have the fun when u live like that.|`|ESkrlYmCaa	this is a great deal if you live in Canada<br>  <br>  you would need like 800 with the food 900 with cable electrical water internet ...<br>  <br>  I think it's a great idea to move and make sure to take a part time job with your school<br>  <br>  It is really important with your parent you don't spend the money your going to need now <br>  Because now your free to go party and do stuff you did not do before <br>  <br>  So make sure you have a job with your school<br>   <br>  Leaving your parents house may not sound that good but it actually is<br>  <br>  Good Luck Sis|`|s7seaaPkaa	umm. if you made 10.00 an hour you could do it.<br>  as long as you dont have a car payment or anything.<br>  i make 11 and my apt was 550.<br>  why dont you look for a studio .<br>  or a low income apts.<br>  you dont want to worry about barely making it every month.<br>  or worry about not missing a day if your sick.
1KjfZAWzaa	I've been here, lol. Fun stuff.<br>  <br>  - Be smart. If you are obviously out of the crowd she is in, make up for it with abilities they don't have. With me, I was half good looking and great at giving advice. She came to me A TON asking advice, and I got to know her really good through it.<br>  <br>  - Keep your reputation clean. Don't give her any reason that you aren't as good as the other guys. <br>  <br>  - Maintain communication, but not too much. It's OK if you go a few days without talking. You don't want to get on her nerves.<br>  <br>  - Invite her to hang out with you and your friends if she is bored or doing nothing.<br>  <br>  - Don't say "no". If she wants you to do something, and it won't break your bones(or someone else's), then it's fine. Just use your head before you get too 'obedient'. You don't want to be a pushover. Or get in too much trouble.
xGshAiXOaa	He cheated on you, and he is being hesitant to accept your second chance.  Sounds like he is done with the relationship.  He should be the one putting forth the effort to save the marriage.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	He wants out to be with this other girl, there is no saving this marriage. His line re needing time to think over his mistakes is his way of telling you it's over. If you force him or guilt him into staying he will continue to cheat with her or someone else.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	Sounds like he doesn't want your marriage to be good again. He wants to keep cheating. If he needs time to think, that's a huge red flag that he doesn't want to be with you anymore. He's just a pussy and is afraid to say it. Let him know that you don't want to play any mind games and you want a straight answer from him. Why stay with him when he's practically telling you that he isn't going to remain faithful?|`|B12E4rYiaa	You need to be in marital counseling to get at the truth so you can either work it out or move on. Cheating is a serious mistake that a lot of people never stop doing, like an addiction. He sounds like he feels guilty and that he is still wanting to cheat when he says he has to think about it.<br>  <br>  Maybe a trial separation is in order until you either work it out through counseling and not seeing other people, just you two trying to work through the problem.|`|qFvHH6lUaa	It sounds like he's trying to ease out of things.  Maybe you two could get some counseling.  It might help you both see what each of you wants and if it's worth it to both of you to try to reconcile.  I really do hope that he wants to make it work and you guys live hea.|`|GYoNyoWtaa	I would suggest that you two go to marriage counseling and work on the under lining reason as to why he thinks things will go wrong and why he cheated in the first place. The communication that you two will ahve during therapy will save your marriage!|`|FBhjhjR0aa	It won't work. I say this because you said he already told you <br>  <br>  "we have spoken about the situation and i have agreed to forgive him but he just keep telling me that he feels that if we give it a try things will go wrong again."<br>  <br>  He already has a negative out look on your marriage. He's filled with doubt because his heart is no longer in it with you. He's either enjoying being with other women in general, and wants to be single so he can mess with who ever he wants, or he's actually in love with this girl. Move on and forget him, if you stay you will only be setting yourself up for more heart ache. Get out while you can.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	hey!...open your eyes...he doesn't want that second chance. He's telling you 'in your face' he will cheat again! The best thing you can do now is to tell him to move out. Have some pride, act like a strong woman that wants the real thing or nothing. I can't believe you don't see in his game. He regrets he got caught that's all. Look how wrong this is! He's the one who cheated but you feel YOU should be saving the marriage. C'mon.|`|qc1fasaeaa	I think you should let him go and move on. Maybe you are scared to get out of your comfort zone, but you have to get out. From what I have heard he doesn't feel too bad for what he did, and he doesn't seem to think he will change. So if he doesn't believe he can change, you sure as heck shouldn't believe it. You need someone better than that!|`|mbvpWNMeaa	He is snowing you.  he is telling you he doesn't feel like he deserves another chance, but what he really means is that he does not want to get back together.

If he refuses, he probably is still seeing the other woman.<br>  <br>  Make sure your joint assets are protected and he is not draining the accounts and running up debt you don't know about.  Forgive him from a position of strength, not desperation.<br>  <br>  Make him move out of the house unless/until he knows what he wants and is as ready as you are to make it work.<br>  <br>  P.S.  How did you find out?  Did he confess or get caught?|`|KqQlWbYsaa	Reading between the lines, I don't really feel that hubby is as much invested in this marriage as you yourself are.  Also, I think that on some level, hubby wants to remain in the marriage so long as he can continue to have affairs (with or without your tacit approval).<br>  <br>  I think that you should give hubby an ultimatum, for the simple purpose of clarifying just where all of this is going:  Tell hubby that he must agree tor the two of you going together for some professional marriage counseling together ASAP for the p;urpose of saving the marriage, or you will be filing for divorce.|`|a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	It feels so scary to you, the uncertain future without him. I was in the same situation. What I knew in my head most of all was that I couldn't count on him to ever be faithful again. I had given him my all, and my best and he cheated and was unfaithful and it sounds like that is the boat you are in, too. That has to be it for you now. The hardest thing is often the right thing. It is time to move on. You cannot make it work alone. Start walking in the other direction and that day when your heart is no longer broken is closer than if you torture yourself with empty, one sided hopes. Godspeed.|`|qBHjIrVHaa	Is he still in contact with this other woman?   He sounds like he is wavering, maybe still involved in the affair.   He doesn't want to face the consequences of his behavior, or he is being manipulative so you will not hold him accountable.  Hard to say.  <br>  <br>  Look into finding a counselor, certified in couples therapy and experienced with infidelity.  You need outside help.   A safe place to address the problems.|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	There is a little known legal doctrine called, Alienation of Affections, which may be used against the offending party in this case.

Perhaps you should see if he really wants to remain or is just looking for an excuse to hop on this "floozy".|`|FKR45WLPaa	It sounds as if he doesn't want to be forgiven, sounds like he wants out.  He is making up excuses for not wanting to save the marriage.  If he is telling you that it will go wrong again, listen to him.  He is telling you that IT WILL GO WRONG AGAIN.  Hard as it is, cut him loose.|`|wFtfOBzuaa	since I let god into my life my marriage has grown more than I could have ever thought and my wife has forgiven me for everything that i have done|`|RLoilwCNaa	There is nothing you can do. He will do what he wants. Sorry, but that's the truth.|`|1Y0yPiSvaa	I really do not want to be negative but you need to understand that both of you must be willing to make this work in order for things to function. It does not sound to me like your hubby wants it like you do. People make mistakes and that is understandable. When we hurt the ones we love we will do anything it takes to make it right. It sounds to me like your husband is giving an excuse for the marriage to end. He should be the one begging for a second chance if he really wants the marriage to work. If he is not willing to live with the risk of trying then I would not be so insistent on soothing him. Everything we do as humans is a risk.|`|d5eb8d58dc84e054dc3f0c879a471deaaa	I know a couple that went through the exact same thing! The husband cheated, the wife was very hurt. She was willing to forgive him and work things out. He decided he didn't want that so he left and stayed in the relationship with the other girl. However, that relationship ended up not working out in the end. The wife took him back and they went to counseling. It sounds  like your husband is infatuated with the girl he met and he has the fantasy of keeping  that going or maybe another one. It doesn't sound like he thinks he can be faithful right now to you or anyone else. Suggest marriage counseling? Or let him make his own choices  and if he decides to want to work it out later down the rd. then you have to decide if you want to do that.|`|zs3AThq9aa	First, give him the time he has asked for from you. I think you need to really think about his statement that he feels things will go wrong again. The wrong again, does he mean that he will cheat again? And he is right you should not be suffering because of him! Ask him outright if that is what he means and that he does not want you to suffer through this again. <br>  Second, if you do decide to give him another chance then you have got to go through marriage counseling. You have to find out what lead him to cheat and if you can really forgive him. <br>  Good luck to you!
Uj5kuzoJaa	If they aren't racist then you should be fine. They might have just been telling you what type they prefer you dated,  but I'm sure that once you tell them everything will be fine.

The fact is yes race maters, and the reason that i say this is because if it really didn't matter you wouldn't be asking this question.  You need to ask yourself does it really matter to you!  It matters to your family which will make things hard for you take it from me i married out side my race and it caused problems for a long time her family didn't like me for that and my family didn't like our marriage After time it goes away though.  Even Society still has an issue with interracial relationships, although its not nearly as bad as it use to be we as a human race are not yet ready to come together as one race so until that happens just know that race does matter and will matter, but its all about what matters most to you, if a relationship with him is what you really want and it doesn't bother you then go for it!|`|KCpGsN2faa	Why should race matter?

Second: Know what you are going to say to a girl and say what’s in your heart. Third: Smile and be confident.

Look you have to understand that as long as you are not rude or to pushy the worst that can happen is she say's no.  No is not a word that will kill you, just be yourself try it out and don't be so scared when it comes to holding hands and touching women need to feel wanted and that's one way to show them you want to be with them.  As for ppl not liking you well try letting more ppl get to know you don't be so reserved because then all ppl have to judge you on is their opinions.  It is hard to be 14 i understand that but i promise you that it never gets any easier if you don't have some kind of self confidence and no fear of rejection.  I have had more girlfriends and woman in my life than i care to count lost my virginity at 14 but i have also been turned down just as much if not more.  Sometime you just gotta go for it!

55f40ce05972303abf2ecdf6f5118432aa	Well, I think so. Once I was dating a girl, but for some personal reasons I knew I didn't want to marry her.  Each time I was with her, I had a great time. I enjoying being "with" her a great deal. She was a wonderful person in many ways.  I knew she was starting to fall in love, so I knew I had to do something. It was very hard, but when she asked me if I loved her, I told her that I didn't want a serious relationship just wanted to date around, and I didn't love her.  I did that because if I told her that I loved her, knowing I wouldn't marry her, it would have been cruel.  I never told her the truth, but we broke up on good terms, but don't ever talk now.  She was very nice and deserved someone who wanted to be with her forever coz that's what she wanted.|`|0ky4TktEaa	Yes. Twice. The first time, i didn't have to fess up; he wasn't blind and i wasn't really trying to hide it. The second time, i was just wierded out. I was dating a very close friend for the first time and wasn't sure if i wanted to take things that far. I fessed up when i realized how stupid i was being. I was completely crazy over this guy at the time and he was/is (hopefully) a good guy. I told him why and what happened and he said he understood, kissed me and that was that. Wow that was 4 years ago lol.|`|UjxSuFAbaa	yes i lied about it<br>  yes i did <br>  i lied because i didn't think it would help our friendship to tell them<br>  UM i think so ?<br>  Well they told me they liked me :)<br>  x
uPL3e3tyaa	Uncooperative women and exhaustion of patience.|`|vMKEg29kaa	Their bloody Nature.|`|jROpVbrhaa	Mant to mention, but i think this is the most common why they cheat. Not satisfied with partner during sex. Irresponsible relationship.lack o understanding to one another.|`|u1Oi6tGHaa	Probably the same thing that makes women cheat.|`|tMEUPBo4aa	I agree with, Slippery_Nipple ....<br>  <br>  BTW, all men have the ability to cheat. A man is only as loyal as his options.|`|tYnpVHpZaa	your mom|`|K9V2F33Jaa	If he's a sleazebag. Good men don't do that. Also, men that are head over heels for the girl they are with are incapable of cheating.

71VRvldJaa	Surely you realize that everyone you like isn't going to like you back....anymore than you're not going to like everyone that likes you!  That's life!  It's not a bad thing, it's a good thing!    It lets you know straight up where things stand so you don't make an emotional investment in the person and end up feeling rejected and hurt.  It's a weeding out process which helps determine who would be right for you and who wouldn't be.<br>  You're still very young at 17 and you've got lots of years to date and find "Ms Right".  Don't forget, it only takes ONE!|`|0fygxRHLaa	hey boo!  you so crazy!|`|msOABQbSaa	I've used that before, he was my bestie.  It wasn't anything to do with not liking him.  Just i'd rather have him as a friend forever than a fling for 3 months then stop contact after that.  Sometimes us women think more about the long term aspect of where the relationship rather than the now.
UjEAn0bWaa	Get the **** over it|`|LS8LcuRaaa	Don't send her a text message. She obviously doesn't care if she's not texting you back. So, sending an angry message will just be a waste of time.

d5zEYomEaa	I don't think he is cheating on you. I think he might be ashamed to be seen with you in public I am sorry to say (I don't know if you are overweight or look much less attractive than him maybe?). But for example you were shopping with STRANGERS around, girls he doesn't know and he started to act strange and distant and didn't listen to what you were saying. If he acts that way around strangers, then it's not suspicious for him to be acting that way around girls he knows too, it doesn't mean he's cheating with them but like I said maybe he doesn't want them to know he's dating you for some reason - maybe you dress sloppy or whatever it is. And many guys watch porn so that doesn't mean he's cheating, and the fact he's always asking you - why don't you turn it around and ask him? Based on how he answers you might be able to tell. Also, usually it is the girl always asking the guy and the guy gets so tired of being questioned that it pushes him to act out and cheat so it's strange that he's the one questioning you when you're not doing anything to cause suspicion. I think he just loves you a lot and is jealous if you cheat, but the fact that he's ashamed to show his love to you in front of others I think is a bigger problem, and the fact he asks you during sex is so wrong!!!|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	It sounds like he is with you but constantly looking for your replacement. You really need to talk to him about your observations. Also him always asking if you cheat is he don't want to share you but I am sure he would on you in a heartbeat.|`|92yiQo7uaa	Bethany,<br>  <br>  He has a porn addiction problem for starters. If you are some guy by  yourself and there isn't anyone around well I can see getting the trusty laptop out and checking out your favorite porn sites. <br>  <br>  But if you have a woman iin bed with you and choose porn there is most definately a problem. I believe it is serious and it has nothing to do with you. It is him. Why he choses porn is anyone's guess. Maybe because you are more of a challenge and his porn world is all fantasy and not much work there.<br>  <br>  Relationships are hard work and not all romping in bed. I feel by bringing up his old girl platonic friends and acting disinterested in  you in stores when other women are around he is trying to appear to be free to these girls. This is more fantasy than reality.<br>  <br>  He seems to not want to be taken when others are around and this is bad. He is at some level resisting the relationship.<br>  <br>  I think you need couples counseling and I think if this doesn't happen your relationship is coming to a slow end. It may be ending anyway. This guys behavior bodes ill for your future times together. It is not a good situation at all.|`|P5GhUEvoaa	He likes the girls but loves you,don't worry :D|`|55f40ce05972303abf2ecdf6f5118432aa	He seems embarrassed of you, but you're easy.  He will leave you once he gets a girl that he feels is better looking?  I think you should just break up with him.  Don't go into all the details, but just tell him you don't feel it's working out and you feel it would be best to move on.  Don't fight or argue. It is obvious that he doesn't love you if what you're saying is true.  I love my wife very much and I am always holding her hand no matter who is around.  He also seems very inconsiderate of your feelings.  Also, he seems so damn annoying.<br>  <br>  You're with a boy. Do yourself a favor and be single a while until you meet a good man.|`|dXAgTUSraa	I guess there could be something going on, what you need to do  is tell him look if you want to act single when other girls walk by or look at porn liike single guys do, then guess maybe you need to be single and just see how well you like it. Sorry to be so blunt but I have no remorse for people who don't respect their other halfs. good luck to you.|`|xqEOb4BXaa	hi you can try this one:<br>  dating-tips4you.blogspot.com<br>  it really worked for me|`|AA11136246	Seems like both of you needed time to be alone with yourself.  Sometimes being together all the time takes the excitement in a relationship.  Its like taking the same food everyday, you get tired.  Especially when it comes to male partners, they tend to look at others because they are infedil in nature.  He will only realize your importance when you leave.  Give him space and make him decide on what he really likes.|`|PTvXM5Qjaa	hey. i'm just 15 years old but i'm confident enough of what i'm going to say to you right now...... this is not actually the answer to your question but it is a solution to how to solve you problem.<br>  <br>  the only solution that i can think to solve your problem is by trying to drive your boyfriend into a corner. i mean, try to do the things that he do to you, like out of the blue, say some good things about your single best male friend or you ex-boyfriends or pretend and give him the impression that you're not that into him, you're not really fallen for him that hard yet.. and if you can, try giving him the expression that you want to break-up with him. yeah i also think that this is like overreacting but if he really really loves you, then he will do something to make-up with you right?? and by then, you can ask the questions that you kept within yourself because if he really treasures you and your relationship, he'll tell you everything right. try saying to him that a relationship is based on trust and honesty to add pressure to him that if he lied, you'll leave him. but if he really did break-up with you with no signs of hesitation at all, then i'm so sorry girl, but move on, he's not the right guy for you after all. he's not the kind of guy that's worth your time. find someone else. or better, that you let love find you.<br>  <br>  but if you cant do even one thing with what i just said, then i feel sorry for you girl. the first thing that you should fix is yourself because this is a sign that you're just afraid of rejection and you're really not compatible with your partner since you're not trusting his love for you at all. <br>  <br>  well, that's just what i wanted to say. good luck girl.<br>  <br>  and remember, true love will definitely come your way.<br>  <br>  and btw, i'll answer again. i'll explain other things. i'm just so sleepy right now after two days of almost no sleep at all because of school works.. night night.. :D<br>  <br>  hope this will help you. :D :D :D :D

Sure, it's good to find out some physcic stuff, but nobody really knows for sure which ones work or not. Well, some people do, but those people are hard to find. Besides, do you really care? Can't you just enjoy life how it is, and not worry about "Will I have 10 kids?" "Will I get married in a Church with pink and white flowers and blonde flowergirls?" "Will I work as a proffessional tennis player?" Sure it's good to get a rough prediction on these kind of things, but just live life how its suppost to be lived out. Just let things come naturally, and try not to worry so much. It will all come in good time. There's no hurry to find out everything about your future. It's there, waiting, and it's a mystery for you to discover. That's the beauty of it. Just be paitnet, you'll understand everything soon enough, and then you'll be wishing you could go back to when you didn't know your future, like right now.|`|1d7368f7c75bdd5ae5033f1f40dcc63faa	SHE is out there, and you simply must wait until you cross paths with each other.  You must be patient and wait for HER, because if you waste yourself on other women that obviously aren’t THE ONE, then you’ll ruin the unbelievably sweet opportunities that you’ll someday have with HER.  The wait will be sometimes painful, sometimes depressing, and sometimes sad, but SHE will be worth the patient wait.<br>  <br>  To make sure that you are prepared for HER and all that SHE desires, you must develop the character within yourself that you know that she’ll desire.  She’ll desire a man with integrity, respectability, intelligence, kindness, and joyfulness in all that you do.  You must study very hard.  You must pursue a quality career.   You must at all times treat people the same way that you desire them to treat you.  You must speak respectably and well.  You must take good care of yourself.  You must not be selfish or self-centered, but rather you must be humble and always thinking of others.  You must surround yourself with quality friends that are of the same outstanding integrity, respectability, intelligence, kindness and joyfulness that you desire to find within HER and within yourself.<br>  <br>  If truly you develop the character that SHE is looking for, then when you finally cross paths with HER, she’ll recognize you and be yours forever.  However, if your character is ugly, she’ll walk on by and you’ll miss the opportunity to live the dream that you truly desire.  If you prepare yourself well, there will indeed come a day when you’ll wake each and every morning thanking God for the unbelievably magnificent GIFT that HE has given you in HER.|`|xqEOb4BXaa	hi you can try this one:<br>  dating-tips4you.blogspot.com<br>  it really worked for me|`|owxYkIySaa	It all takes time..be patient.

Maybe he had just been comfortable before he moved, and had almost taken your presence for granted. Now that he has been away from you this long he realizes that he doesn't WANT to live without you, not ever. This is why the thought of marriage has "suddenly" come up. That and he realizes that he can't just expect you to uproot your life to come live with him without a very good reason (that reason being marriage). If he really loves you, he'll understand that you are not ready to give up your life to move down there with him. I think the better question in this whole thing is where do YOU stand? Do you want to be with him? If you were to find a great job in FL (which I'm sure wouldn't be THAT hard to do, even with the state of the economy), would you move down there with him and marry him? Or are you using this distance as an escape route out of the relationship? Did you jump ship before he had even left for FL?

H3WHxCgaaa	There isn't.  When you are standing outside under a trellis with blue skies above and sunshine everywhere - could you be any closer to God?  I don't believe Jesus would have said you HAVE to marry in a church...I don't believe God said that either.

It isn't fair to you to stay with someone you don't want to be with so break up with him and get it over it. Don't not do it because you are afraid of how upset it will make him. When he talks about loving you forever, that is him saying whatever he thinks will keep you from dumping him. He is trying to manipulate you and you're letting him. You can't do that. You can't give up your own happiness to make someone else happy. Breaking up with him will hurt him a little but he will get over it. People break up every day and they all get over it.|`|PHOyKsmPaa	You said it yourself.

But it sounds like you're past that point.<br>  <br>  He'll be depressed, I'm sure, but just like he found you, he'll find someone else.  If you want to help him get over that faster, let him know the kinds of things that he did that really upset you and helped to tear away the feelings that you used to have for him.  Tell him he needs to work on not doing those things will other women in the future, so that it becomes a natural part of who he is.  <br>  <br>  Maybe he's trying to make up for his mistakes with these gifts.  But you need to search deep down whether you are just not meant for each other and you're ready to move on, or you still have any feelings for him.<br>  <br>  If it's over, letting him know sooner is actually the more decent thing to do.  Letting him try to regain your love when you've already decided it's a dead end is just cruel, and infinitely worse than any hurt he'll feel if you end it now.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I know these are the difficult ones.|`|CwAhC38Uaa	You have to carefully sit him down, and tell him that your just not in the mood for having a relationship right now, and odds are, he'll say that he will wait, but you need to tell him that you just dont have those feelings for him anymore. It's not good to stay with him if you've lost feelings for him. I know how ya feel babe, it's hard, but you need to let him go if you dont like him.|`|oche3k5taa	If your not happy you shouldnt force yourself into a relationship.  Dont live your life to make someone else happy. Break it to him gently, and yes he'll be upset sure, but in the end, you guys obviously arent meant to be, and hes obviously just addicted to being in a relationship, let him know that he needs to care more for himself, instead of needing a girl around him all the time. and that its okay to go about things a little slower, if its meant to be it will happen.<br>  but you guys just arent meant to be.|`|w9mrFRJ2aa	You say its hard now to break up with him?  Imagine how hard it will be in a month or two when his feelings get even stronger for you.  The sooner the better.  That is if YOU are sure you want to end it.  Don't drag him along on a ride that is going to go no where.  It'll just make things harder for you and harder for him.|`|CUB3wUdiaa	well in my opinion if your trying to get away then you need to get away.  i know its hard to do that when you know its gonna hurt him but at the same time you need to look out for yourself more than him.  not to sound selfish but its the way it has to be.  he may be doing this stuff because he knows you want out and this is him grasping to hold onto whatever it takes.  take care of you is my final answer.  good luck and let me know how it works out for you.<br>  <br>  ray|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	If you aren't into him ...you need to break it off.

But he stopped after a while so i think you should. but how do u feel about him do u love him or do u love someone else or do u just want to be alone. im in love with the this man and he told me that he is asking me to marry him in july so i hope he still keeps that question because i love him.|`|i0j21gbFaa	Hiya, well first of all, it depeneds on how big you think those things were that were upsetting you! secondly if you feel as thought you don't love him anymore or that theres no chance of that love growing if you stay with him, then i would say that its pointless, you could always ask him for a break n say that you need a break to get your head straight... If you think you'll hurt him then let him down gently, no offence but you shouldn't stay with him if you think hes going to get hurt if you end it, the longer you put it off the more it'll hurt him... the sooner the better, easier said than done... Good Luck
YqBFguzpaa	Be careful that you don't end up hurting yourself more in the process. In my experience it almost never turns out well when people do this. If you're still hurt it means you still like him, so you run the risk of getting more attached again and really hurting yourself if you get sucked in.|`|MiKrWuM6aa	Hey, if you broke up, he is allowed to do what he wants in that time.|`|15e58edf21f33dd475298413b3cd6d8caa	say to him we r friends with benefits this is all..|`|oche3k5taa	Ive done this before.

Break it off and keep it off.|`|AP2e90cCaa	I think it's easier to just walk away from a relationship that keeps ending and beginning again. Obviously there's something there that's not jiving.

ozngXg9waa	It seems to me like you should have a sit-down talk with your parents about the way you feel. I don't mean a screaming match --but an adult conversation. If you are really in love with this guy it is worth a chance. however, you don't want to have to sneak around. A relationship with a real possibility to go some where is at least worth a serious conversation. The more adult you can be about the situation, the more your serious your parents are likely to respond. Address the 'why' of their beliefs and offer solutions.<br>  <br>  I believe that love conquers problems all situations. if it is really meant to be, then things will work themselves out. Just be honest with yourself, with curtis and with your parents. <br>  <br>  Lastly, do you see yourself with Curtis for a long time/ seriously? If not, you need to weigh the importance of pursuing the relationship over opening up a big can of race-war with your parents.|`|TDm6if1Zaa	Racism is racism.

Now with the first guy, I don't think he's the best choice for you either. You even said yourself that this guy is a player. What do you think he'll do to you (unless he gets saved and becomes a Christian and really wants to change his life around)?...he'll do the same to you. Just because you're in love with someone doesn't mean they're the right person for  you. Don't rush it. Also, you're probably used to bad things happening to you, therefore, you don't think you're worthy of a good future, etc. I know that change is always scary, but let me encourage you and tell you that you ARE worthy!! Just be patient and that right guy is going to come along. That guy will come when you lease expect it. Follow your heart and don't mess with either one of these guys, Where there is confusion, there is trouble. It's not worth it. <br>  <br>  Oh and just be careful about being with multiple men at a time. You might hurt someone's feelings or catch something. There are too many STD'S out there.

Do not let this thing bother you in the future.|`|ngaga3XQaa	as long as you feel like he interested and you and has nothing for her then i think you should go for it..!|`|6A954Ptdaa	If i were you i would give them some space. From what you say about the phone calls it seems they have some unresolved problems, or it could be the ex girl friend who has some issues and not the guy. It is hard. I would also speak to the guy in question and lay it on the line where you stand with it all, tell him 100% how you feel and ask him how he is feeling so that you know eactly where you are and where you stand.|`|JhfN4tLLaa	I think getting involved would be a bad idea, well, at least into the concept of diving into a relationship with him right now as I think the fights with the other girl probably need some resolving before he can feel comfortable enough to get into another relationship. However, I don't think there's anything wrong with you hanging out and liking each other. On another note, a very pro your side of the situation, she is in fact an ex, and there must be reasons for that. So, unless he's showing signs of getting back with her, I see no reason for you to hold off your affection. Just don't get yourself hurt hun :) Best of luck!!!|`|PlDiJFi0aa	Have a fight with his ex girlfriend and kill her.|`|6ppi5jeAaa	if he really likes you...tell him to get a new number and don't give it to her or her friends.|`|2LoOVBbxaa	Just hunt her down<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  or suggest a 3sum?
Jly7xMU6aa	sweetie when you put yourself out their you sometimes let in the good with the bad.  But ill tell you this Im she'll come around and finally realize that you're the better man and friend and that's all she needs. So no do not change your number but stick around and let her know you'll always be their for her no matter wat. Then sooner or later she'll come around.|`|TSmego9vaa	Young love is so hard. But your almost out of high school still,and will probably will meet a nice girl. Who will not leave you on the back burner.No girl or guy should be in a abusive relationship. But that is what she chooses. Maybe her mom should call the cops on him. She is still a minor. Be strong and if she really wants to be with you. She would be and not be playing games. Good luck
yW1XIxLuaa	yup..me too..at first,i thought he was jerk and like his friends but somehow he helped me in embarrassment moment..it was really touching and my view on him also changed..now,we r good friend..|`|jBk1b4r6aa	Yes. One of the best friends I ever had. We started out Hating each other. We couldn't stand each other always mouthing off to each other.....after we got to know each other things changed drastically.<br>  We are still friends 30 years later.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Oh ya. I hated this guy and he was such a jerk to me for 3 years and then I had ran into him at the pool and we actually had alot in common once we started to really get to know eachother. So my answer is yes.
Tl9bgQzFaa	I thought I was in love with him, but later realized it was infactuation. I also learned that I settled because my current situation or being a single mother and wanted a father for my daughter. <br>  <br>  Marrying your best friend may be good and bad it all depends on your relationship with them.|`|JDRj44xMaa	By definition of 'in love,' me personally, if I marry my best friend, I would continue to stay in love with him.. that's why I would marry him.<br>  <br>  Even if I don't envision having kids, I wouldn't mind going through all the struggles if I love him to the point where I would be happy to raise up mini-me's & hims. Ideally.<br>  <br>  I don't think I wanna have kids though, not now. That's why I think the more values we share in common, similar interests, respect, the whole deal- the more promising the marriage.|`|AP2e90cCaa	1. If I weren't in love with him than I wouldn't have married him. <br>  <br>  2. To be in love with him, he would have to be my best friend, which he is.<br>  <br>  3. Love only gets deeper as time goes on - of course we're still in love! If we weren't than we wouldn't be together.|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	16 years today and I'm still in love with her...so, yes...it can last|`|xNWqqlcYaa	you don't write very good questions.  just so you know.  hard to follow.  you must be 15|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I don't get the point of this question really. If you are in love you know that without a doubt, I am in love with my husband and he is also my best friend. I'm blessed to have him.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	1. Yes I was <br>  2. No I am not anymore and we're divorced<br>  3. I would not marry my best friend cause I am not physically attracted to him and attraction is primordial in the success of a marriage.
mPZmze1Naa	i LOVE broad shoulders, but no podge! i makes me feel protected and safe! Very sexy if i do say so myself, i am a sucker for them|`|VUxQRujkaa	DEPENDS !
UpRdvpmXaa	I'm sorry to hear this. It isn't easy to deal with details about your partner's past that aren't very pleasant. It would be really hard to find out the person you love had a past like he did and it would be worrying. I really can't tell what kind of person he is because he may have really changed in the three years he's been with you. It would also depend on his age. If he was in his early 20s having that kind of lifestyle (college years), then I would say he's put that kind of a past behind him. It also is good to hear that when you two started dating, he waited months before you two actually had sex...that really tells you something. He noticed that you were different than any of the others he's ever been with. He's more serious about you and knew he had someone special in his life. He waited until it was special for the both of you (if that's how it happened :) <br>  Sit down with him and tell him you just have to talk about it because it is bothersome to you. You just found out and you need him to set you at ease. I know my fiance kept on asking me what I had done with my previous girlfriends a million times before she was at ease with some of what I had done in the past (I'm still a virgin but certain things were done that she was not comfortable with). Let him know that you need this discussion and he may be uncomfortable discussing it but in order for you to move on you need to make sure he isn't still into that kind of stuff. It's important that you know if he is or not because if he is, he may do it again depending on his fidelity to you. If he isn't then he may let you know of somethings he may just want to do with you that he had done in the past, which kept him doing it in the past. Like asking him, "were there just things you liked doing with them (who he wasn't in a serious relationship with and perhaps had to find other women also) that you would like for us to do."  I'm not saying appease him but if he says he enjoyed somethings that you guys don't currently do (that are reasonable), then try it. <br>  <br>  I understand about it being a different lifestyle, it baffles me sometimes to hear about men being with so many women. I feel as though God made one woman for me and thats the only woman I want to share that affection with. Other people may not share the same views that you have and their past is their past...you just have to ask how much of that past will affect your future. Ask yourself if you can get over his number of girls he's had sex with and the things he did? Will you bring that resentment into your marriage? Can you forgive him and give him a clean slate? Also, Is he willing to help you through this? That's important to. He can't just spring this on you and expect you to get over it. He's got to be able to understand that it affects you. How would he feel if you'd told him you'd been with several men, including three at the same time. I'm sure he'd be upset for a bit. Just tell him you need ot make sure that this is in the past and that he only wants to be with you for the rest of his life. Tell him the traveling concerns you and you just don't want to be hurt. Its up to him to gain that trust back and up to you to forgive him. <br>  <br>  Good Luck and God Bless :)<br>  <br>  Similar story but two stories are never really the same...<br>  I had a friend go through a similar situation except he wasn't engaged to the her. He found out she had been with 36 men before him, which was shocking. He found he couldn't get over that number and with the upmost respect ended the relationship after 2 years of dating. He just really couldn't get over that number of men.<br>  <br>  <br>  Remember you have every right to feel the way you feel...no one can tell you otherwise. You just reassurment :)|`|bO2rzfISaa	He's not different. He's a dumb*ss for telling you. If this really bothers you (and I think it does based on how many times you've posted it) you should break up with him.<br>  <br>  My husband probably has a similar history. I couldn't care less. I have no issues with sex. If this is unfathomable to you, you know yourself best. I would suggest that you not discuss this in the future. Most people probably have more sexual history than you want to know about.|`|m81dfyOYaa	This is why I see no purpose is discussing prior sex exploits with current partners. My ex husband was my first same with me for him, nothing to discuss. My second husband was divorced five years before I married him, I was divorced two years and even though we have been married 20 years I've never felt the need to discuss what I did while I was unattached nor asked him if he had sex with other women. Put it out of your mind if you can and if he's good to you and you love each other move on with the relationship. Good Luck.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	I answered this before and i'll say the same. It's not your business what he got up to before and if he is good now he is married then i don't see the problem.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	wow seems awkward to be in a situation like this but give him a chance but don't let your guard down|`|Cwqkbp49aa	3 years of being with someone is a decent amount of time, but let's be honest.  Do we ever really get to know somebody?  Even when we're with them for 10 years, 20 years, or 30 years?  Sure, it happens and all works out.  But so many times it doesn't and I've heard people say "I thought I knew him/her..."; and these are long term relationships!<br>  <br>  In your situation, feel special he was open and honest with you.  If he wanted to hide this lifestyle, you wouldn't even be on here worried about it.  You wouldn't even know!  <br>  <br>  Even though you think you have a big problem on your hand, I really don't think so.  You have what most women want...communication from their partner!|`|pOTigVYPaa	You do have several issues here.? One is your issue of his being out of town on business; the second is his going to bars with single friends, and 3rd, your lack of sexual experience compared to him.? These are issues that you need to discuss with your fiance.? Tell him of your insecurities and ask him how he can help to alleviate them.? If these issues cannot be resolved, then I foresee an early divorce.? It doesn't matter how? much you love him.? These issues will persist on into marriage if not resolved before then.? If they can't be resolved, I'd suggest calling off the wedding. This may not be the answer you were hoping for, but it's an honest one.|`|FG2OQ1LQaa	It sounds to me like you are the one that may have stopped his old ways.  I agree that it is always better to wait but in his case, I feel that you would probably have less of a problem with him than with someone who was not active.  I guess what I am saying is that he did his little experience thing and he is done with it.  Leave the past in the past.  There is a reason you two fell in love and this is what you need to focus on.  He come clean which makes me think that he does want to settle down and make a go with a respectable woman and not just a "lay" so to speak.  You are not being unfair with your feelings, it is natural to feel hurt and deceitfulness but the way you both work your way through it will make you a stronger couple.|`|y4w6ybr3aa	Be gald that he got it all out of his system before he met you. He "sowed his oats" so to speak<br>  If he has always been respectful to you and never gave you any doubts before you knew his past, then try and let it go.Stop asking about his past if you dont like what you hear.<br>   I think it's nice he was very honest with you about his past. Trust him unless he gives you a reason not to.
POZvhqj4aa	say that you have to do something else sometimes|`|05367a0d7cefb29c0600aa24d75c941faa	Hi<br>  Tell him that u wanna do something else which will be fun..like playing video games..etc.<br>  Hope i helped you!=0)
bO2rzfISaa	Yeah, God loves the WHOLE world, including the gay people. Gay marriage, one person to another, is coming, so all those who don't support it due to bigotry better get ready. Pray about it, maybe. It's silly to try to scare people with group marriage. It hasn't been upheld, legally, when straight people tried to do it, so gay people won't be able to do it either.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	I doubt it but that never stops people from doing crap like that anyway.|`|rcut6bhoaa	No, i wont ever happen.  Tell your friend, grow up.|`|IvMPh09baa	haha... ok... are you serious?<br>  <br>  Based on your picture, I'm sure all of you jesus freaks are scared of anything that you believe is against your religion.  I suggest you face reality now.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I hope not - unless we turn back to God and go by his rules, those that engage in this kind of practice and call it "marriage" will pay for their disobedience.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Nope, it never will.|`|AA11336623	I have a family member who is in a "gay marriage".  I believe if you expand the definition of marriage (one man to one woman) in the name of civil rights, where does it stop? <br>  <br>  If a man loves more that one woman,  should not he have the civil right to marry them both? <br>  <br>  OR if two couples find they "love" each other intimately, don't they have a right to mary each other? <br>  <br>  You see how complicated this can get. Perhaps governments should not be defining "marriage"?|`|OLnmXeWDaa	I think gay marriages are inevitable. Watching their movement grow and progress is exactly like watching Blacks get their rights finally in the 1960s.<br>  <br>  There is no push for polygamy or any other changes to marriage laws. There are no politicians who would advocate for anything bizarre. <br>  <br>  People just love to try to scare each other with horror stories. It's easier to control people who are scared.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	Why not?.....not so long ago no one would have imagined a female would have the right to vote....or a black person would be allowed to the same right as a white.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	I don't think that polygamy/group marriages are a good idea gay or straight.|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	Yes, they will all be legal.<br>  And why shouldn't it be?|`|vvre3CUuaa	No.....To Redhead keep your bigotry to yourself!!|`|AA10204462	at rate this country is going it will soon be legal to marry your dog
f0edb72c8499f2a5207440633fb5d443aa	She's not ready. Ask her what her feelings are on the topic, you'll learn a lot. But don't ever ever pressure her, that'll only end badly. A baby is a huge responsibility and it'd change your lives...if she's not ready for that then she's not, and there's nothing you can do about it. It's a personal thing, and very important.<br>  <br>  And if you have a baby and she never really wanted it, it would be terrible for the child. There's more than one life at stake here, it's not something to mess around with.|`|19f24979d88417a252d6a6f960ca2b0eaa	Maybe she is just not ready not all women want to jump in and have kids it is a huge change.|`|96e05001c2508a1b088abc66046f05bcaa	talk to her...maybe she is still young, or just not ready for kids yet. everybody is different and trust me women has to be ready its better then having kids when u not prepar for them...|`|caa407a7466bfd14874e3c1fe2f4a198aa	She might not want a baby because she is not married.  I do not blame her and I am a guy.  If you want to have a kid, then you should marry your girl friend and have one.  My daughter did not have a baby until she was 30 years old.  <br>  You and her should sit down and discuss what you want, and each give your opinions.  <br>  Good Luck
8c162fd949031e359a692f2d98c7d1f8aa	because they're being selfish they dont have your best interest, just do what you feel is right. i admire you waiting, the worlds values and morals have gone down so low, this is how you can sort out the good guys who actually care and who dont, if they respect you thats real love, and if they respect your decision. if they dont. then thats no respect or love. girls like us gotta keep our morals and standards high now a days.<br>  Good luck and be yourself, be you, dont let them pressure you into anything. stand strong! :D|`|RYCBDqDsaa	because they want you to be experienced when they get around to you|`|CZrM6idFaa	Men are just dogs....Your are doing great, don't change what your said you were going to do.|`|MHwn4Tlzaa	While I will not encourage you to have sex and agree that you should wait until marriage for sex, I would encourage you to date.  There is nothing wrong with dating or kissing.  It's a part of the process to find that special someone.
POZvhqj4aa	if you like him and he likes you|`|ugmtF6Bsaa	Yes take it next level|`|g2QUNwZzaa	worry about now, dont worry about later. if u still have feelings when u move u'll find a way to see each other|`|yB6Vg65Daa	I think the best thing to do is take it slow. Like you said, if you're not sure then you shouldn't. Be sure about everything and then do what you think is best. Besides, you wouldn't want to regret anything. Look before you leap! Good luck!|`|05bf614d400b126e98a6f037a990f73aaa	don't do it, it will hurt both of you and end things bad. Why don't you get married prior to sex?|`|n7BuH75gaa	Live in the now. That's all you know about being sure of. Do what's good for right now, especially with affairs such as these.|`|SA6dCr0Laa	if thats the only thing stopping u then i say go for it.<br>  if its really meant to be, ( not meaning that u have to marry the person or anything) they will put in the effort to see u and vice versa. i dont think that distance should stop u from being happy.<br>  just ask urself  if YOURE willing  to put in the effort.|`|72895a389b784432eea922187fc22a83aa	I would not.  You will play with your own head like that.  Just do the things you need to do, the rest will become apparent when you should concentrate on relationships.

0AYPgUQIaa	You answered your own question. PIMP? Well if he was a pimp then he would beat you up and never would call you but yes, he is a jerk.<br>  A nerd pimp at most. :D<br>  Why do you want to stick to someone who can't undertake you in public?<br>  Don't you think that your recipient behavior is the partial cause of the problem? He behaves like a pimp because he knows that you will stick with him no matter what. Go on being cold to him and if he cares about you he will change his attitude real soon. If he is not, why bother?<br>  Thousands of guys are out there waiting for a chance to get a girlfriend and treat her like a queen.|`|V96p5opeaa	OMG!  are you kidding me?? He is a total grade-A butt hole!  Why in the world are you settling for this behavior?  You don't have a problem being last on his totem pole?   He asked why you haven't been calling and you said that you didn't want to bother him?  What are you doing?  Why didnt you tell him that you stopped calling because he's acting and treating you like a piece of crap?  I'm sorry but he doesn't respect you and you're putting up with it.  Why???  Where is your self-respect?  No boy is worth losing yourself.  Walk away from this and find another guy who will treat you like the princess that you are.  YOU are the prize! Remember that!|`|6febee8b4757d9cd4857176f7b29c818aa	Break up with him.|`|GUUa1s6Laa	Hmmm He's walking alllllll over you. And it's probably one of the factors why he's with you, if you developed a back bone and stood up for yourself, I guarantee it would not take you long to piss him off enough to find another girl.<br>  Pimp is definitely not the right word haha I assume you mean something like immature or chauvinist. But he is definitely a jerk. And you (or any other) girl does not deserve that. He is selfish and he is looking out for number one. And believe me, if he does not love you more than he loves himself, it will not work. (I had a boyfriend like that too)<br>  So I think it's time for you to move on, you should EXPECT random tokens of love, one phone call for him saying he loves you should not cut it. You deserve better than this man.|`|V5OYxIggaa	Ditch him asap.  He sounds lame.  If there are things you really like about him, go try to find a better version of him.  There are lots of other guys out there.  <br>  <br>  You seem like you are very hot and cold with him.  That's not a good habit to start.  You need to be confident in yourself and in your relationship.|`|hgmexwtEaa	it sounds like he's using you.<br>  <br>  you can either one: talk over with him how youre feeling.<br>  <br>  or two: break up with him, THEN talk over how youre feeling.<br>  <br>  but really, it sounds like he's using you and you dont deserve that.<br>  and you have every right in the world to be cold towards him.|`|Xw0pFjRpaa	he dnt desrve u, break up wif da jerk, dnt acept bein used like dat, u can do much betta than him just tell him ur fed up of bein used and that u need to get away frm sum1 hu treats u lyk ur not equal<br>  <br>  good luck, i hope u find sum1 right 4 u and hu treats wif da respect and da love u deserve
oTpkBS3Qaa	He's saying that you are worth so much more than him. He knows your interested so he's telling you that he doesnt think he's good enough for you. This could mean he likes you so show him that he is worth it and worthy of your friendship/relationship. Good luck.|`|AA10266072	Well diamond can cut glass.<br>  <br>  Maybe he's saying you'll end up hurting him.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	It means he's saying your far more precious than he is. You are a diamond and in comparison he is only glass.|`|AA11733625	I can't say what it is that he means... but diamonds cut glass... well known fact and so I am sure it is some sort of metaphore to say you cut him in some fashion...|`|51638188ba2e6707787cdceec069854baa	It means you're too good for him and deserves better.  Keep him as a friend.|`|1vG4wNhpaa	He thinks your too good for a loser like him. so he thinks.
bqkfu6Diaa	If you get stressed out daily, perhaps you need daily stress relievers. Sex works wonders for me. Maybe you two lovebirds should try that.|`|GLffLgFXaa	It's called sympathy pains. It's like when pregnant women feel sick or get cravings, and the husband gets the same thing.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	Haa haa the same happens to me and my husband.  We also have this weird connection where if one of us is stress when we are not together the other gets messed up too!!  Not sure if it is just a conicidence or not LOL.  <br>  <br>  All I can say is give each other back rubs and foot massages.  That helps alot!!  and hugs help too!
5d9211d38d6935bc0d08850b222ec434aa	Hahaha...trust me-he does NOT want to hear about that. My husband is always understanding when I'm feeling miserable, and makes me tea and locates the heating pad for me, but he doesn't want to hear the details-lol. But really, guys wouldn't be able to empathize at all, so there's no reason to freak them out with details. :)<br>  Totally normal. It'd be more wierd if he was actually interested in hearing about it.|`|666y2OWOaa	LOL, I like how you are honest! :)|`|EDCW5t9Vaa	of course thats normal he's 13 lol...some 20 yr olds still don't feel comfortable talking about it with their girlfriends. don't worry he'll get the hang of it.|`|v5QUvmnkaa	the comunication is very important <br>  <br>  good luck!

IT WAS A JOKE. He obv thought he was "close" enough with you to kid around on a friendship level. That's all.

I would also feel disgusted and repulsed by them knowing that they slept with somone that has also been sleeping around with other people. I would be especially angry if this has been a monogomous relationship and this person cheated on me. It's hard to have to go through the dissapointment of someone cheating on you when you've been faithful the whole time. And then angry to know that you trusted them to take care of both your sexual health just like you've been doing, and they went out and got them both this disease...|`|AA11806606	Your own stupidity for not using protection.

AA11292270	Typically no-fault divorces aren't "instant" unless both parties consent, and if both parties want out, why not?  For one party to divorce the other without their consent, there is usually a long waiting period, 2 years or so.   <br>  <br>  As to whether no-fault divorce is generally a good idea or not, you have to ask yourself what the alternative is.  The alternative is not to let people get divorced unless one spouse can prove that the other did something wrong.  This used to be how things were, and what happened was that (a) people stayed together, even though they were miserable or (b) people used the divorce system to exact revenge upon each other, publicly airing their dirty laundry.  <br>  <br>  I, for one, think that no-fault divorce is better than the alternative.  If people don't want to be married anymore, we, as a society, certainly shouldn't force them.  Marriage is meant to be a relationship, not involuntary servitude.|`|9e2130ec276925af9eb23573fa721694aa	No one plans to get a divorce when they're getting married. But I don't think there's anything wrong with having an option of getting a divorce if something doesn't work out. Marriage is not a prison, it's a free institution. Both people are free to choose a mate, and both carry an equal share of responsibillity for their choice. Just because many people make bad choices in regards to certain life decisions, doesn't mean that the government has to bu11 in and come up with draconian rules to enforce their choices. Maybe some people prefer living in totalitarian dictatorships where you don't have much choice in matters of marriage, religion, political affiliation and the like. That's fine, to all their own. No choice=no responsibility, it can be an attractive proposition. I certainly prefer the freedom of choice, and am ready to accept the burden of responsibility that comes with it.|`|698dd7ba4322c222f4f8f29c235822f5aa	In Alaska you can get a Dissolution--A mutual agreement to end a marriage, which results in the parties being divorced. Both people must agree on all terms regarding the division of property and debt, as well as the custody and visitation or parenting plan if they have children together. <br>  <br>  Very quick and not expensive.|`|AA11457426	Why do you think so many people aren't getting married anymore.
875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Yes, but you'll want to get that warrant taken care of.

NB4h4jTyaa	He's not being thoughtful, for sure - but you both have made the same mistake that SO many other married couples make: you didn't talk about your expectations of marriage once children entered the picture.<br>  <br>  If he was in the band when you met him, then you knew that music was important to him. Both of you should have discussed if he wanted to try to make it a full-time professional kid.<br>  <br>  You may have made the assumption that once you had kids, he would 'settle down' - but it looks like he didn't have the same assumption. <br>  <br>  Marriage is for better or for worse and a TON of tough choices need to be made for the good of your family. Right now, you're both looking at this from the "I'm right!" side and you need to see how you can come to some middle ground. <br>  <br>  I have many friends who are in bands that tour - most of them are married with babies. They usually tour on their vacation time that they get from work. I've never seen them be inappropriate with other women - in fact, I see them call their wives before and after the gigs. <br>  <br>  There is room for compromise here. I hope you guys can find it. Good luck to you!|`|AA10461616	I am mind boggled by all of this and don't understand what he is thinking.<br>  <br>  Financial- Is your income enough to pay all the bills for you and your two children while he is away?  Since he is quitting his job, I assume he has gigs lined up and knows what his percentage is and that it's enough for him to live on the time he is on the road and the rest will be sent to you to pay the usual bills AND the childcare you would need to get to continue working full time?  And is the amount he plans to send enough to not jeopardize a reasonable way of living?  Do you have health insurance for all of you since he won't have any? Those are just basic responsibilities of having a wife and family.<br>  <br>  The emotional part-  Does he not realize he will not see the 2 month old grow up?  Is he not concerned that you may need help raising HIS kids?<br>  <br>  YES, he is being very selfish.  Don't think for a second you are being controlling.  Men do that to put the blame / guilt for their immature behavior on women and this is the most extreme case of that I have ever heard.  When he says he was in the band before you and will be in the band when you are gone, what do you really think he is saying?  Sadly, I think he is saying he is leaving you.  He is definitely saying the band comes before you and his children.<br>  <br>  It is obvious HE is a child that doesn't know what he does want.  Married 10 years, had an older child, then decided 10 months ago to make another one.  It's not likely he just woke up one day recently and decided to go on the road with his band was his dream.  If it is/ was his dream, he should have told you that when you met or before you married,  since he was in the band then.  He definitely shouldn't have decided or agreed to have another child if he was thinking about doing that.<br>  <br>  Yes, marriage is a partnership between two adults that support each other.  Personally, I'd let him go and file for divorce based on abandoning his family and get child support for the kids if you can't make it on your own.  The courts will track him down and they will not consider being on the road with a garage band a real job.  He will be ordered to get one.  With a 2 month old especially, he will likely be order to pay you spousal support as well.  I am betting he has not considered any of those things.<br>  <br>  I would feel a BIT different if the younger child was not in the picture and he wanted to realize his dream IF he was talking maybe a 3 day weekend a couple of times a month to travel a few hundred miles with the band to see if they could be successful.  That would only be if he could keep his job here with a 4 day work week AND keep things like insurance and the difference in pay would not bust your family budget or if you happen to be wealthy enough to lose one income and not bat an eye.   A few long weekends on the road w/ the band is about as supportive as I could be were it me.  There is a MASSIVE difference in what he wants to do though, than just to have a bit of time to realize a dream.  <br>  <br>  You know in your heart he is selfish and that he has made it clear he doesn't care how you feel.  When one partner quits caring about the others feelings, when they are reasonable like yours, the marriage is usually already over in the most important way that counts- respect.  <br>  <br>  If he doesn't do it (go on the road) he will likely just resent you and blame you for even more than that,  just based on what you have said his attitude is now.  If you can't talk to him and he can't meet you halfway with something like the long weekends traveling with the band, I am always against divorce as a first answer, unless verbal or physical abuse is involved, but in this case, it sounds like your best option because he is likely leaving you anyway.  Yes, family comes first and it sounds like your children are going to be your only family if he does it, so make sure he pays for the responsibilities he is leaving behind.  Also, does he realize most bands don't make enough money to buy food/ get lodging while out on the road?  Does he realize that if he quits his job, not matter how poor or great it is, in this economy, there are hundreds of people that will want that job as soon as he quits.  It won't be there, or likely another real job, if and when he is making nothing on the road and wants to come home.  Maybe his band will make it really big and he will have to pay millions in child support? ;)  Sorry, had to give you some thought to smile about as you sound so lost.  Good luck and be sure to look after your own interests well being as he is only thinking of himself.|`|IvMPh09baa	WTF!!!??? Oh no, no no no no.<br>  <br>  You need to make sure he knows you are serious, I think he's trying to test you right now.  Because trust me, any man that chooses his band over his kids is in need of a big wake up call.<br>  <br>  Why don't you get a little more assertive with him, you sound like you are whining to him more than telling him assertively what exactly he is doing is absolutely no ok.<br>  <br>  I would advise you to be ready to set up a consequence if he chooses to travel with his band... seriously... if he goes, then whats the consequence?  Tell him... if you want to travel with the band and leave your kids, well then you can plan on not coming home to us at all for the next 3 months.... i don't know, whatever consequence you want.  <br>  <br>  But be more assertive and put your foot down, because i know i would not be ok with this!<br>  <br>  ADD: He doesn't believe you because you are NOT following through on any of your threats.... so why should he believe you if you don't do what you say you will.  If you want him to take you seriously, then take yourself seriously and start doing what you say!|`|pDrkcc6taa	He is immature at best.  You cannot change or mature him, you can ask to see an impartial thrid party for advice, if he is unwilling, than you will have a very rough decision to make.  Life is precious and so are your children, if he cannot see that than your options are limited.  Good luck!|`|YujjEUjEaa	need to be decided together. he is selfish and ignorant. unless they are really good, they arent gonig anywhere and will just ruin the famiy life and stability. sounds like he needs to grow up. he isnt a teenager anymore|`|pOTigVYPaa	Tell your husband that it sounds like he wants his freedom and you're ready to give it to him but it will cost him.  It's called Alimony and Child Support.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	Well of course family should come first. Your first mistake was to marry a guy in a band??? I know at first it's really exciting to be with someone whos in a band. But as we grow a little older and wiser, it doesn't seem so appealing anymore. I hear this all the time from woman who are involved with guys in a band???? I wonder what the attraction is when they get older??? I would never get hooked up with anyone from a band. And these are the reasons why. because they ALWAYS pick their band and their members first. And the reason why I think they do is because these people in bands have very low self esteem. So the attraction they recieve from the young little stupid broads is a HUGE turn on for them. They think they are hot sh*t, but the reality is they really don't feel that great inside about themselves. They feel like low lives. But the attention makes them forget all that crap. It's NEVER a good idea to get hooked on someone in a band. They are usually VERY IMATURE!!!!!!!!!!!!  As your finding out now. They will pick their band before their family or spouse each and every time!!!!!! If I were you I'd get out of this situation as quickly as I got into it. There is NO good future for you and your kids. You know it like I know it. So think about moving on with your life.  Thats really the only way out of this. And the next time>>>stay away from the guys who think their bad as*es!!!!!!!! Their not really. it's just a cover up to how their really feeling inside. In which is WORTHLESS!!!!!!!!<br>  OH OH someone in a band must of given me the thumbs down. Thats ok. I know it's just denial. Unless you did?? But again it's ok. You must be in denial too. get your act together my dear. Because your life is not going to be a happy one.|`|b24df69d84b8825cbad6921ea5cc6874aa	Let him go if you try to stop him he will regret it later & take it out on you & it will destroy your marriage any way so you won't win this one.<br>  <br>  You & the kids are going to have to either support him & let him try, or move on with out him.<br>  <br>  Men almost always get what they want no matter what the cost to others, sorry but that is the sad truth.<br>  <br>  You would think that with all the jobs people are losing he would want to keep his.|`|ZEitfScGaa	So his band is more important than his wife and children? Thats pretty sad. You need to be assertive with him and tell him how you really feel. Hes been in this band a long time it sounds like, obviously they are not very good or something would have happened for them already. He is being very selfish. Time to grow up and be a MAN, he has a family now which should be the most important thing in his life.|`|T2j7348Iaa	Your husband needs a good kick in the A__!  Nothing but immature.  Marriage is about giving and taking and even sometimes giving up what you love the most for those who depend on you.  He needs to learn to grow up or risk losing the ones he loves.<br>  ps.. you are not selfish or controlling.... family should come first|`|PMtqTW6qaa	a 1 and a 2 and a 3<br>  <br>  he is a selfish jerk. whats sad is that he will never grow up and could care less about the past 10 years. i was married to a female version of this. it just gets harder because they make you feel like the jerk. don't let him do it. you will hate yourself later on.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	have you considered joining the band?<br>  <br>  stevie knicks kept up with lindsay buckingham for decades that way.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Marriage is about give and take, sounds like he's doing all the taking.|`|NctuEmFKaa	Honey he told you that he would still be in the band when you was gone.  <br>  <br>  My advice is to give him some space, see if he realizes what he is going to lose.  If his attitude doesn't change then you can do better.  Let him go and find the great guy that is out there waiting on you.|`|rE9UfNeEaa	Miss Olive,<br>  For a husband to say the band was there before you and will be there after your gone sounds like he never made plans for you to be in his life for the rest of it..  I am sorry but from my experience when a man has his mind this made up means his priorities are else where!
AA12289063	No, your becoming one of the greatest men on earth and that is awesome. You care about her important features and that is what every girl wants. Good Luck and we are proud of you.|`|de5d77bc9a08dc40eab695c03f58069daa	No, your maturing.The things that interest you now are the things that really matter.You look at her smile,eyes and skin every day.Those are the first things you see when looking at some one.Your not a sissy you're a man that know what he wants|`|3948aaad1b0770529bf29f3d88f3f4c7aa	I went through the same thing while aging, the primary body part  of interest changed every now and then, I wouldn't worry about it.|`|7a73d9fa21e39f3a4ff5fd1ace9f29f7aa	no your becoming passionate, that's a good thing. girls don't like when all you look at are there butts.

If they think you're faithful to them, pick one. Why hurt someone unnecessarily?  Find someone who doesn't want a steady, stable relationship. Lots of guys don't want any commitment, find one of them.|`|c3023fd6250ccce24970be2b869e2b61aa	Yeah, that's pretty bad. You need to dump both of them and just be single. That way you aren't committed to anyone and you don't have to worry about getting caught.|`|17bba31defb7b1bc925729452d27c386aa	what you need to be is single and then you can have as many friends as you wish to do what ever you wish.
AA10252759	Well, depending on the relationship that you had, you are probably bitter that it ended.  It sounds to me that either you broke it off or they politely told you that it was time to move on.  Either way you are having a hard time dealing with it.  Cherish what you had and try to remain friends.  Just understand that it is over.|`|b6412737610809f2a1cb6327ddb67b5caa	yes
AA10346254	Young girls talk about that only to impress their friends and because they are under the wrong assumption that a big man will satisfy them. Women can accommodate any size and even the smaller men should have no issues if his girlfriend does her kegels. Sex is about alot of other things than that. It can be spiritual for some, kinky for others. Sex employs all the senses and lots of communication. Any girl who thinks that only a big man can satisfy her is has either low intelligence or too loose.|`|3e03cfeb1ce3e4ed640a6a1c7b02264caa	size does matter, we dont like those short, skinny little worms|`|AA11123474	I like em pretty big myself!!!

AA11475356	she is not sick, you will not understand now when you become in her stage then you will understand the value of real love|`|19f0ee3d72affb9c26ccc496ffc2db56aa	You need to tell her that you cant have her doing this to you all the time. Dont wait untill you are in a relationship and then she starts hating the person you are with because you could never man up and tell her yourself(I know you arent involved with anyone cause no girlfriend or wife would go through that crap with you) Call her once a week. Tell her that you dont want to hurt her feelings, but she cant just come running over when you dont answer the phone. She has to respect that.|`|AA10117437	You're a guy, aren't you??  My husband has the same problem.  He talks to his mother EVERY SINGLE DAY.|`|AA11097454	she s not ready to let you be "grownup"...........its common for a lot of parents to be that way........I m not saying its right.........it just means you re not alone in this type of thing|`|73ad08abec8f322fe42e078028a202b9aa	Sounds like you live way to close to momma? Know of any nice little places to live about an hour or so away? That will make it harder to run to the door when your phone goes un-answered. <br>     On the other hand, it's good you have a mom who cares, not everyone has that blessing.|`|AA11279152	I am the baby in my family at 42 so don't feel bad.  I lost my mother when I was 24 so don't push her away she may be feeling like she has no one.  Take her out sometimes just the two of you and reminise about old times.  How about a movie, dinner, introduce her to people her age so she can bond with them.   Talk to her and tell her how you feel.|`|AA12359999	Ask for your space and privacy and to comprise you call her every weekend and talk to her.|`|b05cb58330e80a2228f7b86c1d28532daa	you've got the solution in your hands, talk to her..you are not a baby anymore and what she does makes you feel as a baby...you've got your own life since the moment you've got married...and even maybe before...once you've got 18 years old...tell her that you still love her because she's your mother..but...she doesn't have the right to control you, your life or your marriage life...if she doesn't like it...it's not your problem..it's hers...sometimers it's so hard for some mothers to aloud their children "growup" ... instead of being a wife with thier own husbands..they act like a mother all their life...and even feel with the right to be there always..not even if you ask for it...don't be afraid of hurting her feelings...you won't...this is part of life matters...she needs to understand your current situation and her behaviour is not right...my last advice...move out of there..it seems like you live in the same city or neighborhood where your mother lives...in your case I prefer to have a good relationship on the phone with my family and some visits during the year..than a constant nightmare and invasion..besides I'm pretty sure that situation drives insane your wife also...so make it for you and her.good luck.|`|dc63f85c163bbdc91a5af0ba17765515aa	Move and change your phone # , tell her that her behavior is not appropriate and now you belong to your husband/wife and not her. Tell her there will be no more discussion about this and that she will be put on restraining order if she dont comply and then do it.  If you are really serious about this she will probly end up getting arrested. BUt you could just move away.  She is probly sick or thinks she owns you and is an abuser and you are her current victim.  She is able to manipulate you and threaten you with her behaviour if you do not do what she wants when she wants it.  Same profile as a battered woman's abuser.|`|AA11711450	I moved 3,000 miles away|`|eb0fa92b4a344d205e7cf5516af4179daa	Be honest with her and don't back down about the way you feel.  If you want your personal space as an adult you have to take it.  Your mom may be afraid of loosing "her baby" or something like that, but it's not your responsibility to make things okay for her.  There's no need for you to be mean or callous about the way you feel, just try to communicate clearly and neutrally how you feel, and the way that she takes it is up to her.  At the very least you will have maid your stand and been honest so that the next time you don't answer her calls and she freaks out, you can have something to fall back on, that you had already asked her to ease up.  Good luck, dealing with issues like this with close family and friends and be very trying on one's patience.

In now your in the middle of things. How dumb is that. You now need to let both party's know in tell them,  look I did what I could do, nothing I could do now, it's a Court matter. Next time stay out of things like that. 9 X's out of 10 she will go back in your the one there not going to like.

Best of luck!!|`|AA11541574	Well, since you're a kid there is no magic answer. You should probably find someone to talk to. Maybe in your church... I was in your situation once.

Her last husband was/is a control freak, never liked me, or anyone else that got close to her. I was always on the back burner to everything... The good news is, you're not going to be a kid forever, and someday you'll have your own place in this life. That's when life begins to turn around, and is really great! Just keep telling yourself that "this is the cards I've been dealt, and that it's not always going to be this way." Don't let your mother's mistakes make you bitter. I know this from experience.

You need to take your mom aside and talk to her about the way you feel. Tell her she needs to have faith in God(if she is religious), if shes not then tell her that she cant predict the future to say that shes going to be lonely for the rest of her life. If life with him wasnt easy before then theres no reason why it will be any easier now. Tell her also how you feel about it and that it would hurt you terribly to live with him again.<br>  also tell her that she needs to also think about you and whats in your own interest. apparently your mom doesnt think a lot before she acts....she married a guy because of his looks!!!! tell her she definetly needs to slow down and THINK THINK THINK<br>  and if in the end things do work out just hold on till your old enough to move out and live on your own, but watch out because youl definetly need to save some money and make some useful relations. Try to pay attention to your studies a little and if you feel like your friend doesnt like you maybe you should talk with her about it too, but thats a minor ptoblem, wait till youve solved the major one.<br>  Good Luck|`|9e13f34dd17d8d1100f3a4aa1ea2c6b9aa	Talk to a school councellor, or a teacher, or a minister... anyone who would be able to help you out.  Call Children Services and ask to be removed from your home.  It is not a safe place for you to be, and you deserve so much better than the living conditions your mother is providing for you.  You can also call the Kids Help Phone.  Please dont' harm yourself in any way.  And remember the sunshine is always shining above the clouds, even when you can't see its' light or feel it's warmth, it is there.  Don't give up on yourself. You have a whole future in front of you.  Things will always work out in the end.  In the meantime, keep smiling.. and get help.|`|AA11638134	Life is once...wanna enjoy...<br>  take up a family,a lover or a friend...pray..do good..and be happy..|`|AA12222234	i'm so sorry sweetie that you have to deal with this.....definately go talk to a school counselor...it will be good to get this off your chest.....tell your mom how you feel....tell her that you don't want her to get hurt and let her know that you feel this way.....you're mom should be stronger for you....and for herself...and not allow herself to be treated like this......and she should be there for you....this man isn't going to change...and if he does - she shouldn't allow him back until everyone sees a change.....you included......you have a full life ahead of you.....keep thinking about that.....don't ruin your life by ending it just because your mom can't see what she is doing to you.....stay strong....you're headed in the right direction from just writing about it....talking about it helps.....if you don't want to tell your mom how you are feeling....tell a counselor.....and they can talk to your mom....get you all together......<br>  take care sweetie....it will get better......

If you choose not to care about a person for this condition, then you are not only shallow or obsessed, but you are far from being in love.|`|b346cd49a54ca4cea341fbad877d5f1daa	you love them for who they are not what they have just consult a doctor and ask him/her to help you deal with so shouldnt listen to others|`|AA11355910	are you really so shallow that a skin condition is how you determine the value of a human being? or are you a sufferer of psoriasis/eczema that is being unfairly judged that way?|`|23108fe4a4a865838abc75560d21ee82aa	How SHALLOW can u be???

2021c62da959fb83b78dad453cdce43aaa	We are swingers and we have seen couples like this.  However, couples like this are very rare.  Usually when couples are swingers, it is so that they can enjoy doing things together either in a group setting or with one other couple there.  <br>  <br>  Couples like this are in what is considered to be an "Open Marriage".  An open marriage is where both people are allowed to sleep with others without the other spouse being present, or even knowing what is going on.  <br>  <br>  This relationship is even more unique because the woman here exercises her freedom to have sex with other more then the man does.   Often times when we have heard of this situation, it was usually the man that was using his freedom more liberally then the female.<br>  <br>  So, to answer your question, yes, this does happen.  However, this is a rare circumstance.|`|73379dc1f8c41f81eb66c1f2b7143f27aa	sadly there are alot the new fad is to have a whore for a wife.  me i'd rather not get any that get some and others get it too.  a man that swing most of the time is a weak person and starts a woman into it and she gets addicted to it like a drug.  but hey this is what most women wanted anyway right to be like a man lol the sadest part is your friend will end up with a very bad std like AIDS and get on medicare and hard working strong men like myself will have to take care of her but men like me are the devil i demand loyalty only to me and wont be with a swinger and most likely black their eye if mine ever brought it up to me plus take everything i ever got her and burn it including cloths so if anyone see a naked woman walking down the street she asked lol and to FemDoms i'm their worst nightmare|`|8142ed20e57332288c8dc8d51a118627aa	i live in the caribbean and get invovled with couples.

25fbc8af3ff6170192fe178347d6330caa	Um, ok. If a guy asks you out you either say "Yes" or "No" depending on if you are interested in him or not.<br>  As far as all of the other stuff you wrote, you won't be a young teenager forever and all of that type of crap will stop someday.|`|32c037d561e0d2c1833b8ce4efdf0a7baa	Thats why you only recieved one answer Way to Dam*     long|`|189233d5651c6d19d5903bb45454ecd9aa	Absolutely!  You should definitely go out with him.  He likes you, and it's all too rare to feel genuinely LIKED by a guy.  You're going in feeling good about yourself.  He's paid you a compliment by noticing how nice you are, and you should return the favor by getting to know him.  <br>  Sure, you're friends, but guys behave differently when they're with the girl they're interested in.  I think it sounds like fun, and even though he'll probably be really nervous and you won't be sure, you should go for it.  <br>  I'm 33, and have done my share of dating.  I remember being young and not being sure about these things.  Had I been more confident and more willing to just go with the flow and let myself be liked, I would have had even more wonderful experiences with some really nice guys.  My advice is to be pleased, put on an outfit you love, go have a good time with him, and take things SLOWLY.  Be sure you really like him, and give him a CHANCE to really show you who he is.  <br>  What have you got to lose?  Nothing!  It's only a date, and if he's a decent guy who's halfway interesting, you'll have a blast.  Just relax.|`|8cea6c5c6ba32406374ea2ecc2e27644aa	you need to make a choice. do you like him or not. and if he does ask you and you realize that you like him,but you're not ready to date. If he truly cares about you he'll respect you decision if you say that you just want to be friends or if you tell him that you're just not ready.

TSW4s1dvaa	Most people who don't know how to talk to someone are too busy thinking / overthinking.  The filter between brain and mouth is on superfilter. .

I told her that she needs to realize that boyfriends come and go but best friends go through a lot together and will be there forever. I told her she needed to figure out a way to have time for both of us or else maybe I wouldn't be there when her and her boyfriend broke up then she'd have no one. If your friendship means a lot to her then she'll think about it and realize your right. If not, she'll be regretting it later on when the boyfriends gone and she ditched you now you don't have time for her. What goes around comes around. If she don't think your important enough to spend time with then you're obviously not BFF's.

If she responds yes, then that's a good sign, if she says no, then who cares? at least you gave it a shot. So i suggest you take a chance and ask her to do something with you.

They can, at the least, point you in the right direction.|`|AA12151600	You might check into a restraining order.  It's possible that it may include harrassment.|`|AA11257512	I would make sure everything she is doing is documented.  Then I would talk to my attorney and see if he can do something about it.  Sometimes a good letter can scare the crap out of someone.  If that doesn't work, I would talk to him/her about getting a restraining order.  Your commander can also tell her not to call. <br>  But definitely get a lawyer.|`|AA12043469	First let me say how sorry I am that you are going through this after so many years. It is obvious she has a problem and can't let you go.You should talk to your commander and explain what is going on.Depending on where you live harassment and restraining orders are considered different.You should defiantly keep all messages and wright down everything she does.If things get to the dangerous point say you meet someone else and she goes after them you will have everything she ever did and you will have a great case.The best thing you can do is to never let her see she is getting to you.Stalkers thrive on it...Good luck I hope you find peace
00adf0e2a1868a7488b491fa6a6c2fe3aa	okay im not down for all of that but I do have some advice... You guys should try swinging..Its were the two of you get together with other couples who are interested in the same thing as u,  and you switch partners...for example, you with another wife, her with another husband.but u do it the same room around eachother that way u both know what went on and its alot safer then random men... Most of the time swingers will test for aids,stds, and other stuff more frequently then random people will.Its the safest way to have fun with other people without catching something...But for the record...I am not down with that!!!|`|3f51c064313c86aceaea8660e527b28faa	okay...you're cool and she's cool...just make sure the other guys are cool...don't let things get out of hand...she obviously trusts you beyond belief...this is a fantasy that few women will even share...go for it...if it's what you want and it's what she wants then the only people that matter are already consenting...be sure to run any names through any and all local court records...it's amazing what you can find out about people through looking up their pasts; you can also run their name thru your states DOC(dept of corrections); do all the homework you can...she's worth it...and don't be scared to have 911 on speed dial...that could be more helpful than you could ever know...also have a code word that only you and she know, one that will signal when she's in trouble or feels scared...make sure condoms aren't just "available", insist that they be replaced or the fun stops right there...|`|79f36302d148434c144d8434f468a8cdaa	Why did you even get married?|`|9127d6f3f733d60383f3f89cb1491a6daa	Ok.....uh huh......sure.................you sound TOTALLY single dude|`|d9558537580b7dc6f310938b31b484ccaa	Are you sure your ok with sharing your wife?

If you don't tell her, she'll be pissed that you didn't warn her and you will lose a friend.  OR you tell her and she will get mad at you because she thinks your just jealous and making up stories.  In turn, you will then be mad at her for not trusting a friend and hense, you will lose a friend.  Find the commonality in the two scenario's?  We guys aren't like this.  We are willing to listen to friends advise or atleast proceed with caution.  You're in that proverbial "Catch 22"... be a man and take the high road, atleast you will have common sense on your side.

All the BMs and all the GM are coming there for the weekend. We are all going to hang out during the day together (lunch, then maybe some casino time). After that the guys and ladies are going to split up (separate dinners and bar time). I think it'll be a nice mix - everyone's friends so we can all hang out together, then there can also be a "bachelor" and "bachelorette" party.|`|q72IYtWEaa	I don't see why not, that is what we are doing for ours. <br>  <br>  I hear it is the modern thing that a lot of people are choosing to do. <br>  <br>  We don't feel the need to go out and be all "wild and crazy" with our friends, we just want to celebrate our engaement and life together with everyone. Besides isn't a bachelor party all about that being your last night "free"? We haven't been "free" for years and feel this would be better for our purposes. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|N1ay8hzFaa	Sure, if that's what they want. You also have to think about the guests. Are they going to think it's totally lame? Maybe part of the night could be spent with the two groups together and the other part could be separate.|`|CkN4pgpCaa	Couples can definitely have the party together, however, having them separately is sort of the point of having them in the first place.|`|ZkeoRyy3aa	ya we are combining wedding parties and hitting the town!  It is going to be a blast, and we are really looking forward to it!|`|AA10378030	Sure, it will be fun. The more the merrier!!!!|`|9tf9VF9naa	sure. if thats what they want.|`|DCXss6Odaa	Should they? It depends on whether they want to or not.<br>  <br>  The idea of a bachelor party is for it to be seperate though.<br>  But yeah if you want to, go for it!<br>  <br>  I just don't feel the same way when I go out with my man and all his mates, me and my girls have a much different attitude when we hit the town! : )|`|55zWUXcUaa	The couple should do what ever they like.  To me it isn't a question of whether the couple should or shouldn't have a joint party.  There is no right or wrong answer they should do what ever it is that they as a couple and individuals would be happy with.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	I think it really depends on the couple and their own thoughts on it.  <br>  <br>  My husband didn't even want a bachelor party but did end up going bowling and to the casino with his buddies.  <br>  <br>  I had one that was well planned.  Me and all my BMs and a few other friends just simply went to the bar that we all hung out at for a long time....and drank ourselves silly.  We didn't do any of the "games" or anything like that.  It was very simple....it was just us having a normal girls night.  It was PERFECT.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't have minded having a joint party.  We did consider it, but in the end decided against it since over the course of planning the wedding in six months, writing a master's thesis for him (I helped with research, etc) and the holidays, that we didn't really have any time with our friends.  So we decided to make it our seperate nights since normally we have one night a month to go out with friends seperately and hadn't been able to in about four months.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	If it is what the couple wants, sure.<br>  Should it be forced?  No.<br>  <br>  My fiance has a 'guys weekend' trip every year and this year the best man asked the guys to turn it into my fiance's bachelor party weekend.  I wouldn't crash it because it is the 'guys weekend' trip to start with.|`|sGP6s7uraa	That's kinda what we're doing.  At mine, for the first 2 hours, though, it's gonna be only for the girls.  At his, the first 2 or 3 hours are reserved for the guys.  My fiance and I did NOT plan it this way.  This was our friends' group efforts to make it a huge party for everyone.|`|21cf999bfe54057972e1de48b7cd2cf3aa	Some couples don't want to have the wild and crazy nights usually associated with bachelor parties, so sure, it can be a fine idea. Especially if they share most of the same friends.
YtSGbYqEaa	she needs to get out now its not gonna get any better for her she needs to think about the baby....nobody should have to put up with being treated like that|`|GhLEsDwwaa	umm   yeah she definatly needs to get away from him. if he is the controlling type sometimes it can lead to abuse  physically or emotionally . hope i helped=] good luck
LGCLmUTnaa	Maybe he was just shocked to see you, maybe he was just caught off guard and didn't know whether to act nicely to you or what.|`|zrARzUTPaa	sounds like awkward turtle to me|`|MHgTA9Buaa	most likely he didnt mean anything by staring
bcecbb87003a311cb14441278317dbdcaa	Most swinger clubs have voyers.. it is ok to go and just watch|`|2021c62da959fb83b78dad453cdce43aaa	Yes, we've done it before and it can be VERY exciting.  If you're interesting in doing something like this, the first thing that you need to do is to establish ground rules between the two of you.  For example, if the two of you are having sex next to another couple and the other woman reaches over to touch one of you is it OK? or if the other man reaches over?   Take some time and think about every possible thing that could occur or that you would like to see happen and discuss the rules between the two of you.<br>  <br>  The next thing you would have to do is to find a club where this happens.  In some states, doing something like this is not allowed on public property.  However, there are other places where it is.  When looking for a club, you are looking for an "On Premises" club.  This is where the sex occurs at the club.  If you go to an "Off Premises" club, then the couples just go there to meet and have to go back to a hotel or house to have sex.<br>  <br>  If you can't find a club where the sex occurs right there, the next best thing is to find a group that has house parties for this.  Again, you would have to establish the rules and stick to them, but it's in someones home and not a business.<br>  <br>  The best place to begin your search is the NASCA website, www.nasca.com.  They give club listings for all 50 states and around the world.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|f50ecca419a8cc01a89201625cfcabe3aa	Trust me you dont want to get into doing this!!!! That all I have to tell you. It is not as good as it sounds. Its gross and not what a married couple should practice.
0ba8c5107649cf6c164cda5bf5ca5198aa	It hurts a little bit, probably less if you don't have a hymen. It hurts less than period pain.<br>  <br>  Ask the guy to go slow and gentle, make sure you are nice and wet, or use some lubrication. The guy should stick it in bit by bit, while you let him know how it feels.<br>  <br>  If you feel a really bad pain like you're going to be sick, or you bleed heavily, or like you're going to pass out, then you have to stop completely because something is wrong. But that hardly ever happens.|`|52e652db558882d02acf765a4bbeb51daa	Yes it will hurt the first few times. So even if your hyman has been broken your vagina muscles have to get use to penetration because not only does your hyman get broken but your muscles have to loosing up. The only way you can pass this stage is by doing it a few more times. If it is just that uncomfortable then use some K-Y jelly to help ease the pain while he is going in and out, but until your vagina gets use to penetration there is nothing you can do. Good luck.|`|40566b0e49b9be41eed52308b76a339faa	Relax and just do it..oh its called Foreplay try that too|`|AA10493431	For ppl who physically works out every day, the have a chance of not experiencing that much pain.|`|AA11732640	yes it does....|`|f5fa746918a4925904396957214d3a3eaa	it dont but it uncomfortable the next 2 times man its like so awsome|`|1d565639d1f27c49bc31db197922932aaa	I have no clue but i herd it hurts|`|4c83397238207ad85467a1bb11c518e7aa	Try foreplay, it loosens you up and then it doesn't hurt as bad during your first time and chances are, your hymen will break during the playing part and then, when your loose and all that good jazz, sit back and enjoy the ride, because it only gets better afterwards. ;) Have fun! and no, I don't think your too young to ask this question. Age is no boundry to the curiosity of the innocence. By the way, I'm only 17, not some freaking 66 year old. So, yeah. Chill. lol. IM me if you have other questions though, I have no problem answering. As you can tell. lol.|`|8023a49c9f0f454eb89b2991567c74f6aa	yes it does and arent you to young to be asking this .... go ask your mommy|`|996b97b62fc074cc60ee2bb4500057f4aa	wellit might what if the guy has a small d***?|`|AA10321454	if ur hymen is already gone it will be discomfortable but not hurting because ur hymen is already broken.|`|c782a2a580e74d834e473fbad9b78b67aa	yes the first time typically does hurt usually mostly because a guy doesn't really know how to help a girl trully relax before sex. if your guy loves you he'll move slow and careful but it will always hurt even a little no matter what.
40daa5aacfbc0d75f1424a688681782faa	just an idea...<br>  <br>  leave her an email saying i respect your wishes and i'll try to help fix whatever the problem might be...then back off a little...and see what happens. after all if she's still considering dating you she obviously just wanted some more space than she already had. however, don't make it like a total cut-off because that obviously would make her think you're not interested or something or met somebody else...<br>  <br>  ...so tell her you love her again, tell her you miss her and you're willing to try and work through whatever it is that is bothering her (you've probably said all this already) DON'T get mad OR accuse her of anything ORRRRR get defensive and be like well it wasn't my fault, if you say anything say you don't know what you did, but even that's not ideal. <br>  <br>  I hope it works out and that she finds out what she wants. i think she's probably just having a crisis of confidence and has to figuer out how happy exactly she is with her life before she makes a decision that might affect the rest of it. don't worry. if she loves you she'll make the right decision. <br>  <br>  good luck ^-^|`|098adb46f0897a865132593a1944bcb5aa	she jus need a little time to herself.she'll come back around.|`|c4cb68a0afff60cf3d43f104720e32edaa	she has made her break from you and a fresh start. i think its time to move on. she is saying a few months so it gives her time to start her life over and for you to forget her. read tips on relationships and more to help you on this site|`|50073dbd5ecac430d78adbf7aa450341aa	Well, it appears to me that it is over.  However, what happened to cause the situation to happen in the first place?  Have you tried apologizing to her?  Perhaps you should give her her space right now, and let her make up her own mind.  Love does mean letting go and knowing that she will make the right decision, even if it is not the one you want.

HEEXkiihaa	hmmm ..sounds like a lover's quarrel..having some breathing space may be good. But then again it depends on how angry is your girlfriend. If words are spoken during the heat of moment, it can usually be dismissed. If she is calm and tell you she wants to end it then you are probably in trouble.<br>  Try sending her some of her favourite flowers and tell her you love her.<br>  It might cool things down a little. Every girl likes to know they are special and loved.<br>  I wish you all the best and hope that you guys can patch up.

Dating is meant to find out if you are compatible or not. I have gone through this with a few men who've treated me good but it just didn't sit right in my stomach. And when I did finally date my husband. I pretty much knew!!<br>  <br>  Don't delay in breaking it off, it just makes it more nauseating. Be kind and try to explain that you plainly don't feel you two are right for eachother, and assure him he's an awesome boyfriend and a great man and he will be a wonderful partner to another girl.. it's just not you. It will hurt him a bit, but it won't tear him down :)<br>  God bless|`|p1gzHgAraa	yes you should break up with him. its not fair to string him along, and quite frankly youre just wasting your time. i would do it in person (do not chicken out and do it by text or phone-thats just cowardly). just sit him down and be honest-tell him you think of him as a great friend, and would like to stay friends but that you just dont feel the same way he does.. and apologize. <br>  <br>  he may get upset, but just give him time-he may get over it and want to be your friend, but if he stays angry just give him space and respect the fact that you hurt him.|`|HfZeQR4Aaa	Please break up with him. Maybe the two of you are not that compatible. He needs to be with someone who understands and wants his kind of love. Please do not prolong the inevitable. You will hurt him more if you wait. It seems like the two of you are on two different levels. Breaking up is hard to do but you must do it.|`|SceQNNDbaa	Yeah you should, if the sparks not there anymore. Theres no point in staying in a relationship. Plus if you do stay with him it might hurt him more later on.|`|KYTi57Luaa	Well I dont think it would be very good to break up with him out of the blue...just try to make up an excuse to break up with him.|`|A3AKLHz6aa	don't live a lie its not nice to string somebody along be straight up with him he will respect your honesty and you still might be friends|`|KJmuHxcCaa	Break up it would be worse if you kept dating him. So it will be better for him and you.|`|wfmreO95aa	yes, tell him that you just dont want to be in a relationship with anyone right now. but make sure you let him no he didnt do anything wrong|`|IMPh53Ssaa	yes|`|LBjBMFn8aa	Hey Girl. this same thing happend to me last year. we dated for 3 months and i jus completly lost intrest. i didnt wanna break his heart but i did. and then he went out with my best friend and it buged me so bad. i wanted to jus tell him sorry and go back out with him cuz i actualy realized i did care about him ALOT. well they broke up and about a month later we started talking agen and got back together. it was AMAZING and we lasted for over a year that time. we broke up agen and now he wont go back out with me becus i broke his heart to many times.........so think really hard about ur answer and tell him u need a break to think about things. but dont make the same mistake i did. cuz trust me it hurts really bad so thing really hard about it. i hope i helpd ya babe! bye!! and good luck!|`|856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	Break up with him.  He will get over it..and move on.  You have to think of you, and your happiness.  You can't stay in a relationship because you feel "obligated" to it.  He's gonna be fine...don't worry.<br>  <br>  Kelly|`|MMVY6nodaa	You no its your choice on what you are gonna do but if you don't love him anymore than just break up with him.  So yeah.
ON84EQaBaa	you should not change you position because of him, sounds like you enjoy the work  that you are doing. don't be anonymous you deserve the right for people to know you're doing this paralegal work, it could help you in the future,  if he continue  harassing you tell him you're going to tell his wife, or contact the police. if he's been suspended from the country club people know how he is so they will back you, save all his texts so you have proof of these things.|`|P5SftXVxaa	my sister went through the same thing if he doesn't stop then report it to the police. or you can always tell him to stop.  my sister kicked his butt since he didn't the funny thing is that he was 30 and she was 16 i hope this helps|`|v1miGNhJaa	if you can work without him knowing great<br>  let the others you work with know what you went through<br>  good luck|`|9oMXpS05aa	i would relay the same information you posted here to the person in charge of this new volunteer work you've been offered.  i imagine that the type of person that does such good work for animals would not knowingly employ a person like you've described. perhaps they will find a different attorney.<br>  if it doesn't work out that way, you could start the volunteer work and if it gets to be too much for you, simply advise your supervisor that you would prefer not to work w/ this man for the reasons you've already advised them of.|`|M7365DToaa	i think here you need to put your own interests and well-being first. Think about it, if you're constantly worrying about him and whatever he might do, are you going to be able to work to the best of your abilities? wouldn't it all be an exercise in futility? obviously it's your choice, but if you're under that stress you may end up making a bad job of things.<br>  <br>  He's the bad guy here, not you. don't put up with it, try to stay away|`|GV3D4RLraa	What should I do? Deal with the pervert like an adult and tell them to stop bothering you or toss a bucket of ice water on them.<br>  Should I be the bigger person and put our past behind us for the animals? ... I don't wanna know about animal involvement. Ew!<br>  Should I do the paralegal work anonymously? No, stop running like you can not stand your own ground. Stand up for yourself to jerks. He's looks at you funny, give him the finger! Hells Yeah! Woo!<br>  I could really use advice from both men and women. Why, aren't you one or the other? I'm guessing you are a cross dresser by how you put all this noise first before you care so highly about yourself. That's cool though, unisex bathrooms look cool on TV huh, Alley McBeal?|`|kpKBwOcnaa	Female - Depends on whether or not you can handle this or not, you already stated that your last encounter with this man actually lead you to needing a therapist. Has your coping ability changed since then? Or do you feel the same as you did before. <br>  <br>  Also, what does this post mean to you? How important to you is it. I think there is a line of questioning to ask yourself before you come to a decision about this. My gut feelings says don't do it! just based on the vibes I am getting from your post. I think you still have unresolved issues with this man and I don't think you feel capable in dealing with him and his habits to harass. At the end of the day, can you cope with this man if he starts to harass you again, or when he recognises you goes for the jugular to cover his hind? or do you think it may lead to you being back in therapy again. Consider your health, there are many organisations you could work for not just this one, or you could bite the bullet.... all depends on how you feel!
NqbBjS0raa	It depends if you saw the problems in the first marriage that prompted its demise. Repeating the same mistakes with a better choice and maybe being in love with a caring person does increase the odds. Maybe you will have to soul-search your decision with this person. Knowing him better and what he is truly like as a person. The number of failures will continue if justifications for better thought out choices improve your longevity in the marriage. I know of some people that change partners too frequently and easily. Must have a different priority on what constitutes a partner.......(good luck to the 2nd time around and to your choice...)|`|GfGRj3Y0aa	it depends.  you can learn from your mistakes, but what the person you marry has not learned from their or what if they were never married before to learn from their mistake.  marriage is what you make it, so hopefully the second time around to make the most of it.|`|TKNPveHDaa	It's better when you're with someone you love and trust and they love and trust you.<br>  <br>  I got married to one woman, I'm still married to her, and I want no one else.|`|X6aYVpU3aa	in some cases but not all.|`|v2a220YWaa	I haven't gotten married a second time, but the statistics say second marriages usually end in divorce.  I hope this isn't the case for you. stay in love, and good luck!|`|eIov4OnPaa	I think it depends on the persons involved. I have only been married once but I just feel if it's working for you the second time around than keep at it. You probably learned from your mistakes and thats great!|`|Pwybznsxaa	I don't believe in 2nd time around marriages unless that person is a widow/widower!|`|RcVM06T3aa	yes!!! im a kid and my parents just got a divorce and the guy she is talking to is so cool. its especially better if your spouse treated u bad or just didnt really like him.|`|7foornMVaa	I also think so.  I just think that we know what to expect this time around and we are much smarter. <br>  I think this time I made my choices with my head instead of my heart.|`|paerqxfMaa	Sometimes it is - sometimes there are people who just should never be married.
fpGroPpzaa	No, as long as you understand that you might be calling her too much. Try and make your plans before the phone conversation, but since you let her pick the place (not a good idea, just do your research and find the place on your own next time *google maps*) you had to call her multiple times. Call her right now, set the date and don't call her again.

Get a hold of yourself , you should have better discipline. Don't ruin it, I tell you no lie the worst thing you can do is jump someone who isn't ready. It will totally destroy the trust . Why don't you talk to her about how you feel. My boyfriend when we were just friends never let me see him sweat. I knew he wanted to be with me but he never stressed it he remained cool and collective at all time until I made the first move. I Loved that !|`|AA10252759	All good things come to those who wait.

YbwDFvEaaa	It could be that the initial novelty of the relationship has worn out. It sounds like he was almost overly-clingy at the beginning of your relationship, and keeping up that sort of pace is difficult and also pretty unhealthy for the duration of a long-term relationship.<br>  <br>  If you're still seeing each other every day, I wouldn't worry too much about it. That's still seeing each other quite a bit.|`|7fh3JCVxaa	its always exciting at the start but you do get used to things. and when he sees you less, it is often more fun when you do see him. its not weird its pretty normal, stay with him as long as youre both happy :-)x|`|VZVGXRyraa	He could just be coming out of the "honeymoon" phase of your relationship. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It just means he's becoming more and more comfortable with where you two are at so he doesn't feel the need to romance you as much. It happens with a lot of guys.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, he could be loosing interest. <br>  <br>  Only he knows what he's feeling. Sit him down and talk to him about your worries and see what he says...go from there.|`|UhnetgNkaa	he could be loosing interest or else now that he has got you there is no need to be clingy seeing as he realises you are the one for him.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	The honeymoon period is over.

It is the time after the question has been "popped" and the woman has agreed that you plan the wedding, and prepare (hopefully and maturely) for married life.  Some couples that have been sexually active together before the engagement will abstain from sexual relations during this time, "saving" it for marriage.<br>  <br>  This is what engagement is.|`|978614de9f94d80e5d615594994a8759aa	Its just the next commitment level on the way to marriage.|`|ba8a0101a4a5167ad52000cfe72e0bc7aa	Being engaged I see as just tradition and the start of planning for the wedding. <br>  <br>  Generally these day's people become engaged after they're already 100% commited to each other...<br>  <br>  I reckon living with someone is a bigger commitment than being engaged...
e91076528be8b45e18ca2ac178db5acaaa	Anyone who has the best intentions for you will never pressure you into anything, especially sex. Two weeks is too early to say for certain whether or not you will stay together. Take it one day at a time and don't rush into anything. The best way to tell if someone actually cares for you is to withhold sex and let them prove their feelings for you in other ways. A guy will tell you anything you want to hear if he thinks it will get you out of your pants and into bed faster. Sad but true.|`|c52d6e6e32d2971c91d282859069c82daa	do wat you feel is right, I think you should wait awhile longer, but like I said, up to ya.|`|265e9d2198708a90be686201e046532eaa	I am sad to say it sounds like he is using you. It is easy for a guy to tell a girl what she wants to hear. I think after two weeks it is to soon to be having sex anyway. You need him to respect you and he isnt doing that by pressuring you. having sex is a two way road and you need to guard yoursellf until you are fully ready and not do it with him until you are ready. I would say find a new guy! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|301e7e0e807dffc27869c1ea860db1feaa	this all depends on your weight|`|GkrsS1JYaa	First of all you really can not say that you love this person that you have only known for 2 weeks. 2 weeks is  not enough time to get to know anyone.

I think you should talk to her in a sweet way and tell her that you know both of you get really tired after work and you miss her cooking so you would like her to cook for you on one of her days off like two big meals and put it in ziplock bags in small portions in the freezer, it last for months and if she cooks 2 meals at a time she will have different thing to eat everytime she is too tired to cook...just put it in the microwave and serve it. and you cook for her or buy her food on your days off and  that way she still has one day off for herself.

I would say go ahead and wait but no longer than 6 months. After that things tend to cool off and i just don't want to see you sad.|`|uhN7WmXhaa	If he really loves you,it is worth waiting.|`|nZgZWrGWaa	if he deserves it...and u really love him, then go for it....there are no deadlines in love.<br>  Just remember, the fact that u wait doesnt mean he will or has to.|`|s7seaaPkaa	depends on alot of circumstances<br>  *is he a good guy<br>  **do you truely love him <br>  ***is he even worth the wait.<br>  and so many more|`|TQLWJEKyaa	do not wait for anyone,be yourself do u if it's meant to be it will be.|`|QyXjTX5caa	If u really love that gut, u probably can wait for the rest of your life...'cause u'll always love him...:)|`|IgEYfBPJaa	Depends on the situation, if you really like each other then nope :)|`|pyzd6yEYaa	depending if he will wait for you as well and if you know you both are in love with each other|`|m2PywmHBaa	i dont think so if you love him then t is worth the waitp.|`|NidCYkGpaa	It depends if you turst him or luv him......and i cant say yes or no cuz i dnt know the story??!!|`|NdwTNVPaaa	if you love him jost wait|`|Ua7y7ynzaa	it depends.. but it all comes down to one question.. like T.I says<br>  <br>  "Is U happy?"|`|X51MqWhhaa	its not bad, but is he committed to you? are you guys dating i mean? because if ur not and there's nothing stopping you guys from getting together besides his stubbornness then yes...its bad, it means hes playing you.|`|agT8d1d0aa	no you wait as long as you want if he cant then you send him packing
1poSSvTdaa	Yes, because you are making him a bad person. being unfaithful is not clever, or smart. You will end up destroying his new relationship, which may make you happy but will make him and his girlfriend sad. That's not what a real friend does. Would you like it if it happened to you?|`|utGddhnVaa	your asking for headaches|`|IPS3hWweaa	If you enjoy it keep doing it. There is nothing wrong with doing something that brings you pleasure. Just realize that because he is in a relationship then you are bound to get some heat from people. And he is the one who is in the wrong, especially if he promised the other girl exclusivity.|`|Un9CElCaaa	i cant wait until karma hits u hard|`|XXbZAriNaa	if YOU c*m then thats okay|`|qpmGLd7laa	Do you really have to ask?  If you're not looking for some over-blown philosophical argument about the nature of morality, this question is pretty much a given.|`|zscuDpaIaa	YES! i would never do that. If you guys like having sex together than why dont you make sure he is single.... im sure his g.f wouldnt liek you having sex with her boyfriend.|`|a984cQjKaa	it's pretty sad on both your parts.  have fun when this comes back to bite you in the ***.|`|YbwDFvEaaa	Do you really even need to ask this question?<br>  <br>  Not only are you having sex with an ex boyfriend (which is never a good idea) but you're assisting in his current infidelity. How would you feel if you were with someone and you found out he was sleeping with his ex? You would probably be seriously angry with the both of them, and you would have every right to be! It's really disheartening that you don't care at all about the feelings of this other girl.<br>  <br>  This also shows that you have little to no self-esteem or self-worth. You're letting this guy have his way with you with no commitment to you whatsoever. You can bet that he's also sleeping with his girlfriend, and goodness knows who else. You're putting yourself at serious risk for emotional and physical harm due to his promiscuous activity and complete disregard for the feelings of others.<br>  <br>  Sex will usually feel good...but that doesn't mean it's right, or worth it.|`|nSUHvlyaaa	i know it may feel right and all, but when you help someone cheat, you're actually at fault as well though you're not in the relationship. And a guy that has no morals to be sleeping with someone else behind his gf's back has no right to put his hands on you. Plus, he's disrespecting you by having someone else on the side while you're handing over your body to him.|`|EEapXFJ2aa	do u love him? duz he love u?<br>  duz he love his girl frend? If he does, y is he doing it with u?<br>  I think it's wrong for u to have sex with him if U are in a relationship with some1 else.. n if he has sex with u.. he myt be doing it because his gf probably dsnt let him hav it with her or maybe coz he still as a crush on u n u too hav a crush on him n since u guys have already dated before.. its easy fr him to aproach u for it since he knows ur available for him n ul have it with him.. <br>  If u look at it Ethically.. Yes it is wrong.. very wrong|`|AA11119636	yes...it makes you a slut and a home wrecker<br>  <br>  and it makes him a liar, cheater, a$$ hole <br>  <br>  and you two both destroyed his relationship with that girl...and probably broke her heart<br>  <br>  you need to move the F on...find someone new and stop living in the past and ruining his life/relationships|`|BO28Mn8haa	yes you slut. he got you back with another girl too. so basically, he has the perks of dating you and the perks of dating her. and you don't mind it? slut.. harlot.. troll|`|TPZZESeeaa	define bad. if you think cheating on someone is bad then yes, you are doing something bad, but i'll bet you already knew that|`|b23ac589c655b9f48a90e2fb2ffe9f58aa	its bad for his girlfriend but it is good 4 both of u|`|4JHF4KVOaa	yes! doing that to anyone is shocking. stop now or tell that poor girl. nobody deserves to be cheated on and ur a total ***** for doing that !|`|8YwxDrXmaa	yes this is really bad. If you enjoy having sex, tell him to brake up with his current girlfriend so you 2 can get back together|`|edCUawppaa	Yes, would you want your boyfriend to sleep with his ex??|`|1jIzBUkhaa	Yes,it is you have a girlfriend .|`|VFdC2wPlaa	Yes it is! You are helping him cheat on his girlfriend if you do that... and that is just mean.|`|v96pYAg1aa	Its hot but really bad to do so dont|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Yes you are encouraging him to cheat.  Stop it.|`|gqvvXknQaa	Yes.|`|96ZfDF6Aaa	Yes!!!|`|ABhmJepFaa	No, it's not.|`|Zm3QIw4Taa	why dont yall get back together then... omg|`|xqan4ChSaa	yes it is|`|hLWy1evQaa	DUH. <br>  <br>  Obviously he enjoys having sex. He's getting it when he can from whoever he can whether it's you or his current girlfriend. <br>  <br>  Shame on you for allowing yourself to be the girl he's cheating on his girlfriend with - even if you are his ex. Think about how you would feel if you were still his gf and he was cheating on you with somebody else? <br>  <br>  Shame on him for thinking he can get away with it. He's using you for sex and his girlfriend to fill the emotional and physical void, because yes, you can bet he's sleeping with her too. <br>  <br>  Regardless, if there is CHEATING (which means sleeping with or fooling around with anybody but his or your significant other) it's wrong.|`|BL4PEjAWaa	enjoying sex just for the sake of sex is not bad.  Does not matter who it is or was.   Practice safe sex {std's} are every where.  His gf may be doing the same thing you know.|`|AA10266072	It's bad to have sex with anyone that's in a relationship.<br>  <br>  What if when you two were dating he was banging his previous ex?|`|uSxrmpNBaa	Do you really need to ask this question. Yes it's wrong to have sex with your ex if he has a girlfriend. Would you want to be cheated on..... I would hope not..|`|drEfr9waaa	It's horrible.  You asked.|`|y4w6ybr3aa	Of course, your disrespecting yourself, and he is a scumbag for doing this to his girl.<br>  Wake up! He's using you.|`|gwWs9UdXaa	Are you really this stupid? You actually asked this stupid question? I hope this happens to you some day... you're a slut.|`|26aa29661610c2e6773d1ff374b2e530aa	I dnt think so...i mean if she dnt kno then it wont hurt...sound lyke to me that he really dnt lyke her that he lyke yu more..|`|AA11733625	If your current boyfriends ex was asking this question... how would you answer it?<br>  <br>  That is your answer.|`|4e0be5189dd654a42965404357096d76aa	its not bad i mean u both enjoy it then its ok... i mean he is the one that is cheating not you ...|`|NidCYkGpaa	What the hell!!!!

He is cheating on his girlfriend. It doesn't matter if you enjoy it or not. If he's not over you then he needs to not be with his girlfriend now and get back with you. If he is happy with his new relationship then he needs to focus on her. If he wants to be single and do with whomever he wants to then he needs to do that. I suggest that you two stop what your doing so he can figure out what he wants because to me it sounds like he has no idea. If you care about yourself and respect yourself you will stop this. If you don't care about hurting yourself or hurting her then go ahead do whatever you want. Hope that helps. Good luck.|`|Y8dXwds5aa	unfortunately yes because just turn the tables around if your boyfriend had an ex and he got busy with him then how would you feel.....its not only the enjoyment for you and him you have to think about the other person now the girlfriend probably loves him and no offense you are probably hurting there relationship and so is he plus if he is not romanticly into you then why are you lowering yourself by only sleeping with him you deserve more than that not just beeing a booty call when he feels the need to sleep with someone after he is done with you he is going back with the other girl its called using you dont let that happen.|`|ZzfLnSjUaa	well i was close to doing that wit my ex nd he had a gf but i stopped everything b4 it happened but it really wasnt bcuz he had a gf but bcuz i had a bf nd i wouldve felt bad.<br>  <br>  but wat goes around comes around....just take advantage aabout it while u can cuz wen karma comes bak at ya its guna suck!!!|`|f4gRedsqaa	ummm in a word..yes<br>  apart from causing him to cheat on his girlfriend (which would mean he would most likely cheat on you if he was back with you)<br>  it also causes :<br>  - your trust with this other girl to be broken, which could grow to more ppl<br>  - he's able to "use" you. and probably doesnt actually care about your feelings<br>  <br>  ask yourself...would you want your boyfriend doing that to you?|`|YyiESOpFaa	yes it is. if he didn't have a girlfriend, that would be another story, but he does have a girlfriend! I think that is unfair to his girlfriend and even to you, because theie are other people, and you guys are broken up. why did you break up if you wanted to keep having sex with him?|`|gYv1XUwzaa	The only person that is likely to get into the most trouble is that of the guy. The reason why? If his girlfriend finds out, she'll go barmy quite uderstandably seeing as he is techically cheating with his partner. Its bad, but its just morally wrong.|`|9dWFEkrNaa	thats exactly wut the selfish girls do.... if u 2 enjoy it then be like boyfriend and girl friend.... <br>  i feel so sad for her girl friend<br>  u are so mean <br>  one day the same thing will  happen to u<br>  one day u will realise that someone having sex with ur HUSBAND<br>  how is that make u feel?? do u like it????<br>  im sorry for u|`|nZgZWrGWaa	Its not bad, its wrong.<br>  Think of how that'd make u feel if u were her, and what sort of an asshole he is, because, if hes doing it to her, he probably did it to you, so...does he deserve ur body after all???<br>  <br>  think about it ;)<br>  <br>  PS: hes ur ex 4 a reason, find a new man..a better one|`|hcoQ8j7aaa	Yes. Yes.  Yes.  It is bad.  You can enjoy lots of stuff that isn't good but you should show a little respect for this other girl and for yourself.  The guy must be a bit of a dirt bag--to both you and his current girlfriend.|`|242C9xnxaa	Uh yeah by having sex with him knowing he has a girlfriend is kinda giving him the idea it is ok to cheat, say you were in a relationship with a guy and he was having sex with his ex would you be ok it|`|Osa64YK4aa	Well of course. Imagine if you were the girlfriend of him right now, and he was cheating on you. You could do better. Talk to him. If he really enjoys it he will leave his girlfriend for you.|`|HEe0xGVYaa	that is a horrible thing to do. I think you should leave him alone while he is in a relationship. You are tempting him to cheat on his girlfriend. Think about how you would feel if this was done to you :(|`|BPqK0c5taa	Of course it is not only are you hooking up with your ex... you are also helping him cheat on your girlfriend. Obviously your relationship with him was strictly sexual. Nothing wrong with enjoying sex but why are you helping him cheat on his girlfriend?|`|TQLWJEKyaa	if hes your ex he'syour past why give yourself to him if you don't have all the benefits of him.Do not belittle yourself stop having sex with him he do not deserve u you'll only be hurt in the long run.|`|wBXYRbhhaa	yes it is. you don't even have to ask. <br>  <br>  how do you feel?<br>  <br>  Just think that the poor girl could be you.|`|jxeQWLpWaa	i feel bad for his gf...if he still wants to have sex with you then why is he going out with her??? or if he considers her as his gf then he is just using you and(i'm sorry but) you are too easy!!!|`|710c1b7cf50a6cc7849089b186c8f716aa	As a human being, that is not acceptable. Ask yourself, would it be acceptable to sleep with your ex if you had a boyfriend.|`|FkJobxmGaa	if he is with somebody he needs to break it off and get back with you if he's goin to cheat on her and you should respect her if he decides to tell her he loves her and stay|`|FSoNujAaaa	JUST THINK BOUT IT LIKE THIS IF YOU HAD A BOYFRIEND AND HE IS HAVING SEX WITH HIS EX WHILE YALL ARE TOGETHER HOW WOULD YOU FEEL|`|a44dfe106ac4ace9a3b5286894803c2eaa	Yes, it is.

r3O9XCSBaa	That happened to me once when I was in high school. Eventually they stopped and moved on. I ignored them and acted as if I did care about what they were doing and saying. It sounds like they like you but now trying to get your attention another way. Boy are weird like that, some will be mean and make fun of you because they don't know how to explain how they feel.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	Tell him to leave you the heck alone.
FjDzAtLPaa	Does she smile at you, and you catch her looking at you? So, you like this girl... why not ask for her number when you see her next, slip in a clever line like "maybe we could get together sometime?" if  she says yeah, (which I'm sure she will because you seem older and mature) then say ok cool, whats your num? This way it gives a hint but it is not TOO obvious! Hey, 10 miles isn't a lot right ? ;) So you could easily 'bump' into her sometime if you are too scared to ring her if you already have her num. Don't worry about the age differnece though, because girls usually go out with boys that are like 1-4 years older than them. If you think shes worth it, and shes great then I suppose you should go see her. I hope she likes you, so all the best and Good luck!!!!<br>  <br>  ;D|`|CvkuzcpDaa	what to make of you liking her??? is that your question?!! cause if it is....its NOT  a big deal...if u like her, theres nothing wrong with that!! you shouldnt think its weird and be i dont know 'ashamed' of it..!! sooo if ya like her u should ask her out...if u think the age gap wouldnt matter to you..x...good luck!|`|I6tnu09saa	Try and talk to her more, and share your interests. Don't be held back because she's a girl and you haven't said much to her before now. Just try to help her out when you see her unhappy, or offer to do things for her (don't do this too much because it might make you look too clingy. Just once in a while.) If you see her in the street or in town or something like that, say hi casually. Find out if you really like her, and if you do, just carry on. Sooner or later, she'll begin to like you too. If not as a 'boyfriend' but as a friend.
YJ6m6bMXaa	There are few things you can do, hit up speed dating, or online dating. I suggest try a dating coach. I worked with New York Dating Coach and they were really solid. Worth a shot, and that should improve your game and ability to meet and dating.
1d65014f05a2c8b717ae544be68f33aaaa	Try to get her to join the gym with you or walk with her.  A lot of times a girl needs that extra support to actually get something done.  You should also make it sound like you are the one that needs to work out and not her. Just make it seem like you want to do something healthy and physical (besides sex) with her.  And about you having problems getting it up you should look at her and see the girl you met, fantasize about her and another girl caressing each other, spice up the sex life with toys and new positions, don't look at the areas that turn you off. With time you will learn to love and be turned on by every aspect of her body or you guys won't work out.  It's so early in the relationship...explore different things! And play out your fantasys in your head before your about to have sex or during sex, just make sure she's included & maybe you can picture her when you first met!!!!<br>  <br>  Also you can have her wear sexy clothes that will hid the extra weight that she's put on...Christmas is just around the corner|`|AA10205294	WELL IF U LIKE HER LIKE U SAY U DO....WEIGHT SHOULDN'T BE THAT MUCH OF A CONCERN...."YOU SHOULDN'T JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER"...YOU'LL MISS OUT ON UR SOUL MATE BEING SO JUDGMENTAL|`|AA10215581	you have better start eating as much as she does and fast  (sorry)|`|0deccea5a26ad1bf328d30590a6ffcc6aa	30 Pounds in two months?

a6e821672b32ff7ad7982d8be40ec9c4aa	Don't think that it is a rule but more of personal choice. Also depends on how close of a friend she is.

If you want him, take him. you know your friend will get a new one soon.|`|acfd9ed886db43cd4fc3a1f7a0ff2505aa	doesn't really sound like she's your friend! or maybe you just don't like her and will be friends with anyone? lol but no you can't unless she is ok with it.  you could be friends with the guy and maybe one day if they break up she won't mind you two getting together.<br>  <br>  or you could just steal him and dump her as a friend|`|ed4b67c14aefb942734099b219c4c62aaa	I personally wouldn't care if a friend dated one of my ex-gfs, but I know people who would feel betrayed.|`|ffa536b8f85fd05c8d52d57caeda20f5aa	You clearly don't think very highly of this girl so why are you friends with her|`|384436d14895b87238e4d6a65042186daa	i would be mad if my friend dated my ex but i would get over it|`|94e81d043f611eaec606d70e202d86dbaa	if shes being a skank then no but you may lose a friend for  a boyfriend but sounds like your a better pair anyway. and she'd be a fool not to see that and want that 4 you 2
SNUP0BJ3aa	I'm petite, but still have curves. I'm happy with this. I feel healthy and have some shape to my body. I think girls that are built somewhat athletic (but still feminine) look really good too.<br>  <br>  Unless they are naturally built skinny, I think women that are stick thin look like they need a cheeseburger. Just doesn't look healthy or appealing to me.|`|K8EJVxLgaa	Eh, I prefer to be skinny on my tummy but curvy on my hips. So in between i suppose. I'm 5'4 and 120, so i guess i'm leaning towards being skinny.... I'd say in general skinny is best but have a nice butt and boobs. =P|`|D5AepfDkaa	I think you can be what ever size you want to be I am curvy.|`|C44Ux50paa	little in the middle but got much back|`|8Jt3P75raa	I think curvy is better but hard to maintain only because I am curvy but tend to gain weight around my middle. So yeah, I would have to be skinny to look healthy. I wish I could have a beyonce body but I would have to be really skinny and this loose the curves anyways.|`|Pp4F6D5Waa	I had a baby 4 months ago so ive got another 8 pounds to lose, i want my old tummy back  :( im okay with my size though, i look good after having a baby :)|`|FX2gTnORaa	curvy i like a girl thts got the *** and boobs|`|3YzXWHwbaa	Curvy- but with a flat belly with no muffin top.  That would be perfect, now wouldn't it?

vYAgIMLdaa	stick with it. Time will ease your pain. Her past is really not part of your (plural) past.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	You are willing to throw away 25 years of marriage because of what happened BEFORE you were married?  Geez.  I think that is a little harsh.  And whatever she did that is disturbing you so much, is probably your issue, not hers.  You should commend her for being honest, not persecute her!|`|Y8dXwds5aa	ok what happened in the past is in the past and it doesnt mean she will do it again because she is commited to you ......first what made you interested in your wife? start doing the things that when you were dating she loved start  reignighting the fire this is your wife of 25 years she is not a stranger  she holds half of your life in her hands she trust you to be there for her you could also think of of couples therapy ......you have a desire that burns for her start thinking of all the good times and work from there to love her again people make mistakes when they are young but dont deny her of her love for you think about it  25 yrs ....give it 25 more yrs..|`|N4xd99Qaaa	Well finding out 25 years later means you guys were not open or not communicating. Then again what she did before you two were married is really none of your business. So she has a past, no big deal, because you are married to her present. In my past I took a ride on an elephant, does not mean I want to ride elephants now. Getting married is easy, staying happily married forever is the real task. She is a differant woman now and that is who you need to be in love with or you are doomed. Be romantic with her, write her a poem, take her out, take a trip together, relight the fire and passion. If you let her past bother you so much, you'll spend the rest of your life Chasing Amy.|`|oYYblXFmaa	You can't judge her from the past. The important is how she is treating you. You can't used all the negative things she did on the past before she didn't married you. It is unfair for her. Of course, nobody is perfect when they are young. Don't you tell me you didn't do any thing bad or silly things in your past? You have to thing positive about him.....if you don't.....why did you married her at the first place? If you really loved her....then you give all the respect. Just because she did bad in her past, doesn't mean she will do it on you. You have to trust her. If you are not sure....why don't you confront her and tell her why she do that, and now she decide to get marry? You have to think....all that you guys are married 25 years.....that is very long lasting. If that 25 years....how come it still last to these time? If she did it again like her past....you two wouldn't cherish this long? You have to loved her like you always did when you first met her. If there is no trust...your marriage could drain down to the bottom. It really hurts when it that happened. It will takes time to heal your thoughts about her....as she do all the good things for you....you will see the bright side of her. Just think positive. You'll be okay.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	STOP--you're going to convince all of us that after 1 conversation of a disturbing past that you have completely forgotten about the past 25 years?  Did it cross your mind that it took her 25 years to tell you and she did because she felt apparently that you were the one person she could entrust with this information?  If it were her molesting children, I could understand.  I just can't imagine what else would cause you to turn so fast.|`|wTevmGbmaa	After 25 years of marriage has she given you everything you've needed and asked for from a wife??  Give it some time, it's the past, and you weren't a part of it.. you don't have any skeletons in your closet??  I think we all do.|`|r5QvpG5jaa	she was honest w/ you...and that is what makes a relationship: honesty.  Pray to God for help in your marriage.
wqchA8B7aa	1. He likes you, and wishes you were his.<br>  2. He knows your husband is cheating on you, and thinks you deserve better.<br>  3. He's a bit mad at you because you put up with this when you shouldn't.|`|dsf5hGGnaa	I think he is in love with you and hates that another man has a chance with you and doesn't treat you like a princess. That's why he exploded like that.|`|Knpe24Moaa	He is angry. <br>  <br>  jack99...answered your question perfectly|`|Fq8yzJamaa	So he told you how he feels ... perhaps he needs some space.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	I believe you are the same person that keeps posing this question in different ways, providing a little more information each time to see if you will get a different opinion.  If you are happy with your husband and don't have a problem with him going out, that is your business.  Your guy friend is telling you to read between the lines.  He thinks your man is whoring around while you turn a blind eye to it, in other words wake up and get out while you can.  I don't see it as your friend being your knight in shining armor wanting to sweep you off your feet.  If that is what you want to know, just flat out ask him and quit asking us.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	Is your guy friend gay?  If not then he's probably really regretting not making a move on you before you married your husband.  If he had that kind of feelings for you he could be really kicking himself right now thinking that you could both be a lot happier if he had gone for it.
bpm7OcbTaa	It's time to wake up!  You do not need this guy and the fact that you are chasing him down is just one of many reasons why it is not working.  If he was interested in you, he would make every effort to stay in contact, connect with you, and go beyond the every other week ritual.  If you cannot see that you are worth more than this, chances are you will remain a stagehand and never land the part as the central character.|`|pIvN6TY7aa	Let it go.  Really.<br>  <br>  You need this one like you need a boil on your bum.  Apparently, he's got a drinking problem, is about as faithful as an alley cat, and obviously doesn't care a fried fig about you.<br>  <br>  He didn't answer you because he didn't want to.  If you keep on texting at him, you look really pathetic, even like some kind of stalker.  <br>  <br>  Let it go.

XIH2oKtJaa	how long were you going out? it can be really difficult to move on from someone that you've been with for a long time. it sounds like she's not ready to move on from you but wants to be out having her own fun, meeting new guys, doing whatever. you cheated on her so she wants you to know that she can meet new people too, that she doesn't have to sit at home and cry about it. she told you how good he was to make you jealous, to make you see what you had lost. and now he's just gone and broke her trust she's probably finding it all very difficult right now. if you truly want to get back with this girl then let her be for a while to get over this guy, then tell her how you feel about her, tell her you're sorry for what you did. you also need to explain the situation to the new gf as its not fair on her what you're doing.
q1QyM0Kzaa	If you know that you did nothing to cause him to break off the relationship with you, chances are he did, or he lost interest, and if he managed either of those within 2 weeks, you can almost certainly do better than him.<br>  <br>  however, if you do really like him that much, I can tell you that I personally have always found the most unnattainable women the most desireable, so try acting as if you are completely over him and no longer interested in him, and just see if he seems more interested in you. If he doesn't, then try something else, but that's the best advice Ihave for you. Crying works for some people, but those people tend to be chauvinists who think the woman should be totally dependent on the man, so you might want to think twice about it.|`|cTAXAC1saa	yup, u should send him a letter or text him its lot easier that way,<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|TrEYixLXaa	Move on.  You seem pretty young so I am sure you WILL find somebody else. <br>  <br>  I know it's hard to give something up that you want and need so much, but you have to do it, because you are worth so much more.<br>  <br>  If he dumped you for NO reason whatsoever, you need to let it go.  Guys come and go; and I know right now it feels like you will NEVER get over him, but you will.<br>  <br>  It's all about giving it time.  The worst feeling in life is to love someone who doesn't love you back.  <br>  <br>  A broken heart keeps beating...<br>  <br>  Feel better :(|`|qShNwVenaa	how old are you?
bS3f0f1paa	You don't sound pathetic trust me. I'm 19 and just now in my first serious relationship. When you go to college there's going to be soo many new people there for you to meet, and get to know. It's going to happen, trust me. I thought it never would for me either, but it did. And now I'm in love for the first time in my life with a boy who gets along with my family, and whose family loves me as well. The fact that you haven't had one yet, will make the first that much better. You just have to be a little patient. I know that is easier said than done. But your not the only one in your shoes, i guarantee it.|`|UmgSdeMlaa	Trust me sweetheart... You won't be alone forever, lol I think every girl thinks that at one point in their life...

Honestly I used 6 years of getting to know myself as an adult before i found somebody who i can be with, things that i love and hate... Why rush... Live your live it's the only one you get...

Im 20, and have been in college for 3 years, and guess what, im still a virgin. when you are in college you will meet tons of new guys and friends. you'll have options. there will be a diverse group of ppl and you will even run into some guys who happen to still be virgins. dont worry just be yourself. you'll meet people have tons of fun, and one day you'll meet that special someone. you might meet him in college or elsewhere. but this is not something to stress out about. trust.|`|AA11773731	Don't worry about it.

Go to college, get good grades, and worry about getting a BF after all that.
gqvvXknQaa	He wants to rekindle your friendship and see if there is any romantic feelings there. I'm sure you've told him about your marriage, so let him comfort you and be there for you. :)|`|ZDqdYhdGaa	I think that he is willing to be your friend but is also wanting something more. Keep him close as a friend until you are fully ready to move on and start a new relationship and then consider whether you feel strongly enough about him to have a relationship with him. <br>  <br>  And props to you for getting out of a bad marriage!
pECzViMUaa	the same thing happened to me. i guess the fact you got a boyfriend might have something to do with it. maybe they are jealous? when i first started seeing my boyfriend everyone said that i was always with him, and that annoyed me, but then one of my friends got a boyfriend a couple of months ago and she is always with him and now kinda see what they meant. if that is the reason, make sure you try to spend time with both, although i see how that could be hard if they are being weird with you. talk to them about it, and ask them why they are leaving you out? tell them that it is upsetting you and maybe they will explain their reasoning.|`|k0XTYTqkaa	Jealous, I would make a bit of time for them without the boyfriend. If their catty ways continue just give them space. take care not to dump them as girl friends are always needed when boys are horrid!!!!! Take care, smile and have fun!!|`|BaNrweQ4aa	maybe it's because you've got a boyfriend - and you are spending a lot more time with him, so they think you don't needthem anymore. however; ibet they would hate being left - like you have been, so i just think you should talk things over with them and try and figure out why they are like this :)|`|AHexXClbaa	This sounds like typical teen behavior.  When you break away from a group for a boyfriend/girlfriend, sometimes your friends feel like you have replaced them and get their feelings hurt, and yes, sometimes they are a little jealous.  Do you spend all of your time with your boyfriend or do you make time for your former friends?  If they are important to you, make an effort to get back in their good graces.  When you and your boyfriend split up, you will need those girlfriends like never before.|`|ZZkInusMaa	i think it might be because you have a boyfriend ... i am with a group of 7 other girls the same ting happened to me when i got my boyfriend but i went u to them and asked them what there problem was and i explained what i ment after that they must have gave it second judgement and walla back friends again .. <br>  hope it works .. !!|`|WpAsonqtaa	maybe they are a lilttle jealous that ur with ur bf..if u spend alot of ur time with him. and as for being invited places..just invite urself lol that wat i do. im sure they are still ur friends, maybe just sit dwon and talk to them, ask them if there is anythin wrong! if they ask u about ur business then ask them back so that u are getting in a gd convo, if they say somethin like its none of ur business then just dont tell em about urself.

It's no worse then say.. falling in love with someone you met at a bar.

TgUOMBIKaa	Maybe, you shouldn't call off the relationship just yet. But make yourself busy, harder to contact. Running errands, don't show so much frustration about what he is doing. Make it seem like it is not on the top of your list of things in your life. Then, show him that you find other men attractive, they interest you. If he is Truly interested in you, it will bother him. Maybe, not right away. But it will make him wonder. Show him that you get angry when he asks you questions about what is going on. If that doesn't help, maybe he is not ready for a committed relationship. Just do what your heart and gut tells you. But be happy!|`|rUHRivqBaa	Sweetie ,When you are in love ,you take care of the person,automatically he/she becomes the best for you,you internally dont feel like talking to any other girl or boy,you care more then yourself for the other person.<br>  So just give a pause and think that relationaship has all that, do you feel content and at peace or anxious with him,think and decide ,give 2-3 chances to the other perosn to understand that u r not very happy with his habits and then YOU take decision bcz the way he is important to you ,your own happiness and self respect also matter,<br>  take care. :-)|`|AA11119636	you answered your own question!!! <br>  <br>  "I don't feel that he is putting more stock into our relationship.

HnEcgVGiaa	Hi Court,<br>  <br>  You've reposted! So here's my response again:<br>  <br>  Well! Engagement, huh? Seems like that guy doesn't know the different between engagement and a fling. He has to realize that engagement is a promise for the commitment - it's important as marriage. While you're both not have shared vows, there should be no way that he should have left you in the dark.<br>  <br>  Is he that embarrassed about being engaged to you that he refers you as an ex-gf? That would infuriate many girls. Some would have stormed into the restaurant themselves and pulled the guy out from his group!<br>  <br>  You need to realize that you need to be respected. He has simply shoved you into his pocket to be dealt with later. That's not how you treat your special someone! Two people who are engaged must have a strong connection between them, trusting them with their lives, and not be afraid to declare that they are together.<br>  <br>  Before he finishes his "thinking" time, you need to think quicker and make a decisive action. If that's a preview of your marriage, you've just received a red flag on this guy. Stop worrying about what you think he would want. Declare what you want! Anyone can say those three words "I love you", but did he mean it? He is genuinely in love with you?<br>  <br>  You must find what his real intentions are, even though you've pretty much seen his behavior this past Saturday. Decide if this guy is worth the wait, the forgiveness, and the effort to strengthen your relationship. Are you willing to spend the rest of your life with him? Raising a family? Sending your kids off to college? Can you build that strong family?<br>  <br>  Be thorough in your thinking, but don't dwell on them too long. Realize that you need to be respected, but don't be over-confident. Be honest and be clear about your decisions.<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, you will have some kind of regrets. But you must learn to be strong and move on forward.<br>  <br>  If you do continue your relationship and he fixes his attitude, then everything's worked out. If you decide that you deserve better, then realize that you can love again! He's not the last guy you'll have feelings for.<br>  <br>  Best of luck,<br>  <br>  Brian|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	break up with this guy before he damages you.  you deserve better.  he cheated on you, hate to say it.  you're right to second guess him.  he will never marry you, he's not marriage material.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	he refered to you to someone as his EX girlfriend.  its over honey.  he isnt ready to get married, and you deserve a relationship with someone who tells you the truth|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	He's not worth the expense of a wedding. Don't waste your money. Dump him.|`|RKsn5dD4aa	move on.|`|2lGiWag7aa	He sounds like he may not be ready for marriage so the best thing to do is definitely not marry him any time soon cos he could change his mind once he finds out what married life is like, all the responsibilities etc. Only people who really wanna get married are prepared and won't mind that but he doesnt seem to be ready.<br>  It wasnt nice though what he said about you in the restaurant, you deserve better than that.|`|cIBqQ0QEaa	He did this to you and HE needs time away from you?! I don't think so. When he did this you should have given him his ring back and told him that you're done. There is no reason that should have happened, especially when he won't even tell you the truth about where he was going. If it wasn't that big of a deal, why did he make it one? You should call him up and tell him you have no interest in marrying the person that he has turned into, that the engagement is off, and if he wants to stay with you he needs to explain his actions and show you how much he does want to be with you. This will be hard, but look at your situation from outside. If I posted this question, what would you tell me to do?<br>  <br>  EDIT: You've even said it yourself - "I can't marry someone like this... "|`|2kl0vQjVaa	What a jackass!  Girl you can do better!  Once a cheater, always a cheater!!!!|`|FhWOpW4waa	Time to move on.  Hes not ready.|`|96ZfDF6Aaa	He is not a good guy and you need to get out ASAP!|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	He's already basically screwing around and lying to you. Getting married will not fix that. He is not ready to be committed to you. Do not marry this loser. Find someone who when they propose actually mean it and will treat you like his equal.|`|NauMcvTvaa	Hi, Sorry to hear you are going through that. No, you can't marry someone like that. If he's supposted to be your husband someone you are going to depend on for the rest of your life. Its really messed up how he lied to you and called you his ex... and how you just don't leave him alone. Let him go and let realize what he "had". Its not worth it girl. He is obviously not ready.|`|Z9WqYNR0aa	Kick him to the curb. He cheating and there no doubt ( you don't always have to have sex to cheat) also it doesn't seem like he wants to be in the relationship but is to afraid to let go. Your like his back up just in case something goes wrong. <br>  <br>  I know this may sound very strong but it's because I've seen it happen time after time. You have to much value and shouldn't let someone abuse you like that.|`|ixDTI97Aaa	He is not ready for the "ever after" bit.  It is obvious that he is lying to you, wanting time to re-think his commitment to you. <br>  I know this is difficult for you and will hurt, but be very thankful that this type of behavior came out now.  This is not the type of thing you want to deal with when you are married with children.<br>  I hope you will make the right decision for you.  If you let him treat you badly now, you are giving him permission and reason to do it in the future.<br>  You deserve much better!|`|AVMoDxiJaa	Dump him like a hot potato girl! That cad!|`|LnlBdW35aa	move on|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Definitely do not get married. This is not the right guy for you. Yeah it'll be hard to let go of him, but what's the point in hanging on?<br>  When you meet someone and you fall in love, there is no doubt in your head, there is no desire to be with anyone else, and forever isn't scary it's wonderful. You shouldn't be waiting on him for an answer, he's already lied to you. He should be begging at your feet. He's not a good man. <br>  There are better men out there, don't put yourself through the pain. Get out now.|`|AA11733625	To put it nicely.. he wants his cake and eat it too!<br>  <br>  You are his base while he searches for something else. This man has you on hold, while he goes on his search. You are his go-to girl who he knows will be there because he gave you the girlfriend title... while he goes off on his search for the next best thing. <br>  <br>  Move on.. he is showing you NO respect at all. The "I love you"'s and "Time to think" is his way of keeping you on the line... making you hold on, so he doesn't lose his back up plan. <br>  <br>  You deserve to be number one to someone, not an "on-hold" back up.. so move away from this make who does not respect you.|`|BeBEOFGxaa	although cold feet is normal, this is a little over the top. you're just setting yourself up for heartbreak.<br>  <br>  sorry, but i would call off the wedding. yes, forever is a long time. but honestly, and im sorry, but this guy sounds like a jerk. hes already hiding things from you, and he is hanging out with other girls behind your back. this doesnt mean that it will stop once your married.<br>  <br>  marriage is something you are SURE about. if you're into the non serious type of stuff, its good, but definitely not marriage material.|`|GZ9LjS13aa	OMG this is easy ahaha.<br>  I bet your both in your twenties.<br>  For you it might be okay to give up your sex life at and an early age for one guy.<br>  However, studies have show men do not care about a women's brain till their really late in age. Like 60.<br>  What i am trying to say is that most men have trouble getting married early because they are attached to their penis. It is like half their life they value.<br>  So he basically wants to be able to have sex with various hot women.<br>  And unfortunately this ngiht of which u speak he was trying to get some before marriage.<br>  To me it sounds like he aint ready and will regret marriage because of the loss of sex with other women, meaning he will cheat on you.<br>  Men are disgusting i know, they make me mad because of how stupid they can be. I get a bad rap as a person because of this, but hey if me telling women how guys really think may make up for their behavior ill try.|`|RV0ZwfuUaa	You need to get out of this relationship asap. I am sure this is heart breaking but i also think you have family & friends to fall back on. It will be good to talk about this to someone you trust and you are comfortable with. Something like this happened with a friend of mine. he was not cheating on her or at least we didn't know about it. after they were engaged and 2 months before wedding he just said that he is not sure if he wants to spend his whole life with her. he needs more time etc etc. my friend had the courage of calling off her wedding though some relatives suggested postponing until he makes up his mind. It was a tough time for her but we all pulled it through. I don't want to give you false hopes but few months later one of her colleague proposed her and its been 3 years since she is happily married. So i would say have faith in god and yourself and just walk out free before you end up with a cheater/ liar and what not.|`|WFX9JVaAaa	You're really going to yahoo answers to figure this one out? <br>  <br>  If so, you're too young to be getting married. How old are you 18?<br>  <br>  He's a D-bag and so are you for dating him and questioning this episode.|`|XnPnfFxPaa	i know how your feeling love, its the worst!. but believe it or not there really is a guy meant for you that will treat you the way you need to be treated and the way you deserve to be treated, and he will do it willingly.  this guy is not it. don't let it get you down- be happy that you will be happy with the right guy someday!|`|n4xRUt6Haa	well it sounds like he wants to be with you he just don't want to marry you. second he's lying to you and if you are going to marry him you are going to be able to trust him. Third you shouldn't be waiting for him if he  wanted to marry you yall would have gotten married already. I think you should find you somebody else somebody who is sure about their feeling and who isn't going to lie to you.
7fh3JCVxaa	put on lipgloss when hes watching you. have your hair really shiny, thats a turn on.<br>  talk to him and compliment him and flirt with him, but not in a cheesy full-on way. leave some mystery and dont overcrowd him with yourself.<br>  <br>  x|`|NWwGl4k6aa	okay...first pointer is not mention that you follow astrology.  astrology is what men call b0ner killers|`|TPZZESeeaa	they are laid back people, my best friend is a libra male. so just be easy going while you try to "seduce" him. calm and steady wins the race|`|FTHoPLTXaa	Why do you want to seduce him?

1KjfZAWzaa	Well, to clear up some stuff ... I sit next to my friends (who are girls) all the time, even if they aren't single. It doesn't matter much.<br>  <br>  I'd focus on becoming good friends, since she isn't exhibiting many signs that she likes you more than her boyfriend. <br>  <br>  If she becomes single, seize the chance.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and a random piece of advice. <br>  Stay with her and don't betray her. You'll kill your chances if you guys cannot even be friends. If she sees you are a nice, loyal, kind friend, your chances will be WAY higher.

I'd suggest going to a liquor store (which you just missed if you're in minnesota) and get a bottle of whisky that you can sneak into a bar.  Then you'll have enough left over to get a 20 of shwagg or a gram of kind.
99c37f598c1c82c68de17784567bf5edaa	You risk totally losing his friendship by be involved in anyway with his personnel relationship with another girl.  Tell him it makes you uncomfortable to discuss such private things.
PMChj7w6aa	Maybe you should try talking to him about it. Maybe say hey look it seems like your not happy anymore, whats up? And maybe he's just going through a weird phase. Give him some time. Has anything dramatic happened to him lately? Because When my Grandmother died, I broke up with my boyfriend for a few days because I wasn't happy, and I just wanted to be alone. Maybe just give him some time. Also, their might be another girl, and maybe he dosen't want to hurt you?|`|JwnHKTabaa	If you're more worried about his happiness, sit down and talk with him calmly. Even if he gets mad, stay calm.<br>  <br>  If he isn't happy, then break it off.|`|TPZZESeeaa	be happy|`|BPqK0c5taa	If hes no longer happy then you have to end it. Nothing worse then dragging out a relationship like that. It just leads to years of being miserable. Its tough for you to let him go, but its not meant to be. You will find someone that's right for you, and you will make plans for the future with him as well.|`|zgVkDGfXaa	Communicate with him about it...That is the best thing you can have in a relationship besides trust! Let him know what's going on and how you feel and how you perceive how he has been acting lately. Don't accuse him of anything, just tell him like it is from your percpective!|`|mDQZnI7gaa	Talk about what the problems are. Ask him what he's feeling and tell him what you're feeling. Maybe you two can come to a mutual understanding whichever way it goes but just make sure you're both happy.|`|Q4VwhcbXaa	There are plenty of fish in the sea; its run its course and you both will be happier if you end it.  If it was meant to be you will end up together but now is not the right time.|`|bdzG1VEDaa	I think you know the answer yourself... You are clearly isn't happy either. Trust me, you'll get over him and will find someone who is happy to be with you!|`|JQrGknfMaa	Do what's best for you
SWz7ElbFaa	It does not matter what sign they are. You are obviously very involved with all this magic stuff and I am not judging you for that but I was once told which signs I should not be involved with and I am now in a 4year long relationship that gets better by the day with somebody of that star sign. <br>  <br>  Go for who you like. Star signs DO NOT affect things like this.|`|LGCLmUTnaa	Honestly, it really doesn't matter what sign you are.<br>  Those are just for fun, they don't really predict your future.<br>  That's impossible.<br>  I mean, seriously? Think about it.<br>  The time of year you were born is doesn't determine what kind of person you are.<br>  For example, I'm an aquarius and someone I know is also, and we are the COMPLETE opposite. And I really do mean complete opposite.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	ask in horoscopes. We're Dr. Phil's here not astronomers.<br>  <br>  Dammit Jim, I'm a Doctor not an atrologer.|`|BO28Mn8haa	Excuse me?

bpm7OcbTaa	By doing just what you stated.  This guy is not your ex or a representation of one.  He is a totally neutral guy who wants to make things work with you by seeing where it leads.  While you are away and have the time to deal with your issues, deal with them.  Look at the qualities he possesses and see how that draws out your fears.  Think about his behaviors and see if there are any red flags to be concerned about.  If there is nothing there, then let go.  There is no 5 or 10 step process to break you out of your comfort zone, but you can start by examining why you feel that you don't deserve him and why you cling to past mistakes.
Qu3c2B0haa	Well hun,<br>  in life, there's many times where you need to sacrifice.<br>  What i would do is, talk to my mother. She needs to realize you're not the little girl you used to be. Ask her about her young years and also bring out the fact that it's 2009, and things are different. You need to prove to her that you are mature enough for a relationship. Your mom cares about you, that's why she has these rules. She does not want you hurt. Obviously, we can do whatever we want after we're 18, so shes not dead serious.<br>  Maybe she just doesn't want to lose her little girl?<br>  <br>  <br>  Now,<br>  if you honestly believe he is a great guy, then take a chance... not remember your mom will be watching.<br>  But, really talk to her about it!!|`|OAYaeW22aa	omg you are really deprived!!! i swear i will totally help you. like no joke. what you need to do is ask your mom if she was dating in highschool and if she does then tell her that she needs to back off coz you think that you have found the one person that is the only person that understand you aprpresciates you and tells you that you need to get some time out of the lair of the b*tch(mom no offence).|`|swV3SIw7aa	tell her exactly what you told us<br>  <br>  and 23?<br>  honey you can move out when your 18, they cant stop you<br>  goodluck dont lose him!|`|faeXRQmcaa	Nope not reasonable at all! Talk to your parents about this, tell them how you feel, and that you are not the 5 year old girl who they would say NO without an explanation.
AA10378030	Text, call, chat but DO NOT discuss moving in with this guy...you don't even know him....if he pushes moving in together PLAYER.... take it slow....|`|ziCq6zuEaa	it isn't a game. It never was.|`|gqvvXknQaa	DON'T you dare text/call him. You don't want to seem desperate. If he doesn't call you, then make other plans.|`|f36fd7ebee0834d91215dcf907b2dee7aa	first of all its not a game<br>  now well u really gotta be careful with players! u never no if they really like you or they are just looking for another fling! so maybe dont run around with him n give him alot of space dont text or coll him too much let him do the work! play hard to get as well as be fun n flirty!! look strong and confident but be careful!!|`|TcMa4a7paa	Don't play the game... Ever.  Don't move in with a guy until you get married or are at least engaged to him (ring, wedding date set and everything).  Otherwise, you are showing him that he doesn't have to buy the cow because he can get the milk for free.  (I moved in with my boyfriend after a year of being together.  Five years later, I moved out because I was still just a girlfriend.)  He also will not respect you.  I believe that he is sweet, but do not downplay your feelings.<br>  <br>  Instead of trying to figure out the game and find a way to fit into his life, live your life and let him want to fit his way into your life.  A woman who does her own thing and is not sitting by the phone (which is something you shouldn't do anyway) is much more attractive to a man.|`|UlkQT8eeaa	Him talking about moving in together and that he wants to settle down could very well be just another way to get at you. Guys know what girls like to hear and that's one line that tends to work on some females. <br>  Don't txt him, don't call. If he really wants to be in a relationship, a serious one, let him chase you. since your just getting back into the dating scene you shouldn't focus on one guy. It's okay to go on dates with different guys, this will really help you to weed out the players from the serious ones. Try not to get to attached to anyone until your sure about him.
KUa7pvEXaa	He's just immature.  I used to be in a relationship like that.  Now I date guys that are a little older and the drama and stuff that you were talking about is gone.
KWeU8LJtaa	She probably doesn't like your relationship with him and tells him to stay away from you when they're together.<br>  <br>  He probably really wants the relationship to work out (after all he took her back after cheating) so he does what ever she wants to keep her happy.<br>  <br>  It's not right, or a smart thing to do on his part, but that's probably the reason behind it|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Are you just his platonic friend or do you have romantic feelings for him? You should sort it out with yourself first. If you are just a friend then you should understand his dilemma when he is around her. She may not like him to be friendly with any girls. That makes him behave the way he does. If he was a mature person then he would realize that he can have girlfriends and friends at the same time. If you have 'feelings' for him then you should tell him. May be he feels the same way about you. He can dump his cheating girl friend and be with you forever.|`|A2G9foewaa	The answer is he is either afraid that she may get jealous if she sees him around you.  Or she has already told him not to be around you cause it makes her uncomfortable.  Whatever it is its not a problem with you, and I doubt their relationship will last anyway so just wait it out.|`|tAcWksQYaa	I didn't read it all because I g2g eat but it sounds like he doesnt want his gf mad at him and think hes cheating n her with you|`|KH0RGuVwaa	BECAUSE girlfriends are more important than friends that are girls.<br>  you would be jealous if your bf was talking to another girl too i bet.|`|GgBdQqrdaa	its probably nothing.. guys just tend to loose focus on friends whilst with a girl.. tryna get nookie is a dangerous thing..|`|c708ee170696cfadb2981551f461f14faa	His girlfriend probably doesn't approve of him having a "close" female friend.  Obviously, from what she was doing on the side, I'd assume she doesn't trust him to have friends of the opposite sex.<br>  <br>  He's apparently really into her and just trying to make her happy.|`|Jhr68T0baa	is this he's first serious gf? he sounds whipped on her and deserves better. but if hes a friend hes being out of order to completely ignore you when hes with his gf. maybe his girlfriend has a problem with you and told him? if you 2 had a close relationship she might feel threatened. you need to talk to him.|`|Vw7Ji0zUaa	umm idiot if your not his bff why is it that serious he probably was just tryna get at you but he gf now you should just chill and lay off thats why when then broke up you were probably a rebound...dont you have other friends...and with the looking thing he may miss talking to you but its the best for him not to talk to you cuz he loves or just likes his gf alot|`|xv8CjbXEaa	The girlfriend is probably jealous. <br>  I would talk to her about it. You have known him longer and she is afraid of you knowing him better than she does. I mean, turn the tables and take a look. You would be the same way.|`|RoyvUWl7aa	She's probably jealous of your relationship with him.|`|NYwoG13Haa	He probably doesnt want to make her jealous|`|JTChYOpqaa	yeah he really wants u but he dont know what he should really do us guys cant think rite sometimes
qnu6zwd4aa	Your not in love with her yet, but maybe you should confront her. Shes a study buddy and potential girlfriend if you want her to be. GIrls are always changing moods, its what makes us females. lol, anyways you should approach her or flirt with he ron the phone or in person and see how she reatcs towards you the next day or even as soon as you tell her. Dont worry about what she might think, take a chance, its always worth it. trust me.|`|Jhr68T0baa	I doubt your in love with her, shes got you twisted round her finger sounds like. you seem to be attracted to the games she plays with you.|`|994bad87c92a81fc299436a8b5ac1453aa	Only you will know if you're in love with someone.
iPNOVR6Gaa	I think you should ask his parents to talk to him about his childish behavior, because I'm sure they must love their granddaughter, and they'll set him straight.<br>  <br>  PS - As the father of two beautiful and enchanting daughters (and no sons, by the way), your husband's behavior seems totally bizarre to me!|`|SsfnitjXaa	I find this hard to believe as most daughter's are "daddy's little girl".  If he isn't talking to you I sure hope you are not allowing him to diddle you either.  So that "trying" again is out of the question.  <br>  <br>  As long as he is providing a roof over your head, I would just set up a home in the house (separate bedrooms) and live my life and shun him.<br>  <br>  What does his mother say about his behavior?  Was this not discussed before you got pregnant?|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I find this question so absurd that I absolutely am speechless.  If this a real question, you have married one of the most ridiculous a**holes on earth.  Did you not know that he was an escapee from a mental institution before the marriage.  For him to act this way is beyond belief.  File for divorce now, he is not worthy of you or your gorgeous baby girl.  You both deserve so much more.|`|ucVgUcDvaa	Wow, he is very ignorant. I do not usually say to "leave him". But in this case he is a nut case and it is time to pack his bags and kick him out. Maybe he thinks the baby isnt his? I mean I am trying to understand his thought process! <br>  <br>  Right now start by documenting everything that he has done to alienate your daughter. So when you divorce you have many reasons for him not to get custody or that when he has visitation he is accompanied by a state appointed liaison. He should never be left alone with her.....ever. So look into getting lawyer and then handle things from there. <br>  <br>  My husband and I have two sons and a daughter, she is so close to me it is scary. But she has a total other kind of a relationship with Dad. My daughter and I have a blast together. My sons and I have a great time too. Your children should be your 1st concern.<br>  Good Luck!|`|1hciyvKdaa	Im sorry, it must be very painful for you. Can you move back home or with other family or firends? You deserve a happier life, try to make it happen ok. You can find a nice man to be with. Just get away from this man, take care ok.|`|lYjweuZmaa	THAT IS EFFING CRAZY ID TELL THAT MOTHER EFFER TO GET HIS A3S ON THE ROAD. THAT IS SO UNACCEPTABLE! SEE HOW HE FEELS ABOUT PAYING CHILD SUPPORT... <br>  <br>  OMG THAT IS SO ..... GRR THAT MAKES ME SOOO.... UGH I DONT EVEN HAVE THE WORDS IN ME...<br>  <br>  HOW ARE YOU PUTTING UP WITH THIS|`|bO2rzfISaa	Wow. Your husband sounds really ignorant. What'll happen when the next one's a girl? I think you should get a job and get a divorce. Your husband sounds like a lunatic.|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	It sounds as though there are more problems in your marriage than the sex of the baby. How can you continue in this situation? You must do something now before the baby is permanently affected. Is there someone you and the baby can visit for awhile? The alternative is counseling.<br>  If he acts this way about the sex of his own child, there must be other problems too. My heart goes out to you. Good Luck ( :|`|MOALoKWdaa	if he wont see or talk to you well why even bother being with  him, leave his dumbass and find some one who will want you and the baby no matter what gender your baby is....put him on  child support if thats the way hes going to be acting cuz hes the one who made the baby with you|`|5iOHJHUzaa	LoL. I hope this is a joke. If not you need to leave, run FAST. Because I don't know if your were supposed to be able to control the sex of your baby, but he doesn't care about you or YOUR child. Leave him and suck him dry for child support!!|`|eS9nPWqBaa	WOW....leave him!!  Are you kidding me?  This is going to trickle down to your daughter causing low self esteem and in turn her looking for comfort in men.<br>  <br>  How are you two ever going to feel happy?<br>  <br>  I feel bad for you i really do..|`|qVL5R8nuaa	You sound like you married Henry VIII. You should use the name Anne Boleyn and remind him that their daughter grew up to be one of England's greatest monarchs, Elizabeth I.|`|sEihaeLNaa	wow what a jerk. He is a machista!! leave his ***, what father can be like that with there own kid.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	That is so sad.|`|yZ7vjv86aa	I don't understand at all why he is upset with his own child and mad at you.  You didn't do anything to determine the gender of the child and he should be happy you were both able to conceive and have a healthy baby.<br>  <br>  He's being childish because he didn't get a male child.  Sounds like you both need to have some counseling on this.  This will not improve on it's own.  Perhaps there is someone at the hospital you can talk with?<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|QIkAqFsbaa	The greatest blessing a woman can have is to bear children. You did that and you even had a normal baby. If your husband can see and appreciate them - then he is not worth it. The male dominant chromosome comes from the man. Let your husband know this. He rather be angry with himself than with you. You were just the carrier. Talk to you husband ,Tell him how despondent you are and how ungrateful the his. Remind him that you bore him a normal beautiful child. If he can' accept this , then too bad. Is there an underlying factor to this that you are not seeing. ?? you may want to look deeper into this.|`|fLU63N4kaa	What.....a.......JERK!!!!! Omg!|`|fc1n9vBjaa	People have too much sympathy for people who are disappointed over their baby's gender, don't pander to it, make it clear its not acceptable to feel like that towards your own child.<br>  <br>  I've never understand why people care what gender their baby is, if they have 10 boys or 10 girls they should be as happy as a pig in sh*t cause all babies are blessing.<br>  <br>  Some people are just ungrateful and selfish.|`|gYv1XUwzaa	ur husband is behaving like henry the 8th used to behave. they dont appreciate female children coz its all about having a boy to carry on the name and stuf. its stupid. ur husband needs to realise at the end of the day, this is a child, ur child, and he cant ignore it just because it did not come out as the sex he wanted. u cnt choose what sex the child shuld be, yes it's having sexual intercourse, but from then the egg and sperm decide what sex to be. Tel him if he can not appreciate a daughter, then get out|`|SKJsfRImaa	Leave him before she is old enough to be emotional traumatized because it will happen. She will know he never wanted her and that can ruin her life! All babies are a blessing- if he wants nothing to do with her he probably has a terrible opinion of women in general. You will always be a wonderful mother and all that she needs.|`|xJS3BdUNaa	Wow.  why did you marry this shittbag?  Better question: Why would you have a kid with this shittbag?<br>  <br>  <br>  Well, you obviously aren't the sharpest tool in the shed, but it would be a wise move to divorce this motherfcker.  Any man who doesn't love the baby he had with the woman that he 'loves' doesn't deserve your love.  <br>  <br>  Lose him.  Love the baby and raise her to be into better guys than you are.|`|NnN4drsbaa	tell him its his fault he can't make nothing but girls. But seriously, I wouldn't have another one of his kids, he would only show favoritism the the boy, it that's what you had. He's a jerk. I would tell him to kiss my butt, and keep on moving on. ME and my BABY!!! BTW, don't forget the child support.|`|a1uoxczTaa	i would pick my child over him any day. what if u had another baby, another girl, and he still chooses to be angry? he will leave u with two kids! i dont know how close you are about leaving him but i would walk out the door with my precious child, better yet make him leave!|`|AP2e90cCaa	This is completely unacceptable behaviour and you need to tell him that. Before leaving him, get some marital counselling.|`|TSmego9vaa	If this makes you unhappy,why do you stay. Its not fair to your baby. If you ever left you would find someone that would love her as their own child. =]|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Are you kidding me? What kind of a evil person could ignore a innocent baby. Why would you even want to be with this person?|`|jBigEy0Caa	She does not determine the sex, he does.  Lay that one on him and tell him to try better next time.|`|ZEitfScGaa	Wow, sounds like a great guy. Get counseling, if that doesn't help then leave him.<br>  What am FN loser husband, I feel sorry for you.|`|xNWqqlcYaa	well congrats, sounds like you married a winner.  way to go.|`|wIkGLOgnaa	tell him to grow up and get over it or get the f*** out!!!|`|b54d93db511477e3231a19a1adb0c354aa	well...leaving him would definitely not be the thing to do. bec even if he is having a hard time with his child being a girl, that is her father, and the father in a little girl's life plays one of the biggest parts. and whether anyone realizes it or not, growing up with your parents being separated is a tough emotional situation for the child. just love him, even when he is unlovable. tell him one day that you love him and so does his daughter...he'll come around. the absolute best thing to do is pray for him...it'll work out. =] i'll be prayin for ya too! ;)|`|qU2RbKWfaa	1 It is not your fault <br>  2 she is a blessing <br>  3 he does not deserve BOTH OF YOU
NSL9svm0aa	THere is nothing wrong with u and if ur going to the gym and taking care of urself well good for u cuz if u know ur overweight and doing something about it well good for u as long as u know ur not lying cuz that's lying to urself and dats sad. But good that ur keeping good hygiene thats very important! My BF is a lil chubby and I love it! and he's 6 ft. so it doesn;t show much but I love to hug him and I fell safe when I'm with him. I dated a very very skinny guy b4 and now I look back at it and I realiza I won't date one that size again. Good luck you'll find someone!|`|vo7Ws7xtaa	LoL... I have no idea what the problem is.  I'm with a big guy, and I think he's incredibly sexy, and he gets hit on a lot too.  Just smile, and be the gentleman you are, and she'll come along...<br>  <br>  p.s.  I'd love to see how the lesbian experiment goes ;o)|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I doubt it has anything to do with your weight. Plus, why would you want a girl who has a problem with your weight anyway? You'll find a girl who doesn't care and likes you for you. You just have to stop looking. Good luck and I'm sorry that you feel that way!|`|AA11767076	You sound cool to me; don't worry about stupid girls, someone meaningful will appreciate you for the right reasons!|`|aeptkU9Waa	Theres nothing wrong with it, why do you say women walk around with angry faces? Try a smile to cheer them up! :-)|`|ydclPOBLaa	theres nothing wrong with dating overweight guys, you need to focus on older mature women who know that its whats inside that counts most younger girls haven't realized that looks aren't important,keep smiling and be charming theres someone special out there for you.. also are you only looking at the skinny ones, overweight or plus size women are great too, keep your options open.. good luck..
IPS3hWweaa	Its too late, give it up.<br>  <br>  You trying to see her is just making her mad and that's the only reaction you'll get from now on. You can't save everybody, but you can save yourself. Stay away from her and hope that one day she wakes up to what she is doing.<br>  <br>  But don't hold on to the false hope that someday she'll change her mind all out of the blue and crap and come crawling back to you.|`|JwnHKTabaa	try emailing her/writing her a note.<br>  <br>  you can't do much....sorry :(|`|g84BDZAmaa	she very well could be hiding that she still has feelings for you<br>  and as for showing her you still care....email her or call her or wright her telling her that what she is doing is wrong and that you truely care about her and that if she ever needs someone who will be there for her that someone is you|`|gMYoi210aa	dont worry man, later in life she will thank you...you saved her life!!! congratulations man! that must of taken a lot of courage...but yeah when she matures she will realize that YOU cared about her and not that other butthead right?|`|WLsS5vxsaa	Give her some time to cool off.

She dissed me just like that.  The best thing you can do is to just move on buddy and forget about her,  once she has made up her mind she will do nothing but humiliate you and take your self asteem.  She has to make her own mistakes man.  Its not your problem anymore dude.  Plus if you guys really did get back together how do you think you will be able to handle knowing the fact that she slept with dude?!?!?!?!   TRUST ME BRO!  You will find someone better!|`|3L0OSuQYaa	Unfortunately, sometimes you have to do  things that will make people "hate" you for a very long time. But if she ever gets out of the hole that she's putting herself in, she will most likely open her eyes and see that you were just trying to help her out.<br>  Just give it time and don't be too pushy.|`|Jhr68T0baa	firstly, she was cheating on you if she slept with someone 2 days after the break up. secondly shes young and careless at 16, remember what it was like. you got to involved but you did it out of care. send her a letter or get her talk to you, then leave her alone and move on|`|Zm3QIw4Taa	i think what you did was the right thing.. just keep trying to persuade her and tell her how you went down that rout and how it screwed upp your life and how you are trying to prevent her from making that mistake. if she still doesnt listen or talk it looks like you will have to move on =[[[|`|HSyRWWPcaa	Discover how to get your ex girlfriend back - read the articles below.|`|2gRrmPsvaa	Sounds to me like she did the first thing you shoulda done...MOVE ON!! She's not sleeping with a 19 year old just to get a point across, other than, "We're not getting back together." Simple as that. You've given so much attention to what she's been doing since you broke up, and I can't understand how you even knew she was smoking and drinking, unless either you smoked and drank with her or watched from outside the window like a lovesick puppy. And then who are you to go behind her back and tell her mom? You're NOT a couple anymore, and everything she does is HER business. So, yeah, she's pissed off. What do you expect? Women will be where they want to be, and with whoever they choose. I hope it doesn't seem like I'm bashing you, but I'm just being real. Move on, if you haven't by now.|`|58e4d09a1ce39667c8a3a34b2080e0c5aa	Ok Andrew you have done good so far that showing her you care but if doesnt want to stop and realize what path she is going down then you have to let her live her life and let her deal with those circumstances. Yes I know she may be feeling as she doesnt want to be around you at the moment but just call her or leave a message saying im here for you and i did what i did out of love. She may ignore it but as time passes she will eventually thank you. She may not realized it now but she will so give her time. Try to keep talking to her but if she still refuses somethime the best love is tough love so let her live and learn but tell her she still in your heart and that you will be ther for her always.|`|TSmego9vaa	all you can do is write to her or something? She needs to chose that she needs help. move on,that is her loss,not yours.|`|fe4a7c5e36d28eb34ebcf6d49980a6faaa	First of all you can not make someone love you. Either they do or they dont. She's 16 so she is still very young and probably not looking for something long term or anything of that sort. Was it right for you to tell her mom? Sure I guess, since you do care about her and her well being but don't expect her to see it that way. Again she is 16 and at the age were they go against others, especially their parents and want some freedom so you telling her mom might also make it worse b/c now she will have to sneek around. <br>  <br>  The only thing you can do is give her space. You put how you feel out there, now you have to wait for her. She might one day realize it all and want to be friends. But more than likely she will move on, you will move on and in a few months/years this wont matter to either of you.|`|wR3cwcXWaa	you did nothing wrong...you sound like a great guy....she screwed her life up and you just tried to help...right now she's confused...even if she hates you forever, you did the right thing.....you might have saved her life....

God bless and good luck in the future...........|`|a3bc6dde1a97d97de4492b5769f11f5aaa	please don't persuade her. she is obviously  not ready to have sex if you are trying to persuade her. sex comes naturally when both partners are ready.|`|1f330ffe7ca73129389fe13f220c7ce2aa	you dont get her to do it. she will when she wants.|`|AA11869769	.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Easy. First thing to know, you gotta always have her make the 1st move (which in reality is actually the final move of <br>  <br>  your own plan).  Get to know her, blah blah- go out a couple times, hang out and all that, talk on the phone with<br>  <br>   her. From all this contact you should be gauging where she stands in her sexuality. As you figure this out things<br>  <br>   should be logical from here. 1) If she's a ho, just set up a time/date to get together. 2) if she's about average <br>  <br>  sexually, start creating situations where sexual tone is indicated.. Ie; (you 2 alone doing any kind of activity at<br>  <br>   night.) 3) If she's a prude, then you got the waiting game-- however you can also try to put indirect pressure on her<br>  <br>   in this situation. _ Say she's on that bs about trying to 'wait' or she trys to avoid sex talk in conversations,  All<br>  <br>   you do is play it cool. Get closer to her, make her like you more and more.  Let her see you talking to another<br>  <br>   good looking ~(threatening)~ female. Keep your conversations with your girl in a level where you respect<br>  <br>   the no sex talk-- and thereby not giving all in to her in your conversations.- make sure she notices that. YET let<br>  <br>   her see you talking to other girls and your friends without regard (like you feel more comfortable talking to them <br>  <br>  than her).     One thing you can always count on is THE INSECURITY OF FEMALES. Once she gets the idea that you dont feel as comfortable with her as you do around other girls and your friends-- she will see this as possibly you Drifting from her; and consequentially with step up her game to try to get you to be more comfortable. From there its just a race to the finish ~~~ I cant give you a timelimit on these tactics because all women are different. Yet I just about guarantee they'll all work. The main part is just going out and meeting them and getting as far as "talking" and hanging out and all that.       <br>         <br>            And after all this typing your as s and other dude's out there better get some good use outta this advice.<br>   Good job son.|`|de59c58ef50b7e8b25e7a00686c4c563aa	If you just want sex, then ask out every woman you meet, eventually one will be horny.|`|e386b62c90e22a6a474418ace531cc97aa	You dont ask for it..it will come naturally whenever you are in a romantic position..|`|1c7ac8006f848dca19e64b921b14743aaa	well u could spike her drink or rape her behind the dust bin.

Each event has a theme that guests can choose to participate in, or simply come in and luxuriate in the provocative atmosphere. Clothing is optional and nudity is mandatory in the play areas. Somewhere between a NY dance club, burlesque show, a wine & cheese party and an erotic circus, these events are truly unique, and lovingly crafted by the team of people who put them on. They are open to mixed-sex couples, female-only couples, and single females. The events are private parties, so membership is required. The membership fee is very nominal, though, and the benefits are great! So plan to make the necessary arrangements to attend the next one.

My instinct is telling me that he's using your feelings for him as leverage to get something he wants..your money! don't get sucked into his little game, like I said, talk to him as much as you want but I wouldn't do anything for him.|`|8ec4224792b7f9091c4b75d7e169b0f0aa	Why wouldn't be? Relationships end. It's not the end of the world. It sounds like he is just trying to keep the friendship alive even though the romance is dead. As for his new girlfriend, he probably denied it because you put him on the spot. He figured it was a sensitive subject and didn't want to bring it up without having planned out what to say.|`|AA10968385	You need to buy a pesticide !|`|bb992d6a7faa5f06f997c8ed19d75b88aa	Try borrowing from him, he may do the vanishing trick.|`|004478262b3642c72e6ead4ba6def15faa	Because he has already a girlfriend, it is better to lessen the communication.

It really comes down to what are you getting out of the relationship. And when I say relationship, I don't mean Romantic Relationship. I mean, what are you getting out of the Friendship. Because if he just Leans on you, and that's it, than it will get old quick. And if he's telling you that he's not with someone else so that he can lean on you, borrow money etc., that's not cool either, because it messes with your head/emotions. Honesty is key in any Relationship, Romantic or other. Always weigh, in any situation, whether or not you are getting anything out of a relationship, or if you're just taking care of them. Friend or other.|`|AA11090790	the best thing is to let him go....just dont answer his calls anymore...|`|AA12148214	only you know him well enough but if it were me i would probably  want nothing to do with him considering he broke up with you!|`|AA11836472	i think its not he broke up with you weeks ago remember? maybe if he get back to you months after.|`|479ab563ac9c268e753efea6dbe22126aa	Gah', I was all for it til' the money thing.

8e1f140936dd7a827f6f2be48b9a9545aa	Concerning relationships, there are few things worse than a woman losing her b/f to her close girlfriend, it's embarrassing. Most men will "do" their g/f's friend if given the chance (especially if she's attractive). Savvy women know this an will observe their b/f's behavior around their g/f's - if they suspect that their b/f is getting too close to one of their girlfriends then some of them take proactive measures to create a comfortable distance.<br>  <br>  You admit that you like him - be certain that she sensed that and could envision possible scenario's between you and him. Likely she has put in time and effort to hold this b/f and maybe has long-term plans with him (marriage and kids). It's possible that she took this opportunity to derail some possible competition. Whether you remain friends with her is up to you but at least understand one possibility of why she may have done it.|`|8791ebfcea9c710679e2703ec57cf05faa	go up to her and give a hug to her and say i am sorry|`|368debaceb18373f39a94e78c100f2ddaa	i hate these situations... talk to your other friend and see what is going on... if nothing happens leave her alone for a while ....
3990988a80597687b2918aa91bce6727aa	I think you should think about your feelings you had before she came along! Maybe you just feel your bestfriend is going away to a girlfriend My BFF felt like that and she hated him, we were always together until he came along. OR it could mean that you have feelings for him, but seriously think about your feelings before JC came along.. GOODLUCK!!! I hope you don't nag to him! dont do that...kay!|`|e5cd27cc0c3f414cfdb45d12322675faaa	Well, may be you really don't want him but you also don't want anyone else to have him. I know that sounded really snobby and bitchy to say, but its really not. I've experienced this many times. Take some time to analyze your feelings for him and remember, you can't force yourself to like someone in a more-than-friend way. May be your afraid she'll come between you two and take time away from you two being together. Its tough sometimes but I guarantee if you don't really like this guy for more of a friend now, you won't down the road. But, if you do like him, be sure about your feelings. Then, take charge!|`|01153ee4a5c79fd2f89196319c887bd1aa	First of all, Take it Easy... This is Life... It's just Tricky sometimes...<br>  <br>  You're very good friends with him, obviously... And the Truth is, Friendship is the Foundation of a Good Romantic Relationship...<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that the two of you should get involved further, I'm just saying that you may feel that this Girl Threatens to take away what you Do Have with him... A Good Friendship... As far as Jealously goes, that could be for all sorts of reasons... You need to ask yourself, is it just because she's attractive... That's not her fault... She was born that way... And more than that, Pretty much everyone has a Chance at Love, not just the Pretty one's...<br>  <br>  If you're not interested in him romantically, than don't worry about it... Things Change... Relationships (Friendships) Change sometimes too... Do you want to Date Him? If the answer is No, than don't worry about it... If the answer is Maybe, well then you better let him know... Because he might be going off the Market soon...|`|3f39a65307511b344c55843d3d63132daa	up urs y should i give a damn shoot ur JC friend lol|`|968f8d18aa6a49a6981207aad3c02d9daa	i think you should have a talk with your best friend and tell him you miss being with him and tell him why and then just try to be there if he ever need you and if your feeling goes deeper then friendship tell him before he get to involved with jc good luck|`|AA11624677	well apperently u have feelings for him freindly or more than that i say ask him about it i mean hes not going to give u a straight up answer like yes i like her or i like you but just keep talking to him and be there for him besides if the two do go out her and ck then they can break up u can be there for him and i gareentee he'll be yours|`|92062b36c65c4730d9f2e9cf11e8ac53aa	Well I think you feel threatened by JC because you feel inferior than her, you shouldn't feel that way, everyone is unique in their own way, and I'm sure she isn't as perfect as you might think, so don't underestimate yourself! And you are very close to CK, so you probably think that if he starts to notice JC he will ignore you and forget about you completely, if he's really your friend he won't stop talking to you only because he has a girlfriend or another friend....But if you think you might have feelings for him, then try to talk to him.....but maybe you feel the way you do because you're very close to him, that also happens between brothers and sisters and it doesn't necessarily mean they have something for their sibling, am I making sense? So just ask yourself that question: "Do I like CK as something else other than just my friend?" and depending on your answer, take it from there, and remember don't feel inferior than others, I'm sure that you have other qualities that make other girls envy you even that girl JC!! Good Luck|`|AA10098492	If you have feelings for the guy, tell him. If you don't have feelings or concider yourself more than friends, then you don't have any room to say anything at all. It sounds like to me you have feelings and don't know how to express it to him. Why don't you, before the two of them get serious, ask him how he feels about you. If he says just friends, then you will know where you stand. If he says he wishes you were more than friends, then you will know where to go with the relationship. It's just my apinion, but I think you have feelings for the guy, but who am I to say.|`|a04b45405ce4c06c90e1ee0605862260aa	Since your best friends with this CK you could ask him if he likes Jc.You could tell him that you like him and wish to be more then friends ect. If he doesn't like JC and he like you try to make a move.|`|ba4c747c7402a72f83140e5573bb9f09aa	umm first off to whoever said up urs up there ^^^ you really dont have to care.. but then dont answer either.. your on here to listen to peoples questions as well as ask some.. you obviously cared enough to read her problem<br>  <br>  anyways... ive actually had this happen before and i know exactly what you mean it sucks.. you could have feelings for him i dont know but .. if you did you probly would have noticed them without JC being around..you might just feel threatened that if they like eachother and date then you wont see him anymore and that he might have a different girl than you to hang out with.. everyone sees you as cami and CK and you dont want people to start seeing JC and CK .. hes your best guy friend and you dont want him to find another girl that he likes more than you.  this could be wrong but thing about your feelings too.. you might like him.<br>  <br>  hope i helped.. good luck|`|bdcc24fda3d3f2fa473b2dd6105296a2aa	I think you have feelings for this young man, I think it is healthy to be a little jealous of the other girl but not to an obsessive point. If you like this boy you should explain it to him just as you have online and discuss it with him. As far as you being 'pretty' beauty is in the eye of the beholder and if you don't like YOU then why would ck or any other boy? You must like YOU before you can like anyone else. I don't believe jc is perfect either, Im sure she has flaws and quirks just like all of us. So find something POSITIVE about you that is 'no match' for jc and concentrate on building YOU up and keep busy like you are with school, clubs, and other friends after your talk with ck and just see how things pan out. Don't take it personally if you do not get the response you want. I would suggest to keep an open mind and open heart about his reaction to your feelings for him so that you will not be too let down if he isn't receptive or too excited if he is. Remember only YOU can control YOUR emotions.
390236e357a2e677354d9786882557f3aa	Im guessin your question is how can you stop thinking about somone. If so, obviously they really like this person, so chances are there gonna constantly be on your mind. So the only thing to do is to let them know you have feelings so they can hook up or by getting someone else to call your own.|`|d5880549f430ad6bada9c98bed624dcdaa	If you already THANKED that person, I would THINK that would be enough !|`|AA10128512	you can't, even if you tell yourself not to think about them, you're still thinking about them by telling your self not to think about them, saying that no matter how hard your try not to just makes it worse and you keep thinking about them.|`|AA10377245	why u want to quit thinking about a person...there more u try to quit the more u think abt the person...better solution think about more people ...may be a person better than this person...|`|f0edb72c8499f2a5207440633fb5d443aa	I don't think you can, unfortunately. And especially when you try to not think of them, it seems that you think of them even more. The great paradox. I think that the only cure for it is time...after a while it'll probably wear off. Could be a long while, but it'll happen, and you'll find yourself thinking of them less and less.<br>  <br>  But really, there's no harm in thinking about someone, especially if thinking of them makes you happy. If it makes you happy, then why not!<br>  <br>  It's a very sweet question, aww :).
79b035ad755d2b3a4877f7667cfd610caa	Well....There are different types of way to express love to someone you really love. Some people send flower and things that are expensive. Some people read poetry to their love ones. And manny lots of ways. You can do any of the way you wish to express a girl. But the most important thing about all this , is the heart. Which is EXPRESS IT WITH YOUR HEART.Then it will only be the most wonderful way of expresing it to someone you love most. GOOD LUCK!|`|de1404f392b1baabc65f1b773ff48553aa	2 love without condition, 2 talk without intention, 2 give without reason. n care care without expectation is the art of true relation  <br>  ALWAYS REMEMBER.......

9f70028ef1a1ee5fac05402a79a7274aaa	Well, proposing and getting married are two different things.  You could propose tomorrow, but you will still be setting the date for some time next year probably.  If you know she will respond favorably, propose as soon as you want.  Only you know what is right for you and her!|`|0b09e77e84e77844850e09ff87b52905aa	There is no hard and fast rules or calendar of events with relationships.  The rules I set for myself are: I wouldn't even think it was serious until we had been exclusive and together for 6 months; I would never marry, or even propose, for at least a year from exclusively dating.  There could be all kinds of barriers, skeletons,etc.....you haven't seen yet.  You are just infatuated right now.  Relish it.  It's a nice feeling.  But, will it last 20,30, 40 years??  Try some up and down times before you jump the broom.|`|640447919365f9b5be8f3ad382573998aa	Wait for 2 years total. Trust me, you really don't know this girl enough yet. Skeletons will eventually start coming out of the closet. If you can handle those after two years, you two can probably last through a marriage.|`|99c37f598c1c82c68de17784567bf5edaa	At 30, I think one year is ideal, but if that's too long at least 6 months. You are both infatuated with each other right now, all good things come in time.|`|f2cc569f92bb1570b53bfbbc7466f8ffaa	I would give it a year at least.  I've had relationships in excess of 4 years that ended up not working out.  You'll know pretty well where you sit after about a year, but every relationship is different.  The first few months are always a lot of fun and exciting though...|`|AA11543760	Maybe you two should wait a little while longer first, because proposing to her so early into the relationship could destroy it.|`|b02239e8ce7c84104f4174bd61f03205aa	wow! when you feel you have the "balls" to do it:) and i mean that with respect! good luck:)
99c37f598c1c82c68de17784567bf5edaa	A little advice.....it sounds like your younger, let her make the first moves and you CHILL and play hard to get....even reluctant.  Most likely you will get the desired result's.  Sorry but love is like a chess game it is human nature.|`|00e47b0467b089b6749ef01c0fa9bef1aa	if you don't have chemistry or good communication, or if you want things from the relationship that she won't give, then maybe you should find someone who better suits you.  try not to fight, but just have a discussion about how the mixed messages make you feel.  let her know that you don't want to make her uncomfortable but you tried to take another step because she said she was comfortable only to change her mind and make you feel like a jack ***.  if she doesn't mind that she made you feel like a jack ***, and thinks she is justified in changing her mind like that, then def kick her to the curb, where this would be only the beginning of her antics.|`|28cfebad2896bd2d45db8c5189066ed0aa	well this is what you do,since its like that if you really like her and want to be with her you should be able to talk about anything and everything. tell her that the problem with her is that she says one thing and then says another. that is something i call leading a person on and thats not good in a relationship. if she is your girl then you should be albe to touch her wherever ans whenever ir she said so. she gave you permission to touch her because she said that she liked it. what i think you should do is break up with her because it seems like she doesnt know what she wants and there are plenty of woman out here who want a man to touch her and just be with her.|`|8e9b7048ed8702b7344e07e27f6f2c6eaa	You should ask her to be truthful when she talks to you and not to just say what she thinks you want to hear.  Be sure to really listen to her answer, body language etc and tell her you are having a hard time understanding what she really likes and what she doesn't|`|cf3aac9c5c7431e016ad938c243a85afaa	know what the cool thing about getting older is?  you suddenly realize that the truth is such a convenient tool for finding stuff out.
19adfffe777e515938b5ff12df8338fbaa	Well, it really depends on the situation. If she hated her ex, and is looking and ready for a new relationship, then ask her out when you think your friendship has developed to where you can take it to the next level. If she still talks about how nice and great her ex was, then I would wait if I were you. If it's the case, just be a good listener,and ask her out after she gets over the ex. Good luck.|`|50073dbd5ecac430d78adbf7aa450341aa	Keep talking to her, and ask her to meet you somewhere with a group of friends.  Take your time and allow her the privilege of finding out what a great person you are.  You cannot force her to like you, only invite her....|`|9f1f3f2deb7f8bf92a5e2e9a1be14301aa	Ask her out!|`|AA11900792	well when you talk to this girl again you should ask her out like to lunch or dinner and then if she says yes my advice worked...lol

f0edb72c8499f2a5207440633fb5d443aa	Well, she's really got to tell him that she's not into him. It'd be seriously hard, but it's what has to be done since it's not nice to play around with people's hearts. And then he'll always be around and she'll just find him super annoying. But if she just tells him flat out (but nicely) that she doesn't like him in that way, then he'll leave her alone.<br>  <br>  Having someone chase you isn't so fun when you don't ever want to be with them, so it's better to just save your sanity and get the bad news over with :).

Maybe he has someone else on the side...... Ask his friends and family...... or just be up front an honest ask are you cheating? Most men usually fess up when caught.

And if he chooses you, then trust him until he gives you a reason not to. But at the same time I know how ex-girlfriends can be. Jealous!

You say she was a little too quiet for you? You should've realized that about her personality before you got married. I think she cheated on you to give you a dose of your own medicine. The Co-Worker means nothing. Why would you want to get back with her when you just said that she doesn't know how to treat a man. You'll only cheat again.
46ccac117ad9aa95624a90cb2b543387aa	Well, not all guys are lazy when it concerns a girl they like, trust me on this. But maybe he's very insecure and as he suggested himself, maybe he's afraid of rejection too. You should have an important talk with this guy. Express him how you feel about him. If both of you are too afraid to say how they feel, this will eventually break you two up. Make him feel comfortable in expressing his own feelings. Being sensitive is always a little bit harder on guys than on girls. Take that to mind. Give him some room in his ways of expression. Somethings might be a little difficult for him to say. And don't forget to speak your own mind aswell. Just sit down with him, and have a real long talk. Just take some time for this. If it feels too forced, then just do it some other day. But don't give up on it too soon, girl, because it sound to me like he's in to you big time. I hope it works out...|`|7f02ebb4b2cf124dbef00e7d84b8ddfdaa	The best thing to do is let is happen naturally, if you try to hard  you may end up losing a friend, and getting hurt in the end..but if you want to know just ask him.......ask him|`|fe073e42652cae140ad5a77efb1fed7aaa	omg go for it!! you guys seem MENT for each other. :-D|`|758d8348e9bf3a1795b6a2bad265f83baa	he is hot for you. it is now your turn to let him know just how ready or not you be.|`|525f4fa6b321158328dda3f109fbbb35aa	You should go for it, he is giving you all the hints you can get.

But some people change drastically, and then it's like they are a different person, next to the one they were before. <br>  And then there's also the sex-change thing. They blossom once they got their true gender. And then they are truly transformed. And therefor basically be someone else. <br>  And there are also the lying types; they say; I'm this and that, and turn out to be somebody else completely.<br>  And not to forget the actors and actresses. They can get so emotionally deep in to the characters they are playing. That, at that very moment they are playing, they're someone else.|`|3971c7703c6858d495b399f2fd78d4c6aa	well it seems there's a lot of people on the Internet that act like someone else other then who they really are. ;o)|`|AA11292734	Except in acting for all I know.

AA11608012	The best approach is going and asking her directly. If she tells you she is not interested, move on. Though this will really hurt your feelings, you will only get more hurt by chasing her and watching her make you look foolish. <br>  <br>  My advice: Go straight to the source.|`|AA11344652	you should just ask her stright out do you like me because I like you and would like to be with you|`|46ccac117ad9aa95624a90cb2b543387aa	Not being shy at others except you, could mean that you're just more special to her. So maybe she's unsure of her self with you? It's just a guess.<br>  Could also be that she likes being chased. Which isn't very nice on you. But it could still mean she is in love with you, but likes to be chased. Some girls seem to feel more special because of the whole chase-thing somehow.<br>  Or maybe she's just playing with you. And that's just nasty. In that case; ignore her. Try to forget her.<br>  Just get her to talk to you, and find out. Maybe tell her that you feel hurt? <br>  Other wise, try and ignore her a little and see if she comes to you. And if she doesn't, you might wanna try to move on, and forget her.<br>  I hope you find out what her problem is. And i hope things work out for you. Good luck...|`|AA11664418	It sounds like you just need to back away and give her some space. Don't waste all your time waiting on her. Her feelings seem wishy washy to me. If she wants to talk to you then she will especially since she isn't shy around anyone else. Most times when you stop paying someone attention they tend to notice you more.

I say try to bare it for 2 more years then you can move out.  I also encourage you to talk to a counselor.  Look in your phone book for your local county based mental health facility.  Maybe they can direct you to a social worker who can advocate for you.  Your mother is mentally ill and it's not fair that you have to suffer because of it.  Realize that you can cut your mother off.  You don't need to have her in your life if she's not respectful to you and doing the best for you.  <br>  <br>  I also encourage you to stay safe with your boyfriend do NOT get pregnant.

Can I challenge you to look at things LONG TERM.  Honor and Repect are key to any relationship.  God has placed in families for a reason.  Long Term...if you do not honor your mom, someday when you have kids they will not honor or respect you.<br>  <br>  Courtship protect you.  I set in my heart that I will not start a relationship until I was ready to enter into marriage.  I was a long road.  In relationship you have to work at them extremely hard to make them work and when they don't you have much heartache and pains.  Then if you don't work at healing those areas, you will have scars as you enter into new relationship which are unfair you and to the next person.<br>  <br>  In courtship if either of you can not HONOR and RESPECT each other before marriage, do you think that they will DURING the marriage?  A very challeging book on this subject is I Kissed Dating Goodbye.  I challege teens/singles to read it and try to understand why courtship is a safe alternative.

When I was in middle school there was this kid who wwould not leave me aloneto the point of stalking... my parents had to come in and talk to the principal several time b/c this kis was mentally handicapped and there wasnt anything they could do about it, so my best advice would be, be cautious, dont get freaked out, if he is handicapped there is probably no threat, handicapped people get crushes just like we do, he probably has an innocent crush on you, just be nice to him and dont give him the wrong signals! I'm sure it will fade away as soon as he finds a new muse! Hope this helps you!

I would watch the way she does look at you and if you get the feeling "yeh she has to have something in her head about me" then i would just meet her after a class of if u two have a class together just end up talking and maybe getting a number. There are always the friends to talk to too (as in her friends) but I would think it's a little bit more meaningful if you just go for it on your own and show you have the gusts to even ask. Just don't ask like your an elementary kid acting like "oh I like her blah blah." Another thing...you can't love someone if you don't know there person from the inside. I agree after you get to talking you'll start to know what your feelings are feeling.

You need to work on saving you marriage as equals and as equally interested parties.<br>  <br>  You might not want a divorce (good for you, don't give up so easily) but don't let him use that as a way of manipulating you.  You need to stay separated while you work out your problems.  For the most part you should only have contact on that basis.  Unless its really necessary, don't interact with him outside of counselling, otherwise there isn't really a separation and therefore no need to work on reconciling your separation back into a healthy marriage.<br>  <br>  If in the end you have to let him go because you can't have a healthy relationship with him, so be it, don't be a sucker.<br>  <br>  P.S. its the separation, a total separation, that should help him reach his break-through moment.

AA10096816	To meet that type of person you have to take away the 'fun in the sack'.<br>  <br>  Building a relationship with someone is difficult enough, you have a child, which, in its own, causes new problems when you are getting to know someone.  <br>  <br>  You have to first think of your child, dont over expose them to new people every few months.  Even if the child is very young, this is not acceptable.<br>  <br>  Secondly, you have to come to terms with your realationship issues.  You cant go around thinking that you are not validated unless you are in a realtionship.  You have to first be happy with yourself.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, its not WHERE to meet a nice man, its HOW to meet them.  <br>  <br>  If you want a real realationship, with love, friendship, trust and compassion, you should first build that first.  When you meet someone new, date them, dont just think, 'fun in the sack'. <br>  <br>  Do something fun together, get to know that person for who they are, let them get to know you.  Hang out with that person, let them into your life slowly.  Hang out with different TYPES of people then the ones you are normally attracted to.  <br>  <br>  Build a friendship with that person.  Become intimate with that person BEFORE you even REACH the bedroom.  Then introduce them to your child, let them see you as a mother and let them know that you are responsible for your child, and that your child is more important to you than anything.<br>  <br>  By putting this across early, it will let people know upfront that you are not looking for someone to come in and help you pay your bills, but that you are strong and able to care for yourself and your child by yourself.<br>  <br>  Then, when you have gotten to know this person, can you start to have REAL fun in the sack.  Because you will ahve a bond with that person that is strong and lasting.  This person may not be your husband, but he will always be a good friend.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|015a5f0f64bc98b7d98d908bc1a89172aa	i do think that|`|165ba0411a63ab20a2fb14145501bf2aaa	dont give up in your search, youll find your man, i am sure of it n.n|`|49f5d7723659c7c13e08a77448268e40aa	Where are you meeting guys now?

He will love you, and your little girl, and enjoy your friendship and companionship. Keep looking.....he's out there! Good Luck!|`|473a8737b27df1a8b706823ed912d275aa	Those guys are out there. Please be patient and you will find them.|`|5e4a73585a3a104e8426d960b035079baa	They don't want to be a father to some other guy's spawn.|`|644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	Many church groups have singles' clubs, although this is no guarantee that the men you meet there won't be interested in sex also.<br>  <br>  You have to be firm at the beginning of your relationship, but you must be flexible enough to let nature take its course also.|`|96bfecaf45116c30d89d3698d4e3050daa	At the guy store.  Seriously, though just about everywhere.   Smile and hold your head up, you'll be suprised who initiates conversation with you.|`|ac38764678611b9ec9f56d763367ce91aa	Well... as a guy, I will stand up and say that my new years resolution is to not expect one thing from a lady anymore.<br>  <br>  We all want the same things: To educate ourselves, to be successful in what we do, and to fall in love.<br>  <br>  After a failed marriage and LOTS of time to think I now know, that relationships go through ups and downs, and it's not all wild romance and goot times in the sack.<br>  <br>  Relationships take more to build, and it is so easy to get "fleet feet" when the next one inline is ready to get wild.<br>  <br>  So I think with that being the case, the kinds of guys like that are going to be few and far between.. sadly.<br>  <br>  But we (me on my best days) are out there.
86c49a26ca14453b16c640729c2f0ee1aa	I think going to church is a great idea, it will help you find a lot of people with strong morals and beliefs, and it can strengthen your relationship with God so that in hard times, you do have a friend to comfort you. Also, joining clubs are a great idea and getting a job is a wonderful idea. Getting a job helps you to become more independent, successful, hardworking, and, oviously, helps you out financially. It will also allow you to meet new people, through both customers and co-workers. If none of those really seem like your thing, you could always try going to bars and parties near your campus to meet new peopl. I hope that helped, have a great New Year!!!<br>  <br>  Oh, and also try to reach out to people during classes, ask them about their family, friends, job, home town, hobbies, etc. Just be warm and show a real, genuine interest. People will be very attracted to that.|`|b497c1dd5f4ebb9a467304e614c291aaaa	I would join a club or two where people have similar interests to you. That way you have a chance of meeting people who share your interests rather than just some random people who are there for other purposes.<br>  <br>  Volunteering is a nice thing to do though, and more power to you on that.|`|01909fee3655e32929e012c0d8b6e520aa	Those were all good ideas, and about the only thing you CAN do. Try them all, in moderation, if you can. You sound very nice, you should make friends in no time!|`|90fa5628c30c83d33bf26fc13850ce64aa	The church thing sounds good. Especially if they have alot of activities. You never know who you'll meet there. Volunteering is also a great idea. Maybe you can volunteer through things at church!|`|AA10216227	i am your friend|`|dd3fadc2aabea0f4290576ef45cd2420aa	talk to people. just say hi, how are you and stuff. make connections etc.|`|84f9d878c516c415f3768080d46c5326aa	I think you're on the right track in getting involved with a group - therefore opening the door to meeting more people.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately you can't make people like you or make them be your friend, it's just something that has to just happen.  Just be yourself and you'll attract the right people who want to be your friends because they will like you for you.  If you try to be someone you're not (not saying that you are) then it becomes phoney and you'll attract people who aren't into you necessarily but are attracted to this personality you've created.<br>  <br>  I think getting a job, perhaps in something related to customer service will help a lot!  I was really quiet and shy as a kid and that all changed when I got a job at a grocery store because I was forced to come out of my shell and interact with people.  It helped my self esteem level and helped me communicate better with people = more friends.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Now's the time to do it seeing as we're heading into a new year!!|`|aa871675bf7ebff6fb1db6925bac3873aa	Hey, I'm in the same situation. The only difference is that in highschool, everyone was just plain mean!<br>  <br>  I like your ideas, I'm planning to go volunteer somewhere. Going someplace where you know people have a good heart and want to meet you is where to start I believe.<br>  <br>  good luck to you!|`|e723715785d93a592381e3ae20d96f20aa	Tell someone do you want to be my friend?<br>  If she/he says no, say:I'm telling...

7f45a7d2de45375e0bd049e692e3f6acaa	Parents will not always see eye to eye with your boyfriends.<br>  Fights do happen. I can understand why your boyfriend might be so reluctant to try to patch things up. He is being a little hard headed about it. I don't know how old you are so I would give you the best advice in the situation as I can. If you are young, then I would not worry too much about it because your bf will either come to his senses or he won't .<br>  If you are older, he might be a little more understanding about your feelings if you explain to him how important it is to you that they work things out. If he accepts to hanging out with you, just make sure to make it a short visit just so they can get used to seeing each other again. Extend the visitations a little longer each time. Guys are guys and they'll eventually be like "what did we fight about?" Good luck to you. Just remember that family will ALWAYS be a constant in your life.|`|f0694cf5fb76276a79f4bfa4bb8d5cd7aa	dad made the frist step he'll come around all boys are hard headed give em time|`|AA12067291	first you need to find out a couple things about him in this situation. is he being hard headed because hes trying to manipulate you? if so hit him were it counts and call him on it! that would have the most impact on me in this situation. or he also might just want to hear directly from your pops that he is allowed back at your place. the other thing he might be trying to tell you is that he really never did feel comfortable at your place and this is just a good excuse not to come over. if thats the case, try suggesting some where else you two could hang out.|`|a723d7f9e22e35b91daf833408494e08aa	It sounds to me that the kid has a lot of his own personal issues to deal with and either fear of pops or another relationship. find out if he truly cares for you. if he does he wont let anything keep you apart.
50073dbd5ecac430d78adbf7aa450341aa	Good question.  Being retired military myself, I would probably not go to the Chaplain, because their answers are going to be tied down with their particular dogma and religious beliefs.  Depending on where you are stationed, you might want to try some life coaches, or even AA, or like that.  Work on yourself, as you might not have any control over him.  You are the person you should take care of (am looking over this, and am not criticizing you, just suggesting that you take care of yourself, you are the most important one in the relationship)|`|AA12066168	I am ex-Army, and yes, the Chaplain's Office should be able to help you.  Often they are bound by the rules of confidentiality that affect all ministers, so I don't think you can get your husband in trouble directly by contacting them.  In any case, tell the truth; for him to get help for his addictions and to find safety are more important than his Army career anyway.|`|1be85a06b962006a278f54174971311baa	Yes the Chaplains office should be able to help, and it should not get back to his chain of command and effect his career.  I am retired military myself so I have been there.  Good luck.|`|AA10293121	That is a tough one, do you have one of his rosters laying around so that you can get in contact with his leader. You can go to the chaplain, however it may still effect his career, but you have to look out for you, being married to a soldier isnt easy because what ever effects him, its going to effect you too.|`|AA11355873	Me being a military wife I feel what your going through and its hard and YES the chaplain should and will help you get down to business there are ways in fionding out who your husband command is and they can tell you if he is U A or not is he isnt catch his butt while he is at work. On base there is also a military operater that u can call just give them ur hubby name and she will give u the phone number.   GOOD LUCK
806cfcfd54c819f2d72dcca3e2690d12aa	A person can still have thoughts of love for a former lover, spouse blah, blah, blah. That's why its extremely important to bond with the person you are with and commit honestly to them.<br>  <br>  The feelings of love do remain after a relationship ends. New relationships normally eliminate (overtime) thoughts of previous experiences. However the person still having those feeling MUST understand they are now committed to someone else and to refrain from placing themselves in situations that can get them into trouble. <br>  <br>  I only wish my wife had the sense to understand that. It's a common sense thing as far as I'm concerned.|`|e24d33c25863df1ebee83a512ee14af1aa	I wouldn't say all men love their ex-wives. I believe mine does, b/c he has told me so.

Of couse she is a hard core alcoholic, and cheated on him all the time, so I can kind of understand why.|`|7aea38c2dda9874b11ef7be8bb93eed8aa	It depends on the split, but I think that if you married for love (and not for money or some other reason) that you will always harbor feelings for the other person.  Though the fond feelings may be hard to see through the haze of dislike - sharing a life for even a short time bonds two people, and even moreso if a child results from the union.|`|AA11644969	Depends on which one were talking about here.  I have 3 ex's<br>  <br>  the 1st and 3rd i still have feelings for, the 2nd one i really hate her guts. <br>  <br>  But my current wife is simply the best woman i've ever met in my life.|`|7ddfbf103ba6054afccafad49d526b25aa	I do believe they all love their ex-wives.  When you marry someone, that strong feeling can diminish but never vanish. I don't think all men are still in love with their ex-wives though. Being in love and loving someone is totally different, so yes, I think once you've been through so much together, it's never forgotten and feelings still exist.
536e3d62cde69387e086bc477cc68811aa	I'm very sorry to hear that about your mom.  I'm not going to pretend to know what you and your family are going thru.  I think it's good that you are trying to think about the positives.  I think you are off to a good start.

I hoped that helped|`|4da51cc59832c68b4beeb806c391cb72aa	everyone's greiving period is different. you should try to make a scrapbook with pictures and things that remind you of her. it might be hard to do but it may also help you feel better. <br>  <br>  i'm sorry :(     i hope this helps|`|283bc74a4504e0bd40f1ec3ba814465faa	Well, Honestly..you must think what does your mother want you to do. she wouldnt want you to cry when you think of her.

She lives within the very essence of your soul. It took me almost 15 years to not feel a sharp pain in my chest when I mentioned my dads name or thought of him. Today I am able to speak, or even write about him, and I feel joy deep within my heart, I feel blessed that I was his baby girl and  he was my daddy. I feel blessed that all I am today is thanks to the wonderful foundation he gave me. Have faith my child,  have faith.<br>  It will get better over time.<br>  You can begin a hobby also, that helped me. I began to ride horses.

You can't force someone to say I love you, its something they have to feel.  And when you push people into saying it it causes them to retreat.  Tell your friend when the time is right he'll tell her!|`|AA10841270	Dont force it. It takes 3 seconds to say I love you, but a life time to mean it. Why are you so worried about it?

Just remeber,you dont have to change anything about urself for anyone. The right guy will love u for who u r. U just have to give everyone a chance and get to know more people.

Don't worry about everybody not liking you.  Find a guy you like and go after him.  This is the 21st century.  You seem confident enough in who you are.  Guys need some sign that you're interested before they know it's ok to go for it.  Focus on being yourself, and here's the hardest part, don't worry about things and they'll probably take care of themselves.  Go to social situations to have a good time and you will.  Don't constantly fret about this issue.  It'll work out. I promise.|`|58b05a42d78f0df863773877c01f7007aa	Go see a dermatologists, take care of your skin and you will feel better about yourself, also, you may have not found the right guy for you yet.

Be patient.  It will work out.|`|569b52e9f2702299d9ac9e8475574e6baa	First of all, most guys aren't really READY for girls...they talk the talk but they are immature and just seek out the hotties and do the ape dance you know?  <br>  <br>  You're at a certain age, and it's difficult.  You'll find in another year or two you will have guys noticing you left, right and center.  If you want to be noticed just be yourself.  Have fun, enjoy what you do, join clubs, debate teams, sports etc. and you will have all kinds of friends, male and female and I bet you anything when the right guy notices you, that you will know and he will have been worth the wait.|`|AA11974917	dont' know......but whats that smell?|`|a637d0b672c011b905c0c865bc2ea40eaa	I wish I knew the answer.

Someone you can talk to, who shares common interests with you, and who you can laugh with.  Girls very often fall for their male friends, so stop looking for a girlfriend, and start looking for a female friend.

If you get a bit more self-confidence, then that should help you out a lot; you have to learn to love yourself before you can love someone else. Have a bit of self-confidence and believe in yourself. Be more optimistic than you were and try to be happy. Sad people generally don't attract the right type of attention.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps - <br>  Good luck! <br>  <br>  MaybeLater_x|`|16c8e203cf16f456891020ea8b715610aa	With all these qualities, better try to find a boyfriend.|`|02a3aa56f12facd0557c683d42ccc66baa	What do you need a girlfriend for?

Learn to like yourself first and others will also trust me it sounds like a cliche but its very very true. However girls arent that hard to please as long as you remember one main thing. Treat them with respect and they love a guy with confidence. Women really dont like weak men or crybabys. As i am so fond of saying, women want to know a man is sensitive enough to cry, they just dont wanna see it. Women love men who are confident not cocky and make them feel protected. Yet at the same time they want to feel like they are equal and in charge sometimes so just be real and dont be weak. Have some guts and go up to a yoing lady you like and take the chance. After all she is just a girl. Its not like your interviewing her for your only chance to get into heaven. If she blows ya off there are many many others and one thing i know for sure is women are less concerned with your physical appearance than men are with theirs. Women truly love to be with men who make them laugh and make them feel loved and protected. Just work up that self esteem as i said and love yourself for who you are because if you come off as someone who has low self image they will see that as a sign of weakness and look at you as just another little boy.|`|fc15f244c2eb3dbf21ef8da5b0fd9068aa	well. first off, you have got to start dealing with your self-esteem and better build up a very confident you (but not too much). and.. don't dread the single life. it may just be much fun that you ever thought it would be.<br>  <br>  if you don't learn how to be happy, content with your self then you won't ever be happy with anyone. :)

feb0df556be60b6ae1592e3a13327aedaa	One of the easiest ways to know if a guy likes you is if he gives you quick glances and stares at you every so often. Watch him and if he looks at you quite often from time to time, HE LIKES YOU! <br>  If you are hanging out with a guy you usually don't hang out with and that could be a possible boyfriend, the guy that likes you will become interested and will stare at you and the guy you are hanging out with. If he is the bold type he might try to become involved with the two of you which definitely means he likes you!!! <br>  If he talks to your friends a lot he probably likes you. <br>  If he tries to be near you and suddenly takes an interest in things you like, he likes you. <br>  If he talks to you and acknowledges you in some way, this is a sure sign he likes you! <br>  If he tries to make you laugh or says stuff sarcastically that he thinks is funny, again he most likely likes you. <br>  Lastly, if he is nervous around you, he likes you.|`|1bf0380da1835c1c3f0f7b7fa80f3802aa	if he looks once and then u notice him look again thats obvious because he likes you looks,,,if he play games with you stuff and teases you a lil thats used somtimes|`|da1c493796002141d0e807dc45d9b61faa	I would smile, catch myself staring, and say some stupid things that made no sense.

Think long and hard.|`|c28127c4f8927379df4637b0dfb66168aa	First of, how fresh is your relationship with that person?<br>  You have to understand that people show their feelings for others in strange ways, but the best way you will know if he like/love you or not is look deep into his eyes and search for your answer. At least that's what always work for me and the majority of the friends that i have. You also have to understand that this life we are living is very strange, just because you love someone that doesn't mean the person love you back, even if  you stay up all night thinking about them, it's just life.

b1d2f5cb299a38a3d1c2d9d79b9b7939aa	LEGALLY - you have really no obligations unless you want to lose your home/apartment, have bad credit, etc.  If you want your wife to have custody of your children (if you have them) then you will be okay, but if you want custody you better stay put as she can prove abandonment.  If the court hasn't awarded any monetary amounts and you haven't legally decided who should pay what bills, you don't HAVE to do anything. <br>  <br>  MORALLY - You need to help out with house/rent payments and what your wife would need to take care of the children.  Whatever bills are in your name you should definitely take care.  Your wife can also choose to not pay the bills and if they are in both of your names your credit can definitely go down the tubes.  If the house is in your name and you haven't legally been given ownership and she doesn't pay the mortgage they will come after you...as well as car payments, etc.  If you want to get anything done right away as far as kids are concerned, you will want to go to court to get a temporary custody order - they usually last for 90 days until you get a court date.|`|10c2049a3c8bf7bd0bdd427df0e9c4d5aa	Got kids.? it all depends on if you love her or not.

It could be anything from stress to not eating properly.  The only way you're going to discover the reason behind it is to talk with the significant other.  If you two can't figure it out, then you'll have to bring in a therapist.|`|AA11460234	Well...if I were you I'd seek therapy. Its not normal for a woman your age not to enjoy sex.

It might take a while.  My wife went on the nuva ring and the hormone avalanche caused her to have no sex drive for 7 months.  We got through it though, thank god.....<br>  <br>  If after all strong efforts are exhausted, what else can you do?|`|015dce40d53e66fd4daa47f21fc394a6aa	This is a great question... My first husband and I did not have sex until we got married. He was a great guy and he loved me very much. On our wedding night when we ya know did it well he had the smallest penis I had ever seen. We weren't virgins or anything we just wanted to wait and make it special. It wasn't special at all. I cried all night. It was so upsetting to know I married someone who was never going to be able to make me happy in bed. 4 months later we got a divorce. I'm not telling you to go get a divorce but sex is a big part of a marriage and if you love sex and your husband isn't able to make you happy then your going to end up looking somewhere else for it. You need to have a long talk with him about how he needs to change the way he does things. If you don't you marriage will not work. One of you will get tired of it. Good luck|`|AA11457426	If you have sex the same way you write the english language, communication could be the problem.|`|AA11511817	you said "married"--for better or worse, good time and bad.  even if the bad times last for decades.  you took the vow, you live with the vow.  seek some therapy and talk about it.  it may never resolve itslelf, but it may never.  get a "bob" and live with it.  as long as he's not abusing you...what did you vow?|`|c066933cca664ac999330dd72080d9a4aa	You need to spread that p*ssy and let him pound it the way he knows how.

29b63369675d1ab4a94cab2caf776a0caa	Brother, that is the question of the century. "How can i tell if she likes me or not? What should i do? Should i talk to her? I might look like and idiot"<br>  Chances are, she finds you attractive and would like to get to know you. Girls send out signals for guys to hopefully initiate a convo of some sort. It takes a lot and i mean A LOT of guts to step up to a girl and talk to them. If you are really curious (which i believe you are) then go for it. Trust me, its the best feeling in the world once youve taken that step. Regaurdless of her actually liking you or not, you wont have that feeling in the future when she gives up giving you signals, you will start thinking "what did i do wrong? how come she doesnt look at me anymore? did i get ugly?"

Without action you are safe from fears of rejection, but with action you take a chance of great things. Talk to her as a friend, start up a conversation. Just say "hi, I have seen you here these last few weeks, are you new to the area? what school do you go to? Just tallk to her like that and I know she will talk to you. You have to do this if you want to get the girl. When you are a guy you have to risk being rejected if not you will get no where. Good Luck!

Das ist die Geschichte eines M?dels das den Weg des Senft?pfchens  gew?hlt hat.<br>  <br>  Als  Andi.. In unseren Ort kam ..War sie ein nettes  hübsches M?del. Etwas scheu .. Leicht zurückhaltend oder   wirklich eine super  Freundin.<br>  Ein paar Jahre sp?ter  fing Andi an  sich für M?nner zu interessieren. Allerdings  ging sie die Sache falsch an ..  Da Andi ja nun  recht hübsch war standen die M?nner   auf sie  und  baggerten was das Zeugs hielt.. Andi  ging darauf ein.. Soweit so gut ..Allerdings machte sie den Fehler  das sie  mit  den M?nnern am ersten Abend in die Kiste stieg... zun?chst hat das keiner mitbekommen.. Aber  sie wurde unvorsichtig  und vor allem Stil los. . denn  man entdeckte sie  auf Schützenfesten  hinterm Festzelt ..  An Karneval in den Büschen  und hinter der Fritten Bude.. Es war egal  wo.. Hauptsache sie  konnte nen Kerl abschleppen.. Sie gab  sich   billig .. Und benahm sich einfach  wie  ein Flittchen.. Sogar  die ?lteren  Leute aus dem Ort  sagten  wortw?rtlich .. Die hat doch F.. Mich auf der Stirn stehen.<br>  Andi  machte sich an alles ran was nicht bei 3 aufem Baum war .. Egal welches Alter  Hauptsache er sah  nett aus und war willig.<br>  Irgendwann war Andi schwanger ... Vaterschaft Tests wurden gemacht ..Denn irgendwer musste ja zahlen.. W?hrend der Schwangerschaft "hurte " sie weiter rum.. <br>  Sie brach die Schule ab und kippte damit Ihr Abi..<br>  Nach und nach zogen sich  die Freunde immer mehr zurück.. Ich hatte das Problem   das ich sie immer noch machte .. Und mich mit ihr umgab ..Dadurch f?rbte Ihr Ruf auf mich ab, ohne das ich  ihren Lebensstil fr?nte.<br>  Ich hielt zu Ihr.. Trotzdem!<br>  Andi bekam  einen gesunden Jungen.. Zuckersü?..<br>  Sie zog sich zurück  und  sorgte für Ihren Sohn.. Allerdings lebte sie  von der Stütze  und den Unterhaltszahlungen des Vaters.<br>  Dann lernte sie einen Mann Kennen in den sie sich verliebte...  die beiden haben geheiratet und ich dachte wunderbar ..  Endlich  findet sie ihren Weg..<br>  Kurz darauf  erfuhr ich warum die beiden geheiratet haben.. Sie war schwanger!<br>  Also, Kind Nr.2 von Vater Nr. 2.. Soweit so gut ..Das Familienbild stand ja ..<br>  Nach  eineinhalb Jahren  kam der übliche  Satz von Andi.. Ich kann nicht mit ihm leben.. Es ekelt mich wenn ich ihn Küsse und  er verlangt soviel von mir (  Haushalt und Kinder versorgen !!!!)<br>   Es folgte die Trennung.. Andi war wieder frei.. Und  M?nner wieder Freiwild.. Sie schlief sich wieder durch .. naja Betten und Büsche und  was weis ich noch alles..<br>  Und im letzten Jahr  brachte sie Kind Nr. 3 von Vater Nr. 3 zur Welt... nach wie vor keine Ausbildung, kein Job...nichts..<br>  Von Vater Nr. 3 keine Spur mehr.. Der war ja auch nicht gut genug..<br>  Lange rede kurzer Sinn... Andi   lebt heute zurückgezogen   mit Ihren Kindern  und wird gemieden.. Ihre Eltern werden mitleidig betrachtet und  die Kinder mit Argusaugen überwacht...<br>  Sie ist eine S.c.h.l.a.m.p.e.. wie sie im Buche steht..<br>  Wenn das der Lohn ist  für  ein Leben in dem ich  Sex frei auslebe.. ann  gelte ich lieber als prüde und verklemmt habe aber weiterhin meine Freunde und  meinen guten Ruf.. und lebe ein Leben mit einem Mann mit dem ich glücklich bin und ein erfülltes Sexleben habe.|`|NBxGecxXaa	Ja, was ist denn ein Flittchen oder eine Schl.?

In den 50ger Jahren h?tte man Dich in den konservativen Kreisen vielleicht schon wegen Deiner Frage so eingestuft. <br>  Im Südoldenburgischen habe ich in den 80gern noch Leute kennengelernt, die so dachten, wie Du schreibst: "S., weil sie macht, was sie will"<br>  <br>  Meine ganz pers?nliche Meinung: Nicht die Menge der M?nner, sondern die Ehrlichkeit zu (in dem Fall) den M?nnern macht es aus. Eine Frau, die M?nner auf fiese Art und Weise ausnutzt und sich nicht um die Menschen um sie herum kümmert, hat vielleicht diesen Titel verdient. Erschwerend, wenn sie auch nicht in Gewissensnot kommt, wenn auch ihre Freundinnen darunter leiden müssen.<br>  <br>  Ich habe aber in 40 Jahren noch nie für jemanden diese Worte übriggehabt.

AA11717279	jst tell her that u see her in ur dreams
0235641a3fee892ed4f4e06575ff1cacaa	Forget about THEM.  They have decided on their own life to be that way.  JUST LET IT GO..,..  Look for what makes you happy and don't try to control what others are doing.....  You will not be able to change how she or he thinks.  Just live your life, make yourself a good career so you can move out and be on your own, doing what you like to do.  Look at your Mom as an example of a person that has HUGE REGRETS of her decisions and didn't pursue what SHE WANTED.  Don't fall into that same pattern:  Her experiences should be your driving force to not do the same as she did...  Being SELFISH with what you want to do with your life is actually a GOOD THING...  Plan your life, just don't let it happen around you...  Take care and be blessed!|`|E5rjGBL3aa	Your Dad has seen the world; your Mom has not. It can be hard for someone to stay in the same place forever, and I think that's why she's always traveling.<br>  <br>  If you all can't move, I recommend that your Mom get a job or open her own New Age store. I think she would have plenty to focus on there.|`|AA10426443	You Will  Certainly  Have  To  STAY  OUT  of This  One   DEAR    .  Leave IT To  Your Parents.  It Is   Their  Decision.   You Father  Must Have Great Love  For Her. You Seem To  Be  A  Well Mannered   Young Lady....  You  Only Have To Stay  Away From Your Parents   Domestic    Decisions.|`|8hlT20u4aa	Your dad sounds like a very peace full man who chooses to not start conflict.  You your self state that he is happy. <br>  Your mom sounds like she is a free spirit that just doesn't have the ability or wish to settle down, even though apparently she made that choice when she married and had children.<br>    I would thank God everyday that you have such a loving father it sounds like he makes a lot of sacrifices and not just for your mom.<br>    There is nothing you can do to change your mom and if she feels that you and your siblings should raise yourself then she is the one with the problem not dad and he has more of a backbone then you think.<br>  <br>  there is a saying that any one can be a father but it takes a man to be a dad. the same goes for women.<br>   Good luck you sound sensible and I am sure that you Love both your mom and dad, but give dad a break he is not spineless he has more of a spine than most men now a day.|`|NcQfHiwqaa	Geeze. sounds like you have alot on your hands. and seems to me like your mom is all about the wierdness [no offense].But i think that you and your family should have a talk with her. and you should all tell her how you feel about they way she is or how she is living. and ask your dad to say somethings too, because maybe if she heard it from someone her age and with better understandment,she might pay more attention. and try and get her to do some new things, ya never know, she might like them?<br>  =]|`|XlZTnMmNaa	You mom feel like life passed her buy. She hasn't grown up and is trying to grasp for her youth again. Some mothers would try to live through you girls  which would be just as bad.<br>  <br>  You just have to look on her as a spoilt little girl, even at her age. You might be surprised about your dad. He might be much more willing to stand up for himself if it wasn't for you girls (or the ones at home). <br>  <br>  I will tell you one thing... many women that live in rural areas for a long time start feeling cheated. They want to blame it on someone and they blame it on their husband. They start thinking people in big cities are different and have a lot more fun. So they travel more, take up things they think the "city slicker" girls do, which usually included off the wall stuff. They become very street smart, but the day they move into a big city her neighbors look on her as a nut. Not a little country girl, not a woman of the world, but a fake nut that has never found herself.<br>  <br>  You can bet there are women in town that will jump on your dad once your mom leaves. These are the ones that will never say a word or flirt in the least. They admire a man that is responsible.<br>  <br>  When you get older... much older you will understand your mom better. You might still be a little mad at her but understand her better. At a certain age you realize that you ONLY have ONE life and you better live it because you won't get another chance.<br>  <br>  Her thoughts doesn't have anything to do with you girls. She might be selfish but she is thinking even the youngest can make it on her own with just a little help from dad. <br>  <br>  I think some day when you are alone with your dad, since you are the oldest, you need to tell him that you wished he would have more backbone (but in a little nicer way). You will probably find that he has his reasons and you will get closer to him knowing that you are concerned about him. What I am saying, instead of trying to fix your mom, give your dad support.<br>  <br>  Yeah, it's none of your business but he is still going to be glad that he has your support. If you feel like it, you can then share it with your sisters. If he clams up he just doesn't want you involved.<br>  <br>  Good luck... you are not the first to go through this and won't be the last. It's good you guys are older.
kXI7VEp7aa	It isn't crazy to feel that much pain, even though you weren't around each other much, there was still love there, your friend might be acting like its nothing cause they don't really understand, or they want to make it easier on you by saying it shouldn't affect you so bad|`|AA11312858	I am sorry about your sister.  I imagine your friend meant well but it is somewhat silly to tell someone how they should feel.  Feelings aren't a matter of choice, what you do with them is.  I don't think what you are feeling is crazy.  You lost a sister whom you had recently reconciled with.  You lost not only past opportunities because of your estrangement, but you also lost future opportunities to build a relationship.  I' m sorry for your loss.|`|C7z747pWaa	ur friend has no clue what its like to lose a sibling even thou u werent that close u loved her cause she was ur sister so u had a special conection ignore ur friend.  u deal with this lose the way u need to no one can tell u how to.<br>  <br>  im really sorry for ur lose and i hope u can find a way to cope with it.<br>  <br>  <br>  i wish you tons of luck|`|8hlT20u4aa	First sorry for your loss and yes it is a lost one thing I know is Love doesn't have a watch it knows not what time it is so it will not know how long you have loved just that you have loved. Mourn your sister the fact that the two of you Loved each other is reason enough do not listen to those that say you don't have a right. Recently widowed and for 6 years of my 13 year marriage my husband and I where estranged, we reconciled our marriage and a week later he was diagnosed with cancer, he passed on 09/10/2006 I have had people say that I don't have a right to grieve him since we really only had 7 years with each other because of the separation. I loved him so that is my right . Good Luck and Keep loving|`|AA11922691	dude she is Familia and u do have the right to fell sad because she is still ur sister and she said she was sorry ur friend i acting like that because it probaly never happened to him or that he dosent like seing u sad so he is trying to cheer u up but i well tell him that it dosent matter that she wasnt there she didnt have to be but she still is my sister and i loved her and she loved me so u got all the right to fell sad man i hope every thing works out dawg peace|`|LEZAdSZdaa	Its actually probably harder on you than if she was in your life everyday.  It makes you think of all the things you missed out on with your sister.  <br>   As for your friend, some people deal with death differently.  He probably is someone who can't feel emotion for someone he didn't know and thinks that everyone feels the same.  When in fact we deal with death differently.|`|aObFIwqoaa	No it's not crazy AT ALL.  Family is family no matter the time or distance between.  Your friend must lead a very sad, lonely life to feel that way.  You have every right to feel as you do and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  You need to go through the grieving process.  This can help you get through and possibly help you with other relationships in the future.  I wish you much luck getting through it.

Dovresti essere come prima cosa molto, molto eccitata e come seconda cosa molto lubrificata prima di utilizzare l' ingresso secondario (per dirla con parole tue;-).

Il rapporto anale più di quello vaginale è soggetto alla possibilità di microlacerazioni che possono produrre contagio.<br>  L'uso del preservativo è la situazione migliore (è lubrificato) ed impedisce eventuali contagi laddove non siamo abbastanza sicuri di noi stessi o del nostro partner.<br>  www.psicolife.com|`|SGqjtDJfaa	bisogna provare tutto nella vita anche perche ne hai una ,ma sicuramente lui non è pratico di dolcezze.<br>  quando vuoi provare qualcosa di diverso ,domanda prima forse è meglio ,non vado oltre puoi scrivermi su email se vuoi ...........................................|`|f6d8e4ee2c065faff22ef49316680ba6aa	è un semplice problema di lubrificazione...|`|bc0f14007d81a3dd5f124d4e043cb505aa	Molta dolcezza nella penetrazione...

f08cdab9e2c1a31c572dcf3f40cf9bfcaa	There's two ways to look at this. When you are looking for a potential love of your life, because the person doesn't seen to think or feel the slightest bit the same way towards you, someone may think that person is stuck up as if to say that person has no feelings period.<br>  <br>  Now if you are the care-free typical single, it is called shopping. You are comparing the people that appeal to your eye. There is nothing wrong with shopping.Now some couple shop too. My girl sometimes asks me "why me & not this girl or that girl." and I reply "this girl and that girl look nice, but I dont love them. I love you" Then she said "but what if I was never in your life?" I replied, "Dear, I love you. I love where I'm at and I wouldn't change you out for the world."<br>  <br>  There are three terms that Americans have come to use to describe your scenario that you have depicted. 1.Irony, 2.Coincidence, and 3. Evil Kenievil. They are just things in life that happen out of the ordinary that cant really be explained.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped.....at lease little bit.|`|Ic9oWmg8aa	It means you on the verge of a major mental breakdown.<br>  <br>  That always occurs just prior to someone going mental....|`|581ac28374d19a6d286f4a4206135413aa	It usually means you are commitment phobic & are looking for the same subconsciously.|`|f9d3f912f766afaaf8e6d6785e74c40caa	thats called life

You wouldnt be human if you didnt.  What you need to do is set goals for yourself and do your best to achieve them  prove to yourself that you are good enough.  Dont worry about what other people, just stayed focused on your life and you goals and dreams.|`|bfA1bvOXaa	Hey, it's okay! Don't be down on yourself! I don't have tons of money, and yeah, it SUCKS, but you know what? Money isn't everything. If you have a great family, and friends who love you, then that is ALL that matters. Don't ever think that you aren't good enough. I spent way too much time doing that, and then I realized that I'm no worse than anyone else! Try and think positive! Keep your head up!|`|dpXROn3Aaa	yea i no how it feels....but u just gotta move on and try to find some1 to talk about it cu its not good to keep emotions like that inside...i learned that the hard way.|`|1b5d131f50880f560abd163b8dc587e8aa	Sometimes, but dont worry.<br>  Just becaue your poor doesn't mean squat.<br>  Just work hard in school and when your older you'll be rich because of all the studying you did.|`|2LZfPdAhaa	i think everyone feels like they're not good enough at some point in their life. even people who have everything in the world. being poor doesn't mean you can't be happy. you still have your friends, family. you have their trust, friendship, honesty, etc. <br>  <br>  when you start feeling like this, remember all the good things you have in life.|`|L90DwJ3haa	My Family isn't rich eithe.

ccqIYm0eaa	it's hard to tell from your story, but either this guy is, (a) a normal guy who is ignorant of social etiquette, or, (b) a jerk.  sorry to say that about your friend, but he should know better than to treat women (friends or not) that way.  no matter what's going on with him, you should tell him that it makes you uncomfortable/angry, and that he should stop.  if he doesn't, he obviously doesn't respect you as a friend, so ditch him.|`|2e50ba237baff908f07695101ef0bbf4aa	I know what TYPE of guy you are talking about.

The best thing to do is to just let him know the ground rules, and the next time he slaps you on the butt, cuff him (Not like that!  Meaning to hit him)

Wanna hangout sometimes"<br>  <br>  It bothers me because I am usually getting over them by the time they call. But I still talk. Give that a try.

If you or he still have open wounds from the break up, you probably won't be able to be friends again yet.|`|OFUiTFpnaa	i really am not sure, but be like i miss u a lot, wanna meet up sometimes..and then when u do lay it on him, so it's face to face.|`|Xd3L4MHZaa	ok..so tell him exactly what you feel tell him you miss him as  FRIEND and nothing more that you want things to be like before you went out.. and tell him that if he feels awkward then you totally understand...|`|vZj1LH16aa	Maybe you should just think of why you guys broke up at first = )<br>  Remember, things happen for a reason.

bMbFHg6raa	Hola Amiga, cuanto tiempo sin verte por aqui, lo mejor es que por alla si nos vemos. ja<br>  <br>  respondiendo a tu pregunta, mira, siempre los valores del alma son los que prevaleces, sabes, la belleza fisica a veces es un preponderante, pero, no debiera ser asi, ya que esta puede terminar por cualquier causa,  y los sentimientos y bondad del corazon, nunca se acaban.<br>  la edad, un accidente,  una marca, cicatriz o  cualquier afeccion fisica acaban con el cuerpo y sus atriburos, pero cuando amas y alguien te ama, se inhiben esos factors, por eso surgela frase de que el amor es ciego y si porque lo que otros ven cono espantoso uno lo ve muy hermoso, pero ves el interior, no el caparazon. <br>  y esto  es en todos los aspectos, cuando seleccionas un amigo o amiga,,  y cuando ves en alguien hermoso sentimietnos negativos y su mirada de odio o rencor, por ese mismo sentimiento que refleja uno no esta dispuesto a aceptarlo a menos que perdamos la razon y el corazon por otro tipo de intereses.<br>  En mi caso amiga, la experiencia me dice que una persona puede ser linda por fuera en la medida que refleje lo que interiormente lleva.<br>  Te mando un enorme abrazo.|`|LAwXMF8jaa	su forma de tratarme y su forma de ser|`|e5a4c0ada4109658a048f2eab6aa4096aa	La verdad yo nunca he creido es eso de <br>  <br>  "se tu mismo"<br>  <br>  yo pienso que el coqueteo..algunas miradas, risas fingidas, pero todo con medida, sin exagerar o saldra todo peor.<br>  <br>  suerte?|`|ortFHdlgaa	es su interior lo que otros no pueden ver|`|ouWy2J5Oaa	Su forma de SER,<br>  <br>  su forma de PENSAR,<br>  <br>  su MENTALIDAD,<br>  <br>  su ACTITUD, <br>  <br>  su forma de AMAR[ME].|`|6c39e35f071b69d01d6c40d496e9cac9aa	Holas. Cómo estás? A ver, las cosas que pueden ser las que me enamore de él son, en primer lugar la humildad, y en segundo lugar el buen sentido del humor. Con esto no quiero decir que no me fije en el físico, si lo dijera mentiría, todos nos fijamos aunque sea un poco en ello, pero lo que para mí más reluce y en lo que más me fijo es en el interior de la persona; como dijo nuestra amiga, puede ser muy lindo por fuera, pero sin interiormente no tiene buenos sentimientos, mmm...<br>  Besos :-)|`|Iqtz2ZcQaa	su personalidad ,su carácter ,su dulzura sus ojos ,su boca ,su vos ,su mirada , como me trata , su manera de ser|`|NQmKu7HNaa	Como mujer, te puedo decir que lo que más me atrae de un hombre es su buen humor, su trato, su cortesía.

33fe55ae4fcd11e6f4df52fe14035283aa	It sounds to me like your sister has a bad case of low self esteem. It isn't natural to want a relationship with someone who treats you badly unless you feel badly about yourself to the point that you can't believe you deserve better.<br>  I think you should stand by your sister. Give her that shoulder each and every time she needs it but don't hide what you feel about her situation.Be a SISTER ..... one of the best relationships you could have in your whole life. It's never fun to watch someone you care about being hurt but you have to understand that there is something else behind what she's doing. This is the issue you need to address and help her work through.Seize those sister moments when you can show her how much you really care .... she may not know it but she needs you. Help her to look inside herself and understand why she keeps going back to a bad situation.<br>  You can't control her choices or actions but if you are patient you can help her find something better and become a better person .... over time .... by your strength and understanding.<br>  Good luck : )|`|gDTNrBitaa	your sister has to learn the hard way for herself  and yes, you and your family should be there for her when she needs you.<br>  maybe if all the family played reverse physcology y with her and just tolerant this guy she may see the light on her own and get rid of himself herself.when your family are so against him it makes her want him even more because what we can not have is always more interesting to us. let her be and just tolerate this guy and hopefully she will leave on her own.|`|2e50ba237baff908f07695101ef0bbf4aa	I think you should send in someone to talk to her boyfriend, (Like your father, make sure he brings that rifle)  and tells him not to hurt her again.  But if that doesn't work then tell your sister that she can do better, that whole "fool me once shame on me, fool me twice shame on you thing".|`|XIaiivG6aa	Sounds like she needs to be taken "out back behind the woodshed", if you know what I mean.  Seems like the only way she'll get her head on straight is if you tell her exactly how it is.  Don't give her a shouder to cry on again, because she continues ot make the same stupid mistake.  Tell her how utterly moronic she is being, and howdestructive this cancerous relationship is to both her, and her family.  Tell her that if she gets hurt this time she is on her own, because she has been warned, and she will have no one to blame but herself.<br>  You'll probably have to get loud and yell.<br>  If this were two guys someone would end up getting their *** kicked.

Puede suceder que uno de la pareja ya no sienta nada y la otra persona toda vía siente algún sentimiento por su ex- pareja. claro, Para esa persona se le va ser duro  no pensar en su  Ex- pareja.

Bueno este es mi punto de vista dicen que todo depende del cristal con que se mira. BESITOS

Creo ke si tu le importas a la otra persona nunk te dira adios sin antes haberlo intentado.

c09745e19554dfb4ed4ee433c3d33adbaa	The best way to resolve communication problems is to Talk to him. Our insecurities often cause us to make huge deals out of nothing. What can you lose by talking to him? If he really thinks you are not very smart then you don't need him as a friend. Always remember that there are plenty people to put you down and to try to make themselves look better at the expense of others. Stay away from these people, surround yourself with people who believe in you who will help you become all that you can be. people who care about you enough to tell you when you are wrong but be there to help you get back on track Make goals , dream dreams, Believe in yourself, and put GOD in control, you can't lose.|`|8325ce3630f7a772fe33c1c3e4b5ef6baa	um ok|`|068e751f502c3581190dae3af3a4115baa	be like tever it was just a joke it's ok i'm sooooo sorry can we just be friends????|`|338faa7f6ec301ea799e561fcfac0bf0aa	well i dont think that was a good idea anyways... but apologize to him ALOT and if he doesnt forgive you then thats his problem..|`|43945f6085814c4d80f487cd43072b3eaa	well, if ur just gonna fool around with people's feelings, then maybe u should jsut stay away from him, until he recovers|`|E3N11Ohmaa	Tell him that your sorry and that you didn't know it would affect him so badly to the point where he would be so angry and stop talking to you|`|AA12334947	i think you should just tell him it was a joke and he doesn't believe you then sry but he doesn't trust you. and just say if i lreally liked you wouldn't I have asked you out not her!!<br>  <br>  ~*Mashalia*~|`|Ay6O71iZaa	Your friend shouldn't have done that unless you told her so, so maybe she should be fixing everything up rather than yourself. If she doesn't, you're going to have to talk to him about it and tell him she was just joking. Also, it's not a good thing when he thinks you're stupid for any reason, so maybe you should forget about him. Its hard but thats what you may have to do.
KsS90aczaa	Tooth brushes..haha...kidding...Ok...how about something cute that the kids who come in and get there teeth cleaned etc...will like too...conversation piece...like a tooth with a face w/ glasses and bendy arms.. I have a hairdresser one from when I was in cosmo. school b4 college...it's cute. It's a smiley face, with a hair do, hair brush and scissors.  No sure where to get it. But just a quick thought, or a cute picture frame that has the dentistry theme. What else...hmmm mind u it's almost 430 am here...even a really nice degree/diplmona holder...something engraved..."things to remember" in most malls does that, I think they have an online thing too. That might be nice too! :) THey can hang it on there wall. I would also do like a gag gift, but this is just me...like those wind up teeth that chatter or those big red wax lips. :) good luck|`|d3e3abbb5f9f24ba4b09ae793371aa06aa	A car or money!
b673c1358fcc4505d0718b7735679a71aa	Parole sante “sabbry”, parole sante. Purtroppo (o per fortuna) i punti di vista su di un’identica situazione sono almeno due e, quasi mai, fra loro coincidenti.<br>  Potremmo star qui a snocciolare luoghi comuni a profusione per disaminare la situazione, ma non avrebbe grande costrutto la cosa, perciò, sulla base di una lunga esperienza personale, mi permetto solo di dirti questo: ognuno di noi ha dentro di sé una sua scala di valori ed ognuno di noi a quella scala di valori lega gran parte della propria esistenza, che attorno ad essi finisce per ruotare. Credo che il rispetto reciproco, anche delle reciproche “futilità”, sia fondamentale, ma ben più lo è non creare barriere fra le persone. Il primo passo per ottenere un risultato negativo (purtroppo) è farne una questione di principio, per esperienza ti dico che il principio (fine a sé stesso) non porta in un rapporto affettivo a nulla di buono, bisogna (o meglio bisognerebbe) trovare il modo per farsi comprendere (fosse facile, anche perché si ha sempre la velata speranza che l’altra – o l’altro nel tuo caso – capisca da sola, quasi lo si pretende questo). Perciò, concludendo, non hai torto, ma non far si che un “principio” possa minare qualcosa di più grande di un principio. Piccolo consiglio di quella santa donna di mia nonna (che ora non c’è più): non andate mai a letto con vostra moglie (nel tuo caso marito) senza prima aver fatto pace, non datele (nel tuo caso dategli) mai le spalle ed augurate sempre la buona notte; qui ti aggiungo un consiglio che mia nonna per pudica com’era non mi avrebbe mai dato, ma se tutto finisse con una bella unione corporale, forse il problema assumerebbe contorni meno esasperati… almeno spero. In bocca al lupo.|`|Qh3DA27paa	Secondo me non hai completamente torto, anzi hai pienamente ragione. Forse essendo tu così disponibile in tutto quello che ti chiede, lui non si rende più conto che tu fai dei sacrifici per andargli in contro e quindi ormai da per scontato che tu lo segua qualunque cosa voglia fare. Non ci si dovrebbe mai dare così per scontati...magari cerca di dirgli le stesse cose che hai scritto a noi, può darsi  che si renda conto dell'errore e magari dalle prossime volte (se per questa ormai è tardi) non metterà le sue esigenze davanti a quelle di tutti e terrà le tue più in considerazione|`|b536c8e14ed51cfe62ac9ab8ee215f46aa	Hai perfettamente ragione.<br>  <br>  Non c'è altro da aggiungere.|`|po5rZYaHaa	Hai assolutamente ragione e fai valere i tuoi diritti tu non puoi stare alla sua volubilita'.

Mi spiego... se solitamente avete hobby e interessi differenti e questo impegno può in qualche modo avvicinare i vostri gusti, credo sarebbe simpatico (non mi viene un altro termine!!) andare con lui...<br>  Se invece è solo una cosa che interessa a lui e al contrario lui per te non ha mai rinunciato ad un suo impegno per accontentarti, beh, allora spiegaglielo e gli dici che non ti sembra giusto essere sempre tu quella che rinuncia...|`|lxnaneffaa	tu non devi rinunciarci, punto! non ci sono altri discorsi da fare, non c'è altro da dire! nemmeno io sopporto queste cose. lui ha mille cose, bene, tu ne hai una, portala avanti e passagli sopra. il principio è principio e sono pienamente daccordo con te!

La cirugía reparadora se practica  para eliminar cicatrices después de un accidente de tránsito o por quemaduras. La cirugía plástica correctiva se practica a las personas que desean cambiar la forma de la nariz, eliminar papadas, arrugas, grasa del abdomen (liposucción) aunque también se someten a ella para aumentar el volumen de los senos, glúteos (verse más curvilíneas). En cualquiera de estos casos, la persona mejora su autoestima porque se siente mejor, se ve mejor, y la gente comienza a fijarse en ella. Esto le da seguridad, aplomo. Incluso cambia su forma de vestir, se interesa más en su persona y  su vida social es más intensa.|`|Q2KPsWMjaa	Pues claro, a todo aquel que dependa de su fisico para sentirse seguro de si mismo...o de quien es y lo que puede ofrecer como ser humano.|`|QcgEISMhaa	Para mucha gente eso les funciona, pero esas son personas superficiales, una cirugía plástica no me va a hacer sentir mejor persona, superior a alguien, no una cirugía plástica lo único que hace es que una persona se mire mejor a que antes....<br>  §aludos!!!|`|UR5ur1Jbaa	si ya que depende donde te operes alomejor el cerebro jijiji o los dos ojos|`|16663508a7b09646989b241fdfe9c9c4aa	Puede aumentar los senos pero el autoestima solo puedes aumentarlo tu.|`|7nLv9Fnzaa	Sí, algunas personas que han tenido complejos por alguna parte de su cuerpo...nariz, senos, cicatrices y cualquier otra cantidad... despues de una cirugía plástica han logrado superar esos temores y tener nuevamente confianza en sí mismos.<br>  <br>  Abrazos!|`|JmOqxHteaa	si realmente lo quieres si;

aHAN2lnLaa	Hola amigo:<br>  <br>  Controla tus impulsos. Aun no es tu novia y solo piensas en tenerla.<br>  <br>  En vez de atraerla, la alejas cada vez mas de tu lado. Lo que ella seguramente siente por ti, es temor. Por eso se te hace tan dificil la conquista. Quizas es muy timida y te ve como alguien que puede hacerle da?o. En lo que aprendes a controlarte, invitala a lugares concurridos como a actividades deportivas, a la playa.<br>  <br>  Ademas de que estos lugares distraer tu mente, no estaras solo con ella. Pero recuerda, que tus impulsos los tienes que controlar tu mismo. Si crees que no puedes, busca ayuda de un psicologo para que te ayude.<br>  <br>  Te deseo mucha suerte.Saludos.|`|JcbLA3vfaa	NO PUES ENTONCES LO QUE TIENES QUE HACER ES NO PENSAR EN ELLA CUANDO LA VEAS, NO PUES LA VERDAD NO SE QUE DECIRTE PIENSA EN ALGO QUE TE GUSTE OBVIAMENTE APARTE DE ESO Y EN QUE LA DEBES DE RESPETAR HASTA EN TUS PENSAMIENTOS.|`|N3iOlfs9aa	Concentrate en la seleccion de fut, veras si no se te apaga el animo.|`|ce976541d60c1e40ed83673e6ec87370aa	MASTURBARTE antes de salir a buscar mujeres|`|e31ed9131bcd2bef3b26a3a20a539998aa	facilito,<br>  #1 piensa en tu suegra <br>  #2 se va a poner igual<br>  #suerte<br>  cuando la cabeza de abajo despierta<br>  la de arriba no reacciona|`|mGSLxG2Eaa	Mirala a los ojos...no al trasero ni a sus pechos...y pon atencion a lo que te esta diciendo.|`|QAnGjjcIaa	hablalo con ella ...explicale lo que te pasa... que entienda que son solo impulsos y que realmente tu intención es tenerla en el matrimonio... la comunicación es indispensable en una pareja y si no se lo explicas sabiendo que ella lo percibe vas a perderla ... ella tiene que saber que al ser hombre tienes todos esos impulsos por naturaleza y por ende debe comprenderte ..suerte que tengas lindo día!!!

1d45f7bd684e0fdd09e1ab24073386bbaa	Da die meisten M?nner etwas sp?ter als die Frauen erwachsen werden, kann es für eine Frau ziemlich nervig sein, mit einem gleichaltrigen Partner verheiratet zu sein. Von daher ist es vielleicht für manchen sinnvoll, sich eine Frau mit einer vergleichbaren Reife zu suchen...<br>  <br>  Auf der anderen Seite vermissen manche M?dchen ihren Papa und suchen sich deshalb eine Vaterfigur. Denen ist also mit dieser Konstellation ebenfalls geholfen.<br>  <br>  Ich kenne eine junge Frau, die einen um 16 Jahre ?lteren Mann geheiratet hat. Ich war erst überrascht. Aber dann wurde mir klar, dass sie bei einem Gleichaltrigen das Gefühl gehabt h?tte, dass sie ein zus?tzliches Kind zu versorgen hat. <br>  <br>  Sie hatte ziemlich schwierige Lebenssituationen durchlebt, so dass sie einfach viel mehr und viel intensiver über das Leben nachgedacht hatte, als die meisten in ihrem Alter. Wie h?tte sie sich dann mit einem gleichaltrigen Partner überhaupt unterhalten sollen? Der h?tte ja nur schief gegrinst bei ihren vielen Fragen. Anscheinend war ihre Wahl richtig, soweit ich als Au?enstehende beurteilen kann.<br>  <br>  Umgekehrt kannte ich auch ein Ehepaar, bei dem die Frau um 16 Jahre ?lter war. Sie war ein rechter Quirl und zutiefst beleidigt, als ihr Mann vor ihr starb. Entrüstet meinte sie, dass sie doch vereinbart h?tten, dass sie zuerst sterben würde. Ihre Ehe soll sehr harmonisch gewesen sein. Ich denke, dass dies vor allem an dem besonderen Charakter dieses Mannes lag, der in allem so ausgeglichen und freundlich war. <br>  <br>  Selbst im Alter machten ihn Kinder nicht nerv?s. Beispielsweise gab er einer ganzen Horde von Enkeln gro?zügig die M?glichkeit, in seinem Garten umzugraben und Gruben anzulegen. <br>  <br>  Seine Frau wurde meines Wissens über 90 Jahre alt. Aber sehr lange hat sie es ohne ihn offensichtlich doch nicht ausgehalten...|`|45962378e8dde4a1baa557a993a6cd34aa	Für  den  Mann  kann es  ja  toll sein  aber  für  die  Frau  wird  sp?testens  in ein paar  Jahren ?tzend.|`|83314590512ab3e4d65eadff7091a3c9aa	weiss aus eigener erfahrung..eine junge frau an seiner seite tut gut.erfrischend und man bleibt laenger innerlich jung.das ist wie ein jungbrunnen. aber nur dann wenn der mann eine innere jugend hat.|`|MZlo1gUqaa	Der Altersunterschied ist relativ.<br>  Wichtig ist die Liebe aufrecht zu erhalten!|`|2c65cac9bb685069549bf94b50df10a3aa	wenn er wirklich 69 Jahre ist dann hat ihn seine junge Frau doch verdammt jung gehalten. <br>  Ja es ist wirklich so.

UOyD9S2aaa	Nn penso possa esserci risposta alla tua domanda!! Secondo, te come può uno/a garantirti che ti amerà anche domani. A volte vivere l'attimo deve bastare, soprattutto per goderselo a pieno. L'amore non si programma ne si pianifica e te lo dice una persona razionale. Ma cosa penseresti se una/o ti rispondesse ti amo solo per 2 mesi poi basta??? Tutto può finire, ma anche no. Viviamo liberi da tanti complessi, paure e fobie che sembrano pregiudicare gran parte dei rapporti. Nel 2007 siamo arrivati all'agognata libertà sessuale, ma ancora siamo profondamente indietro su quella dei sentimenti.

Sappiamo però che non è così, nel corso della vita viviamo situazioni che stravolgono la vita, l'unico consiglio che posso dare è quello di vivere intensamente quel rapporto affinchè quel domani, se avverrà il cambiamento, potrai sempre sorridere al pensiero di essere vissuto felicemente con qualcuno.

r1Ozg6FEaa	Aufbrausend ist mir 1000 mal lieber als nachtragend! Ich habe schon lange aufgeh?rt "tagelang kleine Br?tchen zu backen" (den Ausdruck habe ich noch nie geh?rt, finde ihn aber sehr passen!), wenn ich einen Fehler gemacht habe. Wenn der andere nachtragend ist, ist es sein Problem, nicht meines! Ich mach einfach so weiter, als w?re nichts geschehen (ist ein Tipp meiner Schwiegermutter!) und komme damit ganz gut an. Wenn der beleidigte Mitmensch sieht, dass er Dir umsonst etwas nachtr?gt, wird er es bald aufgeben!|`|894ae9d19bb35df583c5e3e2cdc81896aa	kommt darauf an, wie sehr man mich ?rgert!<br>  aber normalerweise bin ich ein paar minuten echt wütend und das ist die sache gegessen!!!|`|DDIXiHAyaa	Ich bin kein nachtragender Mensch ich versuche eher zu schlichten im Bekannten Kreis,wenn sich die Fronten verh?rtet haben.|`|Xeafsdqqaa	Ich bin nicht nachtragend.<br>  Mit deinem "aufbrausend" brauchst du dich aber nicht in die Ecke zu stellen, das ist wenigstens Teil deines Gemüts.<br>  Nachtragen hingegen ist keine Wesensart des Nachtragenden, sondern eine ganz fiese Form des Machtausübens, ein Werkzeug. Ist dem Nachtragenden aber oft selbst nicht bewusst. Von daher ist Vorsicht mit Vorwürfen geboten.|`|d251b7312435d28b499e5fb77805e713aa	Ich bin nur dann nachtragend, wenn sich derjenige, der mir Unrecht angetan hat oder mich beleidigt hat, sich nicht bei mir entschuldigt. Dann kann ich zum wilden Tier werden und die Sache immer wieder ansprechen. Wenn derjenige sich bei mir aber entschuldigt hat, ist für mich alles vergessen.|`|dyEe4vYuaa	ja ich bin es leider. das ?u?ert sich dann jedes mal so, dass ich total zu mache und mich dem mensch total entziehe und keinen kontakt mehr haben will. ich igel mich richtig ein, obwohl ich gesellschaft eigentlich sehr mag.|`|h4kmXOVUaa	Es gibt nichts schlimmeres, als wenn man einen Fehler immer wieder auf′s Butterbrot geschmiert bekommt.

Ein bisschen Small-Talk, bisschen Sch?kern. Wenn es dann allerdings schon in die Richtung mit Verabredung geht oder k?rperliche Ann?herung, dann sollte man dem ganzen einen Riegel vorschieben. <br>  Das ist jedenfalls meine Meinung. Ich wurde in der Vergangenheit 2mal betrogen von Ex-Freunden und das war kein sonderlich sch?nes Gefühl.

Ich finde es schmerzlich, wie locker mit Vertrauen und Partnerschaft umgegangen wird. Bei einer Dritten Person wird sich kr?ftig ins Zeug gelegt und sogar bei YC nachgefragt wie weit man gehen darf. Und beim eigenen Partner? Da wird h?chstwahrscheinlich geschlampt und er ist die Mühe und den Reiz und das Prickeln und die Hitze nicht mehr Wert. Was ist das für ein liebloser Umgang miteinander. Strenge Dich in der eigenen Partnerschaft an, sei kreativ und setze um.

Wie weit und ob überhaupt "ausw?rts" geflirtet werden darf. Wenn darüber in der Partnerschaft noch gar nicht gesprochen wurde und es kommt dazu, das einer der Partner nun doch ausw?rts flirtet, ist das ein kleines gro?es Alarmsignal, das irgendwas in der Partnerschaft  nicht stimmt. Sp?testens dann sollte mit dem Partner erst einmal darüber gesprochen werden. Werden dann Grenzen gesetzt bzgl. eines ausw?rtigen Flirts, dann dürfen die nicht überschritten werden. Also ein Flirt au?erhalb der Partnerschaft kann immer so weit gehen, wie beide Partner damit einverstanden sind.|`|1h7vU8kGaa	Im übertragenen Sinn gilt wohl : Appetit holen darf man sich überall, aber gegessen wird zu Hause.|`|2d77ec467a85b8540913e71fa0a1db25aa	Warum flirtest du mit anderen wenn du in festen H?nden bist, tut mir leid das verstehe ich nicht!

Denn das ist sowieso der sch?nste und begehrenswerteste auf der Welt. Wieso also fremdflirten? Ergibt keinen Sinn, weil man sich unter Wert verkauft. Ich g?be mich nie mit dem Zweitbesten zufrieden, weil meiner ja der Beste ist - demzufolge bringt mir ein "Fremdflirt" absolut gar nichts, au?er das Misstrauen meines Partners, was ich aber unter keinen Umst?nden will.|`|MJL5cA2Yaa	Ich bin der Meinung: Mit Worten und Gesten darf man fast alles. Wenn es dann an die berührung der K?rper geht, dann denke ich, gibt es nicht viel Spielraum. Aus Spielerei wird sehr schnell Ernst. Und m?chte man seinem Partner das wirklich antun? Wenn ja, dann hat die Beziehung eh schon verloren.|`|PK4sHQf4aa	Appetit holen darf man sich - Gegessen wird zu Hause !!!!!<br>  Der Flirt h?rt VOR dem Küssen auf.....<br>  Ansonsten muss jeder für sich selber entscheiden, wie weit er/sie geht...!!|`|TE5ZvO1daa	Wie weit man beim flirten gehen kann überlasse ich der Frau.Auch wenn sie verheiratet ist und er auch und dann zusammen in die Kiste springen naja wenn es beide wollen warum nicht.<br>  Ja gebt mir Daumen runter wenn ihr an dieser Stelle werd und kurz vorm Bett da m?chte ich jemanden h?ren der nein sagt.<br>  Und wer nein sagt lügt.|`|TdlaEZtfaa	erst gar nicht anfangen, denn sonst ist die versuchung zu gross und man geht eventuell einen schritt den man sp?ter bereut.|`|WYtdKFLsaa	also unser standpunkt ist ganz klar definiert :<br>  apetitt holen ist erlaubt gegessen wird zu hause...auch in einer festen beziehung geh?rt flirten einfach dazu ....|`|db27ca17c5f33fb6165560e862c4933daa	Ich flirte auch, aber nur mit den Augen.

90199514157a494646788b24cf5b661baa	I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years and we have been through our ups and downs and I know how you feel.<br>  <br>  The last two years of our relationship have been long distance due to college. Around last April I was feeling like he just wasn't interested in me anymore and that even if he was, he was taking me for granted and making me feel very underappreciated for everything I would do for him. After talking it over with one of my good friends, I confronted him and told him exactly how I felt. Granted I cried alot during this (I am a natural crier) and he was very stubborn about the issue in the beginning. We ended up mutually agreeing to end the relationship, but the next day he said he completely regretted it. We ended up taking it slow for a while and we are now back together. Since then (it's been a year) things have been great between us. A lot of times it is a lack of communication and that can create barriers. However, when you communicate, there is a way to do it. I have read this alot and it seems to help avoid any nasty fights and helps you understand the other person. Don't directly implicate him ("Why have you been acting...."). Instead try to begin with how you feel when he does or has been acting a certain way ("It doesn't make me feel good when you do...."). If you let him know how you feel about things, he will understand where you are coming from more so than directly implicating him.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps and really just talk to him. Best of luck to you.|`|H9TmRWIgaa	hmmm....  I don't know.  If he didn't support you through your 'emotional stuff', then he doesn't sound like a very good bf.  Maybe you sould just try 'taking a break' and see how it goes - depending on how seriously the relationship is, obviously.  Good luck!|`|097e844c4aeecfe4f4c0e9f6cf039ea4aa	it sounds like you're probably feeling extremely insecure right now. Don't tell him this if you've already told him before. He'll think your a nutcase. <br>  <br>  However, if you havent mentioned anything like that to him, then tell him you're feeling slightly insecure with your relationship and that you  need a little reassurance that he's going to be around. Don't make it sound accusing and try gently pointing out what he should do to make you feel better. Men work better with directions.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about though, the best way to get over a rough patch like this is forget about it. If you start acting more confident in your relationship and as if nothing is wrong, then he will pick up the hint and do the same.
0HP25dkRaa	Sit down and have a heart to heart talk with your dad in an adult way . Do not argue with him about his answers to your questions . He always will look out for your best interest . but everyone has to make some mistakes in life so that they learn from them . He may see something in your boyfriend that reminds him of himself at that age . Just remind him that what he sees was good enough for your mother, so whats wrong with you looking for someone just like him . Let him know that he can trust you to come to him if the boy does go too far . good luck . :)|`|vZj1LH16aa	Try to find out why your dad doesnt like your boyfriend...<br>  If the problem can solve between them two, everything will go smooth. If the problem cannot be solve, you gonna have to secretly be with your boyfriend. <br>  Your dad is your dad, he the one raise you when you're little. Normally they have much more experience than you do. Its always a good idea to listen to your parents. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA10919696	depends on what age are u? yeah parents are more concerned about their children and they dont want them to commit mistakes at a early age.|`|s7roefUfaa	DO NOT, i repeat DO NOT break up with your boyfriend. You've come to the point in your teenage years, which everyone has one, were you have the dating argument with the parents. Tell you dad that if he doesn't repsect your boyfriend that he might as well not respect you either, and walk out on him. Try sleeping over at a friends house for a few nights. Your dad will get the picture.

E questi momenti vorresti non finissero mai, vorresti passare il tempo a guardarla, accarezzarla, parlare insieme a lei, sentirla vicina..

You know what you want and you know what you deserve and no one else can change your mind. If he hasnt changed by now most likely he never will!!! and for him to just break it off with you like that for no reason specailly after you guys just went on vacation i dont think he deserves you, i think you need to think about your future and what you want because i dont think its him!!!|`|3878f5bdb9ae2fd59f2b2fd9a7c1fe55aa	You can get tired of trying to make things work.

You were intimate, that means something. If he doesn't understand that, then he's definitely not worth crying over. Even if you only want to consider him as a bootie call, he's not worthy. <br>  <br>  <br>  If he calls again, be honest with yourself. As your talking, ask, "Do I actually like this guy?

Insomma, se in 7 mesi vi vedete tutti i santissimi giorni, è quasi matematico che in quel periodo si esauriscono quasi tutti i momenti piacevoli nel giro di breve tempo! Ognuno ha bisogno delle sue cose...guardare la tv, giocare al pc, leggere un libro...<br>  Non pensare che non ti ami, non è così... ridimensionatevi e vedrai che tutto andrà benissimo!|`|KODd4bPjaa	questo non vuol dire che non ti ama, anzi, vuole solo lasciarti degli spazi per sfogarti e uscire con le amiche ed è una bella cosa e poi il vedersdi poco, aumenta il desiderio reciproco..non devi avere paura di queste parole è un modo per dirti che non vuole bruciare le tappe e rovinare tutto..tranquilla!!|`|OgloUg0Daa	non è detto che non ti ami più come prima, ma ognuno ha diritto ad avere le proprie libertà.questo non significa che non vi dovete vedere per tutta la settimana, ma almeno una giornata da soli fa bene.e poi se tu hai detto la cosa prima che lui la mettesse in pratica, magari vuole solo accontentarti.secondo me dovreste parlarne insieme e trovare un punto di accordo|`|TgCur2Jsaa	Il fatto che lui ti abbia chiesto un po di "spazio" non penso significhi che si è stancato di te ... Io penso che due persone che stanno insieme debbano cmq mantenere e coltivare i propri interessi ( amici , sport , passioni ... ) ... Magari passando tutti i giorni con te ha trascurato un po quelli che erano aspetti della sua vita che per lui sono importanti ... si tratta solo di trovare il giusto equilibrio ... fai vedere di non essere dispiaciuta per questa proposta e anche tu dedicati a delle cose che sono solo tue e vedi come vanno le cose ...<br>  ciao ciao|`|cIU3Ns6xaa	gli spazi sono necessari, ma io e il mio ragazzo siamo insieme da 2 anni e non rinunciamo mai a vederci tutti i giorni...|`|0DEAgCOnaa	Concordo che bisogna avere i propri spazi... ma a me sembra che il tuo ragazzo stia facendo marcia indietro! Cercare "aria" fa pensare che si stia stufando di te, e che ora stia cercando di capire se ridimensionando un pò la vostra relazione possa o meno funzionare. Non è detto che non ti ami più, certo è che ti ha fatto presente un suo malessere: campanello d'allarme prima di entrare in vera crisi. Al posto tuo rifletterei anche su cosa vuoi tu. Anche tu vuoi più spazi? O ti andava bene vederlo così spesso? Fagli presente cosa ne pensi: anche le tue esigenze contano!!|`|25e5e1930dfe3cf90d4b1dca364b9d1caa	non c'è niente di male anzi , anke io e il mio ragazzo non c vediamo tutti i giorni perchè se no va a finire ke litighiamo spesso per cazzate, nonostante ami una persona dopo ke c stai insieme troppo tempo senti il bisogno di parlare con qulacun'altro. <br>  All'inizio neanke io capivo poi pero ho cominiciato a uscire con le mie amiche piu spesso e mi sono subita sentita più tranquilla, e poi avevamo tutti e due ancora piu voglia di vederci!

Por causas que no nos han sido reveladas este poderoso ángel se rebeló contra la utoridad de Dios, su creador, y motivado por el celo y la envidia en contra de Cristo comenzó a difamarlo con gran éxito, convenciendo  así a que la tercera parte de los ángeles creados se pusieran de su parte...Hubo pues, en el cielo, una gran batalla y Jesús y los ángeles leales expulsaron del cielo a los ángeles rebeldes, vagando por el universo en busca de un lugar donde establecerse, decidieron que la tierra era el lugar ideal para ellos, pues los otros mundos creados no fueron enga?ados por el pecado ...Para tu conocimiento Jonathan, los ángeles son seres creados por Dios pero un poco superior a los hombres ,porque además de ser  inmortales ... son seres espirituales, los ángeles son espíritus y pueden adoptar formas y convertirse en invisibles porque están dotados de condiciones superiores a la de los hombres...Si lo prefieres viven en dimensiones que el hombre no puede traspasar o conocer...Volviendo a la pregunta ?Porqué Satanás no puede estar en varios lugares a la vez? Satanás fue el nombre que Lucifer adquirió después que fue expulsado del cielo y "Satanás" significa adversario, enemigo de Dios...Satanás aun tiene mucho poder mental y físico, pero no puede estar en todos lados a la vez,  por la misma razón que te dí al comienzo, es un ser creado, sólo Dios tiene esta condición de estar en todos lados a vez por que es "Omnipresente"...Entonces Satanás para suplir esta "necesidad" y querer hacer da?o en todo el mundo...para tentar al hombre y que se pierda y no pueda acceder a la vida eterna que Cristo ofrece a la humanidad...despliega a toda la hueste de ángeles malvados  que reclutó en el cielo alrededor del planeta y se comunican unos aotros por medio de la mente y otros enga?os...pues tienen mucho poder...Uno de los más grandes y serios poderes que Satanás y sus ángeles caídos están desarrollando con gran éxito y poder es el "Espiritismo"...sin que la gente lo reconozca o le de la importancia debida...Si deseas saber otras cosas más interesantes aún, escríbeme Jonathan, muy gustoso te responderé....Un abrazo...Chauuuuuuuu....|`|mGSLxG2Eaa	No es omniprescente...<br>  <br>  Nada mas Dios y yo...:D|`|0GuppMXCaa	como sabes jajajajajaja   pero si no pudiera para eso tiene sus ayudantes los otros angelillos malosos jajajaja|`|Iw2VTog4aa	JAY, JAY, JAY....YA ME  REI, <br>  AHORA DAME MIS DIEZ PUNTOS.|`|sRO8GTRoaa	simple por que no es Dios
G7wIRqvyaa	l'amore è una parola grande che riassume tutto ciò che incontriamo nell'arco della nostra vita.Dalla prima cosa che vediamo alla mattina appene alzati all'ultima prima di andare a letto ci viene trasmesso amore,amore per se stessi o per gli altri,amore che riusciamo a trasmettere o che assorbiamo con voracità.L'amore ci circonda,ci insegue,ci avvolge,a volte ci supera dandoci la sensazione di averlo perso ma poco dopo lo ritroviamo;sicuramente non ci lascia mai soli,non ci abbandona.<br>  Personalmente ho sentito una sensazione forte di amore qualche tempo fa quando dalle alte cime himalaiane ho potuto ammirare la nascita del giorno intorno a me mentre giù nella valle cera ancora la notte.|`|07nySsr4aa	Amore e pensare a lui (o lei)24 H su  24H , come non opprimerlo ma farlo sorridere e ridere della vita!

Una mia collega a 39 anni è rimasta incinta dal suo ragazzo, lui non voleva il figlio ma lei sì... si sono lasciati ora è nata una splendida bimba adoratissima dalla mamma.

E forse è meglio non mettersi nell'idea di aspettare l'uomo giusto. Ma meglio vivere alla giornata, altrimenti diventa una ragione di vita che può essere anche ossessiva, ma questo è un altro discorso rispetto alla tua domanda.

Ci amavamo tanto, ma di un amore pulito, fatto di messaggi, telefonate, incontri fugaci fatti di tenerezze e coccole, visto che il marito la trattava di merda. Finché però lei ha deciso di gettarsi tra le braccia (o le gambe) di un altro, in quanto credeva che il mio non fosse amore ma solo affetto, visto che i rapporti sessuali tra noi erano davvero rari. Non hai idea di quanto sia stato male. Non credevo potesse fare tanto male.<br>  Adesso che ha smaltito l'annebbiamento verso questa persona ed ha capito che è stato solo sesso, continua a ripetermi che io sono stato l'unico a trattarla come una persona e non come un oggetto. Che sta male per il male che mi ha fatto, bla bla bla.....e che ora preferisce stare da sola.<br>  Scusate la lungaggine ma con questo voglio dire di NON TRADIRE LA PERSONA CHE TI AMA SOLO PER IL SESSO. Cerca invece di recuperare il tuo rapporto matrimoniale. Fare l'amore con la persona che si ama è diverso da farlo con il primo che capita. A maggior ragione se conosciuto in chat.<br>  Comunque buona fortuna.|`|d57dac0790a4aa2cf0b6cc294441ec8faa	E vai....alla grande,già sei una frequentatrice di una chat,gia abbordi sfigati da pc ,perchè,senza ipocrisie,questo siete.Gente che si nasconde dietro un nick per far s.e.s.s.o.<br>  Ora tifo alla grande per tuo marito.Vedi che con quelle come te si riesce a giustificare un tradimento: nel senso che spero che ti metta un sacco di corna,anzi meglio se te le ha gia messe.Speriamo.|`|dNs4tVbvaa	che sei liberissima di fare ciò che vuoi...|`|fDhFIJg6aa	Deve essere un bel matrimonio solido il vostro.

En mi, opinión es peor que te ilusionen a que te rechacen. Pienso así, porque quien se abstiene de relacionarse contigo, por lo menos tiene la honestidad de decir las cosas como son y evitarte una pérdida de tiempo; mientras que quien te ilusiona, deliberadamente juega con tus sentimientos, a pesar de saber que no tiene un verdadero interés en ti. Mira, nadie es monedita de oro, así que sería muy dificil que le agradáramos a cuanta persona tenemos enfrente, pero lo que quiero decirte es que de ninguna manera te debes sentir fea por el hecho de que algún fulano te "rechace". Muchas veces tendemos a atribuirnos a nosotras mismas el hecho de que un hombre no nos quiera o nos deje, pero en ocasiones no es que nosotras estemos fallando, sino que todos tenemos muchas cosas en la mente y en el corazón, y puede ser que sean ellos quienes tengan problemas para relacionarse. No te desanimes, sólo ábrete a las posibilidades que te brinda la vida, piensa de manera positiva y verás que pronto tendrás una pareja que cumpla tus espectativas. Suerte!|`|eSeE2BjXaa	lamentablemente las dos..<br>   las  dos  siempre ocurren ..<br>  PRIMERO TE ILUCIONAN ..<br>  Y DESPUES TE RECHAZAN <br>  ....<br>  LAS DOS CASI  AL MISMO TIEMPO..|`|ietXadjraa	que te rechacen|`|iy8qHZjXaa	yo creo que es peor que te ilusionen...<br>  <br>  si te rechazan no saben de lo que se pierden...|`|m58EUzBZaa	No te preocupes.. por ahi debe de andar tu principe azul.. solo que a veces cuesta que llegue para que asi sepamos valorarlo cuando llegue!!!!! y creo que es mas triste que te ilusionen!!!

Are friendship vibes the only ones floating around between the two of you?
xjBFwsVMaa	Maybe your trying to hard and suffocating him.  Or maybe there is something going on that you don't know about.  Sounds like to me that you need to sit down and have a talk about it.|`|AA11586705	This is complete bs. He should at least answer your texts. It takes like 10 seconds to answer a text. He could at least say "sorry, im busy, miss you" or something. It sounds like he's just not interested in your relationship anymore. Im sorry to say this but it sounds like he just doesn't care. If you haven't seen him in that long and he isn't calling you and gets annoyed when you call him, he just doesn't wanna be in this relationship. When a guy likes a girl he wants to put the work in to keep the relationship going, which means calling and making sure the girl knows that he still cares for her. You don't deserve this kind of treatment, there are plenty of guys out there that will give u the affection and care that u deserve. Don't settle for this kind of treatment or you will regret wasting you time later!! My best advice is to call him and break up with him. This will be like a slap in the face and it will force him to decide whether he really wants you or not.

efcuIkd2aa	In my first relationship, we stayed up all night, went to IHop for "breakfast" at 3 AM, and then watched the sunrise.  I was so nervous I even asked her if it was OK that I put my arm around her.  Anyway that night I was leaving to go home for the weekend (was at college), so on my trip home I was literally shaking from the excitement and thought of the pending relationship.  I chose to write her a letter and poem, and when I got back on Sunday I gave her both, with a small flower I had picked back in Melbourne.  Needless to say she loved them.<br>  <br>  Moral of my story is absense makes the heart grow fonder.  Just the thought of her gave me shivers and I could not wait to get back and see her.  So go for it.  You will miss each other, but write or call, and give a big hug when you get back.  Good Luck!|`|1lATVNMJaa	if he likes you as much as you like him, he'll be able to deal with it, and once you move, are you coming back?  how old are you?|`|Uxaj2gmNaa	If you are travelling away your goign to come back right?? well before u travel away just talk to him and be open that you want to get more serious. and then if you do end up travelling when u get back u can just start things up again.. hope this made sense =)|`|AA12087388	Are you coming back? Good, then resume it then if you both are up for it. It will give you time to miss eachother and it'll be fun to come back to a familiar face. Hang out with him until you go (let him know you are leaving of course!), say your goodbyes and tell him you'd like to see him when you return. Go on your trip and have fun! Come back and it'll be there for you if he agrees to see you, too. <br>  <br>  happy travels!|`|gSL9PWkpaa	IF HE REALLLY LIKES YOU THEN HELL WAIT OR GO WITH U
X8xhfhMgaa	you hurt her feelings obviously. She must have really cared for you and you probably stepped over a line that you can't reverse. She saw you differently from then on and all you little mistakes counted for extra. I think she took it too far to just get with someone else in a hurry, but after you lie once and you get another chance you can't mess it up. You should have told her other girls were gonna be there if that is something you knew she would want to know. <br>  Truth is that if she is the kind of girl that thinks doing sexual things with another guy is way to get even then you don't really want her in the first place.|`|9a024954656cff7d6c3366a35be84a41aa	don't say things you don't mean if you said that to me i don't think i would trust you

There are some that I "think" I wouldn't want to see again, but, I know that this really is not true.  If something actually happened to them, I would be devastated.|`|ldXtnGzlaa	Aside from my brother, Mycroft, I don't see my family anymore.

If I never got to see my family again, I really would be very sad.
4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	I would definitely say there appears to be feelings  on both sides, especially since it's become physical. Sometimes actions speak louder than words & by the sounds of things, your ex is that kind of  a guy. Just let him know how much you appreciate the little things he does for you & enjoy your time together. Time will tell what the future will hold.|`|3122ae6f8b98a3cf8f31941e30e7d8deaa	sure|`|9uA7skhtaa	sounds like wants to be back together talk about it see what happends|`|JjWZ85PZaa	it seems like your learning how to be freinds which should come first take it slow one moment at a time!!|`|d1f125bb94ff5cd12f96fde0e2abb550aa	You never mentioned how long he's been your ex? The best advise I can give you is talk to him & to take it one day at a time, and remember the best advice ever given to me about ex's, once your relationship becomes physical you can NEVER go back to just holding hands, take it slow & don't confuse sex for intimacy, make sure it's your mind, your personality and your self worth that he wants, not just sex, in a relationship you only spend about 20% of time in bed, for the other 80% you have to be able to communicate, god I'm glad I'm married & away from the drama of broken relationships, good luck, I hope you get what you want and need out of being with him, take care, Yvette
AA11552835	Yes it does.....age is just a number! Follow your heart and feelings..just be careful!...mail me if you want to know more ;)|`|kf6oeSEHaa	I bet it will work. It all depends how you handle your relationship? Sometimes it doesnt matter whether the guy is older or younger than you. It all boils down on how you and your partner deals with your relationship.|`|8Mn8fu2saa	Um yea thats an impossible question to answer if ya don't tell us your age and his.|`|Xi8HrsJRaa	Well I know many couples who have significant differences in age but have been together for a long time including my parents who are 11 yrs apart and have been married 35 yrs.|`|f8f912b02186493d66e7d20046f028d2aa	The biggest age difference I have heard of working out is 12 yrs.|`|qtVpxOSmaa	Ok. You don't have to take my advice but I wouldn't do it. I have had 5 recent relationships with guys that were significantly older than me. I thought they were going good and one was going to be better than the last but NO. It wasn't. They had issues and the relationships just didn't work out. Relationships with guys ur age usually work out better. That's just my opinion though. Good luck.|`|ZRCzWdPiaa	age isn't really important.. what's key is your guys' maturity level.. right now i'm trying to date someone who's 6 years younger than me and i'm finding out that she's somewhat immature.. anyway.. gluck
f8d4cae714307a0a3164daf34a9bd1f1aa	It is because their are no blond haired blue eyed men in their races. Also, they think American men are suppose to treat women great. But you'd better be very careful if you try to use your looks to get you laid. They believe in having family taking care of bad boyfriends. (Chop! Chop! Get it? I'm not kidding. I live in Asia, and have seen it.)<br>  And what do you mean, "the other factor"?|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	The "other" factor?   What the hell does that mean...Oh well I tend to find me with blond hair and blue eyes to be more narcissistic and less intelligent than men with dark hair and eyes anyway.|`|b606968466360cc0a514f2dbef518044aa	Perhaps it's because for white women your features are common and therefore less alluring.|`|AA12048794	It has NOTHING to do with genetic composition.  It's all about how a man treats a woman.  If your personality cannot justify who you're with, then you don't have much to offer.|`|l9oNVeguaa	Thats because you're a rare find in those countries dude,<br>  take advantage of it, you must be hot

8VyvRNttaa	Around 7:00 is a good movie time.  Getting dark and all.  Its nice.  Give yourselves a good 2 and 1/2 hours.  Talk about your day, ask how hers went, and sometimes you dont have to talk at all.  Its nice to just share someones company.  If its a first date, dont do anything to extreme.  The occasional hug, hand hold and arm around the shoulder would be good.  You want her to feel special but dont scare her off.  Complament her and stuff.  It'll all work out.|`|9827f1b9a2d14d4f7bd881623b64fe4caa	Dude, there's no "right way" to date, just like there's not "right way" to love.  <br>  This may sound hard, but just follow your heart, be a little bold, and if she doesn't like it, it's not the end of the world, she'll know you didn't meant to disturb her space. =)|`|Cnc8sKl5aa	go in the after-noon (later if you are comfortable with each other)<br>  be back within an hour after the movie ends<br>  when you meet her, complement her
tFMrQpPwaa	Depends, really.  Just find out what her interests are and talk about that.

48d11287568d72ad7993f76edf07919eaa	I went and looked this up for you.<br>  At 7 wks. This is considered the 2nd trimester.<br>  The muscles and nerves function. The baby now has reflexes so it can move spontaneously. The thorax and abdomen are entirely formed. The lungs are beginning their slow development.<br>  The heart is now in the thoracic cavity and beats strongly! The head is becoming more prominent and is leaning towards the body.<br>  The mouth can be opened and the eyes can be seen behind the closed membrane layer that will become the eyelids.<br>  Fingers begin to appear. The ears are developing as well as the vestibular system, (the inner ear which is used for balance.<br>  So, in other words this baby can now feel a touch as well as an emotion and he is no longer a cell!!! He is very much alive and responsive to everything around him or her. So, tell her this and maybe it will change her mind! You poor thing, I wish you and the child lots of luck!!!|`|AA11610394	shes wrong its murder of a human being<br>  tell her she can use her own computer and you want to talk when she comes over..|`|583e5d537a6d410ad98990c6d6250044aa	You're both wrong about abortion, but right to terminate the friendship if the two of you can't tolerate each other.|`|631ceb65046a1651fd52daa4e244e441aa	hi dear, about your friend i think you did the right thing...i had someone like that and i thought that she's my friend but she was a friend of my stuff " computer, places where we hang out, my male friends " ...so i guess your friend is the same so you did the right thing<br>  about the abortion, i have no experience about these things <br>  i don't like abortion because i think when someone does this keeps wondering how that unborn baby would look like if were born, right?<br>  the only one who can answer this question is you, do you really want to have this baby?<br>  have a nice weekend|`|AA12306645	Abortion... well, let's see. <br>  <br>  You are obviously very young, but I hope you read this carefully....<br>  <br>  From a medical point of view, a fertilized ovum has only the POTENTIAL to become a child, just as you have the POTENTIAL to learn Chinese, but you probably won't.  Even at several weeks, it has no nervous system, feels nothing, and is not self aware.  Until it can survive on its own, it is a parasite in ever sense of the word from a medical point of view....  <br>  <br>  We could back this problem up and say that each ovum is a potential child deserving to be given life, and to let a woman's cycle go by without fertilization is to deny a human an existence.  And indeed there are one or two remote religions in India who feel that way, and a man has sinned if he does not rape a woman already not pregnant....  This is ridiculous, isn't it?<br>  <br>  At what point do we have humanity?  Sometime during the third trimester.  Until that time, it is simply a clump of cells.  And by the way, most Asians religions have no problems with abortion... So far in America,  if a woman is pregnant against her will, it is HER  body, and HER choice, and the decision is between HER and her physician....and no priest, no rabbi, no mystic leader, no lama,  and no minister nor a religious elder, or preacher belongs in that room with them....  And hon, every child deserves to be wanted and planned for... I'd have been mad as hell had I been the child of a rape, or the child of some 14 year old kid who got herself knocked up... I'd be a child, being raised by a child.  <br>  <br>  If we in the US make abortion illegal as it once was, women who want an abortion will still get one, just as they used to get them... on the dining room table of an abortionist, under un-sterile conditions, risking her life.  When I was in nursing school, a classmate got an abortion this way... she almost lost her life, in the hospital for weeks  because the hook that was used perforated her uterus, and pulled down a section of small intestine.<br>  <br>  Hope this was not too complicated for you to understand..at three weeks, it may have a heart, (but we in the medical field "pull the plug" if there is only a beating heart in a fully grown adult if the family so wishes, if the patient made that choice in a will, and if two doctors state that the coma is not going to ever end... it is called "a persistent vegetative state").... <br>  <br>  A beating heart, hon, is not the definition of life... self-awareness is...physical independence is.  Hope this helps.|`|EjzRDZz7aa	You stopped being friends with someone b/c of her view on abortion?  That sounds shallow to me, but to each their own.  <br>  Side note:  maybe next time your friend comes over, tell her the computer is broken.|`|lk7iMvVFaa	There is no right or wrong answer about weather abortion is right or wrong. I personally agree with you. A baby is a person. You never know if that baby could have been someone to discover the cure for cancer or the first woman president or an inventor. As for your ex-friend, if she was making you feel uncomfortable then it's time to take a break. I had a similar problem with my friend. She was cutting and accused me of talking behind her back. It became a huge argument and we ended up yelling and saying "i don't want to be friends". Now i really miss her. I noticed that she seems really dependent on you. That is definately not a healthy friend relationship. If you have any other questions, you know where to find me. I really hope this helps.

AA11109860	I think that she is just looking for a physical relationship. It is possible that she does like you, but she just isn't ready to be involved emotionally right now.

She wants a sure "bed buddy". Since you've crossed the friendship line, she knows she doesn't have to work hard for it. She knows you'll say okay because she knows you have feelings for her.

Just make sure she's sober when you do this. It's really hard to assume someone's intention for doing things. You just have to be ready and respect whatever she decides to do. You never know what she really thinks and feels unless you ask. And there's no harm doing that. Then, if you have enough courage, tell her how you really feel.

So just be like I know that we both have feelings for each other and you don't want to date nobody because of your vaction but I don't want to change are relationship.  He still likes you but hes prob. shy and scared to say anything. So start the converstation and talk to him at school. Don't be shy because your ways and actions got him to like you and if you don't act like that anymore then he won't. So be yourself.

If you let her know you like her or flirt a lot with her, she'll probably get the hint and then you'll find out if she really does like you or not.|`|4lhqrWJeaa	I think she kinds likes u but it sounds like when she is sort of up set she gets quiet like most girls do when they're upset. I think u should ask her out and see what she says before it's to late. Good Luck!|`|8nnUIWKnaa	dude!!! she totally likes, the behavior is just because shes trying to learn how to get comfortable around you. and she doesnt want to emabarrass herself by saying something stupid, thats why shes sometimes shy. her mood will depend on how good of a day shes having. maybe you should try to make her as comfortable around as possible by showing that your into her (if you are into her) she will start acting more bubbly more frequently around you. inform me on how this goes|`|9D92cgAXaa	i  think she likes you but is scarred of telling you her friend must have laughed because it might have been a coincidence that you talked to her and she was hoping for it.|`|A1f7dW8Caa	It sounds to me as if she likes you and is waiting for you to make a more overt indication that the feeling is mutual.|`|WYDVZuG8aa	I think she likes you. She's nervous around you and she's checking you out.  Good signs, my friend.
ab1qzFRIaa	Well, it took you three years to run her off, maybe it will take three years for you to forget her.<br>  <br>  Time will heal.|`|EjzRDZz7aa	Sorry, sounds like you know you messed up.  She gave you 3 years?  Wow.  Sounds like you need to move on, she isn't going to change her mind.  Find someone who will let you treat them that way, and stay with you, and you won't have that problem (a smart women!) again!|`|0d9AL0evaa	Since this is a long-term relationship, she may change her mind. First, she and you have to get your feelings sorted out and get over the hurt - then you can try again. What I'm saying is that you should give it time, and see whether she comes back to you. Chances are she will; we all live and learn from our mistakes. Your ages are important here, but they were not mentioned. The younger you are, the more probable you will reconcile - but it may take awhile to occur. If you have not heard from her in 4 more months, go see her then. In the meantime, have no contact with her, unless she approaches you. During this waiting period, seriously think why you would treat someone you love the way that you did. Honesty is the only policy in relationships: no games are allowed.|`|AA10766127	it very hard for men to lose a relatioship because most guys are lonly with out friends. and sence you lover her so much its even harder|`|ef5aa673b81e27a6ceda0d9079012dc2aa	I will get KILLED for this answer: <br>  <br>   Men have compassion, although they can be dogs.  <br>  <br>   Women are harpies that will dump any guy on his *** that wont let her have her way because they know they can get some other guy in a second.
LGuar1eAaa	What's the point of her being jelous.....and angry? it's not like she's your girlfriend, right!? You should discuss this matter with the "jelous girl". Tell her that yu have a grilfriend already. That's All. But if she still angry at you then you should ignore her. Don't forget to tell your girlfriend about this. She might get upset!!!(I know I would. Hehehehe).I hope i'd help.|`|149f8c019afa5998094911579fce80d8aa	So? Wo cares if she's angry, she should respect your relationship and move on|`|FgSvOA53aa	Same problem with me too mate!|`|vZj1LH16aa	You're not in trouble. Everyone have the right to like anybody, its thier choice.|`|3005aeced7b7931c6f9555641b9126c1aa	Remember one thing... if your girlfriend is cool with you having friends that are girls, make a bunch of female friends and if anything bad happens in your current relationship, pick your favorite female friend to tell about it. If she listens and truly understands you, and you don't love your current girlfriend as much as you used to, ditch her and be with the favorite "friend".|`|717c6b17a4c6911973a63c4dad176233aa	explain....|`|ETe685uBaa	who cares if shes angry you have the right to have a girlfriend and if shes jealous then thats just too bad for her and its really non of her buisness anyway|`|qstoeBjYaa	Don't let some girl you don't really care about ruin the relationship you are in with. There isn't really anything to do but try to ignore her.|`|ZJpzAwgGaa	Well somethings could go bad here so I will show you how to prevent them. First, of all assure your girlfriend that you love her and that no matter what rumors she hears about this girl and you, you love her and you'll take care of of the other. If you don't make her understand this then she might hear a rumor and get mad at you for not telling her whats going on. Next, don't get mad at this girl for having a crush on you. Just calmly tell her that you aren't mad at her but you don't like her the way that she likes you. Tell her that you have a girlfriend and that her liking you is making it difficult with rumors and such. Just tell her that it is cool that she has an intrest in you but that you don't want her. Saying that she might like someone else and they might like her back will give her hope to get back on track after your telling her your feelings about it all. Then try to forget about it and don't listen to rumors that will happen like "He is a mean person." or "He is two timing."<br>  <br>  Don't worry in time she will find a new crush, the rest of your grade will find somethng new to talk about, and you and your your girlfriend can be normal and carefree again. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  ~Debby :)|`|dZSbhL48aa	Stay with your girlfriend, cheatings bad!
B6WXzAlnaa	Sometimes girls have smelly feet, especially when they wear shoes w/o socks or hose.  A girl with smelly feet should be easy to find.  However, most girls think a guy with a foot fetish is bizarre so good luck finding one who actually likes a foot fetish guy.<br>  You should be upfront with any girl you date about your foot fetish.  Don't let her get invested in seeing you only to find out you're a freak ( and I don't mean that in an insulting way).|`|GFAxfPMVaa	there is like 40% of girls who would but what do you mean put another question about it|`|0286f5cb95be1af784ed54e12366a0f6aa	Everything is possible.

No vayas muy rápido, pero tampoco demasiado lento.  Si tienen amigos en común, que te la presenten.

No te diría "Espera a que se ponga a hacer casitas y ayuda a terminar", ?No! pero sí si ves la oportunidad de que puedas terminar una frase que ella esté diciendo, o participar an alguna conversación con ella o buscar la oportunidad de ayudarle con lo que sea... algo tan simple como abrirle la puerta de un salón (si la ves en la escuela o si no donde sea que la ves) o acercarle una silla, o cederle el asiento... Muchas veces lo más tradicional y sencillo seuel ser lo más efectivo.<br>  Es como si quisieras subir a una rueda de la fortuna en movimiento perpetuo: no puedes saltar en cualquier momento, tienes que esperar a que pase una canastilla cerca de tí para que puedas subir en ella y abordarla<br>  Una ves arriba, ya todo es fácil.

9792216a2cc25dd4a287bf44f01ec326aa	Sounds like the guy i have been seeing and am about to quit seeing him<br>  It is like he has a barrier there and he does not want to let his guard down. We have been seeing each other for nearly 4 months now, always at is place and have only went out on his bike one time. Have never went to dinner, movie , nothing. I know he has been hurt in the past but, so have i. When i told him i was not coming over anymore, he was on the phone calling several times a day wanting to keep this relationship but, it is like it is at his convenience. <br>  I am ready to move on. I really like him but, i need a life, maybe they are related , maybe you need to move on and start a life with someone who is interested in having a life.|`|f08cdab9e2c1a31c572dcf3f40cf9bfcaa	If he isn't respecting you enough to listen to wnything you feel that is important that you want to share with him, then he may not be all that caring about any of your feelings. He is appearing to me to be the type that thinks what he says is golden and doesnt want to listen to the other side. It's clear that he doesn't want to talk to you anymore.<br>  <br>  Personally, (this may not be what you will want to hear or in this case...read) I wouldn't go see him. Let him come to you. If he asks if you are avoiding him, just simply reply "I'm waiting until you are ready to SHARE a simple conversation with me." Or go out and have a blast with your other friends(if you have some) and if you see him and he is making his way towards you, take your friends and start walking off and away. Ignore him like he is you.<br>  <br>  In short, treat him like a mushroom... "feed him crap and keep him in the dark".<br>  <br>  I do think you also need to consider that your relationship with him is slowly coming to an end.|`|TXFL8Uzoaa	It's been just 2 months and he's acting this way...imagine how 2 yrs thing would be.

You didn't really specify... Let's see...  I know exactly how you feel... Closure is a big part... Being silent just kills... I know... I've been there...

You're better than that... It's hard, I know but you'll be okay...  Pray to Him and He will give you strength and guidance....|`|gmA2kX2Daa	oh i know how u feel. ive been there. i get obsessed with guys and act like you do. try not contacting him for a few days...maybe he will come to you?? then try to leave him messages explaining your side of the story (since hes mad at you) if that doesnt work ask yourself if you think there is any chance at all of resolving this. if theres no chance try to move on. maybe theres another guy you like that you can talk to? or go out with your friends and have fun. maybe its just me but if i know someone doesnt want me, i have too much pride (if thats the word) to obsess over someone who acts like that...but i know this is all better said than done.|`|vHUK29sNaa	first off i am sorry to here that and i hope you feel better. What you could do is try telling him that and he may feel sorry and talk to you. But if you want to forget about him you could try listening to music, watch a movie, talk to someone is the best thing because they could listen to your feelings and tell you what they think. The best person would be a close friend, mom, or an older brother or sister. They will give you a shoulder to cry on if you need it. <br>  Time heals all wounds so you could just give it awhile and you should feel better after sometime but don't go into another relationship because you can get very confused and you will feel sadder.<br>  I don't know if this was a help but I hope you feel better.

Si ambos son mayores de edad pues sus padres tendran que aceptarlo aunque no lo quieran, si realmente la amas lucha por ese amor, pero si solamente es sexo pues cuidense, ya lo hecho esta. Te dire que mis abuelos paternos eran primos hermanos y se casaron y tuvieron hijos, pero algunos de ellos incluyendo a mi papa, salieron con problemas en la vista, poco a poco se quedara ciego, y es por lo que te mencione primero, tienen el mismo tipo de sangre, piensen muy bien en lo que estan haciendo y pueden asumir las consecuencias pues adelante.|`|148f2c0ab1f57ae16fdc69757679455baa	Yo creo que si ambos lo deseaban esta bien, el problema es porque lo hicieron, si solo lo hicieron por atracción y solo fue para divertirse no hay problema, el problema  es si sienten algo uno por el otro, eso puede causarles conflicto cuando decidan terminar con la relación porque tendrpian que seguirse viendo por los compromisos familires, y si deciden tener una relación mas seria el problema es que si algun día deciden casarse y tener descendencia podrian tener problemas geneticos por tener ADN similares|`|169d366d85e977f8ef56e2bf15dbb756aa	Que vida le puedes dar la familia que dira y depsues diras me lo dijeron y no hice caso no seas burro busca a una chava que no sea de la familia y deja eso olvidalo y apartate.|`|1bf0b46b3dc456f0ca5fbca9713a29a4aa	Una vez besê a mi prima apasionadamente, despues no me dejaba de acosar todo el tiempo decia que era le chico mas lindo y dulce que conoci?

They act like they want a beautiful black women but will run over to an average looking white woman passing the godess no questions asked.<br>  <br>  Black ppl are taught that lighter skin is prettier, smaller nose, softer hair, all white features. So that is why black men tend to like white women, also they argue less.

Aber keine Angst bis du maal in ein Altershaim kommst werden noch einige Jahre ins Land ziehen. Und bis dahin wird sich noch einiges ?nderen. Ich pers?nlich hoffe das ich zuhause alt werden kann. Und nicht alle Altenheime sind gleich.  Also Kopf hoch.|`|b25992fc0bdf9001720c7042272106f9aa	liebe ratlos sch?n das du das so offen legst, leider wird heute viel zu viel vertuscht und das in der heutigen zeit. wie  du lesen kannst sind viele anderer meinung und haben auch ihre eigenen erfahrungen gemacht, auch wenn es nicht überall der fall sein sollte. ich bin der festen überzeugung das unsere alten und hilfsbedürftigen menschen würde-los behandelt werden wahrscheinlich wegen mangelnder ausbildung, oder weil die person einfach nicht geschaffen ist für diesen beruf, oder einfach nur wegen überlastung ( zu wenig personal). mir stellen sich die haare wenn ich daran denke das die menschen die heute in den alters -und zum teil auch pflegeheimen befinden die menschen sind, die durch den krieg gelitten haben und ein schwers leben danach hatten. heute geht es ihnen wieder schlecht und sie k?nnen sich aus  irgendwelchen gründen auch immer nicht einmal wehren. natürlich gibt es bestimmt auch ausnahmem aber die werden  sicher wieder nur ums liebe geld drehen. das ist so unentlich traurig, mir fehlen einfach die worte.|`|cb2999e3d4d685364cae5486213cb391aa	Meine Oma, die normalerweise bei uns zu Hause lebt, war letzten Herbst für 2 Wochen im Altersheim, als meine Eltern im Urlaub waren. Sie hat ?hnliches erz?hlt. Sie musste jeden Abend um 7 ins Bett (zu Hause gegen halb 10) und lag dann noch stundenlang wach, weil sie nicht schlafen konnte. Eine wirkliche Besch?ftigung gab es für die alten Leute dort nicht und sie sa?en den ganzen Tag nur dort rum. Eine Frau auf dem Stockwerk hat schon mehrmals versucht abzuhauen.<br>  Als meine Oma wieder heim kam, hat sie geweint, so erleichtert war sie.|`|ed24ee4383eee403d9ba0937e2b3285aaa	Fesseln Schelle ausst?pseln oder Beruhigungsmittel kann ich nicht best?tigen. Es gibt zwar Einiges was ich nicht in Ordnung finde und man mu? als Angeh?riger immer dran bleiben aber ich nehme mir z.B. alle 14 Tage die Akte meiner Schwiegermutter und wenn ich nur die kleinste Ungereimtheit finde (und das passiert schon ?fter) dann stehe ich auf der Matte. Ich habe die Erfahrung gemacht wenn das Personal wei? das man regelm??ig da ist dann l?uft so weit alles gut. Trotzdem habe ich immer noch Dinge zu bem?ngeln die ich nicht in Ordnung finde aber das liegt nicht an dem Personal sondern an dem System.<br>  Privat habe ich meine Schwiegermutter jeden Tag geduscht, die Haare gewaschen. Dort passierte dies nur 1 x w?chtentlich und auch die Haare. Das habe ich jetzt durchgeboxt, das dies mind. 2 x w?chentlich passiert. Wenn n?tig wasche ich die haare noch einmal.<br>  Bei anderen patienten beobachte ich Dinge die ich niemals durchlassen ginge, würde das mit meiner Schwiegermutter passieren.<br>  Ich bin 2 x w?chentlich da. Mittwochs und am Wochenende. Mittwochs bin ich immer irgendwie sehr depremiert wenn ich dort war. Für mich undenkbar dort einmal leben zu müssen.<br>  Ich h?tte ihr das gerne erspart aber die Pflege war für mich nicht mehr zu bew?ltigen da ich selbst krank bin.|`|02e4f308e2997d9b68c492142f967901aa	Ich frag mich echt wo du das mitbekommen hast. Ich habe damals in meiner Ausbildung im Altersheim gearbeitet und habe derartige Zust?nde wie du sie schilderst nicht erlebt. Meine Oma ist auch im Altersheim weil sie nicht alleine überleben kann. Ihr gef?llt das so gut dort das sie da gar nicht raus will. Klar gibt es auch andere Heime aber der Anteil ist sooo gering.<br>  Verallgemeiner mal nicht alles, ich kann die duzende Bsp. nennen wo die alten Menschen ein würdiges Leben noch haben....<br>  <br>  Mag sein das deine Mutti das mal erlebt hat ich kenne die Hintergründe nicht und m?chte sie auch nicht kennen. Aber man kann ein Heim auch schlechter machen wie es ist und die Menschen die dort arbeiten leisten echt Knochenarbeit die nicht mal jetzt gesch?tzt wird...|`|6ab3cde6040e6fc4335002e3456fbd78aa	Als Altenpfleger muss ich leider MEINEN Senf aus MEINEM Erleben kurz schildern:<br>  <br>  Kürzlich hat die Familie eines Bewohners den Mann in ein anderes Heim einziehen lassen, weil wir diesen nicht aufgrund seiner Unruhe vor Verletzungen bewahren konnten und auch nicht wollten. Dies h?tte n?mlich Ma?nahmen wie Sedierung und Fixierung erfordert. Und das, obwohl er sich bei uns wohl fühlte!!  Darf ich mal fragen, wer in diesem Fall wohl die h?heren ethischen Ideale hat? <br>  <br>  Und willst Du ernsthaft behaupten "nicht waschen" sei menschenunwürdig?? Ich lache mich kaputt. Was glaubst Du, wieviele Menschen ich schon nicht gewaschen habe, weil ihnen das Gespr?ch wichtiger war? Weil sie Zuwendung n?tiger brauchten. <br>  <br>  Ich kann nur sagen (bevor ich mich in Rage rede): Die Mentalit?t von vielen Angeh?rigen ist es, die es uns zus?tzlich sehr erschwert. Ich werde als Altenpfleger von denen daran gemessen, wie sauber Mutti oder Vati heruml?uft. Keiner fragt mich, wie oft Mutti oder Vati heute schon gelacht hat. Das z?hlt nicht, denn das ist nicht messbar. überlegt Euch erstmal eine neue Definition für Pflege, denn zus?tzlich zu der Grundpflege bin ich Entertainer, Seelsorger, Bürokrat, Hauptverd?chtiger, Anwalt, Schreibkraft, Schwerlastkran, Reinigungskraft, Familienersatz, Vertrauter, Mechaniker, Ohr, Mund und Hand des Arztes. Und es gibt Angeh?rige, die behandeln mich wie ein Stück Dreck. Natürlich gibt es auch massenweise normale Angeh?rige. Sonst würde ich diesen Beruf nicht so gerne machen. Aber das Letzte was ich ben?tige sind Miesmacherei und Leute, die mir was von Menschenwürde erz?hlen wollen.<br>  <br>  Ich fühle mich pauschal verurteilt, etikettiert und stigmatisiert.<br>  <br>  übrigens: Im neuen Altenheim wurde der Bewohner sediert und fixiert und hat noch ein halbes Jahr gelebt. Dann starb er. Das haben die Angeh?rigen durchgesetzt...|`|B8zr9KRnaa	Wenn ich deine frage gelesen habe hab ich mir gedacht es ist nicht so schlimm,kenne man neue Leute und so weiter,aber danach nach ich deine Artikel gelesen habe sag ich dir das ich habe  auch angst wenn soweit ist und ich musst vielleicht in eine Altersheim gehen.Ich kann auch nicht verstehen wieso gibst solche Menschen auf diese Welt,die denken nicht das irgendwann werden auch alt?|`|NGJev5Wtaa	also ich arbeite in einem seniorenzentrum zwar nur als k?chin aber man bekommt ja doch vieles mit und ich m?chte ihr mal klarstellen das es nicht überall so is als erstes steht der mensch so sieht es bei uns aus und es wird alles menschwürdiges gemacht für die alten bei uns. ich weiss nich wo du gearbeitet hasz aber bitte scherre nich alle über einen kamm es gibt auch sehr gute heime wo mit liebe und aufopferung für diese menschen gearbeitet wird um ihnen einen sch?nen alttag zu schaffen. lg|`|U7fCFuVZaa	Ich habe als Enkelin auch alles andere als eine guten Eindruck dieser H?user erhalten.<br>  Leute, warum keine Altenwg′s gründen?

Bei uns werden nicht irgendwelche Beruhigungsmittel verabreicht!!! Natürlich gibt es welche die Beruhigungsmittel bekommen, aber wenn wir denn Eindruck haben  das sie zu sehr sediert sind reden wir mit denn ?rzten und tun es reduzieren oder sogar ganz absetzen.( wir dürfenja nicht mal was gegen Durchfall z.B. Loperamid OHNE ?rztliche anweisung geben.) Es wird jeder tgl. gewaschen und 1x w?chentlich wird gebadet. Ich bin seit 11 Jahren im Heim und wir hatten vor ca. 3 Monaten eine Bew. die im Bett fixiert werden mu?te( kam vom Krankenhaus so) da wurde aber alles eingeschaltet, PDL; ′HL Vormundschaftsgericht usw.. Der Bew ging es nach in paar tagen wieder besser und mu?te nichr mehr fixiert werden und es ging ihr von tag zu tag besser seit sie bei uns ist, l?uft jetzt wieder rum und ist auch geistig viel fitter. Ich habe auch das Buch  Abgezockt und totgepflegt gelesen und es gibt bestimmt  auch solche Heime.<br>  Eine gegenfrage?; Warum schimpft niemand übers Krankenhaus? Die Bew. kommen ungepflegt , haben Dekus, Pilze... Viele Bew. sind regelrecht froh wieder "Daheim" zu sein. / ich meine so werden sie vom Krankenhaus entlassen!!! Tut mir leid ich werde nur sauer das die Heime so schlecht sind usw.. und die armen Bew. es sagt aber niemand was wenn wir geschlagen, getreten, angespuckt... werden und wir bleiben in der situation ruhig.|`|nSxwBvZjaa	Es stimmt die Geldgier und die fehelende Achtung vor Menschen..fehlendes Berufsethos fürt zu solchen Zust?nden..hat Deine Mutter weitergek?mpft? Wenn nicht warum nicht..die alten Menschen w?ren es wert gewesen. Wen ja was hat sie erreicht?<br>  Aber es gibt viele gute Heime wie überall und mit allem gut und schlecht. Mach Dir keine Gedanken es ist noch viel zeit bis dahin es gibt Dinge die kann man nicht ?ndern aber wenn man es kann sollte man es tun..ne Alters-WG tuts auch..ne Krankenschwester dazu und ein Hausarzt um die Ecke..es gibt viele L?sungen..man muss sich einfach bemühen..

bWXozIQRaa	Because that's the way society has made it.It's that way so many things.Like it's OK for older men to date younger women.But let a younger women date a younger man.<br>  But just because you have sex with a lot of guys doesn't make you a whore.It's a personal decision.As long your OK with yourself and not because of self esteem problems.|`|054c60847f792980b8d96ab03373de40aa	i dont know about the word cool, but maybe a player?

The more kills you have the more notchs on your bedposts in the weak minds of other males that makes them men, in my opinion it makes the male whores.  God does not want us men to sleep around but to be faithful to one woman as she must be faithful to one man, it works both ways.

Try maybe a picnic in the park, with all of her favorite foods and deserts, then a sunset stroll and be sure once the light hits her perfectly that you tell her how amazing she looks.  Another suggestion is by treating you and her to a day at the spa.  However tacky you may think it is, she will be impressed that you can put down your man guard and just relax with her for the day|`|uhpU6eL2aa	Hot air ballon ride...if she's not afraid of heights :)
AA10692836	The whole situation sounds very worthwhile. Unfortunately it sounds like there's no way to get what you want cheaply. I'm sure you've already figured that out. All I can say is make sure you get a good attorney(a necessary evil) cause I think you'll need one. I myself am looking at God knows how much in legal fees in dealing with my x wife.

Like why did she only have her for 8 years?  She's lucky about the $98. a week.  I only get 65 and my daughter is 15.  I'm not in Ny or NH.  But in my state it is a given if there is joint custody involved, neither party can go over state lines with the child.  If she has sole custody, then you have a case.  Not sticking up for him, but he's not a dead beat dad if he IS paying child support.  You two do seem like better candiates for her upbringing, with all her needs.  In my experience, 9 times out of 10 the judge always keeps the child with the mother.  I know you love her, but the only way the child will have a good life is if you, her and the ex don't fight over these things, but try to meet in the middle.  It's what's best for her not you guys.  Was the move for your jobs or just to get away from him?  Try to see it from his end as well.  Unless you've gone through this yourself, you have no business judging him, unless you've been in his shoes.  If he isn't abusive to her and she loves her dad, you shouldn't be against him.  How he takes his vacations is his business.  That is between him and the child.  The more you bad mouth him, the more she will resent you two.  Believe me I know from experience.  At her age she will.  Let her decide whether to be mad at her dad or not.  Then it's all off your shoulders.  Take care of her medically, but certain things she should choose.|`|4ca267b6a74a3c10b0a8e57a846c471eaa	Technically nobody is supposed to leave the state without the permission of a judge..You may want to go back to court and make everything legal and official to cover yourself..It does not matter what kind of verbal agreement you had that is not binding and can really blow up in your face..Good Luck & Best Wishes..|`|AA11039040	ex does not stand a chance the law some how always rules in favour of the wife|`|AA11258331	The child is old enough to tell the Judge where she wants to <br>  live.

It will teach her how to act, talk and treat others and if you do educational things with her it will teach her. I would like to take this time to congradulate you for wanting advice on what to do!

bcd6ee24dc878490c490aa33dcbd7b66aa	So sorry you are going through such tough times with your mom.  However, there are ways to resolve this issue, and you are more than capable to do this.<br>  <br>  I would recommend talking to someone, and venting out your feelings. First, you may wish to talk about why do you believe your mom should apologize.  As a friend, they may have a new perspective for you.  Moreover, maybe you can find someone to help you mediate the conflict with your mom.  This can be a aunt, uncle, just someone who is independent from the conflict, and who you can trust.  You can ask them to come to your house, and talk to you and mom at the same time. This will probably help your mom to understand your point of view, and help you to understand your mom's  view.  <br>  <br>  I know this is difficult for you.  But please remember you are an powerful individual who has the power to resolve this situation.<br>  <br>  Hang in there!|`|6CBf1zVdaa	You really need to talk it out with your mother!!!

Then, say "I know you're probably still angry with me, and you can keep ignoring me if you want, but I'm not going to ignore you no matter what you do."<br>  <br>  In short, you'll be the mom. It sounds like your mother isn't very mature, so this is your chance to (a) show that you're more of an adult than she gives you credit for, and (b) show that you two are not enemies, but rather you are partners.|`|2KbdcUDHaa	You two might want to go to counseling if it's a fight. i'm sorry for you!

And not even Tom Cruise (Mission Impossible) can get a woman to change.<br>  You could try sharing responsibilities. She is obviously a messy person, but maybe there are things that she could do around the house. This may relieve you of doing so much. If you really want her to stop being messy, I doubt it can be done. But if you really love her, maybe you can find a way around it.<br>  <br>  P.S. Is there anything that really drives her crazy? You could tell her that if she stops being messy, you will stop (fill in the blank).|`|5702d45b22cda2c434f6d0a45d028af0aa	i myself am not so tidy my husband very obsessed too he makes lists!!and complains alot,but i work and do just about everthing cept lawn work.i tell him if it bothers him to do it himself.my house is lived in not dirty.make a list and talk about it ,cant get worse.love concures all we got married after we lived together for years!!good luck|`|7f45a7d2de45375e0bd049e692e3f6acaa	Well, I don't live with a slob, but my husband is always on my case about the stack of papers I leave in certain areas around the house. We've argued about it. We talked aobut it and thought the best way to solve the problem is to find a  little corner out of the way to put all my crap. We also have applied a rule that community areas are to be clear of all clutter and debris. I have my little corner of crap and he has his. Everyone is happy.

I read once that there will be 10 things about a person that you do not like.  The question is, can you live with the imperfection?  My husband's good qualities make it worth the extra work on my part.  If he were a perfectionist, he most likely would not have his easy going attitude and possibly be on my back for my flaws.  He's a keeper even if he leaves peanut shells all over the carpet and thinks nothing of it.  Wish I could relax & be just little more like him.

It's one thing to be committed to a relationship and another to completely lose yourself.

Otherwise, you'll end up more of a mother than a wife.|`|7f45a7d2de45375e0bd049e692e3f6acaa	Just remember that it's not his fault that he is manic depressive. When you marry someone, you marry for love, for the whole package no matter what. Many people with manic depression can lead normal lives if they take proper care of themselves. This means taking the proper medications at the proper times, not mixing liquor with the meds, and try to reduce the stress in their lives. It is a manageable condition, however, you need to be committed to making it work. This means understanding that he will have his good days and he will have his bad days. You just need to figure out if you are capable of dealing with it. Don't rush into marriage until you figure it out. Try living with him first to see how it would be like on a day to day basis with him. You can also find lots of info on the web pertaining to manic depression so you are more knowledgeable about the condition.|`|AA12306645	Yeah, Ill go with Violet Purple too.... You are in for one hell of an awful life with mental problems.... marriage is tuff enough even when everyone has their head on straight... With depression, ahhhhh  s(h) it are you in for a lot of very sad days, weeks, months, years, and decades until it finally dawns on you that your are just miserable....  your question 'Is it okay............"   Hon, if I knew the guys had mental problems like that, I'd run like hell...............|`|FiOu8Groaa	OK well this is a funny question. I am Bi Polar. I got married 11yrs ago. My mother at the time set the guy down and explained everthing to him and he said he understood. It is a very difficult thing to live with on both sides. If you are sure you understand what it means to really be manic you should go for it but if you are even the least bit unsure dont do it. Try not to throw it in his face when you fight because with meds he should be ok this is a disease that cant go away so. Good luck|`|SmJxHw0laa	My mom is married to a bipolar man. It is an awful life sometimes, but he is also a really nice guy. You have to be super committed to making it work, but only you and he will know if it's right.<br>  <br>  Bipolar people are not to be shunned because of their mentalities; it's not something they can help. If he's right for you, then go for it.<br>  <br>  Just know that it will be hard. Some days you will be living in hades. Some days you will be happy. You will struggle, but then, all married couples struggle.<br>  <br>  My advice? Weigh the rewards of marrying him versus his illness and all it entails.

ca673fde2d7ec46b2fb332313d863a3aaa	You need to find out if you really are pregnant, an over the counter test should be sufficient to give you an immediate answer.  A lot of guys think girls use pregnancy as a ploy and he might be scared you are trying to scare him into a bigger committment then he is ready for.  He probably wants a break to sort all of this out.     Find out if you are pregnant and go from  there.  If you are long distance I don't know how much more of a break from you he needs.  From my experience, breaks usually are not a good thing.  Good luck|`|1a6a5264fbcd72ae12f43fa9c22e6a39aa	It means he wants to break-up but doesn't have the balls to just say it. I don't know your age, but if a relationship is good and stable, people don't need "breaks" like this. He's not talking about taking some time to spend with his buddies bowling, he's talking about breaking up. Also, the timing is a good clue that he's a weenie!|`|4ff334b7a0b2c299c4a9d86eae17e484aa	well i'm a guy and when i used that line i wanted it over , then the girl allways throws in the im pregnaunt card  i think its a way to hold on if you dont find a new one|`|6YTo2Yqmaa	First thing first, you need to get the results of your pregnancy test back or just get an over-the-counter test, ept will suffice, and find out if you are pregnant because this guy is already trying to ditch you.  How much of a break do you need if you have a long distance relationship anyway, think about it?  He's giving you signs now that he wants to run scared.  It seems like he would want to support you emotionally during this time, because you got to be feeling a little anxious right about now, and not to say that he might not be a little nervous or confused too, but hey, if you are pregnant, you got to carry it unless you seek other alternatives, either way, the burden is on you! Good luck and be positive!|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	It means he wants to break up but want's you to be avialable for the next time he wants to use you...just in case you're NOT pregnant.|`|99c37f598c1c82c68de17784567bf5edaa	I thinks it's pitiful that in a time of crisis he wants a break. I hope your not pregnant and if you are...I'd be having serious second thoughts about being with someone who could act that lame.  Gd luck!

RPjsNKFPaa	Lieber Valentino,<br>  <br>  du bist mir gerade der richtige mit so einer Frage und so einem Namen am Valentinstag. Na ja, der ist auch schon rum. Wenn ich deinen Text so lese, dr?ngt sich mir der Verdacht auf, da? du dir immer die falschen Frauen angelst. Vielleicht solltest du beim n?chsten Mal mit dem Sex oder Kondom-Weglassen doch so lange warten, bis du dir sicher bist, mit dieser Frau auch wirklich Kinder zu wollen. Ansonsten k?nnte es durchaus sein, da? du in, sagen wir mal in 10 Jahren, keine Frau mehr findest. Nehmen wir mal an, Du bist reifer geworden und hast deine ultimative Traumfrau gefunden. Alles stimmt. Doch wenn du ihr erst mal erz?hlst, da? du bereits für 10 Kinder von 11 verschiedenen Frauen Unterhalt zahlen mu?t, wird sie es sich sehr genau überlegen, ob sie dir alles gibt, w?hrend du zwischen den 11 Frauen nebst Anhang zumindest geld- und zeitm??ig aufteilen mu?t.<br>  <br>  Am besten w?re es, du suchst dir jetzt mal eine Frau, die bereits 2 Kinder von zwei unterschiedlichen M?nnern hat. Dann wei?t du mal, wie sich so was anfühlt.|`|defadcd6e3a12df9e6913ff584d68e75aa	Warte, bis das Kind 2 Jahre ist.<br>  Dann entscheide neu.<br>  <br>  .|`|5fd1e02c0717605d0818af896f41a583aa	In der Schwangerschaft sieht man so manches gelassener und man sollte auch nicht stets wirbeln,sondern die Ruhe bewahren!<br>  Dann ünterstütze sie doch einfach,es kommen auch wieder andere Zeiten!

Ich finde es nicht gut, dass du kritisierst, dass sie so zugenommen hat. Sicher spürt sie deine Ablehnung auch und reagiert darauf. Sie braucht deine Unterstützung, auch teilweise im Haushalt. Natürlich nur teilweise, denn etwas tun wird sie schon müssen, klar. Es w?re aber gut, wenn du ihr  Dinge abnehmen k?nntest, die für sie schwer sind; sei es der W?schekorb mit nasser W?sche, Einkaufstasche, etc. Jede Frau ist in ihrer Schwangerschaft anders, jede Schwangerschaft verl?uft auch anders. <br>  Wenn du den Eindruck hast, dass sie Depressionen hat...vielleicht stimmt es ja. Dann w?re fach?rztliche Hilfe wirklich n?tig.<br>  Sie zu verlassen, w?re echt fies, weil du an ihrer Schwangerschaft mitbeteiligt bist. <br>  Wenn sie wirklich nix mehr im Haushalt macht, dann w?re es gut, wenn mal eine Freundin, die auch Kinder hat, mit ihr reden würde. Vielleicht kann sie sie motivieren, mehr zu tun. <br>  Du als Mann kannst es ihr n?mlich nicht vermitteln, weil du ja nie schwanger gewesen bist, und fühlst, was sie fühlt.

Die alles kann wichtig sein um sich zu verstehen. Natürlich gibt es weniger arbeitsame Menschen. Aber dies erkennt man auch im Alltag nicht nur in besonderen Situationen.

Most guys fear rejection more than anything else, and so he doesn't want to get denied again.  He also probably sees things going well now and doesn't want to make it awkward by asking you out.  Either drop some real serious hints or ask him out yourself.

bWXozIQRaa	You have to trust him!Unless there is reason not to.You have to remember he is with you.Jealousy will drive you crazy.When other girls are flirting with him .Smile Grab his hand and say I know isn't he so cute?Say He says he's the lucky one but I am the lucky one.Remember this keep your friends close and your enemies even closer.So be nice to them.Not always easy but a smart thing to do.It will make you feel better.|`|657b064eb5cd0984478523a31970625caa	Does he flirt back? If so...kick him to the curb. If not, trust him to be faithful to you. Is the flirting the only thing that makes your relationship not great? If not, maybe you should sit down and do some soul searching to know if this is Mr. Right. If it is, don't be so insecure....after all he is with YOU.|`|56d6b21544757b303e7d332545514ef2aa	why do you think you dont have a great relationship? You have to ask yourself is he the type of guy that would not like a jealous girlfriend. Either way if you feel like these girls are flirting with him and they know you are with him, they are disrespecting you. Hopefully you won't have to do anything and he will tell them himself to back off. If they dont know, walk over and tell them hello, Im ***, his girlfriend. But unfortunately some girls dont care about the girlfriend, and unfortunately some boyfriends fail to mention their girlfriend.|`|Sd5ELNfBaa	talk to him and tell him how you feel. Start by telling him that it bothers you that a lot of girls flirt with him..and if a girl does that next time you're there, just go up to him and kiss the corner of his lips, practically purring in pleasure and telling him you missed him....

These love triangles just never work out well, someone always ends up hurt. If I were you I'd stay as far away from Chad as possible. Men come and go but friendships are much more lasting. Anne will likely be around in your life a lot longer than this Chad fellow. Good luck, these are not easy situations.|`|60WYtHE3aa	Just be completely honest with everyone.

Just keep her away.|`|e4c64a0f85ca15592c041f9f3c15ace9aa	She should talk with her parents and then break up with him.

ac36aff0a21e6fef00eadf826ed698c0aa	That would be a natural feeling inside, it is just the way you feel when you are with that person and how much you miss them when they are away from you..|`|23f54be8e089e8485f69f78f7f75355daa	Maybe butterflies in your tummy when the person is around.

HURRY UP!|`|AIQho2tFaa	To be honest with you i think the fact that he treats you like crap and that you never exactly had closure could be why you still yern for him. i know its sounds crazy but he's like a chase and since he never exactly gave you what you wanted then you seem to seek for it from him , you need to move on to be honest i dont think he ever loved you i justthink that  he liked your attention and since it seems you always felt for him more than he felt for you he enjoyed that power. Get over him move on you seem like a nice girl youll find someone who will appreciate you just the way you are.|`|IL4c5jcTaa	well he obviously was a jerk and doesnt deserve you if he was like that to you, but time heals, and it will for you too, so over time, u will feel so much better!, as for now, focus on your future, on what you want to do with your life and school, as hard as it seems now, it wont be worth so much in the future! you will eventually find someone and he will be way better then ur ex-boyfriend!. so go out with friends, have some fun!do ur work and focus on your future!you have so much more to look foward to! and you will forget about him slowly over time!|`|ae288b5ab13dc29a1e153f42d769f61faa	my ex was also abusive and i am SOOOOO glad i dumped him!

a66ac756591305771b8a6252268ca340aa	People who fear commitment dump people they really like. Basically, they're afraid of rejection, so they reject first. It doesn' tmake sense, and it sucks - but you don't want to be in a relationship with them anyway.|`|3490bfd259ea171d15bc375ab4617cf0aa	too good = boring.<br>  <br>  In other words, females want someone who treats them sh i tt y, even though they say they dont.<br>  <br>  They aren't lying to you, they just are talking from their social conditioning.|`|6p6JB09laa	my man, go check out David DeAngelo on the web and read, read, read, then buy some of his stuff. all the real and true answers are right there, you will have to look no further..attraction isn't a choice and most women are not attracted to "nice guys"  hurry to the D.D. info  GO!|`|ebb03091873ac9bfc974fa5160bac398aa	Sorry, not my case.

Chances are that she has had abusive relationships or something happened that has made her self asteem drop- triggering her thought process to believe that she doesn't deserve what she should. <br>  <br>  I've actually had friends who were in abusive relationships and they wouldn't get out of it because they thought the man was too good for them still. The excuse was mainly "oh he has a really good side and he's really a wonderful person- I haven't found anyone else like him." <br>  <br>  NO girl deserves that but unfortuanately today, society is so messed up, even some of the prettiest girls feel like they're trash.<br>  Hope that helps.|`|VKuP40NXaa	no guy is too good for me<br>  HA|`|b1364a4b64566d830e15f39ea020ab3faa	Ha!!!<br>  The "You're too good for me."  is a line guys will use to break up with a chick.|`|ca2993bcfc02a71ffa2e5ba2ad3285d2aa	no, but instead of pursuing my man i made him (who I thought was too good for me) pursue a date with me instead.<br>  <br>  He now says that when we first met he thought that I was too good for him  :)|`|AA11606930	No, if anything I was too good for him|`|AA11643070	Nope never no one is better than me the only thing that makes people think that they are better than other people ismoney.

They like to think too much|`|xFRZaFWaaa	ok here is the answer , with no B.s.'ing or attempts to hide anything..ABSOLUTELY, we pretend not to be jealous when in fact we are..Why?? Jealousy is a non - attractive emotion. Sometimes uncontrollable, and guys ( well myself) don't like to be in a situation where I'm not in total control of emotions, and reactions. Its nothing to be proud of. Some say your jealous, means you care.. LOL . That could be partially true, but Jealousy plain and simple is insecurity in some form or fashion.

Start exercise or do new activities with buds to get over her.<br>   <br>  2.Next time you see her don't be so eager to talk to her,or she will think that you want to get back  together.<br>  <br>  3.Don't forget to bathe.<br>  <br>  4.Soon she will know what she has lost.<br>  <br>  5.MOVE ON TO THE NEXT!|`|AA11649475	From experience, I can tell you that time heals all wounds. Right now you feel horrible, and maybe even like there isn't a reason to go on; but trust me, with time (provided you don't see her on a daily basis) her memory will fade and things will improve even more if you find a girl that is like or better than her. Just keep doing what your doing, and keep busy, the less idle time you have, the less time your mind will be able to wander.|`|GYRmcJy4aa	Well first you have to want to move on. When I went through this I had to focus on the hurt full stuff she did... I had to make myself think of other things when she would pop into my thoughts. I had to force myself to stay away from her. I wanted to still be her friend, but you cant do that until you no longer want her. It is a long hard journey you are on so don't let your guard slip. Fill your life with things that don't remind you of her.|`|JjWZ85PZaa	Another Tear drop in the bucket..........FUCKIT!

jQH6brEDaa	Credo non siano problemi tuoi ma del tuo titolare, lei non ha fatto altro che usufruire delle possibilita' offerte dalla legge. Credi si sia fatta mettere incinta apposta?|`|b536c8e14ed51cfe62ac9ab8ee215f46aa	Di semidelinquenti di questo genere ce ne sono tante. Purtroppo con le leggi sul lavoro che abbiamo e la disonestà<br>  di certi sindacati credo ci sia poco da fare.<br>  <br>  ------------------------<br>  Potete mettere tutti i pollici contrari che volete (finora 4), ma resta il fatto che co sono lavoratori onesti e disonesti che si approfittano delle leggi fatte per i lavorattori.<br>  Pur da dirigente, mi sono messo spesso in urto con capi del tersonale di livello superiore al mio per andare incontro ad esigenze dei lavoratori, per essere poi tradito da rappresentantidella commissione interna o loro amici per quattro soldi o fabvori da parte della proprietà dell'azienda.<br>  <br>  Io ho fatto risse con la proprietà per portare le ore di lavoro da 48 a 44, e poi per far avere a tutti il sabato libero e le 40 ore.<br>  <br>  Qel o quella cretina che parla di ruota che gira sappia che io ho lavorato da quando avevo 14 anni, ho sgobbato e sputato sangue, e dove ero dirigente ero entrato come ultima ruota del carro e ho sgobbato, mi sono dato da fare, ho introdotto idee nuove per rendere più facile il lavoro, e anche ''coperto'' ritardi e varie scemate, per avere poi certi ringraziamenti da parte di alcuni soggetti. e non ho mai avuto raccomandazioni o spintarelle. Prima di sputare veleno riflettete un momento. Per quell'altra, che ne sai che il datore di lavoro non abbia fatto tutte le cose in regola. Se ci sono ''padroni''<br>  che hanno rubato e messo sul lastrico famiglie, ci sono anche ''lavoratori'' che con pretese assurde hanno distrutto aziernde.<br>  <br>  Esistono avvocati del lavoro che dovrebbero essere messi in galera, e ho visto dipendenti con pretese assurde rivolgersi al giudice del lavoro ed essere buttrati fuori per manifesta<br>  assurdità delle loro pretese.<br>  <br>  Per Lalli: probabilmente sei molto giovane. Prima di dare dell'imbecille a qualcuno pensa almeno tre volte, poi prendi fiato. La balordaggine non è mai da una parte sola. Ora sono pensionato we continuo a lavorare, e i miei datori di lavoro sono loro ad essere preoccupati che possa stufarmi ed andarmene, a riposarmi prima di crepare.<br>  <br>  Sempre per Lalli che parla a vanvera, in quella azienda i colleghi a tutti i livelli mi scrissero una lettera per non farmi andare via dopo che mi ero licenziato per un altro posto di lavoro dato che tra ''lavoratori'' e ''proprietà'' mi avevano reso<br>  la vita impossibili.|`|63b1853f30e398f1fd62d6efc468255caa	E' vero che lei non si è comportata nel migliore dei modi, da come ce l'hai messa tu, ma il mobbing non è certo quello che lei fa a te, semmai di come voi colleghi vi rapportate a questa storia. Lavori in un'azienda , insomma..., non mi dire che hai bisogno di qualcuno che ti dica se esiste o meno il mobbing tra colleghi perché non credo tu sia così ingenua. Esiste eccome, anche verticale, dal basso verso l'alto, dal subordinato verso il dirigente se questo si trova in una situazione difficile che lo rende vulnerabile. Per quanto riguarda il "signore" di sopra che parla di delinquenza in questo frangente, lo invito a farsi un esame di coscienza pure lui invece di alzare le barricate additando questi comportamenti. Sono forse peggiori di certe bidonate?, di licenziamenti ingiustificati? di aziende poco serie nate solo per fallire? di certi imprenditori incapaci che si arricchiscono per due anni e poi mandano tutto a p.u.ttane, dipendenti compresi? Di queste storie ne siam pieni. Se le barricate si devono alzare, allora evviva la maternità a costo dei peggiori , naturalmente, non di chi non se lo merita. Io ho assistito ad una storia molto simile alla tua: lei, mobbizzata, se ne è andata in maternità quando ha mangiato la foglia che non sarebbe stato più lo stesso ambiente:Ma ne ha fatti due di figli, ed ha fatto benissimo. Ed poi ha vinto anche la causa per mobbing. Ma certo, si dirà naturalmente che i giudici erano tutti "comunisti" no?|`|97951b096d7c9044e6ee791b869c0c50aa	penso che sia un problema che riguarda solo il tuo datore di lavoro, non credo proprio che abbassarsi a prenderla di mira sia un comportamento degno di persone civili.|`|BpZ0yFqtaa	Tu dici "il titolare le disse che avrebbe dovuto licenziarla" ma in base a cosa? Al suo cosiddetto insindacabile giudizio? Aveva forse lei fatto delle mancanze disciplinari? O la ditta era in crisi e lui aveva fatto REGOLARE richiesta di riduzione di personale? Se non ricorre NESSUNO di questi casi allora la tua collega HA FATTO SOLO BENE!!! Una volta che si è assunta una persona per licenziarla è necessaria una GIUSTA CAUSA o un GIUSTIFICATO MOTIVO, ed è giusto che sia così perchè il diritto al lavoro di un dipendente non può e non deve dipendere dai capricci o dai calcoli fatti a tavolino di un imprenditore. Quindi se lei ha trovato il modo di rifarsi non le dò torto, anzi do torto a TE che invece di essere solidale con la tua collega lo sei col titolare. I dipendenti devono essere solidali coi dipendenti e i padroni coi padroni.<br>  <br>  A te che ti lamenti delle leggi sindacali non so se sei imprenditore o dirigente, nel primo caso ti auguro ti vengano a trovare spesso GdF, Ispettorato del Lavoro e ISPESL (tanto qualcosa che non va lo trovano SEMPRE), nel secondo ti faccio notare che per le leggi attuali è più facile licenziare un dirigente che un operaio.|`|eVR9hYDfaa	Dovresti non giudicarla, tu non puoi sapere cosa è la sua vita, cerca di armarti di comprensione e vedrai che le giornate scorreranno meglio anche per te.|`|tHp6c5tuaa	suo marito ,al contrario,avrebbe potuto andare in "maternita'"...<br>  <br>  ma a te in fin dei conti,cosa interessa?

AA11618542	It's okay to like a girl and not know if she likes you back! First, you need to accept the fact that you like her, and you will keep on liking her for a while. Just keep on talking to her no matter how embarassed you feel inside, and don't show any awkwardness. Maybe once you guys get to know each other better, you guys can go out! :)|`|VDKkzLt4aa	i couldnt get what u r saying,..however, if dat gal is treating u bad, den u have 2 let go.u cant live with someone like that 4 so long, not good for either of u...sometimes, u love someone, and they never love u back..u simply gota let go...u'll b happier wen u find someone who loves u back and respects ru feelings...|`|ccf259d9de9183909d470d154894a382aa	It was easier to talk with her when she was with ur friend b/c she was taken and anything u said u could play off as kidding!

You just need to get the conversation started! Girls like it when then cant have something and so when u werent interested in her she pulled u back in! Just try and talk with her and see how that goes! Hope this helps!

VEMNTD9baa	Penso che tradire faccia sentire chi lo commette un verme (chiedendo scusa ai lombrichi che sono utilissimi alla natura).Parlo naturalmente di individui normali .Ad esempio per un delinquente rubare e' normale amministrazione mentre per una persona normale e' impossibile poiche' va contro alla propria morale. Cio' premesso dichiaro che non ho mai tradito la mia moglie poiche' non ne ho mai avuto la necessita'.In  piu' di 28 anni di vita comune non mi e' mai passato per l'anticamera del cervello l'idea di avere una relazione extraconiugale; sto troppo bene col mio tesoro, in tutti i sensi.Confesso di avere avuto una fortuna immensa ad incontrarla quel 4 settembre del 1979 e vorrei che tutti fossero fortunati come me .E di possibilita' ne ho avute e ne ho abbastanza frequentemente , pero' Lei e' la Migliore ,o,come si dice a Torino,THE  BEST !.|`|aizCQVmWaa	non ho mai avuto compagne fisse, per cui non ho mai tradito, ma la maggior parte delle compagne che ho avuto tradivano e non se ne preoccupavano molto, tanto<br>  <br>  una lavata una schiacquata è come mai usata.|`|WUYm4lB9aa	Le ragazze si , la moglie no .<br>  Avrebbe dovuto essere il contrario , molte ragazze con le quali ho avuto relazioni , non avrebbero meritato questo mio comportamento .<br>  Si credo di averlo sempre detto , in diverse maniere però .<br>  A volte basta uno sguardo .<br>  Ciao .|`|1f023db3e89570f0653cae6cb45b9862aa	La tua domanda avrà risposte diverse a seconda dell'età e dello stato civile. Personalmente, non conosco nessuno, maschio o femmina, sposato o in coppia da tanti anni, che non abbia mai tradito nemmeno una volta. E non penso di conoscere solo brutta gente:-)<br>  <br>  Ovvero, dopo un certo tempo il desiderio, la curiosità, la noia ( il matrimonio non è esattamente un parco giochi), si fanno sentire, sempre. Che poi uno rimanga fedele per paura o semplicemente per mancanza di occasioni, ma dentro di sè lo farebbe subito se potesse, non ha alcuna importanza...non è quella la vera fedeltà.|`|688b3c24bbda6455700dc8b7164d5883aa	mi ero rimessa con lui,nonostante mi avesse detto una bugia:mia veva detto che mi aveva tradito e io come carattere gli e la devo far pagare,sono vendicativa.L'ho ricercato,c'è cascato ma a me non importava niente di lui,ho baciato un altro e dopo un pò l'ho lasciato con una scusa.|`|ff8fe524a04d075fbb55f16577214d87aa	Tutti moralisti! Invece io voglio essere sincera, anche se non orgogliosa. Io ho tradito agli inizi di una storia lunghissima con un ragzzo. Certo, se potessi tornare indietro non lo farei mai! Mi sono sentita male per tanto tempo... Ma sono anch'io un essere umano e ammetto di aver sbagliato! Comunque non l'ho mai detto a nessuno sulla faccia di questa terra, anche dopo il tradimento sono andata anvanti con il mio ragazzo per tanti anni senza che lui sospettasse di niente. Evidentemente non era quello giusto perchè con l'uomo con cui sto adesso non lo farei nemmeno sotto tortura!

Potrei risponderti semplicemente perchè la amo, ma ti dirò di più. Posso aver anche provato attrazione per qualche altra donna, questo è naturale, ed ho avuto anche concrete occasioni, questo è possibile: però ho fatto una scelta della quale sono convinto e mi sento così "libero"  da volerla portare fino in fondo.

bWXozIQRaa	Are you talking about a certain girl? Or just all girls?<br>   The best advice I guess in any situation is to be your self! be her friend first.Be caring ,honest, and have a sense of humor!<br>  Then romance her!Flowers,sweet cards,nice little notes,candy! And really listen to her likes and dislikes!Always remember things that are important to her!<br>  Good Luck!|`|K7f7X4kWaa	You have to "WOO" her do you understand what I mean you have to give her everything you got and no holding back. She has to see that you have what it takes to get her and then hold her as your women. You just might have to show your tough side or maybe show her your soft side, but no matter what do not show her your a punk! Find out the things that she like and if that mean you have to join those things then you better join them. Get in good with her best friend, but please do not become a stalker.

61386735c3ba7466ce2f1c47783eda02aa	Kürzlich ist mir eine halbwegs aktuelle Ausgabe der popul?rwissenschaftlichen Zeitung "Psychologie heute" in die Hand gefallen, in der genau dieser Frage nachgegangen wurde und die sich auf entsprechene wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen bezog.<br>  Welches sind die unabdingbaren Gemeinsamkeiten, die für eine lang andauernde Beziehung vonn?ten sind?<br>  Das Ergebnis war einfach, wie verblüffend. Es ist nicht die Religion, es ist nicht die politische Einstellung und es ist auch nicht das Einkommen bzw. Verm?gen. Die wichtigste Gemeinsamkeit, die Paare haben müssen, liegt demnach beim Ausgehverhalten. Wenn das übereinstimmt, stimmen auch  die wesentlichen anderen sozialen Faktoren der Partner überein, wie z.B. die Interaktion innerhalb von Gruppen, und die Wahrschienlchkeit eine lang anhaltenden Beziehung zu führen soll rapide ansteigen.|`|2e2d58815a2dbfc897254654b0f0413daa	Definiere Beziehung!

My best Advice(although I am going to get some thumbs-downs for this), is to be open, honest, and ask her why she doesn't. If she doesn't change or is affected by you asking this(in a good way, cuz she could flip out on you for questioning her love for you) break up with her and spend some time being single. I say to be single instead of jumping on ahead and getting a new girlfriend (since you seem to have enough love for current girlfriend to buy her a new car), you may have some difficulty dealing with being seperated from her. but it would be in your best interest.

But don't worry if you trust each other and love one another it should work.
xjBFwsVMaa	Yes it sounds like you are drifting apart.  I hate to tell you but it happens.  But maybe if you tell your friend how you are feeling she may  start including you again.

I hope I'm wrong!|`|AA12274312	find some private time and have a talk... ask her if she still wants to be friends with you, but not to the point that you're reduced to a "friend" who tags along with her other friend/s... no one can force you to do something, it's your own choice after all... if remaining as friends with her means continuing all these pretentious things, then stop being friends with her... don't be scared to find new friends... some friendships are just not meant to last for as long as you'd like them to...<br>  <br>  And remember this: "The important thing is not to be bitter over life’s disappointments. Learn to let go of the past, and recognize that every day won’t be sunny. And when you find yourself lost in the darkness of despair, remember that it’s only in the black of night that you can see the stars. And those stars will lead you home. So don’t be afraid to make mistakes – to stumble and fall – because most the time, the greatest rewards come from doing the things that scare you the most. Maybe you’ll get everything you wish for. Maybe you’ll get more than you ever could have imagined. Who knows where life will take you? The road is long, and in the end, the journey is the destination.”|`|AA10069057	goodluck<br>  <br>  drifting apart from a friend is hard but part of life<br>  <br>  im going through the same thing. it gets easier|`|b2ear1Z1aa	No offense but that's not a TRUE friend.

For instance if you're back in the 1600s you might get married at 13 or 14.  As life expectancy increased the marriage got pushed out farther.  In some cultures like Asia women may not marry until they are in their late 20s... and still be virgins.  <br>  <br>  Each girls different and depends on her situation.  People can be forced into sex by peer pressure and other people are strong in their convictions to not have sex until much later.  There's no magic age.

sdVAGzjnaa	I wish I knew what state you were in, but anyway... It sounds that the court is trying to determine which house hold is better for the child. Now, I agree with and support YOU  from what you wrote, with that being said, how you wrote it suggests that the better house hold is his. You suggest he has family, where as you don't have a job- you must see how the courts will interpret this. It may help you try another court system, for example another state's system where a mother's favor may be larger. You will be in con temp of the original order, but out of state and (some) jurisdictions. Do what is best for the child, (obviously you will you're the mother). And do them of your own free will. Consult a lawyer before doing anything and most importantly get information, learn all you can Before you need to use it.|`|8hlT20u4aa	Since the child isn't yet in school, the best would be 3 and 1/2 days a week.  My daughter was 1 when her dad and I split up he was given 50/50 and it was the above.  <br>  <br>  His lawyer is using common scare tactics with you though, not many judges will go for a 50/50 set up with an infant it usually changes once they get older, if what you are doing now is working every other day then the judge will more than likely keep it that way.  But you do need to seek legal assistance, the babies father having one and you not having one is not very bright, You will walk out of court with nothing you want and his father will have everything he wants plus, so be very care full do not underestimate the power of coverage by a Lawyer.|`|58f327e5913569bfa6b724dc4dbed268aa	i was told that if the baby is under 18 months..they wont take him from you.  you can request that he see the baby every other day but that he spends nights with you.  i think the judge would grant you custody since you are able to stay home and be with the child.  alot of men want 50/50 custody then they wont have to pay for child support. <br>  <br>  i dont think trying to do this on your own is going to work.  get legal aide..its free.  and it can only help you.  you need to know what you are getting into!  <br>  <br>  my girlfriend played dirty to get custody..she put a restraining order on the dad and said he hit her...so she now has custody and he has visitation 2 hours every other day.  monitored..   <br>  <br>  good luck to you and your baby...

It is not illegal.  A parent at this point can petition the courts to have the child brought back to the State they live in but everything will be heard and the child's best interest will be decided.

bWXozIQRaa	there are pills that say yhry are all natural!Try some of those.
8cea6c5c6ba32406374ea2ecc2e27644aa	compliment her and kinda make her know that you like her(without telling her) and then just say "will you go out with me" or you could have your friend ask her for you<br>  <br>  seems like she like you go for it|`|gdOsiO21aa	Forget what you've been told... BE HONEST!!!  Tell her exactly just that without the extra ooey gooey cheesiness and ask if she'd like to spend some time together.  If she says yes, then be specific... (e.g., I'd like to take you to a movie Friday night...)  If she says no, burst into a wild laughter and put on your most "together" face and say, "Girl, I was just PLAYIN with you!!! (or something to that effect) Either way, it'll work!!!
bWXozIQRaa	I think you are stereotyping people.Not all people are bad just because the come from a certain place.
xjBFwsVMaa	Is there another girl in the room...?  If there is maybe trying telling her to look and to say something... I would rather hear it from a female then I would a male especially if the female was a friend.  Make sure the female friend whispers it to the girl... and not yell it because that would be another awkward situation lol  But that just may be me....|`|1afT1qxIaa	Just keep your mouth shut.  If she freaked when you told her you liked her, she's really going to freak now that she knows your checking out her *** everyday.  You might come off as creepy.|`|L9YfZ7S6aa	First I would try putting an anonymous note in her IN box at work or on her desk. Stating that her style of dress is not appropriate for the office. Say that you have heard whispers about her uncovered tummy and her butt crack showing pants. State that you care about her feelings and wanted to let her know so she could correct her way of dressing for work. Tell her that if you were in her position you hope someone would let you know that your clothes are inappropriate and show a little too much skin.|`|ce901c9c6ab1b4d6797dfcc4f4e2db53aa	Put to her this was, "Hey sweet heart pull up those pants unless you really like to show the plumbers your crack".<br>  Or when casually walking by her desk while her crack is in full view just casually make the comment , "I see where the good Lord slip you" and point to the back side of your jeans and then to her.<br>  A little embarrisment is a good way to make people to be more aware.|`|f0453c6d9e41d01fa0eddb6fa7bd36e6aa	If it happens again talk to your employer or have her written up if she is the one doing it
AA10573998	He might have changed, but I think you should still be careful and try to remain friends for another year or so (especially until he gets past the depression).  You have a history, so that makes you have all these feelings for him.  Most of the time those feelings are left over from the past and it doesn't mean you are necessarily supposed to be with him in the present.<br>  <br>  I think the problem is that you kept in such close contact with him.  You didn't seem to break away enough to get him out of your head completely.  Then you would have been able to make this choice without the loving feelings influencing you. <br>  <br>  Here's the thing:  Whenever I have trouble with telling my mother something, I know I'm making the wrong choice.  Feeling weird or embarrassed about telling them is a sign right there that you all know you should leave that relationship alone.  Just remember everything your parents went through while your ex was hurting you.  Now, think of them first instead of this guy again, because your parents will always protect you, but your ex doesn't have as much credibility.<br>  <br>  Chances are he's a bit lonely and your presence makes him feel better.  And you probably think of how it COULD be now and you're still holding on.  But listen to me:  Though he has gotten help, he still has a history there.  You don't wanna put yourself in a position for certain things to resurface, and trust me, they can resurface (and jealousy doesn't always disappear).  <br>  <br>  Focus on YOU right now, and YOU alone.  If it's meant to be, you guys will come together at some point.  But for now, you need to have a bit less contact with him or else you'll never be able to make a decision without the thought of him being there in your mind.  Give someone new a try, you can do it, just try.  I know you love your ex, I can tell.  But you can love him, be supportive of his progress, but still do what's SMART.  Let him do his college thing, and you do your own thing right now.  Please try to have less contact, I can't stress that enough.  Your mind will be free and you'll be proud of yourself later. <br>  <br>  I have an ex right now who keeps calling and everytime he does I feel myself slip back into those old feelings.  When I take a break from hearing his voice & having those long convos, I realize that he's adding a bit confusion to my life, and that I think about him too much.  I know I have to be stronger than that, and I am.|`|9jnTJqUCaa	I believe that if he was abusive before, Then that means it was the drugs, the drinking, that mess up his mind.. It looks like he has changed but,  I would not recommend you going back with him.. Usually people leave for a certain amount of time and when tey come back they are all nice and look like they changed but when time comes they go back to their old Selves.|`|AA10688222	Hell no! Don't do it!|`|bS5dzMe2aa	i believe that there is a good chance that he has changed!! if he already got rid of alot of stuff that made him do that and its been a while for him to get his mind straight...i say just do what you think is right!|`|xjBFwsVMaa	I don't think I would EVER give someone a second chance after physically abusing me... that is the one and only reason that I will leave my boyfriend.  I know it looks like he's changed but what if it's just a mask to get you back so then he can beat on you some more... or even kill you??  You have a right to be afraid of what your parents would think or say..... because there would be no way on earth any GOOD parent would want their child to go through that... especially again!  I don't mean to sound like such a downer.. but seriously I do not believe that going back to him is a good move on your part!|`|kGnozT8Maa	yes<br>  time will tell <br>  but it looks likes it pretty much over<br>  move on|`|8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	Move on. Stop playing in the past.
b633b28d3b4bb03bf27c7f1a2219d912aa	He need's to give more detail,more input.|`|4Dn7JRFWaa	hummm well he gave you an honest answer the question is how did it make you feel? If it upset you then theres your answer if not then all must be ok|`|37EM7Oawaa	Some guys just think they can use gurls and some are loving/caring. You just have to pick the right type.
DVH3Dk97aa	dont worry about it. my sister went to her prom alone because she was completely heart broken over some bastardd who cheated on her. and two of her close guy friends asked her but she said no to both of them , because they were both friends and she didnt want them to start fighting and becuase she didnt want to go to prom with someone if it couldnt be that cheating assss. so dont worry. she had a great time anyway, and she just took the pics withher friends. have fun!|`|MjfrrsGPaa	Go alone and take pictures alone. The only people who know you came alone will be the photographer and your friends in the limo. There are always people without dates who still go.|`|xjBFwsVMaa	My junior year I went to prom alone, and my senior year I just brought one of my best gal friends that had moved away.  It isn't that big of a deal to go alone then of course you also wouldn't have to worry about your date being completely uninterested in you and not talking with you the whole night.  As for pictures if this girl is your friend why not?  Or you could get a group pic with all your gal friends and there dates or just your gal friends.  You'll have a good time... just don't let the slow dances bring you down. :)  Have fun and good luck.|`|003f9f3982e3b2aa8b6a09649ae4275daa	There is nothing wrong with that!  As long as you have fun, dance, and chill out when the slow songs come on. <br>  For pictures, I'd just take group pictures with your friends, I wouldn't take those "date" pictures at the prom.  Just make sure you look hot and confident, and you'll have a great night. I hardly spent time with my date at the prom!|`|3ug6jv37aa	Yeah you dont need a dog (guy) standing next to you in a picture BUT if you REALLY want a date then ask your cuzin or a real close guy friend but dont wrry bout it!!! Good luck and hope you have fun at prom!!!!xoxoxo|`|5f3f192c5fdec45dd4c614805c3010b1aa	Its fine to go alone.. prom doesnt mean "go find a date to go with" its just a party.. I went alone on my prom with a group of friends, and I didnt care one bit I was date less. <br>  <br>  You can take pictures with everyone, and thats best to remember the good time. If you want to bring a guy friend or just a random guy cuz you "need" a date, then do it.. but i'm telling you, nothings wrong with going date less to the prom.
31e2812ba8d774ab20eb2a5c9bfb9ff8aa	uuuh, NO!|`|bb9c4f3e41ab5008b633fd63a7aa8950aa	Honey, you must ask yourself why you would want to be friends with someone who treated you poorly. If he was a female friend and he treated you poorly, would you still long for the relationship?  Probably not. Remember that you are a wonderful person and you do deserve to be treated with love and respect.  Heartache is not love or respect.  Let him go. Don't try to be a friend.  He doesn't want a friend or he'd have treated you better.|`|1978e46edc09459d102fc12e39033842aa	Sometimes a clean break is the best solution.  If he treated you badly the first time around and you still want to be with him what you are feeling is not love, it is extreme neediness.  It's one thing to have a great relationship that ends suddenly and feel crushed and confused.  That happened to me and I hung in there and now we're getting married in a week!  Our brief breakup happened because he got scared not because he was a jerk.  If you know you BF treated you bad, why would he suddenly change.  You'd like to believe that he learned his lesson and will change because he realizes that he really loves you - but you know that isn't true.  It sounds like he could be playing you because he knows you will put up with a lot of his crap.  Don't go there, girl.  Protect yourself and if you are going to fight for a man (like I did) make sure he is worth fighting for and that you have a relationship that is worth the effort and emotional risk.  You know you deserve better than what you've been getting and your real friends and people who love you hope you'll be strong and kick this loser to the curb.|`|5eb0761eb744051582ce7d04cb766ad9aa	The truth of the matter is that you do not love him. It is that you don't love yourself. When a person loves themselves, they do not allow others to mistreat them. You need to let this guy go and learn how to love and appreciate you and all that you offer to this world and to your friends and family.|`|AA11573606	sorry to say but HELL NO you shouldnt be friends with him|`|vZj1LH16aa	I been through this situation. You should leave him and not talk to him or see him until you are able to accept the fact that you and your bf are broken up.  And you shouldn't even go back to him, or it will end up the same way you guys broke up for.<br>  <br>  Mean while,  find something you like to do. Like hanging out with friends, meet new peoples, go to church, go to a gym, or even read a book. Just keep yourself busy most of the time.<br>  <br>  TIME is only way can curse this disease.<br>  Good luck.|`|2f4a254e041f0cf105dd6ebbc7d85142aa	Why on earth would you want to be friends with someone who treated you so badly and was nothing but heartache 95% of the time? Please have some self-esteem, you deserve so much better than someone mistreating you in such a way. Do yourself a huge favor, don't take anymore calls from him and don't call him anymore. Move on and find yourself a guy who is going to respect and love you, he is out there waiting! =)|`|9bW6nIWLaa	well  i can relate because i have an  ex-boyfriend  who i broke up with a while ago whom i still have feelings for even though i have a boyfriend when ever i see him i can't help but think about  our relationship even though he put through damn near hell|`|AA11903783	If your relationship is 95% heartaches I am so much surprised that you are asking us this question. Look for a relationship that is 100% full of bliss. That will make you very happy. Don't sulk on something that gives you a lot of heartaches.|`|BaWqU8fIaa	If he treated you badly, when he supposedly cared greatest about you (in a relationship), then NO you shouldn't still be friends with him.<br>  <br>  You can't allow someone to hurt you and just act like everything is okay.|`|ijb2Z857aa	No one can tell you if you should be friends with him, the only one who can is you.  First you have to decide if hes worth it.  If hes not, trust me hes not worth the heartache for nothing.  You can always try to talk to him about the relationship because by the way your talking it seems like the fact that it even happened is being avoided.  I know how you feel i went through something very similar so if u want to talk you can always email me, ill try to help

Ho uno sperticato amore per tutto quello che 'e'  del Bel paese. Coltivo la lingua, la storia ecc. Ho imparato piu'  all'estero del mio paese che in patria. Da moltissimi anni abito in Argentina, sposato, un figlio, una figlia, entrambi laureati, una bella casa un discreto lavoro in proprio, una moglie giovane, argentina.  Ho avuto tempi duri, durissimi, ma poi, come l'ave fenice sono risorto dalle mie ceneri., oggigiorno, contento e felice, anzi convinto che in Italia mi sarebbe andata peggio.

p6horEv8aa	dont just tell her shes pretty. tell her how good she is at things and make little comments like, "you look really beautiful/cute when you do (fill in the blank)" truth is she probably only says it isnt true that shes pretty because she like to have it told to her a bunch of times. shes probably really flattered when you tell her that. or shes trying to be modest.|`|c29f0865b05f0dde29587dd12d56481daa	make her really feel it be a gentleman|`|5VABbYIAaa	lol I do the same thing to my bf.

vZj1LH16aa	I can see the problem you with with your daughter is trust. <br>  It will take a while to rebuild that relationship.<br>  So my best advice for you is just be there for her, keep support her with your best ability. You don't have to let her notice of what you done or doing for her. She will eventually find out by herself and she will start talk to you again. It just take time... Good luck.|`|0c2c813d10c0459938c185589f6abcfcaa	Your daughter probably gets more attention for living in the past....destructive as that may be because society loves drama.  Hopefully she'll become bored with the victim act one day and things will get better but for now don't go on the trip she's attempting to send you on over something that occured how many years ago?  If you were parenting it's not her place or anyone elses.  Your the mom and she's the daughter....it never changes so keep being mom and possibly in the future everyone else, starting with your daughter,  will attend to their own roles in the family and society.|`|27NwYtkuaa	The first sentence by saying your daughter was the one that messed up shows what her problem is. Let her accuse you of everything she wants, let her get it out of her system, listen to her tirade without judgment and then you will be able to get more of an insight into your daughters head and understand her. If she says some things are your fault, then believe her that she thinks it's your fault and accept it. Call your daughter up and tell her you want to see her and then tell her to let it out, how she thinks you are cruel and anything else she has to say, if she says something you don't agree with, DONT INTERRUPT no matter how much you want to, let her say it all and don't try to make excuses about it, just say you are sorry and that you ask for forgiveness, when she is finished don't say "Have you finished?" just wait for her to stop. The only way she will be willing to have a relationship with you, is if she forgives you, and the only way she can forgive you is if you accept whatever she has to say to you, because it's from her perspective. Good Luck|`|1f1a260890eeea96d41ef9e0c7885d8aaa	have a quiet time with her. start a new life. ask her to clear off everything in her mind. meditation will do the trick.|`|I05WnOPiaa	sometimes i could have the similar situation with my mom.but actually,i could understand she did what she had done just to protect me,make me much more better than before though i sometimes even didn't say a word to her.<br>  so guess your daughter know you love her,but just didn't have the chance to express her love to you<br>  don't be that sad,things will be better if you try to find somechance to make it possible for her to say love to you

Sono tutti dubbi di una ragazza dell'età di 19 anni ma anche un ragazzo di 20-21 anni. Tieni duro e se sei sicuro di stare bene con lei dimostrale di capirla e di starle vicino per questo momento di confusione. Non stressarla più del dovuto.

1ed6375beb5e8d962bce480e6040bc0caa	The perfect size is the size each individual is at a any one time.  Perfect is adjective. so if you are happy with your body then you are perfect.  Penises are only good for two things in life.  Urinating and injecting sperm into the womb of a woman.  It is how the man uses his penis that counts.  Size of the penis doesn't matter while urinating.  Nature has made the penis to grow three times it at easy state.  So normal size is just that.  Normal at any size.   Women's Vagina's are only so deep anyway.  The size has nothing to do with impregnating women.  The skill of love making to a woman is the important part, not the size, if you want to be asked back for a second round.|`|3eb1ed4de78c058e5a9a619e837cac50aa	Didnt your mom ever tell you that there is no such thing as perfect?

xlvnryb3aa	sounds like the lines of comunication are beginning to break down and though your trying really hard, it sounds like he's either not listening or not paying attention to your needs...your going to have to ask yourself and him if he's still interested if the answer is yes then you can go from there but if the answer is no then start shopping around because he already is... now when you went to the park, he was being an *** why did he want s** and you were trying to be proper... to some guys having s** in the park is great and adventurous. most guys want to cut to the chase and go sraight to the s**and your looking for a guy who gives you all the romantic little trimmings,and he's just not the type. you need to rebuild the lines of communications with him, or start shopping. because after five years you already know  both your likes and dislikes....and suggesting some place to go for a date really is not going to change anything..time to take your relationship to a higher level or move on and either choice won't be easy...|`|PRGdMw2Uaa	I'd say...go to a batting cage or go drive around some FAST go karts.

He doesn't care about a romantic fun "date".  He just wants to connect to you - and mostly for guys, the easiest way is physical.  Perhaps if you want to stay away from *** straight away, offer a back rub for all of his hard work and studying.  Ask him to reciprocate (he'll feel useful and appreciated if you are grateful), Bring home a fun recipe that you can cook together, or let him drink a beer while he watches you cook, hanging out in the kitchen.  Sports games, fun dates, take the attention away from the "us" aspect of a couple.  If you really have the space - try to enjoy the time alone and try not to talk every minute (us women tend to do that - see, even here I'm runnin' off at the mouth).  Good luck, i hope it's a wonderful reunion.|`|AA10823074	Well, first off, he should appreciate the effort and thought that you took about going to the park rather then complaining the whole time.What I suggest is maybe go out for dinner at a fancy restaurant, or go to a theme park or maybe some major attraction in your area.

When you are older you will remember the hurtful things you said to her and will realize you were being a brat.<br>  Ask yourself if you said those things to be hurtful or if you meant it. If you were trying to be hurtful because you were angry, I suggest you apologize to her and tell her that you didn't mean what you said and that you only said it because you were angry. Let her know that you really do want to be with her. Then do something nice for her because you were being a brat.

The critical thing is to be there for her and just tell her, "I care."<br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|QXZxpqDNaa	Best friend relation is like a hand and tears.... i can understand even you felt bad but please don't worsen your friends situtaion becoz cure her thoughts by being optimistic don't dump her in flirting around,tell her to concentrate on her career believe me the boy who left her today will come back in her life and she will not accept him.Make her life by guiding her the rite path....not running behind the things which taught her a lesson to be strong and bold.She should thank God for wat she learned today......,he lost something not your friend tell her to make a mark not to be lost in maze.

She is smart, responsible, and doesn't stab people in the back. She asks me if I get in trouble for I.M'ing too late, and she speaks highly of good people. She doesn't spread rumors, or gossip. Also, she isn't hot or ugly, and I really don't care, because I like her for who she is, and not how much friends, or money her family has. Also, we have strong trust in eachother. Like, I can tell her anything, and she can tell me anything. <br>  <br>  Thats what you would want.

FzRCJAoDaa	i would say no to this question, but it might be possible.<br>  <br>  In my book it goes like this<br>  <br>  you can lust someone without loving them<br>  <br>  when you love someone you lust them, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY you also love them.|`|25fbc8af3ff6170192fe178347d6330caa	Not for me. If I'm not sexually attracted to a woman, I'm not into her as a GF.

It's a powerful emotion, and takes over the mind when it is true.|`|ixKIPFAnaa	Isn't this  a relationship with your mom?
ReiCAIqDaa	I would say it is one of more of the following:-<br>  <br>  1.  She finds you qute attractive that is why she touches you (for starters on the cheek) LOL;<br>  2.  She want to make friend / connection;<br>  3. If she touch your cheek there is interest;<br>  4. You are cute and loveable;<br>  5. You have nosy cheeks;<br>  6. Next time a girl touch your cheek, take her phone number that could be the beginning of a lot of touching.<br>  Good Luck with the touching and phone numbers. Do you need a secretary.  Sadly I will not be able to make it, too far South Africa, much to far.<br>  Take Care<br>  S of SA|`|E24UcVkraa	Means you excite her a lot............|`|MEuUwcThaa	sometimes people do that to say,"awww!! he's so cute!!" maybe that was why??|`|yJXh1KkVaa	LMAO! That's so funny. <br>  Haha, I'm sure your not chubby. xDDDD <br>  Ok. Well I do that to my friends all the time. <br>  It's basically being random, when you have nothing else to do. Or using flattery saying like..."Awh, you are soooo cute, Yes YOU are!" "Give your granny some looove." Hahahaha!<br>  Or...if you got some baby fat....xD on your cheeks...that's not being fat though. So if you got cheeks, then that's something to pinch about.|`|hC6HT5lSaa	I think from experience, she just finds u cute and adorable.|`|UDEhf6ATaa	try it out on someone else! somehow its extreme fun to pinch cheeks, especially if they're squishy. :)<br>  and it depends, is she a friend or not? <br>  i guess she likes u, and also u must have pretty nice cheeks ;)|`|bb5bd75bc4dd53fbed4f3c74cb17af1aaa	Thats usually something someone does because the person is adorable...or cute.  Theres a baby girl that I babysit  during the week, and I grab her cheek sometimes because shes just so cute and you just wanna gobble her up lol.   My grandmother also used to pinch my cheek when I was a small girl.... so its just a gesture made usually when someone finds another person adorable or cute in some way.
jKFqgtcdaa	ok how are you suppose to know if she likes you unless you ask her out HELLO thats what people do when they like someone|`|EjzRDZz7aa	Next time you see her, give her your number also.  Invite her one more time, if she is still busy and doesn't offer an alternative date, move on.  It means that she probally isn't intrested.|`|5004a7df58a4be017a4cc7ad1ac4876eaa	Ask her out already.  You have to if you ever want to know if you will or will not go, right?  She likes you.  ASK her!!!!  Good Luck.  But I doubt you need it.  Have fun on your date:)|`|AYLnEOnVaa	just ask her!!! don't b a chicken!!! i asked a guy out once and he said that he just wanted 2 b friends 4 a while, and maybe once he got 2 kno me a little better he would then consider it. just shoot for it and hope 4 the best!! good luck|`|HFQfSpgDaa	well if i were you i would definitely try to get to know hr better hang out with her at the gym maybe go for something to eat after that and then from there try to see if she's getting your signals if not then just politely ask her out|`|Xc5bZezzaa	She only likes you as a friend. <br>  Did she say she was busy and couldn't talk or that she'd call you back later? If it was the latter, did she call you back later.<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like she only likes you as a friend because even if her family was in town, she'd still have taken the time to talk to you a bit.<br>  <br>  If I liked someone and they called me during Christmas break or something when I was with my family, I'd still be polite but I'd get in as much polite talking time with you as possible.
pABXrYNqaa	She's using you|`|EjzRDZz7aa	Get out there and meet people.  I'm sorry it didn't work out with your old friend.  Best way to do it is be brave and introduce yourself, or do things that intrest you, and you will naturally meet people w/the same intrests.  Find some new friends, and forget her.|`|AA11831666	you may be trying to hard. <br>  find out what she is interested in and make it known that your not trying to push up  on her you only wont to be her Friend if that would be OK. see if you can get her to introduce you to her bf. that will make it easier to be friends. The next time you see her face to face put it out there and see where it goes.<br>  It sound to me like your a great person that is just reaching out to others. Remember to be a friend to your self first. by that is what ever you would do for someone you loved with all of your heart do it for you. you will start to see how people start to notice you. confidence is key.|`|L7cUCyF1aa	not nessacerily|`|OvUaAARfaa	forget her. you'll live|`|a1a84f087a8a359fb97522ecc40c750caa	GET RID OF HER I HAVE FEW FRIENDS 2 I LIVE THOUGH! its ok

Ma tu ci scherzi e giochi mai con loro? Comincia con il fare l'amicona, si divertente, brillante, fai qualche battuta e vedrai che penseranno "wow questa è una ragazza capace di divertirsi e farmi divertire". lasciarsi andare non significa diventare delle zoccole ma semplicemente essere spigliate e solari senza troppi drammi...|`|d4NRXP4Iaa	Io ho il tuo stesso identico problema,...penso che forse i ragazzi non ti cerchino non per l'aspetto fisico (perchè pure quelle brutte sono fidanzate) ma per il carattere o il modo di fare che hai...sai, anche io non parlo molto.

Probabilmente, anche se questa è l'ultima cosa che vorresti sentirti dire, il suo amore si sta trasformando in affetto e a meno che non stiate insieme da tantissimo questo non è un buon segno. Forse c'è rimmedio, analizza la vostra stroria e individua ciò che tu facevi prima, quando lei ti amava "molto", e pensa se ora hai gli stessi atteggiamenti nei suoi confronti. Se trovi qualcosa di cambiato nel tuo comportamento potresti impegnarti ad avere nei suoi confronti le stesse attenzioni che avevi una volta. In genere le donne si lamentano di questo. Se invece trovi cambiata solo lei probabilmente non puoi porre rimmedio da solo.|`|b536c8e14ed51cfe62ac9ab8ee215f46aa	Mollala prima tu: c'è qualcun'altro.|`|po5rZYaHaa	Prenditi una pausa digli che sta cosa ti ha gelato e hai bisogno di un po' di tempo,cosi' anche lei capira' cio' che prova,magari e' solo passata la fase di innamoamento e un po' di lontananza le chiarira' le idee.

Bhe, secondo me chi pensa ancora che sfornare figli sia il più grande desiderio delle donne è restato al medioevo. Perchè se fosse così non ci sarebbero persone che la pensano come noi.

nSxwBvZjaa	Es hat was mit Psychologie ( besser Sexuologie) zu tun.<br>  M?nner reagieren auf einen direkten Mix von optischen und inneren Reizen(Vorstellungen), Frauen sind emotional veranlagt.<br>  M?nner m?gen Sex wegen des Sex an sich, Frauen brauchen fast immer eine emotionale Komponente.<br>  Dazu kommt, das zeitlich gesehen die Lust auf Sex bei Mann und Frau oft zu unterschiedlichen Zeiten vorhanden ist.<br>  Viele Frauen sind auch nicht in der Lage, mit Ihren M?nnern über sexuelle Phantasien zu reden...also zum Beispiel über unerfüllte Wünsche....Frauen die das k?nnen und auch bereit sind, mit den M?nnern darüber zu reden haben zwar nicht unbedingt ein erfüllteres Sexualleben, aber zumindest eine harmonischere Beziehung. Manche Frauen m?gen auch nicht ihre M?nner zu fordern...also klar zu sagen was sie wollen.....das ist das n?chste Problem.<br>  So manche Beziehung ist daran gescheitert, dass Frauen pl?tzlich feststellten, dass Ihre M?nner z.B. eine dominante oder devote Ader haben und eine andere Frau dies erkannt und ausgenutzt hat.<br>  In den Filmen k?nnen m?nner diese Sehnsüchte und Triebe erleben und abbauen und die Beziehung bleibt intakt.<br>  Ist also etwas v?llig normales!!!|`|380d2f16f9a996ffe2e09cfee51a938faa	Pornos sind geil, laughing to myself|`|aa7f13a7c957f21e8c19de85d63c5ae9aa	Die Generationen der Vorv?ter haben sich an "frivolen" Schriften und Bildern hochgezogen.

I appreciate the way she opened up for me in that way and also the way she opened her heart and how she now trusts me and my decisions. The solid commitment can also feel like opening up in a way as well. In my case, I want to marry the girly someday and she feels the same about me, with that kind of commitment you aren't afraid to do anything or go anywhere with the person. It's like you opened up your life. Maybe you are a lot more shy than you might think or maybe you inadvertantly push people away. pay attention to your actions and imagine what you would do if you were trying to approach yourself and you acted in that way.

Tù no puedes cambiar la forma de ser de èl, pero si puedes tomar la decisiòn sobre còmo vas a actuar tù al respecto. Pero sobre todo, debes tomar conciencia de tu propia responsabilidad en todo esto. Del ejemplo que quieres dar  a tus hijas sobre como debe ser la relaciòn con una pareja, aunque ellas son peque?as, esto que ellas estàn viviendo en este momento es algo que va a quedar grabado en lo màs profundo de su ser y de ti depende ense?arles a ser personas dignas, que se amen a sì mismas. Es un proceso muy difìcil porque est`s involucrada hace mucho en una relaciòn muy destructiva en la que no se te reconoce y no se te da un valor como ser humano, pero todo esto ha sido permitido por ti y lo màs importante en este momento es que comiences a reconocer esa parte en la que tù permites estas situaciones para que puedas empezar tu a modificar esas conductas. No puedes cambiar a nadie, pero puedes cambiar tù. Puedes vivir esta situaciòn como la victima y seguir permitiendo que te utilicen o puedes tomar la determinaciòn de tomar las riendas de tu propia vida y salir adelante. Hay un libro que te puede ayudar se llama: "Conversaciones con Dios", el libro 1 de Neal Donald Walsh. Todo esto te lo digo porque pasè por una situaciòn muy similar. Despuès de una relaciòn de 7 a?os y al enterarse de que yo estaba embarazada, el papà de mi hijo decidiò dejarme cuando yo tenìa un embarazo de 2 meses. Sè bien por lo que estàs pasando, pero tambièn sè que reconocer tu responsabilidad al respecto te harà ver las cosas de diferente manera. Este libro llegò a mis manos en el momento en que màs lo necesitaba, me sentìa una vìctima de las circunstancias y de la maldad de un hombre, pero solo era vìctima de mi misma y eso si lo podìa cambiar. Este libro me "ocurriò" a mi y te "ocurrirà" a ti, si lo lees y et ayudarà a reconocer tu responsabilidad y lo que sì puedes hacer... suerte!!! y ya veràs: "esto tambièn pasarà"|`|NIxcsWU3aa	de donde eres?|`|a66f404892a9464d1d3d450c2229daefaa	Antes que nada debes tranquilizarte y pensar en tus hijos, si ya habías pasado por esta situación desafortunadamente (y me da pena decirtelo) pero si ya lo habías perdonado sabias a lo que te arriesgabas, debes de poner las cosas en una balanza y valorar si tienes una buena estabilidad a lado de tu esposo, me refiero a que si es responsable, trabajador, se preocupa por tus hijos etc.; Creo que en esta vida no hay un hombre fiel, esa es la verdad; lo cual no significa que le aplaudas su infidelidad, pero si piensas; crees o sientes que va a dejar de hacerlo; estas aquivocada. Soy mujer y te entiendo perfectamente, nosotras siempre llevamos las de perder en estas situaciones, pero como te dije debes valorar si te CONVIENE seguir con el en cuanto a la estabilidad economica de tus hijos, por que cuando ya se viven situaciones como estas y lo perdonas te la va hacer cuantas veces quiera.<br>  unicamente aclarale que tiene derecho de hacer lo que quiera así como tú puedes hacerlo pero nadamas que no te enteres, para que no se haga cínico si es que piensas volver con el.<br>  <br>  Si definitivamente no te conviene como hombre en todos los aspectos; deja de llorar y preocupate por tus hijos y el nuevo bebé que llevas dentro, ya que llorando no podemos solucionar nada, y menos demostrarle a él que te esta dando en toda la torre; al contrario; debes demostrarle quien eres y que en su put... vida se va a encontrar una mujer y una madre como tú.<br>  <br>  Suerte y no te preocupes que Dios núnca te abandona,.|`|qYmBxeqgaa	Primero que nada tienes que tranquilizarte y no deprimirte tanto por el bien de tu bebe, estas muy joven y tienes que ser más madura por los hijos que tienes. Debes de buscar una fuente de ingresos para que no te sientas atada a el y tu seas autosuficiente, porque tienes unos hijos a quien cuidar. Si tu marido fue infiel una vez, lo será siempre, es la naturaleza de los hombres, donde ven una oportunidad la aprovechan y no quiere decir que no te quieran, sino ellos son así. Entonces, como ves no debes deprimirte, debes actuar de inmediato. Ponle un hasta aqui, es decir, dile que o esta contigo o no, porque lo vas a dejar, que lo necesitas como pareja, pero si no tienes su apoyo tendrás que salir adelante tu sola. En méxico las mujeres somos muy autosuficientes, podemos ser padres y madres al mismo tiempo, todas podemos, económicamente no necesitamos a los hombres. Cualquiera que sea tu situación económica, no permitas que en un futuro o a lo  mejor ya lo tienes, te transmita sexualmente una enfermedad  que no te permita ver por ti y por tus hijos. Tu vales mucho más que cualquier hombre. Si es necesario divorciarte hazlo, el no te merece, si no es necesrio, habla y exigele que te respete y cuidalo mas, no lo dejes tanto tiempo solo. Acuerdate que hasta el más honrado peca si tiene una buena oportunidad. Suerte. Si necesitas ayuda jurídica en México, estoy a tus ordenes. tinzam@hotmail.com

Tantas veces son las que la mujer trata, se esmera, y hasta te diría que presiona al hombre ha hacer que surja en él, lo que ellas necesitan, que terminan forzando lo que no es real. he conocido muchos casos, y fijate que hombre termina siendo el mas débil, no todo lo que muestra el hombre es como ustedes lo interpretan. Si quieres saber lo que siente un hombre, no lo presiones y lo mas seguro es que termine mostrándote su verdadero sentimiento o personalidad. Por ultimo siempre me acuerdo de un dicho popular y que para mi es cierto "detrás de un buen hombre, existe una gran mujer", puede ser también al revés.|`|CfAAxHbBaa	porque ellos tardan en crecer y poder ver que ellos en realidad de lo que hacen es ganar perdiendo en su forma de ser...y no darse cuenta<br>  temen a equivocarse en los sentimientos que desean o que los rechacen<br>  tienen que saber que eligen|`|FVu34kupaa	Soy varón y debo decirte que si bien es cierto que una gran mayoría de hombres son insensibles, tambien existimos aquellos que aprendimos a ser fuertes sin necesidad de suprimir emociones. Creo que el problema radica en el tipo de educacion que los hombres recibimos, es decir, si el padre o la madre formaron al hijo para ser afectivo o no. Socialmente (por un mero acuerdo social subyacente) el hombre es "entrenado" para ser fuerte. Sin embargo, ser fuerte es muy diferente de estar emocionalmente constipado. Compartir emociones profundas en una habilidad poco comun en los hombres y, desgraciadamente, esto deriva del tipo de educacion que -normalmente- la madre provee. <br>  Solo quien puede conocerse a si mismo, (y esto implica la necesidad de examinar la propia conciencia), puede conocer el alcance de sus fortalezas y debilidades, y solo quien conoce estas, puede conocer y exponer a ot5ros sus verdaderas emociones. En resumidas cuentas, quien no teme ser descubirto y examinado, puede compartir sus sentimientos confiadamente a la pareja. Pero esto, reitero, es una habilidad rara en loos hombres.|`|oXFbcZ2Saa	mira amiguis no es que seamos tan insensibles  lo que pasa es que muchos hombres nos acoplamos a una forma de expresarnos con las mujeres de una manera especial, otros han pasado por varias humillaciones y por lo tanto no demuestran lo que sienten  pero  aun asi  tienen sentimientos, otros  no lo demuestran por que realmente no lo sienten pero eso no quiere decir que no tengamos sentimientos pues si no somos objetos tenemos vida y corazon  para sentir lo mismo puede pasar con las mujeres y no creo que yo este mintiendo|`|oYKdGyWQaa	mi amiga habrán muchos hombres como los que tu dises y a ti desafortunadamente te toco , pero hay muchos hombres comprencibos ,sentimentales amorosos, que te llenan de su amor y atención.|`|otiZVlmFaa	porque ?les dirian gays o noo??<br>  los hombres compiten entee ellos comonosotras las mujeres por vernos mas guapas entre amigas!!<br>  ellosw de quien es el mas macho les sube el autoestima.<br>  sin embargo no todos los hombres on iguales. hay mucho que tambien tienen sentimiento pero lo demuestran mas. cada hombre tiene su forma de expresar sus sentimientos.|`|p32OIqW5aa	lo k pasa es k tienen miedo a caer a verse mal, a k no sean los fuertes que el mundo cree, o talvez a k les rompan el corazon?...|`|vLd6sqclaa	porq ellos no maduran tan rapido como nosotras!

Amiga... Adris... Bueno, no es muy alentador, pero recuerda que "El que en pan piensa es porque hambre tiene o porque es panadero"<br>  Bueno, Los hombres por naturaleza suelen ser posesivos y sobreprotectores, lo que explica la tendencia a ser celoso... Considera que si eres su novia eres de su propiedad, aunque nunca lo exprese de esa manera ni con esas palabras, y su egoismo no le permitir?a compartirte con nadie, y eso lo hace capás de celarte hasta de tus papás.<br>  Pero el otro ladode la moneda masculina es la vanidad y la necesidad de concervar las apariencias. Las mujeres son más expresivas y suelen mostrar más sus sentimientos, incluyendo los celos. Entonces cuando un hombre se vé víctima de sus propios sentimientos y no los puede ocultar o evitar expresarlos, lo considera un acto femenino, por lo que tiende a negarlo. Todo para Guardar su apariencia de que es muy hombre.<br>  En cuanto a lo de que no sea compartido (eso de no dejarte ver su telefono), es parte de su egoísmo natural. Sin embargo allí es donde entra la parábola del Pan, que significa, que sumando todas las situaciones, puede que te cele y que te supervise porque él sí tiene algo que ocultar.

The problem is, they still have each other and they are going on with their lives and tho they miss you, it is not as all-consuming as the loneliness you feel for them.  Therefore, since you are in this new State and have little chance to socialize with your old friends, the healthy thing for you to do is to make yourself open to making new friends.  With your friendship record, you should not have any problem making friends.  Remember, you're not being disloyal to your older friends by making new ones.  Don't rush into friendships, however.  It is tempting if you are lonely.  Do the things you like to do and you will meet friends with similar interests that way.

Seeing as how your 15 you have a good chance of finding one to do it pro-bono (free) but here's the catch in order to be emancipated your gonna have to have a good reason and the ability to care for yourself or your gonna have to terminate your mother's rights, either way this is hard and is gonna suck and possibly damage any relationship with your mother because you are gonna have to prove to a judge that she is a bad mother. You need to decide if you can do this to her and for sure that the lady at church wants you in that way. She may not be willing to support you through this hard ordeal and then to raise you like a child. You need to talk with her as well.

Its tough to be in a spot like you at your age.<br>  <br>  However, have you at any time checked if your Mom is going through a bad patch herself ? many a times it is human to react to your immediate surroundings with a vengeance just because you feel that life is not treating you fair & just. There maybe just that chance to relate with her on a one to one term and help each other with problems faced. I 've known many a relationship suddenly bloom into happier ones with knowledge that the other person cares.<br>  <br>  it is quite allright to feel close to someone who seems to care about you and make you feel wanted but, one needs to very minutely scrutinise the other persons motive for doing so. It pays to be careful these days. if after the scrutiny the relationship still comes out good, no harm in continuing the same. <br>  <br>  All said and done, always remember when you point a finger at someone the rest of your fingers point to you. Always listen to your heart and don't get guided by emotions alone.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you try to get closer to God and the Good Lord will lead you in the right path always. There is no friend like him to lift your spirits when you feel lost and in despair.<br>  <br>  Wishing you the best life could offer<br>  <br>  Friend in Need
qH6CIcswaa	my g/f has that same friend. bu ask yourself this why did i pick my g/f over her annoying uncreaive friend. its because the one that doesnt intially stand out is the one that is more interesting and has beter things to do than to copy her friend.|`|kFekaMtYaa	just tell her that she copies u too much and that she should just stop being so stupid and choose her own things! tell her that its too much with the guitar and the card and the songs and earings!!!! its too much! and if not being your friend is the only way then so be it!! or if u want to be her friend still then just say i want to be friends still but just cut down on the copying k?<br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  <br>  good luk!
El9Tga1iaa	Maybe he thought you liked him, but since you never talked to him, he decided to move on with his life. You should ask him out to lunch, and catch up on things. It could turn into something if you keep at it. If you are willing to keep in touch and not let the relationship slip away like two years ago. <br>  <br>  -PeterBliss-
El9Tga1iaa	There is a possibility that he likes you, but you need to talk to him, you can never get into a relationship if you don't talk with the person first. He may just be trying to tease you. You do seem kind of young.

If they are good friend, and especially if already committed, let them hook up with you with someone else. They know your intrerests, so they might be able to find some date for you.<br>  <br>  Also flirt with people you are attracted to mildly. hang out with more girl friends and laugh, this will make you happy, and happy people are more attractive. If you like someone give them an eye contact and smile, they will pick up the cue and talk to you.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|tB94xpOeaa	Be yourself first off. Flirtatious is okay but don't cross the line. And he'll come you just got to be patient.

When the guys you are after turn 19, smile and flirt...case closed|`|UGQMWWKWaa	just go up to them and say random stuff and ask em wat they like and stuff den deyll start talking to you more often|`|UOCthJlIaa	You can't just make someone talk to you, hell it that were the case Halle Berry would be talking guys all over the world.|`|X7pn1mb3aa	If you want anyone to talk to you, then you must talk to them first. What's all this stuff about trying to get someone to talk to you? What makes you think you are all that. People are no different than you, some people are shy and others are not. Sound like to me, you need to grow up a bit. You cannot make anyone talk to you, either the guy is interested or he's not. If he is not be happy that he is not in your life.|`|fziw1cgiaa	Well, if you already have guy friends, you are off to a good start.  Maybe you aren't interested in them, but maybe they have cute friends!  They could probably also give you advice.  Just be open and friendly when meeting a new guy and don't be too uptight!<br>  A smile goes a long way!|`|sCQWZ307aa	Well Just be yourself. Every female has beauty and the right guy will notice you and come along. Let love find you.|`|wcxS3OJmaa	Well someone asked the same exact question four days ago I am going to tell you a little something....Everyone is looking at someone some guy looks at you and he thinks your attractive and that means you just need to find him and smile he will most likely come up to you and start talking to you...I mean the girl I helped out with this question is now dating someone.She really likes him and he likes her.

Don't even think about the 'somewhere else' until you are ready to give up your childhood for a child of your own.  Read some books on the topic if you really want make-out advice.  (No sex)  Try reading Cosmo.  (Get your sister or a female friend to get it for you if you are embarrassed.)|`|FQXfM7gQaa	Use your tongue slowly across her lips...<br>  <br>  kiss away from her lips to her ears...<br>  <br>  use your arms around her back....<br>  <br>  take a break from the makeout, stay at nose-to-nose, open your eyes and just stare into her eyes...|`|KMjPljozaa	YOUR ONLY 16 KISSING IS MORE THAN ENOUGH!!!|`|dul01c8oaa	If this is a steady girlfriend then you should be able to sit down with her and ask her if she wants you to go further. If you try and push her further and she doesn't want to you'll lose her.
7dfd89acf5920eae59850eaa303089ffaa	go talk to her|`|vZj1LH16aa	Walk up to her and introduce yourself to her. And ask Can we become friends.... Life is simple, take one step at a time.|`|yAr36wOCaa	go talk to her, and get to know her better. Ask her if she's interested.|`|42DJalemaa	talk to her and get to know her for a little while and see how she reacts to you. If you think all is well, go ahead and ask her out.|`|O8BbYKHvaa	well try talking to her for a while get to know her for a while and if you guys come close ask her out but dont just ask her out you should get to know her first to see how it will go|`|rK1gmydWaa	go and introduce your self just don't rush it
vZj1LH16aa	Dude move on... If both of you know there is no chance getting back together. You need to face it that this relationship is over. Don't waste your time and money to get back with someone that doens't love you anymore. Beside there isnt just ONE fish in the ocean. <br>  Good luck
vZj1LH16aa	Back when I was in a relationship, I use to be like you. I always think its a bad idea for my girlfriend to know nice guy friends because they normally go for her as to date her.  But honestly, you cannot stop them. <br>  For my own opinion for you my friend, I think you should let her have freedom to meet new guy friend. BUT when its time for them to go hang out and stuff like that,  You should go with her specially on the first time. You have to show her guy friend that she is taken by you. <br>  And if your girlfriend think that is too much, then simply tell her  not to go... You can also say " I trust you, but I don't trust your friend".<br>  Good luck my friend, If you need more advice email me. = )|`|MeEJWMDpaa	A look, check this out, you are not married to her and you don't need  to  think about what guys do, because if she is attractive, then guys is gone to try to hit on her anyway. I'm gone put it this way, you don't trust her so she need to leave your jealous a.. alone. Stop thinking about what you are trying to start, she wants to meet new friends, I'm pretty sure that if she loves you, then her new friends will have to deal with that. If she don't stop you from making new friends, then why stop her. I bet you wouldn't say nothing if she bring a bunch of girls to your house to hang out.|`|ff7b84755b1702d0bc2cd565c763c440aa	It's a matter of trust. Do you trust her enough not to cheat? Yeah, some guys are just out to get into a girl's pants, but I'd hope you trust your girlfriend's judgement enough to figure that out, and also that you trust her to say no if a guy makes moves on her. <br>  <br>  I know my boyfriend has absolutely no issue with me having male friends, both new and old ones, because he trusts me completely.
GnZgUMDdaa	Well you have to look at it from his view.  He is a guy.  Guys aren't into texting as much as us girls are.  And they also are not into talking on the phone as much as we are.  If he's your boyfriend you should know this about him already.  Maybe you're just thinking a little too much into an unimportant aspect of your relationship??|`|AA10034577	Maybe he doesn't have a texting plan. Those things get expensive.|`|rRtDfcfxaa	maybe hes avoiding u....|`|2UGbxKDbaa	well one day call him regulary and then if he doestn answer prank and cuss his *** out!!!!|`|904d324c71d2feb054129499495f4c48aa	dump him he not worth it if he does not think you worth texting then find someone who does|`|vZj1LH16aa	I think he have something eles going on behind your back..<br>  <br>  Maybe should have  a talk with him about your concern... <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|Asr2L0Ktaa	Tell him you don't have time for his games....you really don't. You don't deserve it either. You deserve a bf that will give you all his time and it won't matter at all. He is being selfish, as are most guys. You need to find someone who is worth your time.
oUKyZ9oAaa	love and attraction are funny emotions. this is very common, however if you were serious, and your friend knew, just walk away from the friendship, and i say this only because she cant be that good of a friend if she is purposely doing this. good luck|`|7a60b5fd43183f696a47e589fef5e146aa	If your friend is a liar, just stop hanging out with her.|`|47cfe75a8340b688519f0435fbf413a4aa	So what if you both like the same guy? Neither of you are dating him and neither of you own him. It is not worth losing a friend over jealousy for a guy who does not belong to either of you. If she's telling you she will be seeing him tonight (not exactly a date since they're in a group) then she's being upfront and honest. You're the one trying to hide your feelings. <br>  <br>  If you want this guy, get his attention and start talking to him. It's up to him to decide which one of you he wants to start dating, if he wants to date either of you at all. When you next see your friend, if you value your friendship, then treat her like a friend. And start being honest about your feelings. Do NOT put winning this guy over as a deal-breaker for your friendship. It would be completely different if one of you was already dating him or if he was your ex. But from what you've said, it appears that he's just someone you both know. In which case, there is no issue at all. You've created one out of insecurity. Don't let it ruin your friendship.|`|Sq2leWmeaa	She doesn't seem like someone you want to be friends with...<br>  <br>  Just ignore her.|`|UXEA30J7aa	Maybe she isn't sure of how you feel at all, you're hiding your feelings so either she doesn't know or thinks you changed your mind. Just have a calm discussion with her and find out what's the root of both of your problems. Don't get caught up in the drama of it, just be frank, open and gentle with each other.<br>  <br>  The next time you see her, ask to see her alone so you can discuss this matter in private, nobody likes to see an argument in the lunch room.|`|vZj1LH16aa	Human do change, so just be yourself. Its part of our growth.|`|rta1nZ2daa	I think that you should be honest with your friend bout how you feel.<br>  1. Feelings toward your crush<br>  2. Feelings toward her<br>  <br>  Next, if she doesn't be honest with you then i think that's it's best if you part your ways and find a new friend. I know it's hard to do so but wouldn't you rather have a friend who would be honest with you and share whatever feelings in her heart than have a friend who wouldn't be honest with you and flunk over your crush in front of you on purpose. Bout the crush, don't worry as there are lots more guys out there who are right for you. You juz gotta be patient and juz wait for the right moment and it'll come. Another way is this, get ANOTHER guy in your life......
AMI4Fqrpaa	hey sweety your a female!<br>  we all feel like that from time to time (some women just choose to express it more)...<br>  you say your not young so i say do it! (as long as you dont wanna be the presedent or something) just stay safe and dont hurt anyone... you'll figure it out in due time. its ok to be confused from time to time...|`|FdclIdzlaa	you will grow out of that. you just want to try things you havent done. but dont do it try and forget it|`|QyKVxpFCaa	you don't have a model in your life, a good one or a bad one.<br>  just look at people around you , you will find someone , a special one will beyour model, but also you should increase this feeling and work hard to achieve to be like your model|`|9624d1b569ca710536d56a309ae51f7aaa	sounds like you have too much time on your hands. Our minds tend to wander and can get easily caught up in dreaming and fantasy.<br>  You will be okay, we all have crazy thoughts sometimes.. that's normal, just do not act on them.<br>  Get a hobby, a good book, get up and go outside. Find something you enjoy that stimulates your mind.

HIkkfntkaa	Kissing is awesome, but you have to take your time. Once you start kissing you won't be able to stop so you'll have plenty of practice.

ESEF3BL1aa	There is never anything wrong with keeping lines of communication open, especially if she is someone you truely care about.  However, please don't hang your hopes on the chance she might come back to you.  Go out, experience life, what if you missed an incredible opportunity in the meantime?  But to the point, I think if you can stay friends with anyone you have in your life, you're lucky.|`|zKaXW3x9aa	grow up, shes been with other men shes not interested in you .|`|b346cd49a54ca4cea341fbad877d5f1daa	i was going out with this huy and like a week later i broke up with him and he was disgonesed with cancer i felt so bad i tried staying friends with him but i couldnt because i felt so bad but i just didnt have any feelings for him anymore and i still feel bad to this very day i stayed friends with best friends thought|`|fc4234471bfb50ecdb9636b09c9956c8aa	Here is my thoughts on true love  even when time bears down on both of you and creates a rift whether it be in intelligence or differences of ideals what ever the reason even if your spit is accompanied by great hostility for what ever reason time smooths the edges of all sharp words actions and deeds.I will if i truly loved her will always have a special place set aside in my heart and memories for that woman she is forever in bedded in your thoughts and affections even if you've found another to love she will not dominate your new found love but she has been a special tenant in your heart and will always have a piece of you as you have of her .embedded in your heart it makes you hope there is a place where souls and personalities live on forever so that you can reconcile your foolish reasons for breaking apart.
6Pe2dp7Laa	simple. he probably is nervous around u personally and mite think he sounds stupid or somethin or wont be able 2 think of anything cool or funny 2 say which means he wants 2 impress u and probably does like u. which means hes shy but thats not always bad and the more u 2 talk the more relaxed he will become :)|`|cM8J9nN9aa	He's just really shy, I was like this until I got my first girlfriend, now I am more confident then ever.

OFShnkHCaa	She’s got you lovestoned and I think that she knows. First off, it would help to know where you met her and what usual destination you see her at (workplace, school, etc). This is an important factor as I then can work on the different scenarios that you may encounter with her and how you can interact with her then. Look, it’s all about the confidence. Life is a game. It’s called a confidence game. But what you have with you everytime you glance at her is fear. Now the question is: how do you nail the girl you desire? By installing the fear within her. With all the vital signs you have given me, it is clear to say that this girl is playing hard to get. And this is actually a good thing, because no matter what, girls like the attention even though you may think she is not interested in you. The best thing to do is always be yourself. Ask to see if she wants to go out to lunch or grab a quick bite to eat. Take her out to a movie or help her out with whatever she is currently doing (schooling, work, etc). Give her advice and make her feel special by being there by her side no matter what. For starters, if you wish to be sweet and calm as possible, tell her there is something on her cheek and that you want to get rid of it. She will obviously would like to know what it is, and you pretend to get the imagined dust particle off her face. Her question would be "What is it?" Your reply is: "Beauty" Works like a charm. Also, imagine that you are in need of the time; you approach her and ask for the time. She gives it to you and you say: "Wow, really? That late? Well, one thing's for sure, if beauty were time you'd be eternity." If you do manage to go on a first date with her, I suggest you get her flowers and pull this one on her enclosed as a message within an envelope signed by you: “You should go and stand in front of a mirror and hold up 11 roses, so you would see 12 of the most beautiful things in the world.” It will make her go awwwww. Also, if you wish to show how much you care about her, I suggest you use the following tagline: “If I had a rose for every time I thought of you I'd be walking in a garden forever.” Also, try getting her lingerie as a gift. If you are not ready for that quite yet, just tell her that you simply like her. Believe me; girls go like “Awww, how cute,” when they receive lingerie as a gift.  These of course should be used when you get to know her better. Writing a poem however is definitely a good way to kick it off, believe me. If you get all Shakespearean on her, the better. If you need more advice, feel free to contact me.|`|qtVpxOSmaa	I honestly wouldn't like someone who would make fun of me for doing stuff like that since it is nice.

ml3WGTT4aa	te dire algo, para ir al Cielo se necesita 2 cosas, la primera es dar el evangelio, ?que es el evangelio? es creer que Cristo murio por nosotros y que cuando murio, el perdono todos nuestros pecados ya sean pasado, presente, y futuro. La segunda cosa es amar a tu projimo como a ti mismo, ya que hay 10 mandamientos pero cuando Jesus murio (y perdono nuestros pecados) dio un solo mandamiento el cual es el mas importante: "AMA A TU PROJIMO COMO A TI MISMO". asi que si tu pones en practica esas dos cosas te iras al cielo, x eso yo me imagino que mi vida despues de la muerte seria estar junto a Cristo.|`|AA11574336	me imagina otro tipo de vida solo ue tranquila y sin preocupaciones como en esta! jeje|`|EnmbYbsNaa	pues como una evolución, pero dudo que sea vida, ha de tener otro nombre puesto que ya la vida se trminó a la hora de tu muerte... mas bien yo creo que es mi muerte después de la vida.|`|ObgoyL4paa	con mucha luz y paz|`|65763039d464bd52aa9e549aa80e80e3aa	me la imagino muy oscura y fria, sin movimiento y sin ruidos, una oscura paz.|`|a6b33f54b24f54b73d3f746bd122768aaa	No encontraremos nada porque no hay nada y al estar muertos encima tampoco podremos buscar, puès ya no tendremos inteligencia  ni tampoco vida.<br>  Serà como cuando dormimos y no so?amos.<br>  Sòlo dormiremos eternamente, eso sì no podremos quejarnos de que no descansaremos.<br>  Bye.<br>  Vanesa.|`|Ju4zLXZPaa	La mía....llena de luz y mucha paz.
YF32nWUMaa	forget about him. it doesnt take much to make a 10 minute phone call on break at work or after he gets off.|`|G0iFPNxvaa	FREAKY! That exact exact same thing happend to me.  I dont know about you but you but ill tell you what i did.  I just ignored him, never talked to him, and in doing so broke it off.  Its really weird if a guy is too busy to call you. If he likes you then isnt he thinking about you and would just naturally want to talk to you and then would therefore call you? The anseer is yes he would so...this is harsh but then maybe he doesnt like you as much as he says he does...actions speak a hell of a lot louder than words.The working thing is bullshit, how inconsiderate can you be.  He either has someone on the side and playing you or hes an asshole. Either way dump him!|`|LJe6DyPuaa	how long have u been dating? well tell him he needs to change this cos he is loosing you if he says he is going to call to hang out he should if something at work comes out he have to call you an explain it to you.

XGTNH7tLaa	Be nice! A lot of people come to this forum to ask questions based on what's going on in their life. This is all about people asking a question to get someone else's take or perspective on a particular issue while maintaining anonimity. We as responders know we are not getting both side of the story, however, I think for the most part people respond based on how much information is provided in the questions. A lot of people come to Y/A to have mathematical problems solved, where they can go to find current affairs information and far more information other than what's found in 'Singles and Dating'. The Yahoo disclaimers are available too for all to read advising that the information provided by the users are without any legal ramifications whatsoever. People know what they are getting is not professional advice so they take it for what it's worth. Many people find the forum a fun place to hang out for a good right laugh too. We hope to keep it that way?|`|Sh9vS1Djaa	like honestly... no i dont think people can help when they have zero insight and dont know all th details , plus people asking questions there afraid to know the asnswers too will leave out things that really happened in order to get the responce they wanna hear.

A weight gain of 10 lbs is superficial. A year in jail means the guy did something that landed him in big trouble. But, you think he's hot and after that long in jail I would think he wouldn't care if you gained 25 lbs.  Have a good reunion!  Hope he treats you good.<br>  oops sorry, you wanted a guys perspective.
eNinYq2maa	Exactly that. <br>  Pay attention and see what makes her smile and happy. <br>  It has to be heartfelt and personal.

JhsrugNXaa	To be a good liar you need the world's best memory. I usually find that trips even the best liars up as they forget what they have told you. Another way it to check their body language out. They say on CSI that if someone looks to the left/right, they are lying as that is area of the brain used for invention/creativity.

c64740c814eeb52abef0f0a28bef454aaa	Honestly, I don't get this girl either.

I never gotten the chance to try this, because too just got out of a long term relationship, but try using match.com.

It certainly can't hurt.|`|zCbGwgxRaa	Well my advice to you would be to take time and be by yourself for a while because your probably still in love with her and I think that if you rush into a relationship then everything could go wrong, im sure that you wouldn't want to hurt an innocent person just because you are vulnerable and you feel like you need someone to make you happy|`|gJPlY1ADaa	try the mall, clubs, or parties......you can also try things like facebook or myspace but you have to be careful on internet websites.

It depends on what type of women you are looking for.  I think it is best to meet girls/women at single events, then you know you have something in common.  Look up single events in your area.  You should find something.   Good luck.|`|nWCP91q2aa	dude go to the mall thtats what i do..or a park...movies somewhere where there are alot of people that youc an check out and they can do the same ^_^ best answer..o by the way im a level two so i can liek give everyone thumbs up and it will give you all a point so ^_^ im jsut cool liek that best answer plz?|`|KK718Xxaaa	you can always meet a nice girl in stores sometimes on fishing trips<br>  ummmm.......friends parties  friend's friends that are really cute girls. golf courses movies the fair and simple everyday places like that.\ maybe even on here<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  juggalette 4 life<br>  much love to the juggalo family <br>  jamie madrox and violent j and shaggy 2 dope r hot <br>  i gave it to a juggalo<br>  lol sexiest killa u know <br>  peace. im out. <br>  bloody B|`|McfrauFnaa	there are clubs you can get into if you're not 21. don't you have friends that have parties? oh and another thing, when you meet these chicks? don't come at them like you want a relationship. just get out of a 3 year deal, you just need to get laid bro. just sayin.|`|hEU4SlhTaa	Do you have any friends that could hook you up??|`|NaaMYEPNaa	Go to  a club! you only need to be 18 to go there
cn49BbRiaa	Seem like he wants to have his cake and eat it too.<br>  You bearly find a man who will leave his girlfriend for his woman on the side. Ive been in that situation before and it dosent make any sense.<br>  At first everything will be sweet and you will accept the fact that your just in it for the sex and nottin more. But you will start wanting more of him of his time and you will become jealouse around special occassions when he cant spend them with you. you will feel left out.<br>  Maybe he moved out cause he and his girlfriend are quarreling. You need to be happy too so leave him and find a man of your own.<br>  some men just want a different flavor of women every now and then and your worth much more than that.|`|kfM7ppWpaa	Because to him you are an easy lay.

He will use you for sex, and then find someone else to settle down with. <br>  <br>  Find someone who is actually single, and willing to give you, and only you, his attention.  Stop stealing other people's boyfriends. Kharma will only bite you in the butt later.|`|zQ6bd8Z5aa	The tables aren't turning.  You might want them to - i.e. him chasing you for a change - but that isn't the case.  He's putting forth a bit more effort  for right now so he can continue to play you.  As soon as another girl enters the picture you will be history.  <br>  <br>  You went into this knowing all it was was a booty call relationship.  That's all it will ever be.  He will never be "between" or without women - there will always be two or more and right now you just happen to be one of them, nothing more.<br>  <br>  Grow up and face the facts:  you cannot build a decent relationship based on lies, games and infidelity.  That's all this thing has been from day one.  It's not a relationship other than in your head - and even there it's on pretty rocky ground and you know it.
iS0Vkmfeaa	he might have a comprehension problem. My daughter has comprehension dyslexia and I have to deal with this very problem. Her brain takes longer to hear and understand the question and formulate an answer. Just be understanding. You said you've dealt with this for some time now, so knowing this ask your question and wait. don't get angry be understanding.|`|gV8wcNjjaa	maybe he is frustrated about his environtment and life in general, and doesn't give a f*** about anything, maybe that's why he takes to long to answer cause he seems not to care bout anything.|`|TepKLuP7aa	i have to repeat things to my dad too, but he says he is just thinking of other things.<br>  if your dad is doing something maybe he is very concentrated and can not hear you.<br>  --good luck|`|oIkBRzHoaa	Perhaps he's in another realm?

i5Ey9stBaa	I'm the same way. I'm a guy though and I have trouble with women, I don't know why I self doubt myself but I have low self esteem. If I had to guess, I would guess you have been hurt in the past before that hurt your self esteem. Like someone that you loved or admired made you unhappy, which caused you to lose self esteem.<br>  <br>  I don't really know. My parents never believed in me and So if they don't believe in me, they taught me or never gave me to love myself and have high self esteem of myself. So I never felt good about myself or anything.
cI19nesraa	You might want to check this out with a counselor.  Rebuilding trust with her would be a tall order but this should not be affecting the rest of your life so much.  Is this the first person who ever lied to you? or broke your trust in some way.  You need some help to get back your perspective.|`|82oTjLCAaa	when you come close to smb, do it only if you have many common points.i was also''betrayed''..in important points to say so..and i looked around in that monet to see my friends.and made friends among those who felt like me, had my views from that moment on..
1F6ZnYtXaa	Unfortunatley, misery likes company. Maybe she was feeling jelaous of your new relationship and feelings- maybe that means less focus on her. Either way you have been friends for a long time so I think you should talk to her and find out the real reason why she did that. That is a definate red flag though, because a true friend should always have your best interest at heart.|`|IhIXtf9yaa	tell her how you feel and wht that did you when she did that and see how it goes from there|`|AkaRgUj7aa	SHES BOARD GO HANG OUT WITH HER SHE IS CRYING OUT FOR ATTENENTION
52zR9SHDaa	I think your friend believes that "you know who" is not really interested in girls but is not 100% sure.
MHg9JhEKaa	Well your mutual friend is implying perhaps he thinks this lad is not interested in girls... or perhaps not interested in having a girlfriend.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand maybe the mutual friend likes you? ! and is trying to put you off pursuing this lad. <br>  <br>  You only live once hun, I would ask him out anyway! <br>  <br>  Good luck x
jxdMIAoBaa	I am having the exact same problem as we speak.The only thing i can say is just let time pass by and it will vanish eventually.Both of them(your "friend" and my "friend") will notice what they missed out on and will feel bad for the way they treated us.Its a part of life.They were not meant to be for a lifetime.|`|7KZOOkYYaa	First, you need to get those feelings out in the open with him so that for one you can truly get some closure and for two you would finally be able to move on. Then, you wont have to worry about thinking sad thoughts about him but happy ones when you listen to music|`|4wHjtkJXaa	How? How can anyone possibly help you not feel bad when you listne to music?|`|NehnjjQtaa	i know it is rough but in time you will get over him..and you certainly do not need him.. perhaps you have a good close girl friend to call and make some plans with to keep you from thinking of this dude...or  perhaps go shopping with  your mom or a sister perhaps,, just get out and enjoy life with out him ,and in no time some will else will come along to catch your eye!!! wishing you all the best of wishes too you !!   Also one more way to get over a relationship is by getting a adorable puppy! As i just read that buy owning a puppy can be very healing for you!! puppies are so very loyale and so gosh darn loveable too!! and very theraputic..And thru owning a puppy one makes more new friendships along the way as well...why even my baby sister is going thru this as well..though a so very long story baby sister now has a puppy and now she takes more shine to the cute puppy than the jerk of a boy friend!! Plus she laughs so much more due the new puppy we got her,we have not heard her laugh so much in a really ,really long time..she has really taken a shine to her new puppy!! more so than the boy friend..!!!|`|19d5770cab150410883b6c4338772a48aa	i think you just in love with the though of being in love|`|hcdQRBXvaa	solve the problem.|`|UFvn0kZ2aa	talk to him about it|`|KHVvDMLYaa	dont listen to music for a while.<br>  i know what that feels like. i was a cutter and i was torn between two like that. it was either feel satisfied and hurt or not satisfied and healthy<br>  its weird but it felt like what you feel now<br>  just do other stuff for now<br>  try not to think about it|`|IaK4SRHpaa	I'm sorry you're feeling so sad but you just need time to heal from all the hurt you are feeling.  Sometimes friends just move in different directions and you need to find new ones to share your interests with.<br>  <br>  No matter how hard it hurts to not have him talk to you, you can't force him to speak to you if he doesn't want too.  Maybe he feels you two have grown apart and he wants to make new friends.  You'd just have to understand if this is the case.<br>  <br>  Try to learn to let him go and not hate him.  If you can do this, your love for music would come back and you can learn to love music again.  Find new friends to share it with or try and discover different kinds of music you can enjoy listening to just as much.  This would help you to get over him too.

u70TaWI5aa	Pretty much she is telling you to man up. You have to be confident with asking her and be more confident around her. If you keep on being afraid woman can see that and get turned off by it. She took that long to respond and took forever because really, you should not know how long it took to respond. Don't obsess over her and ask her out face to face. If she rejects you don't cry about it, just be like okay then and move one. One she sees that you are cool with rejection then she will come back. Now maybe she just wants you to ask her face to face. Whatever it is the key thing is ask her out face to face.|`|tJ6N1IyZaa	You have to show her that you are confident in yourself.

Sometimes girls can have ulterior motives like that. Go out with her on Halloween and just see how the night goes. Maybe there will be a spark between you two or maybe you will get some things cleared up as far as her being interested if you talk to her. Good luck!!|`|KOZ8T0Djaa	 <br>  Of what you say, the girl seems to be into you, but you know, a woman's mind is not something one can easily read. <br>  <br>  So it's either she wants to be into a relationship or it may be a simple need to be with someone for Halloween. One night stands come both way. My advice is to take it as it comes, life's too short to analyze every possible hidden meaning of a girl's behavior. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S. Yeah, I'm a girl, too :) |`|3ABo7Spsaa	It's easier to know what she's thinking if you know more about her. If she's a huge flirt, chances are she's being a tease.

Don't overuse the word 'nice', and maybe put yourself into the sentence:  I really like how you're wearing your hair today, Ohhh--(the sticker) I really like that band.  My friends and I saw them . . .<br>  <br>  Those are all great first things to say, so I think you'll be just fine.  Do have a back-up story in case you don't find a natural conversation starting up after the compliment--if you say (in more words) 'nice hair' and leave, it's creepy; if you say 'nice hair' as if it is something you just might say to anyone with nice hair and keep talking, then you are just a guy paying attention, not a desperate guy hoping for a date--which makes it so much easier to ask for the date later.|`|lU7jWzEJaa	Most girls, like myself, like getting compliments on their appearance, i.e. pretty eyes/hair, look good in what they're wearing, etc. Try and go with something like that. |`|50073dbd5ecac430d78adbf7aa450341aa	Best one i ever gave out worked great for me.

tjZZUb0Waa	First of all...you need to end all contact with him.  Text, e-mail, cell phone all that needs to go out the door.  It's natural to feel a twinge of jealousy because that person used to belong to you but you have to realize that's all it is nothing more.  Those dirty e-mails and texts have trouble written all over them!  Wonder if your fiance stumbled across these messages?  The first person he would be upset with is you and all that does is tarnish your relationship.  Obviously this other guy is not the most loyal and very inconsiderate to his partner and this will only result in the end of his relationship.  Whether it be before or after the marriage but that doesn't mean you should risk ruining yours by continuing contact with him.  He's apart of your past for a reason and it needs to stay that way.  Let him know it was nice catching up but these conversations are very inappropriate and you're sure your fiance wouldn't appreciate them.  Plus the contexts of the text speaks very loud...it's all about sex!!!  I'm pretty sure the relationship you have with your fiance is way more substantial.  Good luck!<br>  B|`|AA10989335	Tell the slime bag to loose your number already! Thats disgusting. You shouldn't want or respond to these messages especially as an engaged woman. I get its hard watching an ex move on, even if you have no interest in them, but remember it ended for a reason. And look what you have now- hopefully a very sweet and handsome fiance. I think what happens in times like these is you just look back with rose tinted glasses to your time spent together and forget the dirty details that made the relationship dissolve in the first place. Trust me, I am thinking you are better off now, and especially better off than his fiance since he is obviously a low life for texting you such raunchy messges when hes supposed to be in a committed relationship to her.|`|pP9vkokgaa	i think you have not forgot him till now !!<br>  <br>  love is hard to forget but you should think that if he has moved up with his life then why should you waste your life for someone who doeson't  cares your feelings !!<br>  just throw him out of your mind !!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and if he continues to send you such dirty msg ,, ask him that you will tell this all to his fiancee !!|`|44Sj3bsZaa	I feel sorry for both of your fiances!

UdrKqQ0paa	Just be there and support her, once she feels more comfortable about the relationship, she'll probably open up to you more. When she feels it is the right time, she'll know how to open up to you, there is no fast and set rule about being open to someone, it depends on each person and how they react to things.<br>  It all takes time, which you seem willing to invest in the relationship.

Take the time to figure out what you want, then act on it.  You don't need any of our advice, listen to  yourself, and go get it.<br>  Good luck, and take the time to find yourself.  You deserve happiness, so why waste the time on something that is not giving it to you?|`|AA11806606	Stop playing games with each other.  If school is more important than this relationship with you..... take the hint and move on.  He is definitely not ready for a full time relationship.  And why would you even allow a "booty call" knowing that this is how he feels.  Get a life and dump this person as You know it's not the life you want.  Find someone who really wants to be with YOU and enjoy your life now.
MXjvZMUXaa	That means she loves you? Right?<br>  <br>  And why don't you have feelings for her?
u1uECuFNaa	Legally you would have no choice. <br>  <br>  I understand loving a child....so yes, it would tear me up, but I would, legal or no.....if I thought he could care for the baby.|`|zIMoBfuvaa	That would be very hard. Of course If I had the baby the past 7 months and grown attached and loved the baby and had so many plans for him, I would not want to give him away. Those parents thought they were adopting the baby....they should have made sure the Father was okay with it before going through with it so that this wouldn't have happened. Im sure the biological father would have more rights to the child if he didn't sign the baby over....I don't know. I feel very sorry for those adoptive parents if the baby had to be given back. That would be horrible.|`|TEX1iYQgaa	I would fight it by trying every avenue I could to legally keep the baby, but in the end I would have no choice but to do what the courts decide.|`|CQsD09D6aa	Legally you should have to. If the father didn't agree then he should still have rights to his child.|`|dvQYaRNDaa	Yes I would. It would tear me up really bad inside to do so, but I would have to unless the courts decided otherwise.|`|lYAdguSDaa	Legally yes there would be nothing I could do, but ultimately it would depend on whether the father was a good father or not, if I had to put myself in the father's shoes, I'd do the same thing he would because its not right and even though it would be hard to give up the baby, I would just because it is his father.|`|OA3Mgsuaaa	If the adoption was finalized, then there is little the father can do. I would not give back a child I had had for 7 months.

Girls who do that are those who are lost in life and they have nothing better than that. They make out with random guys because there's no nice guy who is willing to commit with them. <br>  <br>  If you want to travel l with just friends, do it. There's nothing wrong about that.

UrToN7Ngaa	it's a bad idea to do that unless you intend on giving her half of the money! don't pay half of her rent or any of the bills.. she's a fool!|`|S8RL9lieaa	She has found out something from her lawyer that isn't in her favour. So if I were you I'd take legal advice and soon.|`|mimykKnhaa	it depends if her name is on the deed (if you bought it together). if not, legally you can, but the tenants would likely be bothered by her if she doesn't agree because she will be angry.|`|utbfT0APaa	You should check the details with your attorney but, in my experience, you should be able to rent.|`|AA12041870	Get a roommate to help share the expenses.  If she doesn't like it, tell her that it is just to bad.  |`|IqqaA2wIaa	no...she will throttle you....speak with her...|`|MRDJu8v3aa	The answer is different is you are currently renting the house or buying/own. It sounds like you own the house. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately for you, you will have to pay half of the until the divorce is finalized unless your wife will let you off the hock.<br>  <br>  As for renting it to someone else, that is a lot more complex question:<br>  1. Did you own the house BEFORE getting married? If so, you should be able to rent it without her permission. <br>  2. Who's name is on the deed? If is is your name alone, you might be able to rent it without your wife's consent. <br>  3. If your wife owned the house BEFORE the two of you got married... sorry buddy but you are screwed. <br>  4. If your wife's name is the only one on the deep, you might be screwed just depending on whether or not you helped pay for it and can  prove that.<br>  5. If both of your names are on the deed, then both of you will have to agree on renting it to a third party.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, in most cases where the house was bought after the marriage, either one of you can claim the right to live in the house until the divorce is finalized. You should ask her to pay her half from the time that she moved out until the day the divorce is finalized ;)<br>  <br>  Before doing anything about the house, talk with your divorce attorney.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	She wants to live in the house, she can pay for ALL of it!  You paying any part while she lives there and you don't is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Best thing to do it sell it, if you can in this market. That or whoever lives in it pays for it, or let it foreclose or she can refinance into her name only and pay you half the equity.|`|Hbja2rzdaa	Not if its in both of your names. But if she was the one who left you for another man, and you can prove that, tell it to the judge and you will most likely get it in the divorce. In the meantime though, tell her if she wants to live in it, she's going to have to pay all of the bills. HERSELF.|`|eENXMoepaa	No, do not rent it to her.  She needs to "BUY" your part of the house so you can move on otherwise you will always still be connected to her.  She needs to re finance in her name only as well when she buys you out.|`|50073dbd5ecac430d78adbf7aa450341aa	i would not, not unless you want to compound your legal problems.<br>  I am not one, and not soliciting business, but why not seek the advice of a real estate attorney before jumping from the frying pan into the fire?|`|XRXG0MIIaa	If the house is in both of your names, let her move in if she pays all the bills.

It's worth it.|`|OzREW683aa	no because the house is half her legally....|`|WJqtyqqUaa	What the heck does "working on a divorce" mean? It's an extremely complicated procedure which, unless you live in a community property state (in which case, the house is half hers and you can't do ANYTHING with it without her approval), you need an attorney to tell you if what you've been doing since you began your process is going to count, or if you will find yourself responsible for twice the money you think you are. |`|LxrsG8ifaa	If she is no longer living there I don't see why you couldn't. It would be wise not to get a female roommate however. It is completely unacceptable for her to move in with her bf. Change the locks and make sure none of her items are in the house that she can claim you are depriving her of. I would talk to her as little as possible until divorce proceedings begin, then communicate through a lawyer. |`|iyCOmSxuaa	well if shes the sort of person that is understanding then she will understand why you can no longer aford it if i wer you i would stop tlking to her unlesss you have children of course i can see that shes going to throw a spanner in the works and make it worse for you. shes just sucking up off you hun because you seem soft dont let her do your own thing but get advise of a solicitter of some sort first x|`|UU1YR1Kaaa	I would document that one, and get a good lawyer fast, and get a divorce, since she "has" a BF.  If the lease is in both of your names there is not much you can do, if the lease is in your name only then she has no claim to it.|`|19af8dea70753bd396acc3be57064ed8aa	Forget renting it out (which I think you should do)! Burn the ************ down and collect. Move out and then forget the *****!|`|cdpAhnlXaa	You should talk with a lawyer about this.

[Mr. T voice] get a divorce, fool!|`|zsH4wI0Raa	NO dont do it without asking her!!!!!!|`|hjBHJFciaa	lol... your gunna be sleeping on the new living room couch for about a year|`|gKfdrK3Laa	It sounds like a touchy subject. I'm not a lawyer, but knowing what I do of divorces I would say that it all depends on whose name is on the deed to the house. If both your names are on it then no you cannot deny her request to live in it. I would also imagine that you would be required to pay for half the mortgage. However, if you are going forward with the divorce I would certainly check with your lawyer. If you have been paying the entire mortgage since you separated then you may be entitled to some compensation. But, even if she doesn't move back in I would be leary of renting it simply because you would be the landlord signing the lease. If the judge gives the house to your ex-wife then you may have to pay the tenant to vacate if the wife doesn't want them in it. Be careful!
WMR8hVlfaa	Your attitude is the WRONG one for anal sex, I can tell you that. The women in movies are paid performers who have done anal hundreds of times. They know how to perform the act safely. <br>  <br>  You need to use TONS of lube, first of all. As much as possible. Second, it takes some time to work into it. You can't just shove ol' Mr. Penis up there without any warning. It's going to hurt her, and you could possibly injure her very badly.<br>  <br>  Start out by using some lube and massaging the area with a finger. Then, try putting a finger in but be very gentle. Once she is used to that, try two fingers. I also suggest getting a toy that is made for anal penetration and using that on her with LOTS OF LUBE. Once you have explored all of that and she feels she is ready, then you can try using your penis. But be VERY careful and gentle, and also please note that some women just are not going to like it at all, ever.|`|KK718Xxaaa	tell her i said it's just as good as in the front!!<br>  it actaully feels really good but it hurts.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  juggalette 4 life<br>  much love to the juggalo family <br>  jamie madrox and violent j and shaggy 2 dope r hot <br>  i gave it to a juggalo<br>  lol sexiest killa u know <br>  peace. im out. <br>  bloody B|`|iO4YHFavaa	Dont compare her with the women in the movies. women in the movies has their *** hole are little bigger becuz they went thru lots of anal sex. your gf is probably new to this, if u really want to do this, most important thing is to relax her.|`|b7yvPsiVaa	If she's scared then she dosn't want to.

yIJzWavsaa	well if she has said she has a BF, she has laid the line and wants the guy to know not to cross the line, casual conversation is fine<br>  but for me honestly i wouldnt interfere in her relationship with her BF and i would let her know it and let her know that and that im being friendly|`|AA10813928	I wouldn't necessarily think anything good or bad of her.  Nowadays, women are FAR more careful of men (they don't know) who walk up and start talking to them.  Guys know that, obviously.<br>  <br>  In the same respect, nearly all women who don't want to be constantly harassed while they're working out will say they have a "significant other".

Desiderare di essere amati non porta necesseriamente come conseguenza l'incapacità di amare. Detta così, si darebbe un'accezione esclusivamente egoistica al desiderio di essere amati. Quando invece è sì primario, ma "serve" a dare altro amore. Come ha detto Lupaalberta12, solo se "siamo amati" inizialmente, in origine, saremo in futuro in grado di riconoscere l'amore e quindi, non solo di riceverlo, ma di donarlo.<br>  Io penso invece che a volte non siamo capaci di amare anche perchè ne abbiamo ricevuto troppo poco...|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	hai ragione........|`|af54fc22a02841daa1e85c3013f0e1d5aa	l'amore  è  un  segreto molto interno. io posso  voler bene ad  una persona e arrivare ad  amarlo quando  sento il  suo volermi  veramente per  quello che  sono e  che  dono!|`|SzKsfVvoaa	Sono completamente d'accordo. molte volte mi sono chiesta se fosse questo il vero motivo della mia "singletudine"...|`|ZiW3ra3caa	una cosa per volta,<br>  siamo capaci di amare perchp vogliamo essere amati.<br>  io dò anche se poi non ricevo niente.<br>  è una mia prerogativa dare senza pretendere di ricevere.<br>  poi se ricevo meglio.<br>  <br>  questo è amare.<br>  <br>  un saluto<br>  <br>  Franz|`|fJn4LsI9aa	Non sono proprio d'accordo con te cara Nady,l'animo umano ha bisogno di sentirsi amato perché altrimenti non sarà mai capace di donare amore,un bambino non amato sarà un adulto che non è in grado di esprimere i propri sentimenti,al contrario che riceve amore d'istinto lo dona,poi può capitare il momento in cui si è un poco egoisti e si vorrebbe solo ricevere senza donare,è una cosa normalissima e fa parte dei diversi percorsi che l'individuo fa nella propria vita,intanto ti mando tutto il mio affetto,un caldo abbraccio mamma lupaalberta|`|sKKay0Z5aa	".. love that never told can be..."|`|G8vl7dSxaa	daccordissimo<br>  un bacio Dana|`|A8eHz593aa	l'importante x alcuni è procreare

Just giving money won't do anything.<br>  <br>  You give me $50000 and he would smoke them behind drugs. <br>  <br>  If he is in need of medical help, I would take him to the doctor.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	If they're genuinely homeless and not just con artists then yes. Often, instead of money I'll buy them a burger or a sandwich or something. The crooks usually just walk away when I offer but the truly needy get thrilled by the prospect and devour the meal when they get it. That tells me that the person was truly hungry and anyone who goes hungry in this country obviously has real problems and needs our help.<br>  <br>  One other plus to giving a little is it boosts ones self respect and reminds us that we have abundance and are successful. You can give a shrink thousands to try to make you feel worthwhile, or you can give someone who may be in need a few bucks and actually be worthwhile. Such a bargain!|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	It depends, I do sometimes, esp. if they are handicapped.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	a lot depends on the circumstances at the moment.<br>  <br>  I take into consideration the safety of the situation.  is there a danger of this person being deranged and will they attack or mug me if I stop long enough to fish out change for them? <br>  <br>  Do I have the extra money to part with?<br>  <br>  Do they look like they are really in a tight spot or is it their profession to stand on the local street corners and beg?   <br>  <br>  Am I really helping or am I enabling selfdestructive behavior?<br>  <br>  basically, if I have the money in hand and to spare and I'm not placing myself in danger then I will give a couple of bucks because one never really knows when one will also be in a really tight spot.  But for any giving of value, I prefer to support the local shelters who then help the ones who really want and need the help.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Here in Chicago?<br>  <br>  No freaking way.|`|BUET39wmaa	working downtown toronto years ago i would see the same guy sitting on the same corner.<br>  i went into a coffee shop and got myself a coffee and him a muffin and he threw it back at me saying "what do I want that for?  i want money"<br>  <br>  so he ruined it for EVERYONE.|`|m81dfyOYaa	Yes, I have on many occasions.

They don`t need  that to dignify themselves, they need shelter and food and those institutions provide it.|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	i have been scamed out of over$40 by this lady who had a really heartbreaking story. and i felt like i should help her out.   turns out her story was on the news for being a scam.turns out she was a crack adict. you can't always tell.  this is my thoughts and most homeless missions etc tell you to do the same.  if someone is begging for money because they are hungry, etc. take them to a store or resturant and buy them a meal, or a snack etc.  or if you have food items with you give them that.  but don't give them money. you never know what they will use it for. and there are professional 'beggers' who make more/hour than i do working full time. just by sitting on the corner asking people for money.   i followed a guy who had a really bad limp. and was dressed in rags.  as he turned one corner his limp was less. when her turned the next it was gone, and when he turned the corner after that he got into a really nice car that i couldn't afford...   i was pissed. and i will never give homeless people money ever again...  walk by with a mcdonals job application or something.  there are programs that teach these people job skills. there really is little excuse for poverty in north america.   it's the working poor that really need your help. but because they have a job we don't give them our money.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	I would if I had the cash and not just a 1 or 2. You don't see many homeless people where I'm from. I'm sure they are out there, but it's a pretty small community. It's not like Washington DC or Philly where you see them often, so if I see a person in need I will try to fill the need...|`|PHYj1UPwaa	I was driving home from work after midnight one night..there sitting by the red light trying to cross the street was a man in a wheelchair..with no legs!!

I admit that manhy of them will just use it to buy beer with or whatever, but I don't care.  First, if someone asked in a bar, I would probably buy them a beer anyway.

I never give them money because they'll probably blow it on booze or drugs.|`|xPZm0Mxlaa	I don't think it's wrong to wont to help others in fact it is a good  for the soul. But I don't give homeless people money because it is to hard to tell if the person is homeless or just collecting money in the streets.Far to many people look homeless and are not they make a living begging for money that other people work hard for.That $1 or $2 also will end up in a bottle of 80proof .|`|e1oky4jSaa	I would be more likely to work in a soup kitchen or volunteer in a health clininc for the homeless instead of giving them money. That way you know you did something good for them instead of wondering if they are going to buy drugs or alcohol.<br>  My husband will give them a dollar or two, especially if its a freezing cold morning and they are "working" the corner at 5 am. He said he has respect for homeless people that get up that early in 8 degree weather lol.|`|AA12376180	Sometimes yes and sometimes no. I tend to give more freely to a female than a male. Why? I guess I feel men are supposed to be able to take care of themselves. I feel women have a rougher time of it. A woman with children will always get my attention.<br>  <br>  If a homless person is standing outside of the donut shop I will usually give them money, if they are there the next day or any day after that, I will usually not give them anymore money. Why? I guess I feel they are career panhandlers and are taking advantage of me.<br>  <br>  I try not pass judgement on anyone but I catch myself still stero typing.<br>  I feel the reason there are so many homeless people in the big cities is because there is no money in helping the homeless. as of yet no one has figured out how to make a profit by helping them. When that is figured out, I guarantee there will be no more homeless people.|`|rroE37HTaa	I was involved in a docudrama on homelessness a few new years eves ago..here is some of what I found. A guy that looked so sad hanging out in the subway, we gave him sandwich, soda and talked to him, he gets really cheap rent (controlled from the 70's) makes over 2,000 a month from retirement and service related benefits, PLUS full medical insurance! (his rent is 200 a month for a 2 bedroom!) So really this guy who says he doesn't have enough money to live gets alot more than I do to live on when the bills are all paid!<br>   Second was a lady sleeping in a bank where the teller machines are, she had some real issues! I did give her money my gloves and scarf, as well as food.<br>  Third was a guy sitting on a stoop with a moving blanket..in talking to him we learned he spent his last 10 dollars on heroin!<br>   So no I don't think it wrong to give money to a homeless person, just be aware that they may not be homeless, they may use your cash for drugs..or they may really need it!|`|tbJraueLaa	i give.  h*ll, that could be me some day..|`|fLU63N4kaa	That's a very hard question! I do give when I can, as I think it's important to help those who need it. <br>  <br>  But I think it varies, if they deserve it or not. I mean, if they're homeless because they didn't bother working or making the effort than no, they don't deserve it. If they're homeless because of some unfortunate event then of course it's important to give. But we can't figure their circumstances from looking at them so there's no way to know.<br>  <br>  But yes, I would.|`|Q6Dyu1zKaa	No.  I used to offer to buy them a meal, that way I know they are not using it to buy drugs or booze.  Then one day I watched one of them get on the same commuter train I did, and then saw them use their key to enter the same apartment building I lived in.  There are to many of them that dress the part because it's easier to pretend you are destitute and beg than it is to get a job like the rest of us.  <br>  <br>  I don't work in the big city any longer so I rarely see them, but when I do have to go downtown I just walk right past them.|`|AA10911598	I was with my kids at  a Hardees one day and there was an elderly gentleman that was counting change from his pocket before he got in line.  I gave him a few dollars.  That is all I carry with me most of the time.  It felt good to help him get a bite to eat.  I think if a person is trying to do the right thing then help should be provided.  I dislike having to pay higher taxes to help home owners that are sitting home and not working somewhere on a daily basis.  Work is available in many places but people don't want to take a job where they have to work up a sweat.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	no i will not give them money, but i will be more then willing to give them food.  Money can be taken and spent on alcohol or drugs.  I have meant homeless people in rest areas across the nation, I have made them supper, given them self heating cans of soup and crackers and soda pop.  but i have never given them money.|`|xGshAiXOaa	No, I wouldn't.  I work too hard for every dollar I earn to be handing it out.  They should do the same.|`|p6QizgmRaa	No. Because I live in Florida and once you hand over ANY money, they watch for you every day. They will follow you (if they can) until you hand some money over. If you have time to stand on the freakin corner, stand behind the register at your local grocery market or McD's or BKing....|`|GRXdbUdoaa	i don't give them money because most of the time they take that money and spend it on alchol. i give them what they really need. i give them food and something to drink.|`|AA10874773	i'll give food, occasionally money.  i've volunteered at the shelter many days, trust me, if they say they're hungry - its better to give them the food.  if they say they need clothes - bring them clothes.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	No I will not. I will buy them some food. If you give them a few dollars for food, They may spend it on drugs or booze.|`|ZEitfScGaa	I do all of the time, but nothing more than the change in my pocket.|`|xNWqqlcYaa	i give them money after i make them do something really embarassing like hopping on one foot or pushing their shopping cart down a big hill and watching them run after it. that's the funniest.|`|8bP67U8Taa	I wouldn't give them money. I need money so why am I going to be helping someone that can go get a job and work like me.|`|yhsT1weJaa	depends, if they looked as tho they needed it i might.<br>  but i wouldnt really, because then they would harras you, and tyhey would only spend it on drugs or something. so really no!|`|rGStRem1aa	i did when i was younger but now i dont care|`|va9nnyXMaa	If you can afford it, yes/no. Read them first and know the area.I've hitchhiked all over the united states and spanged sometimes. I always was honest about what it was for. Some places have nothing to offer to people in need of help and no way to make some fast honest cash. Some places have lots of places to eat for free and supply you with everything you need. So it really depends on the location, the person/s, and yourself.|`|dUnDqrmtaa	Yes well where i live there a homless person by a starbucks i once gave to then i saw him accualy go in a buy a coffee..so now every time i see him i give him a little cash.|`|IetukCEiaa	No there is a reason they are homeless. mostly because they cant manage money so why would i give them my money. they should get a job and earn money|`|Au6iZRizaa	Not usually, they usually use it for drugs or alcohol

Some men act awkwardly when they feel this way, it could also be because he is self conscious or that hes not sure how to act around girls (he likes). Just keep being nice to him and eventually he will ease up. If not ignore him because you will know then that hes a jerk!|`|ZAhpuO6zaa	secretly hates you??!? I think he secretly likes you!! =O He might be just shy around you because he likes you, or nervous. Or he could secretly hate you but it's not a secret because he's mean. You can try to confront him about it if you want other then that you really shouldn't be concerned with what people think of you because when you are concerned about what other people who you aren't friends with think about you it makes you insecure. =) Hope this helps.|`|oImdesHcaa	could be two things.<br>  <br>  first, its either he is shy and is completely smitten for you and has no idea what to do around you, so he gets scared and avoids the situation.<br>  <br>  or, he simply does not like you at all, for some weird reason, cuz to me at least you sound like a nice girl.<br>  <br>  to figure out which one it is, try flirtin with him. you might not like him and will wonder why i am asking you this, but if you flirt with him or ask him to do something for you an give him some opportunities to get brownie points for you he'd do it and he likes you if he enjoys the flirting. if he avoids all situations, then he probably doesn't like you. hope this helps :D<br>  <br>  please answer my question in my profile need a few tips ;)|`|EIsnATLxaa	Yeah what the other guys said hes just shy or nervous about talking to girls just talk to him more often eventually he'll talk back|`|CM0J3RDWaa	HE EITHER HATES YOU OR IS COMPLETELY IN LOVE WITH YOU|`|IqDNqYo6aa	this sounds something like twilight..with bella an edward...but i thinks he likes u an feels shy an don't no how to approach u..i would suggest if u talk to him, he will open up to u more|`|0wLrgSEraa	maybe hes a vampire and wants your blood|`|vUypopU8aa	hes just shy (:|`|MX1shAbcaa	He likes you and he's shy and gay tbh wtf is wrong with him he must be afraid of girls...

UOzSNEO8aa	OH yes, I think just about everyone does.  If they don't they are obviously naive and believe anything that their partner says.<br>  <br>  I've been cheated on by a few guys, and I've caught them in lies as well.  Once your trust is broken, and a situation where similar things start happening, you get insecure about it.  It's almost like dejavu! <br>  <br>  Once you move on from someone who has hurt you, be cautious, because it could very well happen again.  But don't take it out on the new guy!|`|lBZkXzr0aa	Yeah I have slight trust issues.  Why.......... well I guess being cheated on by my man with my best friend of 10 years might have something to do with it.  <br>  <br>  She is a total skank and I have made him pay dearly for his infidelity.   Her time will come soon enough,  Still waiting to get my revenge on her,  this happened 3 years ago.  <br>  <br>  LMAO!|`|AA10266072	Oh yeah.  Mostly because people like to lie to me.
yIJzWavsaa	ask her out as friends, you should ask her if she would want to go and hang out and do something, take the time to know her and talk with her, pretty soon the conversation will build up and more questions will be asked between the both of you, make her laugh and stuff<br>  and do this for like a few times when you hang out, you will feel that ur confident to ask her if she wants to develop a realtionship, and you'll know at this time if she feels the same thing you do, but act quickly before someone else does it trust me this works, the more you talk to a girl, the more she knows about you and find many things that attracts her|`|tNBWRPIdaa	Take her to dinner, and if you live anywhere near a cool place like the empire state building take her somewhere she will just love the view...

When it's a matter of you or your children possibly losing life, sentimentality has no place in this.  Some people count on using emotional ties to get out of being prosecuted for domestic violence. Sometimes the emotional knives they twist are just as bad as any physical one they can cut you with. <br>  <br>  <br>  Better to die trying to defend yourself and your children than allow yourself to be a sacrificial lamb because that person "once loved you."|`|wYaWYxLjaa	I'd defend myself it would be tragic that my one love had killed himself and tried to take me down with him, but knowing you have the strength to keep going and not give up that's what makes you want to live, your spouse just couldn't handle it, and he wants to be in a "better place", if there is a such thing.|`|CWVBfaPwaa	That is horrible, sorry to hear about that.

EZdRYJXraa	First love is always special for anyone. Person will never be able to forget about first love even if the relationship does not materialize. It is the stage when you suddenly realize changes in yourself. You always end up thinking about your beloved all the time. You do not feel hungry and remain awake even late nights. All the time the person expects some phone call or message from his / her beloved. It is really a special feeling when the person is having first love but unfortunately after the break up will be only a memory.  To love someone till eternity? I have heard so but not felt so, I think only people who have fall in love with the right person which they want to spend the rest of their life has that feeling. Now I think that my first love was like a flower, after I found it , it slowly died.|`|hlkAosk2aa	Yes, you can. I mean it is possible if you don't begin to hate that person.<br>  <br>  You love your Mother; at the same time you love your father, your wife, etc. What matter's is that whether you act upon that love or not -- that is whether you show your love or not. <br>  <br>  A person can love his/her father, but he/she may neglect to show it because he/she don't have the time to show it; or the person can refrain from displaying it because he/she found out he is having an extra-marital affair. So whether intentionally or negligently, it is possible to love someone forever but not be able show it.<br>  <br>  In the same way, it is possible to fall in love with someone and love that person for the rest of eternity, but not show it because that person got married to someone else.<br>  <br>  As for me, I love this girl, who got married to someone else. I still love her and even if I do get married to some other girl, I will continue to love her. I just will not put my love on display. <br>  <br>  Sharad, people may disappear; love does not.<br>  <br>  Hope I was able to explain myself.|`|Cs6W9V3Baa	Till eternity?  <br>  <br>  If there is an eternity, isn't it happening now?  Wouldn't that be "till eternity?"  So, I guess the answer would be, "Yes."|`|wYaWYxLjaa	I believe it, but most people don't, you know how it goes, they say there is that special someone for everyone, is that why there are an even number of population on earth? I know i found mine, it's all how u look at it.|`|6CPFRnGraa	If you truly love that person, then yes, I think it's very possible.|`|AkaRgUj7aa	FALSE|`|AA11501437	i think we can love alot of people till eternity - that doesn't mean relationships will last that long.
I2wPn0Zlaa	It means we want to take our time and not get into anything serious quick. It also could mean "No were not having sex with you just yet"|`|e98RKB35aa	Taking it slow just means she isn't ready for physical. Just enjoy being around her and have fun and laugh together. When time goes by and she feels more and more comfortable with you then she will move to the next level and so on. I have been there but don't stop talking to her. Talk and talk just maybe start with holding hands if she is comfortable with that then go from there but it will take time and you need to respect that.|`|CaRKCpMqaa	By not rushing into things. If your in the relationship and the person says 'lets take it slow' it means, lets not rush into sex, love, marrige, kids ect.<br>  If just dating it generally means lets have fun, a few more dates then see what happens.<br>  Just taking things slow.|`|umEgRb7Vaa	They mean they want you to spend a lot of money on them without expecting sex any time soon, or at all.|`|MOALoKWdaa	by be patient with the relationship|`|dalNxu8zaa	i am saying the same thing right now...<br>  <br>  like dont kiss me on the first date wait two weeks or so dont rush things dont think cuz we have been dating for a month that u can grab my ***..lol|`|XXjcHdxxaa	When i say it there is few reasons.

Sometimes they are the one playing games|`|3fcc9a252947e724efd722b6fb916926aa	that is what caused me and my ex to break up.<br>  <br>  first its knowing him for 5 days and him asking me<br>  to be his girlfriend!?!<br>  <br>  and then trying to kiss me on the first date.<br>  <br>  and even asking about sex after 1 week and a half.<br>  <br>  you know what im saying? we need time to build<br>  trust in you. then the relationship can really get<br>  started :]|`|mnlKeD61aa	Well the term 'take it slow' is not rushing things and taking it at a steady pace without rushing or been too slow otherwise you will fail either way. And you can spend quality time together, and its not all about physicall stuff.|`|GIPIjD2Oaa	It means they dont want to sleep with you too soon, or like marry you after a week of knowing you .. bit extreme but thats the jist, they just want to enjoy getting to know you. Its better to be too slow than to rush things.|`|Vvecns23aa	its kinda like she's not gonna kiss on the first date.|`|endgX6Saaa	usually taking it slow means nothing really past kissing|`|bHcjc9Q0aa	dont do everything all at once.get to know the girl before u go and makeout with her|`|0pHtqdZqaa	They met someone else --- or they no longer like you|`|qi52nTmDaa	Take it slow means that they are not ready for a full relationship right now, more like a partnership. A good friend to be there, and maybe a bit intimate .. only when its convenient in their life. Whom ever you are with I would say move on since you are not compatible at this time. Even if you like this person move on date around, and if you are willing to wait for them, they will come to you when the time is right in their life.|`|FgB0fg01aa	We mean don't try to "make a move" on us on the first date! Don't do the "arm thing" and don't expect making out. Yeah. That's about it.|`|061beed10d29f9c5aa986e3e09fd392daa	i think, taking it slow means that the girl is overwhelmed with your attention but not necessarily mean she doesnt like you at all..|`|IhIXtf9yaa	TAKE IT SLOW

Practice makes perfect.|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Amy, I was shy when I was in 7-12 grades. So I know what you are talking about. However, there are things about you you that are personal but not a big deal. For instance, your birthday. It is just a day. Everyone has one. Same thing with your Zodiac sign. You need to be able to talk to people. Keep your secrets secret, but to express that you like winter, snow, chocolate, blue, or other stuff like that is no big deal. Most are just opinions, and everyone has those, also. <br>  <br>  The art of conversing is one that you need to become involved and the better you are at it, the easier it will be to deal with people. <br>  <br>  I hope that this helps you. It took me a long time to be able to talk to people easily. You too can learn how.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Dan<br>  <br>  PS I see by your profile that you are very private. Maybe it would be a good idea for you to change your email status. This does not release your email address, but merely allows other YahooAnswer users to send you an email through the Answers system.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	You sound exactly like me. At school you don't say a word for the whole day, but when you get home. You are the funniest and most talkative person ever! Yeah, just like me. I can't hold conversations either, and I am working on that as well. I don't know how, but I am working on my shy and quietness. I just started this new school (culinary school) and I acted like how I always did. My classmates would say I was quiet and would call me "Quiet Sydney" or "Ms. Mouse" because I wouldn't talk. Mind you I started this school Feb 2 of this year. So last week, I got out of my comfort zone and began acting how I do at home. It was very hard to do. And I hate also when I talk, I have the tendency to be ignored as well or they stop listening. I don't know why. That is another reason I don't talk. But anyways, I started talking and people would laugh at what I have said and some of them even said they liked me this way, to my face. I was shocked. Just for one day, act like you do at home. You will be shocked at how many people will react to you. This confidence and you acting how you actually are, that will have you get a boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Just act like you. This guy should like you whether or not you talk or not.|`|v8ImtsaJaa	no your not boring you just need to have confidence in your self.
idKfxUTkaa	Wow, I can't see why he didn't make his move on you. You seem sweet, mature, and kind. I really think you should still talk to him, and see if he acts the same with you.

Try and do your best to move on for now, if he's not ment to be with the other girl and ment to be with you they will break up in time and he will probably ask you out.

U have to try and stop thinking about him so much, and stop hanging out with him and then he might miss you and then realize and he wants you, and then maybe will ask u to be with him.  Do fun stuff to take your mind off him, sports, exercise, movies at home, music, etc.  U dont want to force any man to be with u , he has to want to and make the effort to come to u. If its meant to be, it will happen, if not, u can force it. Good Luck.

VSVQHKwKaa	Of course not. <br>  <br>  This is what is referred to as a rebound relationship. Your cousin feels very hurt and angry and wants control of the relationship. She knows she couldn't do this with a man her own age, so she gets a 19 year old that she can order around.<br>  <br>  With this 19 year old puppy dog, she doesn't have to worry about arguments, disagreements, or clashes of will. <br>  <br>  As long as she keeps the relationship temporary, she'll be fine in the short term. The problem is, girls usually take a short term situation and try to extend it to a long term one...and there is no long term situation here. <br>  |`|0u6qy9Uuaa	maybe she has no interest in a LTR with him - maybe she's just having fun-I doubt a 19 yr old would be looking for something permanent at his age|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Whatever floats their boats. They are both adults. Who knows if it will work, maybe she likes babysitting or something. Who knows if any relationship will work.|`|Q2CQxrfraa	If she was married for awhile, she probably wants to go back to feeling like she's younger again and prove that she's still hot enough to get a young guy. Truth is usually after awhile, it usually makes a woman feel older and insecure when they start to age. I can't really see what she'd have in common with a 19 year old guy either, so hopefully it's just a little fling! |`|MRDJu8v3aa	I highly suspect the this 19yr old bf is just a "rebound" lover and that the relationship will not last. <br>  <br>  I cannot agree with some of the other answers you have received about letting your cousin have fun because it is my nature not to look at just one half of the story. Your question focused on your cousin. But what is best for this young man?  Is his spending time with an older woman going to hurt him in the long run? Would he not be better off going out with women closer to his own age?<br>  <br>  Yes, there are more 30yr old men to "bang" 19-20yr women; that does not make it right or healthy.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	Who cares its not your problem let her have some fun..|`|ZQE61wUZaa	Here kitty kitty, my kinda cougar!!!!   Middle aged women are hot to young men and vise versa, she will have a blast feeling those tight abs, and he will have a blast being with an experinced hottie whose mentality is great before, during, and after the sex.  Let it ride, they are enjoying each other. Will anyones relationship work whats age got to do with anything?|`|TXaAsy4Kaa	well look at linda hogan hulk hogans ex wife. shes in her fourties and now is dating a 19 year old. she is very good looking for her age but why date someone who is the same age as your daughter. (her daughter is 19 as well) |`|50073dbd5ecac430d78adbf7aa450341aa	Franco, <br>  This is your concern, why?<br>  I am sure that your cousin is not interfering in your business, and i would say, lucky 19 year old!<br>  Now, go mind your own business!|`|Jeh5NFbnaa	No it won't work out. It is probably some party thing or just want a younger for time being. Maybe he likes a cougar. In the end the passion and have fun will wear out. |`|PPLxDKYwaa	YIKES.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	It probably won't work out in the long term, but let her have her fun.  It's her business anyway.|`|Gqxsyh5Kaa	Way to take advantage of a kid.  Inappropriate.  It won't work he'll drive her nuts.|`|1f4c803984defdfd24e382289f4e3180aa	What's the problem? As long as she isn't planning a wedding I don't see anything wrong with it.|`|UmpNsE0Taa	Who cares how old he is?  As long as he is legal, age is just a number.  Let your cousin enjoy herself.  It doesn't have to work forever, just for as long as they are both interested.<br>  <br>  Would you even be asking if your cousin was male, 30, very attractive, and had a 19 year old girlfriend?|`|rtR3IDBCaa	Who cares?!  She is probably going through some emotions right now.  Let her have her fun!  Maybe it will work out.. but if it doesn't at least she'll have bragging rights for a while! |`|lIsoVLcxaa	What do you care??? <br>  Let your cousin do what she wants... <br>  <br>  Nobody ever bothers the 30 yr old man who likes to bang 19-20 yr old girls.... |`|1vQgA6oCaa	sometimes it does.|`|AA10576462	Not for you to decided maybe she is just being a cougar and having her fun
lHjab4Liaa	dont be a ho|`|igkbUflbaa	This is complex. If he wants to do something that you're not ready for, and is insistent, then he doesn't deserve you. Dump him; you'll find someone better. I promise.|`|vKrWrhQeaa	well how does he act around you? if he's sweet and nice and wat not, and it seems like he really likes you, then it does<br>  if all he wants to do is make out, then he's going out with you for the wrong reasons....<br>  <br>  if it ever comes down to him asking you for sex, tell him that you're not old enough, and that he should respect your decision|`|xArlqHtraa	Well, I know that this sounds cliche but be yourself. If you have to pretend to be someone you're not or if you have to restrain yourself or say stuff you normally wouldn't say, then you won't be happy in the relationship anyway, no matter how much you may like the guy. Stay with him for now, to see how he acts and says. If it's all normal, then maybe his friend was just joking or trying to freak you out. If he really does seem to date you just to get in your pants then you have to break up with him. I hope that this helps.|`|JhrdIVBgaa	This is easily resolved. Just dont believe his friend, because its probably not true, his friend is probably just jealous. You should not stress about it. If for some reason it turns out that he does just want to have sex with you then you simply say no and break it off because he is not the great guy that you see him to be. Im proud of you for not wanting to have sex. I lost my virginity aroudn your age and I feel so stupid because that is extremely to young. But anyway, just play it out. Im sure things will work out for you.|`|aQ8EK9hraa	first off id say you have only been dating him for a week plus you are only in the 8th grade there should be no pressure to have sex.<br>  most likely his friend said that to be an annoying teen. <br>  chances are hes not even matured far enough to have sex. if he pressures you then you should know its not worth it there will be plenty of amazing guys out there and you have a lot of time to play the field.|`|m2ARO4ZIaa	first you should definitely figure out what his motive is. Try to look behind all the hand-holding, hugging, physical things, gifts& compliments. Do you like how he acts as a guy should? As your boyfriend? If not, you should probably know that he's not for you.|`|11SCey7Xaa	If he is using you to have sex, then you shouldn't like him at all. However, your boyfriends " friend" could be lying. Bring it up with your boyfriend and have a serious talk with him. You don't want to be in a relationship where everything is focused on "sex". You want a deep and meaningful relationship where you can trust and relie on your boyfriend, i know it's only been a week, but consider talking to your boyfriend about that comment and you have the right to be upset about it. Good Luck.|`|FGadadAuaa	Well first if thats his real goal then he wont stay with you if you don't want to have sex (which is good =D). All you have to do is be yourself and make it known that you do not want to have sex (and don't let him guilt trip you into it XD) then if that was really his intentions then he'll leave and you'll see that he wasn't all that great of a guy, and you find some one better. If He's understanding and wants to wait to then awesome. Just be Yourself and dont change for anyone but you =P. I hope all goes well and have fun =D|`|40qTdKuPaa	You have to sit down with him and ask him what he wants from you. Most boys that age are only with girls for that, and since he knows hes your first boyfriend he feels like he can make you do anything to keep him, see your already asking what can i do or say for him to stay with me,You have to think about that! I think he most likely is trying to use you, Talk to him. I think you should end it with him, and someone right willl come along. Believe me , being used and munipulated sucks! dont put yourself through it. hope this helps|`|8LzZvPwjaa	1. Don't give him any.<br>  <br>  2. Ask him about the issue. It's possibly true but it might not, maybe his friend is jealous or something.<br>  <br>  3. If he dumps you because you don't want to have sex with him, don't worry, on the contrary, be happy that he's out of your life.<br>  <br>  4. Better alone than with a jerk.<br>  <br>  5. You're only in 8th grade, don't worry, there will be others.|`|FNTpPD0raa	I don't think you should believe his "friend"...he might be joking or just jealous...go with your gut, if you think hes a total perv, dump him and find better. but if you really like him and he feels the same I'm sure he'll understand. just don't believe everything you hear from 3rd parties :p good luck!|`|OxoVYVi4aa	Most 8th grade dude's aren't all about sex... haha.<br>  <br>  He's probably going out with you because *gasp* he enjoys being with you??|`|v9XrDhR0aa	they guy is sexually active and not a very good person to date|`|x6k0qa1Eaa	First of all you should relax.  Second, you are way too young to be having sex so please do not do it.  Hopefully he is a nice boy, but at that age, boys experiment because they do not know much at all. Try to just be friends, that is the best thing to do.|`|OpaWRmHqaa	Sorry, but first he has to respect you. If not your relationship will not be worth it.<br>   Your wishes count very much!<br>    Most all boys at that age want to have sex. That is nature at it's best. Don't hurry.the best relationships have to "grow".|`|O0z4T2H8aa	Don't Listen to anyone Else they are just jealous, and don't have sex with him either until its legal and you are completely comfortable and happy.|`|jvKB4Txoaa	first of all you should talk to him and not just asume his friend is telling the truth and let him know that your not ready to have sex yet|`|UNCgdDs2aa	honestly if hes really amazing then he wont care if he gets any or not... why not just stay with him for now and if he trys to move on and start haveing sex just tell him no your not ready...|`|AA10275738	Stay the way you are tell him your just not ready. if he really likes you he will respect that.

O1jigUYSaa	I've lived all over US.  I'm a citizen, but not originally American.  Ohioans are down-to-earth in the western and southern end of the state.  Folks from Cleveland are more like people from Pittsburgh.<br>  <br>  As employees, Ohioans are trustworthy, down-to-earth, straight shooters who like the same of their bosses.  They listen and adopt a wait-and-see attitude regarding new neighbors and bosses.  <br>  <br>  I've lived in quite a few places.  My wife is from Connecticut - a New Englander.  Ohioans are a little more outgoing than New Englanders.  <br>  <br>  I live in Ohio now, Dayton to be exact.  Like most folks in manufacturing, I'm out of a job...I'm a Geezer though and close to retirement any how.<br>  <br>  I'd have to say I like New Englanders, very close are mid-westerners (Ohio), then Mid Atlantic (NY, PA, MD, DE), then Upper northwest and central (ND, Montana, Washigton),  Southern, then West, SW (TX, Cal).  The latter seem very superficial to me though as a very, very broad generalization.  Contrary to that, my best friend is a California native...narly dude!|`|sSrwcZb9aa	The people I know from Ohio are just fine, normal people, but all of them (and most other people I know) think Ohio is a boring, lame, state that could just become a great big lake or something for all they cared.

It's one of my favorite places in the world =D|`|2CSmPJrRaa	Agreed with the first answer, the only awesome part here is Cedar Point!<br>  <br>  What part of Ohio do you live in?<br>  <br>  It's so boring where I live!!<br>  But really, I think it's just Ohio overall.<br>  lol.<br>  <br>  <br>  We're just... people.<br>  hah.<br>  I don't know..<br>  <br>  I've lived here for all the years of my life, 13.<br>  <br>  By Cleveland..

I wished that I lived in New York city because its so much more exciting but yet be both live in little old boring Ohio! I really hope that you aren't an Ohio State fan... Because I move from Ann Arbor Michigan and well I'm a Michigan fan all the way! Like in my eyes I see Ohio so forest like with tons of farms.

oli6MD6paa	May he doesn't want you to get too attached, either. <br>  <br>  That, or he actually does love you and wants you to love him too. <br>  He could have changed his mind. But I'd make sure before placing too many bets on it. <br>  <br>  Or, he is just curious. <br>  Or, he could be like some men and just like the one way attention. <br>  <br>  When it comes to people, there's always a million answers. <br>  You can't get the right one here on Yahoo, you'll have to figure it out. <br>  I say ask him why he wants to know.

If it was after it could be that he is not sure what he wants,  he wants a relationship but he is scared of commitment and that could be why he is making excuses for getting involved in a relationship.  The reality is that you two are already involved in a relationship and maybe you guys should sit and talk about it .... trust me if he has time to do nasties with you he has time to hang out and take you on dates and whatnot.... tell him like this like it or not your in a relationship and if you have to break the friends with benifits because if he doesnt want a relationship. then seriously he is just using you.. hope this helps Mitch|`|eYuIsNk1aa	2 reasons either he has fallen for you or he is worried you did|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Because he probably is in love with you.

JXGx04qOaa	just think about it this way: how do you feel about your ex's and past relationships?  it's all in the past for you and the only person you care about is your current boyfriend, right?  if he's been with you for over a year now, he is committed to YOU and only you.  just keep that in mind and don't let the past ruin what you guys have, because you should consider yourself lucky.  usually i'm on here telling girls to run far, far away from their current situation.  but it sounds like you've got yourself a great guy.  my boyfriend has a pretty bad past as well, and sometimes it bugs the hell out of me.  but i just keep in mind that i've got a past too, and we're both human.  plus, you wouldn't go to a restaurant with no cars parked out front, would you?  lol see what i mean?  you've got yourself a great guy, consider yourself VERY lucky!!!  you just can't let his past get the best of you.  <br>  <br>  if you're always looking back at the past, you two will never be able to move forward together.|`|bHcjc9Q0aa	i sometimes feel the same.i believe that it helps people to talk about their past relationships so maybe hes just trying to get over the past and move on and look to the future.he probably cant get over his past because he spent a lot of time with these girls just like he does u but right now ur the only thing that matters to him and u have to trust him that hes not doing anything with any other girl so its ok for him to talk about it|`|Vvecns23aa	i have had the same problem.<br>  you are just jelous of what the other girls had with him.<br>  just remember that the only thing that matters is that,<br>  that really is his PAST you are his today.<br>  if he wanted to still be with those other girls he would,<br>  but hes with you instead.|`|xlmTBPBXaa	this happened with my boyfriend and you know what I did? I killed his Mother not jk*****. well what u need to do is Cheat. And i dont mean like a small flirty affair. I mean full blown grab that guy at the office and take him to the break room. Hope it helps girl!|`|IPDuAMWpaa	Man...I have the EXACT SAME PROBLEM. Haha matter of fact,I just posted a question about it,just as you did now. Go on here:  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjkeJKZ6F7wukYRrWwpPm9Psy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227110846AAyPuFG">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>  A lot of people gave me awesome advice on this,because I feel the same that you do. Good luck in your relationship!|`|55bf89b95658e65af7827cede5ad23b6aa	He has let it all go because he's not insecure anymore. <br>  <br>  You need to find out exactly WHAT is making you feel so insecure and work it out with yourself, or with a Counselor.<br>  <br>  Did you have a bad past relationship with someone who cheated on you? Maybe that is why.|`|jnIGCkawaa	it is pretty difficult.<br>  i just went through this not to long ago.<br>  my boyfriend and i have been together for about nine months now and just a few weeks ago i was telling how i'm just so insecure about not being the first girl he was with and whatever.<br>  i hated feeling so insecure and sorta jealous like, i hated the feeling because i have trusted him so much with all my life and i knew it was in his past and i hated that i felt like that.<br>  we talked it out and he has told me over and over that he wish he could've waited for me and yeah. we love each other so much.<br>  <br>  just talk it out with your bf. talk- it's the best thing for any relationship. maybe he can have inspiring words like my boy has and he will understand.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)<br>  i hope this helps you|`|vo7Ws7xtaa	Oh man.  I feel you.  My man and I are so solid in so many ways, I trust him and love him, and I know he adores me, but every time I hear about his past with other women I want to throw up... my point is, you aren't alone.  First of all, I'd talk to him about how it makes you feel to hear about his past.  Just say I might need a bit of extra reassurance about your past from time to time, over time you'll get past it.  It'll be farther and farther behind, but you'll need to stop yourself much of the time from letting your mind wander and get upset about it.  Remind yourself a million times a day if you have to that he's with you and NOT them... and you can control your reactions and how you take things.<br>  <br>  I hope it works out.|`|hF6uZqWRaa	get over it! trust me i know what im telling you. I have a past and so does my bf... everyone does. I hate the fact that he has been with other women and i wish i could of been his one and only but its not that way. I keep bringing stuff up about his ex gfs and asking him questions about him. All i can say that this only hurt me just by knowing that he was with someone else. but guess what?! hes with you now! so dont worry about it. the past is the past and nobody can go back and change it. but i do tell my bf when we move in together he has to get rid of that mattress because im not gonna allow  a mattress that he has sex with his exes to be in my house..even though he have sex on it now. lol.|`|tYO2Ir1oaa	I can completely relate to your dilemma, especially as my boyfriend is a lot older than me and therefore has a lot more exes than i do. I will look at old photos with his exes in them and feel jealousy rearing it's ugly head inside me- i torture myself with it, even though i know full well that my man loves me and only me. I think it shows that we really love our partner and can't bear the thought of them being this way and feeling these feelings for someone else before us. Although it's great that we love our boyfriends so much, this jealousy can literally cause the relationship to descend into chaos. I think we both need to just stop torturing ourselves with it, stop looking at pictures, and if we think about the exes force ourselves to remember that our boyfriends are with us for a reason, and no longer with their exes for a reason. <br>  <br>  If u feel like u can talk to him about it without it causing tension, that would be good. Hopefully he can offer u some words of reassurance to help u fight the green-eyed monster x
CbzP5Yegaa	You're both above the legal age so it's perfectly fine. I would consider 15 years too much of a difference. She might say no to the age difference because girls usually prefer older guys. But if you can prove to her that you're mature enough to handle her, then go for it.|`|9GzkVwfGaa	nope you both are adults so i does not matter.<br>  What would be really bad would you being 19 and her being like 40.|`|72ff9ba93444386d9a9deaa1d130fb21aa	age is just a number! it doesn't matter how old someone is, or anything else. just as long as you two really like each other. that's all that matters! so go for it dude! and if anyone has a problem with it, then tell them to get over it, because it's not like she's under age or anything else. so just go for it! |`|pgJ9lvyMaa	She probably will say no.  There are too many life experiences you have yet to be allowed to try that she's already lived through.  She's on her way to being a grown up and your still a teenager. Sorry. |`|ADP9swbMaa	Huge! I'm 19, and I know enough to know a 26-year-old is too old for me.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	go for it...|`|hzhdBO6faa	Time difference doesn't have to be a problem at all,talk with her and if you two are fine that is great.You don't have to be scared just ask her and you don't have anything to lose.If she likes you she'll say  yes,if she don't  like you she will say no..and that's it.Have a good luck ...I hope you'll solve your problem.|`|9IESsEdXaa	I wish people would get over this age thing. In the Bible Isaac was 40 years old when he married Rebecca who was 10 years old. We have these cultural biases that are so absurd. Age is just a number! It depends on how connected and determined to make the relationship work of both parties involved. This is the best answer too.|`|T4ugfJooaa	Talk to her and tell her that you have feelings for her and such. Don't just jump the gun because she might just like you as a friend, or like you said she may think shes too old for you.+|`|21ToYoBDaa	not necessarily. age is just a number and a frame of mind. if the girl likes u for real then it will not matter about age.|`|Iw3DnDwlaa	its not that different..but she might be little too mature for u...<br>  so try to get a clue if she is intrested in u first or not...|`|tnUhxfjlaa	i think its a little bit too much of an age difference|`|00s31I4Eaa	sorry but to me yes this is a huge leap|`|mvu0yrF8aa	ehh not too much |`|Z5OiDBsDaa	Well if you both really love each other it shouldn't make a different...depends how much you guys care. Its not unheard of but its still a pretty big age difference...If you care about her just go for it

1Rljmocbaa	Come on now, girls do the same thing to men all over the world. Men and women are no longer seperate when it comes to that, but that doesn't mean that everyone of the genders will do the same. I would have no fun whatsoever from doing that, and it's one thing that I have never done. But I am awfully sorry that it happened to you...<br>  <br>  You know... it's ok to cry if you need to?...<br>  <br>  God Bless.<br>  <br>  I am but sixteen... we do exist in highschool..|`|2uxaGUNqaa	I don't really think there is an answer to this question. Girls don't know why guys are the way they are, and I don't think guys do either. It's just how some people are, everyone acts different and if it is a guy thing, guys get affected by it differently. Girls say they don't understand guys, but guys actually say the same thing about us. They think we're hateful and controlling and that our periods are gonna ruin the universe. Come on, seriously. Guys can be jerks and controlling and let jealous take over them and start beating their girlfriends and stuff. But those are only the ones that don't care, which are the cold hearted ones. Everyone acts differently, not just guys. Although, I do think they have a dramatic decrease in being who they usually are when they're around other people. Girls mature faster and we know what they're doing to us before we do it as bad to them, guys are just the tougher sex and think they can control us and take advantage of us, take us for granted. Prove the guy wrong, don't let him break your heart.|`|3gSIZfmKaa	i totally understand! some guys have a problem with expression and perhaps he really does like u but just cant bring himself to really say how he feels. If he tells you that he loves u and intentionally takes back his thoughts and deliberately hurts you then hes a real idiot- plain and simple and you should run in the other direction away from him and his childish antics.  How did he rip your heart out and smash it really? Are you sure that you arent reading too much into what was said interms of him thinking that he loves you as a friend, and not romantically? that could be something to consider too. On the other hand, he probably wants something from you and he thinks that breaking you down with the I love you will work and once your not budging then he takes it back.  Im trying to see it from different angles to help you. Keep your head up--there are way too many guys out there for you to stress about this jerk if he really intentionally hurt you.  In the future, watch how the words and actions of your new beau correlate and if they do then you might end up with a keeper!!|`|zZrWH05Iaa	I am not that way.<br>  But its mostly cause guy's are stupid in general...<br>  Some of them are to busy with fooling there self's that there someone else.<br>  So they hurt the girl over and over again...<br>  <br>  Personally I have made mistakes and I know the pain it causes, but Most guy's dislike me cause I dont want to participate in there foolishness.<br>  <br>  Not all guy's are idiots like that.<br>  Just remeber to discriminate to who you let in your life, girl's make the mistake of going to bed with them the first week of dating somtimes and then they get all screwed up cause they dont realize they gave in to easy to a asshole who only wanted to fornicate and leave.<br>  <br>  but remeber <br>  You're going to be all right. You just stumbled over a stone on the road. It means nothing. Your goal lies far beyond this. Doesn't it? I'm sure you'll overcome this. You'll walk again ... soon.|`|0wkSf58waa	I hate to be cynical...but guys do this. They love the games, they love to laugh when girls cry, they love to make a girl feel like crap. Maybe I'd have a different perspective if it hadn't happened to me so many times. I think most of the time guys don't even know what they want so they just say what they think girls want to hear. I'm sorry someone treated you poorly, I can empathize with you :(|`|nS5juijKaa	please don't judgue us by our worst kind, I'm trying to get with this girl who had this big jerk that if I see him I'll send him to the hospital...<br>  <br>  well because of him she is very very slow in the relationship proccess and is scare in each step.<br>  <br>  so yeah ther're is bad and good in men|`|Bz3EJXlbaa	oh i sooo get where your coming from, guys are complete and utter jerks in highschool. they dont care what cares think or feel. they only are about what a girl looks like or how big her *** is and what size her boobs are. there imature and need to get over themselfs. they could really care less at this point in there life, there gunna regret it when they graduate and step into the big world.|`|QpEHgn0vaa	If a guy told you that he loved you -- and you hadn't already been dating for several months -- then it was silly of you to believe him.<br>  <br>  Lesson learned.<br>  <br>  Some girls are hurtful and deceitful as well, if it's any consolation...|`|DmVngOmoaa	Not all guys are jerks, same as how not all girls are sluts. <br>  <br>  I've been through my fair share of guys that have treated me how you are feeling right now, but it's just ONE guy. You can't base that one guy off of every guy.|`|zcHDY4Y3aa	there guys what do you expect.as soon as they are out of there moms stomach that's what they are like.and they will never change.and they have no feelings unless it comes to them.|`|42cJKAfPaa	One word, immaturity.|`|NQIwNjWBaa	Sounds to me like you are talking to little boys and not grown men. Stop falling in love so fast give it time to grow, so what if he say he love you, dont go loving him because of that. Tell him to proove it in more ways then 5. Ask him what does he love about you, Make them boys explain to you what love is and what it means to them and if they cant explain it then they dont know what they are talking about. Any man that has been in love understands its not something to play with and breaking a womans heart is the worst thing to do.|`|RAzzOqaDaa	why are you generalizing them?|`|x2ZRmaoWaa	i wish i could say more than there not horriable creatuers some guys just want to break your heart but one day they'll have it coming some people can't be helped<br>  <br>  i really do understand how you feel i liked a guy he told me he loved same night got drunk next day forgot everything...i'll never forget that feeling though i can rember it well and not completely over it i just have to move forward<br>  <br>  you should try the same feeling horrid inside just proves he got to you and this guy is most certain not worth your time|`|kJSEiQN3aa	Yeah, us guys can be mean. But not all of us are jerks! Few of us are nice guys. We nice guys will love you for who you are and love being with you and you will mean the world to us. I am afraid you have run into jerks and nothing more. Just have faith you will run into a nice and caring guy and I am sorry for your pain.|`|tG1LLb9Jaa	Sometimes its hard to find a nice guy and no one really knows why guys are jerks. It could be peer presure, or he's just trying to act cool in front of his friends. Also he could just be hurting inside and hiding it with being a jerk. Your not the only one that has had their heart torn to pieces. Trust me! :(|`|OQmU6131aa	dont generalize, i find guys like that to be revolting, im a guy and i would never do that to a girl. im sure a lot of guys may do that, but were not all d bags
ldejLcqiaa	haha just keep bein yourself and someone will come along. im the same way, i never though any girls would be interested because im a different person, but then my woman come along and were happily together for over a year now without a fight. i never expected her to come out of nowhere, and niether will you. its not a race to get a woman, just be patient, she'll come :D|`|xDlBM6N6aa	Well I'm 19 about to be 20, and have only dated one person and that was just last year.

Start out talking and see where it leads to. Some people like to be alone but others need someone else in their lives. If I were you I would get out there and say hi to someone and ask if they would like to have coffee sometime and talk and maybe even a phone number. I have done this and it worked for me.|`|nbv6Z01iaa	I don' t believe that any one person is destined to be alone.  You are young and vibrant at this age.  The thing is, if you are out searching for that special someone generally you'll have a harder time.  There is someone out there for you and they will love the person that you are.  I am hard to deal with and am on my second marriage.  I married the man I was seeing when I was married the first go round.|`|GG2bxCd1aa	It is fine if you are single. If you have been very busy with your univ till date and have been happy with yourself it is completely ok.<br>  You don't need to compare yourself with what everyone else do.

You don't have to push yourself to be in a relationship.<br>  Just be confident and be open to meeting new people, you will soon find someone meant for you.<br>  Good luck!|`|tkVCjeqmaa	Trust me, you will find someone when you least expect it :)|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Become a monk

If No, then the truth remains you can not be friends because although she doesn't want you now (for what ever reason ~ she's testing the water)  she will not allow you to talk to other girls. If however your plan is to get back together down the road, you might as well just do it now because nothings going to change between now & then!

ImgouTRIaa	Stand your ground , doll. Maybe you went over the top on this one , but it was building up and ,POW! I'm sure you will have a discussion with them sooner or later regarding this incident, and tell them just like you did us. Then , from that point on, keep an open line of communication and the first thing that goes awry ,tell them politely, it's not working, and would they stop it. Don't let it build up like you did this time, and wreak havoc with your own life.You'll be O.K. Good luck.|`|AA11033942	I'm not married, so you might claim I'm not a suitable person to answer a question like this. wrong! I have parents that i always seemed to disagree with, my sister is married, most of my friends are married, but a few have since divorced, and being so close to all of them I think I can comment.<br>  <br>  You gotta remember and think about the following:<br>  <br>  The difference between parents and children its a generation thing. and the older your children get the bigger the gulf will be until they're all grown up. How different are you from your partner and how much does he take after his parents or is he completely different? this could explain away a lot in the attitudes department. Personality differences often show up here.<br>  <br>  How well have you taught your kids? because accepting treats from their grandparents, especially when it comes to sweets and stuff, does not mean they have to use them straight away. But as long as they remember to say thank you and all that, means at least you can claim a success in rearing your children with manners.<br>  <br>  AS for having a go at them, well you are in your rights to tell them where the boundary is. Appreciate all the help you can get and are offered. Ask them how they would feel if the shoe was on the other foot and that will get them to pipe down (taking you to one side and suggesting stuff, that's different but outright criticism will eventually cause you to snap) Apologise, and take them to one side and come up with a few ground rules - true this will seem a little absurd initially but in the long term will help keep the peace.<br>  |`|wJOrk801aa	cut yourself some slack girl , we all are born with nerves and no matter whether they are helpful or not , if anyone is commenting or belittling you then they deserve to be answered back. By being quiet we only invite more suffering and appear spineless in their eyes. Why dont you do a sweet surprise gesture for them instead of feeling guilty , like a surprise dinner party ? Im sure they will be pleased.

TfqRIBhLaa	Now being a girl myself i know what is attractive and not attractive in a guy. Firstly what not to do: Don't be mean to her, the idea "treat her mean to keep her keen" is completely stupid. This will just make her think your annoying and an idiot. Also don't follow her around like a love sick puppy dog. The most important thing is don't use silly chat up lines on her she may not like you being so upfront.<br>  Do compliment her on how she looks, girls love compliments it will make her feel good about herself. <br>  Do go over and talk to her but dont forget to keep eye contact and actually listen to her and ask questions about what she says and actually be interested in what she has to say.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped and good luck for the future.|`|k6ufvOzhaa	"Hey baby.

You can always ask them over for a bottle of wine over a candle light dinner by a fireside. Or just ask her out to a movie.

Go on gurlllie with ur bad self! Do what you want- if he even txt u- DON'T read it etc- he's a waste- and if he's STILL BOTHERIN you- halllll out on his ***- that means he still has feelings for u as well if he keeps bothering you about mess.

RuJhWnS5aa	I'm 20 also, and my boyfriend is a junior at a college that's four hours away from mine.  We didn't date in high school but we knew each other.  So far, we've been dating for almost two years long distance, and it's NOT easy.<br>  <br>  Trust is the single most important thing about long distance relationships.  You also have to talk to each other in some way at least every day.  It sounds like a lot of work, but if you want to build up trust, and show that you care, make the effort.  <br>  <br>  Do you ever get to see each other?  If not, make a point to drive to see him.  Yes, it sucks.  But that's what it takes.  And lastly, you need to be able to communicate with him.  If you need some physical attention, tell him on the phone.  Tell him what's in your head, and ask him to be honest with you too.  The one positive thing about all this is that is forces you to talk to each other and become closer friends.  It can never be a purely physical relationship - ha.<br>  <br>  ALSO:<br>  It's not true that men have to have physical attention from women, and if you're not around he'll see someone else.  It's not true.  If a guy is happy in love, he WILL wait for you.  It's not easy.  But you have to make an effort to see each other on occasion and talk on the phone as much as possible.|`|77NzfiVkaa	If you have problems with trusting one another you need to work on that and fast!!! Trust issues break up a relationship like no other, and not just long distance ones, but all relationships. Right now my boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship. We text and talk a lot but also you need to have your own time where you aren't texting him or talking to him otherwise you will start to feel trapped and so will he! Also, make sure you see each other as often as possible. My boyfriend and I try to see each other every other weekend, although sometimes I go three weeks without seeing him. That's all I can really say about it, I hope it works out! Good luck! :)|`|F0uLexezaa	these long distance romances usually don't work|`|AA10526402	You need to communicate a lot so that you know what is going on in each other's lives.  If you don't know his friends names, what classes he's taking, what goes on in his job, etc. (and the same for him of you), then it is like you are living two separate lives and you will grow apart.  So, you need to share and communicate.  Also, visit as often as you can, of course.  Also, I would send him a care package with snacks and a letter.|`|AA11595360	Men arent like girls They cant go on forever without the affection of a woman. Chances are he is at least flirting with another girl or more. More than likely he has already cheated on you. Im a man and men are pigs. <br>  Im sure this is not whay youwant to hear but its what you need to hear. Find a nice guy where you live now.<br>  --O^O--|`|67EaIAvbaa	renee sorry to hear your dilemma..i can feel your pain.I know it must be really hard,especially when you love the person.The first thing i would definitely work on if i was in yours and his shoes is the non-trust..that could be extremely dangerous and if it's not resolved at an early stage it will get drastically worse.Resolve that immediately with him.The next is do whatever it takes to keep in touch until you see him,rather it be by text,computer,whatever it takes.You all need to see each other.I don't know really what to say except i care and good luck.|`|yyldv2olaa	the most important thing about this is just loving each other and trusting each other, i live in italy and my wife lives in california.<br>  <br>  we hardly ever see each other, but we don't doubt eachother and we love eachother.<br>  <br>  in the case of high school sweethearts... i'd drop it, ya gotta live a lil bit and experience new people *shrug* you can still love eachother, but you're not 'lovin' eachother as it is so whatever|`|9t1taTCtaa	Hey there I am in the same situation, just that I'm 22 and my boyfriend is in Korea. He is a Military. We have had problems on and off for 2 yrs. We also have trust issues. One good thing is that we still see eachother. Do you have a laptop with camera, Does he? That can help, you may both see eachother while talking. Another thing is calling but not soooo constantly, cause than it gets boring... On vacation time you should go see him. or vice versa.. Well I honestly hope you both the best!!!!! Wink wink!!!!|`|51843c451ddb1dc1decc4f236d232ca8aa	Communication is key.<br>  Trust is also key because if you can't trust each other then you don't have a relationship. <br>  Lots of emailing,texting,phone calls and visit to see him should help you get through it.|`|GUlFatGZaa	Long distance is though. Only people that deeply love one another and are committed will make it. That being said, obviously see eachother as much as possible. Try cyber and phone sex too ;-)<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|JcOOvjIZaa	send pictures back and forth even though he is probably cheating on you....u should just mention ending the long distance relationship and he might tell u what he wants|`|6wjjxeeOaa	Well there's really nothing you can do to change the fact that you live away from each other. But what you can do, is just remind him every now and then and you do love him dearly. Text him one thing a day, something sweet, and different. Something that will make him smile. Or just talk to him, tell him how you feel, about what's running through your head. If it's meant to be you'll see ! If you really care about him and are in love with him then girl don't let him get away ! I'm saying this because I am in the same position. I'm in Texas and my Fiance lives in Louisiana, I rarely see him. But I try my best to keep us together. We've had our ups and too many downs. He's tried to walk away but I don't let him. Because I know what's best for him and me.<br>  <br>  I just wish you the best :) Really I do, and honey you are not too young !!!! You're right on that age :) Don't listen to anyone that's being negative. <br>  <br>  Email me if this helped at all.|`|bQCfOftxaa	hello!<br>  long distance. man can i relate.  for the first six months of our relationship, i lived here (in canada) and he was in australia.  some days it was super stressful!! but now looking back i'm SO thankful for that time we had apart!  we learned how to communicate SO well; how to read each other's tones (voice), how to interperet silence, to be direct with what we were saying (international phone calls are expensive on cell phones! and then there was the HUGE time difference!) because there wasn't always time to 'drag'/'talk' things out, learned how to encourage each other with words and to really 'hear' each other with what we were struggling with.  we used snail mail too: it was so fun to get a packages in the mail!  it also gave us a chance to grow as individuals and to not rely on each for our self worth, we are young too - 21, and so finding that confidence is so important!!  <br>  as far as trust goes - i never questioned him.  as soon as you assume that something is happening - huge walls go up!  if we were struggling - missing physical contact or just simply being together - we told each other. and we found it helped so much to talk about it!  <br>  so i hope that gives you some ideas.  also we liked to plan/scheme together.  think of crazy ideas of things we could do once we were together: whether it be going on a trip or buying something new - it gave us something to look forward too!<br>  best of luck to both of you!! long distance relationships are hard - but so are all the other types of relationships - they just have different obstacles (for example, couples that live with each other often complain that they don't have their own space)<br>  keep it up - you guys can work through it!|`|sm5jgItsaa	on the hole long distance relationship don't work you have lasted this long then you have some thing what you need to do is move in with him don't know what is holding you were you are but if it is going to work you need to move and be with the one you love i have been with my  gail for 20 years we work on it all the time she has three kids that we raise thay all are good kids it is a lots of work there is no way that it is not work you will find this out as the years go on im 50 years old and still working on it is a full time job good luck hope this helps you and your love one

AnfbrZFuaa	ok. something that works for me when I'm around my best friend, who i've been in love with for about 3 years now, is forget that i like her when i talk to her. it might sound dumb, but it works. or i think about another girl that i like. either or, they both work.<br>  <br>  what i'd do if I were you, is find out who he likes. call him up, or IM him. just slip it in your conversation. like say "hey, who are you liking these days?" if he asks why, say you're just curious. A hint that he likes you (which i think he does) is that he'll ask you who you like, and make you tell him first. that's normal. just make him swear that it wont screw up your friendship, and make him tell you who he likes before you tell him. trust me, it'll work. that's how me and a girl that worked with me became boyfriend girlfriend.|`|J5vBQ5I0aa	ok iv been like that before, being shy totally holds you back esspecially if hes shy too! but what you need to do is just be brave, act ur self! be talkative, if u dont no wot to say just make something up to say, anything could work you just need to look past the shyness cos i can tell u now not being shy is the best cos u can just be ur self :)<br>  good luck!
xKZTQ3Iyaa	I say tell him wtf are you thinking he has a girlfriend can girls be any coldhearted I mean im no't trying to sound mean or anything but it really needs to stop tell him that's all up to you follow what you think is  right i mean put yourself in her shoes how would you feel if your boyfriend was doing that to you? think here it's not right you may like him but he's not single if he was that's way different.|`|nWVRFqBNaa	Im really not trying to be mean honey..you are not even friends with benefits. You are blatantly helping him cheat on his gf. Its not right. You dont have to tell him anything. You are the one with the upper hand as you are assisting him with cheating. Girl, thats not right. Now, how the hell would you feel if you had a bf and he was cheating on you? I mean really. Its girls like you that make girls (including you)  think that there are no good men in the world. You kno this is gonna bite you in the *** rite?  Karma comes back to you hard. Stop doing that to that girl. Be a lady..have more respect for yourself. That label "Friends with benefits" y would you even want that? Your body is more precious than that. Tell me what the benefit is honey? only one benefiting from this is him! he has two women that he's just looking at as a piece of ***. Next thing you kno someone is gonna have a disease. How sure are you that you are the only one that he's having sex with? I mean really.|`|nbv6Z01iaa	let him go and be with her.  If he likes you he'll dump her and make you his new girl.... but will he do the same thing to you|`|EZHZW7QFaa	He is unfaithful to her what makes you think that he is gonna be faithful to you if he leaves her. I don't know why you are even settling to be like a secondary option to anyone. You are lowering your standards and dwelling on someone that doesn't have your best interests at heart. He is heartless and undevoted to a girl he should "love" - you don't deserve someone like that.
yLYoKu79aa	With guys gentley is not a term they understand.  Unfortunately we only understand a solid break.  So, you need to say what you mean and be very clear.  Then you have to stop communications, answering his calls, texting, or writing emails.  If you continue communicating he will always think there is hope.<br>  <br>  He'll get over things and move on as long as understands it is really over.
iPNOVR6Gaa	Some guys have thick skulls combined with big egos.  He seems to think it's just a matter of time until you go back to him.  Why do you keep talking to him?  It's time to cut him out of your life like the cancer he is.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	He's an immature loser and you are encouraging him to continue to be a douche because you keep taking his calls.  Move on.|`|7MJSPGnhaa	I have a BRILLIANT idea!!!  CHANGE YOUR NUMBER!!!!  Stop taking his calls and he'll stop calling!  You know he's not right in the head, you dumped him now stop entertaining his advances and move on with your life!|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Move on with your life. If he gets what he wants. He will eventually leave. Dump the scumbag. He may have a venereal disease by now.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	You asked this questions yesterday. He is your ex...stop answering his calls. You are both playing a very immature game.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	Sweetie, he hasn't changed.  He only wants what he wants and he doesn't want to inconvenience himself but he thinks nothing of inconveniencing someone else.  That little stunt with the dating website is a perfect example of that.<br>  <br>  Why are you wasting your time even communicating with him?  He's not interested in being your friend.  He's only interested in what you can do for him and what he can get out of you.  Since he knows it's not sex, then he'll use you in other ways as long as you allow it.<br>  <br>  Tell him to stop calling you and you stop taking his calls and responding to him.  <br>  <br>  Being a good person doesn't mean you have to be his doormat and it doesn't mean that everyone has to like you.|`|WU6pTTvCaa	Why is he like this . . . because YOU let him be like this with you!  You realize he wants to be with you, but wants to have sex.  If that is not on your agenda, then move on.  He is expecting you to be the one to change your mind, but don't expect him to change or mature.<br>  <br>  I would have guessed the guy was somewhere between 16 - 18 years old giving your description, since his (and your) actions seemed very 'high school'.  You need to move on and look for a mature person and leave him behind.  You are keeping your self in this cycle with him, he thinks he can make you jealous by sleeping around with other women or having you check them out on the internet.  I would have just told him no at that point.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	You are playing hard to get and he views that as a challenge and wont quit til he "gets" you. He also needs very much to grow up here before even thinking of entering a serious relationship. What you need to do here without exception, is to tell him him that you no longer want anything at all to do with him. Hes a little boy and you need a real man in your life, and he just isnt mature enough for you at all. Sure it might hurt his little boy feelings but its worth it if you lose him for good. he will be alright but you do have to be very stern with him or he will continue this forever. I can also guarantee you one thing that IF you were ever to have sex with this little boy, he would never talk to you again afterwards. Tell him and be done with him once and for all. Good luck
C6QyEtWvaa	wat kinda music r u into? wats ur fav food? tell her a funny story etc.|`|0aTTeDQPaa	the girl have gotta talk to you and take the lead to ask YOU questions.<br>  or else she might as well not be as interested..<br>  its easier to talk to someone about things u guys know (groups of frds, etc.) it connects u two much much easier~<br>  but if not, get to know each other but i mean u gotta let her feel that you dont haf a motive when you ask the questions.<br>  ask her simple things like what you like to eat, fav colors, find some common interest tell her your stuff.<br>  its cooler to ask about past experiences and stuff like that but i mean be careful with the personal questions~!|`|CDMTteeYaa	Hmm..

jmlAmr3gaa	OK, from a guy much older and wiser than the kids in your class, and a lot of the people here:<br>  <br>  You're VERY pretty, and will get prettier still as you get older, judging by your features.  Your pronunciation issues are almost certainly cute, to a guy who likes you, and if a guy doesn't like you anyway, well then that won't matter.  Big Boobs... different guys have different preferences there, but I only a few very weird guys would rule out a relationship with someone based on their boobs not fitting their own personal "ideal".<br>  <br>  If no one else has told you that before, the guys in your school are idiots, with the exception of that one guy who obviously took time to notice you.  Since you seem to respect him at least, you should definitely see where that goes.<br>  <br>  Hope you feel a bit more sure of yourself now.  Hang in there and follow your heart; this stuff gets easier as you get older.|`|AA11879456	Please! Don't worry about being 15 and never had a boyfriend. That happens to many people. I didn't get a boyfriend until I was 16 (and only 2 days shy of being 17). Not to mention, I know an 18 yr old who has never had a boyfriend still. So don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  Oh and btw, you are not ugly at all (= You're pretty|`|YS2I9y2haa	You're not ugly or anything.. but I'm a girl so I won't say anything but advice.. *shivers*<br>  <br>  OKay.. I think that you have a low self esteem. Maybe you could do something fun, like a hobby of some sort. You'll meet guys there. And there are tons of people who don't even date until their 16! Don't worry about it. Your time will come. <br>  <br>  And people are shallow if they won't go out with you because you pronounce your words differntly.<br>  <br>  Don't think about all your bad stuff. Think about some good factors. You have awesome eyes, and if you curled your hair it'd look cute! Go to your mirror and tell yourself 10 things you like about yourself. And trust me, lots of guys are perverts and probably like your boob factor. *shivers again* But try not to think about that. <br>  <br>  Anyways, just keep up the self esteem, and try to get a hobby, you'll be alot happier. Good luck!|`|Vm0iVpYPaa	You are pretty darling. Try doing something else with your hair like dying it or changing the style. About ur speech, be condfident about it.

It's a complicated effort to like other people or let yourself be liked if you don't properly like yourself.|`|XdUL0PXmaa	Are you kidding, you're really pretty! Lovely eyes, don't be so down on yourself!! I'm 15, and although quite a few people in my year have had boyfriends in the past, most are single, and most of those boyfriends weren't serious, just a kiddy kind of thing - hook up over MSN, never see each other, forget you're even meant to be going out type of thing. So I wouldn't worry, honestly!|`|7Q6edIEoaa	You're a pretty girl!! Get confidence!! Guys find girl's that carry themselves with confidence more attractive then the ones who don't. Don't listen to other people's opinions about others, make your own judgment. You seem like a really great person because you stand up for people & all but to some that might come off as a little boyish. Just be your own person & never think any less of yourself for it. Also being 15 & never having a boyfriend is no big deal. relationships at that age honestly are pointless, they usually never amount to much. I didn't get into my first relationship until i was 17 years old, I was in that relationship for 4.5 years. Just spend as much time with your friends as you can because that's the only thing that really matters.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	I didn't look at your pictures because I know what it's like being 15 and thinking you are ugly.

I was so pretty with clear skin, and shiny hair. Not a blemish lol.<br>  <br>  I hated my teenage years, when I was younger I moved about a lot so I had a completely different accent to everyone else and had a problem with my 'r's too (I'm tongue tied).  Not only this but I was a swimmer and dancer so I was as flat as a pancake and was convinced I looked like a boy.<br>  <br>  Take this note as a compliment and please try and feel good about yourself x|`|tIDNEwdMaa	You are pretty.  I have a weakness for girls who wear glasses, so I think you are very cute (dare I say "gorgeous"?) in the third picture.  At 15, it's not unusual to not have been in a serious relationship.  In fact, it's probably not a good idea to be in a serious relationship this young.  Don't let it bother you.<br>  <br>  You have a feature that can be both a blessing and a curse.  Those are some seriously big boobs!  A blessing for any guy who gets to play with them and a curse for you because this will be the first thing most guys notice about you.  You have to learn fast how to tell the difference between a guy who wants to date your boobs and a guy who wants to date you and thinks the boobs are a nice [possible] benefit to the time with you.  This is another reason to not rush into serious dating.  Learn your foe and learn your friend.  This takes time.|`|pVaZty4Maa	don't worry there is surly a guy out there that will date you one day you just have to be patient and let him come ot you, you got your whole life ahead of you....|`|mWV3hUNLaa	haha me too! i think that your glasses compliment you <br>  your hair is pretty...  geez you have big boobs when your older you might think of getting those smaller bc big boobs sag faster and could cause back problems....good luck|`|dd9559c1e59d3b44217363867d81b42baa	I think you should<br>  talk to him.<br>  Forget what everyone<br>  says.You look like a nice girl<br>  to me.

Try to act more feminine or emotional? Just guessing.|`|SNCeFeY1aa	i think you look really pretty, especially with your glasses|`|PC4Qul9Gaa	DO NOT FEEL BAD ABOUT YOURSELF! Confidence plays a big role in relationships. you have to be ok with you, before someone else can be ok with you. Does that make sense? <br>  I didn't get my first BF until I have 17. Then I had a flood of them until I found my hubby. Don't rush it. You have your whole life to day..|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Why are you so concerned with how popular you are and how popular this guy is? does it really matter? If you like him , go for it! And if he has said he thinks your pretty thats all you need to know. Stop worrying about what you look like and spend some time with this guy.<br>  <br>  I didnt have my first boyfriend till I was 19 so don't feel that you need to rush things coz all the other girls are opening their legs for guys. Thats how you end up being a teenage mom on benefits or something. Take your time.|`|E9KlTYThaa	Maybe he sees something special in you.  Besides you can work any look.  You don't have to be a blonde barbie.  There are other ways of getting a man's attention.  Like try being pleasant and fun.  He'll adore you. Unless he's a pathetic loser, then don't do this.|`|2dd5ead8a0ebfd17db4114329eae540caa	Your not a ugly person at all so don't worry about that. Boys are young,silly and immature.Take your time with them and don't rush into anything. So guys just want to use you.
HdTImVGfaa	Well I can say that  loving your cousin is not a sin but if you decide to date her then that would be a sin and yes god did tell people to  love each other as you would to yourself.

She is odd.|`|94bb1416c45dabb6f5300d63ad9eee26aa	Being nice doesn't get you anything. She's just using your for free food and drinks.<br>  <br>  Job of a guy is to figure out the nature of the association. Maybe she just want your attention, maybe she just want to practice flirting so when the right guy shows up she'll know what to do, maybe she really likes you, and in your case, she just want free meals. <br>  <br>  Once you figure that out, you should know what to do. Remember, everyone is guilty until proven innocent.

Lzk24WGcaa	Try something "new" and exciting, like having sex out in a public place, or going out to dinner wearing no underwear.  Or if you really want to get him going, suggest inviting another girl to join you two for a 3some.  No man can resist that one!|`|AA10873763	What's "wrong" is thinking men always want it more.<br>  Everyone is different.|`|2eGMXYaIaa	Are you guys mormon?  Ha ha.  I think you guys need to broaden your horizons, keep things fresh.  Sometimes sex gets so routine, it almost loses it's value.  Change it up somehow, get him stirred up.  You should hold off and it will make him want it more.  People just want what they can't have!|`|ckjZnqHRaa	..who knows darlin really?...surely you're quite extremely fabulous looking and whatnot...and he's not totally stump ugly or nothing.....<br>  His ears are too big maybe...but beyond the superficial really?...he should be prideful and happy to be with a woman of your character with such fine high libido sweet sister...what else darlin?<br>  Ask him what the difficulty is honestly.<br>  Maybe a trip to the doctors office for a physical or a mental health evaluation might bring the dilemma to light.<br>  If I were your husband sweetie?.......well?...you know!<br>  You wouldn't have a moment to get dressed and showered sweetie.<br>  Good luck!|`|TrmGBloHaa	Its a Myth that Men begs for it...  depends on person to person...

Otherwise you wouldn't be doing it as often or when you did do it, it would not be that great.  <br>  <br>  Maybe it's not that he doesn't want it, but that he just doesn't want it as often as you do.  Married life is a big adjustment and can sometimes be difficult to get used to.  Different people deal with it in different ways.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps you should talk to him about it and find out what he is willing to share with you.  The most important thing to keep a marriage good for both people is being able to talk to each other.|`|4sNC5io8aa	Listen I am a 48 year old mom. My daughter is grown and married.<br>  <br>  There is several reasons why he may not "want it" anymore.<br>  <br>  1st do some soul searching, and ask yourself some questions.<br>  1. are you pressuringg him to have children and maybe he is not ready?<br>  2. Is he depressed?<br>  3. Is he working long hours?<br>  4. Is he gay?<br>  There is so many reasons Honey. But the best thing to do is sit down with him like two MATURE adults and do not point fingers.<br>  Just simply ask him if he is ok if he has been depressed.<br>  He will follow I am sure with the question "why do you ask."<br>  This will open your door for your question. Just tell him you love him and will understand, but that you want to work through what ever it is.<br>  <br>  If you make accusations or put him on a guilt trip it will not work.<br>  <br>  Physically I see nothing wrong with you personally. You are a pretty girl. But you see none of us live behind your doors to know how you act emotionally. As far as your personal relationship with him.<br>  We only know what you tell us.<br>  If you want this to work and I am sure you do... Then you have to be very mature about how you approach him.<br>  Marriage is hard but its worth it if you work together.

Most of the more quiet, shy, respectful boys will be a better fit for what you want,  but you will have to go out and find them.|`|koR11afdaa	You will find someone that will love you for the you are. And besides that girl  is only useing them boys for a piece of a*s. she will regret it one day|`|sM3BHxvVaa	not all men are asses why dont u try it with me and see how it works|`|1z7BXkajaa	I know its hard for you to go to an all girls school and not have any guys to be around. You don't really know what they are like or how they act, unless you have brothers. Just go out and if there is someone that interests you then start a conversation. It seems difficult to do but its really not. Not all guys are the same. So eventually you will find one that fits your "criteria." Until then just test the waters. And as for your little **** at school...don't worry about her. She just likes to much attention...bad, nasty attention. Please don't act like that. Its disgusting and downgrading. BE yourself.......GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!|`|50073dbd5ecac430d78adbf7aa450341aa	Well, I am not sure if you are asking about what to do with the mixed race girl (mulatto is the correct term, by the way) or how to get a boyfriend to be with you.  I choose, because I can, to answer the second question.<br>  Have you talked to boys your age?  What is it you are looking for in a boyfriend?  And I have to admit, if you were overheard saying that all boys are ****, then I probably would not have an interest in you either.  You have to make that connection.  I read your complaint about others, but nothing about yourself.  What are your interests, what do you like to do?  Find a group that likes to do the same thing.  As boys get to know you, and open up to you and you to them, they will come to see you in a different light, to find you knowledgeable about what interests them, what makes you stand out in a crowd for them.  Don't put others down, make yourself higher to stand out in a crowd.  When you get older, you will find no one likes to be around a complaining person.  <br>  Good luck on your journey, hope this helps in some small way|`|AA10438397	In the long run you will end up with someone who loves and respects you, the other girl with end up wishing someone loved her (but her reputation will firmly be established as just a piece of a*s.

jYBl7AVQaa	he has a girlfriend? don't be a sideline hoe and don't feel special because he flirts with you. Boys always do that. Wait until his girlfriend catches him cheating with one of the other hoes and then you make your move. Not now. It's not a respectable thing to do.<br>  <br>  I know I won't get best answer for this but I have to keep it real. I was the sideline girl before. Felt right at the time but when it's over it feels like shi*|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Just sit down with you too all alone and tell him. Or when he says that he fancies you, then tell him you feel the same way as well. This way you actually don't need to say how you feel but it is like you are returning the gesture with almost the same results. He will be happy with both answers.|`|CaRKCpMqaa	Don't, if he has a girlfriend leave it. If he's single go for it, tell him on msn or text him much easier that way, just something along the lines of "Hey i really like you how about hanging out tomoro?"<br>  good luck :)|`|Ab29gQTzaa	tell him over email or phone and say it proper sweet trust me and that you proper mean it ty for the comment|`|673B37CKaa	Just tell him over msn<br>  <br>  Just say I need tell you something and please don't be weird about it.<br>  <br>  and just be honest.|`|UnpxpOKTaa	Next time he flirts with you, just say "Too bad you have a girlfriend!"<br>  <br>  Or you can mention something fun you two could do together, "I love to ____, We should ____, sometime.

DWwv3v9Raa	I would, I'd rather be with someone that was celibate than with someone who jumped from bed to bed. Seems a bit safer to me.|`|8Vz9JF7paa	No I wouldn't because I dont believe being celibate is the right way to go into a relationship... being intimate with someone is not just sex its getting ot know them on an entirely different level.|`|AFx0PCGvaa	you should be celibate yourself!
lNlL0Ag2aa	It's all about the looks and attitudes for every guy who tries to see the girls' first impressions, sometimes guys are allured by what the see and by what their eye candy does.<br>  <br>  Guys won't know that your faithful or voluptuous until they know you and sometimes, if you give them the wrong first impression, they probably won't bother to know you enough to see that you're the perfect girl.<br>  <br>  The stuck up girl can win if she makes a first impression in which guys don't see how stuck up she is but get the wrong impression of her.|`|67ThRN4Taa	Angie, the way that you describe yourself describes my fiancee--and I love that woman!!

Guys do the same thing.  Don't stereotype.  You go back to your cheating ex because she's willing to sleep with you while the respectable girl wants to wait: explain that one.<br>  <br>  Point is, people hide who they are when starting a relationship.  Then they either turn out to be insecure, unable to commit, or one of countless other flaws that make a relationship impossible to continue.  Enter the complaining about not being able to find a good (flawless?) guy.|`|O2s8tLQzaa	im not talking on either side, but what you're doing now, was exactly complaining her, what's the difference?<br>  <br>  yeah, asshole got guts which good boys don't, they're full of inspiration, not so lame comparing to good boys. Good boys only live under their mom's toe, and recognizing the good only. <br>  <br>  But bad boys (you must specify which type of "bad"), had many experiences, either good or bad, either fun or sad, they had seen both white and black. That's why they may decide faster, braver, and not so lame comparing to "good" boy.<br>  <br>  "Bad is not always bad, so does the white is not always white"|`|crw44vnRaa	IDK maybe their all gluttons for punishment.

AA11033942	If you have been dating that long, doesn't it seem a little odd (from an outside point of view, I definitely think it does) but... why hasn't one of you proposed yet? three years worth of a relationship must mean you are good for one another and should make a leap of faith towards a permanent relationship, of which marriage is the big one.<br>  <br>  The fact that you may have met online makes little or no difference, because nowadays in the modern world its just another medium in which to reach new people. Long distance does make a relationship harder to keep up, but if it can be made to work then good for you, but the odds are not stacked in your favour here...<br>  <br>  If either of you have children from previous relationships, that's another complicated factor, but not necessarily one that will break you apart, this might even be a link to bring you closer together...<br>  <br>  On all of the above details, I have a personal interest because I met my last girlfriend (who is american but a massive anglophile - I'm based in London UK) through the MySpace network. There was a whole romance going on and it was detailed in a whole saga that's almost worthy of a trashy romance novel. She came over to London twice and I went over there once, but 3-4 months after I came home our relationship came to an end because of the distance (and other more complicated factors I'm not detailing here) but mostly because of the distance.<br>  <br>  Life's hard, and meeting the right people makes it easier - but discovering who your real friends are is even harder, and losing the ones you thought you had is a bit of a dog - but it's rewarding when you do get the right people - good friends and the right partner.<br>  <br>  The truth is you can only wait so long before it becomes apparent that the relationship is either going to completely succeed, which brings about happy complications in planning your life together, or is doomed to failure. What you have to do is meet up - somewhere neutral between your hometown and his - and have a heart to heart to discuss how you both want your relationship to proceed. If it ultimately proves to be a no-brainer at least you'll be able to walk away with your head held high in the knowledge that even if it fails, at least you tried.

nnwbxPKfaa	Damn you are having some really bad luck right now. I feel bad for you. Just try to hang in there hun. Maybe you can talk to your guidance counselor.

Those are just technical things that help people get lost and waste time, I am not saying it is bad. If you want you can always try it.<br>  <br>  As I understand it is not the waste of time that you need. I do feel bad for your situation. God isn't the cause of all these things you have listed. God is a belief you chose and follow in your life. If you are really God's follower you shouldn't stop believing in him because he puts you through this. It is meant to make you stronger. Life is balanced, when you lose something you should gain something new.<br>  <br>  As for your boyfriend, I do not have much to say. If you have broken up with him just few weeks ago and he already has new girlfriend he isn't worse hurting.  <br>  <br>  I think you should accept your life as it is because there is nothing else you can do. You will be rewarded for your pains and aches later in your life.<br>  <br>  <br>  I can understand that you need this advice, you are searching for resolutions and explanations, but we people on the Internet are not the ones to support you through this time. I would talk with one of my parents or friends. I believe it isn't the best solution to put this kind of problem on the internet.

It won't always be like as life has lots of ups and downs.  <br>  <br>  If we didn't have the rubbish times we wouldn't be able to appreciate the good times.<br>  <br>  Try to remember that we don't get given what we cannot handle.  <br>  <br>  You are not pathetic at all as it takes a lot of courage to come forward and admit that things are getting on top of you.<br>  <br>  The things going on in your life would upset us all especially as you are losing your grandad, your rock.<br>  <br>  Your studies are important and if you can find the strength to get through them you will find that doing the best you can will make you feel better.  Perhaps there are some exams that may be taken at a later date if you feel under too much pressure, but you need to discuss this with someone at your school.<br>  <br>  May I suggest that you write your thoughts and feelings down in a journal?   Sometimes just getting it all off your chest and down on paper can really help.  Or type it on your computer and save.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a close friend to talk to or it seems like all your friends lead carefree lives (the don't), then could you join a club where you could meet new friends and do things together so that you whilst you are out having fun you are not focusing so much on your woes.<br>  <br>  Your parents will always love you even if they are in new relationships. <br>  <br>  Hope things get better for you soon and hope to hear you gave it your all with your exams. x|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	Making lemonade out of the lemons life has thrown at you is a nice sentiment but will not address the healing that YOU need.  The veritable train wreck that your life is in (through no fault of your own) has left you devastated but alive,   Firstly, do whatever it takes to fall out of love with your ex-b/f.  Focus only on those things that are truly important--your heart will tell you what they are.<br>  <br>  I have been in a healing process for a long time and it has taught me that fear is the opposite of love, enabled me to return to God and return to love, how to ask and believe in miracles, and how to change reality by changing perceptions.  I truly understand, that none of these however can substitute for someone to hold you in their arms, take in you sobs, and tell you that despite everything, you will be OK.<br>  <br>  In  February of 1984, I heard and taped a lecture by Rabbi Harold Kushner on "When Bad Things Happen to Good People",   I did not get it until 22 years later.

It sounds really hard, but don't rebel, because it will make it harder for everyone to cope. Don't worry about your boyfriend, he is obviously not such a great person if he leaves you at a time where you really need support. Just try and get through it all. And this will sound really cheesy and cliche but maybe get more involved in a hobby or something, to try and release your feelings in. eg music or painting|`|oFUqegjfaa	I'm sorry to hear this. Believe it or not you aren't the only one going through these problems and it could always be worse.  Be grateful that you parents are still alive. Be grateful for all the time you did get to spend with your grandad. Right now, things are so bad that you are just thinking "what next"?

By all means do not give up!<br>  <br>  Right now I see your are going through many changes.  Probably too much to handle.  Calm down and breathe.  Whatever is going through you experience it then let it go.  IF that doesn't work, take a time out.  Go for a walk, see a movie, hang out with a friend(s) or better yet take a trip. Take as much time for yourself to get back to your normal self. The people in your circle be it your friends or family will understand that you had mini-crisis. It happens to the best of us.<br>  <br>  When you feel better, talk to your parents and/or talk to your ex. Also, keep supporting your grandad through his time of illness.  I'm sure he will appreciate it.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.
50073dbd5ecac430d78adbf7aa450341aa	Good question.  I would say, having been married for 9 years, that if you go to a bookstore and open up a cookbook, there must be a thousand recipes for meatloaf!<br>  Don't worry, when the right one comes along, you will forget all about hot dogs, and enjoy the meatloaf.  Some of us are extremely lucky in that we did not get meatloaf, we got Prime Rib with all the fixings!|`|315asbf6aa	Actually I like meatloaf more than marriage some days.<br>  <br>  I've heard it called a sh*t sandwich.|`|sLLgERQWaa	My husband loves meatloaf.......and what a silly thing for that person to tell you.|`|Mf1anWtDaa	don't have any exp.|`|x4aSep6maa	Well, I love meatloaf. So does my husband. <br>  <br>  But I like to think of marriage as more like a fine wine (or Scotch as my husband would prefer)) that needs to mature.

Great wines are over 30 years old. |`|a53bce9219af673cd64d4e553a66ca66aa	I guess its true of this somebody's marriage, but not all married couples feel that way.

Youre a bad roomie.|`|AA12323302	Yes because if you guys live together, you should share responsibility and maybe he feels that he does it the most so he wanted you to do it since you were the last person to put something in there seeing that it was obviously getting full.  That's like being the last person the drink from the juice carton seeing that there's only literally a drop in there and putting it back in the fridge, throw it away!  That's common sense...just take out the trash if you see it full.  No one wants to live in filth.|`|33d7210d104ceb5ac8526a1cc2d5871baa	If the trash was full, then just take it out.

Having roommates can be tough and you both need to share in things.  So, save the argument in the future and just get rid of the trash without someone asking you to do it.|`|9Zx6uB34aa	well if its mostly his trash in there then he should throw it out but if its mostly yours you should throw it out and if you cant decide on who should throw it out why dont you just take turns your room mate does it one week then you do it the next.|`|2MdtxjEAaa	Yes, You should have just told him ok & done it.

Good Luck!|`|KsaaEZqHaa	Perhaps mentioned what a great time you had on the first date - say something like (for example if you'd gone to the cinema) "So-and-so-film was really good! So what have you got planned for next week?" It might act like a prompt... !|`|n0sHQr7caa	I would say he should ask you out if he wants to reschedule. you shouldn't do it. i mean if he had to cancel then he should reschedule it. but if it has been a long time after he had to cancel then maybe he doesn't like you anymore.|`|H1zusQ8raa	If he's shy you should bring it back up.  Just kind of ask him on the same date as before so that he'll realize its more like rescheduling.|`|gJPlY1ADaa	i would say let him be the first to reschedule since he canceled...|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	he is married or has a gf|`|uBssj3Znaa	Why don't you just ask him out again. There is no rule anywhere that says the guy has to do it. If he was excited about the date and still talks to you, then he probably likes you. If you like him, take the initiative.|`|Rb087BsAaa	he doesn't want to go out with you.  get the hint.|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	It should be him who reschedules and the fact that he hasn't done so might be a sign that he may have had a change of heart.  Don't ask him again because then you will look desperate and stalkerish.|`|e98RKB35aa	It is okay to ask when he is available next time. It isn't pushy what so ever.|`|QcbgIBghaa	he should be the 1...if he really likes you, he would|`|JXrvbW7caa	He's just not that into you, sorry.
nqyDxAleaa	if u want to move on so be it. If u think this won't affect you then go for it.<br>  As for the way sex feels, usually when you have some type of connection with someone its suppose to feel good.<br>  but yeah I agree with everyone else, first time isn't always the best<br>  <br>  btw 16 isn't too young to have sex. I dont know why some of these people are saying that. You're almost grown. I believe that if you protect yourself and take responsibility for your actions u should be able to do whatever u like.|`|6wjjxeeOaa	It's a great thing that you don't regret it ! If you don't feel that connecting don't force yourself to feel it. Been there done that. And it was horrible ! Move on, but don't go thinking, hey well i'm not a virgin I can do it with anyone i want now. NEGATIVE ! If you do plan to, use protection :)   <br>  <br>  So do what makes you happy :)<br>  I would suggest end it.<br>  Ignore all the you're only 16 blah blah blah !<br>  Hey people have different hormones !<br>  People are different PERIOD. Just<br>  ignore them, and don't let them get to you.<br>  It was your decision hunn, and you can decide<br>  what makes you and keeps you happy.|`|6CPFRnGraa	It's not a bad thing to not feel a connection. I didn't the first time I had sex either. Maybe you just did it at the wrong time. It's nothing to worry about though. Just don't start sleeping around to get that feeling, it will happen at the right moment. No need to rush into find the love of your life :)|`|GuNBgiEWaa	i only wish that all the teenagers that wonder if they should do it--could read your question.  <br>  i can't tell you what you should do now because i don't know anything about you and your partner.  i suppose you have to do what you feel is right for you. <br>  good luck|`|McfrauFnaa	Perfectly normal. not everyone experiences love u know. sex isn't that big of a deal to some people. it's your life, do what you want kid.|`|ncUhlwevaa	Yea. And it's normal to feel that way. Just move on. He was your first, take it for what it is and do what you feel is right.|`|9FoFYfvdaa	well if u feel nothing..<br>  then move on..<br>  sex is a big step to a relationship..<br>  im 16..<br>  and i feel that conection with my man..<br>  if u dont feel a conection..<br>  i say move on..|`|y2nC8BUGaa	You're too young to be having sex anyway.|`|HhaadKixaa	Your first time although they say it should be special and with someone you love is more often not the case. Millions of people experience their first time with someone only to be let down.Your not alone. Hence why mothers say "WAIT"! I think many teenagers just feel like they have to experience it and get it out of the way. Many people never see or talk to their first again with no love lost, just taking away a awkward first time as a memory you wil never forget. I met my Husband at 15 and we've been together for 13 years and have 3 kids . Im sorry to say when I lost my virginity before I met him it was not memorable, I felt no feelings and it was quite awkward..lol..but I felt like I was missing out. <br>  But know you can learn from this and move on;) Never regret anything though,because at that point in time it was exactly what you wanted.|`|xDlBM6N6aa	Well first off just to open your eyes to alittle something...my mom was 16 when she got pregnant with me, and she told me she was pregnant from having unprotected sex.  So, use protection!!  <br>  <br>  I'm 19 and still a virgin, but yeah 16 years of age wasn't a time when I ever thought a thing about having sex....but obviously in your case it's different.  <br>  <br>  Just be careful with your actions, and talk to your mom about all this.|`|ghbaAWOCaa	wait wait rewiind..your 16...had sex..and think its ok just coz you trusted him?..so what..is this guy not your boyfriend, i mean..sex isnt some kind of a problem breaker for a relationship. So what if the sex wasnt good...doesnt mean the relationships doomed?|`|BqcyxZhtaa	well i don't thing that you should move on i think that you should talk to him. was it his first time.... he might was NERVES.. and didn't want to hurt you.. did he want to have sex with you...|`|nJvnsXplaa	You don't 'trust someone for the most part'..either you trust him or not<br>  Off topic I know, I just had to say it :D|`|JDiTHSoUaa	Yall should be friends with benefits. Its going to work GREAT .|`|98LDN0Quaa	Arent you the BJ question too?...busy day huh?|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	The fist time can be really traumatic as both people have perhaps unrealistic expectations coupled with the fear and the excitement of the unknown.  Passion is the key,  It fuels the desire for the other person and gets you out of your head and into your body,  You know where your pleasure palace is, so it is time to find and exploit the pleasures it will provide you as you move on,|`|uLHtXibRaa	At 16 you really have no idea do you? And you have missed the whole point?...If you feel like this..you did the wrong thing..thats what happens when you have sex for the sake of sex..its can only have a deeper meaning if you value it in its proper place, and yourself..you have sex with the person you love you cannot have sex once a suddenly that switches on a love button..it does not work like this and at 16..your to young to be fooling arond with adult things..children are not emotionally mature enough to deal with these things..|`|e98RKB35aa	With sex you need that connection. The first time is always like that. You feel it but you don't feel anything at the same time. As the connection builds between you and him the sex will get better trust me.  Use protection though because I don't think you are ready to have a baby yet.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	...the first time doing anything usually ends up being an awkward occasion for everyone sweet sister....even sex!<br>  Try not to let one episode of sex ruin your whole entire idea of the orgasmic principle of it anyways.<br>  Sex is supposed to be fun darlin....<br>  Sex and love and closeness are supposed to be enjoyable for you appreciably...not a dull numbing mindless experience for you honestly.<br>  Don't give up on love and sex and glorious moments of robust feelings darlin...you're just gettin started honestly.<br>  Hang in there sweetie....and keep an open minded positive outlook on your own self created experiences with sex obviously...what else huh?<br>  Good luck darlin...email me if you need more...k?|`|tBqVnItZaa	wow 16 way toooo young to be having sex or even thinking about it <br>  <br>  <br>  *but to litlle to late* tey grwoing up first|`|71e4c99bdb3d30e1e3a590d2a8520a6daa	well first time aint always the best i must say !!<br>  <br>  humm...use protection and if u dont feel ready yet or u don"t think this is the right person then just move on!!

That way you can talk to her privately- even if her friends are close (chances are she'll tell them what went down in 2 sec. anyway). Just ask her if she wants to go out to do whatever and name a certain day. Chances are she'll be flattered that youre interested|`|DxL3u9spaa	just ask her if you can talk to her alone.. and then ask if she wants to hang out sometime =] (don't call her or message her or anything. ask her in person or she will think you don't have enough courage to ask her out)<br>  hope this helps <br>  and good luck =]|`|hF6uZqWRaa	you can either call her or if you want to do it in person... step to the side and ask her if ya could talk for a second... if she or her friend dont move away..either gently grab her arm and pull her to the side or say "alone" ...|`|2DbnttgXaa	call her name, get her attention, ask her if she wants to go out sometime, for a smoothie or icecream or whatever, ask her then (:|`|Wrn6WH7xaa	Call her, facebook her, or msn her.|`|JAf2M10oaa	dont ask her out!|`|endgX6Saaa	call her and tell her that you would like to hang out sometime.|`|WvevK4n0aa	send her a sms|`|AA12274148	Slide a note into her locker with something funny on it, and a day you'd like to hang out with her, girls like guys who make them laugh. <br>  Send her a text asking her to follow these steps, and lead her to where you are. When you have her alone, ask her out. Or you could just play secret admirer for a while, as long as you don't make it too creepy. After a few messages or surprises she'll by intrigued and want to know more about you. I'm sure you could get her number if you try hard enough.<br>  That's all I got.|`|k6Ip2kfGaa	Yes, I'd say call her or, if you find that too scary, add her to something like MSN or Facebook and start chatting. After some time, ask her out in a maybe.. jokingly(I mean not too serious) way or something, or tell her about this movie you're dying to see and if she's seen it? No? Why don't we go together? XD<br>  Something like that. Whatever you do act breezy and confident, don't pressure the situation :)|`|zCbGwgxRaa	in my opinion the best way to do this is to write her a letter an express to her how you really feel about her and then you should ask her to go out with you|`|bEaJHY1uaa	ask her to go to the movies make sure she knows you want it to be only the two of you... i would make a direct statment that you want her alone but dont sound freakish|`|WsiT3rsFaa	Just ask where ever you are wait for the group to start walkin then you slow down say her name she'll turn and suddenly your alone with her for how ever long it takes you to ask her to go get drinks or whatever|`|IhIXtf9yaa	either call her and ask her out to the movies on a date or  call her and ask her out on the phone there are many ways to ask a girl out email me if you need more info|`|QNG0zkQRaa	contact her though email, myspace, or just ask her if she with somone you could steal her for a second....then, theres your chance, ask her.|`|dd9559c1e59d3b44217363867d81b42baa	Facebook her..*the new way I heard*<br>  Or just be up front with<br>  ask her out.|`|J79ecFcPaa	uh...call her sweetie n set up a date maybe..or juz call her n talk to her dat way =]|`|n6pQAbFiaa	call her but if you are too nervous text her...

What i did, i just came to him and kissed him :) And boom!!! he waited for me to do the first move. JUST GO FOR IT!!!!! GOOD LUCK
LxvA4vGpaa	It is really questionable......I am not sure.  I haven't really been faced with the issue.<br>  <br>  I don't think it would necessarily be an end-all to the relationship, but I would demand that all debts be paid off before saying "I do" and I need to see change in how they handle their money.  <br>  <br>  I understand how easily it is for someone to get bad credit, especially when credit card company's are throwing cards at kids that are barely 18 and haven't even had their checking account for a two months yet.  I understand that people make mistakes and things happen.  Jobs get lost and what they used to be able to afford (like the car or apt or house they live in) and all of a sudden, they can't...but those bills are still there.  It isn't like you can go "Oh nevermind, I can't afford this car now, take it back"<br>  <br>  They would have to be seriously showing effort to reverse their credit and better it and they would have to be showing me that they aren't irresponsible with their money.  <br>  <br>  I would say no if they had bad credit and were doing nothing about it, nothing to change it.|`|816d37cef0be9068ccda207a4dc9967daa	HELL NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO|`|AdeD0xMuaa	Yes. People make mistakes when they are younger.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	No.  Look, horrible credit isn't just some independent thing that resides in a vacuum.  It means things.  It means at least that the person is irresponsible, and if he's irresponsible with money, he is probably also irresponsible in other ways.  It means he doesn't plan ahead.  It means he considers the pleasures of the moment to be more important than the consequences to come.  It means he is probably bad at delaying gratification, a skill all functional adults need.<br>  <br>  Horrible credit is a serious red flag.  Most people who choose to ignore red flags later regret it.|`|b552f8c9544b98d905c574a9b981e2c4aa	Offhand, no.  But on further reflection, it depends . . .<br>  <br>  Horrible credit to me would indicate someone that is not able to make responsible decisions for themselves.  Why would I want to take on the burden of that person's bad decision making, not to mention the debt that person has already accrued?<br>  <br>  The only exception to that (hence, it depends) would be that before I marry the person, I'd probably have a good idea of how they managed to get ***-over-heel in debt.  Maybe there was a tragedy in the family.  Maybe they were briefly unemployed in the debt mounted up.  So while I guess I wouldn't say "no" right off the bat, I'd  have to have  more information.|`|x3LclBZ0aa	if they had bad credit thats not due to just irresponsibility or purposeful negligence then yeah, why not? everyone deserves a second chance and the to be given the benefit of the doubt.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	i'm not sure.<br>  but this i am sure...  i'd never marry someone that would base her decisions of marriage on my credit score.|`|0ee4bfdaab9564dc9d539b29997544ecaa	I did! We both have bad credit, but are working to fix it together.|`|AA10500537	no never  when you marrry , his credit is your credit , <br>  i;d think twice before i say  I DO|`|krQiDGCHaa	It depends on WHY their credit was bad.<br>  <br>  For instance, if they happened to have no insurance, was in a bad accident and had to leave work for awhile, I could understand that.  Bills pile up, and then you have to pay your medical expenses out of pocket, and you can't work for awhile if you're injured, etc.  I'd definitely understand that, and wouldn't think twice about marrying that person if I loved him very much and he treated me right.<br>  <br>  If, however, the bad credit was due to opening too many accounts and splurging and purchasing things you couldn't afford -- then it depends on how MUCH debt and poor credit they had.  If it were a few thousand dollars of mistake and they realized where they'd gone wrong and were repairing it -- sure.  If it were like tens of thousands of dollars in debt -- no way.<br>  <br>  Also, another thing to look at is maybe someone's credit is damaged because they got laid off, and unemployment only pays a portion of what you used to make.  So, you're struggling financially and paying what you can for bills while trying to find a job -- understandable.<br>  <br>  I think there is much more to it than just good credit/bad credit.  I'd find out the reason and go from there.  Be reasonable. :)|`|UKqJiIlGaa	maybe, if they were trying to fix it and i saw improvement|`|fznvQptlaa	no, makes a huge difference for yrs and yrs to come|`|AqU180claa	no, because if he can't manage his money. Then you know that he won't be able to manage the money any better when you get married. Most couples now days fight because of money.  So if you have your money in order, then there is a good chance that you will have your life in order too as well.  Check out Dave Ramsey.|`|YyVGXt83aa	Definitely not.  My wife had terrible credit and there was a reason behind it.  She worked that angle to get everything in my name to run up a bunch of debt and once I quit giving she split.  Now to keep my credit good I need to pay it all off.  She really knew what she was doing and screwed me over good.|`|zIMoBfuvaa	love is love. you shouldn't love a person for money. If I loved the person, I would marry him regardless of their credit score.. and if it was bad I would just do everything I could to help improve it. So yes, I would!!|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	Yes, Marriage is not about money or what you can buy together it is about love, and commitment and nothing else.. If it is that improant to you then you can buy a house or car before you get married.|`|tbJraueLaa	ya know, really, 10 years ago my answer would probably would have been no.  but today that answer would be eliminating 95% of the country.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	I would never get married to someone with bad credit. It took years to build up my excellent credit. I need it for my business. I don't want someone dragging it down.|`|gZpeoy1Qaa	You can if you want to all you need to do is show your spouse how to control their spending. If they can be helped it will work.|`|EJWphb88aa	Well depends if i love him... i will marry him... coz credit can get even more worst after if months or yr of marriage... so i feel its not good to decide marriage based on credit|`|6cm6MB66aa	Yes being im not looking for someone to take care of me . But if your young just starting off good credit is in your favor .|`|UU1YR1Kaaa	Yes I would that is not a reason for not marrying someone.  Everyone deserves a chance at happiness.|`|ecNeN0staa	Wow, some of you are so vain and materialistic that it makes me sick to my stomach.  Love has no boundaries, people!|`|UFOdwXgfaa	Hell NO !<br>  <br>  A credit score says alot about a person|`|jr5EgB2Taa	Yes, BUT keep your debt and his debt separate FOREVER.  Do not co-sign loans, do not buy a house until his debt is clear, don't get credit cards together, etc.  <br>  In the end, if this is your soul mate then money shouldn't end it.  His moral character should be the only determining factor.  But on the other hand (there are a lot of buts in this case) his mismanagement of money is a sign that he can be irresponsible.  Make sure that this part of his life is in the past and he is able to hold down a job (2 years or more at the same job) and working toward paying off his debt before you ever consider saying, "I do."<br>  You marry a whole person, including their relatives, finances, their past, their future, and their motives.  It isn't a decision to make in a short period of time no matter what the situation is.  Waiting develops understanding and character.  It also gives you the chance to see if they are going to change and revert to past behaviors.<br>  I am so glad that this isn't you!  Hope you enjoyed the food for thought.|`|ANOasnOmaa	Is that what's important to you? Go with your gut.|`|RBRq8406aa	i have to agree with many of the posts that should not base marriage on someone credit score. Please if your going to base it on that let the other party know so they can find someone that they can drop you like yesterdays news. Not saying that finances are not important but to look at someone credit score and then decide if should marry them is too much akin to gold digging. That is basing marrying on assets rather then who you love.|`|b34a54682dc09f70279f26554322d78aaa	Only if he is working hard to get things better ... and only if his credit is bad because of something that can't be avoided (such as unfortunate accidents or unemployment and all that).  My bf has a so so credit, but he's working very hard to fix that and he's very open with me about it.  And in my eyes, everyone deserves a second chance so as long as he works hard to fix the problem and actually has something to show ... then yes, I will marry him,|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	Yes, but only if they agree that I control the funds, make sure bills are paid and agree to an allowance, which can be modified upon agreement.

But she was just better.|`|chlvKoXqaa	if they were young and stupid about money, say under 25, because there's hope with the right woman they would learn wisdom and get their act together, make a plan and stick to it, but if they were near 30 forget it--i'd say by then that's just their poor character.|`|LW1OIy6Daa	i think that if you love someone no matter what he looks like or how years is he bigger,love is the most important thing.and maybe you sholud decide because it is your life and you are going to live in it.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	When I was in my early 20s, I did. This marriage didn't work out (not necessarily because of credit).<br>  <br>  After I found myself single again, I was in my late 20s, more established professionally and socially; my standards were different. At that time, I wouldn't consider dating, let alone marrying, someone who was financially irresponsible. And yes, I know that some people's bad credit is caused by some tragic unforeseen event (a need for expensive medical care, for example) - but, let's face it, in most cases it's a consequence of making bad decisions and of being stupid, inept or irresponsible. <br>  <br>  In short, 15 years ago, the answer was yes - at present time, the answer would be no.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Yes. <br>  Apparently I did. ( I did not know it at first...took me a couple of months.)<br>  It has gotten better though.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	why is the credit bad?  how old is the debt?  have they learned anything from their past or is this an on going problem?<br>  <br>  the answers to these questions will tell you exactly how responsible your partner is and whether or not they are a good risk for a long term mate.<br>  <br>  In general, no, I would not marry someone with horrible credit because it is incredibly easy to correct credit problems and if they haven't managed to do that and change the behaviors that got them there then they will always be a danger to your financial future and you will always struggle as long as you are with them.|`|7MJSPGnhaa	No because I think someone's inability to proper hand their finances speaks volumes for their moral character.  People who are responsible and mature pay their bills on time and don't rack up debts they can't afford to pay!  <br>  <br>  Proud to be married to my husband who has a 800+ credit score when we said I do....he goes out of his way to make sure that they bills are paid and that is family is cared for!!|`|1F6ZnYtXaa	Yes I would. As long as their debt was completley paid off at that point. As long as he is a hard working man, that is something we can work on throughout the relationship. My man knows hes horrible at managing money, so he lets me take care of that stuff (even tho I'm not that great either!) But for me that is not a deal breaker.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Yes. I don't think credit has anything to do with it. However, my friends and I joke and say we will check the guys credit before we get married again. If we ever get divorced.
cXtEx98Haa	Yes, I think it is.  But be careful, she is showing she is a slut, isn't she?  She's with another guy and you're probably happy she seems to want you, but that's the kind of slut behavior some chicks do just to cause problems.  She might sincerely want you, but still, her BF wouldn't be too thrilled if he knew about this, and it's your head that could have potentially been caved in.<br>  <br>  Added:  This is hilarious.  I guess it makes sense he meant crotch.  I had a picture of a babe on crutches caressing this guy's leg with one of them.  Still could be, huh?  If he did mean crotch, does the question really need asked if "this was a 'way' of flirting?"|`|ckjZnqHRaa	....maybe she was just so way involved and in tune to the club music and you were just simply the most convenient cat scratching pole at that very given moment too or something partner....who knows?<br>  Did you get her number?<br>  ..BTW?....did you mean CROTCH...or did she really rub you up with a CRUTCH?<br>  It's not nice to take advantage of the disabled ya know!<br>  ...LOL!!!...you tell me dude!|`|xXGn1zfsaa	She was itchy that's all.|`|ftyfYQsfaa	she rub her crotch on you?
gNomUwkzaa	Poor you. I can totally relate to your situation.<br>  <br>  Trying to please parents is a trying task, believe me. I am the same age as you and I feel like I have to work so hard for their approval when really this is the time to be making your own path in life, right?<br>  <br>  First of all, you love your fiancé, right? You guys are in that relationship for eachother and not to suit anyone else, that is your right as an adult. I know when your family is religious it is difficult but she has no right to dictate whether he should be circumsized or not, if he converts to Islam, or how you decide to raise your children. It is not her place. She is entitled to her opinion, but she cannot enforce it, or 'nag' as it were. Please don't let her put strain on your relationship.<br>  <br>  Try sitting her down calmly, with a strong head and explain that now you are an adult, your 'curfew' should be extended, and that you are taking responsibility for your own education, and life. You are not a child anymore.<br>  <br>  Make sure to do little things around the house. Cleaning, tidying, maybe doing the food shop now and then and keeping your room tidy will undoubtedly go unnoticed. <br>  <br>  You may have to grin and bear it until you can afford to move out, put unfortunately, you can't pick your parents!<br>  <br>  Best of luck with whatever you decide to do!|`|9ab7c5b30122db984710185845f90cbfaa	This is a tough one.<br>  <br>   As a parent i can see a parental view and as a guy who was in a home with parents that drove me nuts i can sympathize. The thing is you have little choice. Like the person above said you need to tell her you are an adult and are able to take care of yourself. The problem is you obviously are not if you are still living at home. (Sorry ...parental point of view). As for your religion and the religion of you someday kids don't worry about that right now. It really isn't your moms business and since you don't have kids yet it doesn't matter. <br>  The "hubby to be" thing is probably a big deal to your mom since you are only 20. Yes i know how you feel but you are extremely young even if you feel all grown up. <br>  <br>  You wont realize how stupid you were till you are 40 and have 20 more years under your belt and you will look back and be amazed at the stupid s#*t you did at 20 LOL. Ultimately she cares about you so the best thing to do is to actually grow up. Get a better job and your own place. If you cant cause of school then you have to be willing to admit you are not truly ready to take care of yourself. <br>  <br>  Once you are you will find that you will laugh at her nagging and you will find out that even if you are married and 30 you still need your parents help from time to time. When you are truly ready to handle the world on your own then you will have some leverage to work with. Until then you can try sitting her down and explaining that you are a big girl now (she still sees her little girl and always will) and you need to make your own decisions. Be prepared for a fight but if it comes down to it you might have to explain it to her more forcefully ..... <br>  <br>  If it gets to that point she needs to be faced with a strong you something along the lines of<br>   " Mom, you taught me well while i was growing up. If i need your advise or help i know you will be there for me but you have to control your emotions and stop attempting  to dominate my every move  I am capable of handling my life and making my own decisions and you can either accept that we are different people with different points of view or I will have no choice but to leave you in the dark and make my way in life without your advise. Either way I cant have you belittling me or making me feel bad for my choices." <br>   <br>   Hope this helps it is the best i can do right now|`|AA10423186	just  tell  here        i  hope  get  better

0wkSf58waa	I know I'm not a guy but I can most definitely respect your point of view because I too share this ideal. I wouldn't want to date a guy who didn't have a stable job/future because that is reflective on where his priorities have fallen. I am working on my 3rd college degree and I would appreciate someone who respects that. I will be honest I would want to date a guy with a college degree and a career as opposed to someone who's future is unpredictable.|`|QXtTGln8aa	Thats funny,i guess we all different.|`|zhaHc4FAaa	I understand your concerns and you make some very valid points however in the defense of women...never judge someone based on their job.  You never know, the waitress may make more money in tips than someone who works in an office as a receptionist.   I do believe that when you date someone you should find out what their goals and aspirations are in life and that will tell you alot about the person you are with.   I believe that sometimes circumstances in life haven't made it possible for the person to attend school or perhaps they are raising children...remember not everyone is gifted with the ability to attend college but it doesn't make them dumb or stupid.  Some of the most intelligent people in the world never went to college.  You have a right to your preference but you never know what someone is capable of if they were given the opportunity to be more....some people are where they are because they don't see any other way out due to rent, bills, or circumstances.  Keep an open mind with people after all how would you like to be looked down upon as not good enough to date because of the money you make?|`|qfAQXYKIaa	no..you have just reasons for wanting what you want, there's a difference from being a jerk adn simply having preferences regardless of contrary answers your likely to get
Snq2sO9vaa	you just need to talk to him and explain that you messed up and you know that but you really want him back and you promise that you wont ever mess up like that again..tell him that you love him alot and that he means everything to you and then just talk to him about it...but you also have to see it from his point of view not just yours....guys have feelings too and they tend to deal with things differently....so yeah./.

(This was a really difficult question) :)|`|c5g2YN0Baa	If you've broken up more than once, you should at least date a few people before going back to her. The more you date (and when I say "date," I mean do and share things with someone), the closer you come to developing what you really want in someone. If it's her, try to find out what causes you to have such conflict. It could be that you love a lot about her, but for both your sakes, you may need to grow apart and love other people.|`|3648e98700b8351146e2b5699bd638ecaa	how old are you son?|`|W30MOowuaa	Maybe you both need to sit down alone with out interruptions and talk.  Get everything out in the open on how you truly feel about each other and what caused you to break up. <br>  Obviously you both still have a lot of feelings for each other so talk, there's no commitment in talking. Maybe you both can come to mutual agreement and get back together.  If not then you go each your own way and live your lives. And you can still be friends you just won't be spending as much time together, and there's the chance you might.<br>  Try it talk to her see what happens. |`|conExdA6aa	This is always a rough situation. You are in limbo and have no closure, because whether you're officially dating or not you always have one foot still in the relationship. There aren't any easy answers. Just keep talking to her and let her know how you feel. If you want to be with her be 100% committed and be honest about it. If she can't say the same to you, then you both really need to move on and stop being on this constant roller coaster.  I know it won't be easy. But good luck!
C8DOT8Y7aa	Remember the last time you fell in love. It wasn't when you were near the person, it was while you were away, thinking about them! So if you're constantly around her, she'll lose interest.<br>   Make sure you make her think about you while you're away. Always remain a bit of a mystery. This way she won't lose interest too fast. For example, if you just met her and she asks about your job, give a few details but don't go over board because she will probably ask you about it some more herself, making her feel more included in the conversation.<br>   Don't say your name unless she asks. If she does so, it means she's interested in you. Don't be afraid to talk to other women in her presence. Show her she has competition. But at the same time, treat her just that little bit more special than you do them. NEVER make negative remarks about another woman, especially your ex-girlfriend. Get to know the girl.<br>   Find out what she likes and dislikes and make a conversation out of it. Be aware of what you're doing. You may not know that you're going on and on talking about something you like.<br>   Some girls get bored to death really quickly! Always try to make her smile. Girls like guys that are sensitive and not afraid to crack a little joke every now and then. Marilyn Monroe once said that if you can make a woman smile, you can make her do anything. Always make sure she's OK.<br>   If she's sad, find a way to make her happy. If she's happy, help her stay that way, so that you both can have a great day. Don't let there be too much of a silence. She'll think it's awkward and instead of walking with you she might run off with her friends where she knows she can talk.<br>   Act naturally, without giving the impression you are actually changing yourself to make her like you. Be confident without being cheeky. Show her you can handle being the center of interest. To achieve this, you may want to work on your conversational skills. Stay away from cheesy lines like "Your father must've been a thief, cause he stole the stars and put them in your eyes". Show her you're interested in her by saying, for example, "I like your shirt".<br>   If you feel she may like you back then move on to complimenting her looks slightly - but not in a perverted way. Tell her she's beautiful or that she has nice eyes. Don't feel obliged to talk to her every time you see her. A simple "Hi" is enough, then get back to your business.<br>   Don't refuse making small favors, but politely say "NO" to big ones until she's done something to deserve it.<br>   Borrowing a pen is fine, but driving half an hour to her house just to feed her cat needs to be deserved first. Make her work for your approval, not vice-versa. But only a little, sometimes let her feel like she's making you work for her. During a casual conversation mention you'll be doing something fun this weekend, like going to a new club. Continue the conversation some 10 minutes, then say, "It was nice talking to you. Gotta go." Always put kisses (not an over the top amount though!) this will shows her you like her and also hints at more than friends. Take two steps, then turn around like the idea just popped up in your mind and say, "Hey, you wanna come with me?" In 8 out of 10 cases she'll say yes. Some girls however aren't into parties and such like, so perhaps suggest going for a walk together (if you have a dog ask her if she'd like to join you sometime) or maybe going into town etc.

Try different ways if you feel uncomfortable like, him arching his back, or him sitting close up with you and holding you. He could also hold your hips to help develop a motion or rhythm.

AA12321514	Many Westerner ladies are not rude. But yes there are some who are rude. I am not shooting arrow in dark here. I am an Indian and have been to U.S, lived in Chicago and Saint Louis.<br>  <br>  Ones who are rude have most likely had bad childhood. Their parents were obviously rude to them so they learn nothing but the rudeness.<br>  <br>  That is the case for not just women but also for men all over the world.<br>  <br>  It all depends on how we are raised.|`|kbz5S3waaa	HAHA! It's not just the ladies that are rude, our men are too. Your issue is that we can speak and act just as equally as our men. We don't submit to every penises whim, and that bothers your culture, but the way you restrain your women bothers ours.|`|POHWTDPRaa	You know, some of us men like women who tell it like they see it. We actually enjoy that particular behavior. How about that?|`|7MJSPGnhaa	We are rude in your mind because we allowed to have a voice in our society.  Your cultures treats women worse than they treat their animals.  In our society women are treated as equals and men (for the most part) love and respect us.  And we return the favor because we know we are loved and appreciated.  It might make YOU feel like a man to use a woman as an incubating whipping post but that doesn't mean you are actually a MAN!!<br>  <br>  Valerie exercises her 1st Amendment rights to free speech, if you don't like it why not find a forum that agrees with your chauvanistic viewpoints and leave this forum to real men?|`|BC2CNH3jaa	We have a place we send men who don't behave properly towards others.

In America, men and women are equal in their rights to talk to who they want to and to act the way they want to.  If you can not handle that then you need to return to your country.  Our women are not rude, they are self-confident and independent which means they can say or do what they want.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	maybe it is considered rude in your culture, but here women are equals as it should be and not "afraid" to speak their mind.  This is the 21st century.  Not the cave man era.  Women are to be respected and not a man's property.  The sooner you learn that the better you will get along with people here.  Perhaps you would be better off just going back to where you came from.  Some day you will learn respect for all humans.  Women are to be cherished and loved....If it weren't for a woman then you would not be alive....I don't mean to insult your culture, just your ignorance.|`|3iNobwVraa	Awww.

TE FELICITO, me gustaría   tener  un  hermano  como tú. <br>  Lo que te puedo  aconsejar  en forma personal es que converses con el y  le digas que tu o estas apoyando y que te preocupa  lo que le  esta  pasando, ya que se llevan tan bien, <br>  Y que le digas de mi  parte  que  ni  un  hombre ni  una  mujer le solucionan  los problemas   a  uno,  solamente uno puede llegar  a  sentirse  muy bien  hasta que  reconozcamos que  tenemos problemas y que tenemos que  analizarlos y buscar  la mejor  manera de  sentirnos  mejor con uno mismo, Si se puede y  que   Dios  me  los bendiga por   ser  como son.

Además, necesita de la aprobación de los demás en cada acto que realiza. Suele tener una imagen distorsionada de sí mismo, tanto a lo que se refiere a rasgos físicos como de su valía personal o carácter.<br>  <br>  Lo primero y principal es ayudar a que tome conciencia de que está mal y que necesita ayuda. Si ellos no toman conciencia y no deciden hacer algo por su bien, todo lo que hagan los demás va a ser inútil. Pero por lo general nadie ayuda a nadie, las personas aprenden a ayudarse a sí mismas, con el apoyo de los demás. Luego de que tomen conciencia es conveniente que visiten a un profesional.<br>  <br>  En lo cotidiano, debemos buscar por todos los medios alentar a las personas con baja autoestima. Nunca apresurarlo en su toma de decisiones, pero si hacerle ver que si no eleva su autoestima nunca logrará sus metas, sean cuales sean.<br>  <br>  La persona con baja autoestima es una persona que necesita constantemente aprobación, por lo que no debemos hacerle ver sus errores de manera brusca. Es mejor ense?ar con ejemplos prácticos cómo corregir su conducta errónea, para no da?ar más su nivel de autoestima.<br>  <br>  La autoestima es un aprendizaje. Requiere quererse y respetarse uno mismo, es algo que se construye o reconstruye por dentro. Esto depende, también, del ambiente familiar, laboral, del círculo de amigos y los estímulos que estos ambientes brinden a la persona con baja autoestima.<br>  <br>  Y por ultimo, si ayudamos a alguien a elevar su autoestima, también estaremos aumentando nuestra autoestima al sentirnos útil para los demás.<br>  <br>  |`|KuJemeTZaa	No les hagas caso a todos estos, la unica manera de ayudarlo es preguntandole si le puedes ayudar y demostrarle que puedes y debes ayudarlo por que para eso son hermanos y se empieza desde luego preguntandole que le pasa y diciendole que lo notas cambiado y te preocupa.<br>  <br>  Si de verdad te tiene confianza y cari?o te dira lo que escribio, la mejor menera de desahogarse y obtener respuestas a ello es hablando.<br>  <br>  PD Viva la familia!!|`|MOMYMTkZaa	  ................. se nota q sta medio triston!!...pero weno hay q levantarle el animo nada mas!!!!!!!!!!!!............<br>  ...........si lo conocs bien tnes q saber q es lo q le gusta hacer y tratar de ayudarlo a q se divierta o al menos no dejarlo tanto tiempo solo para q no piense boludecz!!......tratar de demostrarle q la vida es hermosa y q hay q aprobecharla tanto con sus momentos desagradables como los agradables!!!!!!!!!!!.........<br>       ........consolarlo animarlo noc podrias empezar con eso  no?????...........<br>                   SUERT:-             |`|c4ffprHbaa	bueno este es un caso delicado con el cual no podemos jugar, mi consejo es que hables con el enserio y le expliques sobre el amor es cierto que todos nosotros queremos tener alguien a nuestro lado y nos desesperamos porque no hay alguien, dile que el amor llega cuando tiene que llegar no antes ni despues, el amor no se presiona llega solo y no se basa en caracteristicas fisicas, animo tu puedes.|`|d8Q9EZgqaa	dile cosas lindas, no lo molestes mas, presentale amigas, abrazalo dile que es el mejor hermano etc etc ;)|`|2koo6Lavaa	No debes tenerle lastima ni nada de eso, solo empeoraria las cosas.<br>  Subele el autoestima...

tYO2Ir1oaa	I don't think it's creepy, as long as you do it in a nice way. No girl can resist a well-thought out compliment. Don't sound cheesy, just say something like, "hi, i've seen u on this bus a couple of times and thought i'd say hi before i run out of chances because i noticed (insert something non-sexual, like a badge of a band she might be wearing, or cool trainers etc) and thought u seemed like a cool chica (say with cheeky smile!)". Take it from there. If she's a great girl u can chat away, even if she slips in the fact that she has a boyfriend, u can just joke, "damn, i missed out there"- she will love that even if she's shy or if she doesn't fancy u, then u still have ur dignity and just tell her to have a good day and to not be shy to wave or say hello next time.

Get all of the middle men out of the way because matters of the heart are serious and you want to make sure all information is correct.  Ken's friend is human and it's possible for him screw up something ken's said or you've said so that's first thing.  Second you finally have your chance. You're available and technically Ken's available.  Maybe you should start off by going on a couple of dates and hanging out so you can get a feel for each other.  Then take it from there.  The main thing is that you guys need to get together and find out where each other's head is because all this he said she said mumbo jumbo will only get you in trouble!

Don't ignore it because he might think he shouldn't have said that then he might not do it again for a while so what i would do is say something back like " i wouldn't mind if you got me wet " or " that would be ok if I got wet " Cause your stating that really if he got you with the hose you wouldn't mind.  How he takes it can be clean or flirty.  But if you think that's to much you can say something else but defiantly respond.<br>  <br>  Good Luck

Dont tell him straight out that you like him because if hes doesnt like you back it could ruin your friendship.. just talk to him.. hang out with him and your friends take a slow.. go from hanging out in big groups to little groups and then just you too. Invite him over to your house to play video games (if you like video games) or to the park to hang out or even the mall with a bunch of friends. If you guys hang out in a big group and he tries mostly to be with you then theres a hit. Dont get to clingy (attached) , boys dont like that. hope that helps<br>  <br>  My 13 year old brother helped me out with a little bit of it, he said thats how he got his girl.. (ps he said dont be to mean either or try to show off by sayin bad words some boys hate girls with foul mouths)|`|WDLnNm7Maa	. He will try to be with you anytime he can.<br>  2. Makes eye contact during conversations.<br>  3. Compliments you a lot.<br>  4. Is there for you whenever you need to talk.<br>  5. Talkative, nervous, smiley, etc.<br>  <br>  He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you, Watch his actions around other girls and see if he treats you differently.Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, The wrong kind of guy might say he likes you without meaning it; if this is the case, he probably wants to see how far you would go with him, for any of those activities (whatever they may be) themselves and for bragging rights among his friends. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck ,bye|`|0RmvOA6Jaa	Well, i know you probably know this but the best thing to do is probably talk to him. get to know him, you don't necessarily have to tell him that you like him but just talk and find out about him(hobbies, friends stuff like that) if he is "flirting" with you then i would go ahead and go for it. life is all about opportunity. well i hope that this helped you at least a little. um if u want to e-mail me we can talk more about it if u want. well ttys my email is mr_boy92@yahoo.com|`|s13Lwnq4aa	Awwwww! lmao. I'm guessing you're in 6th grade or 7th at the most. :') <br>  Uhm, I'm not a guy but, I have been told I have the personality of one.<br>  I wouldn't assume he likes you, but don't freak out and get jealous if<br>  he does like that girl. Try talking to him, ask him about homework or<br>  something then work into a conversation. Not that hard love. Good luck.<br>  <br>  He might like you. ;D|`|KG4m0l5Uaa	OMG!!! don't tell him yet because you wanna be for sure that he likes you and is not just a relay good friend. i made a mistake like that before  so just tell him i enjoy your company, we should hang out more then see what he say! and be careful not 2 get hertz but enjoy your self you only live once!!!!!|`|l18jsspOaa	Well just talk to him like a friend and build up your relationship with him.|`|ka2Qo6cgaa	Shouldn't you be in school at this time?|`|FNVxgiDZaa	I'm 13.. Just ask him, you wont get laughed at :P trust me. :)|`|ZuprqjMoaa	..................|`|71e4c99bdb3d30e1e3a590d2a8520a6daa	wink at him =D<br>  <br>  <br>  well dont go and confess ur love usally kids around that age make fun of girls who do that so wait for him to make the first move =D|`|K9hVqE7Haa	Invite am to a date tho dont expect some serious relationships at that age im 13 and ive got my heart broken around 3-4 times now...|`|56O0inIeaa	yeah like george said serious relationships usually don't start around your age. If you think he likes you and you feel pretty confident, you should try to tell him upfront that you like him but that approach has some negatives. If he says he doesn't like you then that would be an awkward moment. I suggest you get close to him first until you're comfortable with the situation and then tell him.|`|endgX6Saaa	i'm a 13 year old girl and boy...this happens to me a lot. Boys are just natural flirts, but take a chance! Don't ask him out though just give him hints like i told my bf before we were dating that i had a crush on him then within the next hour he asked me out so...hope it helped<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s. if you have a cell phone and he does too try texting him.|`|GsRpZJX5aa	man girl you should be staying away from boys  <br>  you are too young and guys are soo stupid that age|`|mDBHMJPjaa	hee digs you go for it see what happens
cyh8uhAnaa	You shouldn't completely leave here alone, or you might leave her worse than she is now...try building up her confidence and try to make her the type of person you like to be around. Help her build social skills, and that way you can join one of those cliques with her. For example: while you're talking or hanging out, bring someone else in the conversation, then invite another person, and another. You will be helping her without her noticing if you're talking about a good topic. Try exercises like these with her, and before you know it, every day you'll be with her and a bunch of other girls.|`|AA11113970	Join after class groups/meetings, etc.  Go to parties that may be happening in your school.  Don't let the one person stop you from making other friends.  You are not responsible for her.|`|19d5770cab150410883b6c4338772a48aa	insecure and controlling maybe|`|GzXDRRYLaa	ppl are weird who knows|`|AA11481603	I would continue to be friends with this girl as long as there isn't a lot of friction, but now allow her to keep you from meeting other people and making friends with them. She may be insecure and showing it by trying to control your friendship with her, or she may just be controlling, but give her the benefit of the doubt and try to make the friendship work. As for cliques, they are just groups of friends with similar interests. If they are anything but that, such as belittling others or excluding others, then you don't need them anyway.|`|pqd6CFuxaa	you should DEFINITELY branch out your friendships. high school is tough. the more friends you have, the better. just try talking with some other girls. find out about them. all people want is to have someone to listen to them. so be a good listener, and they will be the same. don't try to put on an act. be yourself no matter what. don't loose sight of who you are. because if you so, then you wont be able to have any friends because no one will know who you are. be true to yourself. and if nne f the girl's friendships last, there's nothing wrong with hanging with the guys.|`|EbCsHW9saa	Why don't you both seek friends together and separate?  <br>  <br>  Seems this way you will both make more and still have each other - though maybe not so smotheringly.<br>  <br>  I stayed away from kids in cliques.  They always seemed to become pregnant teens when I was an army brat or the unhappy housewives as an adult college graduate.|`|YwbsGtBaaa	If you still like your friend you should stay friends with her, but also make other friends at the same time. You need to set your other friend straight and tell her that she is not your only friend, but don't just ditch her. You can make other friends by finding a common interest or saying something funny to get a conversation going and then hopefully it should flow from there.|`|5lUSWvXhaa	I had one just like that. It kept on getting worse and worse to unbearable.  I had to draw the line and I told her I don't want to be friends anymore, and it was so much better. To make friends just be yourself and friendly. Talk with them, and you'll have friends in no time. Drop your other friend, it will be the best thing you do!|`|5AhyCwihaa	don't worry. i have the answer to this. it is quite simple. what you do is you play a very mean prank on her, like dipping her fingers in water while she sleeps...(this causes a person to pee.) or you could embarrass her in front of everyone...then she definietely won't want to be friends with you! it may seem hard to hurt your friend, but it really is not. this will work. you will be free. tell me how it goes.|`|TL9gEbh0aa	Yeah she must be insecure so be nice to her but tell her to lay off a bit because you wanna make other friends beside her|`|YDubSVbYaa	She probably is jealous.<br>  Tell her to get over it. And make new friends. <br>  You guys can still be cool and stuff.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	She must be insecure.|`|GQbF0Twiaa	Well i would start having parties like casual hang out days and invite all your future friends that you want to hang with i have been through that with a clingy friend and the best way is to start branching out with parties and mixers and stuff
J1rH8w3xaa	Pfft! OMG! Your caulk is fine... don't worry about it.|`|lztLa9FGaa	dude no one cares. dont care about your crotch care about your personality and...face.<br>  <br>  only dumb hookers would acctually give you a measurement ( hahajk.)|`|ojjqqeKQaa	No|`|AA10800077	its not the size its how you use it!|`|eocUhl4Waa	I don't know because I don't care about superficial stuff like that.|`|tvq6ljtzaa	Don't worry, if it's too small for the front door, you can always go in the back.|`|0UbJP4zJaa	8 lolz u qo 2ross hiqh skool|`|JnkoNbOGaa	Most girls dont care about that stuff so dont worry about  it|`|RAQSwEq1aa	Anything more then 8 inches|`|U8PnZOpHaa	i think...8 inches is good...but bigger is always better!!! lol<br>  im 16.|`|YaQ6YCIhaa	well a girl already knows if you packen or not for example: if your dancen in da club wit a chick and you grinden we only fell for one thing got a guess. You gussed right the penis, or if your playing around and " PULL'' IT OUT on "ACCIDENT" then if a girl plays wit your hot spot and then we no if its depends on how fast your reaction is and thats how we know|`|e1lc1GRZaa	8 is good<br>  9 and above is huge.|`|mhBxi1EWaa	last time i checked, i was a girl.<br>  so ill answer this.<br>  <br>  in my opinion, it doesnt how 'big' it is.<br>  just because youre pathetic enough to ask this,<br>  makes you a bore.<br>  <br>  remember, a big dick is no fun if its attached to a big dick.<br>  ^^ YOUUUUU.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck jerkkk<br>  <333333|`|zKs9IKVcaa	Okay would be 5 to 6 inches, and big would have to be 7 to 8 inches. I have seen many penis' and have never seen one longer than 8. Don't worry though just because someone has a big penis doesn't mean that they'll be good at sex. Just be confident. Also personally I hate a girthy penis. I actually turns me off. I hope my honest opinion helps you kiddo!!
5SCD87hTaa	break the ice the way that it works in the bed room. say "hey sexy" to him when you meet and talk dirty to him. this does not always have to lead to sex but it will break the ice with the focus on the good parts of your relationship. get some good pet names too, they work great.|`|joA5Rcyzaa	hmm well after 2 years there shouldn't be anything considered to be a awkward silence because you know eachother well (i assume at least) and you should be comfy with eachother.<br>  <br>  you can't really stop these because you can't talk forever. sometimes it's just going to happen and you two should be comfortable with eachother so it's not awkward|`|71e4c99bdb3d30e1e3a590d2a8520a6daa	i have a question in response for u ..<br>  <br>  if sex is what keeps u together now, what will keep u together when you two get old??<br>  <br>  that is not really a real relationship at all ...<br>  communication is a big big thing in a relationship<br>  <br>  and im telling u this because i made this mistake before|`|CaRKCpMqaa	I think you guys have just talked yourselfs out, insteadof just meeting and saying hello, straight away smile, wrap your arms around him , kiss him and tell hm you love him.

I have been married for 15 yrs. we have silent moments, but it is not awkward silence.<br>   What has me boggled is that you say after having sex you sorta become different people? it sounds to me like there is something lacking in the "RELATIONSHIP" PART OF IT! maybe the awkward silence means you do not really have that much in common with each other. You have to have common interests... things you both enjoy doing, things you both like to talk about and it does not sound like you have that. It seems to me the only common ground you have with him is in the bedroom! because that is something you both enjoy right?<br>  <br>   2 yrs. is along time to be in a relationship and I think if you are having "AWKWARD SILENCES" between you, that maybe you should re evaluate your relationship a little.At this point in a relationship there really should be no awkwardness..... silence is OK, but not if you feel awkward with each other.|`|WaYC7W9Haa	Upon reading your problem it totally sounds like a straight <br>  "BOOTY CALL" 2yrs, girl you should be greeting him first with a hug and a kiss and then conversation about life happenings, family and the future.  <br>  <br>  Sit back and rethink those awkward moments and what led you to sex and becoming chatty...<br>  <br>  Hopefully it's not just a booty call!|`|8i7AEWRCaa	well... the answer to this question is not just like:talk about this movie or that singer or these kinda stuff, its for people who have just meet each other not u 2. theres sth wrong in it.some people have these silent moments but sometimes these are even some ways to talk to your beloved,<br>  its not right at all. maybe u 2 r not made for each other cause it dosent make anysense<br>  are u shy? its 2 years! thats really weird|`|ajQYu3TCaa	Talk about things that you know he enjoys. Tell him how you are feeling. or just hold each other and watch some t.v. you dont have to talk constantly.|`|v8ImtsaJaa	try just having small conversations with him like whats been going on or something like that.|`|EcI03UPUaa	girl, by now the ice been broke, he and you are just shy waiting to see who's going to do what first.|`|YADmlPZqaa	Get a hobby together. <br>  <br>  My husband and I started working on cars together and now we always have something to talk about. New cars that come out, which wheels are nice, alterations we want, and so on. It also introduced us to a new crowd of people and new stuff to do.<br>  <br>  Some other hobbies would be: working out or joining a co-ed sports team.<br>  <br>  The issue could also be that you are spending too much time together. Try having a girls night or letting him go to some stuff himself, that way you have stuff to talk about when you do see each other.|`|xlmTBPBXaa	ok I had this problem one time. And there is only one solution! If he is making you scream O daddy every time then you dont need to talk about notin u dig girl! Just sit back, take it, and SHUT UP! Hope it helps Boo.
2bkV73gpaa	Not all men, but for those that feel that way, pay attention to how those idiots drive.<br>  <br>  It's no different than them racing the car along side of them to the next red light. They simply hate the idea of another guy having gotten someplace before they did.|`|ZAT8yqaGaa	2 reasons either they don't want to mary some one with more sexual 1. experince then them- which is good if they lack a lot themselves.<br>  this guy might be a nice fellow who is worried about the bagage in this area.<br>  2. they have some sick mentality where theer are women you mary to raise children with and bad girls you have sex with- this guy is going to cheat on you and has a lot of expeince himself<br>  To be blunt in my books this isn't an issue- as I have met some nice single mothers

I think if you're a person who likes fighting and has a hard time dealing with problems, you'll like the vulnerable girls.<br>  <br>  If you're a supportive person who likes to commit and look out for others, you'll want the courageous ones.

AA11538662	Hubby & I have a joint account and have since before marriage. So I don't know how married couples do the separate accounts. Actually, it makes no sense to me.<br>  <br>  Mary in Camden, MI<br>  <br>  PS~<br>  By the way, the proper way to spell "retarted" is RETARDED. ;-)|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Well Im not married, but I am in a defacto relationship with my bf and we live together, so there are no differences<br>  We both have seperate money.<br>  We split bills, rhouse repayments and groceries and any other necessities half way. However, I am a student and he works full time, so he has significantly more money than I do, so on regular occurence, he will often pay for me if we do something special or go out to dinner our do romantic things because if he didn't we pretty much would not go out. He has no problem with this either, because he knows that I contribute in other ways such as looking after our washing and making us dinner all of the time. From time to time I also pay for things for him, but in the end it all ends up fairly even. <br>  We find it great, and we are very open with talking about money, theres no reason for it to become an issue if you can just openly talk about any issues. We have talked about in the future if we were to get married that we might get a joint acocunt, but that we would both still like to have our own seperate savings accounts. This is mainly because neither of us want to have any guilt associated with buying the un-necessary items and dont want to feel judged by each other on what money gets spent on. I dont want to go buy some clothes and feel bad for using 'our' money, and neither does he. So if we ever had a joint account, it would be a decided on amount of our income, enough that it would cover bills, mortgage and groceries and other necessities, if after a while there was a lot of money left over in there, then we would probably just save it. |`|AH9i63ydaa	I'm a stay at home mom, so I have no income of my own and the hubby and I have a joint checking account.  So, I can't really personally relate to your situation.  However, growing up with two working parents, I remember they each had a checking or savings account in their own names and a joint checking account that was used ONLY for bills.  I'm not really sure what they used the other accounts for.  It came in handy though for my Mom when my parents divorced.  If she hadn't had her own account, we'd have had to start over again from nothing. Granted, she didn't have much saved up, but it was better than nothing.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	I've heard of people doing it but other than small amounts here and there when available in a savings account I can't see how it really would work...especially now after all this time.  Seems to me since honesty is the best policy then couples should pool the money and spend openly alone up to a $100 limit without questioning or having to explain it under bright lights.|`|x0jbfxl3aa	We just never combined ours when we got married.  Now I pay rent and utilities and he pays everything else (cars, insurance, satellite, internet, phone bill, etc.).  It pretty much evens out.  I also do most of the household shopping, but he pays if we have a night out or go on vacation.<br>  <br>  It all evens out in the end.  Neither of us want to deal with the mess of "How much did you spend today?" "What's the balance?" "Are we going to accidentally overdraft because we haven't been talking about what we are buy?", etc.|`|6SQiRWPUaa	I do it this way too. The way I figure, is that I married for life and in some times in our lives, I'll make more money, and in some times, he will make more money, and when we came together, we made one household. So, I don't look at who brings in more now, but rather, what can we do so we can both make enough to have the life we want. Right now I make the money and he's going to school... well, we both are in school, I just have a graduate assistantship that pays me. Anyway, at some point if for some reason I won't be able to work, he'll support us. I think having this "looking over a lifetime" and taking care of each other is healthier than always counting who makes what at any particular time. |`|MbzyriZ4aa	I keep everything separate from my partner and bills are split.<br>  Meaning I agree to pay this one, and he agrees to pay the other one<br>  and so on...,<br>  <br>  My problem with joint accounts is the fact that you never know how much money the other party is taking out while you are out and about going shopping... that just scares me and of course I prefer my finances to be completely separate due to a  very bad experience in my youth... My first husband didn't play "fair" when we broke up and raided all joint accounts and there was nothing I could do about it.<br>  <br>  There is always the possibility of the worst case scenario... and I prefer to completely prevent it from the start. <br>  <br>  P.S. I have been with my current partner for over 11 years... it has never played a huge role that we keep everything separate. |`|2bb016b1e780abaa80d9a9bd66d8e804aa	Most first marriages work with the joint account just fine.  But many marriages fail - and the primary reason is.... money!  One person can be a grasshopper and the other an ant.  The ant gets resentful of having to carry the family through the "winters" of life.  (I like Aesop).<br>  <br>  Second marriages generally have separate or three accounts - hers, his, and joint.  This way the bills still get paid and the frivolous one remains broke, has tons of things, and is happy and the frugal one is happy and has money.<br>  <br>  If the marriage breaks up, the grasshopper still has his/her stuff, and the ant still has her/his money.<br>  |`|fUV6NzOKaa	I was married for 23 years and we each had our set things to pay for and our own checking accounts with both names on both accounts and we trusted each other. I paid all the utility bills, fixed the cars, cell phone, car insurance and car payment. She paid the house payment, her car payment, the house payment and took care of allowance for my son and anything that had to do with school. We kina split groceries she payed more but I did most of the shopping and she did the small things if I didn't have time. It worked out very well.|`|XeWtA8bvaa	1 income, 2 accounts, I get an allowance for my needs, toys.<br>  All else is bills and her wants or needs.<br>  She pays all the bills & I never ask where or what the other is used for.<br>  My co. pays the insurance, 401 and all is auto withdrawn before checks are issued so I have no worries.<br>  I trust her and she does me so no need to divulge where every penny goes.<br>  We know every aspect of our finances without having to put each other under the microscope so it works well in this household anyway.|`|6b2de78a5b529b770c3b7d186d3bf0c6aa	It does not work, it is hard to keep track of what each other is spending, so jointly is the best idea, your lucky to have a husband that is willing to do that, there are many irresponsible men that rather keep their money and do as they please than pay bills. Therefore leaving the woman holding the bag.|`|w3Ht7FQwaa	My parents never had a joint account. My dad paid for things like the mortgage and car payments and insurance. My mom would pay for the things we needed (my siblings and I), any repairs to her cars, save money for all of us, groceries, things for our pets. It seems like it works well for them.|`|8t5wk1ZEaa	we have one joint and each separate because I am bad about writing things down in the checkbook - this way, he doesn't get irritated with me for not doing it.  Our joint account is for the mortgage; we each pay whatever bills come up.|`|WSuHjVHgaa	see how fast this changes when divorce mode sets in<br>  <br>  i used to think that way until i lost half of everything|`|1OuWiLZyaa	We don't have separate money , but I do have a personal account , for christmas , birthdays , and other special occasions. |`|AA11256410	it's still better to have your own bank account. for emergency purposes. in case your joint account suddenly runs out, u still have extra money.  it's always good to have a back-up plan.

It's normal to be angry. But it's not safe to say, "You want to kill them both." Dead bodies and murder are not pretty. There are serious consequences to that.I understand how much his cheating has hurt you. <br>  <br>  You need time to heal. Time to recover. Moreover, talk to someone you can talk to. Do not seek revenge.... it only makes things worst for yourself. Pyschological... mentally.. and emotionally.... by seeking out to cheat on him with another guy.... and harming yourself in the process.... you will turn into someone who you truly do not want to be. <br>  <br>  The key here is to control your emotions and learn to let things go. Decide what is best for you and your 1 yr old baby. "Change is good". If you don't want him in your life then let him know. <br>  <br>  And whatever you do.... I understand you will have this 'negative view' of men, in general.... that they're all cheaters. Not always true but we can't help but ignore this pattern. Try not to judge men, in a negative way... and remember to respect them as individuals. I know, for sure, that your bf isn't to be respected. <br>  <br>  Forgive and forget. Good luck and godbless.|`|6E81yM9Eaa	You dont have to kill them both you have to trust in God that he says that it is his revenge for those that hurt his little ones.

Just don't let if consume you or make you controlling.|`|RuJhWnS5aa	Jealousy is poisonous!  TRUST your man.  Has he done anything at all to make you suspicious?  If not, maybe you've found a good guy.  You need to be able to separate him from the others you've dated in the past.  <br>  <br>  My advice: when he goes out with his friends, go out with your girlfriends!  Have fun.  No guy likes to be with his lover all the time.  And you need to get away from him too, otherwise your jealousy will drive you mad.|`|PumDOQC9aa	You shoud trust him when he says he's going out with friends.

Are you kidding me?|`|tIDNEwdMaa	You're dating a pimp?|`|AA11603529	No. Why would he want other guys all over you? That's effed up. Don't do it.|`|xisGJccaaa	sounds like...okay i cant beat around the bush on this one, his friends are apperently desperate for pussy and he's trying to use you to shut them up, but if he said "if you love me, then you will let them do you" then that is a worse relationship than when i heard a guy say to his girlfriend "today im'a shoot you in the knee caps" then he procided to point at her knees and say "right there and there" dump him, thats my advice
V96p5opeaa	It's not weird that you've been single for 3 years. Since when is the word "single" a bad word?  Last time I checked, it wasn't a four letter word.  You were in an abusive relationship and made a promise to yourself.  That was a healthy choice because you had to have time to heal.  <br>  <br>  Now, you've grown a little older, a little wiser, and are possibly ready to go out there and try it again.  Subconsiously are you ready to find someone that you spark with and are you ready to settle down with?   Don't be in a hurry and don't think that you have to have someone because others think it's time.  When you're ready, one will come along and you'll know it.|`|6CPFRnGraa	It's not weird. You just haven't found the right person yet. A friend of mine has been single for the past 7 years, and he's 30. You just have to go at it when you're ready. Don't worry about what others say, it's what you think that matters. Hope I helped :)|`|hoGpOrOUaa	Not weird at all!<br>  You went through something and made a wise decision to focus on yourself!<br>  Most women after an abusive relationship, feel insecure and immediatly jump back into relationships with the same kind of guy so I think you've done good to put your energy into something positive.<br>  <br>  As long as your happy being single, there's no problem.<br>  Take people's shock and surprise as a compliment :)

I mean...were you friends with her before she hated you?<br>  <br>  *confused*<br>  <br>  Just come up to her and ask her if she hates you then make a conversation.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Uh...Start by asking her if she hates you...That'll give you a clue as to whether you should ask her out...<br>  <br>  If she says she hates you, don't bother asking her out...|`|KK718Xxaaa	talk to her she might not even hate you maybe she likes you too and dont know what to say to you either just talk to her get her number have a friend get it for you have a friend talk to her...=]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  juggalette 4 life<br>  much love to the juggalo family <br>  jamie madrox and violent j and shaggy 2 dope r hot <br>  i gave it to a juggalo<br>  lol sexiest killa u know <br>  peace. im out. <br>  bloody B|`|F0IeVJ0Iaa	she probably doesnt hate you<br>  if she knows how you feel about her it would change her opinion about you<br>  you have to find a way to speak to her and let her know that you are here<br>  she will appreciate how you feel|`|57LeojAeaa	If she hates you, forget about it. How can you love someone that hates you.|`|BosXJUoFaa	tie her up and make her listen|`|C47ItT5eaa	It doesn't matter what you say. If you are not confident in yourself your words will not mean anything. To say you can't live or do anything w/o her is the wrong frame of mind. You are living w/o  her right now, and posting this question w/o her right now.<br>  <br>  Gain confidence in yourself before you talk to her. If you are confident she will know...confidence can not be faked...<br>  <br>  On the other hand you can just go to her and be honest like...."look, i have had this thing for you for a long time now, and i have been so nervous to talk to you because i  always thought you hated me." ...and let it go from there..she will respond.<br>  <br>  Question for you though...is this a girl you dated already and she got pissed at you? or is this a girl you have had a crush on and are afraid to talk to her.<br>  <br>  My answer was if you never dated her.<br>  <br>  If you did date her and she is pissed....you need to put in your question why she is pissed at you if you want a good answer|`|yn0O5P80aa	well u first need to know why she may hate u, then we can give better answers
0s93q8Ocaa	Dress nice and project a smile.|`|OhhKRahTaa	A lovely smile and long eye contact, always works.|`|Jsy1xsL1aa	All the dudes know I suck on the dick for sometimes free. All the dudes want me and I love the attention. When I turn 16 I am moving in with one of the dudes and gonna make that bling.|`|FXBCYFhuaa	Be an absolute skank. Wear slutty clothing, lots of perfume and makeup, and act real loose around guys. They'll give you a lot of attention.|`|fe3cf86ee176021daf6b79ae5ae6df7daa	Put on night vision goggles and hang out by my window after dark, that usually gets my attention.|`|OYGGdSLcaa	complete confidence in what you are doing, and completely "ignoring" the guys. most of us never see it coming.|`|qW55yhR1aa	Go up to them and say "Hey."  *smile*  and observe something about them that made you want to go up and say hey.  Something light I mean.  Like, if he's wearing a shirt with a band you like, or you overheard him talking about a sport you like etc etc.  Basically, it's called honesty.<br>  <br>  Yeah it's that simple.  If they cold shoulder you, then whatever.  It isn't as if you came on strong.  <br>  <br>  And I'm not going to lie.  Guys' brains are designed to notice the exterior first. But that doesn't mean dress skanky.  Wear neat, sophisticated, flattering clothes.  It shows that you respect yourself.  Guys only want easy if they are lazy, or are looking for a one night.  Neither of which adds up to be much of a Man.<br>  <br>  Dress like you are looking for a man.  Not a guy.|`|QGgenmVgaa	Let be honest, wear a little skirt, dress like a slut is the best way to get guys attention.... Give me a break with the try to be a gentleman comments....

93xSOsUraa	ok unless he's a total flirt with other girls the answer is of course he likes you! with regards to the Fatty thing, it;s just teasing, boys can sometimes say things that they don't think would offfend you-especially as you aren't fat. and trust me, teasing like that means they like you, he's trying to make you feel jealous and everything and that's the way boys express their feelings.<br>  wierd, i know, but hey they're a mystery sometimes!<br>  hope i helped ^-^
jCbPgyH4aa	prom is all hype<br>  don't go and have fun doing something else, <br>  or go with friends<br>  or take your dad jk<br>  or ask around<br>  or find someone outside of school|`|POHWTDPRaa	Your friends don't sound very nice. The prom is when? May, early June? You still have time to find a date. Do you have a guy friend who doesn't have anyone to go with? You guys could just go as friends. Or just go with all your other friends. It's not like you are spending the night with just one person so it doesn't really matter if you have a date.|`|Tv0DkZuoaa	Ask a hot guy and prove them wrong..
H77rQYmsaa	I do, but some guys don't like chicks with piercings/tattoos.  As much as I enjoy the aesthetics, my present gf doesn't have it and it's not a deal-breaker.  If it was, it'd be a poor relationship!  The best answer is that anyone should get anything pierced when they want it for themselves, and not for any other reason. I'm not sure about the whole obsession over "head".  From personal experience, I think it is irrelevant and all in peoples heads.  I think it looks hot, but that's different. I quite enjoy kissing someone with a tongue piercing, and initially missed it when I moved relationships.<br>  <br>  Also, that guy ("Morad") who claims to be a med student is creepy.|`|gXuotV9Faa	No I guess they Don't because it disturbs when the guy kisses you Right ?<br>  beside, I guess You are More Beautiful when you are in your nature and you Don't need anything to Do with your tongue to look more beautiful..<br>  you Might ask yourself, How Do i certainly know that you are beautiful, right? ya you are for sure and i can see it through the common sense in you Question ? and I respect you for asking with all that self confidence ..<br>  well, i can introduce myself, I'm Morad and I'm a 3rd year medical student.. i would be lying if i tell you i don't like to know you more, i really do and i hope you don't mind and you are ok with that.. you can always ask me if yu need anything and i will leave my E.Mail here so you can send me a message if want...<br>  Morad_maj88@yahoo.com<br>  hey i will be happy if you become my friend,|`|8aImmdJxaa	obviously,they want head.|`|Lj3tPwzjaa	i would be turned on|`|Asm4AKOOaa	of course guys do , well most do . know i definity do and think its a turn on . on most girls of course if they can pull it off . so generally i like it .|`|Fmwd8ykiaa	So that you can give them head and put the piercing in the hole so they won't *** in your mouth
v8ImtsaJaa	I believe he really does like you sometimes (most) of times like this guys play around with girls like this because they want to get inside you and know who you are inside.|`|4Zbjx8bCaa	Mean!?!?!<br>  <br>  Well if he's mean in a way that doesn't hurt you but just patronizes you like annoying, or tickles you, squeeze your neck or pinches you, then he might like you, yeah....<br>  <br>  I don't know I guess he's too afraid to show his true self.<br>  <br>  <br>  Remember when a guy acts mean doesn't mean he is, it just means he's too afraid or nervous to ask you out, doesn't mean he's cocky, aloof or superior or too good for you, that happened to me a lot <br>  etc.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	He likes you. Otherwise he wouldn't worry about what others think about you and make them treat you nicely. That is a lot of energy for someone to use on someone else... Unless they have feelings for you.|`|v96pYAg1aa	He likes u if this guy didnt he wouldnt have bother helping u out at all so he has a thing for u go for it|`|PDAVQU3Caa	i think he might lol.|`|nemEwbbqaa	he does like you|`|NOvl3sGGaa	well if he is being mean to u sometimes then yes he does like u. i had a boy being mean to me and then he was nice.|`|y9WqNR0Kaa	Gurll He LIKES U but u have to call the shot before some one else asks him out|`|wSqq4gSBaa	he likes u

u0eTvggDaa	Well if y'all have been dating for about 4 months now, he shouldn't be saying that he is going to "hit" on her.<br>  <br>  yeah it's natural for him to say that she might be hot, but saying that he is going to hit on her isn't<br>  <br>  <br>  If i were you i would just confront him about it, and just be like hey i wanna ask you something, and tell me the truth.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't technically yell and get pissed off, but let him know that, saying those kinds of things hurt your feelings, you don't say that about other guys.<br>  <br>  If he thinks he can get away with stuff like that, he won't be ashamed of cheating i am sure. so just be careful.<br>  <br>  Talk to him <br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  :)|`|Eo0oeZMTaa	You may not wanna hear this but I wanna keep it real with you, any guy that says that is not gonna be that into you. He may say all the right things but if he was really that into you he wouldn't joke around like even if he was just trying to impress his buddies. The only other thing I would question is the source where u heard this. You said it was your best friend but make sure your best friend heard this first hand and not just heard a rumor. you dont wanna call somebody out if it aint true. good luck hope this helps|`|7TWAEBleaa	get mad, tell him how you feel. make him know that you are not to be played on. but also it's all about trust.

Online is a big part of life. And theres a lot of people on here so you cant make any sort of judgements. But people are usually meaner and maybe dishonest because they dont have to be held accountable. Id say it has to be hard to find a serious relationship online but not impossible. Its just much easier for me to meet somebody outside of online.|`|RuJhWnS5aa	Online dating websites - no.  I did date someone in grade school several years ago primarily over the internet.  It was awful.  If you're going to date someone, there needs to be telephone interaction and actually seeing the person every once in a while.  But to date someone strictly over the internet is not a good idea.  It's easy to misinterpret things they say, because you can't hear their voice or have physical contact.|`|9f92a965bf24a2810239fd2d91f31b30aa	Mostly it,s very unreliable|`|ofJOcZc1aa	Yes, always ends in disaster|`|6294100499fd624238a48e796bcdc9acaa	Hi<br>  I have a good experience<br>  <br>  Check<br>  <a href="http://www.chance2date.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.chance2date.com</a><br>  This is one of the best dating I have seen.<br>  100% FREE NO CREDIT CARD REQUIRED.<br>  <br>  Everything is ABSOLUTELY free Like :-<br>  Picture gallery<br>  Video gallery<br>  Forum<br>  Live Chat<br>  Message<br>  Winks<br>  Profile Search<br>  VOTING (Hot or Not)<br>  ALBUM<br>  My Blog<br>  ShoutBox<br>  Google Map<br>  Scrolling Gallery<br>  <br>  etc...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chance2date.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.chance2date.com</a>|`|XyrGLumFaa	yes it is good but be careful!

Not many days just today.Tell yourself tomorrow and days down the road that you can't cry about him because you did all your crying this one day.<br>  If you do want to watch a chick flick and be sad than make this your sad morning day. Tomorrow and so on watch comedies and things that won't get you down and sad.<br>  <br>  Get to know new people and date other guys. It will keep your mind off of your best friend.

You can't stop your life & take time off to get over someone. Go about your life like you always do, keep yourself busy. Keeping busy really is the answer. It just depends how strong you are, don't let yourself get caught up on one person. Also don't feel sorry for yourself, you can't change the situation. He has a girlfriend, move on. Sulking only makes hurt feelings last longer & it's pointless.|`|wjR7rIV0aa	I don't think there are guidelines to get over a guy.  To get over a guy, it depends on you.

2QHrbqQmaa	You should really consider what you are ready for. Stand firm behind that because if you do something out of being caught up in the moment you could feel really bad. Avoid situations that could make you go to far. Make sure you are both clear on what the boundary is. If its not respected than He isnt respecting you like he should. If its getting too heated stop go somewhere more public get your minds off of it. Its easy to get caught up and there is no going back if its taken to far. Most important whatever you decide you are ready for be safe :).|`|NoSAvY0Xaa	I think you should wait a while. You're young and you don't sound too sure, and you have to be sure to go further ok? I think you should just keep it the way it is if you're comfortable. If not, just kiss like before. If he really loves you, he'll wait. Good luck :)|`|dYOoPWd7aa	having sex getting naked tell him  dont want to go that far mine ur self that|`|vLUhBlZoaa	Sounds like my girlfriend and I. we both want to wait till marriage  till we have sex. and for the first 6 months we didnt do more than kissing and some touching above the waist. but we talked about it a lot, and we both felt that touching below the waist IE fingering/hand job weren't a problem, because we loved eachother. and we both know we are going to get married some day.

I6dIkhbOaa	It's actually better to grow a friendship into a dating relationship because then it is based off more than just physical attraction. If you like him, you should probably be a little excited because you can believe that he is into you for more than just the shallow reasons. He likes who you ARE and not just what you LOOK like. It may seem out of no where to you, but he has probably been thinking about it for a while, trying to decide or get up the nerve! Oh and no! not weird.  :)|`|jokhhgu1aa	Its normal, if you have a guy friend you get pretty close. 9 out of ten cases end up going out.|`|98LDN0Quaa	he probably asked what to do on here and we decided he should man up and ask u out.|`|4YK4tBW5aa	No it's not weird, he's probably wanted to for a long time|`|gJPlY1ADaa	ummm no that is not weird.....it seems he has just been trying to get the confidence to ask you out, because he doesn't know how you would react...but if you think it will be weird going out with him then don't waste the poor guy's time just stay friends.

You can talk to him as a friend and let him get to know you...and if he ends up liking you as more than a friend, great.  But you absolutely shouldn't flirt with him or tell him you like him.  Dont do anything you wouldn't want his gf to find out about.  And who knows, you may even get to know him and discover you wouldn't want him as a bf anyway!|`|mlax02uGaa	I wouldn't advise telling him, really. Depending on how old they are, the relationship might not last long and then you could tell him how you feel.<br>  <br>  Right now, I wouldn't do anything.

To suddenly have your boyfriend go off with some other girl because she said she liked him?<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|eus7WqzUaa	I know it is hard to see someone you really like everyday and feel helpless.  Trust me, I know.<br>  <br>  You ever hear the phrase "We always want what we can't have"? Its true. If you tell him you will start a girl fight and you could lose him as a friend. You need to realize that if you had him you probably wouldn't want him anymore.   <br>  <br>  How would you feel if someone went up to your boyfriend and hit on him?  Not good.  <br>  <br>  You need to ask yourself if he was single if you would like him so much.|`|PXuoxlwbaa	that could turn out really bad. just tell him that you kind of like him, but you realize that he has a girlfriend right now, and that you're not going to interfere with that (AND DONT) but that you do like him, and if they end up breaking up, you would like to go out sometime or just hang out.|`|AA10266072	You can't tell him.

cI19nesraa	You need some boundaries with this person.  She has no social skills for whatever reason and she may have a mental health issue or developemental delay.  You need to be able to tell her in no uncertain terms when her behavior exceeds you comfort level.  Be straight with her.  If she can't or won't take your limits seriously then drop her.|`|MXjvZMUXaa	LOL!! she sounds like an enemy. not a friend.<br>  she talks behind your back and you're okay with it!??!?!?!<br>  all i can say is LEAVE her and don't talk to her and when she bugs you just ignore her and act as if she's not even there.
GUTITGDlaa	There is usually a reason why relationships are "on and off" - and that's that it is just not meant to be but the two people involved are holding on due to fear of not ever finding that right person. Better to be unhappy in love then lonely. You need to separate yourself completely - delete his number, burn the mementos, tell him that he is no longer welcome in your life and that you are moving on (none of that "lets be friends" - it doesn't work - at least not immediately). Then date as many people as possible so that you can realize what you do and don't want out of a man. You will soon realize that relationships don't have to be dramatic and difficult. Don't worry, it maybe difficult at first since you feel comfortable with this guy. You will separate yourself in due time - when you are ready. Just realize that neither of you are doing each other good at this time - allow each other to move on and find what makes you both happy. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6iHSZB6jaa	Make a goal or find something important  to focus a lot on.

6ndM8fNLaa	Yes, I think he is definitely flirting with you. If he didn't care about you or the reaction he could get from keeping the pencil, then he would just simply give the pencil back to you.

I would just keep flirting w/ him and wait for him to make a move|`|U4MyeZd2aa	flirt back... see what he does!!|`|ed77b684631a15604ec6d6ba1f0a55daaa	Check one flirt TICK!<br>  Check two does he like you... hmm very possible, but not sure if it's an exclusive like or not, it could be a general like, and he would if you'd let him, but not got his heart set on it just yet.<br>  Check three should you do anything about it... I'd say no, sit it out a while, be sure how he feels, if he does like you something will come up sooner than later.<br>  <br>  Chances are he does like you, and something will let you know, it'll be a special look or diverted eye contact while you are talking, something like that, when that happens you can ask for his number, but until then I would just play it cool and see how it pans out!<br>  <br>  He sounds sweet though :)|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	Don't ask him anything about liking your or you liking him.  Let him make the move if he is really into you.  Save yourself any embarrassment in case he doesn't like you.|`|PVR0y9eOaa	flirt back!!<br>  thats called boy flirting, they bug you and sometimes get annoying but that is DEF flirting gurl!<br>  flirt back!!!|`|AFx0PCGvaa	he's just bein a guy, keep flirting! try asking for his number if he's still flirting with you in a few days<br>  <br>  :]|`|rcQgfKPTaa	its simple;<br>  <br>  he likes you<br>  u like him<br>  u flirt<br>  he flirts<br>  ask him<br>  or he'll ask  u :)|`|QAj0qnwJaa	stay playfull, but dont ask him out. yes he is into u. give it time|`|QMbxBynZaa	he probably likes you, one day look and see if he acts this way with other girls, if he does then he probably is just a flirt but you can win him over by flirting more :)and if he doesnt then he most likely likes you, DONT ask him out it sounds desperate 99% iof the time coming from girls. maybe just be like hey me and a feew friends are going to the movies whenever and you're welcome to come a mabe bring some friends if you want :))))) play hard to get too, it'll keep him on the edge of his seat ! good luck <3|`|RUL7xdHHaa	hes just flirting with you. now and i know this sounds weird since im in high school but in homeroom i have 2 sit by these 2 boys and one day in home room they started pulling my hair (i have really long hair) and i know that sounds like something you would do in pre school but they were doing that to me and the do other stuff 2 me 2 like yell at me for no reason and like come up and like punch me and one of the boys just sits there and rubs my thigh its really weird|`|cJbtCv9kaa	Thanks for answering my question. I think he likes you. Start it off slow like ask him for his number and then text him and say hey. Then see what happens next. After maybe a a couple days to a week of texting ask him if he wants to hang out. Start flirting alot with him and if he flirts back he likes you and if he doesn't he may not. But be careful and make sure he is just flirting with you cause if he's flirting with other girls to he just might be a player.|`|knl7QWIDaa	Ya he likes you. The pencil would be a very good excuse to see you again and again during the day.<br>    You should just get him alone and ask if he likes you. Or say you like him and then ask if he likes you.<br>   <br>       Hope this helps! Zoe.|`|eSDpEwhyaa	Just keep on playing with him and see what comes up. When ever you feel more appropriate ask for his number. But don't ask him out. Just keep flirting. If he really likes you he will make a bigger move on you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|x9D1QkzDaa	I agree with Zoe. He's flirting BIGTIME. Get him alone, try to kiss him when you and him are hanging out with your buddies, or alone.|`|mJmMtWqiaa	I think he likes you but make sure non of your friends say anything to him if they sit near him.|`|b8FRvTVmaa	keep flirting with him and if he gets the hints he will ask you out but then again some guys are pretty dumb so you might need to make the first move|`|Z0T0WPfUaa	he just wants your pussy|`|EedkDoMYaa	he is flirting with you thats for SURE...i would just let it play out...see if that behavior continues...and if you like him, keep giving him the vibe your giving him...the movie thing with friends doesnt sound like a bad idea either...just say "hey, me and a bunch of my friends are meeting at the movies this saturday, did you and a couple of your friends want to join us" then its not a date but you'll get to see him at a time when you usually don't...and the more yall get to know each other the more likely a relationship might start|`|ApnV9ePZaa	He's flirting...

Explain that if he continues behaving like this and distrusting your feelings, that you won't be able to cope being with him.  Relationships NEED trust.  There are always going to be other men and women in your partner's life, it doesn't mean they'll cheat.  Old flames are old flames for a reason.

YRJShhKraa	Wow, I was just in the same exact situation as you! Except I lied about the fact that I currently had an eating disorder, not that I had had sex. The lie was easy, since in the past I was anorexic, but the lie just keep getting bigger, and bigger until I couldn't take it anymore physically or emotionally. I just broke down and came clean that I really didn't have an eating disorder, I just have a severe phobia of throwing up (hid it since as long as I could remember so I was probably about 5) and didn't want to be called a crazy person for it. I even told them about how I had anorexia in the past, they were hurt that they didn't notice but appreciated that I told them the truth. Just tell her the truth! She might be hurt at first that you lied to her, but believe me you feel so much better once the truth is out! Good luck! Hope this helps! =)|`|4WXK187vaa	Moonflow,<br>  <br>  How about you make a correction...if in doubt, tell the truth! I guarantee that you will feel better after wards. <br>  <br>  This person might appreciate your honesty...do you really think this person has never made something up? <br>  <br>  You might get a reciprocal confession and then your friendship will be even stronger than before.<br>  <br>  Mystified|`|BO28Mn8haa	Well you are adults now, tell her you are a virgin and you were just embarrassed back then. No big deal, but the anorexia thing is a bit rash. Some people really do deal with that as a serious problem. I wouldn't bring that up again.|`|7618x2okaa	come clean, if you dont tell her you will end up feeling worse and worse. also the longer you wait the more upset she will get.<br>  <br>  good luck hope this helped.|`|AA12184663	tell her the truth & explain to her why u lied.. if she really is your best friend she'll understand.|`|wCyhrvAdaa	Well I wuld personally, tell the truth. You might have been ashamed of sum things in ur lyfe that you put it aside and fake a smile everyday or pretend it doesnt bother u, so thats why you dont tell others, aspecially to ur best friends. But i wuld be careful on who you tell, but if these gurls are ur true friendzz and tel YOU everything, YOU should tell the truth to them, face to face and tell how you feeeel and if they are your true friendz as they say they are, They SHOULD understand.|`|tXSPCtHCaa	I'd forget about the anorexia thing. Just blow it off and if she mentions it, don't make a big deal of it. Just have a "i've moved on" attitude.  When it comes to the other thing, I'd come clean. Tell her you have to come clean about it. If you explain that you made it up to fit in and not feel so out of the loop. I'm sure she'll understand.|`|SHNIlE9Uaa	Go to your best friend, calmly sit down and explain everything bit-by-bit. Ofcourse the will be shocked but if you show sorrow during the explanation, your friend might think that you regret lying and will not be that harsh on you as you think. Truth is the way. You have to take it.|`|h0U42w2xaa	What a tangled web we weave when we practice to deceive.<br>  <br>  The truth will always come out eventually.<br>  <br>  Confess up everything and apologize. Most importantly, repent before the Creator of the universe and trust that Jesus' death paid for your sins.<br>  <br>  Live a new life and don't include lies in it.|`|A4SU14Wwaa	the only think you can do is come clean|`|LbJqU82waa	repent for the kingdom  of god is at hand!|`|rMgnmMN9aa	So your a virgin and not an anorexic who lied about having sex and not eating?<br>  <br>  The first one you could pull of by simply telling her that you we're embaressed about being a virgin and didn't want her to know, and after she believed you you we're afraid to tell her different. That one is easy lots of people are embaressed about being virgins (which you shouldn't be)<br>  <br>  The second one I don't understand, why would you tell a lie like that? I don't know the circumstances behind that lie but if her friendship means that much to you then she is obviously a good person and friend and will understand if you explain why you told the lie in the first place. <br>  <br>  Then explain that once you lied it became harder and harder to tell the truth because it went on longrer and longer and you got deeper into the lie so you just let it go. But now you want to put a stop to it because you value her as a friend and don't want your friendship based on lies. <br>  <br>  And stop lying, if YOUR a good friend you shouldn't be lying in the first place!<br>  <br>  I hope it works! Good Luck!|`|sbeoF50gaa	I will assume you told her you weren't a virgin because it can be embarrassing to say you are when everyone else is not. So that's an easy one, just tell her you didn't want to be labeled as "different" or a "prude" or other mean things say to virgins. As for the anorexia, that can also be something to be ashamed of. JUST tell her you were embarrassed to be truthful, but it eats you up inside that you lied. If she's your bestfriend you should be able to tell her anything and she will understand where you are coming from. What are friends for, if not for hugs and comfort.|`|sHDAbvBDaa	Well everyone lies for one reason or the other that's natural. The best thing to do is sit her down and talk to her about it, if you can handle that then it would be ok. Just make sure you are sincere about saying that you are sorry, that you mean it, and promise that you won't do it again.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you, happy days!|`|7nGwou8uaa	just tell her you lied. if you are good enough friends you guys should be fine
fe3cf86ee176021daf6b79ae5ae6df7daa	If she isnt interested in a boyfriend. dont push it my man. Just be yourself. Keep being a good friend. She might someday change her mind, and if you 2 are close, then she might recognize you are the one for her.<br>  <br>  Crushes are hard dude. They are typically a ONE WAY thing. You have a crush on her, not vice versa.<br>  <br>  A relationship is a TWO WAY thing. Both parties have to be interested in each other. You cannot force her to like you just because you like her.<br>  <br>  Be a good friend, express your feelings in a very chill way, then drop it. Tell her you wont pursue any further. Peoples feelings change over time.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.<br>  Oh, and dont be a psycho. Nobody likes that :)|`|RBx4eJHtaa	tell her you really like her, and take it from there ;]<br>  xoxo|`|6CAsx3jaaa	your making a common mistake . your waiting to fall in love or like before the date. instead find someone that is attractive and has similar interests and then ask them out. the advantage is that you will become more attractive to your friend when you start dating others|`|T07F0BeFaa	maybe in a little while she will come around, but maybe you need to look around, and find another girl. There are always more fish in the sea! But as far as its going right now, i think you need to respect her opinion, and if you want something more than a friend zone.. then look for other girls. [: good luck!!|`|Y1zH3Ecfaa	If your in the friend zone you are screwed .... so lets get this straight ... also you should stop being so so  ...wimpy and get it together and  just tell her whats up ...|`|OhhKRahTaa	Just get out there and talk to different girls, you might be surprised, one could genuinly like you.|`|BiHbT9pTaa	Just wait untill your friend wants a boyfriend. And then flirt a little and BAM!|`|PXuoxlwbaa	just keep looking around. sometimes you don't see what there is to someone when you are just friends or when you haven't gotten to know them. i wouldn't suggest going for our best friend because often times that ruins friendships that could have lasted a really long time otherwise. So maybe just look for a girl who you think is cute, and ask her if she'd like to hang out sometime or something, flirt a little, but don't make it all serious like.. i know it sounds a little shallow to just go off looks but you'll get to know them. sometimes something great can come from just trying something out. don't think too much about the possibility of falling in love. just date, have fun.|`|vXQMttWFaa	just because she doesn't want a boyfriend now doesn't mean she won't in the future. Don't think of it as asking a girl out, think of it as hanging out, or just two people going to the same place at the same time and it might take the fear out of it for you.|`|FXBCYFhuaa	Tell her how you feel and tell her that you have dreams are night about kissing her and holding her hand beneath the moonlight.|`|cHF1PwRdaa	Your best friend is a good one to ask out because you will have a lot in common and who knows maybe a relationship can develop from that.

I hope I resolved your question.|`|sZ0McynSaa	Be honest and share your feelings or it will kill you inside.|`|YsNDkPd4aa	ask me out please|`|ARSnCRLbaa	There really is no science behind it, just ask. If a girl says no, don't take it as a rejection, it's just a way of weeding out the girls who you don't want to be with anyway. <br>  <br>  But when you're stuck in a "friend zone" with a particular girl, sorry, but you're stuck there. In this case, you can do one of two things: 1) stick by her side, be a faithful friend and do little things that will make her eventually realize that you'd make a great boyfriend or 2) continue being her friend but move on to another girl who says "yes" to you when you ask her out. Just keep in mind option #1 might take a while to happen or it might not happen at all.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|5jqFOTSDaa	well lets assume your friend is a fairly straight forward person and that you have a good relationship, tell her how you feel and also if she says no don't push the issue because you could lose a friend that you may need later on in life. maybe find out why she doesn't want to be with anyone, if its cause she got burned, the think it through ... are you really going to last or are you just wanting to always have some one around? i know a lot of people like that, i get called to go places all the time just cause their lonely. <br>  <br>  lets assume she says no, say it cool i just wanted you to know, and move on to some one else. honestly there's no reason to be nervous say what you feel and stand by it if some one doesn't like what you have to say they'll walk away or try and debate with you as long as you know when to admit when your wrong and fight when your right life is easy for the most part.|`|tdG5409Uaa	I have the same, but after much experience, I learn that the best way is to be yourself and not try to be someone else or the one you think she will like. So be yourself, but be a sexy self as you can. You maybe want to start asking questions of things she love to do or like in conversation so you can one day surprise her. But, there many out here, be yourself and keep it sexy.|`|HM70Xllhaa	Im on my brothers account and im a girl its easy dont be shy you can give her a special note bu if she knows ur hand writing ask one close guy friend to right it but not for it to be a give away. Since u guys r best friends u should know what she likes if she has a secret admirer mabey she might start liking it if she starts taking about it with u thats a good sigh keep doingthis for awhile until she tells u that the no boyfriend thing might change her mind because for girls there way to chey to ask out a guy you can d it!|`|qW55yhR1aa	My advice?  Branch out.   When you learn to ask out other girls you'll have the confidence you need to ask the one you really want to be with.  Moreover, your friend will see your a capable, desirable, and confident guy.<br>  <br>  As for asking other girls out:<br>  <br>  1. Be yourself.<br>  <br>  2. There are no trick or pick-ups.  If your real, and your confident being real, girls will notice.  It's a rare thing.<br>  <br>  3.  Don't be afraid to get turned down.  After all, it's your friend you really care about anyways.<br>  <br>  If your friend doesn't want a boyfriend at the moment, just be her friend and be a good one.  I actually think her not wanting to date at the moment is a good sign.  It gives you some time to be more comfortable in your skin and talking to other girls without worrying if she's going to be snatched up.<br>  <br>  And if in the end you don't end up with your friend?  You'll still have the confidence there from exploring.<br>  <br>  You don't have to be in love with a girl to go up and talk to her or ask her out to grab a meal.  You don't even have to know her that well.  That's what the meal is for.  Getting to know them.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|BqcyxZhtaa	well just think outside the box. you are not the only one that think like that. i have trouble asking boy myself.

X5C5UhPFaa	It's a choice. You choose to be kind and thoughtful. You consider humans important and not to be dismissed or thrown away. You have to practice being kind and having manners. How you treat others is how you will be treated in return somewhere down the path. It helps to stop and think about our actions and how we treat others. It will not go unnoticed. People  these days use the excuse that they are too busy to be nice. You will be repaid in kind. If you are too busy to think of others and their feelings, then you need to leave the planet. Also, people have a class system on how they grade other people. whether or not they deserve kindness. It's a first impression thing.

7twY5OIuaa	Men tend to pick on people who they think are weak (it is a childhood thing male children are forced to learn through experience). Weakness here is defined as being physical or emotional or financial or intellectual or maturity level. He obviously has wrote you off at some point and does not value you at present or he may feel insecure about where he fits in society and takes it out on you, the person who "won't fight back" (meaning actually carrying out a threat). If he feels superior to you and you bicker and pick at him (right or wrong, because I'm sure he doesn't think he's wrong) he will just shut you out. It may not be fixable because you guys started out wrong somewhere. Do you have a career? Do you spend time together? Is the sex good or could it be better? Ask these questions to yourself and I think you will find the answers because there is something that was there before (or else you knew he was a prick going into marriage and was cool with that) and you need to find it again.

Would you rather he be going out looking for good looking women rather than looking harmlessly online?|`|I54KyS8Laa	Candice,<br>  You most likely eat to spite him. Subconsciously it's your way of getting even with his controlling ways which means that it's important for you to learn how to deal with his controlling personality. <br>  The reason you were attracted to him in the first place is that you probably have a poor self image--other wise you never would have tolerated his controlling personality. Before you go in the ring with the bull, you need to learn a lot more about you. Start by reading some old stand bys--Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz and Your Erroneous Zones by Wayne Dwyer--they should be in any library or you can get them for fifty cents on Amazon.  It's fundamentally important for you to read those books. I have a lot of great cds on my website--one for Making Relationships Work--another one for Building Confidence--but don't go there until you read the books and know I'm directing you in the right path. Eventually you may want to go to counseling, but right now getting the bull out of the ring might be difficult. If there's any substance abuse on his part like alcohol, get involved with alanon because you are an enabler. <br>  In other words, being the way you are, personality wise, enables him to bully you and do whatever else he does. The porn is only a symptom of his unhappiness with himself. It's easier for him to look for an outlet rather than deal with his faults. <br>  If you look at the links below, you'll also see one for counseling (the last one) which I also do on the phone, but without reading those books you'd be wasting both your time and mine. <br>  I hope you enjoy reading,<br>  <br>  Richard K|`|IvMPh09baa	well... if you are overweight and he doesn't like it, that might have something to do with his having to look at other women.

You are correct and not overbearing in this respect, but if you try to stop him then he will do it behind your back. He has this weird desire to surf the net for other women. As far as your weight is concerned, did you put on a lot of weight recently or were you always on the heavy side? He should support you in your efforts to lose weight instead of criticizing you. You two need to see a marriage counselor before it is too late. Second marriages, statistically, have a lower probability of survival unless people have learned from their mistakes, are flexible and willing to compromise.|`|cI19nesraa	It is too bad you married him.  It sounds like he is being emotionally abusive to you and that is bad news because there is nothing which motivates abusers to stop.  That feeling of power over another is so intoxicating they cannot stop no matter what they say about loving you.  Of course you are also allowing him to be this way.  Get some professional help for your own self esteem issues and then maybe you will see what needs to be done.|`|gfHutvEFaa	If he knows it bothers you and doesn't change then you have a problem. It means he has no respect for you or your feelings.<br>  <br>  Sitting down and talking (really talking) may help or you could try counseling.<br>  <br>  Talk. Don't nag. There is a difference.|`|AA10500537	i think he should stop harrassing  you over your wait and i;d toss his cp out the window,<br>  <br>  when a man has a wife he doesn;t need to be looking at women  elsewhere.<br>  either go to counceling or part for a while|`|AA12233287	This might not sound like something either of you would want to do, but look into counseling, whether it's a friend or preacher or whatever. Hope it gets better for you!|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	I agree, pron is one thing because you know the big busty blondes are not going to ocme knock on your door saying there knocked up with your husbands baby. <br>  <br>  When he is looking at local ads|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Sounds like your marriage is going down the toilet. Keep your mouth shut.|`|UKqJiIlGaa	just looking?  that's BS...!!  get away from him; he is an abusive, controlling cheater|`|lzooHi0Baa	Your marriage looks very ugly.  I can tell what a controlling freak he is, he has you confused, working on your weight, figuring out how to save a marriage, if that is what you want to call it,  while he is just enjoying his life away doing who knows what.   If he does that in your presence, imagine what he is doing behind your back.   I could never give my precious love to a jerk like that, I love myself too much.  I need to be with a man that adores me, never sees a flaw on me and at least respect my presence when he is tempted to look at another woman.

If you have feelings for him, just go for it.|`|jLLkSWyiaa	well if your attracted to him then i say go for it??|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Tell him you like him. He may get better looking as he gets older. If not you can always put a bag on his head.|`|6l6yo1oXaa	if he is nice to u,protective,think u love him etc n treats you how you should be treated then i would think thats somewhat better than him being hot (soz if it sounds like im havin a go im reali not)<br>  hope this helps|`|iULt8UB9aa	Go with your "gut" feeling.  Beauty is always in the eye of the beholder and someone's real beauty is on the inside.|`|pVaZty4Maa	go for it, looks don't matter :)|`|Vr7NR2LGaa	Who cares? if you like him then go for it. who cares what everybody else things. if you feel its right then hey go for it.|`|3V2eZzbLaa	uhm.. tell him how you feel.
AA10970759	He cares about you but he doesn't want to lose you in his life.  He is scared that if you stop talking to him, you would not come back.  He may have self esteem issues.  He sound like a guy who knew he had a good thing and wants it back.
1HTRWrawaa	WTF kind of marriage is this? Obviously you don't have a job and you are depending on him to pay the bills and give you money to buy groceries. ARE YOU A WOMAN OR A CHILD???<br>  <br>  Get a job, get your own cell phone on a different account then his. Get your own credit cards in your name only, get your own bank account in your name only and have everything personal about yourself locked with pass codes <br>  <br>  Don't give him the grocery receipts or your credit card bills, and make it impossible for him to access your cell phone account and know who you are talking to.<br>  <br>  When your control freak husband complains, tell him we are equals and what's good for him, is good for you, and if he doesn't like it, there's the door and don't let it hit him in the A$$. I personally wouldn't give him a choice, I would have kicked him to the curb a long time ago.|`|wzpCMI44aa	He's definitely controlling you and that's a form of abuse which tends to get verbal and then physical. I would suggest you go to counseling and see what options you might have.|`|HjMbOgvqaa	CHANGE YOUR CELL PHONE NUMBER AND DO NOT TELL HIM THE INFO HE WANTS CONTROL FREAK OBIVOULY BUT IF YOU ALLOW IT IT WILL GET WORST DO YOU EARN YOUR MONEY THEN PAY YOUR OWN BILLS START A BANK ACCOUNT  IN CASE OF EMERGENCY|`|kK4xt7cAaa	first of all, i would not marry that man,|`|M8BvgsOnaa	This has nothing to do with control. <br>  Okay- Maybe a little bit. <br>  It sounds to me like he is trying to hide an affair, and keep you from having one.<br>  <br>  Check more into it.<br>  And yes, you can get access to it.<br>  Go to your phone company and ask for a copy of it.<br>  <br>  EDIT*<br>  Also, seems like.. he wants grocery store receipt to make sure no condoms are bing bought. Wants credit card bills to make sure you are not buying for another man. Wants phone records to make sure you aren't calling other people. The only reason he would go that far to check on you, is because he knows if you checked those things on him, you'd find a lot more then a grocery list and  paid bills.|`|50073dbd5ecac430d78adbf7aa450341aa	Ah, brokenhearted, you already know the answer here, and my suggestion is to run, and run as far and as fast as you can, stopping only for a lawyer.<br>  This in not only controlling, but a precursor for domestic violence.  This has warning signs written all over it.<br>  Do yourself a favor, GET OUT NOW!<br>  I wish you all the luck in the universe.  No one deserves what you are going through, and what is going to happen if you do not stop it now.|`|OG6BYwaLaa	This is an immature, insecure, and childish jealousy-filled marriage that is doomed if this isn't fixed.  On BOTH ends.|`|l9lrT7bfaa	He is guilty and has something to hide that is why he is so paranoid about you.|`|AA10427535	Draw a line for yourself. When he crosses it. Say nothing and leave. You are wasting too much of your life on an empty pursuit. Your life is worth more than to be his slave.|`|9qmP77Rgaa	he's controlling you pretty much.<br>  <br>  PWNED!|`|t5hp4t79aa	Who's letting him control whom?|`|AA12160080	Sounds like he is in control.. Doesn't sound good for either one of you, though.. Good luck!!|`|OZcn0D4Caa	   It sounds like you have some problems in your marriage.  But from just this one short paragraph, it's really hard to say what's actually going on.  <br>     It would be great if you could find a counselor who could help you work through your issues.  You could also try simply talking to your husband to see if he would share with you why he feels to insecure that he has to lock everything up and keep tabs on you.  He may have a very good reason, like a terrible experience in his past.  <br>     This isn't necessarily abuse, and leaving him like most people are saying you should is definitely not a good idea.  You're setting yourself up for some heartbreak if you do that.  Please consider trying to work things out first.  Again, try to get some professional help, or even go to a pastor or a good, unbiased friend to mediate.|`|20ecoZOzaa	He is definitely controlling you. If you are not working you need to get a job asap, so you can  pay your own bills and you won't have to report back to him. I'm not trying to start anything, but he is up to something and you should put your foot down and say that's it, after you get a job and start paying bills.<br>  Good luck.|`|NmLmQEa9aa	Your husband is a control freak. <br>  Control = misery <br>  be careful and dont allow your husband to manipulate you and more importantly dont get roped into mind games<br>  <br>  i was in a controlling relationship and you dont realise the damage they can do to you until your out of it<br>  <br>  stay saf take care |`|RkNSgwAnaa	umm. first i would so tell him something. what do you think?who is controlling who? its pretty obvious. i say tell him no you do not have to show him any thing. you take control and if he is still doing that and you do not think its fair then BREAK UP with him! or talk to him and tell him how you feel.<br>  |`|Xhgq35dNaa	Husband is controlling the wife...but, in my opinion, she deserves it if she is dumb enough to allow him to treat her this way.

jCbPgyH4aa	everybody goes through an "awkward phase" where everything about them is hideous, the classic bad skin, braces, gangly arms.<br>  trust me you aren't ugly, just dont look like a little kid anymore, the older you get, the more you will grow into your true looks. just concentrate on not physical beauty right now, but having a good personality and supportive friends and fun activities.<br>  :))
AA11033942	I'm 6'2. my last girlfriend was 6' and the beauty of that was I could kiss her (and more) without arching my back too much. I am one of those people who would rib people for not sitting straight shouldered - other people are less fussy - but interacting with them would be just as much fun if I really got on with them. <br>  <br>  I have a friend nearly my height and he has a girlfriend of 5'2 or there abouts, I call them little and large! it's sweet a little odd looking for the both of them.<br>  <br>  I think that like age gaps, there should be a maximum height difference as well. say 6-8 inches, and normally it would be the girl because the reverse is even strager and girls can boost their height be wearing high heels.<br>  <br>  If you get on really well and your age gap isn't too different then why not? personally I wouldn't but if it works for you then well done! and good for you.<br>  |`|431b2875a761b3b8976ef7ba75c4cf3faa	some guys like short girls because short girls look younger. actually guys who look for young girls will date them.|`|fhSxI3XHaa	I am a girl...I think little girls with bigger guys is cute...short guys are YUCK.|`|1857be617d60deda585d08bb7fffa45eaa	idk, maybe|`|xftmi9PNaa	Some people like to keep it reasonable, like a 7ft guy might be too tall for you. But in most cases guys don't really care how short a girl is, some even prefer the shorter ones, they think it makes you cuter. <br>  <br>  My g/f is 5'2" I'm 6'. You have nothing to worry about.|`|Uo52DLvsaa	height doesnt matter<br>  its whats inside that counts. if hes a dull old person, then no<br>  if hes nice romantic funny and smart then YEAH!|`|A5qhHURUaa	5'1 is fine..most guys like shorter girls anyways (the taller ones tend to make them feel unmasculine).|`|YIKNamxqaa	I could care less.

I just want to meet someone with a connection at that next level. |`|poNwDl4uaa	Doesn't really matter to me at all
iPNOVR6Gaa	The overwhelming evidence indicates that he doesn't particularly care about his marriage or his wife.  If you feel like you really, really need a fu*k buddy, I strongly recommend you find one that's single.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	He's a cheat and a liar. he obviously cares only about himself. If he cared about his wife he wouldn't have cheated and if he cared about you he wouldn't have lied. Right? He only cares about himself. You deserve somebody who cares about you. Dump the loser.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	He's a dog. It's that simple. Clearly you are nothing more than sex to him. If you were anything special to him at all, then he wouldn't be with his wife, escpecially after she found out about you. Leave him alone, I'm sure you aren't the ONLY one he's sleeping with besides his wife, and you could end up with HIV or an STD. He's not worth it. Perhaps you should let his wife know that he's still trying to contact you. You said that she nearly killed him when she found out, so if you continue to mess with him, or if she finds out that he has called you again, maybe she will come after you? YOu need to put this all to an end.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	I would of called the wife and let her know that she needs to really give up an the fool that he is at it again and thank her for letting you know that he was married. Be thankful that it wasn't you that is married to him and going through all this.|`|0AShsMsoaa	he is calling cause he thinks you are easy, stupid, and easily swayed.  <br>  <br>  change your number and make sure next time your new boyfriend isnt married.<br>  <br>  there are 3 sides to this triangle and you are one of them. <br>  <br>  how about you quit talking to someone else's husband.|`|AhIUqmiRaa	Erm. . . whats the question? If it once a cheat always a cheat? then I agreee, yes, if you are able to do anything once, you can do it again.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	I have lots of respect that you have behaved very maturely and wisely.  <br>  <br>  People cheat for various reasons.  Often, the cheating is only a symptom of other deeper issues in a marriage or relationship.<br>  <br>  Unless his wife and he have put in the hard work to figure out and resolve those deeper issues, he is likely to find other channels to seek "comfort" and escape those issues, e.g. cheating is one easy channel.<br>  <br>  If he does not recognize that cheating does not solve issues in his marriage or even his own problems, he will always be a cheater...including cheating on you if you decide to be with him now or in the future.|`|UFOdwXgfaa	It depends <br>  <br>  But very unlikely he would say " Ok, I had enough sex with the other woman and I'm now content with the wife" So yes, once a cheat always a cheat especially if they know they got away with it the first time, very likely he could get a way with it a second time|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Simply....once a cheat, always a cheat. I think a wife who would forgive that kind of indescretion is not secure within herself.|`|AA10500537	yes  once a cheat always a cheat and when he was cheating with you he was cheating on you with someone else , so back off  dont answer his calls|`|scnW0Wzeaa	I hope his wife divorces him.  You will move on with your life. Now that <br>  the dirt bag is out of it.|`|3fbc09a4f95e4122e563714d654a599eaa	Married men lie.  Not only do they lie by going out and cheat on their spouse.  They lie about how the spouse treats them and how bad it is in the home.  He will go out with you and cry cry cry stating how much his wife nags and doesn't want sex and doesn't do anything bla bla bla however when your date is all over and the next day begans he is trying to get some from his wife stating how much he loves her and how wonderful she is and how lucky of a man he is to be married to such a wonderful woman.  You are being played as well.  Be smart find your own man.|`|AA10958272	"Anyway, fast forward to this week...he called me again. He wants to start up again when the dust has settled."<br>  <br>  How did you meet the guy? online? on line at Dunkin? where?<br>  <br>  You KNOW the guy, now. And you're still talking with him -- even after your BS about the wife's perspective, etc. etc.?  (what's up with that?)  Why be a Drama Queen and pretend to people here, anonymously that you're just a victim and he's doing something to you? he's a loser and you're not too far away from that, either.. in fact, worse in the eyes of the Church, you know... move on, and save yourself some dignity. Now, seriously -- what is IN IT FOR YOU?<br>  <br>  You must be very young and captivated by a man with a car, that can pay for drinks & a hotel? what is it? you get gifts from him? there's an age-old story that seems pretty obvious to many of us, reading about it.. you know.|`|fYcYPyR3aa	I think people can make mistakes because they are only human, and by a mistake I mean a one night thing when they were drunk or depressed or something but if it's a relationship behind their partners back or more than once then yeah, I think once a cheat always a cheat. This guy is a loser he lied to you and his wife and you should block his number. I also think you should tell his wife that he wants to startup with you again because he doesn't deserve her and if he isn't getting any from you all he'll do is try to find some other girl to cheat on his wife with, and she doesn't deserve that.|`|91PAOwFzaa	OK well just walk away from him. If you were married to him and he was doing that to you you'd be furious! Now he wants to do it again <br>  Tell him it's not right and if he wants to cheat on his wife then do it with someone else...walk away you don't need this. See in the future you'll know why he didn't make it to your future|`|PshRhxqraa	He obviously believes your morals to be as corrupt as his.  Make sure he understands that they are not.  Tell him if he ever does leave his wife then you will consider dating him, but only after he has divorced properly and is a free man again.<br>  <br>  In fact, I would be tempted to either threaten to tell his wife, or actually tell her.  You could be saving her a lot of heartbreak in the long run.<br>  <br>  What a scumbag.|`|zh2nuHVTaa	Honestly if he could do that to someone he was married to and go back to her while he was with both of you i would tell him to go fly a kite. What if you guys are in a relationship and who's to say he wont do that to you because he probably will. He wants his cake and eat it to.|`|2772e87aa33409feddb59d5fab2d13f9aa	Do not continue to see this married man because honestly..you will be the one who gets hurt, I can promise you that one.  Not only is it morally wrong to be with a married man..it could be dangerous.  He's an idiot for taking this chance.  There are so many fish in the sea, why mess with one that is spoken for.  It's like asking for someone to rip your heart out of your chest.  <br>  I only speak from experience...|`|byYNmef3aa	contact the wife and set the dirt bag up between you ,it will save the next Girl in his sights because you can bet there is one ,its called pay back time just love to see a grown man cry .|`|PA7kYyAxaa	This man is a charlatan.

Make him feel like a cheat. How dare he has been playing with feelings of both women ? Having sex with both of them and telling both of them that " I love you" ? <br>  <br>  Confront him and ask him before taking any decision so that you wont repent at the end. Did you notice that after his wife caught him, he went to his wife and didn't stay with you. Do you think that he will stand with you in all thick and thins ?He ran to his wife and cooled her down. You were also shocked but he didn't stay with you. Was he a kid that he couldn't contact you. It surely shows his priorities. Please be safe.|`|ZfRucXTMaa	Okay... the first time you did not know he was married so you can not be blamed for that.  But now you KNOW HE'S MARRIED! Stay away from him.  He is a scumbag for cheating on his wife and trying to continue to do so. It doesn't matter of he is happily married or if he hates his wife.  As long as he is married, leave him alone.  And even if he were to get divorced, odds are he would do the same thing to you as he did to his wife.  Do you really think that you are the first person he cheated on his wife with and do you think you will be the last? If you chose to continue this relationship with him then you are no better than he is. And your comment about his wife causing a lot of drama when she found out.. what did you expect? How would you react if you were in her shoes? Trust me you may not have gone the bad words route yet but I am sure you have been called ever bad name in the world. If you continue to talk to him then you deserve all the drama you are going to get.|`|eWMn7dhKaa	Pretty much.  Yes.<br>  <br>  That's not to say that that person will always cheat, or ever that they will cheat again.  What the phrase means is that they have been labeled and can no longer have that label removed.<br>  <br>  Kinda like being labeled a pedophile.  Once you're labeled as such, you can never have that label removed.  That's not to say that the person will ever conduct illicit matters with children or even be in contact with another child their entire life, but they are labeled and thus cannot escape from that label no matter what or where they may try to do or go.<br>  <br>  I used that example to show you the extreme version of what I was giving you as an explanation.

Work on self-improvement and confidence no matter what the actions of "the opposite sex".  When you have real confidence, you'll know longer have a need for that insecure behavior of distrusting every girl and being jealous all the time.<br>  <br>  You know what it will feel like?

KE8qQp7Gaa	You sound a lot like me when I was younger. I swore up and down that I was straight, but I always had a thing about girls. It wasn't until I got with my first girlfriend that I realized that I was really a lesbian. It's normal to be bi-curious as a teenager. But it doesn't make you a lesbian, yet. You'll figure it out in time. If you have sex with a woman, still doesn't make you a lesbian. If you are only attracted to women, that makes you a lesbian. But as you said, you like guys. So you're probably just confused right now. Don't worry, you'll know soon enough what you are. Just keep yourself open to the possibilities and don't be afraid of who you are either way.|`|4HoVVCenaa	You are bi-curious... not a big thing. Don't worry about it.|`|4YK4tBW5aa	That doesn't make you a lesbian. You would be a lesbian if you were into only girls and not guys.|`|AA11603529	Maybe you're bi or bi-curious.

a06EEbaoaa	if they are retired that means theyre much older (obviously) and judging by the way you type and the fact that you mentioned you dont want your parents to get after you for talking to them leads me to believe that you are way too young for them. even though theyre "rebel hot guys" i dont think they want to go to jail for being a pedophile. my conclusion: stay in school and find someone your own age.|`|HvUurCygaa	maybe if ur parents knew them a bit better they wouldnt think in that way!!.....................
G9ywiLqvaa	although it's absolutely normal for you to feel this way, i'd try my best to let it slide.  the past is the past.  and although i'd be pissed too if i were in your shoes, you can't pull vengeance on your own blood, specially your own mother.  just keep in mind that you know she's always been miserable.  and soon she'll realize how horrible she was to her kids and be even more miserable.  just let karma handle it for you.  <br>  another thing to remember through your resentment:  you can never right a wrong with another wrong.<br>  you've finally found peace.  enjoy it.  you deserve it. :)<br>  |`|l94xNrHFaa	There is nothing wrong with you. Whenever we go through hardships in life we often times revert back to the most primal urges i.e.: if you hurt me i am going to hurt you back. I think that maybe you should sit down with your mom and really talk and express how she made you feel when all of this was happening. and remember to listen and give consideration to what she says as well. And remember if you really feel like you might hit your mom please seek out the advice and help of your friends and family as violence is never the answer.|`|dXPYQHVBaa	I think its normal for you to feel some resentment there for her treating you badly. I have some towards my mother as well. But im not sure if you should be having feelings about wanting to seriously hurt her. Maybe you should try to see a counselor about how you are feeling. But please, don't do anything to physically harm her. She is still your mother.
zhaHc4FAaa	Hon...I am right there in the same boat with you with the exception that I am 35.  I still have hope and I know that things will work out the way they are supposed to.  Keep a positive attitude.   26 is NOT old.   You are nearly 10 years younger than I am.   If I had to do it all over again I would get out more.  Instead of taking the same route to work and home...try a different route....introduce yourself to people, strike up a conversation.   I read a book called finding a date worth keeping and he suggests to date alot for fun...not to find a mate but you have to be proactive.   Like anything in life if you want something you have to be out there and make yourself available.  Sitting at home in front of the TV will never get you noticed.  Smile...be active and see what happens.  You never know who you will be when you least expect it.|`|HXDLtxBEaa	First you have to think positive.

Girly please. See you're looking at life from all the wrong sides. Take life one step at a time. Don't settle down if he isn't the best you can have. Let's say you wouldn't of being rejected by this guy what makes him the one? You don't know that for a fact. Doesn't mean that you guys would get married. Plus life is to short...to make a mistake like that. To be single isn't a burden...you just know that you deserve the best. First of you need to make friends your age...and that are SINGLE...this way you guys will have lots of things in common and will go out and enjoy life. Now I'm not saying crazy friends either they'll take you no where good. But when you go out and about you'll meet new people and that includes guys. Have fun with life and enjoy it. B/c once your married and have children life will be very different.|`|ksiPMWUaaa	Listen, if you havn't found the right guy right now, it's okay. think of the world as a more positive place and then you'll realize that there are nice funny smart great guys all around you! and if thats just not working DON'T EVER go out with someone just becuz ur desprerate! its not worth it. and maybe you'll find that you don't need a guy with you at all times because you can just you out with a friend, it doesn't even have to be a close friend. just go shopping, to the beach, a movie. have a great time with ur friends and things will turn out alright in the end, with or without a man. <br>      Good Luck! I'm sure he's out there!|`|uogSquOyaa	Hang in there, I'm 26 years old and I'm going thru the same thing right now. I agree with the other person, try going out more and have fun. When you're alone, I guess it''s important to be around people.
qLJnCj0Naa	I think you should give it one last shot. that way you know for sure if he is really interested in hanging out with you. you have nothing to loose, and you'll be able to move on.|`|zPSXuWDTaa	I think is nice that you would like to spend a little of his time as a friend but it's better to let him be so he can figure things out on his own.you don't have to forget about him just move on with your life there's plenty of time for you waiting around is not going to help either maybe some day he will get in contact with you but for now have options do things for your self flirt with other guys and have fun life is much easier that way.|`|vaqEzhkaaa	try once more, then toss in the towel. he should be pursuing you if he is really really into you

But don't worry you did the right think, there should always be communication between couples, even to tell them what we don't like or don't feel confortable with.|`|MtL2fZjOaa	I dont think that you were wrong in confronting him because you have morals and that you should let him know what is important to you.  But at the same time it sounds like you yelled at him pretty bad.  I think it would have been better if you talked to him about it rather than yelling.|`|OXnbZyoJaa	I don't think you were wrong to confront him, that's one of the things relationships are about, telling your partner if you're uncomfortable with something or if something's bothering you. |`|PNA7f0q3aa	Of coarse you weren't. But hopefully you confronted him in a polite manner, and more understandable. He should've known his mistakes, and hopefully appologized.|`|A6ldIOCpaa	It's good that you told him, he better remember. If he doesn't maybe you should reconsider what your getting yourself into with this relationship.|`|lg6jexk7aa	No, of course you weren't wrong - he did something illegal and while it may have only been milk - what else might he be willing to steal?|`|ZVb8azf2aa	No, you weren't wrong.  Sounds like you're a stand up girl.  If he couldn't afford it he shouldn't have taken it. Maybe you can teach him some morals! =)|`|iRKtKpSyaa	Noooooo!!! You were not wrong to confront him!<br>  <br>  Stealing is so wrong, and you're lucky he didn't get caught, because you both would have gotten into trouble!|`|DpQLIAVgaa	Of course not, if caught im pretty sure you both would have got into trouble! Stealing is wrong so you did the better thing and were the bigger person by confronting him.|`|94M1QQ8paa	no, i think he appreciated your concern for him.!|`|AA11596133	NO, you were totally RIGHT for confronting him.  Can you imagine what would of happened if he got caught and the owners of the store prosecuted him for it? (I know store owners that would) That would totally ruin his reputation for YEARS - and for WHAT.  Stealing is WRONG, no matter what "excuse" you think you have, there really IS no good reason to take things that are NOT yours.<br>  <br>  ALWAYS stand up for what you KNOW is right - it shows you are of excellent moral character.  Don't worry about your boyfriend - it will all blow over in no time.  At least he knows now how you feel, right?  My guess is he will not do THAT again.|`|7mgnxmnfaa	No not wrong, what if he had got caught, then you would have really been embarrassed over some milk, plus it doesn't matter what it is if you take something from someone or someplace you are stealing, and stealing shows a deceitful personality, and with deceit there is lying, dishonesty is this really a person that you want to be with?|`|XZTf8Eahaa	Hello, No you where not wrong you done the right thing tell him if he does it again you will dump him.|`|A9cH8CL9aa	not wrong at all :) |`|J8NEZ4V0aa	you're not wrong at all!!!!!!
AA11579268	Yeah he's in love with me!!!!!!!!!!!
zQD2dlCiaa	With confidence. If you're a slack and you cry yourself to sleep at night then you can kiss that girl goodbye. Oh, wait... actually you can't kiss her.<br>  <br>  Build up some confidence in yourself and try to be more relaxed around women.

Being drunk is not an excuse.|`|AA11139133	get a new boyfriend.|`|a56b5b19fc49ac86a93efb5bb5523ca7aa	It happened which should not have had.  Anyhow thank God that you have escaped from that guy without bruises.  Both of them were not sincere to you, your b/f as well as best friend jointly cheated you.  Do you still want to continue your friendship with them ? Let them go to their way.

hjhKMvVIaa	Just ask her out. Just hanging out sounds like friendship, and if you want an actual dating realtionship then you don't want to ask her to 'hang out'. I bet she will say yes. You never know till you try...<br>  <br>  PS Guys actually use 'lol' how old are you???|`|0io9qoJXaa	talk about your mutual friend. The one who you both know, and say something like "hey, i'm _________'s friend."|`|RwDacQlQaa	maybe start talking to her like askinggg whatsupp and just start a convoo.<br>  then yaa do that again and agian ;evryday.<br>  then eventualy it wont just be watup it could be like so u wanna hangout and then u do and u tlak more and then after a few times hanginout you ask her to datee you|`|jksDMYCRaa	Talk to her some more. Start with "Hi, GoodMorning/Afternoon". Try to start conversations with her. Dont show her that you are shy. Just hope for the best. But dont over do it; it sometimes get annoying. Just try to spend more time with her. Stay CHiLL. Be yourself.Then when it is the right time then you can go ask her to a date or just hang out. Then when you truly like her then you can ask her out.<br>  I hope this helped you!|`|S8XaSZCYaa	If you aren't able to talk to her then it might be kind of difficult to have a relationship anyway.<br>  <br>  But just a suggestion, just ask to hang out for now because if you work together and something goes wrong then it will become strenuous|`|qCJeVHQNaa	bring it up. tell her that you know that the girl ratted you out, it'll make it less awkward... then see her answer and move from there...|`|vh6a9P1zaa	i think you should ask her friend what the girl that you like is into. for example have your friend causually bring up the movies..or something like that..get her to find out what she wants to see..or is looking fwd to. then as you are walkin by/with her just mention it and say how you are stoaked to see it and start talking about the funny trailors or actors in it. then just say "well im going to go see it soon would you like to join me?" or something like that. if its a no just keep trying and dont give up

Don't spend the whole time thinking about things or feeling nervous or awkward.|`|Dc6rDZ0Oaa	just be yourself... talk about subjects that u both have interests like movies, music, summer activities. and have fun. your date won't be "scripted" so just enjoy it.|`|cGKCd9I3aa	follow everyone elses advice and watch out for date rape drugs.|`|bhCscRmwaa	Just be yourself..<br>  And know that he is nervous too|`|cksdCQ3taa	first impressions are great as long as they are made the right way. and the only way to do it is by being yourself. <br>  <br>  talk about the movie or who plays in it. ask him what kind of things he likes (foods, sports, movies, music, ect.) keep it light and easy <br>  <br>  be confident about your own personality. know that it will get you through|`|N3257eolaa	just talk about normal stuff (sports, school, summer, the mall, movies, etc) Don't try to impress anyone its not cool at all!!|`|r0qqn7Alaa	hmm.....y must have a tips to date with ur BF. Just do whatever u like and show the real urself. i think is much more easier and comfortable to u to do that. Actually, there is no tips and it is better that to have no tips. cos, you will felt quite bored if u followed the tips. i mean, u are not really show the true of urself and u intentionally to plan to have a date with ur bf. so, come on gal, think positive there is no hard to have a date with guy. hehe...by the way, i think the guy who wanna come out with a gal already plan what to do after this and that.And also what topic he wanna share with u. so, u dun have to worry if u dun have that kind of the tips...hehe..
Molu004zaa	If he doesn't want to propose, you can't FORCE him to :/ And why should HE be the one to propose? If you want to get married, YOU do it!|`|AA10816337	Not much. He'll do it when he's ready. But you can start like pointing related things out in a magazine or when you go shopping.|`|0wkSf58waa	Unfortunately, you can't make him propose to you. If this is something that is on your mind maybe you should talk to him about it. If you're wondering why he won't make the big commitment to you it may be something worth talking about. I don't know if you live with him but often times if a guy sees a girl will live with him without making a commitment to her, he won't ever pop the question.|`|5SNraNUfaa	are you serious?!  what is stopping you from proposing to him?  why should he have to be the one to cement your relationship with marriage?  If he isn't ready then he isn't ready.  be strong for once and take a chance.
BqFKbjfiaa	I agree with the others. Tell him. If ya'll have been together that long-----each of you have gone through some changes, good and bad. AS you grow older, you loose interest for somethings. For instance, my 4yr old daughter likes barbie. Everything she does and says is all about barbie. Just last year, when she was 3, everything she did and said was all about DORA. She grew older and began to loose interest in Dora. She still watches it from time to time, but not as often as she dedicates her time to barbie.<br>  <br>  You were with him when you were at the tender age of finding out who you were and all about. There is no reason to keep lying and faking how you really feel. Let him know that he is a great guy and someone would be lucky to have him. Let him know that there is nothing he could have done differently. He might be a the point where he is ready for futuristic this such as marriage, kids, or buying house, but you aren't and that is not your focus. You will always love him and if it is meant to be, after ya'll go your seperate ways, you will meet again.|`|UIeBnAtDaa	Just tell him.  She will be optimist.  For 1 go, 10 is coming.|`|0opc9mnJaa	move on you wont regret it just stay confident|`|kLQm7ZEXaa	its better to tell him now than to lead him on...on to something that ur not happy with..its important for him to know.|`|FEy55BNTaa	Eight years is a long time to be in a relationship for someone as young as yourself. Maybe you guys are just in a rut. Is there something in particular about him that bothers or annoys you? Have you tried talking to him about how you are feeling? How does he feel about the relationship? As difficult as it may be, if you ultimately don't have romantic feelings for him, you need to be honest. Don't stick with him just b/c you feel bad for him or b/c you are afraid of change. You will regret it in the long run.|`|Ak6SIDAaaa	im sorry thats really hard. I hate breaking up with people. But if you arent in love with him any more.. you NEED to break it off... its not healthy.. i know your worried but he might even feel the same way... but is also to scared to tell you. You can bring it up by saying "Our relationship isn't what is use to be.. i dont know if you feel it... but its been bothing me and i think we need to talk...." Theres no easy way to do this... you just have to find the right words... hope this helps, good luck|`|j1fumaMtaa	just let him down gently, tell him how u feel.  ur doing was right, you don't wanna be in a relationship where ur not happy, and if u don't feel anything for him, ur kind cheating him out of a meaningful relationship 2.|`|jyTOHQqdaa	YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM OR YOU'LL LIVE IN MISERY.|`|xjBFwsVMaa	Wow 8 years...... anyways If you don't feel anything for him you have to tell him. It's gonna be hard but you HAVE to. Unless you want to stay in a relationship that has gone crappy.... I wouldln't suggest it because you would begin to despise him and then you'll have a blow out fight and break up... you may as well do it now and do it civilized.|`|nBxXvoyIaa	u have to tell him <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Askad_6gsX35MGkySMJfqeDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080712194822AAYROVm">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

9smIJDNlaa	You shouldn't be going on his myspace in the first place that is "his space". Its fine that your curious and stuff but don't do anything drastic like deleting his friends. Its not a big deal if he is still friends with his ex girlfriend, maybe he is still involved with making sure she is fine with her situation.|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	Don't delete anything on his page - that's his personal business. Why does it matter if his myspace friends are skinny? He's not dating them, and he shouldn't not be friends with them because of their weight. I think you're getting way too worked up over this. Let it go and enjoy yourself.|`|tfqpb5XQaa	is he not allowed to have friends? :s<br>  really, its just myspace. lol. don't worry about it. most people have a lot of people on their friends list they don't even know. for all you know he might not know them..they might be a friend from work..school..anything.<br>  and if they are his ex's, he can still stay friends, maybe he has them on his friends list for the sake of it, it doesn't mean he even likes those girls|`|FQeSo65Haa	I can't really understand what you're saying. Maybe he used to partial to skinny girls, who know .. Just observe him for a while and you can tell what's the truth|`|9GW3hfKZaa	I left my e-mail account up by mistake one time and my husband took it upon himself to read everything I had saved.  Although there was nothing incriminating on there he misunderstood some things and his imagination went wild.  the point is,  even though things are blocked, locked or stored doesn't mean there is deceit going on.  People like to feel that they have some privacy in their life.  Just because I think the sun rises & sets on Robert Downey Jr. doesn't mean that my husband is a big turn off for me.|`|SAQZIh13aa	Anorexic, fat, thin, obese or two heads on one body,should not make a difference as to anyone being a friend to these people.You can't judge a person by looks.A True friend see's way past that and gets to know people from the inside.Does it really matter who is on his pc? You say you are not jealous, then let it be Poppet. I am sure if anything untoward was going on you would get the message soon enough.|`|cd857b777b62dde2e9ce4563183b18a8aa	Not too odd.  If he only a them as friends then I would be worried but if he has many and they are only a few, don't even worry about it.  If he didn't like you as your are, would he still be there?  Your fine!  He likes you so log off his account and don't even give it a second though.|`|bCJqPRnIaa	Just ask him about it. if it matters to you that much he proberbly has a reasonable explanation for it.<br>  <br>  But dont listen to all these "hes sick dump him" that will pop up :)|`|mvu0yrF8aa	nope i see it all the time|`|SXXgotiuaa	OMG. dumb? and you are a snoop.I think women like you should be single because you will always look for reasons.|`|EFdc8Ddmaa	It's odd that you post your question here for the whole world to see, but you don't ask your boy friend.<br>  <br>  |`|ibAPfe8Faa	lol its funny how we say "my myspace"|`|FC0CPzv3aa	we all hang on to the past to a degree...I wouldnt worry about it unless he starts acting real different<br>  <br>  as for your weight..most people, as rule of thumb, dont have a particular type, they may like brown hair, but dont care about size, or they might like skinny..but dont care about eyes or hair or religion :P they may like tall, but only if shes got green eyes...theres so many different combinations :P <br>  <br>  Relax hun, by all means keep an eye on it..but DONT GET PARANOID OVER IT..well not just yet lol!! Distrust will kill a relationship fast!|`|zHtc3RuMaa	I think it has NOTHING to do with his preferences on women. He would have them in his friends list because that's how myspace works, girls ram don ask to become friends and all he does is accept them.  Don't be jealous or insecure; also don't delete because you wouldn't like if he would do that you.  If he wanted to be with an anorexic girl he wouldn'f be with you. Just relax and don't it a big deal. Treat him good and give lots of love and he will always be with you.|`|ISC00ROGaa	this doesn't mean for sure that he has something with his ex or with this girls.tell him frankly how do you feel.just share.and don't let the "ghost of the ex one" ruin everything you have. ;)|`|aObiycVqaa	it's kinda odd to be truthfull confront him about it.|`|cwG8yPfOaa	yep it is odd|`|izdMPK87aa	it is odd but just dont worry about it<br>  |`|7Pa24ZxUaa	Well that's odd... but i don't think it really matters, it's just his friends... |`|6xjAsKbHaa	I'm sorry, I can't understand what you are trying to say.  Can you clarify it a bit?|`|QJduXC4Kaa	i think you just got a bit paranoid...besides, my space's pictures are small, how could you tell they were so thin?
mvu0yrF8aa	just ask her. it may be hard but its worth it <br>  <br>  Good luck =)|`|vWckvYOIaa	Straight up is the way to do it.  Being direct is an attractive trait.
vfu62Jrpaa	hmmmm  yes he deff likes you <br>  <br>  <br>  this will be really scary well very very scary but do it<br>  <br>   ask him if he likes you if he saids yes tell him u like him if he saids no tell him u like him no matter what<br>  <br>  |`|mvu0yrF8aa	what are u waiting for? ask him out before he loses interest <br>  <br>  Good Luck =)|`|PRjKiM2uaa	Sounds like he likes you too but is afraid you dont feel the same about him.|`|yiNbMj5Caa	tell him u would like to spend more private time with him, see what he says. 
UyOqrOyIaa	i just asked my husband and he sayd that usually that means hes interested but hes shy.. and hes trying to see if you like him back or not.. he says next time you see him you poke him first tickle him ect.. and that should make him more confident to make a move,. btw we both wish u luck|`|Kgi8vvvoaa	Hes flirting and if you like him do what comes natural and flirt back I need some points to get to level 2 PLEASE!!!.............POKE ;P|`|97496b6a03daee4b080d0a7b2f5e3643aa	He probably likes you and that is his way of flirting. Let him make the first move but play with him as well. You should bat your eyes and do what girls do best to attract guys. He will come around if he really like you.|`|2B2ACYK9aa	could just be playful could be more, i like to belive the latter, i have the same problem with this girl....I may make a move soon but which one? try spending more time with him making eye contact and physical contact here and there|`|mvu0yrF8aa	i think he wants to take your friendship to the next level; as in dating|`|yiNbMj5Caa	that means he likes u a lot|`|GouzcFRFaa	ask him how he fell s   and then go with it<br>

What, are we living in the old west? If you want something. buy it yourself. If you don't have the money, earn it. Sounds like you want everything. Not just your brother. <br>  He didn't have to marry her either. He could have shipped her illegal butt back where it belonged. |`|QzWHMGHJaa	So get a job and buy your own clothes.  You can't change your Dad, all you can do is whatever it takes to make things better for yourself.  Either that or call Child protective services and turn him in.|`|Xbw1g7WAaa	Call child services in your state, if you are afraid to do it yourself explain to a teacher at school what your situation is and he or she might be able to do it for you.
ZygHWm4naa	Maybe you should have a drink to get yourself relaxed. I wouldn't recommend that yall just rush into it and you just wait for him to stick it inside you. Foreplay.. Kiss.. play little games so yall want more of each other.. (You can go and get the big dices when words on them and play this...). And Waxing is another suggestion; I wax mine only for the "I feel more feminine" feeling. But men really like it when it's more clean and wiped down, down there so they have an easier access. To be honest just be yourself. I mean, that is why he's with you.. and waited to have sex for this long. He's probably as scared as you are! You could in fact talk to him about it ahead of time instead of just rushing right into it. It's more passionate that way.|`|TtxwUdzdaa	Honey, Good luck.  You know when people say " The first time is the best time" - THATS A LIE.  The first time a woman has sex, it hurts - real bad.  Yes please - put on your sexy nightwear, whatever you have in mind is probably a good choice - enjoy the foreplay and just be free, relax, say and do whatever you feel, cause by the time he gets in there - IT IS GOING TO HURT. It will be worse if he has a big one.  After you do it about two or three times, it wont be painful anymore, and you can start enjoying yourself and having orgasms.  the first time you do it - it is unlikely you will have an orgasm.  GOOD LUCK.,... USE A CONDOM - be safe.|`|qFuIfIqSaa	wear something sexy<br>  <br>  it's gunna feel good and make sure you act kinda aggressive like you're experienced - grab his **** and suck it like no tomorrow and then ride it really good.|`|1TX7xgOxaa	F O R N I C A T I O N<br>  you're in trouble, one of the deadly sins...|`|FvVOFw12aa	Wear something that makes you feel sexy and turns him on.<br>  RELAX. <br>  Make sure you are cleaned and groomed down there. Brush your teeth well, apply some perfume.<br>  Since it it your first time, it will feel very tight and warm. Get some KY and place a little at the entrance of your vagina. You can also buy some KY lquid beads and place it inside you now and it will keep you lubricated for a days and help reduce friction and drying out.<br>  RELAX. <br>  Just don't lay there like a dead fish, move to his motions, If it feels good moan and let him know! Use your hands on him, Stroke his back, butt legs ect. Explore each other but most of all have FUN.|`|EGUghP45aa	All you have to do is lay down and wait for him to stick his penis inside your vagina. You will feel a smooth rubbing inside your body. Then your vagina will squirt a bit of fluid and you will moan with pleasure. |`|o2kDFd3laa	it's gonna hurt of course wear the sexiest under clothes ever and make sure your pussy is clean and shaved|`|f0b18c3ae6eb2b57fac89dc67f12ca13aa	u say ur nearly married. why not wait just that little bit longer?<br>  <br>  if your sure ur ready just relax and enjoy the moment.|`|3648e98700b8351146e2b5699bd638ecaa	yeah right, a virgin? no such thing as a virgin. |`|e64c0ca0358d1542fe123074c9b6ce76aa	Relax. Have him wear protection. RELAX. Doesn't matter what you wear, whatever you are comfortable in. But most importantly, RELAX. |`|sY6ZI2Ooaa	Hunnie 1st & fore most.... RELAX!!! I'm not sure how old you are but I give much respect for someone who saves them self for marriage!!! You could wear something very sexy & seductive or just one of his white shirts work too. The more you relax & concentrate on the act of LOVE MAKING the better it will be for both of you, if your only having SEX then don't do it! Being your first time, there will be an odd sense of awkwardness but if it's his first time too.... it won't matter. I can tell you,  don't just lay there but believe it or not the more open you are the better the experience. I sure hope your old enough to make that decision. 
OfZHyuohaa	Yes because you've been intimate with this other guy and now you're hanging out with him.  What's to stop you all from "hooking up" again?  I'm sure you wouldn't tell your boyfriend.  Come on now woman have some common freaking sense, either you cut off contact with the ex or you leave your current boyfriend and become a single woman and do what you want to do.  Its that simple.|`|IbJ2O0vpaa	You talk with your ex twice a week and now want to start having dinner with him, and keep it a secret?  I'm not sure when you call it cheating, but the secret talks are not good, and the secret hanging out would be when I ended things, personally..<br>  <br>  If you bring your boyfriend along, hanging out with your ex isn't cheating.  Maybe try that.  If that doesn't appeal to you, you have a problem in your relationship.|`|AA11501437	the golden rule is always a good one to remember...<br>  <br>  How would you feel if he was doing the same behind your back?<br>  <br>  I think that if you really felt you weren't doing anything wrong, you would have no problems talking with him about it.  If you are hell bent on a friendship with the ex, maybe invite your boyfriend to go to dinner with the 2 of you.  If the ex is really a good friend, I would think he would want to be friends with your boyfriend also.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Honey, be honest with your man.  IF he's okay with him being your friend, then by all means...it's okay.  But I certainly would like it and if you don't tell him, you'll look like your sleeping with him again...Just be honest.  Tell him he's just a friend but that he (your current man) is more important and you value how he feel about you having a relationship with this person.  It's the right thing to do.|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	If you can't tell your boyfriend what you're doing, then it's dishonest and some might call  "dating" another man cheating.<br>  If you can't be honest about what you're doing then you're a liar.|`|c049edfa5536b651a0107995bcbc3a08aa	If you are not cheating....then shouldn't the BF know about it....<br>  <br>  Otherwise why are you hiding it....unless of course you have something to hide.|`|AA11990465	Since your b/f doesnt know about this other guy, yeah, its cheating. |`|AA11322117	Sorry to answer this way, but I'd actually say yes.  It seems like you'd be setting yourself up for -- at the bare minimum -- an emotional affair with this other guy.   It would be unfair to your boyfriend to not let him know about this other guy.  I'd certainly want my wife to let me know if she had any guy friends -- especially ones with the past that your guy friend has with you.  It's better to be safe, and not become involved in a close friendship with this guy.  I make it a point to have a structured, group environment setting, if I see any friends of mine that are female.  That way, my wife knows (and she's usually there anway) that even the potential for an affair has been eliminated by prudent decision making.  If you value your relationship with your boyfriend, I would discuss this with him frankly.  Hope that helps.|`|A7FXmvxdaa	yes it could be physiological cheating as well as emotional you didn't want to share these emotions with him and to be talk with this guy and keeping it hidden it would be considered emotional cheating when he does find out if he does it could be physiological cheating as well him not knowing if you are being honest with him about what it was really about and how it was so important that it was hidden and not been communicated in the relationship.|`|i6eO7hDGaa	Like alot of other people on here have already said, be honest and tell your man. If you say that you are only friends and it will remain that way and you feel not threat, then tell your boyfriend. He may accept it or he may not. If you love your boyfriend and want to be with him, you may have to respect his wishes if he can't accept it.|`|aab45f426df1b68c3d660e7983cb70faaa	Yes, it is.  But if you tell your bf that you are going to hang out with hi the it is not cheating. There should be no secrets between you both...how would you feel if he was seeing and talking to an ex gf of his but he did not tell you...would you be upset? I think you would and you would ask why he couldnt just tell you...if there was really nothing going on. |`|PEHo8g48aa	It don't seem right if you don't tell your boyfriend! Think of this. What if you were out with him and one of his friends,family members or even himself sees you. Think of his reaction, you don't know what he might think at that time. Be up front and truthful with your boyfriend, this way you will know how he feels about it.|`|mrouA15Eaa	You should tell your boyfriend.....if you don't then he will think it is cheating.<br>  <br>  It isn't cheating because you have no intentions of cheating on him....Can he trust you?  can you trust yourself that the old feelings won't come back for this other guy.  There is a reason you are not telling your boyfriend.....what is it?|`|7IPDyLoBaa	If your boyfriend doesn't know about this then yes its cheating.<br>  <br>  Why would you hide this from your boyfriend?<br>  <br>  How would you feel if your boyfriend was hanging out with another woman without your knowledge?...Not to thrilled im sure.<br>  <br>  Keeping secrets in a relationship is wrong so grow up and stop sneaking around on your boyfriend.|`|8v3YY24raa	If you have to keep it a secret from your current boyfriend that means something. If you truly just want to re-kindle a FRIENDSHIP, then just be honest with your current boyfriend and tell him straight up all of the info you have given us. There is nothing wrong with hanging out with your ex again, but only if he knows your in a serious relationship and respects that. Also, keeping it a secret any longer could cause damage to your relationship. Always be up front and honest.
XpppDvwwaa	It was never easy. I am 27 now and looking back on 13-18 if I had to do it again I would not. If I could change a couple of things about what I did back then, I would have focused more on my studies and sports and less on boys and stupid parties. This is invaluable advice if you're serious about looking at your adolescence differently. I wish I could have done these 10 things differently:  <br>  1. Make a difference in someones life positively. <br>  <br>  2. Be good to people. There is no reason to hate on a dork or an ugly person. They did nothing to you. Goodness comes back around. You'll see. <br>  <br>  3. Don't gossip. Only people who dislike themselves have to gossip. <br>  <br>  4. Make the most out of each day in other words turn off the TV and get outside and enjoy the day. <br>  <br>  5. Do things you're fearful of like public speaking, acting in a play or joining a school club. <br>  <br>  6. Understand that you're parents just want what's best for you. <br>  <br>  7. Focus less on materialistic wants like clothes, jewelry or a car. <br>  <br>  8. Do what your heart tells you not what some stupid popular girl or guy wants. <br>  <br>  9. Don't give up your virginity or have sex with someone just because you feel pressured or he/she won't like you anymore if you don't.<br>  <br>  10. You can't understand this now because you're going thru it every day but the issues that you find so profoundly huge and overwhelming ARE NOT. <br>  <br>  Believe it or not, life gets so much better once you finish middle school and high school. <br>  <br>  Seriously, don't freak out and do something stupid because you think the world is ending because someone broke up with you or you're not getting your way with your parents. It's not the end of the world I can assure you. <br>  <br>  So many kids these days choose to take their lives for the littlest issues. They end up turning a temporary situation into a permenant solution. Don't do that. Just enjoy your youth. <br>  |`|n8lXItGraa	I hated being a teenager.  I was small and....flat for my age.  I was always picked on by the boys that said I looked like a little boy.  I wasn't one of the popular girls at all, but that was OK because I didn't like their personalities anyway.  I was lonely, and figured if I died...no biggie.  I wouldn't try to kill myself or anything like that, but if it happened...oh well.  I hated gym day.  I'd find a shower that didn't have a next door occupant, get my hair wet, and leave.  No way was I going to change in front of these condemning girls.  I was shy, and didn't really talk to anyone I didn't know.  I was insecure and afraid to try anything new. I was afraid of the future, and wanted to hold on to the past.  the only time I felt secure in what I was doing was when I babysat.  I guess the maternal thing was set in place at a young age.  I finally started to date when I was almost 17, a man 10 years older than I.  I was thrilled that someone loved me...I thought I'd never be with anyone...at 17. I won't even get into the sex part of it, sure wan't ready for it, that's for sure.  Looking back on those times,  what the hell was I thinking?  My life was just beginning.  So what if at 17 I hadn't dated or kissed a guy yet?  But I was so happy with having a boy friend and being "normal".  Normal...something I've never felt I was.  So to make a long story short...I married him...and divorced him.  Lesson learned.  Being a teen these days I think is harder then back in the 70's.  yeah...I'm as old as dirt lol!  There's so much more pressure on kids of this generation, and most parents have no idea what's going on with them because they all work!  When parents are spending 50-60 hours a week at work and commuting, they're just dead tired when they come home.  I'm sure there's not as much family time anymore.  Kids are left to figure things out on their own, which leads to teens getting into trouble, failing grades, feeling inferior and depressed.   So in answer to your main question, I was not a happy teen, and most of the one's that were...were smoking weed or snorting...stuff.  I didn't want to go that route.  Anyway, I can't wait to read the other responses to your question.  Should be interesting don't you think?  Hope this helps.....|`|AA11033942	Like one of the other respondents on this page who doesn't identify their age or gender, many of the things they and others have said, are undoubtedly true. Most of the problems with teenagers is down to puberty and raging hormones and just as much (well nearly all) applies to the boys as well. <br>  <br>  Different people cope differently under pressure and teenage years is when the majority of your physical appearance and personality is forged. The ones that care the least about anything tend to be the most disruptive in schools. Most difficult thing to get into the kids of today is to avoid gang culture because that'll only lead to prison and death.<br>  <br>  I'm a mid-30s male and live in London and if there's any thing I could change from my teenage years I can only really think of one that if I'd have done then would be better off now: TAKE YOUR STUDIES SERIOUSLY. DO ALL YOUR EXAMS, because while I wasn't a reckless youth - positively angelic compared to some of  today's feral youth - especially the stuff that's been reported recently, its angst about growing up.<br>  <br>  The pace of life today is way more advanced than it was in the mid 1980s, too much going on with not enough time to do everything within the week and weekend of what you want, but this should create other life lessons, and while the current economic woes won't help the best thing is your age and options ahead of you (cliches are occasionally appropriate) take it easy, with the right help and advice it'll work itself out.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. ~Steve|`|tDiYhoy6aa	Oh my high school girl. Well I just happen to have been and now I am raising 3 right now. I do not see that it is really changed to much. Girls want to be women the same a s boys want to be men. They want to be in control of who they are yet want everyone around them to think they are great. They want to be popular. They want boys to look at them. They want to be the prettiest. They want to look tough as if no one tells them what to do. Yet the whole time they fill insecure about their bodies and their looks. There are Always exceptions, because some think they are all that all the time. Some want to stay little girls, some are in  a hurry to grow up and be women.  As far as what I remember the most is that I felt out of place and even when I felt great. I felt like the so may boys wanted to be my friend yet felt never good enough about myself. I always wanted to do what I wanted not what was right according to my parents. I want to talk on the phone and not mow the lawn. I wanted to stay at my friends after school and not go home.I wanted to wear shorter skirts because the other girls got to. No matter what I say you will never really get into the head of a teenage girl. If you do you are getting too close to her and she is having personal problems and should see a councilor at that point. Teenagers do not want their teachers to bond unless they are the new hot young teacher.If you are that teacher be careful. Just be kind and dont try to get to close. No teenager is too happy boy or girl. They are going from kids to being old enough to vote an d get lines of credit and live on their own. I was happy as a teen but figure out life and doing sports and school and home things. Those years go so fast.  |`|jwf5uUBsaa	well right now i am a teenager<br>  16.... almost 17<br>  i think all teens are kinda impulsive<br>  we all do things sometimes withouth thinking<br>  and we are motivated to do things if we see them interesting and appealing<br>  I am a pretty happy person but a lot of people my age go through hell<br>  they deal with parent divorce, dating, friendships, school, ....drama<br>  i know it doesnt seem like an impossible load but all thsoe things together can really tire and work us up.<br>  ohh....and we like to party<br>  lol<br>  but im surre you knew that|`|15fG5yX7aa	umm it sux the day i truned a teen i hated it but now it's a lil better i guess im goin bc 14 soo yah :p|`|gRFvOUGyaa	Its hard being a teen im still a teen and it sucks i wish i was 6 again being 13-14 was really hard|`|DAsz9ZQQaa	Its a well known fact that your tenn years are the worst and most complicated years of your life.<br>  If you think about it you go through puberty, have all your exams, start real relationships, realize and have to work out who your real Friends are. It not easy in the slightest and i suffered from depression right through my teen years. Also your parents are worried sick about whether you will take drugs, drink, sleep around so there down your neck all the time telling you off or accusing you of things. Its not until you are older that you realize they where looking out for you and making sure you didn't make mistakes that they did.|`|8xzoDTReaa	It's easy for me, Twelve & Thirteen are the worst.
50073dbd5ecac430d78adbf7aa450341aa	well, anyone can answer this question, but the real question should be "Am I in love" with this girl.<br>  If you are, then ask the question.  If you really are not, then all you are doing is seeking ego gratification, and that is so unfair to both of you.<br>  Take time to know yourself first, and how YOU feel about her.  I notice that you have not mentioned your feelings towards her.  Is that a clue?<br>  Good luck!|`|ConZqjMqaa	ok...<br>  this is a bit tough<br>  first of all. Think, do you love her? Second, does she flirt with me often? Try to think of these things before you ask her, do not jump to conclusions! Trust me, i've known from experience, it doesnt always work. In fact, not most of the time. Maybe you should try talking about love and realashonships with her and she how she reacts. Trust me, when she really loves you, you wont have to ask here!|`|7kJB91Fmaa	Not enough detail to answer that but everyone falls in love with time especially if there's a great connection and also physical attraction.bye.|`|WngxQDiaaa	Grow up before you have a girlfriend.|`|G0mtkuDvaa	why don't u figure out what it is she sees in you befor u ask that question|`|hez0vTm3aa	It's a maybe.

7xptLXlSaa	ok..the first answer was stupid.(don't listen to it, both you and god can get them back) It depends on your relationship with this person. If anger afloat every time you speak of said person, then you most likely dislike them. Second, only if you're sure can you even think about getting back. If you are 100% sure.. or If you feel necessary, sue. |`|EyYrYXFhaa	she'll get whats coming to her just ignore it and let god take care of it. you don't wanna do anything stupid.|`|AA10595355	i might have to go through that when my mom passes, with my brother, i am planning a lawsuit...check into it...it could get costly, but i would check with an attorney...|`|AA11033942	Seek legal advice! If necessary get an injunction in the county court to halt the execution of the current terms of her will. If your mum was mentally impaired when she changed her will then it could be rendered unlawful and its instructions could be null and void.<br>  <br>  Check to see if a codicil was written and sealed with a law firm... If someone had power of attorney while looking after her, it might be wise to speak to them first because if duress was applied by another member of your family then the executor wasn't doing their job properly to protect your mum's estate (money, property and other assets) that were in line to be shared out in the event of her death.<br>  <br>  Being robbed of an inheritance is not nice, even if it was only a token amount, the principle is still the same. Regarding the person or people who stole this from you, karma will get them back in a way they'd least expect it, but I hope you get this all sorted in a satisfactory way.<br>  <br>  ~S.|`|huMwCIqbaa	get the doctor to write a report that she had dementia and was unable to make such a decision at the time she made it.<br>  then get a lawyer....you will win.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	that is the reason for lawyers and courts...  <br>  <br>  see a lawyer and go to court.

Unless he has been betrayed by his sister or another friend into thinking badly of you and suddenly turning cold. If you're not interested in a relationship, then there's really nothing to worry about - it's not like you want to get involved but are being rebuffed.<br>  <br>  If you're in high school, then its probably another student who is all green-eyed-monster and jealous of your friendship with him. You're young enough to be able to make new friends very easily, but if you're in high school, should be old enough to tell who's not going to be a friend (for very long even) or even a bad influence on you and your other friends...<br>  <br>  You also mention this guy's sister. She may be the one that doesn't like you/has a low opinion/thinks other people are better for him or some other messed up thinking process, if it really bothers you then ask them both, if you get no (acceptable) reply then let it go. Its not worth the grief and worry.<br>  |`|DFIZEJFhaa	ask him he might like you

Good luck!|`|j3nKvmNyaa	um, she might like you and is just shy, if ur nervous, flirt with her on facebook (it'll be alot easier than doing it in person) and then she might get the idea, and then if she likes you she might give u more clues, if she does, then ask her out =)|`|TtQuM6NPaa	It sounds like she at least wants to be friends, otherwise she wouldn't even talk to you.

Calm down   you sound eccentric. she probably has a crush on you. that dosent mean you ask her out just yet. just start talking to her. find any reason. ask her a question about school and itll probably lead to more talking. I DO NOT ADVICE STARTING TALKING ON FACEBOOK! this will lead to very very awkward conversation in real life. samething goes for people who meet/start talking via texting.   you get the confidence when you asker her if she likes you and she says yes.|`|4Hy4iRgKaa	haha<br>  yeah just talk to her more on facebook and stuff.<br>  then after that u will start talking more in person<br>  . and then u will definitely know|`|HawShfPpaa	she might have a lil crush on you..but she probably wants to get to know you...talk to her on facebook and talk to her in school.<br>  <br>  <br>  be charming :]|`|Lv8s8R7taa	yeah if you really like her try to get closer to her, and yes talk to her on facebook.<br>  Good Luck:)|`|937wGrPIaa	Yea dude she likes you.. That's her hints.. If you like her back.. Talk to her.. flirt a little.. and next thing you know.. you will be with her |`|yCQy1WUSaa	if shes too pretty for u to ask her imagine her taking a big dumb an yeah she likes you|`|vi30NTjnaa	no she doesn't! she likes me!!!!|`|kx4SjPbPaa	This sounds just like what i went through. Me and my girl talked on facebook every single night because i was too shy to talk to her in person..but thats not good enough after awhile. You should start talking to her in person more..get to know her more. See if there is any way you two could hang out sometime. I think hanging with her sometime would definitely show you if she really likes you or not. The chemistry will be there if she does. To me, it sounds like she does kinda like you. After you talk more in person and everything..tell her you like her. See what she says back. Dont waste your time man..if you really want this girl, go get her. She will not come to you. Girls like it when the guy pursues them. Good luck with everything. Let me know what happens|`|jd9JLKdkaa	Depending on how the talk is going. If its to early and you just started talking to her dont ask her out yet. You guys have to get to no eachother first. One day take her out to the movies and see how everything goes.

Be very glad that right now, in this economy, your husband has a job to support you and the family.<br>  Suggestion, always try to be positive.  I am not really sure just what the problem is, other than you are missing him, and maybe a tad bit selfish in that you want him home for you, and he is busy bringing home the means for you not to work.<br>  I am sure there are women with deadbeat husbands who would love to switch places with you right now, or husbands who just lost their job after 10-20 years.|`|mVeI5Ixeaa	This is a problem?  You should consider yourself lucky your man has a stable job and doesnt make you work.  Try being away from your husband for 16 months straight.  That happened to me when my husband was in Iraq.  Appreciate what you have and be strong.  More people are much worse off then you.|`|vJP6yTy3aa	you started out wrong by pressuring anyone to marry you.  this won't end well.  why haven't you ever worked?  supported by mommy and daddy?  get a job after you have this kid.|`|nlFaI0Unaa	Definitely finish school! wow you dont even know how old you are. |`|qB6yTWvwaa	Well, the only thing you can do is "breath in, breathe out". Do not stress too much as you may be doing harm to you and your unborn child. There is nothing much that you can do because your husband is the only provider in the family. Since you are carrying his second child, have a child at home and are going to school...you might want to put school on hold until your second child is born. You're 27, I know you can handle it!|`|UUOwfA2haa	You need to focus on taking care of you and that unborn child right now and find some you time and relax. After the baby is born consider getting a part time job so hubby can spend more time at home. But in the mean time ask family or friends to help. After all that is what they are there for i would hope. Your emotions are running on high with the hormone change. RELAX FIND SOME YOU TIME.Even if it is just taking a bubble bath or going out for dinner with a girl friend .|`|HC2sGbqPaa	he needs to step up and be there for you Right Now !!!!   You both may have to give up a few things because the decrease in money but he really needs to tell his boss he needs to take a "personal leave of absence"  and maybe he has some paid vacation saved up so there wouldn't be the decrease in money.  I hope I was helpful and good luck and your in my prayers. |`|PFmPcKbwaa	I cannot handle long distance relationships. Its does not work for me.  I definitely need my wife by my side 24/7. I try working at long distance jobs before it really sucked for me big time. <br>  edit: My wife can handle long distance relationship but I cannot.  How wierd and strange guys.|`|6oOQbRWJaa	that sucks, can't he ask to be reassigned to a local project?|`|yusoItg9aa	Your problem started years ago.  Why did you pressure someone to marry you?  If you see it that way, no doubt he does too, and therefore doesn't feel like he needs to think about what you might need out of a relationship.  I'd finish school, get a job, and start to be independent.  You are going to need it when you discover that he has a girl in every port.  Sorry to be cruel, but this marriage problem sounds pretty bad.  Try to get him to talk to you about his vision of this marriage.  If he won't, start to find your own two feet.  Think about the example you are setting for your children - women need taking care of, no matter what the personal cost.  They will grow up always longing for daddy and a father figure.  If he won't be there for you or them(an it can be emotionally, not physically), you need to be there for yourself, and then find someone else that can be there for you too.
l9lrT7bfaa	He is worried about the business and thinks this will let her down gently so as not to cause a rift in the partnership.|`|50073dbd5ecac430d78adbf7aa450341aa	She is your sister, and there is no advice or suggestions you can give her that will change her mind.<br>  However, you can strongly enforce to  her that you are family, and that no matter what happens, you will be there for her.<br>  Be supportive, not suggestive, she needs the support more.|`|AA11257078	Nothing you can do. Just get your I told you so speech ready.|`|4ShUnZ3Uaa	sorry,but she has 2 get over him..
50073dbd5ecac430d78adbf7aa450341aa	Adult suggestion:<br>  why email when it will be so much more effective in person, face to face.<br>  Also, you can judge the reaction by facial expressions quickly.<br>  Use email only as a followup, never to send expressions of feelings, that is so impersonal and unfeeling.<br>  Good luck|`|OZPFwDWeaa	i think it is cute! i myself  am having difficulty trying to tell a guy i like him|`|UYdEQubkaa	at least u have the guts to tell her u like her i think she is just scared to write back becuz i do that.....this guy had e-mailed me and told me that he wants to go out with me i wuz just scared to answer....that might be the reason or she thinks u is just playin wit her....*joking wit her* <no what i mean?<br>  GOOD LUCK!@!
L2bQifUXaa	I agree.. kind of... He could be telling the truth and was embarrassed to tell you. Did he sound like he didn't want you to know when he finally told you he had no money? <br>  <br>  Anyway, if you haven't already made specific plans- such as what movie, what showing. what theater. how you are getting there... let him come to you. If he never asks, then he doesn't want to go.|`|ch66f4w1aa	He might be embarassed that he didn't have any money and couldn't take you out somewhere but it is also possible it was a convenient excuse.... ask him somewhere that won't cost anything, see what he says.|`|b8y4OWxfaa	i would say that maybe but if he didn't have any money he would have told you right from the get go. but if you like him let this one slide and see what happens next time and if you pay again then you know hes in it for the money. i know they say oh money is not important but what self respecting man would want to go out and have his date pay for him? |`|QpvpZ6Vqaa	THIS GUY DOESNT LIKE YOU sorry to be harsh but what kind of a guy is that, my guy would never let me pay for anything. that's not a person that's an animal be care full|`|uwrgMMfuaa	Ehh, have you screwed yet? If so, yes he is in it for the money. |`|JLJPTDHIaa	I think you answered your own Q.  |`|yyHybME0aa	he probably wanted to go all along, he just was protecting his man hood.  He couldn't come right out and say that he was broke.  That's a man law violation (Pride).  So its up to us women to be more aggressive and sometimes participate in covering the bill.  Don't get it twisted we women will not cover their broke anuses all the time only once in a blue moon.|`|I6YPgPNeaa	haha. that's funny. <br>  <br>  don't waste your money on him if he isn't even flirting with you or giving you signs. at least if he seemed interested, then fine, pay for him. but i think he wants a free movie hun. however, just for the sake of love. i say go with him. you never know what can happen. even if he doesnt like you now, that one night may make the difference between a new boyfriend or not if you grow on him|`|OZrdXQMyaa	It would seem a little weird if he called you and said ok lets go to the movies but you have to pay. |`|C8VuzOCjaa	Sounds a bit that way to me though i cant be sure sat behind a laptop|`|XuB8Jte8aa	kk|`|PTuSjgvNaa	well if it was me i would have called you...i also would of found a way to get money..|`|SEWGSUfvaa	well mabe he had to think about it but i think you should go out and see what happens|`|7DMzYIJvaa	yea that does sound kinda off. I mean, if he was really scrapped for cash, i think he would've obviously told you, or maybe not. Watch out on this one, he might just be a leech|`|qoS3gUukaa	Go on the date and enjoy yourself because the only way to tell if he is only going as you are paying is to see if it happens again. When you finish your date tell him to call you so you can go out again, if he doesn't call or only accepts another date with you when you offer to pay then it is pretty clear that the money is the major factor in his decision to date you. Hopefully he is just short on cash and after your date he will call you and take you out to make up for it! If he is in it for the money then just forget about him and move on, leopards do not change their spots so you don't need someone like him in your life anyway. Xx|`|YOmPHa10aa	Girl do not pay for that boy. I understand that you like him, but don't pay. Yes he is only going because you are paying. If he would have return your phone call that would have let you know that he was interested. He probably wanted to go but didn't have the money. Now that you have offered to pay of course he's gonna go, because I know I would. I don't think you should do it, because for now on he's gonna expect you to pay fo his way everywhere.|`|05vNunQxaa	He could just have a diminished pride about accepting the money.  Maybe he really wants to go with you it just hurts his pride to ask for money.  Would really have to know how it is when you do hang out with him.  If he is really into you I'd just say he is like most guys and can't ask for money from others.  I've had to suck it up and ask someone before, hurts your manhood.|`|aSqYoBNQaa	Hello there "girl".<br>  <br>  If you had to call the guy, then you don't need this one.  Let him go.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you're you're a beautiful girl. Guys should be calling you for the date(s).  Don't sell yourself short.<br>  <br>  Never, never, never, never offer to pay .. if you are the 'girl'.  <br>  If you do, it will seem as though you are either 1) disparate, or 2) looking for something other than a nice date.<br>  <br>  Hold out for somebody who's worthy of your affections.<br>  <br>  As for this guy.... if he really wanted to take you out, he would beg every guy he knows for the money, or ask his relatives, and the best option would be... he'd get a job (even if its mowing grass or cleaning out grandma's attic).<br>  <br>  Keep your self respect, and your money.<br>  Wait for a guy how will do anything to have a date with you.<br>  You DESERVE a good guy.|`|dILR9yp1aa	This guy's in it for the money. If he was interested he would've called you back- he's more interested in the free movie than you, babe. But don't worry! Find someone that ACTUALLY appreciates you :)|`|2bb016b1e780abaa80d9a9bd66d8e804aa	He might be too embarassed to admit that he has no money.  On the other hand, if your friend offered you a free movie date, you'd probably take it.<br>  <br>  Hard to tell.  Treat him to the movie and see how he acts towards you. |`|AA10950107	I think he really just didn't want to go with you, and maybe when you offered to pay he felt sorry for you.  Or he's just a dick.  You should be able to find a better guy than that.|`|wmliut9Daa	Maybe he didn't call because he didn't want to admit he couldn't afford it right now.|`|ocU6G2n3aa	maybe he really likes you and is embarrassed that he is broke and he is excited that you asked him out.|`|CkSiX4Yuaa	if he wanted to go to the movies with you love he would of give you a call the guys are meant to pay not the girl so forget about him find sum one better |`|370P0rwHaa	depends how much shame he's got that he's taking your money. jokingly tell him he's paying next time see what he says.<br>  |`|rVZ9ycVsaa	Don't go with him, he's only because you're paying. Find another guy.|`|AoIhEUJhaa	your right.... he's a freeloader lol.<br>  Just go with him if you like him and he'll pay you back.|`|U37OhGgaaa	if u want to pay this time ok as u asked him.............but dont let him think u are an ATM|`|ohwzWPsqaa	yea, he is not into you.|`|OYkZeL3Uaa	he is enjoying the free ride ... he has to be honest.<br>  on the other hand.. he might of just been uncomfortable asking you to cover for him ....|`|Xzsn7V6xaa	hmm. I would be thinking that way, also. Ask him...when you go out, right before you're about to go home, just see if he really likes you. Surely you'll know after the date...good luck....ohh, and use a rubber! ;)|`|fexLdGyFaa	Well yes he's going cause your paying because he doesn't have any money to pay for himself.|`|9Duc4Fawaa	=O 
V21e5lFtaa	If you are having a good time with her and don't expect too much, you are doing fine.  You can set whatever limits you feel comfortable with.<br>  -Blake|`|oojO4WAraa	You need to talk to her about how you feel.  She likes you or she wouldn't continue going out with you.  Tell her what kind of a relationship you are interested in and ask where she stands on that.|`|PIPDBQSraa	yeh i guess so, but it does sound to me that youre a bit of a rebound. just keep doing what your doing and either shell snap out of it and want to really be with you or shell move on. good luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  help me?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqGugQnMCO7J7LjGZPJGcuDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081109151125AAywNCp">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|HaoJgyv0aa	Your definitely her rebound. I know because i've done this, not intentionally, but by dating too soon when i KNOW i'm not over my ex. |`|50073dbd5ecac430d78adbf7aa450341aa	i would say you are handling it the right way.  If she was interested in you alone, she would not be talking about her ex all the time.<br>  I think you should sit her down and explain all this to her, rather than call or email or god forbid, text your feelings to her.<br>  Let her know, and if she really is interested in you, it might shake her enough to realize she is close to losing you as well.<br>  Who knows, but good luck anyway.|`|GPeYqjbBaa	Yes.She seems to still want the person she had for four years,yet still wants someone to be with,be it you or any other person.If her room ates had have been there,she would not have rung you for company.If she really liked you,she would have rung you and left her roommates.<br>  You are her shoulder to cry on.Find someone new|`|VMbaRPQZaa	I think that you are handling it ok. Just be with her for now. 4 years is a tough thing to get over. <br>  <br>  Tell her how you feel and that for now you'd like to be friends, because of what you had to endure in the past. Tell her you want something real for a change. Let her know you wanna take this slow, because you don't want to be hurt.|`|DpAeGOdMaa	Sounds like you are handling it pretty good. I would probably be a little more aggressive so that she has to make her mind up sooner rather than later or just risk being permanently in the 'friend' zone. Also, I assume you are not paying for the 'dates' since they are not 'romantic.'|`|ldY8DvsWaa	Yes you are. Keep it like that until you are a hundred percent positive that she's looking at you with her full utmost attention. |`|hiNFrvISaa	I say ur doing this right.Sounds like she not over her last guy.Give it more time and see if she is taking more of a liking to u.|`|uD5wZgsEaa	your doing the right thing and it sounds to me like she just needs a good friend at the moment|`|2t3vS3sraa	I think you probably have  a good grasp of the situation however don't try to hard to distance yourself in order to 'test' her intentions as she may just read this as 'your not interested' and cut her losses in order to save herself the pain, then you have both lost out on something that could have been great. I think you are right to be cautious however I would just be upfront and tell her what your fear to prevent her misreading the situation. Whenever we embark on a new relationship it is a gamble, whether one of you has just come out of a relationship or not. I would just mention your fears to her and then put them aside and  go with what 'feels' right. Good luck.|`|ZpmLzxpyaa	couple of ways to find out man!! <br>  First.. you could just grab your ballz, go up to her, sit her down and tell her how you feel. (I have the same freakin problem but this usually works for me) If your ballz are small or your not a sensitive talker....<br>  <br>  2. Kind of show her that she's not the ****, try getting her off her high horse by chilling with other girls. Just a couple hugs and cheek kisses. She''l come around eventually. Trust ME<br>  <br>  <br>  I mean, U have the freakin upper hand. YOUR 21 AND SHE'S 18 COME ONNNNN. TELL me u cant make the best of that!!!!|`|lb7hAsGHaa	Yes, no body wants to be 2nd best.  You have to think of yourself and your heart, ya know.   I would not be with someone who wants to be talking or thinking of someone else.  You have your life to think about.  She is absolutely not being fair to you.  If I was her I would ashamed of myself.  You sound like a real nice guy.  Don't let anyone walk on you or use you.  She needs to find herself and not involve innocent, good hearted people to use.  Just stay away from her.  Good Luck to you and God Bless You. I am 55 if that makes any difference.|`|o0DIm09eaa	Yes you are! Good for you. Don't let her manipulate you into doing or being something you are not. All she is doing is a form of control. Leave her alone, drop her number, and forget she exists. She's a user.|`|XkZgPDMlaa	I think you're handling this right. Just continue to be cautious and doing what you're doing. If she's talking about her ex-bf of 4 years, its very possible that are right about feeling like you could be another rebound. You sound like a nice guy; most guys would take advantage of this girl because she is in a vulnerable state. Don't put all your eggs in one basket with this girl or you may end up getting hurt.|`|mHczjX83aa	Yes. Tell her just what you told 'us' - that you have a good time when you are with her, and would like to see her again, but if you are just someone she is going to call when she has nothing better to do, then maybe you two would be better not dating. <br>  <br>  you don't want to be a "friend with benefits" either<br>  <br>  Everyone deserves to be someone special to the one we are dating, not just good enough for now.|`|sMePYxHbaa	Your instincts are right, be a friend but from a distance for a while until she can determine what she is looking for. Getting more deeply involved at this point will only confuse things.<br>  And by the way, there is nothing wrong with wanting something real, I know society tells guys that all we want is quick sex and nothing else, but the reality is we do want a woman we can have more than sex with, we also want relationships, love, companionship, friendship. As men we are born with the desire to rescue the damsel in distress, just make sure she is a damsel worth rescuing.<br>  
2bb016b1e780abaa80d9a9bd66d8e804aa	You are confusing rights with responsibilities. <br>  <br>  Basically, no - you can't absolve him of his responsibilities unilaterally.  If he's paying child support and he has done nothing abusive, you cannot legally restrict his rights. But that doesn't stop custodial parents from screwing over the other parent.<br>  <br>  Now, you may suggest that he VOLUNTARILY give up those rights, but if he does, you get no support.|`|CPxmHjx4aa	whats best for your son is to never deny the father the right to b a part of his life..<br>  okay he hasnt come or called as often as he should b doing but dont stop the father son relationship when he does come or call..<br>  he will always b that boys father...he will pay for not being more involved in his sons life the older his son gets...<br>  just keep visitation available and dont deny communication between the two of them..|`|6M2ikJfkaa	If you really want the parental responsibilities taken away you can go back to court. However, you can still give him another chance if he's not doing anything dangerous to you or your son. Just make sure your son knows that his dad won't always be there. Don't set your son's expectations high for his dad. |`|XSnj1JWsaa	It depends on where you are from. In California my ex was dumping my daughter off with me on his parenting days and the judge said that my ex was being so nice to let me have extra time with my daughter! I thought that was ridiculous. Basically, in most places, you have to prove your ex to be unfit...using drugs, violent, criminal, cannot support child. You can also try going to a mediator in order to change the visitation schedule.|`|AP9eM41zaa	If you went thru the court system the chances of him being removed of the parental responsibilities are slim to none... First of all he would need to agree with you and i doubt that would happen.. I believe you could go back to court and modify his visitation but you might need to consult an attorney.. I would suggest contact an attorney anyways since alot of times they offer free consultations|`|j5gsNS3Taa	You can go to court and explain that you would only like to allow visits from your ex to you child under your circumstances.Let the court know what the situation is.But as he doesn't physically harm your child in any way I am not sure what the outcome would be.'
gfHutvEFaa	While you're in a different room, have a friend open the door to retrieve your stuff.<br>  <br>  It is gonna hurt like hell for awhile but you will NOT feel like this forever! I promise! <br>  <br>  Good luck :)<br>  <br>  |`|OTFzJbaMaa	just ignore him. if he broke up its for the best or bad things will happen. just tell yourself youll find someone better. say anything else!!|`|BaHAJdDpaa	I'm sorry that you are hurting right now, I know how painful it is. I would definitely arrange for him to just drop it off when you are not home. You don't need to see him right now.<br>  <br>  I don't think you have to give up all hope of getting back together however. I have some advice if you want to try to get him back.<br>  <br>  First, tell him it's ok that you're not together right now and you understand his reasons. Preferably in a letter that you mail and don't get all emotional. Tell him you want some time and space to yourself and you don't want to see or talk to him for at least a month.<br>  <br>  Then hold to it. Take the month to calm down and let your emotions settle so you can think things through. Most likely he will start to miss you and wonder why you haven;t contacted him. It puts you in a position of power.<br>  <br>  Try to arrange a casual meeting in a month or so and talk about something new or fun you've been doing. Keep it casual, brief and non emotional. Don't be clingy. People want they cannot have, especially if it appears just out of their reach - so play it cool. Don't ask to see him again , let him ask you. Then go slowly.<br>  <br>  Remember he was attracted to you in the first place!<br>  Good luck|`|7my80dJfaa	If the object he is bringing back to you is basically worth 20 dollars or less just forget it.<br>  You might be trying to see him because you miss him but it is over, at least to him.<br>  You should protect yourself, seal your heart up and go on with your life. If he broke up with you once, he will likely do it again even if you were able to get together with him again.<br>  It is time to move on and I will be praying for you.<br>  Paul|`|4zhdqe5kaa	First, hitting him with a bat is illegal and he's not worth it.<br>  Second, maybe have him drop it off at a friend's house if you don't think you're ready to see him or speak to him. |`|AA10735964	tell him to just leave the stuff in ur back yard.. that way u dont have to see him...

2bb016b1e780abaa80d9a9bd66d8e804aa	This is not downgrading, this is the truth, based on your question above.  <br>  <br>  Your guy is a winner.  Not.  But neither are you.  The IM may be more correct than you want it to be.  If you run out of TP in the house, that's an indication of poor household management (slob?).  Your missive reads like my wife's friend on the phone speech - and she's a drama queen. <br>  <br>  You can change these things - take better care of yourself, improve your writing skills, and stop drinking vodka when you're upset.  Oh, and toss the bum out or go visit your mom for about six months.|`|dGyX3E8Faa	Wow that was difficult to read.<br>  <br>  Anyways, there are many problems in this picture.

He took your phone so you could call him, did you call him? It doesn't say.  So are you afraid you were going to follow him, why'd he take your keys.<br>  <br>  I don't know about all this, but what I do know if that the aggressive behavior you displayed can and will put you in jail someday. Especially when you start pushing innocent bystanders who become witnesses to your drunken episodes.  In my opinion, he should run as far away from you as possible, so if he WANTS to come back and give it another try you greet him with open arms an apologize.<br>  |`|AA11943537	It sounds like there is a lot wrong with both of you.  Instead of being courteous he IM's you that he not's coming home.  He also dumps you over IM.  You drink when you are upset.  You get so drunk that you get violent.  <br>  <br>  I think you both need help.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AcrtbRYmaa	You both seem pretty rude and obnoxious to each other, but you should definitely forget about him and move on.  He is an a**hole.|`|I6i38TqOaa	I can tell you really already know this guy is a total jerk that thinks he has you wrapped around his little finger. Don't let him get to you, I'm sure that you are much stronger than that! You are worth more than that kind of life he is sucking you into. You know you deserve a better guy so If it were me i would just forget this relationship altogether and let him get his own car and fix his own pathetic life. It's not your responsibility. You aren't his mommy. |`|axJ9O0Ckaa	I don't buy the "staying at mom's house" thing, okay?  He's messin around in some way or another.  Boot him out....and get your car back!!!  He shouldn't have had it for that long anyway.|`|fU08smgxaa	i can see you must be hurting right now, because this guy is obviously playing with your feelings, <br>  here is my advice:<br>  1.)  forget about him, quick!<br>  i guess most people who know about your situation are telling you this,<br>  you are wasting your precious time with that loser,  <br>  2.) stay away from alcohol, it's self destruction, you harm yourself physically and can't make the right choices under the influence<br>  3.) yes, he is cheating, think about it next time he is trying to get back with you, you might catch something you don't want, don't risk it, he is not worth it<br>  4.) get your life together, apologize to the manager, show maturity, even if you don't feel like it <br>  5.) you are still young, i hope you won't get in a relationship like this again, but there is no guaranty, so take some time for yourself, find out what is important to you, set some goals you want to achieve,<br>  that will keep your mind busy for a while and get you in the right direction    |`|jwTHNANHaa	WELL if your boyfriend is being an A$$ and u really love him, get back together with him and talk it out.
50073dbd5ecac430d78adbf7aa450341aa	ooops, think i am swimming upstream on this one, against the crowd, so let me just say that some would consider it cheating, but it is probably like one of those victimless crimes.  As in, "no harm, no foul".<br>  I am sure this will generate screams throughout Yahoo, but you did ask.<br>  I text and email alot, and yes, I have been involved in a cyber relationship and not met anyone yet in person, nor do i care to.<br>  Let your comfort be  your guide.  I really think that sometimes it is no ones business but my own, and this probably is one of those moments.  If you understand that he is not going to leave his family, and you are ok with that, fine.  If that changes, and you really, really cannot accept that, then you should leave the relationship as quickly as you can.<br>  Not sure if this makes sense, hope so, and good luck.|`|a2646c11cee413f85dabf33002b34080aa	Please stop! You don't want to get involved with a man who is married...his judgement and character is obviously altered if he speaking with another woman with text or msn chat. Let him work on his marriage, you dont want to be the one to break up a family. |`|ezT7xruoaa	I'm sorry but I think you should stop talking to him. Yes its cheating and also: it takes 2 to tango. So basically your helping him cheating. Imagine his wife finds out and comes to your house!!|`|o2tPN5Geaa	I think your treading on dangerous grounds.|`|GTxfTe8raa	dude that is ****** up right there<br>  naww its not cheating|`|8c93b08d0ef73b87abf803c1344c16e1aa	It's a classic rule of thumb: If you have to ask, it's cheating. Here's the deal: he is clearly cheating, because he's married. He is cheating on her, so he will surely cheat on you. He's a "gentleman"? No, he's a cheater/liar who apparently knows the words to warm your loins. He is wasting your time, and he is obviously not giving his wife her due. He's sniffing around where he shouldn't be - don't help him.  |`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	"Never disrespectful about his wife".... except of course for those times when he's flirting with some random girl he doesn't even know, riiight very respectful indeed.  You should follow your rule of not getting involved with married men.  Of course he won't leave his wife, you are just a play thing for him. Just wait, in a few weeks he will be asking for naked pictures of you..the only connection he feels for you is in his pants.  I think you must be desperate for male attention.  And yes, on his part it is cheating.  A gentleman doesn't cheat on his wife.  If you want a man find your own!  |`|l1wCobnxaa	Having been the "wife" in a similar situation, I feel you should be staight with him.  Ask him what he feels he is doing.  does his wife know of this friendship?  How would she feel if she did?  It is very hurtful to know your husband would rather talk to another women and not deal with any issues he may have at home.  You cannot make him do anything he is not ready to do.  Take a break and reflect on how damaging it could be for him and his family.  If you really care, you will find the right answer yourself.  |`|vdfEE7WTaa	Emotional affair = His sin, not yours<br>  But as long as you don't do or say something fully sexual, keep it to lightly flirty, it's alright. His wife would still hate you, but I don't think mutual friends would judge you too harshly.|`|giDaG7TYaa	If he goes behind his wifes back to talk to you he will do the same to you if you ever get in her position..find a better man, and I'm sure he's trying to make you fall for him by all his lies. Don't be delusional.|`|xT6YkmkIaa	I think that you never really know a person that you met via an electronic device and coming across as someone else via an electronic device is really very easy.<br>  <br>  |`|B1LjVT6gaa	just be careful and think about the consequences it could cause a lot of trouble.... you are a big girl and i'm sure you will make the right choice....|`|Y5c4uZ4Maa	I was going to say a few things but after reading Katti's answer on here I believe she says it all! Good job Katti!<br>  And YES it is a form of cheating...IF his wife does not know you two are talking? |`|jaG0DLDnaa	yeah it is cheating and you should stop in the long run or someone will get hurt either emotionally or even physically|`|B15W0Ylnaa	His wife would probably be concerned whether or not she thinks it's cheating!  If you push this guy, he may wreck his marriage for you.  Do you want to be in that position?  You need to find someone else (not easy I know)!  If you can keep it at the friends only level (sounds like maybe you can't) it may be okay, but be careful.  In a way this is unfair to you to keep this going.|`|LJJa0IsPaa	I think u need to put a limit to all this txting and chatting. It is a way of cheating you know. Put urself in his wife's shoes! You wouldn't like it would ya?<br>  Besides, there are many single gentlemen out there... u can txt then, chat with them and hey, u can even meet them and have an actual relationship with them, and without wreckin anyone's home...|`|PVRcV5Lzaa	Well, to be honest. I don't think it's going to happen.<br>  And if it does, it's just harsh on his wife.<br>  And it will sho you what kind of man he truly is if he does<br>  cheat.<br>  <br>  At the moment, I think it's fine. Neither of you are doing anything<br>  wrong. To be honest I think it's quite healthy, everyone needs<br>  a little harmless flirting- as long as that's all it is.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you try and think of him in a brotherly way, he sounds<br>  like a good guy, try and keep it that way.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped, even if it was just a little.<br>  <br>  :)|`|QnStWW1Paa	How can he feel right when you have never even met him in person. All the flirting has just cause you to be infatuated by him. It should have stopped immediately when you found out he was married!  Put yourself in his wife's shoes.  How would you feel about the situation if your were the wife?  I think you know the answer.|`|URbMCRFLaa	Think about his wife and his family. My bf accidently called the wrong number once and ended up talking to her for months behind my back "as friends" but flirty. It's exactly what you said "boredom". But you're doing it to feel good whether you say so or not cause it makes you feel good talking to him. Whether it's fate or not, it's not fate when it means breaking up a family. Karma does come around and let me tell you from experience, the girl that was talking to my bf was being used just like you. She wasn't the reason we split, he was for lying and trying to do that but now there's a 1 year old little boy with a broken family and that girl took the heat for the breakup from my bf because even though he initiated and kept things going as well as she did, he blamed her for ruining what he had in his family and he has made her life hell for the short time he even spoke to her after we split. And it was only to make her life hell because he didn't want anything to do with her as a person when he was single and could have.|`|VF4Bd8QEaa	to me where he hasn't mentioned meeting you or leaving his wife then to me he just seems bored and he enjoys the new conversation thats between you and him. I'm sorry if you have fallen for him but to me I really dont see it going no further than txting. <br>  there is alot of circumstances that venture to fate but maybe you should look at it as an experience, think at what you have learned out of meeting this man, maybe its knowledge or confidence or just a new close friend you've made. And then look at what he's learned from you! Do you guys work in different locations or have different opinions on society and so on. <br>  Life itself is an experience and a learning game and all of us are the players in this game and we gather what we can to better ourselves and mature our knowledge in areas that are needed. <br>  your probably wonder what you have learned from this but it will come to you in some way or manner. <br>  <br>  And then look at it from the other perspective he hasn't sad he's unhappy has he? and put yourself in his wifes shoes you wouldn't want someone to split you guys apart? And then think of this if he did leave his wife for you there is that possibilty that he will do the same to you down the road.<br>  Good luck and be careful|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	You said he is never disrepectful about his wife.... umm, I think so if he talks to you and is doing this.  Some men, which might be him say what you want them to say.  As you said, he might be bored, etc. but to continue this is trouble.  What if his wife saw his messages and took his phone, etc.  There is no future there and to hold onto this is silly.  Do you even know what he looks like or is all about other than texting and messaging?  He could be someone that you thought was but isnt.  |`|eZqgHaXxaa	WOW! GIRL IT SOUNDS HARD AND I BET ITS WELL IF HIS MARRIED JUST FORGET HIM BUT ALSO YOU DO NT KNOW IF HE S TELLING YOU THE TRUE .HAVE YOU AT LEAST TALKED TO HIM NT TXTING BUT WELL ON THE PHONE YOU KNOW JUST TALK TO HIM AND TELL HIM HOW YOU FEEL AND THAN SEE WHAT HAPPEN GET TO KNOW HIM AND SEE IF WHAT HE TOLD YOU IS TRUE THAN JUST WELL IF THINGS ARE GOING WRONG W HIS WIFE THAN HE WOULD LEAVE HER FOR YOU|`|pabVvxylaa	You have to ask your self. Would you like it if you were in the wife's position? Your husband texting some strange women? It may feel right and great but the fact is he is married and it ISN'T right or great. Since you have started having feelings for this man and he is married I think you have to cut it off. (just what you wanted to hear right?) <br>  Do the right thing here. You could not only get hurt yourself but you could breakup a 12 year marriage and hurt others in the process|`|uvo24D2gaa	do you know how people lie or fake when they are texting?<br>    like my friend always texts her bf i love you but never accually said it to his face.<br>    he married 12 years and he probably bored and just wants sex imagine if that was your husband going off with another woman and would you be able to trust this gentleman after he cheated with his wife if he did go off with you? <br>    or he could just be playing with you because hes that bored bottom line look for a different man, you are wasting your time|`|XiDBZ5R6aa	I would have been very hurt if I was in his wife's place. I always starts off like this. And like you're saying he's really getting under your skin. Please avoid. Else you'll be heading for more heartache on your side.<br>  And yes it's cheating, as being unfaithful is not only physical, it's also in the mind. Which one is worse?|`|zk1rBmFlaa	Hmm, maybe it's true love :)<br>  Me and my ex got together when he sent a text saying 'x' and that's how me and him got speaking :)<br>  Just be careful, he may seem all sweet and innocent on the phone, everyone can act over a few texts and online chat. Everyone says i'm completely different online and on the phone than i am in person.<br>  You falling for this man could either turn out good or bad and even worse for him if he got caught by his wife. His wife would defiantly count it as cheating, just like you would if you had a husband who was texting and speaking to another girl everyday; you have to see it from her point of view.<br>  I wouldn't lose contact with him but just check with him that he's sure he wants you two to carrying on speaking incase his wife does find out as it will be fine for you, you can just move on and find someone who actually can be with you but as for him, it could ruin his life forever.<br>  I went and met the lad that text me, i didn't even think, i just went straight ahead and done it and he was completely different to how he come across on texts and online but i did fall in love with him and i still love him now :)<br>  Good luck and i hope you make the right choice. Keep smiling.<br>  |`|Xgm680dCaa	your not cheating he is on his wife emotionally hes looking to you to fill something is wife cant if he can do this while hes married he would go even further stay away from married men who knows what their wives are like|`|16vMIGPiaa	Let your conscience by your guide.<br>  A single young woman should not be emotionally involved with a married man.<br>  <br>  I think you have no idea who is sending you text messages.  It could be a convicted rapist in prison somewhere.  It could be a teenage guy who's just messing with your head.<br>  <br>  Chemistry is a very dangerous thing.  That you are responding emotionally in this way to someone you've not met sounds dicey.  I really think you'd be smart to stop...|`|r3uKj1Azaa	Essentially this is a Rebecca Loos <-> David Beckham situation.<br>  <br>  You will never actually get together, but you do have the potential of ruining his marriage. Do you think David would have dropped Victoria for Rebecca Loos? Never. But David sure could have lost Victoria over it!<br>  <br>  Don't ruin his life, break it off now.|`|IGhUA1Vdaa	I should know that texting and msn are cheating. These things are hurtful to the woman being cheated on and always lead to a meeting and then sneaking around.<br>  <br>  Dont continue this, it's dumb.|`|WWNWtzvDaa	send me your blokes number and i will txt him randomly just talking and stuff ..and see how you feel =/ |`|5HvdcWvBaa	Hey, if i were you i would be very wary; this dude could be anyone, you have absolutley no proof that he is who he says he is, right?<br>  Plus it is a very random way of meeting someone and i would suggest (no offence meant whatsoever btw!) that he might be a bit desperate to start talking to some gal he just texted by accident. <br>  On the other hand if he really is who he says he is then yes i think it might be cheating. Not in the same way as if you guys were actually sleeping together but he has a wife...so yeah...be careful please though because i wouldnt trust that guy if i were in your shoes.
QC94lBXOaa	Yep. You've got a lot of opportunities ahead of you. there's nothing wrong with still caring about him but he's already "set" in his life, you're just starting yours. You' ll probably always care about him, and there's nothing wrong with that. You're just at different points in your life. |`|HQ1t2ayLaa	You did the right thing, the relationship wasn't working out.

For whatever reasons, and no blame on either of us, so, yes, you did the right think.  <br>  He was lucky he had you, and you were lucky you had him, so it will probably take awhile, even after all this time, i still wonder about her, and so will you.

I know it is hard but if you don't then you will never heal. I can almost guarantee you that he will cling to you as soon as you look like you are happy without him, but you have to resist him. Sad to say, the reason why he probably doesn't want you is because you are too available to him. It is human nature to want what you can't have, and he can have you whenever he wants. The best revenge that you can get is to be happy without him and let him have that ***** that doesn't even want him|`|CHzA0aeRaa	ignore him, if his life goes **** up as frequently as you say then it shouldn't be too long before he comes crawling back asking for forgiveness. under normal circumstances i wouldn't condole this sort of thing but he does sound pretty deserving|`|VJRUaOW5aa	well it's funi cuz me n my bf just been for like 2getther for just like a month n sum weeks it will be 2 months in dec 4...and he does that to all his friends dat are girls. we broke up n got back 2gether, and he did dat exact thing 2 his friend. now i know how she mite feel. soriz. but yeah he said he was wit sum gurl wen we broke up n dat they had i thing.lol. but i 4gave him n we good 4 now.....but yeah u should just get over him and find someone better cuz sounds like u desirve alot better u know.ummm and i agree with the other person..u shud get ur next bf to beat him up.lol. and then ignore him like he does to you even though things go bad for him cuz dats wat he gets for doing that to u. and just basically 4get about him. he'll aventuali see wat a great person he lost. and if he ever wants u back, make him bage 4 u.it's pretty funi wen guys do dat.lol

Since the damage is done, you might as well keep sleeping with the hoebag (your wife's sister), but you need to realize that this is going to explode and there is nothing you can do to fix this.

What's the purpose of marriage versus the reason why two people would just move in with each other?<br>  <br>  Is there a difference between cheating on a wife, versus doing it with one of her family members?  Do you think it would be worse?  Do you think it would do more than hurt a marriage, but a wife's whole family?

If you do have kids then you could tell her that we have to stop for the sake of my kids, and she will be ok with that if she likes them, and she wont break the news to anyone because she doesn't want to destroy the family, and it will just be your little secret. If you dont have kids then im not sure how to stop her from telling people if you break it off with her, but it will most likely hit the fan and you will lose both her and your wife or maybe just your wife and not her.

It sounds as though he was never fully committed to you. Remember that you deserve to be in a relationship with someone who's totally in love with you, who wants to spend their time with you, someone who loves you for who you are.

qEhUuKheaa	i do not think that those preferences have to do anything with the sex you have.<br>  in a woman's eyes, most machos are perceived as weak men and why should their sex be rough then. on the other hand, there are lots of shy and charming silent girls who are with a sweet guy and nonetheless love rough sex. the possibilities are innumerable. but what makes you think that a sweet guy is gentle in bed?? he may have a dark side he does not show in public...|`|d30771cf8d795e2010bdd153abce4590aa	i don't think so. at times every girl needs to be treated gently and like a queen.  but there are other times when a girl just needs to have a lot of fun really quickly.  it depends on her mood and the setting.

Pon manos a la obra hoy mismo, vete a la delegación mas cercana y pregunta en qué jusgado te pueden asesorar profesionales, y de qué manera te pueden ayudar para salvaguardar tu integridad y asistir a tu madre, tu madre cree que lo que le pasa está bien, será incapáz de admitir que ese hombre es un delincuente, siempre te dirá que en el fondo es buena persona,(es el perfil de estas personas maltratadas) de ella no puedes esperar amparo, debes actuar tu, pero hazlo con cautela, a tu padrastro le desagradará que le pongas el punto en la i, y talvéz quiera "darte una lección "para que nunca mas te atrevas a denunciarlo, en el fondo y de todos lados desde donde lo mires es una persona que sabe lo quie hace, lo hace porque no cuenta con que alguien se defienda, este tipo de machos son malos pero no mastican fierro, cuando vea que hay un sistema social que le va a quitar su pasa tiempo de ser sádico y abusador, tendrá que responder a la justicia en vez de hacerle una nueva promesa a tu madre de que no volverá a suceder, como seguramente lo hace para que le de una nueva oportunidad, como te decía, se cauteloso, hazlo sin informarle a tu madre porque ella te delatará con él, estas mujeres son fieles y leales al que abusa de ellas, y todavía mas, puede desencadenarse una situación crítica en donde la pérdida del control resulte en tragedia, por eso sé discreto, y muy cauteloso haz lo que tienes que hacer sin agitar las aguas, y piensa que si no lo haces la gravedad de la situación irá en aumento, ese momento crítico siempre llaga si no se toman medidas y las cosas terminan mal. Estos tipos son sádicos, y obsesivos, le hará creer al siquiatra y a la Santa Virgen y al mismo Jesucristo que no volverá a hacerlo, pero la verdad es que no tienen cura, y cuando se ven descubiertos, se vuelven mas agresivos con sus víctimas y más santurrones frente a los profesionales, pro un tiempo muchos de ellos logran enga?ar a todos, pero solo los que están dentro de la casa saben la clase de cínico que son. Actúa hoy mismo, dale continuidad a tu gestión, no esperes protección policial porque la policía actúa solo si estos locos han matado a alguien, vete a un jzgado (de menores de familia o el que corresponda) esto que dices es gravísimo y debe ser tratado con urgencia, hay también asociaciones y fundaciones que prestan servicios de tratamiento y reabilitación, busca todo eso y que Dios te acompa?e. Pero siempre mantén claro que estás en lo cierto, nadie tiene derecho a pasar po lo que tu y tu madre pasan, hay leyes para eso, úsalas, que nadie te diga lo contrario, mantenme al tanto de los acontesimientos, buscaré algunas direcciones de estas asociaciones para que te pongas en contacto y te orienten pasao a paso lo que es mas conveneinte que se hace en estos casos. Te deseo todo el éxito del mundo, la vida es maravillosa, y todo lo que nos hace sufrir se puede revertir es cuestión de una desición, yo he pasado por el infierno y sé que esos infiernos son reversibles, el ser humano tiene un poder ilimitado, y Dios auyda a los bienintensionados, adelante!todo tiene solución, todo se resuelve, busca ayuda, y ten la certeza de que todo se resolverá porque hay leyes y personas que te ayudarán, y personas que te alentarán, hazlo hoy!<br>  Te mando un cari?o grande, <br>  María de la Trinidad Vi?ole Donadío.|`|74XXYBOwaa	Yo se que es muy difícil tu caso, pero te aconsejaría que trates de vivir tu vida y que aproveches cada minuto de ella, porque realmente ese muy corto el tiempo que vivimos, no lo desperdicies busca tu felicidad y si lo haces atravesé de aseriarte a Dios mas fácil te sera, mucho éxito y sal de eses circulo en el que te encuentra, saludos|`|FVDbztUdaa	eres humano y tienes derecho a sentir pero no por ello debes de reaccionar así ya que te estas portando de la misma manera que el esposo de tu madre ya bastante sufrimiento tiene acuerdate que hoy en dia hay organizaciones que pueden apoyar a tu madre es lo que la debes de hacer entender ya que la mayoria de las mujeres pensamos que sin un hombre no podemos hacer nada y eso es una mentira en la vida hay bellas cosas pero tu no eches a perder tu vida ya que tienes el poder de cambiarla y hacer algo grande solo esta que te decidas hasta lo puedes denunciar al tipejo|`|QtINUZxKaa	Creo que el ir mal en la escuela no es la mejor forma de hacer reaccionar a tu mamá, al contrario, de por sí ella ya tiene problemas muy graves con su actual esposo y lo que necesita e stu apoyo (eso no quiere decir que aceptes que la traten mal) y por otro lado, la educacion es algo que te va a servir unicamente a ti, no e sun favor que le estes haciendo a los demás. Actualmente es muy difícil encontrar trabajo y lo mejor que puedes hacer es estudiar y aprovechar todo para ser una persona capaz en un futuro. En cuanto al problema de la pareja de tu mamá, creo que lo mejor es que lo denuncies, tanto tú como tu mamá tienen derechos. <br>  En conclusión, la mejor manera de ayudar a tu mamá es no creandole más problemas y denunciando los abusos de su pareja.<br>  Saludos!

24bBJ1JUaa	Unclear what you mean by he messes with your head, but that doesn't sound good.  Sounds like he is deliberately playing you, alternatively ignoring you and charming you?  Also sounds like  you already know the answer to your question. Seems to me he is interested in you - but that he is also interested in several other girls too - and that he may be a player and a user.  Who needs a guy like that?  You are just one of the pack to them.  Sweet, kind, shy boys are better.<br>  <br>  If you are still interested in him, then try to look at his qualities objectively and get past the way he makes your pulse jump - is he really a nice guy?  Does he like animals?  Is he nice to everyone, not just the popular kids?  Is he a bully or mean?  How does he treat other girls?  Has he had other girlfriends?  Was he mean to any of them?  Is he interesting and fun to talk to?  Is he respectful of women?<br>  <br>  If you decide he is worth it, then flirt back, be encouraging - but, for goodness sake, respect yourself and use your common sense.  Expect him to treat you well, with courtesy and, if he is interested and sincere, to take you on real dates and pay for everything - and don't leap into anything physical (I don't care what anyone says, you shouldn't be having sex in high school unless you have been dating the guy for at least 1 or 2 years straight - and even then I'm not so sure it's a good idea!).  If he doesn't treat you with respect, or doesn't ask you out, then later for him!  There are plenty of great guys out there!!

0Id85yiYaa	it's nature. he's going to do it whether you like it or not. you can either accept that there's nothing you can do about it, or let there be tension and jealousy. even if you make him promise that he won't do it, he's still going to do it. it's not a crime, it doesn't mean that he's more attracted to porn stars, it doesn't mean that he wants the two of you to do it like porn stars; it means that he's a man. just accept it.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Men are hard wired differently than women and men also look at porn, they do not attach any significance to it other than pleasure, they do not want every woman they see, it is a guy thing and you need to understand it means nothing, no more than watching a football game and you must not put yourself in competition with it, because you are in real life the porn is a fantasy. I do not know any guy who does NOT look at porn.|`|0s89N6gCaa	You just feel cheated.<br>  I did. When  me and my husband first got married he did this. I finally told him if he wanted to have sex with me, great. If he wanted to look at other naked women on the computer that he could stick his business in the computer after he got his self all hot & bothered. Just don't come to me if a photo is better that a real boob stuck in your face!<br>  That pretty much fixed his porn Phase.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	First off I think your over reacting, if he is still preforming for you everyday, then it is obvious that he just has a high sex drive.  The porn is an easy release for him, it has nothing to do with the size, shape, beauty of the people involved, it is just sex.  If your still feeling insecure about yourself, you can suggest that you and him make a porn video that he can view at his own pleasure.  Pictures are great, but for some, they like to view and hear the action.  Good luck sweetie, and stop worrying.  You need not worry until he stops pleasing you and prefers his hands, then you will have a concern.|`|OG4410bdaa	wow you are insecure<br>  <br>  ok<br>  1- he doesn't enjoy these women more than he enjoys you; they are just pictures and movies, you are the real deal touch-and-feel; trust me, he enjoys you more<br>  2- its probably just a boredom thing, pretty much all guys do it (ALOT of women do it too!) and if your relationship was secure then it wouldn't be a problem for you (many couples in secure relationships even look at it together, as a means of getting new ideas for positions and role-plays, or as a means of becoming arroused, sometimes having a porn on in the background while you're having sex is a way of giving you something to compete with: whose having the better time?)<br>  3- he doesn't think of them when he's having sex with you, in fact he's probably not thinking about much of anything besides enjoying the task at hand<br>  <br>  all that said<br>  you need to relax and get over it<br>  its not like he's rubbing the fact that he watchs porn in your face or anything...I'm actually wondering how you even know he's doing it? do you like check the history on his laptop or something? because I really hope you're not invading his privacy like that...<br>  all things said, I will reiterate: relax and get over it<br>  <br>  its not like he's cheating on you with nor leaveing you for a porn star|`|hjc2y3TMaa	You are over thinking this way too much. I really doubt he is thinking about those other women when you two are together. He's doing it because it's fun for him. Let it be... if he only does it occassionally when he's home from work...leave him alone. Relationshps aren't just some trap, he should be able to fantasize at least a little...I don't think men put any emotional investment into porn, I think they just like the pictures. Lots of women do too.|`|3OFxasXHaa	i also like to go into a harley dealership and look at all the bikes.  i even ride my bike there when i go.  that doesn't mean i want to trade in my bike, i just appreciate nice bikes.  not like i'm going test riding them.<br>  <br>  for guys, porn fits the same way|`|AA11883929	He thinks you are digusting and needs to look at women that really get him going.  <br>  <br>  That is sarcasm.  Variety is the spice of life for men.  Be happy he isn't out looking for it.  |`|hCAQ6aWWaa	You need to get confidence in yourself.  Who cares if he looks at porn, its not real.  |`|5sccuzrBaa	Girl, loosen up. Yes, guys like it. They are visual. It is not a big deal. You could watch it with him some time if he likes it. Incorporate it into your sex life. You should not feel bad about yourself, but you also should not make him feel bad about watching it occasionally. There is nothing to worry about if he just does it occasionally. If he does it all the time or stays home just for that purpose, that is a problem. It's a natural thing. You say you are not insecure, but you sound insecure if it makes you feel bad about yourself. I'm sure you're beautiful and he is attracted to you, but that does not mean you are the only thing in this world he is attracted to. |`|7yFWxvv3aa	I totally understand how you feel...I'm there right now. I actually just recently (two weeks ago) spoke to my husband about it and told him exactly how it males me feel. I didn't nag and I didn't yell or give him an attitude. I'm sure your bf feels bad after he does it, which is why he's so secretive about it. <br>  <br>  Talk to him and tell him that you know and how it makes you feel. He may be embarassed or angry, but he'll get over it. If you tell him exactly what you wrote in the question, he'll totally understand where you're coming from. It's not healthy that he looks at porn and I highly believe that if you let him continue with these habits, there's a possiblity that can then turn to chatting when he gets bored at just looking and that in which can turn into cheating. Ask him to stop. Best of luck to you. <br>  <br>  |`|9gxzPlZZaa	I was the same way I thought it was horrible for my man to look at porn  I thought it was because I wasn't doing it for him. I was wrong I started watching it with him and we would make it a once a month thing to rent movies and have a crazy night. Honestly watching the movies and him get turned on turned me on, It isn't a bad thing and you should try it, its much better then him liking women so much that he would rather be out with different ones, at least he's at home and he can't touch. When I first got with my Fiance he said his ex went ballistic on him for watching it and that made him do it on sneak more and more but since now we both enjoy it very much just try to spice it up a little, its not so bad believe me!!!|`|MELLvdGkaa	wow i can relate, i agree with you about having enough self confidence in your looks but its weird too i agree, because what is the fascination? all in all....All I can come up with is guys will be guys, they think different than us. My bf always makes jokes about it, and has admitted to me hes looked at it a few times since weve been together (about a year now), and I have even confronted him and said "look its weird for me okay, just let it go dont bring it up i dont want to watch it with you respect my decision and who i am and what i want" he replys "youre weird whats wrong with it, did something happen to you or something" ...good luck<br>  Being upset about it doesnt help guess we just have to accept them for who they are...good luck again!|`|OY1y0HIvaa	I don't think that if a man looks at porn he is forgetting about you... Seriously... if he looks at a girl on tv... Will he ever get her?? NO!!  it is all part of fantasy... In my opinion ... my husband can look all he wants... he is still not gonna get it... lol... and when I get home... He can look at me and feel me....  I am real... and I will actually do things to him to make him come back from fantasy world... Yes, I may not be blonde and with 34 ddd's but mine aer real and 500 men have not gotten ahold of them,....<br>  <br>  |`|zwfydpHPaa	Do not feel bad about yourself. It is kinda weird that he looks at porn during the day when I am sure there are other things to do. I am sure he think's of the girl's during sex. If he can't respect your feelings on an issue such as this then he doesn't care the way he should. There is a problem when a man can't refrain.|`|AA10195399	First of all it is an addiction on their part.  And yes he is thinking of these other girls while in bed with you. <br>  Do not feel bad about yourself.  This is his problem not yours.  Men are just pigs.  Either find someone else or take the porn and get rid of it.  That's what I just did to my husband....2 garbage bags full of porn....|`|sbUDQ7UZaa	I have the same problem with my man! Don't worry! It is in a guys instinct to watch porn...it does not mean he thinks any less of you! I'm sure he loves you very much. my man looks at porn everyday...it used to bother me then i had a talk with him about it. he says he could never see himself with the girls in the clips because they are so fake. |`|7pqSoHVdaa	Do you need chocolate?  NO, you want it.  Same with men.  They like looking at it.  ANd no, it doesnt mean he doesnt like you or likes them more than you.  Its just that it is out there, so why not?|`|CGL3EA4faa	All men look at porn. Its what they do. Men are turned on by what they see. Women are turned on by what they hear. Hence the reason we like being told we are beautiful etc. <br>  He isn't being turned on by these actual women themselves, more what they are doing. The fact that they are in these provocative poses turns most men on. They look at them and what they are doing.<br>  Don't feel for one moment that he fancies them more than you. That is just nonsense. He doesn't. It is something that he can control. He doesn't feel pressurised to perform for you. Its sex for him, pleasing himself without having to worry about pleasing you. All men do it.<br>  I used to think that way until my husband explained it to me. Now I don't feel bad about myself. My husband is gorgeous (like the lead singer of Disturbed and I look like a short fat version of Scully from the X-Files!) so trust me when I tell you that your man loves you. He is turned on by you. He just used porn like most men for release.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|Tx5zBbAraa	you sound like me! I don't like the thought of my boyfriend looking at porn, but he still does it. It doesn't mean that he likes them more than you...usually they're not that pretty.. All guys look at porn, but it doesn't mean at all that they like them more than you. He could possibly be fantasizing, but if you say you have a good sex life, he probably doesn't think about them. If you both are pleased, he probably thinks about what he can do to please you. you know?<br>  <br>  I don't think you should worry much about it. It can be ultimately annoying though! If it gets to the point where he watches it when you're around, then just simply ask him if there's a reason he watches it, that has anything to do with you. He'll probably say no... he's probably just horny and bored...|`|c3cZinyraa	It sounds like an addiction. I know this is weird or funny coming from a guy but I've had the same struggle. I recently got married and absolutely love my wife. For years I struggled with porn. Not trying to sell you into the idea or anything but the only thing that truly helped me was Jesus. Porn is such a selfish act. It's a way for guys to to hide behind a screen without commitment. I believe he loves you and has no intention of hurting you. I think he is simply addicted and it's not easy to overcome. I suggest bringing it up to him but be very careful because he could get very defensive about it. Most guys are embarrassed with their addiction. You can always help him out also, for me I've learned to do little things like turn over the racy magazine covers, turn the channel when it gets too reveling, and I never get on the computer without someone else in the room. I think if yo mention it to him and let him know that it hurts you he should make an effort to stop if he truly loves you. |`|mufMWjMPaa	Many people say it's a guy thing.  I personally am with you on this one.  I feel the same way about porn as you do.  I think in a way it's a little sick.  I suggest you let him know how you feel because it will probably never go away and you might feel worse with time.  I never got used to the idea of my husbanding watching that stuff.  I see no point when like you said, they have their wife/girlfriend to look at. 
gw72SF03aa	Do u mean that if you do get turned down you will be made fun of?? i think thats what u mean anyway it sounds like your really lacking confident my friend. You shouldnt feel like shes too good for you. Just because she goes out with all these guys (which isnt gonna be a good thing in the future trust me) does not make her better than you or any other girl. If you get turned down it won't be because she's too good for you but at worst it'll b because your not her type. I say you grow some and ask her out, expect the best but be prepare for the worst. Act like you done it before whether she saids yes or no. Don't show too much emotion and make sure you smile. Smiling comes across as confidence. Good Luck|`|NNiN0tK0aa	ask her in private and ask her not to tell anyone, if she turns you down.<br>  girls cant really choose who they like.  they could meet their idea of the perfect boy and not like them at all, then they can meet the exact opposite and find him irresistable, so don't take it personally.  theres no such thing as her being too good for you.  she could end up with the worst boy in the world.  its just the luck of the draw.  when cupid shoots his chemistry arrow.  it might have landed on you, it might not, but you'll never know if you don't ask.|`|1j60dOgOaa	Just go for it. Nobody remembers what happened in high school when you are an adult anyways and adult world is the real world, teenage world is just like a waiting room for that so whatever you do now doesnt matter as long as you do ok in adult world. Dont worry about embarrassment or anything, it just doesnt matter at your age (though it may seem it does, in a few years it wont).|`|DBQlF7Pwaa	Build a friendship with this girl first. Once you start a conversation, you'll break the ice on both sides. Start off with something simple, like "Hey, did you see (pick a good movie) in theaters??" And just let her sort of direct the conversation and she'll wind up on a topic that she likes to talk about. Try to avoid yes or no questions, because you want to keep her talking. Within a few minutes you'll find out more about what she likes. Try this for a few days, then on say, the third day, don't talk to her. Just say hi, and then wait and see if she strikes up a conversation. If she does, you're golden! Go for it. Be confident, and don't ever tell yourself you're not good enough to have what you want. Speaking for women in general, we like confidence!|`|1XQ25XDjaa	 the best thing to do is to be yourself thats the best thing dont change yourself for nobody.If she doesnt like you for who you are then thats her problem you tried your best.There are other fishes in the sea.Be confident and be yourself thats attractive|`|UznS7tWsaa	Just ask her whats the worst that can happen. If she says no just move on, and don't doubt yourself because you never kno how she feels.|`|PtZSQ3D0aa	never stop talking because you are shy!!!!maybe she loves you too but she thinks you are too good for her!!!<br>  go talk to her and find out how does she think about you.
eTxh2So7aa	support and visitation are two seperate orders. if he was ever charged and convicted of domestic violence, he is only entitled to supervised visitations.|`|AA11604319	Child support is almost always paid via wage assignment now.  There are few exceptions.<br>  <br>  Visitation is as stated in the court order and I would not budge on it being supervised at this point.<br>  <br>  Stick to what the court ordered and you will be fine.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0jSMzv3raa	I am on dad's side. Sorry.<br>  There is society 'rules' and there is so called civilised 'law'.<br>  These all seem to heavily favour women and their fears though. They do not favour justice or what is morally right.<br>  Lawyers even provide tuition to women on what to say and do in order to keep dad out of the way (legally) - because she is uncomfortable with seeing him after the break up.<br>  <br>  I believe that you and dad made your child. That you and dad have an EQUAL right to see this child - un bloody supervised - and that what each of you does with your child on your time is totally between you and the child. In other words, you do what you want when your child is with you and he does what he wants when the child is with him. He should not need your permission nor approval. It is his time with his child.<br>  <br>  You probably don't want to hear this, sorry, its just a personal opinion.But I have been prevented from seeing my son for ten years because his mother lied and because courts believed her tearful hysteria. Supervised access? Its a punishment handed out any time a woman makes something up.<br>  Put it into perspective:- <br>  All Dads miss out on stuff with their children when they are married and in a loving relationship, either due to work or life commitments; they are not taken to court or bad mouthed or told they can only see their kids after work if there is someone around to supervise them are they?<br>  Why should they be just because the marriage is over?<br>  Oh, that's right, because mum has to PUNISH them some more.|`|16d570b2a5b1dc85d7f15e4a1cbc7feaaa	It sounds like she would be better off without him in her life.  As nice as the money is, ask her father if he'd rather sign away parental rights and not have to pay child support.  If it's in her best interests, it'd be worth anything you have to give up for it. |`|ec3abe8a5314184534ae11fbf1b0ce47aa	Well, it is good you are concerned about your child's well being, but you also can't deny your child a father. You don't have to like the girlfriend or the way she looks. The only thing you have to be concerned with is how she treats your child. Keeping the child away from the father or having supervised visits will only lead the child to believe that "there is something wrong with daddy" which could lead to the child not wanting to see his/her father or the father not wanting the hassle of the visits and not see the child at all. If you are uncomfortable allow your child to visit through the week for only a few hours and see how the child likes it. But you must remember not to poke and prod the child w/ questions upon his/her return and simply ask if it was a fun visit. Things have a way of working themselves out bit if you keep stressing it will only make things worse for your child and that is who you are trying to protect in the first place. |`|esjQZOtvaa	i think as a parent to a parent that you are doing what is best for your daughter.  if the court order states supervised visitations, then it is what it is. as far as child support, if he had in fact paid the way he should have then he wouldn't be in that situation for them to garnish the wages.  who supervises the visitations?  if it is you then due to the fact of his past i wouldn't trust to be alone with your daughter knowing he is this angry. i would ask your father or another male relative to stay with you while these visitations are going on. don't be hard on yourself.  YOU ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING AS A PARENT!!!!!!  Good Luck!
xXa3eQOeaa	One thing that is essential in a marriage, COMPROMISE. Learn it!<br>  Dreams are nice, but your dream is not His dream.

"Life" throws us many curve-balls. "Plans" rarely ever work. You need to realize that and develop your skills in "adapting & improvising".<br>  I'm not trying to be "mean", just being honest.

You can't both have your way so if you can't work it out, you may not be able to stay together. I think that 25 is still pretty young and don't see why you couldn't wait a few years. Marriage is very serious stuff. I wouldn't be in a rush. |`|QP8LdPLeaa	you should be concerned on WHO you're marrying and WHY you're marrying. not "oh i want to marry at age 22 or 24." that's not important. who said you couldn't have children after 25 and up? if he is not ready, he is not ready. and if you can't wait a few years then maybe you need to date someone else. women always find this need to rush marriage and they wonder why they always end up divorcing. if he doesnt match your "dream" then let him go.<br>  <br>  in my blunt opinion, you dont sound ready for marriage even by age 21<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT*<br>  you are NOT your mother, she is a totally different person, with a totally different health, with a totally different pregnacy. who said YOU were going go through that? my grandmtoher had a very easy pregnacy with my aunt. but when my mom was pregnant with me, she threw up all over the place and was miserable. so even though they were mother and daughter, they both had two totally different pregnancies. if all you want to do is hurry up and have children, you may as well skip marriage plans. no marriage is going to work if all you want to do is achieve giving birth. thats not what marriage is about. you have to have a strong bond, love, commitment and ambition to keep the marriage healthy. what if your soon to be husband gets in an accident and he can't have ids anymore? what then? this is something you have to think about. marriage isnt simple. you need to sit downa nd sort yourself and try to think if you would STILL love and stay with him if something were to happen.|`|lpUYyEbYaa	There's nothing wrong with having kids in your late 20's early 30's.

ZmDOvzJWaa	well, maybe you should tell him how you feel about him and ask him if he feels the same way too. Or if that is too embarrassing, just play a simple game of truth or dare, if he says dare just say 'I dare you to say who you like' or if he says truth just say 'who do you like?' Hope I helped. Trust me, I've had ALOT of experience!|`|oJQmzPahaa	Yes I think so.  He just has such strong feelings for you now that he is making sure he doesn't say anything wrong.  He might be nervous around you too and doesn't know what to say in fear that you won't like him anymore.|`|fe1b76b6a20dce1bd151bf45adbc8d6daa	nope|`|m7fbc0Fyaa	Only he can answer that. <br>  He knows if he's busy, if he stopped liking you, or whatever the case may be.<br>  <br>  I think you should talk to him. If you've realized you like him, and knew he liked you, you should tell him. Maybe something can happen.<br>  <br>  If you don't act, he may find someone else and you'll be left behind, feeling bummed.|`|EJVKqFiHaa	It also could be how you show him your love.<br>  <br>  If he feels he's getting the cold shoulder.. eventually guys stop saying those things.

But don;t you think he'd just make a clean break?<br>  <br>  The second thing is more likely. You've hit a rut. He's become so comforatable that it just goeswithout saying that he loves you.<br>  <br>  I would just talk to him. Not on aim, or the phone, or text. Sit down with him and express your feelings. That's the only way you're going to know for sure.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.

I have one.  I think it's important though that you find a guy with a similar sexual libido as yours (in my view sex can be a fantastic part of a relationship but if your sex drives are different it can be a nightmare), and also you can't use a boyfriend as an emotional crutch.  You're supposed to complement each other as people and support each other, but not be emotionally dependent on each other.|`|FKMKQbqPaa	it is easy to be all philosophical when you arent the partner frustrated by an unfulfilling sex life.  when you are the one on the short end, it keeps you from being the mate you could be.  you walk around frustrated and upset all the time, and let's face it, that doesnt lead to intimacy, sharing and the things you need to do for one another.<br>  <br>  where i agree it isnt all about sex, but sex is part of it.  what happened to taking care of one another's needs?  i sacrifice for my partner, and she should sacrifice for me as well.  each gives 100% and works for one another and that is how it works best, in my opinion.|`|b34a54682dc09f70279f26554322d78aaa	Good men are around - they're rare but they are still available.

I see it as being a part of a search for answers to the situations that we find ourselves in.  Here we can ask the questions that maybe we can't in our own lives.  I find it refreshing to read the responses of others and the opinions of others on situations that I face each day.  Sometimes the ideas that I read here give me options that I might not thought of or had otherwise.  Exchanging ideas and opinions is always the way to go to learn and grow.|`|uUfyOLceaa	When one to one relationships break down or break up (odd how it means the same thing), we all go back to the group or gang of friends. It's natural. Married people often lose touch with their old gang of friends, so some come here. Reading this forum is only half of that gang of friends relationship. You being part of it is the other half. In the 1800's, an Austrian emperor put over 100 orphans in a nursery where they all got taken care of except for affection or holding. They all perished because they needed human connection. We all have to connect with other people in a relationship or something in us perishes. Your depression and sadness gets lighter when we all help carry a little part of it as part of a relationship with you. It's OK to share it here. You need to share it somewhere. Good luck.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	I don't think it is so much of a sign of depression as it is something to do with your time and the ability to share info. in an anonymous way.  Sometimes it is easier than talking to a friend.  Sometimes it gives you a new way of looking at things.|`|FCcbgriuaa	It could mean a lot of things. you just feel lonely and probably don't have anyone to tell your problems too.

AA10911598	He may be cheating.  A sudden change in behavior is an indicator.  I would have a chat with the text-ed friend yourself.  Ask her what your husband has said to her.  Not telling you the truth is wrong.  Tex-ting another woman is wrong if you are not aware of their relationship and what is said.|`|UgcPxd4maa	either is cheating or will cheat - either or, I'd get out of the marriage if he chooses speaking to her over what makes you happy.|`|tbJraueLaa	interesting," suddenly marriage doesn't work for him.."|`|lN5d688gaa	that's how it usually starts.  you're not crazy.|`|aWgdX0pZaa	If my husband ever starts txt msging a girl, i would divorce him in a heart beat and i can tell you he would do the same thing.

Best of luck to you.|`|xwfm7t7Xaa	I would have to say at this point it could go either way, but you CANNOT prove he is cheating just b/c you found text from another woman or he feels the marriage won't work.

I feel comfortable hanging out with guys, drinking wine, whatever.  But I love my boyfriend, and he trusts me and I trust him.  If a girl tells you she has a boyfriend, you have to respect that.  But... she said she "soft of" has a boyfriend?  Ask her straight up what that's supposed to mean.  It sounds like she's taken though.  <br>  <br>  There comes a point when girls and guys have to learn to be just friends... just because she's hanging out with you doesn't mean she's falling for you.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	I'd hang out with a guy friend to watch a movie and drink wine.

Maybe you should give her more wine and get her drunk then ask her, I don't know it really up to you, you stud. I was kidding about the drunk stuff.

54ro47TIaa	An intervention is a great idea - because it's less mentally invasive to the addict than throwing them in rehab with strangers.<br>  <br>  As the leader of an intervention, you are responsible for the introduction - when you sit her down tell her "We all love you and care about you and we want to help you stop this unhealthy habbit. We're all going to do whatever we can to support you and keep you focused on recovering and stopping drugs."<br>  I think most interventions then lead to each person inputting their own personal message to the addict about how they feel about the person - about the times they miss having with the person sober - and instilling the sense of support/concern.<br>  Also, you should, as the leader, think of ways to physically help your friend. Propose to start spending more time with her. Do some recreational activities, watch movies, go to the gym, take up a hobby with all your friends.<br>  Lastly, make sure all of you keep her away from an unhealthy environment and others who will ruin her getting sober. Your friend needs a support system with a plan to remove her from the drug - and that's the best thing all of you can supply.<br>  Best of luck!

wpiWiWFiaa	I do not think you over reacted at all.  If you have spoken with her before and told her how touchy this subject is with you she should have gotten the point.  If she had a problem with it she should have told you right away, not do things behind your back.  In one of my past relationships myspace honestly caused so many problems that we both just got rid of it.  If she has texting on her phone what is the need to have myspace.  Myspace causes way more problems than any other website ever.  If i was in that situation I would have asked the person to cut down their use of Myspace if they couldn't be honest with me and tell me what's going on if it involves an issue that is touchy with me.  Just sit down with her and tell her like it is.  Flirting in my mind is cheating, yes it may be harmless but you have no idea what the other person intentions are....|`|8aImmdJxaa	My boyfriend,would have gotten pretty mad if that was the case with me.<br>  <br>  <br>  Okay but idk looking at your case i think i would just be like oh hey well i texted you that one day and i wasn't sure if something was wrong or something so i checked your myspace just to see if you were on,not in the stalker way of course. But im sorry to say...i saw the comment you left your ex or whatever,and im sorry i had to see that,but now that i did..i feel uncomfortable...and continue with how you feel. But don't forget to mention how it was an accident you came across and you didnt mean to lurk
pPxEhKnaaa	It means the same thing, he's just saying in a way that he's comfortable saying it!|`|pqd6CFuxaa	dont read into it. all this is is him getting more comfortable with love;) its no big deal. he still means it;)|`|JDiTHSoUaa	omg are you serious ??
VUR8hhiTaa	I met my boyfriend on <a href="http://wwwsinglesnet.info" rel="nofollow">http://wwwsinglesnet.info</a><br>  It took about a month, and he showed interest in me. I registered for a lot of different ones, and didn't like most. This one is the best so far, and the best thing is it is free!|`|JCdBSULraa	Well the only truly free ones I've seen are okcupid.com and plentyoffish.com, no one says you can't have a profile on both. <br>  <br>  As for pay sites, match.com, true.com, chemistry.com are all scams, you can pay them to talk to people, but unless the people you're talking to have also paid, they won't be able to read or reply, so basically you'll be able to talk to less than 1% of the people there.  <br>  <br>  True.com is even more evil because once you give them your credit card info, they will not let you quit unless you make numerous phone calls.  And even after you cancel your account, they keep your profile up there for all eternity, and there's nothing you can do to ever remove it, so you keep getting spammed by people who are interested in you.  They also send fake notices of interest on your behalf to people, so someone you'd never date would get an "email" from you flirting with them.   <br>  <br>  The only pay site that's worth the time is eharmony, but it's crazy expensive, and there's a 1 in 5 chance they won't do business with you, and they'll tell you you're too much of a loser to use their site (thankfully this is before they charge you at least).|`|Qq6KczCZaa	you can go for a paid sign up, if you are really serious about picking a dating mate online, as since they charge a fee, all those who sign up are pretty serious about their intentions to actually find their potential mate.

1HfLkTrdaa	You're not alone. According to the most recent Census Bureau statistics, 2.2 million women lack custody of their children in the U.S.<br>  <br>  Despite those numbers, unfortunately, there is still a stigma against non-custodial mothers. There are those who still believe that all women have a strong 'maternal instinct' and if anyone is different than that, then they're somehow flawed or 'bad'.   <br>  <br>  In most cases, the mother usually is the appropriate parent to get full custody. However, there are a number of cases where the children are better off with the father.  It should be done on a case-by-case basis.<br>  <br>  No one should be judging non-custodial mothers.  They don't know why that mother might not have custody....the mother may have chosen not to seek custody for valid reasons.|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Divorce is hard.  Joint custody would seem the best.  For some reason I think the girls love their father because he is not a disciplinarian.  My ex-wife and I have remained friends for the common interest of our daughter.  I am a softie and she is stern but with our common interest in loving our daughter we have managed to come up with a perfect balance of our personalities for the betterment of our daughter.  Good luck to you.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	it should all be about the best interest of the children/ child if it is in their best interest to stay in the comfort of the home they grew up in then so be it|`|AA10500537	yes its ok if you don;t want to be a mother figure in their life.<br>  for myself i;d have to have partial custody at least,|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	I actually don't think its a bad thing for the dad to have the majority of the custody. I do think its a bad thing for the mother to just hand the kids over simply because of financial reasons.<br>  If the mother gained full custody the father would pay child support, that would help ease the financial strain. It also depends who has more time - if the father is better of financially, is it because he works a lot of hours? If so, that would not be a good situation for the kids to be in....|`|YgRZCYZkaa	Wow- finally someone thinking about the best interest of this children.  I don't think anything is wrong with this as long as your children will still have you in their lives.  Make sure to develop a visitation agreement that will work (Maybe evern half the week if possible).  If he's a good dad and you're a good mom- the kids shouldn't have to miss out because you can't be married anymore.|`|2772e87aa33409feddb59d5fab2d13f9aa	It is totally ok that the kids stay with their father.  You just feel bad because this is probably the first time you have ever been apart from your kids.  If your ex-husband can provide better for the kids and he's a great dad then what is the problem.  You just be sure to pick up your lil ones on the weekends and talk to then everyday.  All will be alright.|`|SuOfRTXzaa	Honestly see nothing wrong with it - in this day and age i don't think its an issue like it used to be, don't feel guilty after all you have the childrens best interest at heart and you will obviously see them over weekends and holidays|`|ep7IoRcPaa	It is totall OK.<br>  <br>  I have been married and divorced twice, never hired a lawyer and noone ever tried to take the kids.<br>  <br>  I am SUPERDAD, and it sounds like your X is a goo dad too.|`|6a3e68591559079347d376d3ad8f42c0aa	I think it is ok to leave da children with either parents as long as they taking care of.|`|pxygDg7Aaa	I stayed with my dad after the divorce.  It was a better situation for me and for him.  There is nothing wrong with it.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Typically, women are the primary caregivers for the children. This is why children stay with their mothers.<br>  <br>  There is no reason for a child not to live with thier father, it's just irrational for a child to live with the person who, up til the time of the divorce, was not thier primary caregiver.|`|fN23bHi0aa	Society.  The world thinks guys don't know anything about kids.  There was a show ere teens tried to be parents and 90% of the girls gave up and the guys took over.  Guys can take care of kids just as much as woman can.
pxygDg7Aaa	There is another woman we wants to have sex with.  Trust me.. . . .it's that easy.|`|xQhmXMQgaa	Hmmmm... he meant every word, at least in that moment.  My guess is that you have been very happy all this time but clearly he has not been.  You need to ditch the anger, because he won't talk while you are angry and this will spiral.  <br>  <br>  I don't mean you are wrong to feel betrayed, the words were very hurtful.  They have been said, can't be taken back and now you have to decide to deal with the source of those words or not.<br>  <br>  Its up to you.|`|PPLxDKYwaa	He may be going through a little phase. He is bored and wants spark in the relationship and may think finding some one and starting over is more appealing. He may like some one now and can't stop thinking about her and wondering what it would be like to be with her instead. Get counseling and sit down and talk. It may just be a little bump in the road - just don't lose it on him but at the same time stand ur ground.|`|zIMoBfuvaa	He could have an interest in someone else..Or he may just be stressed with all these responsibilities and wish he could be young and free and have fun without a care in the world. Try to move past any anger and try to re-kindle the flame in your relationship. Things can definitely get better if you put forth the effort and really make him fall in love all over again. :)|`|KtdlJbrOaa	To be honest - he probably just sees a lot of guys his age who are still single & is envying their lifestyle and lack of responsibility.   I am often envious of my single friends - they can just leave/go out whenever they want.  (I'm divorced with 3 children).  That does not mean I'd give up my life for anything.  You need to show him the fun things in married life!|`|ANOasnOmaa	This isn't just out of the blue. He has been thinking this way for awhile. Communicate, seek help or something before it's too late. I kinda went through this with my wife. It will only get harder, trust me.|`|6cm6MB66aa	Guess he was saying you wasnt fun at all just a pain in the azz .|`|FtyLwqR5aa	I think there is another interest in his life and he is feeling very tied down and don't want to move on it while with you. Might want to sit him down and ask him what's going on before it is to late.|`|1F6ZnYtXaa	I agree with the answer above- obviously he has met someone that he would like to sleep with. That can be a problem with marrying young. I would suggest trying to move past the anger stage, and into trying to fix the underlying problem for him. Perhaps there are things that can be done to re spark the flame, try new things in the bedroom, therapy, etc. Dont let anger cloud your vision.|`|oNXygeVZaa	There might be someone else in his live, and he dosen't know how to deal with it.  Maybe you should talk to him and ask if ther's something that is missing in his life...and maybey the two of you can work it out.   My husband and I are high school sweethears - and that's my biggest fear. - Good Luck!|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	Sounds like he was just having a off day where he wished he made his choices diffrently. All married couples go through this at some point. Just remind him that you can have fun together and do those things.|`|AA10500537	if he;s staying out later than usual and   not paying attention to you  you know he ahs a girlfriend .<br>  just follow him  sme evening and you;ll know for yourself|`|UFOdwXgfaa	Someone else is in the picture
ep7IoRcPaa	Men do not have ESP.<br>  <br>  YES, ask him.|`|FxlA9obIaa	Yup yup!  Ask about that status, girl!|`|7KZOOkYYaa	Just ask him! You will never know until you ask him!|`|cn49BbRiaa	It depends on how long you guys have been dating for. <br>  If its over 3 months then you should ask him.|`|dd9559c1e59d3b44217363867d81b42baa	Ask, you'll never know.<br>  Just Do it!|`|PA7kYyAxaa	Date someone else.|`|Tv0DkZuoaa	You need to talk him and see what his opinion on the whole  thing...
LxvA4vGpaa	If he was able to hurt you in person he should be able to apologize in person.  <br>  <br>  <br>  I definitely would not accept it.|`|UFOdwXgfaa	I wouldn't accept his apology until he came in person so I could see how sincere that person is|`|e1oky4jSaa	No way, a texted apology? That doesn't seem sincere at all.|`|AA10500537	it really depends on how bad the hurt was . <br>  and really up to you|`|tNBWRPIdaa	heck no, that is crazy talk .. why can't he apologize to you to your face??? you shouldn't take that.. you should make him BEG. (sorry i am not a man hater, this is just what i would do. ) You would be surprised as to all that a man would be willing to do to get you back, plus you can see whether he really loves you or not.|`|fLU63N4kaa	I don't know. It's up to you. How bad was the thing he did? If it was really terrible than he should man up. Or maybe you should just forget it and move on.<br>  <br>  Always forgive your enemies but remember who they are.|`|W0nImzeqaa	no. Texted aplogy can be fake n he could be laughing while texting it. tell him to do it face to face or not at all|`|GegQJNzSaa	is texting a way of communicating with everyone If it is,then accept. Its a new way of talking,but its still talking!|`|g8QMrSzwaa	i would like to see him apologizing in person...|`|VK0czcdtaa	yeah..but be like can i would like it better in person<br>  :)<br>  or can we meet and then bring up the subject|`|AFx0PCGvaa	Hell no, what a cop out..|`|FBhjhjR0aa	That's really up to you. Personally I feel that texting is like saying "you aren't important enough for me to speak to"...|`|JkvlAVX2aa	Can you define what incident that hurt you "deeply"?<br>  <br>  Without that context, it's difficult to say whether a text apology is appropriate or not.

Of course everyone wants to put on their best face in a relationship.<br>  But only a real relationship is based on who you truly are. So if you really care about this person and hope she cares back then tell her. If she cares she will be supportive. If she loves you she will be by your side even during the bad times. And if she doesn't care best to find out now and find someone who does. Honesty is the best policy. Good luck and don't let your bad health get the best of you. Life always has its bad with the good. Its normal.|`|ecJqfktmaa	I think you should realy tell her the truth i mean surely she cant get mad that you have health problems if she doesnt take it well then give her time surely she will inderstand.<br>  <br>  Good Luck i hope your health problem goes away..<br>  Finger crossed.|`|EK4hQgD6aa	Well, tell her the truth.

Just tell her that you are worried about your own health right now and why, and let her take it from there. Either she really cares about you, or it is too early on to matter to her, in which case you can spend some more time on getting yourself feeling better.

You owe this to yourself. You could try keeping her as a friend in the meantime and tell her this when you discuss your problems. Only disclose what you feel comfortable disclosing.

You dont have to go on about everything - just tell her the basics and explain why you seem so down.
xNkmK0SHaa	I believe it would be good to talk with her about feelings,desires, long term goals, etc. before having a sexual encounter.<br>  <br>  I'll tell you why:  no matter how careful each of you is, there is no guarantee and you won't be a father without choosing that status.<br>  they way to know/proceed:  if she loves you without sex, she is a keeper; other than that - you're out there on your own.,
1HfLkTrdaa	A valid pre-nuptual agreement CAN apply to widow(ers) as well as to divorced persons.  <br>  <br>  Case in point? When the late news anchor Peter Jennings died in 2005, he left behind a $50M estate. He also had a pre-nup with his 4th wife, news producer Katherine "Kayce" Freed, whom he married in 1997. The pre-nup remained valid.  <br>  <br>  Because of that pre-nup, Freed got 50% of Jennings's estate. The rest went to Jennings's two children by his 3d wife, Kati Marton, and at least $1M of it went to Jennings's designated charities. That's administered through a foundation Jennings had set up in 1998.<br>  <br>  Neither Marton nor either of Jennings's other 2 ex-wives received anything from the estate.<br>  <br>  The terms of prenuptual agreements mainly depend on the laws in the state it was drawn up, and whether or not the state is a community property state. New Mexico is a community property state. Also much will depend on if there was a "sunset" clause in the agreement.<br>  <br>  If I were your grandmother, I'd consult an attorney.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	A prenup only applies in the case of divorce.  <br>  <br>  Your grandmother should have been his P.O.A.  Is there a reason someone else in his family was able to obtain P.O.A. since your grandmother is still alive?  Is she maybe experiencing memory issues or not in sound mind to make big decisions? That is the only time someone other than the spouse can be P.O.A.<br>  <br>  My family recently had a similar situation, and in the end, I don't know near enough of the details of your situation regarding how they got the P.O.A. and if it is valid, etc.  The other family could have pulled a fast one, which was what my aunt did to great Uncle.  She had him sign over P.O.A. to her, then was selling off all of his things before he was even sick.  She had spent all of his money (millions) before he was sick enough to place in a nursing home.  The last few months he was alive, he didnt even have enough money hardly to live in the nursing home....we had to scrape together to make the monthly payments to keep him there.  Now my aunt is in jail serving probably the rest of her life behind those bars.  She had over 30 charges when all was said and done.<br>  <br>  But a prenup has nothing to do with this situation.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	Depending on the content of the prenup...<br>  <br>  Whatever your grandmother is entitled to by the prenup, she has the legal right to keep them.<br>  <br>  Keep it in mind that a widow has the first and highest priority to the assets of the deceased spouse.|`|b552f8c9544b98d905c574a9b981e2c4aa	I am not a lawyer, but my guess is that a binding contract is only valid for the parties that signed it.  Therefore, once the other person dies, the pre-nup contract is void.|`|fYcYPyR3aa	Yes, pre nuptial only protects your money if you get divorced, not if your spouse dies. Unless it's stated otherwise in your grandfather's will, your Grandfather's family has no right to take it on the bases of a pre-nup and it should go to your grandma.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Any legal binding contract between two given people expires upon one of those peoples demise.|`|PA7kYyAxaa	a 25 year old pre nup isn't even valid. an entire life was lived since that document existed.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	How was the family member able to obtain power of attorney when the person had a wife?<br>  <br>  Something is really wrong with this scenario.  Grandma needs to contact a lawyer.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	it depends on the state and what exactly the prenup says.<br>  <br>  Most prenups expire after 10 years.  <br>  <br>  Some states don't recognize prenups ever.<br>  <br>  usually prenups only cover what happens in the event of a divorce.  If the marriage ends in death then the prenup doesn't apply and the will does.<br>  <br>  Sounds like Granny needs a lawyer and to sue the family member for embezzlement of funds or elder abuse or something.

OsT64mqMaa	I think its a great idea.<br>  You should get exactly what you are looking for, and nothing less.<br>  Don't settle for someone you won't last with.|`|V96p5opeaa	Making a list is a GREAT idea and it's nice to see that a young girl with high standards.  I check yahoo answers all the time and respond frequently.  Generally all these girls are like.. my boyfriend is a jerk and how do I handle this etc.  They put up with so much crap from these boys, yet they continue to stay with them and basically kiss their butts, and get nothing but disrespect in return.  It's good that you have standards!  <br>  <br>  Why do you think you have horrible luck with guys?  Because you are not meeting any good ones that fit your standards?  Let me tell you something.. there are good ones out there, they are just sometimes hard to find.   Make your list and stick by it.  Don't settle for what you don't want and don't be in a hurry to find one just because you're lonely or want a boyfriend.  My daughter is 15 and she's not even allowed to date until she's 16! Of course she's not happy with the 16 "rule" so instead of looking for a boyfriend, she's just having a good time having friends that are boys.  Who knows.. one of those friends may turn out to be an actual boyfriend later.|`|061beed10d29f9c5aa986e3e09fd392daa	well its a start... at least you can have lots of preference if you meet a guy.. but then again as you said you;re still young! take your time and these beliefs, theories or whatever you call will still change as you mature.. :)
mnlKeD61aa	Okay, 2 years is pretty long and just to end it 2 weeks ago must be abit hard at the moment, but maybe she is starting realise she made a big mistake and she needs to know that you won't betray her trust again, its very important to women and girls they know they can trust a guy because what is a relationship without trust? I think you should talk to her, and actually tell her to stop messing around because you won't wait forever. as long as she knows where you stand but not forever then you should be okay.
0LSLXwWVaa	I dunno. Sometimes I think this kind of complaint is a bit shallow.|`|BRXg8Mcpaa	I agree with the above answer.  It is indeed shallow and inconsequential.|`|aH54XB1faa	When your spouse is up around 300 pounds this can become a very pressing issue!
b7yvPsiVaa	Yes, you are jealous. This has happened to me so I know about it haha.<br>  Even though you werent attracted to him, you liked the attention. Who doesn't? When he stopped caring about you, you got jealous. Now that he's with someone else, you wan't to know why he would settle for her and not keep swooning over you.<br>  Don't worry, this is natural. It will go away. It dosn't mean you like him, you just miss his attention. Just try not to obsess yourself too much and for god's sake DO NOT do anything to threaten his new relationship. Because if they break up you will be happy but you STILL won't want to be with him. Leave him alone. Find a guy to crush on. You'll forget this guy in like a week.|`|i5Ey9stBaa	I think its jealousy. I mean you think you don't like him, but you care when he gets a girlfriend. You either like him and think that the girl is not worth him or that you are better than her, other words you just want attention or that you were unknowingly enjoying it. Now that it is gone, you crave it
lGBGiKkqaa	You are 16 years old. You should never feel restricted to just one person at that age. You shouldn't have the problems of being obligated to one person. Never let him talk you into something that makes you feel uncomfortable. So I say break up with him and move on. Find someone with a job and who is allowed to date ;) And have fun don't worry about being stuck with someone.|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	Your 16 years old. This is the time of your life when you should be dating many guys your age. It is a time for you to find out the kind of guy you feel good being with. It is the time to discover different kinds of personalities each guy has and which personality you like the most and feel great when you are with that kind of personality. Going steady at this age is just crazy. You are giving up all of your young years to one guy. How will you ever know what other guys are like to date? You should not go steady with any guy until your over 21. I have been married for 37 years. I never went steady with any boy while I was in high school or college. I just dated the guys I liked and enjoyed being with. Although many of them tried to get me to be with just them, I always told them no I wasn't ready to settle for just one guy yet. I never did go steady. I went out with my husband for about 18 months when he gave me a diamond ring and asked me to marry him. When I said yes and wore his diamond ring, I stopped dating other guys. We got married a year later. When I married him I had no doubt in my mind that I wanted to be with him for the rest of my life. I was so much in love with him and I had dated plenty of guys to compare him to. Just remember this, you marry a personality. No matter how handsome he is, if he has a crappy personality he has nothing. I wanted to wake every morning with a man who was in a good moood and was fun and made me laugh and that's what I still have 37 years later.|`|iwE1QRKdaa	break up with him, you'll be happier<br>  answer mine <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ajjn_Cz.YevtvDTIKdSCg_8gBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090223131151AAdGweq">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|BRXg8Mcpaa	It seems to me like you already know the answer to this question, and just need some validation of your decision.<br>  <br>  It's time to move on.

PLEASE don't break up with him! You know, you should ONLY break up with a guy if he's done something terrible, for example, he cheats on you behind your back! But anyways, he seems like a lovely boy! He LOVES you so much, he's thinking about sharing a future with you already! That's how blissful he is, you are the apple of his eye, and if you break up with him, he will be heart broken. And I think it's silly someone finishes with someone just because that person was going too '"fast". Yes it's only been a few months, but ever heard of love at first sight? And you said he is not allowed to date? Well, when he moves out of his parents house in a year or so, THEN he can date, I mean, it's his life. So basically his parents can't force him not to date anymore. You're not allowed to take boys into the house? And you are doing so behind your mothers back? Well, don't go over to eachother's house then, a date out somewhere nice, without worrying about your mother finding evidence in the house of male flesh. Sorry if this sounds mean, but ... You expect him to pay even though he has NO cash? He has NO job, so obviously he has no money, he can't make money appear out of thin air you know. If it bothers you, tell him to get a job or something. When you kiss and you don't feel a spark, that is because you're so stressed! You're thinking about breaking up, damn it, of course you're not going to have great emotions while you touch. But, PLEASE don't dump him! Give it a while, you only just got in a relationship. But, if he really is taking it too far, try this -<br>  <br>  1. Gather your feelings ahead of time. Think about what he wants to do that you believe is too fast and how you feel about it. Do you feel as if he doesn't respect you? Do you just feel uncomfortable? It may be helpful to write everything you feel about it. <br>  <br>  2. Organize your feelings into a few sentences to a paragraph. This is so you know what you are going to say to him before you say it. For example, if you feel uncomfortable with the speed of the relationship and think that he is disrespecting you, your paragraph might go something like this: "I care about you a lot, and you're a wonderful guy, but I don't like how fast we're moving. I just feel uncomfortable with it, and I would like to slow down. I hope you can respect me and agree to slow down too." You should write your own based on what you want to say and how you want to say it. <br>  <br>  3. Ask your boyfriend if you can talk in private. Don't talk to him in front of his friends, or else he might become embarrassed and mad. A good place to talk is at your house, though letting your parents listen in isn't a good idea; they might get the wrong idea and think your boyfriend doesn't care about you and just wants to get in your pants.<br>  <br>  4. Ease into the conversation and address the problem. This is when you tell him what you planned in step two. You will want to be direct but sweet and tactful. Holding his hand and looking into his eyes while talking to him will show him that you care but you are serious. Do not yell, but speak to him in a soft and serious voice. <br>  <br>  5. Allow discussion. Remember that a relationship is a two way street, and he has feelings as well. Allow discussion to decide upon an acceptable solution, but don't let him walk all over you. The point is to make sure your voice is heard too, not to let him do whatever he wants. Also be sure that your boundaries are clear.<br>  <br>  6. Do something fun afterwards. Once you've both come to a reasonable solution, go out and have fun. He might feel guilty because he didn't know you felt the way you did, or his ego may be bruised. Go to the movies, the mall, the park, or wherever you go to have fun and make him feel better. <br>  <br>  <br>  Tips - Don't be too confrontational; be direct but gentle. <br>  Let him know that you still care. <br>  Look into his eyes while speaking with him. <br>  Don't let him pressure you into saying okay. <br>  Don't be afraid of talking to someone you trust about this beforehand.|`|uk6fgHxMaa	tbh, i think you should wait for maybe a week or so but if youve already been feeling like this fira whilei think  itsbest for you to break up. <br>  and although you might still like him if hes being push whas the point?<br>  <br>  also long distance relationships probably wont work dont commit yourself if iyou dont want to tho. if you dont want to finish it jsut talk it over with him and tell him not to be so pushy and talk properly bout your future?#<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  can you do mine? <br>  <br>  : <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqNT1pT1PKTogLX0w9PuSpMgBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090227103721AASZ1ih">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>
kNYDHZqAaa	I think how old you are makes a big difference... if he is really young (early 20s), then give him some time before you give him an ultimatum. If he's in his late 20s or in his 30s, I'd find someone else, to be honest. Not saying he has to be ready to marry you ASAP after being together for 2 1/2 years, but by the time he's a full-fledged adult he should at least know if he wants to be married someday. You deserve to be with someone who is excited about the future with you, although I still think if he's really young you should give him some time and see where he's at when he's a bit older.|`|xKNjvVLXaa	not ready.???.how old are you?how old is he??<br>  <br>  well if he is like 21-23..then yeah...i think its early for marriage ...men should marry only when they turn 25<br>  <br>  all the best|`|Sm0rYAnCaa	Don't get into it!

qPuC39Wkaa	You should just tell him you agree with him and he should take all the time he needs.  Don't call him or anything.  He will soon wonder why you were so willing to agree with him.  He'll probably reconsider his suggestion about the whole "break" thing.  I know because it happen to me.  My ex told me I should move on with my life because he was going thru somethings and I told him ok.  I didn't call or anything.  He finally start calling me again now we are discussing potentially reconciling.  But I have to tell you, my feelings have changed a bit.  So you may or may not even want to get back together with him after your so called "break".  Hope this helps.

277efdce8c0ee4a061432d1c6596e76daa	8 to 9 months is quite a long time to be with someone and to all of a sudden become suspicious of their motives. I suppose you were seeing signs of kinks in the relationship, but things really triggered when he said he loves you.<br>  <br>  I've been in his shoes before and I think I know what went wrong. When he said he loves you, he pretty much gave up his power in the relationship, raised you on a pedestal of sorts, became mushy and possessive, but at the same time killed the things that made you attracted to him in the first place. Its weird the way it works, you want him to love you, and he does, but before he actually made the confession you were on his toes, chasing him and doing things that would keep the relationship alive, and by him keeping you in suspense about how he felt, he was making you chase him just a little, and it kept things in balance. Now he makes the move of commitment, and youre backing away because youre starting to feel a little suffocated. <br>  <br>  I don't think there's anything you can do at this stage. You could break down what youre feeling based on what hes doing, but that will only make him bitter or defensive rather than help him improve his game. And I'm sure it would be awkward to keep him as a friend because of the way the relationship was. It's up to you if you really want to save the relationship, which it appears as though you dont, so just move on.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, it might be that you'll always be attracted to player types. Thats totally natural. The good thing is that you know what signs to look for, and you can exit in case of emergency, like youre doing now. Good luck to you|`|4HoVVCenaa	He is human and made a mistake. You might consider giving him a break.

MTvjvVY0aa	It can mean a bunch of things.  If he comes from a home where his parents are divorced, and his family is split apart, it could mean that he just wants to create a strong family of his own, so that doesn't happen to him again.  He could also be saying it, because he is trying to impress you, and your family with his 'morals'.  It's hard to say, if I were you, I'd come right out and ask him, what his interest in marriage is.|`|B2HxSOGZaa	You need to first think, have you been dating long enough to even be thinking about marriage, or engagement? If you've only been together a few months, then step back and take a look at the whole picture.. what does he really want? Or if you've been together for over a year at least, then talking about engagement or marriage is appropriate only if you two are mature enough and old enough to start getting that serious. Marriage is for life, can you see yourself, 50 years from now with that same guy. If so, then I wish you both the best of luck. If not, then just think about it. :-)|`|YZddsudlaa	RUN!! B**ch RUN!|`|4bWUiIVdaa	It means run FAST!|`|sCr2iTczaa	Maybe it is very important to him. And maybe he feels he can talk about it wit you rather then his guy friends because guys don't really want to talk about sh*t like that.|`|YFXusnT1aa	Well he needs to slow down, because that is a huge step not one to be taken lightly.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	maybe he wants your input , are you ready to make a commitment , that maybe what he is trying to fine out,|`|hGWhzfFqaa	He wants to marry and have a family with you?

There are better guys out there.|`|0ucm3dmyaa	He has a girlfriend first of all, and him saying he would date you in a heart beat... bad idea. If you go over, just go to hang out with your friend, not him. It sounds a little shady if you ask me, plus think of how you would feel if you were in his girlfriends place and some other girl was in your place.|`|szvDqLo7aa	He's a dirt bag! If he starts dating you, do you really think he's going to treat you any better than he treats his present girl friend? Guys like that are total losers and very, very selfish. Skip him and find someone single, trust me, this guy isn't worth the trouble.|`|e4gsxv0jaa	Honestly I think he just has a tiny crush on you. I don't think he would leave his girlfriend for you, because if what he says is true he would of left her alright and gone out with you. Just be careful in the decisions you make.|`|eceLQUj5aa	He is going to use you to cheat on his girlfriend. He thinks you look good and clearly wants to be physical with you.

I dont think that you would like some girl going to your boyfriends house. I would say if everything doesnt work out with them then fall in. going to chill with your friend is just an excuse to get over there.|`|FtgBZUYNaa	Go round there but just talk, and only talk because if it goes further it will all backfire on you and he has a girlfriend. Don't start flirting with him, because he might get the wrong hint.|`|sxwIYJ0paa	i guess you could go over there and hang out, but if he tries anything, tell him you don't want to go there, not unless he ends things with the other girl.|`|J5vBQ5I0aa	you should get him to break up with his girlfriend first!, if he wants to date u he shud of already broke up with her becasue you cant trust him if he doesnt|`|OeQ32mWyaa	If he cheats on the other girl then he might do the same to you so....u get the picture.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I suggest you think this through and not go over to his house. If he’s inviting you over to his house you can bet that at the very least he thinks he’s going to get in your pants. Now this may be all fine and dandy to you, but you need to ask yourself how you would feel if your were in his girl friends shoes. Do you want this to happen to you?  He’s got a girl friend, butt out for now and just stay his friend.|`|AA10460376	If you go out with him, you remember that what you do to others will come back and bite you in the BUTT 7 times HARDER.....REMEMBER THIS.....DO NOT DATE HIM UNLESS HE TELLS YOU THAT HE IS NOT IN AN EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP......DON'T DO IT!......|`|a984cQjKaa	i think unless you want to be his little whore for the night, you should stay away. honestly, how romantic can he be if he's sweet-talking you while he is involved with someone else?   he can't be trusted, but if you insist on talking to him, tell him if he wants you he needs to lose the girlfriend.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  if it was just to hang out AS FRIENDS, with no chance of anything happening between the two of you, you wouldn't be on here asking if you should go or not.  i was born at night, but not last night.|`|xZI6noJiaa	he has a gf. but wants you to come over. so he wants to cheat on her with you... do you really want that type of guy?|`|YdjU4KqBaa	depends ... if you do not mind sleeping with him without any commitment and knowing the fact that he is cheating his gf with you , its completely fine .....after all its your life|`|ojiO3svoaa	no he has a girlfriend. SKANKY!
ab11c77db248f05b2e7090761918cc61aa	Because you don't know him that well and it is very intimate to be naked together.  Perhaps instead of jumping into the whole naked/sex thing, you guys should have a few dates and hang out...then you won't feel weird.  <br>  <br>  Don't do it unless you feel right about it.  Even if you feel like you already 'promised' something or whatever.  If you're not feeling right about it, don't do it.  He'll probably like you even more, in fact.|`|BKr3y30maa	Alot of women feel that way, it's completely normal. The problem is, now that you've teased him about giving him the *******, now he's going to want you to pay up.  You'll never get over being naked in front of him until you take the chance.|`|iqku0QOQaa	maybe you're not ready. also, if you are not in a relationship with him then it is not a good idea to have sex with him. it sounds like he is using you and you are falling for it. i would just take things slowly if you like him, or this could ruin it. x|`|a984cQjKaa	because obviously something is not right.  this is your mind's way of trying to keep you from doing something stupid.<br>  <br>  besides, do you really want to be known as the office hoover?|`|Un9CElCaaa	probably because u havent even gone a date with him yet and u are not comfortable with this|`|TPZZESeeaa	maybe because you have been working with him and it is weird to look at him in a different way?|`|7CF1WKjMaa	Oh i don't know...maybe because you never done this before and your scared of him rejecting your body....i bet you guys have only talked once or not even that. Good luck being a slut at work,,|`|sP98NDi5aa	Sometimes you need to be careful on what you say. You started it by saying you give great head, and he want to see. If you do screw him, be aware of the consequences. Awkwardness at work, the fact that a relationship started with sex rarely lasts, among may other repercussions. I'm not saying don't do it, just consider what can go wrong before you do.|`|IELqIdHuaa	You dont have a problem coming into this type of atmosphere and state that you want to give the man a *******...Why would you say your shy now? How old are you? Come on now dont you have any self worth for the question you just asked. If you let him know its ok for sex but you have a fear of being naked in front of him, then your merely setting yourself up for disaster. Learn to like who you are, and you dont have to get naked with anyone since you sound like its not a big deal to just hop into bed with anyone for a simple *******. Hope you wash your mouth out too.|`|syUGRutaaa	First of all, if you are shy taking your clothes off in front of him, then you should be shy of giving him a BJ.  <br>  <br>  I am thinking that you probably don't know him good enough to have sex with him or to take your clothes off in front of him.<br>  <br>  My advice is to get to know him better, maybe let him take you on a date and start with kissing. Then once you feel more comfortable then maybe move on to the more physical aspects of this relationship!<br>  <br>  I hope I helped... Don't rush into things!|`|ESkrlYmCaa	It's always weird to get naked the first time but when you get after the first time its gonna be something normal<br>  <br>  Trust me <br>  By the way he gave you a ******** so your not shy about that <br>  and be normal your not the first lady to have sex with a guy <br>  <br>  Only by counting the number of humans you know that people had sex way before you <br>  <br>  :D|`|0yaQQSwoaa	Does it feel weird? what about the thought of you giving the best bj's doesn't that feel weird to you? you thinking about sucking some penis doesn't make you uncomfortable? then I'm pretty sure talking your close off shouldn't matter to you especially since you would love to.. come on you kinda answered your own question, just don't think, do it, you've been their and done many men.|`|lzTOlaqiaa	I agree that you probably dont realize that youre not comfortable with him yet. I wouldnt make that step with him prior to going out because if later you guys decide to make it official, its problems! Trust me!|`|LijKVPUYaa	Because you have only ever known him as a colleague and in the office environment|`|FpKAPOe4aa	lol well I think before you have sex... you should go on a date make thingss more comftorable..<br>  <br>  and wait till night if your shy lights off while sex is the best<br>  <br>  well to me =D|`|4U3K1Elaaa	All i can say is...LIGHTS OFF! :)|`|CR8RVs4Kaa	of course you'd be shy. lights off ;)|`|whYPpRXRaa	uh maybe because ur a virgin|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Sounds pretty skanky to me...|`|goP5E0Kxaa	I think it's because it feels too easy .|`|AA10460376	Well, I can tell you that your self-esteem is very low for you too feel that you have to perform for him and not even know him that well....SO, maybe some small part of you feels that you are much more deserving that this and that you really feel that he should be the one pursuing you and not the other way around.........FIND YOUR WORTH SWEETIE and remember....YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL AND DESERVE BETTER....|`|sCr2iTczaa	Because you don't know him enough to get naked in front of him. I think at some point all girls get nervous about getting naked i used to get nervous to get naked in front of my ex but i really don'tunderstand why.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	maybe because you know you will not something serious with him you will just be a booty calll|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	after you see him.. your going to be busy anyway so it wont matter i would think ..
tvF86mRDaa	It does take a bit to look nice - maybe she was tired the other day, stressed or had a hard day! I think you sound like you suspect she was up to no good, so maybe you need to get that sorted and not worry what she was up to!<br>  <br>  I have days I cant be bothered to wear make up or make an effort so just be a bit more understanding of that!|`|sCr2iTczaa	Maybe because she felt that since you are her bf she doesn't really need to try that hard with you|`|ipqH3UcWaa	mood changes?|`|EEapXFJ2aa	why dont u call her up and ask HER about it?|`|0ucm3dmyaa	Maybe she doesn't want you to like her just for how she looks, or maybe she didn't feel like wearing make up... I do that sometimes. Try asking her if she does that a lot (not dressing up/wearing make up and then wearing make up not on a date). Don't make it seem like you want her to be all dressy every time she is around you just ask 'Oh wow, you look great today! How come you didn't wear that for our date (in a cute teasing way)? Though you still looked amazing that night!' Hopefully she will answer it seriously, just don't sound upset or pissed about it.|`|92n42vksaa	Maybe she was having a bad day when she met you on the date, but today she was having a good day?! Or she wasnt sure if she liked you before but now she knows you're worth the effort (if she knew you would see each other today).<br>  Or she had something going on today where it was appropriate to make an effort, like a job interview or something else.|`|Uj5kuzoJaa	Maybe she didn't realize that she needed to make the effort with you.If it bothers you then tell her that you would appreciate it if she got dolled up for you every once in a while. I do the same thing with my fiance. Unless we're going somewhere special, I don't get too dressed up. But some mornings for work, I just get the urge to feel pretty. It has nothing to do with trying to get people's attention, but more to do with me wanting that extra air of confidence. Maybe there's a new girl at work and she was feeling competitive. Don't be worried, it could be any of a thousand different reasons|`|KPNOQAP4aa	sometimes us girls feel like making more of an effort one way or another on random days.<br>  <br>  chances are it's not you! it's probablly just one of those days where it's harder to make an effort on her appearance! <br>  <br>  this is a good indication that she's comftorable around you to just be herself and not put on a show all the time...|`|xgJbxZgfaa	maybe she just felt like not looking like she does everyday, and wanted to glam it up a bit. compliment her!|`|va5reo7Taa	maybe she didnt feel lazy today!|`|oSFcmUoLaa	having an affair with the Bob round the corner|`|2LJzbwwuaa	She's having a good day?|`|Ej3u0MwDaa	Girls like dressing up randomly, maybe she just felt like looking really pretty that specific day. It doesn't mean anything. If you're still worried about it you can always confront her and if you want her to start dressing up for you as well you can always (and proceed with caution) hint it. <br>  Example: "damn babe you looked really good that other day"<br>  <br>  Girls appreciate it when a guy notices that they've made an effort and would do it more and more, for the most part.|`|gkZ03j6Taa	You should like her any way that she looks and i have a friend that did that with her boyfriend maybe its b/c she just want to be relaxed around you becasue she knows that you dont, or at least shouldnt, care wat she looks like as long as you like her|`|CR8RVs4Kaa	my ex girls usually fix themselves up everywhere except when they are with me.

a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	what u seek is that excitement phase u experience when u first meet a guy, but u know what it don't last, its just a physiological thing, its just lust. love is allot more than that special feeling u et when things are brand new, and exciting. and in a year or so this feeling you speak of will be gone too. because real love isn't all about lust. real love and i had to learn this the hard way, is when u have a good man, good provider, someone u can trust, someone u know will be there no matter what. just ask my ex what he thinks about lust today. he left me for lust, and for awhile it appeared that it was the real thing, but heard recently from an old friend that they did not turn out to be happy when it was all said and done, ex even attempted to locate me a few years after the divorce. leaving and divorcing will not guarantee u get happiness, doesn't even mean u will get a man as good as u have now. i know because i had to learn this the hard way. i too thought u had to feel it physically all the time and when u leave a sure thing for a maybe thing, the only one u destroy is you. that lust feeling doesn't last, its a thing that soon ends, and if by chance you get stuck with someone not even as good as what you want to leave now, your going to regret your life.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I agree with the answerer who said the grass isn't always greener on the other side - this is so true!  The life you have - is pretty much close to perfect.  You need to respect it and treasure it and not give up on it.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	You have two options; go to joint counseling to make sure of your feelings or talk to him and tell him how you feel, it is not fair to him to continue with things the way they are, he needs to be free to find someone who will love him.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	More than likely you are experiencing the ennui that comes with long term relationships.  You haven't given a good enough reason for a divorce.  Your situation, based on what you posted, sounds like a classic case of boredom.<br>  <br>  If nothing in your relationship has changed except your feelings then those feelings can be regained by behaving as you did when you were first dating and trying to win him.  You behave like that for a week or two and the old feelings usually start to come back.<br>  <br>  a couple of things for you to take into consideration:<br>  you are a mom of 2 kids while going to school full time and you could be tired and exhaustion will deplete you emotionally as well as physically.<br>  <br>  You don't say how old the youngest is but hormone imbalance could also be your issue.  Either from a pregnancy in the last 2 years or your body's needs could have changed and you may need a different prescription for your BC if you are on  a hormonal BC.  Or your thyroid could be acting up.  hormone imbalances are subtle and you can be perfectly healthy and never know that you have an issue.<br>  <br>  So before you chuck the marriage:  go to the doctor and have a complete physical to rule out hormone imbalance or disease.  And if everything checks out there then play a few tricks on your mind and work at recapturing what you think was lost.  Also talk to your man.  He knows there is something wrong and I'm sure he wants to fix it as well.  Don't argue with me about this.  Just do it.  It would be a much greater tragedy for you to throw away a perfectly good relationship because you had a case of the baby blues or LTR ennui or something else that could be fixed.  <br>  <br>  If, after making a real effort to get back what you are missing doesn't work, then you may need to consider that your relationship really has run it's course and you and your husband need to discuss what to do next.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Was there any particular event that caused your feeling for him to subside?  Maybe you can try to remember why you fell in love with him in the first place?  What you are going through must be very difficult.  Maybe if you read some self-help books you might get some insight into why you are lacking feelings of love for him.  Good luck!|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	My personal feeling is that expecting the intensity of your feelings to remain the same throughout many years of the relationship is setting yourself up for failure. The initial period of infatuation is like a "high", and it's unrealistic to think that you're just going to go through life feeling high. When you have a drink, you feel buzzed, but the buzz goes away, you don't expect to still be buzzed 24 hours later - right? If you want to get a buzz again, you need to have another drink. Similar situation with relationships, I think - in order to experience that "high" of infatuation all over again, you need to look for a new relationship. Problem is, every new relationship becomes old at one point or another. So, what are you gonna do? Just keep chasing the rainbow? Yes, the passionate honeymoon phase may be over for you guys; but you have the rest of your lives to grow closer and have fun together. You have to develop and nurture a deeper bond, a friendship that will bring enjoyment to both of you - and to your children - for years to come. When you say you care for him "deeply", and then in the same breath you state that you don't have "strong feelings" for him, you are contradicting yourself. Caring deeply for someone and loving someone ARE strong feelings. You have to refocus your attention away from longing for the "high" of infatuation, and onto these new feelings that you have developed for each other - precisely the deep love and caring that you mention in your question. <br>  <br>  This is not to say that you can't bring joy back into your sex life. Perhaps if you focus more on enjoying the other aspects of your relationship (companionship, parenthood, common interests), your feeling of guilt will fade, and you'll be able once again open yourself up to enjoying sexual experiences with your partner. There are ways to address the differences in your sexual needs and wants - communication is essential to healthy sex life - but (I think) the main problem is that you are not at peace with yourself, you feel guilty for being a "bad wife" or a "bad mother", and you are not enjoying your relationship overall just because it's not the same as it was in the beginning. You need to accept that every relationship evolves in its own way, and most of the time the intensity of the "love-at-first-sight" infatuation will be supplanted by (hopefully) a very close friendship. <br>  <br>  (Look up "passionate love" and "companionate love" to help you out.)|`|FBhjhjR0aa	wow! I can't believe you are being this un-grateful.... You don't appreciate much do you? Go ahead and leave him. I bet you that soon after you leave him you will end up regretting it for what ever reason. And you will want him to take you back, and the thing is he won't. He will either refuse to ever take you back because now he doesn't trust you and see's you as a flight risk or he will already have a new lady in his life, one that truly appreciates him and the man that he is. <br>  <br>  So yeah, go ahead and leave.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	You have gotten a whole lot of great advice so far. With anything that you might gain in a divorce something will be lost somewhere. It is a tough decision all the way around.<br>  <br>  I have been trying to be the one in a family of five to make everyone happy sacrificing my own for so long that I am getting so bitter towards everyone. I have for over 22 years been trying to turn that one corner where everything falls into place to no avail. Within the next couple of years when my youngest son turns eighteen, right or wrong, I am going to make a change to try to make myself happy and fully aware that I might fall flat on my face.|`|qFvHH6lUaa	I think you'd be making a mistake.  You reach a platuea in marriage and for most of us it isn't that we don't love the person anymore, it's just that the salad days are way over.  I don't mean to sound rude but maybe stress is making you disconnect.  Two kids and a degree is a lot for one person.  Are you super stressed?  Could a doctor help you?  Try doing something fun with just your husband if you can.  Go away for a weekend with no kids and no homework and maybe you could find that spark.  And if you don't want to have sex, plan it around your period.   ;)  And you could try talking to him.  Don't say you're not in love, just say you're afraid that things are starting to fizzle out and maybe you guys could work on it together.   Good luck.|`|OUVUU5xRaa	There are other options here besides just leaving him.  Try marriage counseling, try being honest with him, it sounds like you disconnected from one another emotionally.  Women need time spent with their husband.  Try reconnecting through regular date nights.  Divorce is not fun and it always brings out the worst in people.  I would seriously think long and hard before you contact a lawyer.|`|tIoeOgJ4aa	I think that that infatuation fades over time in all marriages.  The strongest and best marriages, I believe, are based on friendship more than anything else.  In 30 years, what do you want from your partner?  Companionship and conversation..that's all we can ask.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	you just have to tell him how you feel as soon as you can .. to get this out of your way .. to be happy.. but think a little bit more about your life ..|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	You are not alone, it happens a lot more you can imagine. But surprisingly it`s a decision we make, a choice we have. We decide whether we love to die or stop loving.<br>   <br>  "I have an amazing lifestyle and would be sacrificing so much by leaving,"<br>  Well not only yours, but you`re sacrificing your children as well. You will be taking their loving dad away (I don`t buy the idea of quantity and qualities values, both are important for a child), you`re sacrificing too their life style and some other values in life and that`s the main issue of all this,.<br>   After 6 years of marriage, you don`t expect having the same love sparks as in the beginning, people start thinking different..it`s not you and me anymore, it`s family..Divorce shouldn`t be an option,,,working in renewing, innovate, re-invent marriage should be. When we fall in love is because we wanted it, we made up fantasies about the other,,I believe it`s still there hidden in our minds..working in bringing it out not in  bringinig to an end is thinking in the whole family not just oneself...|`|EjyD1sXeaa	you will have the same, if not worse, problem with your next partner!<br>  <br>  grass is always greener isn't it?<br>  <br>  are you not satisfied?<br>  <br>  look at good points:<br>  good husband in all aspects<br>  buys you things<br>  don't have to work<br>  2 little children!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  no abuse or drunkenness<br>  <br>  look at you:<br>  dread being intimate<br>  can't control your feelings<br>  want to be in love again!!!!!<br>  selfish, unrealistic<br>  <br>  people like you are never happy or content with what they have,<br>  <br>  once you leave, your children will never ever ever be the same, believe me (i'm from a broken home)!!!!!<br>  relatives will not be the same towards you or the children<br>  <br>  working together through these times can make the world of difference and you'll look back in a few years time thinking how stupid you were to even contemplate ruining 3 lives<br>  <br>  communication is a vital foundation for any relationship to work, give your husband the respect he deserves and talk to him about your unreasonable feelings|`|TPhIWWniaa	I can only tell you that unfortunately marriage is not being "in love" & "happy" all of the time, there are ups and there are downs.  <br>  I've felt like I'm "out of love" with my husband at times and then a situation will arise and I fall in love with him all over again, or I just realize that I never was "out of love" with my husband at all (granted the feeling has never been for a year).<br>  <br>  I also think that you have stresses in your life that such a young couple such as yourselves really shouldn't have since marriages are harder in the beginning as you are two different people getting used to each other's different ways, you are working on your degree (that's very stressful) and you have kids (a huge stressor in young marriages to begin with).<br>  <br>  Only you can decide if you want to put the work and the effort in order to save your marriage but know that it is a lot of hard WORK & EFFORT, talk to him and perhaps get counseling; you guys should go on dates, ask him to do what he did when you first fell in love with him.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|bqkfu6Diaa	If there is nothing wrong on his end to cause you to feel this way, that means that you are the source of the problem. It doesn't mean you are a bad person. All it means is that the problem of not feeling in love is coming from you somehow. If that's the case, how do you know you won't have the same problem with the next guy? For all you know, you could fall in love with the next guy and end up just like you are now or even worse. Then you move on to the next and so on. All you would be doing is ruining people's lives in your never ending mission to find a certain kind of love that you fantasize about. Since you know that the problem is something within you, how about you see a professional to help you out. That way you will be able to find out what is going on. Who knows? Maybe your husband being a nice guy and good father isn't enough. Maybe you have some need that has been neglected which inspired you to lose interest the way you have. You may not know what is really going on until you spend some time with a psychiatrist. I strongly suggest doing that before turning your back on your family.|`|byBY2vpGaa	This could be the 7 yr itch a year early or it could due to the fact that you committed to this relationship at age 19.  Or maybe these are true feelings and you need to move on, it happens. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you have given this time and thought if it has been going on for a year.  Have you spoken to anyone about this either a professional or a friend/relative?  You need to explore these feelings.  Especially since you hav strong feelings about your physical relationship.<br>  <br>  I suggest be a trial separation.  After speaking with someone, talk to your husband and tell him how it is for better or for worse.  Agree to a specific time frame and be free from the boundaries of marriage for that time.  You need this for your own health because these are real feelings.  The worst thing to do would be to stay and suck it up, for you, your husband and your children.<br>  <br>  Do not feel selfish, you are doing this for everyone - not just for yourself.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|qut1Mze4aa	Go rent the movie Fireproof, it is very impactful!  Watch it with him or alone.  Tell him how you are feeling but be gentle.<br>  <br>  I dated a guy who sounds much like your husband for 18 months and I walked away, dated a couple of other people and and realized the grass isn't always greener.  All I did was compare them to my ex, he was stable and always there for me, I definately appreciated him more after being crapped on 3 times in a row.  <br>  <br>  Now we are trying things out again to see, we have talked a lot and understand each other more than we ever did.  I realized mistakes that I made, I spent a lot of time worrying about my needs and he actually didn't worry about mine enough but he gets it now.<br>  <br>  I would just be careful before walking out the door, this isn't a reason to stay at all but dating really can suck!  I am sure this has to do with the fact that you married young but you are lucky you have a guy that has a lot of good qualities.|`|wwB3csfYaa	I think you had an idea in your head that the feelings you first shared, like butterfly's when you haven't seem each other, the way a hug feels or the way it feel to be with someone new would last forever. It does go away because their touch becomes familiar. That does not mean you are not in love. I feel like you are really confused, that you are in fact in love with him. What you need to do is go away for a few days, you have lost yourself and your feeling like you don't know whats wrong with you. After your trip to see family/friend, you'll come home with a better since of who you are and where you stand with your hubby. By what you say, you are still in love, you just don't know that even when the "fluttery" feelings go away, you still love that somebody.|`|xGshAiXOaa	And you will tire of your next love and the one after that.  There aren't always bells and whistles.  You have let yourself fall out of love with him, and you can make yourself fall back in love with him.  Forget the past six years of familiarity, and remember all those things that you loved about him before you knew that sometimes he doesn't put his dirty clothes in the basket and sometimes he leaves the cap off the toothpaste, etc.|`|VAp5ICaBaa	At the end of the day you have to do what is right for you and your children and staying with their father whom you are not in love with will hurt them in the long run. You will probably grow to resent him and that is not good for anyone. Talk to him and tell him how you are feeling nothing is going to get better with out simple communication. Good Luck I hope it all works out for you.|`|AA11356977	Everyone want passion but the truth is it dies down no matter who you are with. It helps us see if we have more in commmon that just sex.

Its a risk you may take but be dissapointed in when you cant find a guy you actually like and respect.|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	Could there be a biological cause? A doctor could help.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I think some people lose that initial sparrk they get. Relationships change. I think the media makes people think that romantic love persists forever after marriage, but that just doesn't seem to happen for everyone.<br>  <br>  I'd see a therapist who might be able to help you determine the cause of your problem.|`|E7tHE2J4aa	Please don't leave you husband!

You would have to keep leaving your current relationship for a new one, every so many years, in order to attain that feeling. People need to go into a marriage understanding that the honeymoon is not forever. That strong feeling is mainly lust and after a while it dies down into comfort. What ever compares to the first kiss, the first touch or the first act of intimacy? That is why all these "firsts" are so fondly remembered. If I were you I would try to figure out were along the lines your feelings changed and work from there. Try doing things a little differently with your husband, spice things up. If this fails then tell him how you are feeling maybe the two of you can work together to get back what you lost. Remember that added stress always puts a damper on relationships too.|`|2DNH6maiaa	It is so sad that you feel that way! The fact of the matter is the grass may seem greener on the other side but once you leave your husband for the "tingles" of being in love you will find out that it will fade fast. It doesn't sound like you are out of love but out of lust. And let me tell you the dating world sucks! And many of us single woman would be grateful to have what you have and once you leave trust me that your husband will find another and she will probably appreciate just having a good man! Is it worth breaking up your stable family to get laid? I think you should get some counceling before ending your marriage. When you said your vows did it include you will be wed until you just lose interest? That is the problem with marriage now days.... people are never satisfied and always want more!|`|3jFghYkRaa	When i was 15 my english teacher told my class that there is no such thing as true love. (and no, his marriage had not just broken down, in fact he had been happily married for nearly 50 years.) Naturally, none of us wanted to hear this at the time, but now i think he's right. He told us that love comes in many different forms, and the one ideal for marriage is a long-term attachment for someone, but you have to be willing to work at that and give up other things that you want. You have to accept that it is impossible to love someone as strongly as you did when you first met forever. On the other hand you are still young, and there is nothing wrong with wanting to be happy. You might find exactly what you are looking for. Just be careful that you don't throw away what you have because you are bored of it. You might find in fifteen years time you want it back. If you really want a divorce, then get one, but i would see if there's anyway you can sort this out first.|`|F6dApOJtaa	You need to sit down and think really hard what you want. This person obviously loves you. He doesn't make you work, he buys you things, he is a good provider to your family. You should go see a doctor to see if you are suffering from depression. Why is it that when things are not going good in a marriage, the first thing they want to do is divorce? You married for better or for worst, not for better or until I don't want him anymore.

I fancied him like crazy and kept pranking calling him just to hear his voice and try to determine where he was. <br>  <br>  I was getting mixed messages from him, so I decided to pretend to be someone else by texting him. I pretended to be my older sister and I text him just saying "hi, whose number is this as it's in my phone etc". After he replied I said "this is sonya, (my name)'s sister." After a brief conversation 'sonya' (aka me!) started asking why he broke up with me and how he felt about it. 'Sonya' told him that I had never been so happy when I was with him and if he would ask me back out again. <br>  <br>  It was quite crazy pretending to be someone else, and I didn't really get much info from him in the end! <br>  <br>  Anyway, we have now been together for 5 years and I only just told him it was me. He's never going to let me live it down!|`|7jM9Ghchaa	not me no need?|`|XI7JLX6gaa	lol my friend and i are going to her bf;s school to and follow him around to see if hes seeing any one. lols<br>  its guna be funny cause we guna rent a car for a day wear shades lol. and the girl above is right. no matter how terrifc you r relationship is u cant trust 100%. ppl who say oh ntn cus i trust him are just being stuck up. cmon every1 has doubts bout one another.|`|AA11346465	I trust my partner, i don't check up on him EVER! It's not much of a relationship if you feel you have to go to extremes to check what your partner is doing.|`|bMuwuAVOaa	I have no need for such suspicion or action. My husband and I trust each other and have faith in one another.|`|WUzRFv9Aaa	Check his phone messages and wallet for receipts|`|rKaUdhLUaa	When my ex started acting suspicious I checked his texts and e-mails and found he had been cheating on my for 6 months and that he even flew the other girl up to our apartment when I had to go to FL because my mother was in the hospital.<br>  I don't have to check on my current BF, he's very up front about what he's doing and who his friends are.|`|tXSPCtHCaa	You know, me and my boyfriend have a terrific relationship, open communication, great S*x life, etc....been together 6 years. About a year ago I randomly for no reason signed up on his myspace and caught him trying to "talk" to someone (who wound up to be non existant).  I confronted him and his face turned white and apologized profusely for 3 days. We talked about it for every day for 3 days. I was very close to leaving him. ( i don't put up with any of that, p*rn is one thing, trying to initiate contact with a specific person is another). So just goes to show you that you should never trust anyone %100 even if you have the best relationship in the world.|`|BfgB6l8Qaa	I've signed on his account before to look at stuff. I know it's bad but i needed to know. I then spoke to him about it and we cleared things up. I don't think i would do it again though, I'd just ask him rather than invade his privacy :)|`|9Zx6uB34aa	i have made up a fake screen name found out his password on facebook and myspace and pretended to b someone else on AIM. well he was waiting for another girl at her locker.|`|MUqfdj63aa	just take the cell phone...not so much

But you should know that your not alone out their. A lot of people feel alone, some are just to scared to admit it. And others, well they have just gotten used to it. I have pretty much gotten used to it, but it is nice to know that other feel the same way sometimes.|`|9BbV2xqIaa	yeah. I mean, my roommate is a pretty cool person, but other than her I really make very little human contact unless I have lab that day. so basically my only real human conversation that lasts any length of time is online with my best contacts. and that is awesome, they make me feel less lonely and help me get through large chunks of my time.|`|gILMYLTuaa	Ha that you would post something like that. Way to care about the community cool stuff.
AA11460234	Nope.<br>  <br>  As long as she wouldn't be offended if I chose not to take it.

9624d1b569ca710536d56a309ae51f7aaa	Just dress normal and try not to over do it.. you'll traumatize the poor kid!<br>  Boys that age are more about playing sports or Video games. While Girls may be on his mind occasionally ... he just is not there yet.<br>  He would probably be more interested in you if you were on his baseball team or wanted to play outside.
CR8RVs4Kaa	Well if he likes you and dumps his current girl for you and she finds out, you guys made have round 2. But just come around and talk to him and if he likes you he will give signals. Ask him how he's doing and how he has been. Just normal conversation. myspace? why dont you do that and then email me and ill help you from there<br>  <br>  jeremybiagas@gmail.com|`|6Xv6D4h6aa	guys most likely will say yes if u ask them out especially if they had a crush on u and u got prettier. If he stares then he likes u. im sure he likes u and he will say yes if u just ask him out. hope this helps!!!|`|ik9hP6FBaa	why dont you try to talk to him? try to catch up and after a certain time has passed confront him and tell him that you still like him and see what he feels about you.|`|Y8dXwds5aa	if he is dating someone there little you can do but just start being his friend again then tell him that you like him|`|Ej3u0MwDaa	You'll never go wrong with just talking to him. If things don't pan out the way you wanted then at least you made and attempt and can continue your life. Make sure you don't turn into a booty call though!!|`|3Pe8XYbUaa	Just take a leap and ask him out you won't know until you ask if he is interested or not.|`|GUqMGh9raa	go and tell him every thing you feel,<br>  i don't know what he will answer but at lest try.|`|cHBcR0Chaa	Go talk to him. Be direct and straight to the point, tell him how you feel. Ask him how he feels. Just talk, its the only and best way to get him. Hints don't work, just talk.|`|whYPpRXRaa	ok if u want this guy u say this" I want to suck your pingas" and then do it and he will be like **** YA and go out with you I GUARANTEE IT.

All surgeries carry some risk. Let your body age naturally and don't alter it in ways that limit your choices.|`|QilfSBfsaa	Have your son ever asked for a younger brother or sister, I know most kids do not like to have sibling so they would be the soul of the family.<br>  Ask your partner why he does not want another child? Financial problem?

DW2u5HODaa	Yes, we did the same thing. It's whatever YOU want!<br>  <br>  My engagement ring will also serve a wedding band. It has diamonds around the band so another band would be too much.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	Of course!!  I got my fiancee a tungsten metal ring when we were just dating and he thought many times to use it as his wedding band.  :)|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	I'm a woman, and I wear my engagement ring as my wedding ring.  I don't see why your husband couldn't.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	typically men don't wear engagement rings even if they're going to wear a wedding band.  and not all men wear wedding bands, although more do now than in the past.  but if you do get him an engagement ring, i think certainly he could use it as his wedding band.  just give it to your maid of honor before the wedding.|`|f4RnGIeSaa	For men usually they either don't have an engagement ring at all, only the wedding band, or they are one and the same.<br>  <br>  Honestly it is up to the individuals, there are not set rules.|`|29I8PWrxaa	What do you mean?  You got him an engagement ring?  Sorry I'm a bit confused.  If you got him a band, I would save it for the wedding as men don't traditionally wear engagement rings.
n7T2AJ0Yaa	*drools* enough said lol|`|PoBIyZ27aa	Your menu sounds great! It would be way too much work to give the guests options on everything, so I think you're doing the right thing by giving an entree choice. It sounds like it will be a very good reception!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	yes, usually the meal choice is only for the entree.  you're having 2 desserts?  awesome!  the salad sounds good too.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I think it sounds delicious!!<br>  <br>  My wedding menu, my guests have NO choice!!  I'm not trying to be rude, but it makes things so complicated.<br>  <br>  And, whenever you are at weddings, your food is taken away for the next course so quickly...<br>  <br>  Anyway, I think your menu is wonderful...  I'm glad I'm on lunch right now :)|`|hkwBR1moaa	A WHOLE LOT BETTER then the previous askers.  Although, I'm picky and wouldn't eat either entree (I don't like steak and I hate mushrooms) everything else sounds delicious.  Don't stress, you have the right idea about a wedding dinner.  Good Luck, it'll be lovely!|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	oh yum!  the portobello penne sold me.  can i come to your wedding? lol<br>  <br>    seriously though, it all looks delicious.|`|4POGapREaa	Sounds fabulous!  I like every single thing on your menu.|`|76nTvO4iaa	I think it sounds wonderful!<br>  <br>  May I come?<br>  <br>  I don't mind if I'm a Z-lister  ;-)|`|FplTPoAyaa	It sounds wonderful, however, I noticed that your salads will have walnuts.  Many people are allergic to nuts, and if ingested, they can be deadly.  You may want to make the nuts an option, or find out ahead of time if any guests have an allergy, and prepare salads for them without the nuts.  Also, make sure the caterer doesn't just "take off" the nuts...if the nuts have been on the salad at all, then their oil is on the greens.  Sorry...just speaking from experience.  You don't want a sick guest taken away in an ambulance to ruin your big day.  the rest of the menu sounds great ! Have a beautiful wedding !|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Just watch out for the nuts in the salad and green beans, some people are deathly allergic to tree nuts. My future SiL can't even eat things cooked in the same oven or pot as nuts, we have to make sure all of her foods are completely nut-free. That's the only thing that sticks out to me as a potential red flag. Also, maybe include some fresh fruit for dessert as an option for the diabetic guests or guests on diets. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11380378	It seems to me that you should offer another entree. Some people do not eat red meat and they are not vegetarian.<br>  <br>  I attended a weding a couple of years back and the menu was similar to yours and the food was rather skimpy. Everyone was hungry.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  EDIT TO ADD: I do not understand. Filet mignon WITH chicken mixed together? If so, then I guess it would be fine.|`|ODYrypwaaa	Awesome!  Can I come?  Are you serving Coffee with dessert? Also I may suggest instead of salad for a appetizer do a finger food.  Make the salad another side dish.  Just a suggest.  But sounds great!|`|IWWZdZRpaa	I think it looks awesome.  You don't have to provide choices but I think having a vegetarian alternative is a good idea.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Your menu sounds delicious. The salad doesn't sound all that appetizing personally but the rest of it sounds yummy.|`|btNUf7rcaa	I think its great. Just enough and delicious!|`|q8eue7CRaa	I'd be totally happy with it!!
uBssj3Znaa	I am sure that he just wants to spend some time with his guy friends. I wouldn't take offense to it, and in fact, if I were you, I would take this opportunity to hang out with some of your friends.|`|DiBAWKPsaa	well it sounds like he loves you loads, and after a year or so he is starting to realise how much he misses his friends. Of course he doesn't regret spending time with you! He just wants to see his friends, and you are still number 1 to him :-) x|`|ff545BLyaa	Just let him go out and have guys night....  Guys night is like Essential to us we need our guy time to be well idiot guys.  I can not explain it but that's just how it is and no girls allowed, unless your best friend is a girl then its okay.  I am 19 too.  If you do not let him have his guy time then he will leave you...|`|262016589c2b056459386b15672dd2c8aa	Just give him some time and see what happens.  Don't feel hurt unless he decides to move on.  Maybe he really does just want to see his friends more.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	same thing happened to me. just let him be with his friends, it is better that he tells you than him sneaking around.|`|d89416ed0e27a36978e0ba1cb1b5608eaa	You've just answered your own question - he gave up practically everything for you - even spending time with his friends, who should always come before a girl. <br>  He's just realised that he needs his friends as well as you. You may be important to him, but sometimes guys just to get together with their buddies, watch a game and drink beer, just like you go out with the girls. He's only 19 and he doesn't want to regret not making the most of his last teenage year - there are only certain things you can get away with when you're young! <br>  <br>  If you spend every waking minute with each other - you'll both go stir crazy. Sometimes its nice to get away a couple of nights a week. Keeps you both grounded and sane. There are certain things you can talk to your friends about that you can't talk to your partner about. <br>  <br>  Riley.|`|JJCSEe3Taa	It's essential for him to spend time with his mates as well. He needs to go out and do stuff with his friends as well as with you. Not to worry, providing he spends time for you and he also has the same amount of affection for you then there is no harm.|`|YdjU4KqBaa	It just means that he wants to have a life outside this relationship which is very normal .. do not try to analyze everything he says... as long as he is happy with you and loves you there is no harm in this|`|tPRRUs4Jaa	it's pretty obvious that he just wants time with him friends and he still loves you. i don't understand why you'd be hurt by that. he just wants guy time, that's all. no big deal. so let him have it.|`|I5SypMlsaa	****** slap him and tell him that he is a moron since you never were against him spending time with his friends... and if he wants time apart so be it... he will come back trust me, as long as you are doing the breaking up|`|eceLQUj5aa	It means he misses his friends. You two are 19 you should really spend more time with both of your friends. There is no reason to see the person you are dating every single night.|`|a984cQjKaa	he just wants to spend time with his friends.  i wouldn't worry about it unless he starts ditching you to hang out with them all the time.|`|ojiO3svoaa	let him go and do not be hurt. go hang out with your friends|`|37M3dkkRaa	he's not saying he doesnt want time with you anymore, he's just saying he wants time with his friends, too. and if he has always spent more time with you than them, maybe it wouldn't hurt him to have a break and for you to have one too. he just wants to be with his friends before everyone gets older and more mature and they finally decide they don't need each other anymore.|`|9BsyKN9haa	It has nothing to do with you! he obviously loves you. If you start asking these dumb questions and making drama for NOTHING then you will drive him away. Sorry but its not all about you! maybe you can hang out with some of your friends when he goes out with his friends.|`|sxwIYJ0paa	it sounds like you guys are together TOO much. i think it's time for HIM to be with HIS boys, and YOU to be with YOUR girls. learn to have some fun when you're away from each other. life your life to the fullest, ya know?|`|H3h4j4aKaa	he means exactly what he said <br>   he wants to spend more time with his friends <br>  thats it no more no less don't read too much into it your going to drive yourself crazy take this opportunity to hang out with some of your girl friends have some fun too!|`|eCLjOrFBaa	No he just doesn't want to neglect his friend your reading way to much into it. I suggest on the nights he wants to go spend time with his friends you go have a girls night out.|`|fxCDo5Xtaa	if  this  is  the  only  problem  in  your  life  then   u   should  be the  happiest  little  idiot  in the  world  .  suck  his  dick  more  and  he  will  never  want to   see his  friends  again|`|TeQ4RwlRaa	after awhile you should give other a little more space<br>  (and it's 20 months already)<br>  give him and yourself time to miss each other|`|94C2U5FLaa	quit being to protective of him. if he wants to chill with his friends... LET HIM! he has to have guy friends at his age! let him chill every now and then with some guys|`|hqtS7bVEaa	This means that he wants to seperate for a while which means he wants to break up.|`|gL5jy3Sqaa	U better let him hang with the bros...otherwise he will break up with you! Just being honest!! My friend did the same thing with his girl!|`|UPhngg5Waa	Just let him out and have a life. You go get one too.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	he said he love's you . said and doing are 2 different things there , let him go and go on with your life.|`|WVSpTxuCaa	i dont wanna be mean but he probobly got bored of u but dont take my word 4 it thats just the way it sounds but maybe hes just going thru alot right now?|`|AA11812232	You spent a lot of time together, way too much time together. His friends told him this and he opted to spend time with you instead. The honeymoon period is over now. He has opted now to listen to his friends advise and spend more time with them. You have to bite the bullet and get over your insecurities. Let him go with his friends and don't make any fuss about it. Treat each other like adults and spend time apart to discover who each of you are. Don't develop such an unhealthy attachment to him. If he wants only you he will come home and show you that he does.Don't come across as a desperate female to him or his friends ever!|`|J5vBQ5I0aa	look all boys are like this, they all love being with their friends, he just means he wants to have a laugh with them, it wont be any offence to you. there all the same, always saying they need space, or time with friends its like they cant have both at once!. but just let him have time with his friends, he just wants his social life back, which does not mean he wants rid of you, guys are just guys, just try not to worry, and if your worried that much then just talk to him about it :) hope things work out!|`|LcOPL8gCaa	Hello =]<br>  Umm It just sounds like he misses his friends, or they are telling him to get out and see the world again. Not that he can't with you, but they want to hang out with him too. See i'm like how your boyfriend is acting, my fiance and I are going through the same thing. He's in the army and always busy. I have all this time & nothing to do with it, so i hang out with my mates. Who are guys & girls. The guys are like my brother & the girls are almost sisters lol. And I wanna hang out with my man, but he's busy. I know he loves me & He knows i love him. But sometimes you just have to be away from each other, and have fun by your self's. You can't just give up your life for him. and he can't do the same. My man has been through so much with me, and its been a hell of a ride. But you can't just keep him to your self, there is so much you guys could do with friends! Go on a trip with your friends, rent a huge car or a motor home and go camping. Spend quality time together, but also with your pals. <br>  <br>   If you don't let him have his time too, he might pull away from you & you don't want that.<br>  <br>  Just remember you have a lot of time you can spend with him & others.<br>  <br>  Good luck & best wishes|`|cM9DBbgnaa	to be honest he wants to break up with you he is finding a reason for you to hate him and for you to leave him.. apparently the guy is just bored of you. In the guys mind we tend to get bored at something that we have for a long period of time its like eating pizza for breakfast lunch and dinner everyday... i know this from experience i am like that as well i just get bored and try to find a rationale to get away from her i do not like being this way but its just how things are.

AA11518532	I like the getaway idea… also, if you’re having a honeymoon, I would consider bringing something meaningful from where you are going, this will show that you were also thinking of them after the wedding has passed.|`|AA11380378	My husband's parents contributed 10k for our wedding, and a lot of work that they put in to it; so we went out of our way to give them a very nice gift.<br>  <br>  We gave my MIL a very nice, solid gold bracelet. The  gold bracaret had starfishm which was the theme of the wedding.<br>  <br>  His father got a silver scotish watch engraved with his initals. It was a true work of art.<br>  <br>  The presents werer $500, but it was the least that we could do!<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|ODYrypwaaa	After the wedding, go to shutterfly and make them a special book of photos of your wedding.  Pictures of them with you or other special people who were there.  Some times there are so many pictures it can be overwhelming.  Make a small book of photos that will mean more to Just them.|`|xuiSfzgraa	My parents have helped out A LOT also, so I am planning on getting them a GC to a resort a few hours away from where we live for a weekend away....I figured they might need some relaxation after the wedding also!
aZ1ZxTNvaa	you shuld just give her space for a lil bit <br>  but not to much<br>  bec she will think u don't care<br>  but maybe that would be a good idea?<br>  try sending her something<br>  and be extra nice<br>  just give it time<br>  it will all work out in the end|`|XCXd3nVTaa	I think it will help to take a look at the length and quality of your current relationship. Have you two been seeing each other for a while? Have you noticed a change in the quality of time that you two spend together? Have there been any significant changes in either of your lives? <br>  <br>  Sometimes all a girl really needs is some space to clear her mind and get a better idea of who she is and where she is headed. When someone is juggling a few things in their lives sometimes the best thing to do is to take a moment to step back and survey the situation. <br>  <br>  Right now I'm in long-term (we've been together for 7 years) relationship and sometimes I need to step back and take a breather. This in no way means that I love my boyfriend any less, it just means that I need to take care of myself before I can take care of him. <br>  <br>  You mentioned that you were about to end it yourself. Was it in reaction to her decision or was it something that you were thinking before she said anything? If that is the case perhaps it is best for both of you to step back and figure out what you want to do. <br>  <br>  Sometimes breaking up is the best thing to ever happen to someone. It gives you a chance to get out there and discover the person who is right for who you are. I know that's how it was for me!|`|T4Yc4BQ7aa	My boyfriend moves way to fast within the 3rd month of dating he gave me his class ring he started talking about moving in together and planning things years from now and sometime that can be cool but in his mind he felt like we have been going out for years but in fact we've been going out for 4 months now so I'm not even close to thinking about getting married and moving in. He was moving to fast. Maybe that's what your girlfriend feels she just wants to live in the moment of being girlfriend and boyfriend for now. <br>  <br>  You can always ask her what she means too.<br>  <br>  Please don't listen to ANYONE who says having sex it will make it all better because "research indicates that once an uncommitted couple gets involved in sexual intercourse, the relastionship usually begains to end."|`|tXSPCtHCaa	hmmm.....thats a tough one without knowing all the details.  How long have you been together? has there been a significant event recently between you two? <br>  <br>  I tend to think when someone wants "space", that usually means they don't want you to take the relationship so seriously, and are trying to distance themselves from you for some reason.

You still love this man, so dont try to fall for someone else. You will only be transferring your feelings, and you still have some heavy baggage.  If you go on a date, make sure the guy knows you just want to be friends right now.

In every meeting sit alone for  at least half an hour with him & other family members must be at least 15 feet away & not staring at both of you. Discuss & explore till you're fully convinced. If he is not suitable for you, tell your parents clearly that you are refusing this alliance. After marriage parents go to the background.

You're already 27 so it's not like 4 years difference will be frowned upon. But also you have to consider yourself for a moment.  Is this where you want to spend the rest of your life?  How much do you like him?  Also speaking of your age 27 is still prime and ripe to find another guy.  Maybe your just not feeling this one guy at the moment.  Then get out before your happily married but unhappy in your marriage.  But most of all just follow your heart, think it over first and most of all don't rush maybe he is the guy for you and you just need a little more time to see what's in front of you.  Be patient but think things through till the end.  I hope this helps.

Another suggestion is to play vendors against each other. It's not as nasty as it sounds. Just look at different vendors and if you find someone you like,  but that might be a little more than you want to spend, just give them the old line "This other vendor will give me the same thing for less. Can you match that?" <br>  For the dress go to a boutique, as opposed to a large national store. They have new dresses that are just as nice but cost a lot less. <br>  You can have someone make the cake, or pay for someone to take a lesson at a local craft store. It's really not as scary as it seems. <br>  Finally, I know it sounds crazy but ordering your flowers online is a BIG money saver. To give you an example, my florist quoted me $85 for a bouquet of 7 calla lilies for my bridesmaids. I then went to a local flower wholesaler and found a bunch of 10 for $45. I went online and found bunches of 10 for $20!!! Just make sure to check out any vendor you use.

No one can really say for sure what the common age people lose their virginity at, and you can't say teens because some people never have sex until they're married, which could be in their 20's or 30's.<br>  Don't have sex unless you're in a long-term, serious relationship, where you love each other, you completely understand everything about sex, and you have back-up plans if you get pregnant/an STI, and get check-ups for STI's beforehand if you can.<br>  A good choice that keeps you safe is to not have sex until you're married. Sex is a huge decision where you sacrifice yourself for another person, and completely give yourself to them, making you vulnerable, but showing you trust and love them so much that you would just give yourself completely to them.<br>  Your virginity is a special thing too - in almost all cases it's painful and you can bleed after losing it. Going through this pain for your husband/long-term partner shows you're willing to sacrifice yourself for them even more, and you go through the pain just for them.<br>  <br>  Don't ever have sex just because your partner wants to for pleasure. If you're a virgin, you can sometimes be naive but it can hurt more than you think, and you won't feel any pleasure for a while. Then when your partner at the time leaves you after taking your virginity away and using you, you'll be really hurt.<br>  It takes courage and trust to completely give yourself to someone. It takes selflessness and love to go through the pain and to sacrifice yourself for your partner. So, don't do it until you're in a long term relationship that's serious, engaged, or married. Don't do it until you understand everything that could happen and have back up plans and are completely prepared, because you could end up regretting it.<br>  <br>  I lost my virginity at a young age to my partner who was a virgin too, and I'm still with him now. He proposed to me before we had sex, and I've never regretted it. Love, trust, understanding, prepare. Make sure YOU are ready. Do it only because YOU want to. =]|`|oeXnhiPWaa	It really depends..I hope. I'm 15 and still a virgin, and I don't plan to loose it until after I'm 16,,,maybe even 17.

We were supposed to be have been brought up making healthy choices for ourselves so that we could prosper in what we reap.  Bringing your mother into the house was not a healthy choice but it wasn't forced on you either.

If he were an older child (as in already in school) and you were just coming into his life then it would be more appropriate for you to take a back seat to dad and dad should take the lead then.  The main thing is that you and his dad are in accord as to what happens in YOUR home.<br>  <br>  You can't worry about what happens when he's with his mom and how she disciplines him.<br>  <br>  You can only control your own environment.  So stand firm on your home rules.  Kids learn fast that there are different rules in different places and what their limitations are.  As long as you are consistent in your home as to what is expected, he shouldn't feel out of sorts for too long after returning to his dad's house.  You just emphasize that there are different rules for different places and that he learn to behave accordingly.  (rules at church are different from rules at home,  rules for grandma's are different than at home, rules for the library are different than at home, rules for school are different than at home, etc.  you get the idea)|`|AA10461616	Your guy has given you his 100% support and is saying he trusts you to act, including discipline, just as a mother would.  You say he actually prefers it.  So, that is something you shouldn't even be questioning- be thankful for having a great guy.  <br>  <br>  The second part of your question I understand only too well, only it was a worse situation than you have.  My husband's ex did drugs, shoplifted, etc. along with having very low morals and values, if any and letting child act totally out of control.  That was before we got married.  There was no way the child, a 5 year old girl when we met, was going to not resent me for being just the opposite of her mother.  I had to tell him that he needed to get full custody (which he could have with the drugs etc.) or I couldn't deal with her in our lives.  Due to his job, he only had visitation and weekends.  There is no way you can tell a child what she is doing is wrong when her own mother does it.  I saw a nightmare ahead.  How would we tell her stealing, drugs were wrong, or actually what a parent has to do- INSTILL in her very being those things are wrong when her mother did them?  And do all that on weekends and a few days a year.  We couldn't so we married and he saw her until she was totally out of control.  By the time she was maybe 11 or 12 she was stealing.  We had hoped when she got older it would be easier to approach that what her mom was doing wasn't our business but that it was still wrong.  We found that impossible to do, so sadly, thanks to her mom, she hasn't been in our lives.  Of course her family has said that is all my fault, forgetting that drugs, alcohol and milking the welfare system by crooked means like her mother does is no way to raise a child.  So, I wish you luck because trying and failing was more than we could bear.  He kept saying she was not the child he had been with and he couldn't control her tantrums/ acting out once her mom was the main influence.  It is extra sad as I had a lot to offer in the way of being a mom or even just her friend, as I often worked with troubled teens in the course of my job.  Plus, he was a great dad.  Perhaps your guy and she could talk about what THEY want the rules and discipline to be when the child is with them both, then, since you have his blessing half the hurdle is over for when they are with the two of you.  But if the mom is like my husband's ex, she only put herself first and used the child like a pawn.

Second of all, you are a constant in his life from a very young age.  It isn't like you are stepping in to the situation with a 17 year old step-child and then telling a 17 year old what to do.  This is a 4 year old who will respect your authority automatically because that's all he knows.<br>  <br>  Your fiance has given you the authority to set and enforce rules and boundaries in your home.  If you were a day care provider for children who were unrelated to you, would you have any hesitation for enforcing behavior rules at your daycare...regardless of the child's rules at home?  No you wouldn't.  So, lose the hesitancy.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter if the ex has a different set of rules at her house. When the rules are challenged because "at mom's house we can do this." The answer is "you aren't at mom's house right now. At this house, we do X, Y and Z."  No value. Just a statement of fact.<br>  <br>  Children will test boundaries. They also feel safer knowing that there are boundaries.  They will act in accordance of the expectations of the people who are around them.<br>  <br>  No matter what, at your home, you and your fiance have to provide a unified parenting front. Even if your fiance disagrees with a punishment, he needs to support you to the child...even if privately he is telling you that you went too far and asking you to modify the punishment.  This disagreement should not be known to the child. I wouldn't spank the child, but I would give him time-outs and remove privileges.<br>  <br>  I acquired my bonus daughters when they were 16, 19 and 21.  In my situation, I take on more of the role as an aunt/mentor than a mom.  If they're back-talking or being disrespectful, I might make a comment. We have conversations. LOL.  But I do not punish them because of their ages when I came into the picture. <br>  <br>  I understand where  you are coming from completely. It is a challenging road to navigate. You're doing good!<br>  <br>  BTW, my husband's ex is more of a friend than a mom.  My husband is strict.  Shortly after the divorce, the girls really challenged the rules because they were used to their mom undermining any rules or punishments.  It took about 6 months of them trying unsuccessfully to get their mom to override the rules in their dad's house, but they quickly adapted.  To the point that the middle daughter spent her senior year in hs - sophomore year in college living 100% with him/us.  The youngest daughter is a senior in hs and lives with us over 60% of the time.  She has been at our house since Thanksgiving and doesn't seem to be showing any inclination to go back to her mom's house.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Take your cues from Dad.  You are acting under his authority as a parent and he is responsible for how his children are cared for and disciplined while they are in his home and in his custody.  If he wants you to step in and be a Mom figure and you are comfortable in that role, I don't see a problem.  However, if physical punishment of any kind, even a swat, is part of the discipline process, Dad should do that part himself.  He has a legal privilege to do so that may not apply to you in most states.|`|pOTigVYPaa	Since you are the major care giver during the day while your boyfriend is at work, you do need to establish order and see that rules are followed.  You are wise to allow the child's mother to do the dicipline and parenting when you are together.  The child will soon learn that when he's with you and your  boyfriend that he will be expected to carry on a certain way, and when back with his mother, he can behave another way.  You deserve an applause for stepping up to the plate. You sound like a great lady and your boyfriend should be so proud of you!|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	I think the way you are handling it seems reasonable. He should know that just because he can get away with naughty behavior at Mom's doesn't mean it will be tolerated by you or Dad. He is in your home and I think it is fine for you both to stand up and correct him. It shows him that you are a team and that you both care about him very much but that neither one of you will allow disrespect in your home.|`|2DNH6maiaa	First of all I commend you for taking on such a role! From the sounds of it you are already doing a wonderful job. And I think the dad is right when he says for you to continue playing your role and working together as a unit. Children will test parents and the most important thing is for you to remain consistent. As the child grows and understands he will know what he can do at Moms.... and he will know what he can do at Dads. It sounds like you already have this one figured out.|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	I think it depends on what role you want in the family and in your stepson's life. Since he's only 4 you really are in a position to be a good role model. I say go for it, and treat him like your son.<br>  <br>  Letting your hubbie handle it, weakens your position and just lets the stepkid think he can disrespect you.|`|KqQlWbYsaa	I don't hear anything from you as to marriage being imminent.  That being said, however, if you and the child's father become engaged, I frankly see no reason why you and the fellow cannot sit down together and civilly discuss just what this dad is comfortable with as to your role in the parenting process.  From a practical standpoint, if you are the one who primarily will be on hand to take care of the child, it does make sense that you be allowed to play a proactive parenting role (as opposed to being the one who passively is present and leaves all up to the male).  Yet, even so, I must emphasize that it really is the dad's call, not yours, as to what your role will be.<br>  <br>  By the way, an exception to the above is if the child's behavior subjects you to actual or the threat of physical or psychological abuse:  In that case, you are well within your rights in addressing the matter with the local authorities; and seeking psychological/psychiatric intervention as a remedy.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	There is nothing wrong with trying your best to help a child to learn to respect your home in being obedient.  Just do not go over board, learn to also forgive if he has a challenge to lesson, for like you said his mother was into a lot of things and drugs .They may have effected the child in his learning ability so take it easy, he is a child respect him also. Love is the greatest gift a parent, or to be step mom can give to a child remember this. Respect the child and the child will respect you this is true love. Anger is no solution in trying to changing a child to do what you want them to do. It destroys them on the in side It destroys there spirit. Love is the answer, for love comes from the heart. Remember that forgiveness also comes from the heart. compaction.|`|XIH2oKtJaa	well you have been good enough to help bring up her child for the past 2 years i don't think its bad if you discipline him while she is there if she makes no effort. as long as you don't smack him which i am totally against (and definately not saying this is what you do). i also think that its not a problem if you comfort him when she is there, its the child's feelings that are important and not hers so if he's upset and you are closest whats the problem?? about his bad behaviour though have you tried talking to his mum? if that won't work as long as you don't let him get away with it at your house he will probably stop trying it.|`|djUMvICoaa	For your first part, you shouldn't have to 'step in' to correct anything.  I hope you mean that you tell dad and he does the correcting because if it's unacceptable he has to be in on the correction as well. <br>  Just tell him that behavor is not acceptable in your house.  He'll know what you mean as long as you also follow up and follow through.<br>  While I'm not a mother I think I can still handle that last part.  Most mothers don't want to have their toes stepped on by the "new" mom and figure it's their kid, it's their say.  The best way to handle this is really letting your husband handle it have him talk to her about some of the behavior and why it distresses him.  If they can work you into the mix to be helpful all the better.  If not, she still has the control.

So smoking turned into a little more often than parties and then it became a habitat that I haven't been able to break tried lots of times. Now its not just the right time to quit to many other stresses in life to take on one more stress of quitting. Just a little fact to share smoking is a harder addiction to quit than heroin.|`|WzXfcoGaaa	experimenting, curiosity ...
IQEf57ANaa	well, if people thinks it is to see what you do, then give it a try. but remember when a girl breaks up with her boyfriend and then goes back to him it means that she still likes him, i think it will be weird that she will go back with him jsut to see your reaction, but then again, you are in high school and things are not logic in high school|`|ubDQTBudaa	Listen to your heart ..........if you love her then do something about it ........if you don't love her don't waste your time .........|`|IAaPW50gaa	That's tough dude.

Good luck man!|`|gkZ03j6Taa	I think that she might still like her ex and didnt just to see what your reaction would be but she might have just give her some space and dont try too hard when she has a boyfriend but just stay friends with her and then if her and her boyfriend break up go for it|`|UPhngg5Waa	Give her space.

a73a11fa642e15167d49c1ea43b54b8caa	It's a drag, but unfortunately over 50% of American marriages end in divorce, so, tho it's no consolation, you're not alone.  You and your brother will still have your parents.  They still love you and will be there for you.  Don't give up on them.  Keep your head together, focus on your school work, and when it comes time for you to marry, make sure your partner has qualities that will suit you for life.  That is easier said than done, but all you can do is try.  Help your brother whenever you can.|`|HE56Jra6aa	Just maybe... They had problems and never involved you kids in them.<br>  If they need to be separated, to make their problems solved. then let them do what they have to do.<br>  As for you, You need to let them know How you feel, tell them everything. You need to be there for your younger brother and make it okay for him as well as you.|`|29hcn9JRaa	I have a shy 15 year old son myself, and understand your lack of desire to seek out counseling as my son would most likely oppose the idea of this to. I am going to look at your situation as if I were advising my very own son, what I would tell my son is to understand that this isn't his fault nor anyone else's fault either, divorce is typically the hardest on children, and no one ever said coping with divorce was easy, however it is quite doable, my suggestion is for you to take it one day at a time with the attitude of willingness for change, change doesn't always have to be horrible, many people especially kids are afraid of change, and begin to future trip over things that haven't yet happened, this is why taking it one day at a time is so important for you, don't look at the big picture, only look at what is happening in the here and now, as you can better control what is happening today. Support your little brother and stay as busy as you can. Trust me you will eventually adjust to your new life, and will always have the love of both your parents. Be strong, Penelope|`|AA10065812	???<br>  First, this is going to be a little long winded, but I've been working on it for a few hours.  I've worked with divorced and single fathers for 20 years, as of this week, so this is based on experience.  <br>  <br>  First off, when someone says that over 50% of marriages in in divorce, remember that the majority of them involve individuals who have been marriage multiple times.  Also, 85% of those that get a divorce were living together, or married prior to age 24.  That is the age when a woman reaches full maturity.  A male reaches it at age 30.  So, don't EVER think that 50% of first marriages in in divorce.  Those who wait, keep their shorts or panties on until marriage, especially until about age 24, have the greatest chance of being a lifetime partnership.  Let that be your goal in life.<br>  <br>  As for your parents, many say you shouldn't get involve in their problems, but I disagree.  Their problems affect you and your long term development, so more than anyone, you have and deserve an opinion.<br>  <br>  Let's start with this link quote from Fortune Magazine, "Ominously, the most reliable predictor of crime is neither poverty nor race but growing up fatherless."<br>  <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1992/08/10/76732/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/f...</a><br>  <br>  Not having a father in the home is the greatest factor contributing to criminal behavior.<br>  <br>  Than there's this, "We know that children of divorced parents have more emotional and behavioral problems and do less well in school than children who live with both their parents." from a Stanford University study, "Divorce, Nontraditional Families, and Its Consequences For Children"<br>  <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~rmahony/Divorce.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stanford.edu/~rmahony/Divorce...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Now for a few books to recommend to them:<br>  The Proper Care and Feeding of Marriage <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Proper-Care-and-Feeding-of-Marriage/Dr-Laura-Schlessinger/e/9780061142826/?itm=4" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Pro...</a><br>  <br>  Ten Stupid Things Couples do to Mess up Their Relationships <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stupid-Things-Couples-do-to-Mess-up-Their-Relationships/Laura-Schlessinger/e/9780060512606/?itm=7" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stu...</a><br>  <br>  Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess up Their Lives <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stupid-Things-Women-Do-to-Mess-up-Their-Lives/Dr-Laura-Schlessinger/e/9780060976491/?itm=3" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stu...</a><br>  <br>  Ten Stupid Things Men Do to Mess Up Their Lives <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stupid-Things-Men-Do-to-Mess-Up-Their-Lives/Laura-Schlessinger/e/9780641865411/?itm=8" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stu...</a><br>  <br>  Stupid Things Parents Do to Mess Up Their Kids <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Stupid-Things-Parents-Do-to-Mess-Up-Their-Kids/Laura-Schlessinger/e/9780060933791/?itm=12" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Stupid-...</a><br>  <br>  Fatherless America : Confronting Our Most Urgent Social Problem<br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Fatherless-America/David-Blankenhorn/e/9780060926830/?itm=1" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Fatherl...</a><br>  <br>  As for living arrangements, tell them you want JOINT PHYSICAL CUSTODY OF THEM.  You want to stay in the house you love.  Each of them can live there for three weeks than can switch.  The one not in the home during the three weeks wil take you and your brother out out for an evening once a week.  There will be no dating or adult overnight guests except for relatives, during this time.  At the end of the workday, the one in the home comes home, no after work drinks or dinners with special friends.  This is called Bird Nest Custody.  I created this site for gathering info on it.  You might also want to do your own research.  I have a local attorney working on just such a case.<br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice</a><br>  <br>  Finally, remind them that in your eyes, this is a failure in their ability to be good partners and parents.  This is not a good example for you and your brother and for your futures.<br>  <br>  If the two you want to do something, take a note from the Bible.  Do a little Christian Shunning.<br>  <br>  Do not associate with them, or talk to them, except for the necessary things.  No mom or dad talks.  No sitting with either of them watching TV.  No asking for anything unrelated to the basics of life and school.  If either wants to do a family outing, only if the other parent is included.  Spend a lot of time with your little brother as he will be the greatest affect by the divorce, but the two of you need to be a team.  Do fun things with him, like playing board games.  If a parent ask to join you, simply say no thank you, as the other parent is not there to join in.  <br>  <br>  Don't be disobedient.  Do your school work, get home on time, keep your rooms clean, and even do your own laundry.  Stay away from the boys for now, other than your brother.  They can be a distraction.<br>  <br>  Both of you keep a journal.|`|5khnqAdKaa	Sorry to hear about that. <br>  <br>  It's going to be hard, but you're going to have to be there for your parents. They are going to be going through a rough time. If you don't agree with the living arrangments let them know and see if they can compromise with you. <br>  <br>  As for coping with this, there is nothing you can really do in a situation like this, so the best thing to do is know that both your parents love you very much and they obviously want to share custody.|`|OhuBjMXaaa	I am also a mother of two and i got a divorce five  years ago... from my experience i can tell you that you are a lucky girl not having heard their discussions and things adults do before separating, i guess they are very mature and know how to handle things like that. My advice is be patient and talk to them, it′s hard on you being the oldest but i hope everything turns out fine for you.. and hopefully won′t go to counseling. It always hurts but still if they don′t want to be together it′s not the kids fault and it′s worse if they don′t divorce.|`|eh1PtU0jaa	Try to understand that your parents haave feelings too.

Please don't hesitate to seek professional help.  It will give you the necessary support to get through what will be a long and traumatic experience.  There is life after divorce for all involved but it comes at a price.
