3492c30e32a24dabde42de93307d7dc2aa	To my knowledge, most if not all of the Hard Rock Hotels are casinos as well. And since Texas does not allow gambling (except for lottery and horse racing) then I doubt they would open one in Dallas.    And Ryan is correct about the Hard Rock Cafe. It closed a couple of years ago and was promptly bulldozed. I drive by that now-empty lot almost every day.|`|ltg4YHRsaa	Definitely not.      There was a Hard Rock Cafe here in Uptown Dallas for over 20 years, and they demolished it last year.  There was even a bunch of people trying to save it as a "historical landmark" since the building was here for over 100 years!      If they demolished the cafe, there is very slim chance they would put up a hotel...    Here is the link for the HRC article.    http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/...|`|lAWrMhP1aa	I'm almost positive not.

The Carnival Conquest, in particular, has many young people aboard ship.

1Vih78dZaa	The Autostrade in Italy are generally quite good, but they are all toll roads. Some of the minor roads around where we live in central Italy are appallingly badly maintained (sections literally falling down hillsides, huge potholes that go months without being fixed and a generally poor level of maintenance) and even some of the major non-motorway roads are not all that great.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what "wealthier European countries" you're referring to, but I've driven on motorways in Britain, France, Austria, Germany, Switzerland and The Netherlands. Italian motorways are okay, but not dramatically better than the motorways in any of those countries.<br>  <br>  And, since you have to pay for the privilege of using Italian motorways while they are free in the UK, Germany and The Netherlands, you could say that the comparison is biased in favour of Italy in any case.<br>  <br>  There are, in fact, things which I really dislike about Italian motorways (that's apart from the large numbers of idiotic Italian drivers one finds using them). For example, Italian motorway designers seem to have never left the country and seen how it is possible for long merge lanes at motorway entrances can make it much safer for traffic joining the motorway. In Italy, the on-ramps are generally so short that many people end up coming to a complete stop and waiting for a gap in the traffic. It's also very common for motorways to have only two lanes, which does make driving more challenging, as does the fact that many motorways have quite sharp bends. This latter fact, combined with the fact that the guardrails are actually taller than most cars and set very close to the side of the road, means that sight-lines for drivers are much shorter than they are, for example, on German autobahns or even British motorways.<br>  <br>  And, as any good driver will tell you, being able to see what's happening on the road a long way ahead of you is a large part of driving safely.|`|896406d7dedb37c4ef791414e98ee7d9aa	I don't think italian motorways are better than those fron other wealthier european countries (France, Germany, UK etc.).  For sure there are more, someone says because that was the will of Gianni Agnelli, the owner of FIAT, italian car manufacturer, who wanted people to use cars more than trains. That's the reason why italian railways are worse than those from, example, France, Germany, UK.<br>  <br>  There was a motto in the 70's that said 'what's good for Agnelli is good for Italy', of course was a joke, but with some truth inside...|`|5vKTjB7Paa	Well, I'm Italian but I don't really know....|`|LgC2oA77aa	in italy we have the best motorways in fact of holes in the asphalt (especially in southern italy)

iScNZJWSaa	Dallas is a great place to live...people are very friendly.<br>  <br>  It is a large city, so there is a scene/suburb/neighborhood for every person and group of people.<br>  <br>  It all depends on what your interests are, etc...<br>  <br>  In the city of Dallas, you have uptown, Knox-Henderson, West Village, Lakewood etc...all are great urban areas...very upscale, big city like....<br>  within walking distance of great bars, restaurants, shopping, etc...museums, theaters all nearby...a great place for single people to live, and people without children that like living "in the city" and all that can offer.  The very expensive areas of Highland Park and University Park are also great urban areas...but, very pricey.<br>  <br>  Addison is a great suburb with a lot to do...again, great restaurants, live theater, shopping and a ton of bars.  Again, great for singles or people with no children...or people that can afford private school.  It has an urban feel...although, it is just outside of the I-635 loop...so you have the best of both worlds...urban feel, but in a close-in suburbs.  Only 10 minutes downtown via the tollway, 10 minutes to the airport...very central located...and close to 635, 75, 35.  So, you can live in the suburbs and still be close to culture.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for kid-friendly suburbs, the best ones are found to the north in Plano or Frisco.  Great values on huge homes...and great schools...the people are mostly forward thinking, young, professional types....very family oriented.  However, a good drive from the city-proper<br>  <br>  To the northwest you have Grapevine, Coppell and Southlake.  All great school district areas, and all 20-30 minuts from Dallas...again, well-educated, professional family cities.  However, very suburban feel...they have their own little downtown areas, and shopping, etc...but, geared toward families.<br>  <br>  Irving is a little red-neck...but, if that is your sort of thing...not a bad place to be.  It also has a lot of shopping and restaurants...but, is very dated...most were built in the 60's and 70's.<br>  <br>  Arlington is o.k....again, a little red-neck.  Albeit, this is where the stadiums and six-flags are...so close to entertainment areas, that have with them, restaurants and businesses to support the stadiums...so, not a bad place to live.<br>  <br>  Fort Worth is cool...has more of a small town feel than Dallas.  But, still has some museums, and theaters, etc...  However, it is not as urban...or as "hip".  <br>  <br>  Obviously, there are many suburbs in the area where english is the second language, as well as some downtown areas of each of the larger cities.  If that is your thing...no problem...And, the further out into the suburbs you go...the more redneck it gets....<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|xkcLOfTKaa	Dallas is the greatest city in the world...<br>  The only real con is that since the country is dry, it is hit or miss as where you can buy liquor... (the COUNTRY is dry, but each city has the individual right to sell) - so if you live in a suburb, you have to make your way to Dallas proper to get some tequila...<br>  <br>  EDIT : And when you get here, let me know! I would love to buy you a beer!<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, another con of Dallas...<br>  Some of the worst traffic in the world! ;)|`|Dpzk9w0Naa	I kinda like Arlington, it's a neat little town and it's between the other two.<br>  <br>  Regards.|`|wLLylvN2aa	If your gonna be working just a couple of miles North of Arlington, then Arlington would be the best place to live. Its right in the middle of ft worth and dallas, so there's always plenty to do withing a 30 min drive.  Traffic can be bad, so living reasonably close to your place of work is ideal.|`|W7LGoC3yaa	I lived in Irving for years but it has gotten pretty run down, except for the newer, nicer area to the north called Las Colinas.  Irving is centrally located between D/FW, close to downtown Dallas and the airport.<br>  <br>  I don't like Arlington at all.  There isn't much shopping at all -- the only nice area is in far south Arlington and there is a huge gang problem there. Also no public transportation is you need that.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what "as.erwin" was trying to say when he told you the "country" was dry -- what country is it he's talking about?  Even if he meant county -- Dallas County is not dry.  Most suburbs sell beer/wine in stores but don't sell liquor in bars, however you can gt a drink with your meal in a restaurant.

Ne9rXERpaa	On the move once again, Linz?|`|s1zitZMOaa	I'm an hour North of there so it's fairly similar, but a tad more extreme. So take what I say and ramp it up a notch. <br>  <br>  It gets cold - down to about zero at the worst but that is not the standard. In December and January it's usually around 10 degrees to 30 degrees, up to 40. But you can have days in the 50's or higher - we've had a warm winter this year and here recently days in the high 60s. It mellows out by mid February and gets downright toasty - mid 40's. Snow season is pretty much November to March but you usually have some in October and into April. The only two months it doesn't snow in is June and July. It's very dry and I mean dry, dry, dry. Super strength conditioner and lotion is essential. You need a car that is decent in snow but they do a good job of keeping the roads clear and I've never been unable to get out and around. Snow is worse down there. It's beautiful and the summers are beyond fantastic. Colorado Springs is gorgeous - far prettier than where I am (Southeast of Denver). <br>  I've lived quite a few places and I love it here - love it, love it, love it. Just buy a coat, snow boots, and some gloves. It's not that bad.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	I was in Palmer Lake (North of the Springs) one June and had snow several inches deep one day.

I have lived in Colorado Springs for 15 years and have seen snow in every month except August.  We get a light, dry snow in the early winter months (Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb), and then a heavier, wet snow in the spring.  It generally doesn't last very long, since it is so dry here, maybe a day or two normally before it's gone.  <br>  <br>  I grew up in southern California and I absolutely love that we have seasons here.  It's a beautiful city, not nearly as "uber conservative" as people make it out to be.  If you like to ski, it's several hours away to the ski areas, but you can hike, go snow shoeing and tons of other stuff right here.|`|BpXbNjEpaa	Windy.  Really, really windy.  Gusts up to 55mph, usually 12-20.  It usually only starts really going at night, though, so it's only patio furniture that suffers for it.<br>  The snow isn't as bad as you'd assume?  For the most part it gets stuck on Pike's Peak and the city will only see about an inch.  Just north of town, at Monument and such, THEY'LL get buried.  The Springs?  Not so much.  I live up by the Garden of the Gods and very rarely get snowed in.  <br>  It's pretty warm for most of the season, actually.  40-50 is pretty usual, and combined with the sun and altitude?  That's jeans-and-short-sleeves weather.<br>  It's at the coldest in late December and early January, which is when the most snow comes in.  A good jacket and a good pair of shoes is plenty to get through.

You can go by train to all 3 cities virtually in a straight line. Trains in Italy are inexpensive as they are run by the state, check the Trenitalia website for fares. <br>  <br>  If you want a beach, then I agree that Rimini and Riccione are very good choices as they are extremely organized and the nightlife is fantastic. As for shopping, Italy is a shoppers paradise. There's loads of shops located in city centres although there are malls (called Centro Commerciale) where you normally need a car or a bus to get to. You can search online when you've decided where you plan on going. <br>  <br>  Museums and works of art are everywhere in Italy, 2/3rds of the worlds art treasures are located in Italy alone. So take your pick. If you're still undecided, have a look at Rick Steve's website.<br>  <br>  Have fun...I always do.|`|ky3pQS4jaa	It depends really on your length of stay. For  a short time I would say Rome - there is just so much to see. You will never forget Vatican city, you can access the beach by buss, you will meet a lot of people your age. And you can just walk around and see history all around you. <br>       If you take the eurail, (which is what I did) you can get around pretty easily. The prices vary just google eurail. <br>  From my experiences, Venice was very interesting and romantic but filled with an older crowd, Rome has the Colosseum and vatican city which if you two are going for a short time I recommend Rome for sure. Also when I was there, I met tons of young people my age in our hostel.  I recommend this great hostel which took us out of free tours and pub crawls.

Once you reach Madagaon railway station, your closest beach is at Colva and Beanulim which are around 6-7 kms away.<br>  <br>   So when you ask the cabbie and check the rates as per the rate tarriff counter, you know what you are in for and will not be taken for a ride. Do note that cabbies and auto's in Goa do not work on a meter like the metros of India. Here there are fixed tariffs between destinations and you need to be aware about the tarriffs which are put up at all travel stations like railway stations too. Also per km basis on longer distances is what the system here is all about<br>  <br>  For hotels, if you have a family you might be more comfortable with a apartment. At the moment we have sparkling apartments at Colva itself which are  the ideal places for you at cheap rates in Goa.

New York is also very nice! Flamingo is ok but is smells fishy because of the Flamingos.|`|b1w5FUGzaa	Me and my sister did alot of research for our trip to vegas and we ended up staying at Treasure Island hotel because it was cheaper than alot of the other ones (Mirage, MGM, etc.) and it was right on the strip, right in the middle of all the action, great location, great hotel, no complaints !  But this was a few years ago, so not sure what the prices are like now.|`|QUTI4UIzaa	Hi<br>  <br>  Right i have been to a few and i loved them all but the ones that stood out were<br>  <br>  The Venetian (Posh)<br>  Caesars (Marble and kind of Posh)<br>  The Wyn (New Big and great)<br>  The Bellagio (The fountains you can watch all night )<br>  <br>  i went to see them and they are great...they have all got great rooms and all have shows to see.

You can go to many casinos within a short distance. The Golden Nugget is beautiful, has a great pool.  The atmosphere downtown is so much more friendly. <br>  And if you don't stay downtown, at least some evening go down and visit it.  I know you won't be disappointed.|`|hCfjvfswaa	Bellagio is in the center of the strip near many great hotels within a short walking distance to Planet Hollywood, Paris Casino, Caesars, Bally's, the new City Center and more.|`|xif22nwoaa	We've stayed at Caesar's and Venetian and I would recommend them both.  They are both very nice places - expensive, but not too pricey - with great rooms.  We had really nice service at both places, and would stay at either of them again.  And they have a great location right toward the center of the strip, so it's definitely possible to walk everywhere from them.  It's still a long walk to the extreme ends of the strip, but most of the attractions are within a pretty easy walk of those hotels.<br>  <br>  Other nice ones in the area are Bellagio, Flamingo, and Mirage.  There are also some much less expensive options nearby, such as Harrah's, Imperial Palace, and Bally's.|`|puyAEPZyaa	I would definitely recommend that you book a room or suite at Bellgaio. Here is my run-down on Bellagio:<br>  <br>  Location: Bellagio is located in the center of the Strip, so you can easily walk or take a taxi, bus, or the Las Vegas monorail to access everything else.<br>  <br>  Atmosphere: Bellagio has a more upscale atmosphere, but is very inviting to all its guests. Bellagio carries more of an Italian theme throughout the resort, so tends to have a more romantic appeal to it.<br>  <br>  Accommodations: Bellagio offers upscale rooms and suites that are elegantly appointed. The staff is very accommodating and the room service is above average. You can't beat a room overlooking the fountains in front of Bellagio. Rooms average $150 a night.<br>  <br>  Casino: Bellagio offers a variety of games and tables to suit anyone.<br>  <br>  Dining: Bellagio offers fine dining, along with casual and contemporary dining. For fine dining, they offer Circo, Jasmine, Le Cirque, Michael Mina, Picasso, and Prime Steakhouse. For casual and contemporary dining, they offer Yellowtail Sushi Restaurant and Bar, Sensi, Olives, Fix, Noodles, the Buffet, and the Cafe. For dessert, they also offer Cafe Gelato, Palio, and Jean Philippe Patisserie.<br>  <br>  Entertainment: Bellagio offers the one-of-a-kind Cirque du Soleil "O".<br>  <br>  Nightlife: Bellagio offers the Fontana Bar, along with the Caramel Lounge and The Bank nightclub.<br>  <br>  Other Amenities: Bellagio also offers a world class spa and salon, high-priced shopping in Via Bellagio and Via Fiore, and a beatiful pool area. Finally, Bellagio also features world-renowned fountains in the front of the resort, a beautiful botanical garden located inside the Conservatory, and an amazing Gallery of Fine Art.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you enjoy your trip to Las Vegas!
DESsW5xqaa	Cheung Sha Wan Road in Hong Kong is where you can get clothing at wholesale prices. Some are cheap quality, but you can also find good stuff here. This is the go-to place where many retail stores in Hong Kong buy their stock. Some stores are wholesale only, though, and some have not-very-clearly-posted signs to tell you about this in Chinese only. You won't be able to try anything on, either. I call this one "bargain shopping for the adventurous".<br>  <br>  AVOID Fa Yuen Street and most other areas in Mongkok, loads of clothing at cheap prices and even cheaper quality. This is only good if you want cheap crap.<br>  <br>  Henessey Road in Wanchai has some good outlet stores.<br>  <br>  Granville Road in Tsimshatsui has a good range of stores in various price ranges and quality levels.<br>  <br>  In contrast to all the bargain shopping places, if you want to have some fun looking at pricey stuff, Elements, Festival Walk, and Harbour City are where you would go.|`|PxgyxvUJaa	I've been to all 3 and my personal favourite is Bangkok.

For Chinese Citizen like you, Bangkok will be a better bargain but Hong Kong will be most stylist of all three. For the fashion ones, go to Harbour City/Ocean Ctr for many fashion goods, as well as Times Sq and Sogo Department store for good fashion. For good price for good fashion, Singapore's shopping ctr like Ochard Rd shopping area will be a good place for hunting as there are many discounts recently, as well as many other shopping centres. As for Bangkok, as its pretty cheap, any shopping ctr will do. But beware of rip-off in Bangkok and Hong Kong in some places so have to becareful. Its safe to shop in Singapore anyway.|`|pm2EeEgiaa	Sorry for not answering your question, but the most vibrant shopping city in Asia is Manila, Philippines.<br>  <br>  The second, third, fifth, sixth, and tenth largest malls in the whole world are all in Manila. There are also lots of European brands which can't be found in Hong Kong, Singapore, or Bangkok but have their Asian headquarters in Manila - that's why the Philippines is one of the top destination of Koreans, Japanese, and other Asians - not only shopping but also cool beaches, beautiful people, and romantic Hispanic culture - a piece of Spain in Asia.<br>  <br>  There are also malls in Manila which specialize in imitation clothing, perfumes, CDs, and DVDs.<br>  <br>  Mall of Asia, Greenbelt Park, Bonifacio High Street, Rockwell, MegaMall, Glorietta, TriNoMa, Greenhills, Shangri-La Plaza, Eastwood are just some of Manila's trendiest malls. <br>  <br>  English is also widely spoken in the Philippines, and if it matters to you, there are also a lot of resident Americans, Europeans, and Koreans in the Philippines.<br>  <br>  Manila is just an hour away from Hong Kong, four hours from Singapore, and two hours from Bangkok.

1bTYCUDkaa	Have no fear! The airport is a simple place. First, you should leave to the airport around 2 and a half hours before your flight if you are traveling within the US, and if you are going internationally, leave 3 hours before your departure time. You will pull up on to the ramp, and you will see signs that will have the names of airlines on them, for example, Southwest Airlines, Delta Airlines, America West, Virgin America, and so on. Stop at the sign that has your airline listed on it. Walk inside with all of your luggage. Walk to the desk, and you will be told what to do by the agent. Give them all of the luggage you want to not carry-on to the plane. He or she will then give you are boarding pass, if you have not yet printed it online, and some baggage receipts, just in case your bags get lost. Then, proceed to the TSA Security, with your carry-on bag. Give the TSA Agent your ID and Boarding pass. They will sign the boarding pass, and give you both items back. They will tell you which line to go to. Put your carry-on bag into the X-ray, and remove your shoes, jacket, and any metal devices including a cell phone, rings, ear rings, belts, etc. Put them in a bin. Then, put them into the X-ray as well. A TSA Agent will tell you to walk under a metal detector X-ray. It will beep if you still have metal on you. If no metal is on you, you will be free to go. Retrieve your items at the end of the X-ray. Walk to your gate. For example, if your gate is B19, walk towards the sign that says, "To B Gates", or whatever your gate number is. Sit down, and wait until boarding. Boarding will be explained to the passengers before entering.<br>  <br>  Once you get to your destination airport, walk towards the sign that says, "Baggage Claim"; follow the other passengers if you are not sure where to go. There will be a carousel, and then once you see your bag(s), pull them off. Remember, it may take 10-20 minutes for bags to begin to arrive. Walk outside, and wait for the person picking you up. Good luck, and email me if you have any more questions.|`|v7ZmPEwOaa	check in online, print your itenerary, go straight to security. in atlanta go to your gate dont go thru security just wait on next flight !

Don't forget:  Liquids in a plastic bag!|`|xif22nwoaa	Check in online, print your boarding passes, and go straight to security when you get to the airport.  At security you will need to have your boarding pass out (for your first flight), and your photo ID.  They will scan your carry-on baggage, and also your shoes so you'll have to be prepared to take them off.  You will walk through a metal detector and pick up your stuff on the other side.  Check out the TSA websites for information about what you can and cannot take in your carry-on bag, as well as the rules regarding liquids (www.tsa.gov).  <br>  <br>  When you get to Atlanta for your layover, you will not have to go through security again.  You will just head to the appropriate gate and wait for your flight.

I do not have personal experience with these companies, but here are two that do have a good reputation in the community.     Best to you.

NOTE:  According to the Greyhound web site, their buses don't have any power points at the seats, so you might have trouble if you want to bring and use a cell phone, portable DVD player, or similar device on board.  If you do take this trip, have fun.|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	What is your question?
82wXvW3baa	If you're scared of turbulence then you'd surely want to avoid looking outside. You can feel the turbulence, but usually turbulence doesn't last for very long. Closing your eyes helps. It's a lot better than being in an earthquake.    What I'd recommend doing during the flight is sleep. Now I know some people don't like to do that, not even me. I tried to stay up for the 12-hour flight, but after an hour I got bored and fell asleep. I woke up about 2 hours before we landed. If you're not sleep, make sure to walk up and down the aisles once a while, so your muscles don't fall asleep.

AW1OWmOtaa	The 5 cities in Ireland (republic) are Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford. Galway in my opinion is the most beautiful, it's on the West coast of Ireland. Everywhere on the coast has some tourist activity but some more so than others. I'd recommend checking this site out  http://www.discoverireland.com/ire/  There are some lovely towns you will find on that website which I would be inclined to recommend such as Dingle, Killarney or Westport.|`|vhuqAqNdaa	Im from dublin, and i think anywhere along the kerry coastline is the nicest ive seen, not necessarily the city(Tralee, yuck), but their are loads of lovely little towns.|`|AA11616170	When you have a beautiful city on the coast, naturally all the tourists want to be there.  I'd vote for Galway.  Clifden and Westport are other very pretty towns.  And the tourists love them too.    When you come, head the car in any direction and just follow the road.  There are lovely places everywhere. And enjoy your visit !!!|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Ireland doesn't really do cities .... it's a rural nation, really.

If you are looking for something all inclusive as far as services offered, check out Chateau Elan up I-85 in Braselton.  It's not a long drive from Atlanta itself, but it's far enough out of the city.  You can really be pampered there if you spend a day there.  It's a great weekend trip.|`|s2DzUnhFaa	??????
tQsxsuNPaa	Cell phone?  You'll be there all year?  Get one there.     Anything you use from here you'll need to pay exorbitant roaming fees on, and you have to spend about $400 (that's what I've found, anyway) on an international (four band) phone.      I'd just set up a phone there.    Just bring basic clothes.  You'll probably want warmer than you think.  You'll need a couple of warm sweaters, etc.  Check out this site, to see how they are dressing there.     http://www.elcorteingles.es/tiendas/port...     Check out the shoes, too.  You want to bring what you think will fit in best.  I hear they are wearing their pants skin tight these days.    Make sure any electronics that you need to have are dual voltage.     Be sure to bring your camera and tons of media for it.      Get your hair cut so that you don't need to maintain it much...it's tons easier.    And remember, anything that is consumable, you can get there.  It's an industrialized country, and you can get anything you need.  Except a washcloth.  You may want to stick one of those into your luggage!  I couldn't find a washcloth to save my life!     Bring your sense of adventure, and your adventurous taste buds, too!    And have a really great time!  (oh, and where are you going to be?  Madrid gets snow and serious cold in the winter...Sevilla gets broiling hot by about mid May.)|`|ee7384ea0293058505bf87fa1fdf343daa	Buy your cellphone in Spain OR bring your UK one and buy a Spanish sim card for about 25 with 10 credit on it.You will need 2 pin adaptors if you bring UK electrical stuff with you---best to buy these in the UK as the Spanish adaptors are not easy to find.Central Spain gets very cold in winter but exceptionally hot in summer.you need air con!!! Food is still relatively cheap here but with the / exchange rate moving all the time you have to be careful when you change money.If you have a UK address I suggest you ontain a Nationwide Debit card and Credit Card   no commission charged. I am so glad we have these accounts!!They can easily be operated on line. Good luck.
d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	I've only been here a few months I'm from OH so I can understand your parents thinking. I agree with that long post ahead of me, it's wonderful here but make sure this is the right kind of heat you want. Florida is wonderful for that muggy, humid heat. The air will always feel thicker there, especially if you live south of the Tampa-Orlando areas. I used to live in the Ft. Myers - Naples area and during the summer it rained EVERY DAY from July to October, then it would DRY up and not rain very much until maybe May. (Tropical climate, monsoon seasons I guess)    San Diego is more like a desert climate. It hardly rains here at all, at least from what I've seen and been told by locals. go to weather.com and track the weather of San Diego to get an idea of what the temps have been and will be. So far from personal experience, it's been sunny 6 out of 7 days on average each week. Life feels very laid back and the drivers are a little nicer than they are in either Los Angeles or Florida.     As for a safe neighborhood to live in. Well I know that the Mission Valley, Mission Hills, Normal Heights, Kensington, North Park areas are safe if they are looking to live near downtown in a city like setting. Anything that is West of I-805, more specifically anything west of 30th ave. and north of Upas St. (bordering Balboa Park) all the way over to Mission Hills, then south to Mission Valley. (Trying to give you a mental image. Maybe try google maps and search for these areas I'm talking about) Mission Valley is more of your average start of the suburbs. There is a large mall, lots of restaurants and shopping. There are apartments and also a ways out there are homes.     Suburbs, I've heard to stay away from Oceanside, this was from a cop that worked there, he told me where was safe, but they still had people going up there are breaking in people's homes. Hmm, I got out of that town fairly quickly. Now where I live, it's safe to leave your doors unlocked, but that doesn't mean there aren't people around that will cause trouble.     The beaches, Mission and Ocean beach have lots of homes, they might be good places to live. Very close to the highways as well, unlike what most people think of when you think of a beach town. (I didn't realize that the highway just let you literally right off onto the main road, and about a mile down you were at the "beach") Again though they themselves have their good and bad areas.    the SDSU area is nice, if you want to live near a college campus and so is the La Mesa area. They have a large mall there as well, with Wal Mart, Guitar Center, and most of what you would find near a shopping area. I think Best Buy just opened there as well. La Jolla (pronounced La 'Hoya', there is lot's of Spanish influence since we are only 15 minutes from the border! )    Areas to stay away from: Anywhere remotely close to Downtown on the east side. (I've been there and sadly it appears to me as the nice Spanish ghetto, I would say the people that live there don't cause trouble, but I don't think it would be the place to raise a family from PA, I didn't feel comfortable there although they were probably all harmless, but Spanish people don't seem to like us gays/lesbians) Stay away from National City, I've been warned that it's not a real nice area, but I don't really have any real knowledge of the area. I personally would try to stay north of downtown if possible.    Hope this can give you some help on what it's like here. Try to find people that know of someone that lives here and ask them for their opinion of the areas.    Also jobs for the parents, they can search monster.com and jobing.com (website for just San Diego country jobs) to help with the job search.|`|4jOaN0WIaa	Yes, it is an absolutely beautiful place to live.|`|Cu0zrPWDaa	Like others have said, you will have good areas, you will have bad areas. San Diego is an awesome city though|`|Ebfkg4kJaa	????  theres always going to be a bad and good part of town.|`|LOvdUFSDaa	yes, it is an excelent place to live...i am always going to san diego and i love it...i was born there and i constantly go there...|`|qjqJVQiVaa	yes i think its a safe place to live, there are good and bad areas like everywhere else, national city is not that bad it just depends on where in national city but eastlake is very nice but it is kinda pricey and certain parts of chula vista are nice too it depends on where and its pretty affordable. but overall san diego is awesome you will love it|`|AA11951881	Hey, there.  I've lived in San Diego since 1979, originally from Pennsylvania....near Shamokin.    As others have said, there are good places to live and some not so good, but overall it is a very safe city.    One thing, I might add about the weather.  My mother, who lived in PA until she died, used to go to Florida during the winter with her 'boy friend.'   When she came to visit me, she was very disappointed that the weather here during the winter was not as warm as she was used to in Florida.    While our winters are not like those in PA, they are not tropical either.  In parts of San Diego, you can get frost and ice on your car windows during the winter.  Some days the highs will not get out of the seventies and the lows are normally in the high forties to low fifties, but as I said, can get down to the low thirties.    So, I love it here, wouldn't live anywhere else, but it ain't Hawaii and it ain't Florida.    Feel free to contact me directly if your parents actually decide to move and I'd be happy to try to answer any questions they or you might have.

But then one day I'll just wake up forgetting all about it, wondering what was so special about that person in the first place cause I didnt even know the person.

f43be0279e4f60717eb598a32d93faa0aa	It's quite hard getting a full time permanent job, seeing as a recent report showed almost  25 % of advertised jobs are part time and of a temporary nature, often with only a few hours per week. There are jobs out there but obviously many are over subscribed, and it is definitely a hirer's market. They can pick and choose the top applicants from a very well educated and experienced group of applicants, many of whom would have been able to walk into the position a year ago. It's a little harder in the rural areas seeing as there are generally less jobs around. However, there are still jobs available and new ones are still being created every week. The type of work also has lots to do with it, there are fewer manufacturing and trade jobs advertised than this time last year, but for example,  I always see engineering and jobs being advertised. <br>  You also need to be able to or willing to relocate in order to remain really competitive in the market at the moment, particularly in my home area of rural East Anglia.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	If you mean a permanent, full time, long term job - VERY hard.

Of course not. A soldier that completes the service returns all the equipment encluding wepon. However when soldiers go home for a break they do take their wepons.

hwnMQfa5aa	I flew to New York less than two weeks ago. The system is the same as it has always been - you board the plane, and at some point you get given either a green or a white card, depending on whether you have a visa. For people just visiting for a short time or holidays, you are given a GREEN card, which is then attached to your passport once you reach Immigration at the airport. For those with a visa (ie, those who live in the USA or have a work or student permit) they are given a WHITE card on the plane, which has pretty much the same info as the green card.<br>  <br>  Nobody has mentioned anything about having to go online to fill in any forms. I travel from the UK to the US on a regular basis and I've never had to contact the US Embassay before boarding a flight - maybe this is for countries outside of the UK? If you're not convinced I suggest ringing your airline and making sure. I'm pretty sure you don't need to though, you just have to fill in a quick form on the plane and that's the end of it.<br>  <br>  Make sure your passport is in order through, my 14 year old cousin got held back at Immigration for five hours because they thought her passport had been cancelled. Enjoy your trip!|`|a1esFJ53aa	I think you have to apply for an ESTA|`|cN6AMupIaa	you used to get a green card to fill in but now you have to go online to the US embassy site and fill in your details at least 48 hours before you go or they will not let you get on the plane at the airport.

i7oHTo9haa	Throughout history each generation has had a group of people that thinks it is end times or coming very soon. When things don't happen then they realize oh, it was just a regular world event. There just really is no way to link scripture with world events or any other sign, it just has to happen.    In my particular Jewish perspective, Moshiach comes when the world is inherently good or inherently bad. I still see things at 50/50.     To let you know there doesn't have to be some great battle so if you're talking about what's going on in Gaza that has been going on alot longer than just recently.  So just don't go by that and please don't think there has to be war for the end times prophecy to come true, as that is not the case. Inherently bad can be when people are selfish and gluttonous and uncaring and vanity and all those other idol worshiping things are bad qualities too.    We can strive for good and try to make it happen in a good way, by repairing the world and having people help themselves and help and respect each other.      And that doesn't mean war is bad, sometimes war is necessary, for good people to defend themselves.  War by itself doesn't mean the world is going bad and tilting the scales in the wrong direction.    One thing though, every time there is an economy downturn people start talking about war.  It's during the weak economy that people start looking into the outside world and investigating what's up.  When in good times, good economy they are all out on vacation or pleasure cruises etc. oblivious to what's going on.  So it's kind of hyped up, no worry, it doesn't mean anything is imminent.  We'll just deal with things as they come along.|`|B5Y46XBoaa	If you mean what I think you mean by "the terminal generation" then even from the Christian perspective the answer is no, because prophecy says that time won't come for at least another thousand+ years.|`|8AzKTFwoaa	No  The problem with signs is this, if you're looking for them you will convince yourself you've found them.|`|aI3WsnnEaa	Well, I am not sure what has happened in Jerusalem.

g54r6hqFaa	Your best bet is to call a moving company to give you an estimate to move you...There are factors on what you are moving and if you are going to move you stuff up and down stairs...how many boxes...and bulky items...a lot may have to do with square feet of stuff you have which decides what size truck to use and how many guys it will take to move you.    It would be ignorant to try and tell you an amount of $ without seeing your situation.|`|q22ngVmkaa	About $1000 - best to pack it yourself and just get a move done.|`|yRdcEkZJaa	a moving company is very expensive and you never really know how much it is going to cost. They go by weight so you wont find out till the day you move. I have heard horror stories about different company's ripping people off. When I made a big move i ended up just doing it myself. We went through penske truck rental with a hitch to tow my car. It ended up being the cheapest way. I think $1200 with everything included the extra insurance. good luck! Oh AAA got me a small discount.|`|Wscsgyd5aa	You can probably find a mover for $3,000-5,000. Since you don't have a lot of stuff hire 2 or 3  mexican day laborers, pay them $40-60 bucks each, have them load up your stuff in a u-haul you rented and haul the stuff yourself. The problem is you will probably have to unload the stuff yourself unless you want to hire strangers who will know what you have and where you live.|`|iv9T4Ctgaa	Probably more than you may want to spend.  My step-son moved from Colorado Springs, CO, to Newport News, VA (approx. 1800 miles?).  He rented a 16' Budget truck and moved himself. The one way truck rental cost about $700 (without insurance add-ons).  Car dollies or trailers are available.  I'm guessing that if you contact some of the reputable moving companies then compare their cost to a DITY (Do-It- Yourself) move, you may find the DITY to be far more economical.    Good luck & remember to lift with your legs and not your back.

3ee64ee7ec766828c5143beacd3dc7f6aa	Seeing as California's got as much territory as at least three or four other states back East, and as many different types of landscape, weather, populations, climates and cultures as you can get, depending on where in the state you live, describing it is pretty complicated.      I've lived in San Francisco all my life, and it's one of the great cities of the world, at the same time international and provincial, breathtaking and occasionally ugly; multi-racial, multi-cultural, creative, pretty accepting of all kinds of folks and attitudes.         Other places in California are very different in style and outlook from San Francisco and the Bay Area, and appeal to many other folks.         Other answers you'll get will likely reflect some of those other places.        On the whole, California's an okay state to live in. Opportunities to learn, grow, and advance, room to explore, experiment, and make your own lifestyle. You get out of it what you bring to it, but you can usually make something of what you bring to it.         I don't know if its the best place in the world, but I know I'm grateful to live here.|`|L9A81Xvvaa	Well why wont you ask us Californian in the travel section then click on United States, then click on the following cities: Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, and San Francisco?

1df31c9db3dcca4d09a9e2c45066a64caa	Have a calendar that your wife can cross (X) off the days when you are gone as they wake up. This way they can count down the time until you come back. Each day they wake brings them closer to your return. I had that done for my daughter for just over a week when she was very little. Having her mom with her will help her accept it easier.IF all else fails, be sure to send a snail mail (LoL) to tell them you miss them.<br>  <br>  Your wife may find the calendar a help or a hurt,depending on how that time passes. IF you could have a computer along (lap top) to email at times that'd be much easier as she'd feel there is some contact. Try using a cellphone if there is reception and you can call at times also.
S1uPEgbTaa	1)Albanians in Greece are immigrants and not citizens.

You mean Arvanites, the people that were sucrifized for building our country, Greece? Why did they say that they were fighting for a free Albania back then and they fought for having a 'Romeiko' State, a Greek State???<br>  About your Slavomacedonians? I don't really know about their gens and I'm not interested, their culture and their language is slavic and balkanian, anyone can come up and say that he is an ancient Romean, Dacian, me can come out and say I'm descendant of the ancient Amazones, we live in a democratic society and we have the right to identify ourselves as we want to. <br>  Identifing a minority is another thing, but still I'd like this to happen exactly because everyone will see that you are a small group of people, which just happen to serve another interests (of another country).|`|gVIcEoNRaa	Thats because a minority of 3000 people of Slavic origin exists in Greece already, a Moslem minority of 120 000 people has been acknowledged and because there is no Albanian minority in Greece.<br>  <br>  But, just in case you are referring to Albanians working in Greece, they are nothing more or less but registered financial immigrants.|`|9e250a05d954f6c73a9b8b369c78dd43aa	Has anybody in here actually read History?<br>  Ignorance is nothing but an incapability to learn it.|`|gm9QYLjIaa	It's dumb and foolish thing to think that recognizing minorities is a good thing. Not recognizing minorities means accepting everyone as citizens and seeing everyone as equals aka what a republic does. I don't know about Greece, but in the case of Turkey, during the Ottoman Empire minorities existed. This ceased with the help of the Lausanne Treaty an since those minorities gained Turkish citizenship and the separation (they couldn't participate in politics and stuff like that) was lifted. What you're asking Greece to do is legally deny some rights to people living in the country leading up to discrimination. Learn to differentiate the word "minority" from "ethnic/cultural/religious group"<br>  <br>  Seriously grow up and realize what you're talking about.<br>  <br>  Zoi: That's true, the word "Turk" was used as an insult, referring mostly to villagers up until the appearance of the Young Turks (funny enough those who called themselves Young Turks were not always ethnic Turks, most of them were Jews residing in the Ottoman Empire like Emanuel Karasu, the nephew of the guy who invented Danone).<br>  Edit 2: I'm sorry, you are absolutely right there were no Greeks in the Young Turks (It's common sense, I don't know why I typed Greeks, sorry) but the Jews didn't actually have to convert to Islam like Karasu who said that he was a Turk above being a jew (ok I'm going on a limb here I'm not sure if he was the one saying that but you get the point :p)|`|U8NxHz51aa	They don't accept the existence of the minorities because they are scared of loosing the myth of greeks "pure nation".<br>  They are scared from the truth, and ashamed from the evils that they made!<br>  So they find this stupid excuses like: Macedonians are only 3000 people, and Albanians are just immigrants<br>  So first learn to number (in the case with Macedonians and Turks), and second the problem of the Albanian immigrants, just like the immigration, is your problem, a sign that your Government can't do a good job, like keeping your borders!|`|BgouZaeSaa	Hi if you worry about minorities just check how greek minority in Albania or in Turkey have rights.If you check you will see that Greeks in Albania can't go to greek school,can't celebrate easter and they can't speak greek.In Turkey are few greeks there because they forced them to go from their homes if you heard 'Mikrasiatiki catastrophe''<br>  And when you check all these see how they are in Greece.We respect all immigrants some of them don't respect us.I hope your next questions to be about greek minority in Albania..|`|5m4yaEJyaa	RENGIM Please let the readers know what the great Ottoman Empire thought of its minority Greeks, Armenians, and Assyrians...basically they never recognized their right to life because they were Christian and infidels...so Turks used WWI as an excuse to kill 2 million of its own Christian minorites and now you want Greece to say ok let's forget about the past, what can we do to help you kill the rest of us. Not going to happens, and oh yeah, Turkey should stop requesting to join European Community, never going to happen, Turkey not Christian, still hasn't recognized Armenian Genocide, considers the Kurdish minority as Mountain Turks...common your country has serious complex issues...as for the Albanians they were originally Christian but 70% of them converted to Islam during Ottoman rule to have a better status while the 30% Christian Albanians became their slaves. As for Macedonians = Greeks, Alexander and all the other Greeks lived in geographic area 500 BC, the Slavs move into the north in 6th century AD (1,000 years after the Greeks were already there)...as for the Muslim Greeks living in Greece they are protected by the Lausanne Treaty and their numbers grew from 60 thousand in 1923 to 120,000 (Greek, Slavic, and Turkic Muslims) BUT where did all the Greeks of Istanbul go, and the Greeks from the islands of Tenedos and Imbros, very few left, so if you do the math the minorities in Greece are doing just fine, while some of our neighbour are hypocrits. Please give me an analytical historical response.|`|ZwG5aAVyaa	Well, for now we have only accepted that there are aliens in outer space.<br>  There is no Turkish minority.<br>  Don't confuse Turks with Muslims.<br>  Learn history bro, i can't write down the History of Balkans everytime a dumba$s like you make these kind of questions.<br>  Get a job.|`|a6p6zaYFaa	quit your complaining.

We went to Sandals in St Lucia for our honeymoon at the end of last year for about 8 days but we wanted to do it right so we got one of the nicest rooms they have.  Probably spent around $5,000 and it was completely worth every penny.  But we probably could've done it for $2,000 for the cheapest room.  Didn't hear great things about the cheap rooms though!  We had a 2 story villa with our own pool and a butler.. amazing.  We don't ever spend money like that but it was our honeymoon and we will never forget it.  The wedding goes by in two seconds - the honeymoon is when you get to relax and enjoy!

AA11937736	You can get from central Paris to CDG airport in just about 35 minutes on the RER so there is simply no point in staying physically close to the airport.

I am a consultant and frequently will negotiate excellent rates for long term stays.     If you expect 30 hotel nights over the next year or so then you should be able to get something negotiated.    Otherwise, use priceline|`|dPx4Bqc1aa	hotwire.com
0WASp0bHaa	To live in Schaumburg, rent etc. will be on the high side. Schaumburg is a very busy area, with lots of shopping and restaurants. Huge malls, theaters, colleges. Lots to do in the area.

Or check with the Ministry of Motor Vehicles???<br>  <br>  They'll be MUCH more likely to give you the information than you will be finding this person through an international American-based question and answer site.|`|4hz7xbPSaa	hey! thats me! y r u asking this??|`|zg82CYzIaa	im gunna go nick that car now :)|`|Nlo0bk48aa	its mine!|`|HDZyPMMJaa	why has it rammed you off the road!|`|ZZkInusMaa	i live there and have seen that car about but i dont no who it belongs to and this is a weird way to find out lol !
bGdTivxqaa	Metro in Moscow / Moscow subway includes 278,3 km. of rails, 12 lines and 172 stations (including light rail).<br>  <br>  Average interval between the trains (time starting with departure of one train until arrival of the next train) comprises of 2.5 minutes.  <br>  <br>  The shortest time, minimum interval happens in rush hour and is 90 seconds.  <br>  <br>  The longest interval is 10 minutes, for example at night on the weekends.  Low usage lines have an interval around 4-5 minutes.|`|BLD9EEWNaa	When I have been there, usually in the summer it has taken from two to five minutes to wait for the train, at most.  (During the day.  Towards midnight, it take more like fifteen minutes)|`|7sIYGEnmaa	It closes at 1 a.m. Before that time, trains are very fast and intervals are minutes.|`|4WxJvc5Raa	90 seconds... is common.|`|tfotPdeZaa	two minutes. theres a lot of people so theres a lot of trains. hardly any waiting. :)
6e801dc2d4cb4e651c8b24905ccb9bacaa	Supershuttle -- pick it up outside arrivals -- look for the Blue & yellow sign - is $14.00 to the Port.   Cab is $24.00 flat rate.  For 2 or more together cab is the better deal.|`|7HEZhx46aa	The CHEAPEST way is to walk. The SAFEST way is to take a taxi. It's not that far from the airport to the Port of Miami, so unless you get stuck in rush hour traffic, it'll probably cost you less than $30. There MAY be shuttle service, but you'd have check with the information desk when you get to Miami.
g4APbW4Naa	Probably to avoid confusion with the New York City police - which uses the acronym NYPD.  If you look at the logo quickly, you might confuse NYFD and NYPD (depending on what font is used).  Only a tiny bit of one letter is different.<br>  <br>  When you see FDNY, there's no possible confusion with NYPD.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Fire Department of New York....don't see why there is a problem.<br>  <br>  it isn't a "Fire Brigade".  If it were, then there would be a B where the D is, in either case.|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	Because, my friend, its acronym stands for the Fire Department City of New York. The FDNY is the largest municipal fire service in the United States, with approximately 11,600 uniformed officers and firefighters and over 3,200 uniformed EMTs and paramedics. <br>  <br>  The FDNY is one of the oldest fire brigades in the country, dating back to the 1640s. Their motto is "New York's Bravest."<br>  <br>  I hope this information is very helpful.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  Native New Yorker|`|R3ghjVscaa	Is stands for Fire Department of New York or New York City Fire Department.|`|paerqxfMaa	It's an acronym for the Fire Department of New York.

kgBPU4xxaa	First, a car is useless in Cinque Terre anyway. You can get around by walking the trails, taking the boat, or using the train. It's a beautiful place; I go three or four times a year from where I live. It's a good place for hiking, exploring the small towns, and there is some swimming. I prefer to stay in Monterosso mostly because ther are more options for the train on arriving and departing. This is the site I use for booking hotels her in Italy: <a href="http://www.venere.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.venere.com/</a>|`|896406d7dedb37c4ef791414e98ee7d9aa	Cinque Terre is not nice is...marvellous! I rented a flat for some years in Corniglia and it was so relaxing and peaceful going there for week-ends.<br>  Cinque Terre means 'Five Lands' because they are 5 villages (Rio Maggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza, Monterosso) facing the sea and connected by train or by a wonderful trail (a part of it is called the Trail of Love). By car is a bit more complex. You can walk, bath on summer and have a good time.. Watch at the link below and enjoy Cinque Terre!|`|224a7eaaf46eec4d949ffc56fb6e1c6faa	it is just super wonderful...like a honeymoon place to go, very romatic and unique  must see|`|zQB0kEmcaa	Very small but quaint and connected via a small train system...

There are some really expensive places, and then there are places that aren't very expensive at all. <br>  <br>  It helps to ask around among people you work with or go to school with about where they go, so you can find a place that is affordable but do a good job.|`|f6UkOjpAaa	usually whatever the average prices are in nyc..call around brooklyn or wherever ur goin in nyc and ask for prices...but believe me ur gonna need a lot of money to visit yet alone to buy stuff.|`|odc3Y1edaa	jump the fence for free|`|1d718ff96585004e8d1e8bc312c3655daa	It's not expensive, if you know where to go.  For a haircut, I'm not entirely sure - I have a good friend who does my hair for a very discounted price, but if you'd like a skilled stylist, it can run from $40-$100 for a cut and style.  As for cosmetics, it really depends on where and what you'd like - you can go to Sephora and possibly spend about $100-$150 for the basics like foundation, powder, eyeliner, eye shadow and mascara per visit.  If you go, say, twice in the three months, you should be looking at $300, or $400 at the VERY most.  I'm not entirely sure what else you would need - for tweezers to do your eyebrows, you can go to Duane Reade or Walgreens and buy them yourself for $10, or you can have them done at a salon from anywhere between $15 and $30.  <br>  <br>  I can assure you - it will NOT cost you $1000 for 3 months worth of cosmetics, unless you're buying the expensive stuff from Macy's.  Sephora has wonderful brands, especially their own brand, that's pricier than Wal-Mart or Target, lol, but much less so than the department stores.|`|NelWFq5Paa	about 50.00-75.00 to get a hair cut and to get cosmetics you need about anther 1.000 for the 3 months|`|eMXerZ98aa	cheap.=] really cheap.
1EhbLBkUaa	Where are you (or, where is the destination for the shipment)?  How is it shipped? "Standard" doesn't say much. Standard air? Standard ground?  Standard boat?  Standard FedEx?  It might be a couple days to several weeks, depending on how far it's travelling and how it's sent.  In addition, there's whatever time the shipper takes to actually get it in the hands of the shipping company.  <br>  <br>  Your best bet would be to ask the person who sold it to you, they would have more information.
hhWDHmfyaa	Get to Sonoma and cross over the bay into Marin County.<br>  Take 101 over the Golden Gate and follow the signs to SFO.<br>  <br>  You should be traffic free until you hit 101 in Novato.<br>  If you get to Novato by 8:30, you will be at SFO at 10am with no problems.
NXBmcEz7aa	To save you a lot of trouble, buy one here in Thailand.  They are a lot cheaper than from the States and won't have any problem operating it.  If ever you will have any, the shop where you bought it will  be there to fix it for you.|`|AA10254694	Many TVs can be switched from NTSC to Pal in the menu  and some may even be able to switch from 110 volt to 220 but by the time you pay to ship it an pay the import duty you'd be better off buying one in Thailand.|`|lDbNf3h9aa	No.Thailand is PAL, US is NTSC.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	No. They use two different TV systems.In the US, we use NTSC. In Thailand they use PAL. All you'd get is static/ snow. Power requirements are also different.<br>  EDIT: what I said is a fact,and I get a thumbs down? You on crack,or what?|`|q2AsDnjpaa	No the plugs are different|`|Vlp50eEGaa	No way.|`|nhYABprkaa	YES you can if its a PAL/NTSC  TV and it can take 120v & 220V current.<br>  <br>  A cheap TV in Thailand will cost roughly 2500 baht to start and will be all ready to go, Thats your best option!|`|n0NMAPA6aa	NO
