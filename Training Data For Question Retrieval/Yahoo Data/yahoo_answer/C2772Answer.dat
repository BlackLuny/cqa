I love El Pollo Loco, but I moved and they don't have it here.  Subway is okay in a pinch, but they don't put nearly as much meat on their sandwiches as their advertising implies, and in fact is the skimpiest on meat out of all the sandwich places around.  Togo is the best, but we don't have that here either.   Waaah!!!|`|8c93b08d0ef73b87abf803c1344c16e1aa	I like the Subway. I don't know this Crazy Chicken place, but I'm interested.  OH!

Rlsr4zhCaa	The eastside has been hit pretty hard with store closings and stuff. Business is bad. I don't think many people are hiring at all unless you have a ton of experience. Even then I think it's pretty slim. Sorry.
lzEuuseJaa	What about Mexican food -- Taco Bell or El Pollo Loco? You can eat something soft, lots of that on the menu. Just drink lots of water to get the tortilla out of your teeth.    You can eat *almost* anything! Just watch hard stuff like broccoli (my son was glad to hear that was off his plate!), uncooked apples and carrots, popcorn and sticky stuff, like caramels or gummies. And watch the sugar. Lots of kids get their braces off and they have a ton of cavities underneath. Ouch.    Take smaller bites than usual, concentrate on eating on your back teeth for awhile until you learn what you can safely eat. You don't want to knock a bracket off your teeth.     Oh, and when you eat anything now, take a look at your braces afterwards, there will be some stuff you won't want to eat when you can't brush real well afterward. My son doesn't eat PB&J for lunch at school anymore, pretty gross on braces! But cheese sandwiches with not super soft bread seems to work better.     My son put wax on his braces the first couple of days to avoid getting sores in his mouth. The trick is to do this BEFORE you have any pain, if you feel anything, USE WAX! His friends didn't and they ended up with ouchy sores and at that point wax won't do any good.    Ask your orthodontist if you can use a battery-operated flosser. They have a little stick flosser that goes between your teeth and it vibrates to clean. Much easier than the other type of floss. They're about $10 at Target.|`|jFBAk2Auaa	Try Buca di beppo  on Town center. Really good family italian food.
JfVxCDb7aa	Sure why not, there are all kinds of veggie things available at pizza hut, all their pizzas with only veggie toppings.|`|3F8bCZ55aa	Sure.|`|AA10232957	only if your first date was to mcdonalds. Seriously, if you want a third date, you need to take her to a nice sit down style restaurant. at lest applebees or chilis or outback or something like that. better yet, take her to a small, local restaurant that you know. Unless you are 14 or something, pizza hut is really a crappy place to take a date|`|f08acadf20db255caa972f1c2ebf2c7eaa	Most pizza places like ,Pizza Hut,Domino's and Little Caesars ,use and artificial cheese .It's dirt cheap ,probably  1/2 the price as real Mozz and it's not good for your arteries because it's made from oil. If they use real cheese they usually have it in their advertising and have a trade mark on their packaging ,Real Cheese.|`|i3PGjRRfaa	Burger King is better for a second date.  Get her one of those Pissed Off Onion Whoppers................|`|8TW00N9Daa	It depends are you 12 and having your Mom drive you?  Are you a poor college student that can barely afford a night out?  Then yes, Pizza Hut might be a good place(Although all the Pizza Huts in my area are take out only).  If you are a grown man/women then at least upgrade to the Olive Garden.|`|l8Q3n8WUaa	NOOOOOOO dats like going to mcdonalds just fast, plain n simple! for a second date go somewhere more nice.. im sorry im not a vegetarian so i wouldnt know where to go im just telling u dont go to pizza hut.|`|fQOxUstCaa	I have actually done this before|`|Wpulf29Maa	No. I'm a woman who pays a lot of attention to things like this when guys take me out....I would expect to go to somewhere like Red Lobster.

Take your date to a LOCAL Italian restaurant! Or some other LOCAL place. The service will be better. It will be more romantic and probably the same price.     Taking your date to pizza hut is sooo trashy.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	God No!  She can't eat the pasta as they put meat in it.  Take her to the olive garden for real pasta.  She can eat the soup or salad with bread sticks.  Any chain usually has salads, but I love the bread at O.G.    Worked for the Hut for several years.  The pasta sucks anyway.|`|13JdKfSdaa	eww I hate Pizza Hut

Aej3lgQZaa	Nutrition, taste, cost and speed are linked.     Things that are caloricly dense taste really good even when very cheaply and quickly made. There are many very high fat and sugary substances that taste great and are cheap. Foods that are good for you cost more. This is part of the reason obesity strikes the poor the most.     Foods that are good for you might be able to be made faster, but they generally spoil more quickly (fresh fruits and veggies), or cost more (seafood and other leaner protein sources).    Subway is healthy. Try eating there. It is a bit slower to get food there, since they make it in front of you, but it's still quite quick.|`|4eLzY2hfaa	they promote "super sizing"  when they shouldn't have to.  when you're full, you're full.  "secret" sauce, what's in it? i bet you can't buy it through weight watchers.  occasionally fast food is OK, but, not 2 meals daily.  just watch what's in the meal that you order. use common sense!  if we don't watch what we eat, the government will try to do it for us, and we should  know by now they can't do anything right!|`|vtmvud6eaa	The first fast food restaurants sold hamburgers don't know why they went with that but because they were successful that started a trend of burger joints. Then someone got sick of burgers and decided to offer pizzas then that was the beginning of the pizzerias, Subway decided to offer a healthier option now you have a series of sandwiches shops.  Maybe someone will start a salad bar craze. We can only hope.|`|8c93b08d0ef73b87abf803c1344c16e1aa	I don't see where you're going with your line of questioning, and it is a line, isn't it. I'm in Weight Watchers - lifetime member as I've met my goal - and I can eat "healthy" at most fast food places. You have to be selective. Of course, some I "select" to drive past. Peace.|`|AA11993919	Trans fat, grease, people that work there that are nasty themelves.|`|ejelObdJaa	because they make it so fast dat its gotta be unhealthy. + people eat them because they taste gooodd lol.|`|HctqSv07aa	because most of the food has to much grease and people get fat from that...not ot be rude|`|bcf7a2c1f796dae80ef7307cbe47430faa	Because making 'fast food', it is easiest to make food faster with unhealthy ingredients for the most part. Although fast food is generally unhealthy for you, but places like subways is pretty good, if you get the right sub without the transfat and the calories and no mayonnaise and whatnot. But generally, it's probably easier to make 'fast food' with unhealthy ingredients.|`|evEJxv06aa	because they make you fat and some give problems to your body right and some are just not good for you at all and eating healthy makes your body and you strong and perfect.|`|JfVxCDb7aa	they sell the best. McDOnalds could offer pineapple, but it wouldn't sell well enough for them to justify "taking up the space" of their restaurant.|`|69bp1IMfaa	All of them are.|`|f08acadf20db255caa972f1c2ebf2c7eaa	Because they taste good.|`|VNpZPjZ3aa	GREASE|`|maSqXCdEaa	because deep frying is a fast and simple method of cooking.

5wufIH1Haa	If its something easily made (like say a grilled cheese, or BLT) with other ingredients on the menu I am sure most places are happy to oblige. You just have to wonder about the cost of adding/subtracting certain items (like bacon would of course be something to pay more for) because the people who are ringing up the order can only add certain things since they are not actual items on the menu. Thus the cost would be higher.|`|OGJ4LlD7aa	I dont think the cheesy gordita crunch is on the taco bell menu... but i get it every time i go there|`|R9AAhsIjaa	It's not a food, but Starbucks offers a "short" cappuccino that isn't on the menu.

In short, I would have to agree with you that Burger King does certainly make a better tasting hamburger.  However, if you are ordering chicken (nuggets or strips depending on the restaurant), then I would give the edge to Mickey D's.  Fries are a toss up - some people really like the stringy McDonald's variety, and some like the extra "potatoey" flavour of BK's.  In terms of promotions, BK has had some good ones - Spiderman, Indiana Jones, etc, and McDonald's really only has the Monopoly once per year (where I usually gain 10lbs trying to win something).    To sum up, if you like a flame-broiled tasting hamburger of course you're going to like BK better.  I sure do.|`|xKA4ZCWcaa	BK ALL THE   WAY

iwe9KUckaa	Hi there! First of all, good luck at your new job! :)    I've been serving for a long time, and I find that I am tipped better when I create a relationship between the table and myself. Be friendly, with a nice, and sincere smile when you greet them, introduce yourself (Hi, my name is ___, and I'll be taking care of you today?). Always repeat back their order. I find that guests really appreciate positive feedback on what they are choosing to order (Excellent choice, or That's my favorite thing we have!). Also, be knowledgable of your menu in case they have any questions. Keep an eye on their drinks, and keep water refilled. They should never have an empty glass. Also, pre-bus any dirty plates. Check back on them after delivering drinks before the food, 3 bites or 3 minutes after they begin their meal, and once before you ask about desserts. I always drop the check (after writing Thank You! on the check), and let them know I can take it whenever they are ready, but no rush. When I pick up the check I also tell them "I'll be right back with your change."    The best advice I can give is BE YOURSELF :) Be friendly, positive, and sincere, and let your personality shine! Best of luck at your new job!!|`|nAMG94l9aa	I've been a server off/on for 22 years at many different places. I have  several great stories, bad and good. First thing is never come to work in a bad mood. There many things that can happen before you get to work that day, but check it at the door. Ur guests can tell within the first few seconds after greeting them that u are not in good spirits. Never let one bad experience with one table ruin it for the next table. Brush it off and chaulk it up to a lesson learned. Try and do whatever it takes to make ur tables feel welcomed and appreciated, not to mentioned invite them back. Ur tips depend on it. Most people can be very nice, while the unchosen few can be very mean and ungreatful. Those are the ones u have to work harder to please. Now, u can't make everybody happy, but just knowing that u tried is all u can hope for. I work in a touristy type town, so many of the customers don't live in my area, and most are first time visitors, but a lot of them return on thier next vacation. Some will even remember u from thier previous visit . Most impotantly>>>> Smile!!!|`|OTrTnFC0aa	I waited tables to pay my way through college, and I'm awesome at it! I've worked at a steakhouse and a breakfast/lunch cafe. Be peppy, clean, and dress to impress. It really makes a difference, look your best. Also, create relationships with regulars and remember their quirks and requests. Don't be too pushy with promotions/specials, but always mention them. I always write a little note on the check as well. Good luck!|`|AA10373027	be quick, accurate, and friendly.|`|ljFBfguRaa	Upsale! Recommend an appetizer, dessert, or more expensive dish.  Know the food, so when they ask what's good you can honestly tell them. If they end up really liking it, more tip!  Overall, just be outgoing and friendly people always like to have an "experience" with their food. More than just a typical, boring server!|`|xhqKLSwCaa	Be happy, confident and lighthearted. When taking orders repeat back what they order to help you remember even if you write it down.  Keep the tables cleared, don't let glasses and plates pile up. Pushing drinks helps (a buzz loosens the wallet)  Be friendly and smile.|`|MJvL013yaa	I've been all over this a million times, and the BIG DEAL is drink refills. I also thank my peeps for coming out (Chicago- bad weather right now, and business is so slow). Upsell. and always say "I'll be right back with your change". Apparently this is a huge deal. Never assume you're being tipped.

EQ27zn0saa	You wouldn't look weird. If I saw someone on his or her laptop at a restaurant I wouldn't think much of it. They'll let you stay, why wouldn't they? you paid for their food, you have the right to stay. I'd say just (at the end) leave some food on your plate so it looks like you're still eating.|`|DTBbQbfLaa	that is kinda weird at a nicer, sit-down restaurant.  i would check with the staff at the place and see if they mind you doing that.|`|chlGzFQlaa	Hmm.... Proabaly if it is a high end one, but if it is just an average one, I don't think anyone would mind. Why not a coffee shop? It looks so sick for some reason when someone is working out on a laptop sipping a cup of coffee looking slick lolz. Don't worry about what other people might think, I frankly think that it wouldn't be that weird though.     Oh and yeah, it depends on if its rush hour or something and there are people waiting for tables, then they would ask you to leave, but if it gets just moderate business and there's always a spare table, I think you'll be okay. (Take Layla's advice, eat slowly, keep a little bit of food on your plate always, just to give the restaurant the impression that you're still chowing chung)|`|MQVmh5hiaa	You know you shouldn't even care what they say.

You might get away with typing up whilst waiting for your food to arrive, but if you're planning on using the keyboard while you eat, you aren't going to notice too much what goes in your mouth - so go for somewhere cheaper.    The management isn't going to be too thrilled, either, when you sit there for the whole night taking up a table that someone else could be using for it's proper purpose (paying for and eating a meal, then vacating the space for someone else to use).|`|MMijhs5maa	About the staying after thing. If the place is really fancy then they will probably have a lot of people waiting to be seated. I would suggest you leave once you're done. If you want a place without noise go to the library.
