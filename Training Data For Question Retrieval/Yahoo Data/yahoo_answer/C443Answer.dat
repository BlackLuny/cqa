3cf889cb44f8e947ff2bbf4e75b372cdaa	The color Taupe refers to the French name for the European Mole, Talpa europaea.<br>  <br>  Originally, the name of the color referred only to the average color of the French mole, but like the colors pink and lavender, the name expanded (in the case of taupe beginning in the 1940s) to encompass a wide range of varying shades. It seems that this occurred because the color of the fur of the mole can itself exhibit a wide range of shades, from gray through yellowish, brownish, and even purplish.<br>  <br>  The various shades of the color taupe are widely used in fashion, interior design, and industrial design.<br>  <br>  The first use of taupe as a color name in English was in the early 1800s (exact year is not known).<br>  <br>  example:<br>  <a href="http://hopefaithandcharity.com/images/uploads/satin-taupe.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://hopefaithandcharity.com/images/up...</a>|`|7560a22e319cdff4a304173bdfea411eaa	Color Coordinates<br>  1 Taupe -  RGB (red, green, blue) (72, 60, 50) <br>  2 Purple Taupe - RGB (r, g, b) (80, 64, 77) <br>  3 Medium Taupe - RGB (r, g, b) (103, 67, 71) <br>  4 Rose Taupe - RGB (r, g, b) (145, 95, 109) <br>  5 Mauve Taupe - RGB (r, g, b) (175, 134, 142) <br>  6 Sandy Taupe - RGB (r, g, b) (150, 113, 23) <br>  7 Pale Taupe (Mouse) - RGB (r, g, b) (188, 152, 126) <br>  8 Taupe Gray - RGB (r, g, b) (139, 133, 137)|`|439f9961aaf08a80871ccafbb4cdcffcaa	It's a brownish-gray color.|`|1e8ef2803e2665b408c9561cae653000aa	taup is most like the color of a mushroom after it was cooked,plus add a little grey to it=taup!|`|58952a9b5ed7c54f2728b9fea1ffe3a6aa	Taupe is a dusky brownish grey color.<br>  <br>  The color refers to the French name for the European Mole, Talpa europaea.

They are inexpensive and available at the supermarkets.  You cannot let the clothes sit around the house after they have been washed, you need to get them "preserved" right away, otherwise they will absorb the smoke smell all over again.<br>  <br>  Put all your t-shirts and sweatshirts in them.  Jeans in another.  So on and so forth.<br>  <br>  Sorry to say this, but your furniture dresser probably smells of smoke, so laundering the clothes and placing them back in there won't be of any use.  An option for the dresser is to get cedar blocks, available at specialty stores.  It will freshen up the wood in the dresser and help the clothes smell better.<br>  <br>  Put dryer sheets in each of the bags, by the way, that way they won't smell of plastic either.<br>  <br>  I would keep some clothes for home separate, not in bags, for when you know you won't be going anywhere and you know you can't escape.

The storage unit has a bar inside on which clothing can be hung.  I am able to get 4 or 5 suits and several shirts into one unit.

28c2ea3c0322bf6217fb0995e20e080faa	It is the safety device that checks the operation of the fan as you wouldn't want the boiler firing up if the fan wasn't running. They are sometimes 3 wires with a normally closed and a normally open but sometimes just 2 wires. In either case the pcb checks that the air pressure switch isn't stuck on before starting the fan so that it won't fire up if fan fails even if aps faulty.<br>  <br>  Michael N has quite an important point. Boilers have what is called a pre purge period whereby the fan runs for a short while before the ignition sequence starts. If the gas valve was letting by gas this would clear this gas out prior to the spark being generated thus avoiding an explosion. This pre purge is supervised by the APS.|`|OwCUYWeUaa	The air pressure switch is to prevent the unit from firing without a proper draft.  A draft inducer motor pulls air through the combustion chamber and blows the exhaust up the flue.  The air pressure switch "sees" the draft and gives the ignition device the ok to fire the burners.  If it doesn't sense the draft at the beginning of the heating cycle, or loses it during the heating cycle, the unit locks out.|`|mHsvX7UWaa	This switch ensures that the fan is working correctly and prevents the ignition sequence starting when there is a fault. This prevents the possibility of explosion should the fan fail to start. If it stuck on the on position it would prevent the start sequence, so if the fan wont run it is probably this switch.

98tUW1Y7aa	Our neighbor had the same problem. At first he tried to get someone to remove the bees. However they all said they would have to kill the bees. In view of the shortage of honey bees he did not want to do that. All the companies contacted wanted $300 plus to kill the bees. Eventually fearing a child would be stung. Our neighbor tackled the swarm with a spray. He covered himself well, and did it at night when all the bees were back in the nest. It worked and the nest fell out of the tree and the bees died. This was in Florida. He even phoned the bee keepers association of West Palm Beach but they did not what to know.

gY61GJu6aa	OMG!!! this happened to me last summer and the smell was just UNBEARABLE. Unfortunately you cant really do anything about it. The smell comes from a decomposing body of a rat. You are not gonna like this, but no amount of spray of ANY KIND will get rid of the odor. all it will do is worsen the smell... you wouldn't like a flowery or fruity smelling decomposing rat. Not even the odor neutralizer spray worked. <br>  You will just have to wait for he rat to completely decompose then the foul smell will just go away. In my case it took 3 days for the smell to die down, their will still be a faint smell but it will disappear as soon as the rat is just bare bones. What you can do while waiting for the decomposition to finish is just stay away from the smelly area in your house. Also buy a minty rub ie vicks and put some near your nostril --- it worked for me.|`|wX3P9Tlcaa	this won't help much but a dead animal in your wall will soon dry out ,then you won't smell it anymore . continue using cover odors till then . might try those plug in air fresheners.|`|mRgRDhMQaa	Put a strong smelling drying sheet in the vent. I heard someone did that with Gain dryer sheets and it makes the house smell really good.

8quTABk6aa	Do you have a canister vacuum?  If so, take any attachments off and let it run (like an air cleaner).<br>  <br>  Also, you could try opening the windows, putting a fan opposite of the windows, and running the fan.<br>  <br>  Or, you could purchase an air cleaner.  It should get a lot of the particulate matter.|`|a13EBBmUaa	i don't know were you live but my problem was the dust got in my cold air return and heat ducts (gas furnace) we would clean but still got dusty we changed furnace filters every other day for a week or two and shop vac ed all duct work we could hope this helps|`|Z0QvOIH0aa	Go to WalMart and get a 20" box fan and put it in the window.

Change furnace filter and get into the duct work as far as possible with a vacuum hose or a shop vac. Keep at what your doing also. This dust is some of the worst to get rid of  GL|`|cMksTuRhaa	Sheetrock/Drywall dust is not good to breathe.  It's so fine.  You need to find a shopvac or just try vacuuming all the nooks and crevices.  I bet Ace hardware (or some place similar)  has shopvacs that you can rent.  You need to make sure to vacuum all your floors, every inch of the windowsill, also open the windows and vacuum that little rail part, do all along the baseboards, in the cabinets, just everywhere.  I would even open the vents if you have central air and vacuum out the ducts as far down as you can reach.  Maybe you should get one of those painters mouth masks while you're at Ace.  Maybe that will help you breathe easier while you're doing this.  Good luck and all the best on your upcoming wedding!

sQtFWaqRaa	Believe it or not I would try a line of chalk. It keeps the ants away so it may keep the worms away. They may not like the taste/feel of the chalk dust. I like the copper idea but this is a much cheaper option. Good luck.|`|944iJNAdaa	Diatomaceous earth works to repel earthworms.  So would any nitrogen fertilizer, or salts.  I suspect they might not cross copper, either (6" of copper - sheeting or screen - stops snails), but I've never seen this tested.|`|DoHaUEziaa	Have you tried weather stripping? If worms are getting in so is the cold/heat. Weather stripping is inexpensive and easy to find at any home improvement store. You could just collect them and put in your garden or other area of the yard for the birds. They love them. Good luck.|`|88SGoW1Iaa	no there is no earthworm deterrent that you can spray. The worms stay in the soil til it is saturated, then they would drown if they don't seek higher ground. They will always travel in search of drier ground when it rains. You could maybe just a new threshold under your door, not just for the worms but just because. If worms can go under your door, then it's not properly sealed. Installing a new threshold is not that advanced, but it can be involved. With some basic construction tools (hammer, nail puller, screwgun, and flatbar) you should be able to install it. The window and door department of your local building supply center can guide you to the proper product, just make sure you have accurate measurements of the doorway's dimensions.|`|59c3b42b981e8e7cddf9e38ed4ba42b6aa	No way man, not unless you kill all your earthworm in your neighborhood. As I've noticed, earthworms only do this thing one time during the year. They come up from underground and they die. It was so stunk sometimes. The only solution I can see is to have your wife get used to it and not freak out every time.<br>  <br>  Sealed the bottom of your door tight so they can't get in. Don't leave any cracks that worm can squeezed in. When that's done put some ashes on the base of the door so the worms will dry out and can't crawl any farther than your door base frame. Worms don't like dry ashes you know. Ashes suck out the water from them and can't go anywhere. I hope these tricks will do.|`|ARUpETXGaa	How about placing a rug or doormat that goes across the whole front of the door.  I don't think that a worm would crawl over the scratchy surface.  I know at Menards or other home improvment stores they sell rug/outdoor carpet that is on a roll and you can buy as many feet as you need.  Give it a try!!!|`|XTmiI44laa	I guess you need to put a shelter for them, try a pail turned on it's side that they can go in.<br>  <br>  Worms are needed in the soil and since you have many you must have good soil.|`|51441Us8aa	Build them an astro-dome and tell them their government cares and help will be on the way soon.

emvIYyufaa	I don't know about Kenmores but I used to work for Whirlpool and the clean light blinking is a complete failure and you'll need service. I'm not a tech so I don't really know the specifics of what causes it but I think it has something to do with the control board, if I am not mistaken. I'd recommend to call Kenmore first and see what they say about it. <br>  <br>  If you are concerned about it running, turn it off at the breaker. You could try resetting the control board by cutting the power for 30 minutes and turning it back on but if that doesn't work, it will definately need service. <br>  <br>  Service would cost quite a bit so if you don't have an extended warrenty or any factory warrenties left on it, I'd probably recommend to just get a new dishwasher. Generally, the service guy charges $50-80 bucks to diagnose it, then charges you for the part (I think a control board is around $300 bucks, without mark-up) and then for his labor. It will likely cost 500+ to get it repaired. So it's really up to you.<br>  <br>  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, especially with such a new unit but definately give Kenmore a call. Good Luck.|`|8n3NvYQwaa	I think you need to call sears and right away..  I would not want your pretty little hands to get dish pan hands....  Grant M|`|AA11577593	depends on how many times its blinking is what your issue is, chances are its a whirlpool made dishwasher, by sears kenmore, if its a three blink sequence chances are its your main control, if its not filling but its running it could be a float switch issue, if there is no water and no washing thats because you have no water without water there will be no waSHING, check for any objects such as spoons or forks in the bottom of the unit or try resetting the unit by turning the circuit breaker off for 30 seconds then turning it back on, see what  happens and if nothing porevails ill answer any other issues.|`|FrTAikNwaa	I am not a pro but have worked on several as maintenance for apartments. The light blinking is a warning, First open the door in the bottom there is a round baseball size cap that is a float switch and sometimes grease will build up and it gets stuck it will be on the side toward the front you can take your hand and see if it slides up or down in your case if you can push it down then it was stuck and simply lift it off and clean the guide it rest on with hot soapy water and put back and try again my guess with out seeing it is this. It wont let the water in if stuck. Also look at the center tower where the water comes out at the bottom it will have a plastic mesh screen see if there is an obstacle like a straw or something protruding out all kinds of things can cause it to get stuck tooth picks,broke glass etc. good luck.

4ec5baf736e5e1b4200f6e39ea8eda12aa	If its plastic in texture then as Nathan says its probably a very old underlay, damp proofing or lino. However, if its grity in texture it may be self leveling cement that has not set properly or has degraded for some reason. Check for damp that may be coming through from the wall or up thro the concrete surface.  You need to remove all the loose material, seal the old concrete surface and then when dry apply a flesh coat of self-levelling cement. Once that has set you can relay your new flooring|`|bxlYleZkaa	Sounds like a self levelling compound of some kind, though why it has never set hard is a mystery.

2uZXCyeBaa	If it's rusted through, it's gotta be pretty old.  Is it galvanized or copper?  How far is it from your house to your barn?  If it were my house, I'd trench down 24 inches and run a new type K copper line.  That'll last longer than you will!  If it's a particularly long run, you could probably use schedule 80 PVC instead.  You also ought to talk to a pro to find out if the soil conditions in your area or any pesticides or fertilizers that you use can cause damage to your pipes.  If so, they can probably suggest a material to surround them with when you backfill the trench.  Also consider future water needs in your bar when you replace this pipe and, if in doubt, go larger.  You can run a bigger line from your well pump to the start of the underground section in the future, but if the underground section is too small you'll have to do this whole thing all over.|`|6O4WTiPQaa	You could try the rubber patch over a rust hole, with a hose clamp around it, clean up the outside of the pipe with a pair of channel lock pliers.|`|IuwgzVCIaa	Yes.But I would be inclined to join it before and after the pond .Therefore allowing access at a future point for maintenance.Use plastic pipe between (mdpe) as it lasts much better.|`|lAsbD5B7aa	Best to replace the pipe, rubber couplers are not that great.

Where I live, several children have died through  cowboy built walls. It all depends on the load bearing of the sub-soil. Saturated sand, and completely dry sand, have little load bearing so you would need to go at least 60cm wide. Firm clay soil is a lot better but does shrink in the warm weather so go 60cm deep. Go deeper if the clay is too soggy though.|`|U6YQAWbQaa	450 mill is adequate.|`|9bXCmvYaaa	18 inches is the norm anywhere. You wont have any problems at all. 18 inches is loads.

OF course you need opposite poles to attract so the other strip (if there is one would require the same process doing but with a magnet of opposite polarity; so you get a North attracting to a South pole.<br>  However; by the time you have sourced two opposite magnets you might as well have bought some new mag strips as the previous comments suggested.

AA10834046	Contact Brinks.  You will have to go through some security measures to do it.
jcauTPLZaa	First off, look inside you boxes. There may be a ground wire hooked up to the box itself, if that's the case you can pig tail a ground wire to a new 3 prong outlet, or just screw it in the frame of the outlet will ground with the screw. If you have metallic sheathing cable ie; mc/bx then the metal sheathing is your ground, install your outlet. If neither case is present, you can by NEC Electrical code install a GFCI outlet, but you must mark it as not being grounded. GFCI's DO NOT require or use a ground to work. Despite whats been said here.|`|zruhNGKbaa	You must replace the outlet using a GFCI outlet and you must install the provided sticker which states "NO EQUIPMENT GROUND" on the outlet cover unless when you open it up you discover that there is a ground wire present in the box which can be used and which tests ok for continuity to the system ground.|`|lAsbD5B7aa	You need to replace them with GFCI outlets for safety. If there is a ground wire in there connect it.|`|8m6fJ6cXaa	yes you can I did.|`|6MkTB6pjaa	No, you should not replace with 3 prong if there is no ground do not use a 3 prong unless you run a ground wire to a suitable ground such as a ground rod otherwise a person plugging in a plug with three prong will have a sense of false security. the purpose of ground is to protect the person and equipment. GFCI will not do anything without a ground wire connected to it|`|7coET3HXaa	You may have a ground wire inside the outlet box.  If that is the case, then you can install a typical 3-prong grounded outlet.  My house was built in 1957, and a ground wire was simply attached to the metal outlet box, but not connected to the outlet.|`|AKrTZqbKaa	Go to Lowes/Home Depot or an electrical store and buy new two prong outlets. I just bought 6 at Home Depot to replace the old ones and one that had a ground for a home inspection. GFCI's need the third wire (ground) to work properly. Disregard the other answers that it is fine because they did it. Good luck to them. You can do it and it will work but is not recommended The only way you can put a 3 prong outlet in there is to change the wiring inside feeding it.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	If you have metallic outlet boxes, that's your ground.<br>  Buy receptacles that have 'ground clips' to ground to a metallic box.<br>  (Theres a liitle brass spring tab on the yoke at the screw that fastens <br>  them to the box.)<br>  They cost a bit more, but it beats having to attach a ground wire to <br>  the box.
tDBRH5U6aa	The bulkhead or soffit is optional. Many homes either leave the space open for storage or run tall cabinets to the ceiling. The choice is yours.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	No you do not need a bulkhead and in your kitchen I wouldn't recommend it.  You need as much space as you can for the cabinetry.  You also don't want the ceiling to appear any lower than it already is.  It's a design choice but many kitchen renovations are taking them out since they aren't necessary.

ZgxiAV4Iaa	Violas are tricky. Its difficult to say if your current seeds are alive. Yet seeds are so cheap it would not hurt you to start over. Violas need a stratification period. Take some seeds and place them on a wet paper towel and place them in the refrigerator for 5 days. Make sure to keep the towel moist. Then place them in the potting soil 1/8th inch deep at 70 to 75 degrees. They like to germinate in the dark. Make sure to keep the soil moist. It should take 14-21 days to germinated. I hope this helped and good luck.

sJRVi704aa	Your home was built at a time when coal burning size fireplaces were most common. Coal burning fireplaces are generally much too shallow for gas logs, which commonly require a minimum of 12-18" depth and 24" or greater width (depending on the brand and style).<br>  <br>  A coal effect gas fire would be an excellent choice for a home of your era, especially if you'd like to keep the fireplaces original to the period your home was built.<br>  <br>  There are specialty gas coals (with ceramic "coals" instead of logs) that can fit a fireplace as shallow as 6" deep and 12" wide. If your fireplace is at least 19" wide and 10" deep, a gas coal basket would fit fine and look more authentic than gas logs.<br>  <br>  Besides the size of your fireplace, I'd also recommend a thorough chimney inspection. Homes of your era often have unlined chimneys, and open burning gas logs OR gas coals do require a chimney lining system that would make your fireplace "capable of burning wood" before a "decorative" gas appliance could be retrofit into your fireplace.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, vented gas logs OR gas coals are only decorative, and are not designed to provide exceptional heat. If you're in the market for a gas fireplace product that not only looks good but ALSO heats, focus on gas fireplace inserts, which are generally classified as gas heating systems. Most gas inserts are allowed to use an aluminum chimney liner system (so your chimney's liner requirements are met) and they do provide some great heating capability.<br>  <br>  Our fireplace store specializes in fireplace products for historic homes and very small fireplaces; get more details at <a href="http://www.gascoals.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.gascoals.net</a><br>  <br>  -Karen<br>  Victorian Fireplace Shop<br>  www.gascoals.net<br>  <br>  Another|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	Get a gas insert stove.|`|pjGueC4xaa	Go to www.stoveshoppe.com and you'll find what you want.

You might need to call the repair guy|`|3892a47ffe478c2cd83ade91886d7bf5aa	contact Whirlpool or a Whirlpool dealer|`|AA11577593	depending on the style your refering to is the problem, if its only a freezer then there is an alarm that sounds when its too warm, if its a door chime thats going off chances are its a door switch issue, but the way it sounds you have a bad door switch.

9NNChMSNaa	I'm no doctor, by any means, but I would not hesitate to bring the children in.  I wouldn't think twice about it after 24 hours.  Be sure the carpet can be walked on within its first 24 hours though.  Call your carpet installer to be certain.  The paint, however, will be fine.  I have always let my little man in as soon as the paint is dry and we can no longer smell the fumes.  To know whether or not you are just "used to it"  leave for a while and come back.  <br>       In the future, the paint-pouri that wal mart sells (it is a liquid fragrance you pour into paint to make it smell good) works great.  My two year old actually helped me paint when we used this.|`|oP8blO9Paa	I gave my sons room 1-2 weeks to air....he has bronchitis though....
YaeG1cjhaa	only if you want to keep the rodents out. But... with a screen, you will need to clean it periodically because lint will clog it.|`|AA11577593	having those ever so wonderful vent screens are great to keep animals out and what not but there is a catch 22, it will plug up it will prevent your ryer from drying correctly and will be a major issue if you want it done correctly vent it out again at an angel or add an angle piece to it so that you can place a different styled outside vent on it, like the one with four flappers on it usually in white and is perfect for both perventing animals and blocking up, if you live in a snowy area having a vent on the roof is the worst thing to have so have it moved to an outside wall.
WtqsWctjaa	Many people have installed it but do not have much information about ceramic tile cleaning and the importance to do it. I use Lustro Italiano Cleaner which is very effective for cleaning ceramic tiles. You can find it in my source site.|`|MYU46ap5aa	You should use Lime Away.  It works really good.  You let it sit and then use a scrub brush.  You can repeat the process a time or two.|`|MasGp3nQaa	The perfect solution is comet/ajax with a dab of bleach. Wet a scrub brush or rag, liberally poor on some comet and add a smidge of bleach<br>  You need something abrasive, so go for the above! It's worked miracles for me my whole life, just don't use too much bleach..only a small dab...|`|244l2kuAaa	I did the same thing with comet/ajax and a dab of bleach. It worked.
AA10489318	When it has grown to its full size.  Normally this happens in 40 to 45 days time.  If you have not noted the day it started growing, wait for it to get slightly riped co lour and if you have too much pumpkin the rodents and the crows/hares will tell you.|`|AA10740247	when they are yellow ,<br>  you tap them on the side and the sound will tel you when they are done <br>  after having tapped a ripe one you will know the sound|`|9074f0229e9cb3d4793d7ae2a4caf398aa	Pumpkins are usually harvested after the first frost.  Their colors may be anything from green to dark orange.  Rap on the pumpkin for a hollow sound and be sure to leave at least a four to five inch "handle" for the top of the pumpkin.  It makes it easier to carry and move around.  The first frost seasons the pumpkin.
