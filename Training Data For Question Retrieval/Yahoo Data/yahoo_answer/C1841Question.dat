20070203171126AAZVDY9	Computers & Internet;Internet	I'm having a problem with myspace, iconator, and AIM 5.9 after I got a new computer with vista. Help, please?	Well I had a problem and searched for questions which are similar to mine. I'm mostly concerned with myspace, though. My problem is that I couldn't go to myspace, so an answer I found was to go under internet options and delete history, files, and cookies. After I did that I DID go to the myspace home page but after I logged in then that's when it screws. I really need myspace because my best and most inseperable friend moved across the country and myspace is my only contact with her. And with Iconator, when I try to download an icon onto AIM it doesn't work, which leads me to AIM sometimes just logging me off for no reason. Please don't suggest getting rid of VISA because it's automatic on this new computer and I can't do anything about it.      I really appreciate the answers, please answer if you know what to do.      Thank you!       &?; s a r a h      P.S. Myspace isn't blocked on this computer.   P.P.S. I'm mostly concerned about myspace.(:

Here is my story:  I had bought a computer 2 weeks ago.       Compaq Presario SR2180NX   Intel Pentium D Processor 820 (Intel Viiv)   250GB 7200RPM SATA   Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950   Windows Vista Home Premium (Windows Vista is the devil!)      So, after using Windows Vista for two days I got sick of it and I wanted my Windows XP again. I tried reformatting it and then tried installing Windows XP, but then no hard drives were detected so I clicked enter and next came the 'blue screen of death'.       So, I installed Windows Vista back and lived with it for 4 days. But then another problem shot out: My internet was extremely slow! Usually I have 30 Kilobits per second download speeds but it became 1-2  Kilobits per second, and the internet browsing became slow to the max!!      I do have Windows XP Professional SP2, but all I need is the SATA RAID driver, which I cannot find. At least that's what I think I need.      Too long,   Ab

Even when I right click the menu to paste, the link for pasting is dimmed out, which alerts me that my pasting tool is inoperable.  It's almost as if my Windows clipboard is missing or deactivated.

20090203131959AAPamSy	Computers & Internet;Security	Serious Trojan Help! Very Hard.?	After downloading a bunch of songs off limewire yesterday my computer became infected with the "fakeinit" trojan. Windows defender has notiied me evry 15 minutes about it and i always hit "Remove" it then says successful but my computer is still infected. I have tried restarting it, and if i try restoring it it looks like the virus has deleted all my restore points. I have AVG free and that picks up 22 threats but it cant delete them because the virus restarts or freezes the computer when i try to do this. Should I download Kaspersky?

20090203132651AAfvYLv	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	How can i keep my laptop cool?	I have a dell 1501 notebook with 2gb of RAM, and AMD Athlon 64x2 processor, 320gb HD, and 256 mb of integrated video memory with windows vista home premium on it. my issue is that it runs very very warm, usually around 40*C when idling and up to 65* when watching videos in HD or playing system-intensive games! It doesn't make sense though because my computer is ALWAYS on a slab of wood that i cut out the size of my computer, that way no lint or anything gets sucked into the air intake on the bottom.       Also, I like the visual look of Vista Aero, so I use that, however i disabled most of the visual effects in the the administrative settings. My system's score in the control panel shows that the graphics performance is FAR lower than anything else; it is at 3.0. Would it be more efficient to disable vista aero and pick a theme that doesn't use the GPU instead of the CPU? Would this make my computer cooler? What else could I do to keep my computer cooler overall?

20090203132937AAVdOXk	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Posting on Craigslist, can it be traced?	I just received a call from my younger brother who is very upset.  He just broke up with his girlfriend over the weekend, and today he received TONS of calls from people stating that they saw his add on Craigslist for a date.      We know it's his ex because she was really upset that he broke up with her and moved out of their apartment, and took everything that he owned.  As well as he turned off everything in the apartment, including her cell phone (He was paying for everything, she goes to school full time).      So is there a way to trace a posting made on Craigslist? We think she posted it from her sister's house or her sister's work.      **BTW in case people are wondering what made him leave and take everything and turn everything off...he caught her cheating on him with our cousin**

I created the first page (index.html) and then saved it as a template so that I could create my other pages from it. I finally finished all my pages uploaded them to the internet but now I can't get my navigation bar to work. I linked the pages together on the template, once my site was up I could click on one of the pages in my bar and it would direct me there but when I tried to go to another page it doesn't do anything. When I hold my mouse over the pages in the bar it says javascript;:....can someone tell me what I did wrong and how to correctly go about linking my pages together??      Thanks in advance!
