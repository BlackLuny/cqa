20090309120639AACArIF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Having a second child years after relinquishing?	Mothers who placed their first child for adoption, and later had a second child:   What difficulties did you experience raising your second child but not your first? I feel like raising a child would be a daily reminder of how much you miss your first child.      Also, adoptees, if your mother had another child several years after you were placed for a adoption, and raised that child, how would/did you feel?       Please share your stories.

20090309120934AAY2RUV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How did you know when...?	... to stop the milk feed just before your child's bedtime?      My son is 16 months old, and he still has a sippy cup of milk before bed. However, he's hardly even had half of it in the last 5 or 6 days in a row.      I don't want to jump the gun and stop it altogether if it's just a phase, but equally I don't want to carry on trying to give him something he doesn't want anymore.      What are your own experiences with this?

20090309123801AA1wPBB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Moms, help me out, please......?	Although this isn’t the right category, I’m looking for a broad base of advice, so please answer anyway.  My 10-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter like to rough-house from time to time.  It's never very rough, but my son will occasionally give his sister a “titty twister.”  I know that he doesn’t do it with the intent to hurt her; he just thinks he's teasing her.  I’ve lectured him and have taken away privileges, and I’ve tried to convey to him that a girl's breasts are very sensitive, like his testicles.      Fed up, my daughter asked me today if she can give him a taste of his own medicine (and a lesson in sensitivity).  She wants to hit him in the testicles the next time he gives her a "titty twister."  Since my “nice mom” approach hasn’t worked, I told her that I would think about it.  I may allow her to hit him (not too hard), and I’m wondering what you think?  And what should I say to my son?      Thanks!
20090309125247AAUFuQH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	My x girlfriend says she will give the baby for adoption if I don't get back with her? please help?	I need some help with this girl, we used to date before but she cheated on me, an broke up with me. Now she is back after a few months, an saying that her son is mine. I don’t believe he is mine because we look nothing like each other. He looks like her other son. I don’t know what to do she is crazy. I give her money every week by the baby stuff when she calls me crying an in a fit about how she doesn’t have money for baby food. I want a paternity test done but she wont let me, she wants me back, I don’t want her she says if I don’t come back to her she will give the baby up for adoption. She is messing up my relationship with my girlfriend whom I love every much. My new girlfriend is understanding to some degree but not when the other one swears at her . My girlfriend said if she gives the baby up that we should try an find him an adopt him. I don’t know what to do, should I get a lawyer?
20090309132118AARpbVS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	What would you give for an allowance?	My son just turned 8 years old and he does do chores but he never really caught on to the whole money thing, so we always used marbles and when he filled up the jar he was able to get something.  Usually an action figure.  Since his birthday last month, he realizes that it's nice to have money so I told him that he has to earn money the same way he has been earning his marbles.  A jar of marbles is usually filled within two weeks or so resulting in a 6.99-7.99 star wars action figure.       I was thinking if he completes at least four chores a day sometimes one or two more, I would give him $7.00 a week.  On top of maintaining his room, he normally will empty the recycling bin, take the garbage out, help clean off the dinner table, help clean put the clean dishes away from the dishwasher, put his clean clothes away, and put his dirty clothes in the laundry room.  When needed he will help unload and put the groceries away, pull the garbage cans to the curb (with help), vacuum (he loves to do this anyway), sweep, etc.  So each chore would average a quarter, what do you think? Is this to much or too little?     Do you have any other chores, that he might like to do?

I have one of those hotslings baby carriers and my son (4 months) sits upward, facing outwards.  The problem is that they show you to cross their legs (indian style) and put them in the sling...his feet touch his stomach and he's curled into the fetal position.  He loves it, and is comfortable because it's the only way I can get him to sleep but it just seems like the legs being "tucked up" would be detrimental to his development.  Anyone know?

20090227152129AAt63QR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Ok, this may be a silly question....?	I read that breasts can leak during pregnancy... is this always the case?   If you are pregnant, are your breasts leaking and at what week in your pregnancy did it start??      If they don't leak during the pregnancy will the milk be ready once the baby is here?      It seems like a silly question but my husband has been joking with me, saying that I won't be able to breastfeed as my breasts aren't leaking and so there will be no milk when baby is here... he's only doing it to wind me up, he doesn't mean it :-)  But it has me thinking....      Thank you for your answers and hope your pregnancies are going well xxxx

I can't even sleep they are so bad.  I'm 32 weeks pregnant and today at the doc office i told her but she didn't seem too concerned.

I took tylenol but it's not helping any.
20090227151231AA96n0N	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I got a thick brownish discharge about 1.5 weeks after my period ended. What does this mean?	There was a huge clump of it and it's very mucus-like. I'm a little worried, because I remember reading that that can happen in early pregnancy, though a lot of sites are saying it just means you're ovulating and is nothing to worry about.      You see I went off of birth control for the first time in about a year (so maybe that's why I'm getting it?) But I did have unprotected sex once.

However, i ate them before that and it didnt happen. Now he is 5 months old, and he has sensitive skin, he gets little rashes here and there but they are just irritations, and Ive got him eating rice cereal. Should I get him tested for food allergies before incorperating more foods? my husband and I just dont think its a nut allergy. No one in the families have them, and if I was eating the nuts before, then why all of a sudden would he have gotten it? (i was breastfeeding at the time) Anyone have experiance with this or advice?

20090309143923AAY1T6Y	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Do you think doctor care during pregnancy is important?	I have heard of a lot of women who decline doctor care when pregnant. Their excuse is they want it 'completely natural" and that "women have been having babies without doctors for centuries". My opinion is, while they did have babies without docs for a while, there were also more still borns and dead mothers. I just don't understand why someone would decline a doctor (or midwife), tests, ultrasounds, and anything possible to ensure that their baby is born healthy. I'm not talking about women who use midwifes or the ones who do home births in general, but the ones who don't care to see anyone. This makes no sense to me when research has shown that proper medical care is essential to a healthy delivery and newborn. Anyway, for those of you who decline medical help, I just want to know your reasoning and opinions.      Oh, and on a side note, I taught my almost 4 month old how to high five. lol. Now if you hold up your hand and say "give me five" she smacks your hand. lol. So cute!

I started seeing a Reproductive Endocrinologist this month and when I went to his office on CD 17  he said I have not and probably will not ovulate this month, and that I did not have any follicles that would produce and egg.  My periods have been very irregular and I have started skipping them again so I figured I would skip this month because he said I wasn't going to ovulate.  But I just started my period right on time when I should have had I ovulated???      I am so confused? Should I call the doctor and tell him, or talk to his nurse when I go in for more tests tomorrow?? Do you think he just missed it because I usually do not ovulate until cd20 anyway, but he should have seen a ripe follicle by then right????

In the past stalls (a table set up in the local school with a person behind it), have included things like, getting a bale of hay and sticking in it like 200 very long nails, you would then pay like ￡1 for 2 go's at pulling out the nails, and if you got a nail with a white end then you win a prize (something small).      I have thought of maybe getting a big jar of sweets and getting people to pay ￡1 to guess how many sweets are inside, and the person at the end who guesses correct or nearest wins either the sweets or ￡20 or something like that.

20090309143052AAOfLi8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	White bump beneath baby's lower lip?	She's 7 months old and I noticed it a few days ago. It's right under her lip and it's barely noticeable. It doesn't hurt her at all. I wonder if it's from drinking a bottle, like a callous or something? Any other moms experienced this on their baby? Should I take her to the dr. or will they just roll their eyes at the new mom?

20090309145010AA0ha3n	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Got a question for parents of teenagers.?	I have a few lil sisters and they are teenagers. Recently a lot of other kids at their school have been getting pregnant and they said quite a few of their classmates cannot talk to the pregnant teens because their parents will not let them. I mean i understand that they don't want THEIR kids to get pregnant but when I was their age, I had a friend that got pregnant and I learned that from being around her I didn't want to have a baby for a while (until i was ready). Shouldn't parents let their kids see what its like and learn from them instead of hiding them from reality? I'm sure not very many pregnant teens would condone having sex especially when sex is what put them in the situation they're in.

20090309142454AA2Hcs4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	In my late teens, might be pregnant, two missed periods.?	i missed two pills around the end of jan, and had unprotected sex on the second day of the missed pill.    my last period was in the beggining/middle of jan.      i havent had my period since and now im guessing its around the time my second period should have came.      there has been a few times that i have felt like i was going to get my period dotted here and there, some strong feelings, some not. this has been happening for the past 2 or 3 weeks - not everyday though.      i took a test saturday morning but i didnt have alot of pee so the negative line came up really slowly too.   bassicly, i waited 3 minuits, forgot to wait 5 minuits.   my mum checked about 2 hours later, there was a REALLY really faint positive line that we could only see in some angles of the light.   ive heard of evaporation lines so maybe that was it?   but that doesnt explain the missed periods.      also missing the pills do not have effect with my periods.   ive missed a few before and my periods were fine. (dont lecture me.)      and i dout anythings wrong with my womb or anything because i got checked out for something else with an internal and external scan about a week before the unprotected sex and i was fine then..      also my breasts now feel a bit sore today, and i fell asleep earlier which i dont normally do...       is it likely that im pregnant   and when should i test again!?

20090309144213AARsaGS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How to make it work when the baby comes?	We are going to be having a baby soon. And right now we are able to pay bills and still have money to go do things. We don't have very much in savings, and are working on that. But I am worried about when the baby comes. I've been looking around and daycare can cost up to $700 for a newborn. I'm scared that we are not going to be able to afford it and everything else the baby needs. I know any extra money we have that we used to use to go out and do things will go to the baby and it's needs. But I still don't see how it is going to work.    I have a cousin who had a baby last year with his wife and they make less than me and my husband, have more bills, but are still able to afford daycare. So I was just wondering if anyone would mind submitting their stories on their financial worries when having a baby and how everything turned out. I am just hoping that everything will be okay.  Any stories/advice is appreciated. Thank you!

20090309144831AAIxfL3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I don't feel loved from anyone?	first i'm going to say this is long and if you want to help me read it all.   and sorry for the spelling/grammer         First I’m 15 about to be 16. In the past 3 ? months my life has went from great happy go lucky to crap. First i found out my dad was cheating on my mom. i didn't tell my mom for almost a month but it was destroying me inside( i lost 35lbs and i was having nightmares) i told my dad i knew first, he threaten me to not tell her. i finally told her. the had a huge fight for 2 days then my dad left with saying he hated me. (haven't seen or spoken to him since) my mom is blaming for the split saying if i was a better son... or if i would have told her when i found out... she told me she hated and wanted nothing to do with me and that i was a selfish person. and the last month and a week she hasn't looked or spoken to me.      To make things worst me brother who has been the medditor is leaving for college in like a month for early enrollment. Since this started I’ve been confused and thinking this is all my fault and etc… like if I were a better son neither of them would leave or hate me.      The one good thing has been my girlfriend( together for almost 3 years) I love her so much. She knows everything and has been there for me. We started having sex about when everything in my family happened. WE WERE having sex 3-4 a day for about 2 ? months. Having sex with her made me feel like someone actually loved me you know.      But I stop having sex with her a week ago because I felt like a bad boyfriend. She told me that I hadn’t been smiling since the stuff with my family and I haven’t told her I love her in two months.( I do love her). I mean she constantly trying to make my feel better and says that she loves me like 100 times a day but I haven‘t been able to tell her I love her back for a while. I use say it to her all the time but… she is also worried about my health and I’m 6’2 and I’ve went from 205 to 135 in like and month and a half.      So I stop having sex with her. I was having nightmares of her cheating on me every night since I found out my dad was cheating. I told her and she said not to worry that she only wanted me. So we stopped the sex and we made promise we wouldn’t have any type of “sex” with anyone but together (so no masturbation). It been driving crazy.      I also told my two best friend about my family problem last week. They kind of forced it out. They have been supportive and listening to me. Of them a girl my best friend has really been there for me the this last week and has been sleeping over and my house and vice-versa last week.      Yeah now I can tell my girlfriend is a little hurt from me not spending as much time with her and I haven’t been able to say I love you to her. My best friend whose girl that sleeping over and stuff almost kissed and I am confused. I love her as a best friend and she hot and everything but her not my girlfriend but I haven’t had sex in a while and I’m horny and confused. I want sex. I been thinking maybe if I cheated( I know just like my dad) I could get ride of the nightmares. Or I start back having sex with my gf I feel like I’m using her. and she deserves better then me. I’m confused from everything.      I don’t know whats wrong with me I know people care about me I just don’t feel love I use to feel from anyone.      Thanks for reading this I know its all over the place like my head right now. I would appericate advice.      But please don’t recommend a psch or school concelesor b/c I won’t go      thanks

20090309145128AA1VvaL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Older Men Looking At Teens?	Hello, I am a 15 year old teen that just experienced a strange thing(well, not that strange but... still) .      Today I was walking to my local grocery store(It's about 30 minutes away), and I was wearing simple blue jeans and a green tee shirt. As I was walking and text messaging I heard a car honking at me. I ignored it, then about 2 minutes later I heard another car honking at me. That time I was sure they were honking at me, this went on for the entire time I was walking to the store. There was about 7 honks in all.      When I was walking back from the store there were more honks and guys whistling and waving at me. There was even a guy who said " I wanna f**k you! "    All the while I looked but didn't say anything to them.      The guys age ranged from late teens to senior citizen.       Anyway my real question has any other teen experienced this?   Also, do you think I handle the situation well?      Thank you for the answer :)

20090309145715AAhb2nc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Why do women who have one night stands and get pregnant, want to bring a child into this world with no dad?	Now, I'm not talking about people in a relationship. I'm talking about 2 people that have sex with NO intention of having a baby (come on people its 2009 and not every time people do it, they're not trying to make babies) and really dont know each other. I'm saying, with protection measures in place, protection fails, and they both KNOW there was no relationship that would come out of it. Why would she want to bring a child into this world where dad doesn't live there, and cant be around. Just because you have sex with someone doesn't mean you have to marry them. They have had no relationship before, and never will. Now she expects child support from him and is on welfare. Not saying anything bad about welfare, but I dont think its right you should get on welfare because you made a bad decision. im all for "Its her body, she can do whatever she wants" blah blah blah...but there is another person to think about that has NO say in the decision.

The last name is Istvan, pronounced exactly as it sounds: ist-van. My question is what is a good middle name for Juliet? I have two other children, Kellan Evan and Gisella Claire. Also, my name is Ashley and my husband is named Evan. So, what middle names do you think go good with Juliet?      We don't want cliche' middle names (Marie, Ann, Nicole, Catherine, etc). We would like some Gaelic names (Kathleen, Christina), but they don't seem to go good with Juliet ____ Istvan!         So, any suggestions will be helpful!         Thank you!

Random questions on it:   what kind of stuff did you bring to the hospital for the baby ?   did your partner stay over night with you (if you did stay the night)?   if you had a boy, do they ask you if you want them circumcised ?   what do they do if they take your baby's foreskin off ?   do they do it right after birth ? or do you get to hold them first and they do it at a later time ?      i know none of these questions, really fall under the same thing. but please if you answer then, copy and paste the questions, so i know what your referring to, so when i put all my information together for my project, it makes since :)      thank you so much in advanced for helping me :)      what is a 'midwife'?   is there any symptoms your about to give birth before your water breaking ?   what are braxton hicks ?

20090309152433AAzvNHy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I have a major problem and do not know what to do?	For a school function I am required to go to this store during school hours. However your parents are supposed ot pick you up, and mine will not be available. If I wanted to I could walk back from the store to the school and take the after school bus which would take about an hour. I want to know if I should do this because it would take me an hour to walk. I would be walking on the side of a major highway, and I am unsure if I would make it back in time. However, I have no one else to take me at all. Should I do this? or should I take a public bus home? Or should I speak to the school and ask for some type of alternative and risk being removed from the event.( Fashion show btw) Any better suggestions? Thank you. Oh and i am 14 years old.

I haven't had sex since Valentine's Day due to lack of sex drive/interest and having morning sickness all day and night long(it has lessened now, the morning sickness). But dh hasn't been very understanding. He got fed up with me not giving him sex and said that if I didn't have sex with him he'd find somebody else who wanted to have sex. I don't want him to cheat on me so I had sex with him and he got a bit too excited during. He kept getting rough and I had to keep telling him to be gentle. Now I am having a light brown spotting and I am worried. Could sex cause a miscarriage?

20090309155821AAPb4xf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My daughter doesn't like formula?	She's 7 months old and I started giving her formula 2 weeks ago.  Until then she was on breastmilk and solids at 5 months.  When she was first born she had a little formula until my milk supply was fully established.  I've gone back to work now so I can't pump and nurse as much as she eats so I'm having to supplement with formula but now she doesn't like it.  What can I do to get her to drink it.  I still pump breastmilk out of one breast when she nurses and once a day during my workday but its just not enough.  I'm a teacher so my job doesn't allow me to pump more than once a day.  I can't just leave my classes for 15 minutes every day.   Today I did try mixing some gerber juice with it and she likes that for now except her doctor didn't technically say she could have it.  It was only about 2 oz of formula with a splash of juice but i'm sure it won't hurt her.  What do you think is 7 months too young to regularly mix juice with her formula?  Any ideas on how to get her to drink it would be great.

I am not working because I am going to school.  Money is getting really tight ( like we are barely making ends meet) so I am thinking about quiting college and getting a full time job. My question is should I try to get a part time job and continue going to school which will help a little but not much because we will have to pay for more days at daycare for the baby. Or should I just get a full time job and forget about college for now.  I have worked so hard at school and I know once I am finished we will be doing so good. I just wanted to know what you all would do or if maybe someone has another solution to my problem. Thanks in advance.

I have a few lil sisters and they are teenagers. Recently a lot of other kids at their school have been getting pregnant and they said quite a few of their classmates cannot talk to the pregnant teens because their parents will not let them. I mean i understand that they don't want THEIR kids to get pregnant but when I was their age, I had a friend that got pregnant and I learned that from being around her I didn't want to have a baby for a while (until i was ready). Shouldn't parents let their kids see what its like and learn from them instead of hiding them from reality? I'm sure not very many pregnant teens would condone having sex especially when sex is what put them in the situation they're in.

My 2 year old daughter bit my 3 month old son. He's shrieking on my lap. I've put an ice pack and cloth over his fingers, where she bit him, and she bit him hard. He was almost bleeding.      Is there anything else I can/should do for him, or to comfort and calm him down and how should I punish her?      Spanking is not an option.

20090309160134AAr3Yvu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Is it to soon to be testing?	So on Saturday I had some strange bleeding, I'm not sure how you would define spotting as apposed to some other kind of bleeding. But in the afternoon went i went to the rest room i noticed there was brownish sticky blood in my panties, and when i wiped there was nothing on the toilet paper. When I got home i mentioned it to my husband and he suggested that it may be implantation bleeding. So I researched it and I noticed some woman saying they only noticed it when they wiped and it didn't get on their panties. On Sunday I went to the restroom and noticed again that I had bled, but this time it was bright red and again it was only in my panties and not when I wiped. This time it was in a smaller amount than the previous day. My period isn't due until Thursday I think (my periods are not on any kind of schedule so it is hard to keep track of when they will be) I usually get very bad cramping and my nipples get very tender the week before my period. But I have not had any signs of my period, I get a little cramp here and there but it is very minor....      Anyway my question! Is it to early to take a HPT? I don't have any health insurance so going to the doctor isn't really an option, But i would just like to know what you guys think?

20090309153457AAeJyRu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	PLEASE Help with naming our second son!?	Ok...here is my dillemma. We have a son who is 16 months old. His name is Alijah Jose Martinez (Jose is my husbands name). We just found out we are having another boy in a few months and I don't want the second boy to feel left out because our first child got my husbands first name as his middle name. So, we are putting our fathers middle names as our new son's middle name(s) (we can't decide on who's father and we like the way the initials will look) so he can feel special too. I really like the name Alonzo, and it's growing on my husband. My dad's name is Craig Allen but I don't like Allen, but I do like Callen (with the C from Craig and the Allen put together) and my husband's dad's middle name is Elias. So our new son's name would be Alonzo Callen Elias Martinez. His initials would be ACE-M. Also, I need to know, what do you think of the name Alonzo??? I know there is a lot we are working from here, but I NEED some input!!! Please HELP!!

20090309153857AAv7ZgR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I've honestly wrecked everything?	first i'm going to say this is long and if you want to help me read it all.   and sorry for the spelling/grammer         First I’m 15 about to be 16. In the past 3 ? months my life has went from great happy go lucky to crap. First i found out my dad was cheating on my mom. i didn't tell my mom for almost a month but it was destroying me inside( i lost 35lbs and i was having nightmares) i told my dad i knew first, he threaten me to not tell her. i finally told her. the had a huge fight for 2 days then my dad left with saying he hated me. (haven't seen or spoken to him since) my mom is blaming for the split saying if i was a better son... or if i would have told her when i found out... she told me she hated and wanted nothing to do with me and that i was a selfish person. and the last month and a week she hasn't looked or spoken to me.      To make things worst me brother who has been the medditor is leaving for college in like a month for early enrollment. Since this started I’ve been confused and thinking this is all my fault and etc… like if I were a better son neither of them would leave or hate me.      The one good thing has been my girlfriend( together for almost 3 years) I love her so much. She knows everything and has been there for me. We started having sex about when everything in my family happened. WE WERE having sex 3-4 a day for about 2 ? months. Having sex with her made me feel like someone actually loved me you know.      But I stop having sex with her a week ago because I felt like a bad boyfriend. She told me that I hadn’t been smiling since the stuff with my family and I haven’t told her I love her in two months.( I do love her). I mean she constantly trying to make my feel better and says that she loves me like 100 times a day but I haven‘t been able to tell her I love her back for a while. I use say it to her all the time but… she is also worried about my health and I’m 6’2 and I’ve went from 205 to 135 in like and month and a half.      So I stop having sex with her. I was having nightmares of her cheating on me every night since I found out my dad was cheating. I told her and she said not to worry that she only wanted me. So we stopped the sex and we made promise we wouldn’t have any type of “sex” with anyone but together (so no masturbation). It been driving crazy.      I also told my two best friend about my family problem last week. They kind of forced it out. They have been supportive and listening to me. Of them a girl my best friend has really been there for me the this last week and has been sleeping over and my house and vice-versa last week.      Yeah now I can tell my girlfriend is a little hurt from me not spending as much time with her and I haven’t been able to say I love you to her. My best friend whose girl that sleeping over and stuff almost kissed and I am confused. I love her as a best friend and she hot and everything but her not my girlfriend but I haven’t had sex in a while and I’m horny and confused. I want sex. I been thinking maybe if I cheated( I know just like my dad) I could get ride of the nightmares. Or I start back having sex with my gf I feel like I’m using her. and she deserves better then me. I’m confused from everything.      I don’t know whats wrong with me I know people care about me I just don’t feel love I use to feel from anyone.      Thanks for reading this I know its all over the place like my head right now. I would appericate advice.      But please don’t recommend a psch or school concelesor b/c I won’t go      thanks

20090309154351AAMnYvc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What should I do?  Should I stick with this guy or not?	So my best friend introduced me to this guy sometime last year. And we became friends. And that's all I considered us for awhile but then my friends said we would be cute together. At first I kinda just shrugged that off but after awhile we started talking more and I started liking him. And he started liking me too. Things were going really well for a couple weeks, and it was presumed not only by me, but by our whole circle of friends, that he would ask me to be his girlfriend. My best friend was having a party at her house, and he was supposedly gonna ask me out then. Anyway, it was finals week the week before the party and we all got out of school early. So we were bored and we decided to go over to her house- me, her, another girlfriend, the guy I like, and his friend. And her parents weren't home. Well, somehow they found out about our little get together and we both got grounded. No more party, either. But that's when things started to go downhill. That week at school things were different with him. I really just wanted to know what was up- he wasn't acting the same towards me, like he just didn't like me anymore. So I texted him in the middle of that next week and asked him what was up and he said he felt like there was no chemistry between us. So these past couple months have gone by uneventful, except some days I think he likes me and other days I have no idea. He always talks about how we should hang out and stuff, and now that I'm finally ungrounded, I've mentioned hanging out with him to him a couple times...and now all of a sudden he seems uninterested! Is he just bipolar or is there something wrong with me? I still like him a lot, and like I said, some days it seems like he feels the same way but I just have no idea!

20090309162834AAAseTE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Do you think i should break up?	My gf and i have been together for 3 months, we're happy together and we love each other so much. However, i have some doubts about our relationship. Over the last 3 months, she broke up with me 3 times, but she always wanted me back. However, although i love her very much, she always makes me feel sad for some reasons - but i must admit that we had good times together as well.      Firstly, my friends and my classmates tell me she's kinda avoiding me at school and they think that she's not comfortable around me at school, they think that she is not her usual self with me at school and as a matter of fact, we dont spend breaks together - i really wanna be with her in break but she doesnt like to spend time with me at school, she also does not let me give her hugs at school. Secondly, when i talk to her about something or she wants to talk to me about something important that concerns us, she ends up never telling me. Thirdly, i think shes hinding something from me, and she's always shy around me and i think she has more trust in her friends and she is more open with them as well. In addition, she wants to break up with me when we graduate (we're sophomores) and i really want to be with her in college but she apparently doesnt.      so i thought to myself, why am i wasting so much with her? why am i gonna waste 2 years of my life with her if she wants to do that? and why am i still with her if i am having so many doubts about our relationship? what do u think i should do?

Let say you allowed your friend to baby sit for 2 days and then when you picked up your baby you notice he is acting different. You come to the conclusion that he was dropped... and several of your friends and family agree with you ( Including a Parenting teacher and a neo-natal nurse). So you take him to the DRs to get checked and have some scans done.... Then the DR comes back and tells you that there was head trauma... (which fit with your theory).... What would you do???

My best friends always ask me to go to the movies,to the park,etc.   but, I always have to say no,because of my mom.   I've never experienced a sleep over or go to the mall just with my friends.   She's so stereotypical towards teenagers.   Like she judges my friends as drug users & smoking  addicts from MOVIES.   & the thing is, she never met them before.   My best friends are like the most sweetest people in the school.   She raised me as a responsible girl.I know that drugs  & ciggartes can ruin your life.I know what is wrong & what is right.

I think it was just a day ago I advised someone with this problem to "be patient, he'll outgrow it."  Well, that was clearly crap advice, and I retract it.      I know he's just experimenting with his new teeth.  But the sound it's...horrible.  It's like nails on a chalk board.  We have a doctor's appointment coming up and I'll ask her but I'm pretty certain she'll just tell me to wait it out.      Please, someone tell me that their baby did this and then stopped after a few days.  I'd rather change 6 awful diapers a day than listen to that terrible sound.

20090309164855AAAOL1Q	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant nanny ? what would you do?	Pregnant Nanny? what would you do?   I just found out yesterday that i am pregnant ( yay for me). I am 4 weeks.   I have worked as a nanny for the same family for almost a year , watching there daughter since she was 4 weeks old. I have very unique hours, i am there a 4 am and leave at noon, so day care would never be an option for them, they need a nanny, and have no reliable family near by,and i also do all the baby sitting.   I absolutely love them :) From there daughter( best baby i have ever watched) , to the mother whom i spend a half hour chatting with in the morning while the husband gets ready, to the husband who is good matured and funny, always giving me things to bring home to my husband ( unusual beer mostly). They will not be having anymore children, she is there pride and joy.   I am going to tell them next week that i am pregnant, this week is there daughter birthday and i do not want to take any of the spot light from them.   My plan is to have my mother fill in for me when i am on maternity leave, if that is okay with them. I haven't asked my mother yet ( she does not know i am pregnant) but i am positive she will fill in for me, because she was trying to find a nanny job for the morning like i have to earn some extra cash ( she is a mother of 10, and has always been a house wife, but the youngest is now 8 and she has lots of free time).   I plan on taking my baby ( it sounds so weird to say my baby, lol) to work with me, because that would be the ideal situation.   Well that's my hole story, How should i tell them? when should i tell them? in the morning when me and the mom talk, or when they get home from work. How would you take it if i was your nanny.   Oh i am 22 and married, i do not know if that makes a difference to you, but yea.      Thanks!

20090309121250AAKmRAL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Son hates Nanny..........?	I have 8 kids. 7 live at home with me (my oldest is 19, in college and married) and 4 are under the age of 8 (6, 2 and 7 month old twins), so I hired a nanny. My older kids are 11, 13 and almost 15. They all (and my husband) agreed it'd be best if I got a nanny to help me with the younger ones. So my husband and I went to nannys4hire.com and found a great nanny. Everyone likes her.      Except for my 11 year old.      You see, my 11 year old is a trouble maker. So I told him that I have given the nanny permission to send him to his room if he misbehaves.   My son agreed. I told the nanny the same thing and she said she was fine with it.      Yesterday I'm at the grocery store and I get a call from my 13 year old. Apparently my son has punched our nanny in the face and pushed her against the wall. I come home and find my nanny with an ice pack on her face and my son is standing there, his face smug and his arms folded over his chest. I ask what happened. Apparently my 6 year old son had misbehaved so the nanny was going to put him in timeout. My 6 year old refused to go to timeout and threw a big fit. So when our nanny picks him up to bring him to time out, my 11 year old grabs the 6 year old out her arms, puts him on the couch and punches her in face and shoves her in the wall and yells "DON'T TOUCH MY BROTHER!".      Nothing was broken and my nanny has agreed to stay-but never wants to be alone with my older son.      My son thinks he can rule the house. He's told me time and time again he feels like he's being babied with having a nanny there and every time I've told him that we need the nanny or I'll lose my mind. When I told him that yesterday he yelled at me: "Well maybe if you could keep your legs shut you wouldn't have so many kids!" That made me cry. When my husband came home just minutes later and saw me sobbing, he grounded my son and my son yelled "Don't tell me what to do!".      But in the end my son was grounded for two months. One month for being disrespectful to the nanny and one month for making me cry and being disrespectful to both me and my husband.      If we get another nanny I know nothing will change, so switching nannies won't work. And as I said, I'll lose my mind if I don't have a nanny.       What should I do with my son? Please help!

My 10 (practically 11) year old daughter usually goes to bed at about 7:50-8:00. She's starting to think this is too early; because she likes to watch tv and read and all. But she needs to wake up by 7 am in the morning and she usually wakes up at around 6:30-6:40 and she needs at LEAST 9 hours (BETTER 10 hours) of sleep a night. Should she stay up later? she chooses to go to bed at that time because she barely gets any homework on a daily basis. So what time should she go to bed at on a weekday? How about a weekend?

I don't really have any cramping (maybe a small one here or there) But stomach feels bloated. I also have a cat that for the last two weeks has not wanted to stay off me and follows me around and I heard that's a sign.(animals know) I have also had a little back ache and have been really thirsty.           So do you think its in my mind or do you think Im pregnant?

20090309173935AACVC6m	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My stepmother, who longs for her own child, has yet to congratulate me on my pregnancy.  How do I react?	The background:  My father got involved with a younger woman when I was a child.  Early in their relationship the discussion of whether or not she wanted children eventually arose.  She assured him that she did not want children.  They eventually married and I've remained very  close with both my father and stepmother.  Now she's in her mid 30's and desperately longs for a child of her own.  My father, now in his early 50's, does not.      The situation:  I recently found out I was pregnant.  My stepmother has yet to congratulate or even acknowledge our wonderful news.  My father explained she's having a hard time dealing with everyone around her having babies but her.      The problem:  I'm extremely hurt that my stepmother has yet to extend her congratulations regarding my pregnancy.  I understand she might be going through a difficult time with this news, but I feel she's being selfish.  It's not as if I'm an acquaintance or a co-worker... I'm her daughter!  I don't know what to do.

20090227095358AAxfHIj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	NOT a q of incest: In india, is it normal for grown children to sleep in the same bed as their mom?	I only ask because I've only heard of it happening in one occurance. Yes, the mother is close to her kids, they are her all. They are her identity. I don't mean anything gross either, just sleeping. But the girl's married, and she was awaiting to go abroad to b with her man. I was married to the boy. They have their own rooms, but they do on occasion(the girl bunked with mom usually, the guy on occasion), bunk with mom, in bed. Dad prefers the floor. I can see a mother doing this 'til the kids hit their teens at the latest, but this is what I married into. I find it strange, I never knew of this practice in india b4. So, is it normal for marriage to be the age kids get weaned from their moms as bunkmates?

20090227094949AAOdcDy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents of daughter who are "early bloomers"....?	My daughter's doctor expressed concern that she is developing earlier than they normally would like to see and has referred us to an endocrinologist. I have to admit that I'm thankful because as someone who developed early (I got my period when I was 8) I know the psychological as well as physiological difficulties that can arise from maturing physically faster than everyone around you and have had my current doctors (including my ob/gyn) tell me that my pediatrician growing up should have been more concerned about my development than he was.      So, our appointment is not for 2 weeks and I'm just wonder what happens next? What tests will they do if any? What can they do for her and does it have any bad side effects? What can I do to help my daughter prepare?      (Sorry to be asking here, but in my opinion parents with experience can be more helpful than doctors who just have knowledge of a situation)
