En un buen da puede que saques $300.00, checalo bien y recuerda que se basa en salarios mnimos y el diario esta en los $52.59.    Y de los menores de edad, no creo que exista inconveniente, lo mas seguro es que te pidan que tus padres firmen la solicitud de empleo o firmen algun papel para hacer constar que tienes permiso de ellos y ya con eso no debe existir inconveniente.|`|2wDJmluOaa	en este tipo de restaurantes los consumos no son de costo elevado por lo tanto las propinas son "bajas", considero que entre salario base (que debe ser el minimo) y propinas serian alrededor de 200, no creo que mucho mas  en mexico si pueden trabajar legalmente menores de edad, pero bajo ciertas condiciones, la edad mnima segun se son 16 a?os y debe ser una jornada bien definida, ademas de necesitar el permiso por escrito de tus papas para que puedas trabajar|`|bpArb7gnaa	no s cunto ganen, pero deber ser salario mnimo  y no pueden trabajar menores de edad

Walk to the restaurant. Not everyone uses the valet option.    Valets park in places that are often unguarded and become targets for thieves. In addition, the valet himself can often rifle through your stuff and take whatever he likes.    I would much rather walk two or three blocks than use a valet (unless the service was for a lot ON THE PREMISES).    If you must use a valet, you pay in advance and tip afterward.
NbWFJjvraa	You're right----we order salads and then later find out that they were 1000 calories.    At BJ's, I get their roasted chicken or salmon and ask them to hold the rice and/or potatoes and get veggies on the side instead.  That way you'll get good low-fat protein and don't have to worry about all the fatty salad dressings.|`|7X0xe8oraa	I'm sorry I thought I saw "diet friendly" and BJ's in the same sentence. LOL.

In terms of choosing diet friendly foods, I would stick to anything that is chicken or fish, nothing with heavy cream sauces, nothing with bread, and nothing fried.

13AAxlc7aa	I am trying to think of some nice places with cafes. My first thought was Leichardt, as there is loads of cafes restaurants.

You could also meader around The Olympic park at Homebush. The only other place really is the City. Forget the North Shore. It is too hard to get to from Clovelly.

zzO6Qalsaa	Yes, I have saw that video too and it is very cruel.I believe if animals are going to be killed to be eaten they deserve a  swift merciful death.There are humane ways to keep the animal from suffering and I agree they should be applied.As for the government,don't even get me started there,cause I have about as much respect for those pork barrel,holier than thou hypocrites as I do child molesters!|`|VXcp8hvHaa	chickens can't talk|`|W8UZebRWaa	It's cruel to skin animals only for fur but I don't see them doing much on that either.

I somewhat understand what you're trying to say.But we kill chickens like we kill other people. It's the way of life. Maybe they should kill them in a way that isn't painful. Yes they do have souls and they go to animal heaven when they die. Having the Government come in and stop KFC'S is a little overboard.

Keep trying until it gets caught in your windpipe and you can't breathe.  After the oxygen has been cut off from your brain for about 15 minutes, find someone to dislodge the bone with the Heimlich maneuver.  15 minutes is roughly the time it takes for someone to suffer brain damage and subject the negligent party to subtantial damages.|`|yHvh7tFlaa	"If it didn't have the bone, it wouldn't be crispy"    Seriously, sue them.

Don't you ever feed your kids anything with bones in it?  One thing I have learned in life is that there are no guarantees, and nothing is absolutely perfect.  If I buy a defective product that I cannot use, then I do expect to be reimbursed, either with cash or a working product.  But a chicken sandwich with a bone?  I would pick out the bone, and finish the sandwich, and move on.  It's not like it happens all the time, it's less than a one in a million thing.  It would be different if it was a nail, or a mouse's tail, or something, that would show negligence.  But bones are quite natural in chickens, I'm quite sure almost all of them have them. (except maybe Jabba the Cluck)|`|Wa2fpDLFaa	Never go to Burger King|`|9AnNb7Tbaa	You could ask Burger King what happened with that or ask them to be more careful about what they do when they make their food.|`|4CDGiSRwaa	Spit it out and throw it in the trash for starters.

Demand a meaningful explanation and if you're not happy do not hesitate to take it to higher up management than exists at that store.  BK sells "food" on it being fast and reliable for what it is. If it's failing in this then there is no reason to patronise the establishment.
