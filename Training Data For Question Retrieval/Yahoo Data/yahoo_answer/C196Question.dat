20090308030207AARbHzN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Im confused ... negative test but no period?	I have been off my birthcontroll since november because my health card expired and i wasnt able to get another on untill just recently. im back on my birthcontrol as of sunday. from november till now i have been having unprotected sex. he uses the pull out method but i know for a fact that it doesnt work. I realize that if i am pregnant it is both of our faults and i am willing to deal with the consequances.       I am just confused. before i started birthcontroll a year ago i used to get my period for like 2 sometimes 3 weeks and then not get it for 2 to 3 months but since i have been on birthcontroll its always been regular .. even scince i got off of my birth controll its always been on time and usually lasts for about 4 to 5 days. but this month i missed it ... completly missed it. i took a pregnancy test but it came up negative. i have never missed a preiod its always just been late but its been over a week now that its late and i took the test and its negative so im confused y the test says negative but i havent gotten my period. the only symptoms i am having is im always tired no matter how much sleep i get, and i am starting to notice i go to the bathroom alot more but i dont think that symptom comes till later and then of course the missed period.       Any one have any imput ?? i would really appriciate everyones advice. cause i have thought this thing to death and am still very confused

I wake up from the pain & change sides but I'm changing sides at least a dozen times a night, combined with the trips to the bathroom it's making for a very disrupted sleep.

I'm wondering if anyone's had any success with the full body pillows & if so, which type/style & any suggestions when buying one would be great!       Thank you!

20090308035837AA5zV45	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Should men be allowed an opinion when it comes to abortion?	Someone once told me that you can't actually have an opinion on right-to-life and abortion until you have been put through that situation yourself. As a woman I often worry about being raped and what I would do if I got pregnant and in the end I have decided that I'll consider the issue if I ever get put in that situation. Obviously a man can never be put into such a situation and yet men often act as though they have the authority to decide whether or not women should be allowed to abort, and under which circumstances. It is true that men are the father or the aborted foetus, but it is the woman who plays the major part here, and it is her body which suffers.      What is your opinion?

20090308043610AA7G1Ct	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	How do you prepare your 6 y/o?	My son lives in Germany with my husband and I. We have lived here for 15 months. My ex signed a legal paper agreeing to let my son move here with us and also the paper allowing my son to get a passport without both parent present. That was in October 2007 and we moved here in Dec 2007.  The last time my son saw his biological father was in July 2006 and the last time they spoke was in Oct 2007. His bio-dad took off in July '06 and every time that he spoke to my son on the phone it was ME who called him and asked if he wanted to talk to his son. When we moved here, I sent my ex a letter giving him our new address, phone number and my email address. Before we left, I sent him a letter with my moms address and phone number and my email address because I wasnt sure what our new ones were yet. We lived here for 2 months before we got our internet hooked up so I didnt check my email. When I did, I got a threatening email from my ex's sister. Basically, she said I was keeping my son from his father and I needed to give her my contact info to her. I emailed it to her. I then got an email from my ex mother in law thanking me for my cooperation and she also asked for my address and phone number. I gave it to her also. A couple months later, she emailed me again saying my ex couldnt contact me because his cell wouldnt let him call internationally. I called him a few times with no answer. I stopped calling because I dont think it is my responsibility to call him, if he wants contact, he needs to do it. I called my ex about 3 months ago to get his new address for insurance reasons. He yelled at me and insisted I was keeping my son from him. Which Im not. I even offered to pay half of a round trip ticket for my son to visit him 1-2 times a year. (I was awarded sole legal custody in the divorce and he was to have temporary periods of physical placement) During that phone call, I again gave our contact info to him. No call, no email, no card or letter ever! UNTIL, 2 weeks ago I got an email saying "I want to talk to my son, contact me at this email address" I again emailed back our phone number.      Sorry that was so long. I just feel that I need to get all the info out there so you have an idea of whats going on.      Question is: How do I prepare my son for a "possible" phone call from his biological father after over 15 months? My son does not ask about him and considers my husband his father. I dont intend to keep phone calls from my son but I think he should be prepared incase his biological father decides to call.      Thank you in advance!

20090308041659AAkLHly	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	What do you think of these names?	Ok, first of all, the middle name has been decided by the father to be Hilario. Hilario is his middle name and his grandfathers name. It is a hispanic name and is pronounced ee-lar-ee-oh with the r rolled. He says our son must have that name. So with that middle name, it makes it hard to find a first name that sounds good with it.      But he likes the names Adrian and Gabriel. I like the names Anthony and Ryan. I like these names because they are not as popular as Christopher or Matthew. The names we've chosen are used, just not as popular. I don't want a popular name. I went thru my yearbook to help me a little and these names maybe are used 20 times vs. Christopher being used 300 times.      Oh, and my grandfathers name was Anthony, well, Antonio, but I thought maybe to give him names of his grandfathers. I dunno. What do you think?      Please only chose from Adrian, Gabriel, Anthony, and Ryan

20090308044738AAl7oEz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Teen mothers: Are you in a stable relationship with the baby's father?	I don't know how I'd cope if I wasn't, since I'm living with his family and they are finacially supporting us.

20090308040655AAXhtqn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How early can you tell that you're pregnant?	So it's been a week since me and my boyfriend did the deed. We're both 18, it was my first time and it was unprotected and he didn't -ahem- finish, if you know what I mean... Still, there's pre-*** and all that jazz, so I'm super worried. We got to the pharmacy after approx. 48 hours and got Plan B, but it's only 89% effective.       I'm only 2 days late for my period so far, and I'm driving myself crazy with the "what ifs". I could just be stressing so bad that I've forced it to be late, but I'm pretty much always stressed and it stays consistent every month.      Ever since I took Plan B, I've had an extremely sore lower abdomen, and it's gotten worse the past few days. The instructions said pain was only supposed to last 24 hrs, and it's been 6 days now. My breasts are also extremely sore--worse than they get when I'm PMSing. I've been extremely moody (could be lack of sleep due to stressing over this) and kind of nauseous. And (I'm not sure if this is a symptom) I've noticed I've had excessive saliva the past couple days...       So how early can I take a test to be sure and get some sleep? I told my boyfriend if I don't get my period by Wednesday, I'm taking a test, but should I maybe wait a few days longer? I just don't know how much more sleep I can lose over this. Any suggestions? Sorry for the long post... :P      And please no lecturing about safe-sex and blahblahblah. I obviously realize my mistake, so save it. Thanks.

20090308072432AAjyeKV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	So those of you who think rap music is bad?	Have you not paid attention to mainstream rock right now?      Have you forgotten about The Jonas Brothers, Kate Perry, Miley Cyrus, Fall Out Boy, MCR, all american rejects, demi lavato, Paramore, FOB, Boys Like Girls? If i'm correct, those are shitty rock bands of mainstream 2000s rock. I know you don't think that's better. And i notice that many rock fans like bands from the 60s/70s. So that means Rock isn't putting out any good modern music either. So i guess your all hypocrites. Rap music was good in the 80s/90s, but alot of rap fans just don't like the old school music. They'd rather hear the bad mainstream rap of the 2000s (2006 and up). So if rock fans would rather hear 2000s rock instead of classic rock, you guys would be in the same situation.       So now what do you have to say?

20090308075930AA4qyjf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Get rid of the dog or the boy?	we have a two yr old son, 10 months old daughter, and a 7 month old boston terrier.  we got the dog from my mother in law.  so anyway, my 2 yr old taunts the dog. he runs string across his face, tries to ride him, chases him, and wakes him up. i tell him "be nice to the dog bc u love him" the first time, the second time is the same ting with a threat to time out, and on the third time it is a straight shot to time out, and i put the dog away.  The problem is that my husband thinks that the 2 yr old shouldnt have to be told 3 times, and the dog should be able to stay in.  "He should only have to be told once.  When we were kids we acted right when daddy was around bc he would beat us if we didnt" is what my husband says. so he thinks the dog should sit up on a pedestal while the kids tip toe around him. i think the dog should either be outside in the kennel or in his crate if he is causing a distraction for my son.  what do u think?

20090308052356AAg95Lx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Wow seriously? Why are some people such downers!? Read this woman's answer!?	So I was just reading the other answers to one of the questions I answered yesterday & I was completely SHOCKED to hear what one woman had to say!       The question was what age is right to have a baby and this woman's answer was    "...You may decide you don't want any at all.       Kids are hard work, and those beautiful babies grow up to be teenagers, and that, hon, is for sure no fun... not for the parents or anyone else who has to deal with them. Look at all the questions under Adolescence in this section. Crazy, and very sad... ":I hate my mom... how can I stand to be in this house another 5 years????" and similar questions...      My mom always said, don't have children outside of a solid relationship, and even if you do, don't have any more than you yourself can support.." Your kids and your education are forever::::::Husbands, lovers and promises are not."      Do you have that degree?       Do you have a solid job?       And are you willing to step to the plate for 2 decades, (him as well) and provide a loving home in which to raise children who likely will grow up and not even like you.????????...       google any of this. (Most kids don't pay too much attention to their parents. Is this what you wish to do with your life? Because you won't be out from under them until you are 46 or so.... into middle age.      EDIT: And you will read all the answers from all these pregnat women who are sooooo ready to be parents. Yup. They all stay concerned even thru grade 6. As soon as that kid is an 8th grader --- 13, they don't even show up to Back to School Night. And the ones that do, are generally in the wrong room!!..."            WOW Does anyone else never want to have children now?!! I mean.. This just aggrevates me to no end that someone would come on here and say all that and basically try to tell people that no matter what th ey do they're kids are going to hate them later which I personally do not believe is true! I love both of my parents and happen to be REALLY close with my mom!       Anyways, what are everyone's thoughts on this!? Do you guys think that she gave an accurate description of what it's like to have kids once they turn 13? I mean.. she made it sound so horrible that now I'm almost scared to have the baby I'm pregnant with!

20090307160151AAYZV1b	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Asked before but not getting a lot of responses. What you think?	So starting at midnight yesterday I was having really bad contractions that were waking me up like every half an hour. They weren't really horrible but they were painful and I was also having EXTREME back pain. Well I woke up and was still having them and around 10am I went to the bathroom and there was a lot of blood. I told my husband and he was like freaking out and so I called the doctor and they wanted me to come in. Well I'm still having contractions about every 15 minutes at this point and they can't see me until 3:15pm. Well I go in there and they check me and I'm still completely closed and I forgot to ask them how effaced I was because I was 50% on Feb 26th. After I left the doctors office I was still having really bad contractions that were about 10 minutes apart and they were getting really painful. Well last night they seemed to calm down a little bit and I only woke up to them about 3 times but I'm not sure if I was having others and just not waking up. Today I haven't had as many but my lower back is still really hurting me. Does this sound normal? I'm in so much pain and I really can't believe that I haven't started dilating yet. Does anyone think I may start dilating soon?       Also I'm about 37 weeks along!

20090308070040AA1k8pH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Am I being an over strict parent here?	My 15 year old daughter and three of her friends decided to skip school for the afternoon on Thursday (some footballer was in town)      The school realised this pretty quickly and issued each girl with two weeks of after school detention unless they could provide evidence of their parents excusing them from school that afternoon.      Unbelievably the girls parents agreed to do this. My initial reaction was to back up the school.       Howvever, I find it unfair that she will be serving detention alone: particulalry as I will have to pick her up each night from school.      Should i just sign the note so she avoids the detentions: she will be separately punished at home...

20090308053602AAuIzvP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Everyone who is trying to concieve... Please read!?	I wanted to tell all of you my experience yesterday. So you know how some women take Guaifenesin the active ingredient in Robbitussin and Mucinex to thin their cervical mucus so it makes it easier for the sperm to swim? Lol. Well, I took a 400mg tablet of it the day before yesterday, and that night I fell asleep and woke up shortly after that because I wasn't breathing. My heart was beating really fast, it was scary but that happened to me before a long time ago and I have asthma, so I just went back to sleep. The next day, I took another one. Me and some girls of mine decided to go out. Well, We were in the car and I felt so sick to my stomach, like I was gonna puke, and I never puke. And I was drinking a Pepsi when my friend said something really funny. I tried to swallow the Pepsi before I started laughing. Well, I started gagging and dry heaving, next thing I knew I couldn't breath. I could exhale but everytime I would try to inhale it felt like the back of my throat was closed. So yeah, I was definately having an asthma attack. I made my friend find my inhaler in my purse. It took a couple minutes but it gradually got better. Today, I kept thinking about it because I've only had one asthma attack and it wasn't nearly as bad as that. And I thought about the fact that I had taken that pill. So I was looking at up on the internet and found an article about a 15 year old boy. He had taken some Vicks cough syrup and the active ingredient was Guaifenesin. He took it, 20 minutes later he had an asthma attack and died. Nothing would help him. So the point that I'm trying to get at is all you ladies who have asthma, and also people who smoke too. Don't try the whole Guaifenesin thing. I don't want people going to the hospital or dying... I just wanted to tell all of you this. So I can prevent it from happening to any of you.?

At my 22 week check up I was 172. I'm now 2 days shy of 25 weeks and weigh 180. do you think my body is making up for the weight I didn't gain the first 5 months of pregnancy, or am I gaining weight too fast. I don't eat junk food. I eat out once every week or two. I eat the same as I did the first five months. My next appt is on the 10th of march. I'm definitely gonna ask my doctor about it. I just want your opinion. Thank you in advance.

If i'm having this much difficulty now when i have not even had a baby, i worry about when i have a kid.. what will my stomach look like then!? I don't even wanna think about it.. the thought of it makes me sick. I really can't love myself if my body isn't right and sadly, i don't expect any man to love it either. As it is right now, my stomach is not bad... it is a little chubby, but i can hide it pretty well and i am still working on it and it has been improving with my latest exercises and stuff. I am just really worried about having a baby and my stomach looking really bad. I just don't think i can deal with it!   Do you worry about this? And how do you cope?

My cycles for the past two months have been 29 days. before that they were a little off, no more then 33 no less then 26 days. This month i got my period on 2.14 and it went away on 2.19 it was completely normal.

20090308013653AAm0N8R	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Took provera, and still no period after a week?	I started taking provera 10mg for 10 days to get my period. I am aware that it can take a few days after ending the pill to get your period. However, I am now done taking provera, I am on day 7 now (a week past taking it), and still no period, and no sign of it coming. I have had sore nipples for the past 4 days, and have been extremely tired. I am also on 2000mg of Metformin, and when or if I get my period I'll be starting clomid 100mg days 5-9. Could I be pregnant or something? I have taken provera before but I don't remember my nipples being sooo sore! I am pretty sure every time I've taken provera, my period started right away. What should I do? What do you think? I AM TTC

I bought an Angelsounds doppler a few weeks ago and first picked up the heartbeat about 2-3 weeks ago. I'm feeling a bit of movement every day now so I'm not worried, but it's just strange that sometimes I can pick up the heartbeat immediately, sometimes it takes a while, and other times I get nothing at all. Why is this? I'm guessing it's probably baby's position but am just wondering what other peoples experiences are of using dopplers? Thanks

We have decided to start keeping her in bed with us because it is easier to soothe her back to sleep while she's in bed with us instead of us having to get up and go to her crib in her bedroom accross the hall. This is my second child and I have never slept with them in bed! I am a bit nervous about it. I'm wondering what accesories are out there and if they are any good, like a co-sleeper or something you put in bed with you to lay the baby in, etc...? Any thoughts, advice, ideas are welcome! Thanks!

Also found out that she is 38 weeks right now instead of 37 weeks. She is really nervous about having to go through with a c section, especially this being our first baby, and being so young. I heard there are ways to turn a breech baby. If anyone knows, please let me know. She really wants to try and do this because she doesn't want to have a c section. She is terrified of going through it.

20090308010510AAkxNJn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant and very confused. I need advice.?	Ok well I'm 19 soon to be 20 and i found out i was pregnant about 5 days ago. I hadn't gotten my period since october but took many tests and all were negative. I started feeling nauseous about 2 weeks ago and 5 days ago i asked my mom to tell me what medicine to take. She recommended something but told me to take another test which came out positive. So my mom, sister, and boyfriend know. The thing is that she wants me to tell my dad and i dont want to yet because i know he'll get mad unless i'm married. My bf and i were planning on marrying on my b-day (march 16) before knowing i was pregnant and are still doing so. Should i wait to tell my dad until i'm legally married? or is my mom right? (by the way, my mom jokingly told my dad i was pregnant in december and he got really mad at me and told me i had to get married right away.) and also, she and i were the only ones awake last night and she told me to tell my dad and i said i had decided to tell him later and she told me to go to her bedroom to talk. when i was walking towards her she shook my dad and woke him up and tried to force the truth out of me. What do you think about that? am i wrong for not telling him right away? sorry it's so long!!!

20090308011804AAitajT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Shortening of the cervix at 25 weeks!?	hi guys, basically let me give you a bit of background, me and my wife lost our first baby at 23 weeks due to fetal abruption back in 2003, in 2004 we had a baby boy who went full term with no complications.   now my wife is pregnant again and all was going well at 20 wks her cervix measured 45mm but then at 23 weeks it measured 35mm and so she was prescribed progesterone supositry (cyclogest 200mg) and told to use one each night, and also told to have total bedrest all of which we done however on friday we returned to the hospital at 25 wks and her cervix has now shortened to 26mm so she has been told to carry on with the progesterone and bed rest and told she most probably will have a pre-term labour!      now my questions, at what point will her cervix be too short to hold the baby in? would she be better in hospital in a controlled enviroment? what exactly does progesterone do? and most importantly if the baby is born at around 28 weeks what are the chances of it surviving and living a healthy life?      thanks for taking the time to read this.

I'm not too sure when my menses are due, but if it's 29th feb, then I'm late for more than a week. If it's 5th march, then I'm late for about 3 days already.       Took a pregnancy test but not with first morning urine on 7th march, and it was a negative.       Does this mean it's negative for sure? Or do I need another test to find out?

20090308054914AABf2Gl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	What do you think of this name?	My best friend will give birth in about three days or so and she's asking me to give two middle names for the baby. Her first name would be Marie.I kinda wanted to name the baby after her mom and her mom's dad. My best friend's name is Ileana. Her father's name is Dominic. so I came up with this name:      Marie Eleone Dominique      Eleone is pronounced as EL-YON...And I really don't know where I got it but i really like how it sounds. What do you think? You can suggest names if you want. Thanks a lot!!!

20090227143821AAnWRr1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Am I being selfish? A baby shower question.?	Right now I am currently 29 weeks pregnant. This is my 2nd child, 3rd pregnancy. My first pregnancy I did not have a baby shower because my daughter came unexpectedly at 29 weeks. My second pregnancy ended in an early miscarriage. This time I have been on bedrest for three months and am expected to carry to about 36 weeks at the latest. (Although I think that is in God's hands and am optimistic we could carry full term.) Anyhow, my sister just had her 2nd child this January. We had her a nice baby shower with her first pregnancy. This last one however, we were planning her one (mainly I was) and I got put on strict bedrest. Nobody INCLUDING my sister moved forward with the babyshower, and therefore she did not have one.       My husband and I decided that after this delivery I am going to have a tubal done because of the risk of health issues for myself and child in future pregnancies. My mom, granny, and me decided on a date for my baby shower. We are havining it when I get 35 weeks along because that's when I am no longer required to be on bed rest. I have decided to start making invitations because it will give me something to do while I'm laying in this bed. The problem is that my mom keeps pushing me to have a baby shower with my sister. Am I selfish for wanting my own? I've never had one, and after the tubal I will not have a chance to have one. I really don't want to make anyone upset or hurt anyone. It's not even about the gifts because I don't need much I kept all my things from my first daughter. It's just the memories and being able to write about it in her baby book. And I have not been allowed out of bed for will be 4 months. I lay in a room by myself all day..it would just be nice to be able to enjoy this pregnancy and celebrate that I've made it this far after all we've been through. And when my sister had her daughter in Jan I offered her all my baby stuff and people even bought her stuff but she wouldn't take it.  Honest opinions please. Thanks so much!

(sorry if this is a bit long but PLEASE help)      right, i missed two pills around the middle/end of jan, and had unprotected sex on the second day of the missed pill. im not too sure when my last period came that month but it came before i missed the pills.   i havent had my period since and now im guessing its around the time my second period should have came.   ive missed two pills before without having sex and my period still came at the right time so it cant be because missing the pills have messed up my period.      there has been a few times that i have felt like i was going to get my period. the first was about 3 weeks ago, the second was 2 weeks ago (very strongly thought i was going to come on), and a about 2 or 3 other random times this week (the feeling wasnt so strong).      i took a test yesterday morning but i didnt have alot of pee so the negative line came up really slowly too.   i forgot to wait 5 minuits.   i checked about 2 hours later, there was a REALLY really faint positive line that i could only see in some angles of the light.   im not sure if that was there because i left it too long or what :/      i dout anythings wrong with me because i got checked out for something else with an internal and external scan about a week before the unprotected sex and i was fine then..       when should i test again!?      and is it likely that im pregnant?

20090308065438AABsN0j	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Question about cramping?	If anyone has read any of my previous post you know it has been an odd month for me.....Well, I just finished what I assume was my "period" around 4 days ago. It was much lighter than I am used to, but I'm not sure if it would be considered spotting as most of the time it was brown in color, but there was one day where there was red mixed with the brown. Anyway, since I have been off of my "period"  I keep having little twinge almost like pinching pains mostly in my right ovary, but it skips around. Sometimes it is in my left and sometimes it is in the center. Does anyone have any idea what this could be? Should I be worried? My fiance and I are TTC but just started not to long ago, and I do think that my last period was just being wacky, but what do you guys think?

We are also using pre-seed & opk so idk what more we can do this will be only month 4 for us but i would think we are both in our early 20's that it maybe a little easier for us...Guess i was wrong lol!!..Oh and where can he go to get his sperm analized just his regular phyician. I went to my obgyn & she said i am all good and reccomened that for us! I forgot to tell you fertility issues are very common on my side of the family thats why we are a little nervous!

20090308065906AA6xDuc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Am i being an over zealous parent here?	My 15 year old daughter and three of her friends decided to skip school for the afternoon on Thursday (some footballer was in town)      The school realised this pretty quickly and issued each girl with two weeks of after school detention unless they could provide evidence of their parents excusing them from school that afternoon.      Unbelievably the girls parents agreed to do this. My initial reaction was to back up the school.       Howvever, I find it unfair that she will be serving detention alone: particulalry as I will have to pick her up each night from school.      Should i just sign the note so she avoids the detentions: she will be separately punished at home...

I have been having contraction all day today they range from being 5 to 7 minutes apart and I am passing tons of mucus with blood in it the contractions last 30 to 60 seconds and some are more painful then others. They increase when i walk but they don't let up when I am sitting they just don't happen as much. I called my doc and she said to wait to come in until they are 3 to 5 minutes apart.

20090308071536AAOLUFN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What are the chances of getting pregnant when...?	When you always use protection but your husband wants to see what it feels like without it.       My husband and I have used condoms since day one and we were both virgins on our wedding day. He wanted to see what it would feel like without a condom on so we made love for about a minute or so without a condom to experiment. What are the chances of me getting pregnant from the precum? He then put a condom on and we finished so I figure it would have pushed any sperm up closer. I know that precum does contain a small amount of sperm.       I have been having dreams every night since that I was pregnant so I am curious.

But I want mens point of view on this. Seeing as they are the ones that live with it their entire life.

But my question is for men. What are your views and opinions about circumcision? As a grown man, do you wish your mother chose the opposite for you. And what would you chose for your son?

So, I realize I shouldn't let it bother me,  but it just irritates me a little to read questions from people who are OBVIOUSLY not pregnant and they are asking if they should take a test. I'm not talking about people who are only a day late or so.    I'm talking about the people who think they are a month pregnant, feeling the baby move, and getting a belly. Most of these girls report they are still having a period.    It just seems so obvious to me that they are not pregnant, hell, if you want to spend money on another test - go do it, but it will be like the last 5 you took - all negative.

We've tried Avent, Playtex (drop in's) and now we are using Dr. Browns.  We have used Mylicon Drops, Little tummy gas drops and Gripe water.. She barely sleeps and i am feeling run down.

I have an irregular period ranging 28-35 days, average is 35. I am TTC and a little confused. I am usually the ovulation digital clear blue. My last cycle started Feb 12. As my average is 35 I started testing day 18 (March 1). I tested for 8 days after that so I am onto my 25th day. I noticed on March 2nd I had cramps, and on the third I had a little vaginal fluid but barely nothing. Yesterday March 7th I had really sore tender breast. Today they are sore but not as much. I gave up with the ovulation tests because I figured  I missed my ovulation and my period is coming. I am not used to reading all these signs as I am new to TTC, I usually get tender breast a week before my period. If my period is starting in the next couple of days I must have missed my ovulation? I had no vaginal fluid. Or could the tender breast be that my ovulation is coming but that would be really late. Could stressing over this cause me to not ovulate?

But it seems that now instead of using the name of things he calls everything "this" or "that". For the last month I have been purposely removing this and that as much as possible from my vocabulary to encourage him to say the names of the objects instead, but he won't.      I know that he understands the words, because he'll follow simple directions like, where's your hat. He also points to his ear, belly, hair when asked. If I ask if he's thirsty he walks to the fridge and points to it. We read a lot of picture books, but nothing seems to encourage him to name objects? Any thoughts on more ways to encourage him?

20090308091108AA2tMok	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Please help I'm kinda crying?	Don't think I'm a crybaby, I'm a 16 year old boy and I never cry. But something happened that really made me sad. My dad and me were supposed to go to the gun show in my town this weekend. My dad said he was gonna spend more time with me cause he never spends time with me ever. Today we were supposed to go, and i talked to him and asked when were we going, and he said he isnt going to go because theres a $7 entry fee and he doesnt want to spend the money. I really, REALLY wanted to go with him just so we could spend time together, but he isn't going to do it because of the $7 entry fee. He said its hard to make money and he doesnt want to spend it going to a gun show, even though we certainly arent poor cvause hes an accountant. This gun show is only once a year (or at least very seldom) and we never go. I've only been once with him when I was 11. When he told me he didnt want to spend the money ($14 for both of us) it really made me want to cry and now I am. Its not even cause I wanted to go to the gun show, its cause he won't even spend 14 dollars to spend some quality time with me which he never does anyway. Am I just being a crybaby or not?

20090308085416AAvPoXi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby poop has weird curds in it...has anyone seen something like this before?	My 8-mo old solid-food-eating has been unwell for 5 days. No fever anymore, well hydrated but very irritable. He stopped eating food except for a little banana and pear.  He's nursing a lot.  I gave him some milk-based formula that he's used to, to prevent him from losing weight, since he's drinking but not eating.  His poop has reverted to the yellow breast-fed smell & consistency, but there are some weird curds in it: they look like small grains of puffed wheat, are white and shaped like beans, and are squishy like cheese.  Any ideas??  I'm taking him to the doctor tomorrow. THX

20090308091110AA1UBg9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How to deal with my son and daughter?	My 12-year-old son and my 13-year-old daughter generally get along pretty well, but they do like to tease each other from time to time. My son, believing for some reason that it’s cute or funny, will sometimes give his sister a “titty twister” or hit her on her breasts, which are just developing. I dont think he does it to be cruel but rather as I said he finds it cute or funny, as a way to tease her.       I’ve attempted to deal with this by taking away some of his privileges and by talking with him about how sensitive a girl’s breasts are. I’ve really tried to convey that to him, even likening a girl’s breasts to his balls. Each time, he seems to listen and seems to respond well, and he even apologizes to her and it always sounds like he means it - but then a few days or a few weeks later he is back at it.      Anyway, my daughter, God bless her, doesn’t like to tattle on her brother. As I mentioned, they have a pretty good relationship, for brother and sister. She approached me today (presumably after he did it again, although she wouldn’t say), and she asked me this question: The next time he does it, could she give him a taste of his own medicine by giving him a kick in the balls (not too hard)? I said that I would think about it and would talk with her later.       Naturally, it would pain me to see my son get booted in the berries so to speak, but I really sympathize with my daughter in this situation.  Since I have tried taking away privileges and tried talking with him (all to no avail), I’m leaning toward giving her the green light to give him a taste of his own medicine.       I’m looking for your views on 1) whether I should give her permission fr her to do it; and 2) assuming I give her that permission, whether I should be on the sidelines, so to speak, to make sure nothing gets out of hand.      Thanks!
