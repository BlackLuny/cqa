Usually, the .jpeg can be shortened to .jpg with no problems.<br>  <br>  JPEG is an acronym for<br>  Joint Photographic Experts Group <br>  <br>  It is pronounced "jay-peg". <br>  <br>  JPEG is a colour image compression technique. It can reduce files to about 5% of their original file size. However, the more you compress a jpeg the more detail is lost. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!<br>  Troy Downing|`|Irdj2KAFaa	In computing, JPEG (pronounced JAY-peg; IPA: /?d?e?p?g/) is a commonly used method of compression for photographic images|`|79jtufEzaa	On some versions of Windows, especially older ones, it only allows one type of image file to be your desktop - Bitmap (.BMP).<br>  <br>  But windows will allow it if "Active Desktop" is enabled.<br>  To enable it, right click a blank area of your desktop and choose Active Desktop, then "View as Web Page".<br>  <br>  Alternately, you can use an image converter to convert the file from JPG to BMP.

Puz4ggr8aa	In bar charts you can't  create breaks (or skip values) along the X axis because the intent of a bar chart is to compare values by depicting them as bars with values in proportion to their size.<br>  <br>  A minimum value above zero can be set to support showing small differences among a group of large values.  And a logarithmic scale is supported to depict values that increase geometrically.<br>  <br>  But I would be surprised if you could find any charting software that includes the code necessary to support omitting chunks of a chart to, for example, make it appear that the difference between 10 and 30 is the same as the difference between 30 and 40.  <br>  <br>  Not that it isn't possible to develop a scenario where that would be sensible.  But because it would not make sense often enough to justify the effort required to include code support for it.

I haven't used cobol in over 20 years myself.<br>  <br>  This page gives a really good explanation of Cobol syntax (e.g., PIC X(N) which is a way to define a variable). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL</a><br>  <br>  <br>  As far as copybooks are concerned. Major reasons for using COPYBOOKs in COBOL are to:<br>  <br>  ensure that everyone uses the identical version of a data layout definition or procedural code. <br>  make it easier to cross reference where components are used in a system. <br>  make it easier to change programs when needed (only one master copy to change). <br>  save programmer time by not needing to code long data layouts (minor, but useful). <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copybook" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copybook</a>|`|eab67f43c0cff3a2dc3c807267bbd536aa	PIC X(nn) where X specifies the data is character form and nn are length in bytes of the data.<br>  Example:  05 Last-Name  pic X(28). <br>  means 28 bytes length of character for data of last name.<br>  <br>  COPY  C500.<br>  C500 is the copy member name in a source library.  The copy member contains programming source codes in many languages mostly for record descriptions, I/O operation, common routines, error handling; etc. to save coding time.  When the program is compiled, the source codes from the library will be retrieved and inserted into the program. However, when changing in a copybook, all programs containing the changed copybook must be re-compiled to get new codings.<br>  <br>  does it make sense?
K4zovvVhaa	Unless it was overheating (still abnormal, but maybe just having airvents blocked or internal fan broken) you are probably going to need a warranty claim or to visit a repair shop. Try to get a test charger and see if that is it.<br>  Depending on the model you can browse the Internet for "explode" views (instructions on how to open it) and try to clear the CMOS (BIOS settings). On some models you can do it by starting it with a combination of keys pressed. As you don't get power into it, this is unlikely the root cause.<br>  One last caveat - when you give it away (leave it in the repair shop etc) ask yourself what data you have on the harddrive - and ask for it to be removed and given to you on the spot if you did not do it yourself already.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Sounds like your internal power converter is fried.<br>  <br>  Leave it off for 24 hours - without power and without battery.<br>  <br>  Try again.<br>  <br>  If it doesn`t work - get it fixed if under warranty.|`|79jtufEzaa	This usually boils down to 2 common issues:<br>  Dead battery and dead AC adapter.<br>  <br>  Sometimes even plugging in directly won't work if there's a battery issue. Replace with a known good battery and then try a known good AC adapter (power cord).<br>  <br>  If you don't have one lying around you can try calling around local repair shops and see if they happen to have one that's compatible with your laptop. Otherwise you may have to gamble on buying a new one.<br>  <br>  ragebattery.com is pretty good for finding replacements.|`|g2ZLaomiaa	If you tried to charge a computer while plugged in, but it didn't work, this means that you will need to get a new charger so that you can get a recharged battery.

79jtufEzaa	I was thinking recently on how useful this would be:<br>  You make web pages but you're not a high-end professional.<br>  Your client wants to sell their products online.<br>  <br>  I'd love for an application or script that would let the client upload a photo and simple text file (no markup). The app would automatically resize the photo to a specified size, edit the text file to add a little markup (i.e. give the price its own CSS class), then insert the pic and text into a table of products you can buy. This table can then be uploaded as-is without any tweaking to the site, or maybe the upload part is skipped... the customer's just uploads the new text and pic (via this magic app) and php takes care of the rest, making their online store work.<br>  <br>  Basically, if a customer needs to add or change products in their online store, the website designer doesn't even need to get involved. If the customer can make a text file and get a digital picture onto their computer, the app takes care of the rest.|`|16bb895aed792c41a411d8f435338179aa	Running Web application is hard.

nUWkyRx6aa	You should buy a Canon document scanner. It's 2500 USD.|`|xfpJGBfwaa	Your scanner should have come with software that allows you to put several pictures on the platen at once, and then it will separate them for you after scanning automatically.<br>  <br>  If not, then try to find software that does that.  <br>  <br>  What do you mean "without stopping"?  You have to arrange the pictures in between scans, right?  Or do you mean a scanner that automatically takes a stack of pictures and scans them one by one like a copier?  I don't know if that exists, but maybe a high end multifunction copier/printer could do it.    <br>  <br>  Ask at Kinko's or another copy center if they can do it for you more quickly and for a reasonable price.  It's not worth buying a new scanner just for one project.|`|I7YwG0Mcaa	If you have so many scans that it will take you a ton of time to do it I would recommend using a scanning service. My family used <a href="http://www.discountdigitalart.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.discountdigitalart.com</a><br>  They were happy with the results and the price was better than buying a new scanner just for one project.

You can restrict the input value to make it easier, no dashes or spaces, etc., in which case you only look for 9 numbers. You generally want to exclude numbers that are purely consecutive (123456789), all the same number (111111111), etc..

WPT3C7MAaa	If your can't buy a new one, refurbished is the way to go. It's safer than buying a used one off ebay or something. <br>  <br>  Refurbished means it has been tested by a certified professional and you have a warranty on it. So the risk of having any trouble is greatly diminished.
2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa	I agree, you've already got enough RAM for games like Civ4 and Sims.  Besides, your computer only has 2 memory slots (which are full).  To upgrade the RAM further you'd have to pull your existing pair of 1gb chips and replace them with a pair of 2gb chips- you can't just add to what's already installed.<br>  <br>  If you wanted to max out your RAM anyway, it's not very expensive- about $50, plus some pretty nice rebates:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220269" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227269" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  I recommend going to crucial's website and running their memory scanner tool to confirm the exact speed of memory that your motherboard takes, although I'm pretty sure the ones above would work.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.crucial.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.crucial.com</a><br>  <br>  On the video card- the previously mentioned Radeon 3870 is great for that price (it normally retails for around $120)  but overkill for your purposes. It also probably wouldn't work in your system as-is, because it's an older model which sucks a lot of power (81W at maximum).  To use that card, you'd need to upgrade your power supply.<br>  <br>  I recommend the Radeon 4670 instead- it's a newer model which uses much less power (47W max).  Thw would run happily with your system's stock power supply.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121274" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HVoEsd49aa	That should be fine for both, but if you want to run Sims 3 or other future games well, I recommend you upgrade your Graphics Card.|`|vk1Wt2wFaa	For those games, you may just want to upgrade your graphics card.

But i havent been able to afford a mac in forever and computer are so fast now i find it no need to have anything "top of the line anymore". The old computers from 2 years go do the trick just as good for what i want. Watching dvd, playing on the internet and emailing. You dont need 4 gigs for all that. But back in the day with xp, computers would run slow and macs would easily out blast them in performance. <br>  <br>  I do like macs though cause it easier to find things. The search in vista is much better than the search in xp. If you cant find something in xp, and you forgot where you put, its lost.

AA10570173	InDesign has various screen display settings. Unless you actually embedded the image, it will display (by default) at a low resolution. This is not the actual image, it's a thumbnail of the image. The reason for this is if you actually embedded every image you want into the InDesign file, it would make the file huge, and it would slow down and possibly even crash the program (depending on how much RAM you have, and how much memory is alloted to InDesign AND just what you are doing in the program). So to keep things workable, InDesign normally uses a linked thumbnail at a low resolution. You can increase that display resolution, but I wouldn't do it unless you absolutely have to.<br>  <br>  When you go to print, you will want to run Preflight and Packaging. Preflight checks for problems (like missing image links, missing fonts, images set to RGB when they should be CMYK, and so on) and Packaging will grab everything you need to be able to correctly print the file, including those images that are linked to the InDesign document, and the fonts you used. This way if you were to send the InDesign document to a printer, they would have everything they need to product the document correctly. (You can also export as a PDF, and it will put all the images into the PDF for you.)<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

In the login screen, leave the password blank and click the “Submit” button to log in.Enter the initial ISP settings such as user name and login details PPOE etc and any other information in the initial setup screen<br>  <br>  3) You need to know the name of the wireless network. To identify your wireless network, a name called the SSID is used. The SSID is your network name. The default network name of the Modem Router is “Belkin Wireless” followed by six digits that are unique to your Modem Router. Your network name will look something like “Belkin123456”. Click on the the “Wireless” tab in security and note down the SSID<br>  <br>  4) You need to setup a wireless network with security. I assume your laptop has wireless and that it is switched on. By default, wireless security on the router is disabled. To enable security, you will need access the security settings, click “Security” on the “Wireless” tab<br>  <br>  5)go to the “Security” page under “Wireless” and select “WPA/WPA2-Personal (PSK)” from the “Security Mode” drop-down menu<br>  <br>  6)For “Authentication”, select “WPA-PSK this will need to be the same when you come to set up the laptop wireless<br>  <br>  7)For “Encryption Technique”, select “TKIP”, “AES”, or “TKIP+AES”. This setting will have to be identical on the wireless clients that you set up.<br>  <br>  8)Enter your pre-shared key (PSK). This can be from eight to 63 characters and can be letters, numbers, or symbols. This same key must be used on all of the wireless clients that you set up. Write the PSK down on the underneath of the router in indelible ink<br>  <br>  9)Click “Apply Changes” to finish. You must now set all wireless clients to match these settings. You can now close the browser window<br>  <br>  10) Go to your laptop and disconnect the ethernet cable. In the bottom Rt corner and Rt click on the network icon for Windows XP click on view available networks, for Vista connect to a network<br>  <br>  11) Click on the network that matches the SSID you noted down and you should be asked for a passphrase/password which you wrote down underneath the router. Enter the passphrase, if all goes well you should now be able to connect. The passphrase is case sensitive and has to be entered EXACTLY as in the router<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.belkin.com/support/article/?lid=en&pid=F5D9230-4&aid=10177&scid=222" rel="nofollow">http://www.belkin.com/support/article/?l...</a>|`|4mt9IuzGaa	What error message does it give when you try the key?

ZQOipBvGaa	The 13+ legal stuff is realted to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). <br>  To say it briefly, that Act prevents companies to collect information from children under 13 without a proof of parental concent (in general, a Fax is a valid proof).<br>  <br>  So, the toys are NOT for 13+. The registration to the site (and the products buying process) is for 13+.<br>  <br>  I′m adding a link to COPPA in case you are interested in further information.|`|CsIvy5MAaa	WowWee recognizes that it is not permitted BY LAW or collect information about people under the age of 13 without proof of parental consent. WE therefore CHOOSE not to accept website registrations or contact information from anybody who is under the age of 13. (caps are for my emphasis)<br>  <br>  <br>  So basically, they can't create an account for a person under 13 without the parents consent, and confirming it's a parents consent instead of a child pretending is difficult at best(like it says above, they need proof), so instead of trying to implement that, they just don't allow people under 13. (This is a policy that most websites use.)|`|AA11142865	The toys on the website can be for under 13, but you are not supposed to register for the website unless you are over 13 (or have parent's permission I think I read.)  Everyone usually states this because of the Children's Online Policy Act.   Bascially, they don't want predators tracking kids. <br>  <br>  Most people just lie about their age. <br>  <br>  Online Privacy<br>  <br>  In addition to our standard Privacy Policy, WowWee voluntarily adheres to The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA).

As such, we choose not to accept website registrations (WowWeeMail, WowWeeClub) or contact information from those under the age of 13.

lt2CKQpzaa	A professional hi quality Crt is still better than most all Lcds. Yes- there are some very nice hi-def Lcd's out there, but there is a reason why some old timers still prefer the Crt. The range of resolution is one. I have a few Lcds that bite if they are asked to run in anything but their native resolution. The trick is to marry your display to a very very good graphics solution. A mid-range to better discrete video card makes even a cheesy Lcd look better. The last 21" Crt that I had to load for a customer pretty much cured me of keeping em anymore. That monitor was 85 lbs- 3 of my Lcds don't even come close to that!

cd3d6652026769d6c622057ae1142194aa	The best advice anybody can ever give you is to NOT listen to career tests, listen to your heart.<br>  <br>  Ever since I could remember I've had a profound love and interest for animals, and this is what I'm going to college for.  <br>  <br>  I suggest going out into the world and figuring out what job you like.  Do you like being outside?  Do you like working with your hands or with people?  Don't worry about what courses you should take until you figure out what career you actually want to take =) and then pursue that career with everything you have.|`|CmFldVDHaa	When I was in your place, I was confused too.<br>  It is true that I is really difficult to choose what you want to be.<br>  <br>  What I did is....<br>  I consulted my mom and dad<br>  <br>  and it worked!<br>  <br>  Remember:<br>  your mom and dad is still part of your life, try to get an advise BUT it will still be up to you.<br>  choose what you like most to do.|`|vbedfwsuaa	i think you should choose the subjects you are interested in........|`|BIoCl9Qqaa	there are people who go through life never finding the right career or job for them.   there is nothing wrong with that and a large number of people will change their minds on what to study once in college. <br>  <br>  you need to play to your skills and fancies.  do you like computers or can you be perfectly level headed when you see blood or when someone needs help?<br>  <br>  at 15 it is hard to say for sure what you would want to do. you might need more experiences with different subjects to open up ideas.  see if you can shadow someone for a few hours.  call up your doctor or local hospital and see if they will let you follow someone to get a feel for it.  Or some other field that interests you.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Most people spend the rest of their lives doing what they learned in uni, so decide what would make you eager to get to work every day.  I love solving problems, finding bugs and fixing them (I never run out - writing bugs is so easy) - so, even though I have an EE, I became a systems analyst later in life.<br>  <br>  If you do what a test tells you, you'll probably start looking forward to retirement by the time you're 30 (and have to keep slogging to work for 35 more years).|`|xetVyGOdaa	Don't worry, many people still don't know what they want to do much later in life, and most never got any help from careers advisors (in fact, most did the opposite). If you can make a hobby a career then you will live a blessed life. And if you can work for yourself rather than someone else, then go for it. Ever thought of web design?|`|2Q8MmK1aaa	what subjects do you like and what are you good at?<br>  take those I know it doesn't feel like it but unless you have a burning desire to follow a particular career path like vet/doctor it really doesn't matter to much what you take. Grades are more important.<br>  <br>  try looking at possible degree subjects you are interested in on university websites to see if they have requirements if you are really stuck this may help guide you<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|FhWOpW4waa	We'd need to know a whole lot more about you to make that kind of recommendation.  I was a shy, independent kinda guy at your age too, but just because I liked computers doesn't mean you do to.<br>  <br>  This is really the kind of question you need to ask people that actually know you and not just complete strangers on the internet.|`|n6IBfiDPaa	Since when do schools MAKE you choose what your career will be when youre 15?!<br>  I didnt know till I was like 20..and Im still not too positive if my major is right for me.<br>  Dont freak out. Most people dont know what they want to do|`|AjKnmWSRaa	just do pick what your heart tells you to pick

901930fc8f0cb1ce4a9483207715497baa	I hate to be the one to tell you this, but I've talked with ea games about sims 3 and laptops. And they told me the two will not mix well together.<br>  <br>  The game requirments listed on the site are not for a laptop computer, they are for desktop computers. And drivers for desktop and laptops are very different.<br>  <br>  So the game may run but, it probably will run very slowly and lag. This is why they created a sims 2 version for laptops called sims 2 stories.<br>  <br>  Now I can tell you a few basic's<br>  <br>  You laptops should have 2gb or more of system memory, you can find this out by click start, right click my computer, then properties.<br>  <br>  Your processor will also be listed there, processor for desktops and laptops vary. So you in order for the game to run at an okay pace you should have an intel processor, a duo would be better with a speed on 2.0 or better.<br>  <br>  You need to have about 7GB of free space on your hard drive. To find out how much space you have left on your computer, click my computer, right click the hard drive, click properties and look at the pie graph. Also you must always at all time have 15% of free space. This is a must.<br>  <br>  Now the hard and most important part next to the processor the graphic card. Click start, right click my computer, properties, hardware tab, device manager. Locate your graphic/video card there,.<br>  <br>  You wont be abel to go by the ones listed on the site as they are for desktops. So if you have a graphic card that is 512mb then that should be okay or if you have one that's called nVidia GeForce, then that should be good. Now if yours says moble, tne you only have a basic graphic card, which is not the best for playing the sims 3 game.<br>  <br>  Also on a note, I highly doubt this game will be sold out. It will not be a hard item to get, not like how it was with the nintendo wii and playstation 3 when they first game out.<br>  <br>  But the game would be better fit to be played on a desktop computer, however if you have a gaming laptop then you should be okay, but if you just a real basic laptop. The game will lag. If it were me I would have waited and see if they were going to release a laptop made version of the game.|`|CsIvy5MAaa	Right click on "my computer" and click properties<br>  <br>  Your processor and RAM will both load there.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now go to <br>  <br>  Start<br>  Run<br>  Type "dxdiag" (no quotes)<br>  <br>  Now goto display<br>  <br>  Your video info is there.|`|Wc1z4Kvdaa	In any version of Windows, right-click the "My Computer" icon and choose "Properties". The next window should show you quite a bit of the info you would need.<br>  <br>  Unless your laptop is very high-end, I would guess that you will NOT be able to play Sims 3 at a good enough speed.<br>  <br>  In preparation for Sims 3, I have upgraded my desktop with a very good video card (one with a GeForce 9800GTX+ processor). I play the Sims 2 with all video settings on high and I move around the game like liquid. I have a 3 GHz Core 2 Duo CPU. I am expecting the Sims 3 to run just as smooth as the Sims 2 with my new setup.<br>  <br>  Rule of thumb: Hardware specifications that software publishers give are usually only enough for the software to start up and run as slowly as humanly tolerable. Always add at least 50% to these specifications so that you get a better experience.

You can pick one up almost anywhere electronics are sold for about $10. If the plug is actually broken, you'll need to replace your motherboard, which will be fairly expensive and a lot of work.

xBtf4h1baa	go to www.media-convert.com, then from there click the "convert from file" tab. then its pretty much self explanatory from there but you click the browse button, find your file. then it should automatically detect what file it is. then scroll down a little, click the "select your output format" dropdown box and select the outcome format. then click the "i accept" check box and then click convert. its absolutely free and easy to use. all online, no software download required. a good site.

JmZ0Xfi9aa	Hmm, it stinks, first of all you promote the sites and now "Wow!  I'm here!"<br>  <br>  To answer your question Grizzom, oops Obywon...Windows registry is closed source which means conventional registry cleaners would not be able to differentiate.  It is effectively in my opinion, snake oils.  The whole industry of registry cleaners was born out of dubious adverts of claims that it can improve the performance of your computers, there is no evidence to back that up.  <br>  <br>  The real performance ehancers are already on Windows, they are Disk Defragment, Add/Remove (for removing needless programs), Startup (again to remove needless programs from Startup) and Disk Cleanup.  Use those, and you'll find your computer performing faster.  But in essence, registry cleaners will not enhance the performance of your computer. <br>  <br>  Registry gunk can prevent some programs from installing, for instance, remnants from uninstalling AVG (and other antivirus or internet security too) that prevents Kaspersky from installing, but the irony is, registry cleaners cannot remove the gunk left behind like AVG, you'll need AVG removal tool for that.|`|wNqNze1naa	registry cleaners can be very harsh on your system if you don't have a dr in computers and select exactly what you want the registry cleaner to do. this makes them look like they have no benefit or worse! but their not a scam.<br>  filehippo website is a good place to get a copy of ccleaner (crap cleaner) this is very light and effective, you just click go no real knowledge required|`|WPT3C7MAaa	It's a waste of time generally.

It will take care of the rest.|`|tllMnGooaa	Im' not a torrent enthusiast but what i know is you need a program designed for torrent downloads there are different ones, anyway torrents download parts of files or movies piece by piece from many people thats why its quick i guess... anyway these pieces have to get re-assembled so you have a complete file or movie, the torrent programs do all this.|`|WPT3C7MAaa	am not sure what your asking here..? <br>  <br>  Windows cannot open torrent files, you need bittorrent or similar client to download it. <br>  <br>  When you are downloading something, like a movie. The first thing you will download is the '.torrent' file. This is not your movie itself, but only the metafile, i.e information about your movie, where it is, how to download it, etc. You need the bittorent client to open that file and start downloading. Let's just say that it's the '.torrent' file that is downloading your movie. <br>  <br>  Once your download is over, you can play your movie normally, you don't need the '.torrent' file anymore. <br>  <br>  again am not sure what you asked exactly, hope it helps. Don't use torrents too much though, illegal..|`|sA7DuUUBaa	because torrent format is a stand alone file format not widely used  for anything other than a samll few programs this format is not digitally signed by microsoft there for its not a supported formats like zillion others. no problem there are utilitys that read them like universal format readers but is not needed unless your a programer. beside torrent programs and files formats was invented for the intent of illigal media translation download thats why windows dont support it by itself.|`|jWGzSmypaa	Torrents are NOT illegal..<br>  <br>  The only thing that is illegal is downloading copyrighted material..<br>  <br>  There are a multitude of different LEGAL things which can be downloaded using .torrent files..|`|tl8e4KyGaa	You will need Utorrent to download.It is illegal<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.utorrent.com/download_complete.php?os=win" rel="nofollow">http://www.utorrent.com/download_complet...</a>

8ttynrbfaa	The only free way to do that in Windows XP is via the Diskpart.exe utility. First you delete the partition you no longer want, then you extend the primary partition into the free space.<br>  <br>  Before you delete a partition, be aware that this removes everything on that partition. Any files on it will be gone forever.<br>  <br>  To delete a partition:<br>  # Open the Control Panel.<br>  # Open Administrative Tools.<br>  # Open Computer Management.<br>  # In the left pane, under Storage, open Disk Management.<br>  # The right pane should show a list of your drives, by letter, above a diagram of what partitions they have if any.<br>  # Right-click within any of the fields below the colored bars, and select Delete Partition. <br>  <br>  Once deleted, you can extend the primary partition onto the available free space the other partition was using.<br>  <br>  Microsoft provides documentation on how to do this here:<br>  <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/325590" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/325590</a>|`|FK0tfWlXaa	download a copy of partition magic 8.05 should be the latest.

They will never ever let you down, they don't get viruses, like windows does.

Most applications that work on windows now work on mac anyway. <br>  <br>  imacs are now the cheapest they have ever been, when I bought my first imac 3 years ago it was 1300 with a 17" 160GB hard drive and 1GB Memory.<br>  <br>  Now you can get a 20" imac 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 1GB memory<br>  250GB hard drive for 782.00  !!!!!!!!!!! <br>  <br>  go and get the imac you WONT be disappointed, I promise you.|`|AA11564046	WHHHAT!!! what kind of question is that. computer's are not real. they're jsut a myth made up by the government to keep the underlings in line man. or just buy a pc if u want to play games or do work. get a mac if you want to do stuff with music or videos, or basicly anything dealing with media.|`|O32DQvdQaa	MAC. they RARELY get viruses, they can do everything that a PC can do and more, and they don't lose their value like PC's.|`|FK0tfWlXaa	Personally I would get a imac.

Wiether to get a mac or pc. So i picked a really nice dell workstation and my uncle got an imac. So we would play with each other's computer's and after messing with his imac i fell in love with it. So i sold my dell and bought an white imac and just sold thats and got the new black and silver one. I love it. I do all that stuff like spread sheets, charts, and power point , picture editing , listening to music and surfing the web. I couldnt have made a better choice. apples are highly priced but in the long run so much eaiser and funnier to use.

TtZ9zQpraa	sending data through the air means a slower download rate because the air as a medium has lots of noise (stuff that slows it down-- objects, walls, etc). wired connections, unless multiple users are using the same wire, tend to have much less congestion and thus faster speeds. you can always reset the connection (turn your router and modem off, then turn your modem on, then your router on, then connect and voila you should have a fresh connection).

DjGEJfaPaa	Your trial ran out. Get Open Office unless you want to purchase Microsoft Office.<br>  <br>  OpenOffice.org is the leading open-source office software suite for word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, graphics, databases and more. It is available in many languages and works on all common computers. It stores all your data in an international open standard format and can also read and write files from other common office software packages. It can be downloaded and used completely free of charge for any purpose.|`|FBQZ06vraa	That sounds like a trial version of Microsoft Office that was good for 25 uses or 60 days.  At the end of that time it stops letting you edit your files or create new ones.  You have to purchase Microsoft Office 2007, or at least Word 2007, to do that.<br>  <br>  Like being hooked like a fish, isn't it?<br>  <br>  Note:  The 25-character product key on the computer case or laptop bottom is NOT the key for MS Office.  It’s only for the Windows operating system.<br>  <br>  Here are some of your options:<br>  <br>  First, if you're a student, you may qualify for the Student edition of Office at a pretty good price:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/student/discounts/theultimatesteal-us/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/student/discoun...</a><br>  <br>  Second, if you’re interested in buying Word, check out this URL, especially the second group of listings. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/FX101754511033.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/produc...</a><br>  <br>  Note that the higher of the two prices quoted is for a full version of that program and the lower, for upgrades from existing software.  Read the list of upgrade-qualifying software carefully:  MS Works is often one, and may have come on your machine.<br>  <br>  Finally, if you have files that are locked up in the new Word 2007 file format (.docx), here’s a possibility for salvaging them.  Microsoft offers a free Compatibility pack that allows earlier versions of Word to read Word 2007 files.  If you have access to an earlier version, this can at least give you back your documents.  Some new features of Word 2007 will be lost or converted to straight text in the conversion to the earlier version.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|c4e93d9cd2cf9fe63e9fb58eb672dfeaaa	you have a trial version
Qm2apU5Qaa	Their both packet based protocols.IP is unreliable whereas TCP isn't. The IP protocol doesn't contain information about how to manage packets, only information about the sender and destination network addresses. IP packets often get lost and must be resent. Hence the term 'unreliable'. TCP stores network host address, firewall information, check sum protection, and more. Without the TCP protocol, packets would be broadcast to every network host, which is detrimental to network performance.|`|a5ba9ea46c4e20291c9dc9d53a67da7faa	It stacks up, vastly superior entries in Wikipedia would obviously do the trick, in a nutshell Internet Protocol stack follows the same OSI philosophy but with 4 layers instead of 7.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	That's like asking someone to explain French's features and functions to you.

It should start in a limited capacity. From there, see if you can unistall the offending program. The other thing that you can do from Safe Mode is System Restore. It takes you computer back to a date in time (such as last week). You will lose all info that you have put on the computer in the last week, but you will lose the problem also. Your computer creates Restore Dates whenever it installs updates from Microsoft so there will be a recent Restore Date - maybe one that is one or two days old. <br>  <br>  Maybe you can just press Direct Services Restore Mode. I dunno know for sure if that is System Restore.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, somebody gives you a better answer.

IAwBEsPkaa	Hello. While it is a good thing to do a complete system scan of critical areas of the hard drive, you may want to think about setting Norton to scan only incoming files such as email and attachments. You can instruct Norton not to scan the entire hard drive every time the system restarts. It should scan critical system areas with each reboot. But it sounds like Norton is doing a complete hard disk drive scan. Just ask it to not do that anymore, and if you need help operating the console please contact Symantec Custmer Service (or visit Symantec's website to seek support). There you should find the support you need.

Kid does something stupid, parent prevents it from happening again. Kid throws fit "why dont you trust me??!!!" well DUH!  kid pushes and pushes begging for one more chance.  Parent gives in.  Kid waits a while, but then does more stupid stuff.  Parent prevents more stupid stuff.  Kid yells, cries, screams and swears they have the worst parents in the world.  Parent admits that Yes.. they are the worst parent in the world.  But they dont give in and their kid is protected for the time being.

For starters, you're in their house under their rules using their computer.  They want to 1) protect you from, say, internet predators and cyber bulling.  They also want to 2) keep you away from things like pornography and other obscene materials.  Finally they 3) want to make sure you aren't doing anything illegal on the computer.<br>  <br>  If you want privacy, move out.

If you are a seller on eBay, you don't send out the goods until you get confirmation of payment.  If you are a buyer, pay with Paypal for added protection.  eBay is safe for sensible people (one girl - a seller - asked a question on here earlier this week because she "forgot" to send an invoice to the buyer before sending the item.  Now she has to ask the person who has already received the item to please pay for it.)|`|TirUIOc3aa	well amazon already seems better now doesnt it?.......|`|cjLwIpSsaa	ebay is way better i can find something for $50 for $10 by the way go on this site www.territorywaronline.com

You need to look at your download speeds on the internet, it could be that you are in an area of low speed and the down load speed is not sufficient to give continuous play.

HDD = Hard Disk Drive (device)  GB = Gigabyte(space)  MB = Megabyte(space)   Ghz - GigaHertz (speed)    Here are somethings you can look at or try.     1. Is the hard drive full or have limited space     Go into file explorer. Right mouse click on the drive folder and select properties.     2. Since this system is older the drive may need to be defragged. This is the XP path not sure on Vista I do not use it.    go to Start // program files //  accessories // system tools // disk defragmenter      run the analyze and see what the outcome is    3. Try some diag tools like this one (I have not used it so can not talk to how it works)  http://www.freshpcfix.com/regcure.php?t=...    4. It would not hurt to upgrade the RAM.  http://www.memorystock.com/ check this place out. you will need the model of the system     5. Have the system rebuilt and install XP instead of vista.  If you can do it great. If not take it to some one to do it..  Sometimes starting over will clean off all the stuff that is slowing down the system.  But be warned that sometimes this also exposes the root of the issue which could be hardware failure.      I hope this helps..  You can contact me if you need more info.

2RQ4qDhXaa	On all current Macs you can run Windows XP or Vista either in a virutal machine (using VMWare Fusion or Parallels) or native on the hardware (using Boot Camp which is included with OS X). You have to buy a copy of Windows, but I've got XP Pro on my iMac and have never had a problem.<br>  <br>  That's one of the things that made switching to Mac so easy: you can run Windows on a Mac very easily, but it's very very hard to run OS X on a PC.

Another thing people bring up is security. Well, unless you're stupid, and by stupid I mean downloading and running every single shady executable you find, then security's great on either.

Personally I don't think the All-in-Ones are a good choice, and consider them overpriced, lack expandability and repairs both more expensive and require the entire computer.<br>  <br>  PS: Apple knows that they need to make Macintosh look different than PC so all Macs except the Mac Pro will not have a tower option.

pUzJiMUcaa	First off, Some1, if you don't know the answer, don't speak.<br>  <br>  Source and Revision Control is a term for software that a development team has in place to control access and modification of a project. Here's the typical scenario:<br>  <br>  A software development team has, say, 5 developers on it that are all working on the same project. Source Control handles who has what. It wouldn't be very productive if two developers were working on the same code at the same time, with no source control...as soon as the last one saved, the first ones changes would be gone. Source control manages who can access what at a given time, and how changes are applied to a project.<br>  <br>  Revision control allows the team to undo their mistakes, so to speak. When code is checked in, a revision keeps track of the changes and allows the team to revert to an old version if all heck breaks loose.<br>  <br>  When you work in a controlled environment, you hear terms like "delta" (latest revision) and "repository" (central bank of source code), among others. There is a lingo that goes with it.<br>  <br>  Any team with more than 2 people generally works in a controlled environment. There are several popular source control programs, SVN and CVS being two popular ones.|`|pXzvu866aa	It's software configuration management.

The data is magnetically stored on the hard drive, so you won't lose any data.  When it's powered back up and reconnected to your PC (or another PC, for that matter), you'll be able to access your files again.  Also, if you remove it, keep it away from strong magnets and metals, or you could in fact begin to lose data.<br>  <br>  However, here is a TRICK THAT ***MAY*** WORK.  If you have critical data on it and can't get it to a PC professional, take the hard drive out, store it in your coldest freezer for four hours (wrapped in a plastic sandwich bag to lessen moisture).  Then reconnect the drive, and you'll usually get 5 good minutes before it starts grinding again, hopefully time enough to copy the one or two must-have files.  Only do this if this is critical, as mentioned earlier, if it starts grinding, this may cause you to lose data.<br>  <br>  As a PC professional, I've had this happen 3 or 4 times in the past, and yes, the trick does work.  It's kind of like the old days as kids when we'd put our old batteries overnight in the freezer to recharge them to get 10 extra minutes of battery life, the hard drive can temporarily come back to life.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|K7OVkU3Naa	What you need to do is transfer all the data to an external drive if you still can. I recommend just getting the My Documents (assuming your on Windows) folder since the rest should just be software and the OS. <br>  <br>  Removing it will not erase the data, since it is still in the drive. You need the drive for the computer to run, of course.<br>  <br>  One point: if the drive is failing badly, removing it could finish the thing off if it's a part like the reader arm so copy what you need first. Please!|`|wOcJ60Jxaa	Yes you will, what i recommend it that you copy it to a new hard drive and use that one. then you cant set that one up as back up or a place for extra space but if you think it is going to die don't put anything important on it. The problem with loosing a hard drive is that it contains not only your data but your operating system too. so you need to make sure this is on the other disc with your data. Good luck<br>  <br>  I recommend getting a hard drive from newegg, Seagate Barracuda. this is a class of hard drive that is very fast and i have had not problems with.|`|scOcY1tMaa	Removing the hard drive removes the OS, (Operating System).<br>  <br>  Without it, you can not boot up except with a boot disc. (Not recommended).<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would back up anything you wish to keep that you do not have the original installation discs for.<br>  <br>  Get another HDD, re-install what you can and save yourself a lot of headaches.<br>  <br>  Don't forget, you will need an OS, Windows version (whatever), without an OS, you're a dead duck.<br>  ;-)|`|82af604fee9894b55496e3d6a8dca569aa	Copy all your wanted files onto cd/dvd, at least you then still have them. An operating system for a new hard drive is then the next priority.|`|YJN186hfaa	I would listen to Billy Rowe here^<br>  <br>  You will not loose you data at all if you do not FORMAT the hard drive.|`|ABMvstsaaa	Yesss my brother done it and it effed up our computerr realliiiiiiiiiiiiii bad|`|CsIvy5MAaa	If your hard drive is grinding, it's about to crash, and you will lose everything.<br>  <br>  If you put it in a zip lock bag, in the freezer, this will buy you sometime to get a new hard drive.<br>  <br>  Take your old one, that's failing, plug it in (still cold!) and you should have around 10 minutes time to pull stuff off it to put on the new before it starts to grind again.<br>  <br>  It may be a lost cause already, but that scenario helps.|`|Iqco1PcQaa	why take it out? all the information including boot up MS, programmes will still be on the HD, your computer won't work without the HD|`|HXW4i5Ajaa	Normally if you take a hard drive out, all the data stays with the hard drive, and can be read if you put it in another PC. If the drive is making bad noises, you may have problems. Not because of taking it out, but because the hard drive itself may be failing. You need to copy the data you need NOW. If you turn the computer off, there is a risk that the drive may not start back up. If you leave it on for any length of time, it may finish the drive off.|`|0Y2HH0FEaa	You will not lose your data, nor will you put it at risk inles you juggle the hard drive, drop it, put it in a freezer or bang it with a hammer.<br>  Although if your hard drive is on the way out, you should try and transfer your data to another medium - an external hard disc or DVD. If the hard drive is really on the way out, it'll fail sooner or later anyway. Get the important data off it now while it's still working.|`|w1J2kECdaa	No you will not lose your data. <br>  <br>  Put the hard drive aside, away from the following:<br>  <br>  Heat<br>  Vibration<br>  Magnetic<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You might have head crash. It's when the spindle inside of the hard drive grindes on the disk.|`|vZMN82U8aa	remove the drive, switch the jumper to slave, and bolt it into a usb caddy... <br>  <br>  and no you wont lose any data... <br>  <br>  im more interested in why the drive is grinding... ive been doing this since DOS days... and ive never heard a disk do this... i still utilise my old harddrives for shifting data, and some of em are over 10yrs old...
f9c10f470f3f0acd2faaacacb18411c3aa	Mimic is wrong on many points.<br>  First of all what make is the laptop? Many manufacturers now put 2 drive bays into laptops. A primary and a secondary. If the hard drive has been fitted into the secondary bay you will not be able to put WinXP on until the drive is put into the primary bay.<br>  Once in there boot off the WinXP disc when it gets to the stage it shows the drive and it's partitions delete all partitions, format and install WinXP. Remember that if you delete all partitions you may have problems in re-installing Vista at a later date.<br>  Also you may not be able to get drivers for some of the hardware. E.g. for some of the Packard Bell laptops with Vista installed you cannot get drivers for the sound card.<br>  Paul C is absolutely wrong about Microsoft having to supply a free downgrade. There is no law on that. Also changing the operating system WILL NOT & CANNOT invalidate warranties by law.|`|2LbTrlQnaa	How do you mean you've tried with different CD's.  An XP installation disk is one disk that is purchased complete with Product Key|`|Z8oZGwE3aa	Could be a problem with device drivers, hardware or software.

Now go|`|AA10954273	Before attempting this, contact tech support for your computer.  Many computers, especially laptops, are too new to run XP.  Find out if it's even possible to run XP on your hardware before you mess it up to the point where you'll have to pay hundreds of dollars to have it restored.|`|chHPoiThaa	1. Reformat the Hard Drive and Re-install the Operating System<br>  Reformatting a disk prepares it to accept a new operating system. It also wipes out everything on the hard drive. That's your goal.<br>  Past versions of Windows (through Windows ME) allow you to create a start-up disk. You'll need one to reformat your hard drive. Click Start > Settings > Control Panel. Double-click Add/Remove Programs. Click Start-up Disk. Click Create Disk.<br>  On Windows XP, you'll need to download the disk information. Go to BootDisk.com and click "DOS — Windows 9X/NT4/2000/XP Excellent Bootdisks." Download the Windows XP Custom Install Disk and save it to a floppy.<br>  On all systems, shut down all open programs. Restart the computer with the floppy in the A: drive. At the A: prompt, type Format: C. Answer "yes" to the warning; you want to wipe out all the data. When the reformat finishes, put the Windows installation CD in the CD drive and remove the floppy. Restart and re-install Windows.<br>  Reformatting will keep most people out of your old files. But specialised shareware exists to reclaim files after reformatting. If you do not know who will get the computer — or you do know and you don't trust them — stronger measures are required.<br>  2. Buy Software and Overwrite the Disk, Again and Again and Again<br>  If you don't know much about computers, this might be easier than Step 2. There are several programs that write gibberish to the hard drive. They promise that nobody will be able to find your files after the software is utilised.<br>  Norton's SystemWorks includes an application called Wipe Info. OnTrack's DataEraser offers a similar feature, as does Jetico's BCWipe. There are more such applications on the Internet.<br>  You can leave the operating system and other files on the hard disk, if you want. These programs can be set to overwrite only the unoccupied areas. The process can be slow, because they write to the disk repeatedly. You might want to run it overnight.<br>  3. You're Totally Paranoid, so Get Out the Acetylene Torch<br>  I'm not kidding. The only absolute and assured way of protecting your data is to destroy the hard drive. To do that, you need to remove it from the computer. If you want to save the rest of the computer, touch the machine's metal frame before reaching in. Static electricity can wreck the circuitry.<br>  Unplug the wires on the hard drive and remove the mounting screws. The hard drive slides out from the back of its holder.<br>  The Pentagon shreds its hard drives. That should work, assuming you can find a hard-drive shredder. I've never seen one.<br>  You need to destroy the platters inside. Try smashing them with a hammer. Destroying them with a torch should work.<br>  Step 4 seems excessive to me. But you're right to be paranoid about this. Identity theft has become overwhelming. Personally, I would use Step 3. I believe in being careful, no matter who gets the computer.|`|8c30b66b52a9ed5098cb11141a4b01efaa	Find the drivers you are going to need for xp.

RAM is very cheep right now - Crucial.Com has RAM upgrades for very good prices. <br>  <br>  Personally, I'd prob go with the second one and then get as much RAM as I could afford - at least a total of 6 or 8GB to start with, or all the way up to 16GB as soon as I could.

RsgvTDV1aa	1}  This virus can delete and damage your data.     2} firstly you should know that there is also standard windows file named Recycled which also uses nearly same name and icon. So please don't confuse with it. Download Avast and run a Scan That will help.If you already have it than firstly go in your Tools menu and click the folder option  uncheck the following options              --> Show hidden files and folders            --> Hide protected system File      Than Run full scan for your each drive separately using avast.    3} This can be also done with your removable devise    Extra advise: You may also have some viruses related to recycler. In some cases your avast will not be able to remove this virus permanently In that case right click on this kind of virus files and convert them into archive from read only using properties option. Open them using notepad And erase anything written in that and save it.

IGJGUfjNaa	If your virus/spyware free, there are  a couple things you can do get your computer working faster. If you using your computer for normal stuff and not gaming. You don't always need more RAM you just need to perform a few maintenance task.<br>  <br>  First, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Do a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.<br>  <a href="http://www.delete-computer-history.com/what-is-the-best-registry-cleaner.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.delete-computer-history.com/w...</a><br>  <br>  2. Clear your Windows cache files, this is your temporary file. It can grow up to a large volume and stop your computer from using RAM properly. In a sense slow it down by preventing it from using free space.Here is how:<br>  <br>  1. Quit Internet Explorer, Firefox, or any other web browser<br>  2. Click Start, click "Control Panel", and then double-click "Internet Options".<br>  3. On the General tab, click "Delete Files" under Temporary Internet Files.<br>  4. In the Delete Files dialog box, click to select the "Delete all offline content" check box , and then click OK.<br>  5. Click OK.<br>  <br>  3. Manage your startups. Your excess CPU usage is due to too many programs running in the background. You can cut these to barebones by alter your msconfig. Here is how:<br>  <br>  1. Open your Start menu.<br>  2. Click Run<br>  3. In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>  4. In the "system configuration utility",click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>  5.

However if you do it professionally then you'll need to get into final cut pro. That will offer more tools and functions for you to use.

When you are in a website that has https in their address that means that everything you send to the website and anything the website sends to you is encrypted. In comparison, a website with http in their url is sending everything in the clear (not encrypted).<br>  <br>  Don't confuse this with the site being legitimate though.  Just because the website is encrypting data back and forth doesn't mean they are who they say the are.  To verify this you can go to the better business bureau and look for the company or the website will have a seal that they have been verified by a legitimate company.  Read more about this in google.  The seals can also be fake so do your homework if you're not sure.|`|m8C8MU2Maa	Yes they are secure sites.

zorYTX59aa	It's not that easy becoming a YouTube "partner". Almost all of them are either<br>  a film or video creator/producer/director, an artiste (musician/singer/comedian),<br>  a media company, an advertiser, a broadcaster, a person of great significance <br>  (like President Barack Obama) or somebody with a special project or mission <br>  (like Shawn Ahmed and his Uncultured Project for the children of Bangladesh).<br>  <a href="http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject</a><br>  <br>  But that is not enough to become a "partner". YouTube has even more criteria:<br>  -- You create your own "original" videos<br>  -- You own all the copyrights concerned<br>  -- The content is 100% yours, no income splitting if there's advertising revenue<br>  -- You upload videos on a regular basis<br>  -- Your videos are viewed by thousands<br>  -- The videos are suitable for all viewers<br>  -- You are a resident in one of the 19 countries where YouTube has local sites<br>  -- You can prove you are 18+ years old.<br>  <br>  Generally, YouTube will not consider you unless you've got some combination <br>  of "subscribers" and "videos" that when multiplied together can easily surpass<br>  10,000 channel views. Thus, you would need, for example, something like 800 <br>  subscribers and 20 videos or maybe 500 subs and 30 vids -- as well as a total <br>  view count close to the 1,000,000 mark.<br>  <br>  Once you've finally been "accredited" by the YouTube directors/administrators,<br>  they will give you all the special tools and codes which will enable you to have:<br>  -- a special "banner" for your profile page <br>  -- a mini-banner beside every played video<br>  -- your channel-page video on "autoplay"<br>  -- automatic "high-def" to all your videos<br>  -- extra "profile" and new "bulletin" boxes<br>  -- "special" videos over 10 minutes long<br>  -- custom skins/sizes for the video player<br>  -- the light-bulb "watch at night" feature (if you are considered a "broadcaster")<br>  -- the possibility of sharing in ad revenue<br>  -- being at the very top of search results<br>  -- a "More From" section which overrides the regular "Related Videos" section<br>  and featuring only your uploaded videos.<br>  <br>  If you wish to know more, go to the top righthand corner of any YouTube page, <br>  click "Help" and then type in the searchbox the word "partner". Or click below:<br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/search.py?query=partner&ctx=en%3Asearchbox&client=&hl=&cx=&cof=&adkw=&search_type=hc_help" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bi...</a><br>  <br>  I hope you find all my information helpful.|`|SfuVoSKfaa	You get advertisement on your videos and every time someone clicks on it, you get paid.<br>  <br>  Get a lot of subscribers, your videos are viewed a lot, and have no contents that are against YouTube policy.

ELSKfMpxaa	Check out the Asus computers. I too am looking to buy a new laptop but I'm looking for gaming. Asus's G50 series is built to go head to head with alienware. All of their computers are great value for the money. Check out newegg.com. I've always been partial to HP's and Compaq's (which are the same manufacturer) above the others. Toshiba's look good on paper but I've had massive issues with them. Asus though is ranked #2 in customer satisfaction (right behind mac)<br>  <br>  Edit: By the way Asus has 1 year accident warranty (meaning you drop it out the car window going down the freeway they'll still fix it) lol.. and 2 year parts and labor warranty. And depending on where you live they may even have service locations near you so you don't have to ship it off to a national center. <br>  <br>  Also If you don't know who Asus is. They're not a generic brand like acer, they've been making the "guts" for computers for years they just decided to make the whole thing not too long ago.|`|XYepol2gaa	Hp & Compaq|`|NCFW9WKWaa	go to this website<br>  <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/Category/category_tlc.asp?CatId=17&name=Laptops-Notebooks" rel="nofollow">http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/...</a>|`|qxuhZkFXaa	Any of the major brands would be a good choice.  They are all reputable companies that will offer a minimum 1 year warranty, with the option of buying a couple of more years of warranty.<br>  <br>  As far as which brand will crash less...I've had good experience with HP, DELL and Sony (most expensive), but really it depends on how you use your laptop.  If you download a lot of stuff from random places on the internet, chances are your computer will contract a virus and die from time to time.  So protect yourself(anti-virus, anti-spyware,anti-adware, and firewall) and you'll be fine.  The nice thing about HP, DELL, Compaq, etc.  is that they now come with a recovery partition or recover CDs which make it a breeze for you to format your drive back to factory settings.|`|zedTYkeqaa	I recently got an Asus from Best Buy it was on sale and is not a bad system. Came with Vista on it, didn't run bad for Vista but I finally got XP to work on it. I couldn't be happier, It has an Centrino 2 in it, 2.26 Dual Core cpu, 4 GB (XP dosn't read the final 1 gb but still uses it, complex to explain) 320GB HDD, and a Nvidia Geforce 9600m GS with 1 GB Dedicated graphics, not bad considering the price: $794. I'm not complaing, it has played all the games I play at maximum settings, (results will vary), I play Command and Conquer (all of them) Fable, Halo. Not a bad system. Best I've owned, I've had Dell and HP as well, Will not buy HP anymore. They tried to force me to repair more then i wanted. Dell isn't bad. I'll buy Asus, Dell then HP in that order. Asus being first.

AA10096832	I agree that it really depends on what you want to do and I'll add that it probably depends on what geographical area you are in. A lot of large companies around here hire .NET developers pretty regularly. But Java clearly has a huge online presence.<br>  <br>  Also, I would echo the .NET isn't a programming language, it's a framework that you utilize to build apps/sites. So you would need to use C# (or C, C++, or I think you can even use VB) to use the .NET framework.<br>  <br>  That said, I'm not a hotshot progammer but I have worked in both .NET using C# and Java. If you develop your C# or your Java, you can very easily transfer your skills to the other language. So it might not be a bad idea to go with C#/.NET classes knowing that you will be able to delve into Java at a later date.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Have you already had at least 6 months of programming (with no computer language)?  If so, which language is best depends on what you want to do.  Each language has its strengths and weaknesses.|`|dfjIBHe3aa	Everyone deserves respect for their answers but I just want to say if you think you will spend most of your career mainly on Windows then go with dot Net, however, Windows is mainly written for Intel and AMD chips.  ARM processors are becoming more available on Netbooks and that has everything to do with the use of Linux there, because ARM has been supported by Linux since they first appeared.  Java is cross-platform in every sense.  You can write the same code and run it on Windows, Linux and Macs, you can run  it on PCs, Playstation 3s (if it's not too memory-intensive) and on Cray Supercomputers.  Still, they are serious about writing Windows for netbooks and frankly doing a better job than on the OLPC.  Dot Net may well support your career.  Or you may work on something else.  It's your call.|`|I51RUYZraa	Each has its own distinct advantages and disadvantages.  Java is widely used across a very diverse range of different hardware applications including the ever more popular mobile market but it is limited by capabilities it is also an entire language which means it is limited to what its instuction set can perform.  .NET framework is more of a library then an entire language and it can be called using several of Microsoft's developement solutions including C# and C++, with C you have extensible control over the hardware you are programming for but the .NET framework is fairly limited to the PC market.  One of the larger markets today is social networking which makes heavy use of JAVA components so you could stand to earn more by being very proficient in JAVA BUT the .NET framework is the basis for a great deal of software applications ranging from high end games to business applications.  Understanding .NET also means you will need to have a working knowledge of a language that can utilize it which might mean more schooling.|`|Qm2apU5Qaa	Again, you ought to find some information comparing the two. Initially,  Java is harder to learn, but afterward .NET will be harder to maintain and it will take longer to develop the same project. Why? Java's API makes use of OO design more intensely than any .NET language. It supports memory, threading, synchronization. <br>  Did you notice I like Java? Psyche. Java's API has proven to be portable across all platforms, whereas C#, the ultimate .NET language, still has problems on some platforms. All other .NET languages have extensive API support as well. The only thing that C# has on Java is its reflection feature. As far as cost, IIS (internet information services) has add-ons.  <br>  Schools are preferring Java over .NET, because Java is here to stay. Did you know it was created in the city of Java in Indonesia.|`|2cHf796yaa	it ultimately depends on what you have a better attention span for. i think java is a little more flexible though, seeing that it's platform independent.

Since Macs come with everything you need, the only upgrade I do when I bring a new Mac home is order memory for it.  Same memory as for PC's, so it's the same prince.  Installing the memory requires opening a little door on my iMac or removing the cover to the case on a PC.  Which is more difficult?<br>  <br>  4. Can't say Macs almost never break down?

I run XP Pro on my iMac via Boot Camp and I have never had a problem with it. My one fear when switching from PC to Mac was that I'd have to re-buy all my software: instead I got a OEM copy of XP Pro on sale for $80 and now I basically have a sweet Mac and am awesome PC all in one computer. I had probably a couple thousand bucks of PC software, so I REALLY didn't want to have to buy the Mac versions!<br>  <br>  Sure, it's more expensive up front to get a Mac, but I switched in late 2007 and I don't think I'll ever go back to PC. Why would I when I have a quad-boot system right now? It's like 4 computers in one! I run OS X Leopard, XP Pro, and Linux Ubuntu native on separate partitions, and I run Windows 7 Beta in virtual from within OS X.<br>  <br>  The new MacBook Pros are spendy, but man! are they sexy!

The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.<br>  <br>  There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.<br>  <br>  Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network.

chHPoiThaa	If you are able to format it then your operating system recognises it.<br>  If you using a mac you will have to format to zfs.<br>  If you are using windows you will have to format to NTFS.

d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	Yes doing a system recovery to the original factory image will eliminate any viruses or spyware- you'll also lose any data, photos, music etc you've saved unless you back them up to DVDs or external drives first.  You'll also need to reinstall any software packages from their original CDs.<br>  <br>  You can probably clean the spyware infection by less drastic measures.  Try these free cleaners first:|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	It mioght - it depends on the virus.  Doing a recovery won't remove boot-sector viruses or viruses in programs you installed, only viruses in Windows programs (programs that are part of Windows itself).  Your best bet is to do a complete reinstall of Windows, from a power-down condition.  (Put the disk in, turn the power off, wait a couple of minutes, then power up and install with a FULL format.)  That way, any virus that's in RAM will disappear (anything in RAM is lost when you turn the power off) and your hard drive will never boot, so viruses on it won't get loaded.|`|jprAxFILaa	Yes, recovery disc recover your system to it original one. But, everything will be gone. Including the spyware and any other additional software and program that you have save or install into the hard drive. So, good luck on it.

It’s a much more stable and updated version from the older and beta editions.   According to the IE8 development team, this version of the browser will be very similar to final release of Internet Explorer 8.    Here’s a link to the download, if you’re interested in upgrading:  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/download-ie.aspx?ocid=ie8_sm_a" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/interne...</a><br>  This edition also comes with quite a few more features than some of the older browsers, and comes with a “compatibility mode” option (that button in the address bar that looks like a broken file) that could potentially help with the problem you’re facing.

When you say suitable what do you mean? <br>  <br>  If you mean will it run "well", the answer is it depends...  It depends on the hardware in the PC, how fast the processor is, how much RAM you have and how much Video RAM you have.  You can google:  "Windows Vista minimum specs" to see the hardware you need.  If your machine won't be powerful enough you can always ask the store to install Windows XP Pro on it instead of Vista.|`|0BOxZ5Ecaa	i been looking on tigerdirect and every refurbished p/c i see there that comes with vista home business also come with a win x.p. downgrade.

That's where people often go wrong. Really, no form of nabbing free music is totally legal, unless it's offered as a free album (such as the album 'Oh My' by Sean Fournier). But if you want my suggestion for the easiest low-virus-risk (I'm not even sure there is a risk with this) music obtainment program, I'd suggest downloading Mozilla FireFox (if you're one of those silly, silly people who doesn't yet have it and wonders why viruses come much much less to other people for some strange reason) and getting an account in the Add-ons area (this can be reached via Tools > Add-ons > Get Add-ons > Browse All Add-ons). With an account, you can download experimental applications not available to the general public. Search for 'Converter' in the Video/Music category and one of your results will be FetchMP3. Download that, find a video of the song you want on YouTube, copy the URL, and head over to fetchmp3.com. Enter the URL into the search box, and then drag the result into the corner-box by grabbing the green triangle. The app rips the audio track of the video in mp3 format. The only offset I've noticed is that many of the songs I've downloaded have not been in stereo sound, though I really don't expect much from foreign-language Disney songs. :P<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|Wo4Gxtduaa	a safe and virus free website that i know is megadownload.net<br>  <br>  <br>  its a website where people upload there music so there friends could download it. i use this website because i hate using lime wire. limewire ahs too many viruses. and megadownload has plenty full of music and ablums adn videos for you to download|`|ik7afC7Haa	As many people have said LIMEWIRE is brilliant and free, it is used by millions of people and I think is one of the best free music things in the country why not try it out it will not let u down.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped and click on the link below to check it out.|`|xYYosbq1aa	i always used limewire, but then it stopped working,<br>  so i got FrostWire, it's basically the same,<br>  but it's like limewire PRO, but free.<br>  <br>  you should definantly get it.|`|ijYwt9WMaa	oh yeah i just tried to go on it and it wasnt working :S<br>  <br>  umm beemp3.net is ok<br>  Mp3raid.com is good<br>  <br>  have fun<br>  <br>  x|`|9dmylL0saa	you should use limewire it is free and 100% legal|`|P5PkfDiBaa	download limewire, best invention in the world ( i dnt use it)

qXvFsnOcaa	They are regular servers where proxy ports have been left open and/or the correct type of server software has been installed.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the ports are left open by accident. Somebody installs a full server package and never locks its security down. Sometimes people set them up deliberately to allow people in schools or colleges to view restricted websites (Porno).<br>  <br>  I use proxies that people have deliberately set up so that I can browse the Internet while hiding my identity, as some governments around the world (Beijing, in my case) censor the Internet to stop you from seeing politically sensitive websites about things like human rights. Using proxies helps to stop people finding out who I am and protects me from persecution.|`|zNZW8RMraa	You Can Unblobk Websites with a Proxy , here are a Few :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.247Web.co.cc" rel="nofollow">http://www.247Web.co.cc</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hidden-surf.co.cc" rel="nofollow">http://www.hidden-surf.co.cc</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://xunblocker.co.cc" rel="nofollow">http://xunblocker.co.cc</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://2surfall.co.cc" rel="nofollow">http://2surfall.co.cc</a><br>  <br>  Be Sure to tell your friends or post them to your myspace page or blog so others can enjoy.<br>  <br>  Happy Surfing!|`|z3ybCNcfaa	God|`|ZkELw9wzaa	Many come from hackers just waiting for you to bite on their hook.

It's spendy, but with the dual video cards you can smash through video editing and 3D rendering no problem. For the times when you need to use a Windows-only program, you can install Vista or XP using Boot Camp. <br>  <br>  Much like on a PC though, don't upgrade the RAM when you buy it: aftermarket RAM is WAY cheaper and the same quality as Apple brand (I get mine at OWC - www.macsales.com).<br>  <br>  As far as space, you can get really cheep external hard drives at NewEgg.Com. They have a Western Digital MyBook 1TB on sale right now for $98 with free shipping. It's USB only, so it might not be the best for real-time video editing, but if you use it to store your projects once you are done working on them, that's a ton of space for not a lot of money! I got a 2-slot SATA external case that uses USB and FireWire 400/800 for something like $50, then I put two 1.5TB hard drives in it. I think the whole rig cost me about $200 and I got it all at NewEgg. <br>  <br>  So there you go. I know people are going to say you can get more computer for less cash if you get a PC, but I love my Mac and I'm very glad I made the switch.

sv64Uy3Saa	Socket 939 is an obsolete platform. There are no new motherboards for that platform. If you are lucky, you may be able to get a brand new but old stock motherboard from some retailers or on trading sites. It is not possible to upgrade to a Phenom or Phenom II on an obsolete platform.<br>  <br>  If your socket 939 mobo is still doing good, better just hang on to it. But once you decide to upgrade to current (and future proof) platform, there is very little that you can use from the old rig. Current motherboards need ddr2 or ddr3 RAM. Those that support high wattage Phenoms need the 8-pin 12V EPS power connector from PSU. It looks like only your 9800GT, HDD, CD/DVD drive and PC case would remain when you upgrade to current platform. Current motherboards have good built-in sound that supports 6 to 8 channels.<br>  <br>  Personally, if I could still get >10,000 marks on 3D Mark06 on such an old platform, I would hang on to it. If lower score (cuz processor could be bottlenecking the 9800GT), I would try overclocking the processor. If I could not hit 10,000 marks, I would retire the rig. The 9800GT is capable of scoring ~ 12000 marks on current average platform and higher on high-speed or overclocked set ups.

YNoTqr0uaa	cd-r is ROM (read only memory)  once it has been written on at all. So no. Honestly though, I don't even buy the cd-rw anymore  because a stack of 100 cd-r's is only 7 bucks. Now DVD's work differently (if you have a DVD burner) the first is  the dreaded DVD-R. They are also ROM after any writing, And it is the most horrible and unstable format ever. Then there's  DVD+R. A very stable and universaly compatable format for things  like dvd players, other computers,etc.They are rewriteable, but not eraseable. Meaning you can add more to the disk untill it's full. And Then there's the DVD+RW. They can be re writen and erased, but won't work with much else than other computers and few of the newer devices. Plus they are expensive, And are PAINFULY slow to burn. It takes 8 times longer for a DVD+RW to finish than a DVD+R. They are great for backing up your computer's data though.|`|hWlCGcMSaa	no|`|QU37MZi7aa	if your Sony CD is a CD-R then it is not a rewritable  a rewritable CD is "CD-RW".  there are plenty of CD-RW being sold all over the country and not just sony. there are such Maxell; TDK|`|GfphOIdOaa	no|`|iDTrTvg4aa	no!  cd-r means writable    &   cd-r/w means rewritable|`|qzPbcHpmaa	the CD-RW are re-writable.

VLC player plays multiple formats and all you need to do is to browse using explorer to your dvd and drag & drop the files to your hard drive. If the format of the DVD is DVD video then you need a DVD ripper.

73db74596e58eb80245935940aa5c956aa	I recently had my laptop stolen with all my itunes on it and was panicking about getting all my tunes back.  What I needed to do was download directly from my ipod to itunes.  You can download, via itunes, any previously purchased songs now, but if you're like me and have downloaded from CDs you no longer have, this is a problem.  But then, I found this link:    http://www.cnet.com/transfer-ipod-songs/    It's actually very simple, and once you've downloaded your tunes as a folder, you just import the whole thing into itunes and then recreate your playlist.  Just make sure that itunes is set up so that it asks you before your synchronise your ipod - that way it won't do it automatically and wipe your ipod.    Good luck!|`|AA10883009	First your question is whether you can copy iTunes from your old to new computer.iTune is a software which is freely available on the net(apple) and you need not copy it onto your new computer.Simply download the iTune setup files from the Apple site.When you execute this setup file the iTune will be installed in which ever computer you wish.In case you are asking to also transfer all songs in your iTune library.Then first of all select all songs in the Itune library copy them and paste them in a folder in your old computer then transfer these songs to your new computer and add them to the iTune library.As regards wipeing out all material in your ipod-Yes in case you tick the "automatic sync" option in your new iTune in your new computer all songs will be erased from the ipod.So better tick "manually sync" option.This will not remove anything from your ipod.
KFzPnr3Raa	Use bitdefender antivirus. It is the best. If you use to connect urself with internet, then it is must to use an antispyware and a firewall. Windows firewall is much enough to protect you from threats however you can use Zone Alarm firewall.|`|wJCb8i3iaa	firewall is more important than antivirus,try to install firewall like  1)zone alarm(best)  2)commander  3)pctools firewall  4)out post  now u wont worry about p2p  with firewall u can use avast antivirus.it have p2p shield.strong antivirus like kaspersky,bitdefender,eset slow ur p2p and it cannot be used along with other personel firewalls!!!!!!  i think ur problem is solved.choose my ans as best please.

zTUVmbIlaa	The quality of the picture recording depends on many more thing other than codec like - Source quality, resolution, bit-rate and other things.  But if all the other things are constant, divx will give a better quality output compared to mpeg-2.  But make sure the tuner that does divx2 is recording at same resolution & bit rate if not better as the others. Else the results can be bad compared to others also.|`|XmFT7fHnaa	personally i prefer the DivX2 format, sometimes when you use the mpeg-4 format the encoder does not keep the original aspect ratio....but I'm not an expert thats just my opinion.

I had a Compaq presario 2500 that was giving me a few problems but after doing my homework and finding out more about it i was able to upgrade the processor and memory in it and also update the BIOS. Yes, i had to strip down the laptop which i had never done in my life but i found a service manual that showed step by step on how to replace virtually every part on HP's/Compaq's website.    I was more used to building and stripping desktops, but after this am more confident about taking a laptop apart. If you are confident about taking your laptop apart then i'm sure you can get a replacement touchpad and install it yourself. Like you said it's out of warranty so there is nothing to void. Just remember where all the screws go!

N3AIS666aa	from the specs i would say that it could play modern games quite well however the high spec games like crysis, it wont be able to play. as the graphics card is great but no where near good enough. also the processor only being a centrino and not a core 2 duo could let it down in some games but otherwise i would consider it a moderate gaming laptop.    i would probably give it a 8 out of 10 because ofit being let down by the processor. also is it running a 64 bit version of windows because you will only be able tp use 3.5 GB's of the Ram if you havent
g2CYn27naa	ignore most of the other posts since you will have to look at a 4670 at most. Your PSU cannot handle anything more powerful then it. It costs around 70 and has fair performance, though you wont be able realistically run anything above1440x900 Resolution, since your not a serious pc gamer i doubt that this is too much of a problem. Since you are using an E8400, I assume that it is a PCI-e version mobo.  If you do want to go for a 9800 or 48X0 series card i would suggest you upgrade your PSU at the very least to 500 watt.|`|9e414a1211a7e5076be6b0772af4831baa	ATI HD 4830  http://www.novatech.co.uk/novatech/specp...    ATI HD 4850  http://www.novatech.co.uk/novatech/specp...    GeForce 9800 GT  http://www.novatech.co.uk/novatech/specp...    if someone tells he has an E8400 CPU, it should be clear that the mobo has PCI express slots!    added:  yes, a 350W PSU is a limitation of what you can get. all 3 mentioned graphics cards are in the range of 105 - 115W what is within the limit of a 350W PSU if you have only 1 hard drive and 1 CD/DVD drive.  you should have a try with one of these 3 cards. if it doesn't work (black screen or shutdown) a PSU upgrade to a 450/500PSU doesn't cost a fortune (on the novatech homepage there are some PSU's between 18 and 30).|`|BBnnSwK9aa	The motherboard's specs tell you EXACTLY what type of graphics card works with it.  AGP, PCIx, etc.    The LCD monitor's "native resolution" tells you what resolution the graphics card MUST support.  This setting can't be changed without the risk of damaging your monitor.    That's where you start.    Too complicated?      Take your full system specs, with make & model numbers, with you when you go shopping.  The store's staff can figure it all out for you.|`|4um6FKn8aa	If your buying online i suggest www.techbargains.com and dealnews.com. LOTS of great deals there. If your on dealnews scroll down to "upgrades"|`|AA10810132	it would be the 4850 no doubt, currently the best in its price range..  also try the gtx260 and specially the 4870 they really shine in high resolutions..|`|OhH876pbaa	for 100 best bets either ATI 4850 or Nvidia 9800GT    have look on www.aria.co.uk or www.ebuyer.com  both uk sites and are good. (Ive used them both before)
Ca3PRfPqaa	2.26 ghz of cpu is much faster than 2.0 ghz... with your specs you san play gta 4 and any other games... almost all of the games can be played in your pc...|`|UnVkjwNpaa	hardly any difference at all.|`|gQrWcjcuaa	13% difference, so not too much of a difference you'd hardly notice it to be honest. Most recent games are reliant on your video card not your CPU, so any two given games, you'd still have almost negligible performance differences. If the cost difference is less than $75 I'd consider getting the upgrade, otherwise no.
ffmq1UO0aa	There are alot of methods to do this. I have to do this myself in a few days, so I've read up on it. I'll cover it briefly and give you a link to the article that helped me.<br>  <br>  Vista has a built in transfer program that you can use, you can do this a number of ways through discs, flash drive, external hard drive.. etc. It can be troubling to do on flash drives and discs if you can't fit things on all at once. Alot of people have large files that just won't fit at all because they are too big for a disc or drive.<br>  <br>  You can also do this without Vista's help by connecting both computers to a network (Hopefully you already have one set up) and enabling file sharing as well as placing them in the same "workgroup".<br>  <br>  Read this for more information: <br>  <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc748915.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/libra...</a><br>  (I can't find the link I read originally, but I did find this official one.

hwiu7TCYaa	Only few people really have the competence to know the strength and weaknesses of each.<br>  <br>  If you are a beginner, then i would say, focus on MySQL, it will likely cover all your needs by far, and is supported on the majority of hosts.<br>  <br>  For instance, MySQL only supported subqueries as of around 2004. Also note that most beginners likely wouldn't even know what a subquery is, most would likely not even have noticed they where missing.

However the name memory pen / pen drive originated as the first memory of this type became popular as the memory was placed in a real pen.|`|f9c10f470f3f0acd2faaacacb18411c3aa	There is no difference what so ever. It all depends on the make. Some call them pens, some them pen drives, some call them memory sticks.|`|Cg7yWSo9aa	im not sure but i prefer a memory stick. Memory pen just doesn't sound right.

8vWwX8SXaa	You need to make a video for it.  A video can also be a plain black colour.|`|AA12270666	you could just get the song and put it in the audio, and for the picture you could just get a random pic of like a penguin or something.<br>  <br>  haah or something relating to your song.<br>  or a pic of yourself.<br>  <br>  it doesnt have to be a video, it could just be a picture if you want.<br>  <br>  <br>  like go to an editing program, stick your song into the audio timeline then get a picture and put it on then stretch the duration time so that it is as long as the song.|`|VucRSCd8aa	it has to have a video. even if its just a picture slapped on, it wont work otherwise. if you do not know how to do this, go into window movie maker, click import picture and then import music (down the left) or you can drag it in. add the music to the timeline (the thing down the bottom) and the picture, and stetch it out to cover the whole of the song. save it (not as movie maker file, or it wont work) and upload. its pretty simple to get to grips with.|`|ELMJiW1baa	ok you just got to make a video its really easy u can put it into windows movie maker or any other video maker you have you don't need to add pictures but people would be entertained. so to youtube log on or get an account and log on look at the upper right part of the screen and click on upload. fill out all the spaces. click browse and find the video file you found wait for it to upload and then you should be done!|`|Qou4Y6NIaa	Import it into Windows Movie Maker, then add a picture or the title of the song.<br>  <br>  Then save it as a movie.
UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.<br>  <br>  Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college... <br>  <br>  I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.<br>  <br>  FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery <= costly bec not readily available like Dells... and FYI I also ran into a similar problem when attempting to upgrade the memory.<br>  <br>  Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dell.com/outlet" rel="nofollow">http://www.dell.com/outlet</a><br>  <br>  Hope Above Info Helps!|`|g65tuqwRaa	The extra crap that's preloaded is a given so you can't really avoid that<br>  Look into HP notebooks<br>  <a href="http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/computer_can_series.do?storeName=computer_store&category=notebooks&a1=Category&v1=Versatile+performance&series_name=CQ60Z_series" rel="nofollow">http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shoppi...</a>|`|Jf9aKluvaa	I can reccomend a laptop, it does have extra crap, but it can be removed without taking much time.

FBQZ06vraa	I'm not sure, but I think it means your Recovery partition (partition(1), possibly also known as drive D:) is missing, so there's nothing to recover with.<br>  <br>  Sorry.|`|H3qYfp6Paa	Check BIOS for your hard drive.<br>  Try to write 0's (Low level format) on you drive.

MeeJWmGtaa	Does the card reader support SDHC formats? Because that's what's needed when trying to use SD cards larger than 2 GB.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yeah, just buy a card reader that's clearly marked as SDHC compatible. Anything from Sandisk at Walmart is OK (if so marked)
RQsrhT3Daa	You can install it, but you might not be able to run it off another computer as the coniguration would be wrong.<br>  This chance might occur, and it might not.So I suggest you try it as I have installed softwware on my usb and they work just fine.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	I know there are portable versions of Firefox and Thunderbird.
I51RUYZraa	both new hardware devices could be the culprit and it would not be a bad idea to remove one then the other to eliminate this as the possible problem.  The new RAM is a far more likely cause as it boot dependant hardware (meaning the computer cannot function properly without it being in tip top shape) RAM is also EXTREMELY electrostatically sensitive and can be easily damages by static discharge even if the discharge is too light for you to even feel it.  If you or the person who installed it did not follow proper procedure in installation, this could easily be the problem.  I would also consider the power supply as most ATX based power supply units have a few protection devices that will immediately shut down in the event it becomes too hot or the power draw exceeds the maximum that the supply can provide.|`|e5885b25c00e9b8109c2ca7925fa0a5eaa	First step is to take out the RAM you installed, then power on the computer.  If that fixes it, you may have a bad stick of RAM, but try reseating it just to make sure.|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	Have another look at the ram,Take the new one out and switch your computer on see what happens.|`|xgNujXsuaa	Buy a MAC|`|2LZJOvMyaa	could be a number of things, try removing the new ram you put in ( i know it will be slower) but if comp remains stable then you know that is the problem.<br>  are you getting a blue screen saying beginning dump of physical memory?<br>  if so then 90 percent sure it is hdd problem.<br>  but it souns to me that most likely it could be your power supply dyeing hence it just turning of on you.|`|lPrfbb1Maa	this used to happen to me... it was the hard drive and motherboard for me. In the end i bined it and bought a laptop|`|g7M1DxFCaa	If the problem started when you fitted the ram then that's probably the cause.  The first obvious cause could be if the memory is faulty or not inserted into it's sockets properly.  Another possibility is that the memory is not as fast as the original memory and that the BIOS settings are for the higher speed memory.  If there's a difference then it should be set at the speed of the slowest memory sticks.|`|k5KuYkkKaa	The first answer may be correct, I've read in several forums that defective memory can cause your system to crash.
bP8N4OR1aa	First, you have to share the resource on the server.  Pick the folder u want to share on the server.  right click it, go to sharing and security.  Share it, and pickk a name.

Limewire PRO fast for free.<br>  And it doesn't eat up massive RAM while running.<br>  <br>  Kazaa isn't a good idea either. Kazaa lite is what you would want, but I personally don't like Kazaa. It's really slow and limited compared to Frostwire.<br>  <br>  Standard Kazaa has spyware and Lite doesn't.<br>  <br>  But yeah Frostwire all the way.

uBY8R3L6aa	The audio file must be sent as an attachment to a text message and addressed to <your phone number>@vzwpix.com. This is your phone's MMS (multimedia messaging system) email address.

Select the "Option" command (right soft key) and save the audio file as a ringtone while it is playing.<br>  <br>  You do NOT need to convert the file beforehand---your Voyager will handle this for you. I've sent numerous wma files and they are converted to ringtone files when you select the save as ringtone option.

Select a song you want to use to be your ringtone.<br>  <br>  2. Convert that file to be used as ringtones to MP3 format. You can either burn it to a CD then rip it, or use JHymn.<br>  <br>  3. Convert the ringtones file to WAV, shorten it to 30 seconds or less. You can also use Audacity for that task.<br>  <br>  4. Reduce the sound quality to be PCM, mono, 8 kHz, 16-bit. I was unable to figure out how to do that in Audacity, so I simply used the sound recorder app that comes with Windows.<br>  <br>  5. Use PureVoice Converter to convert the WAV file to a QCP file (drag the WAV file onto pvconv.exe).<br>  <br>  6. Upload the QCP file to the Mobile Phone Uploader. (like topshareware)<br>  <br>  7.

One is, communicate with friends: keep them up to date on where you are and what you're doing at the moment. "I'm heading over to Starbuck's" (Then one of them, Herbert, says, "How 'bout if I meet you there?") Or maybe, "I'm really having a problem with this PHP program." and Susie says, "Can I help?" ...<br>  <br>  Another is, follow George Stefanopolous and see his latest one-liners about what's happening in the news.<br>  <br>  It's just a little window on the world. Short one-liners (140 characters per message) traded back and forth between people of YOUR choosing, and they can choose to answer YOUR messages, or not, and you can choose to answer THEIR messages, or not.

zTuc5eDIaa	No, LCD monitors do not display interlaced video (the i at the end of 1080i stands for "interlaced"). All computer monitors are progressive scan.<br>  <br>  1080i/p are ATSC broadcasting standards used on TV, not PC resolutions. So it's a little misleading to compare them. But if you have a video that is 1920x1080 pixels (the 16:9 1080i/p standard used in HDTV and Blu-Ray), and your LCD monitor also supports that resolution, you can watch that video on your computer at 100% zoom, without any stretching, shrinking, or distorting.<br>  <br>  However from what I understand, most widescreen monitors have an aspect ratio of 16:10 rather than 16:9. So it will not be exactly that same as 1080p, but very close.|`|MiglQlyRaa	About LCD computer monitors 1080i can be read in <a href="http://yahoo-finance-st.blogspot.com/?q=LCD%20computer%20monitors%201080i" rel="nofollow">http://yahoo-finance-st.blogspot.com/?q=...</a>

Oliq3ZDnaa	I wouldn't say Standard, I would say Minimum. Most Average Computers have 2GB Memory, at least 120GB Hard Drive, and a Dual Core Processor, such as Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD Athlon X2, for the least. Recommended as far as what I would say would be 3-6GB Memory, 250GB HD, and a minimum 2.0+GHz Processor Dual Core.|`|kqoCK3OXaa	If you are looking for a laptop with Vista, I would recommend getting 3GB of RAM.  The processor speed and hard drive will be plenty for you (unless you are a hard-core gamer or graphics person).  Vista (32-bit, standard home version) likes to gobble up RAM, so get the max 3GB - it cannot handle more, so don't overpay for a laptop with 4GB, as it won't be used.<br>  AMD processors are typically cheaper with close to same power as Intel, although they run hotter.  AMD Athlon and Intel Pentium are the higher grade processors, vs AMD Athlon and Intel Celeron.<br>  <br>  I think the lowest hard drive you can get new is 250GB, and that would take ALOT of programs, music and movie downlods to fill it up!|`|I91lFgTdaa	The standard Processors are Intel and AMD. GB have around 120 to 200, and memory around 1 GB to 2 - 4 GB or RAM. These are the Standards which maybe the ones you are looking for. Currently Acer is the Cheapest one out in the market.|`|9SXnUOb3aa	These people are stupid..<br>  <br>  <br>  THE STANDARD, which is low end, is 1.6gHZ processor, 60GB Hard Drive,<br>  <br>  and 1GB ram|`|WG5VyM4Caa	Most companys are selling Intel based CPU vs AMD nowadays. And dual core is coming a standard at around a 2.5GHz base clock speed.<br>  <br>  As far as RAM goes, I would assume 2GB is becoming a standard amount.<br>  <br>  This of course all assumes that you purchase from major online retailers, like Dell, or HP, versus local, home Mom and Pop shops.

If you want to let them manage their own site you have to get reseller hosting, but if you're gonna do that for them any of these plans will do.|`|W55Mw8ypaa	You'll need to find a web host that will sell you a Reseller's Account.  From there, you can make a new account for each of your clients.  Most web hosts will also be able to help you with registering the domain names or guide you through anything else you need.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	1) I give my clients options (and show them how to find more by themselves), then let them buy their own domain name and web host.  I create sites, I don't sell hosting or names.<br>  <br>  2) Part of the deliverables of a web site are the pages - all the files, html, php, etc.  I deliver, they pay.  That ends the contract, unless they buy updating or maintenance.|`|gebjlwkPaa	I'd buy a web hosting reseller account from somewhere like <a href="http://customer.heartinternet.co.uk/aff.cgi?entry=slZnLHB0ic0VpvBbKUBcYw" rel="nofollow">http://customer.heartinternet.co.uk/aff....</a> and then you 'sell' each client their hosting. For domain registration, use <a href="http://www.123-reg.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.123-reg.co.uk/</a> where you set up your master billing account and then register the domains in the name of the client - but 123 bill you, then you bill the client.<br>  <br>  That way, you can make a small ongoing profit from yearly hosting renewals. <br>  <br>  You should give the client full access to their hosting account and any files you've created for them. The idea of making them pay again for files is very outdated and a throwback to the old print design world.
c94edb500cc7fe12b1da30dfd93db57caa	As the person above me said, make your photobucket account private.<br>  <br>  Craigslist also allows SOME HTML, but I'm not sure how much...  But if you want to make the picture clickable to a website this is how you'd do it in HTML:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com"><img src="http://www.photobucket.com/picturea...<br>  <br>  hope that helps, and I hope it works!!  The first link (after href) is where you want it to go -- your college's website.  The second link (after src) is the image direct link for photobucket.  Good luck!!|`|WhVSb2fbaa	you can make your photobucket account private, and then if the pic is clicked on people can see the pic but thats all they won't be able to browse your album.

1NWjta2jaa	Both of them are wireless. One uses a Bluetooth connection and the other one uses infrared or Wi-Fi connection. <br>  Get a Bluetooth printer and a Bluetooth adapter for your desktop. The adapter for a desktop can be USB or a card you install inside. Both are cheap.|`|XlyLakYAaa	Wireless uses WiFi typically.  Bluetooth uses bluetooth.  Both are OK for wireless printing, but the WiFi option would be better, in my opinion.  Currently I have my desktop (w/o wireless) hooked up to a wireless router and a laptop hooked up wirelessly and both can print on my wireless printer so that would probably be a good setup for you as well.|`|syKhOl3eaa	If you have a bluetooth printer you can have it connected wireless to only one computer and the rage and speed will be less.<br>  <br>  If you go For wireless printer and if you have an router .then you would be able to print from all the computers which are connected to the router.<br>  The speed range and connectivity will also be good.

They allow you to listen to the song beforehand so you know what you're going to download. They also have a large international collection in case you like listening to international selections.. Just search for a song, and scroll down. Ignore the 3 links on top, they're just spam and other useless stuff. Enter the code (sometimes it just asks to type a 3 letter code) and click download mp3. Then the code box will go away and you can just click on the top link. The bottom link for "High Speed Download" is a different useless site.

There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!|`|8m6fJ6cXaa	It is a hoax trying to get money from you.  Dont do anything.  Go to Trend Micro's web site and run their House Call Program.

The malicious software resides in otherwise innocuous-looking music Windows Media Audio (.wma) files that, when opened, changes all .mp3 and .mp3 files on a host system to Windows Media Audio (.wma) format.<br>  <br>  Audio files altered by the Trojan won't lose their .mp2 or .mp3 file extensions. Rather, the Trojan embeds in each converted media file a placeholder, so that when a victim tries to listen to it, the song is opened up in Windows Media Player. At that point, the victim is prompted to download an audio codec in order to continue playback. If the victim installs the codec, the Trojan installs a program that gives the authors control over the user's system. <br>  <br>  Do not fill out any forms or  respond to any prompts on your computer at this stage until you have located and removed the trojan.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hopefully this guide may help you in removing it:<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://securityresponse.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2008-071823-3029-99&tabid=3" rel="nofollow">http://securityresponse.symantec.com/sec...</a>
ca9800e875bb4c0b4dbd33a8358d5eefaa	Several possibilities. First, location. Walls, heating ducts, appliances and the like block the signal. Move the computer or the router.<br>  Second could be interference. A 2.4gig wireless phone is on the same radio band. Routers can operate on channels 1-11 in the US. Set it at other channels. Also you could be in a building where there are other wifi routers all using channel 6 with you. Get the Stumbler from <a href="http://stumbler.net." rel="nofollow">http://stumbler.net.</a> This program shows you what wifi routers are nearby. Choose a channel that they are not using.|`|AVDTZ63Oaa	Yeah.<br>  Your router or modem is pooched, and I'm guessing from the on again off again behavior that it's a thermal problem. It's either that or it's your ISP being dorky. More likely your gear.<br>  <br>  Go find your modem and router. (If they are the same device, that's fine)<br>  UNPLUG both of them, and get in your car and go to the nearest Radio Shack. Buy yourself a can of compressed air. Drive home. By now, your modem and router are nic and cool, and fully powered down, and probably your ISP has dropped your DHCP lease. This is where we want to be. <br>  <br>  Next up: CLEAN the gear with the compressed air. Hold the can about 4 inches back from the vents on your router and your modem, and fire several short bursts (half second) in to several different location s around the vents. Be careful not to get too close, or you run a small risk of freezing the componants which can damage them. Four inches is plenty. After you have done four or five short bursts in each device, and blown some of the dust out, Plug them back in, and place them someplace where they have a half inch of clearance all around, and especially near the vents. These things behave much nicer if they can breathe. <br>  <br>  Another thing that can cause this exact behavior if the cleanup doesn't seem to help, is a bad power cable on one of the devices. Those things can go bad, and what they do is.. yup.. get hot. When you are doing the unplugging part, put the adapter bricks against your cheek or the back of your hand. if it feels more than a little bit warm (some heat is normal) try to find a new adapter that has the same voltage and polarity.

Download it, install it, and have it update and do a scan of your entire PC.<br>  <br>  Also, make SURE you have automatic Windows Updates turned on, and that it's updating, and also make sure you're behind a firewall (a router, preferably) and also I'd stop using Internet Explorer and download Firefox instead (and you can add an add-on called "NoScript" to it as well, to make it much safer and more secure. . <br>  <br>  also download a free program called Sandboxie from sandboxie.com<br>  <br>  It's a sandbox and if you open your browser in the sandbox, then nothing you encounter from the internet can make any permanent changes to your PC ( unless you click to "recover" them). . so it's a very safe way to browse.

sbK4KcvBaa	Well, I only search bands, and the first entry is almost always porn, so don't download it.. Then I like to narrow it by CD, and download all of that CD. then you have to move the location of the downloaded files before you can import them into iTunes, like any other file. I usually make a File for each Band, and just Move them all into there, and import them all at once. If that doesn't work, sorry, something is different between your version and mine.

Now you can turn this option off, but who wants to sit there for hours sifting through thousands of options for the sake of a couple of songs? With the software I recommended, you don't have to share sh*t (Excuse the language)<br>  <br>  2) Preview before you play<br>  - With limewire, you have to start downloading the song before you can preview it. Now this might not sound like a problem to most, but for people with super fast internet connections that can download songs at the speed of light, you won't have the time to preview it before it plays because it would be on your computer before your mouse could get anywhere near that play button. Now suppose it's a virus and not the song you wanted? You see, Youtube of course lets you play the video (they don't expect you to download, so playing the video is the only thing you can do), which not only allows you to check and see whether or not it's the right song, but you can check its quality as well. <br>  <br>  3) Virus Risks<br>  - See, Limewire downloads from other people's computers meaning that they could've downloaded that song from anywhere. So it could potentially be a virus. But ask yourself: when was the last time you heard about Youtube having a virus? Youtube performs maintanence nearly everyday, so even if they were to get a virus, they would detect it before it could do any serious damage to the site itself.  Plus, this is Google, the masters of coding/programming. Hell, they probably made their own anti virus software to scan the videos before they're actually uploaded. You have to realize: Google is a huge company. They wouldn't let some bad computer code cooked up by an amateur hacker destroy something they paid over $1 billion for. <br>  <br>  4) Settings<br>  - When you download Limewire for the first time, you don't automatically start downloading music. You have to first configure what seems like thousands of unnecessary settings. These range from turning it on and off as your torrent client, to the quality, to what types of files you would like to share (why is that even there?), to settings that talk about proxies (you're probably thinking "What the hell are proxies?"). Basically, it's too much of a hassle for those of us who simply want to download a couple of songs. Well, with the software I suggested, you only do four things:<br>  - Install<br>  - Select the folder<br>  - Select the quality<br>  - Download your songs<br>  <br>  5) Wider Variety of Music<br>  - True enough, Limewire, Napster and those other sharing sites have a pretty large collection of songs, but when it comes down to it, Youtube is the biggest. Admit it, every song that you couldn't find on Limewire or iTunes, you could easily find on Youtube. Not only new generation songs, but songs from commercials and old/new TV Shows, 80's hits, classic rock, Def Jam Poetry, exclusive remixes, underground rap, extremely rare tracks that you thought you would never find. You're in luck especially if you listen to Hip Hop or Rock simply because of the huge amount of remixes that can be found on Youtube. Most of which can't be found on Limewire, and certainly won't be found on iTunes. But you're thinking "I don't know how to download from Youtube!" Well, now you can. <br>  <br>  <br>  Now, for my last point (I'm almost done, stay with me), I would like to emphasize what I stated about sharing. Now even though Limewire claims to share only the folder you told it to, you have to understand the immense amount of skilled hackers there are. You see how people who have never even heard of Limewire get their computers hacked every day, and Limewire damn near provides the tools with all of this "folder sharing" business. Plus, Limewire shares your IP Address (just like torrents), which is basically the key to your internet connection. Basically, this program kicks Limewire's ***, but in case you need further proof, let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages:<br>  <br>  Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter:<br>  <br>  Pros:<br>  1) Shares absolutely nothing, not even the IP Address. You're not required to share with anyone else.<br>  <br>  2) You don't have to configure 1000's of settings as soon as you start the software (as you do with limewire). You just pick the folder you want to save it to, and then start downloading<br>  <br>  3) No viruses.<br>  <br>  4) Preview before you play<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  n/a<br>  <br>  <br>  Limewire:<br>  Pros:<br>  - You can download free music<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  - Everything else<br>  <br>  Now as I said before, this software is completely free, and can be downloaded from www.dvdvideosoft.com|`|dtE5GHh7aa	Hi, i think this is the best and fast way, foremost，it is full free!!<br>  1.Pls paste youtube vide url or any other flv address on <a href="http://www.convertdirect.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.convertdirect.com/</a><br>  2.

ULw1777caa	You need the router,|`|7aHsYbcfaa	Yes, it's different with a modem -- the modem can only connect to 1 computer at a time.  A router can connect multiple computers/devices to one internet connection.<br>  <br>  <br>  You have a few choices...<br>  <br>  First, and simplest, you can just move the network cable between the xbox and computer -- just remember to unplug the modem for 10 seconds afterward so it "redetects" what's connected.<br>  <br>  Second, and more convenient, you can get a router and share the connection between both the computer and xbox.  Remember to secure it if the router has wireless -- even if you aren't using the wireless you don't want others using your bandwidth and slowing you down.<br>  <br>  Third, and most complex, you could put a second network card in the computer and set up internet connection sharing - connecting the computer to the xbox with a crossover cable...but I don't recommend it because you'd have to leave the computer on and with prices anymore, it will cost as much as a router.|`|zId5dRS1aa	It depends on the modem. If it's a cable modem, it generally autoconfigs for you. If it's a DSL Modem, you'll have to go to your Xbox's network settings and set it to use PPPoE and enter in your DSL account information.<br>  <br>  The issue here lies with authentication for your internet. Your computer is most likely already set up to login with whichever type of modem you have. If it's cable, it'll automatically assign an IP-Address to your computer (Once again, generally). DSL however almost always requires you to login to your DSL account assigned to you by your service provider. It uses a protocol called PPPoE for this.<br>  <br>  You don't NEED a router for this.

As for burning films onto a CD, films are usually larger than 700MB so would not fit onto the CD. I would suggest going for DVD's if you are planning on burning films. You would need a DVD writer for this though. Also, for watching DVD's on your TV DVD player, you will need to make sure that the files are in the correct format.

lb0bYSgUaa	In order to successfully remove malware infections (viruses, spyware, adware etc) from your PC you need to follow a methodical approach as well as using effective (and free) tools.  There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!

7vh5fOeRaa	If you plug it into the DVI connector on the motherboard, it's going to use the built-in graphics card, not your new one.<br>  <br>  There's no "pass-through" feature that will export the output from your new card to the integrated card that came with your motherboard.<br>  <br>  Once you install the new graphics card, make sure you connect the monitor directly to this new graphics card in order to utilize the display.  Also make sure to properly install the drivers for this new graphics card so you can take advantage of its features.<br>  <br>  Also, some on-board displays will work in conjunction with the new graphics card allowing you to set up a dual-monitor system (one monitor attached to the newly installed graphics card and the other to the integrated graphics chip)... if you have that situation, you'll still get a display on your monitor, even though you installed the new card.  However, that display is still using the integrated graphics chip and not your new card.  To take advantage of the advanced features and benefits of the card you installed, you must hook the monitor up to it.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|tllMnGooaa	Depends on the computer/cmos version, most newer computers will sense which one is plugged in and use it, older ones you have to go into bios/cmos and look thru the settings, it will say something like Primary Display First... and then you'll have a few choices,<br>  With onboard display there will be definatley be at least 1 and usually more options to it like how much ram to allow it to use.|`|1ISOS9Yxaa	If you plug it into your motherboard's standard connector, it will use your onboard graphics engine, not the video card you plug in.

D4jZM26Paa	Yes, it would take a lot of files to use up 320GB.|`|CD0JesQeaa	memory is different than storage space. <br>  my laptop has only 3 GB of memory but a 250 GB hard drive.<br>  <br>  If you are wanting more memory (to be able to run more things at a time) buying a bigger hard drive wont help you.<br>  <br>  you will need to go buy sticks of memory.|`|yHI6rfeUaa	First you are confusing memory with storage.  A hard drive, a second hard drive (internal or external), or a network attached storage drive is used to store files which are maintained regardless of whether the unit is on or off.  Memory can be thought of as short term storage where information is processed and stored for the short term and memory residing items that are not saved onto storage are lost when the unit is turned off.<br>  <br>  The question about whether 320 GB of storage is a decent amount really depends upon what you wish to do.  CAD files are fairly large.  The real question is how many CAD files do you intend to keep.  Clearly the more you store, the more storage you need to have.<br>  <br>  Having said that, 320 GB is fairly large by today's standard.  In a few years it will be considered moderate.<br>  <br>  Since you are talking about an external drive you may wish to start with a 320 GB and should it become full, you can add a second external drive to store the overflow.  This may be a prudent option for you.|`|voSRntCAaa	Yes 320 GB is a great Hard drive Space. Its the max you can get inside a laptop or notebook usually unless you go dual like me I have 640 but i have two 320 GB hard drives.|`|WOM8ZavGaa	That is going to be plenty for what you need it for. If you are really concerned about running out, you could buy  500 GB hard drive for about $150. 320 GB should be an excellent size though.|`|0xnv5waeaa	yeah it is pretty good<br>  but do you know there are better hard drives<br>  the best would be 1 terabyte but that is 1000 GB and seems like you don't use much memory so i would say yeah 320|`|GKGQQaObaa	According to the thing below, you need 1.3 gigs for the full install of the program and I'm im sure 318.7 GB will be plenty of harddrive.

I suggest getting a 500 GB drive though. Just because they are not that much more expensive and no one could ever have too much space. If you are running a program like AutoCAD then you might want to consider putting more RAM (memory) in your computer. 4GB of RAM would suffice.|`|9kfjIRLyaa	320 GB is a huge amount of memory.

lcchJUuCaa	you can use any PCI express graphics card even the new 2.0 they are all  backwards compatible.<br>  <br>  but that card you found will not run crysis worth crap<br>  try this site<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/</a><br>  and your Pentium D will not handle crysis to well you could get a 500 dollar graphics card but you processor wouldn't be able to keep up<br>  <br>  I would recommend any of these card really but of coarse the more expensive cards will run crysis better|`|0f53624e253ff98b5745955d48febbc0aa	I'm sorry, but your computer supports a very limited amount of graphics cards nowadays. It uses PCI-E 1.0, which is no longer used as a standard for graphics cards. However, I'm sure you could find a decent PCI-E 1.0 graphics card. But you would have to pay lots more money for one that can play crysis. I don't think a Pentium D can handle Crysis either. My suggestion is to look for a (relatively) cheap and a (relatively) high quality PCI-E card. Good luck, Crysis is pretty cool.

Review the list and check to see that every item you downloaded is in the list.<br>  <br>  Once you have checked the list, you need to call Apple.

This is OK, and you can just follow those.

SJM0rzHtaa	Umm...  The non-express PCI 8400GS is actually a DOWNGRADE.  It will be SLOWER than your 865G integrated graphics.<br>  <br>  The non-express PCI graphics card is hobbled by the molasses-slow 33mHz PCI bus transfer speed bottleneck, which cannot feed the GPU with data fast enough.  That is why non-express PCI graphics card will ALWAYS be slower than integrated graphics, no matter how fast the PCI card's GPU is.<br>  <br>  (Don't confuse PCIExpress with regular PCI.  PCI Express graphics cards are MUCH faster because PCIexpress transfers data at at least 1.5gHz per lane, and there are 16 lanes.)<br>  <br>  The integrated 865G on-board graphics on the other hand is on the motherboard AGP bus which transfers data at 66mHz at 8x data pumping, which is up to 16 times faster than non-express PCI.<br>  <br>  If your ThinkCenter has an AGP slot, you should get a Radeon HD3650 AGP video card.  THAT will be an upgrade.  And since the Radeon HD3650 draws only 50W at full load, it should work with that 200W PSU.|`|0f53624e253ff98b5745955d48febbc0aa	No, your case looks like it's power supply is welded onto it. That makes it impossible to remove your power supply without ripping it out of your case (literally), plus your current PSU has a really weird form factor, it isn't ATX, meaning that the psu you're thinking of buying will not fit.

BsJFeWDwaa	The first thing to do is to download the file, size does not really matter so you don't need to compress it. Next, check the file format i.e if it is avi, flv, mpeg, etc. it is at this point you can diagnose the problem because windows media player does not play all formats. for example most editions of windows media player can't play .flv or .mov (mobile phone recordings). To confirm open media player, press F1(help) and check format. However, don't despair, there are a lot of free media players you can download online to complement windows media player.

JuoHnUfOaa	Hmm.  That is a good question.  At first it would seem that CAD would help, but CAD is really more about designing buildings and physical objects and such.<br>  Programming design may be a bit better, but not by much.  What you really want is an art class.  I don't know what programs are available for graphic design, stuff like Flash is all I know about (its not really my area of expertise).<br>  <br>  But what you want is not drafting, but design, these are two different things.<br>  <br>  So, to make a long story short.  I think graphic design and art classes are what you are looking for.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Designing is art, developing is code, so no.

If your school doesn't give programming without a programming language, talk to the head of the department (or have him/her email me).
I721A1RRaa	You have done it the wrong way around, but it is still workable :)<br>  You need to run GPartEd (in Ubuntu, as root) and resize the linux partition and add a FAT32 partition (You will need to do this from a LiveCD otherwise things will break) once you have resized and added a fat32 partition (This can take a while) you can install Windows 98 on the FAT32 partition, once you have done this Windows will have written to the bootsector thus removing GRUB in the process, you need to boot from the Ubuntu LiveCD (again) and re-install GRUB to the MBR, here is a guide:<br>  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/reinstall-ubuntu-grub-bootloader-after-windows-wipes-it-out/" rel="nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/re...</a><br>  Once you have done this, you will need to add Windows to your GRUB menu, you can do this by adding an entry in /boot/grub/menu.lst.<br>  In Ubuntu, open the terminal and run 'gksu gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst' and add an entry for Windows, it will probably be at (hd0,1) but you need to figure that out, the entry should be something like this:<br>  <br>  title  Windows 98<br>  root (hd0,1)<br>  chainloader +1<br>  <br>  FYI, (hd0,1) means hard drive one, partition two.<br>  I hope this helps, but if not GIYF :D|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Windows 98 is so much easier to use?

The Ubuntu install does the dual boot setup. <br>  <br>  Bear in mind Win98 excludes USB/firewire connectivity and you are limited to 2GB files with FAT32 format as maximum file size and such a file has to be outside of any folders. Win98 was odd in that it was 16-bit. Drivers for such things as modems, printers, etc. you will need the original CD or floppies that came with Win98 compatible drivers. All other Window products are 32-bit, at least, and many NT drivers work for them.<br>  <br>  The Windows install can happen on its own partitician, but then you have to edit Ubuntu GRUB startup program.

adaa295f0b10c7200b3ca34035915ea9aa	Network Magic looks like a tool that makes it easier for non-technical people to set up and manage small networks. It doesn't look as though it particularly intrudes on your privacy.<br>  <br>  But even if Network Magic is OK, most of the activities you describe are fundamentally not secure, and it would be easy for someone to monitor your activity. That's because most internet traffic is not secure, and it's fairly straightforward to intercept and read what people are doing. It's even easier if you use unsecured wireless, because people could just pick up your signal.<br>  <br>  It is possible to protect yourself e.g. bank sites use SSL encryption, that is secure and private; you can encrypt your wireless signal (use WPA, not WEP).<br>  <br>  Most sites and traffic aren't secure, and if you must gaurantee your privacy, you can use a secure proxy (search online for "anonymity proxy" or similar). This encrypts the traffic between you and the proxy (like a web site), so the site you end up visiting only knows you've come via the proxy but not who you are, and nobody between you and the proxy can see what you are doing. Of course, you have to trust the people running the proxy.<br>  <br>  But overall, most hacking or snooping is targeted at trying to get control of your computer (which a good firewall and antivirus will protect you against), or people with lots of money. So you're right to want your privacy - but don't worry too much.|`|AA10652678	For the average computer it nothing but here a run down. <br>  <br>  When you add a router to you computer it like having a hub and you can connect computer to each others from the hub. But to that you have set up each computer to network them together. Now this is the security breach because if you have wireless someone can see your network and set up on it that like adding thereself. So what you need is a password to stop this. That is call a secured network. To put on extra security you would use a encripted password meaning that it would be coded so that it would be hard to brake if there was a loop hole in your computer ports. So you are looking at hacker trying to get in now. They normally would not do that unless they where just bored or new you had a lot of dough.

9zrkeZcqaa	The only thing that I, and others that have answered, can think  of is the laptop issue.  If you use the touchpad, then you need to be careful of sweeping across it when typing.  A soulution:  get a wireless or corded mouse to connect to the computer.  This won't directly solve the problem, but if you disable the touch pad, you will no longer have the issue.  If you are using a desktop, I have no idea what to do except contact your manufacturer, hopefully it is still under warranty.  Good luck! :)|`|nJh6yRHJaa	Do you use a laptop with a tap-to-click trackpad? <br>  <br>  If you do, then it is possible that your palm is tapping the trackpad while you type, which would make the trackpad click possibly in the middle of a word.|`|TTWdxpLZaa	are u hitting spacebar in your words|`|Zj4Bi2W1aa	if you use a laptop, that happens to me all the time. it drives my crazy... you dont know youre doing it but while you are typing your wrist drifts to the mouse :D|`|7T3mLREhaa	Do you have a laptop with a touchpad mouse?

nJh6yRHJaa	You are correct about your problem. It sounds like you bought the DVD version of the Sims 2 Expansion pack. I do not recall if EA released CD versions of the later expansion packs and my gut tells me that they didn't.<br>  <br>  If you cannot find a CD version, then your only option is to buy a DVD drive. <br>  <br>  (Side note: These days, DVD readers are fairly cheap and are widely used. It would probably be a good idea to have one anyway as CDs are being phased out in favor of the larger capacity DVDs)<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: In response to the above: Unless you have a friend that can/is willing to break the encryption for you, copying it onto a CD really isn't an option. It should be noted that this violates copyright laws as well (ones that really ought not to apply in this context). Also, I highly doubt one CD could hold all of the data for this expansion pack: a DVD can hold about 4.7 gigabytes, where as a CD can hold about 0.7 gigabytes (700 megabytes).|`|t5sYXwSqaa	Sounds like it could be a dvd. If you only have a CD player you will not be able to play it. Get your friend to copy it onto a cd. It also could be that your CD player will only take either  + or - cd.

Vt0xnuWpaa	All of them will easily play COD4, any Halflife2 engine game, and many of the strategy games out right now. However, they will all struggle with DX10 games like Crysis on Medium and High - they are only meant for casual gaming and multimedia. If you don't really care about super high quality on every single game, they should be perfectly fine.<br>  <br>  Considering that each of the configurations is 750 pounds apiece, the top performer would clearly be the Dell Studio 17 seems, which also seems to be a great deal considering all that's been equipped with for only 750 pounds (Since it has a 2.26GHz Processor, compatible with ram that's a bit faster, has the Blu-Ray rom drive, and runs the newer Centrino2 Chipset).<br>  <br>  The XPS M1530 is very close behind with a processor configuration that's a tad bit slower and runs the older but still very capable Centrino Chipset. The GeForce 8600M GT and the Radeon Mobility 3650 run very close performance numbers. However, if it's the same cost as the others, the unit's lacking the blu-ray drive and processor speed. I own one myself with a faster processor and better display and I enjoy it very much.<br>  <br>  The XPS M1330 is lowest performing for the 750 pound price. It has the same speed as the M1530, but the graphic card is a bit behind. The screen is also smaller and the disk drive isn't the blu-ray one. Those are about the only downfalls though.<br>  <br>  The last thing you might consider between them that is not performance but practicality. The M1330 and M1530 are a lot more portable due to their size. You might find the Studio 17 a bit bigger and more heavy - harder to carry around. Screen size also correlates to battery life as well (on the same capacity battery).|`|MIR3eC5kaa	all dells are a piece of crap!!!!!  get a hp pavilion dv5t it has great graphics! the graphics card and processer and ram makes the computer work the bigger gigs the better!!!

Move all remaining data.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that all data files have "file extensions" which are recorded in the registry.

uhUxsAhIaa	I believe that myspace made myspace 2.0 so that you cant use codes to change the format and style of the page, so what i did is i went back to the original myspace, and edited that. just search for myspace editor on yahoo or google. a good one is thomas' myspace editor. hope this helped|`|ELMJiW1baa	ok i didnt download 2.0 because it looks like it has a diffrent format so if i were you i would try typing in myspace 2.0 backgrounds or layouts or whatever hope i was helpful
VWLtJoX2aa	Hm, it should work with Vista but try resetting the router to all default settings.  Another thing to try with these dang modems is to unplug both the modem and router to totally shut them down.  They plug them in and see if they get along better.  It worked for me more than once with my DSL modem and Linksys router.|`|TTWdxpLZaa	it may just need reseting the router will handle both / i have 3 running at the same time all have different os/systems it just slows down the internet to run all at once/ or run setup cd/ or make sure plug and play is working linksys does have a toll free line for assist.

And No it is not legal, You can get fined for it.|`|rLkaxcY2aa	First of all Limewire its self is most certainly legal, now what most people use it for is a gray area of the law and could get you into some trouble.<br>  Second you can get a virus off of limewire quite easy if you don't know what u are doing. So you should be good with computers and have alot of knowledge of them if you use limewire. I have used it for some time now and have never had a problem. But im an expert<br>  <br>  >>Good Luck xD
t5sYXwSqaa	If these programs came with Kaspersky then you need them all. If you are saying that you had malware and spyware on before and these are now still there then you do not need them but it is benificial to have a couple of spyware/malware programs on as what one does not pick up the other will. You should only have one anti virus running on the machine as they slow the computer down and may cause conflicts with each other.|`|GQ63zs4Taa	you only need 2 things on your computer to fully protect it.  i would recommend malwarebytes anti malware and avira anti virus.  they are both free and do a great job.  or you could always go from windows to linux.  then you dont need any anti anything.|`|H3qYfp6Paa	One, Here is the best and it is free!<br>  Avast Home.<br>  <br>  Avast is an Anti-virus, Spam and malware protector.

Some built in webcams on laptop has the same name with the laptop's name.<br>  What you need to do is to know the manufacturer's name of your built in webcam, know the model number or version of the webcam, then if you already know the name and version of your camera, look it up on the internet and search for webcamera drivers, download and install it.<br>  <br>  You must download the driver setup that corresponds to the version of webcamera that you have.<br>  <br>  Note: Manufacturer's name and version must be the same with the ones you have for it to function, else it will only show black screen.<br>  Just look for the one for your version.
