GbaEEJvKaa	When you have quadratics like this I use a method called the ac. A is the first term and C is the last term in the equation. So the AC Method says AC is the sum of the middle term which is B. Lets use the quadratic you were given. A=6 and C=6 and multiply them and you will get 36. What are two numbers that can add up to 13 and multiply to give you 36? 9 *4 gives you 36 and 9+ 4 = 13 so that works<br>  So now the quadratic becomes this <br>  <br>  6x^2 + 9x +4x + 6<br>  Factor out common factors…<br>  3x(2x+3) + 2(2x+3) <br>  Cancel out the common factor which is (2x+3)… Now all you left with is<br>  (3x+2)(2x+3)<br>  And that is the ac method. There is much less trial and error with this method so saves time especially during an exam and it works for any quadartic.<br>  If your quadratic was 6x^2 + 13x - 6 , instead of +6 then you <br>  do a difference of B the middle term.|`|Clmy4YFBaa	6x^2 + 13x + 6<br>  = (3x + 2) (2x + 3)

It involves the force of attraction between a hydrogen atom (already bonded to another atom) and most often C, O, N atoms already bonded to another atom.  This force of attraction is temporary and easily broken.<br>  A chemical bond is the the sharing or transfer of electrons between two atoms resulting in a new compound.

uGippMj9aa	It could be to do with exposure to sun. Your body produces a pigment called melanin (eumelanin in the hair) that helps to absorb harmful rays from the sun (UV-rays). Hairs are created by the cells at the root being produced and pushed upwards, gradually filling with eumelanin and another hard protein called keratin. It could be that if there is more exposure to the sun, the hair starts producing more melanin, making it darker too. This is what happens in the skin when you get a tan.<br>  <br>  I tried looking everywhere (see the sources lol) to see why hair remains dark and skin only tans for a relatively short period of time but apparently we just don't know as of yet. There are a lot of gaps between knowing what causes the production of melanin (damage to the DNA by the sun's UV-rays) and the creation of this pigment so your guess is as good as anyones!|`|8cssUYFfaa	i think it just might be sun..

mGlFSclaaa	Acetic acid is produced both synthetically and by bacterial fermentation. Today, the biological route accounts for only about 10% of world production, but it remains important for vinegar production, as many nations' food purity laws stipulate that vinegar used in foods must be of biological origin. About 75% of acetic acid made for use in the chemical industry is made by methanol carbonylation, explained below. Alternative methods account for the rest. Total worldwide production of virgin acetic acid is estimated at 5 Mt/a (million tonnes per year), approximately half of which is produced in the United States. European production stands at approximately 1 Mt/a and is declining, and 0.7 Mt/a is produced in Japan. Another 1.5 Mt are recycled each year, bringing the total world market to 6.5 Mt/a.The two biggest producers of virgin acetic acid are Celanese and BP Chemicals. Other major producers include Millennium Chemicals, Sterling Chemicals, Samsung, Eastman, and Svensk Etanolkemi.

GASTNilgaa	The "rational zeros theorem" says that any rational roots of that polynomial must be integers dividing 70.  That's 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35, and 70, and each of these with minus signs.  In general there is no substitute for trying them all.  If you start with the small ones, 1, -1, -2, 2, 5, -5 you find that -2 and -5 are roots, so the polynomial is divisible by (x+2)(x+5).  When you do the division you're left with x^2 - 9x - 7, whose roots are irrational but you can get them from the quadratic formula.  So -2, -5, 9/2 + sqrt(109)/2, and 9/2 - sqrt(109)/2.

6c2be2f9234ae63b1e07a17e279442ceaa	Consider a drippy faucet. 3 drips every second, You could say the frequency of the dripping is 3 Hertz. <br>  f = 3 Hz<br>  What would the time between successive drips be? 1/3 of a second, right? That's called period and goes by the symbol T. <br>  T = 0.33 s<br>  <br>  If you were able to see that the period is 1/3 of a second, you understood that T=1/f. (I think it's a mistake to use the small t in that equation. See below.)<br>  <br>  Let's jump to the 3rd equation, the one you wrote V=v*T: I have a bit of a problem here. It looks like the mystery letter is a Greek letter lambda which is generally used for the wavelength, the length of the wave. I'll explain soon what that means. Greek letters have capitals and small versions, just like our regular letters. It appears that your book or teacher is using both the small (in the 2nd equation) and the capital (in the 3rd equatin) lambda. The small lambda might be described as an upside down y. The capital lambda looks like an upside down V. And it looks like these equations use both t and T for period. Strange. In physics we stick to either the capital or the small for a particular quantity -- usually. It looks like what's going on here is breaking that practice tho. <br>  <br>  So here's an explanation about that 3rd equation. OK, now you're on a dock out in a lake. Waves are coming in. Normally waves come 2 or 3 seconds apart, but just for discussion, let's say there are 3 waves that pass by you every second on their way to the shore. So the frequency is<br>  f=3 Hz<br>  Another way to say that is <br>  f = 3 cycles / second  (or waves / second) <br>  <br>  Let's say you measure the distance between peaks of the wave and it's 1 meter. That's called wavelength and the symbol I've generally seen for that is the small lambda.<br>  Lambda (wavelength) = 1 m <br>  <br>  The v in the 2nd and 3rd equations you're asking about is for velocity of the wave. Velocity meaning if you selected a particular wave peak 5 meters away and watched it approach, what would the speed of its approach be. Same speed as the ones going right past you. Think about the one just passing under you and the one 1 meter away coming towards you. If the frequency is 3 Hz, that next peak will be here in 1/3 of a second. Speed is distance/time. The distance is 1 meter and the time is 1/3 of a second. So the speed is<br>  v = 1 m / (1/3 s) = 3 m/s<br>  If you write the 3rd equation this way<br>  lambda = v*T,<br>  then it's lambda = 3 m/s * (1/3) s <br>  And the result is lambda = 1 m. Which is right from the measurements you made. It all ties together.<br>  <br>  There's really just 2 relationships here. <br>  f = 1/T<br>  lambda = v*T<br>  Algebraic manipulations give you the other 2 equations.

The quotient rule is [(low)(high)'-(high)(low)']/(low)^2. Then, when you get the derivative, set it equal to zero and solve. Since you will get a fraction, you will only want to solve the numerator for zero, since when the denominator is zero, you have an error. So factor the numerator and solve for x, and the solution(s) are your critical points

BowgGWy0aa	First you have to write a complete reaction, this one can be difficult & depending on your preference, or your instructors) it is set up differently.  Balancing is the same idea though. So, it is <br>  Zn + H2SO4 -> Zn(H2SO4) or<br>  Zn + H2SO4 -> Zn+2 + SO4- + H2(g) or<br>  Zn + H2SO4 -> Zn(SO4)2 + H2<br>  <br>  Zinc has a plus 2 charge, so it needs 2 molecules of SO4- to balance it. Bc there are 2 molecules of SO4- in the products, you have to have 2 on the right side, in the reactants, so you put a 2 in front of H2SO4 on the left side.  To account for the four molecules of H in the reactants, you put a 2 in front of the H2 in the product (2*2=4 molecules of H total). Now you have the same number of molecules of each on both sides of the equation so your balanced equation would look like:<br>  <br>  Zn + 2H2SO4 -> Zn(H2SO4)2 or<br>  Zn + 2H2SO4 -> Zn+2 + 2SO4- + 2H2(g) or<br>  Zn + 2H2SO4 -> Zn(SO4)2 + 2H2(g)<br>  <br>  Not the best equation to learn how to balance from.|`|LRns6R5iaa	First the balanced equation:<br>  <br>  Zn(s) + H2SO4(aq) --> H2(g) + ZnSO4(aq)<br>  <br>  Zinc is existing with an oxidation number of 0 at the beginning, H is existing with an oxidation number of +1.  Sulfate anion has an overall charge of -2, which is why you have two Hydrogens on the left.  When the rxn moves to the right, Zinc loses two electrons (oxidation) to form Zn +2 cation, while the hydrogens pick up the electrons (reduction) that were given up by the Zinc and then combine (because hydrogen is diatomic) and forms hydrogen gas.|`|QgSXFlTKaa	remember these few basic principles of acid chemical reaction.<br>  <br>  acid+alkali--->salt+water<br>  eg.HCl+NaOH---->NaCl+H2O<br>  <br>  acid+metal--->salt=hydrogen gas<br>  eg.Zn+H2SO4--->ZnSO4+H2<br>  <br>  acid+carbonate--->salt+CO2+H2O<br>  2HNO3+Na2CO3---->2NaNO3+CO2+H2O<br>  <br>  stoichiometry balance is to make the number of reactant elements to be the same as the number of product elements.Take for instance:<br>  <br>  2HNO3+Na2CO3--->2NaNO3+CO2+H2O<br>  we know that carbonate ion,CO3 carries a -2 charge and sodium,Na carries a +1 charge.hence the formula for sodium carbonate is (Na)2(CO3)1,just cross over the charge.However we usually dont write the charge of +1 or  -1.hence we can simplify the formula as Na2CO3.<br>   <br>  step 1-just write out the formula of each element in the simplest form 1st. eg:Na2CO3,H2SO4(SO4 has a -2 charge while H has a +1 charge)<br>  <br>  step 2-write out the possible equation of the reaction<br>  *as we know that carbonate react with acid to produce salt,CO2 and H2O,so the reaction equation is as follows;<br>  Na2CO3+HNO3------>NaNO3+CO2+H2O<br>  <br>  Step 3-calculate the number of elements and try to balance them.<br>  the equation in step 2 is a correct equation,however its stoichiometry is not balanced.take for instance,it has 1 H atom on the left hand side but 2 H atom on the right hand side.Calculate  the most obvious element first.<br>  <br>  eg.both side got the same number of O atom but a different number of  H(1 on the left hand side and 2 on the  right hand side)therefore we know that we have to alter  the stoichiometry of HNO3 as it is the only one element which carries the H atom.<br>  <br>  Na2CO3+2HNO3------>NaNO3+CO2+H2O<br>  <br>  although u get the same number of H atom on both side now,the stoichiometry of O is different.try to balance them by using the same principle.<br>  <br>  Na2CO3+2HNO3--->2NaNO3+CO2+H2O  is the final equation.<br>  <br>  stoiciometry balancing  easy if only u hav practised a lot.<br>  Tips----understand the reactions well.<br>  -----understand the way to get the formula of each compound.<br>  ------Able to write out the reaction equation <br>  -----be patience on calculating the number of each element<br>  <br>  wishing you happy learning!!!

XiMQLv8Oaa	Philip J. has a good conceptualization of  Time Reversal. It is along this line of reasoning that time could reverse if the Present could be compressed back to its smaller previous scale. According to Einstein, the geodesics of any event, phenomena is so great that to alter it would require tremendous energy. So for this purpose of reducing the spatial configuration of an object, I may postulate, the blackhole could possess this tremendous energy to "shrink" matter to its past smaller dimensionality. Gravitational shrinkage could be a key to time reversal, and the blackholes have it.|`|O7rMKLEMaa	No object can go as fast as light. When you postulate an object that can, you negate all the laws of physics, including the direction of time and the law of causation. In our universe, time always goes forward. That much is generally accepted by the scientific community. <br>  <br>  A somewhat less widely held belief is this: The force of gravity propagates billions of times faster than light. In fact, Einstein tacitly assumed that it propagates at infinite speed, and that is how it appears in general relativity. However, gravity is not transmitted by objects, and all clocks are massive objects. <br>  <br>  What follows is my own opinion, which is held by no one but yours truly: <br>  <br>  I believe gravity is carried by ethereal pressure waves. Waves propagating faster than light in no way causes time to go backward, and does not violate causation. <br>  <br>  In my Fractal Foam Model of Universes, there are other universes in the same place, but on vastly different scales; and the transition from one scale-wise universe to the next larger or smaller scale universe involves a time reversal. This follows logically from the idea that the ether foam of one universe is the cosmic foam of the next smaller scale universe; distance is a measure of the number of ether-foam bubbles; and expansion of space results from the popping of cosmic-foam bubbles in the next smaller-scale universe because of expansion in that universe. <br>  <br>  When a sub-universe cosmic-foam bubble wall pops, two bubbles become one, which reduces the number of sub-universe cosmic-foam bubbles; but expansion means an increase in the number of ether-foam bubbles. Therefor, a sub-universe cosmic-foam bubble popping is our universe's ether-foam bubble un-popping. The only thing that can make a bubble un-pop is reversal of time.|`|QsVMeaPXaa	No one could know if a blackhole can/could reverse time, no one/nothing survies going through a black hole.<br>  <br>  <br>  Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity (and, by extension, the General Theory) very explicitly permits a kind of time dilation that would ordinarily be called time travel. The theory holds that, relative to a stationary observer, time appears to pass more slowly for faster-moving bodies: for example, a moving clock will appear to run slow; as a clock approaches the speed of light its hands will appear to nearly stop moving. However, this effect allows "time travel" only toward the future: never backward|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	No. Gravity fields slow down time, but as far as we know they cannot make time run backwards. If you wanted to go backwards in time, you would have to either use a wormhole (and we have no idea how to actually make a wormhole at the moment), or go faster than light (which requires an infinite amount of energy).|`|XojxC4xxaa	Nope.

e8b3DBLLaa	The Circulatory System<br>  Large organisms require a transport system to distribute nutrients and oxygen and to remove wastes and CO2 from cells distributed throughout the body. Two kinds of circulatory systems accomplish this internal transport.<br>  1. Open circulatory systems pump blood into an internal cavity called a hemocoel (or cavities called sinuses), which bathe tissues with an oxygen- and nutrient-carrying fluid called hemolymph. The hemolymph returns to the pumping mechanism of the system, a heart, through holes called ostia. Open circulatory systems occur in insects and most mollusks.<br>  2. In closed circulatory systems, the nutrient-, oxygen-, and waste carrying fluid, blood, is confined to vessels. Closed circulatory systems are found among members of the phylum Annelida (earthworms, for example), certain mollusks (octopuses and squids), and vertebrates.<br>  <br>  In the closed circulatory system of vertebrates, vessels moving away from the heart are called arteries. Arteries branch into smaller vessels, the arterioles, and then branch further into the smallest vessels, the capillaries. Gas and nutrient exchange occurs by diffusion across capillary walls into interstitial fluids and into surrounding cells. Wastes and excess interstitial fluids move in the opposite direction as they diffuse into the capillaries. The blood, now deoxygenated, remains in the capillaries and returns to the heart through venules, which merge to form larger veins. The heart then pumps the deoxygenated blood to the respiratory organ (gills or lungs) where arteries again branch into a capillary bed for gas exchange. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart through veins. From here, the oxygenated blood is pumped,<br>  once again, throughout the body.

In every Messenger RNA their is a STOP codon (telling the ribsome to stop making the polypeptide chain) and once it is read, the ribosome stops the synthesis of the polypeptide chain and releases it. <br>  <br>  *note amino acids are the basic structure of what makes proteins<br>  *polypeptide chains are amino acids joined together by peptide bonds<br>  *the polypeptide chains fold after translation and make a protein|`|m7YUgPIuaa	Well, DNA is the genetic material of all cells.

I think it goes like this: the tRNA brings in the mRNA and the corresponding rRNA and connect them, then the mRNA chain continues and the process repeats.|`|TIhFAr3Yaa	First off, let me clarify that there are more than three types of RNA, there are many classes of RNA molecules, including, snRNA (small nuclear RNA), snoRNA (small nucleolar RNA), scRNA (small cytoplasmic RNA), miRNA (micro RNA), Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), small interfering RNA, etc. all of these are found in all eukaryotic cells, with the majority of them working in the cytoplasm. With the three that you mentioned, mRNA carries the genetic code for polypeptide chains from DNA to ribosome so it can be read and translated, tRNA is the link between the coding sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA and the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide chain, rRNA is where the protein is assembled but it doesn't work alone it works with ribosomal protein subunits to complete the machinery to process the instructions carried by the mRNA into an amino acid sequence. <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this answers your question.
kKTCCFsEaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  My guess is e. number of viable offspring.<br>  From my understanding Darwinian fitness is a measure of how much does an organism contribute to the gene pool. Thus the more offspring you generate the more of your genetic information contributing to the total gene pool of the community.<br>  Answers a, c, and d are practically the same. Such organisms may be stronger than its peers but if they can not pass those traits to their offspring, it does not count as fitness. Answer b may be tempting, but again the number of mating does not necessarily means that you would obtain offspring per mating (as some organism may be more fertile than other).  <br>  <br>  I hope that helps.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Eugene|`|OoxOqyvtaa	e.

8oCwrIR2aa	Honestly, there are two solutions:<br>  <br>  Find a tutor or someone who will help you that doesn't get frustrated. One that simply thinks of a second, then a third, then a fourth way to explain a thing, each one tailored closer and closer to what you understood out of the last one. The kind of person who just keeps trying until your lights go on inside.<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, that CAN happen from your own work on it. You give up on grand connections without basics and work on the basics. Then one day it all just "gels" in your head and from that moment on you never really have difficulties again. An example might be grammar. You give up on the larger picture and concentrate on really understanding nouns, then verbs, then prepositions, and so on and one day it's as if you've been re-born and grammar is your b*tch. Math can be like that too. In fact, in math it can be even easier because there are always fifty ways to do every exact thing in math and you can usually pick one you understand.<br>  <br>  But tutors who just follow along with your homework won't do it. You need to master the basics first so the tutors have to hit home on them and YOU have to accept doing your homework on your own. That sucks, but this is like trying to do a literature class in 10th grade when you never really learned to read in 1st grade and "ain't not done no better since!" You simply must master the basics, "walk before you run" as they may still say somewhere in the world, and THEN move forward.<br>  <br>  Good luck! Oh, you can ask me anything you like any time. I check stuff at least every 2-3 days, usually more often. Or not, as typing an answer is sooooo much less clear than talking and writing on paper in front of you.

You just have to find a different way of learning math so that you actually learn how to think mathematically, not just blindly try to memorize and regurgitate a bunch of actions.  You should know what you're doing and why it works.  Drag out the text book and read it starting from the first chapter.<br>  <br>  Whenever this sort of question comes up, I usually see a bunch of people advising to "practice" above everything else.

If you don't get what a teacher or a tutor is trying to explain to you, they may just be explaining it in a style that doesn't work so well for you.  Sometimes, the best help can be from someone who also struggled to get it, rather than someone who breezed through.<br>  <br>  Remember, you are not stupid, or you wouldn't be doing so well in your other classes.

8Cb7g5nbaa	Primeiramente vamos entender um pouco As Leis de Isaac Newton:<br>  Em 1687, Sir Isaac Newton publicou seu livro sobre as leis do movimento. A primeira lei é: um corpo em movimento continuará a se mover até que alguma for?a atue sobre ele. <br>  <br>  O oposto é verdadeiro: se um corpo está parado, continuará parado até que uma for?a atue sobre ele. Chamamos isso de inércia. <br>  A coisa que empurrou a Terra parece ter sido a Lua. Sem esse choque, a velocidade de rota??o da Terra seria muito pequena, como em Vênus, onde um dia dura um ano. <br>  <br>  Ao receber o impacto da Lua, a Terra iniciou seu movimento de rota??o. Algo é necessário para pará-la, como os freios da fric??o.<br>  O jovem Sistema Solar parecia um jogo de bilhar, com várias bolas voando por todo lado, chocando-se umas com as outras. Parece que a Lua atingiu a Terra e entrou na órbita de nosso planeta. <br>  <br>  Há 4,5 bilh?es de anos atrás a Lua acelerou a velocidade de rota??o da Terra, fazendo-a completar um dia em 24 horas. é engra?ado como uma coisa conduz à outra. Indo à Lua é que os cientistas aprenderam isso. Descobriram isso através das rochas que trouxeram. Procuraram uma coisa e acharam outra! <br>  <br>  Você sabia que a pimenta e outras especiarias foram a raz?o da descoberta de que a Terra é redonda? <br>  <br>  P.S. de Beakman: Há algo que está diminuindo a velocidade de rota??o da Terra, mas é uma for?a fraca. é o atrito causado pelas marés dos oceanos.

Then go to collage for either zoology,wildlife rehabilitation, or you can specialize in a certain kind of animal you would like to work with. But becoming a zoo keeper or just an animal keeper is alot more that just taking care of the animal,you have to be good at math so you know how much to feed them and what proportions of the types of food to give them.You also have to clean all of the poo out of the tank or enclosures,you are also have to keep the animals healthy when they are in your care.They also only make about 25 to 35 thousand per year. It all depends where you live.
iUiOLRznaa	I'm not seeing any way to do it. The most straightforward thing I could think of to figure out how it might be done was to directly substitute eq2 into eq1:<br>  <br>  (a+b)ln[a/(a+b)] = [a/(a+b)]^a = a^a/(a+b)^a<br>  <br>  ln[a/(a+b)] = a^a/(a+b)^(a+1)<br>  <br>  ln a - ln (a+b) = a^a/(a+b)^(a+1)<br>  <br>  At this point, I see no way to get an identity relationship that indicates the two equations are somehow equivalent. Clearly, "a" must be a positive number and not equal to 0, else ln(a) would not exist. Also "a+b" must be greater than zero, else ln(a+b) would not exist. Those two restrictions are enough to make the right hand side of the equation ALWAYS positive. However, since natural log is an increasing function, ln(a) - ln(a+b) will be NEGATIVE unless a+b < a. Thus, "b" must be less than 0. If a+b > 0, but b < 0, that means -a < b < 0. This restriction on the possible values of b suggests to me that the two equations are not generally equivalent, and neither can be transformed into the other, but perhaps someone else sees a way.<br>  <br>  Are you *supposed* to be able to turn one equation into the other?|`|RkTsYKvBaa	No.|`|4zXgIgh8aa	impossible
805d5aa14fdca671ed6b65dfbb2b1962aa	To slow down, the parachute must exert at least some force greater than your combined weight. Once slowed down, the chute then exerts a force equal to your total weight to maintain your constant, slow, decent velocity.|`|ssqS8ASeaa	Newton's first law:<br>  <br>  An object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion with the same speed unless acted upon by a force.<br>  <br>  If the force was equal, you would fall at the same rate because the resultant would be zero.<br>  <br>  With that, if you want to SLOW DOWN, there has to be a resultant force going UP. To have this resultant, the force exerted by the parachute on you must be greater than your weight.|`|Be69keaTaa	After the brief period of free fall you would be still accelerating downwards. Once the parachute has reduced your speed, you will no longer decelerate further and you will reach a constant downward velocity. If this velocity is small enough you will land safely.At this point the parachute force is equal to your weight. <br>  <br>  I 'm sorry Garret is right. The parachute force is initially greater than your weight in order to have a resultant force upwards. Parachute force is related to velocity, as you slow down the velocity decreases and the parachute force is reduced. Until the point where the parachute force equals your weight and then you will have a constant downward velocity.|`|dkS8XHAwaa	Well I assume you mean the force exerted AGAINST you, because the opposition force is what ultimately slows you down. But since you are still falling, the force exerted away from you is still less because gravity is still pulling you down, just at a slower velocity. In a vacuum, if it was equal, you would be at a standstill, and if it were greater, you would be flying.

OlXiJPNbaa	I have always thought about that question also. But new evidence has arisen that there was a time before the big bang and this is called the big bounce theory. Basically an implosion that triggered an explosion, due to quantum gravitational effects. So its a period in time when the universe is expanding so much that it collapses underneath itself and implodes, and then triggers an explosion, Think of it as a massive star dying and turning into a black hole its the same general idea, except for the fact that it wont turn into a massive black hole.|`|1StxSYlMaa	Big Bang is not a theory. It is a conjecture. That means they think "Well, maybe it was like this. Does this make sense?"<br>  <br>  A big bang is implied by the conjecture that galaxies farther away from us are moving away from us at speeds proportional to their distance. The distances are calculated on the conjecture that dim stars are farther away than bright stars. <br>  <br>  But what if dim stars are just dim? Then the distance calculations are wrong. And what if the red shifts are caused by electrical effects instead of motion? Then the speed calculations are wrong. Astronomers are reluctant to consider these ideas because it would throw everything they think they know into confusion and they would have to start all over, recalculating everything in the universe. But some astronomers are doing exactly that.

But that would leave you back to same question, where did the membranes come from?  <br>  <br>  Some believe that the universe will collapse again, cause mass gravitational pull, than expand "another big bang" and start all over.  <br>  <br>  If you believe in a higher being (which I do) that will still lead you to where did he come from.  <br>  <br>  I think you'll drive yourself crazy over these things.  You just have to take for granted that what you are thinking of is space-time.  In physics we use these to demonstrate laws, but time doesn't exist outside of singularity, so to speak.  It a circular flow rather than a linear one.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	It didn't explode, it was an expansion.  Like the difference between blowing up a balloon and popping it.  We're not sure where it came from in the first place - there are some good theories that are supported by the math, from the collapse of a previous universe to the collision of branes, but they aren't currently testable.  Happily, where it came from in the first place has no bearing on the outcome - the big bang doesn't depend on where it came from to be correct and supported by evidence.|`|W2suykEtaa	no idea.<br>  <br>  its a little fuzzy when you run the time-line backwards, as space collapses into a singularity and what happens to time?<br>  <br>  space and time are linked; squeeze space into a dot and time... stops?<br>  <br>  so, we need to come up with an explanation for that, too?<br>  <br>  how about this... two OTHER Universes rubbed against each other in n-space and we got a spark of static... that was us!|`|aNlT1NRqaa	The latest theory comes from String Theory & quantum mechanics. It states that before the big bang, there were just something called branes. Think of two sheets hanging on a clothesline. Two of these branes touched (sheets in a breeze), destroying each other in a giant explosion that created the universe we now live in.<br>  <br>  There's a lot of math that very few people understand, but the concept is kind of simple. Basically, the whole idea of everything in the universe being compressed to a point (big black hole) is eliminated, making a more logical solution.|`|m09snBrEaa	well the evidence we can observe only goes back to a fraction of a second after the big bang started, so we don't know about the origin of the singularity.<br>  <br>  either the universe is eternal in which case the big bang is just a stage in its existence, or its finite in which case either there exists a law allowing for something from nothing, or some sort of multiverse from which universes are created, there's also god but the only evidence presented for it's existence are arguments from ignorance like the one you are clearly avoiding in your question.|`|569a7cb7c1da8cc36ac60e88ef7c900baa	GOOD QUESTION! <br>  <br>  I have been saying the same thing for a while now and NO ONE can explain it.<br>  <br>  They continue to say the Universe expands and contracts but even if it does, what about all of the SPACE around that orb? <br>  <br>  WHAT IS THIS COLD FREEZER LIKE NOTHINGNESS THAT WE ARE HOVERING INSIDE OF?<br>  <br>  Does it expand and collapse too? Does Space become a solid thing with a death-grip around all of this Power and Force that's waiting to be unleashed? <br>  <br>  No one can answer that unless they have a WILD WILD CRAZY INSANE IMAGINATION. <br>  <br>  Even if we try to explain what's OUT THERE by observing Nature on Earth, there is really only so deep our thoughts can take us.<br>  <br>  We need to search somewhere else to explain it.

PsCCd63yaa	A fraction a/b is zero if and only if its numerator 'a' is zero, and its denominator is NOT zero.  (If the denominator is zero, it's not defined in the real number system).  Thus, in your case, setting the numerator 2x = 0 gives x = 0.  Plug x into the denominator just to be safe and make sure you don't get anything icky...which you don't, since the denominator is 1.<br>  <br>  If the question had been (x^2 + 5x + 4) / (x + 3) = 0, you could set the numerator equal to zero to get x = -3 or x = -1 after factoring.  But plugging in x=-3 into the original equation shows that you have an extraneous root, since you get 0/0.

A particle with mass takes an infinite amount of energy to approach that speed.<br>  <br>  Two quibbles with the answer above:<br>  1) You shouldn't say the mass of a particle increases with speed.  Mass is an invariant quantity.  The thing that goes up is energy.<br>  2) The word you were looking for is assymptotically, not exponentially.|`|cL6CWj2waa	short answer:<br>  <br>  because you dont argue with Einstein.<br>  <br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  long answer:<br>  <br>  light itself can go the speed of light, theoretically in a vacuum, this is a fact for sure. <br>  <br>  since light is emmited from atoms of energy/radiation , light is a manifestation of energy , no mystery there, light is visible energy<br>  <br>  since this manifestation of energy has a speed limit, 286,000 miles/sec, then what is going to accelerate it faster ?<br>  <br>  energy ? light just came from this energy , so there is nothing that goes faster than light|`|bDUNBvKbaa	Because, for reasons rooted in Einsteinien mechanics, accelerating an object towards the speed of light cause that object to become more massive. The amount of energy needed to accelerate the same object  by the same amount increases exponentially as you approach the speed of light, so the faster you go, the harder it is to move faster and faster. Consequently, very close to the speed of light, the object will become infinitely massive, requiring an infinite amount of energy to accelerate it further. This is why particle accelerators suck huge amounts of power but are still only able to accelerate very, very tiny particles to 99.999% of the speed of light.

MzqZGvalaa	Technically there is a difference between an autopsy and a post-mortem examination.  An autopsy is the examination of a dead body to uncover the cause of death. It's performed when someone dies unexpectedly, or when a young person dies.  It can also be part of a criminal investigation. A post-mortem is just an examination of a dead body, it could be for learning or teaching purposes or for a couple of other boring medical reasons.  Not that it really comes up much in lay conversation!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	after death -ask her what the bag is for.|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	Confused by two things.  <br>  1.

Equation of KL:  y = 0 <br>   <br>  A1 = (KL) ∫ ydx = (0,2) ∫ 0dx = 0<br>  <br>  2. Equation of LM:  x=1, dx = 0<br>   <br>  A2 = (LM) ∫ ydx = (1,1) ∫ y*0 = 0<br>  <br>  3. Equation of MN:  y = 1, x from 2 to 1<br>   <br>  A3 = (MN) ∫ ydx = (2,1) ∫ dx = 1 - 2 = -1<br>  <br>  4. Equation of NK:  y = x,  x from 1 to 0<br>   <br>  A4 = (NK) ∫ ydx = (1,0) ∫ xdx = x2/2 (1, 0) = <br>  <br>  = 0 - 1/2 = -1/2.<br>  <br>  And as area is always positive then the<br>  total area<br>  T = |  A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 | = 1.5

8vshPwOPaa	awwww haha<br>  <br>  yea i know, the thought of the world ending freaks me out too kiddo BUT! <br>  ya know what? it wont...<br>  <br>  here's some factual reasons why...<br>  <br>  ok, incase you didnt know, all this hype about the world ending in 2012 comes from an ancient native american civilization's calendars that stop recording things that are supposed to happen...it stops in the year 2012. there is no reason given as to WHY the calendar stops there...it just does. there arent instructions written on it that say "this is the end of the world". it just stops...like they got tired of writing or something. the calendar is thousands of years old and why it went on for the thousands of years it did no one knows why. <br>  I know 3 different people who have family that live on indian reservations in the united states. all 3 are different "tribes" i guess you could call them. idk the names of them cause i dont really care to ask lol (rude i know, but not what we're talking about).<br>  <br>  what i've come to realize is that all the native american cultures...or TRIBES...have their own calendars. they all go on for thousands of years and end at different times because no1 can write a calendar that goes on forever. there are ancient calendars found on the other hemisphere of the globe whose dates have already ran out....and we're all still here<br>  <br>  NEXT...<br>  some people say indians could see into the future.<br>  ESPECIALLY THESE INDIANS<br>  . <br>  well, I'm no expert on what indian this little calendar is based off of...<br>  I've heard it's the Aztecs and I've heard it's the Mayans.<br>  I dont know anything about Mayan culture except that it was tied to the Aztecs because the Aztecs were bad asses and ruled the Mayans.<br>  <br>  Last semester (im in college) i had to write a huge paper on Hernando Cortez. Hernando Cortez conquered these indians for the crown of spain.<br>  <br>  There's a bit of irony to the story of Cortez though...<br>  <br>  The Aztecs had a prophecy that one day the king of the gods would return to them and bring ever lasting peace and prosperity to the Aztecs. He was gonna make crops grow real good and make everyone rich and things were gonna be great! The aztecs predicted he'd come from a specific direction from the ocean <br>  (like coming in from the west coast or coming in from the east coast)<br>  and that his skin would be shiny and unbreakable and that he would arrive with other, lesser gods but ones that were like him. <br>  they EVEN had a specific year that this was supposed to happen....<br>  <br>  well...if you want to know something funny about history...<br>  about the same time that this god king was supposed to return to the aztecs Hernando Cortez, who was just a man, and his army of Spanish knights (who were men, not gods) arrived from the same direction in the ocean as the god king and his entourage were supposed to come from. oh, and they had shiny metal skin on too....only today i think you'd call it body armor, like a knight wears. <br>  <br>  Hernando Cortez killed the chief of the Aztecs, took over the city for a while, robbed the entire city of most of it's gold, his army killed and raped thousands of civilians, they spread disease to which there was no resistance because the aztec people never encountered things like small pox. The aztec culture was almost wiped out, wiped out like EXTINCT because of Cortez.<br>  and guess what? Cortez just decided to leave and go back to spain because he got everything he wanted and the king of Spain gave him a medal for it and a title and alot of money.<br>  <br>  no Aztec indian god showed up to save the indians and stop cortez.<br>  <br>  if the indians could predict the future, they should've saw that coming.<br>  <br>  as for the rest of the indians and native americans...they should've seen the european invaders coming to steal the land you and me now live in for ourselves. but they didn't. cause in reality....they're just a bunch of stupid indians that ran around naked throwing tomahawks at people. <br>  <br>  you have nothing to be afriad of. 2012 is just another year and all the information i've given you is available on google. <br>  <br>  if you're STILL worried about the end of the world, no one knows when that's gonna happen. the best thing you can do, whether your religious or not is go to confession at church and then if the world really does end at least you'll go to heaven. <br>  <br>  but the worlds gonna keep on going, relax and dont see that stupid movie it's just gonna freak you out.|`|4Um6yfhdaa	I am with you up to a point, however, even if the world does end then, the real question is, who cares?

On the winter solstice in 2012, the sun will be aligned with the center of the Milky Way for the first time in about 26,000 years. This means that "whatever energy typically streams to Earth from the center of the Milky Way will indeed be disrupted on 12/21/12 at 11:11 p.m. Universal Time," Joseph writes.<br>  <br>  But scholars doubt the ancient Maya extrapolated great meaning from anticipating the alignment — if they were even aware of what the configuration would be. <br>  <br>  Astronomers generally agree that "it would be impossible the Maya themselves would have known that," says Susan Milbrath, a Maya archaeoastronomer and a curator at the Florida Museum of Natural History. What's more, she says, "we have no record or knowledge that they would think the world would come to an end at that point."<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about it.

The Greco-Roman civilization equivalent is the dawning of <br>  <br>  the Age of Aquarius, which happened 41 years ago (??). 13,000 years from 2012, the sun will <br>  <br>  align with the center of the Milky Way galaxy on the summer solstice in the northern <br>  <br>  hemisphere, as long as the Earth's orbital parameters remain approximately the same. The only <br>  <br>  other thing that is predicted to happen in 2012 is that solar activity for solar activity cycle 24 <br>  <br>  will be at a maximum.<br>  <br>  The Mayan - Aztec sun-stone calendar is round. A round calendar cannot end.<br>  <br>  Ok. I'll try to explain a little more. Remember, this is important because it happens at a WINTER SOLSTICE in the northern hemipshere. The Sun will align within 1 degree of the center of the Milky Way Galaxy on a winter solstice as predicted by the Mayans. There is a radio star call Sagitarius A*, usually abbreviated Sag A*, at -6 degrees declination on the celestial sphere. Sag A* is not AT the center of the Milky Way galaxy. There is a 30 million solar mass black hole, a dimensional singulairty AT the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Anything else AT the center goes down the black hole, which is NOT made of the densenst material known. If you want to look toward the center of the Milky Way galaxy, go outside in mid August abhout half an hour after sunset. Look to the south. The Constellation Sagitarius has a famous asterism known as "The Teapot". Wait until it almost completely dark and you might be able to see the Milky Way running from Sagitarius through the Summer Trinage of the bright stars <br>  Altair in Aquila, Vega in Lyra, (which is straight overhead at sunset in mid-August), and Deneb in Cygnus, which is also known as the Northern Cross.<br>  Source(s):|`|QKO4f5q0aa	I'm not going to type it all out for the 1*10^n-th time.

xIisVcLTaa	Well without knowing what your function looks like this will be kind of tricky. Also without knowing where you're coming from in terms of physics will make it tricky.<br>  <br>  in general, you have p(x)dx, which is defined as the probability that some value chosen at random will be between x and x + dx. This is a probability density. The integral over all space of p(x)dx then, must be 1 (a chosen value has to be somewhere). <br>  <br>  To be more general, say you have some function Psi(x, t) (I'm assuming you might be dealing with quantum mechanics). The probability density, then is <br>  <br>  Psi(x,t)*Psi(x,t)  -or-   (|Psi(x,t)|^2)dx <br>  that is, complex conjucate of your function times your function. It yields a probability density, once again representing the chance that the particle is between a chosen x and x + dx.<br>  <br>  Generally, to go from there and find out what this means in terms of probability of energy states, you need to do things like normalize your wave function and find the energy eigenvalues. Again, assuming you are dealing with quantum mechanics.

xIisVcLTaa	(a) The tension is the person's apparent weight.<br>  <br>  Since they accelerate upward, they feel "heavier", that is the acceleration adds to that of gravity. <br>  <br>  so let a = (9.8 + 0.7)m/s^2 = 10.5m/s^2<br>  <br>  then Force = T = ma = 75kg * 10.5m/s^2 = 787.5N<br>  <br>  (b) The tension in the cable is doing positive work, as it points upward along the direction of motion. <br>  <br>  W = Fd cos (theta). Since the tension is parallel to the direction of movement, we can just say W = Fd. We are told d = 11m<br>  <br>  W = 787.5N*11m =  8662.5J<br>  <br>  (c) The persons weight opposes the direction of the motion, However it is not equal in magnitude to the Tension, because there is an acceleration. The weight is then just mg, 75kg*9.8m/s^2 = 735N.<br>  The distance is the same so<br>  <br>  W = 735N*11m = 8085J<br>  <br>  (d) The work energy theorem states that W = delta(KE)<br>  <br>  But, the net work done is the work done by the tension less the work done by the persons weight. We can check this afterwards using kinematics since conveniently we know the acceleration. <br>  <br>  Wnet =  (8662.5 - 8085)J =  577.5J<br>  <br>  The person is lifted from rest so delta(KE) = KE final - KE initial = KE final<br>  Wnet = delta(KE) => 577.5 = 1/2mv^2,   v = 3.924m/s<br>  <br>  check w/  vf^2 = vo^2+ 2ad => vf^2 = 2(0.7)(11) => vf = 3.924m/s, so we're good.

They're trying to project a higher-dimensional phenomenon into fewer dimensions so you can visualize it, and you lose something in translation.<br>  <br>  The model is that space is curved in the presence of energy in the sense that the shortest distance between two points is not what seems to us to be a straight line.  So any particle not under the influence of any forces other than gravity will follow this "shortest" distance path--a straight line in a curved space that appears to us to be a path deflected by the gravitational force.<br>  <br>  Maybe a better analogy is to imagine a particle moving over the surface of the earth.  It goes from point A to point B by the shortest possible path--a great circle path.  But if you look at a Mercatur projection map, such a path appears curved.<br>  <br>  So its like we're taking our measurements on the flat map, but gravity curves space into a curved surface like the earth, so particles that travel in straight lines on the curved space seem to us to be curving.|`|xbma9SuWaa	Mass (or its equivalent) causes space time to deform.These two things exsisting is a sign that gravity exist.

You've illustrated the huge weakness in the analogy, namely, that it's JUST an analogy.  In Einstein's picture, matter itself is what causes the curvatures in spacetime that we experience as the gravitational force.  No other force is involved.

This synchronization means that for an observer at a fixed location on Earth, a satellite in a geosynchronous orbit returns to exactly the same place in the sky at exactly the same time each day. In principle, any orbit with a period equal to the Earth's rotational period is technically geosynchronous, however, the term is often used to refer to the special case of a geosynchronous orbit that is circular (or nearly circular) and at zero (or nearly zero) inclination, that is, directly above the equator. This is customarily called a geostationary orbit.<br>  <br>  A semisynchronous orbit has an orbital period of 0.5 sidereal days, i.e. 11 h 58 min. Relative to the Earth's surface it has twice this period, and hence appears to go around the Earth once every day.

8CGOfmk3aa	Oils containing omega 3 is good for your because these fatty acids have many carbon double bonds. Hence, it creates many kinks which allows the oil to be liquid at room temperature. This fats are found especially in fish, which live in cold-water. If you think about it, if at such a cold temperature an oil is able to remain liquid inside a fish, what benefits would it have in humans? Fish oil, containing omega 3, can help stimulate blood circulation, increase the breakdown of fibrin, and can help reduce blood pressure.<br>  <br>  The large portion of the diet of an Eskimo is whale blubber, which is high in omega 3 fatty acids. As a result, health problems such as cancer or heart disease is almost unknown to these people.

This gets rid of the radical.<br>  3) Repeat these steps until there are no more radicals left.<br>  4) You'll most likely end up with a simple algebraic equation, or a quadratic equation, which you can then solve<br>  5) And here's the step a lot of people forget: CHECK to see that your answers will still work in the original problem.

snZ7z3DLaa	Hello Bella, like you I have a similar situation going on (I woke up twice with numerous marks on my back, I somehow got in a upright position while sleeping at 3:00-4:00ish in the morning and I woke up, it fell as if I fell onto my bed (Possible leviation) and then my neck did this crazy spasm (No it was not sleep paralysis, you cannot move your body in sleep paralysis, I could have very well ran out of my home, I was just too stunned and scared) this happened twice so far, every single morning I wake up (Even after a full night's sleep) with no energy as if I am ill. We have had every wall in our home bang at intervals of threes (I suppose it was mocking the Holy Trinity), I took a shower once and the entire room smelled from what people have described to be sulfer, and I could make this list go on but I'd never get to answer your question. I have asked numerous questions about possession and people seem to say that you would know. Personally I feel as if I'm changing into an entirely different person and I say some things involutnarily (No I don't not have Tourettes and I am not Schizophrenic, I have no blank spaces in my memory so I don't think Schizophrenia would be possible). I like to think that I'm not possessed but what that person described as partial position, if it can actually happen, that might be the case. I don't know about you (maybe if you posted more details) but I personally think a demon tried to possess my body when the neck spasm incident occured.. (I have accepted the Holy Spirit to I suppose that it could have gotten into me for like a minute or so, but the the Holy Spirit kicked it out) that happened twice then marks appeared on my body in places that are for the most part unreachable (center of my back) and if I "scratched" myself in my sleep I would have woken up, they were DEEP scratches. Supposedly if you touched silver and you were possessed it should burn you, and if you touch Holy Water it should have an adverse effect. I am personally afraid to tell my parents about these events because (1) It would probably shock them and (2) my mom only witnessed every wall in our house banging at intervals of threes and it scared her to death. I'm not really sure how to answer your question but if there is anything in personal you would like to know just ask me.|`|24H5tznkaa	There is a such thing as partial possession and it happens more often than total possession (which is rare) and it can be a lot less detectable. <br>  <br>  Normally partially possession can happen due to trauma of the crown chakra. That can happen from different things, one way is drug use and/or excessive drinking coupled with spiritual activities. Some prescription medications also 'blast open' the crown chakra, which could allow partial possession. Head injuries is another way.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I don't know if what you are experiencing is partial possession or if you are just being bothered by a negative entity. <br>  <br>  Either way, I'll give you some advice on things that can help. <br>  <br>  There is a Celtic Goddess named Brigid. Later, she was turned into a Saint by the Catholics. She is the female equivalent of Archangel Michael. Brigid has the ability to remove all darkness from one's surroundings and their body. She is very powerful and loving. <br>  <br>  Do you have any Irish or Scottish in your family line? Do you like and feel connected to the Fairies? I am asking because I normally mention Archangel Michael to people but in your case, I think that you are more spiritually connected to Brigid.  <br>  <br>  Here are a couple of chants/prayers that I think will help you. Call on Bridget and ask for her assistance and then say these two chants:<br>  <br>  1st:<br>  <br>  I call upon the strength of the Earth,<br>  The vitality of the Sun,<br>  And the life force within me!<br>  Power flows through my body.<br>  It purges and purifies all that is harmful.<br>  It imbues every cell of my body with radiant health.<br>  Strength and beauty shine through me.<br>  I honor my body.<br>  I shape my body.<br>  I nourish my body with good food and good thoughts.<br>  My mind and body are in harmony,<br>  And I shall be whole and healthy!<br>  So it is, and so shall it be!<br>  <br>  2nd:<br>  <br>  <br>  Brighid can also be called upon to provide a blanket of protection through a shielding ritual, after having cast a magick circle and having invoked the Goddess. Visualize the creation of a full-body shield around you, and pray to the Goddess, as follows: <br>  <br>  Blessed Lady Brighid,<br>  Loving mother, protectress and warrioress,<br>  Whose energies blaze with the heat of the sacred fire,<br>  I ask that a part of your divine essence<br>  Now enter and remain in my shield,<br>  That I may carry with me always<br>  The sacred protection of your loving care.<br>  Help this shield to deflect <br>  The ill-will of my enemies<br>  And others who wish me harm<br>  Both physically and psychologically.<br>  Be my shield and my strength,<br>  My comfort in times of need.<br>  Wrap your loving arms around me<br>  Through the power of this shield.<br>  Enter it now!<br>  <br>  Take a salt bath to remove any negative residue from your body. Whenever you feel afraid, repeat the second chant or simply call on Bridget for strength and protection.<br>  <br>  Everything happens for a reason, even negative things. I truly hope that you will try my advice, no harm can possibly come from it and you may find it to be a truly empowering experience for yourself.<br>  <br>  Brightest Blessings to you! *hugs*<br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  <br>  When people think of possession, they think of one not being in control of their body and a demon is basically acting in their place. This is very, very rare. A person can be suffering from partial possession and feel as if someone is sharing their body or that something is trying to break them down from the inside out. More and more, they feel like they are not themselves...or that they are becoming someone else. They are very aware of what is happening and they are still able to function. It is true that we are in control of our bodies and it is our personal space and we have a right to it but sometimes our built in protection barrier gets damaged. When that happens, we should call on help from higher beings and rebuild our protection.|`|380b53c18cfb9588bad18dd0f231a984aa	Generally, obsession precedes possession.  If you are obsessing about diet, grades, ghosts, Bella, etc., that could in turn permit possesion, aka negative influence.<br>  <br>  "Skitsos" (great pun) are unfortunately not free of possession, i.e. beyond conflicted self.<br>  <br>  So, someone such as yourself could be "skitso," and also unfortunately susceptible to unwanted influence.  Medicating "skitso" unfortunately too often has side effects, and even facilitates further negative, astral influence.<br>  <br>  If you are able to sense auras, etc., your consciousness is already more finely tuned and/or open to alternative plane energies.<br>  <br>  For example, unless you are asking for God's protection while your body sleeps, you might be enangered by susceptibilities in your even more open dream state  It is possible you would be influenced to injure yourself.<br>  <br>  What is recommended is perhaps monitoring of your situation, re extremes of depression, bipolar symptoms, self-aggression, etc.  However, imo it would be less constructive to seek medication immediately.  Rather, give yourself a regular schedule of gardening, nature walks, etc.  These kinds of activities are shown in studies to be more effective in reducing depression, etc., than medication.<br>  <br>  Counseling might be a second choice.  Talk with your parents, with your pastor, with your school counselor, not particularly about possession issues, but about more practical issues:  grades, vocation, romance, etc.  If and when you are handling these reasonably well, then any sources driving your extreme sleep behavior will either diminish, or come to the calmer surface,  At that time, seeking counseling for them in the latter case would be good,<br>  <br>  Here's a number with licensed counseling 24/7:  1-800-525-Love.  <a href="http://www.klove.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.klove.com</a> is their general website.<br>  <br>  A second counseling resource:  1-800-232-6459, call during business hours M-F, ask for Counseling dept., they'll set up a time to call you when it's convenient for your schedule.  They have local counselors who are conservative in prescribing meds.<br>  <br>  It is quite possible you have some personal issues, some personal sensitivity, and perhaps some unwanted energies taking advantage of the first two dynamics.<br>  <br>  "Emotions," Marilyn C.

I moved to a house in North Dakota that was very old and abandoned. I would always feel something behind me when I walked up the steps. I am 12 years old and I hail from North Carolina. I don't mean to frighten you, but I do think ghosts and spirits exist. If this is bothering you so much, tell your family, a councelor, or anybody you feel safe with. Even though you are thirteen, have your brother, sister, or even one of your parents stay in bed with you. My mother spent the night with me, and it made me feel a lot better. But, after she saw a shadow, we moved out of the house immediately. This was two years ago, and I have not had any more paranormal experiences. So, to answer your question, you need to tell someone, and even tell whatever is interested in you in a firm and demanding voice to leave you alone immediately. If you have any further questions, I would love to hear them.

I see aura's, so I know how hard it is. There really is no good place to discuss this and there is no one immediate person who could ever understand nearby. Its hard.<br>  All I can do is suggest that you go to a spiritual leader of some sort~ a priest or a Indian Shaman, whom ever you can relate to. <br>  You could also say a prayer for protection.<br>  Example:<br>  In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I command a hedge of protection to be around my home and property today and I ask that warrior angels would be placed to stand guard at any holes that might be in that hedge.(*ie. sin, weakness, trauma et...)<br>  In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I command any free, unbound, or wandering spirits to get out beyond that hedge of protection now.<br>  In the name of Jesus Christ, I ask that warrior angels be placed at the doorways and access points to my home and property today. I ask that warrior angels that would bind and separate from their functions and demons attached to any individuals entering my home and property today.(*an access point could be the internet, tv or electricals)<br>  Father God, I ask for a spiritual umbrella of protection over me and a spiritual hedge of protection around me. I place the full armour of God on me and I ask that the light of the Lord Jesus shine through me this day.<br>  <br>  You must sleep, if you don't you will be weak and even more vulnerable to attacks. They feed on fear, anger, and hate.<br>  Stay positive, use your imagery and focus on LOVE!<br>  GO TO BED!|`|Jn1aExonaa	Sorry to hear about that!<br>  But the possessed never ask themselves if they are possessed so personally i don't think that you are possessed.

It is an interesting phenomena, that the the more we believe something, the more our minds go out of their way to make excuses for it when sorting through things logically. It's very easy to see things that would otherwise have been ignored as paranormal phenomena. If you have had suspicions of paranormal activity for long enough, it starts to have a negative effect on you too, and small things start to look and feel bigger than they really are. It's like the Placebo effect. If you think you are sick, you go to the doctor's. If the doctor tells you that you are fine, the symptoms start to alleviate, but if he tells you that you are very sick, you immediately feel worse. Same principle really. My best advice is to spend some more time outdoors,with other people , and enjoying your life. Once you start forgetting the whole possessed thing, all the symptoms you have mentioned (especially the one about the lack of energy) will lift. It's worth a try at least...|`|usIma0vIaa	SIGNS THAT YOU ARE UNDER DEMONIC POSSESSION<br>  Mental Changes Affecting The Person<br>  1 Look for changes in personality.

Excessive masturbation or doing it in front of others.<br>  <br>  18 Take note of what appears to be a different personality or multiple personalities.<br>  <br>  19 Look for unusual changes in diet. Foods that were once favorites may now be repulsive to the person. They may eat foods that they once detested.<br>  <br>  20 Take note if they seem to have blackouts in their memory.<br>  <br>  The above items can well be psychiatric or psychological changes; therefore, you must be wary when you look at these as signs of possession. All of the above can be cries for help or signal the beginning of drug use or mental illness. When these are the only things present, seek psychological counseling first, before even giving thought to the possibility of demonic possession. Many of these changes are normal, especially when dealing with teenagers. Do not automatically think of possession unless you have some reason to believe they are vulnerable to possession. For example, if they have been performing rituals or dabbling in the occult and then you start noticing personality changes. However, the likelihood is that it is a natural problem, natural being psychiatric or psychological. <br>  <br>  As you will see, there are many other indications of possession. Look for some of those before you give credence to the idea of possession. In addition, never mention to someone undergoing personality changes that they might be possessed. You can plant a dangerous seed by doing that. <br>  <br>  Physical Changes Affecting The Person<br>  <br>  1 The person involved may go for long periods of time without blinking their eyes. (Can indicate a neurological condition)<br>  <br>  2 The person may appear catatonic. (Can also be a sign of mental illness)<br>  <br>  3 The person speaks a language they could not possibly know. (Or speak English with unusual accents.)<br>  <br>  4 The person speaks in tongues. <br>  <br>  5 The person will become completely rigid where they cannot be moved at all, even by multiple people.<br>  <br>  6 Look for changes in the eyes.

It may go from high to low to guttural. <br>  <br>  13 They may be able to tell what you are thinking.<br>  <br>  14 They may move in some unusual way. For example, they may seem to glide instead of walk.<br>  <br>  15 Writing or symbols may appear on the body in the form of welts and scratches. Look especially in areas they could not reach.<br>  <br>  16 They may levitate.<br>  <br>  17 Hair or eye color may change. <br>  <br>  18 There may be multiple voices coming from the person at the same time.<br>  <br>  19 Take note if animals appear to be frightened of the person, especially if they begin acting fearful when there are personality changes in the person.<br>  <br>  A couple of these symptoms can be related to medical or psychological conditions but most of them fall outside the realm of science. If you start to see a few items in this category, there is serious cause for concern. At this point, you start to take items from the first category and see if they are consistent with items from things in this second category, or the third one I am about to detail.

8CGOfmk3aa	A chylomicron is a lipoprotein that helps transport fats from the small intestine, through the circulation, and into cells. Basically, it is fat with a coated layer of protein.   This is so that the fat/protein combination is able to travel in the blood stream, which is water based (fats+water=don't mix well).  It's important for digestion because without it, fats would not be able to absorbed into the circulation and sent to tissues or organs that need the fats.|`|dY6HroZ3aa	It is small fat globule composed of protein and lipid (fat). Chylomicrons are found in the blood and lymphatic fluid where they serve to transport fat from its port of entry (intestine) to the liver and to adipose (fat) tissue. After a fatty meal, the blood is so full of chylomicrons that it looks milky
RvuKTT0Jaa	Refraction can be seen when looking into a cup/glass of water. Air has a refractive index of about 1.0003, and water has a refractive index of about 1.33. If a person looks at a straight object, such as a pencil or straw, which is placed at a slant, partially in the water, the object appears to bend at the water's surface. This is due to the bending of light rays as they move from the water to the air. Once the rays reach the eye, the eye traces them back as straight lines (lines of sight). The lines of sight intersect at a higher position than where the actual rays originated. This causes the pencil to appear higher and the water to appear shallower than it really is. The depth that the water appears to be when viewed from above is known as the apparent depth. This is an important consideration for spearfishing from the surface because it will make the target fish appear to be in a different place, and the person must therefore aim lower to catch the fish.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Water breaks light / bends it - thereby giving the impression an object is in a slightly different position.<br>  <br>  Look at birds that catch fish - they never go straigh to the apparent location, but compensate for the bending of the light...|`|xIisVcLTaa	This happens because of refraction. <br>  <br>  Different media have different index's of refraction, which basically means they tell light how much to slow down (or speed up if going from more dense to less dense media). <br>  <br>  For the case of a glass of water, water has a higher index of refraction than air, so light enters and bends "towards the normal" as we like to say.<br>  <br>  Because of this, the position of an object below when viewed from above is skewed because the light rays are bent some amount which is a function of the depth of the water. The apparent position of the object is then different from the actual position of the object.|`|YBaEwgFuaa	Hey<br>  coins/objects appear in different positions (when in a cup/glass and covered with water) because water is denser than air, and light will travel slower through the water.

g44nZlCTaa	There may be more than one recipe, so be aware.  It's been a long time since I extracted theobromine.  <br>  <br>  I don't remember the exact recipe, but I'll tell you what I remember and how to do it outside of a lab.  <br>  <br>  Dissolve the cocoa powder in methanol in one or more sealed mason jars.  (You can get pure methanol at a car parts store.)  Let it steep for a couple weeks, shaking the jar(s) vigourously at least once per day.<br>  <br>  Using a buchner funnel, filter flask, filter paper, and a vacuum pump, separate the  liquid from the solids.  <br>  <br>  In a shed or outdoor environment, put the liquid in an evaporation dish (pyrex baking dish) over a heating pad to evaporate the methanol.  If it is warm outside, forget the heating pad.  The heating pad should be modified so that there is no switch on it (don't want the spark) and a to give it a very long cord, so that the fumes of the methanol will not be around where you plug it in.<br>  <br>  CAUTION: Do NOT evaporate methanol near a heat source hotter than a heating pad.  NEVER heat methanol in a glass carafe in a coffee maker.  This is how idiots blow themselves up.  Never evaporate methanol in an area where there is a spark (even a light switch), and definitely DON'T have a flame nearby.<br>  <br>  Once the solution is mostly evaporated and is gummy, scrape the residue together in one mass with a razor blade and let dry fully.  <br>  <br>  Once fully dry, it can then be ground up in a mortar and pestle.  This is now a dry methyl extract of cocoa.  It will contain significant levels of methyltheobromine (the stuff you want), among smaller amounts of other assorted alkaloids. There are ways to separate the various alkaloids using acids, but unless you want to have pure methyltheobromine, I wouldn't bother.<br>  <br>  But please use common sense, and if you can find a recipe, use it instead of experimenting with methanol. <br>  <br>  And, btw, there isn't much difference between methyltheobromine and caffeine sulfate, so someone could just take some caffeine pills if they wanted.<br>  <br>  And if you want to cheat, pure methyltheobromine is readily available at most chemical stores.

QJ5Lh3wUaa	In natural selection,  the traditional way of looking at things is that the most important unit to consider are organisms.  Organisms with helpful traits tend to reproduce more, organisms with damaging traits tend to die off ("survival of the fittest").... and thus over time helpful heritable traits tend to predominate, and organisms become adapted to their environment.  <br>  <br>  The Selfish Gene, promoted by Richard Dawkins (and others), is simply a differnet way of looking at things.  He looks at it from the point of view of individual genes.  He says that those genes (rather than organisms) that produce traits that allow them to reproduce themselves will tend to predominate over time, and organisms are just the means of genes reproducing themselves.<br>  <br>  Mostly I think it is simply a different way of looking at things.  However, there is one major point of scientific contention - the selective unit - The Selfish Gene talks about selection on the basis of individual genes - but genes don't reproduce, organisms do (and additionally organisms interact and are parts of a population).  Read the wikipedia link for philosophical, etc. criticisms too.|`|GeL1uwYmaa	Gene theory says that all genetic material is composed of genes & this genetic material is specific for all species & carries information from parents to offsprings generation after generation|`|a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	Simply put, rather than looking at evolution from the standpoint of the organisms being successful if they reproduce, look at the genes as successful if there are more copies of them.

zFsTSrOcaa	Evolution doesn't operate at the level of the cell or the individual organism, it works on populations.  All individual members of a species have slightly different assortments of genes.  If a set of genes gives an individual a survival advantage in its environment, those genes are more likely to be passed on to the next generation.  On the other hand, an individual with genes conferring a survival disadvantage is less likely to survive and pass its genes on.  In short, "helpful" genes are preserved while "harmful" genes are eliminated.  Over thousands of generations, these small genetic changes add up, so that the far-off descendants of the original population may look nothing like their ancestors and be sufficiently different to be considered a separate species.|`|vIhgjb9paa	Easy, but I am not a biologist.  <br>  <br>  Philosophically, I would suggest that anything capable of feeling pain and pleasure would maximise pleasure and minimise pain.

It's driven by random variation, and guided by natural selection.  Random changes and gene distributions create variability within a population, then selective pressures weed out the variants that aren't suited to the environment.  This leaves those who *are* well-adapted able to pass on their genes.<br>  <br>  Take antibiotic resistance, in bacteria.  If you take a sample of E. coli, place it on a petri dish, and let it grow for a while, you'll end up with a wide variety of genes within the population.  Then you treat the plate with an antibiotic, like ampicillin in the right amount (enough to kill most cells, but not such an overdose that it obliterates everything).  <br>  <br>  You'll be left with a plate containing a few ampicillin-resistant bacteria.  They didn't see a need to resist ampicillin, they simply had that trait by chance, and selection resulted in their survival.  Once they are able to re-populate the plate, you'll have a whole plate full of ampicillin-resistant bacteria - because they were the only ones to survive and pass on their genes.<br>  <br>  Of course, this is a very simple example, and illustrates very slight evolution in a single gene over the span of a few days (which would be many generations for bacteria).  When you apply it to more complex traits in plants and animals (involving many different genes, and with a much slower generation time) you can see why even small changes take so long.  Also, most evolution in the wild doesn't follow these black-and-white live-or-die rules... rather, the fittest have a higher chance of survival, and therefore a higher chance of passing on their genes (meaning, statistically, beneficial genes will become more common in the population).|`|QJ5Lh3wUaa	That is the Lamarkian theory of evolution. It was largely rejected by scientists, for exactly that reason (no mechanism) well over 100 years ago (although oddly it was popular in the USSR until the 1940s because it fit with Soviet ideology)....  it was rejected even before scientists knew about genes and DNA.<br>  <br>  The modern theory of evolution is known as the "modern synthesis".  it combines natural selection (Darwin's idea) with Mendelian genetics.<br>  <br>  In natural selection, children are on the whole similar to their parents, but they also include random variations -- the variations are *entirely* random. The helpful variations tend to become more common over time, but the damaging ones tend to get eliminated.  <br>  <br>  Here is an another explanation from my article (link below)<br>  <br>  Although of course there are many details and fine points behind the idea of natural selection, the basic idea behind it is beautifully simple. It begins with the observation that children tend to be similar to their parents. From that observation one can state that whatever heritable traits are better at helping organisms to survive and reproduce will tend to become more common in a population, whereas harmful heritable traits will gradually become less and less common. Of course, random changes to heritable traits ("mutations") may also occur, but these too will tend to become or less common depending on whether they are helpful or harmful. Finally, when we consider the immense age of the Earth, this provides enough time for the accumulation of tiny improvements in beneficial heritable traits to produce a great variety of different organisms - in fact all life on Earth.|`|ORbFRn4oaa	A very good question indeed.<br>  <br>  Not just that, I cannot figure out the percise aim of cells when I look at different organs of the body. <br>  <br>  Take the case of the eye, <br>  <br>  1-  It Focuses objects.<br>  2-  It regulates the light on its receptors.<br>  3-  The image on the retina is inverted, yet the brain knows that it has to invert the inverted image to get the correct orientation.<br>  <br>  Just TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !!! !!!!!! much of intelligence and precision in objective, to be expected out of Cells and natural selection (so called).|`|jHWEEZmCaa	biology is not as exact as physics and chemistry, but don't put hope on that. genes are responsible for the changes, that can come by chance. if god is whispering to the cells, then how do you explain extinct creatures that couldn't adapt, did god trick them! or may be was it the devil!|`|9jo37B3saa	This link provides the answer of your question.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/arguments.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/a...</a>|`|aaC2Qx1Uaa	Do you mean "how do cells evolve?" or "how has evolution produced organisms with cells which have the ability to adapt?"<br>  <br>  If it is the former, then cells don't evolve, in the same way that individual organisms don't evolve; it is *populations* of organisms which evolve. And they do so by natural selection.<br>  <br>  If it is the latter, then the ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions is an advantage, and is coded for by genetic traits. Therefore this ability is open to evolutionary change, like every other genetic trait.<br>  <br>  PS (in response to Shah):<br>  The Irrecucible Complexity idea has a few flaws. Primarily, it is an "Argument from Personal Incredulity". Basically, it says "I don't understand how [feature x] evolved, therefore no-one will ever understand how [feature x] evolved, therefore it didn't evolve."<br>  So, you can see it just displays a lack of imagination (especially since all features so far suggested as irreducibly complex have been demonstrated to not be) as well as a staggering intellectual arrogance on the part of the arguer (as they suppose if they cannot conceive of a mechanicm, then no-one ever will).|`|a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	Evolution is not driven by necessity.  Cell replication is not perfect.  Some offspring get a better set of genes than others.  That is variation.  If the environment changes, what is better or worse may change.  Those variations that fare best over time accrue.  That is natural selection of favorable variations -- evolution.

qtuaCHetaa	heyheyfuff,<br>  <br>  his looks to be This will probably not be easy to do, since I can't draw on this program.  We can try to start with a picture of a pH titration curve, and adapt it to your problem....<br>  <br>  Given the pKa of 5.95, this will look equivalent to a curve for the titration of a weak acid with a strong base, only displaced since you started in the middle of the titration having the mixture of HX and X-.  Look at <a href="http://www.chemguide.co.uk/physical/acidbaseeqia/phcurves.html," rel="nofollow">http://www.chemguide.co.uk/physical/acid...</a> and scroll down about half-way (search for "Running alkali into the acid").  This is basically how the shape of your curve will look, but your y-axis will be displaced to the right by about 25%.<br>  <br>  So, you have the basic graph paper lay-out, right?  The y-axis (pH) is near the center of the graph, and x axis (mL of titrant) is at the bottom.  Start doing this in pencil, so you are sure to get all the points right, then you can ink it in....<br>  <br>  ***At the y-axis, your curve needs to have a pH value of 6.00.  <br>  ***Now, as you are adding the base, that will be plotted going toward the right.  The pH will gradually increase, until you add about 90% (maybe 9.5 mL) of the base; then it will start climbing steeply.  The curve will climb very steeply at the equivalence point (10.8 mL of base), and then will start leveling out again like the curve on the website.<br>  ***Now, let's start adding acid; the pH will start gradually decreasing to the left.  At 1.1 mL, the pH will equal 5.95 (I'll explain in a moment), and will continue to decrease slowly until you add about 90% (maybe  11 mL of acid).  The curve will decrease sharply at the equivalence point (12.2 moles of acid), then will level out slightly after that point (kind of the mirror image of the basic side, which isn't shown on the website).<br>  <br>  What was with the pH value at 1.1 mL of acid?  The pKa is found to be the pH at the half-equivalence point.  Since the molarity of the acid and base are the same, that point comes halfway between the two equivalence points, which should be when you have added 1.1 mL of acid.  Make sense?<br>  <br>  Hope this makes it easier; let me know if you can imagine it from the way I described it!|`|R7vrJO4Laa	y value: pH<br>  <br>  x value: amount of NaOH added

SvmZlLdaaa	All dogs are the same species, regardless of breed or size, and can therefore produce offspring together. Big dogs mate with small dogs all the time - this is usually easier if the female is the small one, but it has been known for large females to lie down so that small males can mount them. Where there is too great a size difference - say, a Great Dane and a Chihuahua - the pair are physically unable to mate, but if you artificially inseminated the female, she would still become pregnant. This would be risky, however, if the female was the smaller of the two - the puppies would probably be too big for her body, meaning death during or even before birth. Depending on how well-developed they were, a Caesarian section might be possible to save both their lives. Indeed, selective breeding has produced some breeds that have been modified to such extremes by the whims of humans that they are unable to give birth naturally, due to such things as large, rounded skulls in the puppies and small birth canals in the mothers - the Japanese Chin is an example.|`|AZKbJESUaa	male bull mastiffs have mated with female Shih Tzu before. the female survived the births.|`|454bbfa3cd9f581722ab32321ee38ec9aa	Small dogs and big dogs can mate.

YrxJuStaaa	To put it simply... Xenon has a lot of electrons, hence the larger atomic mass, and the atomic radius is very large. Thus, the strength of the attraction between the outer electrons and the protons in the nucleus is weaker (increased distance from the nucleus means decreased attraction). With this decreased strength, they are more easily lost to other atoms.

But 228.276 is not exactly double 122.105<br>   But it is close to 2. Therefore the best match for the molecular formula would be  C14O4H12<br>  <br>  Please note: The very common food preservative, benzoic acid has a molecular formula C7H6O2  - C6H5COOH and molar mass is 122.12g/mol which is what I got above for the empirical formula. I do not know how to account for the information that the molar mass of the compound is 228.276.|`|IRniRv9daa	a) First, find the number of moles (n) of the carbon, oxygen and hydrogen.<br>  <br>  Use this formula:  n= m/M<br>  n= number of moles<br>  m= mass<br>  M= Molar Mass (you get this value on a periodic table)<br>  <br>  n(carbon)= 1.612/12<br>                 =  0.1343333333 mol<br>  <br>  n(oxygen)= 0.6079/16<br>                  =0.03799375 mol<br>  <br>  n(hydrogen)= 0.1151/1<br>                     = 0.1151 mol<br>  <br>  NOW YOU FIND THE RATIO OF THEM IN THE THE ENTIRE COMPOUND. DO THIS BY DIVIDING THE 3 FIGURES BY THE SMALLEST FIGURE.<br>  <br>  0.1343333333/0.03799375<br>  =3.535669243 (round this up to 4)<br>  <br>  0.03799375/0.03799375<br>  =1<br>  <br>  0.1151/0.03799375<br>  =3.029445633 (round down to 3)<br>  <br>  So the Ratio of carbon:oxygen:hydrogen is 4:1:3<br>  <br>  Therefore empirical formula is C4OH3<br>  <br>  :)  I'm not sure if your teacher is fussy about rounding and such...but this is the method.
tAWkYoWJaa	The electron dot diagram only has square brackets around it when it is an ion (when it has a + or - charge). <br>  <br>  To draw to dot diagram, start with your metal (Mg) and draw the remaining atoms around it. <br>  <br>  So you will have:  (try to ignore the lines on the sides, I couldn't get it to work out).<br>         <br>  _____ H--Mg--H<br>  ________  |<br>  ________ O<br>  <br>  Remember that most atoms follow the octet rule so the Mg should have 8 electrons surrounding it. <br>  <br>  In this diagram, the Mg is only bonded to 6 electrons, so it needs 2 more. Draw in the lone pair electrons around Mg, so it completes the octet:<br>  <br>  _______ . .<br>  _____H--Mg--H<br>  _______  |<br>  _______ O<br>  <br>  Now the Mg is stable, but what about the other atoms?<br>  Hydrogen only needs 2 electrons, so both hydrogens are already stable. The oxygen is in the sixth column on the periodic table, so it needs 6 electrons in order for it to be stable. <br>  Draw in the lone pairs on oxygen so it will be stable:<br>  <br>  ____________. .<br>  _________H--Mg--H<br>  ___________  |<br>  ___________:O:<br>  <br>  Now all the atoms are stable so there shouldn't be a + or - charge. (Which there isn't in this case). So you're done!! <br>  <br>  :)
R7vrJO4Laa	Metals' intermolecular forces are: metallic bonds<br>  <br>  This means that valence electrons on metals are delocalized (they move around) and spread out over the entire sheet of metal, like pizza sauce. Then when you try to bend the metal, the electrons move (they can b/c they're delocalized), so the metal can be pounded into different shapes/forms.<br>  <br>  Ionics, on the other hand, are held together by ionic bonding which is VERY strong. Because of the strong bonds, it is hard to break these bonds. And because it's hard to break these bonds, it's difficult to change the shape of the sample.|`|il5IuUdNaa	metals are usually solid, except for mercury. in solid state, the atoms are arranged in fixed positions and are closely packed together. layers of metal atoms can slide easily over each other, hence they are malleable.<br>  <br>  ionic compounds are brittle because the ions are held by ionic bonds or strong electrostatic forces of attractions that are very strong, so compounds are very solid and brittle and that explains why they have high melting point and boiling point too.
il5IuUdNaa	copper is a transition metal, hence it has more than one valency. it can lose 1 electron to become copper(I) or copper(II). the more common one is copper(II) oxide, CuO, but copper(I) oxide, Cu2O is quite common too.|`|vnSPf7Wqaa	its depending upon the outer most orbit electrons of copper|`|sD7zLRzdaa	different compounds are possible<br>  <br>  CuO where copper 'looses' two electrons (cupric oxide)<br>  Cu2O where each copper looses just 1 electron.

So it's a question of the number of distinct ways you can "rearrange" 2 shaded parts and 3 unshaded parts.<br>  <br>  If you have n objects in which 'a' of them are all the same, 'b' of them are all the same, 'c' of them are all the same, etc. then the number of ways you can rearrange them is <br>  n! / (a! b! c! ...)<br>  <br>  So here we have<br>  5! / (3! 2!) = <br>  5*4 / 2 = 10<br>  <br>  If you understand the n! / (a! b! c! ...) formula, you should be able to make a simple formula using a variable for the total number of boxes, and the number to be shaded.|`|j3hhvS5Aaa	Kindly type the question in the way it is given in the book/question paper<br>  your question is not understandable............

ReMRY8yhaa	Yes it's true. I just did a lab on this a few weeks ago. You're talking about TLC, right? It just helps the solvent front run faster because there's more of the vapor in the chamber.|`|AA12026078	Having the air saturated makes the solvent front run faster.<br>  <br>  If the air was not saturated, solvent from the moving front would evaporate into the air, this would effectively reduce the volume of solvent moving up the TLC. If the air is saturated in the solvent, the front does not lose any as evaporation does not happen.|`|tAWkYoWJaa	The TLC plate is placed in an enclosed chamber so that it will be fully saturated with the solvent vapour. This will make the experiment faster because the polar (or non-polar) solvent will attract the particles in the mixture solution and draw them up the plate. Since the vapour will cover the whole plate, the particles in the mixture will have a greater separation on the plate so it will be easier to view the individual components. <br>  <br>  The enclosed chamber as helps because the solvents normally evaporate quickly so if you don't use a lid, the plate may not be saturated enough for the complete separation of the components. If the solvent vapour is not enclosed it will escape into the atmosphere and may not saturate the top of the plate so the reaction will be much slower and it may not have very clear results.
AA12026078	The reason is that HCl reacts with the double bond of the ethene.

La Chatelier's Principle.|`|elEQIdukaa	it actually doesn't stop, but it has reached an equilibrium state. Remember that this reaction is also reversible and at equilibrium the amount of products formed is equal to the amount of products breaking down. This give the effect that it seems to have stopped. If you add a bit more HCl or C2H4 to the reaction then it will start again to obtain a new equilibrium position.<br>  <br>  Or the other explanation is that you have an excess of one of the reactants and so the reaction has gone to completion and hence you've run out of one of the reactants to continue the reaction.|`|XWE4Tr8caa	C2H4 + HCL => C2H5CL<br>  when excess HCL reacts with some amount of ethene, chloro ehtane is formed....n so even if more  of HCL is added in less amount of ethene, it wont react with choloroethane wen all the ethene is used up. n so the reaction cannot process further..<br>  <br>  <br>  if any doubt on dis, i will repeat this again..
FEChWYNTaa	The nature of a horizontal shaft impact crusher produces finished product with a reduction ratio of about 20:1 while jaw crusher will utilize much lower reduction ratios. The design of a compression (jaw) style crusher is principally used as a primary crusher due to its much lower reduction ratios. An impact crusher will generate more fines than a jaw crusher upon its initial pass while the secondary crushing required to produce a gradable aggregate initially crushed in a primary jaw crusher will generate a higher percentage of fines.<br>  <br>  In addition to the gradation of the material, particle shape is also very crucial to meeting gradable material specifications. The shattering of the material in a horizontal shaft impact crusher creates a more consistent cubical material shape. While a compression crusher such as a primary jaw or even a secondary cone crusher will produce a lot higher percentage of flat or elongated particles. Nearly all material specifications require the rigid spec base rock must be cubical in shape in order to lock into place to meet the high percentage of compaction.

elEQIdukaa	A spontaneous redox reaction occurs when energy can be released. This means when you take the sum of the E values of the two equations, it should give u a positive potential difference. <br>  <br>  You can predict this by using the standard electropotential (SEP) table with the half equations. On this table, the oxidants are found on the left hand side and the strongest oxidant is at the top. The reductants are found on the right hand side and the strongest reductant is found at the bottom.<br>  <br>  When using the table to find spontaneous redox reactions, remember to follow these simple steps:<br>  <br>  (1) Find the half equations that you are interested in. <br>  <br>  (2) Only on the left hand side (oxidant), find the species within the reaction that is the strongest oxidant - this means go up the table on the left and find which one of the two oxidants u have is the strongest. Mark an arrow to the right for that strong oxidant.<br>  <br>  (3) On the right hand side, find the species within the reaction that is the strongest reductant - this means going down the table on the right and find which one of the two reductants u have is the strongest. Mark an arrow to the left for the strong reductant<br>  <br>  (4) Check that the oxidant half equation does to the right and the reductant half equation goes to the left. You should find that the oxidant species will be always higher than the reductant species. Another way is to see if your half reactions go in a clockwise direction.<br>  <br>  (5) Also remember that H2O can acts as an oxidant and reductant... check whether or not H2O is a stronger oxidant or reductant than the species that u have looked at.. if so, then water will react in preference to the other half cell.<br>  <br>  I'll use one of ur questions as an example:<br>  <br>  Pb2+ (aq) / Pb (s)  ||  Ni2+ (aq) / Ni (s)<br>  <br>  (1) we find the half equations for these species, Pb has been given as - 0.13V and u'll find that Ni is at -0.23V<br>  <br>  (2) looking for the strongest oxidant, you can see that H2O is the weakest (-0.83V), then Ni2+ and then Pb2+... so Pb2+ is ur strongest oxidant.<br>  <br>  (3) looking for the strongest reductant, you can see that H2O again is the weakest (+1.23V), followed by Pb and then Ni, so Ni (s) is ur strongest reductant.<br>  <br>  (4) So now u just add the two half equations together making sure u balance the electrons:<br>  <br>  Ni(s) + Pb2+ (aq) --> Ni2+(aq) + Pb (s)<br>  <br>  E = -0.13V + (+0.23V) <br>     = 0.10V<br>  <br>  note that the E of Ni is reversed since we have the used the reverse reaction of the Ni on the table.<br>  <br>  now try the other one by yourself|`|YsEYSPAlaa	With redox reactions, a more reactive metal (solid) gives up electrons and becomes a dissolved ion (in other words, it's oxidized).  A less reactive metal (dissolved in aqueous solution at first) receives electrons and becomes a solid (it's "reduced").<br>  <br>  First, you have to compare the reactivity of the elements.  If the solid metal is more reactive than the metal in the ionic compound, the reaction will happen.  You need to look at an "activity series" in order to judge reactivity.  More reactive metals are listed higher on the chart.<br>  <br>  Lead is less reactive than copper, so:<br>  Pb(s) + NiNO3 --> no reaction<br>  <br>  Lead is more reactive than copper, so:<br>  2Pb(s) + Cu(NO3)2(aq) --> 2PbNO3(aq) + Cu(s)<br>  In this case, you would observe copper metal forming on the lead rod.  You might expect a bronze coppery color, but when I tried it it looked more silvery.

29RZnLedaa	Interactions between the side chains, and backbone of the polypeptide.  For example, cysteine residues can form disulfide linkages with other cysteine residues.  The carboxyl group of one residue can hydrogen bond with the amino group of another residues forming either an alpha helix or beta sheet.

4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	>>i need an equation <br>  <br>  No, you need to understand what's going on.  Otherwise an equation isn't going to help much.<br>  <br>  Graph the triangle.  If we were to rotate the shape 90 degrees counterclockwise, then that would be like turn the paper to the left by 90 degrees, so that the original top side of the paper is now aligned to the left.  Do that with your paper of the graphed triangle: turn the whole notebook 90 degrees and look at your graph now.  The x-axis becomes the y-axis and the y-axis becomes the x-axis.<br>  <br>  When you turn your paper, it now looks like your three points are at (0,2), (0,6), and (-3,2).  Return your paper back to the original position, draw a new graph, and now plot THOSE three points.<br>  <br>  Similarly, if you turn the notebook 180 degrees so that it's upside down, the original points now look like they're at (-2,0), (-6,0), and (-2,-3).<br>  <br>  Hopefully you understand now what the results should be, and one way to get them.  As for a "shortcut", notice that when you turned you paper counter-clockwise 90 degrees, that each of the 4 axis arrows shift over one position.  So the positive y-axis now becomes the negative x-axis, the positive x-axis now becomes the positive y-axis, the negative y-axis becomes the positive x-axis, and the negative x-axis becomes the negative y-axis.  This means that if you have a point, the sign of the y-coordinate changes and it becomes the new x-coordinate, and the sign of the x-coordinate stays the same and becomes the new y-coordinate.<br>  <br>  So if (a,b) is a point on your original graph, then (-b, a) is a point on your new graph.  Likewise, you can show that when the graph is rotated 180 degrees, (a,b) becomes (-a,-b).|`|zvxqmaIcaa	We'll use point M for all the examples.  When you graph point M normally, you start at the origin (0,0), go right 2 spaces on the x-axis, then go up 3 spaces on the y-axis.  <br>  For the 90 degree counterclockwise rotation, you go LEFT 3 spaces on the x-axis, then go UP 2 spaces on the y-axis.  (it may be easier to think of it like this for the rotation, you can go UP 2 spaces on the y-axis, then go LEFT 3 spaces on the x-axis, either way is the same result.)  Plot the point M there.  Follow the same procedure for the other two points then connect the lines.<br>  Your formula then is something like this:<br>  (x,y) -> (-y,x)<br>  In the example M = (2,3) so for M, x = 2, y = 3.  See they are in the same place in the parentheses.  i.e. M = (2,3) = (x,y).  <br>  To do the rotation, you can use the 'formula' (x,y) -> (-y,x)  like this... (2,3) -> (-3,2).<br>  For the 180 degree rotation, you can just rotate 90 degrees twice.  For the translation, (x,y) -> (x+1, y+1), just do something similar... If we translate M from its original position, we get this (2,3) -> (2+1,3+1) = (3,4) so we would plot the translated point at (3,4).  See its easy, but the 'equations' are in a little different form than you are used to using.  Thats all.<br>  <br>  edit: corrected math error and formatting.  There is no forumula that you can use on the entire LMN triangle.  The triangle is make up a 3 individual points: L,M, & N, and the lines connecting them.  Any equation that you will use will only work on the three seperate points.  You have to apply the same formula three times, one for each point of the triangle.  The lines connecting the points just "go along for the ride"  Look again at the formula I showed.  It is indeed an equation.<br>  Any point, (x,y) after a 90 degree rotation becomes the point (-y,x)

c1a600e6083d6130287db4610398bcd3aa	Cybernetics is the interdisciplinary study of the structure of regulatory systems. Cybernetics is closely related to control theory and systems theory. Both in its origins and in its evolution in the second-half of the 20th century, cybernetics is equally applicable to physical and social (that is, language-based) systems.<br>  <br>  Cybernetics is preeminent when the system under scrutiny is involved in a closed signal loop, where action by the system in an environment causes some change in the environment and that change is manifest to the system via information/feedback that causes changes in the way the system then behaves, and all this in service of a goal or goals. This "circular causal" relationship is necessary and sufficient for a cybernetic perspective.<br>  <br>  Therefore there is no particular or special relationship to civil engineering but rather to control system engineering.

42V3nmPaaa	Well, since you are plotting velocity vs time, think about it.<br>  The acceleration of 5m/s^2 for the first 5 seconds says that the car's speed increased by additional 5m/s every second for 5 seconds. So if you start at 0m/s speed, in 1 sec the speed would be 5m/s, in 2 sec it would be 10m/s and so on.<br>  After 5 seconds the velocity remains the same, so it is simply a horizontal line at that given value of the velocity axis.

GgClh7dbaa	Six<br>  <br>  The Calvin cycle is a very complex and difficult to follow process that is the second part of photosynthesis, the part than can occur in darkness. CO2 which has been captured in the first part of photosynthesis in a process requiring chlorophyll and sunlight, is fixed (connected to another molecule). It will ultimately be assembled into the six-carbon sugar glucose. Three turns of the Calvin cycle fixes three CO2 molecules and converts them to PGAL, a three carbon intermediate, two molecules of which will be next be converted into glucose and oxygen. <br>  <br>  You can see the cycle graphically here: <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/C004535/calvin_cycle.html" rel="nofollow">http://library.thinkquest.org/C004535/ca...</a><br>  <br>  This describes how the CO2 is bound to a phosphorylated five carbon sugar ribulose into a six carbon substance that splits into two three carbon fragments called glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which is also called phosphoglyceraldehyde, or PGAL. When this happens three times, three CO2 are bound to three ribuloses to form six of these three carbon PGAL fragments are formed. One goes on to become a half of a glucose molecule, and the other five are converted back into the three ribuloses. When this happens six times, two three carbon PGALs are generated which are then converted into a whole glucose molecule.|`|EGIGzPiLaa	<a href="http://readyanswers.advancedroofinginc.net" rel="nofollow">http://readyanswers.advancedroofinginc.n...</a>  <br>  it<br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in websi

These bridges, or "wormholes" are pretty unstable. They appear at a certain point in time, and disappear almost instantly. To hold them open, we need hypothetical matter called "negative matter".

1GnMZc0Maa	If you don't know the 4 other cards dealt to the players, and apparently there is no dealer according to your problem (doesn't sound like BJ to me, but whatever), then there are 50 cards unseen.  The players don't matter, the dealer doesn't matter, the suits don't matter.<br>  <br>  Your had has a total of 15... so you need to get 6 points total in the next 2 cards to total 21.  The only combinations that will provide that are ace + 5, 2 + 4, or 3 + 3.<br>  <br>  Your odds of getting one of those cards next is easy to calculate... 20/50.  The complication comes with the 4th card.  If by chance you get one of those cards ace-5, your odds of getting it's complement on the fourth are 4/49, or 3/49 if it's a 3 you need.  So instead of a simple formula, we'll break it down into parts then add it up.<br>  <br>  Ace then 5<br>  (4/50) * (4/49) = 16/2450<br>  <br>  2 then 4<br>  (4/50) * (4/49) = 16/2450<br>  <br>  3 then 3<br>  (4/50) * (3/49) = 12/2450<br>  <br>  4 then 2<br>  (4/50) * (4/49) = 16/2450<br>  <br>  5 then Ace<br>  (4/50) * (4/49) = 16/2450<br>  <br>  Sum = 76/2450<br>  <br>  Round it off, it's about a 3.1% chance<br>  <br>  Edit - In response to your additional info... the main thing to consider is that even though there are 4 cards no longer in the deck being dealt, they remain UNSEEN.  We cannot adjust which cards we know remain in the deck until they are seen.  If we knew that, for example, one of those cards dealt to a player was a 10, then your odds go up slightly.  Likewise, if one of those cards was a 4, then your odds go down slightly.  For the purpose of calculating odds, you have to consider all unseen cards as still remaining in the deck.|`|s7jwYBdqaa	double down now!!!!!!!!!!!!!
zdSRsySNaa	The question is basically saying that if you choose two people at random, what is the probability that they both have the same blood type?<br>  <br>  The probability that a person has a blood type is given for each blood type in the list. The probability that a second person has a particular blood type will be the same as the probability that the first person has it. <br>  <br>  So the probability that both people have a particular blood type is the probability that the first person has it AND the second person has it. <br>  <br>  So that's the two probabilities multiplied together, which is the given probability for that blood type squared.<br>  <br>  So for two people to have the same blood type (any of the blood types listed) you just add together the squares of all the given  blood types.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to convert all the percentages to ordinary decimals first.<br>  <br>  <br>  So it's 0.374 squared + 0.066 squared, + 0.357 squared + ... ... + 0.034 squared + 0.006 squared.<br>  <br>  You can do all that on a calculator of course. Don't forget that on a calculator you need to think about the way you put the sum in so it doesn't keep squaring the sub-totals as you go. Probably best to work out all the individual squares first and then add them together.<br>  <br>  Finally you just need to convert your total back into a percentage.<br>  <br>  After doing all that, the answer I got was: 28.4292%

Mr4DFAVkaa	The kidneys filter blood, and are thus responsible for maintaining homeostasis of the cells and substances that make up the blood. <br>  <br>  When an individual is excessively sweating, their blood volume will drop, causing a drop in blood pressure. In such a situation, the kidney will detect the low blood pressure, producing renin, which acts on the liver to release angiotensin. Angiotensin causes vasoconstriction, which increases the muscle tone of the blood vessels, raising blood pressure. Also, when blood volume drops, the hypothalamus tells the posterior pituitary gland to release antidiuretic hormone, which acts on the kidney, causing it to retain water.<br>  <br>  As far as erythrocyte concentration goes, the kidneys produce erythropoietin when there is low oxygen in the blood. This stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells.<br>  <br>  Kidneys also detect levels of calcium... when calcium levels are low, the kidneys secrete Vitamin D, which increases GI absorption of calcium, in turn increasing the levels of calcium in the blood. It also works with parathyroid hormone in the resorption of calcium from bone. This allows for bone remodeling, and thus, bone growth.|`|GeL1uwYmaa	hormones produced in kidneycompensate for excessive perspiration<br>  <br>  kidneys don't play any role in erythrocyte coc. or bone 7 teeth development<br>  there role is excretory not development

The presence of the herbicide is necessary so that it is more likely for the RS to mature and reproduce offspring that are also resistant, at the same time making it more likely for NHRS to die before they are able to mature and reproduce more non-resistant strains.  If this continues for many generation the NHRS will be kept in check while the RS continues to flourish replacing the NHRS with the RS.  This a basic explanation of natural selection which is the driving force behind evolution.
cL6CWj2waa	Sources:<br>  Thiamine is found in a wide variety of foods at low concentrations. Yeast and pork meat are the most highly concentrated sources of thiamine. Cereal grains, however, are the most important dietary sources of thiamine in the diet as these foods are consumed readily in most diets.<br>  <br>  <br>  Daily Intake/Doses:<br>  The RDA in most countries is set at about 1.4 mg. However, tests on volunteers at daily doses of about 50 mg have claimed an increase in mental acuity.[19] There are no reports available of adverse effects from consumption of excess thiamine by ingestion of food and supplements. Because the data are inadequate for a quantitative risk assessment, no Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) can be derived for thiamine.<br>  <br>  <br>  Absorption:<br>  Thiamine is released by the action of phosphatase and pyrophosphatase in the upper small intestine. At low concentrations the process is carrier mediated and at higher concentrations, absorption occurs via passive diffusion. Active transport is greatest in the jejunum and ileum (it is inhibited by alcohol consuption and by folate deficiency.Decline in thiamine absorption occurs at intakes above 5 mg.

If you can write any solution as a linear combination of a certain set of expressions, then that set of expressions form a "basis" of the solution set.<br>  <br>  For example, { (1,0), (0,1) } can be a basis for R^2, because any point on the R^2 plane can be expressed as a linear combination of these.  For example, the point (5,-4) is equal to 5(1,0) + -4(0,1).  Or if you had the line 3x + 6y = 7, this is the same as y = (7 - 3x)/6, so a basis could be the general coordinate point (c, (7-3c)/6) because any point on the line can be expressed as the point (c, (7-3c)/6) for some value of c.<br>   <br>  So...let's first try to find a general solution to this differential equation.<br>  <br>  The characteristic equation is<br>  c^3 + 2c^2 + 4c + 8 = 0<br>  This factors into<br>  (c^2 + 4)(c + 2) = 0<br>  <br>  This has c = 2i, -2i and -2 as solutions,  This page shows you how to basically take it from there:<br>  <a href="http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/HOHomogeneousDE.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/D...</a>|`|vHTwS3E3aa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081005051839AAMKyu7">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>

6e9wMh6yaa	The gene for Fragile X (the FMR1 gene) is on the X chromosome and therefore fragile X syndrome is called an X-linked genetic disorder.

Mr4DFAVkaa	Fragile X carriers are heterozygous. Only females can be carriers, as it is an X-linked trait. Any male with a single mutated X-chromosome that corresponds to the mutation in Fragile X would express the disorder, whether they have a pre-mutation (50-200 repeats of the CGG sequence at the FMR1 gene on the X-chromosome, these individuals have less severe symptoms) or full mutation (over 200 repeats, these individuals have more severe symptoms). <br>  <br>  Females who are carriers may have some symptoms, but because they have one normal X-chromosome, the mutated X-chromosome is not active in all cells, they may be asymptomatic or express only some symptoms (this is due to a phenomenon called "X-inactivation").

UFteXlqwaa	There is no special reason other than this one:<br>  <br>  Up north, the winter is quite cold; the sun is low over the horizon and perhaps there is snow. In a high pressure, all that contributes to the forming of an inversion: cold air near the ground and warm air above.<br>  <br>  When that happens, there isn't the normal convection process of the sun heating the surface, the air rising and cooling down with altitude.<br>  <br>  You perhaps have noticed that there are more cumulus clouds in the middle of a summer day, than a winter day. That's your reason for the poor air quality.<br>  <br>  If you live near a city or industrial area, the air pollution doesn't rise and blend with the upper atmosphere; it stays down in the valleys, creating haze, fog, smog and everything that is typical for a winter's day in a high pressure.<br>  <br>  I fly a tiny little aircraft summer and winter, here in Norway. And during the winter, I often observe inversions. How do I know? My outside thermometer shows higher temperature when I climb to over 1,000 feet above the ground! Sometimes there is no wind at all on the ground but there is wind aloft. Another sign of an inversion.|`|3rvFMQ0vaa	The clouds. The atmospheric pressure holds the pollution in.

UFteXlqwaa	It is an urban legend to believe that in the winter, the air being colder and therefore denser, carry better the sounds.<br>  <br>  It is true that colder air is denser and that sound waves move faster in colder air but our perception in decibels of the sound attenuation is not sensible to that. On the other hand, aircraft are and that's why airliners often measure their speed not in mph but in Mach, i.e. a fraction of the speed of sound for that altitude and temperature.<br>  <br>  What defines how good we can hear a distant sound is:<br>  1) The actual acoustic of the place. Obstacles prevent the sound propagation. Open sea water is often the best sound carrier.<br>  2) Interferences. The wind is the greatest one. Imagine you thrown a stone in the water of a lake that is perfectly calm. The circles of wavelets will travel very far.

T14B9NkDaa	in 3H2O, take note that the 3 is for both H and O atom. so, there are 3 H2 atoms. that means, 3x2 is 6 and thus there are 6 H atoms. or to make it look even simpler, imagine this :<br>  <br>  H2 + H2 + H2 = 6 H atoms.<br>  <br>  from H3PO4 + NaOH -----> Na3PO4 +H2O<br>  <br>  you can see that there are only 1 Na on the left side but 3 Na on the right side. the tip here is to look at the right side and determine what number should be put in front of Na. you can always use trial and error method. eg: i have chosen number 2.<br>  <br>  H3PO4 + NaOH -----> 2Na3PO4 +H2O<br>  <br>  so now there are 6 Na on the right. to make them balanced, put a 6 for Na on the left.<br>  <br>  H3PO4 + 6NaOH -----> 2Na3PO4 +H2O  <br>  <br>  (the 2 is for both Na3 and PO4)<br>  <br>  so now the Na are already balanced. but, now you have 2 PO4 on the left. so put another 2 in front of H3PO4.<br>  <br>  2H3PO4 + 6NaOH ------> 2Na3PO4 + H2O<br>  <br>  and now you would see that there are 6H + another 6H makes a total of 12H on the left. so on the right you already have H2. you should put a 6 in front of it so that now there will be 12H on the right too.<br>  <br>  the final balanced equation will be :<br>  <br>  2H3PO4 + 6NaOH ------> 2Na3PO4 + 6H2O|`|ODjxbdEEaa	2H3PO4+ 6NAOH> 2NA3PO4 + 6H2O<br>  look at number of sodium if oxygen is uneven you have to twice accoding to na3, P the hydrogen and oxygen will fit since there only change in base elements|`|kXPxdIw8aa	H3PO4 + NaOH > Na3PO4 +H2O<br>  <br>  H3PO4 + 3NaOH > Na3PO4 +H2O<br>  <br>  H3PO4 + 3NaOH > Na3PO4 +3H2O|`|LRns6R5iaa	You have it right!

00ebd2eaffa7716c767c7d6d18bebd83aa	Il y a plusieurs preuves d'existence de la matière noire comme la mesure des courbes de rotations de galaxies, les mesures du CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) par le satellite de la NASA WMAP, et encore plus récemment le phénomène de collisions de deux amas de galaxie. Toute la communauté s'accorde à dire à l'heure actuelle que cette matière noire existe et n'est pas baryonique! (au sens que ce n'est pas de la matière connue, constituée de quarks, d'électrons etc...). Maintenant, les modèles qui expliquent l'existence de cette matière noire et expliquent ses proportions dans l'univers (qu'on connait grace au CMB) sont multiples. Il en existe des centaines, voire des milliers! Les plus connus et les plus plébicités sont des modèles dits supersymétriques, invoquant l'existence de nouvelles particules, partenaires supersymétrique des particules "classiques" actuellement connues et qui constituent la matière à notre échelle d'énergie sur Terre. Par contre à l'instar de ce que dit l'internaute précedent, la particule supersymétrique la plus probable pour expliquer la nature de la matière noire est le neutralino, non pas le photino. Un autre candidat à la mode est aussi le gravitino (partenaire supersymétrique du graviton). Ces deux particules sont les LSP (Lightest Stable Particles) du modèle minimal supersymétrique (modéle supersymètrique qui requiert un nombre minimum de paramètre pour être décrit).<br>  D'autre part, il est depuis longtemps établi que le neutrino ne pourra jamais être le candidat pour expliquer la nature de la matière noire, celui-ci n'est pas assez lourd même s'il a une masse (cf oscillation des neutrinos). Il existe néanmoins des modèles incluant des "neutrinos lourds" pour expliquer la DM (Dark Matter). <br>  Enfin, les modèles dits MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) n'expliquent pas non plus cette présence de matière noire. Ces modèles ont été invoqué pour expliquer les courbes de rotations de galaxies (vitesses de rotation non nulles au-delà de la matière visible). Elles stipulent que la loi de la gravité est modifiée lorsqu'on dépasse un certain paramètre d'échelle. Il a été montré que ceci est complétement faux.<br>  Pour résumer, on est tous d'accord pour dire que la matière noire est constituée de particules inconnues (synonyme de nouvelle physique) appelées WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles). Ces particules doivent avoir une certaine masse pour s'accréter gravitationnelement sous forme de halos (autour des galaxies par exemple). Elles doivent aussi avoir une longue durée de vie (depuis les premiers instants de l'univers), donc elles doivent intéragir faiblement pour ne pas s'annihiler. C'est tout ce que l'on sait à l'heure actuelle sur ces WIMPs. Beaucoup d'expériences sont en cours pour les détecter comme EDELWEISS, GLAST, HESS etc... mais les physiciens attendent surtout les premiers résultats du nouveau collisionneur de particules au CERN (LHC pour Large Hadron Collider), et aussi pour voir si la supersymétrie existe. Ils pourront ainsi mettre plus de contraintes sur les modèles décrivant les WIMPs et la matière noire.|`|6319763606297544ae60662320f2dbb3aa	Fl?te, je ne sais pas!! <br>  Pourtant je me suis souvent posé cette question...<br>  <br>  J'attends les réponses avec impatience!!|`|6aeeda868b8ceba98f846207a78c864aaa	Personne ne peut en être certain, mais dans les années qui viennent, les accélérateurs de particules seront probablement assez puissants pour nous permettre d'observer de nouvelles particules.<br>  <br>  En effet, on invoque souvent des partiules élémentaires encore inconnues mais que certaines théories prévoient pour expliquer la masse manquante de l'Univers.<br>  <br>  Parmi ces sus-dites "certaines théories", il y a par exemple la supersymétrie, selon laquelle chaque partiule élémentaire aurait un partenaire aux propriétés légèrement différentes. Le partenaire dupersymétriques des photons, des quarks, des électrons, des neutrinos seraient ainsi des photinos, des s-quarks, des s-électrons et des neutralinos respectivement.<br>  <br>  Le photino est probablement le seul candidat supersymétrique qui puisse relever le défi de la matière manquante, car il est le plus léger et donc le plus stable de toutes les particules supersymétriques. Les autres se sont théoriquement désintégrées depuis belle lurette.<br>  <br>  Mais une bonne partie de la masse manquante pourrait être remplie par des particles bien connues de la physique des particules : les neutrinos. On a longtemps cru que les neutrinos n'avaient pas de masse, alors que certains phénomènes les faisant intervenir s'expliquent uniquement s'ils sont massifs. Cette masse est en fait plus qu'infime, mais les neutrinos sont littéralement surabondants dans l'Univers. Donc au total ils comptent pour beaucoup.<br>  <br>  UN AJOUT après avoir lu la réponse qui suit :<br>  Pardon pour l'erreur du photino, mais cela me semblait tellement certain que je n'ai pas pensé à vérifier.<br>  Tout compte fait la masse des neutrinos est si petite que leur denisté d'énergie atteint à peine celle des photons du fond micro-onde cosmique, soit pas loin de 0,005 % de la densité critique (si je ne trompe pas d'unité !).<br>  En tout cas je concède tout ce que l'on peut dire après moi, puisque monsieur est dans le métier et que je ne suis qu'un enthousiaste au savoir fort imparfait...<br>  Il est vrai que cette oservation de collision des deux amas de galaxies est une bien belle confirmation de la matière noire, et le cou de la MOND est définitivement tordu on dirait...|`|f1bff29a4ee84b82aa97b766d66acca8aa	Kaboum jurer jamais manger matière noire !|`|e70614d349cdfc5b2b5738f4ab859bcdaa	yoda me l'a dit: pour hawking il y a 3 phénomènes<br>  1; forces des marées de trou noir<br>  2; force gravitationnelle "première" c'est du big-bang<br>  3; peut être un coup de sabre par erreur, quand je n'était qu'un petit padawan<br>  4; en partie d? au fait que l'on a bousillé dark vador (petite masse noire)<br>  enfin yoda m'a dit mais bon...|`|d9d17ad25113126275da0508fe3e4e6caa	La  matière noire n'est qu'une hypothèse pour expliquer pourquoi les galaxies ne tournent pas comme elles devraient au vu de leur masse visible.<br>  Mais cette matière noire peut se trouver dans d'autres dimensions (théorie des cordes) ou bien il faut envisager que la loi de Newton n'est plus valable à grande distance ou bien ... ou bien ...
K6QlFoo0aa	These are the five basic and most important rules of exponents - I have given examples for each rule.:<br>  <br>  1) (x^a) * (x^b) = (x^(a + b))<br>  <br>  Example: x = 2, a = 2, b = 3<br>  <br>  (2^3) * (2^2) = 8 * 4 = 32 = 2^5 = [2^(2+3)]<br>  ---------------------<br>  <br>  2) (x^a) / (x^b) = (x^(a - b))<br>  <br>  Example: x = 2, a = 3, b = 2<br>  <br>  (2^3) / (2^2) = 8 / 4 = 2 = (2^1) = [2^(3-2)]<br>  ---------------------<br>  <br>  3) ((x^a)^b) = (x^(a * b))<br>  <br>  Example: x = 2, a = 2, b = 3<br>  <br>  ((2^2)^3) = (4^3) = 4 * 4 * 4 = 64 = (2^6) = [2^(2*3)]<br>  ---------------------<br>  <br>  4) For b ≠ 0 (because you cannot divide by 0) ((a/b)^n) = (a^n) / (b^n)..<br>  <br>  Example: a = 4, b = 2, n = 3<br>  <br>  [(4/2)^3] = (2^3) = 8 = (64 / 8) = [(4^3) / (2^3)]<br>  ---------------------<br>  <br>  5) (a*b)^n = (a^n) * (b^n)<br>  <br>  Example: a = 2, b = 3, n = 4<br>  <br>  [(2*3)^4] = (6^4) = 1296 = (16 * 81) = [(2^4) * (3^4)]<br>  <br>  ----------------------<br>  You really have to know these rules and how to use them to do well in your class.  That's why I gave examples for each rule.  If you know them and can use them you should get an A on any test of exponents.<br>  ----------------------<br>  <br>  1)  sqrt("anything") = ("that same anything")^(1/2) - I am assuming that you know this.  If you don't it's in your algebra book and, if you take good notes in class, it will be in your notes.<br>  <br>  2)  So sqrt(a^8) = (a^8)^(1/2)<br>  <br>  Using rule (3)  ((x^a)^b) = (x^(a * b)) this becomes:<br>  <br>  a^(8 * (1/2)) = a^(8/2) = a^4.<br>  .

2lQ8DJAcaa	The way rocks change depends on various processes that are always taking place on and under the earth's surface.<br>  <br>  Igneous rock forms when magma cools and makes crystals. Magma is a hot liquid made of melted minerals. The minerals can form crystals when they cool. Igneous rock can form underground, where the magma cools slowly. Or, igneous rock can form above ground, where the magma cools quickly. <br>  <br>  On Earth's surface, wind and water can break rock into pieces. They can also carry rock pieces to another place. Usually, the rock pieces, called sediments, drop from the wind or water to make a layer. The layer can be buried under other layers of sediments. After a long time the sediments can be cemented together to make sedimentary rock. In this way, igneous rock can become sedimentary rock.<br>  <br>  Baked rock does not melt, but it does change. It forms crystals. If it has crystals already, it forms larger crystals. Because this rock changes, it is called metamorphic.

caF39cGcaa	yes<br>  <br>  Well, its answer is very simple. Watermelon does not sink in the water due to some simple reasons. First of all it has the air in it. So when a thing has some air in it and the that thing is also air tight i.e there is no way from where air can leak than that thing would totally behaves like a tube. I meant to say from tube is swimming tube. If you'd put the tube of some tire of a car while it is full of air it would not sink as well. <br>  <br>  And that is the same case which is applied on watermelon. Watermelon also has air in it and the air has no way to come out from it until you'd cut it.

Wn3LGHTvaa	Courtship and clutch size vary with the species. Fertilization is internal, with the male mounting the female from the rear and inserting his penis into her cloaca. As a general rule, if the eggs are laid on land, they will have a leathery or hard coating and fertilization will have to be internal, no matter what the species of vertebrate.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	Courtship is relatively short, usually lasting between 5 and 15 minutes.  It begins with a chase, during which many males swim after a single mature female. The first male to reach the female swims in front of her, facing her with front legs stretched out. Occasionally, he strokes her head with his long claws.  This apparently entices the female to follow him.  Once the female is willing, the two sink to the bottom of the pond to mate.  Interestingly, Painted Turtle females do not always wait for the males to initiate mating: occasionally, a female turtle will pursue the suitor of her choice!<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  In June or July, female turtles lay 6 to 18 oval eggs, about 3 cm long or the length of a two-dollar coin, in a carefully prepared nest.   Nests are built between dusk and dawn.  Females are very watchful for predators, and scan the shore several times before venturing on land.  They look for open, south-facing sites with loose soil and without a lot of plants, roots, and rocks.  These sites can be up to 150 m away from the water, and females may have to cross roads to reach a good site.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Once satisfied with the site, a female begins by digging with her front legs.  She quickly switches to her more powerful hind legs, creating a flask-shaped hole about a foot deep.  Females often urinate on the soil while they are digging, which may soften the soil. Once the eggs are laid, the female fills the nest with soil, compacting it with her feet and plastron, and then covering it with vegetation and debris.|`|2bKgIMSsaa	Turtles mate at sea, then the female lays the fertilised eggs on the beach.

eS5VOgKfaa	Ferns are green, frond containing (not leaves), spore-producing plants that can be found all over the world, though they prefer warm, wet, shady regions. With more than 10,000 species, ferns are a large and diverse group of plants. Gardeners love them for their delicate beauty and their easy maintenance. Ferns range in size from tiny, one-inch (2.5 centimeters) varieties to treelike plants, the tallest of which is New Zealand's black tree fern, which can grow as tall as 65 feet (20 meters). While the leaves of a fern, called fronds, live only about a year or two, the stems and roots of these plants can live a very long time, up to 100 years. Fern species are some of the oldest land plants; scientists believe they have been around for more than 350 million years.<br>  <br>  Mosses and ferns-reproduce by scattering spores rather than seeds. These plants produce spores in sporangia, or spore cases. Once the spores are mature, they are released and scatter, sometimes carried by wind and water until they reach suitable places for new plants to start. Once spores germinate, they produce tiny plants called gametophytes, which look nothing like the parent plants they came from. Gametophytes produce sex cells and then unite with each other to create the next generation, plants called sporophytes (which do resemble their parents). During the sporophyte stage, the plant produces spores, which eventually fall to the ground, scatter, and begin the process all over again.<br>  <br>  hope this helps
AA11513203	They're not.  Most organisms on earth reproduce asexually.   <br>  <br>  Don't forget the the overwhelming bulk of life on the planet is micro-organisms ... we big multicellular organisms (plants and animals) represent only a sliver of the total life on the planet.   And most micro-organisms reproduce asexually.<br>  <br>  But to answer your question, sexual reproduction introduces a new way of *recombining* DNA.   In asexual reproduction, every offspring is basically a genetic clone of its parent ... except for the occasional mutation.   Bacteria also engage in what's called "conjugation" where they swap occasional genes ... but this is not very effective or consistent.   But with sexual reproduction, every new individual is a different genetic combination from either of its parents ... an entirely new, unique set of genes with the possibility of some improvement.<br>  <br>  This dramatically impacts the speed at which an organism can evolve in times of crisis (resources are low, or following some catastrophe, or introduction of a new predator, disease, or toxin in the environment, etc.)  It allows for the development of incredible complexity, and paved the way for the more complex multicellular organisms (the plants and animals).|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Sexual reproduction involves another organism; asexual does not.

mlAwNRWhaa	Body temperature = is regulated by the hypothalamus in the brain. It serves as a thermostat, initiating physiological measures to lose or gain heat. Heat is conserved by constriction of the small arteries supplying blood to tiny capillaries near the surface of the skin. This reduces blood flow in the capillaries. To lose heat, small arteries dilate, increasing blood flow in the capillaries. Heat is lost from them. As sweat is produced the evaporation of the water from the sweat cools the skin.<br>  <br>  Blood sugar Level = is regulated by two pancreatic hormones, namely insulin and glucagon. insulin is released; it binds to receptors and, through signal transduction, results in an increase in glucose uptake by cells, effectively lowering blood glucose. When blood sugar decreases, glucagon is released, binds to cell receptors, and causes glucose to be released into circulation. Diabetes mellitus is a disorder that results from excessively high levels of blood glucose. Type II diabetics have normal to elevated levels of insulin. What, then, might be causing the elevated blood glucose levels. Blood sugar rises because The elevated glucose level is caused by the inability of the cells to "take in " the glucose and use it for energy. The glucose continues to circulate in the blood.

AA11513203	Because it shows that species can change over time.   <br>  <br>  That is the very *DEFINITION* of evolution ... change in the inherited characteristics of a population over time.<br>  <br>  Evolution is NOT only about "apes to humans" (as 'J. B. the Super Nerd' seems to think).  It is NOT only about species changing into different species.   Big change (including speciation) CAN happen if enough small changes accumulate, but that's NOT all that evolution is.   <br>  <br>  People who say things like "that's not evolution, that's genetic engineering", or "that's adaptation", or "that's microevolution" (another term they misunderstand) ... are just trying to apply a different word to small-time changes so that they can avoid admitting that evolution occurs at all.<br>  <br>  They are insisting (without any reason, and despite *HUGE* evidence to the contrary) that small changes cannot lead to big changes over time (which they sometimes mistakenly call 'macroevolution', which misunderstands what that word means as well).  They are just trying to *REDEFINE* biological terms like 'evolution' in a way that doesn't make sense, so that they can say "see, it doesn't make sense."   <br>  <br>  Their goal is not understanding, but rejection.<br>  <br>  If I breed cocker spaniels with floppier ears, or dairy goats with flatter toplines, or roses with more peach-colored petals ... then THAT IS EVOLUTION.  Period.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.  For other people who say that selective breeding (artificial selection) was used by Darwin as an "analogy" ... this is true ... but it was an analogy for *natural selection*, not evolution.    Selective breeding (artificial selection) that produces a change in the breed is not just an "analogy" for evolution, IT *IS* EVOLUTION.   By *definition*!<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry if I'm getting a little strident.   But people who don't get that the word evolution refers to *ANY* genetic change ... small or big ... in a population, will never understand what the word 'evolution' means.<br>  <br>  And if you don't understand what the word *means*, then how can you evaluate honestly whether the concept itself makes any sense?|`|h4wNRqf9aa	selective breeding is evidence for evolution.. just as building a car is evidence that cars exist<br>  <br>  <br>  it IS evolution|`|lMN59lv2aa	Selective breeding *IS* evidence for evolution, in that it demonstrates change in allele frequency over time. This is the entire definition of evolution, and it is an observed fact. Artificial selection is one confirmation of that fact.<br>  <br>  In nature, the selection process is based on the ability to successfully reproduce. In artificial selection, however, the ability to reproduce is controlled by man, based on traits that we deem important, such as crop yield, insect resistance or whatever.<br>  <br>  In both cases over the course of several generations, alleles favored by the selection process (whether natural or artificial) will increase in frequency, while those which are not favored will decrease.|`|jmlAmr3gaa	Selective breeding IS part of evolution's definition, so if you see that, then of course that is part of the evidence.<br>  <br>  That's only one part of the process, though, and not the most important one.  Adaptation/mutation is probably the most important aspect, but it all works together.<br>  <br>  There's a lot more to evolution than people usually understand --- so much, that it was recently said that Darwin, who invented the original idea of natural selection, "had to die" before evolution would be accepted.  In other words, that too many people have a primitive understanding of evolution from the original idea, and not a modern understanding of the whole field of science (genetics etc.) that its become.<br>  <br>  A much better "evidence" of evolution is to actually watch it happening, in viruses or fruit flies, or in artificially intelligent computer systems (genetic algorithms) that use it every day to "breed" programs that can fly planes, etc.|`|QJ5Lh3wUaa	It isn't.  It is an analogy.  Darwin used this analogy (particularly with regard to pigeons which were popular domestic animals in the Victorian era).<br>  <br>  Quoting from my article (link below):<br>  <br>  The main concept behind natural selection is actually surprisingly simple (although it does have complex and fascinating implications) - that organisms with heritable traits that are helpful to successful reproduction, will tend to predominate over organisms without such beneficial heritable traits, and thus, over successive generations, beneficial heritable traits will tend to become more common in any population. To explain this concept, Darwin used an analogy of selective breeding - pigeon breeders, over just a few centuries, have been able to produce a great variety of different domestic pigeons by selecting for particular heritable traits - and similarly he argued that nature, over many millions of years, could produce a great variety of different organisms, by its own form of selection.|`|FisVYasvaa	It's not.

q4XSkBQFaa	Although an MRI can pick up on scar tissue, such as intestinal adhesions left by prior abdominal surgeries, without some sort of attributable symptom the scan would be entirely elective.

Your brain is trained to look for clues for depth, and finds them, and constructs a 3-D model.  You can call the model in your head an illusion if you want.  It's pretty real for me.  And a movie adds the dimension of time.  And, it wouldn't matter in the slightest if my brain were a 2-D computer.  The model would still be 3-D.<br>  <br>  A 3-D movie is also projected onto a 2-D surface.  And some trick, perhaps red and blue, or alternate polarization (one for each eye), is used to give your brain more clues that it can readily use to construct a 3-D model.  Then time is added.  If a normal movie is 4-D for me, a 3-D movie is even more 4-D for me.<br>  <br>  A hologram is a representation of a 3-D volume encoded on a 2-D surface.  And holographic movies are possible already.  You can walk around them and see the back.  It's hard to imagine getting more 4-D than that.<br>  <br>  And then finally, it appears that the Universe may in fact be a hologram, with all the information of a volume residing at the surface of that volume.  Volumes can be arbitrary.  What goes on inside is 3-D plus time.<br>  <br>  So, the answer is yes.  It's 2-D, 3-D and 4-D. Get over it.|`|jmlAmr3gaa	No, it becomes 3-dimensional: 2 cartesian dimensions (X, Y), plus a time dimension.

If you're speaking about the difference between a 2D cartoon and a 3D animation like Toy Story, there's no strict fourth dimension.<br>  <br>  However the other answer about the third dimension in a cartoon being time is correct - a different kind of 3D that still qualifies.  In the same way, Toy Story (in the computer, not on the 2D screen) has length, bredth, and depth - and the time makes it technically four dimensional.<br>  <br>  Interesting question!|`|VoQN7ADvaa	No. 4 dimensional refers only to tangible things with dimensions.

63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	Allergies to cats is actually allergies to a combination of the cats saliva and dead skin or dander.  When a cat grooms itself it deposits a thin layer of this mixture which drys and becomes airborne. This is deposited everywhere so when a person reacts to this it is a combination of the dander in the room as well as that still on the cat.  Wild cats kept in captivity would also have this dander/saliva combination but it would be different than that of a house cat.  So you may not be allergic to the wild cat or if you were if it was not in a house where you were exposed to the accumulation from the cat living there you may also not be affected.|`|rU7ZjIHKaa	Its possible, especially if you are allergic to many different kinds of animals or plants. Of course, its also possible that you are only allergic to the domestic house cat, and not the tiger. The good thing is, you probably won't be able to get as close to a tiger for as long to find out if you are allergic.|`|uPVnqbE8aa	It depends on what your allergy is based on.  If it's the fur that creates it, then no, you would probably not be allergic to the fur of the bigger cats, because they don't actually have fur.  It's more like hair and much coercer than that of domestic house cats, and does not create the dander that house cats do.
X0e6p9Ilaa	Individual chemical bonds can be polar when there is an electronegativity difference greater than 0.30    But just because a molecule may contain polar bonds, the molecule itself may not be polar.  <br>  <br>  A polar molecule has a "net dipole moment".  That means that the individual polar bonds don't cancel out.  That in turn depends on the molecular geometry.  Molecular geometry is the single most important factor in determining molecular polarity.  Even molecules in which the individual bonds are nonpolar can be polar.  The classic example is O3.  The molecule is bent and has a net dipole moment.<br>  <br>  H2O is polar.  As predicted by VSEPR theory, H2O is bent (at about 105 degrees) because it has two bonding pairs of electrons and two lone pairs.   The H-O bonds are polar, but because the molecule is bent, they don't cancel each other out, and the molecule has a net dipole moment.<br>  <br>  CO2 is nonpolar.  As predicted by VSEPR theory, CO2 is linear.  The polar C=O bonds cancel each other out, leaving the CO2 molecule with a net dipole moment of zero.  Therefore, it is nonpolar.<br>  <br>  ========= Follow up ==========<br>  <br>  While J.B. may be a nerd, I must respectfully say that there is more to molecular geometry than the mere bond polarity.|`|c88Z21chaa	A polar molecule just has a big unevenness in electron distribution. Water is polar because the electrons like to stay near the oxygen, meaning the oxygen end of the molecule is slightly negative and the hydrogen end is slightly positive.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|FisVYasvaa	When one atom in a covalent bond has a higher electronegativity, the shared electron pair is drawn closer to that atom, causing a partial negative charge on that side(pole) of the molecule.  This makes the other pole partially positive, so it has a negative pole and a positive pole, making a "polar" molecule.<br>  <br>  If the electronegativities are the same, the shared electron pair will stay in the middle. There will be no partial charge and no negative and positive poles. This molecule in "non-polar".

cWuumdy7aa	Hyperconjugation in organic chemistry is the stabilizing interaction that results from the interaction of the electrons in a sigma bond (usually C-H or C-C) with an adjacent empty (or partially filled) non-bonding p-orbital or antibonding π orbital or filled π orbital to give an extended molecular orbital that increases the stability of the system.Only electrons in bonds that are β to the positively charged carbon can stabilize a carbocation by hyperconjugation.<br>  Hyperconjugation can be used for rationalizing a variety of other chemical phenomena, including the anomeric effect, the gauche effect, the rotational barrier of ethane, the beta-silicon effect, the vibrational frequency of exocyclic carbonyl groups, and the relative stability of substituted carbocations. Hyperconjugation is proposed by quantum mechanical modeling to be the correct explanation for the preference of the staggered conformation rather than the old textbook notion of steric hindrance<br>  Hyperconjugation has an effect on several chemical properties <br>  <br>  Bond length: Hyperconjugation is suggested as a key factor in shortening of sigma bonds (σ bonds) in such systems. For example, the single C-C bonds in 1,3-butadiene and methylacetylene are approximately 1.46 angstrom in length, much less than the value (1.54 angstrom) found in saturated hydrocarbons. This is due mainly to hyperconjugation that gives partial double-bond character of the bond. <br>  Dipole moments: The large increase in dipole moment of 1,1,1-trichloroethane as compared with chloroform can be attributed to hyperconjugated structures. <br>  The heat of formation of such molecules are greater than sum of their bond energies; and the heats of hydrogenation per double bond are less than the heat of hydrogenation of ethylene. <br>  Stability of carbocations: <br>  (CH3)3C+ > (CH3)2CH+ > (CH3)CH2+ > CH3+ <br>  The C-C σ bond adjacent to the cation is free to rotate, and as it does so, the three C-H σ bonds of the methyl group in turn undergoes the stabilization interaction. The more adjacent C-H bonds are, the larger hyperconjugation stabilization is.|`|sD7zLRzdaa	it happens when every second carbon-carbon bond is a double bond.|`|UFGLgXLbaa	hyper conjugation occurs when the carbon chain has a carbon atom involved in double bond or it has an unshared p orbital for example in carbo cations.
sD7zLRzdaa	Conjugation is the process of electron delocalization.  this occurs when pi electrons are not restricted to a single molecular orbital.  For example, pi-electrons in benzene are free to move right around the ring.  This is because the pi-bonds are conjugated, or joined together.  <br>  (Hyper just means more than two, or many)<br>  Atoms are not joined together by lines, but thats how we draw molecules.  We tend to draw double bonds alternating around the benzene ring, but we could equally well draw these bonds in their alternate positions.  Neither representation is correct.  the electrons are not located between any two particular atoms.  so we draw both picutes and link them with a double headed arrow.  each sketch is a snapshot of where the pi electrons might be.  That is to say, each sketch is of a resonance form of the true structure.
ERx11AsCaa	Sweating is the bodies inbuilt cooling system. If we didn't have it we would die. This is why we have sweat glands all over or body.<br>  <br>  On a humid day when the air is moist our sweat does not evaporate easily. Hence we feel hotter. <br>  <br>  Take for instance when you are in a sauna. You sit there and begin to feel hot. As you heat you begin to sweat. The air in the sauna absorbs the sweat, however due to the moisture or humidity in the air, the air near our skin remains hot and moist. <br>  <br>  When there is no way for the humidity to escape or there is no dry air to replace it, we continue to feel hot and clammy and we sweat more and the humidity continues.<br>  <br>  Whilst sitting in the sauna, if we added a fan to take out the moist air the effect would be different. We would feel dry and hot. We would begin to feel hot, we would sweat and due to the fan the moisture from the sauna and our sweat would be carried away due to the fan. The air in the sauna and near our skin would remain dry and we then would feel dry and hot.|`|De4vgWXPaa	The released water happens to cool the skin.|`|ErZV9ZGvaa	Sweating helps you lose heat by evaporation, the warm water from your body evaporates leaving you cooler.<br>  <br>  On a humid day the moisture content in the air is already very high making it hard for the sweat to evaporate from your skin leaving you feeling hot and sticky.<br>  <br>  On a hot dry day the sweat easily evaporates.|`|1RqPa4RJaa	it uses up a lot of energy.<br>  lots of energy to release the sweat, and lots of energy in the sweat (That's why it's warm). then from there, evaporative cooling comes into effect.|`|sA7Zhk3Gaa	The water evaporates, taking away the latent heat for vaporisation away from your body, thus helping you to cool :]

Especially in peanuts, peas, and beans, this behaviour is most widespread in the grass family, though the largest genus of cleistogamous plants is actually Viola.<br>  <br>  For genetically modified (GM) rapeseed, researchers hoping to minimise the admixture of GM and non-GM crops are attempting to use cleistogamy to prevent gene flow. However, preliminary results from Co-Extra, a current project within the EU research programme, show that although cleistogamy reduces gene flow, it is not at the moment a consistently reliable tool for biocontainment: due to a certain instability of the cleistogamous trait, some flowers may open and release genetically modified pollen.|`|jipqICzVaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleistogamy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleistogamy</a><br>  <br>  Good old wiki.|`|2lQ8DJAcaa	In botany, when the flowers of a plant have, in addition to the ordinary fully developed flowers, others in which development is arrested in the bud, but which are still fertile and produce an abundance of seed. These latter flowers are nonopening, inconspicuous, and without petals, nectaries, or fragrance. They have small anthers containing few pollen grains and have a much-reduced pistil. They are necessarily self-fertilized, but are always fertile, whereas the more perfect flowers of the same plant are often nearly or completely sterile. Cleistogamy is known to occur in about 60 genera belonging to many very different families, chiefly dicotyledonous. The violet is a familiar instance. Also spelled clistogamy.

mlAwNRWhaa	Basically there are two kinds of marine organisms that form coral reefs. These are algae and polyps.Algae are plants that take water and minerals directly into their cells from the water. They need sunlight to survive and are thus found in tropical waters. They form lime coatings on the rocks of coral reefs that help polyps to make calcium carbonate to form shells and skeletons.<br>  <br>  A coral polyp actually reproduces in using either of the two following ways:<br>  <br>  * One way can be to divide its own body to make two polyps<br>  <br>  * The other way is to produce sperm and eggs <br>  <br>  The eggs and sperm come out from coral polyps at the time just after the full moon in the month of November. They keep floating for about a few days. There are a small number of eggs that get fertilized, originate into larvae and then get settled on the reef. Once they get settled, they start together to begin new colonies. The colonies formed by polyps grow fast. You may be amazed to not e the fact that in three years one polyp can make a colony of 25,000 polyps!

JORlaaOkaa	well, to answer your first question, i really couldn't tell you how the job market looks upon age. some may see it as an advantage, others as a disadvantage. however, it is NEVER too late to learn! <br>  <br>  The dream job you describe would indicate that you are heading toward being a design engineer. their job is to be given a situation or scenario, and come up with an idea or concept to solve the problem. implementing it is down to the engineer. designers are to engineers as architects are to civil engineers, and designers (while still generally proficient in science) rarely have a hand in implementing the idea. however, there are varying types of designer, and each designer usually has the relevant knowledge to what they are doing, example, the designer for a car will have a background in mechanical engineering. so to be a designer of some sort as a career, you will want to obtain the relevant degree or recognised qualification, either a BSc or BA, the difference being the latter focuses on ergonomics, while the former on technical design. the former will however require more training in the relevant field. there are also different types of qualifications within design, like just Design, Product Design, Industrial Design, etc. its a broad subject, and you may want to think about specifically what types of problems you want to be solving.<br>  <br>  as far as jobs go, the 9 to 5 job is typical as a design engineer. im not entirely sure how flexible with hours jobs are, but i would imagine it varies from job to job. <br>  <br>  and finally, as far as computer experience goes, it will prove invaluable, as designers need to know how to use CAD packages, and if you already know your way around computers, you will pick this up faster than others. <br>  <br>  i hope i was of some use to you, and good luck with the career move.|`|auutlO2zaa	Yes, I think a lot of people do it.<br>  <br>  I am a student of engineering and have noticed a far few 40 yr olds in my classes, probably doing the same thing you want to do.<br>  <br>  I am 20 years old and find that a lot of the older guys have very good insight and experience that us "youngsters" love to hear and acknowledge their experience.
RLUy7KcEaa	Fingerprints are formed in the lower layers of the skin.  The top layers are frequently discarded (skin peels right?  Ever get a sunburn? same idea) Any trauma to the fingertips need to be incredibly deep for fingerprints to go away.  Otherwise, your body heals, and when the skin is reforming, it kinda relayers on top of each other, and you will keep the same ridges and valleys that form a fingerprint.  Scarring can occur in which the fingerprint will look different, but as long as an expert can look at it, know the scarring ocurred after the item the "new" print is being compared to, then some discrepencies (like scarring, cuts, etc) can still warrant a correct identification.|`|NIb8zWEHaa	if recovers yes but if scars are produced no impression anymore|`|WX1b747Iaa	But then if he scars his fingerprints sufficiently, the authorities will flag him forever as having criminal intent.|`|DT6QFP7Yaa	Not possible.If the thumb is slightly burnt ,then there is a possibility of healing.But if severely burnt, then there is no possibility of healing.However,even if the wounds heal,the lines will not reappear n one will never be able to give thumb impression.|`|AA12139405	Now the forefinger impression is also sufficient to identify a person.|`|GQZDcfUiaa	It all depends on how deep the burn goes.

2lQ8DJAcaa	The origin of our earth's atmosphere is still subject to much speculation.<br>  <br>  One theory seems fairly certain; that when the earth was formed some five billion years ago, it was probably too hot to retain any of the atmosphere it had to begin with. Based on our knowledge of gases in the universe, this first atmosphere probably consisted of helium, hydrogen, ammonia and methane.<br>  <br>  If we assume that volcanoes five billion years ago emitted the same gasses as they do today, the earth's second atmosphere probably consisted of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. These gasses were expelled from the earth's interior by a process known as outgassing.<br>  <br>  The vast amounts of water vapor expelled by the volcanic earth resulted in the formation of clouds which, in turn, produced rain. Over a period of thousands of years, the rain accumulated as rivers and lake and ocean basins.<br>  <br>  The water reservoirs acted as sinks for the large amounts of carbon dioxide (as they do today) and through chemical and biological processes became locked up in sedimentary rocks as limestone.<br>  <br>  The nitrogen, which is not very chemically active continued to accumulate in the atmosphere.<br>  <br>  While oxygen currently makes up 21 percent of the atmosphere, there was only a trace in the air when life first appeared on the planet. The single-celled bacterium dwelling in the oceans did not need oxygen to live. Oxygen first appeared in the environment when early bacteria developed the ability to split water molecules apart by harnessing the energy of sunlight - a key part of photosynthesis. Photosynthesizing organisms produced the oxygen that accumulated over geologic time.<br>  <br>  These processes acting sequentially and simultaneously appear to have produced the delicate balance of 78% nitrogen (N2) and 21% oxygen (O2) we observe today.<br>  Source(s):<br>  ess.geology.ufl.edu/HTMLpages/ESS/GLY1...<br>  3 months ago|`|WbVE1cXKaa	Ultimately, the atmosphere formed from the degassing of the earth.  That is, when the earth formed, it was a mish-mash of rock and ice and everything else floating around in space after a star went nova.  <br>  <br>  over time, this highly mixed state of the earth evolved, differentiated, separated according to the chemistry of the different elements.  Some elements tended to migrate toward the surface, others toward the center.  The gaseous elements and compounds tended to migrate toward the surface.  They got expelled from volcanoes and accumulated around the solids underneath,<br>  <br>  During the early period of development, the earth had no magnetic field.  the iron core had not formed yet (takes time for the iron to migrate down, just as it takes time for the gases to migrate up).  The solar wind tended to blow away the gases in the atmosphere, so the very early earth tended to be more like the moon, with essentially no atmosphere.<br>  <br>  Eventually, the core formed and made a magnetic field to protect the earth from the solar wind.  Once this had occurred, the gases being expelled out of the inside of the earth started to accumulate and formed the atmosphere (and oceans).  This degassing still occurs today, just at a slower rate than in the early stages of the earth's history.<br>  <br>  The early atmosphere was chemically quite different from today.  The gases tended to be reduced species like methane, hydrogen sulfide, and so forth.  Plant activity changed this chemistry by producing oxygen.  It took a couple billion years for plants to convert the reducing atmosphere into the oxidizing atmosphere that exists today.<br>  <br>  And that is the short story of the atmosphere according to the dominant ideas of the sciences that are generally accepted today.|`|J3TGyOnDaa	The solar nebula, volcanic action, and the evolution of photosynthesis from cyanobacteria stromatolites through angiosperms (flowering plants), which take in CO2 and give off O2.

Study after study provides strong evidence that exercise plays a major role in lifting mood, boosting energy, improving immune function, reducing stress, anxiety and insomnia, increasing sex drive and elevating self-esteem. <br>  <br>  EAT HEALTHY BALANCED DIET. Consider consulting a nutritionist who can suggest foods that will positively impact mood, energy level or help treat (or at least not worsen) any other conditions.<br>  <br>  FIND A "CENTERING PRACTICE.” Dr. Richard Mackenzie of Childrens Hospital Los Angeles recommends exercises such as yoga or meditation to get in touch with your inner compass, find equilibrium, reduce stress, stabilize mood swings and relax.<br>  <br>  GET YOUR HORMONE SYSTEM TESTED. “Everybody should make sure they have a very thorough evaluation of their nutritional status, hormones, minerals, vitamins and immune system,” says Hedaya, “to enhance possibilities of reducing dosage or going off medicine.” Treatable hormone imbalances like an underactive thyroid or deficiencies of amino acids and minerals can rob you of energy, sexual vitality and feelings of well-being.<br>  <br>  CONSIDER VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS. Hedaya reports success in patients coming off Efexor, for example, by taking 25-50 mg. of Vitamin B6 daily. He notes, however, that excessive doses on a prolonged basis can be toxic.<br>  <br>  TURN TO FRINDS AND FAMILY. “These are people who have been in a patient’s life far longer than a therapist,” says Glenmullen, “and will continue to be there long after therapy is complete.” Glenmullen also suggests making use of community resources such as church or support groups.<br>  <br>  .Fire the bad people in your life<br>  .Live in the present <br>  .Begin focusing on yourself<br>  .Learn to say no <br>  .Don't be too proud to ask for help|`|71fSlHuPaa	First of all I would get your doctor's advice on doing this, might be a bad reaction, just like the one you described.

I thought I would be dependant on anti-d's for life but now I have learned you can increase serotonin levels with 5-htp naturally and Now I feel better than I have in years and thank 5-htp for it.

Pressure differences, density differences, and particularly temperature differences, all tend to equalize if given the opportunity. This means that an isolated system will eventually come to have a uniform temperature. A thermodynamic engine is an engine that provides useful work from the difference in temperature of two bodies. Since any thermodynamic engine requires such a temperature difference, it follows that no useful work can be derived from an isolated system in equilibrium, there must always be energy fed from the outside.

AA10751518	Greenhouse effect is when gases like CO2 are accumilated in the earth's atmosphere and cause over heating by  not allowing unused heat to go back up. Too much CO2 acts as a blanket around the earth and traps heat released through different processes, causing over heating of the earth's atomosphere called global warming.|`|AA10312527	Greenhouse effect: <br>  In our atmosphere, we have something called greenhouse gasses. They exist naturally, and two examples of greenhouse gasses are water vapour and carbon dioxide (there are several more of them). The greenhouse gasses make sure that some of the heat that is emitted from the earth stays within our atmosphere. If there were no greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, all the heat from the earth would radiate out into space. This would mean that the average temperature of earth would be -18 degrees Celsius (0 degrees Farenheit) instead of +15 deg C (60 deg F). That's a huge difference - I doubt that there would be human life on the planet earth without the greenhouse effect!<br>  <br>  Global warming: <br>  When people talk about global warming, they usually mean that the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere increases. Some people say that changes occur naturally, some people say it's because we pollute the air with carbon dioxide etc. Many scientists believe that an increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere would mean that more of the heat from the earth would stay in our atmosphere, giving an increase in the average temperature on earth. Rising temperatures could mean, for instance, that some of the polar ice melts, causing flooding in coastal countries.<br>  <br>  So:<br>  Greenhouse effect - a good thing<br>  Global warming - possibly bad|`|3332a4264f2e7d104e1ff8f23cd9a9c6aa	In this universe thre r sum gases that absorb th heat(or more specifically th infrared rays of sun)n do not allow 2 escape it.These gases are called greenhouse gases n th heating effect they create is called greenhouse effect.<br>  <br>  If these gases accumulate in th atmosphere they raise th temperature of th surrounding tremendously.This way they create greenhouse effect.<br>  <br>  Th greenhouse effect created by them causes global warming i.e<br>  raising of temperature in th surrounding.<br>  <br>  eg. of greenhouse gas-CO2.|`|4353f94fc6818f432f4f6124dbdfb644aa	The greenhouse effect is caused by gases that trap heat from the Sun for longer. It is just one possible cause of global warming and is affected by human behaviour.<br>  <br>  Other causes of global warming include variations in the Sun's output. It is known that the Sun is hotter now than it has been since about 1000 years ago. This has nothing to do with human activity and is often ignored in discussions. We cannot predict the variations in the Sun at all well.<br>  <br>  Also, there are natural fluctuations in temperature due to predicable changes in the earth's orbit and axial tilt. These effects are called the Milankovitch cycles and cause ice ages. The cycles are 100,000, 41,000 and about 23,000 years. We are nearly due for another ice age.|`|55915544c887fc2f6b532b66d13b870faa	Due to air pollution certain gases such as CO2, NO2 , etc are produced in excess this excess production of these gases which are called greenhouse gases is known as greenhouse effect.

It is assumed to be plants kept in glass cafe where it can allow only one way of ray penetration. This phenomenon is called global warming which leads to rise in temperature of earth surface more than 1 degree c by every year and also leads to polar ice caps melts, submergence of land due to rise in coastal areas etc.

These maps describe the shape of the land. They define and locate natural and manmade features like woodlands, waterways, important buildings, and bridges. They show the distance between any two places, and they also show the direction from one point to another.<br>  <br>  Distances and directions take a bit of figuring, but the topography and features of the land are easy to determine. The topography is shown by contours. These are imaginary lines that follow the ground surface at a constant elevation; they are usually printed in brown, in two thicknesses. The heavier lines are called index contours, and they are usually marked with numbers that give the height in feet or meters. The contour interval, a set difference in elevation between the brown lines, varies from map to map; its value is given in the margin of each map. Contour lines that are close together represent steep slopes.<br>  <br>  Natural and manmade features are represented by colored areas and by a set of standard symbols on all U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps. Woodlands, for instance, are shown in a green tint; waterways, in blue. Buildings may be shown on the map as black squares or outlines. Recent changes in an area may be shown by a purple overprint. a road may be printed in red or black solid or dashed lines, depending on its size and surface. A list of symbols is available from the Earth Science Information Center (ESIC).<br>  <br>  From Here to There - Determining Direction With Compass<br>  <br>  The compass consists of a magnetized metal needle that floats on a pivot point.  The needle orients to the magnetic field lines of the earth.  The basic orienteering compass is composed of the following parts:<br>  <br>      * Base plate<br>      * Straight edge and ruler<br>      * Direction of travel arrow<br>      * Compass housing with 360 degree markings<br>      * North label<br>      * Index line<br>      * Orienting arrow<br>      * Magnetic needle (north end is red)<br>  <br>  Compass<br>  <br>  To determine the direction, or bearing, from one point to another, you need a compass as well as a map. Most compasses are marked with the four cardinal points —north, east, south, and west—but some are marked additionally with the number of degrees in a circle (360 north is 0 or 360, east is 90, south is 180, and west is 270). Both kinds are easy to use with a little practice. The illustrations on the reverse side show how to read direction on the map.<br>  <br>  One thing to remember is that a compass does not really point to true north, except by coincidence in some areas. The compass needle is attracted by magnetic force, which varies in different parts of the world and is constantly changing. When you read north on a compass, you're really reading the direction of the magnetic north pole. A diagram in the map margin will show the difference (declination) at the center of the map between compass north (magnetic north indicated by the MN symbol) and true north (polar north indicated by the "star" symbol). This diagram also provides the declination between true north and the orientation of the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid north (indicated by the GN symbol). The declination diagram is only representational, and true values of the angles of declination should be taken from the numbers provided rather than from the directional lines. Because the magnetic declination is computed at the time the map is made, and because the position of magnetic north is constantly changing, the declination factor provided on any given map may not be current. Contact the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) to obtain current and historical magnetic declination information for any place in the United States.<br>  <br>  Taking a compass bearing from a map:<br>  <br>      * Draw a straight line on the map passing through your location and your destination and extending across any one of the map borders.<br>      * Center the compass where your drawn line intersects the map border, align the compass axis N-S or E-W with the border line, and read on the compass circle the true bearing of your drawn line. Be careful to get the bearing in the correct sense because a straight line will have two values 180° apart. Remember north is 0, east is 90, and so on.<br>      * To use this bearing, you must compensate for magnetic declination. If the MN arrow on the map magnetic declination diagram is to the right of the true north line, subtract the MN value.  If the arrow is to the left of the line, add the value.<br>  <br>                 Showing a section of a topographic map and drawing a straight line from the point to the map edge<br>  <br>                       (1) Drawing a straight line over the map edge<br>  Showing a section of a topographic map with the compass aligned along the drawn line to read the compass on the map<br>  <br>  (2) Reading the compass on the map<br>  Showing the negative magnetic declination diagram from a topographic map(3) Using the magnetic declination diagrams Showing the positive magnetic declination diagram from a topographic map<br>  What is North?<br>  <br>      * True North: (also known as Geographic North or Map North) is the geographic north pole where all longitude lines meet.  All maps are laid out with true north directly at the top. Unfortunately for the wilderness traveler, true north is not at the same point on the earth as the magnetic north Pole which is where your compass points.<br>      * Magnetic North: Think of the earth as a giant magnet (it is actually). The shape of the earth's magnetic field is roughly the same shape as the field of a bar magnet.   However, the earth's magnetic field is inclined at about 11° from the axis of rotation of the earth, so this means that the earth's magnetic pole doesn't correspond to the Geographic North Pole and because the earth's core is molten, the magnetic field is always shifting slightly. The red end of your compass needle is magnetized and wherever you are, the earth's magnetic field causes the needle to rotate until it lies in the same direction as the earth's magnetic field. This is magnetic north (marked as MN on a topographic map). The picture below shows the magnetic lines for the United States.   If you locate yourself at any point in the U.S., your compass will orient itself parallel to the lines of magnetic force in that area.<br>  <br>  U.S. Magnetic Declination<br>  Declination<br>  <br>  You can see that location makes a great deal of difference in where the compass points. The angular difference between true north and magnetic north is known as the declination and is marked in degrees on your map.  Depending on where you are, the angle between true north and magnetic north is different.  In the U.S., the angle of declination varies from about 20 degrees west in Maine to about 21 degrees east in Washington.  The magnetic field lines of the earth are constantly changing, moving slowly westward (?to 1 degree every five years). This is why it is important to have a recent map. An old map will show a declination that is no longer accurate, and all your calculations using that declination angle will be incorrect. As you will see, understanding this distinction becomes important when navigating with a map and a compass.  More on declination below...<br>  Which North to Use<br>  <br>  So we have two types of north to contend with. When you look at your map, it is drawn in relation to true north;, when you look at your compass, it points to magnetic north. T to make the map and compass work together you must decide on one North as your point of reference and base all your calculations on that. As you can see the following chart, failure to take declination into account can put you way off target.<br>  Declination or Degrees Off Course Error Off Target after Walking 10 Miles<br>  1° 920 feet (280meters)<br>  5° 4,600 feet (1,402 meters)<br>  10° 9,170 feet (2,795 meters)<br>  Using Map and Compass<br>  What's your Map Declination?<br>  <br>  The first thing you need to know is where you are in relation to magnetic north. You can find this information by looking on your map legend.  If you look at a map of North America you will see the line roughly marking 0° declination.  If you are on the line where the declination is 0 degrees, then you don't have to worry about any of this, since magnetic north and map north are equivalent.   If you are to the right of that line, your compass will point toward the line (to the left) and hence the declination is to the west. If you are to the left of the line, your compass will point toward the line (to the right) and hence the declination is to the east.<br>  Bearings:<br>  <br>  The compass is used primarily to take bearings.  A bearing is a horizontal angle measured clockwise from north (either magnetic north or true north) to some point (either a point on a map or a point in the real world).  Bearings are used to accurately travel to a destination or to locate your position.  If you are working from your map, it is called a map bearing and the angle you are measuring is the angle measured clockwise from true north on your map to this other point on the map.  If you are taking a bearing off a real point on the landscape with a compass, you are using your compass to measure the angle clockwise from magnetic north to this point on the landscape.  This is called a magnetic bearing.   Remember that the bearing is measured clockwise. If you think of true north as 12 o'clock then a bearing to the right of that (1 o'clock) is greater than true north and a bearing to the left of True north (11 o'clock) is less than true north.<br>  <br>  Taking a Bearing<br>  Adjusting Your Compass for the Local Declination:<br>  <br>  Another way to deal with declination is to adjust your compass. Some compasses have an outer degree ring that can be unlocked either with a set screw or a latch. This allows you to reset the compass to account for declination. For example, if the declination were 14 degrees East, you could rotate the degree dial to the right so that the magnetic needle was pointing to 14 degrees instead of 360 degrees. Once you do this, you will no longer have to add or subtract for declination because your compass is aligned to true north. Now when the compass needle is inside the orienting needle, the compass bearing that you read off your compass will be in relation to true north instead of magnetic north. If you have a fixed-ring compass, you can mark the declination angle on the compass ring with a piece of tape.<br>  Check Your Position Regularly<br>  <br>  Make it a habit of keeping your map and compass handy and refer to them every hour or so to locate your position (more often in low visibility).  Keep track of your starting time, rest breaks and lunch stops, and general hiking pace.  This will also give you an idea of how far you have traveled.<br>  <br>  What If You Get Lost?<br>  Triangulation:<br>  <br>  Triangulation is used to locate your position when two or more prominent landmarks are visible. Even if you are not sure where you are, you can find your approximate position as long as you can identify at least 2 prominent landmarks (mountain, end of a lake, bridge, etc.) both on the land and on your map.<br>  <br>     1. Orient the map.<br>     2. Look around and locate prominent landmarks.<br>     3. Find the landmarks on the map (preferably at least 90 degrees apart).<br>     4. Determine the bearing of one of the landmarks.<br>     5. Place the compass on the map so that one side of the base plate points toward the landmark.<br>     6. Keeping the edge of the base plate on the symbol, turn the entire compass on the map until the orienting arrow and the compass needle point to north on the map.<br>     7. Draw a line on the map along the edge of the base plate, intersecting the prominent landmark symbol. Your position is somewhere along this line.<br>     8. Repeat this procedure for the other prominent landmark. The second landmark should be as close to 90 degrees from the first as possible. Your approximate position is where the two lines intersect.<br>     9. You can repeat this process a third time to show an area bounded by three lines. You are located within this triangle.<br>    10. If you are located on a prominent feature marked on the map such as a ridge, stream, or road, only one calculation from a prominent landmark should be necessary. Your position will be approximately where the drawn line intersects this linear feature.<br>  <br>  Triangulation<br>  <br>  Compass Glossary<br>  <br>  Here are some definitions that will make it easier to understand the compass:<br>  <br>      * adjustable compass - a compass whose azimuth circle can be rotated relative to the lubber's line.<br>  <br>      * azimuth circle - a circular compass scale graduated in angular units: degrees, cardinal points, or other units, usually clockwise from north or 0°.<br>  <br>      * bearing - the angular direction to a landmark.<br>  <br>      * boxing mark - a box, arrow, line, or other mark permanently fixed to point to the N or 0° index on a compass azimuth circle. The boxing mark is usually part of the capsule. To "box" a compass, align the compass needle or card with the boxing mark, north-to-north, or with N or 0° on the azimuth circle.<br>  <br>      * capsule - a sealed transparent case which houses the compass needle, the azimuth circle, and the boxing mark. The capsule may be filled with liquid to amp needle or card swinging.<br>  <br>      * card - an azimuth circle mounted on a compass needle. The card rotates relative to the lubber's line.<br>  <br>      * course - angular direction of travel.<br>  <br>      * fix - the position indicated by the intersection of two or more lines of bearing.<br>  <br>      * landmark - a recognizable real object in the terrain.<br>  <br>      * lubber's line - a line or mark on the compass body that points toward the direction of travel. Simple compasses may use north or 0o on the azimuth circle as a lubber's line. On sighting compasses the sight centerline is the lubber's line.<br>  <br>      * magnetic declination - easterly or westerly angular difference between the direction to the earth's geometric and magnetic poles.<br>  <br>      * magnetic inclination - the vertical component of the earth's magnetic field which causes compasses needles to dip.<br>  <br>      * map object - a picture or symbol used on a map to represent a landmark or other object.<br>  <br>      * needle - a magnetized pointer resting on a pivot in the capsule, free to rotate relative to the lubber's line and azimuth circle.<br>  <br>      * north - grid north: the direction to the earth's geometric north pole along a meridian.<br>  <br>      * north - magnetic north: the apparent direction to the earth's magnetic north pole, not usually indicated by a grid on maps. This net magnetic north comprises all the magnetic effects acting on your compass.<br>  <br>      * true north: the direction to the earth's geographic north pole, indicated in life approximately by Polaris; indicated on maps by DMS scales and tick marks along the map borders.<br>  <br>      * orienteering compass - an adjustable compass with special features that make it more convenient to use in the field with maps.<br>  <br>      * orienting lines - visible lines in the capsule engraved parallel to the boxing mark; used as reference lines when marking angles on the map with an orienting compass.<br>  <br>      * sighting compass - a compass with a mirror or peep sight aligned with the lubber's line.<br>  <br>      * simple compass - a compass with the lubber's line fixed at north or 0°, and a fixed azimuth circle.<br>  <br>  A Word of Caution<br>  <br>  Compass readings are also affected by the presence of iron and steel objects.

J.-C. et mort à Syracuse en 212 av. J.-C.), est un grand scientifique Grec de Sicile (Grande Grèce) de l'Antiquité, physicien, mathématicien et ingénieur.<br>  <br>  La vie d'Archimède est peu connue, on ne sait pas par exemple s'il a été marié ou a eu des enfants. Les informations le concernant proviennent principalement de Plutarque (46 - 125), Tite-Live (59 – 17) ou bien encore pour le cas de l'anecdote de la baignoire, de Vitruve, un célèbre architecte romain. Ces écrits sont donc très postérieurs à la vie d'Archimède.<br>  <br>  Concernant les mathématiques, on a trace d'un certain nombre de publications, travaux et correspondances. Il a en revanche jugé inutile de consigner par écrit ses travaux d'ingénieur qui ne nous sont connus que par des tiers.<br>  <br>  Archimède serait né à Syracuse en 287 av. J.-C. Son père serait l'astronome Phidias qui aurait commencé son instruction. On suppose qu'il parachève ses études à la très célèbre école d'Alexandrie. Du moins, on est s?r qu'il en connaissait des professeurs puisqu'on a retrouvé des lettres qu'il aurait échangées avec eux.<br>  <br>  De la famille de Hiéron II, roi de Syracuse, (ici le terme de famille est à prendre au sens très large de quelqu'un de la maison de Hiéron), il entre à son service en qualité d'ingénieur et participe à la défense de la ville lors de la seconde guerre punique. Il meurt en 212 av. J.-C. lors de la prise de la ville par le Romain Marcellus.<br>  <br>  Archimède est un mathématicien, principalement géomètre, de grande envergure. Il s'est intéressé à la numération, cherchant, par exemple à dénombrer tous les grains de sable de l'univers. Le gros de ses travaux concerne la géométrie avec<br>  <br>  l'étude du cercle où il détermine une méthode d'approximation de π à l'aide de polyg?nes régulier et propose les approximations  et  <br>  l'étude des coniques en particulier la parabole dont il présente deux quadratures très originales. Il prolonge le travail d'Eudoxe sur la méthode d'exhaustion <br>  l'étude des aires et des volumes qui font de lui un précurseur dans le calcul qui ne s'appelle pas encore intégral. Il a travaillé en particulier sur le volume de la sphère et du cylindre et a demandé à ce que ces figures soient gravées sur sa tombe. ? Le rapport des volumes d'une sphère et d'un cylindre, si la sphère est tangente au cylindre par la face latérale et les deux bases, est égale à 2/3. ? <br>  l'étude de la spirale qui porte son nom dont il a aussi donné une quadrature. <br>  <br>  Archimède est considéré comme le père de la mécanique statique. Dans son traité, De l'équilibre des figures planes, il s'intéresse au principe du levier et à la recherche de centre de gravité.<br>  <br>  On lui attribue aussi le principe d'Archimède sur les corps plongés dans un liquide (Des corps flottant).<br>  <br>  Il a aussi travaillé sur l'optique (La catoptrique).<br>  <br>  Il met en pratique ses connaissances théoriques dans un grand nombre d'inventions. On lui doit, par exemple,<br>  <br>  des machines de traction où il démontre qu'à l'aide de poulies, de palans et de leviers, l'homme peut soulever bien plus que son poids <br>  des machines de guerre (principe de la meurtrière, catapultes, bras mécaniques utilisés dans le combat naval). <br>  Parmi les machines de guerres très importantes l'on doit souligner l'appareil à mesurer les distances qu'Archimède réalisa pour les Romains (odomètre). En effet pour que l'armée soit efficace, elle doit être reposée et les journées de marche doivent donc être identiques. La machine d'Archimède doit être réalisée avec des dents de rouage pointues et non carrées.On a mis très longtemps à la reconstituer car on faisait cette erreur.<br>  <br>  la vis sans fin et la vis d'Archimède, dont il rapporte, semble-t-il, le principe d'égypte et dont il se sert pour remonter de l'eau. On lui attribue aussi l'invention de la vis et de l'écrou. <br>  le principe de la roue dentée grace auquel il construit un planétaire représentait l'Univers connu à l'époque. <br>  <br>  Nous possédons un palimpseste connu sous le nom de manuscrit d'Archimède. Lors de l'étude de celui-ci, l'on s'aper?ut qu'Archimède avait la notion du calcul infinitésimal, chose très moderne et tout à fait nécessaire pour progresser en sciences. Il est rappelé que pour les anciens Grecs, Dieu est parfait parce que fini.<br>  <br>  Le génie d'Archimède en mécanique et en mathématique fait de lui un personnage exceptionnel de la Grèce antique et justifie la création à son sujet de faits légendaires. Ses admirateurs parmi lesquels Cicéron qui découvrit sa tombe, Plutarque qui relata sa vie, Léonard de Vinci, et plus tard Auguste Comte ont perpétué, enrichi les contes et légendes d’Archimède.<br>  <br>  à l'instar de tous les grands savants, la mémoire collective a associé une phrase, une fable transformant le découvreur en héros mythique : à Newton est associé la pomme, à Pasteur le petit Joseph Meister, à Albert Einstein la formule E = mc2. Pour Archimède, ce sera la phrase Eurêka ! (en grec : j'ai trouvé !) prononcée en courant nu à travers les rues de la ville alors qu'il venait de trouver l'explication de la poussée du même nom. Archimède venait enfin de trouver la solution à son problème : En effet, il était courant à cette époque que les rois en manque d'argent fondent leurs bijoux en or et découvrent que les présents qui leurs avaient été fait n'étaient en réalité que du plomb plaqué or ou un mélange d'or-argent ! Le roi avait chargé Archimède de trouver un moyen imparable pour éviter cette arnaque. C'est dans sa baignoire alors qu'il cherchait depuis longtemps qu'il trouva la solution, d'où sa joie ! Il put mesurer le volume de la couronne par immersion dans l'eau puis la peser afin de comparer sa masse volumique à celle de l'or massif.<br>  <br>  Lors de l'attaque de Syracuse, alors colonie grecque, par la flotte romaine, la légende veut qu'il ait mis au point des miroirs géants pour réfléchir et concentrer les rayons du soleil dans les voiles des navires romains et ainsi les enflammer. Cela semble scientifiquement peu probable car des miroirs suffisamment grands étaient techniquement inconcevables, le miroir argentique n'existant pas encore. Seuls des miroirs en bronze poli pouvaient être utilisés. Cependant, une expérience menée par des étudiants du MIT en octobre 2005 démontre que cette hypothèse est réaliste.<br>  <br>  L'historien Tite-Live (XXIV-34) décrit le r?le important d'Archimède comme ingénieur dans la défense de sa ville (aménagement des remparts, construction de meurtrières, construction de petits scorpions et différentes machines de guerre), mais il ne dit pas un mot de ces fameux miroirs. De même, il raconte la prise de Syracuse, organisée pendant la nuit non par crainte du soleil, mais pour profiter du relachement général lors de trois jours de festivités (généreusement arrosées) en l'honneur de la déesse Diane. (XXV-23)<br>  <br>  En -212, après plusieurs années de siège, les Romains auraient alors attendu une journée nuageuse pour s'emparer de la ville et la piller. Le général Marcellus souhaitait néanmoins épargner le savant. Malheureusement, selon Plutarque, un soldat romain croisa Archimède alors que celui-ci tra?ait des figures géométriques sur le sol, non conscient de la prise de la ville par l'ennemi. Troublé dans sa concentration par le soldat, Archimède lui aurait lancé ? Ne dérange pas mes cercles ? (mh moy tous kyclous tarate). Le soldat vexé de ne pas voir obtempérer le vieillard de 75 ans, l'aurait alors tué d'un coup d'épée. En hommage à son génie, Marcellus lui fit de grandes funérailles et fit dresser un tombeau décoré de sculptures représentant les travaux du disparu.|`|8459900a144bdd92d17fa2a87a4d3644aa	a fait une théorie des verres communicants|`|cc761884d12b843dbaecb4941bf9e088aa	Archimède<br>  <br>  Savant grec (Syracuse, 287 av. J.-C. - id., 212 av. J.-C.), fondateur de l'hydrostatique<br>  <br>  Fils de l'astronome Phidias, Archimède est très rapidement influencé par l'école d'Alexandrie. Après des voyages en Egypte et en Espagne, il s'installe définitivement à Syracuse. Protégé par le souverain et mis à l'abri des soucis matériels, il peut alors se consacrer à ses recherches scientifiques.<br>  <br>  Archimède est avant tout un géomètre. Dans son ouvrage Mesure du cercle, il élabore une méthode permettant de donner une approximation précise de p. En utilisant des polygones réguliers circonscrits et inscrits dans le cercle, il parvient à démontrer que p est compris entre 22/7 et 223/71. Il calcule également l'aire d'un segment de parabole, d'un secteur de spirale, et l'aire et le volume du cylindre et de la sphère. C'est aussi lui qui améliore le système numérique grec en y introduisant les exposants afin de représenter les grands nombres. Dans son traité Sur les sphéro?des et sur les cono?des, il étudie les parabolo?des et les ellipso?des. De plus, ses travaux sur les tangentes et les quadratures l'amènent à envisager le calcul différentiel et intégral.<br>  <br>  Formidable mathématicien, Archimède est aussi un brillant physicien. En mécanique, il est l'inventeur de la vis sans fin, du boulon formé d'une vis et d'un écrou et il découvre la roue dentée. Mais c'est avant tout par ses recherches en statique et en hydrostatique qu'Archimède se distingue. Dans son livre De l'équilibre des plans, il expose sa théorie du levier (deux corps s'équilibrent à des distances inversement proportionnelles à leur poids) et introduit la notion de centre de gravité. Il détermine notamment les barycentres de plusieurs figures géométriques. Enfin, dans son Traité des corps flottants, il élabore la célèbre loi : "tout corps plongé dans un fluide subit une poussée verticale, dirigée de bas en haut, égale au poids du fluide déplacé." La légende veut que le roi de Syracuse Hiéron II ait demandé au savant de savoir si la couronne fabriquée à sa demande était faite d'or pur ou d'un alliage d'or et d'argent. En réfléchissant au problème dans son bain, Archimède fut frappé par la diminution de poids de ses membres dans l'eau. Il comprit alors que cette perte de poids correspondait au poids de l'eau déplacée et, dans l'enthousiasme de sa découverte, s'élan?a dans la rue en criant " Eurêka ! Eurêka ! ".<br>  <br>  En 215 av. J.-C., Archimède organise la défense de Syracuse face à l'invasion des Romains lors de la seconde guerre punique. Durant trois ans, il fait construire des machines de guerre. Catapultes et miroirs ardents tiennent en échec l'armée romaine. Cependant, la ville est finalement envahie et Archimède est tué lors des combats.<br>  <br>  Les découvertes d'Archimède ont eu un impact considérable sur les sciences. Savant complet, il a non seulement établit de nouvelles théories mais a également élaboré une vraie méthode de démonstration.|`|ebfc786c112ce5dcb7e17edb2e27e454aa	Celui qui as dit : "Tout corps plongé dans un liquide en ressort mouillé", mais si!!!|`|1a25f6f3983112238e89d7ffc660de09aa	C'est pote à moi qui est toujours à ma droite quand je suis bourré|`|a306ee78addc04f7eb1dc875f3ff1c9baa	c'est moi|`|a516cfd6f93cbf9e33b4acc0e3f28b0aaa	La question serait plutot "Archimede c'etait qui"?<br>            C'était un savant grec qui s'interessa beaucoup à l'hydrostatique et à la géometrie, on le retrouve dans le calcul des aires avec la methodes des infiniments petits,dans la quadrature du cercle, en arithmetique...|`|bfbe924f15051ab3a4f4624d06047c2daa	Un savant qui dans sa baignoire a non seulement retrouvé son savon mais aussi le principe de la densité des corps(Tout corps plongé dans un liquide re?oit une poussée de bas en haut,celle ci est égale au poids du liquide déplacé)|`|c37dbee251a6f5b08cd9500d5fae7e7daa	un gars qui comme Charlemagne m a empêché d aller me balader dans les champs quand  j étais jeune tout ?a parce qu il a prit un bain mais pourquoi il a pas pris une douche<br>  Que d heure perdues surtout que je sais toujours pas nager  alors sa théorie des corps qui re?oivent une pousse égale je me demande...lllolll

Using your own body weight as a natural form of traction, inversion elongates the spine by increasing the space between the vertebrae, relieving the pressure on discs, ligaments and nerve roots. Less pressure means less back pain. <br>  <br>  Every nerve root leaves the spine through an opening between the vertebrae - the size of this opening is largely controlled by the height of the disc. Discs that are plump and contained in their ligament "wrappers" are necessary to keep the nerve roots free of pressure and your body free from pain. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.energycenter.com/grav_f/benefits.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.energycenter.com/grav_f/benef...</a>
