The psychiatrist says I don't, but I think she's an idiot anyway. Someone said it could be a chemical imbalance but how do I check that? What could I do about it anyway, and I am actually depressed? I mean, I spend most of my time daydreaming and not thinking anything about my life, but when I do I get sad because the house is up for sale and I'm really behind on school. Also, I'm 14 years old.      Samantha   xxx

20070904174716AAFQjK5	Health;Mental Health	What to do if feeling there's no middle ground between shyness and agression?	I guess the thought came up today during work, on why i don't state my views with any aggression.  What I've realized is i don't feel i have a middle ground, like i have to keep my views reserved cause whenever i do state them i just won't quit til i either i win the argument or verbally pick an argument.  I guess i've come to the mindset it's better to stay silent and never say anything is better than to go off.      Though, i guess i see the danger in that too, since history's shown the danger with those who keep things bottled in.  (yes, has tried various forms of mental health without success and realize i've got to explore a different type of option though unsure what).  Yes, tried exercise, mediation, etc  and it just doesn't have any effectiveness as in yrs past.      Am I right?  is it possible that one doesn't have a middle ground on shyness and aggression (note, no record of harming others ever except in self defense of another).

I am 20 and am tired of worrying about birth control options and dealing with my period, which is extremely painful due to my retroverted uterus. I also suffer from tocophobia and feel that due to a combination of several health and psychological risks, including anemia and hyperthyroidism, that I should be qualified to have a permanent procedure performed.      I would like to have an oophorectomy (removal of my ovaries) done when I am 21 but I do not know if this is possible as the U.S. seemingly frowns on this for younger women or women who have never reproduced.      I'm wondering if any women have been able to obtain a tubal ligation or oophorectomy without ever having had children.      Because of the retroversion of my female parts, I am at high risk for miscarriage anyway not to mention severe dysmenorrhea. Would this be reason enough to warrant a oophorectomy?
20090304185242AAd6Jhd	Health;Mental Health	My mom needs help, what can I do?	My mom has been depressed for quite some time now. She believes that the neighbors are out to get her and she claims to be able to hear them talking about her in the other house. We have white noise generators in her room so it is humanly impossible for anyone to be able to hear what is going on inside. We are trying to be as supportive as possible but it is very hard to understand what she is going through.She has been seeing a psychiatrist for about 4 months now. They have tried several antidepressant medications that have not worked so far. There is one thing my mom is neglecting to tell the psychiatrist though; she recently stopped using methamphetamine. She was a user without the family knowing for about 10 years. I have asked why she wont tell her doctors this and she claims it will "ruin her credibility" and nobody will believe her about the neighbors. I really have no where else to turn, tonight was her third suicide attempt.      My question(s): Does it sound like what she is going through has anything to do with her previous drug use? Should I tell her doctors/psychiatrist about her previous drug use? Will my mom ever forgive me if I do tell?      Please, I need a serious answer. This is very important to me.

I'm asking for my sister here, but she's been going to the bathroom a lot (pretty much once every hour), has had stomach pains, headaches ranging from mild to massive, always feels hungry (she thinks she has a tapeworm), and claims it feels like there is weight on her bladder. She is starting to get very worried and so am I.       The last time she had sex was two weeks ago, she just got off her period (and has had many before then) so isn't pregant, isn't running a fever, and her sides (like where her kidneys are located) are NOT hurting and it does NOT hurt her to pee, nor does she have any burning.      I have had a UTI myself and a Kidney infection and that was my first guess, but judging by the symptoms she DOES NOT have, it doesn't see to be related to the kidney, more so the stomach.      It's been going on for a couple of months, and please don't just say "go to doctor" because that's obvious. We're waiting for insurance to get in place. We're just looking for what might be up to see if it's doctor avoidable till we CAN get insurance in place.      Thank you for any helpful answers.

20081007001324AAoR8NY	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Why is Hydrocodone only available mixed with Tylenol (e.g. Vicoden) or something else, such as Advil)?	Because of character limitations, I phrased my question as briefly as possible. My question is why the fairly common opioid analgesic, hydrocodone, is only available in forms that mix it with other, usually anti-inflammatory type drugs, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil)? Is there a medical purpose (which seems highly unlikely), a marketing purpose, or some other reason?      The most common form of the drug is Vicoden, which is a combination of hydrocodone and acetaminophen, in varying amounts. Because acetaminophen is proven to be extremely dangerous to ones liver, one must limit the amount of Vicoden (or Norco, which contains the least Tylenol with the most hydrocodone of any of the products on the market, as far as I know) that one takes. Ibuprofen isn't dangerous for your liver, but can harm your stomach.  This means that patients undergoing pain management therapy for chronic pain must often switch to stronger, higher "schedule" or "class" as rated by the FDA (hydrocodone is a schedule III controlled substance, whereas most of the drugs listed below are schedule II, which, though slightly confusing, is "higher" or "more controlled"), opioid drugs simply to avoid the serious health risks of these other, ironically over-the-counter, medications.      With all of the myriad versions of hydrocodone-based medications, why do none of the drug manufacturers sell plain hydrocodone, as they do with Schedule II drugs such as oxycodone, morphine, demerol, fentanyl, methadone, etc.? Why should someone who could find relief from hydrocodone at a higher dosage have to switch to a potentially more addictive medication with a higher potential for side-effects such as drowsiness, dizziness, and generally "feeling high"? I don't wish this to become a forum about the addictive nature of these medications, as I am mostly concerned with the issues facing patients with legitimate chronic pain.   However, while researching this question, I read many reports of how Vicoden abuse is on the rise. Since alcohol use and/or abuse is common among addicts, and alcohol greatly increases the risks of liver damage associated with acetaminophen (aka "Tylenol Toxicity"), it would seem an even greater moral imperative to stop combining hydrocodone with acetaminophen (this is a problem that has also been discussed in regards to over-the-counter cold remedies, etc.).      If there is some medical reason why hydrocodone must be mixed with an anti-inflammatory or fever reducer, why not leave it up to doctors to prescribe them together either in their current premixed form or by taking two pills together?      Thank you in advance to anyone with medical and/or pharmaceutical industry knowledge for your time and answers!

20090304202320AApr1fu	Health;Mental Health	My suitemate is a pathological liar...what should I do?	I am living in a suite with a girl who is a pathological liar and a kleptomaniac and she's driving me and my suite-mate's crazy because she keeps stealing our food and using our stuff and doesn't admit that she does any of it even after many confrontations.  I was told by a professional psychologist that the best thing to do is to tell her to get help and then to cut her off because it's affecting us negatively and it's hard for her to change.  The scary thing is that this girl got accepted in to medical school and wants to become a neurosurgeon and my suite-mates and I were scared that in the future, she might hurt her patients (assuming she completes medical school).  I was talking to a good friend of mine about this situation and she was appalled that we (my suite-mates and I) weren't going to do anything about the situation.  My friend suggests us to get a psychologist TO her even though was trying to explain to her that a person can't be helped if they don't want to be helped or think there is anything wrong with them (which is the case of that girl). Besides, it's detrimental for us to continue any friendship with her because she's lying all the time about everything; we just can't trust her.  But I guess my question is, what should I do in this situation.  My friend has made me feel terrible about 'not doing anything' to help this girl but we tried talking to her and confronting her but it was no use.  But at the same time, I didnt feel there is anything I CAN do and she's really NOT my responsibility.  Is there another solution to this problem?

20090305051518AAHwdcz	Health;Women's Health	Help!  I think I'm pregnant, and I'm on birth control?	I've been on the birth control pill since December 28th.  The first time I had sex was on Jan 31st.  He also uses a condom, but we experimented this one time for like ten seconds without a condom on that Jan 31st; I wasn't on the sugar pill phase at that time, I was on my active pills, beginning of my second pack.  He didn't ejaculate nor precum that night.  Since then any other time we had sex, a condom was used properly.  I took three home pregnancy tests over the last month and all turned up negative; I waited at least ten days, after Jan 31st to take the first test, and waited like another two weeks to take my second test.  I still bleeded for about 2 to 3 days, when I was on my sugar pills, but it was so lite that I got scared that it was implantation bleeding; so I then took the third test and it turned out negative.   You see, I have never missed a pill, I take it correctly, I'm not an idiot.  I always remember to take it around the same time every single day.  My partner even claims to have low sperm count.   However, I'm still really scared that I'm pregnant cause for the past two days or so, I've been throwing up; particularly in the morning, and my gag reflex has been on the fritz, along with swollen breasts.   Of course, I have been stressed out lately about losing my job (even when everyone says I won't and that I'm overreacting) and alot of stupid fights and sh*t with my boyfriend, and I haven't been sleeping right nor eating much.   So, I wonder if I'm preggo since I've been throwing up or am I just stressed out?

My brother was getting ready to leave the house as he headed downstairs. He gathered his book bag and I heard him exit the home and slam the door shut. About 10 minutes later, I heard someone inside of the house slam the closet or bathroom door shut. That is when I opened my eyes, and I tried to move myself out of bed, but it felt as it I was tied down and I could not even move any part of my body. I heard this person walk through the hallway, and up the stairs. The entire time I am trying to move and get out of bed, but I was unable too. The next thing I know, my door opens, and as soon as it opens, I was able to frantically turn over to see who was at my door. Has this happened to anyone before (not being able to move as if paralyzed)? This does not seem like the FIGHT or FLIGHT instinct. Can someone please explain what happened to me. I'm 21 male, thanks.

I’m atopic, so I’m particularly prone to colds, rhinitis, eczema, asthma etc.  I usually get a cold every six weeks or so and they tend to last about 10 days, often longer that that.  But sometimes I find that just as I appear to be recovering from one cold, I come down with another one; so whilst I am in the snotty-nosed part (sorry to be so graphic!!), I’ll get a sore throat, blocked nose, headache, shivers etc, which I usually associate with the start of a new cold.      Basically my question is to anyone who is medically trained: is it biologically possible to get two colds at the same time?  And if it isn’t, what is it that’s happening to me?  (Is it the same cold re-emerging or just having a final crack at me?)  And if either (or neither) of those guesses is correct, is what is happening to me normal or very odd indeed?!      Thanks in advance!      PS No need to tell me to take more Vit C etc – it’s irrelevant to my situation and won’t make any difference.  Thanks!

20090305054858AA76HCu	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Is it better to take pain killers every 4 hours, or just when it hurts?	I had surgery on my right arm 7 weeks ago to repair torn cartilage in the wrist, and to shorten the ulna bone.  I am still getting pain, sometimes quite bad.  I am currently taking 30mg codeine and paracetamol for this.       My question is, should I just take the tablets when it hurts, or try to keep on top of the pain by taking them every 4 hours?  I can manage to go without pain killers for 1-2 hours, but then it kills!  I have heard it is better to keep the pain under control by having them continually rather than when it hurts, as it takes time for the tablets to work. The level of pain I am feeling is apparently normal for the procedure I had done, and my consultant is happy that I am healing ok.

I also get them on my knees. Once in a while 1 will appear on the back of my hand or on top of my foot also. I went to the doctor and he said that it is something I am ingesting. One day, all i ate was 2 peanut butter and jelly sandwichs and later that day they came out really bad, so I assumed i might have developed an allergy to peanuts. So I went 2 days without eating anything that contained peanuts and no hives really came out. Yesterday, I ate a piece of pizza and a breadstick for lunch and then i also ate Wendys (2 cheeseburgers, 5 piece chicken nugget with honey mustard sauce and a frosty). Last night I ate pork chops, instant mashed potatos, and corn and when I woke up, hives were all over my arms, starting at my wrists all the way up to my biceps. It was real bad on my biceps, and this is the first time they ever appeared that high up on my arm. I am almost positive everything i ate did not contain peanuts or peanut oil (unless it was something in Wendy's food). Is there an ingrediant or something else that I may be over-looking? Please help.

Big difference?	i cannot afford to go gym, and it's been nearly a year since i have started working out at home. i have brought a set of dummbells and its really been helping me out, i also do any excercise possible to keep me fit, and i've seen an increase in weight as im quiet slim and vegeterian.      i was wondering is it a big difference not going to the gym and working out at home.

20090305073835AARStFB	Health;Diet & Fitness	Worried about my weight?	I have always been very conscious of what I eat because I am fairly short and I know it would be hard for me to become overweight.      16 months ago I had a baby and gained a bit of weight and then lost it all and I have stayed the same weight since (120 lbs).      Lately I have been gaining weight and I cant figure out why. I eat the same things all the time and I exercise.      I eat a berry banana smoothie with light n fit yogurt n skim milk every morning      then for lunch I have turkey with lettuce sprouts carrots and tomatoes with a light honeymustard dressing on a whole grain wrap.      then i have a sensible dinner.      i usally have an apple, grapes, or cucumbers as a snack and then thats it!      I also always get my 8 glasses of water too.      In the past 3 weeks I gained 10 lbs. What is happening to me?

20090227052908AAt1Wxc	Health;Mental Health	Why do teen girls pretend to have disorders?	Something I really hate:       People who claim they have OCD. Or any other type of mental disorder.    I think they say that just to make themselves seem more interesting, or to get attention..       This girl kept telling people she has it and tells them how hard it is to deal with.    Then I asked her about it and she couldnt even explain the definition of OCD to me.    She said something along the lines of '' I dunno, i wash my hands alot and im afraid of germs''.    Why do people think thats all it is. Its more than that. I have a severe case of it and Im not afraid of germs and I dont wash my hands over and over.    I find it kind of insulting.       And they say there depressed. Yet they go to school everyday and they go out with friends.      Ive been diagnosed with depression and dropped out of school at 14 and Im almost 17 now and i still home school.      I dunno i just felt like ranting.   It just makes me mad.

20090305062242AABd9Ik	Health;Diet & Fitness	Question about diet pills?	I've been seeing a lot about phentermine lately.  From what I gather it's a prescription diet pill that actually works.  Is that correct?        My doctor is kind of 'anti-medication'.  I went to him before about weight loss advice thinking (hoping) he would prescribe me some kind of diet pill only to be told he doesn't like prescribing amphetamines.  Period.  He prescribed Wellbutrin because one of the side effects is weight loss.  It didn't work.  Not even a little.      What I'm looking for is something that will boost my energy ( a lot ) and suppress my appetite without making me feel like I have to throw up all the time.  Can anyone advise me on what I can take that will do this (that you know works) and that is OTC due to my doctor's stance on weight-loss meds?      In the event that I switch doctors, or convince my doctor that I need something like this to be able to lose weight, does insurance cover weight-loss meds?  I have Blue Cross First Priority insurance.      Thanks for any info/advice you can give.      ***I understand that I will need to change my diet and exercise more.  I'm all about that!  But I need the added boost of energy to get me started.  I am NOT looking for lectures on any of this and I am not looking to be told that I don't need a diet pill (or something similar) to get me started. ***

20090227044533AAJkQBo	Health;Women's Health	Please help me figure out what's wrong with me. Please?	I'm shaking and I can't go to sleep. I threw up everything in my stomach earlier tonight, and was shaking then, too. My heart is pounding, and I feel nervous. I know I need to rest right now, as I am ill, but I don't know how. I keep clenching my teeth.   Last night, I had a very strange episode in which my breathing was extremely labored, I threw up the contents of my stomach, and I was shaking violently. Seriously, when I say that I had to breathe forcefully, I mean that my throat was tight and I wasn't breathing automatically, I think. (I had taken a prescribed dose of an irregular anti-psychotic, apparently for my "anxiety," aka body dysmorphic disorder. The dose was doubled from my previous dosage.)   My psychiatrist said this morning that I likely had a panic attack, but I've had one, and it was nothing like this. We're gonna have to call her again tomorrow and tell her that this might be a virus, because I really need to get better. This illness is horrid.   The first things my mother and I thought of were toxic shock syndrome (although my period arrived late--literally, last night--and I hadn't used tampons in between periods), ectopic pregnancy (I'm a virgin :/), and allergic reaction (this is not my first experience with the medication, so this seems absurd).   I'm really not up for another night of this. Tonight is better than last night, but it freaks me out that I'm not able to sleep.
20090305063952AALY0RA	Health;Diet & Fitness	Do I have to eat before a morning work out? My goal is burning fat/ weight loss.?	I know you're not suppose to exercise on an empty stomach but I'm never hungry until a couple of hours *after* I wake up. Could I eat a 100 calorie vitamuffin (1.5 fat, 21 carbs, 6 fiber, 3 protein) then burn 200 or 300 calories and still be okay?) And how long should I wait between eating a very small amount of food and exercising? Surely it won't take an hour to digest one muffin?       Any suggestions for what else I could eat?       The work out I have in mind would be moderate. 30 minutes on my gazelle followed by crunches.

But all day yesterday I kept my fever down to normal but by the end of the day I kind of felt sick to my stomach, not to the point that i actually threw up though. And then I heard about meningitis going around on my campus. I know that syptoms are sore throat, fever, vomiting, stiff neck, sensitivity to light...and I honeslty think that I am paranoid and think that i have that. thats the kind of person I am. But my fever is gone and my cough and throat feel a little better..but the stiff neck thing is bothering me now. I actually dont know what it feels like to have a stiff neck so idk if I have it or not. I mean i can move my head around and stuff...but my lower and upper back hurts alot this morning. So, if I had meningitis, would'nt i be in ALOT of pain by now and pretty much know that i have it?      Thanks in advance!

It also feels kind of moist and when I move or touch my ear (especially earlobe) it gets worse.      I can only go to the doctor on Wednesday but I'm not sure I can wait til then if it doesn't get better, so I don't know what to do.          I hope this isn't too hard to follow, I had trouble sleeping last night and I'm really tired.         Oh, and I have some amoxicillin. Would taking that and painkillers help?
20090305063715AAAnoSb	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Pulled or torn shoulder muscle?	I woke up on Monday morning with a terribly sore left shoulder/neck. By Tuesday I could barely move my head to either side. Wednesday I called in sick and went to the doc as the pain had become so bad (not so much my neck now but whole shoulder feels like a big sore knot, even though my husband massaged it at the start). I explained to her that I hadn't gone to work as it would have been to difficult to shower/dry my hair, and that it had been too painful to even hold a bowl of cereal in my left arm that morning. She said it was probably a pulled muscle and told me to take painkillers.       I'd hoped to go back to work today (Thursday) but having tossed and turned all night - every time I turned onto my left side I woke myself due to the pain and had to turn back - I decided that perhaps it was best to take another day since I'm a very busy secretary and likely to make it worse.      Does this really sound like a pulled muscle to you? My husband suggested that I may have torn it since I'm having difficulty lifting myself out of bed etc and have to use the right side of my body to lift myself. I am also constantly wincing at the slightest movement. I could feel it when I yawned yesterday! ??      Thanks

HELP!?	so about 3 weeks ago, i started developing small red dots, which i thought was pimple on my chest area and my back area. naturally, i applied benzoyl peroxide on it, thinking that it'll be gone the next day. however, a week has passed and still inflamed.       so i went to a dermatologist. she told me that i have a yeast infection on my chest and that it's normal. so she prescribed me selsun shampoo (which is to be applied on my body 15 minutes before i shower), atorax (antihistamine), and ketosil (antibiotic).       during the first week, i thought i was more or less cured as some of the dots went away and dried up. so i visited my derm for a follow-up. she said that everything looks fine and that she will no longer give me atorax. however, she gave me sulphur soap and differin gel (for acne). so my problem is dis. since i'm off of atorax, it seems that my chest and back area is getting worse. and the more i pick on it, the worst it gets. it itches too, and there are some red patches. and hoping that selsun shampoo will save me, i started increasing the time to over two hours sometimes (instead of 15 minutes).       is it possible that my body is ALREADY resistant to these meds and the shampoo? i'm very conscious about my body as i've never had pimples or acne on my chest and back before.       plzzzzz advise me.... WHAT SHOULD I DO??

20090227035650AAzAL5l	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Skin irritation from clothing?	I wonder if anyone else has found this?      For many years I have suffered pain and discomfort from clothing labels rubbing my neck and also pain and discomfort when I wear certain trousers such as M&S casuals.      I normally rip out the label, but the trousers become so unpleasant to wear, I have to throw them away. This dues not happen when I first purchase the clothing, it can take many months before the symptoms arise. The question is why?      I have been researching this for some years now and I can now share the results of my studies. In both cases the problem is caused by the man made thread which is used but to sew on the labels and to sew the seams on the trousers. What seems to happen is that they change over time. My theory is that over time parts of the seam and label come into contact with the hot drum of the tumble dryer, they momentarily melt and cool, but in the cooling they get pulled into sharp micro needles. This also happens with the label itself as it is also made from plastic.  These needles cut into me as the day goes on and in my case, at the end of the day I have many painful pus filled spots on my legs and neck. Now that I know this I have to go to some lengths to find clothing which are not made with these materials.

I had a hysteroscopy yesterday without any anaesthic or pain relief,   because the doctor didn't mention that these were available to me.

The short question is: Should I put in my job application forms that I left my last job because of my asthma?      A bit of detail: I left my last job because I was being exposed to allergens which were giving me daily asthma attacks.

On my application forms I've been explaining why I left my last job, and that my asthma is now well controlled, and that I've been given medical advice from a specialist that I'm fit to return to work as long as I'm not exposed to allergens.      In the last 5 months I've had 1 job interview and they told me that they couldn't employ me because of my asthma - which I'd told them about!

I normally get really bad cramps, sore boobs/nips,headaches and all that jazz, right before I'm about to start. This month I didn't have any of those symptoms what so ever.      The first day of my period was a day late, I had light pink spotting throughout the day with very slight pinches that shifted from my left ovary then the right. On and off all day.       The next day I had a medium flow with bright red blood, no clots, but enough to fill one tampon. (Gross and tmi I know, sorry!) Then when I was about to change it my period stopped! I normally have an extremely heavy flow for the first 3 days or so, then light for the next couple of days.      Thennnn last night I had very light pinkish spotting!  I've been extremely constipated and gassy (again, sorry for tmi). But that's pretty much it. When I woke up this morning, the spotting stopped.      What I'm wondering is, should I consider this my period or what? I've read some similar questions and haven't really got much of an answer.       I already have an appt. with my gyn but it isn't until Monday. But this is creeping me out.       *for the record*   I'm STD free   I've had my period for 8 years now, and this has never happened.      10 points for most helpful answer. Thanks!

Once I pulled it out, the ink particles fly around everywhere and I inhaled some of it but not a lot really. As of now it doesn't cause me any irritation or anything.      Do you think this is dangerous? I really think that this sort of thing happens everywhere where there is a laser printer and it shouldn't be that life-threatening but a mate doesn't think so.

20090305092006AAlferW	Health;Mental Health	Is there anything I could have done to avoid getting mugged?	About 2 years ago, when I was 16, I was walking around my normal home town alone, in the day time, in a fairly quiet area, the area was mainly carparks, but I needed to walk the way to get home. However, there were a few people about.      Anyway, a group of about 10 scumbag chavs, probably a bit older than me shouted something at, which, while I couldn't hear what it was, sounded quite intimidating. I crossed the road and decided to walk back up towards the towns main street. However, to do that I had to walk through an alleyway, and then 2 from the group ran up to me and said "Got a quid, mate?".       Now, I didn't really want to give them a pound, but as it was right by the entrace to an alleyway, I didn't want to get beaten up in an alleyway either. So, I foolishly pulled out my wallet, and handed them a pound. The problem was, I had about ￡100 of cash in there, which they obviously had seen.      However, the person who I had given the pound to walked off in the opposite direction, so I assumed he had got what he wanted and had decided to leave. So, I thought I was in the clear, but walked back up to the main street anyway. I went into a shop, just to hang about for 10 mins to make sure they were gone.      Anyway, about 5 mins later, they walk in the shop, one then punches me in the arm, right in a crowed shop to get my attention and then says "Give me all your money or we'll beat the **** out of you". So, I handed it over as what could I do? Although I was in a really busy shop, no one cared and no one was prepared to help. But I guess that's people for you, most of them are pricks.       I did contact the police, and they did catch them but that's not really the point. Ever since it happened, 2 years ago I've been terrorfied to leave the house, I can't go anywhere on my own for fear of it happening again. I've tried to change the way I deal with situations like this, if anyone asks me for money I just briskly and confidently keep walking and say "I haven't got anything". However, I'm still absolutely terrorfied, but I want to get out and do things but I'm so scared.      What could I do to avoid a situation like this again? I really am scared.      Thanks

I discovered Acai berry when I was in the ice cream section of cub foods, there was an Acai berry sorbet, I picked it up and glanced it over, read that it was some rare berry from the rain forest and decided to give it a try.  I often will randomly pick out interesting things to try out if they catch my eye.  Anyway, I found it to be very delicious.  I later found the Tropicana pure brand Acai berry/raspberry juice and threw it in my cart and wow if it wasn't so dang expensive I would line my fridge with it.  Well basically my point is that I found the stuff on my own and wasn't following some "fad".        Ok, my question now is this, apparently people are taking these acai berry pills?  I really don't know anything about them, but someone was saying something about using them for weight loss, don't scream at me if I'm completely off base on any or all of this.       Well actually I'm not really sure what my question is, I'm just somewhat confused by the concept.  That would be like taking strawberry pills, or watermelon pills, or whatever.  Why not drink the juice, its so much tastier.        Also I guess I don't really know the whole deal with the Acai berry, whats so great about it, besides it being delicious?

But Dec of 07 was the last time I have had one in a while. Well the last three weeks I have been having at least 2 a day. My prob is that I am not "panicing" about anything. Nothing is happening that is getting me upset. I could just be watching Friends on tv, working in the garden or just playing with my puppies. Heck! I am in the middle of one now! Nothing to cause a "panic" attack.       What is happening is I have a hard time breathing. Its like I cant take a whole or complete breath. I can breath just not all the way I guess. Its like starting a yawn and not finishing it. You have what feels like a weight sitting on your chest until you can take another yawn and finish it. It makes things hard for me, like I dont have the energy to do anything. And it sometimes hurts... Like hold your breath for as long as you can... your chest or lungs actually starts to hurt.      A few extra details. I am 22 and I have no insurance so I cant go see the doc. I dont have any medical problems or anything stressful going on in my life. Im not too over weight only bout 30 lbs... but I had them when I was the ideal weight for my height. I remember them starting when I was like 11 or 12. They went away when I was 20 to 21 and now they are back.      So are these really panic attacks like the doc said several years ago? Or are they something else? If so what and what can I do to make them stop?

I have had two worker's comp docs screw me over. They sent me to an evaluating state approved doc and she said that I would need surgery but it may be beyond repair at this point. I have had 3 weeks of physical therapy, 3 rounds of injections, a walking boot, a soft cast, and a hard cast. It has been almost 6 months. I've had both x-rays and an MRI.

Bit of history -   I am blind in my right eye - detached retina, cataract removal surgery with no lens implant, reoccurring uveitis and an undeveloped optic nerve from birth.      On Maxidex daily for uveitis and had an inject month or so ago as flared up badly.      Now in my left eye I have flashes of light that comes and goes, the eye aches quite a bit especially in the morning but throughout the day and headaches behind both eyes.      I'm short sighted in my left eye and eye sight checked mid Feb so I know I don't need a higher prescription.      I also have no light perception in my right eye although I sense a light flash occasionally in that eye like a bulb going on - maybe my right eye or the Peripheral vision of left?      Right eye hurts always does due to uveitis      Oh and also my right eye changed colour to Green summer last year (was blue) so now also have heterochromia.      Any ideas?       My ophthalmologists are so crap I loath to go to them again I'm 24 years old and while they gave me 100% with my cataract they don't seem to have much of a clue when I go to them, never see the same doctor twice and whenever I go there I'm in a room full of 70 year olds.

I'm pretty pissed at the Psychiatrist my sister's seeing (she's in for attempting to commit suicide, it's the 1st time she's done this).       We're filipinos and our first language is Tagalog. I know psychs think they are able to distinguish who and who shouldn't be in the Baker Act and one of the signs that they use is by the way you respond. My sister usually speaks in a soft voice when speaking in english because this helps her be able to clarify what she's saying. (every american knows it's hard to understand foreigners and immigrants because of their accent and it's up to us to compensate by learning how to speak every letter of every single word we say)      I've seen my sister talk to a filipino doctor and she was able to speak more clearer, and more firm. The same way she would speak to me. She looked more lively and comfortable talking to people who speak our first language obviously because it's a lot easier.      I know my sister's not as crazy as this doctor's making her think she is. Does this guy even know he's probably pushing her off the edge? You can tell me he's a professional as much as you want but I don't think his experience with books and other patients can compensate with my 19 years of life with my sister.      Is there anyway I can stop this baker act? We're on our way to the hospital right now

Over the past 3 months I have lost 8-10 lbs by joining a dance team that practices two nights a week. This has been giving me about 30 minutes each night (Tues & Wednesday) of intense cardio. Starting about 3 weeks ago, I started going to the gym on Monday & Thursday nights. I do 15 intense minutes on the eliptical, then 15 moderate minutes on the bike. I alternate resistance and incline on both, I don't have a set routine. I then do 5 sets of 20 calf raises, and stretch. After all this, I go into the weight room and do the leg press and leg extension machines. I do enough weight to feel a burn. I want to build muscle and want good muscle definition. I also do free weights and a few machines for my arms, and some different ab workouts.      I played soccer for 13 years, so I have a naturally athletic body. My question is: how can I make my legs more toned? I dont want stick legs, I want tone and I want muscle. I have not been seeing very good results from what I have been doing, it almost seems as if my legs are getting bigger but with no definition. Also, I want to have a more toned stomach. I still have a slight tummy in my lower abs.      Any & all feedback is greatly appreciated!

20090305090828AAQQKXE	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Allergies	My son was diagnosed with scabies but no one else is infected?Is it scabies or an allergic reaction to carpet?	My son has had a rash for about 4 weeks now, and one Dermatologist diagnosed him with Atopic Dermatitis.  The diagnosis did not convince me because my son does not have dry skin, so I took him to see another Dr. who told me he had escabiosis (which is scabies),  The red marks or bumbs seem to have a line that resembles a scab.  Can my child have scabies and not infect other family members? Can the rash solely be because of our carpet? Could it be that our dogs somehow affect him?what else could it be?      Please help

I am only 17 years old, but have been masturbating face down, whilst limp, for the last few years, and cannot get out of the habit.

When my girl friend gives me a hand job, I feel no pleasure and I don't ***, and I've been told this might be because of the way I'm masturbating.      I get no pleasure from sex either.... anybody know what's going wrong?      Thanks

Get me too sad = cry   Too happy = cry   Too angry = cry   Too tired = weep a bit   Too bored =weep then sleep   Too sexually aroused = cry?(no not really)      But yeah, u get the point, it's a troublesome condition, When I'm mad, I FEEL mad, anger, hate.. like FURIOUS... but I can't keep from crying, and then all fails when tears starts pouring down.      The worst part is... I'm a straight 19 year old male.. Not the best trait to have...XD      P.S. Am not in anyway depressed and can still kick *** while crying.

20090305095613AAcIyse	Health;Other - Health	I am going to be hospitalized?	I am 16 and my parents think that I have bi-polar disorder, along with many therapists. But I keep looking the symptoms up online and I don't exhibit half of them, but have some symptoms that aren't included.   I am not going to take medicine because every time I take it I get one of the uncommon side effects, and I feel that I am falsely diagnosed.      Anyways, they want to hospitalize me today, and I am perfectly okay with it. Because there's nothing wrong with me, and the only people I have trouble with are my parents, so I NEVER act out in public. (And I can tell that there are going to be a lot worst people there)    So if I behave normally (Like I always do, except at home) how long will I be in the hospital?        PS. Bi-polar runs in my family, but I've also seen what they are like. I am not nearly close to them (Thinking people are behind the curtains, lashing out at people I don't know)      Pss. I am not pretending that I am fine when I am in the hospital. Its just how I act when I am not mad at my parents, or around them

My dentist without my permission ground down my 4 back molars (2 top and 2 bottom) without my permission.

She came back from NYC about two hours ago.  Then out of nowhere, she tells me that she's been thinking about her death alot recently, and then she starts laughing hysterically for about half a minute, I didn't know if she was laughing or crying at the end.      I told her that I didn't like her thinking like that, then she pulled herself together, and said she meant that she was comfortable with the idea of her dying.  I don't know if I am partly responsible for how she feels, but I try to tell her everytime I talk to her how special and wonderful she is.  I am worried though, she's always had psyche problems because she was previously abused by an ex.  But I am really worried now...is she suicidal?

20090305094900AA4ZxRN	Health;Diet & Fitness	Anybody who knows about calorie-counting diets..?	Well, I know the formula for losing pounds is to burn more calories than you intake, and so cutting your cals down to about 100-1200 a day is a  great start, number-wise.I've done this before, for a long time, and didn't lose any weight.But the thing is, I was simply counting the carbs, I didn't care what foods they came from.So, if you're on a 1000-cal-a-day diet, can you lose weight by eating basically whatever you want, as long as you don't go over the daily limit, or do you HAVE to switch to only healthy foods, like veggies and whatnot.

How do I fix this? I get enough sleep, so would going to the gym more help?

[[realy hard to explain effectively immagine somone u could walk up to and slap around the face set on fire and to them u might of just given em 1 millon pounds as their reaction would be the same]]       i do not feel im depressed i simply feel normal, im not having trouble sleeping, my diet is good, i get enough excercise [although would like to do more], i have a good varied social life, i just cant think would could progress so slowly but there is definately something wrong. memory wise its too odd to just be age im only 19- it hit when i was about 12, and tbh i drew it down to puberty, i just remembered stuff that didnt happen rarely and forgot important things, but now its become quite bad and im forgetting people, days, time, my own name on 1 or two occasions, i have to think for quite some time to remember my birthday ect ect..      also, there are numerous other odd things but those are the mains, let me sumarise briefly for those who cant be bothered to read my poorly punctuated drivel above:P      1: bad memory loss [gradualy getting worse], cant remember names, places, conversations, dates, CAN remember numbers smells and images quite well [been the same since started]      2:  false memorys [getting more and more of these]  basicly it didnt happed but i remember it happening, or what i remember completely differes from what acctualy happened, seeing a vid of the truth gives me pains in the back of my head.      3. muscle spasms, these are not cramps, i ask my arm or leg to do one thing, it does something uncontrolable or over/under powered.       4. muscle weakening, i get the spasms less now but i have severely lost a lot of my strength, like at the moment i can grab something just enough to hold it, and easily make a fist say. but i cannot squeeze with more preasure then required to ball my fist [comes and goes but lasts longer and is more frequent]      5. displaced emotions, i dont get emotional hardly at all, people describe me as zoning out during conversations, starting into space and literaly having to be hit or struck to recover from it, i however feel as if iv just been sitting there for maybe a few seconds, i have gone for over 30 minets before and no, i dont blink while i do this, asside from breathing i dont do much else, no thoughts nothing, just gone      6. maybe not related but i notice im not effected so much by memory loss IF i have music on or am actively chewing gum and or tapping my fingers, i remember numbers extreamly well, and smells and images but i cannot associate images with time and or content, more like i can tell u what a sign said, not beacuse i remember it as writing [[this gives me sever pain in back of my head]] but if i remember it as an image and read of the image then and there i can mostly remember things like this [[i have addapted now that this is how i remember 90% of things, to acctualy remember it as an even

The primary function of the _________________ is to supply the blood with oxygen so that the blood can deliver oxygen to all parts of the body.     Digestive system   Cardiac system   Respiratory system   Endocrine system      2.   The ___________ is a strong wall of muscle that contracts to create a suction in the chest to draw in air and expand the lungs. When the muscle relaxes, the chest cavity decreases and the air is pushed out.       3.   Which of the following statements best describes how oxygen enters the lungs?     Oxygen enters the lungs through the trachea, which branches into two tubes called the bronchi, which lead to the lungs   Oxygen enters the lungs through the diaphragm, which branches into two tubes called the trachea   Oxygen enters the lungs through bronchi, which branches into two tubes called the bronchioles   Oxygen enters the lungs through the trachea, which branches into the alveoli      4.   External respiration takes place in the ____________________.     Bronchi   Trachea   Alveoli   Diaphragm      5.   Oxygen is carried by the ______________, which is part of the red blood cell.       6.   Select the answer below that best describes how the lungs are kept free of germs and dirt from the air.    The alveoli act as filters for the lungs collecting particles of dirt and germs to be exhaled when the diaphragm relaxes   Tiny hairs known as cilia clean the trachea of dirt and germs before it can enter the lungs   Hairs known as cilia, found inside the alveoli, collect the dirt and germs to be expelled from the lungs   Mucus found in the bronchial tubes collects dirt and germs that gets into your lungs. Tiny hairs called cilia work to sweep out the debris collected to keep your lungs clean.      7.   The term “a smoker’s cough” refers to ________________ , which is caused by a long-term inflammation of the bronchi.     Emphysema   Lung cancer   Chronic bronchitis   Cilia degeneration      8.   Janet smoked cigarettes since she was sixteen. Now at age 45, she suffers from shortness of breath, coughing, fatigue, sleep and heart problems, weight loss, and depression. Her condition is caused by a chronic lung condition that affects the alveoli. Janet suffers from:     Emphysema   Lung cancer   Chronic bronchitis   Cilia degeneration      9.   Both marijuana and tobacco smoke contain__________________, which are substances that cause cancer.     Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)   Thiamine and dextrose   Enzymes   Carcinogens      10.   Which of the following statements is not true?     Smoking at an early age increases the risk of lung cancer. For most smoking-related cancers, the risk rises as the individual continues to smoke.   Teenage smokers suffer from shortness of breath almost three times as often as teens who don't smoke and produce phlegm more than twice as often as teens who don't smoke.   Teenage smokers are more likely to have seen a doctor or other health professionals for an emotional or psychological complaint.   People who quit smoking cannot reverse any of the damage that has been done to their lungs over an extended period of time.

I'm 16 years old and I am about 5'6, 110lbs (I know, I am quite small for my age). Ever since about November of 2008, I have been going to the gym and working out. At the beginning, I didn't have a set amount of days that I went to the gym, but ever since about January, I decided that I want to get serious about it so I am now trying to get to the gym 5 days a week. For about a year, I have been trying to eat as healthy as possible. I do not drink pop or eat fast food, except Subway. I try and get a serving of veggies and fruit in everyday. The only bread I eat is wheat and the only drink I drink is usually water and maybe some green tea every here and there. For dinner, I eat whatever my mom cooks, which is mostly some chicken but it varies.      Anyways, the point of this post is to get some feedback as to if what I am eating now is right, and if there is anything else I can do to get healthier.       Other things you may want to know is that I am already in good health, and I workout for about an hour and a half at a time. My goal is to gain muscle so any tips would help.

I don't really do much exercise, infact I'm pretty lazy and I do eat a lot of crap food, but I also eat good food like fruit and veg etc. I also worry a lot about that and stuff happening at college etc. I don't think that helps. and I get stressed about my college work as well, when i do do exercise however my heart rate only increases to about 150 to 160 which i heard is about average for your heart rate after exercise.   my dad also has a fast heart rate so I'm thinking it may be genetic as well. my mums is very very slow, so I think it may have been something from my dad.      Cheers for the help :)

20090227063047AAukGwe	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Tiny Red dots the size of the head of a pin?	I have these tiny pin head sized dots that usually  occur on my hands or very rarely on my arms I will occasionally find one. The don't completely cover my hand or anything, just one here or there. Right now I have 4 on my right hand and only one on my left. They occur on both my palm and the back of my hand.     Sometimes these dots will last years (as one on my left palm has lasted for about 6-7 years so far) and sometimes disappear within a few months. They are flat, not raised, and don't cause any sort of discomfort at all. They actually have no feeling different than that of the rest of my skin.      I asked a doctor once about this and he told me that he wasn't sure what they were. Never did get a referral to a dermatologist though, so he must not have thought that it was very serious.      Any idea what this could be caused by. They do blanch or disappear when pressure is applied. I am more curious than concerned at this point. All help appreciated.

Last year I was on an anti-depressant and gained 30 pounds (15 kilos). I asked my doctor about it and she said the drug wasn't the cause and implied that only my piggish appetite was to blame. I felt that my food intake and activity lever did not change significantly while I was on the drug, so I did some research and found many references to this problem which indicate that SSRIs can cause this. When I showed them to my doctor, she refused to read them. Why do doctors not want to hear about possible adverse side-effects of the drugs they prescribe?

20090227063740AAH9ZL2	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	I am being denied health insurance across the board for a condition I do not even have.  What can I do?	When I was 12 I was hit by a car.  Though I suffered a mild concussion, I did not break any bones or even have a scratch on me.  A year later I went in for the physical that was required for high school, and I was diagnosed with Arthritis.  It was isolated to just my right hip, and they said it was most likely due to the car accident...     After a few months it got progressively worse, to the point where I could no longer walk without crutches.     After lots of treatments, and much debate, I had a total hip replacement when I was 16.  I did all the necessary PT, and made a total recovery.  I feel like a million bucks.    After college and working a bunch of corporate jobs, I decided I wanted something more fulfilling so I quit and now work for myself.    I'm 26,  5'10" 135 lbs.  No blood pressure issues, diabetes or absolutely anything.   I consider myself to be in excellent health, yet I am denied health insurance across the board for a condition I don't even have.     I cant get insurance that even excludes my hip.  I am uninsurable.     It seems the only way I could get health insurance at this point would be to jump back into corporate america, or to marry someone and get on their plan (providing they have coverage).     This is disgustingly unreasonable.     What can I do?

20090227073607AAM8oDv	Health;Women's Health	I'm a little bit worried.  Could it be something sinister?	I have had gynecological problems since I was 15 and warning now this is a little gross so don't read on unless you want to help.        It started off with a green discharge, heavy periods, painful sex, bleeding after sex, pain in abdomen, stinging/burning in abdomen.  That sort of thing, I've probably missed some out.  I've been swabbed for STD's, infections, always come back clear.  I've only ever been with one person sexually and he's never cheated or been with anyone else either (guaranteed).      I've been doctors about this tonnes of times and they just say it's normal for me although I did get referred to the gynae's before but they just kept putting me on the pill, said I was too young for a lap (I'm 21).      I've been back to the doctors (seen a new one) and she really listened to me.  I asked for a smear test and she said with a smear test, if the results come back abnormal you get sent to the colopscopy clinic up the hospital but because of the symptoms I have she's going to refer me straight there.      Please, has anyone got any idea of what this is?  It's so controlling on my life and I'm rather worried it could be something really bad....like cervical cancer.      Any help would be really appreciated.
