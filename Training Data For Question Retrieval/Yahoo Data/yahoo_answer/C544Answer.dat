c2qZm53maa	I agree with the six weeks.  If you are going to breast feed you should tell your doctor.  If I remember correctly breast feeding help your uterus return to its normal size.  If that's the case it may interfere with IUD.  But double check with your gynecologist. <br>  <br>  Mirena IUD releases hormones.  Paragard does not.  |`|EJrM8gr9aa	they make you wait until you are on your period because then the cervix is opened up a bit and they can insert it. i had mirena put it that way.|`|NBuFZd5Aaa	Usually when you go back for your 6 wks follow-up the doc will put it in for you. |`|ln7uuEKkaa	idk
7gH7sgi6aa	Not all Dr's force sedation.  I've had several colonoscopies and my last two I chose not to have sedation.  I've gotten so used to them that it is easier for me to handle without sedation.  I cannot take the needles before hand and would rather deal with the bit of pain during the procedure than the "hassle" that the nurses put me through before.  I am very hard to start an IV on and have to get stuck over and over and over and just refuse sedation.  I've been awake and watch and the entire procedure.  No one can force you into sedation.  It is a patients choice.  You need to talk to your Dr and then if you cannot make sense with him then talk to the Patient Representative.<br>  Peace & Love :)|`|Ue5NoJOgaa	Different people have different reactions, some find it intensely painful and if the muscles start to spasm it can be horrible, also there are multiple kinds of procedure, some of them are so painful it would be irresponsible for the doctor not to sedate the patient.|`|cb422b6c3f9c9f2317116c9a1fcfe7d7aa	I seem to have a very high pain tolerance for pain--but I will have to disagree with you here.  For me they took out some growths and I do not want cutting on me anywhere unless I am sedated.  It is so uncertain what they will do through the colonoscopy.  Just my opinion.|`|qG1j1Y1Naa	Sometimes they want to sedate you because it is dangerous if you move.  And yes it is uncomfortable.  Not everyone likes things shoved up their butt.|`|eca4c567b412164e4b3f2d62944e6871aa	I have never had a Dr that FORCED me to do anything. As far as the sedation for the colonoscopy and the angiogram . I was glad to take it to be relaxed and let the Drs do their job. That's very good you're proud not to have to use sedation , but I prefer to be relaxed and not worrying about what the Dr is doing during the procedure. Many people have different thresh holds of pain and if they choose the sedation , good for them . But I have never , ever heard of a Dr forcing a patient to use sedation against their will.|`|AA11603468	I had 2 done. The first one, I awoke in the middle of the procedure, and the pain was so excruciating, I started screaming like a maniac. I made sure the second time I had one, I was well sedated and they were aware of what happened the previous time. I have had many medical procedures (unfortunately), and though I don't mind some discomfort, I see no point in purposely putting yourself in pain to avoid sedation. <br>  <br>  I just don't agree with you.
1pup885baa	Definitely! Combined with a healthy diet, that sounds like a great way to lose weight. Good luck!|`|Oo3PC1yQaa	Along with the daily cardio and a good diet I think so.|`|a085260e18048091431aa093b935186faa	Yes. However, you need to be eating right as well. No amount of exercise whatever kind will do any good if you are pigging out. Here are some tips...<br>  <br>  Step 1: Find out what your basal metabolic rate is. Go to: <a href="http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weight-keep-it-off-permanently.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weigh...</a> <br>  Ignore the advertisements there. This is the amount of calories you need to eat to maintain your current weight.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Do you exercise? Do you exercise right? Exercising right means that you monitor your heart rate and make sure that you reach your target heart rate and maintain it for the longest period of time while exercising. You have two targets a fat burn zone and an cardiovascular zone. The fat burn is usually 60% of your maximum and is easier to achieve and maintain and if your goal is weight loss this is where you want to be. Just walking/excising is a good start but if you want to get the most out of your work out find out what your target range is. If you don't belong to a gym then I recommend the Polar Fitness F11 Heart Monitor Watch.<br>  <br>  Step 3: You need to decrease your caloric intake or increase the amount of calories your body uses in a day by 500 calories a day for a week to lose 1 pound. So you can decrease that basal number you got in step 1 by 500 calories and exercise very little(yes you still need to exercise). Or you can decrease it by 250 and exercise off 250 calories or any other combination. Remember that your basal number is the amount of calories you body needs to live. If your number were 2400 then your body burn 100 calories per hour. So if you walk for half an hour and burn 300, 50 of that is your basal.<br>  <br>  Step 4: Count your calories, it's not hard and you'll find out that you eat a lot of the same things on a daily basis so you won't have to research everything over and over again. Balance what you eat (equal parts carbs and protien whenever possible) . One of the best websites out there is one from the FDA. <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/se...</a><br>  This database has almost every food on the planet counted and weighed. (Hint: they do a lot of their weights based on 100grams. If you put 0.28 in the serving size this equals 1 ounce). Get a reliable food scale, preferably digital. Weigh everything that you put in your mouth that is not prepackaged. You need to know what you’re eating and how much you’re eating. The number one mistake is "eating healthy". Everyone thinks because it's "healthy" the portion isn't that important. A handful of peanuts is "healthy" and has nearly 250 calories! Eat enough calories and it won’t matter how "healthy" it is your going to gain weight. Great ideas for people on the go are: South Beach Cinnamon Raisin Cereal Bar(awesome snack, 150 calories, 10g of protein! 3g fiber you can not do better, also comes in Peanut Butter and Chocolate), Snickers Marathon Multi-Grain Crunch(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle), Snickers Marathon Protein Caramel Nut Rush(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle).<br>  <br>  Step 5: Balance! In what you eat. Make sure that you are eating Protein, Carbs, and Fiber in every meal. A great way to make sure you get the protein and fiber is Kelloggs Protein Water. It has only 30 calories but gives you 5g protein and 5g fiber for 20z. Go to Wal-mart they sell a 10 pack of the powder for ~$5.50. That way when you are eating a high carb food for a snack or meal you can still get the balance. <br>  <br>  Step 6: Smaller but more. Each smaller snacks more often instead of big meals. This really does work and will definately increase your metabolism. I eat a South Beach Cereal Bar every 2 hours all day then a good dinner. They keep me full and they taste pretty good. Caffiene is your friend. It is a natural appetite suppressant so have that cup of coffee!<br>  <br>  Step 7: Adjustments and Variety. If you are doing your best and losing weight but your starving, increase the amount of calories your giving yourself by 100-200 calories a day. Losing weight and starving are not good bedfellows. If you starve eventually you will crack and lose the battle. The more types of exercises you do the more weight you will lose. You will work more muscles and keep your body guessing.<br>  <br>  Step 8(optional): If you belong to a gym or have some free weights at home. Use them! Muscle takes up less space in your body than fat (pound for pound). A pound of fat sits around and does nothing all day, while a pound of muscle, even at rest burns calories(increasing your basal metabolic rate).<br>  <br>  Step 9: Sleep, Never underestimate the power of a goodnight sleep. Will power can crumble in a second if your going through your day tired. You end up with a diminished sense of self control and tend to “give in” to temptation.<br>  <br>  Step 10: Find a distraction. Read a book, Ride a bike, Play a game. Whatever takes your mind off of food, do it. You will need something that you can turn to in a moment of weakness. Something that will distract you for a half an hour so that your will can reassert itself and help you to make a rationa|`|TKNPveHDaa	No.  Yoga is flexibility training and some light toning.  To lose weight, you need cardio and weight-lifting.  More active exercises like walking, swimming, running, sports, and biking will be helpful.  Yoga is not high intensity enough to make a difference.<br>  <br>  But if you go to yoga instead of sitting on the couch eating ice cream, you'll lose weight from improved diet.|`|oxhClqAWaa	Absolutely! Yoga or Pilates alone will not help with weight loss as it is strength training, but combined with some cardio you'll lose weight and get toned.|`|sDwNAKwsaa	Yes Yoga certainly help you i loosing weight....|`|G1tuA7q5aa	Yoga has an important role to play in the treatment of Obesity.

Can yoga alone help you lose weight? No. But it can certainly be a help if the type of yoga you are doing is intense enough.<br>  <br>  The real question you might want to ask yourself is: Is it the BEST utilization of your time if you are trying to lose weight?<br>  <br>  For example, if you only have an hour per day to exercise and your goal is to lose weight, then you would likely be better off doing some medium to high intensity aerobic workout. If time isn't an issue though, then yoga would be a great supplement.|`|22d15d6315e57472928cfed3bdf73d1caa	yes! Increasing your activity in any way will help you lose weight. Yoga is a great way to safely exercise without putting too much pressure on your heart right away.
6wGkycFAaa	Yes it's normal and yes it hurts like hell. There are several spot treatments available on the market and you may have luck with any one of them. Everyone is so different when it comes to acne. I have tried every product on the market and at 40 I am still battling acne issues. <br>  The quickest relief is to pop it but it can get worse and it may scar. Don't know how much that matters in your ear but it will clear up faster if you don't mess with it.<br>  I have used proactive for a long time and they have a mask that is used as a spot treatment. I don't find they go away any faster but I do find that if you use it right when you first feel it, before a head appears on it, sometimes it will disappear without ever surfacing. There is one place in Calgary where I can get it but online or through the tv seems to be the easiest. I don't know if it is available anywhere else besides online or tv in the states. <br>  A quick home remedy to relieve the pressure and pain by having it pop more naturally (rather than you rupturing the skin) is to put a dab of toothpaste on it or a hot tea bag. These will dry or draw out the core.<br>  Sorry I couldn't be of more help. Perhaps a visit to the drug store will help you get a product that will work for you.<br>  Good luck.|`|V8f9ySvtaa	Put some apple cider vinegar on it and try not to touch it that will just make it worse.|`|HD29O7Ataa	It's probably a cyst<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebaceous_cyst" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebaceous_c...</a>|`|fIrDIUjjaa	Yes, normal, spots can appear everywhere, my friend who's male had one there, and it was very inflamed.<br>  If it hurts, then it's inflamed, it will soon go, but if it has a head then squeeze it, don't worry.
0ujpiBTCaa	Was it a colposcopy? That's when they take a little snippet.If they scraped it, or took a small sample, that will not have any affect. <br>  <br>  The problem would be if they took off a sizable piece of her cervix. This is a surgery that is much more intense than a colposcopy or a scraping. It makes the entrance to the uterus weak and therefore child bearing would be dangerous. Someone close to me went through this- she was able to have children but was forced to stay in bed for 6 months so she did not stand up and "drop" the fetus.<br>  <br>  If the cancer spreads to her whole cervix, that would obviously affect her ability to bear children.|`|NaCLfRDCaa	The direct risk of hpv infertility can be associated to cervical cancer and venereal condyloma.

This virus in women does not directly cause fertility problems, however, if high-risk strains are present pre-cancerous or cancerous conditions of the cervix can develop.

xmibEEdcaa	Going through any sort of drug withdrawal tends to make people depressed. Part of it is physical: your body is reacting to the lack of all those happy endorphins the drugs were boosting for you.  Part of it is also psychological: going off of a drug after a long time is a big lifestyle change, and lifestyle changes often exacerbate depression, especially in people who are already suffering from it. Sometimes, giving up a drug can feel a little bit like losing an old friend.<br>  <br>  Don't worry: your brain will go back to producing endorphins naturally once you've passed through the withdrawal phase. You won't feel bad forever!<br>  <br>  In the meantime, though, you might want to talk to your psychiatrist about your upcoming withdrawal period. He or she may recommend that you raise your antidepressant dosage for a little while or go on a second med temporarily, just for the duration of this upcoming rough period.  <br>  <br>  If you are able to exercise, that will also help to kick your brain into endorphin-producing mode. If your back won't allow traditional exercise, there are exercises you can do sitting down or in the water which will have the same effect on your brain.  <br>  <br>  Getting out into the sunlight whenever you can may also help to get your endorphin production going normally, especially if you're vulnerable to SAD.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and be sure to take it slow. Opioid withdrawal is unpleasant, but it will pass in time.|`|OBT3C4zHaa	Im in the same situation except im taking 120 mg OxyContin a Day and 20 mg Dilaudid. Yesterday I had to go without them and it was complete hell, anyways...<br>  <br>  Your brain will produce the endorphins again on its own. If you were to quit cold turkey right now your endorphin levels would be quite low and it would make you feel depressed among many other terrible symptoms. It's good that your only on Lortab and they haven't moved you to percocet because those are much harder to get off of and withdrawals are much worse. If you're taken down slowly you may have some mild depression when they get down to like 2 or 3 a day but it shouldn't be too severe. <br>  <br>  Your worrying too much about this, I promise you. If they taper you off slowly enough when you stop taking them you shouldn't feel too bad, maybe a little groggy and just mild depression. It's only when you quit cold turkey that you really get withdrawals. It will be manageable for you to do this. I've had 3 surgeries and the first 2 I was slowly tapered off and I didn't even notice not being on them towards the end. I just had my 3rd surgery last month and Im having a problem with the pills now though. My dose is so high and i've become physically dependent on them. I'm fine as long as I take them however if I don't have them for 12 hours or more, I start going into withdrawals and its tough. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|QAf7uAoUaa	hey i just decided to stop taking pain pills and yesterday i was misrable and depressed and a friend of mine who has had a big problem with pain killers gave me a suboxone and i took it last nite i no longer felt deressed sick to my stomach i kinda felt like i was on pain killer but i wasnt slept good last nite and he gave me 2 8mg pills of suboxone i took a full one last nite and im gonna take half tonite and half 2marow so hopefully by this weekend im not withdrawin and hope im feelin much better you just gotta fight it out its hard but u cud win da battle just believe in yourself u dont need the opiates they are a bad disease and i hope i neva get hooked on them again

If you were awake they would have to be more careful not to hurt you because you would remember or comment right away.

Regular X-rays will not show the cyst since it is a soft tissue, and X-rays show mostly bones. A cyst can be seen with a magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) scan. The MRI machine uses magnetic waves rather than X-rays to create pictures that look like slices of the area your doctor is interested in. This test requires no needles or special dye and is painless. Your doctor may order an ultrasound test. This test uses sound waves to allow the doctor to see the outline of the cyst and determine whether it is filled with fluid or solid tissue. This is useful in determining whether the lump could actually be a tumor instead of a fluid-filled cyst.
B8WEoAiKaa	yes you can!  you already have HPV! There are more than 100 different types (or ‘strains’) of human papilloma virus (HPV). Each type has a different number. HPV is common. About 3 out of 4 people (75%) have the virus at some time in their lives. For most people it causes no symptoms and goes away on its own. It is much more common in young people, probably because we develop immunity to the virus as we get older.Some types of HPV can cause changes in the cells of the cervix or the lining of the mouth and throat. They are known as high risk HPVs. Doctors call these changes in cells ‘dysplasia’. The changed cells have an increased risk of becoming cancerous.Other types of HPV can cause warts and verrucas. These types of HPV are sometimes called the ‘wart virus’ or ‘genital wart virus’ and they include types 6 and 11.|`|HHyny0JSaa	I would get tested but it's not likely. Warts are just the symptom of the virus. Usually one will experience an outbreak after first contracting the virus. From there some people break out all the time and have to take meds to control it and some may never experience an out break again, but still have the virus. But get tested to be 100% sure.|`|82359ab5eb2bec5d95da9132c032f006aa	Yes, you could...|`|NaCLfRDCaa	The viral particles are able to penetrate the skin and mucosal surfaces through microscopic abrasions in the genital area, which occur during sexual activity. Once cells are invaded by HPV, a latency (quiet) period of months to years may occur. HPV can last for several years without a symptom.[2] Having sex with a partner whose HPV infection is latent and demonstrates no outward symptoms still leaves one vulnerable to becoming infected.<br>  I would get tested. I hope this helps and good luck. RB|`|hByIuZYHaa	Genital Warts, Also Known as Venereal Warts or Condylomata Acuminata, are caused by the Human Papilloma virus .

QoKZLNfxaa	well i was with my wife one night (before we got married) and for some reason it was just HOT. best sex i ever had with her. and yes it did feel harder than normal. it also felt bigger. my wife agreed. i think its because when youre aroused and having sex and everything, a mans penis will only get so big. but sometimes the arousal can be so good that it will continue to increase blood flow, may increase the size a little, and make it feel actally harder than it will normally get. so id say he could be exaggerating a tiny bit, or you just turn him on that damn much. but to answer your question all i can say is that when its that hard it actually feels like my d*** is a rock, literally.|`|UVrG1deraa	it is really just an exaggeration, rock hard is like very hard. as in very erect, rather than a semi, a full on *****.<br>  hope this helped|`|aBCVFc3Kaa	it's just an exaggerated description. rocks are hard and so was he. it doesn't mean he was extra hard.|`|oAdPL4vWaa	have u ever seen a hot metal rod that's what we call rock hard<br>  this type of situation occurs mostly with newbies|`|GTeGDGzKaa	It means - very hard<br>  <br>  SteveC|`|naequcqlaa	Come on now, what's harder than a rock?!

oRPvkExwaa	I like to eat half a bagel or a banana when I get back from the gym, but it's also important to consume enough through out the entire day, which is about 5 small meals when you're working out as much as you are. Livestrong.com has a feature called The Daily Plate, you put in your height, and weight and your workout goals, then add what you eat and how much you work out on a daily basis. Then, it tells you how many more calories you can take in. Also, when you add your food it recommends healthier alternatives. I only did it for a few days, because tracking that stuff is kind of a pain, haha, but it helps give you a better idea of what you need.|`|o0Badlndaa	Protein|`|OkE3oBZZaa	Oatmeal.

Qz3IXj5kaa	At 13, you're going through something called puberty, which I hope your school or mom talked to you about. It's not the easiest of times, but it's natural to put on weight. You're making your transition into womanhood.<br>  <br>  Weight loss at this point isn't good - diets don't work and will screw with your metabolism. Your body really needs nutrients like calcium to grow bones, and you need that in milk, not diet drinks. Do you really want to fall on a pavement and break a bone? That happens to most old people, not young girls.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as "proper" advice to lose weight because everyone is different. Something may work for someone or back fire on the other.<br>  <br>  Please realise that instead of spending YEARS in vain trying to achieve a "perfect" weight or look, or whatever, you should start learning to embrace yourself. You are an individual - there is no one else on this planet like you - so you should learn to BE an individual instead of listening to dumb magazines or people who dictate what you should look like. They have absolutely no right to do so.|`|ICvNW8OSaa	If you are saying your 13 and need to loose weight, then why wouldn't you know that you should be eating healthy?|`|5E6hjpFjaa	Okay hun....I'm 16 about to turn 17. I weight about 130 pounds and I feel that I need to loose weight. My boyfriend gets really mad when I say I'm fat. I'm 5' 4" so I'm average. If you really want to loose weight, try weight watchers. They have a great plan and you can loose up to 6 pounds a week.<br>  You said not to tell you that you don't need to loose weight but you really don't.<br>  Trust me...I know. When I weighed 175, my doctor told me that I need to get down to 135 to be concidered healthy.<br>  If anything you need to gain 10-15 pounds.<br>  Don't try to look like one of them models on tv. Theyre all airbrused. Thats not how they look. They end up developing an eating disorder due to the pressure of loosing weight. It's not healthy. Be yourself, look like yourself!<br>  Good luck hun, I wish you the best!|`|ixmaM395aa	If you really think you need to lose weight then you need a good slap across the head. You're height & weight are fine. You've probably got a little bit of puppy fat which will go as your body matures more.

rXSXuHeEaa	try not to use any creams use natural things and try to stop eating sweets/sugar and grains for awhile and see if it gets better.  u can wash your face with pure water and baking soda, although it will likely dry your face out, use it once in awhile or when you feel you could handle it again.  Also if you needed a moisturizer try a real good extra virgin olive oil (cold pressed) and use it sparingly.  Only if you need it.
4xNg0Ohuaa	Before you do ANY exercise, be sure to consult a doctor first. In your case I assume you have a medical problem which lead to the consultant telling you to strengthen your stomach muscles. If that is the case, you need to use exercise (especially if you have a bad back) which do not strain the problem area further. <br>  <br>  A simple exercise causing no strain on any other part of the body, except the stomach muscles, is to stand upright, consciously contracting your stomach muscles and keeping it contracted for as long as you can. Remember to keep breathing normally. If you concentrate on doing this - while standing in line at the supermarket or wherever you are, you will slowly strengthen the muscles to the point where you can start doing other exercises to firm your tummy up further. <br>  <br>  Hope it helped.|`|DnVeerYUaa	Targetted weight reduction is quite difficult, some would state impossible, however the only diet which really delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a handful of free trials in stock, it has been highlighted in Fox News and CNN. I shed 25 pounds, it really does work!|`|uHoHChl9aa	To strengthen your stomach muscles, all you need do is try to do 50 sit ups a day, if not all at once then split them up but if you make sure you manage 50 throughout the day you will have a noticeable difference in a matter of weeks. Also lie on your back and put your hands under your ***, palms down, then lift your legs up until you can do no more, these two exercises will target both your upper abs and lower abs individually, you will feel the difference between the two.
8uCjC3GYaa	I'm the same way, I'm literally always hungry. Although, I am a 16 year old guy, so that's to be expected.<br>  <br>  What I do is work out like a beast and turn all that food into muscle. Anyways, back to your question. Are you a teenager too? You're probably just going through a growth spurt. I wouldn't worry about it.<br>  <br>  If you gain weight easily, just go for a jog a few times a week, works like a charm. You could even weight lift to build muscle, which is what I do. What I wouldn't do is start cutting down on the food i'm eating. You seem to have a relatively healthy eating routine, so maybe all you need to do is add a little exercise to balance the equation.|`|v1GmMNoXaa	you are eating alot at night bec its a natural reaction for a starved body to crave more food and then it leads to a binge.<br>  <br>  try eating more during the day.<br>  <br>  you notice the trend that happens is bad for you so do something to help.

It's perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  "Some men are also concerned with uneven testicle size; that is, when one side seems to be bigger than the other. This is entirely normal and should not cause distress, except if there is swelling, pain, or if you feel a discernible lump.

Anywhere from 21-35 days is typical i believe.  If you are regular, you will always have cycles the same length give or take a day.  But even cycles varying by a few days wouldnt be a concern.  Keep track for a while....see when your next one starts.  If you are consistant with a 25 day cycle it will start  around march 23rd.  even with a 28 day cycle which is adverage, and what you automaticly have if you go on any birth control pill, If you would happen to start on the first of the month, your next would start on the 29th of the same month, so 2 periods in the same calander month.|`|DyHpuiR8aa	That's pretty spaced out, so it sounds pretty normal.

FKMKQbqPaa	i repressed memories of my abuse for most of my life.  i actually didnt remember until i was in my mid-thirties.  yes, you can supress the memories, and yes this may be something like that, but it may not be as well.  it may indeed just be a dream.  one thing i found is the more you replay it in your mind, it triggers other memories if it is part of something real.  when my memories returned i had no doubt it was real, but in the beginning i wondered like you are.|`|5E6hjpFjaa	Okay hun... you have been having night terrors.<br>  I had this last year to the point where my father couldn't wake me up and had to call the cops on me. I was doing just waht you were saying.<br>  I was shakeing, fighting, screaming, crying, and walking in my sleep. According to the physiciotrist at Johns Hopkins Hospital, I was having night terrors. It seemed like I was awake and hallousinating but I was actually asleep.<br>  This can be caused from depression, ptsd, anxity, manic depression, and just from the fact that you think your worst fears may become a reality.<br>  You need to go to your doctor hun, he/she will tell you whats the best thing to do.<br>  If I may make another suggestion, Go to a mental hospital to be obsurved for a couple of days. They can tell you exactlly what is wrong with you and how it can be treated.<br>  Good Luck!|`|85cd219a73d0a53be5037883da657650aa	Recovering traumatic memories is difficult, because you will always question whether they are real or not.  You're at the beginning of a long journey to recover, if that is what you choose to do.  Or you can decide to deny whatever's coming up.  It's your choice:  either do the work and recover or deny and make yourself more neurotic.<br>  <br>  What I would do is read the literature on this disorder.

NaKpEWTdaa	I'm a nurse and from my experience I can already make SOME automatic assessments on my patients based on what I see. Almost always. BUT the nurse who assisted you should have been considerate enough to orient or explain to your sister what's what. As you've said, your sister is not even underweight so it's the nurse's wrongdoing to hastily judge her. <br>  <br>  Just to clarify. Yes, it is likely to be dangerous for underweight people to donate blood. This might cause anemia, due to decrease in RBCs' or maybe hypovolemia for the blood loss. A potential donor is screened first before he/she is allowed to do so and one of the prereqs is having the right BMI or body mass index.|`|wwP3ONCFaa	Not really BUT make sure you've eaten and make sure to wait the period of time after donating that they suggest no matter how strong you think you are.

Eat more protein so that you could build some muscle and tone up the flab because where fat accumulates is already decided upon by our genes. It could be so frustrating to see fat where we don't want them to be so, I guess it would be better to concentrate on our problem areas. Don't think about the weight too much 'coz i think your weight is fine. An honest assessment of yourself when you look at the mirror is better. Rather than feeling bad, turn your weaknesses into strengths.<br>  <br>  For the arms: get some weights, extend arm forward and lift to shoulder.<br>  Back of the arm: Sit on a chair bend over, lift arms to the side, and lift weights backwards...<br>  <br>  For the tummy: Continue your sit ups.<br>  Lower tummy: Lie flat on the floor and hold on to something stable and lift both legs up together for a few reps.<br>  <br>  For the legs: Sit on a chair and do some bicycles in the air...<br>  <br>  Keep a smile on your face. Don't concentrate upon your faults. Rather see the good things about yourself. Be proud of what you have because our assets overshadow our faults if we recognize them and bring the most out of them!

0TT5q0cUaa	Sex during pregnancy is totally safe if not otherwise advised by the doctor. Most women can have sex right until the last month of their pregnancy if they do not feel uncomfortable. It is safe to have intercourse since the baby is protected by a thick mucous plug that seals the cervix and guards against infection.<br>  <br>  Some of the medical reasons which require abstaining from sex are:<br>  <br>  Recent vaginal bleeding<br>  <br>  Preterm labour<br>  <br>  Ruptured membranes (broken water bag)<br>  <br>  Placenta praevia<br>  <br>  Infection with STDs<br>  <br>  Sexual urge is idiosyncratic and may increase or decrease when a woman is pregnant. Most women however, feel a decreased urge to have sexual intercourse, which may be more due to the presence of other symptoms during pregnancy like nausea and abdominal heaviness than due to actual decrease in sexual desire. Increased sexual desire may be due to increased blood flow to the pelvic area during pregnancy. There are changes in the hormonal profile also which may cause an increase in libido. Some women enjoy unrestrained sex since the fear of an unwanted pregnancy is removed.<br>  <br>  The first trimester is usually the worst time for a woman to think about sex since most women experience breast tenderness and morning sickness during the first three months. They may also be tired both physically and emotionally due to the novelty of the situation. By the second trimester the situation eases considerably and couples are more likely to resume their normal sexual relations. However, these preferences are purely individual and may vary from one couple to another.<br>  <br>  By the third trimester, physical discomfort is usually increased to a large extent. This may prompt couples to adopt alternate sexual positions so that the discomfort is alleviated. The "woman on top" position may be more suitable and enjoyable than the conventional "man on top" one. The rear entry position may also be tried out.|`|FaQlPq7Xaa	Eeeeeeeeewwwwwww!!!!!|`|3zl6DrjVaa	it is ok|`|hZWup7xXaa	you can have sex threw out your whole pregnancy, its actually good for you as it makes your muscles stronger and helps for when you are pushing while in labour. at is completely fine that he comes inside, there is no harm to the baby as your cervix is completely closed and there is no way of the come going in, my favorite position while i was pregnant was one my side, and he was on his side, there wasn't a whole lot of pressure and it feels really good this way. hope this helps hun and congrats :)|`|9yky3Q9saa	1. If you are having a normal, uneventful pregnancy and your doctor doesn't recommend against either, I don't see why not. This side position does seem to be nice, doesn't it...<br>  2. If you don't want to have sex, your husband shouldn't pressure you into it.<br>  3. I'd be kind of disturbed, someday thinking that maybe my parents were having sex...with me, but your sexual health shouldn't suffer because you're pregnant :)|`|0psxM4o4aa	It's fine.  In fact it is encouraged!|`|3rvsG372aa	They say that it is safe to have sex while pregnant up to the point of your water breaking.  There is no harm to the baby and actually it may benefit him with your additional exercise.  As far the styles which are safe, I would say don't try anything dangerous or any compromising positions.  Make sure it's not too rough and that you aren't lying on your stomach throughout intercourse.  Also, there is no need to worry about protection, the baby is already protected by the amniotic sack so he won't be bothered by any "little swimmers".|`|ZZ32oTfwaa	I just can say one or two things.Under the given circumstances,only a doctor can advise you the best thing and do according to doctor's advice only because there are lots of factors affecting the entire matter and which can be judged only after thorough check up by a doctor.But as a layman,I am of the view that such activities be stopped till the safe delivery because any thing may have side effect.At present,bigger issue should be how the safe delivery is possible and not any thing else.After all,you are having your entire life in your hand to enjoy all these things.There must be not that much of hurry at all.|`|R1hilksEaa	no problem you can have till end that is till u percieve a baby or boy..<br>  <br>  dont use condoms , if he has sex with u... no problem<br>  <br>  but if he has sex with others then tell him to use condoms..<br>  <br>  you can do sex in normal positions...but his weight should not be more on stomach...<br>  <br>  ok<br>  <br>  bye|`|FnnMfuGkaa	im pretty sure it is okay whenever and no side effects. you might find some stuff on google but i tihnk you can have sex as much as you want on pregnancy. and try on your side thats what they did on knocked up lol|`|zD0V9nQraa	You and your husband can enjoy sex without any harmful consequences.<br>  As for your husband ejaculating inside your vagina, it poses absolutely no threat.|`|BuztPXvDaa	yes u can do sex in pregency, but smooth sex not hard u have to done , doggy style is good|`|vb0FO6k0aa	there is no harm in sex. up to 7 months|`|EtDGRJPSaa	no problem but care fully|`|DyHpuiR8aa	I'm afraid that I can't really help you here.  All I can really suggest is that you ask someone like your doctor or mid-wife - just to make sure there's anything to avoid.<br>  <br>  As far as I know, it's ok to have sex throughout pregnancy, so long as you're in a comfortable position.  (I only know that because they recommend it for inducing labour... Sex + Curry = Early baby :/ )<br>  <br>  Try to look into different positions - I'm not sure if your midwife could suggest any or whether you need to make n independent search for them.

TKNPveHDaa	First, you didn't hit a plateau.  That only happens with highly-trained athletes at the peak of their performance.<br>  <br>  Here are a few things you can start doing immediately to bring weight back down.<br>  <br>  1.  Keep a food journal.  Write down every single little thing that goes in your mouth.  Keep track of about how much you eat and why you eat it.  If you eat because you're bored, you can learn to stop consuming those calories.<br>  <br>  2.  Diets don't mean you're hungry.  You should never drop metabolism because you're dieting.  Diets simply mean you eat food consisting of whole wheat breads and pastas, a lot of fruits and veggies, lean meats that you bake, grill, or broil, and reduced amounts of snacks, beers, sodas, sweets, and cakes.  Take fruit with you as a snack instead of going to a vending machine.  <br>  <br>  3.  Instead of getting on the treadmill, get outside and walk for 30-40 minutes a night if possible.  If not, go at least 4-5 times a week.  You burn more calories walking outside vs. a treadmill and it's more enjoyable to get outside of your house.<br>  <br>  Also, try not to sit and watch tv as much.  Read a book, do a crossword, do other things outside of sitting there like a lump.<br>  <br>  Try these things for a month.  I promise you'll lose some weight.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1T1rHTGBaa	try adding 3 day session of yoga or pilates - it really helped me when I was losing weight. You can purchase a dvd from a retail stores - I even got a few from a local Dollar Store!!<br>  <br>  keep in mind that you have to burn 3500 calories to lose a lb of fat, but also watch the intake of calories per day. Your body will adapt to the change and therefore make you have to work harder as time goes on.

PS0oSoXFaa	Well, it's extremely bitter, for certain, but it seems justified to me. I know alcoholics have problems and deserve pity, but their children are still totally right to be furious... Have you told her any of this, directly, calmly, though? If I were a parent I *would* be offended if this were the first time I was told all this so bluntly. Killing yourself (or even just planning it) and leaving a bitter note is such an extreme blow, it would only be deserved if you had tried already to communicate honestly and were brushed off.<br>  <br>  How old are you? Because you sound older, like you're independent... If this is the case, and you haven't told her this so bluntly before, I think you should write her a letter. It's not as traumatic as a bitter suicide note, but she shouldn't be so able to blow it off or ignore you if it isn't in person. And if you haven't told her any of this, you have to! It doesn't matter if this is old and you're not suicidal anymore, the feelings are still there and have to be addressed...<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|OTONc0Fqaa	You need to destroy this letter.

Leaving it a long time is the worst possible thing. Offer to go with her, tell her you are worried, she might just do it for you.<br>  good luck x|`|C8Djjxqkaa	Go to a doctor. You shouldn't wait so long if you have pain. If you are in the UK call NHS Direct 0845 4647 but I'm sure they will tell you the same thing.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	To find out what is wrong with your mum she has to go to a doctor who can examine her, take a full medical history and run any tests that are needed to diagnose what the problem is. I am afraid no one on this site can wave a magic wand and diagnose what is wrong with your mum with the details to hand. Persuade her to go to the doctors and get a proper diagnosis and treatment for it. Good luck|`|uZSTgSUcaa	how old is your mom?<br>  <br>  not ulcer if there is blood in the urine, it means she might have some sort of peritonitus ( infection of the abdomin) or you need to go see a doctor because it sounds dangerous<br>  <br>  hope you all the best :)
GGAgxzJNaa	People do it all the time.  You'll just sleep, and when you wake up, you'll feel a little groggy for a while.  Stop worrying.  You'll be just like the kid in this video:|`|AA11315360	No dont worry. I have had it before. They put a lemon smell on a mask and put it over my face and had me count down from 100. This was in a hospital for a surgery.<br>  For you they may not do that. <br>  When I had my impacted wisdom teeth out they put me out. I think they gave me an injection. I basically dont even remember the whole thing except sitting down in the chair and then afterwards waking up.|`|deAyKj2Uaa	i was put under for a similar thing.  general anesthesia is nothing to worry about.  it is very quick and absolutley painless.  when they wake you up, you wont even know you were out.|`|JhIckFOXaa	I was really nervous when I went to get my wisdom teeth out, but it was fine.|`|ei0e7RwOaa	I would be more afraid of Private Pain.|`|aCDWwsisaa	Thousands of people are put under general anesthesia every day...there is a higher chance that you will be struck by lightning on your way to the dentist than there is that something will "go wrong"...
lHLIgzGCaa	Well I have lunch at school so I don't have much time to brush my teeth so I put it on after eating. But I always brush them (w/ toothpaste) when I get home.|`|oDz0FQpEaa	Yes if you can brush your teeth you should. If it is not possible to brush your teeth right away you can put your retainer in again but brush your teeth and clean your retainer as soon as possible. <br>  Hope this helps|`|deAyKj2Uaa	you dont have to brush first, but you might want to.  if youve got food in your teeth and you put the retainer in, it might feel kinda gross.  if you are at school, you can buy a travel toothbrush and toothpaste to keep in your locker.  its about 3 dollars and the toothbrush folds in half so it wont take up much space.  i would absolutley brush before putting it back in.  help keep your smile as great as your braces made them.  :) :)|`|rgrXEFuaaa	Nah just brush your teeth and your retainer before you go to bed. Don't ever eat with your retainer in. I done that once when I was at a meal with a bunch of ponces so I didn't want to whack it out in front of all of them but I didn't want to look a fool and not eat. What other choice did I have. <br>  <br>  So yeah don't ever do that either lol|`|sXNtTETbaa	you obviously want to look after your teeth, so i would just to prevent any staining|`|uFiJaR7vaa	i would brush my teeth. it makes sense.........right???|`|emUlZaKhaa	You make some friends, you lonely mofo.
IKakoOfyaa	Creatine is indeed in milk and milk products.  Higher levels are often detected if the milk/milk product is pasteurized.  <br>  <br>  It is also a naturally appearing amino acid in the body that helps to supply energy to muscle and nerve cells<br>  <br>  ***********************<br>  From <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/creatine/NS_patient-creatine" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/creatin...</a><br>  <br>  "Pasteurized cow's milk appears to contain higher levels of creatine than human milk. The clinical significance of this is not clear. "|`|ENsVu5Llaa	its not a milk product. its from red meat|`|o5HQIKhnaa	No it is not a milk product you will be ok if you take it but be aware that your body naturally produces its own creatine so if you take creatine for an extended period of time without taking a break your body will get lazy and stop producing creatine which is not good, its like steroids when you take them your pumping artificial testesterone into yout body so after a while your body gets lazy and stops producing testesterone thats why you will see alot of steroid users take testesterone boosters once they are done with their cycle to return their body to its natural state, not that creatine has anything to do with steroids its far from it im just showing you an example i would recommend taking it for 6-8 weeks then breaking for 4-6 then resuming again that will give your body enough time to regulate itself and trust me you will get bigger and stronger and dont be fooled by anyone telling you creatine is dangerous ITS NOT as long as you take it the right way as i have described its been around for 20 years and theres no evidence that it harms your body, i got off course here but i just want you to understand what you are taking because alot of times people dont its important to know what you are putting into your body.|`|AG7RcqzPaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Its just an amino acid that helps the trasport (ATP) of energy to muscles, I used this as one of my supplements as I go to the gym 5 days a week.<br>  <br>  Without going to complex of what it does or what it is and just to answer your question, no it is not part of casein or derived from milk. Creatine also naturally comes from red meat, chicken, or fish.<br>  <br>  Therefore would have had allergic reaction to meat aswell as it has creatine in it. <br>  <br>  I use creatine to give me more energy in lifting weights specially heavy ones eg. squats or bench pressess as it helps slow lactic acid build up.<br>  <br>  hope this takes away your worries!!<br>  <br>  cheers,<br>   <br>  Rob|`|8uCjC3GYaa	It comes from meat. A steak has a small amount of Creatine in it, and scientists just isolated the creatine because it was the useful agent that athletes wanted.|`|4IXQ97rNaa	It's a mineral of sorts and is non dairy, although John Cena puts it in his coffee.
TKNPveHDaa	Cardio.  Running, walking, and dancing will help drop fat in your arms.  Also, if you do lift weights, you won't gain much muscle.  You're a girl, so you have very low levels of testosterone and you won't be able to put on muscle the way guys do.   You'll get toned, especially if you do high reps of light weights.  If you have weights at home, do 20 reps of 5 lb curls twice for each arm.  That'll help and I promise no big muscles.<br>  <br>  Good lucK!|`|f1lpdiNEaa	You need to do cardio exercise - things like running, jogging, skipping, swimming. <br>  <br>  If you combine this with arm weight routines using a 1kg weight (no heavier) you'll tone your arms up nicely without them becoming muscley.<br>  <br>  Or yoga and pilates are good for stretching your muscles and making arms look longer and leaner.|`|aAupgOiQaa	Do cardio exercises like running and swimming. Don't use weights or do body tonning exercises. Apparently, Liquorice tea is good for slimmer arms but don't quote me on it.<br>  <br>  DO SOME SWEATING!!!<br>  <br>  Take care!|`|8uCjC3GYaa	Go swimming, have you ever seen pro swimmers? They are the leanest people on earth.|`|MF9YknDYaa	You can't really|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	Technically, you alareday have muscles. What's wrong with them being visble and toned-looking? My arm muscles are from constantly lifting, putting down and carrying my 19-pound 17-month-old daughter. I think they look good, because it helps show that I take care of myself. When my daughter was about ten months old, we visited some friends whom we hadn't seen in several months. One of them held my daughter and commented on how light she was. (She is small for her age, but very healthy.) I flexed my arm muscles and said that I didn't get these from carrying a sack of feathers for ten months. <br>  <br>  However, things like yoga will help with not getting the defined look. Yoga is great for mind, body and spirit and I miss it.
FlsrXuJOaa	coffee in moderation is just fine! A lot of studies are actually showing that it kick-starts your metabolism and can be very beneficial before a workout. However, other studies show that it is an appetite stimulant. If you are using low fat milk and a non-sugar sweetener, it sounds like your coffee intake is just fine. As long as you are keeping your appetite under control coffee will not hurt you. Good job for cutting out refined sugar!|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	So, drink coffee. This morning I had a small pot of Equal Exchange organic coffee. Coffee gets "bad" when they are like Frappuccinos-- laden with milk, whipped cream, chocolate, sugar, etc. Occasionally, I do add organic soy milk to my coffee, but that's usually just to help cool it down more quickly. Still, it's only a few calories and it's soy milk, so it's not "bad". (I also had Cheerios, store brand honey nut Os, and organic vanilla soy milk for breakfast.)<br>  <br>  I don't care for instant coffee, but that's just my own tastes. It's not as though you're going to Starbucks (or a coffee house) and ordering a Frappuccino and a fat free chocolate muffin and think you're having a "healthy" breakfast.|`|VPkuM2xWaa	Water water water is a good fuel. Eat more protein.|`|lPc7UEC5aa	Avoid the spam reponses...<br>  <br>  Coffee/caffeine is not all bad for diets!  The only problem is coffee will dehydrate you, so just make sure you have enough water throughout the day.<br>  <br>  I will usually have a cup of black tea in the morning with breakfast (then workout an hour and a half later) or have a cup or two of black coffee after my workout.  <br>  <br>  Men's Health had an article about a study with caffeine helping amino acids in muscles after lifting (but the test was with some insane amount, like 6 cups).<br>  <br>  Short & sweet.  Keep some caffeine in your diet, remove the sweetners, hydrate!|`|4IXQ97rNaa	No, coffee is totally good for losing weight in fact I just lost 6 pounds OMG by just drinking six cups before and now Im like all hyper and its so magical because I poop a lot and I have all this like energy and stuff AAAAUUUUGGGHHH!!!!
yHHdAMnQaa	Yes you can go to counseling and talk about anything... go to a counselor and talk about your problems, a counselor is like a Friend where you talk about practically anything and your deep secrets and things you happy or unhappy with...<br>  <br>  Hope you find a wonderful counselor and let all your problems out..|`|fZw6ImUGaa	How do you know you need counselling when you don't know what a counsellor does?|`|kcmRROk0aa	Yes, you can go to a counselor for just about anything! They are there to listen and to help you find new ways of thinking about things.<br>  <br>  They will want to know some of your history and they will want to know what sort of problems you are having.<br>  <br>  What I like about counselors is that they don't "know" you and they don't judge you -- they're there to listen (to *anything* you have to say) and to help you.<br>  <br>  No need to be shy. You are not alone in your problems and they will most likely have worked with someone who has the same problems as you!<br>  <br>  Good luck! If you really want to change things, you might as well at least *try* counseling. If it doesn't work for you, at least you'll know that you did something to try and improve your situation.|`|V1R48qJaaa	usually when you need an advice.yes, counseling works. <br>   maybe you have social anxiety disorders.<br>  it's good you're aware that you have mental problems. <br>  you need treatment from a psyhologist, not just counselling.<br>  <br>  AVOID drinking COFFEE/TEA|`|5f1879b71fedf4df6f4efa186593064caa	it does help, but you must take the first step, like now then the next one , then it will all fall into place with the right help , good luck

kdSuwt8paa	If you quit for a whole year you know how to do that part.    Not starting again seems to be your problem.     Decide to quit next Monday (or whatever day you decide)   In the lead up - tell yourself 3 days until I am a non-smoker, 2 days until I am a non-smoker etc and when you wake up on the morning remind yourself straight away.    I used patches for a few days but found them irritating.    (Just another way of making money out of smokers!)   Clean your teeth quite often, but also make a jug of iced.  When you feel the need for a cigarette slowly drink a glass of iced tea.    The caffeine in it will take the edge of the thought of smoking.     (No milk in the tea of course.)      After a few days you will find you don't even think of your iced tea so often.  Keep telling yourself you are a non-smoker.    When you feel stress drink iced tea.  If you don't drink tea you have to have coke I suppose, but that is not very good for you, although it will give your caffeine hit!  Never forget you are a non-smoker - especially when you are out and about with smokers.|`|uFSDEo9Uaa	<a href="http://stopsmoking.eu.pn/" rel="nofollow">http://stopsmoking.eu.pn/</a> is a new approach on quitting for free.<br>  The site is designed for everyone who seriously wants to stop smoking.<br>  <br>  It doesn’t matter if you are a five a day teenager, or a one hundred a day pensioner, male or female, or if this is your first or fiftieth attempt at stopping - if you really want to stop smoking then this is the site for you, and it's free.|`|kvMpnX6maa	A friend of mine asked his doctor for some help and he prescribed him Chantix which is a medication that actually blocks the nicotine from the brain, thus taking away the desire for him to smoke.  He can even sit around other smokers and it doesn't bother him.  It {the meds} comes with a plan where you start the meds but continue to smoke for the 1st week but on the 8th day you try to quit altogether.  Like I said, it worked like a charm for my friend and he had smoked for 30 years.  Good Luck!! I really hope you find what works for you.|`|P9OrskkYaa	I used hypnotherapy to quit smoking.

I had smoked for over 20 years, and I started with the patch but the glue on it hurt my skin.  The doctor gave me a 'script for Champix  (In U.S.A. it's called Chantix).  It wasn't covered by my provider,and it was expensive;  about $140 for a month but it is soooooo worth it.  I feel great, and I don't think I will ever be a smoker again.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!  If you really want to quit, that's when you will.  :D

No matter if I am staying at a hotel, friends house, family members house or camping outdoors, I always sleep in my briefs. They are more comfortable and supportive plus they look better then other kinds of underwear. I wear a pair of briefs all day until after my workout, then I change into another pair for the remainder of the day and to sleep in.

(not)<br>  For a teen physical, the doctor is going to first talk to you, to A) put you at ease, and B) determine if there are any specific health complaints or questions you may have. Depending on the doctor, this may begin with you dressed in street clothes. <br>  Uusually you are asked to put on a hospital gown, and sometimes told to leave your underwear on, sometimes not. Depends on the Doctor. <br>  Then your eyes, ears, nose, throat and skin are checked. Your BP taken, and your pulse. The doctor will listen to your heart and lungs, and "thump" your abdomen, to check for any abdominal issue. <br>  <br>  The last check is a quick check for hernia. (The doctor inserts his/her finger to the left and then the right of your penis, presses against your lower abdominal wall, and asks you to cough. Then he/she does a quick feel of each testicle, to make sure there are no abnormal lumps.<br>  Do not stress over this part. Doctors are very sensitive to the modesty issue with their patients, and will not only do this part of the exam quickly, you will notice they will most likely be averting their eyes will doing the two tasks. <br>  Dont sweat it, it is quick, and Doctors see "junk" constantly.|`|7nHuDxivaa	There's no etiquette to what kind of underwear you wear to the doctor's.

However, the exact procedure will vary according to the needs of the patient and the preferences of the examiner. An average examination takes about 30 minutes. The cost of the examination will depend on the charge for the professional's time and any tests that are done. Most health plans cover routine physical examinations including some tests.<br>  <br>  First, the examiner will observe the patient's appearance, general health, and behavior, along with measuring height and weight. The vital signs-including pulse, breathing rate, body temperature, and blood pressure-are recorded.<br>  <br>  With the patient sitting up, the following systems are reviewed:<br>  <br>  -Skin. The exposed areas of the skin are observed; the size and shape of any lesions are noted.<br>  -Head. The hair, scalp, skull, and face are examined.<br>  -Eyes. The external structures are observed. The internal structures can be observed using an ophthalmoscope (a lighted instrument) in a darkened room.<br>  -Ears. The external structures are inspected. A lighted instrument called an otoscope may be used to inspect internal structures.<br>  -Nose and sinuses. The external nose is examined. The nasal mucosa and internal structures can be observed with the use of a penlight and a nasal speculum.<br>  -Mouth and pharynx. The lips, gums, teeth, roof of the mouth, tongue, and pharynx are inspected.<br>  -Neck. The lymph nodes on both sides of the neck and the thyroid gland are palpated (examined by feeling with the fingers).<br>  -Back. The spine and muscles of the back are palpated and checked for tenderness. The upper back, where the lungs are located, is palpated on the right and left sides and a stethoscope is used to listen for breath sounds.<br>  -Breasts and armpits. A woman's breasts are inspected with the arms relaxed and then raised. In both men and women, the lymph nodes in the armpits are felt with the examiner's hands.While the patient is still sitting, movement of the joints in the hands, arms, shoulders, neck, and jaw can be checked.<br>  <br>  Then while the patient is lying down on the examining table, the examination includes:<br>  -Breasts. The breasts are palpated and inspected for lumps.<br>  -Front of chest and lungs. The area is inspected with the fingers, using palpation and percussion. A stethoscope is used to listen to the internal breath sounds.<br>  The head should be slightly raised for:<br>  -Heart. A stethoscope is used to listen to the heart's rate and rhythm. The blood vessels in the neck are observed and palpated.<br>  The patient should lie flat for:<br>  -Abdomen. Light and deep palpation is used on the abdomen to feel the outlines of internal organs including the liver, spleen, kidneys, and aorta, a large blood vessel.<br>  -Rectum and anus. With the patient lying on the left side, the outside areas are observed. An internal digital examination (using a finger), is usually done if the patient is over 40 years old. In men, the prostate gland is also palpated.<br>  -Reproductive organs. The external sex organs are inspected and the area is examined for hernias. In men, the scrotum is palpated. In women, a pelvic examination is done using a speculum and a Papamnicolaou test (Pap test) may be taken.<br>  -Legs. With the patient lying flat, the legs are inspected for swelling, and pulses in the knee, thigh, and foot area are found. The groin area is palpated for the presence of lymph nodes. The joints and muscles are observed.<br>  -Musculoskeletel system. With the patient standing, the straightness of the spine and the alignment of the legs and feet is noted.<br>  -Blood vessels. The presence of any abnormally enlarged veins (varicose), usually in the legs, is noted.<br>  In addition to evaluating the patient's alertness and mental ability during the initial conversation, additional inspection of the nervous system may be indicated:<br>  -Neurologic screen. The patient's ability to take a few steps, hop, and do deep knee bends is observed. The strength of the hand grip is felt. With the patient sitting down, the reflexes in the knees and feet can be tested with a small hammer. The sense of touch in the hands and feet can be evaluated by testing reaction to pain and vibration.<br>  Sometimes additional time is spent examining the 12 nerves in the head (cranial) that are connected directly to the brain. They control the sense of smell, strength of muscles in the head, reflexes in the eye, facial movements, gag reflex, and muscles in the jaw. General muscle tone and coordination, and the reaction of the abdominal area to stimulants like pain, temperature, and touch would also be evaluated.<br>  <br>  For more information go to <a href="http://www.healthatoz.com/healthatoz/Atoz/common/standard/transform.jsp?requestURI=/healthatoz/Atoz/ency/physical_examination.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthatoz.com/healthatoz/Ato...</a><br>  <br>  Bye, Good Luck! ;D
9yky3Q9saa	I'd wait until the next round, to get the timing perfect--then again, calling your doctor and asking him/her shouldn't hurt. @_@|`|EMbaak9waa	Listen to your doctor and take them when you start your period.|`|1thzSbS8aa	If you start taking them tonight, they will not protect you against pregnancy tonight.<br>  <br>  Birth control pills have to be started a good while BEFORE ovulation, or they can't prevent it happening.

It is quiet normal to feel that way when you are not working. Many people don't feel they are part of life. Time seems to fly by and you can get stuck in a rut. Avoiding social situations is normal as you wouldn't have much money or feel intimated as you don't have much to say what is going on in your life right now. But in turn it feeds the loneliness and isolation that humans need. I think you could be depressed but most people not working for some time would be. Maybe you need to set some structure into your day. Make a effort to get out even if it is just for a walk. Try to keep your social connections it will help a lot. <br>  <br>  Keep busy with productive stuff, take some time out to set some goals.<br>  <br>  Listen to some motivational speakers, anything that will boost you and get your motivation back.<br>  <br>  Exercise when you can. <br>  <br>  Realise it will pass, even though it don't feel like it right now. <br>  <br>  Think about others that are much worse then you. <br>  <br>  Be thankful for what you do have. <br>  <br>  Just do your best. Things do change!|`|z1VUlArjaa	i really feel for you, i felt like that when i lost my job<br>  you sound like you are depressed and probably depressed because you bored because you don't have a job<br>  if your finding it hard to find a job why not try some volunteering work<br>  it will keep your mind busy and you will be helping others wich can be rewarding and your start feeling better within in yourself|`|2oPTgm9baa	It sounds like a bad case of depression, you feel sad all the time but can't quite put your finger on why.

You're severely depressed, *at the least*- I think you have a personality disorder like me, but I'm no psychiatrist.  Crying for no reason, suicidal thoughts (I actually had an attempt), hopelessness and confusion, the certainty you'll die, and oh my god, the "emptiness" and isolation you're describing... I've had all of these. I was unemployed too and dropped out of school for a while, couldn't concentrate. Look up borderline personality disorder and see if it seems to fit; it could be another personality disorder too. <br>  <br>  Listen to me, it is very likely something traumatic happened to you that you can't remember, you're showing all the signs... you *need* to get help. Don't go to just some therapist, see a real psychiatrist. What you're describing is more than depression, and quite obviously it's not normal!|`|8UHWm3j4aa	depressed. You should pray to God and Ask for forgivness and for his son to come into your life. I was depressed when i was 14 and I really tried to kill myself 2 times, but i didnt. I had an obsession with thinking about stabing my self, both times I got a knife and then I couldent do it. I think their was a reason why i didnt do it, I felt like someone was telling me not to. now 16 I pray to God when ever i get a chance and my life and my soul is good.|`|aAdmCZAyaa	You need to see your GP.you have depression,and medication over time,can help.I stress it takes time.I have experience of this.Dont give up hope.Good Luck!|`|gqaZP4R3aa	dont kill yurself im da same way. butt not as bad.|`|9tC8zz5Zaa	go and see a doctor. i think you need to.<br>  good luck|`|85cd219a73d0a53be5037883da657650aa	If you've been out of work for over a year, that's enough to cause depression.  You don't say how your situation came about: did you get laid off?  <br>  <br>  You need some goals to keep you moving forward and to keep those negative voices at bay.  Thoughts are incredibly powerful and sometimes they tell lies that aren't true about yourself.  You need to rouse yourself out of your self-pitying state and get busy!<br>  <br>  You and only you can save yourself.  Decide that you're going to stop immediately thinking all the negative thoughts that you've allowed to poison your spirit and motivation.  You allowed these negative thoughts to send you into a downward spiral.  Now you must pull yourself out of this mire and set realistic goals for yourself.  If these goals don't work out, reset them.<br>  <br>  Find an activity to get yourself motivated:  go to the gym and work out, where you'll be around people.  Just being around people will help.  There's nothing wrong with you that making a firm decision to believe in yourself and your goals won't cure.<br>  <br>  Look, life's not easy, you're going to go through rough patches every now and then.  And you're not alone.  There are plenty of people who've lost their jobs over the last several months.  Watch the news and discover there are many people out there who are also having a hard time.  Listen to their stories, how their positive attitudes help to keep them going.  Even if you don't have any close friends or family, staying connected through the media can help you put your own problems in perspective.|`|FsXTyGH9aa	It is very common when we do not have a job to feel the way you are feeling..you are not mental! <br>  What you need to do is make yourself a home buisness. Or if you cant do that just get a job anywhere. Or you could take up a hobby, you just need to do SOMETHING..otherwise it is like your brain is shutting down... i mean nobody likes going to work..but it actully keeps us sane and we get our confidence and motivation from achieving something at work...and as you are not achieveing anything this why you feel so low. <br>  For example, try buying Mr Site... it is a complete idiots guide to building a website.. it soo easy...trust me I did it and im 22 and blonde!!lol! and everyone says wow what an amazing site!<br>  You could get things wholesale and sell them on your site or something....it will give you some achievment and make you feel better.. I also think it would be very important for you now to start ritual excersize and building up muscle, this again will give a achievment. ALSO, why dont you start selling things on ebay???? <br>  Hope this helps! If you have any other questions add me.<br>  Oh yea also, my brother was going throught the same as you but worse, and he got a program called reason on his laptop and starting making music..he is great now! x|`|kBZkTtaraa	Your body might be reacting to something in your environment that got past your five senses.

I think what you have is a form or depression and when it is as severe as your is, it's time to consult a Dr. Believe it or not, a lot of us go though times of isolation and crying, not wanting to leave the house and so on. obviously something from your past or just life in general has triggered this, times are hard, you just need to figure out what the root of the problem is and overcome it. (Sometimes easier said than done) As hard as it is, you HAVE to get out of the house and do something, rather it's just going for a walk or getting to see that Dr, you need some air. Life is to short to dwell on the things in life that try to tear us apart from who we really are.|`|bw6iM8Nxaa	You sound depressed;<br>  maybe from loss of job or loneliness.<br>  I do these things when I'm angry or upset and usually it calms me down.<br>  go to a gym and workout<br>  go for a run or a job<br>  get a girlfriend<br>  go to a club<br>  turn your music up really loud<br>  see a counselor.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, suicide is not that answer. I have heard of many people with worse conditions and they are some of the most inspiring people. The don't sit and mope about things that are wrong in their life. So get some confidence boy! Go out there and live your life. And hey! If you have to cry periodically throughout the day, so what! Do it if it makes you feel better! So good luck and I hope you feel better(:|`|gB9p09rXaa	I would say that you definitely need to visit your doctor. It definitely sounds like you may be suffering from depression, just like everyone else has been saying. There is help out there for you! You may need to have counselling and/or anti-depressants. <br>  It sounds like from what you have written that you believe being unemployed has something to do with this. It also sounds like you may be suffering from panic attacks. <br>  When you suffer from depression it is very difficult to even want to talk to anyone - which you have stated you are feeling. You are not mental though and do not feel ashamed! - most people go through this at one point in their lives. It is very important that you seek help. Also I would recommend that you start taking up hobbies and exercise. You will not feel like doing this, but once you start you will feel instantly better. This is proven (it is due to endorphins being released.) <br>  When you say you felt suicidal, you need to question yourself weather you actually feel like ending it forever. In which case see your doctor now! You need immediate treatment. If however, you feel that it may be an attempt at cry for help (whether you want people to take you seriously, show people how bad you feel etc etc) still see a doctor as as long as you stress how low you are feeling - you will be taken seriously.
BK2ammwzaa	Hi Charlize,<br>  There is no one, typical response to sexual assault. Although some reactions are common to all victims, others are individual responses. How you feel will differ over time.<br>  As the weeks and months pass during the process of recovery, there will be times when you forget the rape. It is a time in which your mind is making sense of the events of the rape, how you feel about others and how you feel about yourself, which is a protective mechanism.<br>  At other times you may experience many emotions.<br>      * Guilt<br>      * Betrayal<br>      * Shame<br>      * Nightmares<br>      * Sadness/Helplessness<br>      * Not wanting to be touched<br>      * Anger<br>  Healing takes as long as it takes.  Some people find talking to a counsellor helpful.  This can be done in person, on the phone or on the internet.  Overall information is crucial to helping recovery.  There is some really good information about rape and recovery on the website below.  I wish you well on your journey.|`|F32uPjAraa	Have you considered hypnotherapy? There is a process called Time Line Therapy, where you envisage time in your mind as linear. As a line travelling from the past into the future, and travelling along this line in your mind, back to a point in your time-line before the traumatic event. Once there you are shown how you felt before the event, and accept that you once again feel that way. Once this has been achieved, you come forward again, dealing with every event where the negative event had a limiting effect upon your life. This process really does work. I have used it my self for a similar event in my own life. The person that showed me was a practitioner of Neuro Linguistic Programming. NLP. I am sure that you will have a positive outcome if you use this wonderful knowledge. The beauty of this type of therapy, is that you only need do it the one time. Unlike regular therapy, where you are forced to go over and over again, and still not be guaranteed a positive outcome.|`|5E6hjpFjaa	Okay...I know how you feel.<br>  I was raped when I was 12 years old because I was homeless and was out at a park at 2 in the morning.

Granted if they would eat less they would shed the pounds that cause the back and knee pain but then some could have a thyroid problem that would make it hard for them to lose the weight.  <br>  Many people just don't know how to eat right, they prefer convenience over standing in the kitchen chopping vegetables and fruit for hours on end.   I get a box of fruit and veggies once a week from a local producer, I literally stand on my feet for 2 -3 hours, washing, chopping and bagging.  Or washing and chopping to putting in plastic tubs for individual servings while I cook a vegetable soup that will also be put in individual serving containers and then frozen. <br>  It is a work out, it is definitely something  you have to plan out and many people have other things they need to do like work for a living. <br>  To go from a bad habit to a good habit takes courage.<br>   I don't think a lot of  people have the courage to do what is right anymore many have just given up.

f8mLpPXlaa	Don't worry about it. Your doctor can't tell your Mom anything you don't want him/her to. There is patient- doctor confidentiality and you are the patient. It's probably a bladder infection which can be explained away other ways.|`|gNBO8M71aa	If it were mild, then you could probably just drink more water and fluids in general and wait it out. BUT, if there's blood, then it's already to the point that you probably need antibiotics. Don't mess around, cuz it could spread up to your kidneys and cause MUCH pain and other complications. The doctor is not allowed to tell your mother anything like that if you request that he/she not tell her. It's patient/doctor confidentiality. Honestly, you'll probably just have to pee in a cup. There most likely won't be any kind of vaginal exam unless your pee test comes back negative for infection. So take up your mother's offer to take you in to be checked out.|`|dhYFbTvkaa	Having a Urinary tract infection is something you don't want to wait around for. If the doctors don't take care of it now then the infection can move to your bladder first and then to your kidneys. so with this being said it will hurt more in the long run  and  in the end result you will have a bigger problem on your hands.  With your pee having a pinkish color to it is any more of a reason to go to the doctors. That could mean something more serious then you may think.

Make sure that you leave your piercings alone also. The less irritation, the smoother the healing process.|`|dK6YGyNyaa	There is a possibility it is infected, new piercings are especially susceptible to infection. It could also just be the natural swelling that occurs - remember your body is going to try to heal the "wound", so of course it will swell. Keep cleaning it regularly and if it doesn't improve or gets worse, consult the place you got the piercing, or failing that, consult your doctor.|`|RuQ1MOsQaa	its probably very serious and your going to die|`|f1lpdiNEaa	If I wear earrings that aren't real gold or silver my lobes swell so maybe you could try swapping them for another pair and see if they feel better?<br>  <br>  Also make sure the butterflys aren't too tight against the back of your ear lobe. Keep them clean and keep on eye on it. Ear piercing is quite strightforward so if they continue to swell and get very painful you might want to think about taking them out.|`|98LDN0Quaa	Its probably just swollen from you laying on it...dont keep touching it and try to wear real gold for a while you might be sensative to other types of metals...keep it clean And again DONT KEEP TOUCHING IT.|`|NelWFq5Paa	yes you have to clean it
V12HSfNAaa	go to the doctor.|`|fqboOITjaa	I suffered from this condition when I was younger. It pretty much ****** up a relationship I was in at the time. Anyway I went to my doctor who wasn't much help. <br>  <br>  I logged onto www.vaginismus.com and got a kit off it. There's a book and everything with it and I found it very helpful. I then went to a different doctor who told me that with time it can be completely cured. So with the help of that doctor and the kit I'm finally over it and have never looked back. <br>  <br>  I would strongly recommend you see a doctor because I know how hard it can be. Also an understanding man is a big help! :) Good luck!

l0yesNhdaa	Hi there<br>  Anxiety is a normal response to fear.  The problem can arise when you have transposed anxiety on to a situation that you can control.<br>  I went through a very stressful phase and suddenly found that I could not drive my car.  I have had the Morris Minor for 25 years but suddenly was unable to drive again.<br>  If you know what is causing you to be fearful then face it or walk away.  I would have concerns about seeking medical help as you may be given medication.<br>  Read up on "fight, flight or freeze" response to stress.<br>  Make sure you are eating a healthy diet and getting enough sleep.  Then spoil yourself with indulgent treats.<br>  Good luck.  Best wishes from Sue|`|AA11570675	Anxiety is normal & necessary in some situations too. For example to stop you taking silly risks.<br>  I guess you're talking about generalised anxiety. Can you remember a time when you weren't anxious? If so maybe something happened since that may have caused anxiety & its spread to other stuff. <br>  I've found the following foods help a bit. First the high tryptophan ones like bananas, chocolate, fish oil & marmite, then ones that encourage a good level of selenium such as fruit juices with vitamins A,C & E in them. Finally, all that anxiety can deplete your brain, but a slice of brawn (from a butcher) once or twice a week will help restore it. Just eat the brawn as you would eat ham, it's basically the same but contains brain & it really does work.<br>  But above all you need exercise. Not just gentle stuff like walking, but something really demanding for a couple of hours each day so it will burn off all the adrenaline that gets released by anxiety & give you a serotonin high. Once you get used to it & your fitness increases, you'll find the exercise bit really fun & addictive & the anxiety will disappear.|`|kTRcYaFcaa	Yes is the answer Mr K - and that is the answer from someone who had 13 years of suffering from it as well!!<br>  <br>  My mistake was in not seeking help early on - the old macho male thing.<br>  <br>  See the site below - and just follow the links, it will give you all the info you want.<br>  <br>  What I discovered, and this is where this site will help massively, is that you must isolate, and then manage the ROOT CAUSE of the anxiety. When you do that, and learn the techniques which will get rid of them for you, the sun suddenly starts to shine again.<br>  <br>  But you MUST learn what is the ROOT CAUSE, and then adopt those techniques into your lifestyle.<br>  <br>  This is no quick 5 minute fix, doesn't exist in this world - but - I am now convinced, without any doubt WHATSOEVER, that anyone who applies themselves, with the right help and assistance, to getting rid of their ailment, will succeed.<br>  <br>  I wish you all the best my friend - I hope you find your solution - best of luck.|`|fZw6ImUGaa	Professional help.

It totally transformed my life. No more panic attacks, absolutely amazing! You just can’t imagine what this has done for my life. The changes in me are nothing short of miraculous.<br>  You too could benefit from these audio programs. It is a learning system to condition the conscious and unconscious mental patterns that will allow you to rise above your current limitations and to embrace and achieve your goals. It starts with a brief relaxation session at the beginning of each programs, to produce the optimal state of mind for learning and retention with 55-60 beat per minute music to further reduce stress while lowering brain waves into the alpha and theta levels followed by special pace and repetition of re-scripting statements. <br>  What they do for you is significantly alter your automatic mental processes, which start working in days and produces lasting, growing results that continue to improve every aspect of your life as the weeks and months go by. <br>  It will work wonders for you, too. No more depression, no more paralyzing panic attacks. No more runaway fears. No more obsessing over matters large and small.<br>  <br>  Hope this works for u.<br>  Best wishes.|`|toNoWj3Kaa	Well, medication has undoubtedly helped.

I said "Yes...you couldn't do it..and this IS the answer...." a few test later on...we came to an agreement...I had been right.

I was NOT getting enough oxygen in my sleep making things far harder to tend to....I did therapy...yes it helped, but didn't abate the anxiety..at one point i did not leave my home unassisted for over two years without a valium.....this is both emotional and physical.....do not let anyone tell you differently....taking whatever steps you can to feel 'safe' is your best bet....this malady 20 years later on has served me well....I recommend reading a book called "The Gift of Fear" by Gaving de Becker ~ it expailns why we experience these things and sometimes for more reasons than I could possibly state here...I am an agoraphobic...spent two years inside with no company save my toddlers...often not getting from room to room without a valium at the time..I have now driven cross country 5 times.....the impulses still hit me..but are far more highly manageable. I am freed from it at intervals...this is an ongoing life thing..NOTHING will take it all away..in a sense it is a gift.....think about what I have said and if you can pick up the book you will know exactly what it is I am talking about.<br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  <br>  garbo|`|uGFzzLYWaa	Some of my own anxiety was stress related, and once the source of the stress was removed, the anxiety left with him.<br>  Some of it is chemical imbalance, and I have been off and on anti-depressants for years.

Commitment is a responsibility and it includes accountability. <br>  <br>  Our weaknesses result in disappointment. To overcome disappointment, boost your strengths. The greatest strength comes from the energy of commitment that brings excellence in all walks of life. Few people traverse the road of success without a puncture or two, but it is commitment to excellence that takes them through. <br>  <br>  To be committed is not being ‘stuck’; it is an integration of one’s being. If you are committed to honour your word, the base self in you will discourage you. If your energies are low, you will succumb. If you follow the higher self, the lower self will serve you, slowly getting integrated with the higher. In such a state there will be integrity. Without integrity life is shallow. <br>  <br>  You are both actor and thinker. Every time you lie, the thinker warns you that you are lying and the actor asks you to shut up and continue telling lies. It is like riding a chariot with two horses going in two different directions. With commitment, however, you are a person of integrity, and excellence is attainable. <br>  <br>  Can we test before we trust? >> <br>  <br>  Like an eagle, can we test before we trust? <br>  <br>  Eagles lay eggs on a cliff or high peak in nest of grass and thorns. When the eggs hatch, the weight of the eaglets exerts pressure and the thorns start pricking the newborns. Then the female pushes the eaglets out of the nest. As the eaglets nearly fall, the male picks them and places them back in the nest. <br>  <br>  Meanwhile, the female removes the upper layer of grass, so that the eaglets rest directly on the thorns that prick them. The eaglets are yet to test their wings. Now the male pushes the eaglets out of the nest. This process continues till such time that the eaglets are able to foresee the danger in falling and start using their wings. Slowly they realise their ability to use their wings and start flying. <br>  <br>  Observe the commitment of an eagle reflected in the way it executes family responsibilities and the way it conducts itself while parenting. Bring similar commitment to all walks of life; be it in the family, at work, in society or in your spiritual life. Excellence happens when there is love that helps you to grow and contribute. <br>  <br>  Commitment also involves dropping illusions. We do not see the world as it is; we see it projected through our verbose minds. Our minds are filled with thoughts and words. Words represent experiences. Words are also influenced by memory. From the past, we see the present. Hence we create illusions created by words, but we must filter them wisely. <br>  <br>  The mind creates dreams. The aware self in you sees reality. Awareness without the ‘I’ is the higher self. The mind with its illusions is the lower self. Have the commitment to operate from the higher self. <br>  <br>  Through commitment, balance all walks of your life... family, work, social and spiritual. Creativity is to balance all walks of life. Creativity is just not creating something new always. Creativity brings excellence in one’s life. It is a state of well-being. Well-being creates completion. When one is complete, one is alive and vibrant in all walks of life. <br>  <br>  <br>  Swami Sukhabodhananda<br>  RSS Feeds| SMS ASTRO to 8888 for latest updates <br>  <br>  <br>  One youngster comes to me very depressed and asks this question "Why is God creating so many difficulties for us? How to handle stress?" I tell this youngster to reflect on this beautiful story: <br>  <br>  A man goes to a shop, picks up a beautiful cup and says "my god this cup is so beautiful" and suddenly the cup starts talking to the man. The cup starts saying "O man, I am beautiful right now, but what was the state of my being before the pot-maker made me a beautiful pot? <br>  <br>  Before I was sheer mud and the pot-maker pulled me out of the mud from the mother earth and I felt why that pot-maker is so cruel, he has separated me from mother earth. I felt a tremendous pain. And the pot-maker said, "Just wait." Then he put me and churned me, when I was churned I felt so giddy, so painful, so stressful, I asked the pot-maker "Why are you so cruel?" the pot-maker said, "Just wait." Then he put me into a oven and heated me up, I felt completely burnt. There was tremendous pain and I asked the pot-maker "Why are you so cruel?" and the pot-maker said, "Just wait." <br>  <br>  Then he poured hot paint on me and I felt the fume and the pain, I again asked the pot-maker "Why are you so cruel?" and the pot-maker said, "Just wait." Then again he put me into an oven and heated it to make me more strong, I felt life is so painful hence pleaded the pot-maker and the pot-maker said, "Just wait." And after that the pot-maker took me to the mirror and said, "Now look at yourself". And surprisingly I found myself so beautiful. <br>  <br>  When god gives us lot of trouble, it appears god is very cruel but we need patience and we have to wait. When bad things happen to good people, they become better and not bitter. <br>  <br>  So all difficulties are part of a cosmic design to make us really beautiful. We need patience, we need understanding, we need the commitment to go through in a very calm and wise way. So all difficulties are not to tumble us but to humble us. <br>  <br>  With this understanding, let us not be against difficulty. Understand difficulty is a part of a purifying process. A purifying process at present which we cannot understand and hence we need faith and we need trust. <br>  <br>  Let us understand how to handle stress with this background. You can be affected by stress from two angles. There is an internal stress and there is an external stress. Nobody can avoid stress; one has to only manage stress. Managing stress can be internal and also external. <br>  <br>  The internal stress is; your thoughts can create stress, your values can create stress, and your beliefs can create stress, meaning thereby your stress is coming from your mind more from the outer world. Many people suffer not from heart attack - they suffer from thought-attack. <br>  <br>  For example, when somebody says you are an idiot, we get so hurt, we get so victimised. My boss has called me an idiot and I am feeling tremendous pain. Now where does this stress come from? If my boss has called me an idiot, I have to ask myself "am I an idiot"? <br>  <br>  If I am an idiot nothing to be upset about; and if I am not an idiot, then also nothing to be upset about! It is the perception of the boss. But why do we suffer from that stress? I suffer not because my boss has called me an idiot but because of the thought-attack. <br>  <br>  I may say the boss has called me an idiot; therefore I am suffering? It is true that the words are unpleasant. But what hurts is the interpretation of the unpleasant word. The thought in me interprets. That is pain and therefore it becomes pain. Much of our stress is our mind interpreting it as pain. So we suffer from thought-attack more than heart attack.|`|AA11631840	If your question is, do you care?

794e22345266ec43e77f82d68b585b1baa	To satifsy yourself that you are doing the exercise in proper form, if you have the money it might make sense to seek the services of a personal trainer.  They can watch you exercise and give you some pointers on how to do it.  <br>  When doing a crunch - concentrate on crunching the breast bone towards the pubic bone.  Breath out as you come up.  A personal trainer told me that my muscle should like that as in a cough - like pushing out below the ribs.  Meanwhile flatten the abdominal area in its entirety.  A pilates video told me to press my belly button in towards the back bone - my personal trainer particulary agree with the belly button form, but what is important is to press yourself in so that the back muscles take the responsiblity for keeping yoursel in form..  The lower back is to remain stationary as you do this crunch so as to avoid back pain.  Its not the distance you go but the pressure and pushing of the muscles that are important.   Even when you are walking you can think of that flattening the entire abdominal area and breathing should go in and out just below the rib cage so it isn't the lungs taht go in and out and it isn't the stomach that goes in and out... Well good luck..something tells me you are motivated..|`|AA10210669	You could try lifting your legs and leaving your head and shoulders stationary.|`|3178836f5c6a50060f7effecd27abdf3aa	The reason you are most likely having pain when you do abdominal exercise is poor mechanics.

AA11146632	It depends on why you are wanting colon cleansing.  If it is for a colonoscopy, then you will be given some powder called "Clean Prep", or maybe one with another name, but believe you me it works extremely well.  You have to drink 4 litres of water with the 4 sachets over time, and you will soon be on the loo as fast as you drink it.  It will completely empty your bowel of everything.  You must drink plenty of clear water afterwards though, or you will become dehydrated, and that can be dangerous.|`|MF9YknDYaa	It's total nonsense.
Z8d9ipxmaa	I'm not an expert, but i know a few things that might help: <br>  <br>  You should seek medical assistance ASAP, i'd call your local hospital to ask about dental services. Until you're seen to, be gentle with your mouth. Keep it clean by gargling salt water (can make it sting, but keeps the area hygienic). Don't use mouthwash, as in this case it may be too acidic, which irritates your gum while it's sensitive. Brush your teeth softly but thoroughly, avoid sugary, crunchy & chewy foods and drink plenty of water/fluids. It sounds odd, but avoid strenuous physical activity - it can make your gum bleed. <br>  <br>  This dentist isn't allowed to leave a patient with an infection and an unfinished procedure on their tooth. That's malpractice and you can claim compensation.|`|6cbc0c83b0a9f3358f5ec03119b6f535aa	Go to a different dentist.  Ring NHS Direct 0845 4647 (yes, only 8 digits) or go to the website www.nhs.uk and search for a dentist in your area.  If you are in pain, then ring your hospital and find out if they have emergency dental treatment (A&E will NOT be able to help).<br>  <br>  Your GP will probably give you a prescription for antibiotics and painkillers.  Meanwhile report the dental practice to your primary care trust.  Leaving (part of) their instruments in your mouth is negligent, more so not telling you.<br>  <br>  If you're that way inclined, maybe even contact one of the ambulance chasers that advertise constantly ("Had an accident in the last 3 years that wasn't your fault?").  Alternatively, seek advice from a reputable solicitor: without question, she is guilty of malpractice.|`|bSD9wJmhaa	this isn't the  best solution but it may help.  To try to ease the pain, sip -room temperature- water and swish it gently arround the tooth that hurts. Doesn't work all the time but it did  sortof ease the pain for me.  One thing to note is that you should probabally not swallow the water. If the tooth is infceted  you run the risk of  rinsing infection  down if you swallow.  much bettter to spit it out. kinda gross, not polite, but better than pain & getting sick.|`|AG7RcqzPaa	You can sue this dentist, and no don't go back to this dentist she just might cause more problems.<br>  <br>  You should consult the dentist association of your country, and speak to them on how you can claim for the pain sufferring this dentist caused to you.<br>  <br>  Instead of being angry, about it use your rights as a customer and get some compensation you never know you might get some money.<br>  <br>  Ow I had my 4 wisdom teeth removed and man I tell you I know how that hurts.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Rob
AA10210669	Many times, cold sores can be prompted to surface if you are very stressed out.  Unfortunately, that often makes you more stressed out, and more cold sores!  It's a vicious cycle.  Try taking an ibuprofen once a day for the 3 days before you expect your period to begin.  I read that just that medicine alone can help eliminate some of the symptoms of PMS, and perhaps being in less pain, less bloated, will help you be less stressed, and you can avoid the cold sores next time.  <br>  <br>  Remember not to touch them except to put cold sore medicine on them.  And when you put the medicine on them, wash your hands very well right after so you don't spread them to yourself or to other people.|`|9e2a2d4a3c90f5a5a4934c64f1e04ac5aa	herpes simplex.....recurrent cold sores are usually caused by this|`|65b20152005bdf83ad3ad87aca6d5b9aaa	It could just be related to your menstrual cycle.

af920d689dbc1e4add08c85adcf78e32aa	Crohn's disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes the small intestine to be inflammed.  The body for some reason overreacts to everything in the bowel and attacks it, causing injury and inflammation to it.  Since the intestine becomes injured, it isn't able to absorb all the nutrients the body needs from the food being digested.  This leads to malnutrition, which is why your friend became so small.  It also can cause diarrhea or bowel obstruction. The treatment includes drugs, nutrition supplements, and sometimes surgery. The goalis to control inflammation, prevent malnutrition, and to relieve symptoms like abdominal pain and diarrhea. Unfortunately, there is no cure.  Treatment can only help control the disease.  Your friend could have died from a number of things, including malnutrition or electrolyte imbalances related to the decreased ability of the intestine to absorb and digest food.  Fatigue and slurring words (altered levels of consciousness) are highly associated with electrolytes being out of whack.

I think that goes along with the disease itself - although many of the medications can make that worse.  <br>  <br>  Crohn's Disease isn't normally fatal but some of effects of the disease can cause major problems to where you loose to much weight, suffer with arthritis, have kidney stones, anemia, skin sores, eye troubles, etc.  You don't want to eat when it is active and sometimes the medications itself make you have constant nausea.  <br>  <br>  In all honesty, things were so bad before my surgery to remove 3 ft of infected intestine that I was about to give up the will to live.  The battle can be hard.  Some people with CD lead rather normal lives but some are in constant pain and have to take numerous medications forever.  <br>  <br>  I'm very sorry for your loss.  I you want to learn more about Crohn's and how it affects others, go to www.healingwell.com to the community area.  The group for people with Crohn's Disease is probably the largest on the site and the people are wonderful.  It was great for me to be able to talk to others to find out what was normal, what wasn't , etc.  I was a mess until I was able to talk to others who could understand.<br>  <br>  Here's a list of a few of the medications that are popular with CD patients.  You can look them up on www.rxlist.com.  <br>  <br>  Prednisone<br>  Sulfasalazine<br>  Mesalamine<br>  Azathioprine<br>  6-MP<br>  Methotrexate<br>  Cyclosporine<br>  Ciprofloxacin (antibiotic)<br>  Metronidazole (antibiotic)<br>  Remicade<br>  Humira<br>  <br>  Again, I am sorry for your loss.  I hope this little bit of information helps.|`|c79ea1ea26fd955ddcce482293164c6baa	What is Crohn's disease?<br>  <br>  Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation or ulceration of the digestive tract. It can affect any part of your digestive tract, but it is most common in the last part of the small intestine (ileum) and the large intestine (colon).<br>  <br>  Crohn's disease affects the deepest layers of the lining of the digestive tract, causing deep sores called ulcers.<br>  <br>  Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (which affects the colon and rectum) are the most common types of inflammatory bowel disease, with ulcerative colitis being more common. <br>  <br>  What causes Crohn's disease?<br>  <br>  The cause of Crohn's disease is not known. It sometimes runs in families, suggesting a genetic link. The immune system may overreact to normal intestinal bacteria and cause inflammation. Disease-causing bacteria and viruses also may play a role in triggering the condition, and smoking increases the risk of Crohn's disease.<br>  <br>  Increasingly, researchers think environmental factors play a role in causing Crohn's disease. <br>  <br>  What are the symptoms?<br>  <br>  The main symptoms of Crohn's disease are abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and diarrhea. Constipation, fever, and loss of appetite may also occur.<br>  <br>  Crohn's disease also may cause:<br>  <br>  Sores in the mouth. <br>  Nutritional deficiencies, such as lowered levels of vitamin B12, folic acid, iron, and fat-soluble vitamins, because the intestines may not be able to absorb nutrients from food. <br>  Bowel obstruction. <br>  Anal tears (fissures) or openings (fistulas), abscesses, or skin tags that may resemble hemorrhoids. <br>  Joint aches and fatigue. <br>  Sometimes complications develop elsewhere in the body (systemic), including the eyes, liver, blood, and bones. These systemic symptoms suggest immune system involvement.<br>  <br>  How is Crohn's disease diagnosed?<br>  <br>  Crohn's disease is diagnosed through a medical history and physical exam, imaging tests to look at the intestines, and laboratory tests.<br>  <br>  Crohn's disease can be difficult to diagnose. Early symptoms, or its only symptoms, may consist of joint aches and a general feeling of fatigue. The condition may go undiagnosed for years because symptoms usually develop gradually.<br>  <br>  Tests that may be done to diagnose Crohn's disease include:<br>  <br>  Barium X-rays of the small intestine or colon, in which a white liquid is used to coat the inside of the intestine so that it can be seen more clearly on an X-ray. <br>  Colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy, in which a lighted viewing instrument is used to examine the inside of the colon. <br>  Biopsy, in which tissue is taken from the affected area and tested to distinguish between Crohn's disease and other conditions such as cancer. <br>  Stool analysis to look for blood and signs of infection. <br>  How is it treated?<br>  <br>  Crohn's disease can usually be controlled with medications that reduce inflammation and cure infection, keeping the disease from producing symptoms (known as being in remission). However, while it can be managed, Crohn's disease cannot be cured.<br>  <br>  Mild symptoms of Crohn's disease may be treated with antidiarrheal medications. Talk with your health professional before taking them, though, because they may cause side effects. Prescription medications also may be used to treat mild symptoms and keep Crohn's disease in remission.<br>  <br>  More severe symptoms may require treatment with one or more prescription medications. You may also need to follow a special diet if you are not able to absorb nutrients properly.<br>  <br>  If your symptoms are severe or do not get better with initial medications, you may need more aggressive treatment with intravenous (IV) medications and possibly surgery. Surgery is usually done only when severe symptoms don't respond to medication or when complications develop, such as bleeding or developing a blockage (obstruction) in the intestine. Crohn's disease tends to come back after surgery.<br>  <br>  How will Crohn's disease affect my life?<br>  <br>  Crohn's disease is a chronic condition that may flare up throughout your life. You may have only mild symptoms or long periods without symptoms. A few people have persistent, severe symptoms.<br>  <br>  People who have only mild symptoms that respond to home treatment cope well with the disease. But for some others, Crohn's disease can be a frustrating condition. The persistent diarrhea that often occurs may make you feel as if your life revolves around the bathroom. You may feel isolated, be embarrassed by the symptoms, and have a poor body image. These feelings may keep you from participating in work, social, and sexual activities.<br>  <br>  However, most people with the condition live high-quality, productive lives using medications to control inflammation and treat symptoms.<br>  <br>  Crohn's disease can cause stress, which in turn may affect the course of the disease. Help is available if you are struggling with the condition. Seek support from family, friends, clergy, or a professional counselor. A strong social network may reduce stress and make the disease less active.

Not least because of its recurring tendency. However, men don’t get away lightly either, as they are also susceptible to the condition, but less commonly. This is because everyone has small amounts of Candida albicans, the yeast that causes thrush, present in their body. For women the symptoms may include irritation and, more noticeably, a cottage cheese discharge coming from their vagina. Likewise, men may experience inflammation and a similarly unpleasant discharge coming from their penis. Thrush can often go away without treatment, but there are many over-the-counter remedies on hand to help. However, in first time cases or if you’re suffering from a persistent yeast infection, it may be worth consulting your GP for advice.|`|4ZE8RG7Waa	classic lmao!..|`|2b4c74857bc845e8711fbc100addc4cbaa	It's a yeast infection...

IKakoOfyaa	2 & 1/2 scored tablets tid.<br>  <br>  8 ml po q8h<br>  <br>  ***************************<br>  Simple math to figure it out.<br>  <br>  For the first one, you have 2 mg. tablets that are scored.  That means each half tablet has 1 mg. of medication.<br>  <br>  2 x 2 mg = 4 mg plus 1/2 tab or 1mg. = 5mg.<br>  <br>  For the second one, you simply have to figure out how much medication is in 1 ml.<br>  125 divided by 5 = 25 mg per ml.<br>  200 mg (ordered dose) divided by 25 = 8 or 8 ml.

In the end it'll get so silly, people borrowing money and not returning it, that sort of thing, that you'll just be a doormat.

Your comment about hating yourself does not sit well.  You must like the person you have become and try and influence others to see who you are through your eyes.  As for changing your attitude, try and look at things through other people's eyes.  Maybe you are more mature than those around you and your quiet, nice side is a demonstration of that maturity.  As for people walking all over you, don't let it happen.  It is easier than you think.  If you say something, and your parents have not said otherwise, then stick to it...but remember if you are wrong and know you are wrong then have the guts to admit it and move on.  The truth...that is the easiest of the problems you mentioned.  Remember this, it is very easy to tell the truth and take the consequences of your actions then to make up stories and try and remember them all.  If you lie once, you must continue to lie...eventually you will get caught and integrity is one of those values that is hard to get back.|`|u2fJ1n5Zaa	practice

After a stroke (I know as my dad had two), the walker just gives them a bit of confidence, while they get the brain to communicate with the leg movement.  It takes a while, as a stroke does cause some brain damage. My dad  got over his first stroke very well and it took a bit of time for his co-ordination to return, but it did. It may hinder the patient if you take it away.  Its scary for them if they are insecure. Good luck

And what do you suppose happens to muscles when you tone them...?  Usually they get bigger!<br>  <br>  Anyway...<br>  <br>  Your goal is a little too ambitious - unless you're carrying a lot of water weight and/or you're very overweight, you can't reasonably expect to lose more than a pound or two a week safely, even with curbing caloric intake and exercise.  You should really consider a longer-term strategy, as your metabolism only slows down as you age (so if you're having trouble with managing your weight now, it isn't going to get any easier!).<br>  <br>  Try making some common-sense changes that you can sustain over the long haul.  Eat less stuff that's bad for you; eat more fruits and vegetables; learn what a serving of anything really looks like (you'd be surprised how much - or rather, how little! - a serving of pasta is); drink more water (as a guide, try about 1 tablespoon daily for every pound of weight - so a 120 lb. person would drink 60 ounces per day); increase the amount of exercise you get (swimming is fantastic - low-impact, and tones/slims basically everything from the neck down - but walking will do!); get a proper amount of sleep every night.  How long it will take to lose the 20 pounds depends on how far off this track you are now, but it will come off eventually.  The good news is that if you incorporate these small changes, you'll be able to keep it off!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11207866	Before your 21st birthday--learn to love yourself the way you are. You have a boyfriend so I'm sure he thinks you look great the way you are. 20 lbs is too much to lose in 42 days. you would just put it back on anyway. Have fun and party hard! happy birthday.

0227f887dae165d6a58cad79b4ec14deaa	I never had that problem but I am happy to help you with home remedies.  Below read different home remedies you can try.  Also, I am providing a link you can save for other remedies you may need help with in the near future.  Others who are reading can use this link as well... it is really great and resourceful.<br>  <br>  Take care and Happy Holidays to you and yours<br>  <br>  Some Effective home Remedies are: <br>  Ingredients: Apple cider vinegar (bragg's is best)<br>  Instructions: drinking 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar 3 times a day. Apply vinegar to affected area at night, until acne disappears. Expect results in 1-3 weeks. <br>  Ingredients: Salt, Steaming water, Cold water, cloth, towel<br>  Instructions: Put steaming water in a bowl. Drape a towel over your face and let the steam into your face, (This opens your pores). Next, mix some salt in a warm water bowl and use it to clean your face, (like you would with ordinary cleaner). Salt has been<br>  proven to be the best disinfectant for skin. Then wash face with cold water to seal up your pores again. Repeat 1-2 times a day. The best part is, these ingredients are all found around the home <br>  Ingredients: Apple cider vinegar/lemon juice <br>  Instructions: Clean your skin and apply either lemon juice or apple cider vinegar with a cotton ball. The acid in these kitchen remedies helps flush out the pores and keeps the skin looking beautiful. Vinegar acts as an astringent and helps remove excess oil, kills bacteria, and normalizes the skin's pH. This remedy should work quickly. <br>  Ingredients: Honey, Cinnamon<br>  Instructions: Mix one teaspoon of cinnamon into 3 tablespoons of honey. Use as a facial scrub, works great as an exfoliant, and you can leave on overnight or wash it off after half an hour, either works fine. <br>  Ingredients: Showering 2-3 times a day in running hot water (not too hot so you burn yourself but fairly hot), salt<br>  Instructions: Take a hot shower 3 times a day and let the RUNNING WATER RUN ON YOUR FACE all over your face for about 3-5 MINUTES <br>  until face tightens up. You will see that it naturally gets rid of the oil and will clear up your acne in about a week. For the guys, if you shave, please use an electric shaver and shave before you shower. Regular razor blades will irritate skin with acne and cause more unwanted oil. Also wash your hair just once a day with a non conditioning shampoo (this will stop the oils from your head from reaching the rest of you face). Do not use soap or anything else on your face while doing this and never WASH or TOUCH your face with your hands. This just adds more unwanted oils from your hands. Just wash hair and rinse face that's it! If u find that u r still getting oil build up ( such as when u wake up in thee morning) in certain areas such as the nose or forehead, sprinkle a little bit of SALT on these areas while they r still wet and leave on and let dry for about 1/2 an hour and then rinse it off with running hot water in the shower as I said before. just try this method it works for me <br>  Ingredients: Lemon Juice, Hydrogen Peroxide, Aspirin Aloe Vera, Echinacea & Goldenseal dried herbs or tea<br>  Instructions: Mix in a bowl or container the Lemon Juice, Hydrogen Peroxide, a few Aspirin and the Echinacea w/ Goldenseal you can also use the tea and pour the herbs in the bowl. Mix it together and use this solution as a astringent apply w/ cotton balls or tissue and leave it on your face to dry. Once it dries put Aloe Vera on your skin. Do this after every time you wash your face it really works <br>  Ingredients: Flax Seed<br>  Instructions: take about 5 tablespoons per day of "cold milled" flax seed...great for the skin...also good for lowering cholesterol <br>  Ingredients: Potato<br>  Instructions: Cut the potato in half. (no need to wash it) Rub the insides of it all over your face and keep it on overnight. The potato dries your skin out and you'll see immediate results. You can save the potato for the next night by wrapping it up with cling wrap and a rubber band. It's really easy and it really works, I swear! <br>  Ingredients: Warm water, regular salt<br>  Instructions: This is really easy and clears up your face really fast! My cousin had really bad acne and he tried everything he even went to a dermatologist, but nothing worked that the dermatologist gave him. He tried every kind of acne medication out there but it all seemed to irritate his face and make it worse. Till I helped him out. All u have to do is every morning and night pour a little salt into the palm of your hands and rub it together in your hands adding some warm water to it massage into your face adding warm water with your hands after about 1min of doing that rinse face and pat lightly to dry with a clean towel. It works between a week or two. But u got to try it, it my cause dryness but it defiantly clears it up. Well I hope it helps it helped my cousin and he had it bad. So Good luck and best whishes! <br>  Ingredients: Cream of Tarter<br>  Instructions: I'm 44 years old and usually had pretty good skin most of my life. For some reason the past year my face has really be breaking out. I headed to the store and bought facial scrubs, tried the toothpaste, Neutrogena, but nothing worked I constantly had new pimple eruptions daily. My face was getting scars and I didn't like the way I looked. I figured it must be some kind of imbalance in my body since this was a new problem for me. My sister told me that a Naturalpathic doctor said to take 1 teaspoon of cream of tarter with juice daily and it would clear up the pimples. What you do is mix about 1 teaspoon cream of tarter (the stuff you use for cooking it is a white powder you can find at any grocery store) mix it with juice and drink it. It acts as an antioxidant. It cleans out you system of toxin and as a result this helps to clear the pimples. I figured I tried all the other stuff that you put on your face what would it hurt to try this, and it definitely! was cheaper than all the other stuff I was buying. I noticed an improvement within 3 days. after about 1 week the pimples were gone and no new ones were erupting. I then quit taking the cream of tarter and back the pimples came. So again I started on it and again the pimples are now cleared up. I now just take cream of tarter in juice daily. I figure if it is helping get rid of the pimples it is getting rid of harmful toxins in my body that I don't need. Try it! It fights the breakouts from the inside and it is a completely safe home remedy for acne. <br>  Rub the pimple(acne) with a fresh cut clove of garlic. <br>  To rid blackheads, mix cornstarch with vinegar, plaster on the area for 15-30 minutes; wash off with washcloth and warm water. <br>  First take tea tree oil apply to acne with q-tip (cotton Swab) and let <br>  dry. This will heal the acne and it smells good too. Or wash your face with a mild soap rinse then splash Listerine on your face it will tingle and the antibacterial in the Listerine will kill the bacteria that causes acne. I learned this when I used to model. <br>  Drinking plenty of water is a great home remedy for acne. In fact water pretty much clears anything, keep that in mind next time you need to take a drug test. Putting sliced potato's on your face helps clear acne. Eating potatoes also helps clear acne as well as other things such as cuts and bruises. (Although eating plenty of potatoes from Mc Donalds isn't going to get your acne cleared very fast if at all.) Stay away from greasy food, not only will this help your diet but it will help your face as well. When done correctly, dieting to lose weight helps clear up acne and those extra pound. It's winning situation. One of the easiest ways to clear acne is to wash your hair. Many people shower in the morning and sleep with a head of greasy hair. This grease ends up on your pillow and when you turn it ends up on your face. If washing your hair at night is a problem than maybe washing your pillows once a week will do the trick.  <br>  <br>  See also: Home remedy for pimples|`|548739ce445215f648147b6d0e459f70aa	ACCUTANE!!<br>  <br>  See your dermatologist if over the counter products fail.<br>  Had to go thru other prescription meds before we found one that worked.

AA12081817	I lost 105 pounds in 6 months.  Here is how I did it.<br>  1. Every morning get up and walk for 45 minutes.  You can start with less time, but you want to get up to 45 minutes, and it must be fast walk. You want your heart rate to go up.  It must be in the morning, it kick starts your metabolism.<br>  2. I cut out Red Meat, and fatty foods.  Boneless skinnless chicken breast, baked, or grilled, rice and vegetables (steamed).<br>  3. Eat half.  Just eat half of what you normally eat.  Put 1/2 on your plate, and put the rest away.  Cook less.  When you go to fast food, get salads only.  Or grilled chicken.  No fries,  only diet soda. Or water.<br>  <br>  It will work, once you get into a routine, you will get hooked on the results, and you will keep the routine.

We get toxins in our bodies from pesticides, preservatives, water, pollution, medications, food additives etc…. These toxins enter our bodies and get stored in our fat cells. To shrink the fat, we need to get rid of the toxins through cleansing.  The program also has a natural diet pill to help your metabolism and curb cravings.  It works and it works fast.  My skin has improved from the cleansing.  You can get more info at this toll free number 1-877-587-4647. It is pricey but worth it!  I think cleansing is really important to health and weight loss.  Give it a try and good luck! <a href="http://diet4cleansing.com" rel="nofollow">http://diet4cleansing.com</a>|`|44404a8caf9f80ed42be7fa7e16cc229aa	Man if you ever find an answer to this then please please share with me.|`|8cec2f14cab94def90027ae41aa3a8e0aa	I have no idea and I really want to find it out that was a great question!!!|`|AA11662697	There are a couple ways:<br>  1. there are a lot of pills out there that are completely harmless and give u great results.<br>  2. Try watching the shopping channel for a couple minutes.. they have so many machines and belts that u just hook on to the desired area and they burn the fat off for you.<br>  3. u can try a diet that doesnt call for excersize, but most of the time those diets are pretty difficult to stick to or they're just dangerous.. but hey.. maybe you'll be lucky and find one that is perfect for you!<br>  4. see a dietian! im sure she will be glad to help u out.<br>  Good Luck!
AA11662697	Yes. Studies show that most ppl (usually teenagers) are affected by the food they eat. Dark vegetables and a lot of water help clarify skin. On the other hand, some vitamins help moisturize skin and keep it soft such as vitamin E which is found in avocodo, peanuts and more. I suggest u see a dietian or a dermitologist to learn more about the subject.<br>  G'luck!|`|298574ebd480e066c2b6e29e1c578b4aaa	Yes
bebefaf34a6c0ac4b567ff1ca1e95f37aa	I have heard apple cider vinegar on a cotton ball held to the area for a short time, but I don't know if it works.<br>  The best thing I have ever used for cold sores is Lactinex pills. Ask your pharmacist. They are not prescription, but have to be refrigerated so they are not out on the counter. They somehow replace healthy microbes in the body that suppress the herpes virus. Start taking them at the first tingle, and sometimes it won't even go ahead to develop into a cold sore. Stop taking them when the cold sore or the feeling of a cold sore is gone.<br>  The second best thing is Acidophilus pills. I believe it works the same way as the Lactinex but it takes longer. You will find it in the vitamin section. Again, ask your pharmacist how many you can safely take. Stop taking them once the threat of cold sore has passed.<br>  This must be the best kept secret ever because I tried everything else to no avail until my pharmacist told me about the Lactinex. <br>  I tried Lysine, but it did nothing to help me. Maybe it has to be taken consistently instead of just during an outbreak. <br>  I hope this works as well for you as it has for me. I have often wondered if it would work for genital herpes as well, but I just don't know.|`|7645b7d4c3fd3657fa98285a699edb86aa	Campho-Phenique works good to get rid of cold-sores or Resinol.  you can get both at local pharmacy.

But I still have Clindamycin keep in my bathroom, because "pimple" possible to happen accidently! And you could buy it from dermatologist.<br>  <br>  However, please listen to me Miss Uhm_crazy :-)<br>  <br>  As I'm a kind of person who always taking care of myself. Yes, of course, it's because my job. So I always pick only best thing. And don't buy skin care products from the ads.<br>  <br>  Stop eating/drinking dairy products, fried foods or even chocolate, do not cause pimple! If you notice that your skin flares-up after eating certain foods, however, use common sense and avoid that food as much as possible. Stress and lack of sleep and changes in the environment have all been linked to pimple.<br>  <br>  The best way  for me to avoid pimple is going to consult with dermartologist at Skincare Center. There're many kinds of treatment both "cheap" and "expensive" It depends on your problems and how much you can afford it. Don't be hesitate to ask :-)<br>  <br>  And these are simple rules to avoid pimple.<br>  <br>  - Avoid excessive sun exposure, sun bathing will increase plugging of the pores and comedones.<br>  <br>  -Avoid supplements with iodine in amounts greater than the RDI of 120-150 mcg.<br>  <br>  -Avoid overwashing your face and blemish-prone areas. Washing twice daily is enough but don't use any kind of soap and antibacteria soap.<br>  <br>  -Avoid squeezing or picking blemishes.<br>  <br>  -Avoid touching your face and check to make sure all cosmetics are oil-free and non-comedogenic. Don't forget to wash your hands frequently.<br>  <br>  -Avoid stress. And eat a balanced diet, get at least 7-8hrs of sleep, drink plenty of water, vegetable, fruits and fresh juice.<br>  <br>  -Always wear loose-fitting cotton clothes, and never wear makeup, even oil-free or non-comedogenic when exercising. And shower in 30 minutes after exercising.<br>  <br>  Hopefully these things could help you a bit.

In spiaggia si fa il bagno e meno roba addosso si ha meglio è....no ?  Poi è stata anche una cosa voluta, quella di poter esibire il proprio corpo.... voluta dal progresso e dal senso comune del pudore che è cambiato assai.... poi ragiona, dal ginecologo cosa fanno le donne ??  Potrebbero fare la stessa cosa per strada ??  Ogni cosa ha il suo contesto e questa cosa della spiaggia è uno di questi....|`|cnpLrhoCaa	perchè cambiando il contesto uno stesso elemento assume differente significato.|`|zAB0Trnhaa	sono daccordo con te...<br>  che differenza fa mettersi in costume o in intimo ad esempio???<br>  non capisco!|`|xMrX5O05aa	Se per "seminude" intendi in costume, credo che sia perchè tutti al mare sono quasi nudi e quindi nessuno si pone il problema (sebbene qualcuno se lo faccia lo stesso, magari qualche persona malata di obesita o altri...). Se per "seminude" intendi in topless, ciò varia da persona a persona. D'estate ci sono anche quelle che girano con abitini trasparenti, con il seno a vista. E' una questione di pudore: c'è chi si vergogna a conciarsi così, e chi si vergogna a parlarci assieme (E poi ci sono anche quei maschietti che invece sono ben felici che qualcuna si amneo pudica...)|`|WhLbfk9Naa	Conta il contesto, quello che ti aspetti. Se vai in un sito naturista tutti sono nudi ma non ci fai caso perché te lo aspetti. Al mare si fa il bagno e sai che le persone saranno in costume, quindi non ci fai caso. Per contro in città per tutto l'anno si è vestiti, per cui se una andasse in giro in costume, non te l'aspetteresti e stimolerebbe sessualmente. Se fai caso le persone verso fine estate sono comunque più discinte che ai primi caldi, perché man mano un po' ci si abitua ad essere così. Chisà come ci vestiremmo se il caldo durasse tutto l'anno come in Africa?

54f19908c72b1e43699f4be685beb95baa	Cardio is cardiovascular training abbreviated. And all workouts that gets you breathing and sweating involves cardio, including weight lifting if you keep going, going, going with minimal rest between sets and different lifts. But only sustained cardio, where you keep going  with your heartbeat relatively high for at least 20 min actually improves your endurance. Your middle to long distance endurance is determined by your lactic threshold (the maximum amount of lactic acids your blood is able to continuously transport out of your working muscles) and the best way to improve it is to run a relatively short distance at a pace that gets you "gasping" for air. Most of your cardio work should be to keep building your cardiovascular base by doing cardio for relatively long periods of time at a pace well within your max performance. My favorite cardio work is; running, skipping rope and plyometric, vertical leaping. <br>  <br>  After every good workout you should immediately have a recovery drink/shake. A small bottle of fat free chocolate milk has an ideal amount and combination of carbs and protein. And alway make sure to stay hydrated. I typically drink 1 qt. of water before all my runs and 2 qts. of water and "recovery beverage" after I'm done.|`|c478f056cb88e6ce86dc4fca2726b493aa	Cardio is bringing your heart rate up to a faster pace.

bm3ZkZgyaa	Premesso che molto dipende dalla sensibilità dei tuoi occhi, oggi è molto difficile perdere le lenti in acqua o rischiare che ti diano fastidio. Io porto le lenti da quando avevo 13 anni: all'inizio andavo al mare con gli occhiali, ma poi in acqua non vedevo niente ^_^, quindi ho parlato col mio oculista, secondo il quale non c'erano problemi ad usare le lenti in acqua, a patto di fare attenzione a che non mi finisse dell'acqua sporca o della sabbia negli occhi. In realtà, anche aprire gli occhi sott'acqua non mi ha mai creato problemi, anche se per sicurezza cerco di non farlo. La morale è: non c'è nessun problema ad usare le lenti al mare!|`|103e416816cd86ac97b07de505887751aa	Io porto le semirigide gas permeabili da moltissimi anni e non ho mai avuto problemi ad andare sott'acqua, anzi inizialmente mi dimenticavo di averle e così aprivo pure gli occhi, come era mia abitudine fare quando non le portavo, cmq non è successo nè di perderle nè di avvertire bruciore agli occhi. L'unico fastidio che provo al mare è quando c'è il vento forte che solleva  la sabbia, mamma che bruciore, mi sembra di avere degli spilli negli occhi.Ora non so se quello che ti ho detto vale anche per le lentine morbide|`|f1JBW7q6aa	non hai nessun problema se le metti al mare,ma evita di andare sotto acqua con gli occhi aperti perchè le potresti perdere e stai attenta alla sabbia,se ti entra negli occhi ti viene un prurito pazzesco|`|izKdeuqoaa	miriam ha detto ke lei in piscina apriva anke gli okki!|`|4ZHwPtLnaa	ciao, io le uso da gennaio e non mi hanno mai dato fastidio, al mare ed in piscina le ho provate qualke volta e t assicuro ke nn c'è alcun problema, anzi:è una meraviglia xkè così riesci a vedere tutto !!! però tieni gli okki kiusi sotto acqua xkè rischi di perderle con gli occhi a contatto con l'acqua , se vuoi tenere gli oki aperti usa la mascherina o gli occhialini!ciao|`|6q5842zoaa	io le metto però devi fare attenzione alla polvere e al sale marino perchè potresti rischiare qualke infezione|`|Gq7mYp6baa	noooooooooooo al mare non metterle, figurati sott'acqua!<br>  non sono sarda, ma vado al mare in sardegna.... quindi ajo<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  io ho sempre saputo che non si può....giuro....fate chiarezza anche a me..... a meno che dipende dal tipo di lente......<br>  sono confusa....|`|N7iECVlCaa	innanzitutto vai con le usa e getta così se le perdi fa niente!<br>  io vado sott'acqua ma con gli occhialini. senza mi entra cmq un po' d'acqua e le lenti iniziano a spostarsi e va a finire che le perdo!|`|o8TGZ8szaa	Io sono sempre andata al mare con le lenti a contatto, anche in piscina, ma non apro gli occhi sott'acqua perchè c'è il rischio che le lenti si stacchino (mi è già capitato!) e non è una cosa simpatica...per cui se ti piace andare sott'acqua meglio utilizzare una maschera o degli occhialini...|`|s1oB32s9aa	Io le metto tranquillamente al mare, e non ho problemi di alcun tipo.

c478f056cb88e6ce86dc4fca2726b493aa	Try NO Xlode. You will be able to lift more while you work out. Its at GNC or wherever you have a health store.  Do pyramids. 10,8,6 reps and keep increasing the weight. Do pushups on your bench days and do them last until you can't go anymore.  Then on an off day when you feel good, like once or twice a week, do pushups  for a minute and see how many and try to increase everytime. GOOD LUCK.<br>  <br>  -DAVE|`|59542d833cfe91429988ae754eaa9186aa	I used to weight lift and I used to compete in it. The best way to build stamina is to practice.  Say you need to be able to bench 300 and you can only bench 250 and can do 5 reps of it then start at 250 do your 5 reps and then gradually add 5 lbs to it each week. When you hit 255 you might only be able to do 2 reps that week that is OK. The next week add 5 more lbs till you hit your goal. That one bench rep that you have to do for your test should look good not a strained rep. Push ups with added weight on your back can also help with bench press reps. Your muscles get used to lifting and exercising at a certain weight. Doing push ups as fast as you can should be done everyday. Say you can do 50 in a min then next day you should try to do 51 ect ect. If you add weight to your sit ups will slow you down but when you are ready for speed testing you should be able to do them faster because your body will think it is lighter without the added weight to it. You should do basically the same thing for legs presses as I stated for bench presses. Leg presses aren't all about your thigh muscles either make sure you work your calf muscles as well. Bike riding at fast pace helps build stamina. I hope this helps out a bit for you and GL with your test.|`|53a74743d23e11adcec737c47684f9f0aa	You say you want to increase max weight on one rep ... then two sentances later say you want to do as many reps (on the pushups and situps) as possible.<br>  <br>  Now these goals are sort of the same (get stronger!) but slightly different.  Generally speaking, fewer reps higher weight targets max lift, more reps at a lower weight targets endurance.<br>  <br>  An 'in between approach' might be to target a weight you can lift 8-12 times.  If you can do over 12 reps, up the weight.  I'd suggest that for your bench press.  Then rest, then do a set with less weight as required.  So you might take off 15-20 lbs for the second set, more for the third, and so on.  That way your first set you are working most on max strength, the later sets are to work on endurance.<br>  <br>  For the leg press, since you only need to do one rep, you might want to aim for more like 6-8 reps per set.  Again, if you can do more then the top end , up the weight.  Actually, looking this up, you may want to go even more weight/less reps, like 1-5 reps per set, and a few more sets.  See the chart a little way down the link I provided as source.<br>  <br>  On the situps, you need mainly endurance, so just do a lot of them.|`|AA10473274	Try using Endothil CR. It works just like a steroid, but its not a steroid. It's all natural and works fast. The taste is gross but my fiance said it's worth it. You can get it at any heath and suppliment store or you can get it cheaper on line. Take it a half an hour before on the days you workout, and first thing in the morning on the days you don't workout. And you'll be better off to do alot of reps with a lower weight and after a week try alittle more weight with the same amount of reps, and keep working your way up.

In their statement, they explained that the ONLY way to lose weight is to eat less calories and exercises more.<br>  <br>  Make a healthy meal plan that you can stick to, and then stick to it. Make a moderate exercises plan that you can stick to and then stick to it.<br>  <br>  That is they only method that works.<br>  <br>  What most people need is not "tricks" and "secrets" but rather moral support. Overeating is a disease of isolation. It is when we feel lonely, disconnected, incomplete, unloved... that is when we overeat. So I would recommend joining a group for emotional and spiritual support: church, synagogue, yoga class, Overeaters Anonymous, whatever. <br>  <br>  That will make the difference you are seeking.

RETMVti0aa	Not eating from morning to 2 p.m. is definitely not good for the body.  You need to eat before you need to use energy, which is usually earlier in the day for most people.  Eating earlier in the day as opposed to later (expecially big meals) is healthier because if you're eating just when you're not as busy, it kind of defeats the purpose of eating, which is for energy...  Eating more frequently, but in much smaller portions may help you here.  Just stay motivated to be and feel healthier.|`|37MJkh1Caa	Not having a appetite when you have the stomach flu is part of the stomach flu as long as you keep drinking and allowing your body to stay hydrated.

b6781531240773a8ec4cd25d803f149eaa	in che senso si è rovinato?! te lo ha detto il dentista o lo hai notato da sola? comunque no, non ricresce, e in effetti le zone dove lo smalto è piu sottile sono piu a rischio di carie... posso dirti per esempio che una delle maggiori cause di abrasione dello smalto è uno spazzolamento scorretto, magari abbinato al fatto che ti lavi i denti troppo presto dopo aver mangiato. infatti tutti i cibi o anche solo le bevande gassate tendono a portare via minerali dallo smalto, che diventa piu morbido e quindi se ti lavi i denti subito dopo aver mangiato te lo porti via. la saliva con gli ioni in essa disciolti è in grado di rimineralizzare lo smalto in un ora, quindi passato quel tempo puoi lavarti i denti tranquillamente, ovviamente usando uno spazzolino morbido e un dentifricio a bassa abrasività (perfetti quelli in gel, per vedere se un dentifricio va bene, mettine un po sull'indice e strofina indice e pollice... se senti dei granulini o comunque è "ruvido" allora non va bene!). infatti l'opinione comune di correre a lavarsi i denti subito dopo mangiato è sbagliata... questa quindi può essere una delle cause che ha portato il tuo dente a rovinarsi, oppure se è sulla porzione occlusale (la parte piatta del dente, quella che usi per masticare per intenderci) può essere che tu abbia l'abitudine di digrignare i denti di notte... purtroppo non dai altre informazioni e quindi non posso aiutarti di piu, ti consiglio comunque di andare a far vedere il tuo dente da un dentista!|`|d899166914426a45a83a3bf13153581baa	vai dal dentista!|`|uJMvOuP0aa	No, non ricresce!!!

tuo aggrapparsi alle gambe, la macchina che ti fa cadere giù secondo me è lui che ti fa soffrire ma il fatto che ti salvi è che tu riesci ogni volta a non farti mettere i piedi in testa e ogni volta riesci a reagire. ma perchè non segui un mio consiglio:lascialo perdere.lo so è difficile ma con un pò di forza ci riuscirai poi perchè penso che tu meriti qualcosa in più di questo stupido che non capisce che sta scherzando con una persona che lo vuole e che ci soffre quando lui fa lo stupido!!!!nei migliori dei casi con il tempo lui cambierà e riuscirà ad apprezzarti per quello che sei ma nel peggiore dei casi continuerà ad insistere per avere solo quello e dopo!?ti eviterà come se tra voi due non sia successo niente. molla ora prima che soffri di più. ti auguro un grosso e sincero in

paurosi..dovrebbero essere sempre ben accetti perchè ci aiutano a capire meglio noi stessi,le nostre paure e il nostro inconscio.<br>  Non è assolutamente vero che i sogni non significano niente!<br>  I sogni sono delle rielaborazioni di tutto ciò che ci capita durante la giornata,dei nostri pensieri,desideri,immagini impressionati,sogni ad occhi aperti,preoccupazioni,paure e segreti che non vorremmo confessare neanche a noi stessi.<br>  Non dico che se sogni di cadere in un precipizio poi ci cadi davvero ma comunque hanno un loro senso particolare.<br>  Nel tuo caso specifico ci sono chiarissimi riferimenti tra ciò che ti è capitato "da sveglia" e ciò che hai visto nel sogno.<br>  Allora..esaminiamo gli elementi che abbiamo..Il precipizio potrebbe simboleggiare la tua paura in merito a una possibile storia col ragazzo che ti piace...<br>  Per quanto riguarda il guidare senza patente...non so..forse insicurezza..oppure scava in te stessa..nelle vicende che ti sono capitate ultimamente..magari ci trovi qualche connessione...<br>  Il fatto che quando sei caduta nel burrone ti sei poi aggrappata alle gambe di lui per risalire mi fa pensare che tu questa storia non la vedi bene,ti fa paura,la vedi appunto come un passo nel buoio (o nel vuoto di un burrone magari...) ma allo stesso tempo sei speranzosa...pensi che comunque ci sia qualcosa in quel ragazzo a cui ci si possa appigliare (forse il fatto che vi siete a lungo guardati negli occhi ti ha fatto sperare affinchè questa storia vada bene...)<br>  Non so..Spero di averti aiutato a chiarirti un pò le idee..ma soprattutto spero che la storia col ragazzo che ti piace vada per il meglio ;) Mi raccomando però..non cedere a nessuna proposta indecente (qualunque essa sia,non vale la pena sacrificare se stessi e le proprie idee per nulla al mondo,e poi per quanto ti piaccia questo ragazzo che presupposti può avere un'ipotetica storia con lui se inizia coi ricatti???)<br>  Fammi sapere...<br>

Gracias a eso me siguió un médico del hospital que me fue sacando todos los remedios que me daban......de a poco fui volviendo a ser yo misma...de a poco empecé a comprender yo sola que estaba adentro de una pesadilla...y aunque me tomó un tiempo salir.....nunca sentí algo tan absurdo como dejarse enfermar por un médico......<br>  siempre que recuerdo ese episodio de mi vida....vuelvo a agradecerle a los médicos del hospital que, gratis, me devolvieron a mí misma.....|`|wuhuFklFaa	suspender 2 examenes de ecuaciones; uno normal y otro de recuperacion<br>  lo absurdo esque me da una rabia xque...<br>  ahora me salen mejor que a nadie???????????????|`|0388c3a94703f23145d2a3cc1073dfccaa	Absurdo??

ddac72100074050318d61b1eae35f698aa	Because muscles grow as a result of the muscle fibres and nervous system being subjected to weight-bearing movements that they are not accustomed to -i.e. the body adapts to the demands made of it -the microtears are just a byproduct of that weight bearing exercise and are not the catalyst behind why muscles get stronger.  Stretching does not place any demand on your body to increase it's strength, so no muscle development will occur. Microtears may occur in both activities, but these are not the cause behind increases in muscle strength and size. In any event, you should not be stretching a muscle to the point where you are tearing the muscle fibers.|`|c478f056cb88e6ce86dc4fca2726b493aa	no resistance

Once your body starts to absorb the right nutrients and vitamins and protein then you’ll be amazed how quickly you will feel the difference, usually within the first 48 hours if you get the right supplements and help. I had no energy and felt just generally rotten all round so I sought the advice of a nutritional coach (whose advice was FREE) and got myself some great products, I even got free samples before I got started so I could see just how good they were!! There is a website called myhealthabc.com  If go on there and fill out the details (you must be over 18 and you’ll need a debit or credit card-or someone who can help you) page you will get a call with no pressure about what you need. There is a mall area as well that’s got some great info and its all set out with easy to follow headings so you can find what you want. It’s so easy and the stuff they have is excellent. I have been using their products for over two years and I feel great.  I lost 70 pounds in less than seven months!! My sister lost 60 pounds in five months. The stuff is amazing.

54f19908c72b1e43699f4be685beb95baa	First, it depends a lot on how heavy you are and how much muscle mass you already got. Also, gaining muscle has a lot to with eating correctly and getting a lot of sleep. Without proper diet and enough sleep, nothing you do in the gym will cause you to gain muscle. Of all the lifts you listed only leg presses are likely to add significantly to your total muscle mass. 2/3 of our muscle mass is supposed to be below our waistline if we are correctly proportioned. Consequently, leg lifting and more leg lifting, "going deep to grow", is what you must do to achieve your goal. The largest upper body muscle group is the back. The best way to add mass to your back is pull ups, especially wide grip, and T bar rows.  And, finally, if you want to gain mostly all muscle you must include a lot of cardio to stay lean. Personally, I was able to lift a lot heavier after I started supplementing with creatine and I only gained 5 lbs. Probably all muscle given how much heavier I was able to lift.|`|1faaa7c7632b4b6aa5ff1cf603864793aa	It totally depends on your body type. Women take longer to build up muscle just because of our body types. Men can start lifting weights and put on muscle easy. If you belong to a gym have them do the caliper test on you or invest on one of those really good scales that can measure body fat and test yourself.|`|c478f056cb88e6ce86dc4fca2726b493aa	Make sure you are eating enough food. Try doing pyramids. 10,8,6 reps and raise the weight every rep. But make sure you can barely finish the last rep. Do that for about 4 weeks, then swich to doing 10 reps 3x with one weight, and make sure you are glad its over when you get to 10. You could be 10lbs heavier within 2months. I gained 8 in 3 weeks since Jan 1st. Protein shake everyday before i lift and NO Xplode to get me energy. Good luck, you can do it!!<br>  <br>  -Dave K
9bd4f9dcf34a2c43bdbd2fe05bcb3702aa	yes and running or jogging is working out , as long as you do aerobic exercise you will lose weight and faster than if you work out with weights|`|a33b1cc15a1c86fcada28959a66638dfaa	You actually lose more weight by running and/or jogging so its good. Try to run atleast a mile and a half whenever you get the chance to. Try not to eat too much junk food, if you eat right then you should be squared away!|`|AA11572792	yes! i ran half a mile at a slow speed today and burned 80 calories! i know it is not much, but that took me less than five minutes. imagine the possobilities.|`|c478f056cb88e6ce86dc4fca2726b493aa	Well if you run and jog, odds are you will be more active than you are now, therefore burning more calories and losing weight. BUT...If you want to try and keep that weight off, I would suggest counting calories.  The good thing about eating, is that it is a habbit. You just need to change your eating habbit to something healthy. Do some research on what you can and can't eat, and start counting.  After a couple of weeks or even a week, it gets pretty easy.  Just stick with it and you will be fine. Running and jogging also build muslce in your body which will cut fat when you arn't moving. So if you want to see great results and fast, do it all. If your too lazy (not in a mean way, just not motivated) to count calories and workout, then yea running is better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Also, lifting high reps and lower weight (if you want) will help build muscle and cut down fat. Oh yeah, lots of protein. (Not lots, but you know, a good amount).<br>  <br>  -Dave K|`|dc8a6fd80bb6756c7e7edb3298ce2468aa	Of course!  I assume that by "working out" you mean lifting weights.    An hour of weightlifting only burns about 160 calories/hour, and it helps you BUILD MUSCLE not BURN FAT.  What burns fat is cardio (like, as you said, running and jogging) and reducing your calorie intake, which you are doing/plan to do.  If you just want to get skinny, cardio+reduced diet=success.  But if you want muscle too, I suggest weightlifting.
iGJ4klvoaa	Yes.  It is obvious that you overdid your workout and strained those particular muscle groups.  They are at the repair and remodeling stage of recovery that is why you feel tingling.  The blood flow is starting to perfuse into the area and the tissues are loosening.  Give it a few more days.|`|AA11085011	Make sure you are not consuming and Aspartame - at all!<br>  <br>  Sounds to me like a mild case of Asp- poisoning.

I work out 4 times a week for a couple of hours and I have been for a while. Monday I decided to change the routine up so I did a different bench and different tri workouts. I pulled both tri's badly. Im supposed to work them out again today but I wont, ill do bi's. Where i am going with this is, just rest em man, there not going anywhere. Dont hurt yourself and in a few days you will be good. Your being sore is just your body reacting to new things, kind of saying "whoa buddy, what the hell are you doing to me". Just rest, take it easy and dont go crazy at the gym. I work out a lot and Im sore as hell too, it happens youlll be fine just dont rush anything, wait until your better. Make sure your muscles are warm and keep them stretchin and keep them lose. Just dont lift to much, tearing a muscle is probably one of the most painful things that can happen. you wont, but im just saying. take it easy, youll be aight.<br>  <br>  dave|`|AA10469786	No, it's b/c you damaged the muscles.<br>  You need to start gradually, don't try to match the guy/gals that have been in the gym for years.|`|33d5f56edec4a1e28d8fc6290f8401baaa	Rest is really the best way to repair muscle, so get your 8 hours of sleep at night and take it easy on those areas when you go back to the gym.  Make sure to eat plenty of protein and drink plenty of water.  Some people say that bananas help muscle soreness, because of the potassium.  Light cardio like walking usually helps me when I have sore muscles, since it gets your blood circulating to remove any built up lactic acid.

But long term lifestyle change is the goal. If it helps you to change you eating habits and exercise appropriately, one or two months on it is fine. But beware of easy solutions.<br>  <br>  The FDA just slapped huge fines on companies that were making false claims about fad and herbal weight loss products. In their statement, they explained that the ONLY way to lose weight is to eat less calories and exercises more.<br>  <br>  Make a healthy meal plan that you can stick to, and then stick to it. Make a moderate exercises plan that you can stick to and then stick to it.<br>  <br>  That is they only method that works.<br>  <br>  What most people need is not "tricks" and "secrets" but rather moral support. Overeating is a disease of isolation. It is when we feel lonely, disconnected, incomplete, unloved... that is when we overeat. So I would recommend joining a group for emotional and spiritual support: church, synagogue, yoga class, Overeaters Anonymous, whatever. <br>  <br>  That will make the difference you are seeking. Good luck!

c478f056cb88e6ce86dc4fca2726b493aa	You might want to stop taking those pills, they are not a good habbit to get into, plus your kids might see you and think its ok. But thats not anything you don't know. What I would do is try to count your calories daily.  See if you can keep it aroun 1800 a day and no more. Don't have fatty foods or pop. Drink a lot of water. Now that you have kids, exersizing I'm sure, is not on your schedule.  But maybe try to get a video tape of an exersize at home thing.  Wake up 30 min earlier and do it then.  Just go to bed 30 min earlier to make up for it.  You are not overweight or anything, you are a good size, so you don't have to be drastic. This small step should help you get toned. It should be ok. <br>  <br>  -Dave

Side effects may include irregular menstrual periods for the first approximately three months, including periods lasting longer than normal, bleeding or spotting between periods, heavy bleeding, or going with no period for the mentioned period of time. Common side effects include weight gain, nervousness, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, mastalgia, dizziness, dermatitis/rash, hirsutism, scalp-hair loss, headache, depression, and acne. Sometimes, pain, itching or infection at the site of the implant will occur. Ovarian cysts may also occur, but usually do not require treatment, although they can cause pain even if benign.

JfuqCEa9aa	Protein helps you feel full and is good in that respect, but be careful... TOO MUCH PROTEIN IS BAD FOR THE LIVER because the liver will struggle to metabolize the excess protein and will be unsuccessful.  In healthy people, this is not generally considered a big problem, unless you have liver disease or are an alcoholic or dependent on one or more drugs.  As a general rule of thumb, the body can absorb between 20-30 grams of protein per sitting (that is, every two to three hours).  More than that will not be useful and will cause your liver to work harder than it should.  Hope this helps.

If he does put his defences up try to make a compromise, explain how it would make you feel better if you could eat together in the evenings. Then if you prepare him a simple salad for starter, a healthy meal e.g. grilled turkey steaks with rice and vegetables, with fruit salad for dessert, he may realise that the food he has been missing is tasty and healthy and it also brings him closer to the one he loves.

One of the best things I think you can do for your future hubby is maybe do a diet WITH him, otherwise he might feel a bit overwhelmed, and he'll feel accused, rather than you being concerned. Make the points to him that you made on here - he needs to be healthier to be a better role model, and to just plane be around longer for his kid, and your future kids, if you're thinking about it! If you can, try to do it as  a family thing, and you don't have to make the changes all at once. Start by cooking more at home - making your own burgers (with salads and lots of veg on top), which i garentee will be healthier than what you eat when you're out.  If you check out sparkpeople.com they usually have some family health oriented articles, and it might give you some good ideas on how to approach things. Good luck!

Choose a nice show, not stimulating, till you feel drowsy. Go to bed without doing anything else. Count from 1 till fall asleep.

AA11301029	cardio+weight training+healthy eating=weight loss. you need to burn more calories than you eat to lose weight. you need to exercise 30-60 minutes a day to burn fat and reap all of the benefits of exercise. it needs to be consistent. secondly, you need to reconfigure your eating style. start eating 3 moderate meals a day and 3 small snacks a day adding up to about 1800 calories to lose weight. to maintain weight, you need about 2300 calories a day. eat plenty of brightly colored fruits, vegies, berries, low fat and natural proteins such as chicken, fish, ham, nuts, peanut butter, beans, and low fat dairy and soy products and high fiber, whole grain, whole wheat pastas, cereals, crackers, etc. make sure to drink plenty of water and green teas, and try to drink no more than one or two cans of diet soda a day. invest in a pedometer to monitor how many steps you take a day and increase it weekly until you are walking between 10,000 and 20,000 steps a day. this will take work to change your lifestyle, but it's the only way to get healthy. good luck.|`|5f30a11f0d2690faff701f530dc46b82aa	believe it or not, breast feeding for 6 months to one year helps you to lose your baby fat.

c478f056cb88e6ce86dc4fca2726b493aa	People are mistaken when they say doing crunches will make your stomach smaller.  It will make it stronger and you can get a 6 pack. But what does a 6 pack matter if you can see it because of a pot belly. You can not pin point a place on your body and lose weight there. The best way to cut stomach fat is just doing cardio and cutting down on calories. Sit-Ups will make your abs look good though when you shrink your stomach.  Cardio, less calories, no crap food like cookies and no pop. Cardio a few days a week.

The syndrome got its name from a Dutch eye doctor named Petrus Johannes Waardenburg who first noticed that people with differently colored eyes often had a hearing impairment. He went on to study over a thousand individuals in deaf families and found that some of them had certain physical characteristics in common. <br>  <br>  One commonly observed characteristic of Waardenburg syndrome is two differently colored eyes. One eye is usually brown and the other blue. Sometimes, one eye has two different colors. Other individuals with Waardenburg syndrome may have unusually brilliant blue eyes. <br>  <br>  People with WS may also have distinctive hair coloring, such as a patch of white hair or premature gray hair as early as age 12. Other possible physical features include a wide space between the inner corners of eyes called a broad nasal root. In addition persons with WS may have low frontal hairline and their eyebrows may connect. The levels of hearing loss associated with the syndrome can vary from moderate to profound. <br>  <br>  Individuals with Waardenburg syndrome may have some or all of the traits of the syndrome. For example, a person with WS may have a white forelock, a patch of white hair near the forehead, and no hearing impairment. Others may have white patches of skin and severe hearing impairment. The severity of the hearing impairment varies among individuals with WS as do changes in the skin and hair. <br>  <br>  On rare occasions, WS has been associated with other conditions that are present at birth, such as intestinal disorders, elevation of the shoulder blade, and disorders of the spine. A facial abnormality, known as cleft lip and/or palate, also has been associated with WS. <br>  <br>  <br>  Top<br>  <br>  Types of Waardenburg syndrome<br>  There are at least four types of Waardenburg syndrome. The most common types of WS identified by scientists are Type 1 and Type 2. The different types of physical characteristics a person has determines the type of WS. Persons who have an unusually wide space between the inner corners of their eyes have WS Type 1. Hearing impairments occur in about 20 percent of individuals with this type of Waardenburg syndrome. Persons who do not have a wide space between the inner corners of their eyes, but who have many other WS characteristics are described as having WS Type 2. About 50 percent of persons with WS Type 2 have a hearing impairment or are deaf. <br>  <br>  <br>  Top<br>  <br>  Cause<br>  As a genetic disorder, Waardenburg syndrome is passed down from parent to child much like hair color, blood type, or other physical traits. A child receives genetic material from each parent. Because Waardenburg syndrome is a dominant condition, a child usually inherits the syndrome from just one parent who has the malfunctioning WS gene. Actually, there is a 50/50 chance that a child of an individual with WS will also have the syndrome. <br>  <br>  <br>  Top<br>  <br>  Research studies<br>  Scientists have identified and located four different genes for Waardenburg syndrome: PAX3, MITF, EDNRB, and EDN3. WS type 1 and 3 have been associated with mutations in the PAX3 gene; WS type 2 with the MITF gene; and WS type 4 with the EDNRB and EDN3 genes. While scientists are studying all of these genes, currently, the most information is available on the PAX3 and MITF genes and their role in Waardenburg syndrome. <br>  <br>  The PAX3 gene is located on chromosome 2 and controls some aspects of the development of the face and inner ear. The MITF gene is found on chromosome 3. It also controls the development of the ear and hearing. Scientists are now studying these genes to better understand how they operate in controlling the normal growth of the ear and the development of hearing. This information will help scientists understand why persons with WS sometimes develop hearing problems.|`|b3c583b282332b24ebc587c5da3a6430aa	Waardenburg syndrome is an inherited genetic disorder which may cause hearing loss and partial albinism. It is believed to account for 2-3% of cases of congenital deafness (deaf at birth). It affects both males and females, and people of all ethnic backgrounds. It is estimated to occur in 1 of 42,000 individuals.

c478f056cb88e6ce86dc4fca2726b493aa	Ok a minor heart problem is something you should consider. You should start by walking for about 40min a day and try to lose a little bit of weight. Drink a lot of water also. You will become a lot healthier and will be able to do more things.  Working out is strenuous on the body and you don't want to risk anything. Take care of yourself first, try to get into good eating habbits too. No pop, good food, water, and cardio.  When you get fit and your ready, then start lifting. You can start with pushups. When you can do about 100 of them in 15 min, then start benching. Flat bench high reps and light weight. You are too young and big, with your heart problem, to push yourself to the extreme yet.

You should only lose 1-2 lbs a week to stay healthy. that is about 8-10lbs a month. 4months and you can possibly do it if you work hard at it. Cardio 4-5x a week for at least 30 min and weight train 2-3x a week to build muscle so you can cut down fat while you are inactive.  Whoever says yes to you in a month or even two is mistaken and do not try it. Just watch what you eat and drink wate. 4 months goes by fast. And if you take your time, you will keep the weight off. if you listen to them who say yes, you will gain it right back if you cheat for a week or two. good luck, do it right!!!<br>  <br>  -dave

urzmELEsaa	Men can have low levels of testosterone, and the only way to know for sure is to have your testosterone levels measured at the doctor's office.  Like any other hormone in the body, testosterone levels can be measured with a blood sample.  Effects of low testosterone include fatigue, decreased libido, depression, decreased tumescence, etc.  Under no circumstances would a low testosterone level cause a man to act more feminine.

d1799f738a065a71a3f4ec0b875583ccaa	Practically, the only way your metabolic rate can be adjusted is by altering the amount of strenuous excercise you do.  Your body adjusts the way it uses food based on its pattern of usage.  i.e. if your body is used to having food sit around and not being used, it doesn't need to metobolize it quickly, and vice versa).<br>  <br>  That being said, if you are young, you may have a high metaboblic rate that will wane over time.  So, be careful and don't try to fatten up too much now, b/c it will become much tougher to get rid of as you get older.|`|VMNq8P5Haa	if u eat breakfst on a regular basis, eat hot or spicy food, or mayb that you food contains nutrient like fibre that speed up your metabolism|`|d2dfa0f94b062ac2ab94c79912b1fd0daa	normalise is that a proper word?

SSNzrNf3aa	i doubt it will hinder your arms development. large arms are not caused by big bones, but it does help make the base larger and makes ur arms appear bigger but very slightly. i have a small frame as well, but i focused on arms for several years. <br>  it is hard to develop muscle on ur wrists, but forearms and bicep tricep, and deltoids are usually easy for isolation exercises. My favorite exercise for arms was the preacher curl. <br>  -try measuring diameter of your arms now, and set a goal of adding about 0.5 inches every 3-4 months.|`|c478f056cb88e6ce86dc4fca2726b493aa	You should be ok, but you should not start lifting real heavy until about 17-18. When you body is more fully grown. You should lift light weight and higher reps. If you want to get bigger, try to eat better, or more than you do now and drink lots of water. your body needs nutrients to grow big, but you dont want to distract your body from growing bigger. So just lift easier and if you want to get bigger, eat more and gain some weight  a little bit and tone with light weights so you looks big, and then when you get a little older, you can push yourself to the max for size.
JFji7sjqaa	I empathize with you more than you could know.  I too suffered from this awful problem.  From the info you have given it appears that your mind is  over-stimulated when you arrive home from class.<br>  Here's what you can do.   If you are hungry when you get home eat a little bowl of cereal and milk.  Being hungry when you go to bed will bother you when you sleep. Do not drink any soda pop, or caffeine, or watch any TV or listen to any stimulating music.  Stretch your muscles. You have been sitting in class for 3 hours. You can do some light reading if you want. About an hour before you want to go to bed get into a warm bath and drink some "Sleepy Time" tea or warm milk.  If you don't like plain milk put a little vanilla in it but not chocolate (will keep you awake).  Set your alarm for "music wake" for eight hours sleep.<br>  When you get into bed, lie down comfortably on your back and then,starting at your toes tense each muscle in your body for about 5-10 seconds until you reach your fingers.  By then you will be feeling very lazy and relaxed.<br>  In the morning, get up when your alarm softly wakes you.   During the day have some fun and do something productive including exercise - just some walking for a few blocks is fine.  It's all about balancing work and play. In the afternoon, take an hour nap.   Repeat the process above.  In no time, you will have trained yourself to sleep properly.  <br>  I should mention that there may be an underlying problem with depression which will rob you of sleep.  Also if you snore (sorry), that may indicate a medical sleep disturbance problem which sometimes can be offset by weight loss, smoking cessation, or surgery.  <br>  I hope this helps you.|`|F7ffP9rNaa	Go to the gym one day, work out REAL hard, take a shower, and take a big nap.

Hope it helps :)|`|b55758ef239a2e5946a909c5944c3f4daa	dont juss stay home and do nuthin when you have free time go out and enjoy your self like go work out, go have fun ,idk do wat you do best|`|61f1330b59a7cb4fe3ffdbfaeb4db7ffaa	Perhaps you're just not tired enough,<br>  exercise would help this (before your class). <br>  Don't sleep until noon, get up @ 7:00 or 8:00 a.m., you're throwing your sleep cycle off.<br>   Also, try some Melatonin which is a hormone which will help you fall asleep.<br>  As we age we tend to make less of this hormone, thus lies the difficulty in falling asleep.   It's secreted by the pineal gland, a pea-size structure at the center of the brain, as our eyes register the fall of darkness melatonin is produced to help our bodies regulate our sleep-wake cycles.<br>  Be patient with yourself because your sleeping will get better,<br>  worrying about it makes it worst.|`|32edf6bbc923ed62b18ed8d31e83a082aa	Welcome to the adult world.

I would question the quality of sleep.  If you're waking in the middle of the night or maybe you're moving a lot like restless leg syndrome or sleep apnea.  Or, your mind isn't cycling through the full sleep cycle so you're not going into the full deep sleep stages.   The best way to determine difficulties with sleeping is to do a sleep study.  They hook up to a machine and monitor you while you sleep, it'll let you know if something's wrong.  Another thought is you could have some mild depression that's leaving you feeling tired through out the day.|`|AA11864592	If you are sleeping that much and not feeling rested you are not getting quality sleep.

Either way, the result is a scar, and despite what the TV commercials say, they don't disappear with Vitamin E or cocoa butter (or on their own). Most people have scars in one area or another, and companies seem very eager to sell snake oil to self-conscious individuals.<br>  <br>  If you're seriously concerned about it, you can have minor surgery done to remove it, but the results at best will only be a slightly less offensive (or noticeable) scar.

Also remember it takes 2 hours of walking to burn as much calories as a 30 min run.|`|AA12081817	I lost 105 pounds in 6 months.  Here is how I did it.<br>  1. Every morning get up and walk for 45 minutes.  You can start with less time, but you want to get up to 45 minutes, and it must be fast walk. You want your heart rate to go up.  It must be in the morning, it kick starts your metabolism.<br>  2. I cut out Red Meat, and fatty foods.  Boneless skinnless chicken breast, baked, or grilled, rice and vegetables (steamed).<br>  3. Eat half.  Just eat half of what you normally eat.  Put 1/2 on your plate, and put the rest away.  Cook less.  When you go to fast food, get salads only.  Or grilled chicken.  No fries,  only diet soda. Or water.<br>  <br>  It will work, once you get into a routine, you will get hooked on the results, and you will keep the routine.  It has been over a year for me.  <br>  <br>  Also start counting your calories.  Write them down.  You would be amazed as to how much more aware you are of your caloric intake, if you actually write it down.  We recently discovered a site that offers a great program that counts calories, as well as keeps track of everything.  It allows multiple users, so everyone in the family can keep track.  They offer a free 7 day trial, and so far I am very impressed with the product.  Try the 7 days and see.  It allows you to add the exercise that you do during the day, which increases the amount of calories you can take in.  Very Cool!!<br>  <a href="http://www.calorieking.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.calorieking.com</a><br>  <br>  A sight with some really cool diet calculators and interesting calorie counting calculators is here.

Calories are just a measurement of energy, but your body will often store that energy away as fat.  One of the best ways to lose weight is keep a log of your meals, and the calories you take in (by reading the labels and such).  Then, when you are exercising, keep track of how many calories you are burning; there are various gadgets out there to monitor that sort of thing, and if you search well enough they can be pretty cheap.  If you continue to burn more calories than you take in, you're bound to see results.<br>  <br>  The hardest part about this will be maintaining your diet; if you aren't disciplined, it will all be for naught.<br>  <br>  Additionally, to lose weight good exercises to try are cardiovascular ones, like running and swimming.  Walking is okay, but it's easy to rationalize by saying "Well, I walked two miles, I suppose that's enough," when really WALKING two miles is nothing, and RUNNING two miles will get you the results you seek.<br>  <br>  Consult your doctor or physician before embarking on any diet or exercise program.<br>  <br>  P.S. -- Be wary of diet pills; many are a scam.  There is no substitute for good, hard work.|`|7yyJQFonaa	You should try the special k diet Its easy and effective.I lost 7lbs. in my first 2 wks.The diet plan is either on the back of the box or you can go to the website specialk.com.This should work for you as long as you keep exercising.|`|84eb2cdcc521fc60bcb63531e72f5b7caa	Probably your eating habits.

I am a male at 5'9" in height. I changed my diet to 6 small meals a day. I eat every 3 hours starting at 7 am with my biggest meal for breakfast about 500 calories then about 350 calories for second meal and decreasing about 50 calories per meal from there. I get a workout IMMEDIATELY BEFORE breakfast, this kickstarts my metabolism, and then I usually eat an apple then oatmeal with whole grain bread and milk. The oatmeal is digested SLOWLY so my boosted metabolism causes my body to digest my bodyfat (at least thats what I've been reading). I incorporate alot of vegetables into my meals, it helps to satisfy my hunger without excess calories, plus they have vitamins galore. Talking about excess calories, I cut out fruit juices, soda, or any liquids other than water and milk. Fruit juices and soda usually contain alot of sugar I find, which your body will use to fuel your body, instead of digesting your food into glucose(sugar), your body will store it as fat. I try to do something anything that will cause me to burn calories, exercise, housework sometimes shadowboxing or exercycling, anything before I eat, this keeps my metabolism up to speed. Planning your meals is important and don't prepare too much food or you might eat it all, a lesson I learned my first week. Self control and planning are critical. It is now March 6, 2007 I weigh 211Lbs, 19 pounds I lost , I still can't believe how easy it is really. 19 pounds shed in 34 days. I feel great , I look so different. People say my skin is so much brighter and I look different and that makes me feel good. I am full of energy and I am so much happier so I must be healthy. Veggies, fruit, whole grains, lean meats and WATER. I am lactose intolerant so I dont get much dairy, just enough milk to get some calcium. Its important to eat, as eating increases your metabolism as well. I must add that my weight loss wasn't immediately apparent as I was gaining muscle mass when I started working out. Muscle is heavier than fat and more muscle means more calories burning throughout the day. Also, less sodium in my diet meant my body shed excess water as well. Don't eat out of a can and don't drink out of a can. Canned foods are usually high in sodium and/or sugar. I didn't have to buy anything special I'm actually saving alot of money, the healthier foods cost far less and tapwater is cheap.(well my water bill is 100 dollars every three months so I'm gonna start drinking the stuff instead of just flushing it down the toilet). Fasting will reduce your metabolism and the amount of sodium in your body, and you will drop weight fast but its all water weight which you gain right back plus more when you start eating again because your metabolism is so low. I wasn't even working out as hard as I could have been, but now that I see how much weight I lost so effortlessly I cranked up my workout routine and I noticed my weight loss slowed down alittle but my girlfriend noticed my muscles are more visible and are getting bigger now. Big Smile on my face.<br>  There is no 1 magic thing that will make the excess weight fall off and stay off, it's a combination of many things. Essentially it is a way of living.|`|j45kwcOBaa	well, it could be a number of things.  First off, what are you eating?  If have a diet that is high in fat, processed foods, carbonated beverages, and sugar, than yes, it is going to be hard for you to lose weight.  Also, how often are you eating, and what size portions are you eating?  Research shows that it is better to eat a few times throughout the day rather than starving yourself all day and indulging in a large dinner at night.  It is best to eat fruits and vegetables, while also remembering to have protein and small amounts of fat in your diet.  I really reccommend cutting soda out of your diet. Really try to stop drinking it because it is nothing but empty calories.  The same thing goes for many juices/juice cocktails.  When buying juice, always look on the back label and see if it says 100% juice.  If it does not, it may as well just be sugar water.  Remember too that when eating late at night, your body does not have time to metabolize everything that you ate, before you go to sleep.  That is why I always try to stop eating for the night at around 8 or so.  It is amazing the difference you will soon feel.  It is important to eat a healthy breakfast to get your day started, and soon enough, you will be on your way to dropping pounds!|`|vqETDVr0aa	I suggest that you try body cleansing. I tried it and really got lean quickly. I lost 15 pounds in 9 days and also 3 inches off my waist. I do body sculpting so getting leaner was my goal. My sister did this program too and she lost a lot of weight quickly. I did not know too much about cleansing but there are a lot of TV commercials about this stuff. This is a body cleanse and not just a colon cleanse, I wanted my body to get lean quickly and this did the trick!

AA10266252	How old are you?  Many people lose height as they age because the vertebrae in their spine compress.  So if you're, say, 80, and you're two inches shorter than you were when you were 20 that would be normal.<br>  <br>  The only other reason I can think of would be if you've had some sort of surgery, particularly if it involved the removal or fusion of one or more vertebrae.<br>  <br>  Apart from that, it's probably just measurement error.  Where you wearing shoes when you were 5'4"?  Maybe you were standing up straighter?  Who measured your height, and how did they measure?  One or the other measurement was likely a fluke.  If it was the second one, then you can try measuring again and see if you're 5'4" again.  But if it turns out that you keep getting 5'2" then there's no way to go back in time and redo the other measurement, so you'll just have to assume that maybe the tape measure wasn't quite straight, or you forgot to take your shoes off, or something to that effect.|`|c4spQiCvaa	ur screwed|`|VLYO7zJeaa	How old are you?<br>  It might depend on how your eating and working out.

6Bg2F600aa	I have the same problem and I've had it for over 40 years, so don't get too excited.  In my case, the flaking is caused by a bacterial or fungal infection that keeps recurring, especially if you have oily skin or oily patches like I do.  The infection seems to be impossible to get rid of completely but it doesn't cause any problems and it certainly isn't dangerous.  It's just gross.  Apparently the infection is caused by soap accumulating in the pores of your skin or in the folds like the crevices that are created where your nose connects to your face.  I also have it on my eyelids and in my eyebrows and behind my ears but then I have a lot more folds than you do.  You can try treating it every time you wash your face with some alcohol or astringent lotion.  That helps keep the flaking down and keeps the infection away as well.  Email me if you would like more information.|`|a4296783b8c0d888860838d7d0ef7a1baa	Rub on olive oil everyday and then wash your face with mild facial cleanser(Eurcerin, dove, cetaphil). Then rub on raw egg and let it dry on your skin. Then wash it off again. Then put on moisturizer(cetaphil, Eucerin, vaseline). and see what happens after about a week.<br>  <br>  If you swim in the pool a lot or are out in the sun, you should wear Spf 30 or more(coppertone is good).

6a8b63509f849c74224491277dd5b568aa	You should take her to a regular doctor- which will probably refer her to a urologist-, the gyno isn't going to care too much because they mainly check her uterus, when that is not the problem.  Many older women have this problem, it could be many, many things. (kidney infection-pyelonephritis-,  urinary tract infection,  kidney failure, etc...)  The kidneys can develop many problems as you age, so this is most likely where the problem is.  The itchey rash is probably a yeast infection which a doctor could take care of very easily.  Take her in to see a general family doctor, soon.  Good luck.|`|34550d5f2dff52eadb5794f5944a6de1aa	Unfortunately as we get older our plumbing plays up a bit and its can happen that things come and go.  She must just continue to take whatever helps her at the time. As long as she isnt feeling sick with it.  Maybe water pills may help when it does happen. Good luck|`|5PcEU6s2aa	Your mother probably has a bladder infection that keeps coming back. cranberry juice does help. but go see a doctor not a gynecoligist. my wifes mother had the same problem.|`|jASFxn44aa	She probably needs to see a urologist. This could be a problem with her bladder, such as a loss in tone making it difficult to urinate. You can take her to a general practitioner and request a bladder scan to check for residual urine. Good luck!
2fYYAcSfaa	Si, pero debe ser una decision muy cuidadosa. Si desea tener hijos y la mujer esta sana, hay que considerar el riesgo de que pueda contagiarse la mujer y a traves de ella, el hijo. En el caso de una mujer HIV positiva, el embarazo no se contraindica, solo se recomienda que se embarace con una carga viral baja y siguiendo el tratamiento segun protocolo.<br>  El hombre, en cambio, si desea tener hijos con una pareja sana, debe ver los riesgos, hablarlo con su mujer y su medico, e intentarlo si lo decide cuando su carga viral sea indetectable, para disminuir (no eliminar) el riesgo de contagio.|`|99b4ec882949538393f1c4ecef7f71a9aa	No lo mas seguro es que   tanto la madre como  el hijo  resulten  contagiados.|`|60340fbaf2a15867e21c692ed167d9a5aa	Es imposible que ese hijo nazca sano ya que desafortunadamente el semen es una de las principales vias de contagio de sida y ya sabemos que ese es el medio para consebir, y en el semen va la enfermedad.
zxXokOegaa	Not sure about in Australia, I have eczema as well and I have to use special soaps that contain oatmeal to help with the itching(I could name them but I'm not sure if they are available over there) I use a lotion called Eucerin that's for dry skin, but I use it for my eczema.It's done wonders for me........hope it helps|`|7xpH5rP6aa	The best thing to do is to apply a good emollient, like Eucerin, while your skin is still damp, right after bathing. Only when your condition is unusually bothersome should you use hydroC cream. I have excema too. Good luck!|`|9c8c0abfbc60ba4e60b28b0e9f858783aa	try using a shea butter or cocoa butter lotion as an alternative. hydro cortisone cream is usually good as well but i don't know the affect of it but i know it works really works. and try taking benedryl for the itching.|`|9f38db29a31bdd91f3bba66fada40705aa	Try taking brewers yeast, I used to take it when I was younger for excema and it helped and I didn't have to use creams as much. It comes in pill form and you should be able to find it at any vitamin store, maybe even your supermarket. When ever I go to the doctors for cream they give me a medium strenghth steroid cream...
F9ds65VEaa	I have the same thing. What I did was started washing my hands with a softer soap. Something like dove, that way it does not dry out my hands. If you dry out your hands they will sweat more to keep moisture in them. Also a good thing to do it use a soft hand creme daily. Again it plays into keeping good moisture on your hands.|`|AA11707062	Try reducing your intake.  Iodine is found in kelp (the highest concentration of iodine known) and iodine-rich foods, such as beef liver, turkey, asparagus, white onions and broccoli.<br>  <br>  Try these home remedies:<br>  <br>  Antiperspirants It works for your underarms and it will work for your palms! Try this out in private first - you may not like the feel or the smell!<br>  <br>  Astringents Witch hazel or alcohol wipes help shrink pores and reduce sweating. Try rubbing medical alcohol wipes over your palms moments before you have to greet somebody.<br>  <br>  Sage A tincture of sage is good for reducing perspiration. To make the tincture, combine 1/2 cup of powdered sage leaves with 1 1/4 cups of vodka or vermouth in a well-sealed bottle; let stand for two weeks, shaking twice daily; strain and store in another bottle. Take 25 drops 3-4 times daily, or as needed. Drink a cup of sage tea daily to reduce perspiration, too.<br>  <br>  Tea bags Hold a wet tea bag in your palm for 10 to 15 minutes each day. You may need to use this technique for one to three weeks before a major event. The tannin in tea (regular - not herbal) is an astringent and its ability to shrink pores may decrease the perspiration.<br>  <br>  Zinc Taking zinc tablets has successfully reduced perspiration and body odor. However, don't take more than 15 mg daily for more than a week or two without medical supervision, as zinc may interfere with the absorption of copper, another trace element.|`|1acf41896f108bb693c0f25eca0722ceaa	eat more fruits it will help|`|16a15ea12859bd4d8f3faa765f5324a0aa	Try baby powder! u may smell like a babys bottom but it will keep them dry!

19d47e8f293e0b25e6346d7e02e94d3daa	That is called emotional ABUSE, and it is actually illegal (yes, emotional abuse is included in abuse laws). I've been through something similar. It is very severe, and it will have a major impact on the rest of your life. <br>  When you explain this to people (it is really good you are telling people), they think it is no big deal because I bet that when you explain it, you make it sound kind of like he is just an unfair parent, and people think you are just being the average kid. I think the main thing you need to make clear is that you are emotionally TORTURED and ABUSED. THose are the key words here. You need to make it clear that you are SCARED, and that he constantly screams and makes threats...I know exactly what you are going through, and it certainly isn't fair, and it is your right to live in an environment free of emotional, physical, and mental abuse. If I were you, I would seriously talk to a counselor and a teacher (if you are in school). I will also recommend the child abuse hotline, and a hotline called 1800-4-A-CHILD. They have people that can talk to you on the phone and help you figure things out.<br>  <br>  Remember, your father is mentally ill. His screaming, dragging things out, constant repetition...those are all signs of mental illness, and common in OCD. that, however, does not give him the right to treat you badly, and in fact makes your case for abuse more reputable. Please, talk to someone like a counselor.|`|a1d33c79fcd80691d09f4a4a7d20d0b3aa	It's called emotional abuse|`|1bcc0a57e83d93747625c74ecb78740aaa	It's called transference i think. When they transfer the emotions for one person to another.|`|23d2b98ea726ae766b590e47c35b0487aa	Sorry about your dad being a jerk.  It sounds to me like you need to cut all ties from him or accept him the way he is.|`|AA10653189	I have a brother and a sister who are like this.  You need to make a lot of space between you and him.  Can you talk to a social worker?  This abuse.  My dad was hard to be around too growing up and I moved out early.  You may need to move out for your own safety and sanity.  Sorry for your situation.  I can relate to it though.|`|b7b53d5507b2fa1b57f2094ae48183f9aa	YOU NEED HELP! "Iloveey" was right: what your father is doing is ABUSE (does it really matter what illness he has?)  and yes, it IS illegal. If you find out the "name" for what he has, it still won't "cure" him and you might start rationalizing what he does, like the child of an addict. <br>  <br>  You need to be away from him until he is FORCED to get therapy and have medication for the OCD. That might cause SOME of his behavior, since people with that are often "control freaks", not just with things but with people.<br>  <br>  I dated a guy who had that and became more emotionally abusive,  the longer I dated him. When he got really nasty one time,  I told him off, very loudly with as many curses as I could think of (which is a LOT!), got out of his car and kicked in the door! He knew never to mess with me again.<br>  <br>  You need therapy to deal with the anger and fear he's caused you...because believe me, it will NOT go away! Your father was most likely abused, and his OCD is just one result of that. You could end up like HIM (worse problems than you already have)if you don't get help!<br>  <br>  Stop trying to make sense of his behavior and get away from him. If you're too young, seek out a trusted relative, teacher or school counselor. You may love him but he's VERY SIck and as you said, he's ruining your life. Do it ASAP! Good luck to you!|`|3Bdvp35haa	sorry your dad has this problem.   Perhaps you should get to counselor and get professional informaion on what it is and how you can deal with it.  <br>     you are not ruined,   you are a wow person !     you are asking for help,   good for you,  courage, intelligent.  <br>     Accept the misery your dad has and yeah,  go to gym,  live your life and maybe at some point you can help him but,   you first.     don't give up ! Lots of people experience similiar things,  you are not alone.   you can be happyp and get rid of the depression and anxiety.   Yes you can !   get a therapist to help you believe in yourself.  <br>  good luck|`|9acc352f8b641c3d09a596544d80ae28aa	I really don't know the name of this but if he is doing this stuff to you is there anyway you could not talk to him and distant yourself for awhile.  If that is not an option is telling him how you feel and trying to make him understand an option?  Good luck|`|K38ij8Jcaa	Your description is that of a "manipulative bully". See if these fit. He always has to get his way, if he doesn't then everyone else is wrong, stupid or mentally challenged. Probably not many guy friends, and those he has don't come to his house.<br>  <br>  I am sorry that his problems have affected you. Please take my advice, seek counsel from someone you trust. Anyone who says it's no big deal is the wrong person to talk to. Do you have a Pastor you can talk to? Can you afford a professional counselor?<br>  <br>  No doubt that much of your depression is a result of this stressful relationship. I promise you, there is help and hope. Things can be normal for you.<br>  <br>  If you need to talk, you can IM me.

9f38db29a31bdd91f3bba66fada40705aa	first off if your body is producing oil that is a sign that you are not getting enough moisture in your skin. Also stress, diet, and exercise are a part of it and possibly puberty. My suggestion would be to go see a dermatologist. They can help you figure out exactly what it is causing this and give you a solution. If you don't want to see a dermatologist then cut out the fried fatty foods from your diet, get an oil free moisturizer and relax.|`|14ad394512d542c10b924db2e8b09cb7aa	Just latent puberty.

Altre, invece, hanno delle difficoltà nell’allattare con le protesi. Non é ancora molto chiaro perché le protesi mammarie a volte causano problemi nell’allattamento. Una spiegazione é che durante l’operazione si può danneggiare il canale della produzione del latte. Questo può capitare soprattutto se le protesi sono introdotte attraverso l’incisione peri-areolare. Potrebbe anche essere che le protesi effettuano la pressione sul tessuto mammario e fanno diminuire la produzione del latte. Le protesi messe sotto il muscolo potrebbero essere ottimali, in quanto l’interferenza con i canali lattiferi é ridotta, anche se gli studi professionali a questo proposito sono rari e non definiscono quando i problemi nell’allattamento sono causati dalla chirurgia stessa e quando ciò é dovuto alle protesi. Tuttavia, statisticamente parlando, le donne che hanno avuto l’incisione intorno al capezzolo sono meno capaci di allattare. D’altra parte, ci sono molte donne che hanno avuto le protesi messe sotto le ghiandole con l’inicisione peri-areolare e hanno ancora molto successo nell’allattamento|`|4bcd7fde2079eceafc3e24895331a7c5aa	ANKE X ME è UN DUBBIO....|`|TbWEiQMRaa	La protesi viene messa al di sotto della ghiandola mammaria, quindi a meno che non vi siano stati problemi chirurgici durante la posizione della stessa non vi dovrebbero essere problemi ad allattare.<br>  <br>  Edit: dopo un intervento chirurgico la sensibilita' della zona interessata subisce sempre delle variazioni, proprio perche' il taglio chirurgico va a intaccare le fibre nervose nell'area della ferita.|`|tTcDZTCXaa	si, perche la protesi viene messa sotto il muscolo, praticamente tra la cassa toracica e la mammella..quindi le ghiandole mammarie non vengono assolutamente danneggiate..magari si potrebbe avere un calo della sensibilitá, ma credo che sia un problema risolto ormai..

IANlViUqaa	You don't have to lose weight. Ask your doctor, and please stay AWAY form the diet pills. All girls are beautiful, despite their weight, but, anorexic, bulimic, or addicts to diet pills aren't beautiful, so express yourself.  Dance is a great way, and each day, maybe senak in a few sit ups or push ups or something that keeps your heart pumping. I have never heard of a pickle diet, but diets are not good for the body and mind, it only destroys yourself. Stay strong, and the best way is old fashioend and guarenteed, excersize.|`|IVjspiStaa	too much salt|`|ibSJqnSGaa	don't do it<br>  <br>  pickles have a lot of sodium from salt and that raises blood pressure, also sodium is a substance that fat clings to easily so it will be hard to lose weight.|`|7wYx9jCOaa	DONT use diet pills! They mess with your hormones! I missed my period almost three times in a row and I was bloated for two weeks! I'd rather you go on the silly pickle diet than use a weight loss supplement. Another alternative is eating tomatoes for a week, my dad did this and he lost 4 kg or something. However I must warn you, those who go on crash diets eg  you, will put on double the weight in 1-2 years time. In the end its better to loose weight the healthy way.|`|9jKbkv08aa	Don't do this eat salads... and drink lots and lots of water. Also drink green tea... it boosts you metabloism .Good luck and stay active!|`|zjjzaJyOaa	huh?|`|Bnl4D2Gjaa	Here's the deal princess...you will last about maybe 2 weeks on that pickle deal and then you will end up in the hospital getting tube fed....pickles are high in sodium....I know how you feel, I was an obese whale in middle school (try 250-275lbs!)...the best thing you can do for yourself is keep a caloric intake of about 1300-1500 calories (low fat, high fiber and protein). Drink 64oz of water a day. Exercise for 30-60minutes 4-6 days a week. Take a multi...trust me you will be looking good in no time....at my biggest which was my senior year in high school i was 330...don't get to that point...I lost 160lbs..it worked for me and I guarentee it will work for you! Read the small print of the diet pills (diet and exercise required) don't waste your money!|`|evaH0hUWaa	noo you r not to young to buy diet pills im 15 and i bought them it says u hav 2 be 18 to use the but u an buy them|`|wgL97qVNaa	All pickle diet would work, theres no protein so you'd become skinny yes but you'd look like a skeleton with skin on it.<br>  <br>  To eat healthy just try this i guarantee your lose weight.<br>  <br>  No cake or cookies or icecream or any sugary/fatty foods, cut them all out unless you want somthing sweet at the end of the week which then you should eat ice cream because it has calcium and its real sugar and not the corn syrup goop<br>  <br>  Also switch from to water. If you drink cold water alot your body will actually burn calories to pass it through your body because your body must warm it up to pass it through AND if you want you can add crystal light packets to the water to give it a taste which depending on the packet you choose is only 0-5 calories so thats alot better then 100-200 calories of a soda can.<br>  <br>  Add a 0 to your weight and thats how many calories you should eat a day. Now to keep your weight the same eat that many but if you want to lose weight cut out around 100 calories from your normal diet. Don't cut out more then 200 because then it'll come back later as flab.<br>  <br>  Good luck :{)
yHHdAMnQaa	You have OCD, you cannot stop yourself thinking of things no matter bad or good. you have to think them and when you think them you are not happy because your thoughts are unhappy things.. seek a psychiatrist and talk to him about it..|`|f05KdsZkaa	wow seriously, if you are prone to hypochondria you will be assuming all these illnesses told by these people! even me!! anxiety? adhd?ocd? bi-polar? w/c is which! no wonder when i first got here i thought i have all the mental illness! but dude i think that... that is anxiety.. if im not mistaken but that happened to me as well.. my thoughts are just the ones causing me distress.. as soon as i start having such thoughts seems like i can't take it off of my head.. even though its not true my mind just won't shut up..  that's anxiety.|`|PS0oSoXFaa	Are you bipolar? It sounds like it- racing thoughts, with symptoms getting better when you're drunk... This isn't an insult, by any means!, it's not your fault, but even your writing style sounds manic<br>  <br>  But if you're looking for "smart people"- see a psychiatrist! These symptoms aren't necessarily bipolar, it can happen with anxiety disorders, ADHD, or even other diseases that have possible psychotic/manic symptoms<br>  <br>  Listen, though, what you're saying about antidepressants making it worse- You're totally right, many of them (if not most of them) cause "rapid cycling" in bipolar people. (if this is what you have!) Bipolar people often try to get help for depressive symptoms, and family, therapists, doctors, even some psychiatrist assume they have clinical depression (since that's the symptoms obvious right then). But when bipolar people are put on antidepressants without a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic at the same time, their symptoms get *worse*- your mood swings, which were bad enough, get even more dramatic and happen much faster (rapid cycling). Even in people w/ bipolar II (the less severe form of bipolar, in which the depression is just as severe but the "mania" is only hypomania), antidepressants often trigger all-out mania<br>  <br>  This happened to me! My parents (doctors) and the college counselors decided I was depressed, which I was definitely was... But the Effexor they put me on made me go like crazy between a few days of feeling ultra-energetic, optimistic, like I was the most brilliant and amazing person in the world, and then I was hopeless and suicidal the next few days. My counselor even looked so proud when I told her I was "better," that my depression was gone- she totally missed the signs of mania. I was in the hospital two weeks later from a suicide attempt...<br>  <br>  Who put you on antidepressants? Did they diagnose you with anything? They must have... And are you getting help now, or did you stop for some reason? Get help! Good help, aka a psychiatrist not just a therapist. And make sure you tell them about your symptoms and the antidepressants making it worse...|`|AA11662490	sounds more like A.D.H.D. Adults can have this. I have a mild form of this so I know. If you could just control your thoughts. Or at least slow them down so you could process them. I guess I deal in my own way. I wish I could get on meds but went once to doc and they would not prescribe me any. I know they would you but make sure you go to a doc you know and have went to for a long time. the reason why docs are leary on pres drugs are people abuse, so the people who really need them are out of luck|`|qVZklYNPaa	Vicodin is not a tranquilizer, it is a narcotic (hydrocodone) plus acetaminophen used to relieve pain. That will not be of any use to your situation. Alcohol, although often used by people to help with "thoughts" of this kind, is also not only useless, but eventually dangerous. You are having the "what if" thoughts? They are the scariest things, aren't they? They come out of nowhere and smack you. The mind keeps spinning around like a record on a turntable, then the needle that spins the record gets stuck: "The newpaper had a story about a woman who burnt her house down. What if I lose control and burn my house down? I am so scared. I'm not going to read the newspaper anymore." OR "I'm at the movies trying to enjoy the show and the record gets stuck: " What if I stand up and just start screaming nonsense, or start taking my clothes off ?" I can't even go to the movies anymore". I am BEGGING you to PLEASE make an appointment with a psychiatrist NOW. You don't have to live this way. And, don't think that antidepressants will have a negative effect on you. You are getting ahead of yourself. Allow the doctor to do his job-all you have to do is listen to him/her, and follow up. That means-take the medication faithfully every day (it will not make you grow a third eye!), keep your appointments-get better-start living-have peace of mind. Yes, it is possible! Trust me. I know EXACTLY how you feel. If someone had told me to climb to the top of the Empire State building and my mind would stop torturing me, I would have. I would have done ANYTHING. You'll be okay, I promise.|`|umzuADEkaa	Hey There<br>  I would say you are suffering from Anxiety :)<br>  It's nothing to much to worry about becasue if you go to a doctor or a phycatrist there are many ways they can help you threw therapy or medication whatever you think would be best for you.<br>  There is not point getting anything to make you forget your thoughts becasue each time a situation pops up you are getting new ancious thoughts.<br>  Go and have a chat to you doctor and they will be able to help you :)<br>  Good luck!

Go to your doctor and get some antibiotics, take some simple pain killers - eg paracetamol or aspirin, use some lozenges that have local anaesthetic in them or a throat spray with a local anaesthetic in it - just be careful when you eat or drink hot or cold food as depending on how good the anaesthetic is, you won't feel the temperature of the food.|`|sOO93u5Oaa	May be tonsilitis or strep. <br>  <br>  <br>  Go to the doctor, they will more than likely put you on antibiotics.

cdda4c4868199cdcd19437a8658e399daa	You can easily retain fluids in a day, particularly if you eat a lot of salt.  The other answers are true as well.  You might be eating a few pounds of food in a day and unless you have a BM in the evening, you've still got those extra pounds in your digestive system.<br>  <br>  In addition, don't weigh yourself so much.  One time in the morning before you've eaten, is the best time.  Stick to that time and don't do it again until the next morning.  You won't worry so much about what your body's doing throughout the day.  Weighing before and after a bowel movement is a bit obsessive.  Sounds more like your scale is inconsistent, rather than you've actually GAINED 2 pounds in a matter of the minutes it takes to empty your bowels.|`|JnpZESNHaa	Weight fluctuation over the course of a day is natural and normal.  It happens because of water retention: we retain more water towards the end of the day.  Many women also find that their weight fluctuates when they are due for, or in the middle of, their period.<br>  <br>  Weigh yourself at the same time of day, and don't panic if you see the scales go up or down a little bit.  It's the longterm picture (what's happened over a month or 6 weeks) that counts.|`|uHoHChl9aa	You always weigh less in the morning so only ever weigh yourself at the same point of the day.

While I myself can't help getting on the scale several times a day I only count the morning. Not only is a lot of the water weight gone but so is the food you ate the night before. You actually burn calories while you sleep and most people sleep 6 to 10 hours a night. Make sure you are eating more than 1200 calories a day and that you eat breakfast. also if you eat 5 to 6 smaller meals that helps with your body's metabolism and if your largest meal is lunch this helps you with the calories you burn at night. Always weigh yourself at the same time and only count it on a week to week basis. as long as you are losing pounds there that's all that counts.|`|RW3SzwINaa	sometimes skipping meals makes you put on wait, the body realizes its not being fed and stores the fat in your body and wont let you burn it.<br>  best to eat 3 meals a day just modestly not titchy meals though|`|WvpG9Omyaa	If you eat a pie it will be included in your weight until you crap it out.|`|73Qzi3vVaa	take off your clothes<br>  <br>  and try again

JlHobP4taa	Why take the time to ask this question instead of going to the hospital. If you have to make yourself breath that's a problem. I have panic attacks myself and it sort of does sound like one but do you want to take the chance. If your meds were up it very well could be the cause. Your body might be okay with the lower level but can't tolerate the higher one. Anyway you should ask your doctor instead of people that have not been educated on this matter. If you don't like what your doctor said there are always others out there.......|`|pV6K2mm5aa	tylenol pm..you need some rest!  Give yourself a few more days...if it is a virus it will just have to run it's course.  HOWEVER, if you start having trouble breathing again, immediately take yourself to a hospital, that is nothing to mess around with.|`|NU3drLhbaa	Def go to the emergency room if you have trouble breathing|`|T8v39Aw9aa	It must be horrible to sit up awake like that, worrying, feeling lousy.  I'm sorry.<br>  <br>  I feel as though it's tough to answer your question because it sounds like you have some issues that might or might not be feeding into physical discomfort - anxiety?  Depression?  And I don't know whether your body dysmorphia is anorexia or bulemia, or just extremely low self-esteem?  But you're clearly being medicated for a few things that could be contributing to this.<br>  <br>  I don't want to tell you "it's nothing" because I'm not a medical doctor and I also don't want to make you feel like a hypochondriac.  Maybe it IS something, and going to the doctor as soon as you can will be the best idea.  But I also wanted to reassure you that people often don't realize exactly how much their worrying, anxiety, and stress can affect their bodies.  People have grand mal seizures over stress, for goodness' sake!  You'd be surprised how much you might be able to make yourself feel lousy (unintentionally, of course).<br>  <br>  Especially in the case of the breathing - I've had that feeling before.  The more you think about your own breathing and wonder if you're trying to hard to breathe normally, etc, the harder it become to breathe automatically!  And the constricted throat feeling is often a sign of anxiety, not related to anything else - even though I know it feels like something real.  You might really have given yourself a new form of - or an extreme form of - an anxiety attack, like your psychiatrist said.<br>  <br>  I know you're frightened and feeling absolutely lousy.  I don't know if there's anything I can say that will make you feel better, but... I think you're alright.  I mean, maybe you have a stomach flu and made it worse by being so anxious about it?  But I don't think there's anything wronger with you than there was a few days ago before this stuff happened.<br>  <br>  If this IS something real, I have no idea what it might be.  You sound young, and shaking, throwing up, clenching your teeth and panting are too general symptoms to be related to anything I can think of.  If it IS largely self-induced, or due in part to your previously existing conditions (depression, anxiety?) or the medications that you're taking to combat them (the antipsychotic, the zoloft), the best advice for you is to try and distract yourself and not think about it at all.  Watch a favorite movie, read a book, play a video game.  Thinking about it sure isn't going to make you feel any better (and it will certainly help keep you from sleeping).<br>  <br>  Anyway, I hope you're okay and that the doctor is able to find something minor and fixable wrong with you when you go to see her!  Please do a favor and add a little note to this question when you're feeling better and just let the Yahoo! world know what was wrong and that you're alright!<br>  <br>  Best of luck and feel better soon,<br>  <br>  Kal

NU3drLhbaa	There is no way any of the things you said you said to your doctor could get you taken away from your family.  Unless there was evidence that your family directly caused your problems, if that IS the case then maybe separation from your family could actually help you! <br>  <br>  But the idea that your lying to your doctor is pretty dangerous.  You have to understand that in mental conditions a lot of what YOU say is how the doctor makes his/her diagnosis?  By making up things and having your doctor prescribe possibly unnecessary medication you're endangering yourself!<br>  <br>  If you feel like you had no control over lying to your doctor then I would definitely make another appointment and explain that to him/her as best you can.|`|XSEWADI0aa	let it go like your mom said.|`|AA11146632	Yes, you were foolish to exaggerate your problems, but if your doctor thinks you may be a danger to other people, he should find some place of care for you. Unless you actually do harm someone though, your Doctor cannot say anything to anyone else. I wouldn't worry about it too much. Nothing is likely to happen if you leave things alone.|`|224cm8qtaa	why did you lie to him in the first place? What was the point of that?|`|kyTDQEWaaa	Why would a person lie and make stuff up to their own doctor?  Are you sure you weren't being totally honest and now you regret it?   Either way, follow up with the counselor he referred you to.   You sound like you need it, even if you were making all that up.  Calling him back will not accomplish anything now, anyway.  Its out of his hands.|`|sOO93u5Oaa	Well, it is supposed to be kept confidential, but if you may be hurting yourself or others, he may do something about it, I guess.|`|JlHobP4taa	Oh I know.....never lie!!! Ya feel pretty stupid now huh? The doctor has a legal obligation to report anything that he feels might endanger yours or someone else's life or illegal activity. I bet you won't do this again will ya......??|`|drEfr9waaa	He probably has an obligation to report this sort of thing.|`|sxahupRTaa	Doctors and medical professionals can't use what is told to them in confidence unless it puts a person at risk of hurting themselves or someone else. The HIPPA act or the Health insurance portability and accountablity act of '96 prevents medical professionals from discussing patients personal buisness with other people. However, since you were "messing" with your doctor I think you may have forced your doctors hand as he may have thought you were an "at risk" individual. What you should do is be honest about what happened. Explain what you did and give your reasons for it. Even if they sound silly. Remember honesty is always the best policy.

5199590581461415ae6730eb96632b94aa	Als Warnsignal vor Gefahren ist Angst lebensnotwendig. überm??ige ?ngstlichkeit kann aber auch krank machen. Wie aber entsteht Angst? Was entscheidet darüber, ob jemand sein Leben als Hasenfu? oder Draufg?nger fristet? Bei der Suche nach den Ursachen der Furcht machten US-Forscher ein Gen ausfindig, das scheinbar unser Verhalten in be?ngstigenden Situationen mitbestimmt. Das Team um Daniel Weinberger vom "National Institute of Mental Health" in Bethesda (Maryland) untersuchte den Einfluss des Gens auf eine bestimmte Gehirnstruktur. Diese Amygdala oder Mandelkern genannte Region ist als Schaltzentrale der Angst bekannt. Das Gen, das die Wissenschaftler unter die Lupe nahmen, ist an der Signalübertragung zwischen Nervenzellen beteiligt. Beim Menschen existiert es in zwei Versionen, einmal ist der Genabschnitt etwas l?nger, einmal etwas kürzer. Dass das Gen mit Angstreaktionen zusammenh?ngt, wussten die Wissenschaftler bereits aus früheren Untersuchungen. Diese hatten gezeigt, dass Menschen mit der kürzeren Variante geringfügig ?ngstlicher sind als solche mit der langen. Um den Einfluss des Gens auf die Amygdala zu untersuchen, bestimmten die Forscher zun?chst die Genvariante ihrer Versuchspersonen, berichtet "Science" (Bd.297, S.400). Dann zeigten sie den Probanden Bilder, auf denen ver?ngstigte Personen zu sehen waren. Emotionale Reize dieser Art stimulieren die Amygdala. W?hrend die Probanden die Bilder betrachteten, zeichneten die Wissenschaftler die Aktivit?t des Mandelkerns auf. Die Messungen der Gehirnstr?me ergaben, dass Probanden mit der kurzen Genvariante, die vermeintlich ?ngstlicheren Menschen, mit einer st?rkeren Aktivit?t der Amygdala auf die emotionalen Bilder reagierten. Das "Angst-Gen" scheint also die Aktivit?t der "Angstzentrale" Amygdala zu beeinflussen und somit die Empfindung von Furcht zu steuern. Folgender Mechanismus k?nnte hinter der "genetischen Angststeuerung" stecken. Nervenzellen "sprechen" miteinander, indem sie Botenstoffe wie zum Beispiel Serotonin ausschütten. Das fragliche Gen bildet nun ein Protein, welches das Serotonin nach "Gespr?chsende" wieder in die Zellen zurück pumpt. Je nachdem, welche Genvariante vorliegt, wird mehr oder weniger von dem Protein gebildet und folglich auch mehr oder weniger Botenstoff in die Zellen zurück geschleust. Bei Menschen mit der kurzen Genvariante führe m?glicherweise der schlechtere Serotonin-Abtransport zu einem Serotonin-überschuss und dieser zu einer überaktivierung der Amygdala. "Die Amygdala kennzeichnet eingehende Informationen als gef?hrlich", erl?utert Weinberger. Es sei denkbar, dass Menschen mit einer durch den erh?hten Serotoninspiegel hyperaktiven Amygdala auch in nicht-bedrohlichen Situationen Angst empfinden. Ein kleiner genetischer Unterschied scheint also zu beeinflussen, wie Menschen auf ihre Umwelt reagieren. Die Untersuchung schlie?e die Kausalkette von einer Genvariante hin zu einem komplexen Verhalten, urteilt Mitautor David Goldmann vom "National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism". Lückenlos sei allerdings noch nicht bewiesen, dass die erh?hte Aktivit?t der Amygdala wirklich auf den geringeren Serotonin-Abtransport zurückzuführen sei, schr?nken die Wissenschaftler ein. Angst sei zudem ein sehr komplexes Verhalten und nicht durch ein einziges Gen oder einen Umwelteinfluss erkl?rbar. Auch Einflüsse in der Kindheit beeinflussten entscheidend das Temperament. Die Amygdala ist zudem nicht allein für die Steuerung von Furcht zust?ndig, auch andere Regionen des Gehirns spielen eine Rolle. Eine im Fachblatt "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences" ver?ffentlichte Untersuchung norwegischer Wissenschaftler belegt, dass auch der Hippocampus an der Verarbeitung von Angst beteiligt ist. Die Forscher um Kirsten Kjelstrup von der Universit?t Bergen hatten bei Ratten verschiedene Bereiche dieser Hirnregion gezielt zerst?rt. Die Tiere, bei denen die Wissenschaftler den vorderen Teil des Hippocampus besch?digt hatten, reagierten in bedrohlichen Situationen weniger ?ngstlich als ihre Artgenossen. Der Hippocampus k?nne also Angst-Verhalten unter Umgehung der Amygdala beeinflussen|`|85433fe20af4fc570c7c4949b87abd8caa	Schau Dir blo? die vielen "Daumen-runter" in den o.a. Antworten an.

Ich m?chte da anknüpfen.<br>  <br>  Es geht dir bei deiner Frage wahrscheinlich nicht nur um die normale Angst (Ein Tiger bricht aus, du rennst weg. Jemand ruft dich an und droht, dich umzubringen). <br>  <br>  Spannender sind andere Arten von ?ngsten, beispielsweise: Du sollst vor vielen Leuten eine Rede halten und hast davor Angst. Da kann man sich mit Recht fragen, wieso eigentlich? Dein Leben ist nicht in Gefahr. Keiner will dich bei?en. Schlimmstenfalls lacht jemand, aber wahrscheinlich wirst du, selbst wenn du fast alles verpatzt, mit Sympathie bedacht. Und dennoch diese irrationale Angst!<br>  <br>  Dies ist die Angst, vor Zeugen zu versagen. Es ist die Angst vor einer peinlichen Situation. Und merkwürdigerweise gelingt eine solche Rede denen, die unbekümmert und angstfrei sind, oft besser als denen, die vor Lampenfieber fast sterben.<br>  <br>  Als Hilfe hierfür würde ich raten: Gut vorbereitet sein, und dann tief durchatmen. Es lohnt sich auch, sich das Worst-Case-Scenario gedanklich vorher durchzuspielen: Was kann mir eigentlich schlimmstenfalls passieren? Nicht viel! Also traue ich mich! Hinterher atme ich auf und bin stolz, und beim n?chsten Mal habe ich schon ein bisschen Routine.<br>  <br>  Schlimmer sind zwanghafte ?ngste, zum Beispiel die Angst, das H?ndewaschen zu vergessen, woraus dann der Waschzwang entsteht. Die Angst, nicht mager genug zu sein, woraus dann Bulimie entsteht. Hier hilft ein guter Rat nicht weiter, hier ist eine Therapie angesagt, und zwar dringend.<br>  <br>  Es gibt auch Verlust?ngste. Du hast Angst, deinen Freund zu verlieren. Deshalb stimmst du manchem zu, was du eigentlich nicht tun willst, und sagst zu allem Ja, nur aus Angst, ihn zu verlieren. Diese Verlust?ngste muss man überwinden. Sie waren gut und sinnvoll in der Kindheit. Denn wenn ein Kind seine Eltern verliert, ist es aufgeschmissen. Aber wenn du erwachsen bist, musst du das hinter dir lassen und souver?n werden.<br>  <br>  Ein Motto:<br>  Der Mutige kennt die Angst, aber überwindet sie.<br>  <br>  In diesem Sinne wünsche ich dir alles Gute.|`|rFiLrGWSaa	Na weil es Terroristen gibt.|`|18f79fd6f8483c4a5b0eeeb771de8482aa	Falsche Frage, wieso hast du Angst vor dem Leben.

Men can get yeast infections in the intestines too.  There are various ways to treat it.  You can take garlic pills, up to 8 a day.  Most of the time you can get them odor free so you don't have to worry about smelling like garlic.   Yeast infections cause you to crave sugar and that is what the yeast wants.  Yogurt is a good thing for this too.  If you are itching a lot, it's possible you have it.  If you are like breaking out in your face when you eat sugar (that's what happens to me sometimes), or you get bowel problems like diarrhea if you eat more than a normal amount of sugar one day, the next day you are sick.|`|MhpccWpmaa	It is when a woman's body over-produces the natural yeast that we have in our vagina's.

rUsFKFQ8aa	wear a scarf, high necked tops, high collared shirts... etc<br>  toothpaste is also supposed to help but i dont know if this is just a myth and very much doubt can get rid of it quickly!<br>  otherwise plenty of concealer but you will pretty much have to do your whole neck to blend it in and constantly check its still stuck!<br>  xx|`|dK6YGyNyaa	You can cover it with foundation, or wear a thin lacey neck scarf (or both). Don't wear a full winter scarf though or it will look obvious. Go for a light layer of foundation, then drape a decorative scarf around your neck just to draw attention away from it.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	You can not. You could try to cover it with make up or wear a high necked top|`|AA11103493	The only thing you can do is try to cover it up with make up or clothes.<br>  <br>  When I was a kid people said toothpaste made it fade but I'm sure that's pants.

MHg9JhEKaa	I have had this before (when switching pills, although it wasn't Microlite) It's just dried blood mixed with discharge. (sorry tmi!) <br>  <br>  It's just the effects of new pill, try not to worry it's normal. It will settle within 3 months. You won't have this kind of discharge for that long, but it may be on and off until your body has got used to the Microlite.|`|ZbMLigR3aa	Hon, this is something you really need to address with the doctor who prescribed the microlite to you.  The discharge you are experiencing can be a result of the switch but only your doctor will know for sure.  I hope everything turns out well...Good luck!|`|j45Q2ipRaa	This could be a slight break-through as the color discribes is minimal blood and normal discharge, but only your doctor can tell you for sure.  Give him a call.  They could probably answer this without a visit.|`|AA11037376	That doesnt sound normal, go to see your doctor.|`|RnGlzo4Raa	get it checked out! i didn't have that at all mine was a usual colour discharge|`|aV2VS9NYaa	you should go see a doctor. fast. you could be dying! but not really.

If Im not mistaken anything below the normal level will make you anemic|`|uGFzzLYWaa	Yeah, you're low. <br>  I used to take iron pills, but they had some undesirable side effects that interfered with my life.<br>  Beets are a good source of iron. Spinach and other dark leafy vegetables can help boost it up. I also take folic acid which helps my anemia, and doesn't rip my stomach to shreds.<br>  <br>  You can always take a generic multi-vitamin, or even those Flintstones vitamins.|`|9yky3Q9saa	Something that's yummy that isn't hard on your stomach is....watermelon!! I incorporated a lot of it into my diet when I was seven or eight and also "slightly anemic." Went away quickly, if memory serves.

f8mLpPXlaa	It's considered a good idea to take penicillin with a chest cold because if it's viral you'll be covered for opportunistic bacterial infections. And if it's bacterial it probably will help that too. Although it's best to check with your doctor as to which antibiotic he/she recommends. They need to prescribe it anyway.|`|hDOBfBZeaa	Nope, penicillin is an antibiotic - that is, its for a bacterial infection. So unless you have some type of bacterial infection it won't help. It may in fact just make things more complicated because you'll build a tolerance to antibiotics and if and when you do get an infection it will make antibiotics useless. There is no cure for the common cold, cold medicines just treat the symptoms. Best thing to do is to go see a Doctor and get plenty of rest and fluids.|`|gNBO8M71aa	There are over 300 microorganisms that cause the "common cold". Penicillin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, so if your cause is bacteria, then there's a chance it could help. BUT.. viruses are an even larger cause of cold/flu, in which case, an antibiotic will do NOTHING. And you shouldn't take antibiotics if you don't desperately need them. You could end up having antibiotic-resistance problems in the future and then they won't work when you REALLY need them to.
yHHdAMnQaa	Your mother needs some serious help. get her some help before anything gets worse. she is physically abusing you for sure.. call social services if things get worse, you need to get out of that house.|`|IKakoOfyaa	Your mother definitely has issues and needs help.  You could probably benefit from counseling as well to help you deal with her issues.  Otherwise, you may find yourself suffering from the same types of problems when you become an adult and have children of your own.|`|dXAgTUSraa	YOu poor thing, I understand what your talking about, I was done similarlly when I was young and I now am 32 and have 3 kids, and sometimes I catch myself acting like my dad or stepmom and my stomach turns, I will hardly ever whoop my kids, even though they need it, but i am so nervous of doin to them what was done to me, so anyway what I am saying you see this now, please get some help for your family before something really bad happens. These things are just cruel and no its not normal. Good luck.
5vFGO57Kaa	If you've tried Neutrogena and it makes your skin red and sore, then stop using it.  It must contain something that irritates your skin.<br>  <br>  Best thing to do is use nothing for the time being.  Wash with warm water then moisturise using something like E45 cream.  I used to obssess about my skin and felt like it wasn't cleansed unless I used a product on it.  For the last 5 years i have used just water and E45 cream and my skin has never been better.  If you really feel like you have to wash with something, use acqueous cream which will cleanse and soothe at the same time.<br>  <br>  Make sure you eat a healthy and balanced diet and drink lots of water.  To help nourish the skin maybe you should take some Vitamin E tablets, better still, take a multi vitamin and mineral tablet.<br>  <br>  The dark circles could be caused by blocked sinuses or problems related to ear/nose/throat - do you suffer with any of these?<br>  <br>  xx|`|05SbMDA6aa	If you have white spots under your eyes then the chances are that your body is processing toxins. A few early nights, plenty of water and a good diet will work wonders!|`|8UgzQ2Q4aa	i agree, you do not have to use a product on your skin. neutrogena hurt the crap out of my skin as well, i say its the salycilic acid that makes it that way... also, do not use clean and clear or weird stuff with microbeads in it... huge breakouts the next day... water and ivory bar soap does the job for me... you can also go to like jc pennys and get this product called medi-morphosis, (if your jc pennys has a beauty department) but his product is absolutely amazing!! my mom is 47 and they put a little dab on her hand an she looked 30 again, it got rid of all the dead skin and irritation and redness in an instant.. that might work on your face as well... like mom always said, read the ingredients and dont buy anything that has things in it you cant pronounce!!|`|iuO9p67xaa	believe it or not it is down to what you eat , you mst likely have an unhealthy diet which makes your skin unable to replenish itself and also most creams dry out the skin as they ae not natural use coconut oil it works a treat as it it natural and has nothing added i mean just look at the ingredients on the product you use i count the chemicals human skin wasn't made to with stand chemicals so my advice is use coconut oil and eat healthy have lots of fruit and veg and avoid sugar.|`|7JDA7m7Laa	for dry skin I found that the best thing that you will see immediate results & keep seeing results is the neutrogena WAVE. Its this thing that vibrates & has foaming pads that connect to it. The first day I used it, i noticed a difference. It took maybe 3 times of using it, for my face to be completely soft. Good Luck!|`|ZZb7zlEEaa	The White spots under your eyes are called milia... they are cells that have fat trapped in them.. Can be caused by using a product that is to rich(to much fat/oil in it) To prevent more do not use any oil based cream around your eye area. They may disappear over time, but a trip to a Skin therapist would help you decide on any treatment if any. Drink water to help detox your body...

Je vais te répondre sur ce que je sais.<br>  Dans le même cas que toi, c-à-d seule. <br>  <br>  Je me suis rendue à la clinique avec le bus. On m'a attribué une chambre particulière, que je n'ai pratiquement pas occupée, puisque j'ai rejoint le bloc vers 9 H .  et repartie en taxi pris en charge par la sécu, mais comme il y a une dizaine d'années, je ne me souviens plus si ce taxi commandé par la clinique, a été payé par mes soins ou si la clinique m'a délivré un bon de taxi; auquel cas les frais auraient été compris dans sa facture. <br>  L'opération s'est faite en chirurgie ambulatoire, sans hospitalisation réelle.<br>  <br>  Alors chambre particulière, téléphone etc ... on n'en n'a guère besoin, ?a permet simplement de gonfler la facture.<br>  <br>  Maintenant si tu habites trop loin de l'h?pital, il faudra peut-être y passer la nuit avant l'opération.<br>  <br>  Sur l'opération elle-même, pour moi : 100% de réussite. Cela s'est passé à Angoulème avec un ophtalmo dont la réputation n'était plus à faire. <br>  <br>  Avec ce que tu dis, je me demande dans quelle sorte d'hopital tu est tombée. C'est pénible d'être rabroué de cette fa?on. S'il te reste encore du temps avant l'opération, essaie<br>  d'avoir le Directeur et n'hésite pas à lui dire comment tu as été traitée.

cZeiKeg3aa	Yes, there is such product you want. Surprisingly, all the oil-free oil control moisturizers simply DON'T work for severely oily skin. The only thing that works on oil is OIL. So, there is this product that CURES oily skin, and leaves you matte complection for the whole day without checking your oil spots. It is Dr. Hauschka Normalizing Day Oil. It STOPS your oil glands to overproduce oil. I know it's strange to put oil on oily skin, but it amazingly de-oils it. It absorbs so quickly that in a second you will forget you just put oil on your face. It treats acne, too. I cured my excessively oily skin only by this product, since nothing else worked (I even tried laser treatments and professional and prescription products). There is also another brand that makes similar treatment oil, but that one I didn't use so I don't know. It's also supposed to be effective. It's Decleor Ylang Ylang purifying essence. So, no matter what brand you use, it should be OIL (water based product simply don't work). But don't use oily creams that are made for dry skin - use transparent oil (such as the ones I recommended), and your pores will not be clogged as with oily creams.|`|IMmtmERraa	well the reason you get so much oil is because your ph is not balanced try using a matenance line like Skintelligence. but if your gettin a lot of acne like i do then id tell to get Timeless Prescription 3 step acne this is made for oily skin. you can check both out at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.marketamerica.com/tkshopintl" rel="nofollow">http://www.marketamerica.com/tkshopintl</a>

Also, you probably are masturbating more often, and it takes a while for your body to replace the hormones you use up when you have an orgasm.  Don't worry about it.  I doubt that there is any direct connection between food and sexual arousal (the movie "Tom Jones" to the contrary).|`|u9I9jjF5aa	Probably Horomones, maybe combined with a food fetish.

I suggest you call your doctor immediately, explain to them your symptoms and make an appointment to get a fasting blood test as soon as possible. Write down anything that you think of as far as how you are feeling in addition to what you wrote in your question so that you will not forget to discuss these things with your doctor. In the meantime, try to keep a healthy well balanced diet, avoiding a lot of sugars and fats.

Z8d9ipxmaa	My mum's been in the same position as you with a dentist. The dentist messed up my mum's filling, she couldn't remove an old filling in order to put a new one in. So she just left it, put a new filling over it (which was a total mess) and told my mum: 'It's fine, it'll mold to your mouth' or some rubbish like that. <br>  <br>  My mum just got rid of this dentist, then got our current one, who sorted her filling for her.

geLcnwu9aa	What absorbency rating are the tampons you're using? How many have you went through in what timeframe? <br>  <br>  Regardless, going through two an hour is not normal. You need to contact a physician or OB/GYN as soon as possible, especially if you develop other symptoms such as dizziness, fever, or painful abdominal cramping. <br>  <br>  This could be due to the Depo; however, in a situation with this kind of blood loss, other causes need to be ruled out and your condition needs to be monitored for any changes. Always better safe than sorry.|`|As1aOK96aa	First of all how long have you been bleeding like that? If it continues for a long period you should see a doctor quickly! Don't be afraid it could very well be the depo you were on. I did the very same thing when i came off of it. It made me have a very irregular period for months after. But everyone is different.
Z2YgGifCaa	I am no doctor, but I would suggest seeing one as soon as possible just to be on the safe side because there are many possibilities as to what this could be.<br>  <br>  First, it could be a side effect of your going off the depo shot, and your body is simply trying to readjust.<br>  <br>  Second, you may have had a cyst rupture, as I have this problem quit often and it's followed by heaving bleeding, blood clots, etc.<br>  <br>  However, in my opinion, I doubt it is a miscarriage because I had one myself several years ago and there is no mistaking that pain as it is extremely severe and you get the urge to want to go to the bathroom because it is premature labor pains and your body is going to want to push it out. So I personally would rule out that possibility.<br>  <br>  But as I said before, I would get in to see a doctor as soon as possible just to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and GOOD LUCK!|`|RNhx7TH9aa	maybe its a miscarrige or something else really serius i suggest u c a private docter right away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If it is because you are ashamed and don't want to go to others for help, I think you have tapped into one of the reasons why you drink in the first place. You have problems and troubles and instead of letting others help you with them, you self-medicate by drinking so you can forget them. Quitting something you are addicted to is something that not many people can do by themselves. If you truly want to quit, you would have done it by now or you would just decide to quit cold turkey. But since that obviously doesn't sound appealing to you, I suggest you go for help. I know a ton of people who have gone to AA and there is a reason it is so popular: because it works! <br>  <br>  It is also good if your boyfriend quits, but you can't rely on him to be your partner in this or to help you.

Just think there are a lot of girls that would love to have that problem.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider learning to sew a little if you don't already and you could tailor things just for you and find exactly what you want.<br>  <br>  Just remember the size of the clothes doesn't really matter, so what if a top is a size bigger, you are still the same little you :)|`|a984cQjKaa	yup i'm an extra large on top, but a medium on the bottom.  if i try to get button down shirts, the large is too small in the boobs but fits everywhere else and if i get an extra large it fits in the boobs but is loose everwhere else!  if these damn boobs don't shrink with some exercise, i'm getting a reduction.|`|NEWbh3Plaa	Nope, wish I did though!|`|LcK7wKJcaa	i did i was a size 4 with dd it was annoying but i was never going to do anything about it (not a fan of surgery) however, my back could not handle it.  I was in the chiropractor all the time getting adjustments to my lower back because it would just go out.  He finally suggested a consult.  Of course I did not do it.  After about 5 yrs of constant back pain and problems my chiropractor told me I was really messing up my back and it would be a lifelong battle. I had the reduction just to a c cup and it made a world of difference.  I still have some back problems here and there (from letting it go so long) but for the most part clothes shopping was much easier and so was life in general...plus I just look better, I'm in proportion now.  The recovery was really not that bad and it made me feel a lot better. HOpe this helps|`|9mISx1EEaa	i sorta know how you feel but my problem is the exact opposite mine are too small. im a size 16 and the shirts i have NEVER fit me right cuz i mine are too small.

U11kob2iaa	I've struggled with my weight when I was younger and while I did eventually slim down and keeping tabs on it, I do understand how hard it can be. Now I know I'm going to recieve alot of heat on this advice, but look up clenbuterol. While it has a horrible stigma (because it's not FDA approved; based solely on the fact it stays in the body too long; long half life) it works wonders. Great thing about it is you can tailor it to your own body. i.e. start out small and gradually take higher doses till you get to a point where there are no side affects. Once again look it up and you can find it from European companies online (there its legal).|`|SwP3tE2Uaa	I had the same problem as you for twenty years although I was just overweight at 130lbs.  The only exercise I like is walking.<br>  <br>  I have been through many diets and two slimming pills.  Most didn't work and for those that did, the weight loss didn't stay.<br>  <br>  The idea to permanent weight loss is to eat  a diet that you like and can stay on for life, and do an exercise that you like and will do for life.<br>  <br>  I am now on low carb, low fat, high fibre, high protein.  I enjoy eating lots of veggies and lean meat.  I learned to eat complex carbs and grains.  I reduce my simple carbs. And I brisk walk an hour 5 times a week.  Finally losing weight was easy and I lost 31 lbs.  I am now 108lbs and very healthy.<br>  <br>  More in my blog<br>  Xiaozhen<br>  <a href="http://lowcarblowfathighfibrehighprotein.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://lowcarblowfathighfibrehighprotein...</a>|`|LI0weZiGaa	There are not easy ways out which will keep you in shape.<br>  <br>  IMPROVE YOUR LIFESTYLE<br>  <br>  The only way to LOSE FAT and STAY SLIM is to CONSTANTLY exercise and ALWAYS have a good balanced diet. <br>  <br>  You should do intense cardio work outs at least 4 times for 1 1/2 hours a week to loose weight.<br>  <br>  Eat well and be calorie conscious. An example of what you should do, what I do to have a healthy meal.<br>  <br>  *Eat around 5 SMALL meals a day to prevent snacking on those high calorie sweets. <br>  *Always eat a serving of vegetables BEFORE eating the mains and drink a glass of water. This fills you up with low fattening food so you wont be tempted to overeat/eat as much of the fatty other foods.<br>  *The best two foods to eat would be FISH and CHICKEN<br>  * Cheese is just a nice name for FAT so stay away from it<br>  <br>  etc.
AA11263340	One side effect of many ADD medications is weight loss. I know some children who have lost up to 6 pounds in around 2 weeks.<br>  <br>  If you are considering taking this medication specifically for weight loss, I would advise against it.

Google it and read up if you are considering it.|`|3gGwX5Cbaa	well it is methamphetamine which can cause you to lose your appetite. ive known people who lost weight on it but they were abusing it. i think if you are taking it correctly it shouldn't effect your weight very drastically. you may lose a few pounds or 15 pounds. all drugs effect everyone differently. im also not a doctor. you should look it up somewhere more credible.

The problem with birth control pills (and the reason why my wife refuses to take them) is that the way it controls your menstrual cycle is by adjusting hormone levels in your body. Odds are that by skipping your period for so long your hormone levels are now so out of whack that they are going to take some tome to return to normal. I wouldn't suggest going to the same doctor who recommended that you skip your period in the first place. That was horrible advice.|`|RNhx7TH9aa	helo u are a woman u sound like u are in adult stage because u are married well use the senses god gave u i would not be wasting my time coming on the internet i would be heading to a docter i have been c in my period for a month and i have not seen a docter a would be a fool not going to the docter but it seems u like having your period must be !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|p1gzHgAraa	this is a question for your ob/gyn doctor- you need to go see them.

yHHdAMnQaa	No, do not self medicate your husband, When did he start feeling sad? Is it more then 6 hours a day? and for how long? He has symptoms of depression... bring him to see a psychiatrist...|`|toNoWj3Kaa	Wow. Thats kind of an unenlightened view of medication. Its come a long way from valium that turns you into a zombie. For many, it actually enables people to get on with their lives. I know it did for me.|`|drEfr9waaa	A doctor should be able to assist and to refer your husband to a psychiatrist if need be.|`|LU7yg6Ejaa	take him to the dr..thats all you can do|`|qVZklYNPaa	Either make an appointment with a psychiatrist, or call the nearest hospital that has psychiatric services and get him an appointment as an emergency. He shouldn't be concerned about being admitted, as that would be his choice. The physician will talk with him, diagnose his condition, and prescribe medication to begin recovery. He will be given follow-up appointments, and the medication will be increased or changed according to your husband's view of whether or not he is feeling better. Eventually, he may want to consult a psychologist-his choice-to talk about "things" until the medication really "kicks in". This will save his life. No one should have to live in the bleak world of depression. I do hope you were using humor to cover up your true concern for your husband. Depression is an illness, not a game; just like diabetes is an illness. It requires treatment. Help him. Please. Oh, by the way, I doubt whether an anti-psychotic will be the first choice for treatment.|`|zQt7y0vhaa	wow i hope ur kidding bout that suggestion. deff don knock hime out and medicate him. be there for him. there may be something making him depressed. if its seems like chronic depression then take him (not send him on his own) to sign up for therapy so he can get the proper medication and diagnosis.|`|jr3unppAaa	knock him out? i hope that's a joke. convince your husband to see a doctor or therapist that he can talk to, or get medication from. if that's not an option, try to make life comfortable for him at home.reduce any stresses.|`|bdzG1VEDaa	From the way you're talking about this it must be a joke right?! <br>  Well its not that funny actually, my boyfriend is diagnosed with depression and its hard to deal with it at times but i love him and support him.|`|q1R8BDrnaa	Take him to the Doctor! There is clearly something a doctor will be able to do, suggest or prescribe for him to help him feel better!<br>  <br>  You just need to be there for him. Reassure him.|`|sqnvZmSkaa	do something before he kills himself|`|KzHANhZraa	**** him|`|Ap8tyiUlaa	Take him to a doctor so he can get refered to a phyciatrist (spelling?)|`|kTRcYaFcaa	The VERY FIRST thing you should do Judy B is to get him to see his doctor - make sure that what he has in indeed depression i.e. anxiety disorder.<br>  <br>  By the way, I suffered for 13 years and make the huge mistake of NOT seeking help - it's the male MACHO thing - or male stupidity others will say.<br>  <br>  What I learned is two things - and check out the site below for more information - it has been my saviour.<br>  <br>  Firstly, medication can only ever treat the symptoms. People will feel better, will be able to cope etc, but the cause, unless treated as well, will remain.<br>  <br>  So Secondly, You must help him find the ROOT CAUSE and help him to eradicate that. It is not simple, but neither is it difficult and there are many techniques one can learn and adopt into one's lifestyle which will both get rid of the disorder and also, most importantly, ensure it never returns.<br>  <br>  So no matter what he does, he MUST find and then eradicate that root cause and I believe that nobody can do that on their own, which is where that site kicked in for me.<br>  <br>  He needs help, he will be hating himself at present and this journey is not going to be easy - neither for you nor for him.<br>  <br>  But the best thing he has going for him is obviously you - and to him that will be H U G E.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, and remember, ROOT CAUSE must be identiifed before any cure can be effected.

AA10723498	I can't believe someone else has this.  I am exactly the same way and it all manifested itself after my gallbladder was removed.  She need to see a Gastroenterologist.  That's so important. My problem was with my pancreas.  If I ate anything spicy, I too bloated  and looked pregnant.  Her Dr. sounds like an idiot.  The pain is awful when I get an attack.  One thing, it is not life threatening.  A Gastroenterologist will scope her.  She will be put to sleep and he will insert a tube down her throat to see what's going on.  I'm not saying she has a pancreas problem, but everything you said is exactly what I feel.    The most important thing for your mother to do is make an appt with the specialist.  I can't stress that enough.  You are a great daughter.  Very caring and concerned.  I take a lot of meds because my entire digestive system if affected. What I do when I get bloated is put a warm hot water bottle on my abdomen.  It feels so soothing.  I certainly know how she feels.  Arthritis has nothing to do with the bloating.  I had a knee replacement.  So I strongly advise her to see the specialist.  If anyone can help her, it him/her.  It really gets me angry when a Dr. won't prescribe something for the pain.  What does he care, he's not feeling the pain.  I wish there was a device that you could put a probe on a Dr.in the same area the patient feels pain and one on the patient.  That way, he could feel just what your mother is feeling.  So please, call for her or have her call.  It's the only way you will get any answers and the Dr. will prescribe something for pain.  Tell your mother that I certainly know what she's going through.  You are both in my prayers.  Be blessed<br>  ps, if you e-mail me, I can give you a lot more details.  I wish I could speak to your mother.  If you mail me, make sure you specify what's it's about otherwise, I will delete if I don't recognize who you are.  GPs are great, but they don't specialize that's why your mother should see a Dr. who's specialty is the digestive system.|`|6a054048746da7edf01f4a2e7fa8cac0aa	has she been checked for diabetes?|`|9D3LBCtBaa	Sounds like a pretty stressful time for you guys at the moment.  with regards to the x-ray, you could take it back to where you had it done and ask to speak with the radiologist as your GP has said there is something on there but wouldn't elaborate and you are wondering whether this is something that should be dealt with urgently or not.  <br>  <br>  The size of your mum's tummy could mean a number of things and I don't want to alarm you - colon cancer can cause many of the things you are describing and would fit with her feeling fatigued and the changes in the bowel habit.  It could be something like Crohn's diseae or ulcerative colitis which causes the pain and changes in the bowel but wouldn't explain the spleen issue.  The spleen tends to enlarge if there is something inflammatory going on.<br>  <br>  I would strongly suggest you seek a second opinion for your mum, many people are reluctant to change doctors as they think of them as a god, especially those who are on the older side.  My mum in law ended up with bowel cancer because noone really listened to her as she whinged a lot and Dr's dismissed her so if you feel that her doctor is not doing the right thing for her - move on.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|dXAgTUSraa	Well honestly with her stomach looking so big you may want to have her triglycerides (im sure i spelt wrong) checked that is something to have to do with sugar. My brother in law was having pain  and then he did the same thing belly got the same way and his triglycerides were almost at stroke level, he was admitted in hospital for bout 1 1/2 week to 2 weeks, but he found out he was full blown diabetic. You may want them to run the test (bloodwork) to check specifically for triglyceride level. Good luck Please let know how turns out.

When you go to the store to purchase one, look at the packaging; it'll give you a sizing chart telling you what size is appropriate for particular heights.|`|L0Gnd8e5aa	Get the big one, it's best for your core, and you can do exercises to stretch out your back, and it's fun for the kids.|`|XwrxiKfBaa	You wouldn't want to go smaller than the 65 one. But I think if you are over a certain height then you need the biggest one which is 75. Sometimes starting out with the biggest one is better cause it provides more stability.

K1WkdUtvaa	If you've had a normal smear you should have nothing to worry about. It's probably due to hormonal changes during the month and the effects of the pill, I've experienced this from time to time over the years myself. Our hormones can alter from month to month sometimes and you might experience this for a while and then it will stop for no reason. I would advise that if this discharge is smelly or you have any unusual vaginal irritation or pain then see your GP to rule out infection maybe, although as it isn't happening right through the month it's highly unlikely. If it continues and you are worried then see your Doctor or Family planning clinic anyway to put your mind at rest although I'm sure there's nothing to worry about. All the best Clara.|`|TSsT8QGgaa	brown blood = old left over blood.  completely normal,,,i get it alot with my cycle,,,sometimes it is the ONLY "period" i get.  id say you are fine and your body is just cleaning itself as it is made to do.  brown blood is just the left over from your last cycle|`|T0KHIFgaaa	it's just blood, don't worry.|`|9OyIL8P9aa	This is normal. The brown discharge that you got is called "old blood".  Why this happens is because when we get a period that is because of body is flushing out the old lining of the uterus and the eggs. And sometimes it does not all come out when it is suppose to. And that is where the brown blood comes in. <br>  Most women get it before their next period because the body is prepping for the new cycle to start. <br>  This is normal.<br>  I hope that you found this helpful.|`|mic9KYaOaa	thats mean your period is going to finish :)<br>  x
l6rSKl46aa	i get it all the time but my whole mouth dries and i get some nasty boogies in the morning. remember that this is caused by the air ventilation so the room might be too cold or too hot for sleeping conditions although they may seem alright when you are awake. do you sleep with the window open or have the heating on with the bed near the radiator or heater? little things like that cause me to get a dry mouth<br>  <br>  oh yeah, my friend is also having a baby within the next two weeks so yay! gonna be a god father....again|`|TSsT8QGgaa	i get it as i am an "open mouth " sleeper,,,,as a child i had horrible allergies and would sleep with my mouth open so i could breathe.  best advice is to get a  humidifier to put added moisture in the air while  you are in bed  nothing is wrong with you,,,do you have a cold? allergies? stuffy nose,,,your body may be using your mouth to breathe as your nose is stuffy.  <br>  best bet get a humidifier|`|AA11146632	This is usually caused by sleeping with your mouth open.  However if you cannot sleep with your mouth closed, then ask your pharmacist for a decongestant to help you breathe through your nose.<br>  There are other things you can use, like a strip if elastoplast like material placed over your nose at night, which will pull your nasal passages a little wider.<br>  The only other reason for a dry mouth is usualy caused by some drugs you may be taking.  Keep some water by your bed so you  can take a sip when your mouth feels dry.|`|bqxzmvLqaa	I don't know whats wrong but I have a few ideas that might help... sorry if they dont! <br>  <br>  1) Keep a glass of water beside your bed at night.<br>  <br>  2) Well my friend does this as she gets a dry mouth at night... she fills her mouth with water before she goes to sleep and keeps it in her mouth (doesn't swallow) until shes about to drop off to sleep.. which she says stops her from getting a dry mouth.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps xx|`|zekRzvwEaa	there are changes in bloodflow when you sleep.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|F8EnH6JQaa	TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  the first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your boy adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package...THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD<br>  If man made it, don't eat it<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  Walk your dog, or walk a friends dog<br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water.

I wish you the very best.Just try and comfort her.|`|WYaaPmd8aa	Get her to a REAL doctor NOW!|`|PHOyKsmPaa	Swollen face?? That doesn't sound like any virus I have EVER heard of. Did they tell you they had seen this in other patients lately, or were they just guessing? A fever lasting 7 days doesn't seem normal either.  Kids usually have a fever for two or three days, but then it is just a low grade one. If the fevers are over 101-102 consistently, then that is a sign it could be Bacterial. Did they do a blood test to see if it is a bacterial infection? If they didn't do any tests then I would get some done.  I have had an experience  before when I brought in my child to the doc and they said it was just a virus, but I knew better, after a blood test showed it was a bacterial infection.
84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	You are right, the GL is much better because it is based on serving size that is much easier to use and more practical way of dealing with this.  Go to:  www.mendosa.com   You can e-mail him and he can help you.  I think his site also has an explanation and breakdown for what you are looking.<br>  <br>  You also need to realize that you should be getting your calories mostly from fat, not carbs because you need to consider the effects of Leptin hormone on how insulin and glucagon is utilized in the body and Leptin plays a major role in this.  Leptin is a hormone that is secreted by the adipose tissue (primarily stored fat tissue) causing the fat tissue to act like an endocrine gland.<br>  <br>  good luck to you

SkDomhoXaa	it's due to a lack of calcium, here's a little something about calcium that might clear the air:<br>  <br>  <br>  Calcium is the chemical element that is needed for healthy teeth bones, nails and nerves. Calcium chemical symbol Ca plays a very important role in building healthy teeth and bones and nails as well as in our nervous system because it is required for normal communication between nerve cells. It ensures that our muscles contract and that our hearts beat.<br>  <br>  Calcium is the major mineral found in our bones and teeth and along with phosphorus and other nutrients calcium builds the hard structure that makes bones and teeth strong. We also need calcium for proper muscle and nerve function blood clotting and other body processes. A high intake of dietary calcium in childhood is associated with healthy adult bones and dentists and dieticians recommend that children get calcium through a balanced diet. A lack of calcium can lead to brittle fingernails, headaches, irritability, and tooth decay.<br>  <br>  Osteoporosis a condition that causes bones to become brittle and can lead to increased risk of hip and vertebra fractures and spinal deformities leading to the loss of height. Osteoporosis occurs because the lack of calcium causes the body to take calcium from bone leading to the bones becoming weak.<br>  <br>  There are many natural sources of calcium. Dairy foods such as milk cheese and yogurt are the most abundant source of natural dietary calcium. Other good sources of calcium can be found in the various food groups summarized below.<br>  <br>  · Dairy: milk (skim or 1%) low-fat and fat-free yogurts low-.fat and fat-free cheeses<br>  <br>  · Meats/Beans: sardines/salmon with bones calcium-set tofu<br>  <br>  · Fruits/Vegetables: collard greens broccoli calcium-fortified orange juice<br>  <br>  · Grains: pancakes calcium-fortified breads and cereals<br>  <br>  · Combination Foods: cheese pizza (made with reduced-fat cheese) soups prepared with skim milk<br>  <br>  Having plenty of calcium in the diet along with plenty of fruit and vegetables can lower blood pressure as well as some prescription drugs as well as reducing the chance of colon cancer by limiting the irritating effects of bile acid in the colon. Too much calcium in a diet however can lead to problems such as constipation and kidney stones.<br>  <br>  The recommended daily intake of calcium varies from children to adults. For children aged 1-3 the recommended amount of calcium is 500mg/day. This level increases to 800mg/day from ages 4-8 all the way up to 1300mg/day for teenagers. The amount recommended for adults is less than teenagers as the teeth and bones are almost fully formed at this stage of life and is around the 1000mg/day mark. Pregnant woman are advised to ingest 1100mg/day.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lack of calcium produces "little white spots" on your fingernails just like lack of water makes you have diarreah, or lack of vitamin c makes you get sick more often. Your body is telling you through obvious signals that your missing something you need. <br>  <br>  I hope I've helped you! =]|`|wzGSdBHsaa	Fluoride deficiency.|`|yzss8b8xaa	calcium deficiancy  drink lots or milk :D|`|1a195e834f21aad260c9607f401e83c4aa	Lack of calcium|`|6be450ec4f39c3e7ecf34009d4ebe605aa	lack of calcium<br>  got milk?|`|AA11660242	I'm not sure what it means if you have white patches on your nails, but I do remember this; when I was in the elementary school, white patches on your nails meant that someone had a crush on you!

7fc779e36f1c26b1790c0dfad78189fcaa	yes this will help you but you should get resitance bands as well, there are many methods that you can use with it to help gain more muscle, your doing it correct, its best to allow the muscle to gain oxygen to replenish. most people don't understand that. I am a personal fitness trainer and its hard to get people to see that.  your doing a good job keep it up, also a protien supplement is a good idea after any work out. Good luck!|`|WEHjGaVKaa	You want to be doing bench press with weights. Press ups are ok, and will do something, but you will not develop anywhere near as much muscles as if you do bench press.  You need to increase the resistance, which cannot be done simply with bodyweights. <br>  If free weights are unavailable, do things like clap pressups which require a lot of power. Do 3 sets of 8 clap pressups (or as many as you can manage). <br>  The best way is to get into a gym and start a proper weights routine (if you are old enough, weights from too young is detrimental to growth).|`|Qw7Dpm1taa	Most definately, the wider you place your hands apart, the more it focuses on chest & shoulders. The closer your hands the more it focuses on your tricep. I would advise to do 3-4 sets rather than 5 and increase the reps per set. The rest period between each set should be between 30-90 seconds depending on how long you have been them for. Once you find normal pressups are too easy, start doing them off an incline, so put your feet on a box, or some stairs. The higher your legs, the more weight is spread evenly across to top half of your body, this makes the press up harder. Hope this helped.|`|hVNVl6Ujaa	Yes, when you do only ten push ups you don't stress your muscles as much as you would with 100 push ups at once. Also your body will increase its RMR resting metabolic rate when you stress them ( using a weight vest, backpack, or tension bands.)|`|03db39c23e516504aa58a9e80502fe28aa	Yes. such resistance training will help.

K1WkdUtvaa	This could be caused by many things, maybe the medication isn't agreeing with you or it could be something as simple as you getting anxious about the reflux and the problem of knowing what to eat and what not to eat with this condition, it must be very awkward. Maybe as you're constantly changing your diet this is affecting your body and feeling shaky can be a sign of low blood sugar or even something as simple as slight dehydration. If you're feeling bloated this could also be down to what you're eating, maybe food that gives you too much wind or constipation or it can be down to just not eating enough or regularly, small meals and often are usually the best to combat this. If I were you I'd see the GP anyhow and explain to him and maybe he can advise you further about your diet or even arrange for you to see a dietician. There's no need to suffer unnecessarily, that's what he's there for. Well done anyway on losing two stone although I imagine this is not the way you'd have wanted to lose it having to cope with reflux.

itPGB0dXaa	Some measurements or comparisons would have been use full in helping to determine if there is something wrong. As others have stated, its natural for one teste to be *slightly* larger than the other and also hang slightly lower.<br>  <br>  However, since you have stated that one is considerably larger and the other 'appears' to have shrunk you may have a problem. If the teste in question feels soft and seems to have a watery consistency, you may have a hydrocele. Had one myself only weeks ago (still recovering from the op to remove it actually) and had similar symptoms, one considerably larger than the other, hanging a lot lower etc.<br>  <br>  I'm presuming there is no pain involved, or perhaps a mild aching feeling in the teste and that side of the groin? If you are really concerned about the size you should see your doctor. Its not the most ideal thing in the world, but the guy is there to do his job and he should act professionaly. You can always ask to have relative or nurse present during the procedure as well if you feel that uncomfortable about it.|`|E64juLwJaa	Just breathe in and out:this is very normal.<br>  Planets.|`|XmD61yBpaa	do nt worry, it is very common|`|qzpQdJ44aa	one of the testes is actually smaller than the other and one hangs lower as well.  If one of the balls hangs only as far as the crotch, then it means that ball had been stitched to the scrotum for some reason when you were young.<br>  <br>  Even if your doctor is homosexual, it doesn't mean that he'd fancy you or anything like that.  Being gay doesn't mean that the person wants sex with any other male all the time.|`|AA11705909	There was a young man of Devizes<br>  whose balls were of two different sizes.<br>  One was small and weighed nothing at all, <br>  the other was huge and won prizes.|`|uRvwLkIBaa	It's normal.

I think the larger one is the left one.|`|UfisV9bEaa	every one does and one useally hangs lower than the other too.|`|EeTs9DqUaa	It is very common!

h7uxxiZZaa	it sounds like you are allergic to the meds. I would go see a doc asap! it could be deadly. just tell them the side effects u want to they cant put u in a mental hospital for that. but please get into a doc to see what is goin on and you are on way to much of it. you have been od on them. please get help. it could save your life.|`|yHHdAMnQaa	Talk to your psychiatrist zoloft is not working for you.. try lexapro it is much better...|`|6S7sWuLfaa	anti depressants are a crutch that will will ultimately leave you weak and powerless - a slave to the medication as well as to doctors and drug manufacturers who profit off your problems. Free yourself by reclaiming your humanity. Side effects of the drugs are just as you explained and although difficult, will abate in time. Your friends, family, boyfriend - these are what will help you overcome your problems. Don't give up and don't give in.|`|bq7HT1ePaa	Maybe the dr.'s should have sent you to a counselor to try and solve an underlying problem, rather than covering it up with the zoloft.  It would be worth it to talk to a therapist and see if that improves your sitation.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	First, are you seeing your family doctor or a psychiatrist?  If your seeing your family doctor, ask for a referral immediately.  I get so irritated with family doctors who push the drug of the day and think that it's the cure for all mental/emotional issues!  <br>  <br>  Stop taking the Zoloft.  Do not expect the side effects to go away quickly.  It's going to take several days to a week at least.  <br>  <br>  If the crazy thoughts etc get to be too much, go to the ER immediately!  They can give you some medication or get to in with the right doctors much faster.<br>  <br>  A psych is very well educated in exactly what these drugs do and how to administer them properly.  It is well worth the time and expense to see one to have such a serious medication properly monitored.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

gNBO8M71aa	She might have meant that she has a medical condition that CAUSES her to chew ice (like the iron deficiency that you mentioned). As far as I know, there's no condition that REQUIRES you to chew ice. ??|`|5vFGO57Kaa	Chewing ice is really bad for your teeth!  I don't think there's any medical condition which would cause you to do this.|`|7fc779e36f1c26b1790c0dfad78189fcaa	Chewing ice does not hold nutritional value, it sounds more like a habbit, Ice is water and water is good for the body, it does not hold high amounts of iron, (I am a Personal fitness trainer) This seems a bit odd, If she thinks she has iron problems tell her to get checked out and take a vitamin, but ice is not for iron, its for dehydration only!
USoqyjaAaa	You should be immune then and not be potentially incubating the disease yourself.  But keep in mind it can be spread from handling the blister fluid or articles contaminated with it.  So theoretically you could spread it that way- really good handwashing and frequent changes of clothing will help there.  If Pregnant Mom (and the other visitors) have already had chickenpox there shouldn't be a risk to her, but she might want to run it by her doctor.

Then if you find out this is unacceptable, I wouldn't tell the parents, I'd talk with the kids and tell them what you and other neighbors see (yes, lie) and you won't tell their parents as long as they remain decent. <br>  <br>  Then, you won't get them in trouble and you'll earn the trust of those teens - something you want instead of angry teens|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	Ignore.|`|hi1eqrXwaa	i say if it happens again, then you should tell thier parents. otherwise, it was a harmless thing they were doing.|`|3zl6DrjVaa	tell them what you really saw! it's not your fault what you saw them doing|`|Z2YgGifCaa	I personally would say something to the parents because they are children and they shouldn't be behaving that way regardless if their parents are home or not.<br>  <br>  I would simply wait until the children were at school and walk over and tell the parents honestly that you don't know how to put this, but their kids, along with their friends, were in the backyard naked on such-and-such date.<br>  <br>  But do let them know that you are unsure how to handle the problem, and point out that you did not call the police "this time" because you felt it was better addressed by the parents. If it happens again however, I would call the police and get them involved, and I would let the parents know in the nicest way possible that it won't be tolerated. What happens next time when you have company and this happens? It's not sending a good message to anyone and the children need to be set straight as soon as possible, at least in my opinion.|`|jrFBhiGxaa	That is a tough one because they could think that you were staring at them and you could get in trouble but if you dont tell them something bad could happen with the girls i personally would tell them. you don't need to be seeing that and they are way to young to be doing that!! And if you do tell them and they just get angry that is some shitty parenting i think|`|kYHM4Pv8aa	If i were you I would ignore because if you don't say something now and then wait till it gets worse then they might get mad a t you so say something now or nothing at all.|`|hbP3iimAaa	ignore it

D'une part leur teneur en sodium (2 mmol/l) est trop faible pur assurer la compensation des pertes , d'aute part leur hyperosmolarité (750 mmol/l pour le Coca Cola ? ) est largement trop forte et peut aggraver la diarhée par appel osmotique  (cf <a href="http://www.esculape.com/pediatrie/diarrhee_aigue.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.esculape.com/pediatrie/diarrh...</a>   )|`|z0g7luMAaa	COCA COLA est dépassé pour soigner ce mal par le mal...Boire plut?t du BREIZH COLA car au lieu de sentir la mer.., ?à sentira la vase ;)))|`|ca08e0448c5798f6bdeda585a57f5d46aa	pour  se laver  tout  le conduit  digestif|`|cfa9cfe0541ab135a4a35abf91097fd8aa	Au départ, le coca n'était pas une boisson.

qd7C7urwaa	Seis enfermedades causan el 90% de las defunciones por enfermedades infecciosas<br>  <br>  Puntos claves: <br>  <br>  La mayoría de las defunciones están provocadas sólo por un pu?ado de enfermedades..<br>  <br>  La neumonía, la tuberculosis, las enfermedades diarreicas, el paludismo, el sarampión y más recientemente el VIH/SIDA provocan más de la mitad de todas las defunciones prematuras. <br>  <br>  Enfermedades diarreicas <br>  VIH/SIDA <br>  Paludismo <br>   Sarampión <br>  Neumonía <br>  Tuberculosis (TB) <br>   <br>   <br>  La mayoría de las defunciones por enfermedades infecciosas - casi el 90% - están provocadas sólo por un pu?ado de enfermedades. La mayoría de ellas han sido azotes de la humanidad a lo largo de toda su historia, causando con frecuencia estragos en las poblaciones con más eficacia que las guerras. En la edad de las vacunas, los antibióticos y los progresos científicos teatrales, esas enfermedades deberían estar sometidas a control. Sin embargo, en los países en desarrollo siguen causando muertes en la actualidad a un ritmo alarmante. A veces, como los brotes recientes de gripe, provocan también tasas alarmantes de mortalidad en los países industrializados.<br>  <br>  No más de seis enfermedades infecciosas mortales (la neumonía, la tuberculosis, las enfermedades diarreicas, el paludismo, el sarampión y más recientemente el VIH/SIDA) provocan más de la mitad de todas las defunciones prematuras, causando sobre todo la muerte de ni?os y adultos jóvenes.<br>  <br>  Cada tres segundos muere un ni?o, en la mayoría de los casos por una enfermedad infecciosa. En algunos países, uno de cada cinco ni?os fallece antes de cumplir cinco a?os. Cada día mueren de paludismo 3000 personas, tres de las cuales son ni?os. Cada a?o, 1,5 millones de personas fallecen por tuberculosis y otros ocho millones son infectados por primera vez.<br>  <br>  Tras esas defunciones se halla una tragedia humana. Dado que esas enfermedades afectan sobre todo a los ni?os peque?os y los adultos ganadores del sustento, su efecto en las familias puede ser catastrófico. Los ni?os pueden perder al padre, a la madre o a ambos a causa de las enfermedades infecciosas. Por sí sola, la epidemia de SIDA ha dejado huérfanos a más de ocho millones de ni?os. Para empeorar la situación, las familias corren el riesgo de endeudarse por la pérdida de ingresos y por el alto costo de la atención de salud, entrando así en el círculo vicioso de la pobreza y la mala salud.<br>  <br>  Neumonía<br>  Las infecciones respiratorias agudas (IRA) son responsables de numerosas defunciones. La neumonía, la IRA más mortal, provoca la muerte de más ni?os que cualquier otra enfermedad infecciosa. La mayoría de esas defunciones (el 99%) se producen en los países en desarrollo. Sin embargo, en los países industrializados son raras las defunciones infantiles por neumonía.<br>  La neumonía afecta a menudo a los ni?os con insuficiencia ponderal al nacer o a aquéllos con sistemas inmunitarios debilitados por malnutrición u otras enfermedades. Sin tratamiento, la neumonía produce la muerte con rapidez.<br>  El virus gripal es otra causa de neumonía. Se dispone de muy escasa información sobre el número de muertes por gripe en los países en desarrollo. Sin embargo, sólo en los Estados Unidos la enfermedad produce la muerte de 10 000-40 000 personas en una temporada media de gripe.<br>  <br>  VIH/SIDA<br>  En todo el mundo más de 33 millones de personas viven con el VIH/SIDA. Todavía no existe curación a la vista. El áfrica Subsahariana es la parte más afectada. En algunos países, hasta uno de cada cuatro adultos viven ahora con el VIH/SIDA. En Zimbabwe, el 20%-50% de las mujeres embarazadas de algunas zonas están infectadas por el VIH y existe el riesgo de que infecten a sus hijos. Un número creciente de defunciones maternas se deben ahora a infecciones contraídas por mujeres VIH-positivas en el curso del parto. En muchos países, la esperanza de vida y las tasas de supervivencia infantil han caído en picado. En Botswana, la esperanza de vida al nacer ha descendido de 70 a unos 50 a?os.<br>  <br>  Enfermedades diarreicas<br>  Las enfermedades diarreicas provocan la muerte de casi dos millones de ni?os menores de cinco a?os. Están tan extendidas en los países en desarrollo que los padres no reconocen a menudo los signos de peligro. Los ni?os mueren simplemente porque sus organismos están a menudo debilitados por la rápida pérdida de líquidos y subnutridos por la falta de alimentos.<br>  <br>  Las enfermedades diarreicas imponen una pesada carga a los países en desarrollo, produciendo 1500 millones de casos de enfermedad al a?o en los ni?os menores de cinco a?os. La carga alcanza su nivel máximo en las zonas pobres, en donde el saneamiento es escaso, la higiene es insuficiente y el agua de beber no es potable.<br>  En ciertos países en desarrollo, epidemias de enfermedades diarreicas tales como el cólera y la disentería afectan tanto a los adultos como a los ni?os. Entre otras enfermedades diarreicas importantes figuran la fiebre tifoidea y la rotavirosis, que es la principal causa de diarrea deshidratante grave entre los ni?os.<br>  <br>  Tuberculosis (TB)<br>  La tuberculosis, enfermedad que se pensaba ya controlada, ha reaparecido con sed de venganza produciendo 1,5 millones de defunciones al a?o, e incluso más en combinación con el VIH/SIDA. Aproximadamente dos mil millones de personas, la tercera parte de la población mundial, presentan una infección tuberculosa latente. Constituyen en conjunto un enorme reservorio potencial de la enfermedad. La TB produce más muertes de adolescentes y adultos que cualquier otra enfermedad infecciosa. Es también una destacada causa de mortalidad en las mujeres.<br>  <br>  Para empeorar la situación, la infección por el VIH debilita el sistema inmunitario y puede activar la infección por TB latente. También se cree que multiplica el riesgo de infección inicial por TB. Actualmente, la tercera parte aproximadamente de todas las defunciones por SIDA son producidas por la TB.<br>  <br>  Paludismo<br>  El paludismo produce la muerte de más de un millón de personas al a?o, la mayoría de ellas ni?os peque?os. La mayor parte de las defunciones por paludismo se producen en el áfrica Subsahariana, en donde el paludismo provoca una de cada cinco defunciones infantiles. Las mujeres son especialmente vulnerables en el curso del embarazo. Es más probable que mueran por la enfermedad, sufran abortos o den a luz ni?os prematuros y afectos de insuficiencia ponderal.<br>  <br>  El paludismo puede arrollar con rapidez a un ni?o peque?o produciendo fiebre alta, convulsiones y dificultades respiratorias. Si se inicia el paludismo cerebral, forma aguda de la enfermedad, el ni?o entra en coma y puede fallecer en 24 horas.<br>  <br>  La alta incidencia de los casos de paludismo (más de 275 millones al a?o en todo el mundo) puede imponer una elevada carga económica a las familias y los Estados por la disminución de la productividad, la pérdida de posibilidades educativas y los altos costos de la atención de salud.<br>  <br>  Sarampión<br>  El sarampión es la enfermedad más contagiosa de la especie humana. Es una importante causa de mortalidad infantil en los países en desarrollo, provocando unas 900 000 defunciones al a?o. El virus del sarampión puede en definitiva ser responsable de más defunciones infantiles que cualquier otro microbio, debido a las complicaciones por neumonía, enfermedades diarreicas y malnutrición.|`|DYSrW3Ehaa	sida,gripa,infesiones de garganta|`|ZVPmN4hoaa	creo que la gripe,aaaaaaaaachisssss!! je!cuidense je!! bye!|`|pbZbGr23aa	Pues la gripe e influenza, Tienen un alto grado de contagio|`|xTplSs33aa	Existen muchas enfermedades contagiosas, por ejemplo un herpes bucal o genital, sin duda el VIH sida, que es la más mortal.|`|faa1b239503158ef2eca8946440c1f45aa	La gripe es una enfermedad contagiosa muy común que suele aparecer en forma epidémica, es decir, que afecta a muchas personas de una determinada comunidad durante un corto tiempo, por lo general, en invierno o a principios de la primavera. <br>  <br>  Esta enfermedad está provocada por un virus, llamado en general Influenzavirus, que penetra en la parte superior del tracto respiratorio, a través de la nariz o de la boca, y puede extenderse a los pulmones. <br>  <br>  Los síntomas aparecen después de un período de incubación de uno o dos días; el período de incubación es el tiempo que transcurre desde que los virus penetran en el organismo hasta que aparecen los síntomas de la infección.|`|12f8e76e3dd44107f3b4d24e1fc13ff5aa	El pesimismo y la gripa.|`|Ndy9h7VVaa	En general las que se transmiten via aerea como la gripe, segida de las que se transmiten por via sexual como el VPH y el sida|`|c4e7c9c58d9ee8e892af757124004465aa	La gripa se te pega muy rapido por cualquiercontacto .<br>  <br>  <br>  Jeco coff cofff ya me la pegaron.|`|ouWy2J5Oaa	El HIV no es la mas contagiosa, pues solo se contagian los que "la buscan".<br>  <br>  Yo pienso que es la gripe y el resfrío.|`|wy4yH8R7aa	La gripe y las enfermedades eruptivas como lechina, sarampión, rubeola.|`|7difbrxfaa	hay muchisimas enfermedades altamente contagiosas y mas aun que una simple gripa que de por si lo es bastante. te doy el ejemplo del ebola, si tu te expones asi sea a las mas minima concentracion de ese virus, te da y en dos semanas te mata. el herpes tambien, si tu tienes contacto con el virus en alguna de tus mucosas, tambien te da.

Y seguramente hay enfermedades muy contagiosas y benignas que como no nos asustan no las tenemos en cuenta. <br>  <br>  Pongo el ejemplo de la tuberculosis ( no por benigna, sino por sus circunstancias peculiares), es un bacilo que puede vivir encapsulado durante a?os y manifestarse si las condiciones son apropiadas.

Causa una enfermedad llamada "fiebre hemorrágica del ébola" la cual es extremadamente contagiosa.

Ora non mi capita quasi più. Gli esercizi però dipendono da persona a persona uno che sicuramente non crea danni è: tieni la bocca chiusa con i denti che si toccano e mettti le mani nelle mascelle e comincia con i denti come a masticare (con le mani senti il movimento) ripeti per 10 volte e poi spalanca la bocca. Lo ripeti per 2 volte tutte le sere per 15 gg e troverai un miglioramento.<br>  Ciao|`|xbmxVmxzaa	O un dente del giudizio, oppure la mandibola fuori posto perchè forse ha avuto un contraccolpo.... es. tamponamento con l'auto, uno schiaffo, un colpo anche piccolissimo.

Hay razones para considerar que esos deseos son homosexuales, pero también hay muchas que justifican esa exitación y que no implican que quieras tener sexo con mujeres. Algunas de ellas son el hecho de que la mayor parte de la pornografía esté dirigida a hombres, y ya que siempre que veas porno el climax está en el orgasmo de la mujer, te acostumbras y amoldas a ésa forma de exitación. Hay otrs razones pero ahora me agarró flojera y no tengo ganas de escribir. <br>  Lo que te pasa con el orgasmo es muy común, muchas mujeres lo fingen y/o se masturban para alcanzarlo. De todas formas esto no es blanco o *****, no es homo o hétero y no hay salida, la libertad sexual te permite experimentar un amplio expectro de posibilidades y no tienes que "casarte" con ninguna.

But here it also sounds like she wasn't ready - if she was horny and excited, she'd want you inside her, and be lubricated. So could it be she is dubious about having sex now, and you're picking up on this? I also wonder if the fact you were trying to penetrate for so long means you need some basic informaiton on first time sex ? To be honest, this sounds like inexperience and fear. Why not play around more and explore with fingers and tongue, back off from intercourse for a while?<br>  If she's tightening up when you approach, you aren't going to get in her vagina anyway. (The best way for a virgin to do this is control how fast you enter her - so she might be on top.)<br>  Sounds to me like you need advice: <br>  <a href="http://www.the-penis.com/first.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-penis.com/first.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sex-and-relationships.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sex-and-relationships.com/</a>|`|slJGceGEaa	This happens to everyone at the time of first intercourse. You need to mentally relax and not get anxious. Make your partner also very comfortable otherwise her muscle would become too stiff and not allow you to penetrate.

0U7wA5rNaa	If you were looking for a 100% whey protein and it list soy protein in the ingredients, then it is false advertising.  If it just list soy products, then don't worry about it.  One of the most common items that you will find is soy lecithin.  It is used as an emulsifier during manufacturing.  <br>  <br>  If at some point you go to a protein blend that has soy protein, don't worry as it is not going to hurt your progress - just don't go to a straight soy protein source for a mass building routine.  The blends are beneficial as each protein source has its strong points and therefore you are able to benefit from each of the different protein sources.  This is where adding some casein to a post-workout shake or adding some whey to a bedtime casein drink.<br>  <br>  As far as getting your hormones out of balance, you would have to drink an exhorbanent amount to have this happen, then couple this with the lower biological value of the soy and the "femenizing effects" that are hyped are just that - hype.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|XgrYMR4Maa	     You really wanna get a 100%whey protein. Soy protein is made up differently and is absorbed differently. <br>       Studies have suggested that the phytoestrogens4 contained in soy protein lead to both unwanted decreases in testosterone, and increases in the female sex hormone estrogen. <br>       For example, the isoflavones (a phytoestrogen) found in soy are thought to upset hormone balance, and result in the aforementioned unwanted testosterone and estrogen changes in addition to thyroid problems. <br>       Some nutritional counselors have begun to suspect that soy may be to blame for the low energy, digestive disturbances, hypothyroidism, infertility, and other ailments they see in clients. <br>       Used together in an exercise regimen, soy and whey proteins complement each other well. Whey protein, as mentioned, is high in branched chain amino acids, used as an important energy source by the body during exercise, while soy protein has high amounts of the amino acids arginine and glutamine. <br>       Arginine is well known as a stimulant of anabolic hormones that stimulate muscle formation, while glutamine is considered essential during metabolic stress. <br>  <br>  So I guess that both have their benefits and (anti-benefits?-can't think of the right word lol)<br>  <br>  |`|Ue5NoJOgaa	Most protein supplements are made up of several protein sources, even if they say "whey protein," but you shouldn't be so worried about the source (unless you have an allergy) as much as you should be worried about what types of proteins are in it.  Different proteins act in different ways inside the body and should be taken at different times in different ways|`|iizKx4Bvaa	It means boogie likes it better.

xfgVGqvXaa	I know there are local anaesthetics that get absorbed through the gums, but I don't know whether the dentist can use them before giving the injection.  I was just speculating in my earlier answer.  (I hope this hasn't made you feel worse, but I didn't want you to get to the dentist only to find that he doesn't have any numbing gel after all.)<br>  <br>  Although you're frightened now, remember that you'll have taken your Valium before you go.  When you actually set off, you won't feel as bad as you do now, because the drug will be taking effect.  When you get to the dentist, you might be feeling a bit nervous, but nothing you can't cope with.  You might feel a prick when you have the injection, but it will soon be over because you won't be as frightened as last time.  After that, you won't feel anything because the anaesthetic takes effect straight away.<br>  <br>  After all these questions, we're waiting to hear how it goes!  You will tell us, won't you? :-)|`|UCkluEDTaa	The gel works. I had it to stop pain after a treatment. Don't worry so much. Think of something you like, mentally sing a song, paint a picture or imagine some boarder collie chasing sheep. Close your eyes. If you still see the needle, tell the dentist to hide it from you and talk to you about anything. I did that and now, I'm never scared anymore.|`|u6mOTo61aa	Oh Please don't worry. I'm a dental nurse and practice manager of a dental practice in central London. Everyday I speak to people on the phone and in person that feel just like you do.<br>  <br>  Listen, you have to remember that its better to have the treatment than not to, so you have to go through the injection part so you won't feel any pain. Its a very small and short scratch for the injection, and you will feel a little pressure but then it will be numb after a few mins.<br>  <br>  Ask them If they are going use the Topical gel, it helps and it tastes great!!!<br>  <br>  The main thing is to try and keep calm. Make sure you eat something before you go. This will keep you blood sugar high.<br>  <br>  Be Brave, it is never as bad as you think. I promise I hear this everyday.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|eU2Hg0Deaa	Don't worry you'll be fine. <br>  <br>  I used to be terrified too and also needed a filling one day, the pain your in now is much worse than the injection, I promise. <br>  <br>  make sure you close your eyes take deep breaths. Tell your dentist that you are nervous and he or she will be patient with you. <br>  <br>  I have to psych myself up for the injection, and in a sense tested my pain threshold...... sounds silly but i kinda poked my gum with my nail....If you do this now...... I promise the injection wont hurt any more than that.<br>  <br>  Ps. I didn't have numbing gel and I'm a real wimp.|`|TKDi70uTaa	yes they can put a gel on if you are worried about the injection. you will wonder why you were so worried after. toothache is ten times worse than any pain you may feel at the dentist.|`|hLH9tUmRaa	i love the stuff they put on to make our mouth numb.<br>  nothing gonna happen. your not gonna die. god!
wb9BBKzRaa	Oooooh goodness. I've had two colpo's done. <br>  <br>  Here's the procedure:  They basically use mini scissors and snip out pieces of your cervix. No, they don't use any anesthetics, and yes you will feel everything. Its not excruciating pain, but it is very uncomfortable. I can tell you that I'm an EXTREMELY emotional person, and I cried uncontrollably the entire time... But I also through things out of proportion a lot.<br>  <br>  Remember, you need to stay calm. If you're crying and shaking it'll take longer.<br>  <br>  Also, when they're done they pack this "medicine" up against your cervix. After a few days it'll fall out, so don't be surprised by this giant glob in your underwear or in the shower.|`|NEWbh3Plaa	It is uncomfortable but doesn't really hurt that much.  They have you lay back like you are getting a pap and then they pull your cervix down a little (uncomfortable part) then they put this vinegar like solution on it.  If there are any white spots (dyplasia)  they might take a sample to test it.  When I had mine they didn't cut the sample out they just scraped a little piece off.  It felt like a bad pinching and then I bled a little after wards which is normal.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|vD5ucs24aa	I had one about 3 months go. it was a little uncomfortable. They snip a piece of your uterus to send for test. mine came back fine. im sure yu will be fine. but it was  a little painful but not horrible.|`|MlDs21jAaa	it's uncomfortable to say the least. take about 600-800 mg of ibuprofen; the medicine in ibuprofen helps with inflamed muscles(like your uterus and such during menstruation) and it's a great pain reliever. And you may want to have someone drive you there and home, so you can just relax and not worry about driving. <br>  <br>  They may/may not have a heating pad for you to use and relax with on the table. I'm sure you could ask for one, i found it to help. What they are going to do is set you up like they would a normal doctor visit, and they will take pictures of your cervix, and they will take a piece of your CERVIX, not uterus. They will take a piece from the outside, and they may go to the inside of it to also take a piece. That will probably be the most uncomfortable part of the experience to be honest. It will probably hurt the most as your cervix has never been stretched and it will not be used to it. So make sure to take the ibuprofen an HOUR before your procedure. <br>  <br>  If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to call your doctor's office and talk with a nurse, or the doctor themselves if possible. Don't stress it, it'll make it worse for you!! Relax and do deep breathing...<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|VJqDtuoPaa	They take a small itty bitty peice of the uterus usually near the cervial wall and analize it at a lab. I had one come back with abnormal cells. They were eventually removed by Cryosurgery. Its a less than 15 minute out-patient surgery. What they did was use this freezing spray or something or the other to spray the abnormal cells then they scraped the frozen abnormal cells off my cervix. I know sounds horrible right? But truly its discomforting but not  really painful. It will feel like really severe cramps. It will be over before you know it. The areas that are nipped will scar up like regular tissue and detach itself. LOL yes you will have little scar tissue balls falling from your nookie but its nothing to worry about its perfectly normal.|`|itbcE3igaa	It's not too bad just uncomfortable. but do it soon i ended up having cancer and because of the Pap they caught it in time, one reason i had a hysterectomy. but don't worry this is  nothing compared to other things we go through.

hqSWUc8uaa	That is pretty normal for most girls. 28 days (which is 4 weeks) is not set in stone, every girl/woman is different. <br>  <br>  However if your doctor is recommending BC pills to regulate it, I would take his advice (now the thing is to convince mom of that, too, lol) And not only does it help with regulating your period (I got SO regular on my pills that I did get mine every 28 days... every 4th Thursday... and at approximately 10 am, that's how regular *I* got!) But BC pills can also help with cramps, too!!!<br>  <br>  When I was younger, before BC pills (I got my first period 2 months BEFORE my 10th birthday!!!) I would get cramps SO bad that I would miss 1 or 2 days of school each month cuz they were so crippling. I even had a few times that I vomited I was so sick and in SO much pain. I would just cry and cry for a day or 2. After I got on BC (when I was 16,) I had VERY little to NO cramping, and it also shortened my periods (most of the time my periods lasted 5-7 days) to 3-4 days, and later on it became 2-3 days! (I've been on BC on and off for about 17 years, and have consistently been on it for the past 6 years.)<br>  <br>  It's not a bad idea to talk to your mom about this again.

VtqdeSQ8aa	Being vegan, I don't eat them. Why eat extra fats though? My suggestion is to enjoy the olive oil with some added herbs & spices and whole grain bread or drizzled on veggies. Avocados are another healthy source of fats and so is dark chocolate which has the added benefits of antioxidants. These options just seem so much more appealing than chowing down on some deep fried skin. There is also some evidence that heating fats can create carcinogens which is why grilling and frying often isn't a good idea. Olive oil loses some of its benefits when heated to frying temperature. Olive oil is meant to be used only up to medium-high heat. Coconut oil can withstand high heat but it is high in saturated fats.|`|QRpB5pFXaa	healthy or not, i couldnt get over the fact im eating pig skin...that has probably rolled in poop|`|eD2SzJ2Jaa	yeah neither of those are healthy

Coffee is a natural antidepressant that works great.  And if you are mormon, the word of wisdom ALLOWS coffee for curing depression.<br>  <br>  Another natural antidepressant, believe it or not, is Monosodium Glutamate - it gets a bad rap but it's a lot safer than Zoloft.  Things will taste yummy too.<br>  <br>  Now, if you want to get serious . . . . . . .<br>  <br>  Take 5 htp, you can get it even at Wal Mart, and there is another alternative called L-tryptophan.  Both are potent, like prescription alternatives, and they won't cause your marriage to explode or give you brain damage like effexor, paxil, or zoloft will.<br>  <br>  believe me, I know more than your doctor or psychologist - I am more on par with a PHD psychiatrist.

sm8io0Kbaa	I had the surgery when I was 15. I know my parents paid some (about 2k) out of pocket, but the insurance covered the rest. If you can have an oral surgeon assess whether you really need it, or if it's just for aesthetic purposes, and you have insurance, it might help cover it. <br>  <br>  In my case, I had a really bad underbite, and my teeth only met in the back right side. I had trouble breathing and chewing food, and the surgeon said that eventually the teeth on that side would wear down and I wouldn't even be able to get a bridge or dentures when I'm old. So it was more medically necessary than an aesthetic thing, although it was an improvement in that area too.|`|UL3XOKJxaa	Should be under the 10- 15 thousand mark. Good luck

This was a question I posted a couple days ago.<br>  <br>  Gastroenteritis is inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, involving both the stomach and the small intestine and resulting in acute diarrhea." When I recently had a stomach virus I took ibuprofen. It did not cure it but I felt better each time I took it. The word "inflammation" caught my eye and I knew ibuprofen was an anti-inflammatory. I still had diarrhea but the sick, nauseated feeling settled down. It seemed to take the edge off. I cannot find any info on taking anti-inflams for a stomach virus.. If something is "inflamed" why couldn't one take an anti-inflam? I was suprised that I couldn't find info on this because if anything else was "inflamed" Docs always give u Motrin. Just wondering if anyone ever pondered this and if there is info on it. I do understand that food poisining is a whole different thing. I am just referring to the dreaded stomach flu everyone gets in the winter<br>  1 day ago - 3 days left to answer.|`|OhYE3GhKaa	first of all, how do you know that you have a virus? are you sure it is not something else perhaps more serious?

eXcnfH5aaa	Questa domanda (o analoghe) vedo che ritorna su answers,il problema principale credo sia trattare l'argomento su web,visto che il fascismo è sicuramente il periodo più discusso della storia d'Italia,in ogni caso prima di disprezzare eventualmente i fascisti credo sia d'uopo tenere a mente il fatto ke il fascimo ebbe l'appoggio di molti (forse la maggior parte) tra i più illustri intellettuali dell'epoca,come Giovanni Gentile,Luigi Pirandello,Giuseppe Ungaretti,Ggabriele d'annunzio,nonchè anche di uomini di scienza come Guglielmo Marconi,anche se non sono mancate opposizioni di autorevoli personalità,essnzialmente legete ad ambienti di tipo liberale-destra storica come Benedetto Croce ed Enrico Fermi.<br>  La tua domanda può assumere anche connotati divesi in base ai diversi settori di answers:è infatti proponibile più che altro in Politica... e Storia ma anche le categorie Salunte mentale,Psicologia,Sociologia possono avere spazio,in questo caso credo che analogamente a Psicologia e Sociologia si possa per buona parte cercare spiegazioni nel tessuto culturale e sociale dove una persona è cresciuta ma credo ciò non possa escludere totalmente l'aspetto caratteriale di una persona.<br>  In ogni caso se si studia un po' di storia di ragioni per dare ragione ai fascisti ce ne sono a volontà,il che non vuol dire per forza di cose diventare fascisti,i comunisti ed i socialisti ad esempio avrebbero molte cose da apprezzare del fascismo,ma la gente in generale non tende molto a studiare e vive di luoghi comuni.|`|Q6U7IZIaaa	Perchè si ha la memoria corta, oppure una totale ignoranza degli eventi storici.|`|0JQaWrFIaa	si crede che cosi' si ami di piu' l'italia, la bandiera, l'ordine.....non e' poco!!|`|144a44a70de8858d53cd96378b6881dfaa	ummmm.....sento aria di provocazione....|`|d1d27013a74acf7327058264fde45704aa	Perche' coloro che amano, o credono di amare la dittatura, nera o rossa che sia, non l'hanno mai vissuta.<br>  <br>  Io non ho vissuto nessuna dittatura e non amo nessuna delle due.<br>  <br>  Viva la democrazia.|`|oQWNyMrwaa	Se per essere fascisti si intende approvare le riforme a favore del popolo, dei lavoratori, della libertà di studio, le colonie per far divertire i figli dei poveri lavoratori che non potevano far la vacanza coi figli, le pensioni... beh mi ci potrei mettere anch'io... (ed erano tutte, badate bene, cose DI SINISTRA....)<br>  Il problema è che la storia di oggi queste cose non le ricorda, in quanto la storia è sempre scritta da chi vince, ricordiamocelo, pertanto essere fascista è diventato sinonimo di prepotente, antidemocratico e guerrafondaio... in questa seconda versione è logico che la maggior parte delle persone non si possa riconoscere....|`|4oTkfgBmaa	perchè nn hanno studiato e nn hanno una famiglia cn un minimo di cultura alle spalle!

9PKyOE1Gaa	i dunno, maybe. your teeth always feel a little, like...tender...when you have braces. cause theyre moving. but if you're really worried phone up your dentist for an appointment or popin for a quick chat...whichever way your dentist works!! better to be safe than sorry!<br>  i wouldnt think you'd be able to damage them THAT badly with a cup, but i remember when i'd hit them with something theyd feel odd but i think thats normal.|`|JPcls7Fwaa	Well Don't play or mess with them any more leave them as .Don't push them in either <br>  <br>  Well mine went inside a lot.If u are still concerned just visit ur dentist Once....<br>  
sm8io0Kbaa	I think it's really natural to be scared of going to the dentist: tooth pain is nothing to be sneezed at, and you feel like you risk that every time you go. When I was a kid I went to a dentist who scammed my parents into buying four retainers for me, none of which I really needed. Plus he was really gruff and disagreeable, scared me and my sis, and hit one of my mom's friends who also went to him. As a result, I hate the dentist, the end. The one I go to now is really nice, and even though I get ridiculously nervous before even a little cleaning, he's the best short of actually being sedated for the appointment.<br>  <br>  The key to putting up with the dentist is to make sure you get one who knows what he's doing with the novocaine and the pain meds. Your goal is to not be in pain, everything else is just gravy. I've had fillings before, they won't hurt if he numbs you properly. I've never had the laughing gas, but I hear it's great.<br>  <br>  As for the braces, don't worry about them. I had braces for three years, and nothing they ever did to my braces hurt me. Made me really sore, gave me headaches, yes, but that is NOT the same as drilling a tooth. You can relax at the ortho, if they put braces on, the worst they'll do is make your mouth sore and tender.|`|XKhPdzKeaa	You just have to tell yourself that if you don't go now you could end up with really horrible, painful teeth when you are older that will involve an awful lot of painful work, or you may even end up with dentures!<br>  <br>  I too am scared of the dentist but in my 29 years I have never had a bad experience and I have had fillings, extractions, root canal and a brace. I often find it is enough just to tell the dentist you are nervous when you first walk in and they are very sympathetic.<br>  <br>  Just take a deep breath and go for it.|`|4gp8rjkBaa	Don't worry! Even i used to get REALLY scared but what i did, was take my ipod with me and listen to it even while check-ups. That will soothe you and pay know attention to what the dentist is doing or using.<br>  Filling doesn't hurt at all and braces...well, if you want to look better, it's worth it!|`|sbEdNl2Xaa	I was utterly terrified of the dentist for years, I had really bad experiences with a dentist affectionately known as The Butcher' as a kid, but he was the only available dentist left in my home town providing a free service under the Irish health system so my parents had no choice but to keep taking me.  <br>  I've recently found a dentist and have undergone the first round of treatment to get my teeth fixed in more than 15 years. I had a filling placed, and my dentist told me that I didn't need local anesthetic to get me through it, and she was right.  The filling was placed in 5 minutes and I walked out, shaking but grinning.  I have a lot more work to be done, but one bridge at a time, as they say.  <br>  My advice, tell the dentist that you're scared when you walk in.  It helps to know what exactly makes you scared, for me, it was the huge amount of work I thought I needed, the cost and the pain involved with that. Take a stress ball in, your ipod to distract you, anything to take you mind off the check up.  <br>  It's worth getting over this fear now so that a small problem that can be fixed painlessly now won't become a big, painful mess in the future.  There is nothing worse than a toothache.  I'm sorry I didn't face my fears sooner, not that my fears are gone now, but I figure the short term discomfort of my treatment is worth saving myself from the long term discomfort of having to wear dentures for the rest of my life!
kdBhSqqfaa	You're not a freak, but you need to definitely check it out with the doctor. Don't hesitate to go see him -- he will be able to tell you why it's happening and make it better. They see this stuff all the time, they won't think any less of you for it. Please go! I'm 22 and I can't imagine having to wear Depends, you poor thing!|`|gyuIOcPFaa	Go to the doc ASAP.  That is not normal and could be something small as an infection or could be a major problem as cancer.  I have seen this in several friends..so get to the doctor as soon as you can.|`|6tOK3STZaa	thats called incontinence, when you cannot control your bowel movements. that doesnt happen to 22 year olds, only really old people or people with medical issues, so you definately need to go see a doctor as soon as possible.|`|03rggPF2aa	see a doctor, obviously its not normal or depends would have been advertised to the 22 yr old age range instead of old people. it might be a sign of colon problems.|`|Po2UqfvWaa	nope, doesn't sound normal. time to see the doctor.|`|DXzUCgj8aa	yea.. that's not normal u should defiantly get that checked out
kZ2Klv0Daa	Try dayquil or tylenol cold. Both have pseudoephedrine, which should keep you awake (thus the "non drowsy" label).|`|OOPPTQuVaa	Well if you want energy take 5 hour energy, believe me that **** works.
ec36b3a5091c259dd5116cc42bde8803aa	No point in anyone advising you what may be the problem, when you have the result of all your tests, the doc or consultant will be the best person to advise you what may be the problem.<br>  <br>  The upper CT scan is fine - I found that to be ok - the injection to colour dye for clearer scanning a little uncomfortable but not really a problem.<br>  <br>  You may have a combination of things going on and having all the tests is a good process of elimination.<br>  <br>  Good wishes to you and may your results prove ok.
kB4EJUKgaa	It's totally a personal decision. Your beliefs should determine how you feel about it. Some believe God gave you them, so you shouldn't alter them and some believe it's just like getting a hair cut. Let what you believe determine what you do about it, not people on the internet.|`|Uv19uf8Iaa	I had the same thoughts with you when I was 21 and DD cup size. I decided to reduce them and I am thankful for my surgery every single time I look in the mirror, 10 years after. Not only do I look thinner and younger, I can also actually wear strapless clothing, spaghetti straps, wear dresses without a bra! Be sure to find a surgeon who understands your needs, and be very specific about the "after " size. The surgery was very easy, after 10 days I was swimming!|`|91f1a70e10014a34ca04f2d24c385427aa	i have the same question. i am 5"6, weigh about 140 pounds and I'm a size 36 DDD. my back is always hurting and i have heard that it would help but its very expensive.|`|TNalBsrMaa	how do you not fall forward??  you must have a hunchback.|`|rK61Oabxaa	Yikes, your must be hunchbacked and falling foward!<br>  But really,<br>  Its a personal choice.  But don't worry about what god gave you, It's not slapping him in the face.  If you don't like them change it, its not gods boobs.  There yours.  It will stop your back from hurting also.  So if I were you I would get a breast reduction.  But its a personal choice, what ever you like is what you should do!<br>  (:|`|VJqDtuoPaa	Had a friend of mine do it cause she was having back problems as well. She looks great and feels much better. If it is truly bothering you I would have it done. Life's too short to be walking around suffering when you don't have to. God will understand just pray about it and do what feels right.|`|n1HZvR2gaa	well guys do love that..<br>  ahahhaha but if you want you should.<br>  I always laugh saying one day ill get <br>  that and only have nipplez left no boobs<br>  BAhahhahaha. i dont know.. boobs are<br>  a pain... they are always there and never<br>  leave. its up to you. god doesnt care!<br>  i woudnt think about that.. there are people<br>  who get implants and reduction and etc.. <br>  <br>  btw how old are you???|`|W76VDFKCaa	Having large breast for some woman can be very painful and I have know several women who had it done.  They were very happy with the choice they made.|`|a984cQjKaa	god isn't the one having to lag the damn things around, so you do whatever you think is best.  if you feel like you could stand to be a cup size or two smaller, go for it, and don't let people who aren't carrying the boobs tell you otherwise.
NGz7R9enaa	That is a question only you can answer. I too am a smoker and I think I should stop smoking, but I am just not ready. I don't think you can quit without wanting to, at least I know I can't. Good luck to you, if you decide to try.
E64juLwJaa	Your hand is injured but not your legs:so go running each day for 30 minutes:that will get you back into shape again<br>  Colors.|`|Pm9Q3yM7aa	Continue with physical therapy and a good way is to do any form of cardio for 10 minutes then work on your upper body with weights for 20 minutes then do cardio for 30 minutes. Then next day do the same thing except do your lower body with weights for 20. Alternate every other day
QOlk2mFeaa	i heard fruit is supposed to help|`|OXxKTM6vaa	Believe it or not - exercise. It releases something in you're body & helps you. I heard about it last month and so yesterday when I had bad period pains I decided to go to college & do fitness, instead of staying at home feeling sorry for myself like I usually do and within a few hours I felt great. Unlike usually, I usually feel like crap all day. I guess being out and taking you're mind off it helps too!|`|wmdAbsA4aa	pain killers, hot water bottle, chocolate, exercise, a hot bath and even tablets believe it or not bananas and this is a secret hot milk it keeps the screams of me and my sister way lol|`|FlsTnEA5aa	Excercise.<br>  <br>  Fruit.<br>  <br>  Also relax! Don't dare shop! Work and you know relax!|`|4MqkgMzDaa	I've heard bananas really help with period pains.

When I got my periods (which was only 4 times a year) I would get them to the point I'd get low pressure and faint then when I'd wake up, I'm in such a horrible cramp pain. The ONLY thing that relieved me was TORTILLAS, put two or three in the microwave for a few seconds, wrap them with a napkin so they won't burn so much and place them on your stomach. Then when it gets cold, I'd repeat it again and it helped me A LOT. Forget those Midol pills (take too long when you need the pain to go away now) and forget all that heating pad crap (takes forever). Microwave a few seconds, then BAM. This relived me a lot.|`|VJqDtuoPaa	Some women just have greater pain than others. But I agree with the exercise it really helps and I think everywoman should own a how water bottle. If those aren't helping talk to your doc it may be something more severe. Good luck|`|JgdLShjeaa	try swimming.x
IyOVYQ0paa	The fine grain can eventually wear away the layers of protective shields your teeth have over them, but only if you use the plain old stuff bare on your teeth, and more than three months at a time. It will really safely whiten your teeth when you use it once every three or more months because it cleans off the surface stains.|`|YupMCYHlaa	It can, it's fairly abrasive.  But to do any serious damage you'd have to use it several times a day for years and years.  Baking soda in toothpaste is -dissolved-, so it's not abrasive.  But they do put abrasives in toothpaste to brighten your teeth, just very fine stuff and not very much.|`|9PKyOE1Gaa	yup.<br>  <br>  but i dont think many people brush their teeth with pure baking soda so its not usually a problem i dont think :P<br>  <br>  but yeah, it can|`|FbqHOKUXaa	I don't think so.  If it wore away enamel they wouldn't put it in toothpaste.|`|5VcHDssUaa	i think like if you put pure baking soda and do that often yeah it would
e87e3011834330413836ab017770e056aa	Hi,<br>  You're on the right track but a few suggestions...<br>  <br>  i. I think you may be a little light on carbs, particularly if you're doing aerobic activity (which you should be). Try something low fat like a jacket potato with your tuna and beans.<br>  ii. make sure your beans are the low sugar variety.<br>  iii. Raw eggs are disgusting and may put you off. Try hard boiling them instead. Same protein.<br>  iv. Give yourself a little treat now and then otherwise it'll be hard to stick to.<br>  v. Exercise should be a mixture of aerobic sessions (runnings best but cyclings a decent alternative) and high rep low weight anaerobics.<br>  <br>  Most of all be realistic about what you can achieve in a month. It will probably take longer to get the shape you want but stick at it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|PNT7J0Ufaa	You can't turn fat into muscle.  You can loose fat, then eventually gain muscle from workouts.  You are not eating enough during the day.  To get your metabolism moving, eat six small meals a day, three as your regular meals, and two as a snack size.  The  meals and snacks should be healthy, and in moderate proportions.|`|kprKXEOSaa	This is a low carb and a low calorie diet.  You will certainly lose weight, but your body may metabolize existing muscle rather than body fat.  Your metabolism will slow down, so your energy level will be low, and you will probably be grouchy, too.<br>  Once you start eating normally, you will gain a bunch of body fat because what you have here is basically a starvation diet.  You're going to end up grouchy and fatter than you were to start, and maybe even have less muscle mass.<br>  Sure, in a month, you will have visible results.  But where will you be in 6 months or a year?<br>  Sounds like a bad plan to me.<br>  Stick with eating healthy, balanced meals, focusing on vegetables, whole grain, lean meat and dairy, and fruit.  Snack on vegetables, and other healthy foods after that, if you're still hungry.  And drink about 8 8-oz glasses of pure water every day.<br>  Exercise moderately and aerobically 6 days a week if you need to lose some body fat, and add in some weight training every other day if you're looking to build muscle mass.<br>  It sounds boring, and you won't get the dramatic results you want, but long-term you will be healthier and more fit.  And you won't be grouchy, which is always a bonus, especially for those around you.<br>  Good luck!|`|V1S9tN0uaa	Raw eggs, while a staple of movies, are not actually great for building muscle, as you can get all sorts of bacteria. Any combination of exercise and dieting will eventually help tho
xb7d9OWhaa	The function of antidepressant pills is to sort out a chemical imbalance in the brain. They will not sort out your life for you. Depressed people feel like crap even when things are working out in there life, that calls for antidepressants<br>  |`|Ue5NoJOgaa	The best approach to depression is generally some kind of medication and some kind of talk therapy (cognitive is what helped me).  People who tell you that there are horrible side effects NEED TO TALK TO THEIR DOCTOR, if you are on ANY medication and there are undesirable side effects your doctor should be informed.  The first antidepressants I took weren't right for me, and I suffered from the same kind of sexual side effects, it took three tries with different dosages and different medications but I can say now, for sure,that they saved my life, and that I don't suffer from any side effects.  Depression is a real medical condition and in many cases it takes medication to treat it, please don't hold back because of a stigma against antidepressants or a depression diagnosis.  There is no reason to live depressed one day longer than you have to.|`|yq72XIhdaa	Anti-depressants can help. <br>  <br>  If you feel you are depressed, it's best to talk to your doctor about treatment possibilities.|`|2PGvedOcaa	I am very much against SSRI's and MAOI's.  <br>  You need to heal your adrenals.  <br>  don't take pills. <br>  www.adrenalfatigue.org|`|3IKqAykMaa	just focus on trying to fix your life, getting back on track.<br>  the pills could help along the way but i wouldnt count on them at all to make your life better.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|Gx7tvp2yaa	i think if you don't need them stay away from them !!!!! i take them and i hate them they change you and ruin sex lives and have horrid with-drawls! and if you aren't really depressed they will make you!|`|2mkECIheaa	I think they're great, and if they fix a chemical imbalance, can be life-changing.
9PKyOE1Gaa	i have no idea what canines are, haha, but i can answer the braces part i think.<br>  <br>  do you mean you pushed the wire? if you pushed the wire and one side hurts more id go to your dentist so he can put the wire back to how it should be :P<br>  <br>  if it wasnt the wire you moved then uhm, yeah. one side usually hurts more than the other, they take turns! depends what teeth are being moved. but no...the side that hurts wont be all jacked up, shouldnt be anyway, braces hurt anytime and anywhere in your mouth but you learn to cope with it and if the pain is ever too much...reach for strong painkillers (and ice cream!!!) :D<br>  <br>  hope that helps, and good luck.|`|NUvu9vMDaa	well if you just got your braces on, any slight movement can and will cause pain to your mouth, you'll get used to it, trust me!|`|sU4cnL8Laa	its normal dont worry<br>  i had my braces taken off this summer<br>  and got my retainers..<br>  both times, one side of my mouth hurt more than the other.<br>  Either one side needs more moving or..something :P dont worry!|`|DjWyJFTWaa	Go to the orthadontist just to be safe, you don't want damage cause that could lead to permanent damage or a prolonged time in braces.
qac6YoZ3aa	I would say they hurt for the first day or two...eat yogurt and jello and that kind of stuff.  Take Tylenol too.  It will be uncomfortable, but you will get so used to them eventually that you won't even remember you have them.  They also maybe sore a little after an adjustment, but that will go away.  Plus, the feeling you get when you get them off is so awesome...you will know it was totally worth it!|`|u91xjDOHaa	yes you will want to take pain killers and eat soft foods like soup|`|0Lhftbzmaa	Well i have braces and they only hurt when u get them on or tightened. they only hurt for about a week though.good luck|`|Ue5NoJOgaa	They are more uncomfortable than painful, sort of a soreness.

And everyone grows at different speeds... someday soon you'll have a grow spurt and then it'll be like "whammo!" lol<br>  <br>  Also, your boobs will not be stunted if you wear a bra that fits properly. And when you grow out of it, you get a new one that also fits properly. Leaving "growing space" is just silly, lol...<br>  <br>  Just let nature take its course... there's nothing you can do to speed it up...<br>  <br>  |`|qanCbLNLaa	get over it<br>  <br>  that is a lamo question<br>  <br>  wait till u get older KID<br>  CHILD<br>  lil boobs ha!
c2a59ffe831f9edcc17cddc0e6dd9352aa	its not. Anyone can get aids if they get blood, semen, or vaginal secretions that are infected with HIV into open wounds or sores. Being puntured with  something that had infected blood on it can transfer it as well. <br>  <br>  I think in the past people presumed that only gay ppl and drug users got the virus. <br>  Years ago it was my understanding (because of what everyone told us) that gay ppl were notorious for having unprotected sex with just anyone and everyone and thats how they spread aids amongst themselves. That is a  lie. im sure there are those who  have no filter but the same goes for  heterosexual people. Same thing with the MYTH that all gay ppl are pedophiles NO...sickos that like to fondle kids are pedophiles. For the record: Most child predators are straight.<br>  Now, the cdc does report that in 2006 the highest number of ppl with aids were gay black males ages 40-44 <br>  NOW everyone (surely) knows that Anyone can get it...even the soccer mom next door. <br>  i know you didnt want sites but im giving you one anyway. its the cdc (centers for disease control) <br>  anyways, use a condom and dont do drugs...the things you have been taught all your life. they were taught for good reason!|`|1QyV4Nzvaa	HIV/AIDS has nothing to do with those of us called queer.  Particularly now.  In the US in the 1980s, AIDS was called 'gay cancer'.  Sadly, many more over the world are concerned about this horrible infection.  <br>  <br>  Gay = Love.<br>  <br>  AIDS = BAD.<br>  <br>  There is no connection.<br>  <br>  Be safe; use protection.<br>  |`|1ba7ad1b64c961e93996c1e19a8446e2aa	Because your not supposted to have adam and steve or eve and april.

Not the way it is now. |`|g4Sl7LQqaa	This is a myth.<br>  <br>  People just say that coz their afraid of gays.<br>  <br>  PEOPLE WHO ARE GAY HAVE THE SAME CHANCE OF AIDS AS PEOPLE WHO ARE STRAIGHT.|`|PMUcJeXxaa	It's a ******* myth.  Spread by the catholic church because their bible told  them to kill the gays.|`|sSf6x4Itaa	I dunno but to avoid aids play safe........................|`|hAuemuWTaa	R u asking how  does gay guys get aids|`|wQ9owGKPaa	NO, NOT IN THIS CASE
QnKV75Chaa	well sweety you need to kinda chill out on the pen thing unless you want to keep your mom mad because by you still doing this,, the process of your teeth getting straigten and lesser..and omg its the front dang your in a hHotheat...well just tell you mom what happend and beg that you want do it again,,but dont lie to her,..|`|z8s6xNLCaa	Don't wait until December. You should just go back to the orthodontist really quick and have them glue them back on. It only takes a bit. There is no reason to be mad, it was an accident. This just teaches you to be more careful while eating pens. LOL!|`|9PKyOE1Gaa	you should really go back to your dentists straight away tbh. i had that happen once, and theyre usually fine. its probs cus theyve not used enough cement or whatever its called. their fault really, not yours. cant help it coming off!<br>  <br>  and yeah, your mum shouldnt be mad, happens all the time! just means it wasnt attached to your teeth strong enough. go back to your dentist and ask him why they keep coming off or tell him/her to do a better job :P lol<br>  <br>  yeah...basically go back :P|`|qA8DE37Jaa	yeah, I would go to the dentist as soon as possible. You dont want your teeth to move around and the 2 front center everything... if I were u, I would eat something hard at dinner that your mom made for u, then pretend like they came off with that... |`|nOz7BvJvaa	you have to go to the dentist or your teeth will start moving and not how they are supposed to. 
lil8x2k3aa	You could wear solar Shields they are a large wrap-around Type of sunglasses with good UV protection. Even long after Your surgery I would stay away from sunglasses with out some sort of side protection like aviators stick to a sport sunglasses. Even the cheap sunglasses have good UV lens protection. Just be sure they have wider side arms.|`|vk6oLlJDaa	in all case with eye surgery of any kind it is always a good thing to ask your eye doctor. he/she is the best person to educate you on this matter. however, usually after eye surgery the dark wraparounds are used while the eye is heeling. if you are going to eventually get prescription glasses, i highly recommend the transition lenses, they change for sun and then change back for indoors, they have been great for me and they have uv protection also.....good luck
a8c1ec2782f2cbb1944ac1b3fd537fa6aa	Have you had unprotected sex? If so, take a test!|`|MlDs21jAaa	I imagine a "copper coil" is that of an IUD? You might want to call and schedule an appointment with your doctor to make sure there are no perforations in your uterus from the IUD. It's possible that your uterus is bleeding, not from period blood, but from a tear or a perforation. Get it checked.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|JgdLShjeaa	hiya, this was my symptom with all 3 of my pregnancys so i would get a test and if that comes back negative go and see your nurse in local gp surgery.x
f14e7634a2f2cb52ab80310b78f8411caa	Some bleeding (even heavy bleeding) after an IUD removal is normal, from what I've read it might take a while for periods to regulate after one has been removed. The danger in leaving it is that the removal may have scratched or knicked something and that could be the source of the bleeding. If you are soaking through a pad every hour for 3 hours or more, you should seek medical attention because that is too much. If it keeps up and you're getting worried, definitely see a doctor. It's worth the peace of mind at least.
4rFCesSsaa	Discharge means that you are starting to go through puberty, but does not mean that your period is guaranteed to start soon.  Most woman start their periods between the ages of 12 and 14.  I didn't get mine until I was almost 13 and a half and my sister got hers when she was 10, so it doesn't really matter about when your siblings got them.  You should be happy that it hasn't started yet because it is a pain in the butt!|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Girls start their periods anywhere from 9-17 years old and all are normal.  It will happen when your body develops sufficient hormones to cause ovulation.  When that happens you will have a need for a lining in your uterus which will then come out as periods.  There is nothing you can do to make this process happen any faster than nature wants it to.  In the meantime, relax and be happy you don't have bloody, stinky discharge coming from your body with cramps that sometimes send girls to bed and PMS that causes you to be mean to the people you love.  Go somewhere and do the happy dance that you don't have something that will basically make you miserable for the next 40 or so years.<br>  <br>  best wishes..
XM7VV5Xyaa	yes.  pills often cause spotting and vaginal dryness.<br>  <br>  you can try a low hormone pill.  some people have been happy with yaz or loestrin. i was happy with both, as pills go they were pretty good, but i don't like the pill at all so i stopped taking it (i am not just hoping for the best).  even with those pills i suffered vaginal dryness and low libido (which was probably caused by the dryness) etc.  but they may work for you.

e583cebee349ef9a997c192a1abad42aaa	Yes I broke my little toe also a few years ago. It was very very painful! I had to get my husband to buy a stick for me and use that to just get around the house. The NHS is terrible at providing walking aids, even for permanent use, certainly worse at providing them temporarily, and as your toe should begin to feel better in about 5 days, they assume you can rest until then.<br>  To be honest you are better taking a few days off and resting properly to allow the bone to heal correctly. If you carry on hobbling around on it it may never heal properly and will given you pain long term.|`|vgIk1k1Kaa	As you will have probably been told at the hospital there is nothing they can do for a broken toe apart from let it heal on it's own.<br>  <br>  You know the what the nhs are like. They are so tight with everything, crutches are only given out to people with broken legs, ankles etc.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately you will just have to limp and hobble around until it's better.|`|m8qVyMVSaa	I have broken my toes and going to the doctor for that is a waste of time. Have you wrapped your toes? You can get medical tape and the toe that is broken you can tape it to the toe beside it. I was never given crutches for that. Basically you need to walk through the pain. I know it hurts, but that is what I did and everyone else I know. Good luck with that.|`|3meIiIsmaa	Borrow some crutches for a few days if that helps to take pressure off - but basically there is nothing you can do for a broken toe - sometimes they tape it to the next toe to help stabilize it - take Tylenol and try to keep it elevated so it won't throb - it's gonna take 4-6 weeks to heal.|`|c3b0303b45fbe6430dc388e695c7e5eaaa	Tape the toe to the next one not too tight this will stop it moving so much and helps

7lnyNHgYaa	You should definitely talk to a doctor. It's just always a good idea when anyone is changing the way you eat. In the mean time, or if you can't get there, try to just eat as healthy as you can. Try a bowl or cereal and skim milk for breakfast, a sandwich on wheat bread, and some sort of side for lunch. A nice piece of chicken or fish and some veggies for dinner, and some dessert at the end. For snacks you try nutrigrain bars, some fresh fruit, or some crackers. <br>  But I think trying to plan out your meals will make things harder for you. Try to ease into it, though, because your body is in "starvation mode," and for a while extra calories are more likely to turn into fat. Working out a little, maybe 3 times a week will help your body change the extra calories into muscle instead. <br>  <br>  But you should really, really, really talk to a doctor. Or at least a dietitian or nutritionist.|`|4rA9hhQ2aa	doctors neede sorry|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	the best thing for you to do is talk to your Dr.<br>  <br>  you have asked this question well over 10 times.|`|PGdpD0Poaa	You need to exercise you will gain weight from it, but not from fat.. also don't exercise as much as you think you should, like only exercise once a week<br>  <br>  You do need to eat, once you gain enough to be at normal weight for how ever old you are, You can start watching your weight again, as in keeping track of your weight so you can stay at normal weights for a long time.<br>  <br>  You mustn't let your fears get a hold of you, You gotta take a deep breath and a shove a pizza down your throat, for god's sake.|`|2rCZbaEIaa	<---recovered annorexic<br>  go see a doctor, if your severly sick you may need inpatient, therapy, medication, support groups<br>  <br>  #1 lower your excercise routines until you start gaining again<br>  #2 Stop counting calories, calorie counting leaves you obsessed with numbers<br>  #3 throw away your scale  (or have a friend store it)<br>  if you can't see that youve gained a half a pound you won't stress it so much<br>  #4 stop thinking about food and start living your life.

I'm not a huge get out there and turn yourself orange fan, but I know that going to the tanning bed twice, won't do much as far as protecting yourself.  I think you should go at LEAST twice a week, because you won't be going in for very long due to your paleness.  I usually start around this time of year for the same reasons as you, just so I won't burn terribly in the summer.  And I usually start out in a 20-30 minute bed for only 8 to 10 minutes.  And of course when you go, still load up on sunscreen.  You will still get sun, and the sunscreen will help block out the bad stuff.  So if you go two to three times a week this month, that would be perfect.  Have Fun!  I'm jealous!|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	I always tan before a vacation to a warmer climate, it seems to keep me from burning (I live in Indiana so I know what you mean) I just go to get a base and that's about it. I want to come back and look like I was on vacation not look like I'm just getting back from one before I leave.|`|3g5EvX6baa	Lots of people advise against tanning in a tanning bed, but I agree with you on the drastic change concern.<br>  <br>  I personally would be tanning in a tanning bed before making a tropical vacation, to avoid getting a burn from spending all that time in the sun after a long winter where you haven't.  That's just my personal choice.<br>  <br>  And, yes, still use at least a mild sunscreen while you're down there, and moisturize constantly.<br>  <br>  Have a wonderful trip!|`|OhYE3GhKaa	would you chow down before going to a restaurant. <br>  <br>  come to think of it, Mammy made Scarlett OHara eat a meal before going to the barbecue so she could appear to have a dainty ladylike appetite.<br>  <br>  going to the tanning bed is not good for your skin or pocketbook. Just tan in moderation when you get there. Use sunblock and a beach umbrella.

Kq4usVUTaa	Don't be so quick to dismiss therapy.  Most girls with serious eating disorders cannot kick it on their own.  Bulemia is an extremely dangerous condition, and I'm sure you know what it's doing to your body.  Don't be ashamed.  There is no shame in seeking help for this!  In fact, it takes a lot of courage!  I can tell that you want help, because you talked to your counciler about it.  And you tried to stop on your own, to no avail.  Maybe it's time that you seek professional help.  They can give you strategies for coping with stress, eating plans, all kinds of stuff.  They can probably reccommend a support group too!  Please get the help that you need before it's too late!|`|Z0vILtdhaa	The problem with eating disorders is that alot of the time they become a "mental state" where you actually don't have control of what you're doing.

And recognising that you want to get over it is a fantastic first step.|`|Vnhc0C6Qaa	ok i will prolly be really annoying but it is for ur own good i had anorexia when i was 13 cuz i am a model plz think about going to theropy it will help u can be helped read the book perfect my bff DIED  from bulima i know how serious this is and talk to ur consuletr tell her u really r mad at her b/c u betrayed her trust and tell her that if she is going to tell ur parents she shouldn't lie to u my anorixea got better cuz i went to therpoy i thought nuttin would help i would never get better i was so grumpy it can help plz email me thatnx GET HELP|`|f1f3f00237056d4b80b352880fe7e88faa	Your councellor was wrong to do that.

AA11229353	I found this on the web. Hope it helps you with your question:<br>  <br>   The following are a few health risks that should be considered before a cancer patient receives massage therapy. These risks do not necessarily mean that massage is out of the question; only that precautions must be taken to avoid them:<br>  <br>  ? Bone fractures—some forms of cancer can affect the bones, and deep massages on affected areas can lead to fractures. Inform your massage therapist about your cancer so that they are able to avoid risks such as these.<br>  <br>  ? Tumor spreading—this is an issue that has been debated thoroughly. Many sources claim that it is untrue that massage will cause metastasis while others say that deep massage directly on the site of a tumor can break it down and cause it to spread or increase in growth rate. Since there are so many differences of opinion on the subject, it is best to consult your specialist first in the case of a tumor. They will be able to provide you with the most up-to-date information on the subject, as well as help you determine what is best in your situation.<br>  <br>  ? Bleeding—deep massage should be avoided in patients who bleed easily.<br>  <br>  ? Lymphedema—if a patient has recently had lymph nodes removed due to cancer, and then receive certain types of massage near or on certain parts of the body (especially if the therapist is too vigorous with their pressure in this area), it can cause the patient to develop lymphedema.<br>  <br>  ? Pain—patients with cancer are often in tremendous pain, and then some treatments will even add to that pain temporarily. If this patient seeks out massage in an effort to reduce pain and anxiety, they may well have excellent results. But, if they do not inform their therapist of their medical condition, or if the therapist isn’t prepared to do massage on a cancer patient, the results could be more pain instead of relief. Many massage therapies require deep pressure that could, in the beginning, be considered pain by many patients. This quickly turns to pleasure and relief, but if the person receiving the massage is already in pain before the massage begins, the pain can be excruciating.<br>  <br>  ? Flu-Like Symptoms—there have been many cases of patients who are undergoing chemotherapy showing flu-like symptoms after receiving bodywork treatments. This usually happens because nausea is a side effect of the chemotherapy as well as the bodywork (this is only with some forms, but it shows why it is important for the practitioner to be aware of your situation).|`|ohlNPWZXaa	no its not true. Doctors often recommend massage to their cancer patients in hopes of relieving generalized stress about the disease or to help with pain control. (Pain may be a symptom of mesothelioma or a side effect of a cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy or radiation). The American Cancer Society promotes massage as a "universally beneficial" form of alternative therapy for cancer patients on their website.<br>  <br>  The relaxation that results from a massage often helps improve a cancer patient's quality of life, at least for a short time. There is even some scientific evidence which shows that massage enhances the immune system by increasing blood circulation. Further studies are being conducted in this area. Remember, massage does not offer a cure for any type of cancer.<br>  <br>  there is a rumour that massaging an area where there is a cancerous tumour might 'break open' the tumour, however this is untrue. |`|16e730ba39930a9906b368149bb74bbfaa	I've only heard of that restriction if there are areas where skin has begun to break down (due to infection, chemo side effects, pressure sores, etc.).<br>  <br>  Otherwise massages are not only soothing but promote healthy blood flow and alleviate the backup of fluid into the hands, feet and legs.<br>  <br>  Some drugs do have warnings for patients to avoid hot water, heating pads, hot tubs, or hot towels (like for a European facial treatment and some kinds of post massage wraps).|`|62606e92b3ab21e8b1abda7881267fceaa	I have had breast Cancer and was told not to have massage on or near my scar .Because its now sensitive .|`|XZOG2mNwaa	This is old advice, that today is totally different.  Cancer charities believe in massage, and often offer this as a therapy.<br>  <br>  If you go to www.after-cancer.com there is information from German health authority, that advocates massage, and links through to different charities giving sensible advice.<br>  <br>  Yes, there are types of massage that are not suitable.  Yes, therapists should avoid sensitive sites, and YES - massage is recommended in best hospitals and centers in France, Germany etc. for cancer patients.<br>  <br>  Verite R|`|IVjspiStaa	NO...NO..NO...<br>  I am a survivor of cancer.<br>  my friend and licensed massage therapist said, no massages for you now...massages release toxins from cells that might be harmful.<br>  That’s what the therapist says...and I’m sticking to that...<br>  |`|NKuQh4sSaa	No it isn't true. There are many cancer centres that offer massages as a form of complementary therapy to help along side the traditional therapies such as chemo and radio therapy . A lot of centres offer aromatherapy as well .
AA11138680	you should take two baby shoes full in a glass of Cola for breakfast, two slices for lunch and a small handful for tea. mix this up with moving a bit of furniture around the office a couple of times a week. Hey presto... you know...|`|2RzEaod9aa	A lot of people will tell you to drink it after your workout, but that's wrong. Why? Muscle Milk is made mostly of casein protein. After your workout, you want whey. You have a 1-hour post workout window to best feed your muscles, and whey digests in enough time (about 30 minutes). Depending on your goals, you want 30-60g of whey after your workout. Casein protein, the stuff that's in MM, digests in about 4 hours, so you'll completely miss your window. <br>  <br>  You can take casein anytime (except after a workout), but it's typically taken right before bed. This way, your muscles can use this protein instead of breaking themselves down.<br>  <br>  However, because there are 100% casein supplements (like 100% Casein Protein by Optimum Nutrition), and because there's a considerable amount of fat and sugar in MM, people who have been doing this for a while don't drink MM. 1 scoop of Ultimate Nutrition's Iso Sensation has 30g of whey protein. 1 scoop of 100% Casein by Optimum Nutrition has 24g of casein protein. That same size scoop of MM only has 16g of protein...so what else is in that scoop? <br>  <br>  People only drink MM because they don't know any better and it tastes the best...but so does a milkshake!|`|TjLHnuh3aa	You should drink muscle Milk when someone actually finds a way to Milk A Muscle.  Ive never heard of it.  As far as i know Muscles dont make milk, they just live in a shell in the water and taste pretty nice in a white wine and cream sauce from tescos.  I think they are about ￡5.00, and you can cook them on the Hob or in the Microwave.  I say cook, i really mean Heat up.  But only heat them up once.  I prefer Wasp Milk.. . . or Mustard as it is more commonly known. <br>  Coming Mother!|`|gDTorxV1aa	The most successful trend is to have a scoop 30 min before your workout in milk. An then a scoop immidiately after your workout in water. Because your muscles are tired and you will be empty stomach. The protein will be rapidly absorbed and taken up by your muscles for repair. If your diet doesn't contain enough proteins. Take a scoop with milk in breakfast.|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	you should drink it twice daily<br>  once before the workout<br>  and then after the workout<br>  <br>  you should also take some glutamine before bed|`|AA11640127	you should drink muscle milk when you want to poop. pooping is good. pooping is cool. pooping rules...poop poop poop gotta go poop now bye!|`|T8G7pfPNaa	drink it after you workout don't go past 30 minutes without drinking it because you won't build muscle.|`|iPxkUJ64aa	have one in the morning and one after you workout
2DDED50vaa	My advice would be then don't drink them. You don't need to drink shakes to get adequate protein. If you eat food and get it naturally, you'll be even healthier and it will taste better. Try eating fish and lean skinless meat to get your protein. If you read a book written by a dietician or just ask a diuetician, they'll tell you that supplementation should always be second to getting any nutrient naturally. So don't feel like you must drink a protein shake to get bigger muscles or to get your protein.<br>  <br>  There will be people who will tell you that this is BS and that you must drink/eat hundreds of grams of protein a day. The truth is all your body does with excess protein is turn it to fat just like it does with Carbohydrates and you can actually damage your kidneys and create imbalances in your system by jamming on the bars and shakes which aren't even natural anyway. I've learned all of this information through Registered Dieticians and leading sports physiologists.. A Registered Dietician must attend at least 4 years of college, intern, and then pass a rigorous exam on nutrition and dietetics. Refer to the book listed below.|`|ExRmz2Eyaa	There is a protein shake that you can buy in a tin ready mixed, i get it from Health Pulses, vanilla, chocolate, banana cream, they are really nice, i used to have maximuscle cyclone, but this is just like frijj milk shake. its called 'ABB 50. Body50. its basically 50g protein and the rest is carbs, amino acids etc.|`|PZ9OSv9naa	They pretty much all taste bad.  You just cant breath threw your nose while drinking them.  Then you gulp water immediately after  swallowing the shake. It works since its what i do.

70KKuEtMaa	Funguyy is right.  Doesn't matter how it's done in India; what matters is the individual's intent. <br>  Lighting a candle is a widespread traditional part of a Candlelight service in many churches on Christmas eve. <br>  However an atheist can light a candle for secular reasons;  it sure doesn't make him any closer to becoming Christian.<br>  Stretching your calves and hamstrings by doing "downward dog" sure isn't going to make you hindu. |`|7s5OU7Sxaa	depends on whether a persons just does the physical aspect or gets into the philosophy of yoga which comes from Hinduism.<br>  just doing the poses and postures doesn't make someone a Hindu.<br>  it's not what a person does but the intention behind what a person does.<br>  if someone does something for a health benefit only then that is all they get out of it. <br>  |`|4QiVYcviaa	Yoga is a form of practice that combines meditation, and bodily exercises.

I practice Chi Gung and to me it is very spiritual, however I know many martial artists for whom it is just self defense and a work out.  Really, the spirituality of an action is internal, not in the definition.<br>  <br>  The Christian definition of what constitutes religion is often skewed I would say.  For instance it's hard for them to see Buddha without seeing a God, or for them to see meditation without seeing prayer.  If you want to know about the spiritual nature of an activity, ask the culture practicing it, not a different one.|`|RmkRifovaa	I don't see how yoga can be spiritual.

hqSWUc8uaa	It's a colposcopy. I had one done a few months ago myself.<br>  <br>  Did her doctor say that she has HPV? If she doesn't that's an extremely good thing. But if she does, as another answerer stated, that doesn't automatically mean she's going to get cancer. They are just doing this as a preventative measure. Also, did the dr. say that she had low-grade dysplasia/SIL or high-grade dysplasia/SIL? Low-grade is definitely better, but high-grade doesn't mean you are hopeless, either.<br>  <br>  Tell your friend not to jump to any conclusions at this point. I know it's easier said then done, I freaked out too when they called me and said that my pap was abnormal (Mine was low-grade thankfully, and I've never had an abnormal pap since I started getting them at 16, and now I'm 32!) So I went for my test. On me, they did find pre-cancerous cells, but on a scale of 1-10 (1 being not worried and 10 being EXTREMELY worried) they said that they are still at a 1 or a 2 that mine will develop into cancer. They said that 99 times out of 100, it corrects itself and the next pap is normal.<br>  <br>  The most important things she can do for herself... and start right away... is to take a multi-vitamin, if she isn't already. They also told me to take 800mcg daily of Folic Acid, in addition to the multi-vitamin. Also important is your diet... eating lots of veggies (green and leafy are good) and fruit and drinking water is important. And exercising a little each day will help... a half-hour a day is good, but if you don't have time for that, 10 mins is better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Again, I know it's easier said than done, but try not to worry too much. Stress can contribute to the problem, so remain calm. I just went through a very stressful time the last part of '07 and beginning of '08, and I had my exam in March, at the height of it all, lol... now that I'm under a lot less stress these days, my chances of things returning back to normal on their own are pretty darn good!!! So tell her to keep her chin up, and just be there for her, as you have been!!! <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck to your friend!|`|ldc1Q9Pwaa	i've heard of a lot of young women that have HPV lately. HPV doesn't necessarily lead to cervical cancer, but it's a good idea to avoid getting it by using a condom when you have sex.  also make sure that you get a pap smear regularly. |`|whBhPFWkaa	Just get your gardasil shots and regular pap smears. You should be fine. |`|bspRfskYaa	as long as you're having regular smear tests you will be fine.  No need to worry in between tests
hqSWUc8uaa	I know exactly what you're going through, girlie.... I went through it too, and no matter what everyone says, sometimes there just isn't enough pain killers in the WORLD to help you!!!<br>  <br>  When I was younger, before I went on BC pills (I got my first period 2 months BEFORE my 10th birthday!!!) I too would get cramps SO bad that I would miss 1 or 2 days of school each month cuz they were so crippling. I even had a few times that I vomited I was so sick and in SO much pain. I would just cry and cry for a day or 2. After I got on BC (when I was 16,) I had VERY little to NO cramping, and it also shortened my periods (most of the time my periods lasted 5-7 days) to 3-4 days, and later on it became 2-3 days! (I've been on BC on and off for about 17 years, and have consistently been on it for the past 6 years.)<br>  <br>  It's not a bad idea to talk to your mom about this again. Reassure her that you would not use being on Birth Control as an excuse to have sex (I hope that you wouldn't anyway... but if you do, make sure you still use a condom!) That you want to be on them, first and foremost, for medical reasons only! <br>  <br>  It seems like those that poo-poo the idea of taking BC for alleviating cramps obviously must not get them nearly as bad as I did and you do (and I have a close friend who is the exact same way, too... and she's on the pill for this reason as well) If they even get the cramps at all! (Some women don't... lucky b*tches, lol) :)<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!!!|`|sl7YMrOUaa	If your not having sex, take Advil as directed on the bottle.  Fake hormones should only be used for birth control and not for more than a few years at a time as they can effect your health in later years.|`|729494f68dc6564ef6710dc5275f8984aa	girl just chuck it up take 2 advils b4 pain starts control pills aint for that |`|whBhPFWkaa	Take ibuprofen every 8 hours during your period. It will help alleviate cramps and can stop bleeding by up to 40%.<br>  <br>  Believe me, if you don't need it for birth control purposes, then putting nasty hormones into your body is not the way to go. |`|JqKYNwd1aa	Take Advil... you don't need birth control... i think birth control is too regulate your period.<br>  <br>  and if you REALLY want... go to your grandma or aunt or dad... and tell them not too tell your mom
hqSWUc8uaa	Is it raised like a wart, or is there just a general swelling in there?<br>  <br>  If it's the latter, then you probably just have a swollen gland. You have glands in a bunch of places... neck, underarms, groin... and you might have an infection that your body is fighting off and that's why you end up with swollen glands. If it doesn't go away within a few days on its own, then go to your doctor. In fact, I have the very same thing going on myself right now, my left armpit is sore, and it hurts when I put on deoderant, lol... but it usually goes away in 3 days  (give or take a day)...<br>  <br>  Also, if your body is fighting off some kind of infection, that could explain the fatigue as well (but for myself, I'm always tired, so that doesn't help me, lol...)<br>  <br>  It shouldn't be anything to worry about but as I said, if it doesn't go away in 3-4 days I'd at least call the doctor and find out if you should be seen.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  
YOO5iZMCaa	no it is not<br>  very few real religions consider masturbation a sin<br>  <br>  check this site for Christian views<br>  <br>  www.boysunderattack.com|`|GIjuCLKhaa	Nowhere is it it mentioned in the Scriptures as sinful. If it was, wouldn't it be addressed somewhere?|`|KtcGNAkYaa	NO WAY, it is the best thing for you!<br>  I am a mature guy and I still masturbate 2-3 times a day, masturbation is good for you and keeps you healthy, regular ejaculation keeps the system operating at peak performance and avoids prostate problems in later life! You should not stop!<br>  I also always eat my own cumm, I love the taste and it is full of good protein!<br>  I was christened in the anglican church, but prefer to consider myself agnostic now!|`|qzpQdJ44aa	If you are a Christian then YES!  <br>  <br>  However, masturbation is a very healthy way to release sexual tension especially when no other form of sex outlets are available.  <br>  <br>  I'm not Christian and I don't sin when I masturbate, but you would!<br>  <br>  Common, religion is good at its place and sex at its.

God says that masturbation is a sin, but god is all forgiving. if you feel like masturbating there is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't, and if you feel guilty about it you can always ask for forgiveness. but just remember that you are YOU first and religious second and never let faith blind you from that fact.|`|rAxfXov4aa	Masturbation is a terrible sin. It will make you grow cutaneous horns at the temples, wings and a tail. It will also make you fat, give you acne and turn you gay. Unless, of course, you repent.

kv0M7KTAaa	yes its a  minor uti<br>  <br>  just stop holding your pee<br>  <br>  and b 4 and after sex make sure you use the bath room<br>  <br>  to get rid of it just dont drink anything but water and buy some cranberry pills.. just go to your local drug store. there just simple plain all natural cranberry pills.. then your probalem will go away...<br>  but if u dont cure it now it will start to burn.. if it starts burning do what i said.. drink plenty of water and take cranberry pills<br>  <br>  this happens to me once in a while too...<br>  i hate it..<br>  <br>  i go pee then right when i leave the restroom i feel like i cant hold it and have to run to the bathroom to only have a little drop. lol.<br>  <br>  if it gets worst than just see your doctor but im pretty sure this will fix the problem ! hope i helped !<3|`|O3YQJOFjaa	You should definitely go to the doctor, possibly a urologist.  It could be a UTI.  You are probably developing a form of urinary incontinence; you are experiencing urgency.  This sometimes happens with a UTI.  There are other reasons that this could happen too.  Please go see your doctor, it is unusual for urinary incontinence to happen out of the blue without a cause.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/urinary-incontinence/types.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.org/urinary-incont...</a>|`|EJrM8gr9aa	ive had two UTIs (both when i was pregnant) and neither of them burned when i peed. you should go to the doctor because if it spreads to your kidneys it will be very VERY painful.|`|FgAPXhVRaa	Sounds like a UTI. I have had plenty, and it hurts so bad when I pee... I have one right now that is so bad that I bled. You should go see a doctor and he wil give you antibiotics. If you don't want to see a doctor you can go to Wal-Mart and get this stuff called AZO. It is supposed to clear up UTIs. Good luck!|`|g65GVqnUaa	you might have a bacterial infection and if you do you will need to get some antibiotics<br>  
af5c3a383754171b0788539f8e9a52d4aa	What this sounds like is disassociation from self or image of yourself; perhaps you are spending to much time thinking of & analyzing yourself that you have created a distorted view of who you are; to use an example: an artist who just isn't happy with his art work, as he might be a perfectionist or he might want to be like another artist (comparing himself to others), might spend so much time on his work that he ruins it,<br>  You are obviously finding faults about yourself, & seeing any changes as negative, & also because this might be to painfull for you, you then project the message of your fat onto an imaginary self, rather than owning the feelings & thoughts of i'm fat; over all it really does sound as though you might be creating a distorted picture of yourself through looking at & analysing yourself to much, self obsession is not healthy,spend more time with people & friends that you trust & who care, & express what is going on inside.|`|RLrj2hc5aa	ok honestly the best answer is tell your mom..... stop writing the journal because it is hurting not helping... and when you tell your mom you can leave out some things if you are really afraid of how she will react start by telling her that your looks and weight are bothering you see what she says  if she blows you off thats whe you bring up the fact that you have created this character, the character suggest that you think other people think that way of you also your best bet is that if it is that big of a concern you do need to discuss this with someone to get help before it spirals into an eating disorder or deep depression(which it can) one word of advice is to look in the mirror and write down then good things about your self.. they can be small like I have nice eyes or a nice eye shape or i got nice boobes(they can be silly or stupid but once you have this list when you feel down look at it and say thats right im funny or whatever your qualities are physical and non-physical) but you should approach your mom and just tell her that you just feel fat and ugly and you dont want to eat get help now before you lose control of the situation.. and remember no matter how you see yourself someone out there thinks your beautiful.. hold strong and start telling yourself about the things you like about yourself you may find once you really think about all your good qualities outweigh the bad ..... hope that helps

X2gVtuE7aa	Ask her why she's crying, it might not be related.|`|FhKtIk2Paa	Make sure that your sister has a variety of pads and tampons to choose from, she might not know how to use them- so if there is any menstrating females around have them help her out.

This is a pretty big day for your sis, and for mom as well.  This is the whole 'finally becoming a woman' thing, and can be both scary and exciting for your sis, and a wake up for mom that her baby is growing up....|`|Tp4R14rlaa	AWWW!! Your so sweet!! Don't make her feel awkward because if i were her I wouldn't want to talk about it with a guy. Maybe you can call your mom and let your sister talk to her to get a little more comforatble. Just tell her that it will be over in like 5 or 6 days. Really nothing to worry about. Just let her know that she can tell you anything by spending extra time with her.|`|zxk9pJ6Taa	You are so sweet<br>  ask her if she needs anything from the drug store <br>  hormones are all over the place and she may be really embarrassed<br>  tell her it is a perfectly natural thing and if she needs anything from you that you are there for her|`|7M3JTnbxaa	Please don't talk to her about it. In a while she will be okay with having her period and growing up but right now she is a little overwhelmed.|`|cd37yLuZaa	awwww ur so sweet! try telling her that she can talk about it if she wants and get her pads and stuff, maybe a website like beinggirl.com could help her|`|uXALEpIRaa	If you have any friends that are girls (that are always nice to your sister), maybe ask one of them to help? <br>  <br>  Ask her if she needs to get any "girl products", and offer to get them with her or for her, maybe. <br>  <br>  Good luck! You sound like a good brother!|`|AA11118856	Katy told me it was ok. Just have her ask her teacher.|`|eFkdCBjkaa	Let it go, she can talk to her Mom when she gets back.

I have two older brothers and they probably would have fainted themselves if they were in this situation.<br>  <br>  As awkward as it may be, just let your sister know that it is okay to ask you questions and that you will do your best to answer them.  She is probably really confused and frustrated since there is no women figure around to let her know what her body is doing.<br>  <br>  Just be there for her, if she wants space, give it to her. But let her know that you are there so she feels comfortable in case she decides to come to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S. you are a very sweet boy for asking a question like this. It's adorable that you care so much!|`|RF52FRdyaa	Wow that's tough.  Make sure she has all the necessary things such as: pads, warm bottle of water to press on her stomach in case of cramps.  make sure she isn't cold and whatever you do please don't give her any medication (she may be too young).  Tell her to shower with warm water and change every 3 hours or so. <br>  Other than that I think you should wait for your parents to get home to talk to her.  I know you care, but if its possible, she may need to hear her first "period talk" from someone who has had it, like her mother.  I admire you for being such a protective big brother, make sure shescomfortablee and everything should be fine.|`|lPNP9bt2aa	if you want to help her give her lots of orange juice<br>  you have to be very calm to her not shouting as she will easily cry or easily be hurted <br>  she will have pain down her stomach <br>  cook her  food like soup <br>  help her if she need you <br>  never let her carry heavy things<br>  do not let her in low temperature<br>  so she have to wear worm clothes<br>  so not let her put hot things on her belly like warm water sack<br>  and do not let let drink very very hot thinks like hot tea<br>  a middle temperature tea will help her a lot<br>  do not let her do gym running and so on<br>  if her period come a lot of times after a lot of months she will not be sooooo sensitive <br>  tell her to avoid washing her body <br>  and if she have to be clean she have to be very careful not to let water down there and of course she will be careful about the temperature<br>  take care about her and she will be find after about a week!!!!|`|nsGPMenjaa	I think that is very sweet and noble of you to worry about her like that!<br>  <br>  Just ask her if she is ok. Ask her if she is in any pain. If she says yes, ask her if there is anything she needs from the store that you can get for her. (You may have to actually go and buy here feminine products!) Pick her up a magazine or movie while you are there, too.<br>  <br>  Do you have a girlfriend that your little sister is close to? Or does she have a friend or cousin that she can have over that she is close to? She could talk to one of them.<br>  <br>  Or to take her mind off of it, you could offer to take her and friend to see a movie and out to eat.|`|UWrF944Caa	you are so sweet!<br>  have one of your friends come over, that is a girl and have her talk to yoru little sister about it.<br>  yes, your sister will prob need a pad, so make sure to get some.<br>  and if you dont ahve any friends taht are girls that could come over<br>  then just tell her, hey i know you dont wanna talk to me about it, but is there anything i can do to make this easier for you? i may be a guy, but i can still be helpfull.|`|bv3nQdxBaa	Definitely dont try talking about all of it with her!!! Its just going to embarass her beyond belief! I suggest buying a box of tampons and some pads,  maybe leaving them on her bed or something with some print outs or a book with information about it all. You could leave a little note letting her know you're there if she needs you. This way she knows you're there, but doesnt have to face you and can learn all she wants at her leisure in private.|`|wXJ8ksfMaa	aww that really nice its really touched me :) say to her you know you can talk to me about anything tell her if you ever have any problems or worries cone to tell me ill always be here tell here its nothing to worry about because its all natural and just because its not happened to me i know all about it so dont be worried :) x|`|QiWfid8oaa	u just need to understand its a strange time for a girl. if she is in pain give her some paracetamol and a hotwater bottle.. you will have to go and get her some pads (a horrible task for a guy i know) get the thick ones with wings. have u got another female relative or close friend around to talk to her.<br>  her hormones now will have gone into overdrive thats prob why she is crying.. try not to worry too much|`|ptXRElmoaa	its probably ok, She prob wont want to talk to you.<br>  She could call your mam if she wants,<br>  let her know ur der and all.<br>  By the way its no big deal, Im 17 and I have many times looked after mt younger brother and Ive been doing it for years.|`|GUPKB6Q2aa	i think you're right, she probably feels uncomfortable talking to a guy about it.<br>  <br>  maybe ask a girl-friend to come over and talk to her?|`|X55EHXeVaa	hi daniel,<br>  i'm sure she would appreciate some sanitary towels if she hasn't already got any-sorry for stating the obvious.<br>  <br>  And some painkillers?<br>  How about a nice warm drink and a hot water bottle?<br>  GL!|`|cCdm5GbVaa	o GOD no|`|urJL5tW3aa	no|`|T1Mwtqk6aa	i luv ur protectiveness...<br>  wish i had a big bro like u....XO<br>  dnt say anything if u ask me ...let her talk abt it wen she wants to...|`|31JjkZtEaa	Ok first of all calm down. shell be fine. The period comes to girls naturally she knows what to do. Atleast give her some ibprofin of advil to stop the cramping if she has any. Make sure she eats though. If she doesnt eat shel get sick to her stomach. Let her relax and yea. <br>  any ?s email me ok.<br>  Ashley?|`|9PKyOE1Gaa	Awh! <br>  <br>  Yeah, agree with most of whats been said about phoning your mum, calling in a friend etc to talk to her. It would be weird enough for her to talk to any guy about it, let alone her older brother! (No offence, lol)<br>  <br>  About cheering her up...if she hasnt had friends round you could always ask her if she'd like a sleepover or something with her friends. Keeping tabs on them, obviously, so they dont wreck the place! Lol. Cus maybe then, she might be able to talk to her friends about it and not feel so strange. Its a sensitive/embarrassing subject for some girls so it might be easier talking to them.<br>  <br>  Or, what films/food does she like?

It is her first period and no doubt that she is going to feel a little awkward (uncomfortable) with the situation. However, you can start by saying to her that it is expected of her at her to start seeing her menstruation, explaining to her the do’s and the don’ts/pros and cans ect…and that girls her age or even younger than started seeing theirs so there is absolutely nothing for her to be embarrassed about.|`|YByKKtiPaa	umm no she is probably embarrassed, Jus let her know it is normal, and wait for your mom to come home, seeing that she is 12 you should probably get her pads.. not tampons.. that might make her uncomfortable.. her brother buying tampons that is lol ask her if there is nething she needs or take her for some ice cream :) She is a young lady now! Its not really too big of a thing she may experience cramping so maybe have some midol on hand for her.. :) and a heating pad, warm tea no sugar cause sugar causes cramping! :) (all though icecream is still a ok choice)

yEDR0fnOaa	It is normal for some hair to grow on the base of the penis. Trim it. Don't shave it.|`|gnIEDg6maa	Pubes, hair that grows on the lower abdomen and especially around the genitals at the age of puberty, is normal and most girls prefer that guys leave it as is.  If noticeably heavy hair is actually growing on the shaft of your penis, I would probably remove it but it will be a lifetime job and I would think twice before shaving it.  I don't think stubble would feel very good to a girls vagina or to her fingers.  If it is only at the base or if it a very light growth, leave it alone. It would be like a girl having hair inside her labia. Doesn't happen, I hope.|`|XgO9HUm9aa	Most guys have some on the base of their penis.

V87HfMhuaa	If your nose bleeds more when you're angry it is probably because your blood pressure and heart rate go up increasing your cardiac output and estentially pushing more blood to your nose and out of whatever hole has been created (from trauma to the skin, drying out too much, or maybe something else)  If you don't know what is CAUSING your nose bleeds, and it is happening alot call your doctor.

7fHbzQLOaa	there are numerous things that are available nowadays to help get rid and even conceal red marks "scarring" left over from mild acne. The most powerful and effective is dermabrasion. (A dermatologist will exfoliate your upper dermis to help rid you of scars and create a more even skin tone). You can purchase at home kits (not as effective, but WAY cheaper and gentler to the skin). Using skin care products that promote evening out of the complection is also a good start. Concealers that have a green under tone help rid your skin of redness while waiting for your face to improve. ( ask the cosmetics dept). Last but not least, time will eventually improve your skin"s tone with proper care. <br>  <br>  You will also want to avoid alcohol, acids, and chemical solutions. Alcohols, salicylic acid, Retina-A, and benzoyl peroxide, actually dry the skin; and because they are synthetic, acne-causing bacteria become immune to the chemically created solutions. Why? Because chemical solutions are created to treat the type of bacteria they sought to treat that was in existence when the solutions were made. Unfortunately, bacteria are living organisms and they learn to mutate quickly. When mutation occurs, salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide fail. They also are harsh on the skin and create more scars.

You probably didn't get high because you weren't inhaling deep enough.  It should have made you cough like crazy the first time.<br>  <br>  It is not good for you. It can cause all kinds of cancer, just like cigarettes. It's normal for kids your age to be curious what's it feels like to be high. It's not that great, and maybe it was a sign for you to stop, because a lot people experience extreme paranoia from weed. I think it's best for you to stay from it.  You sound like a real smart kid.  You should enjoy being naturally high! :)|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	No addiction and it isn't good for you except to make you eat like a pig.

We never got married or anything, but I never returned to smoking dope either. <br>  So you can control it.

Q1t0XzgZaa	Discharge is normal for any female. Unless its a massive amount, has an odor, hurts, dont worry about it. If it does do that however, go to a different doctor.

When you go in for blood work you will be asked which medications you take. If you are taking your anxiety meds, be sure to include it on the list of medications.<br>  The blood work isn't that bad, and this is coming from someone that does NOT like needles. You won't feel much, and it will over before you know it. Just look away. That is what I do, and I make it just fine.

WX5mDXgvaa	A tension headache is a dull, aching pain in both sides of the head. Many sufferers say it feels like a tight band around the head or a heavy pressure pressing down on them, these are thought to be caused by chemical reactions in the brain triggered by excessive stress levels.<br>  <br>  Certain foods can trigger tension headaches, including:<br>  <br>  Chocolate<br>  Cheese<br>  Monosodium glutamate (MSG), a flavor enhancer found often in food from Chinese restaurants<br>  Foods containing the amino acid tyramine (found in red wine, aged cheese, smoked fish, chicken livers, figs, and some beans)<br>  Nuts<br>  Peanut butter<br>  Some fruits (like avocado, banana, and citrus)<br>  Onions<br>  Dairy products<br>  Meats containing nitrates (bacon, hot dogs, salami, cured meats)<br>  Fermented or pickled foods<br>  If you suspect that any of these foods cause your headaches, you could follow an elimination diet, eliminating all the items on this list from your diet and then reintroducing them one at a time. Pay close attention to when the number of headaches increases after eating particular foods.

TfbTYc2Laa	Are you using decongestant or antihistamine pills? They dry up sinuses and normal mucus flow turns into a problem. These drugs are not intended for long use but unfortunately some doctors prescribe them for long term use. If this is the case, consider using antihistamine sprays (like Azelastine) and/or natural decongestants. <br>  <br>  Chronic dehydration may also cause this problem. Try increasing your water intake.

VtqdeSQ8aa	Master Cleanse Diet Recipe<br>  <br>  #1 (single serving):<br>  <br>  - 2 Tbsp Lemon (approx ? of a Lemon)<br>  - 2 Tbsp Genuine Organic Maple Syrup (not Maple flavored sugar syrup you'd put on pancakes)<br>  - 1/10 Tsp Cayenne pepper (red pepper)<br>  - Ten oz. glass of hot water (cold can be used if preferred)<br>  <br>  #2 (60 oz. daily serving):<br>  <br>  - 60 oz. water<br>  - 12 Tbsp organic Maple syrup (Grade B)<br>  - 12 Tbsp lemon juice<br>  - ? Tsp Cayenne Pepper<br>  <br>  There are a couple important things to remember when using these recipes. For one, the lemon juice used must be fresh squeezed. This cannot be emphasized enough. It is necessary to use fresh produce. Canned juice won't work and will erase most of the benefits of using this diet. Also, the maple syrup must be organic, Grade B maple syrup, not the sugar filled syrup that is used at the breakfast table.|`|zNn9VfRyaa	why starve yourself for 10 days to lose WATER weight then as soon as u eat something simple u gain it back 10 fold????????????<br>  <br>  <br>  to lose weight u need to eat right and have a workout plan 5-6 days a week.u have to want it. <br>  ***try this u need to change ur diet. <br>  eat six times a day. ea of ur 3 main meals needs to combine a lean protein such as chicken breast ground turkey turkey bacon egg whts also combine that with a complex carb such as a baked potato or sweet potato wild rice brown rice oatmeal or girts. also add fresh fruit and vegies to lunch and dinner. pick fruits low in sugar like pears and berries. if u get canned vegies get ones with low sodium. eat every 3-4 hrs keep ur metablism moving.<br>  ***also the most important part is WATER drink at least 64oz. no soda or juice. water will curve ur cravings. <br>  u need to hit cardio 3-4 times a week running outside it great workout if u can hit a gym and cardio machine is great at least 30mins***<br>  also add weight/strength training 3 times a week.u can google free weight traning guides anywhere. its not hard to find things for free.<br>  ***plan ur meals ahead of time.always have a healthy snack with u so u wont be tempted to eat fast food. also if u wait to late to eat u will get so hungry u will eat the world. make time to work out start out with 30 mins then increase.its ur body treat it right. ur diet alone can help lose weight but working out makes ur body look good. shows muscles and tight skin which is sexy and beautful. stick with it ur body will amaze u!!! to be healthy and look great u need both in ur life. good luck email me if u have further questions

You really should see your doctor as left untreated could cause long term damage.|`|YcWGDKvkaa	I think you may have a kidney problem there.<br>  I suggest you go to a doctor who specializes in that area and check. The doctor might administer some kidney punches to assess any pain on both of your kidneys and you might need to take a urine test as well because there could be some disturbances in your kidney filtration.<br>  <br>  Also ask your doctor for some dietary interventions because since your kidney might be prone to an infection, there are probably some foods out there that you shouldn't ingest in case it makes the filtration of your kidney difficult.|`|rFBjpw8xaa	Have you been drinking enough?

Though, considering you're actualy LEAKING, I'd suggest going, getting tested and if it is so, getting it treated asap.  I haven't had a yi that leaked like that before, so I don't think that's good.

If you store it in the fridge, it can give you more of a relief when you first put it on.<br>  <br>  Mix a half-water, half-vinegar solution and apply it to the burn with a spray bottle or soaked cloth. This will sting a little bit at first, but it definitely pulls the burning sensation out of your sunburn. I know it smells! But it really works!<br>  <br>  Ice packs (in small amounts of time) and cold cloths or compresses will also help to minimize the length of time that you have redness and should help with the swelling.<br>  <br>  Take lukewarm (room temperature) BATHS. Taking showers with too high of a water pressure could increase your pain. Taking a too-cold bath won't help, and will make you freezing.

Niacin causes your skin to flush for about 30-40 minutes depending on the dosage you take. When it makes you flush, it causes your capillaries to dilate and new blood rushes to the surface of the skin. I have heard that this speeds the healing process. Niacin is also used in tanning lotions to help you tan faster...and gives that tingling sensation. A niacin flush can be uncomfortable and alarming the first time you have one, but it is not dangerous. If you try this make sure you don't buy time released niacin, if you do you wont get enough in your system to have a flush. Also, taking it on an empty stomach is more effective than a full stomach.<br>  <br>  <br>  I would also warn you that when you being to feel the flush it will sort of tingle and burn...you will also get splotchy...all of this goes away within an hour or so.

The continuous rubberband you said you got is called a power chain I think. I only had one a couple of times, and I had braces for 3 years. I don't think I ever got a powerchain on the top.

I'm in college full time and I'd have loved to have been able to go to every appointment with her, but I just couldn't do it. Luckily, I was able to take fall semester off and be with her during her final months, but before that, I dealt with the fact that I just did the best I could. Since she is recently diagnosed the anger she is exhibiting is most likely the first stage in accepting her diagnosis and that should pass eventually. Try not to get too overwhelmed.

You can go to a threapist by yourself or with a friend and it will be completly confidential. Something that really helped me when I was depressed was keeping a journal. I recorded all the things that happend in a day, and why/ if i was upset and I wrote down all the positive thing sa about myself, and all the things that were so great in my life.

However if it was a mushroom that was actually growing in your stool...then that might be an issue.|`|C5t4Yp0taa	ewwww did you even eat mushroom?|`|LbJqU82waa	nope!! get it checked
uMlxKEbUaa	Could be strep. It could be a number of things. You definitely need to get to a doctor. If there was pus present then you have an infection that needs antibiotics.|`|tqhr4V33aa	you might have strep throat... hurts like hell and u need antibiotics|`|35cyAIdlaa	Yo you've got Hand, foot and mouth disease. You should definitely get it checked out. It will probably lead to more symptoms similar to the Flu. Go to a doctor this is not something you want to wait on.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
6aa0f7105f19c51829e4f53b2559887eaa	It probably is her period, but especially if you're young, your first few can be really light, no more than spotting. In time it will get to be more.<br>  <br>  Body development doesn't necessarily mean it's her period though, I was fully developed and did not start til I was 15. Everyone's different. She might just be getting ready, not actually having it.<br>  <br>  If she has pink discharge, that's probably blood though, so she should wear a light pad so she doesn't ruin her underwear. And she shouldn't be worried if it happens for a few months and then goes away for a while. That's normal when you first start.|`|g6dflM4zaa	Well it is very possible to be her period.<br>  The brownish spots and so, kinda gives it away...<br>  It is possible. Many girls starts young...<br>  My cousin was 8 when she started.<br>  So I say it is a big possibility...|`|7xc8jgLXaa	Sorry I don't really know a long way to answer this so I will do the best I can:<br>  <br>  That may have been her period but it could also have been just spotting. If it lasted longer than one day (in a row), it was most likely her period. If it was just one day and then nothing, it may have been just spotting which is a definite sign that her period is on it's way within the year (give or take).|`|oAdPL4vWaa	It is just the warning before tsunami
6wGkycFAaa	Not really. The irritation is caused by the acids and alcohols in the products you are using. Yes, you can use them too much. You are burning the skin. It won't increase your acne, but it can lead to other issues such as scarring, infection and premature ageing. <br>  Every single time you use a product, you should be using a moisturizer. Some products will irritate mildly and will be relieved by a moisturizer but if it is really bugging you then you are likely having a reaction.<br>  Read your labels and compare the products you are using. You may find there are similar ingredients in the ones that are really bothering your skin. Don't use those products again. Use of multiple products will cause more damage than good. Find one product that does the job and stick with it. If you are finding it a difficult task, consult a dermatologist. For people with serious acne (in numbers or in type of acne) there are some prescription medications that can solve the problem. <br>  My niece recently went on an 8 week prescription pill through her dermatologist that wiped out her severe acne. She was dried up like a prune and used eye drops, lip balm, moisturizer and drank a ton of water to help relieve the discomfort. But she has beautiful skin now and it was worth the 8 weeks of dryness for her.<br>  I wish you much success and good health.|`|SZjaP5Mcaa	Oh definitely. The more product you use on your face the more it dries out the more oil it produces which causes acne. I reccomend you try neutrogena or clean and clear to help out with your skin. And only wash your face 2 times a day - after you wake up and before you go to bed. Hope I helped!|`|Z7KRAzbeaa	Absolutely!  It's what the dermatologist said to me and my son.  When we stopped doing all the "steps" and stopped using Proactive we got completely better.  The doctor said to use Cetaphil to wash with two times a day.  It's a non-soap and very gentle.  You can buy it at the market or Target.  Also I think we eat better, more nutritiously.  Drink more water.  So,  yes, yes, yes, irritating your skin is not good and yes it can make acne worse.  Be gentle.|`|XNaEyYqtaa	If it makes your skin dry it takes away the oils so you probably wont get more acne if your skin isnt oily.
0be940862a3c253f0432eb848850e14aaa	Yes. If your skin is dry and burning, you need to stop using what you're using. Overdrying your skin is not good and eventually it will start flaking and peeling.|`|GQCDySQLaa	no but its a sign for you stop using those products<br>  if you dont want acne you can wash your face every night and morning|`|CkUjIA1maa	Yes, especially if you scrub too hard or are using too many products. Gently cleanse the skin with your finger tips, and exfoliate once a week or so by using a warm washcloth...but with very little pressure on the skin. <br>  <br>  You also need to find a non-comedogenic moisturizer and use it dutifully every day after you apply your acne medication. You don't want to further irritate inflamed skin, so just be kinder to it!

Some teens around my community participated in the "36-Hour Famine" before. I'm not completely sure whether they were starved or not. I don't think so. Maybe it's just willpower that kept them through and I don't even think they drank any water. Maybe they also kept themselves occupied.|`|1pup885baa	Yes, it will slow down your metabolism. Your body will try to hang on desperately to the calories it has. Fasting to lose weight is a stupid idea - it doesn't work.|`|ysUqQ9Qkaa	No probably not , although it would depend on how much you were eating prior to the fast.  Why would you want to go into "starvation mode?"|`|tb67ss8Naa	You can go 3 weeks without food, so no. BUT it can hurt your body.|`|FyAHNpQbaa	yes. if you don't eat breakfast in the morning, your metabolism is slowed down for the rest of the day. if you're looking to lose weight, don't starve yourself. you'll slow down your metabolism and then when you do eat something, it will take your body longer to metabolize it than if you ate regular healthy meals.|`|AA12227599	Um.....no.
sMWfgyVgaa	There is alot oh home remedies that you can use. I think that the best way is to get a piece of toilet paper and get some rubbing alcohol and put a little of that on the paper and rub thta on your face, you should start to see it clear up the day after.|`|PxohEvTvaa	Well I used to buy facial cleansers and all that fancy stuff<br>  But honestly,the only thing that has worked for me is Tone Coco Butter soap bars. They clear my Acne within 1-3 days..|`|2fYyw4LBaa	The only house hold item would be rubbing alcohol... dab a little bit on the pimple. it'll dry it up quick.|`|3Ppn5228aa	Visine Eye Drops<br>  <br>  They get the red out, that’s for sure, but not only for your eyes but your acne as well!  Just put a dab of the stuff on a q-tip and apply that to your face.  Keep it on for a few seconds, let it sink in and it should help to get rid of the redness.|`|0WHJhEXZaa	Hey, I understand your frustration!<br>  <br>  I bought numerous anti-pimple/acne products but it doesn't help at all!

WJAA0jTkaa	you should put 2 times a day starting with upper part of body specially shoulders and hands.<br>  This will help you in muscle gain if you contiue it for atleast 4-5 months atmost.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|KHFpM2jcaa	the only way you are going to see results is if you put in hard time at the gym, but it takes years.  You should only take the protein when you lift consistently.  <br>  <br>  Look at it like this.  when you lift weights you break down muscle tissue.  your body uses protein to repair the muscle that has broken.  when your body recovers it try's to build more muscle then it previously had so it wont get damaged again by doing the same routine.<br>  <br>  you should really be careful about supplements too.  Just stick to the omega 3 fatty acid like flack seed oil, a good low fat and low carb protein supplement, and a good daily vitamin.  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind you are very skinny so you are going to have to up the calories for your body to respond and allow itself to put on muscle.  but they need to be good calories not burgers and fry's.  <br>  <br>  You should really take the protein a soon as possible after you finish lifting and maybe in the morning with breakfast ( though you should really have egg whites instead of a supplement).  The rest of what you consume should be from the proper foods.   <br>  <br>  If you are starting out the best advice is to get a GOOD trainer at a gym and read muscle health magazines try and copy the work outs and ignor the ads about supplements and keep it fun.<br>  <br>  Remember you are young.  so you are just getting to the point where your body is actually capable of starting to get into that kind of shape.  don't rush it or you could really hurt yourself, and don't fall for the steroids crap either.  Those are for people who don't what to put in the time and effort into doing things the right way and believe me they pay for it in the long run.|`|uTPeYO4kaa	hard time at the gym always ends with results...just make sure you're giving your muscles enough time to rest...especially your chest and back..3 days min. rest....take a serving of the whey immediately before your work out and immediately after your workout...you want more protein that this throughout the day though...if you weigh 125 and want serious gains you need to consume 250 grams of protein a day...eat a lot of lean meat...boneless, skinless chicken breast and fish will be the best for you...do a research on the protein contents of fish and find the one with the highest and eat it...most professional body builders chose orange roughy but i know where i am orange roughy is hard to find....canned tuna is packed with protein! also if you can't reach your protein needs with food, drink another serving of your whey later on in the day...as for the answer above..you won't get much gains with 1lb/1g ratio...that's more along the line of maintenance.|`|DQ1CCOazaa	If you hit the gym hard and intense youll see results within a month. Its not always about that, to gain muscle most people have a rule of thumb about protein: 1g/1lb of body weight. So if you want to gain muscle and weight, eat a gram of protein for every lb you weigh. Whey protein is very good for gaining muscle, but for gaining weight i would advise you to get a gainer. Cytosport Cytogainer works really well, and that is what i take. If you want to gain muscle pay attention to protein in foods. 1 cup of milk=8 g of protein, 1 ounce of beef- 7g of protein. All dairy products are high in protein, as are all oat products. Eggs are also very good. Google high protein foods for more information.|`|JsGX1bfRaa	Concentrate on mass building exercises (ones that work large muscle groups) like bench press, squats and back rows. Do them first in your workouts. That will give them priority. Also get sufficient rest. Rest is one thing many overlook and wonder why they aren't getting any bigger. To get big you have to train hard and enough rest for your muscles to fully recover. That is one reason bodyuilders always will not train the same muscle two days in a row (referred to as a "split routine").|`|zNn9VfRyaa	weight gain is as difficult as weight loss. u need to eat protein all day. have a protein shake at least 3 times a day. eat tons of egg whts chicken breast turkey bacon ground turkey u also need good carbs such as baked potatos sweet potato drown rice oatmeal grits also as u know water is important as well as cardio
3Z2S4aNjaa	Yes, the lack of fluids during training or any physical activity could cause cramps in the legs. Another thing that could cause cramps (and charley hoarse's for that matter *Really bad and painful cramps*) is the lack of potasium.

If you HAVE to munch on something, chew gum, celery (w/o toppings) or carrots since they're pretty much just empty calories and makes you full faster.<br>  <br>  Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and to keep your body from retaining too much water weight. <br>  <br>  Do about 1 hour of cardio/aerobic exercise every other day and weight lift on the other days, take a break on Sunday so your body can recuperate and your muscles have a chance to repair itself before you break it up again. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|zNn9VfRyaa	to lose weight u need to eat right and have a workout plan 5-6 days a week.u have to want it. <br>  ***try this u need to change ur diet. <br>  eat six times a day. ea of ur 3 main meals needs to combine a lean protein such as chicken breast ground turkey turkey bacon egg whts also combine that with a complex carb such as a baked potato or sweet potato wild rice brown rice oatmeal or girts. also add fresh fruit and vegies to lunch and dinner. pick fruits low in sugar like pears and berries. if u get canned vegies get ones with low sodium. eat every 3-4 hrs keep ur metablism moving.<br>  ***also the most important part is WATER drink at least 64oz. no soda or juice. water will curve ur cravings. <br>  u need to hit cardio 3-4 times a week running outside it great workout if u can hit a gym and cardio machine is great at least 30mins***<br>  also add weight/strength training 3 times a week.u can google free weight traning guides anywhere. its not hard to find things for free.<br>  ***plan ur meals ahead of time.always have a healthy snack with u so u wont be tempted to eat fast food. also if u wait to late to eat u will get so hungry u will eat the world. make time to work out start out with 30 mins then increase.its ur body treat it right. ur diet alone can help lose weight but working out makes ur body look good. shows muscles and tight skin which is sexy and beautful. stick with it ur body will amaze u!!! to be healthy and look great u need both in ur life. good luck email me if u have further questions|`|mT4dpQRUaa	Have you heard about acai berry and total cleanse?

74e542f00dc27cdbe7595f52050a58a7aa	Not wothout getting a clearance from your doctor. Sacroilitis is a general diagnosis for( forgive the pun) a pain in the butt. It is usually caused by inflamation, but there are a number of conditions that can give this diagnosis. If yours is from inflamation I don't think any massage below L3-4 would be advised.pp
TQVMAZUbaa	Andrew-<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to hear about your condition.  I know that living with conditions such as yours can sometimes be difficult, primarily because of uncaring people that you encounter.<br>  <br>  My 6-year old daughter has a similar condition that affects her 5th cranial nerve, so she cannot lift the left side of her mouth.  Oddly though, it was not present in her earlier childhood and did not present itself until she was about 3, although we cannot account for what may have caused it.  <br>  <br>  We have been to numerous specialists, including cranio-facial surgeons and pediatric neurologists at UCLA.  Some have suggested that there may be a way to circumvent the nerve and reroute other nerves to help the problem, but in her case, they believe that her problem is not severe enough to take such a drastic measure.<br>  <br>  Fortunately, she has been spared (so far) from much of the teasing that you have encountered.  I fear what she may face as she gets older.<br>  <br>  I hope you have the resources to contact a neurologist and investigate what possible corrective measures might be available for you.|`|CHj4rBSaaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7sK27iSEos" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7sK27iSE...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  your answer sucks
1pup885baa	Absolutely not. Don't do it. Don't listen to anyone who tells you it's good for weight loss, or that it will help you "detox", it's complete BS. <br>  <br>  Fasting will just slow down your metabolism - to lose weight, you want to speed up your metabolism, not slow it down.|`|LywVUxsTaa	Not usually.

CuVnpxh3aa	I have had 6 or 7 of them, I've lost count. They do spray your throat but they also put an IV in your arm and give you medication that puts you out. You won't even know when they put the thing down your throat and you won't have a gag reflex. You will wake up groggy in the recovery and stay there an hour or so depending on how long it takes you to be fully awake. They will give you some juice and maybe a cracker (depends on the Dr) before you leave. You will have a bit of a sore throat for a day or 2 but you won't remember the endoscopy. I get them about once a year for Gastroparesis (a digestive disorder). You have nothing to worry about.|`|22y6SH5paa	I had one, but fortunately I was getting a colonoscopy at the same time, sort of a double teaming if you will, so i was knocked out.
fAFXkikAaa	Is it possible that you gave him genital herpes?  Yeah.<br>  <br>  But if both he and you have cold sores, then there is NO WAY to know whether or not he caught it unless he has symptoms.    A blood test will reveal that he has HSV1, but it can't show whether that infection is oral or genital or both.<br>  <br>  If he has HSV1 orally, and HAD IT BEFORE HE MET YOU, then the chances that he caught your herpes genitally is quite small.  His body will already have antibodies built up against HSV1, and it would be VERY unlikely that he would have then caught it on his genitals. <br>  <br>  If he never had a cold sore before, and just caught HSV1 orally from you, then I would say chances are pretty good that he did indeed catch genital herpes from you.   Clearly, you would have been contagious (since you gave him oral herpes) and he would have no immune defense (since he only caught oral herpes the day before.)<br>  <br>  I'm sorry.  All you can do it sit tight and keep an eye open for symptoms.|`|HHyny0JSaa	Keep an eye on it. But absolutely do not engage in any oral sex while you are broken out. You can pass the herpes virus that way. Then you will have genital herpes|`|fk9AvB25aa	You can get cold sores easily from kissing some one or receiving a kiss from some one that gets them. You could have had cold sores since you were a child from that family member giving you a kiss. Your boy friend could have gotten them the same way as well or from a past partner.<br>  If there was no out break at the time you gave him oral then there would be less of a chance of passing it on but still a slightly small one. It's also easier for women to have oral herpes passed to the genitals then it is for men but still it can happen, more so if there is an out break of cold sores at the time you gave oral. <br>  Herpes usually takes about 2-14 days to show symptoms, but if he hasn't by then that doesn't mean that he may not have herpes. Your body can suppress herpes for long periods of time, even after contracting it.<br>  If symptoms do appear then he should get the out break tested by a doctor for herpes. If you have a blood test done too soon then he may not have enough antibodies built up in his blood to give him a positive result (antibodies for herpes takes about 3-6 months to build up).<br>  You can use over the counter creams like Abreva or Lipactin. I have heard 3 percent peroxide diluted and swabbed on with a q-tip can work too. Also don't kiss or have oral sex while you have a cold sore, wait until it completely heals and goes away.|`|3XABixiQaa	INSTEAD OF GIVEN NECK U SHUD OF BEEN IN CHURCH PRAISEN DA LORD I BET U GO TO CHURCH NEXT SUNDAY WON'T U GO GET CHECKED A.S.A.P|`|Nv4zY8Bbaa	Cold sores are painful and slightly disfiguring as they can cause scarring. Treat fever blisters at the first signs of outbreak to help reduce the effects of the virus. <br>  Apply ice or an over the counter cold sore medication as soon as you feel a tingling or burning sensation on your lips or other part of your face. You can try a home remedy by applying the gel from break up a piece of Aloe Vera plant to the eruption. <br>  <br>  Treat the sore carefully and take precautions not to break open the blister.

As a precaution and I take the same because I get cold sores too.  Is to refrain from having any contact with your partner or anyone else during an outbreak. Like no kissing, sharing drinks, or oral sex until that cold sore is gone.  Ive been in the same relationship with my girlfriend for 4 years now and she has not contracted herpes in the genital area and she gets regularly tested for it.  <br>  <br>  So just take those precautions and you and your boyfriend should be fine.  Herpes outbreaks have a lot to do with your immune system so keeping that strong will help with how often outbreaks occur.  There is also over the counter ointments you can buy either abreva or a medicated blistex which should help them heal a lot faster.  <br>  <br>  I would get tested though just because herpes is a tricky virus and it can lie dormant in a persons body.  Like I said we get tested regularly and we use this company called National Health Testing, www.nonprofitstdtesting.org, they're good and know what they're talking about.
pIvN6TY7aa	I've done a lot of research about mental health issues, and I've never heard of a "depression part" of ADHD.  Wellbutrin is a good anti-depressive medication, but it does have a tendency to make a person sort of jumpy.  <br>  <br>  Don't be sure your daughter is taking meds because you see the pill going into her mouth.  There are a dozen ways I've seen of not swallowing that pill. (I can say, with some joy, that I've always taking my meds unless my physician and I decide otherwise.)<br>  <br>  It sounds to me as if your daughter may have a "mixed-states" aspect of Bipolar Affective Disorder. Lamotrigin is a mood stabilizer that has become popular because it seems to fewer (or at least different!) side-effects than some others.<br>  <br>  Using cannabis as a way of "self-medication" can be surprisingly effective.  If, in fact, ADHD is a problem, the mellowing effect may be helpful in the classroom. (It's not so good for concentration, and the mind may not be as focussed as one l would like.) But as alternative to the "speed" (Ritalin/Dexadrine), it sounds a lot easier on the mind and the body. <br>  <br>  It's always a good idea to pick your battles carefully.  Whether your daughter is smoking pot is one of the least important of the issues facing the two of you.  Inappropriated prescribed and administered medications is a very serious issue.  Maintining ongoing a non-controntative and compassionate relationship with your daughter, rather than "sweating the small stuff", and risk alientation and loss of understanding. <br>  <br>  Your daughter may consider herself to be something of an adult, but she is your girl-child, and will be as long as both of you live.  PLEASE, don't deny her mother-love.  PLEASE!<br>  <br>  There has been a lot of anti-cannabis propaganda by those who are taking the easy way out.  Instead of working on real problems (cocaine, crystal meth, heroin), they make a lot of much easier cannabis arrests and 'enforcement'. (Something like 1/3 of the people in the US are there for a cannabis conviction. Why are there so few convicted of trafficking dangerous chemicals?)  Check it out in ANY neighbourhood. (Our previous Provincial Premier was encouraged to resign when, after of use, his son had the bad judgment to exceed the protection he had been given for his cocaine habit, and sharing with his friends.)<br>  <br>  I'm not a silly teen-ager. I'm almost 60, have been suffering from Bipolar Affective Disorder for several decades, and have devoted a lot of my life to understand this terrible and sometimes incomprehensible diseases. I'm not silly: I'm have come to be a respected member of the community. (But whilst I write, I weep.) Thank God my own daughter has not been seriously affected, and has become a public health nurse, loved and valued.<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like there is significant misinformation in your situation. The physician your doctor has been seeing seems to have a few gears slipping.  A second physician's opinion could be useful to help you and your daughter understand and manage her condition.<br>  <br>  It would be a great source of relief to you if you were to check out some of the 'Medical Marijuana" websites.  I think the Welbutrin may be a more significant concern than marijuana.<br>  <br>  I've gone on at great length, because it's a very important issue.  If I may be of help, please don't hesitate to e-mail me.|`|9fo3B5U1aa	Be her parent not her friend! She has enough of them I bet. And it sounds like they`re bad company for her. If she wants to hang out with losers and get high. They will find a time and place for it. Don`t be so NAIVE!  And quit making excuses for her!|`|OBT3C4zHaa	Simply drug test her, you can buy drug tests from Longs or nearly anywhere else. A large amount of teens smoke pot or use other drugs, I was one of them, in high school and I'd have to say at least 65% of the school at LEAST smoked pot.<br>  <br>  Just look for red eyes, laziness, eating a lot. But those aren't all telltale signs. I got caught numerous times by my parents because they could smell it, that's a dead giveaway because the smell is so unique.<br>  <br>  I'd test her but make sure she doesn't mix the urine with water because that can cause the test to come up clean even if she is positive for marijuana.<br>  <br>  Are you sure it's not cigarettes? Could be that too. I pray for you that it isn't Meth though.|`|Q4NFFBizaa	who cares, if your teen is just smoking weed then you probably just over reacting. Don't worry nothing will become of this except she might gain some weight. There are a lot worse things she can be doing. I know it might seem like the end of the world to you right now, but trust me its not and it will be ok. So here are some hints, does she smell, or is she using lots of perfume to mask a smell? Are her eyes always red? Is she eating a lot more then normal? Is she always asking for money, usually like $40 or $20, these are pretty standard weed prices? All of these could be signs she is using. However did you ever think she is just rebelling because you are over-protective? I mean to drug test a 15 year old, thats pretty low. Sit her down and let her know you know and your ok with it. Tell her you would like her to stop but it is her choice and her life. Tell her there are consequences for smoking weed. Also tell her she should take her meds but don't force her and don't yell at her because she will just shut you out. good luck!|`|7RSPdBe0aa	All teengares experiment with drugs and weed.  Don't worry, she sounds like a good kid.|`|AA10620246	It sure sounds that way. You need to have your daughter take a drug test. They are readily available at most drug stores. You can even get a drug test that will test for several different drugs (marijuana, opiates, amphetamines, cocaine, etc). Regardless of the test results, she shouldn't be hanging around with these "friends" you mentioned. You are going to need to keep her on a very short leash until she demonstrates some responsibility.|`|eceLQUj5aa	Ummm have you tried talking to her about it? Not yelling or being anger, talking like one adult to another?<br>  <br>  I know she is only 15 but she isnt going to respond well if you start flipping out and treating her like she is 3. Tell her you were snooping, you saw the message about smoking. Apologize for snooping, tell her how concerned you are about her. Ask her to talk to you about what is going on, if she isnt ready to do it then tell her you will still be here when she is ready to. Find out if her medicine will mixed poorly with any kind of drugs warn her about the dangers they would pose in relation to the medicine. Show her the sources, dont yell the information at her, encourage her to look at them herself.<br>  <br>  <br>  OMG, I just read nicole's answer. Please, be honest with your daughter, tell her you are concerned, but don't you dare start forcing testing on her without having the discussion about why first. You need to have a dialog with your daughter, not a mom-freak-out-fest. And for the record, weed is NOT addictive, it is NOT a gateway drug, and NOT everyone binge eats or looks/acts "stoned." Please, read the website below and learn more about marijuana<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/marijuana/factsmyths/" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugpolicy.org/marijuana/fact...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  You don't smoke just a "hit" of weed. This sounds more like meth. You need to have a discussion with her about this pronto. Tell her you saw the message, tell her you want to talk about it when she's ready. In the mean time, go to the doctors or some other drug rehabilitation place and find printed materials on meth/weed and give them to her.<br>  <br>  Also, based on the time table you set up earlier, she may not have wanted to smoke anything. Don't assume she is abusing drugs right off the bat, give her the chance to explain herself.
2iAAczdyaa	Pull up you big boy panties and toughen up. Both are barely felt with the needles they have now. What is wrong with you? It is barely a tiny pinch nowadays.|`|bet4Cugjaa	If your afraid of these both, then your mind hella tricks you and they can both feel pretty weird.<br>  But if the doctor gets your vain the first try, and does it correctly, giving blood only has a tiny weird feeling pinch. So i would having to say getting a shot hurts more.|`|3d2ce992f7a4d06120c7b88f85ef2ee1aa	I think getting a shot is more painful, the injection site is always very sore.|`|5mWZrA97aa	i?think?giving?blood<br>  =]|`|GQCDySQLaa	for me maybe the shot<br>  but i hate getting blood taken out because i can smell it and i get dizzy<br>  but either way is uncomfortable because it involves needles =/|`|CuVnpxh3aa	If you keep your body relaxed when getting a shot, it doesn't hurt at all. I think getting an IV hurts more than anything. I have never given blood, they won't take it because I am always anemic so I can't answer about giving blood but I think the worst is getting an IV. My veins are small and always dehydrated so they are hard to get and when they finally get them the vein blows pretty fast so drawing blood is a chore for the lab. My brother and sister used to give blood all the time because they have a negative blood type but now they can't because of medical reasons.|`|S3lvnRwfaa	Giving blood doesn't hurt at all.  As the old joke goes, it's only a little prick.<br>  <br>  Whether or not getting a shot hurts depends on two things:  where on the body it is given, and what is being injected.  It can vary from completely painless to pretty nasty.|`|kLkzBbeAaa	Getting a shot hurts more especially if the one giving it pushes the syringe too fast when giving blood they usually do it so much it is usually painless.|`|cgICP4gGaa	giving blood|`|bcb975a6a5422a999658b591957e3b9faa	of course getting a shot, giving blood does not hurt at all
4ZE8RG7Waa	Pain on urination is a fairly common problem. It is most often caused by an infection somewhere in the urinary tract.<br>  <br>  Urinary tract infection <br>  Urethritis (in men) caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia <br>  Prostatitis <br>  Interstitial cystitis <br>  Candidal dermatitis or vaginitis <br>  Contact dermatitis or vulvitis <br>  Radiation cystitis <br>  Urinary retention <br>  <br>  Have a look online for each condition|`|TQVMAZUbaa	I doubt that you'll find someone on this board who will be able to provide a better answer than your doctor.<br>  <br>  However, it is true that urinary tract infections and venereal diseases can cause the symptoms that you describe.  I'm sure there are other potential causes as well.|`|NaCLfRDCaa	It could just be a yeast infection, I wouldn't worry just go to your doctor and get checked out.
W49bJtWraa	You've just got them on, they will obviously hurt. Take painkillers, that's what i did. The pain will soon go.|`|0xp9Oobnaa	it will hurt for a while and during the operation when you have to open your mouth really wide when they shove their hands in there, but when you start to wear retainers they do hurt a bit when you first time use them, then you will get use to it and if you haven't wear them for long time and you put it in our mouth then it really hurts. so which means you have to get new retainers to make them fit, thats if you haven't worn them for long time.|`|sm8io0Kbaa	Spacers hurt like a mofo, possibly even more than the braces, as I recall. Braces will probably always make you a little sore for a day or two after they adjust them. But the rest of the time you should be great. Eat soft foods and take a painkiller like ibuprofen or Tylenol.<br>  <br>  If you're sore right now, it's either bc of the spacers, or because your poor teeth aren't used to being held in place like that (weird, I know). But it'll get better.|`|6D4MqIrxaa	Yes, they will hurt for a couple of days. Take asprin or tylenol to help relieve the pain. I also suggest eating soft foods like soup and ice cream. I know its painful, but its so worth it in the end! You will love the result! Best of luch!|`|QKHzAoP3aa	Yeah, they will hurt for a little bit. :( I had them too a few years back!!!<br>  <br>  Its worth it though.  :D
yE2vM76naa	Internal medicine.....well, that's a huge topic, could be anything other than the skin literally....so you are going to have to narrow it down as far as an organ system or a process, and work your way from there.....<br>  <br>  Just remember, a thesis says "Here is the issue I am presenting, this is why its important, and this is HOW I'm going to present it to you" - and don't vere from that formula, it really perturbs editors to no end.
6aa0f7105f19c51829e4f53b2559887eaa	Yup.<br>  <br>  Normal discharge can be clear, white, off white, watery, creamy, sticky, or stretchy. You can have a lot or a little.<br>  <br>  Green, yellow, clotted, frothy, or really smelly discharge is not okay and calls for a doctor's visit.|`|cSQV0RnCaa	Women have all kinds of discharge but the most common is clear. If you start to see any kind of color change see your doctor.|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	I cant answer for ALL women, but I think majority of women do. Its totally natural, nothing wrong. Some have a yellowy color, it just depends....
0BX8Lozkaa	It really comes down to your personal decision...all I can advise is to give up drinking for a few days....sounds like your system needs to clean out.   I have dranken too much many a times....my sickest time I puked bile and whatever I tried to drink after that (inlcuding water) I didn't drink or eat anything for about 12 hrs and I was ok after that. Dehydrated but ok.  If what you have doesn't seem very life threatning, but you want to be seen a dr. try an urgent care if you have one near you.
L3CJ0sUQaa	Did these things you spend time worrying about really happen, or were you just worrying that they would or could?<br>  <br>  Not to make you worry further, but may I suggest prescription drugs aren't always the answer.  Sometimes, they can even create new fears. <br>  <br>  To cure your phobias you have to confront the issues directly.  You say you've spent months at a time worrying about individual problems.  I suggest talking to someone about your fears as soon as they arise.  Knowledge is power and until you can understand why you feel the way you do, you will live in fear of the unknown.<br>  <br>  Best of luck mate.  Live with hope not fear!|`|xqQO81Omaa	Perhaps talk to your p-doc about changing your meds and also what kind of therapy are you having? Is it cognitive behaviour therapy or another type?|`|li9tUaaLaa	Therapy|`|ZcHzNX4Uaa	blind fold yourself when your at home you will be to worried to walk into walls than about those things trust me this one work ive ocd all my life this works|`|lVk3ZSnEaa	Does it do any good to worry?|`|YT9vgUNbaa	This is really not helpful, I know, but I really hope someone can help you with it!<br>  My husband is terribly OCD (in this case it's quite genetic) and it drives both of us crazy! He worries about much different things than what you just described (mostly regarding money, moving, and body image) but the same principles apply. We've been married for almost 4 years and I feel like I've tried everything except actual medical treatment for it. - He's talked to a doctor, but they're very hesitant about prescribing anything for it, and he's SO OCD he doesn't want to follow through with the tests, lol!<br>  Good for you for at least getting medicated for it. :)<br>  The only advice I can offer, which probably won't help, is to think a lot of happy thoughts. Disneyland, a tropical island somewhere, whatever floats your boat. It might distract you a little from your worrying.<br>  <br>  Ah, I just thought of something. I'm not particularly OCD myself, but have always had difficulty sleeping because I do tend to worry and have feelings of guilt in the evening...<br>  Try making stories. Not necessarily writing them down, though that would help. That way you're putting your mind in a fictional place. Add a little bit to the story every evening (or whenever you worry most) to get your mind off it. Focus on the feelings of the characters if you can. Fanfiction works great for this, since the characters are already there and thus doesn't require a lot of originality, but still takes imagination. <br>  Works wonders for me.<br>  My husband plays several musical instruments, and it also helps a little... at least for a time.|`|LtiOm442aa	Dude, OCD is like asthma, it's a permanent disease. I have a slight case of it too, I process EVERY possible outcome to EVERY action I make before I do it, You'll just have to get over and live life to the full and keep reminding yourself that those things you worry about will never happen even if you know they're gonna happen.|`|9tMFZ0Jsaa	No concerta cant make OCD worse but it CAN make you gay and give you cancer.
cxcDP97qaa	One of the best things to do (and since you are young, I know you are going to say something like "that's for girls" but try it), is to try YOGA.  I know, it's not what the cool kids are doing but I guarantee if you do that, you will get more ripped and become much stronger than most of "the other kids".  You can find a decent workout called YRG (Yoga for Regular Guys/Gals).  It's about $35 USD I think?  What yoga will do is strengthen your core.  Your core is one of the most important things that you want to be strong.  Once you do that, then you can hit the weight room every other day if you'd like (still doing yoga though), so you can get that "sexy" look.<br>  <br>  And just stay away from sit ups...yoga should get to your abs just fine but sit up are the worst things for your back AND abs.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: I'm editing this to put facts straight because the guy a few posts down was explaining about genes.  Don't listen to anyone that says "genes will cause this".  It has been PROVEN to not be genes, but these things called EPIGENES.  These things are influenced by the ENVIRONMENT.  So basically, whatever you eat will influence these genes more (on top of many other environmental factors).  <br>  <br>  Also, I wanted to add this too.  If you are going to be lifting weights, try to be off balance while doing the work outs.  A good thing to do is get a bosu ball and stand on that when doing arm curls, shoulder work outs, etc.  Find a stability ball and lay your back on that and take some dumbbells and do some chest presses.  Try to make sure all your work outs revolve around the bosu ball or the stability ball.  That's the new thing and everything that guy posted down below is all old school stuff that won't get you as good of results nor will it work as fast as what I've stated.  Like I said, core is key and if you involve your core in everything, you will be burning off fat like butter melting on toast.|`|xqQO81Omaa	It's average for a male and very lean for a female.|`|5179a1324042a48534d847e9c5593c69aa	you need around 6% body fat to get abs. some people just dont have the genes to get abs, so dont become sad. <br>  tighten your stomach muscles, pinch the fat on your stomach and pull, thats how much fat you have to lose to get abs. <br>  <br>  maybe you'll get strong arms, biceps, tricpes, shoulders, chest and back. and no abs. <br>  <br>  to lose weight, run(warm-up, stretch, do 8 100m sprints, rest 5 mins, jog slowly for 2km-10km or 20-45 minutes)<br>  to get abs do sit-ups/crunches. <br>  and crunches to the side(rotate torso so the elbow is a few cm off ground, and other elbow is pointing away)<br>  try ab cycles. search them up online. <br>  the abs are just one long muscle, so doing different exercises will help stimulate growth, but you dont need to do different ones for different parts. <br>  also do push-ups and bicep curls, squats and exercises for the other body parts. muscles burn more fat over the day than just running, and more muscle will lower your body fat, by burning the fat and stretching the skin with built muscle. <br>  <br>  Shapefit.com has some good resources on exercises.|`|DNltTUBhaa	Abdominals, 300 daily by just one to three repetitions of various exercises, your weight is fine, fat, you can get a little more fat-free diet.<br>  Your routine should be fine.<br>  espa?ol|`|ASXeYOjAaa	At your age a really wide variation is normal - so wide they don't even consider it a factor except in extreme cases.<br>  For an adult, 17% is pretty good (athletic for a woman)
943a06379672bf66a6adfd4e61f757a4aa	There really isn't an easy yes  / no answer to that. The cyst won't kill you, but it should be kept track of. Often cysts in the liver and kidney will show as benign for months, even years, but suddenly become cancerous. Usually it becomes one of the slower moving forms of cancer, but left untreated it will kill. Just have an ultrasound done each year to keep track of any growth in it, and you will have time to decide when and how to treat it, if that ever becomes needed. Unless it's very large, you will have plenty of notice before something will need to be done about it.
WrUTuQdlaa	No. Cutting overall caloric intake or exercising is the only way.
h7sKPAWGaa	depersonalization is usually anxiety based, most people i know who have suffered through this have had a lot of help by dealing with anxiety whether it be a change in their lifestyle or taking medication for it. trust me when i say your not going crazy, this is more common than a lot of people think and has no link to psychosis or anything

You may even find that you have LOST Weight. One day I ate a Ham and Cheese Omelette with Home Fries, and Bacon, and then we went out to lunch and I had a cheeseburger and Fries..BIG MISTAKE I thought. But when I had my weigh in, I lost 2.8 pounds! Go figure that one out!|`|62AmEz1zaa	Cheating is ok.  If your body is craving something then don't deprive it or else you will go overboard all the time.  I cheat once in a while and especially at PMS time which drives me nuts but as long as I keep up the exercising, it will burn it off.  Thirty minutes of cardio a day is great.  Don't kick yourself for it.  Good luck at your weigh in.

uMlxKEbUaa	Find a creative way to express yourself. It sounds lame but it really helped me. My father molested and raped me from infancy until I was 8. I was a very physically violent child and teen. I went to therapy and went on medication and none of it helped me. Finally, I began writing poetry. It was really brutal poetry, but it still helped. <br>  <br>  If your homicidal thoughts continue or get worse, call your therapist or go to a mental health facility.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	You should get your psychiatrsit and your gyn together via phone conference to figure out which medications are safe for pregnancies.  There are some but both doctors need to know what the other is planning.  Do  a three way call so that you also know what they are saying and what they are thinking and also so that they can together know your thoughts on the situation.  That way you can figure out something that will work for you.  But the first thing that you have to figure out is are you really ready to deal with a child if you don't have your own mental health under control.  I know how hard that can be. I've raised three girls while dealing with major depression but I always made sure that I had a doctor and a therapist on hand and made sure that my girls had someone besides me to talk to.  Dealing with a pregnancy and mother hood while also having to deal with depression is changeling but it can be done.  My oldest daughter's are now 34 and 30 and even the one with developmental delays lives on her own and has a job.  The middle daughter has her own apartment job and is getting her master's in education.  The youngest is only 16 1/2 and is a junior in high school doing very well and wanting to become a psychologist with in the next 10-15 years.

You should be able to ask your psychiatrist to start you on either Citalopram or Fluoxetine for the first half of your pregnancy, and move you onto a Tricyclic for the remainder.|`|WEM5n41Oaa	Congratulations!  That's great news.  I have crazy thoughts too.  Sometimes they scare me.  Just don't do it.  It's that simple.  God will stand between you and doing something that crazy.

They can be quite a turn-on if you ask me.  My husband and I still occasionally give each other hickeys but we try very hard to put it where it can easily be covered up.  For young couples I think it is a "cool thing" to have because it shows you were lucky enough to be making out with someone else.|`|Z7KRAzbeaa	I think if it's on a persons neck (highschool stuff) the person is just kind of showing off, bragging in a way that they had some fun, that they have a BFor GF.   And if a person has hickies on places that it doesn't show, well then I think they like the sensation of having it done, and perhaps it makes them smile and remember the "great time" while they go about their day and wait anxiously for the next time.  <br>  <br>  ps.  it's really easy to get them, can kind of happen by accident, it's not like you expressed "sit there while someone sucks on your neck".  I guess it matters how "fair" a person is.  Never thought about it before whether some people get them easier than other people.  But trust me that it's not boring..or at least it shouldn't be.  You've got kind of the wrong idea on it.  They can happen kind of by accident too.|`|e549a7f848bc25ac145a744db895fb5faa	It's just a way to tell the world "look I had somone sucking on my neck last night" without having to come out and say it.. pretty much just to brag.|`|MkfAD8Y2aa	cause its a sign that these 2 are sexually active|`|Czpfs8RLaa	well I sertainly dont like hickies... and neither do any of my friends... but its always a conversation starter :P|`|8kbS2EU3aa	sounds like they are immature. are they young? must be. but anyways. sometimes people get hickeys on accident. and then show them off because they are whitetrash and want attention. or they get hickeys on accident and try to hide it as much as possible. like putting makeup on it and stuff. (even though nothing helps) and people dont get hickeys just by sitting there and letting the other person suck on their neck. (unless thats what your brother is doing!) it happens with people engage in sexual activity usually. and it just happens! lol idk. sounds like you are younger. you will understand when you grow up!|`|VLRZT9Foaa	Having a hicky on your neck just screams trashy.<br>  <br>  It's usually some nasty looking person that has them, because nobody with any class would do that. <br>  <br>  There is nothing attractive about them on anyone.|`|ISbtuWdTaa	I guess in a way people feel that they are "branded" by the other.  Kind of like a statement to the world saying, "Hey, look at me!  I got some action last night!!"<br>  <br>  I personally think hickeys are completely trashy!|`|swTjhCznaa	it's not sexy.  it's trashy|`|BXd4I9mmaa	It's not sexy at all. It's trashy.|`|7bIrMvziaa	Lol<br>  necking is okay<br>  But hickeys are trashy<br>  It makes the girl/guy look like a whore/man whore|`|zNn9VfRyaa	its not sexy its something kids do. it comes from it feels good esp if ur neck is ur hotspot|`|NtSQcyHLaa	To answer your first question: *that* is not "sexy." When people parade their body marks around like that, it's childish and immature. The sexy part of "hickies" is the intimacy involved. It should be the result of a private, intimate moment between you and a person you love. The only problem is that people like your older brother use them as badges to project publicly their sex life. So, it's a cultural thing to brand yourself like that and show all your friends, but that doesn't make it right or mature.|`|ShIE9edqaa	Every and each one of the people who said it's trashy and low class and stuff like that sounds like he/she are ugly, not that wanted, have a boring relationship, or very old.... don't u people get it? when u have some hot sex u don't stop and think: oh I should limit where to let my partner kiss me to the areas that can be covered, or: i shouldn't kiss that hard on her neck.. I feel so sorry for ur boring sex life.... cuz' when u have sex u just connect with the other person and forget the world... who cares what people think about it, u want me to think about what people think while i'm having sex, that's pathetic... to the people who think it's trashy I say: maybe u should go to Walmart and buy a Mind-Opener so u become a little open-minded.... boring traditional lonely losers.|`|07c9c8887a2079668fc6b70291da5a98aa	its kind of a cute thing for a relationship I think.  It's also a symbol of love for one another to show it in something that is "harmless".  yes, it is funny.  anyways it is something some people really like and some don't so go with what you want.|`|qlCsVelaaa	it makes them feel special + wanted + also loved !! :)<br>  <br>  anwer mine pleasee... <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjtF8mDZqOGVgEZp_GpVwSfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090303105954AAyJG1M">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Qp5Eqs0Naa	The hicky is a status symbol and showing it off is one of the 7 deadly sins, Pride. Same reason why people show of fast cars, big houses, trophy wives, etc.|`|pTcm0wttaa	Some people just become happy or proud of having a hickey.|`|Hk6wIgiOaa	I think it look TACKY.... But yes means ur taken.
